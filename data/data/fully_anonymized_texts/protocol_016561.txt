 Page 6 of 76 2.0 Introduction, Background, and Rationale  2.1 Introduction  The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) is a non-profit research and educational organization working to obtain approval as a clinical trial sponsor for the prescription use of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) to assist psychotherapy. Currently MAPS is conducting a global series of Phase 2 clinical trials designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in treating Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). This study will explore the use of MDMA in an additional indication for anxiety and stress disorders, related to end of life. This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled exploratory pi[INVESTIGATOR_120545]-assisted psychotherapy for anxiety in people with a life-threatening illness that is ongoing or with the possibility of recurrence.    The ongoing studies using MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in the treatment of PTSD will be used to inform the safety and dosing aspects of this new investigation of a potential therapy that could benefit the quality of life of adults with end-of-life anxiety. MAPS has published results showing clinically and statistically significant improvements in PTSD severity from twenty subjects treated in their first pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (MP-1) in the [LOCATION_002] (U.S.) [1]. Findings from the long-term follow-up of MP-[ADDRESS_988369]-treatment [2]. The sponsor’s second Phase 2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_404668] (MP-2) in twelve subjects suggests clinically significant improvements in PTSD symptoms with a trend toward statistical significance [3]. Long-term follow-up data, twelve months later, suggest that therapeutic benefits continued to increase in this subject population.  This exploratory placebo-controlled study is designed to investigate the safety and feasibility of MDMA-assisted therapy in [ADDRESS_988370] the physical symptoms of their condition. Anxiety, depression, anger, and despair often exacerbate the distress already caused by [CONTACT_723932], and can significantly

 Page 7 of 76 increase caregiver distress as well [4]. End-of-life problems, including pain management, are increasingly recognized by [CONTACT_723933] [5-7]. Research suggests that diagnosis of, and living with a life-threatening illness can result in symptoms similar to those seen in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and that these symptoms may persist even if the individual recovers, or their illness goes into remission [8, 9]. These symptoms may include emotional avoidance and numbing, difficulty relating to or connecting with friends or loved ones, difficulty sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], a sense of foreshortened future, and intrusive thoughts or memories related to the illness.  While efforts to enhance palliative care for the terminally ill have improved greatly over the last several decades, and significant strides have been made in reducing individuals’ physical pain and discomfort, less progress has been made in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_723856]. Fears of loss of autonomy, helplessness, and death itself are also often accompanied by [CONTACT_723934]. In a 2003 report, McClain et al. [10] support developi[INVESTIGATOR_723857]-being of people with terminal illness by “…keepi[INVESTIGATOR_723858] a minimum. What is less clear, however, is whether interventions exist that can help raise a terminally ill individual’s sense of spi[INVESTIGATOR_176315]-being.”  Given that in this situation, spi[INVESTIGATOR_37312], familial, psychological, and existential concerns all take a position of primary and imminent importance for many people, the development of new treatment modalities to meet these needs is a clear imperative. Enabling individuals to face life-threatening illness and all of its concomitant difficulties with dignity, creativity, love, support, and kindness is the primary impetus for this research study.   2.2.2 MDMA  MDMA is a ring-substituted phenylisopropylamine derivative invented by [CONTACT_723935] 1912 [11, 12]. MDMA is a monoamine releaser that has its greatest effects on serotonin, followed by [CONTACT_90005][INVESTIGATOR_57174] [13-18]. MDMA is capable of inducing unique psychopharmacological effects, including:  • Decreased feelings of fear • Increased feelings of wellbeing • Increased sociability and extroversion • Increased interpersonal trust • Alert state of consciousness  Early observers noted increased acceptance of self and others, increased tolerance of emotionally upsetting materials, and the ability to address these issues without extreme disorientation or ego loss [19-22]. In the U.S., MDMA was used as an adjunct to psychotherapy by a considerable number of psychiatrists, including this study’s Principal Investigator (PI) and other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_586450], relationship problems, 
MAPS Study MDA-1                                                                                            Protocol Amendment 1  U.S.                                                                                                                                   29 April, 2015 
 Page 8 of 76 and PTSD [19, 20, 23, 24] before it was placed in Schedule 1 in 1985, as a result of the DEA’s concern for extensive non-medical use [22, 25, 26]. Placement in Schedule [ADDRESS_988371] found a small percentage of people exhibit problematic use of ecstasy (material represented as containing MDMA) [27, 28]. Studies of regular or problematic ecstasy users indicate that on average, regular use occurs no more often than once a week [29]. Hence, MDMA may have moderate abuse potential. See the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for a more detailed explanation.  2.2.3 Previous Clinical Experience with MDMA  Classification as a Schedule 1 drug hampered research into the medical uses of MDMA. In recent years, clinical investigation of the safety and effectiveness of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy has become more feasible due to an open IND with the FDA[30-32]. The first double-blind, placebo-controlled U.S. Phase 1 study sanctioned by [CONTACT_723936] 1994, with findings that suggested MDMA caused a significant increase in body temperature and heart rate in some healthy volunteers [33]. However, these increases were found to be transient and generally tolerable in a controlled clinical setting [33]. Subsequent trials confirmed that MDMA produced significant increases in heart rate and blood pressure that were likely to be well tolerated by [CONTACT_302047] [33-39]. The elevation in body temperature noted in healthy volunteers was not clinically significant in the sponsor’s proof-of-principle MP-1 study comparing MDMA to placebo in subjects with PTSD [1].    The potentially therapeutic effects of MDMA were initially investigated starting in 2000, in a MAPS-sponsored dose response pi[INVESTIGATOR_723859], in women survivors of sexual assault with treatment-resistant PTSD [40, 41]. Unfortunately, the study in Spain was halted in 2002 due to political pressure from the Madrid Anti-Drug Authority.  Prior to its suspension, six women who were enrolled and treated in this study with single doses ranging from 50 mg to 75 mg demonstrated mild signs of improvement without any adverse events (AEs) or signs of deteriorating mental health [41].   MAPS went on to sponsor the first randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_120545]-assisted psychotherapy for the treatment of chronic, treatment resistant PTSD, which demonstrated promising results in a sample of 20 subjects [1]. Findings from the long-term follow-up of this study indicate that the therapeutic benefits have been sustained over time on average, although two subjects experienced a relapse in PTSD symptoms [2]. The sponsor also supported a randomized, double-blind pi[INVESTIGATOR_9985] [ADDRESS_988372] significant improvement in subjects receiving 125 mg MDMA at two-month 
MAPS Study MDA-1                                                                                            Protocol Amendment 1  U.S.                                                                                                                                   29 April, 2015 
 Page 9 of 76 follow-up, when compared to a 25 mg active placebo MDMA. The improvement continued to increase during the twelve-month follow-up [3]. These studies have shown promise for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy to help people overcome PTSD, an anxiety-related disorder, that suggest this treatment could also be useful in treating anxiety associated with end-of-life issues.  As of July 2014, MDMA has been administered to more than 1080 research subjects, in both Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies, with only a single occurrence of a drug-related SAE, and no unexpected related SAEs [1, 3, 13, 16, 25, 33, 34, 36, 37, 39, 40, 42-85].   2.2.[ADDRESS_988373] psychedelic drugs into Schedule 1, suggests that therapeutic interventions involving psychedelics such as LSD, psilocybin, and MDMA may help to address the personal, interpersonal, and existential issues that present during the course of a life-threatening illness [86-91]. MDMA shares with the ‘classical’ psychedelics LSD and psilocybin the ability to produce perceptions of new meanings for thoughts and objects [92], and increases tolerance for confronting negative memories [93]. Narrative reports support its use as a psychotherapeutic adjunct [94-97].  Prior to placement into Schedule I, MDMA was used in combination with psychotherapy  in the treatment of neuroses, relationship problems, and PTSD [20, 22, 24]. It was also used in the treatment of some individuals with chronic pain [19, 98], and in individuals with advanced cancer [19, 94-96, 98]. Case reports and narrative accounts of MDMA-assisted therapy indicate that the treatment was often successful [19, 20, 22, 23, 99, 100]. A discussion of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy and a discussion of several case studies appeared in a peer-reviewed journal [19].   MDMA-assisted psychotherapy is an innovative mode of treatment that combines psychotherapeutic techniques with the administration of MDMA as a pharmacological adjunct that may enhance or amplify certain aspects of psychotherapy. MDMA possesses unique pharmacological properties that may make it especially well suited to use as an adjunct to psychotherapy in PTSD and anxiety patients [37, 63, 66, 67, 85, 93, 101-103].   In a psychotherapeutic context, MDMA was reported to produce a lowering of defenses  and greater ability to think about and reflect on distressing thoughts and feelings [19, 21, 22, 76].  When spending time with loved ones, individuals who took MDMA in therapeutic contexts often spent time discussing painful or emotionally sensitive topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102], such as the impending death of a loved one in the advanced stages of cancer [94-97]. Reduction in pain was often reported [19, 94-97, 104].    Treatment goals of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for anxiety associated with life-threatening illness include alleviating symptoms, as well as helpi[INVESTIGATOR_723860] a perspective and orientation toward death and remaining life that supports well-being, 
MAPS Study MDA-1                                                                                            Protocol Amendment 1  U.S.                                                                                                                                   29 April, 2015 
 Page 10 of 76 creativity, love, compassion, and dignity. The biologic and psychotherapeutic approaches are intended to overlap and reinforce each other. Knowledge about the connections between the neurobiological and therapeutic effects of MDMA is far from complete, but it has been observed that MDMA acutely decreases activity in the left amygdala [101] and attenuates amygdalar response to angry faces [67]. This action is compatible with its reported reduction in fear or defensiveness and is in contrast to the stimulation of the amygdala which is observed in animal models of conditioned fear, a state similar to PTSD [105-107]. The reduction in stress-induced activation of the amygdala may be supported and enhanced by [CONTACT_404774][INVESTIGATOR_723861].  Oxytocin is a neurohormone associated with pair bonding and social affiliation in mammals [108]. Oxytocin administration is associated with increased interpersonal trust and attenuated reactivity to threatening faces [108-110]. Some researchers have suggested a role for oxytocin in treating PTSD [111]. MDMA has been shown to elevate serum oxytocin in humans [37, 112]. Brain imaging after MDMA indicates less reactivity to angry facial expressions and greater reward in happy faces [67]. The effects of MDMA on oxytocin may influence empathy or compassion for self and others, decrease defensiveness, and strengthen therapeutic alliance. These factors taken together can provide the opportunity for a corrective emotional experience [19].   A combined treatment of MDMA and psychotherapy may be especially useful for treating anxiety disorders because MDMA can attenuate the fear response of a perceived threat to one’s emotional integrity and decrease defensiveness without blocking access to memories or preventing a deep and genuine experience of emotion [1, 20, 22, 41]. This reduction in defensiveness may permit a deeper engagement with material that would otherwise be too distressing to face. Subjects are able to experience and express fear, anger, and grief with less likelihood of feeling overwhelmed by [CONTACT_120568]. MDMA seems to engender internal awareness that even painful feelings that arise are an important part of the therapeutic process. In addition, feelings of empathy, love, and deep appreciation often emerge, along with a clearer perspective of present difficulties, a more accurate perspective about their significance, and a heightened awareness of the support and safety that exists in the present. As a result, MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may enable the subjects to restructure their intra-psychic realities and develop a wider behavioral and emotional repertoire with which to respond to anxiogenic stimuli.   A comprehensive review of MDMA research is included in the IB supplied by [CONTACT_456]. This document should be reviewed prior to initiating the protocol.  2.[ADDRESS_988374] open-label experimental session, and at equivalent points in Stage 2.

Previous researchers have also used doses within this range [33, 34, 36, 38, 54, 113-117]. Prior to the scheduling of MDMA, similar doses and regimens were used in psychotherapy [20, 22, 25]. The initial active dose is expected to produce all the commonly reported effects of MDMA. The supplemental dose will prolong subjective drug effects without producing physiological effects any greater than peak effects occurring after the initial dose.  3.[ADDRESS_988376] safety data.  3.1 Primary Objective  The primary objective of the study is to assess changes in trait anxiety in subjects receiving active dose MDMA compared to those receiving placebo as measured by [CONTACT_488671]-Trait scores at Baseline and the Primary Endpoint, one month after the second experimental session.  3.2 Secondary Objectives  The additional objectives of the study involve comparing subjects receiving active dose MDMA to those receiving placebo for the following exploratory objectives:  • Assess changes in self-reported State Anxiety symptoms as measured with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory—State subscale (STAI-State) from Baseline to the Primary Endpoint. • Assess changes in self-reported depression symptoms with the Beck Depression Inventory- II (BDI-II) from Baseline to the Primary Endpoint. • Assess changes in clinician ratings of depression symptoms with the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) from Baseline to the Primary Endpoint. • Assess changes in quality of life with Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Scale (FACIT-Sp) from Baseline to the Primary Endpoint. • Assess changes in global functioning with the Global Assessment of Functionality (GAF) from Baseline and the Primary Endpoint. • Assess changes in self-reported sleep quality with the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272] (PSQI) from Baseline to the Primary Endpoint.  • Assess changes in subjects’ attitudes toward death with the Death Attitudes Profile (DAP) from Baseline to the Primary Endpoint. • Assess personal growth with the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) from Baseline to the Primary Endpoint. • Assess caregiver perceptions of subjects’ personal growth with the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory—Caregiver Form (PTGI-C) from Baseline to the Primary Endpoint. • Assess changes in self-oriented compassion with the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) from Baseline to the Primary Endpoint. • Assess changes in self-reported mindfulness with the Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) from Baseline to the Primary Endpoint.

 Page 14 of 76 associated with a life-threatening cancer or non-dementing neurological illness, which may be ongoing or in remission but with the possibility of recurrence. Stage 1 will include two blinded and one open-label MDMA-assisted psychotherapy sessions scheduled two to four weeks apart with a male/female co-therapi[INVESTIGATOR_194889]. Therapy teams will consist of varying combinations of the Principal Investigator, experienced co-therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], and intern co-therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]. Subjects will be treated by [CONTACT_723937]. There will also be a moderate course of preparatory sessions and integrative sessions, as described in the Time and Events Table.  Upon enrollment, subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either placebo (five subjects) or active dose (thirteen subjects) MDMA. In Stage 1, subjects will meet with their therapi[INVESTIGATOR_723864]-assisted psychotherapy. After each experimental session, subjects will stay overnight at the site and complete an integrative session the next day, followed by [CONTACT_723938]. One month after the second experimental session, the Primary Endpoint assessment will take place, after which the blind will be broken. All subjects who received the active dose will then receive a third open-label experimental session with active dose MDMA. Subjects who receive the placebo will be offered the option to continue to the open-label Stage 2, unless they meet any exclusion criteria for study participation. In Stage 2, subjects will receive active dose MDMA in three experimental sessions that will otherwise follow the same sequence of events after a single preparatory session. (See Time and Events Table).   A blinded Independent Rater will administer the MADRS and the GAF; all other outcome measures will be collected via subjects’ self-report or via report provided by a caregiver or observer.  Anxiety symptoms will be assessed in all subjects throughout Stage 1, and anxiety symptoms will be assessed throughout Stage [ADDRESS_988377] experimental session in Stage 2 for subjects who received placebo in Stage 1. In addition all subjects will complete visits six months and then 12 months after their final experimental session where outcome measures and a questionnaire on any lasting benefits or harms of the treatment will be administered. (See Time and Events Table)  The sponsor will conduct an ongoing review of video data of psychotherapy sessions, entry criteria, vital signs, and reaction data for completed sessions and any AEs. The sponsor will provide ongoing feedback to the co-therapi[INVESTIGATOR_723865], subject safety, and to support the sponsor’s effort to manualize MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for this indication.

All psychotherapy sessions, including experimental sessions, will be recorded to video, with all recordings preserved for research and training purposes.   5.1.1 Outcome Measures  The primary outcome measure will be the trait subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), a 20-item self-report measure of intensity of anxiety [118]. The STAI is considered the definitive instrument for assessing anxiety in adults, and has been administered to advanced-stage cancer patients. Each item consists of a 4-point Likert rating scale ranging from 1 (‘Not at all’) to 4 (‘Very Much So’). The STAI differentiates between state anxiety, defined as anxiety experienced in reaction to a specific environmental circumstance, and trait anxiety, defined as long-standing nervous affect or anxiety disorder. The Trait score has good to strong test-retest reliability in adults and is a well-established measure of anxiety. The use of the trait subscale as the primary outcome measure is intended to target those anxiety symptoms that are chronic and pervasive. The STAI-Trait will be administered at baseline, the primary and secondary endpoints, and at the one, six, and 12-month follow-up visits.  
MAPS Study MDA-1                                                                                          Protocol Amendment 1 U.S.                                                                                                                         29 April, 2015 
Page 22 of 76 The secondary measure of anxiety symptoms will be the state subscale of the STAI (STAI-S), a 20-item self-report scale which will assess subjects’ levels of transient, situationally oriented anxiety [118]. Like the trait subscale, participants respond to each item on the state subscale by [CONTACT_20683] a response from a 4-point Likert scale. The comparison of the two subscales will provide information about the specific anxiolytic effects of MDMA, as well as the types of anxiety most often experienced in individuals with a life-threatening illness. The STAI-State will be administered at baseline, the third preparatory session, the primary and secondary endpoints, and at the one, six, and 12-month follow-up visits.  The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) is a 1996 revision of the BDI, a 21-item self-report measure [119, 120], that will serve as a measure of depression according to DSM-IV criteria [121]. The BDI-II has been validated, has high internal consistency and good test/re-test reliability, and is not overly sensitive to daily variations in mood. It takes five to ten minutes to complete [121]. Score cutoffs indicate: 0-[ADDRESS_988397] experimental session, the primary and secondary endpoints, and at the one, six, and 12-month follow-up visits.  The Global Assessment of Function (GAF) is a measure of global functioning made through clinical observation. The GAF consists of a single score, with scores ranging from 0 to 100, with 100 reflecting superior function and zero reflecting serious risk of causing harm to the self or others. The GAF is a reliable, validated measure of social functioning [122]. The GAF will be administered by [CONTACT_723944], the primary and secondary endpoints, and at the one, six, and 12-month follow-up visits.  The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272] (PSQI) is a measure of self-reported sleep quality over a one month period. The PSQI was designed to be a reliable, standardized measure able to distinguish between good and poor sleepers. It consists of 19 items, with possible responses ranging from zero to four on a five-point scale [123]. The PSQI consists of seven sub-scales; sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, use of sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_133527], and daytime dysfunction. These are all summed to produce a single global scale. Global scores can range from [ADDRESS_988398] reliability ranges from 0.85 to 0.87, and it is internally consistent, with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.83[123, 124]. Global scores correlate with other measures of alertness and self-reported sleep quality [125]. The PSQI will be administered at the first preparatory session, the primary and secondary endpoints, and at the one, six, and 12-month follow-up visits.  The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is a10-item, clinician-administered questionnaire used to diagnose the severity of depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. The MADRS was designed as a measure of depression that would be more sensitive to the changes produced by [CONTACT_723945] [126]. Score cutoffs

MADRS scores are strongly correlated with scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating scale [126].   The Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) is a 21-item self-report measure of perceived growth or benefits occurring after a traumatic event [127]. It contains five subscales; relationship to others, new possibilities, personal strength, spi[INVESTIGATOR_116172], and appreciation of life [127, 128]. In this study, subjects will complete the PTGI in reference to the time since their diagnosis at baseline, but will respond in reference to the beginning of their participation in the study on all subsequent occasions. Subjects will complete the PTGI according to the Time and Events table. The PTGI will be administered at the first preparatory session, the primary and secondary endpoints, and at the one, six, and 12-month follow-up visits. The PTGI has been used in samples of people with life-threatening illnesses, such as diagnosis with breast cancer [129, 130].   The Posttraumatic Growth Inventory—Caregiver Form (PTGI-C) is a version of the original 21-item PTGI questionnaire containing the same items but with modified instructions for a caregiver to provide perceptions of subjects [131]. Where the subject version of the PTGI prompts the subject to answer based on their own experience, the PTGI-C prompts the caregiver or study partner to rate the study subject along the same metrics. This adaptation of the PTGI has not been validated, but has been used in other research, including studies of people with cancer or cancer survivors and significant others [130-132]. The PTGI-C will be administered at the first preparatory session, the primary and secondary endpoints, and at the one, six, and 12-month follow-up visits.   The Observer Rating Form is a 15-item questionnaire that prompts individuals close to the study subject to rate changes to the subject’s mood, demeanor, and behavior over the course of their participation in the study. The ORF is typi[INVESTIGATOR_723871]. The ORF is not a peer-reviewed or validated scale, but it has been used in a currently ongoing study of psilocybin for anxiety associated with a life-threatening illness at Johns Hopkins University. The ORF will be administered to up to three individuals selected by [CONTACT_163727], the primary endpoint, and at the six- and 12-month follow-up visits. There are no current reports on validity or reliability of the ORF, but researchers investigating the effects of psilocybin have employed this measure [133].  The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Scale (FACIT-Sp) is a 27-item self-report measure of quality of life issues specifically relevant to individuals with a chronic or life-threatening illness or condition [134, 135]. The core questionnaire consists of four subscales: Physical Well-being, Social/Family Well-being, Emotional Well-being, and Functional Well-being. The version of the FACIT selected for this study also includes a 12-item spi[INVESTIGATOR_723872]. The FACIT is a well-validated instrument with direct applicability to individuals with chronic health concerns. The FACIT will be

The Death Attitudes Profile (DAP) is a 32-item self-report questionnaire that assesses individual attitudes and beliefs about death and dying. Each item on the scale is rated along a 7-point Likert scale ranging from ‘strongly agree’ to ‘strongly disagree.’ [136-138]. The DAP divides items along 5 dimensions: fear of death, death avoidance, neutral acceptance, approach acceptance, and escape acceptance. The DAP will be administered at the first preparatory session, the primary and secondary endpoints, and at the one, six, and 12-month follow-up visits.   The Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) is a 39-item self-report questionnaire that assesses how often and to what degree respondents experience or utilize mindfulness in their everyday life [139, 140]. Subjects respond to the FFMQ using a five-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1=never or very rarely true to 5=very often or always true. The questionnaire divides mindfulness into five component skills: observing, describing, acting with awareness, nonjudging of inner experience, and nonreactivity to inner experience. The FFMQ has been found to have good construct validity in discerning regular practitioners of mindfulness meditation from nonpractitioners [140-142]. Its use in this study is intended to explore the effects of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy on experiences of mindfulness, regardless of past meditation or mindfulness experience. The FFMQ will be administered at the second preparatory session, the primary and secondary endpoints, and at the one, six, and 12-month follow-up visits.  The Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) is a 26-item self-report questionnaire that assesses how respondents relate to themselves and treat themselves during difficult or painful experiences [143]. Items are scored along a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1=almost never to 5=almost always. The SCS has six component scores: self-kindness, self-judgment, common humanity, isolation, mindfulness, and over-identification. These subscores can also be used to generate an overall composite score. Higher scores have been found to correlate with positive mental health outcomes, as well as decreased depression and anxiety . The SCS will be administered at the second preparatory session, the primary and secondary endpoints, and at the one, six, and 12-month follow-up visits. The SCS is reliable, with strong test-retest reliability and validation in comparison with measures selected for similarity or distinctness from the construct [143]   The Long-term Follow-up Questionnaire has been developed internally by [CONTACT_723946]-term benefits and harms of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy at the six and 12-month follow-up visits.  The measure has been used to assess the durability and nature of effects of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in people with PTSD [2].  5.1.[ADDRESS_988401] safety. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_723873] (BLS) certification.  Safety measures, including vital signs and a measurement of psychological distress, will be assessed during all experimental sessions. Subjects will rate their current degree of subjective distress with the SUD scale, which is a single-item self-report scale. The SUD will be completed repeatedly during the experimental sessions, with the degree of distress described as a single number along a seven-point scale. Results of the SUD are intended to assist therapi[INVESTIGATOR_723874].  The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_723875], on each integrative session and during integrative telephone calls for seven days. Results of this scale are intended to assist therapi[INVESTIGATOR_404693].  The C-SSRS is a clinician-administered measure of suicidal behavior devised to detect potential suicidal thoughts or behaviors during a clinical trial [144]. It consists of a Baseline form that assesses lifetime suicidal ideation, ideation intensity and behavior, and a form for assessing current suicidal ideation and behavior. The C-SSRS consists of a series of questions, and can be administered during a face-to-face interview or over the telephone. Suicidality will be assessed at Baseline, once during any face-to-face visit, during the second and seventh days of integrative telephone contact, and twice during each experimental session. Subjects who are discontinuing medication to participate in the study will complete the C-SSRS before and after medication washout. The C-SSRS data will be collected on Case Report Forms (CRFs) for all administrations except for the second integrative session, unless the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_404694]. C-SSRS data from the second integrative session after each experimental session will be kept with the subject’s Source Record.  The Brief Pain Inventory—Short Form (BPI-S) is a self-report measure of physical pain symptoms that is intended to provide an overall pi[INVESTIGATOR_723876]’ chronic pain over the course of the study [145]. The BPI-S includes a visual component, where subjects are asked to indicate where on their body they experience pain, scales for rating pain severity, efficacy of pharmacotherapy in relieving pain, and the degree to which pain impi[INVESTIGATOR_723877]’ ability to function. This measure or translations of it are used in studies assessing cancer pain and pain arising from other illnesses, such as osteoarthritis [7, 146, 147] The BPI-S will be administered during the preparatory period, as well as at the first integrative session following each experimental session, and at the primary and secondary endpoints.   Cardiovascular effects will be assessed via blood pressure and pulse measurement.  Blood pressure and heart rate will be assessed periodically during each experimental session by [CONTACT_404789] (BP) and pulse monitor. Blood pressure and pulse will be measured at the outset of the experimental session, once approximately every [ADDRESS_988402] at the integrative session on the day after each blinded experimental session in Stage 1. These beliefs are collected as a part of the sponsor’s ongoing initiative to optimize the double-blind as a part of dose response studies.   The States of Consciousness Questionnaire (SOCQ) is a 100-item questionnaire based on the “Peak Experience Profile” designed by [CONTACT_194973] [133, 148]. Subjects respond to the SOCQ using a six-point Likert-type scale anchored at 0=none at all and 5=extreme (more than ever before in my life). It has seven subscale scores; internal unity, external unity, transcendence of time and space, ineffability and paradoxicality (claim of difficulty in describing the experience in words), sense of sacredness, noetic quality, and deeply felt positive mood. The measure is a self-report instrument and takes approximately twenty to thirty minutes to complete. Subjects will complete the SOCQ after each experimental session, at any time between the end of an experimental session and prior to leaving the treatment facility the next day.  The Psychological Process Questionnaire (PPQ) is a 35-item companion questionnaire to the SOCQ designed by [CONTACT_723947], in which subjects rate each item along the same six-point Likert-type scale. It is intended to capture a broader array of experiences and benefits than those captured in the SOCQ, particularly in respect to perceived insights or benefits from alterations in consciousness [149]. The PPQ focuses primarily upon changes in cognitive and/or emotional processing that may be experienced in the course of an MDMA-assisted psychotherapy session, and is intended to provide a fuller pi[INVESTIGATOR_723878]. Subjects will complete the PPQ after each experimental session, at any time between the end of an experimental session and prior to leaving the treatment facility the next day.

Page 27 of 76  5.2 Study Procedures and Visit Descriptions   5.2.1 Prescreening, Screening, and Baseline Evaluation - Pre-study   Prospective subjects will be prescreened by [CONTACT_194976]-approved script to learn if they meet basic eligibility criteria. This script will include the STAI-Trait and the Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale (OASIS) [150] instruments as a means of estimating eligibility for the study. Data from these assessments will not be used in any study analyses, and the STAI-Trait assessment will be repeated in full at each subjects’ baseline visit. All individuals who are prescreened should be assigned a screening number and recorded on the Subject Screening Log where information on the selection of potential subjects in the trial should be collected.   Upon signing the IRB-approved informed consent form (ICF), the potential subject may commence study-related screening activities. The screening number should also be recorded on the signed ICF. If a subject is enrolled, the study staff should record the enrollment date and assign a subject number. If a subject is not enrolled, an explanation should be recorded on the Screening Log. A CRF will not be completed for subjects who are not enrolled. These subjects will only be documented on the Screening Log and Source Records.  It is the responsibility of the CI to file the Screening Log in the investigator site file (ISF) to be readily available for on-site monitoring and/or inspection by [CONTACT_190660]. Screening may take place over more than one day and should be complete by [CONTACT_586545]. If, after reviewing all information, the CI concludes that a subject is eligible, they will enroll the subject in the study. Visits will be scheduled consecutively, as described in the Time and Events Table.   a. Explain and obtain written informed consent from the subject. Written informed consent must be obtained prior to performing any tests or evaluations for the study. Any potential subjects who are private patients of the CI must have their records and eligibility reviewed by [CONTACT_179202], who will also conduct the informed consent process with the subject. b. Assign the subject a screening number. Complete the Screening Log.  c.

Subjects should bring the Memory Aid Cards to this visit, to be used as aids in recollection.  These cards will not be collected. AEs and concomitant medications will be collected, as described in Section 8.[ADDRESS_988423] Numbering  Prior to enrollment, subjects will be tracked with their initials and a screening number assigned sequentially starting at “S001”. Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the study and will be assigned a five-digit alphanumeric subject identification number.  The first two digits will be “51” and will identify the protocol. The next three digits identify the subject within the site and will be assigned sequentially, with [ADDRESS_988424] will be [ZIP_CODE], the second will be [ZIP_CODE], etc.   In total, 18 subjects will be enrolled into the study. The randomized portion of the study will be blinded and there will be a 13:[ADDRESS_988425]'s condition assignment, the blind may be broken for an individual subject.

Subjects will be clinically monitored after withdrawal, the cause of which will be re-corded in the subject’s source records and CRF. Whenever possible, the tests and evaluations listed for the termination and outcome visits will be carried out. Efforts will be made to obtain information about AE outcomes, if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or sponsor.  If a subject develops any exclusion criteria that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_586489], affects the safety of the subject, including psychiatric diagnosis, pregnancy, or requiring use of excluded medications, the subject will discontinue treatment but remain in the study for follow-up purposes. Whenever possible, the tests and evaluations listed for the Primary Endpoint and twelve-month follow-up will be carried out. Efforts will be made to obtain information about AE outcomes, if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_978], Medical Monitor, and/or sponsor.

See Section 2.2.[ADDRESS_988429].  6.2 Preparation and Administration  In this study, 18 subjects will be randomized to the two conditions, as described in Table 5 (below). The blind will be broken for each subject after the Primary Endpoint is completed. The subjects who received MDMA will be offered one additional open-label experimental session with active dose MDMA. The subjects who received the placebo will be offered the opportunity to enroll in an open-label Stage 2 where they will receive active dose MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. Stage 2 visits will be conducted in a manner similar to Stage 1.  6.2.1 Doses  Table 5. Doses of MDMA Number of Subjects Condition (first 2 exp. Sessions) Blind?

Page 41 of 76 MDMA in bulk will be sent from a Schedule 1 licensed storage facility to the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) Schedule I license holder for the study. The Schedule I license holder and unblinded randomization monitor will oversee compounding by a pharmacist in a manner that will maintain the blind for the Schedule I license holder. The pharmacist will provide bulk lactose for compounding MDMA capsules. The pharmacist will compound the MDMA with lactose into doses of 125 mg and 62.5 mg (calculated as the weight of the hydrochloride salt) and placed in gelatin capsules. Capsules for the initial dose will be clearly differentiated from capsules used for the supplemental dose by [CONTACT_723957]. All capsules will be compounded so that they weigh the same amount, but contain varying amounts of MDMA and lactose.   The encapsulation will be performed by a pharmacist who has the appropriate skills. The MDMA will be weighed out (calculated as the weight of the hydrochloride salt) into gelatin capsules in combination with lactose used to ensure that all capsules have similar appearance and weight. Capsules for all experimental, double-blind sessions will be prepared in such a way as to prevent Clinical Investigators and subjects from distinguishing contents of active dose and comparator dose capsules. Dosage for open-label sessions will be clearly indicated in the packaging.  6.2.3 Labeling  The IP for each experimental session will be packaged in one primary container, labeled with a unique container number, protocol number, drug name, lot number, sponsor name, experimental session number, stage, and a statement that the drug is restricted to clinical trial use only. All drug labels will comply with federal and state regulations and will be provided in English. The initial and supplemental dose will be packaged in separate labeled “inner envelopes” within the primary container. There will be one primary container per subject per experimental session. The sponsor randomization monitor will oversee the process of blinded drug packaging conducted by [CONTACT_194961]. This list will not be shared with any blinded site or sponsor staff. The pharmacist and randomization monitor will be the only staff who are unblinded.   Figure 2.

The web-based randomization system will enable tracking of blinded primary containers for drug accountability purposes.  6.4 Drug Storage and Handling   MDMA is a Schedule I compound and will be stored and handled in compliance with all relevant federal and state regulations. In accordance with these requirements, the Schedule I license holder will be responsible for storing, dispensing, and administering the MDMA. It will be stored in a secure safe in accordance with federal and state regulations.    IP will only be removed for a single experimental session at a time and will be administered orally at the office of the PI. All doses administered will be recorded on the appropriate accountability and administration logs. Only the initial dose is required to be given at each experimental session. Supplemental doses are provided for each experimental session but are optional to use.   The Schedule 1 License Holder will dispense the appropriate container number for each experimental session.  If an optional dose is not administered, the unused capsules will be kept in their respective inner envelopes inside of the primary container in the safe for drug accountability.   Records pertaining to the use of scheduled, regulated compounds will be maintained in accordance with relevant federal and state regulations.     6.5 MDMA Stability  Complete details on the chemistry, manufacturing, and control of the MDMA to be used are described in Drug Master file (DMF) # 6293.  As described in that file, MDMA was prepared for human consumption in 1985 by [CONTACT_147969], Ph.D., at the Dept. of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacology, Purdue University.  The identity and purity of this MDMA was confirmed using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) in 1997, as described in DMF # 6293, and was found to be 99.87% pure. On August 12, 2002, Chemic Laboratories reanalyzed the MDMA at the request of the sponsor prior to 
MAPS Study MDA-1                                                                                          Protocol Amendment 1 U.S.                                                                                                                         29 April, 2015 
Page 44 of 76 starting MAPS’ first U.S. pi[INVESTIGATOR_120545]-assisted psychotherapy in people with PTSD. The analysis found the MDMA to be more than 99.7% pure. A more recent analysis performed by [CONTACT_194962]. Carl Hart in February 2006, continued to find a high degree of purity. This analysis found the MDMA in question to be 99.9% pure.  This MDMA is currently in use in an ongoing investigation of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in the U.S.  It was also used in MP-1, with drug administration ending in 2008, and in a non-sponsor supported study in 2006 [154].  7.[ADDRESS_988433] generally not been associated with serious discomfort by [CONTACT_723959].  Common reactions include lack of appetite, insomnia, dizziness, tight jaw or bruxism (tooth-grinding), difficulty concentrating, impaired gait or balance, dry 
MAPS Study MDA-[ADDRESS_988434]. Other slightly less common reactions include restlessness, parasthesias (odd somatic feelings, such as tingling or feeling hot or cold), impaired judgment, perspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], drowsiness, and nystagmus (eye-wiggling).  While anxiety, headache, fatigue, insomnia, and lack of appetite were spontaneously reported by 40% to 80% of subjects in both conditions in MAPS study MP-1 (N=23), tight jaw, nausea, impaired gait/balance, and sensitivity to cold were more often reported by [CONTACT_586554], and irritability was slightly more likely to be reported in the placebo condition. Additionally, subjects in the MDMA condition were more likely to report muscle tension in various body parts and diarrhea.   These effects are transient and diminish as drug effects wane. Sub-acute effects that may either continue for the next 24 hours or appear later include insomnia, fatigue, needing more sleep, weakness, heavy legs, dry mouth, low mood, or irritability. Sub-acute effects are reported less often than acute effects. More information on spontaneously reported reactions is described in the IB.   MDMA may produce mild alterations in sensory perception and altered perception of time [36, 92, 155].  Women may be more sensitive to these effects [114].  MDMA acutely affects attention, information processing, and memory. MDMA acutely impairs verbal memory and recall for object location without affecting recall of complex scene changes [156]. Preclinical data in animals suggests that the profile of neurotransmitter release observed after MDMA administration may increase the risk of mania in some individuals [157], although mania has not yet been a reported side effect of MDMA or ecstasy.! For this reason, subjects will stay at the site overnight and will not be permitted to drive after experimental sessions.   MDMA may produce modest changes in immune functioning, lasting up to 48 hours [158, 159]. Because of their limited duration, these changes are not likely to have clinical significance beyond several days of possible increased risk of viral upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_194918]. For this reason, potential subjects with lowered white blood cell counts or other signs of impaired immunity will be excluded from the study.  Further information on the risks associated with MDMA, including information drawn from case reports and studies of ecstasy users, can be found in the IB.   7.2.[ADDRESS_988435] no more than six hours. In less than 5% of volunteers in Phase 1 studies, peak blood pressure values were higher than 140/[ADDRESS_988436] hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], as described in Section 8.4. Reasons for moving a patient to an Emergency Department (ED) would include, but not be limited to, severe headache in the setting of hypertension, angina, or neurological deficits regardless of blood pressure.

Page 47 of 76  7.2.2 Psychological Distress  Mild anxiety and depressed mood are occasionally reported one to three days after MDMA administration [34, 114, and see the IB]. Psychological distress from MDMA could arise from the first indications of drug effects until the last effects have dissipated (approximately three to five hours after drug administration) or even later. Anxiety or distress during the session may last for as little as five minutes or for as long as five hours or more.  In addition, psychological distress could arise following an MDMA session as a result of subjects having difficulty integrating their experience after the MDMA effect has subsided. In previous Phase [ADDRESS_988439] with acute or sub-acute reactions. The potential for destabilizing psychological distress will be minimized by:  • Excluding people who might be more vulnerable to it (such as people diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder - 1 or with psychotic disorders) • Preparatory non-drug psychotherapy sessions before the experimental session • Creating an atmosphere of trust during the experimental session • Close monitoring • Daily contact [CONTACT_404804] a week after the experimental session • Providing non-drug psychotherapy sessions • Subjects will remain at the study site for the night of each experimental session to further reduce psychological distress. Qualified personnel will be available during the overnight stay to respond to the needs of the subject. Attendants will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_38802][INVESTIGATOR_404741] a potential serious adverse event.   During the preparatory sessions, subjects will be made aware of the fact that difficult emotions, including grief, rage, fear or panic, may arise during experimental sessions.  Every effort will be made to help subjects resolve difficult symptoms and to arrive at a more comfortable and relaxed state by [CONTACT_723960], including empathic listening on the part of the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_723906].   At the end of the six to eight hour experimental session, if the subject is still severely agitated or experiencing any other severe psychological distress, the following measures will be taken:

During this time, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_723908], will talk with the subject to help him or her gain cognitive perspective toward their experiences, and will help the subject implement the self-soothing and stress inoculation techniques presented during the preparatory sessions.

If the subject has previously been prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_723914], and is experiencing significant pain during this period, the subject will be permitted to administer their medication. This medication will be captured on the concomitant medications CRF page.  The physician should not prescribe an SSRI, SNRI, or MAOI in this context, unless it has been determined that the subject will be withdrawn from the study.

If at any time the temperature rises more than 1.5° C above baseline despi[INVESTIGATOR_120502], the PI [INVESTIGATOR_723915].     7.2.4 Reproductive and Developmental Risks  Risks posed by [CONTACT_147989].  One of two studies of Ecstasy users suggests that use of Ecstasy and other drugs during pregnancy may be associated with some abnormalities at birth while the other failed to find this association [163, 164], and a third reported some developmental delays in mothers reporting use of ecstasy and other drugs during pregnancy [165].    Pregnant and lactating women will be excluded from participation in the study. Women who are able to become pregnant must have a negative pregnancy screen before undergoing each experimental session and must agree to use birth control for the treatment portion of the study.  7.2.5 Potential Neurotoxicity Associated with Ecstasy Use  Some researchers believe that MDMA is neurotoxic in humans even at doses used in clinical trials [166].  However, they are basing their case on studies that employed inappropriately high doses of MDMA utilized in animal studies and on human studies comparing the effects of repeated use of ecstasy, often along with other drugs. Meanwhile, another recently published meta-analysis has taken careful steps to overcome methodological limitations in previous work and found only modest evidence of neurotoxicity [167]. We have carefully considered the risks of such neurotoxicity and conclude that they are minimal in this study. This conclusion is supported by [CONTACT_62866][INVESTIGATOR_194919]. More information on the potential neurotoxicity of MDMA can be found in the IB.   7.2.[ADDRESS_988440] exhibits any signs of toxicity or clinically significant dilutional hyponatremia despi[INVESTIGATOR_723916], they will not be given another experimental session unless it is approved by [CONTACT_150894], PI [INVESTIGATOR_117404].    7.3 Abuse Liability  Findings in humans and animals suggests that MDMA possesses moderate abuse potential that is higher than that reported for “classic hallucinogens,” like psilocybin, but lower than that reported for psychostimulants, such as cocaine or methamphetamine. More information on abuse liability is provided in the IB.  To ensure MDMA-assisted psychotherapy does not cause patients to develop symptoms of drug abuse after the treatment period of the study, drug use is monitored during the long-term follow-up. Based on long-term follow-up data from two sponsor-supported studies (N=32), only one subject took Ecstasy after completing the study and failed to reproduce the experience from the study and a number of subjects volunteered that they would never seek out Ecstasy outside a legal, controlled, therapeutic setting. In addition, negative results from MDMA-specific drug testing data obtained from the Swiss study MP-2 (N=12) supports that none of these subjects took Ecstasy outside of the study during the long-term follow-up period.    Diversion is not an issue in this protocol because MDMA will only be administered in a controlled environment under the supervision of the CI and no take-home doses will be permitted.  MDMA will be handled following all regulations pertaining to the handling and dispensing of controlled substances within research studies.  8.0 Adverse Events   8.1 Adverse Events  An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a clinical research study subject, including any abnormal sign (e.g. abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the subject’s involvement in the research, whether or not considered related to participation in the research. This definition includes concurrent illnesses or injuries and exacerbation of pre-existing conditions.   An unexpected adverse event is one that is not listed in the current IB or an event that is by [CONTACT_29288] a listed event.  All AEs will be monitored by [CONTACT_38802][INVESTIGATOR_404752], if the AE becomes chronic, a cause can be identified.  If an AE is unresolved at the conclusion of the protocol, a clinical assessment will be made by [CONTACT_150914]/or Medical Monitor as to whether continued follow-up of the AE is warranted.

Adverse events that will be collected for the duration of the protocol are:  • All SAEs will be collected through subject termination. • All spontaneously reported reactions will be collected on the day of drug administration and for seven days after each experimental session or until they resolve. All reported reactions will be actively followed until they resolve.  • Any reported reactions still above the subject’s baseline level of severity after seven days will be classified as Adverse Events and tracked in the AE log.  • All AEs (defined as any adverse event that is not enumerated in the list of commonly reported reactions) will be collected from enrollment through the subject’s last one-month follow-up. All adverse events will be actively followed until they resolve. • Events related to planned treatments or physician visits for baseline conditions collected in the medical history will not be collected, unless there is an exacerbation of the condition, in which case they will be actively followed until resolution. • Any AE leading to withdrawal from the protocol will be collected throughout the study. • All AEs related to changes in psychiatric status will be collected throughout the study and will be actively followed until resolution.

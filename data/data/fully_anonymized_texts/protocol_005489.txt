PROTOCOL TITLE  An Open -Label  Study to Assess the Long -term Safety of AXS -07 (meloxicam and rizatriptan) for 
the Acute Treatment of Migraine in Adults.  
INDICATION  Acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults . 
OBJECTIVES Primary Objective:  
To evaluate the long term safety of chronic intermittent use of AXS -07. 
Secondary Objectives:  
To assess the effect of AXS- [ADDRESS_134591] participated in a prior  AXS -07 study for the acute 
treatment of migraine  with no significant changes in medical history since participation . Subjects 
who meet all eligibility criteria will  be enrolled at Visit  1 and will be dispensed AXS -07 for at -home 
treatment of migraine attacks.  Subjects will be instructed to treat each migraine attack with AXS -
07 and return for clinic visits at Months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 (5 return visits).   
 
Migraine Headache Diary  
For the first [ADDRESS_134592] their headache pain  intensity (measured by a 
4-point rating scale; 0-none, 1-mild, 2-moderate, or 3-severe),  in the Migraine Headache  Diary  
immediately  prior  to taking  study  medication,  and at the following time points after taking study 
medication: [ADDRESS_134593] bothersome 
symptom (nausea, photophobia, phonophobia) and assess the presence or absence of each symptom 
at the following timepoints: [ADDRESS_134594] will be instructed to report any adverse events which occur following each dose of AXS -
07.  Use of rescue medications will also be recorded.  All migraines which occur during the course 
of the study, regardless of treatment with study drug or not, will be recorded in the Migraine 
Headache Log . 
 
Study Visits  
Subjects will come to the clinic for the enrollment visit (Visit 1, Day 1), Month 1, Month 3, Month 
6, Month 9, and Month 12. At each in clinic study visit, the subject will undergo the following safety 
assessments: assessment of adverse ev ents, review of concomitant medications, vital signs, urine 
pregnancy test (if applicable), clinical laboratory tests and an electrocardiogram.  Additionally, the 
following patient- reported scales will be completed  at every visit :  Headache Impact Test- 6 (HIT -
6), Migraine Disability Assessment Score (MIDAS , not conducted at Month 1 ), and Migraine -
Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire (MSQ) .

Version Date : Amendment 2, Oct [ADDRESS_134595] 
100 subjects that complete the Month 12 visit, treating a minimum of 2 migraines a month. At that 
time, all remaining uncompleted subjects  (those  in various interim visits of the study) will be 
scheduled to come to the site to complete  the Mon th 12 visit procedures.  These subjects  are 
considered completing the study.  
STUDY ENTRY CRITERIA  Inclusion criteria:  
A subject will be eligible for study participation if the subject meets all of the following criteria:  
1. Is male or female 18 to 65 years o f age inclusive.  
2. Is willing and able to provide written informed consent to participate in the study, and willing and able to understand and comply with the procedures and study requirements.  
3. Participated in  a prior study with  AXS -07 for the acute treatmen t of migraine . 
4. If female, is either not of childbearing potential (defined as postmenopausal for at least 1 
year or surgically sterile [bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or 
hysterectomy]); or is nonlactating and nonpregnant (has negative pr egnancy test results at 
Day 1), does not plan to get pregnant during the study or for at least one month after, and 
is using a reliable method of contraception, before study drug. administration and for the 
duration of the trial. Reliable methods of contra ception include hormonal, double -barrier 
methods (e.g., condom and diaphragm, condom and foam, condom and sponge, each with 
spermicidal jellies or cream) , abstinence, vasectomized partners  and intrauterine devices.  
5. Is willing and able to complete the Migra ine Headache Diary.  
Exclusion criteria : 
A subject will be excluded from the study if the subject meets any of the following criteria:  
1. Significant change in medical history or concomitant medications since enrolling in the 
prior AXS -07 study.  
2. Initiation of or a change in concomitant medication to reduce the frequency of migraine 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_120320] -07 study . 
3. Is considered by [CONTACT_093], for any reason (including, but not limited to, the risks described as precautions, warnings, and contraindications in the current version of the 
investigator’s brochure f or AXS -07 tablets), to be an unsuitable candidate to receive AXS -
07. 
4. Is currently receiving propranolol  or has received propranolol within [ADDRESS_134596]  AXS -07 (20 mg meloxicam/10 mg rizatriptan)  tablet for oral administration.  
TREATMENT 
REGIMENS  AXS -07 is to be taken orally with water at the onset of a migraine attack.

INVESTIGATOR  [INVESTIGATOR_104189]- center  
PLANNED STUDY SITES  Up to  approximately 80 study sites in North America  
CRITERIA FOR 
EVALUATION  Primary Outcome Measures  
• The primary safety outcome  is long -term safety as evaluated  by [CONTACT_5205] , severity, 
and relatedness  of AEs following dosing with AXS -07. 
Efficacy Outcome Measures  
• Proportion of subjects with headache pain freedom at Hour 2, with headache pain 
freedom defined as pain intensity =  none.  
• Proportion of subjects with absence of the most bothersome symptom (MBS; nausea, 
photophobia, or phonophobia) at Hour 2, with the MBS defined at the onset of migraine, 
prior to drug administration.

• Sustained headache pain freedom between Hours 2 and 24, defined as having no 
headache pain at Hour 2, with no use of rescue medication and no relapse of headache pain through Hour 24.

STATISTICAL 
METHODS Analysis Populations:  
The following analysis populations are planned for this study:  
• Safety Population: The Safety Population will include all subjects who take at le ast one 
dose study medication.  
• Intent -to-treat (ITT ) Population:  The ITT Population will include all subjects who take 
at least one dose of study medication and report at least one efficacy measurement.  
Descriptive statistics will be used for all variables and all data over time . 
SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION  To assess for long -term safety, t his study will enroll enough subjects to ensure that [ADDRESS_134597] 2 migraines a month .  Up to 8 75 
subjects may  be enrolled to achieve this sample size.   
STUDY AND TREATMENT DURATION  The duration of participation will be up to 12 months.  Subjects will be allowed to treat each migraine 
with AXS -07 for up to the 12 months following enrollment.  Up to  six planned study visits will

A)  Pharmacokinetics  
Each subject will be his/her own control  (pre-dose blood 
sample) and each subject will sign an institutional review board –
approved consent form explaining the purpose, nature, risks, 
benefits, and duration of the study. The study will be conducted 
in accordance with good clinical practice guidelines and with the 
ethical  principles originating in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
The subject’s skin in the area of application will be relatively free 
of hair before patch  and topi[INVESTIGATOR_507698]. For each 
treatment , the patch /solution  will be applied to a previously 
unused application site. Blood samples (approximately 5 mL  (1 
tsp) each) will be drawn in BD vacutainer  tubes .  On Procedure 
Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5  and 6, blood samples will be obtained as 
follows:  
• Within 60  min pre -patch/solution  application and then up to

patch/solution  removal.   No blood samples will be obtained 
during  Procedure Days 7, 8 and 9. 
 B)  Residual Drug Analysis of Diclofenac Patches  
In conjunction with the above described study residual drug 
analysis will also be conducted for the previously worn Flector® 
patches  and patch pi[INVESTIGATOR_507699] 1 -3.    
• Prior to administration to the subject as described in Part A, 
the patches  will be weighed and the weight recorded.  
• The pouch, release liner and all items coming into contact 
[CONTACT_507721]  (gloves, forceps, etc.) to be applied in Part 
A will be retained for analysis.    
• The used patches  will be retained for drug content anal ysis.

PK and TS of Diclofenac Dermal Products  Version 11.0; June 7, [ADDRESS_655064]  is to investigate  the development of appropriate methods to 
determine  the in vitro/in vivo correlation (IVIVC) of drug absorption from dermal  
products, which has represented a longstanding challenge. The model drug for this 
study is diclofenac, which is available in two different formulations, patch and topi[INVESTIGATOR_507700], approved by [CONTACT_312173].  This healthy hum an subject study will 
provide the carefully designed protocols and data for direct comparison (IVIVC) with an 
in vitro human skin diffusion study model.  Generic drugs are approved based upon 
bioequivalence (BE) testing, and w ith respect to oral drug delivery, the accepted BE 
approach is relative ly straightforward and is principally based on matching blood level 
profiles. In some cases, in vitro dissolution tests can be done to help determine the 
bioequivalence of an oral dosage form.  For topi[INVESTIGATOR_507701], 
with the exception of corticosteroids  and a few other products , a comparative clinical 
endpoint study is often necessary for approval of a generic product or for replacement of 
an approved dermatological drug product with one that has major  changes. Comparative 
clinical trials are relatively insensitive, time -consuming and costly .  It is especially difficult  
to gain the adequate statistical power needed to evaluate bioequivalence in some 
dermatological conditions, and can require a large number (i.e., hundreds1,2) of subjects.  
This study supports FDA’s continuing effort to identify the most accurate, sensitive, 
reproducible and e fficient methods to evaluate topi[INVESTIGATOR_312168] .  
In 1998, the FDA issued draft guidance for the dermatopharmacokinetics ( DPK) method 
to assess the bioequivalence of topi[INVESTIGATOR_507702]3. The 
approach req uired quantification of the total amount of drug in the stratum corneum  
(SC) as a function of time, akin to the typi[INVESTIGATOR_507703] -time profiles of traditional PK 
studies using blood sampling. Tape -strippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], a technique that involves multiple 
applicat ions and removal of individual pi[INVESTIGATOR_507704] a formulation -treated area of the 
skin of a healthy human subject, is the biosampling method used in TS to remove layers 
of the SC in serial.  The draft guidance was withdrawn in 2002 following the inconsistent 
results of two studies4. The lack of agreement in the results prompted concern about 
both the reproducibility and the adequacy of this method to assess drugs whose target 
site is beyond the SC.  
Considerable subsequent effort was directed at identifi cation of problems/limitations of 
the original TS protocol and development of an improved procedure to generate 
reproducible data of much higher quality5,6.   
The end product of this research was a relatively straightforward method that examines 
only one uptake and one elimination time per fo rmulation. This allows replicate sites to 
PK and TS of Diclofenac Dermal Products  Version 11.0; June 7, 2019

8 be studied, and higher statistical power to be achieved with fewer volunteers. No tapes 
are discarded, but tapes are combined and extracted in groups to achieve high 
concentrations for analysis. The total amount of  drug in the SC is measured for each 
site, and the ratios of these quantities for a  reference listed drug  (RLD) and test 
formulations can then be compared in the usual “80:125” area under the curve 
bioequivalence fashion .  The method has been successively applied retrospectively to 
the comparison of retinoid gels and prospectively to the analysis of DPK data obtained 
for [ADDRESS_655065], repr esent suitable in vivo information for comparison and 
correlation with in vitro skin penetra tion. This study will evaluate  two commercially 
available products; Flector® (diclofenac  1.3% patch ) and Pennsaid® 2% diclofenac 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_507705].  One uptake/absorption TS time 
point sample will be obtained , and two clearance time points will be obtained .  Important 
systemic pharmacokinetic data in the form of blood drug levels will also be gathered 
during an identica l protocol of absorption and clearance phase, in order to be able to 
cross compare all three methods, in vivo systemic PK, in vivo TS, and in vitro 
permeation techniques for thorough IVIVC.  The diclofenac patch and topi[INVESTIGATOR_507706] . Upon completion of this in vivo study, skin 
and blood diclofenac levels obtained after application of each product will be coupled 
with in vitro data generated in our laboratory at UMSOP to develop IVIVC models. These 
models would help in predicting in vivo skin and blood diclofenac levels from in vitro 
studies.   The measurement of blood drug levels is the gold standard test for evaluation 
of phar macokinetic parameters  for systemically acting products .  The systemic blood 
levels measured in this study will allow us to evaluate  the TS and in vitro studies, as 
these latter two methods are currently not accepted as regulatory standard of practice.   
Some topi[INVESTIGATOR_507707], so in that 
case, future surrogate methods for clinical endpoint studies may be using TS or in vitro 
studies.   The diclofenac product has systemic absorption to allow us to validate the t wo 
non-standard techniques.  
 
2.2 Rationale  
The goal of this study is to help establish more efficient pathways for approval of topi[INVESTIGATOR_507708]. This study with Flector® 
(diclofenac epolamine 1.3 %) topi[INVESTIGATOR_507709]® (diclofenac sodium 2 %) topi[INVESTIGATOR_507710]. Th e systemic concentration  will be compared with the local 
bioavailability of diclofenac  in the skin using th e products, measured by [CONTACT_507723]. The same products  will also be 
studied (under a parallel but separate in vitro study protocol) using an in vitro permeation 
test (IVPT) model with excised human ski n which has demonstrated IVIVC in previous 
PK and TS of Diclofenac Dermal Products  Version 11.0; June 7, 2019

9 studies. This research will help establish whether the IVPT model correlates with and is 
predictive of in vivo bioavailabil ity, and whether IVPT and/or  in vivo  TS can be utilized as 
part of a collective weight -of-evidence approach to support an approval pathway for 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_312163].  
 
The multi -dimensional design of the current study minimizes the human subject research 
that would otherwise be expanded by [CONTACT_507724] s local and systemic bioavailability, all of which can be now be directly compared in 
this study to support multiple, inter -relate d in vivo analyses relating to the bioavailability 
and bioequivalence.  These coordinated evaluations also collectively provid e the in vivo 
reference datasets that are needed to establish IVIVC for the IVPT model which may then 
be utilized to support a new pathway for approval of numerous topi[INVESTIGATOR_507711].

10 3 OBJECTIVES  
3.1 Study Objectives  
1)  G enerate human PK data for the purpose of establishing an IVIVC  model by 
[CONTACT_507725] :  Flector® 1.3% 
diclofenac epolamine  patches and Pennsaid® 2% diclofenac sodium topi[INVESTIGATOR_166461] . 
 
2)  Generate TS data for the purpose of establishing a fundamental IVIVC model by 
[CONTACT_507726] :  Flector® 1.3% diclofenac epolamine patches and Pennsaid® 2% 
diclofenac sodium topi[INVESTIGATOR_166461] . 
   
3.2 Study Outcome Measures  
For the TS study the main outcome measure is the ratio of clearance and uptake of 
diclofenac drug concentrations for each diclofenac formulation. For the PK study t he 
main outcome measure is the maximum serum  concentration (C max); time of maximum 
serum  concentration (T max) of diclofenac  and area under the curve (AUC) attained from 
Flector® 1.3% diclofenac epolamine patches and Pennsaid® 2% diclofenac sodium 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_166461] .  In addition, the residual drug content from worn Flecto r® patches will be 
determined in order to attempt to estimate total amount of absorbed diclofenac .

PK and TS of Diclofenac Dermal Products  Version 11.0; June 7, [ADDRESS_655081] the null 
hypothesis (H 0) that the mean clearance/uptake diclofenac  amount ratio, and the PK 
parameters (C max and AUC) between these products are different (i.e., outside the 80 –
125% range).  
7.[ADDRESS_655082]. Blood samples (approximately 5 mL (1 tsp)) will be collected during Study 
Session [ADDRESS_655083] -patch application. Blood samples (approximately 5 mL (1 
tsp)) will be collected during Study Session [ADDRESS_655084] -solution application.   After the PK 
study , TS study  will be conducted at  10 h [patches] and 6 h [solution]  (skin drug 
uptake /absorption ), 27 h [patches] and 23 h [solution] (skin drug clearance), and 51 h 
[patches] and  47 h [solution]  (skin drug clearance)  post product  application.  Non 
compartmental  analyses (NCA) will be conducted to estimate the  PK parameters such 
as: maximum serum  concentration (C max); apparent elimination rate constant (k); 
apparent half -life (t 1/2), calculated as 0.693/k; AUC 0-last of the serum  concentration –time 
determined by [CONTACT_507731]; and AUC value extrapolated to infinity 
(AUC inf), calculated as the sum of AUC 0-last and the area extrapolated to infinity: AUC inf = 
AUC 0-last + C last/k where C last would be the last quantifiable concentration. All NCA 
analyses will be conduc ted using Phoenix® WinNonlin® 6.4 (Pharsight, a Certara 
Company, CA).  
7.3 Final Analysis Plan  
An objective of this study is to determine PK parameters (C max, AUC and ratio of SC 
drug concentration during uptake and clearance) of diclofenac  in healthy adults and TS 
data after using Flector® (diclofenac  epolamine 1.3 % patch ) and Pennsaid® (2% 
diclofenac  sodium  topi[INVESTIGATOR_166461] ) for the purpose of IVIVC  by [CONTACT_507732] .

19 Analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by [CONTACT_447] -hoc Bonferroni test will be used for 
comparing the differences in the means of the PK parameters and significant differences 
will be declared at p<0.0 5. The statistical comparisons will be conducted as follow:  
 
If diclofenac  PK concentrations are found to be non -normally distributed, then we will 
examine Box -Cox transformations (e.g., log, square -root, etc.) that can achieve 
normality. If no transformat ion can achieve normality, then will use permutation tests to 
compute empi[INVESTIGATOR_10477] p-values, and will use the bootstrap to compute standard errors and 
confidence intervals that account for within -person correlation.  
  
IVIVC will be conducted comparing PK parameters and profiles to predicted PK 
parameters and profiles using IVPT and  in vitro  TS results.  Multiple methods will be 
implemented to develop an IVIVC.  The first method is to compare the steady state 
concentrations.  The predicted stea dy state concentration using IVPT data will employ 
the following formula:  
𝐶𝑠𝑠=𝐽𝑠𝑠 ∗𝐴
𝐶𝐿 
 
The second method will compare the PK profiles of the clinical and IVPT study by 
[CONTACT_507733].   The third method will be to determine and compare resid ual 
patch analysis between in vitro  and in vivo .    
 
In terms of developi[INVESTIGATOR_507720] a comparison will be made between in 
vitro and in vivo  uptake  (absorption)  and clearance diclofenac  amounts.  The second 
method is to compare the clearanc e to uptake diclofenac  amount ratio between  in vitro 
and in vivo .

11/05/[ADDRESS_848431] of prophylactic fentanyl pectin nasal spray (FPNS) on the 
intensity of exercise -induced  breakthrough dyspnea  (numeric rating scale, 
adjusted for distance walked) between the first and second  [ADDRESS_848432] feared symptoms among cancer patients, occurring 
in up to 70% of patients in the last 6  weeks of life (Ben-Aharon et al. 2008 ). Dyspnea is 
associated with fatigue, anxiety, decreased function and quality of life, and increased 
mortality (Hauser et al. 2006 , Maltoni et al. 2005 ). 
 
In a study examining 70 patients with dyspnea, 43 (61%) reported breakthrough 
(epi[INVESTIGATOR_496573]) dyspnea only, 13 (19%) had constant dyspnea only, and 14 
(20%) experienced both con stant and breakthrough dyspnea. A substantial proportion 
of the patients with breakthrough dyspnea (18/57, 32%) presented with 5 or more 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_914], and the majority of epi[INVESTIGATOR_360470] <10 minutes (Reddy  et al. 2009 ). 
Breakthrough dyspnea is particularly challenging to  treat because of its transient and 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_496574].  
 
Exercise -induced dyspnea (or shortness of breath on exertion) is a subtype of 
breakthrough dyspnea. This is similar to incident pain (on ambulation) which is a 
subtype of breakthrough pain. Breakthrough  dyspnea has 4 major triggers: exertion, 
emotional changes, the environment (e.g. altitude, smog), and spontaneous/idiopathic. 
Because many cancer patients experience severe shortness of breath with activities 
(i.e. walking), they have to limit their funct ion significantly. In a recent study conducted 
 2012-1169  
11/05/[ADDRESS_848433] majority of patients (81%) had breakthrough 
dyspnea. Specifically, dyspnea affects patients’ general activity, walking ability, normal 
work, sleep, mood, relations with other s, and enjoyment of life (Reddy  et al.  2009 ).  
 
B.2. The Current Management of Dyspnea . The current management of dyspnea 
involves treatment of any reversible causes and supportive measures to minimize the 
sensation of dyspnea, including treatments such as oxygen, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], bronchodilators, 
and corticosteroids (Ben-Aharon  et al.  2008 , Cranston  et al. 2008 , Jennings  et al. 2002 ). 
A majority of the stu dies on cancer -related dyspnea so far have focused on patients 
with dyspnea at rest. In a crossover randomized controlled trial, Bruera et al. compared 
subcutaneous morphine and placebo in [ADDRESS_848434]. Subcutane ous morphine was found to be superior to placebo for relief 
of dyspnea (Bruera  et al. 1993 ). This finding was replicated by [CONTACT_635077]. in 
another randomized controlled trial with similar design (Mazzocato  et al. 1999 ). A 
Cochrane meta -analysis also showed  a statistically significant positive effect of opi[INVESTIGATOR_496575] (p=0.0008),  supporting the use of oral or parenteral 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_635063] (Jennings  et al.  
2002 ). 
 
Although systemic opi[INVESTIGATOR_635064], there are 
currently no evidence -based options for breakthrough dyspnea. In a case series, Bruera 
et al. reported the use of rescue morphine given subcutaneously for 312 epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] o f 
breakthrough dyspnea in 45 cancer patients. After 30 minutes, 90% reported no to mild 
dyspnea (Bruera  et al.  1993 ). Based on this study, most clinicians use a dose similar to 
the rescue opi[INVESTIGATOR_635065] (i.e. 10 -20% of total daily dose) to manage 
breakthrough dyspnea. However, a more recent double -blind randomized controlled trial 
comparing systemic f entanyl (oral or subcutaneous (SC)), nebulized fentanyl, and 
nebulized saline for breakthrough dyspnea found no significant difference in dyspnea 
relief at 10 minutes between the treatment arms (Charles  et al. 2008 ). One of the 
reasons may be due to the short duration for the primary endpoint (10 minutes). T o 
date, the evidence for opi[INVESTIGATOR_635066] (Table 1). 
Further research is necessary to improve the management of this distressing and 
debilitating symptom.

Administration of opi[INVESTIGATOR_635071], although many patients do not have access to these rout es at home. Fentanyl is a 
highly lipophilic compound. Over the past decade, there has been active development 
of fentanyl, including delivery by [CONTACT_496600] (oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate 
[OTFC], Actiq), buccal (Fentora) and intranasal (Lazanda, Instanyl) formulations 
(Gordon and Schro eder 2008 , Lecybyl and Hanna 2007 ). These fentanyl formulations 
have been successfully used to manage breakthrough pain (Christie  et al. 1998 , Coluzzi  
et al. 2001 , Fallon  et al. 2011 , Farrar  et al. 1998 , Mercadante  et al. 2007 , Portenoy  et al. 
1999 , Portenoy  et al. 2006 , Portenoy  et al. 2010 , Slatkin  et al. 2007 ), although their role 
in breakthrough dyspnea has only been reported in a handful of studies. Two small 
retrospective case series reported on the use of transmucosal and intranasal fentanyl 
(Benitez -Rosario  et al. 2005 , Sitte and Bausewein 2008 ) and one prospective series 
examined the use of OTFC (Gauna  et al. 2008 ) suggest significant improvement in 
breakthrough dyspnea with these agents. Randomized controlled trials are urgently 
needed to confirm these find ings with rapid onset opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], which could potentially open 
up a new therapeutic indication for these medications.  
 
FPNS is a particularly attractive option for breakthrough dyspnea. It was approved by 
[CONTACT_635078] (FDA)  in 2011 fo r breakthrough pain in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -
tolerant patients with cancer, and represents an alternative delivery system for fentanyl 
in addition to the transdermal, parenteral, and transmucosal routes. Pharmacokinetic 
studies revealed that FPNS has a bioavailability of  approximately 80% (Fisher et al. 
2010, Fisher et al. 2010 ). The time to maximal effect (Tmax ) was between 15 -20 
minutes  (Fisher et al. 2010 , Fisher et al. 2010 ).  FPNS has been found in clinical tria ls 
to provide greater and more rapid pain relief and reduces pain better than placebo 
(Kress et al. 2009 ) and transmucosal fentanyl citrate (Mercadante et al. 2009 ).

C. Experimental Approach  
C.1. Overall Study design. This is an 
investigator initiated study supported in 
part by  [CONTACT_388612], Inc .  We propose a 2 -
arm, double blind, parallel randomized 
controlled trial of FPNS and placebo for 
cancer patients with breakthrough 
dyspnea (Figure 1). The main goal of this 
study is to determine the effect size for 
both FPNS and placebo arm to  inform a 
larger, adequately powered confirmatory 
randomized controlled trial. After study 
consent, eligible patients will be asked to 
complete a number of surveys and a [ADDRESS_848435] 20 minutes after repeating the 
same dose of either FPNS or placebo 
(with at least [ADDRESS_848436] 
and second dose).  This design will allow testing of both single and repeated dosing on 
dyspnea under a double blind design.  
 
Based on our experience conducting symptom control trials, this study  will take between 
1.5-2 hours to complete on a single visit.  We believe this study design is feasible and 
would not add undue burden for patients. Patients will be compensated with a $[ADDRESS_848437] for their time and effort.  
 
C.2. Eligibility Criteria.  The eligibility criteria are shown in Table 2.  
Table 2. Study Eligibility Criteria  

 2012-1169  
11/05/[ADDRESS_848438] at the time of enrollment (i.e. 0 -3, 4-
6). Biostatistics will set up a Randomization website. Investigational Pharmacy 
personnel will perform the randomization assignment.  
C.5. Blinding.  Both patients and the rese arch staff conducting the assessment will be 
blinded to the treatment assignment.  FPNS will be dispensed by [CONTACT_635079].  Placebo will be identical in appearance to the FPNS.  
C.6. Research staff.  An orientation will be held with res earch staff involved in this study 
to introduce them with the study design, and standardize the provision of each 
intervention.   
C.7. Study Interventions. The supply of study medication (both FPNS and placebo) 
will be provided by [CONTACT_388612], Inc .  FPNS is FDA approved (NDA 022569/S -007) for 
treatment of breakthrough cancer pain in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -tolerant patients. Immediately upon 
patient enrollment, the study physician will be notified and will determine the  morphine 
equivalent daily dose (MEDD) in real ti me using standardized equianalgesic ratios.  Inclusion Criteria  
1. Diagnosis of cancer  
2. Breakthrough dyspnea, defined in this study as dyspnea on exertion with an average intensity level 
>=3/10 on the numeric rating scale  
3. Outpatient at MD Anderson Cancer Center seen by [CONTACT_635080]  
4. Ambulatory and able to walk with or without walking aid  
5. On strong opi[INVESTIGATOR_635072] 80 -500 mg, with stable (i.e. +/ - 30%)  
regular dose over the last 24 hours  
6. Karnofsky performance status >=50%  
7. Age [ADDRESS_848439] >=7/10 at the time of enrollment  
2. Supplemental oxygen requirement >6 L per minute  
3. Delirium (i.e. Memorial delirium rating scale >13)  
4. History of unstable angina or myocardial infarction 1 month prior to study enrollment  
5. Resting heart rate >120 at the time of study enrollment  
6. Systolic pressure >180 mmHg or diastolic pressure >[ADDRESS_848440] no evidence of disease

Based on clinical practice and similarly to the dose used for breakthrough pain, we will 
use an FPNS dose equivalent to 15 -25% of the MEDD (Table 3).  For patients 
randomized to receive FPNS, the study medicatio n will be provided by [CONTACT_635081] [ADDRESS_848441]. We estimated the 
FPNS dose based on the following assumptions:  
 A rescue dose of 15 -25% of the MEDD is safe and adequate for relief of dyspnea 
(Bruera  et al.  1993 , Charles  et al.  2008 ). 
 FPNS has approximately 80% oral bioavailability (Fisher  et al.  2010 , Fisher  et al.  
2010 ).  
 With repeat dosing 30 minutes apart, the maximum concentration (Cmax) for FPNS 
is approximately 1.6x h igher than the first dose.  
 
The modeled pharmacokinetic data for repeated dosing [ADDRESS_848442] walk before leaving MD Anderson.  At th e end of 1 hour, they will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_635082].  If excessive drowsiness or 
adverse events occur, the study physician will assess the patients.

patients will be advised to avoid using breakthrough opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (for any reason) or 
bronchodilators for at least 2 hours prior to and during the study.  
C.9. The 6 -minute walk tests will be conducted based on guidelines from the American 
Thoracic Society (Laboratories 2002 ).  Walking aid and supplemental oxygen via nasal 
prongs are allowed as long as patients keep them the same as before enrollment and 
during the entire study.  This walking test allows patients to rest if they need to, and is 
highly acceptable to patients.  It provides important information regarding patients’ 
functional status, exercise capacity, and health -related quality of life (Guyatt  et al. 1985 , 
Guyatt  et al. 1985 ).  Before and after each test, we will be assessing the (1)  dyspnea 
level with numeric rating scale and Borg scale, and the  (2) respi[INVESTIGATOR_184013].  After each test, we will also be assessing (1) the distance walked at the end 
of each minute or portion of, (2) the total walking time, (3) the level of dyspnea at the 
end of each minute or portion of (NRS and Borg scale), and (4) the average walking 
speed.  
 The [ADDRESS_848444] has excellent short term reproducibility (Guyatt  et al.  1985 ), 
as well as good face, construct, and predictive validity (Du Bois  et al. 2011 ), and 
changes in this test are concordant with changes in symptoms and mortality (Olsson  et 
al. 2005 ).  The minimal clinical significant difference is found to be 24 -45 m for patients 
with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (Du Bois  et al.  2011 ), and [ADDRESS_848445] was designed  to provide important information regarding 
a patient’s level of dyspnea on exertion, and to facilitate intra -individual comparison 
since there is significant variability in the expression of dyspnea among patients.  
 2012-1169  
11/05/[ADDRESS_848446] would depend on when they return to 
baseline level of dyspnea numeric rating score + 1 or below (e.g. if baseline dyspnea = 
4, they need to return to a leve l of 5 or less to qualify for next stage). During this rest 
period, patients will be assessed every [ADDRESS_848447] 
pain, severe leg cramps, staggering, diaphoresis, and/or dizziness, they will be asked to 
stop the study.  If patients requir e more than [ADDRESS_848448] Pre

average dyspnea in last [ADDRESS_848452] few days (Tanaka  et al. 2000 ). Each item has a score between 1 and 5, 
for a maximum of 60 . There are sub -scores for sense of effort, anxiety, and discomfort.  
7 a 0 (no dyspnea) to 10 (worst dyspnea) categorical scale validated for rating the severity of 
dyspnea (Dorman  et al. 2007 , Gift and Narsavage 1998 , Powers and Bennett 1999 ).  We will be 
measuring it every minute during the [ADDRESS_848453] at 0, 1  min, 2 min, 3 min, 4 min, 5 min 
and 6 min (or end of walk).  
8 a 0 to 10 categorical scale for rating the severity of dyspnea. It is a ratio scale with descriptive 
anchors throughout the range in which a rating of 8 signifies breathlessness twice as severe  as 
4, which in turn is twice as severe as 2 (Dorman  et al.  2007 , Gift and Narsavage 1998 , Kendrick  
et al. 2000 , Powers and Bennett 1999 ).  We will be measuring it  0 and 6 min (or end of walk) of 
each walk. The NRS will be administered before modified Borg scale.

11 patients will be asked to do finger tappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 10 and 30 sec, arithmetic, reverse memory of digits, 
and visual memory).  This has been used in other studies by [CONTACT_27156]. (Bruera  et al. 1992 ) 
12 patients will be asked about their dyspnea (worse, about the same, or better) comparing 
between the level of dyspnea between the first and second 6 -minute walk tests (Guyatt  et al. 
1993 , Redelmeier  et al. 1996 ). 
13 blinding will be done by [CONTACT_635083]: “FPNS”, 
“placebo”, or “do not know”.  
14 study satisfaction is assessed with the following questions, “Was it worthwhile for you to 
participate in this research study?”, “If you had to do it over, would you participate in this 
research study again?”, “Would you recommend participating in this research study to others?”, 
“Did you quality of life get better by [CONTACT_121091] s tudy?”, “Did you quality of life 
get worse by [CONTACT_422221]?”

confidentiality will be ensured by [CONTACT_496608] , secure storage of clinical data, 
and anonymous reporting.  
 
D. Statistical Analysis  
D.1. Sample Size Calculation.  Patients who have started  the second walk te st will be 
considered evaluable for this study’s primary endpoint. 10 evaluable patients in the 
fentanyl arm provides 80% power to detect an effect size as small as 1.0 when 
alpha=5% using a two -sided paired t -test to compare dyspnea between the first and 
second walk tests.  Results from this study will be used to calculate the sample size for 
an adequately powered randomized controlled trial.  
 
D.2. Data Analysis. Summary descriptive statistics will be provided for demographics, 
outcomes, and other collect ed variables and will include proportions, medians, means, 
95% confidence intervals, and other simple statistics as appropriate for the measure.  
Comparisons within arms will be performed using paired t -tests or signed rank tests.   
 
E. Data Confidentialit y Procedures  
Health information will be protected and we will maintain the confidentiality of the data 
obtained from the patient's chart.   
 Collection of identifiers: We will collect and securely store patients' identifiers 
(including name, medical record  number and demographic specifications).  Each patient 
will be assigned a study number that will be the only identifier to figure in the analytical 
file and personal data will not be disclosed in any form. The key linking these numbers 
will be retained in a securely locked file by [CONTACT_093].  
 Data Storage: Protection of electronic and paper records will be guaranteed. All 
electronic records will be stored on password -protected institution computers behind the 
institution firewall.  Any paper records will be classified and stored in locked files inside 
a locked office.  
 Training of personnel: Only MDACC personnel trained in maintaining confidentiality, 
the principle investigators and co -investigators, will have access to study records.  
 Data sharing: S tudy data will not be shared with any individuals or entities. The data 
will be kept by [CONTACT_635085] a locked file cabinet.  
 Final disposition of study records: These data will be used only for this research 
study data files will be destro yed 5 years after publication of the findings.

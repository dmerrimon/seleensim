Hypotheses and Specific Aims:   An increasing number of children with complex chronic conditions (CCCs) who have intractable illnesses or multi-organ dysfunction are exposed to daily polypharmacy.1-3 Parents of children with polypharmacy often administer 5 or more medications each day, sometimes for months1, including high-risk medications prescribed by [CONTACT_703799].4,5 While medications can be life-saving, polypharmacy increases the risk of additive adverse effects6, drug-drug interactions2,3, and can lead to serious adverse drug events (ADEs). Pediatric ADEs result in over 4.3 million estimated ambulatory visits annually7, including >150,[ADDRESS_955638] on the health of children. Thus, we propose the following specific aims, specifically focusing on the high-risk population of children with NI and polypharmacy:  Aim 1: Conduct cross-sectional parent-reported symptom assessments (PRSA): In a clinic population of 300 children, we will administer an electronic validated symptom inventory to parents to advance our understanding of signal-to-noise and signal detection challenges in this population.  Hypothesis 1a: Patients with higher level of polypharmacy have greater symptom diversity and intensity.  Hypothesis 1b: Parent reports will identify more symptoms than concurrent medical record notes.  Aim 2: Conduct a prospective cohort study to quantify the detection of known ADEs using PRSA: We will follow [ADDRESS_955639] medication changes (empaneled in Aim 1) and assess whether using PRSA prior to and after specific medication changes detects known and expected side effects.  Hypothesis 2: Known anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_703778]-person symptom changes following an anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_703779] a new drug start or a substantial dosage increase.  II. Background and Significance:   In 2010, more than 263 million outpatient prescriptions were dispensed to pediatric patients in the [LOCATION_002].9 According to the Institute of Medicine report “Preventing Medication Errors,” the outpatient “environment in particular should be a high priority [for medication safety] given the growing reliance on home care for increasingly complex [pediatric] medical conditions.”10 Children with complex chronic conditions (CCCs), such as intractable epi[INVESTIGATOR_703780], rely on multiple medications to sustain their lives.11 Children with CCCs, who comprise 
Protocol Template Page 2 CF-146, Effective 7/10/11  <5% of the pediatric population but are responsible for 40% of costs associated with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]12 are frequently exposed to daily polypharmacy.1-3,11 Children with polypharmacy may take >[ADDRESS_955640] multiple CCCs and technology-dependence, often with neurological impairment (NI), that makes self-report of adverse symptoms unreliable.[ADDRESS_955641] has prioritized the need for further study of outcome measures of drug safety and efficacy in children with intellectual and developmental disabilities.15  Our scientific premise, that the successful use of medications in children is not without risk, is rooted in our prior research. Polypharmacy poses significant problems. Our prior work has demonstrated that polypharmacy increases the risk of additive side effects2,6 and significant potential drug-drug interactions (Figure 1),1-3,13 and can lead to serious adverse drug events (ADEs),7,[ADDRESS_955642] resulting from the use of a drug. Medication use has measureable risks: Pediatric medication errors and ADEs are frequent and costly,6,16-[ADDRESS_955643] signals of ADEs. Our overarching hypothesis is that repeated parent-reported symptom assessments (PRSA) before and after medication changes will provide clinically pertinent information, improve signal detection, and enhance medication safety.24,[ADDRESS_955644] problematic symptoms 
Figure 1: Exposure to 3 serious potential drug-drug interactions increases by [CONTACT_703800] 3 CF-146, Effective 7/10/[ADDRESS_955645], our proposal could provide evidence to support the use of parent-reported symptom assessments more broadly to evaluate other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_703781].  III. Preliminary Studies/Progress Report:    Preliminary Data Relevant to Specific Aim 1: Our study population will be drawn from the Special Care Clinic (SCC) for special needs patients at Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_200931] (CHCO). Of 3,600 active patients annually (and growing rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375]), 50% of children have ≥5 active total medications, and 25% have ≥10 total medications (Table 2). In 2015, there were at least 450 patients prescribed an anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_7377].  Preliminary Data Relevant to Specific Aim 2: We conducted a review of the children cared for in the Special Care Clinic during [ADDRESS_955646] 5 anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_703782].  IV. Research Methods (We present the requested information in order by [CONTACT_703801]).  Overview: To accomplish our aims, we will focus on the population of children with neurological impairment (NI) because of their prototypi[INVESTIGATOR_703783]. However, the following approach will provide generalizable learning and is expected to translate to other high-risk populations. We will strictly apply the scientific method to ensure robust and unbiased experimental design, methodology, and analyses.

Protocol Template Page 4 CF-146, Effective 7/10/11  Identification of Neurologically Impaired (NI) Children: For aims [ADDRESS_955647] been previously published and validated.26 Within the diagnostic classification scheme, sub-categories of types of NI (e.g. cerebral palsy, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]) are available to facilitate comparisons and analyses between different types of NI, as necessary.  Definition of Polypharmacy: No standard definition of pediatric polypharmacy exists. Conservatively, polypharmacy involves using ³2 distinct drugs concurrently, although the adult definition is typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] >[ADDRESS_955648] pharmacovigilance needs. We will use National Drug Codes (NDC) and the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system27 to ensure that polypharmacy counts are based on distinct medications (i.e., two dosage forms of the same medication are counted as a single medication). We will exclude vaccinations and topi[INVESTIGATOR_703784].  Aim 1: Conduct cross-sectional parent-reported symptom assessments (PRSA): In a clinic population of 300 children, we will administer an electronic validated symptom inventory to parents to advance our understanding of signal-to-noise and signal detection challenges in this population.  Hypothesis 1a: Patients with higher levels of polypharmacy have greater symptom diversity and intensity.  Hypothesis 1b: Parent reports will identify more symptoms than concurrent medical record notes.  A. Outcome Measure(s):  Aim 1a Outcome Measures: For general symptom burden, the global symptom score (continuous, from 0-100).   Exposure Variable: Medication count variable (continuous variable).  Additional clinical covariates: We will collect additional clinical information, including biologically relevant variables, at the time of the visit (Table 3, below).   Aim 1b Outcome Measures: Counts of distinct symptoms.   Exposure Variable: PRSA versus clinic visit notes.  B. Description of Population to be Enrolled: We will include all patients with NI and >5 scheduled medications aged 0-17 years-old and their parents. Because Aim 1 only requires a 1-day study period, the maximum age limit will be 17 years and 364 days. We will include patients with English or Spanish speaking parents (which represents 96% of potential SCC patients), as the study instrument has been validated for both languages.28 All eligible subjects and their primary parent caregiver will be screened and enrolled, without bias. We anticipate a gender distribution representative of the children cared for in the Special Care Clinic, and a 2:1 female-to-male ratio for their parent caregiver.  C. Study Design and Research Methods: This will be a cross-sectional analysis of parent-reported symptoms among a cohort of 300 children with NI and polypharmacy recruited from the SCC.

Protocol Template Page 5 CF-146, Effective 7/10/11   D. Description, Risks, and Justification of Procedures and Data Collection Tools: Study instrument: As the basis for PRSA, we will use the PediQuest Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (PQ-MSAS), which is an adapted pediatric-specific version of the validated adult MSAS that assesses [ADDRESS_955649] week (the forms are provided in the Appendix).24,29,30 The study instrument is designed to be completed by a full-proxy parent, and 2 versions tailored for specific age groups are available (0-3, 3-18 years-old). Spanish versions are available for both instruments. The study instrument has been previously tested and administered in electronic format to children with cancer and their parents. The PQ-MSAS contains 24 symptom items, each with 4-point scores for domains of frequency, severity, and extent of bother.24 Based on these components, a global symptom score and individual symptom scores can be calculated (0-[ADDRESS_955650]).[ADDRESS_955651] and analysis of MSAS-related research..  Study Procedure: COMIRB will approve all recruitment materials and activities. Children and their primary parental caregivers will be recruited from the Special Care Clinic at the Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20161]. For the studies, an investigator or research coordinator will review the SCC appointments daily. For all patients identified as potential subjects, we will review the medical record to ensure that the patient is eligible. Prior to study enrollment, the study team will obtain and document informed consent from the parent caregiver, as well as assent from the child depending on the level of NI. For eligible patients, data will be recorded prospectively through administration of the PRSA system. Children enrolled in the prospective cohort study will also have clinical information extracted from their EPIC electronic medical record at Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20161]. For patients deemed ineligible at the time of first screening, we will record only patient age and the reason for ineligibility.  [CONTACT_703811] or a trained research assistant will obtain paper-based informed consent prior to the start of the clinic appointment. Before the visit, the parent or parent will then complete the electronic tablet-based study instrument. To minimize the burden of completing this symptom assessment, we will use an electronic delivery system employing Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap), a secure, HIPAA-compliant web-based application designed for data collection for research studies, which is supported free of charge to University researchers. PQ-MSAS information will be transmitted directly to REDCap servers from the electronic capture device for subsequent scoring and analysis. Parents will receive a $[ADDRESS_955652] upon completion of the study instrument. Relevant clinical data (Table 3) will be electronically exported into REDCap from the electronic medical record (EMR) by [CONTACT_703802]’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20161]. A member of the study team blinded to the results of the PRSA will review each subject’s electronic medical record (EMR) 48 hours after completion of the visit (to ensure complete chart data is reviewed) and extract symptoms from the progress note and/or coded visit diagnoses.  Potential Risks and Justification: This is an observational study with minimal psychological, social, and/or legal risks to the subjects. The study design will not alter the natural course of medical care provided to the subject. The main potential risks are related to data privacy. Privacy concerns will be managed through appropriate data collection and storage. Confidentiality will be protected by [CONTACT_703803]. Each child and their primary parental caregiver will be assigned the same unique study number. PRSA data will be transmitted directly to REDCap servers from the electronic capture device for subsequent scoring and analysis, so that no private information is stored locally. Clinical EMR data will be exported by [CONTACT_2005]’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_703785] a RedCap™ database compliant with regulatory requirements, again so that no intermediary repositories of data are created.  PRSA and clinical data will be linked by [CONTACT_60395]. Paper-based consent forms and a key that links study numbers to patient medical record numbers will be kept in the primary investigator’s locked office within a badge-accessed research office suite (ACCORDS) within a badge-accessed research building with 24-hour on-site security. Medical record numbers will be required for the clinical EMR data extractions. Once data extraction has been completed, the key

Additional detailed information about institutional safeguards for data safety are included in the Facilities & Other Resources attachment.  Data Safety and Monitoring: The proposed studies do not meet the definition of clinical trials defined by [CONTACT_703804] a drug or device trial, and a Data Safety and Monitoring Board will not be required. However, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_703786], review, and reporting of any unforeseen events related to the study. The consent form and study instruments will reinforce that the study information collected is not a communication with the participant’s provider. In the unlikely event that worsening symptoms are observed out-of-proportion to what is expected, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_703787] [ADDRESS_955654] the patient’s provider.  E. Potential Scientific Problems and Alternative Approaches:  Given the cross-sectional design of this study, we fully acknowledge that we will not be able to investigate causality between medications and symptoms; that is the goal of Aim 3.  F. Data Analysis Plan: To analyze Aim 1, we will generate descriptive statistics of individual symptoms present among eligible patients. We will stratify findings by [CONTACT_703805], such that we can report, for example, “Among children with NI taking ³10 medications, in the past week 70% experienced constipation, 50% somnolence, and 20% pain.” We will further stratify by [CONTACT_703806].  To test hypothesis 1a, that increasing levels of polypharmacy will be associated with a greater symptom burden, we will employ multiple linear regression techniques. We will model the number of medications as a continuous predictor variable with the symptom composite score as the continuous outcome variable. We will perform transformations of the outcome variable as necessary depending on its distribution. We will adjust for age, number of acute diagnoses, and number of CCCs.  Power and Sample Size Calculation: To detect a minimum 4-point difference in global symptom scores (which has previously been reported as a clinically relevant difference24) between those children taking 5 medications and those children taking 10 medications, with a power of 80% and a significance of 0.05, we would require 168 subjects (112 in the 5 medication group and 56 in the 10 medication group).  To test hypothesis 1b, we will test differences in means of PRSA and clinic visit counts of symptoms using a two-sided paired t-test.  Power and Sample Size Calculation: With a sample size of 300, significance of 0.05, standard deviation of 5, and correlation of 0.5, we will have 90% power to detect a minimum 1-point difference in mean counts.  G: Summarize Knowledge to be Gained: Almost no drug trial or post-marketing surveillance data exist to guide medication safety in this complex population. Two major problems impede the identification of ADEs in children with NI and polypharmacy: 1) No system exists to assess multiple symptoms among children who cannot self-report and 2) we lack prevalence information about the background symptoms commonly experienced in this population against which to look for problematic signals. Systematic parent-based symptom inventories have been used to measure symptom burden in complex patient populations, such as children with terminal cancers.24,29,[ADDRESS_955655] been developed to measure symptom burden at 
Protocol Template Page 7 CF-146, Effective 7/10/[ADDRESS_955656] been successfully administered to children with cancer as frequently as monthly even during their terminal decline.24  Deliverable: We will provide estimates of the most prevalent symptoms among children with NI and polypharmacy, stratified by [CONTACT_703807]. These data will help providers understand the symptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_703788], in order to optimize their prescribing and monitoring decisions. This will also allow us to target classes of medications potentially associated with commonly experienced symptoms, which when prescribed, may benefit from proactive, increased monitoring.  Aim 2: Conduct a prospective cohort study to quantify the detection of known ADEs using PRSA: We will follow [ADDRESS_955657] medication changes (empaneled in Aim 2) and assess whether using PRSA prior to and after specific medication changes detects known side effects.  Hypothesis 2: Known anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_703778]-person symptom changes following an anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_703779] a new drug start or a substantial dosage increase.  A. Outcome Measure(s):  Exposure Variable of Interest: New start prescription of an antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_7377] (or subsequent dose increase).  Primary Longitudinal Outcome of Interest:  Reported symptom levels during peri-exposure monitoring. Symptoms will be assessed using the age-appropriate PQ-MSAS proxy form as described above in Aim 2. A priori, we will focus on the known ADE of somnolence6, and expand the analysis to other common and significant symptoms as identified in Aim 2.  Covariates: We will collect additional clinical information, including biologically relevant variables (Table 3).  B. Description of Population to be Enrolled: We will include all patients with NI and >5 scheduled medications aged 0-17 years-old and their parents. Because Aim 2 requires a 12-month study period, the maximum age limit at study enrollment will be 17 years and 0 days. We will include patients with English or Spanish speaking parents (which represents 96% of potential SCC patients), as the study instrument has been validated for both languages.28 All eligible subjects and their primary parent caregiver will be screened and enrolled, without bias. We anticipate a gender distribution representative of the children cared for in the Special Care Clinic, and a 2:1 female-to-male ratio for their parent caregiver.  C. Study Design and Research Methods: This will be a 12-month prospective cohort study of [ADDRESS_955658] month for seizure control or current use of multiple anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_23698].  D.

Protocol Template Page 8 CF-146, Effective 7/10/[ADDRESS_955659] at Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20161]. For patients deemed ineligible at the time of first screening, we will record only patient age and the reason for ineligibility.  [CONTACT_703811] or a professional research assistant will obtain paper-based informed consent upon identification of a potential subject. After enrollment, we will identify exposure events by [CONTACT_703808]-based medication reports on enrolled subjects that will flag new AED prescriptions. When an event occurs, we will email the parent within 24 hours with a link to a REDCap survey containing the age-appropriate PQ-MSAS proxy form. If the parent has hasn’t yet administered the new prescription, we will ask about current symptoms; if they have, we will ask about the 24 hours prior to starting the medication. The parent will receive the survey at additional times (Figure 3) chosen to capture potential immediate, acute, and longer term symptoms. To minimize recall bias, all surveys will ask parents to report symptoms in the past 24 hours. We will also generate monthly EHR-based reports of subjects’ medication lists; office, ED, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042]; and, any acute diagnoses. All data will be stored in a HIPAA-compliant REDCap database. Parents will also be compensated with a $[ADDRESS_955660] for up to 2 instances of peri-event monitoring and a $[ADDRESS_955661] upon study completion (the total possible reimbursement is $100).  Potential Risks and Justification: This is an observational study with minimal psychological, social, and/or legal risks to the subjects. The study design will not alter the natural course of medical care provided to the subject. The main potential risks are related to data privacy. Privacy concerns will be managed through appropriate data collection and storage. Confidentiality will be protected by [CONTACT_703803]. Each child and their primary parental caregiver will be assigned the same unique study number.

The consent form and study instruments will reinforce that the study information collected is not a communication with the participant’s provider; the RedCap-based internet PRSAs will reinforce that if a participant feels that their child is having a problem, the participant will need to call their child’s provider immediately. In the unlikely event that worsening symptoms are observed out-of-proportion to what is expected, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_703787] [ADDRESS_955662] the patient’s provider.  E. Potential Scientific Problems: There is a risk of reporting fatigue that may result in missing or incomplete data. However, prior studies utilizing this instrument in a different capacity demonstrated that the majority of respondents completed the inventory on at least a monthly basis.[ADDRESS_955663] methods to handle missing longitudinal data. Additionally, there exists a small likelihood that children may receive specialty or emergency care outside the Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_703789], which may limit our ability to detect new medication starts. We have attempted to mitigate this by [CONTACT_703809].  F. Data Analysis Plan:  To test hypothesis 2, we will analyze the ability to detect changes in somnolence following the exposure of interest. To summarize the data, we will graphically depi[INVESTIGATOR_703790], group trajectories over time, and report group means of key variables over time. During peri-event monitoring, to test if exposure to a new (or subsequently increased) AED was associated with changes in somnolence, we will employ repeated measures mixed models to estimate the effects of a new-start AED on the level of somnolence over time. This type of analysis will enable us to study intra-individual changes in symptoms, while also providing flexibility in case missing data is present. We will model as fixed effects the time from start of AED and the starting level of polypharmacy; and, random effects to account for correlation among observations from the same patient. We will test using higher-order terms to model changes over time as necessary.  Implementation Analysis: We will report measures of implementation including the ability of participants to carry out the intervention activities, positive/negative effects on the target population, cohort retention, and the amount and type of resources needed to implement the intervention.   Power and Sample Size Calculation: The main objective is to determine whether we can detect changes in expected adverse symptoms (e.g. somnolence) within subjects using the study instrument. The prevalence and severity of symptoms is unknown among children exposed to polypharmacy. We based our conservative power calculation on studies using PQ-MSAS in children with cancer (the composite symptom score was 12.[ADDRESS_955664] deviation of 8.6).[ADDRESS_955665] that in a population of NI children, the somnolence symptom score will be much higher and more variable with medication changes than the composite score we used for this power calculation.6 Because of the powerful within-subjects design, using a sample size of 50 subjects, a power of 80%, an alpha of 0.05, a conservative within-subject correlation between symptom measurements of 0.5, and accounting for 10% missing data, we will have the power to detect a clinically meaningful average 4-point change in a 100-point symptom score, such as somnolence.24   G.  Summarize Knowledge to be Gained:   Amidst a complicated background of symptom noise, we will capi[INVESTIGATOR_703791]-reported outcomes to improve the quantity and quality of data to detect significant symptom changes that could signal ADEs. Healthcare systems primarily rely on passive surveillance of ADEs, i.e. an adverse event is identified when a patient worsens enough to present for evaluation of a medication-related problem. The use of patient reported outcomes, particularly in patients with oncologic processes, has been shown to provide significantly more toxicity and symptom data than 
Protocol Template Page 10 CF-146, Effective 7/10/11  clinician-based assessments36,37, facilitate improved communication between patients and providers, and to improve clinical outcomes.38 In both pediatric and adult cancer populations, electronic completion of symptom inventories is feasible and acceptable to patients.24,39   Deliverable: Aim [ADDRESS_955666] on improving patient safety and for implementation in additional high-risk populations.

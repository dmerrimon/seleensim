8 STUDY POPULATION  
The study population consists of male and female subjects ( 18 years or older ) with a 
diagnosis of refract ive ametropia (myopia and hyperopia) It is aimed to enroll  (consent)  
approximately 110 subjects in approximately 8 sites throughout the [LOCATION_002] , with a 
target of  100 total subjects completed , with  13 (intended minimum) to 14 (maximum) 
subjects per site. Site -specific targets may  vary based upon  individual site capabilities. 
Estimated time needed to recruit subjects for the study is approximately 4 weeks ; however,

• Corneal abrasion affecting ≥ 50% of corneal surface area  
 
Device Deficiencies  
A device deficiency is inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, 
durability, reliability, safety, or performance. A device deficiency may or may not be 
associated with patient harm ( i.e., ADE or SADE); however, not all ADEs or SADEs are due 
to a device deficiency. The investigator  should determine the applicable category listed in the 
Device Deficiency eCRF for the identified or suspect device deficiency and report any patient 
harm se parately. Examples of device deficiencies include the following:  
• Failure to meet product specifications (e .g., incorrect lens power/diameter/base 
curve/color)  
• Lens /solution  cloudy  
• Lens surface/edge defect  
• Torn lens during handling/in pack  
• Packaging defici t (e.g., mislabeled product , tampered seal,  leaking bottle/container ) 
• Suspect product contamination  
• Lack of performance

during the study are to be reviewed by [CONTACT_093] . Any untoward (unfavorable and 
unintended) change in a protocol -specific parameter  that is 
clinically relevant, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871] , is to be reported as an AE. These 
clinically relevant changes will be reported regardless of causality.   
11.3 Procedures for Recording and Reporting  
AEs are collected from the time of informed consent Any preexisting medical conditions or 
signs/symptoms present in a subject prior to the start of the study (i.e., before informed 
consent is signed) are not considered AEs in the study and should be recorded in the Medical 
Histo ry section of the eCRF.  
In addition, temporary lens awareness or visual changes during the fitting process are not 
considered AEs if the investigator  assesses that the symptom(s) can reasonably resolve within 
the anticipated adaptation period.   
For each recorded event, the ADEs and SAEs documentation must include: date of 
occurrence, severity, treatment (if applicable), outcome, and assessments of the seriousness 
and causality. In addition, the investigator  must document all device deficiencies r eported or 
observed with test and comparator product s on the Device Deficiency eCRF. The site must 
submit all available information on ADEs, SAEs, and device deficiencies to the study sponsor 
immediately as follows:  
• All SAEs  must be reported immediately (w ithin 24 hours) of the investigator ’s or site ’s 
awareness . 
• ADEs that do not meet seriousness criteria and device deficiencies must be reported 
within 10 calendar days of the Investigator ’s or site ’s awareness.  
• A printed copy of the comp leted Serious Advers e Event and Adverse Device Effect and/or 
Device Deficiency  eCRF  must be included with product returns.  
• Additional relevant information after initial reporting must be entered into the eCRF as 
soon  as the data become available.  
• Document any changes to conco mitant medications on the appropriate eCRFs.  
• Document all relevant information from Discharge Summary, Autopsy Report,  Certificate 
of Death , etc., if applicable, in narrative section of the Serious Adverse Event  eCRF  and 
Adverse Device Effect (for related AEs)  eCRF.

EDC system once it becomes operational.  
Study sponsor representatives may be contact[CONTACT_529113] -related question and their 
contact [CONTACT_691950].  
Further, depending upon the nature of the AE or device deficiency being reported, the study 
sponsor  may request copi[INVESTIGATOR_13271] ’s medical records . The 
investigator  must also report all AEs and device deficiencies that could have led to a SADE 
according to the requirements of regulatory authorities or IRB/IEC.  
Intensity and Causality Assessments  
Where appropriate, the investigator  must assess the in tensity (severity) of the AE based on 
medical judgment with consideration of any subjective symptom(s), as defined below:  
Intensity (Severity)  
Mild  An AE is mild if the subject is aware of but can easily tolerate the sign or 
symptom.  
Moderate  An AE is mo derate if the sign or symptom results in discomfort significant 
enough to cause interference with the subject ’s usual activities.  
Severe  An AE is severe if the sign or symptom is incapacitating and results in the 
subject ’s inability to work or engage in t heir usual activities.  
For every AE in the study, the investigator  must assess the causality (Related or Not Related 
to the medical device or study procedure). An assessment of causality will also be performed 
by [CONTACT_691951] s, as shown below:  
Causality  
Related  An AE classified as related may be either definitely related or possibly related 
where a direct cause and effect relationship with the medical device or study 
procedure has not been demonstrated, but there is a reasonable possibility that 
the AE was caused by [CONTACT_443411].

broken and of the circums tances involved.  Additionally, the Study Sponsor may be required 
to unmask the information in order to fulfill expedited regulatory reporting requirements  
11.6 Follow -Up of Subjects with Adverse Events  
The investigator  is responsible for adequate and safe medi cal care of subjects during the 
study and for ensuring that appropriate medical care and relevant follow -up procedures are 
maintained after the study.  
The investigator  should provide the study sponsor  with any new safety information (which 
includes new AE s and changes to previously reported AEs) that may affect the safety 
evaluation of the device. For AEs that are unresolved/ ongoing at time of subject exit from 
study, any additional information received at follow -up should be documented in the eCRFs 
up to  study completion (i .e., database lock).

Alcon – Business Use Only  [IP_ADDRESS]  Statistical Hypotheses  
The null and alternative hypotheses are formulated in terms of the predefined margin of 0.05 
for noninferiority:  
H0: µ(T) – µ(C) ≥ 0.05  
Ha: µ(T) – µ(C) < 0.05  
where µ (T) and µ (C) denote the mean distance VA for DT1 and  Infuse, respectively, on the 
logMAR scale.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis Methods  
A mixed effect repeated measures model will be utilized to test these hypotheses. The model 
will include terms for lens, period, and sequence as fixed effects. Within -subject correlation 
due to e ye and the crossover design will also be accounted for in the model. Lens difference 
(DT1 minus Infuse) and the corresponding one -sided 95% upper confidence limit will be 
computed. Noninferiority in distance VA will be declared if upper confidence limit is  less 
than 0 .05.

All data obtained in evaluable subjects/eyes will be included in the analysis. No imputation 
for missing values will be carried out  
 
12.6 Safety Analys es 
The safety endpoints are:  
• AEs  
• Biomicroscopy findings  
• Device Deficiencies  
There are no safety hypotheses planned in this study. The focus of the safety analysis will be 
a comprehensive descriptive assessment of occurrence of adverse events as well as the other 
listed parameters.  
All AEs occurring from the time a subject signs inf ormed consent to study exit will be 
accounted for in the reporting. Safety analyses will be conducted using the safety analysis set 
on a treatment -emergent basis. Descriptive summaries (frequencies and percentages) for 
ocular and nonocular AEs will be pres ented by [CONTACT_243295]. AEs leading to study discontinuation and SAEs will be identified. Individual 
subject listings will be provided, as necessary.  
Individual subject listings will be provided for AEs that occur after signing informed consent 
but prior to exposure to IP.  
Each biomicroscopy parameter will be tabulated by [CONTACT_13296]. For each applicable 
biomicroscopy parameter, counts and percentages of eyes that experience an increase of ≥ 2 
grades from basel ine (last assessment prior to study lens exposure) to any subsequent visit 
within the same period will be presented. A supportive listing will be generated which will 
include all biomicroscopy data from all visits within the same period for those eyes 
expe riencing the increase.  
Two listings for device deficiencies, prior to exposure to study contact [CONTACT_443416] -
emergent, will be provided. Additionally, each device deficiency category will be tabulated.  
No inferential testing will be conducted for  the safety analyses .

12.8 Sample Size Justification  
Sample size calculation is based on a prior clinical study  which evaluated 
performance of DT1 and Infuse.  
Primary Effectiveness  
To demonstrate noninferiority (margin = 0.05 in logMAR; ½ line in Snellen) in distance VA 
as a one -tailed hypothesis with α=0.05, and using a standard deviation of 0.0 497 for paired 
differences, 80% power can be attained with a sample size of 8 (4 per sequence).

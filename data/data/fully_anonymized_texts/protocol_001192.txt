Study Title: A Phase Ib/II Clinical Study of BBI608 Administered with 
Paclitaxel in Adult Patients  with Advanced Malignancies
Study Number: BBI608-201
Study Phase: Ib/II
Study Drug BBI608, an investigational small molecule anticancer drug, that i s hypothesized 
to affect multiple oncogenic cellular pathways, including inhibition of the 
STAT3 pathway, which has been implicated in cancer stem cells vi ability.
Primary Objective: To determine the safety, tolerability and recommended Phase 2 d ose (RP2D) of 
BBI608 when administered with paclitaxel in adult patients with advanced 
malignancies
Secondary 
Objectives:To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of BBI608 and paclitaxe l when 
administered in combination.
To assess the preliminary anti-tumor activity of BBI608 when ad ministered in
combination with paclitaxel in patients with advanced malignancie s.
To assess the objective response rate (ORR), disease control ra te (DCR), 
progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) of p atients with 
selected tumor types treated wit h BBI608 in combination with pa clitaxel.
To determine the pharmacodynamics (biomarkers) of BBI608 when tu mor 
biopsy is possible.
Study Design: This is an open label, multi-center, dose escalation study of B BI608 administered 
in combination with a fixed dose of paclitaxel administered IV w eekly at 80
mg/m2given as a 1 hour infusion; A cycle will consist of daily and con tinuous 
oral administration of BBI608 for four weeks in combination wit h paclitaxel 
administered IV weekly on day 3, 10 and 17 of each 28 day cycle.  I f  
administration of paclitaxel is discontinued due to paclitaxel- related toxicities, 
the administration of BBI608 will be continued until disease pr ogression if 
tolerated. The doses of BBI608 will escalate in three patient co horts until a RP2D
is reached.  
Pharmacokinetics (PK) will be performed for patients enrolled at selected study 
sites in the first cycle of the study. 
Pharmacodynamic assessments will be performed in patients with a ccessible 
tumors when tumor biopsy is possible. 
Safety and tolerability of BBI608 in combination with paclitaxe l will be assessed 
for the duration of study treatment.  
Evaluation of preliminary anti-tumor activity of BBI608 in combi nation with 
paclitaxel will be performed at regular intervals while patients  remain on study. 
Study Population: This study is conducted in patients with advanced solid tumors for whom weekly 
paclitaxel is an acceptable option;  including, ovarian cancer, ca ncer, breast 
cancer, NSCLC, melanoma, and gastric and esophageal adenocarcino ma.
Currently the study is only enrolling patients with thymic carci noma.
All patients must have a histologically or cytologically confir med malignancy 
that is locally advanced, unresectable, metastatic, or recurren t.  
Other inclusion criteria for all patients include: age > 18 yrs. ; ECOG 
performance status of 1 or 0; m easurable disease; and adequate hepatic, renal, 
and bone-marrow function.

continuous daily dosing, dose escalation will stop and an addit ional three patients 
will be enrolled for a total of six patients treated at the pri or dose level. 
The MTD is defined as the dose level at which no more than one out of six 
patients has an observable DLT. 
Duration of Treatment: For an individual patient, treatment with BBI608 and paclitaxel w ill continue 
until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression or another disc ontinuation 
criterion is met.  It is expected that the majority of patients will receive between 
one and four cycles of BBI608 and paclitaxel for a treatment peri od of four to 16 
weeks. 
Patients may continue protocol therapy or BBI608 alone beyond radio logic
progression provided there is no clinical deterioration.  
Criteria for 
Determination of 
Dose-Limiting Toxicity:A DLT is defined by [CONTACT_894659]608, or BBI608 in combination with pa clitaxel within

clinically significant  hazard to the patient.
Whether a DLT has occurred will be assessed for each patient at  D a y  [ADDRESS_1253559] 28 days of BBI608 therapy.  DLT will be dete rmined from 
adverse events, changes from bas eline in physical examination f indings and 
laboratory parameters.  The incidence of adverse events and DLT s will be 
evaluated for each dose leve l and for all patients.  
Adverse events considered related to paclitaxel will not be cons idered DLTs.
Pharmacokinetic 
and 
Pharmacodynamic 
Variables:Pharmacokinetic variables to be determined include maximum plas ma drug 
concentration (Cmax), volume of distribution, area under the ti me-concentration 
curve (AUC), distribution half-l ife, and terminal half-life.  F or patients enrolled 
at select study sites, blood samples for PK determination will b e drawn on Day 
[ADDRESS_1253560] cycle for each dose level.  Respon se (increase or 
decrease) of several biomarkers from biopsied tumors following BBI608
administration will be examined in patient with accessible tumor s for biopsy .  
Tumor biopsies will be collected prior to the first dose of BBI [ADDRESS_1253561] signed the 
optional tumor biopsy consent.
Statistical Methods: All patients receiving at least one daily dose of BBI608 will b e considered 
evaluable for safety analyses.  In addition to the evaluation a nd categorization of 
adverse events, listin gs of laborator y test results collected at baseline and durin g

those laboratory tests over time will be presented.
Patients who have received at least one cycle of BBI608 and hav e had at least 
one disease assessment following the initiation of therapy will  be considered 
evaluable for response.  The anti- tumor activity will be evaluated on an 
exploratory basis and will be summarized using descriptive stat istics or graphics.
For each tumor type, the following endpoints will be summarized : Objective 
response rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of patients with a documented 
complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on RECIST  1.1; Disease 
Control Rate (DCR), defined as the proportion of patients with documented CR, 
P R  a n d  s t a b l e  d i s e a s e  ( S D )  b a s e d  o n  R E C I S T  1 . 1 ;  p r o g r e s s i o n  f r e e survival 
(PFS); and overall survival (OS).
There is no statistical hypothesis testing in the Phase II part  a nd  t he  pl a n ne d 
sample size of Phase II (20 - 40 per cohort) is considered to be  clinically adequate 
to assess tolerability, safety, and preliminary anti-cancer act ivity of study drugs 
of interest, and actual sample size depends on the actual enrol lment in each arm.
Sample Size Justification for Thymic Carcinoma Cohort:
A total of 10 (minimum) to 15 (m aximum) patients will be target ed to this cohort 
and a Bayesian posterior probability approach will be employed t o monitor the 
enrollment based on the overall response rate (ORR) by [CONTACT_10585] 16.  After the first 
[ADDRESS_1253562] response evaluation, or withdraw, or die by [CONTACT_894660] 16, the 
Bayesian posterior probability of the ORR being greater than a target value will 
be continuously evaluated. If the posterior probability is grea ter than 70% or less 
than 20%, then further enrollment may be stopped. Otherwise enro llment will 
continue until the enrollment cap of [ADDRESS_1253563] the 
mean equal to the historically observed ORR of 0.22 (Lemma 2011 ).

Confidential Page: [ADDRESS_1253565] uncovered the presence of cancer stem cells  (CSC, also called tumor initiating cells 
or cancer stem-like cells) which have self-renewal capability a n d  a r e  c o n s i d e r e d  t o  b e  
potentiallyresponsible for malignant growth, relapse and metast asis. Importantly, CSCs are inherently 
resistant to conventional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Therefore, a targeted agen t with activity against cancer stem cells 
for cancer patients is being explored (Lobo, Shimono et al. 2007;  Boman and Wicha, 2008;  Please find 
a list of updated reviews on cancer stem cells in all major can cer types in the special issue of Journal 
of Clinical Oncology on cancer stem cells (J Clin Oncol. 2008 Jun 10;26(17)).
BBI608 is a small molecule that is hypothesized to affect multi ple oncogenic cellular pathways, 
including inhibition of the STAT3 pathway. 
STAT3 is an oncogene that belongs to a family of transcription f actors activated in response to 
cytokines and/or growth factors to promote proliferation, survi val, and other biological processes.  
STAT3 activates certain genes involved in tumorigenesis, invasio n, and metastasis, including Bcl-xl, 
Akt, c-Myc, cyclin D1, VEGF, and survivin.  STAT3 is aberrantly active in a variety of human cancers, 
including in more than half of breast and lung cancers, hepatoc ellular carcinomas, and multiple 
myelomas and more than 95% of head/neck cancers. STAT3 ablation by [CONTACT_894661], survival, and metastasis. 
While essential for embryonic deve lopment, the deficiency of ST AT3 seems well tolerated in adult 
mice. Patients with Job’s syndrom e survive into adulthood with S TAT3 dominant negative mutations.
In a French registry study of 60 patients with Job’s syndrome, 93% were alive at age 50 (Chandesris et 
al, 2012).
Therefore, blocking STAT3 may target cancer stem cells as well a s the bulk of the heterogeneous cancer 
cells while potentially spare normal cells and normal adult stem c ells
1.2 Preclinical Efficacy
Cancer stem cells are intrinsically resistant (more than 5 to 1 0 fold) to chemotherapeutic drugs. BBI608 
has activity (~100 to 500 nM) against cancer stem cells in vitro while sparing normal hematopoietic 
stem cells (IC 50not reached at 30 PM) in vitro. BBI608 has demonstrated in vitro activity in human 
cancer cell lines derived from m ultiple tumor types with IC 50s ranging from 0.[ADDRESS_1253566] level (NOAEL, based on  clinical observation, laboratory tests, 
gross and histopathological chang es) for rats administered BBI60 8 daily orally over 28 days was 30 
mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose: 180 mg/m2) and the NOAEL in dogs a dministered BBI608 daily 
orally over 28 days was 30 mg/kg/day (human equivalent dose: 600  mg/m2).

Confidential Page: 131.4 Safety and Signs of Antit umor Activity in Phase I
A phase 1 dose escalation study (BBI608-101) in adult patients wit h advanced cancer was initiated to 
determine the safety, tolerab ility, recommended phase 2 dose (R P2D), pharmacokinetics and 
preliminary anti-tumor activity of BBI608. A modified Simon acc elerated titration scheme was used 
for dose escalation, with a cycle consisting of twice-daily ora l administration of BBI608 for 4 weeks, 
and was repeated every 4 weeks (28 days) until progression of di sease, unacceptable toxicity, or other 
discontinuation criteria were met.
The dose of BBI608 has been escalated from 20 mg to 2000 mg/day wh en BBI608 was taken bid, and 
MTD is not reached. The total daily dose has been escalated to 1500 mg (total daily dose) when BBI608 
was taken tid, and MTD is not reached. Further dose escalation is limited by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_894636].
Please refer to the Investigator’s  Brochure (version 6.3) for cur rent clinical data.

Confidential Page: 174 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
4.1 Overall Study Design
This is an open-label, multicente r Phase Ib study of oral BBI608  administered with paclitaxel to patients 
with advanced malignancies. The s tudy is designed to explore th e safety, tolerability and 
pharmacokinetics of BBI608 and paclitaxel and define a recommen ded Phase 2 dose.
Treatment will be initiated at a dose level of 1000 mg total dai ly dose of BBI608 for BID regimen and 
escalate until the RP2D or MTD is determined. In each cycle, BBI 608 will be taken daily continuously 
for 4 weeks (28 days).  BBI608 will be administered daily one h our prior or two hours after meals with 
the first dose taken in the morning.  On day 3, 10, and 17 of ea ch 28 day cycle, patients will receive
paclitaxel at 80 mg/m2given as a [ADDRESS_1253576] morni ng dose of 
BBI608.
Cycles (28 days) will be repeated until progression of disease, u nacceptable toxicity, or another 
discontinuation criterion is met.  In the case of toxicity, adj ustment is permitted. 
Dose escalation will be perform ed using three-patient cohorts a s shown in the table below

The MTD is defined as the dose le vel at which no more than one patient with DLT is observed among 
six patients.  If MTD is not reached, the recommended Phase 2 do se (RP2D) of BBI608 will be
determined by [CONTACT_894663] a dose level w hich gives the best exposure.
Phase Ib will end when there are < 2 patients with DLT out of 6  evaluated for DLT at the regimen 
selected for use as RP2D.

4.2 Rationale for Study Design 
Considerable data has been col lected from the Phase I monothera py study of BBI608 (Protocol BBI608-
101) conducted in advanced oncolo gy patients who have failed mu ltiple previous regimens.  Dose 
escalation for BBI608 has been s uccessfully conducted from a tot al daily dose of [ADDRESS_1253580] 
b e e n  g e n e r a l l y  m i l d  w i t h  t h e  m o s t common being: diarrhea, nause a ,  a n d  f a t i g u e .   G r a d e  3  e v e n t s  
include: fatigue or diarrhea. No bone marrow suppression or neurop athy was observed.
In the BBI608-201 study, dose escalation of BBI608 will be begi n at a dose of 500 mg bid with a total 
daily dose of 1000 mg, in combination with 80 mg/m2of paclitaxel weekly. The starting dose of 
BBI608 will be at 600 mg (total daily dose) for tid regimen. The dose escalation schedule of BBI608 
is presented in Section 4.1.

BBI608-201 Clinical Protocol 4 Amendment #4.0
Confidential Page: 194.[ADDRESS_1253581] been observed in the BBI608-101 phase I trial. 
BBI608 has been well tolerated in phase I trials. MTD was not r eached in the BBI608-101 Phase I study 
with doses escalated from 20 mg up to 1000 mg bid (2000 mg total daily dose). Further dose escalation
above 2000 mg/day is limited by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_13551]. 
Adverse events observed in the BBI608-[ADDRESS_1253582] 
common being: diarrhea, nausea, and fatigue.  Grade 3 events in clude: fatigue or diarrhea. There is no 
clinically significant overlap b etween adverse events observed for BBI608 and the adverse effects of 
paclitaxel. 
The sponsor believes that the p roposed study is acceptable in t he context of its risks and benefits.
4.[ADDRESS_1253583] 28 days of continuous daily 
administration of BBI608.   Based on the tolerability and safet y of evaluable patients, enrollment at the 
next dose level and/or additiona l patients into the ongoing coh ort will occur according to criteria 
described below: 
xIf zero treated patients experience a DLT (defined below) by [CONTACT_140969] y 28, then dose escalation will 
occur.
xIf one treated patient experiences a DLT by [CONTACT_2006] 28, then an add itional three patients will be 
enrolled for a total of six patients treated at the same dose l evel.  Escalation will occur if no 
additional DLTs are seen in that cohort (one out of six patient s) 
xIf two or more treated patients at a dose level experience a DL T by [CONTACT_2006] 28, dose escalation 
will stop and this dose level w ill be considered the maximally administered dose.

to a cohort after agreement betw een the BBI Medical Monitor and  the Principal Investigator. 
4.6 Dose-Limiting Toxicity
Dose-limiting toxicity is defined by [CONTACT_894664] t he following toxicities possibly or 
probably related to BBI608 within 28 days of treatment.  DLT wil l be scored during the 28 days of 
BBI608 treatment. 
xGrade 4 hematological toxicity
xGrade 3 or 4 non-hematol ogical toxicity, except:

4.7 Study Duration 
Patients will receive treatment with BBI608 and paclitaxel until progression of disease, unacceptable 
toxicity or another of the disc ontinuation criteria is document ed (see Section 5.6).  It is expected that
most patients will receive between one and four cycles of BBI60 8 and paclitaxel for a treatment period 
of four to 16 weeks.

5.4 Tumor Evaluation Visits
Disease status and tumor respons e will be assessed in eight-wee k intervals up to one year after starting 
therapy (calculated from the first dose of BBI608) or as clinic ally indicated. Standard imaging studies 
should be performed according to institutional procedures. Tumo r response for solid tumors will be 
evaluated using the guidelines for Response Evaluation Criteria  in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) outlined 
in Section 9.
Once progression of disease during therapy is documented, patie nts may receive any therapy as 
determined by [CONTACT_24018] (see Section 5.6).
A protocol radiologic assessment consists of computed tomograph y (CT) imaging of the chest, 
abdomen, and pelvis with IV contrast.  Non-contrast imaging is a llowed in patients with an allergic 
reaction to IV contrast material despi[INVESTIGATOR_894640], provided the tumor lesions 
can be measured and followed reproducibly, according to the inv estigator.  An alternate method for 
those with allergy to CT contrast  material is an MRI of the abd omen and pelvis and a non-contrast CT 
of the chest.  
Images should continue to be obt ained every 8 weeks (56 days) f rom the first dose of BBI608 until 
radiologic disease progression is documented. A window of ± 7 d ays is allowed when scheduling scans.

CTCAE, Version 4.0, published [ADDRESS_1253613]-tr eatment follow-up period (21 Code of 
Federal Regulations [CFR] §312.64 [b]) on designated CRF pages.  AEs occurring following the 
signature [CONTACT_28513], but prior to the first dose of study drug will not be reported as AEs.  
It is also important to record all AEs that result in permanent  discontinuation of the investigational 
product being studied, whether serious or non-serious.
Serious adverse events (SAEs), a s defined below, must be report ed to [LOCATION_011] Biomedical Inc. or its 
representative within [ADDRESS_1253614] a causal relationship with 
the treatment.  An AE can there fore be any unfavorable and unin tended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding, for example),  symptom, or disease temporall y associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considere d related to the medicinal pro duct.
Laboratory data are to be collected as stipulated in this proto col, and toxicity trends will be analyzed 
utilizing objective toxicity criteria.  Clinical syndromes asso ciated with laboratory abnormalities are to 
be recorded as appropriate (e.g. , diabetes mellitus instead of hyperglycemia).  
Progression of disease is conside red an efficacy outcome parame ter and should not be captured as an 
AE.  A non-serious AE is any untoward medical occurrence that d oes not meet any of the criteria for 
SAEs as defined below.
Patients should be instructed to  report any AE that they experi ence to the investigator.  Investigators 
should assess the patient for AEs at each visit.  AEs occurring  during the clinical trial and the follow-
up period should be recorded on the appropriate AE CRF.  To cap ture the most potentially relevant 
safety information during a clinical trial, it is important tha t investigators record accurate AE terms on 
CRFs.
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than i ndividual associated signs and 
symptoms should be identified by [CONTACT_67442].  However, if an observed 
or reported sign or symptom is not considered a component of a specific disease or syndrome by [CONTACT_1275], it should be recorded as a separate AE on the CRF.

The following definitions and cr iteria (from Response Evaluatio n Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST 
1.1, Eisenhauer et al. 2009]1) should be used for the baseline evaluations of existing disea se, and for 
the ongoing evaluation of tumor responses.
Measurable disease - the presence of at least one measurable lesion. 
Measurable lesions - lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimens ion with longest 
diameter t10 mm using conventional techniques or t10 mm with spi[INVESTIGATOR_25457]. Malignant lymph 
nodes must be t15 mm in the shortest diameter.
Non-measurable lesions - all other lesions, including sma ll lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm with 
conventional techniques, <[ADDRESS_1253617] scan or t10 mm to <15 mm in short axis), i.e., bone 
lesions, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, cystic lesions and also abdominal masses that are not 
confirmed and followed by [CONTACT_15218].
xAll measurements should be taken  and recorded in metric notatio n, using a ruler or 
calipers.
xThe same method of assessment and  the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during foll ow-up.
xLesions will only be considered m easurable when they are superf icial (e.g., skin 
nodules and palpable lymph nodes).  For the case of skin lesion s, documentation by 
[CONTACT_6775], and a measurement with a ruler to estimate t he size of the lesion, 
is recommended.
9.[ADDRESS_1253618] should 
be performed using a 5 mm con tiguous reconstruction algorithm.
xAll imaging methods should be pe rformed according to institutio nal standards with 
each patient having consistency of methods beginning from basel ine through the 
course of the study.
9.2 Baseline Documentation of “Tar get” and “Non-Target” Lesions
xAll measurable lesions up to a maximum of five lesions total wi th a maximum of 2 
lesions per organ, representative of all involved organs should be identified as target 
lesions and recorded and measured at baseline*.
xTarget lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (l esions with the longest 
diameter) and their suitability  for accurate repeated measureme nts (either by [CONTACT_894669]).
xA sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported 
as the baseline sum LD.  The baseline sum LD will be used as th e reference by [CONTACT_349126]. 
xAll other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as  non-target lesions and 
should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these les ions are not required, 
but the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout follow-up.
*In most circumstances, a radiology report alone is not sufficient for the purposes of documenting 
target lesion measurements at baseline.  The baseline images and images from each subsequent 
time point should be reviewed specifically according to RECIST 1.1 guidelines.

must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5mm.   
The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered 
pro
gression
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for  PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest su m 
LD since the treatment started
Evaluation of non-tar get lesions

10.2 Determination of Sample Size
Phase Ib
The sample size for this study was determined by [CONTACT_894670].  With 
cohort sizes of three to six patients, if the true underlying r ates of DLT are 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5, 
there will be 91%, 71%, 49%, 31%, and 17% chances, respectively , of escalating to the next full doses.
Phase II
There is no statistical hypothesis testing in the Phase II part  and the planned sample size of Phase II (20 
– 40 per cohort) is considered to be clinically adequate to asse ss tolerability, safety, and preliminary 
anti-cancer activity of study drugs of interest, and actual sam ple size depends on the actual enrollment 
in each arm.
Sample Size Justification for Thymic Carcinoma Cohort:
A total of 10 (minimum) to 15 (m aximum) patients will be target e d t o t hi s  c o hor t  a nd  a  B a ye s i an 
posterior probability approach will be employed to monitor the enrollment based on the overall 
response rate (ORR) by [CONTACT_10585] 16. A fter the first 10 patients hav e response evaluation, or withdraw, or 
die by [CONTACT_10585] 16, the Bayesian posterior probability of the ORR b eing greater than a target value will 
be continuously evaluated. If the  posterior probability is grea ter than 70% or less than 20%, then further 
enrollment may be stopped. Otherwise enrollment will continue un til the enrollment cap of [ADDRESS_1253621] the  mean equal to the historically 
observed ORR of 0.22 (Lemma 2011).

anti-tumor activity will be evaluated on an exploratory basis a nd will be summarized  using descriptive 
statistics or graphics.
For each tumor type, the following endpoints will be summarized : Objective response rate (ORR), 
defined as the proportion of pati ents with a documented complet e response (CR) or partial response 
(PR) based on RECIST 1.1; Disease Control Rate (DCR), defined a s the proportion of patients with 
documented CR, PR and stable disease (SD) based on RECIST 1.1; progression free survival (PFS),
defined as the time from enrollment until the first objective o bservation of disease progression or death 
from any cause; and overall survival (OS), defined as the time from enrollment until death from any

Instructions for Coll ecting and Processing Samples
Sampling to define the plasma pharmacokinetics of BBI608 and pa clitaxel will be performed 
for patients enrolled at selected study sites.  Samples are tak en on Day [ADDRESS_1253643] be started before 10 a.m. on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thur sday to facilitate the 
collection of the pharmacokinetic samples at the scheduled time s during the re gular operating 
hours of the outpatient clinics.  
Before starting the BBI 608 administration, p lace a large gauge peripheral cathete r (e.g., 1 9 or 20 
gauge angiocath straight set w ith T-connector, or similar IV acc ess device) within a vein in the 
arm of the subject for the collection of pharmacokinetic blood samples.  Patency of the sampling 
catheter should be maintained between blood draws using either a heparin lock (e.g., 10 U/mL 
in normal saline) or a slow drip of Normal Saline for Injection , USP (e.g., 10 mL/hr).  
Extraordinary caution should be taken to prevent hemolysis in t he blood sample.  Blood may 
be obtained directly by [CONTACT_894678] a single  pharmacokinetic blood 
specimen is scheduled for coll ection.  When sam pling through th e peripheral catheter, begin to 
clear the catheter approximately 1  min before the specified sam ple time by [CONTACT_894679] 0.5 mL of blood into a syringe.   Remove and properly dispose 
the syringe used to clear the catheter.
A battery-powered digital timer/stopwatch programmed to operate continuously as a 24-hr 
clock will be used to accurately  monitor drug administration an d sample collection times.  The 
same timer must be allowed to r un without interr uption until th e last blood specimen has been 
obtained from the subject during the first cycle of therapy.  T imer readings will be noted at the 
precise time that the administration is started as well as at t he beginning and ending times of 
the blood sample collection inte rvals.  Readings of the digital  timer must be directly recorded 
on a copy of the appropriate Phar macokinetic Dosing and Blood C ollection Time Form.  
Please note that blood and plasma must be protected from direct  exposure to light and all 
sample processing procedures are to be performed in a room with  indirect lighting.  The volume 
of blood collected for each pharm acokinetic sample will be [ADDRESS_1253644] it on wet ice, and centrifuge (1,100-1,300 x g, 10 min, 4 °C) within 5-10 min after 
collection.  Separate the plasm a from the blood cells using a p ipette and transfer approximately 
equal volumes into three 2 mL sel f-standing opaque amber polypro pylene microcentrifuge 
cryogenic tubes with external thr eads. Affix a pre-printed label  (protocol number, subject 
initials, subject number, sampl e collection date and time) to t he cryotube, oriented lengthwise

prohibited. Completely cover the label with protective cryogenic  freezer tape.  Place the tube 
on crushed dry-ice until stored  in a freezer maintained at d-70°C.  Any deviation from the 
sample collection time needs to b e documented in the study subje cts’ case report forms and in 
their study binder.
The total volume of blood coll ected for pharmacokinetic studies , 100-120 mL, represents < 
5% of the total blood volume for a [ADDRESS_1253645], during a 28-d ay treatment cycle.  As 
pharmacokinetic data becomes ava ilable during the course of the  trial, it may be necessary to 
modify the number of samples or the times at which they are col lected to more accurately 
define the plasma concentration-time profile of the drug.  Howe ver, the cumulative volume of 
blood collected for pharmacokine tic sampling will not exceed 24 0 mL, or approximately 5% 
of the total volum e of a [ADDRESS_1253646] 4 weeks  of study treatment.  
*Computer files for dose administr ation and sample collection t ime forms and specimen tube 
labels will be placed in a subdirectory located on a secure net work server.  All members of the 
clinical, laboratory, and administrative staff involved with ph ase Ib studies will be given read-
only access to this subdirectory.  The files are placed under t he following subdirectories:  
PK_Time_Forms; PK_Tube_Labels.  Files for the PK time forms are  printed directly from the 
file stored on the network server for each subject study.  Sinc e changes may be periodically

each subject studied, typi[INVESTIGATOR_894655]., is added  by [CONTACT_894680], then 
printed onto adhesive-backed labels.  Hand-written information on sample tube labels is 
absolutely prohibited.  There are separate sets of labels for b lood collection vials and sample 
storage tubes.  Blood collect ion vials are prelabeled.  
Time points will be determined as the difference between the mi dpoint of the blood collection 
interval and starting time of dose administration.  Concentrati on-time profiles of BBI608 and 
paclitaxel will be analyzed by [CONTACT_130171]/or nonlinear least squares 
regression using WinNonlin (Scientific Consulting, Inc.).  Phar macokinetic parameters and 
variables will be calculated according to standard equations.

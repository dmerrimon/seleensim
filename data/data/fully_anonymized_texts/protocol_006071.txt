STUDY RATIONALE  Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, 
is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly population. People 
progressing to AD develop distressing changes in memory, thought, 
function , and behavior, which worsen over time. These changes 
increasingly impact the person's daily life and reduce their 
independence until ultimately these pati ents are entirely dependent 
on others (Querfurth and LaFerla, 2010 ). Worldwide, it is estimated 
that about [ADDRESS_816785] dementia. Alzheimer’s disease 
accounts for 50 % to 80% of these patients  (Duthey, 2013 ). At 
early -stage AD, the epi[INVESTIGATOR_616016] (Gold and Budson, 2008 ). With the shift to wards an 
increasingly elderly population, it is predicted that the number of 
people affected by [CONTACT_37113] -stage AD that will progress to dementia will 
almost double every [ADDRESS_816786] the condition  (Duthey, 2013 ). Effective treatments 
for the devastating disease are urgently needed as the world’s 
population continues to age.  
The diagnosis of AD is generally based on consensus diagnostic 
criteria developed by [CONTACT_45429] -Alzheimer's 
Association (NIA -AA) (McKhann et al., 2011 ). These criteria are 
clinical in nature and require that patients must exhibit impairments 
in both cognitive  and functional domains. In the earliest clinical 
stages of AD, subtle cognitive deficits may be evident only through 
use of sensitive measures of neuropsychological performance. 
Thereafter, but before developi[INVESTIGATOR_616017], patients proceed 
through a clinical phase where cognition becomes increasingly 
affected and relatively mild but detectable impairments in some 
functional abilities emerge as well.  
The hallmark pathological feature of AD is the presence of brain 
Protocol Version 7  Date: 10 April  2017  Identification: NEUP11 -AD2  Page 5/92 
 
 
 plaques, consisting primarily of β -amyloid peptide (Aβ) aggregates 
(Selkoe, 2002 ). Accordingly, the abnormal production and 
aggregation of Aβ, associated particularly with late -stage disease, 
has been the principal target of many drug development efforts. 
However, [ADDRESS_816787] been made 
too late in the progression of disease, at a stage when neuronal 
damage had become too widespread, and there fore more trials now 
focus on patients in whom overt dementia seems imminent. An ideal 
drug for such patients will improve neuropsychological performance 
and functional abilities, slow down Aβ buildup, and promote 
neuroprotection and neurogenesis.  
The investigational compound, N -(2-(5-methoxy -1H-indol -3-
yl)ethyl) -4-oxo-4H-pyran -2-carboxamide (pi[INVESTIGATOR_616014]) is a novel 
melatonin MT1, 2, and [ADDRESS_816788] with a different proposed mechanism of action than currently 
avail able AD medications. Through this unique molecular mode of 
action, pi[INVESTIGATOR_616018] (Buendia et al., 2014 , Tang et al., 2012 ), memory 
enhancing (He et al., 2013 , Tian et al., 2010 ), sleep promoting (Liu 
et al., 2014 ), and neurogeneration enhancing capabilities (Tian et al ., 
2015 unpublished) with relevance to AD risk factors, comorbidities , 
and symptoms. The 5HT -1a agonists have demon strated 
neuroprotective effects (Kline et al., 2004 ) by [CONTACT_616148] (Banasr et al., 200 4, 
Islam et al., 2014 ) and increase slow wave sleep (SWS)  specifically 
by [CONTACT_616149] (Muraki et al., 2004 , 
Tabuchi et al., 2013 ). Simultaneous activation of melatonergic and 
5HT-1a receptors may synergistically promote neurogenesis (Fava et 
al., 2012 ). 
The sleep enhancing capacities of pi[INVESTIGATOR_616019]. Recent clinical and biochemical 
evidence has identified an interesting lin k between sleep, Aβ, 
cognitive dysfunction , and AD. In mice, Aβ clearance through the 
glymphatic system (the biomolecule clearance system operating the 
convective flow between the cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] [CSF] and 
interstitial fluid to remove toxic metabolites ) is strongly stimulated 
by [CONTACT_55628] (Mendelsohn and Larrick, 2013 , Xie et al., 2013 ). 
Bidirectional relationships between sleep and Aβ production have 
been demonstrated in mice overexpressing Aβ (Roh et al., 2012 ). In 
humans, normal soluble Aβ concentrations in the CSF fluctuate with 
the sleep -wake cycle with 6 hours delay (Huang et al., 2012 ). 
Disruption of non -rapid eye movement ( NREM) SWS resulted in 
impaired overnight consolidation of long -term memory in healthy 
older adults (Mander et al., 2015 ). Since Aβ production is highest at 
times of neural activity  such as during wakefulness and lowest at 
times of decreased neural activity such as during SWS, sleep

 disturbances accompanied by [CONTACT_616150] Aβ, increased Aβ aggregation, and 
attenuation of the Aβ diur nal pattern characterizing AD (Lucey and 
Bateman, 2014 ). Bidirectional relations between Aβ pathology and 
NREM sleep physiology were observed also in patients with mild 
cognitive impairmen t (MCI) and AD. In MCI patients the reduction 
in SWS was associated with deficits in sleep dependent memory 
consolidation (Pace -Schott and Spencer, 201 5). Moreover, MCI 
patients had modified sleep structure characterized by [CONTACT_616151] ∆ and Θ power as compared to controls 
(Westerberg et al., 2012 ). In AD patients, higher SWS was positively 
associated with retrieval of recent autobiographical memories 
(Rauchs et al., 2013 ). 
Indeed, 63% of the patients with subtle cognitive deficits (also 
termed MCIs ) (McKinnon et al., 2014 ) and 44% of the patients 
diagnosed with AD (Vitiello and Borson, 2001 ) demonstrate sleep 
disturbances as determined using the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_10797] 
(PSQI). More recently , neuropathological analyses revealed a 
positive correlation between total sleep time, sleep quality, and s leep 
onset latency in demented and nondemented older adults with higher 
Aβ burden in specific brain areas that are linked to early AD (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_616020]., 2013 ). Accordingly, deterioration in cognition from healthy 
controls through MCI to AD patients was associated with parallel 
deterioration in sleep (Economou et al., 2013 ). The presence of 
insomnia may thus help identify patients with early signs of AD who 
are at a gre ater risk of deteriorating to dementia.  
The relation becomes evident as poor sleep is directly associated 
with cognitive decline in healthy (Miyata et al., 2013 ) cognitively 
impaired (McKinnon et al., 2014 ) and demented adult populations 
(Vitiello et al., 1990 ), including AD (Carpenter et al., 199 6, 
McCurry et al., 1999 ). Further exploration of interventions that 
promote NREM SWS and minimize the progression of 
neurodegeneration and the cognitive dysfunction associated with Aβ 
pathology is needed (Mander et al., 2015 ). 
Importantly, the mechanism of sleep induction appears to be of key 
importance for the sought cognitive effects. Long -term use of 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_616021] d with an increased risk of dementia 
(Billioti de Gage et al., 2012 ) and AD (Billioti de Gage et al., 2014 , 
Yaffe a nd Boustani, 2014 ), presumably because of the known 
suppression of NREM SWS by [CONTACT_24658][INVESTIGATOR_616022] (Arbon et al., 2015 ). Treatment of 
patients with AD suffering from sleep disturbances with traditional 
hypnotics is associated with increased risk for a wide range of 
injuries (Chung et al., 2013 , Diem et al., 2014 ) and may actually 
worsen their cognition and memory (Hall-Porter et al., 2014 ). In 
contrast, melatonin  receptor agonism , which maintains the NREM 
SWS (Arbon et al., 2015 ), appears beneficial for cognition and 
functioning in mild to moderate AD patients (Wade et al., 2014 ). 
In a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers, pi[INVESTIGATOR_616014] (2, 5, 20, 50, 
Protocol Version 7  Date: 10 April  2017  Identification: NEUP11 -AD2  Page 7/92 
 
 
 and 200 mg) was found to be safe and well tolerated with no serious 
adverse events (SAE s) and showed a favorable, dose -proportional 
pharmacokinetic (PK) profile following oral intake. In addition, 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_616023] a dose -dependent manner (Yalkinoglu 
et al., 2010 ). In a Phase 1b multiple ascending dose study in 
insomnia patients, pi[INVESTIGATOR_616014] (2, 5, 20, and 50 mg) had a favorable  
PK profile without any sign of accumulation. This study also 
suggested dose -dependent beneficial effects of pi[INVESTIGATOR_616024]. Importantly, in this study pi[INVESTIGATOR_616025] [ADDRESS_816789] -pair association  task (Laudon et al., 2012 ). 
In a Phase 2, randomized, placebo -controlled, sleep laboratory study 
in ins omnia patients (aged 18 -80), pi[INVESTIGATOR_616014] (20 mg and 50 mg 
daily for 1 month) enhanced sleep maintenance (wake after sleep 
onset [WASO]) measured by [CONTACT_25899] (PSG) significantly 
in comparison to placebo (Neurim press release, 2013). Pi[INVESTIGATOR_616026] ∆ power (NREM SWS) and decreased NREM β 
power, a fast electroencephalogram (EEG) activity that is considered 
to be related to the hyperarousal state experienced by [CONTACT_616152] (Merica et al., 1998 ). Both effects may be beneficial for 
early AD and AD patients to enhance Aβ clearance from the brain 
(Grandy, 2013 ). Overall, pi[INVESTIGATOR_616027]. There were no SAEs during the conduct of this study. 
Adverse event (AE) rates during double -blind treatment with study 
medication were low (6.7% in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_616014] 20 mg group, 0% in 
the pi[INVESTIGATOR_616028] 50  mg and placebo groups). Laboratory values were 
within normal ranges. No clinically meaningful changes in vital 
signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), or physical examinations were 
observed. No suicidal behavior or suicidal ideation (Columbia 
Suicide  Severity Rating Scale [CSSRS]) was recorded at any time 
during the study.  
Altogether, through its action at melatonin  receptors, pi[INVESTIGATOR_616029], circadian rhythms control , and, subsequently , 
cognition in the patients (Wade et al., 2014 ). Throu gh the 
serotonergic mechanism , pi[INVESTIGATOR_616030] (Rodríguez et al., 2012 ), enhance SWS, and reduce 
wakefulness (Bjorvatn and Ursin, 1998 , Monti and Monti, 2000 ). 
Through the combined activation of melatonergic and 5HT -1a 
receptors, pi[INVESTIGATOR_616031] (Fava et al., 2012 ). 
This study is a Phase 2, randomized, placebo -controlled, 
dose-ranging study of pi[INVESTIGATOR_616014] (5, 20, and 50 mg daily for 
6 months) versus placebo to determine an effective dose to take 
forward to Phase 3 studies based on efficacy (cognitive 
performance), safety , and tolerability in patients with mild dementia 
due to AD.

Screening (a s core of 27 is allowed  only if accompanied by a score of 
≥ 12 in the ADAS -cog11 portion of the ADAS -cog14 at Screening ), 
and a Clinical Dementia Rating Global S core (CDR -GS) of 0.5 or  1 
will be recruited and further screened for eligibility . Caregiver 
commitment for the study is also necessary.  
At Screening (Visit 1), patients w ill undergo neuropsychiatric 
assessments, psychometric testing , and general medical assessments 
(including medical history, pre -existing conditions, physical 
examination, vital signs , and ECG). If patients have not had brain 
imaging  with findings consisten t with the diagnosis of dementia due 
to AD in the last 12 months , a computed tomography (CT) or 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan will be obtained to rule out 
clinically significant comorbid pathologies.  
Eligible patients will start a 2 -week run -in period of placebo (single 
blind), followed by 26 weeks of double -blind treatment comprising 
administration of pi[INVESTIGATOR_616034], for a total treatment 
duration of 28 weeks. During the double -blind period, patients will be 
enrolled in a 1.2:1:1:1 rand omization ratio to the 4 trial arms (placebo 
[1.2], and the equal pi[INVESTIGATOR_616035] 5, 20, and 50  mg 
[1:1:1]).

elicit any safety concerns will be completed [ADDRESS_816801] 
dose of study medication. Patients who discontinue prior to Visit  5 
(Week 26) will be brought back for a termination visit.  
Assuming an effect size between treatment dose and placebo of 0.35 
over 26 weeks, a significant level (α) of 0.05, and power of 88%, a 
sample size of 143 patients for the placebo arm and 119  patients for 
each of the 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_616036]. Assuming a 50% screen 
failure rate and allowing for 15% patient withdrawa l, 1150 patients 
should be screened in order to randomly assign 575 patients, of whom 
it is expected 500 will complete the study.  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_616014] (5, 20 , and 50 mg tablets) and placebo will be 
administered orally, once daily after a meal, before habitual bedtime , 
preferably between 2100h and 2300h. Patients will be required to

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
 The cNTB global composite score (ISLT immediate and delayed 
recall, OCL, identification, detection, and OBK) will be summarized 
at baseline and after 4, 13, and 26 weeks of double -blind treatment 
(actual and change from baseline) for each treatment group using 
descriptive statistics (n,  mean, SD, median, minimum, and 
maximum). The primary efficacy analysis will be carried out using an 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment and study 
site as the main effects and baseline cNTB global z -score as the 
covar iate. To evaluate the effect of missing cNTB items, multiple 
imputations will be used for the calculation of cNTB composite scores 
in the case of 1 or 2 missing cNTB items.  
Secondary efficacy analyses will be carried out using a mixed -effects 
maximum likel ihood repeated measures (MMRM) model utilizing all 
baseline and postbaseline data  to assess any differences in treatment 
effects over time . The model shall include fixed effects of treatment, 
study site, visit, and treatment by [CONTACT_23259], with base line score 
as a covariate, and a baseline by [CONTACT_23259].  The global treatment

 8. INTRODUCTION  
Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder , is the leading cause of 
dementia in the elderly population. People progressing to A D develop distressing changes in 
memory, thought, function , and behavior, which worsen over time. These changes increasingly 
impact t he person's daily life and reduce their independence until ultimately these patients are 
entirely dependent on others (Querfurth and LaFerla, 2010 ). Worldwide, it is estimated that 
about [ADDRESS_816830] dementia. A lzheimer’s disease  accounts for 50 % to 80% of these 
patients  (Duthey, 2013 ). At early-stage AD , the epi[INVESTIGATOR_616045] (Gold and Budson, 2008 ). With the shift towards an increasingly elderly population, 
it is predicted that the number of people affected by [CONTACT_37113]-stage AD that will progress to 
dementia will almost double every [ADDRESS_816831] 
the condition  (Duthey, 2013 ). Effective treatments for the devastating disease are urgently 
needed as the world’s population continues to age.  
The diagnosis of AD is generally bas ed on consensus diagnostic criteria developed by [CONTACT_214493] -Alzheimer's Association (NIA -AA) (McKhann et al., 2011 ). These 
criteria are clinical in n ature and require that patients must exhibit impairments in both cognitive 
and functional domains. In the earliest clinical stages of AD, subtle cognitive deficits may be 
evident only through use of sensitive measures of neuropsychological performance. The reafter, 
but before developi[INVESTIGATOR_616017], patients proceed through a clinical phase where cognition 
becomes increasingly affected and relatively mild but detectable impairments in some functional 
abilities emerge as well.  
The hallmark pathological fea ture of AD is the presence of brain plaques, consisting primarily of 
β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) aggregates (Selkoe, 2002 ). Accordingly, the abnormal production and 
aggregation of Aβ, associated particularly with late -stage disease, has been the principal target of 
many dr ug development efforts. However, [ADDRESS_816832] been made too late in the progression of dis ease, at a stage 
when neuronal damage had become too widespread , and therefore more trials now focus on 
patients in whom overt dementia seems imminent. An ideal drug for such patients will improve 
neuropsychological performance and functional abilities, sl ow down Aβ buildup, and promote 
neuroprotection and neurogenesis.  
The investigational compound, N -(2-(5-methoxy -1H-indol -3-yl)ethyl) -4-oxo-4H-pyran -2-
carboxamide ( pi[INVESTIGATOR_616014]) is a novel melatonin MT1, [ADDRESS_816833] with a different proposed mechanism of action than currently available AD 
medications. Through this unique molecular mode of action , pi[INVESTIGATOR_616046] (Buendia et al., 2014 , Tang et al., 2012 ), memory 
enhancing (He et al., 2013 , Tian et al., 2010 ), sleep promoting (Liu et al., 2014 ), and 
neurogeneration enhancing capabilities (Tian et al ., 2015 unpublished) with relevance to AD risk 
factors, comorbidities , and symptoms. The 5HT-1a agonists ha ve demonstrated neuroprotective 
effects (Kline et al., 2004 ) by [CONTACT_616164] (Banasr et al., 
2004, Islam et al., 2014 ) and increase slow wave sleep ( SWS ) specifically by [CONTACT_616165] 7  Date: 10 April  2017  Identification: NEUP11 -AD2  Page 26/92 
 
 
 (Muraki et al., 2004 , Tabuchi et al., 2013 ). Simultaneous activation of melatonergic and 5HT -1a 
receptors may synergistically promote neurogenesis (Fava et al., 2012 ). 
The sleep enhancing capacities of pi[INVESTIGATOR_616047]. 
Recent clinical and biochemical evidence has identified an interesting link between sleep, Aβ, 
cognitive dysfunction , and A D. In mice, Aβ clearance through the glymphatic system (the 
biomolecule clearance system operating the convective flow between the cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] 
[CSF] and interstitial fluid to remove toxic metabolites) is strongly stimulated by [CONTACT_55628] 
(Mendelsohn and Larrick, 2013 , Xie et al., 2013 ). Bidirectional relationships between sleep and 
Aβ production have been demonstrated in mice overexpressing Aβ (Roh et al., 2012 ). In humans, 
normal soluble Aβ concentrations  in the CSF fluctuate with the sleep -wake cycle with 6 hours 
delay (Huang et al., 2012 ). Disruption of non-rapid eye movement (N REM ) SWS resulted in 
impaired overnight consolida tion of long -term memory in healthy older adults (Mander et al., 
2015 ). Since Aβ production is highest at times of neural activity such as during wakefulness and 
lowest at times of decreased neural activity such as during SWS, sleep disturbances accompanied 
by [CONTACT_616166] Aβ, increased Aβ 
aggregation , and attenuation of the Aβ diurnal pattern characterizing AD (Lucey and Bateman, 
2014 ). Bidirection al relations between Aβ pathology and NREM sleep physiology were observed 
also in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. In MCI patients the reduction in 
SWS was associated with deficits in sleep dependent memory consolidation (Pace -Schott and 
Spencer, 201 5). Moreover, MCI patients had modified sleep structure characterized by [CONTACT_616167] ∆ and Θ power as compared to controls (Westerberg et al., 2012 ). 
In AD patients, higher SWS was positively associated with retrieval of recent autobiographical 
memories (Rauchs et al., 2013 ). 
Indeed, 63% of the patients with subtle cognitive deficits (also termed MCIs ) (McKinnon et al., 
2014 ) and 44% of the patients diagnosed with AD (Vitiello and Borson, 2001 ) demonstrate sleep 
disturbances as determined using the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_524818] (PSQI). More recently , 
neuropathological analyses revealed a po sitive correlation between total sleep time, sleep quality , 
and sleep onset latency in demented and nondemented older adults with higher Aβ burden in 
specific brain areas that are linked to early AD (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_120330]., 2013 ). Accordingly, deterioration in 
cognition from healthy controls through MCI to AD patients was associated with parallel 
deterioration in sleep (Economou et al., 2013 ). The presence of insomnia may thus help identify 
patients with early signs  of AD who are at a greater risk of deteriorating to dementia.  
The relation becomes evident as poor sleep is directly associated with cognitive decline in 
healthy (Miyata et al., 2013 ) cognitively impaired (McKinnon et al., 2014 ), and demented adult 
populations (Vitiello et al., 1990 ), including AD (Carpenter et al., 199 6, McCurry et al., 1999 ). 
Further exploration of interventions that promote NREM SWS  and minimize the progression of 
neurodegeneration and the cognitive dy sfunction associated with Aβ pathology is  needed  
(Mander et al., 2015 ). 
Importantly, the mechanism of sleep induction appears to be of key importance for the sought 
cognitive effec ts. Long -term use of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_616048] (Billioti de Gage et al., 2012 ) and AD (Billioti de Gage et al., 2014 , Yaffe and 
Boustani, 2014 ), presumably because of the known suppression of NREM  SWS by 
[CONTACT_24658][INVESTIGATOR_616049] (Arbon et al., 2015 ). Treatment of patients 
with AD suffering from sleep disturbances with traditional hypnotics is associated with increased 
risk for a wide range of injuries (Chung et al., 2013 , Diem et al., 2014 ) and may actually worsen 
Protocol Version 7  Date: 10 April  2017  Identification: NEUP11 -AD2  Page 27/92 
 
 
 their cognition and memory (Hall-Porter et al., 2014 ). In contrast, melatonin receptor agonism , 
which maintains the NREM SWS (Arbon et al., 2015 ), appears beneficial for cognition and 
functioning in mild to moderate AD patients (Wade et al., 2014 ). 
In a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers, pi[INVESTIGATOR_616014] (2, 5, 20, 50, and 200 mg) was found to be 
safe and well tolerated with no serious adverse events  (SAEs)  and showed a favorable, 
dose-proportional pharmacokinetic (PK) profile following oral intake. In addition, pi[INVESTIGATOR_616050] a 
dose-dependent manner (Yalkinoglu et al., 2010 ). In a Phase 1b multiple ascending dose study in 
insomnia patients , pi[INVESTIGATOR_616014] (2,  5, 20, and 50 mg) had a favorable PK profile without any sign 
of accumulation. This study also suggested dose -dependent beneficial effects of pi[INVESTIGATOR_616051]. Importantly, in this study pi[INVESTIGATOR_616052] [ADDRESS_816834] -pair association task (Laudon et al., 2012 ). In a Phase 2,

Protocol Version 7  Date: 10 April  2017  Identification: NEUP11 -AD2  Page 34/[ADDRESS_816854] s are expected to be seen after 26 weeks of treatment as has been shown 
previously with melatonin administered to a similar population of patients (Wade et al., 2014 ). 
The cognitive outcome measure mostly used in AD clinical trial s, the ADAS -cog, is a scale 
based on a series of items that assess different aspects of cognitive function known to be relevant 
to the cognitive dysfunction that characterizes AD (Greenberg e t al., 2013 ). However , over the 
past [ADDRESS_816855] poor sensitivity in discerning cognitive 
change in patients with MCI and early AD (Gold, 2007 ; Greenberg et al., 2013 ; Grundman et al., 
2004 ; Sevigny et al., 2010 ). Given the importance of formal neuropsychological approaches to 
the diagnosis and management of AD in patie nts with mild and moderate AD, several 
neuropsychological tests h ave been combined to construct a Neuropsychological Test Battery 
(NTB) (Harrison et al., 2007 ). In accord with the approaches to constructing the NTB for clinical 
trials in AD, the tests to be used in the NTB for this study have been selected on the basis of  the 
following:  
a) demonstrated validity for the target cognitive domain  
b) demonstrated acceptability in patients with some diminished intellectual function due to 
AD 
c) acceptable estimates of test -retest reliability in patients with AD  
d) demonstrated sensitivity to cog nitive change in AD (eg, related to drug effects or disease 
progression)  
Dosage specification was made on the basis of previous studies and the relative affinity to the 
melatonin and serotonin receptors.  
The parallel dosing regimen maximizes the ability to  make direct comparison between the active 
treatment groups and placebo.  
The use of placebo allows for a blinded, thus minimally biased, study. The placebo group is a 
comparator group for efficacy and safety assessment.  
Within -subject variation in psychome tric test scores is common in AD patients. This could be the 
result of measurement error or reflection of the fluctuation in the patient’s condition. Both cases 
may influence the final score. The first problem of rater errors will be addressed  by [CONTACT_616172] -time monitoring of rater performances. In addition, in 
order to avoid habituation problem s, all patients will receive a practice assessment prior to their 
baseline  measurements  (NTB and ADAS -cog14). 
10.3.  SAFETY MONITORING AND  DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING BO ARD  
Safety data will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_456]  (Neurim Pharmaceuticals 
[1991] Ltd)  and the medical monitor. Safety data will also be reviewed on an ongoing basis by 
[CONTACT_616173] ( DSMB ). The DSMB will be assembled to 
review safety  and tolerability data collected during the study . Based on its ongoing assessment of

withdrawn  from the study prior to receipt of any study medication.  
Protocol Version 7  Date: 10 April  2017  Identification: NEUP11 -AD2  Page 41/92 
 
 
 Patients withdrawn from the study prior to randomization would be considered as “screen 
failure .” 
Patients withdrawn from the study after randomization would be considered as “drop -out.” 
Patient s may withdraw their consent at any time during the study or may be withdrawn by [CONTACT_616179]. Neurim Pharmaceuticals (1991) Ltd reserves the right to withdraw 
patient s from the study on the grounds that a serious protocol violation has occ urred. In case of 
dispute, the principal investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_616060].  
The date and reason for withdrawal as well as the data collected up to that time should be 
recorded in the electronic case report form ( eCRF).  
Patient s who withdraw from the stud y after receiving any study medication will be required to 
return to  the study site for a Premature Discontinuation Visit for safety assessments to be 
performed. Once a patient  has been withdrawn , he/she may not re -enter the study, and the 
medication that was designated for this patient  cannot be given to any other patient .

 12. TREATMENTS  
12.1 TREATMENTS ADMINISTE RED  
Throughout the study, all study medication is to be administered orally, 1 tablet daily, taken 
before going to bed , preferably between  2100h and 2300h , and after food consumption.  
Upon completion of the 2 -week, single -blind run-in period,  patient s will be random ly assigned  in 
a 1.2 :1:1:1 ratio to placebo (1.2) or to 1 of 3 active treatment arms  (1:1:1)  as follows:  
Active Medication  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_616014] 5, 20, or [ADDRESS_816867] all unused medication packs together with 
any study medicati on that has not been allocated to  the clinical supply vendor for destruction . 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_616061] d. Tablets will be packaged in polyethylene 
terephthalate bottles  containing 35 tablets. Patient s will receive sufficient medication at the 
randomization  visit (Visit 2) to provide enough  tablets for the period  of treatment between visits 
to allow for loss of tablets and for arrival at the  scheduled visit up to 3 days after the scheduled 
date. For the period between Visit 2 (randomization) and Visit 3 ( Week 4) , each patient will 
receive 1 bottle with 35  tablets. For the period between Visit 3 (Week 4) and Visit 4 (Week 13), 
each patient will receive 2 bottle s containing  35 tablets each ( total of 70 tablets). For the period 
between Visit 4 (Week 13) and Visit 5 (Week 26), each patient will receive 3 bottle s contain ing 
35 tablets  each (total of 105 tablets).

 to be kept at ro om temperature (15°C-25°C, or 59 °F-77°F ). The study medication may not be 
used for any purpose other than the present study ; the insurance coverage shall otherwise become 
null and void.  
12.2.2  Placebo  
The placebo is of identical appearance and formulation to the active pi[INVESTIGATOR_616066] . 
12.2.3  Labelling Information  
The study medication bottles  will be labeled according to US Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA ) requirements. The labeling on all bottles of study medication will include  the following : 
name [CONTACT_119019] , pharmaceutical dosage form , route of administration , quantity of dosage units , 
batch numbers , bottle number, study number , patient  ID number , directions for use , “for clinical 
trial use only” , investi gator name , storage method , the statement “keep out of reach of children ,” 
and “Caution: New Drug – Limited by [CONTACT_142193] (US) to investigational use .” 
12.3 SELECTION OF DOSE  IN THE STUDY  
The choice of doses (5 , 20, and 50 mg) to be orally administered in AD patients is defined 
according to the following clinical data . 
In a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers, pi[INVESTIGATOR_616014] (2, 5, 20, 50, and 200 mg) was found to be 
safe and well tolerated with no SAE s and showed a favorable,  dose-proportional PK profile 
following oral intake. In addition, pi[INVESTIGATOR_616067] a dose -dependent manner  (Yalkinoglu et al., 2010 ). In a Phase 1b 
multiple ascending dose study in insomnia patients , pi[INVESTIGATOR_616014] (2,  5, 20, and 50 mg) had a 
favorable PK profile without any sign of accumulation. This stud y also showed that pi[INVESTIGATOR_616068] (Laudon et al., 2012 ). In a Phase 2, randomized , placebo -controlled , sleep laboratory 
study in insomnia patients (age d 18-80 years ), pi[INVESTIGATOR_616014] (20 and 50 mg daily  for 1 month) 
enhanced sleep maintenance (WASO) measured by [CONTACT_616180] 
(Neurim press release , 2013 ). Pi[INVESTIGATOR_616069] N REM ∆ power (deep sleep) and decreased 
NREM β power, a fast EEG activity that is considered to be related to the hyperarousal state 
experienced by [CONTACT_616168] (Merica et al., 1998 ). Both effects may be beneficial for AD 
patients to enhance Aβ clearance from the brain.  
12.4 METHOD OF ASSIGNING PATIENT S TO TREATMENT GROUP S 
Commencing at Visit 1, all patients will be assigned an identification number. This identification 
number and the pa tient’s [ADDRESS_816868] dose of placebo that evening. 
After 2 weeks of single -blind placebo run -in, the patient  will be random ly assigned  to receive 
Protocol Version 7  Date: 10 April  2017  Identification: NEUP11 -AD2  Page 44/92 
 
 
 either pi[INVESTIGATOR_616014] (5 , 20, or 50 mg)  or placebo. The patient  will take the first dose of 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_616014] /placebo in the evening of Visit 2. The dose of medication will be 1 tablet daily  in 
the evening after meals, before going to bed, preferably between  2100h and 2300h . 
12.6 DOSE ADJUSTMENT CRIT ERIA  
The dose will not change throughout the 26-week randomized double -blind treatment period.  
12.7 BLINDING  
The initial 2-week run -in period of this study is designed as single blind, with the patient  blinded 
to the medication he/she is  receiving. All patient s will receive placebo during the run -in period . 
The run -in will be followed by 26 weeks of double -blind treatment, where the investigator s, 
staff, and patient s will be unaware of the alloc ated treatment.  
The blinding will not be broken (unless in an emergency) until all completed eCRFs have been 
received by [CONTACT_616181].  
In case of an emergency, the investigator m ay access patient treatment assignment through the 
interactive web response system ( IWRS ). This will be done only when the investigator decides 
that knowledge  of the treatment arm  is required. Except in emergency cases, treatment 
assignment should not be a ccessed  without discussion with the sponsor's safety officer. The date 
and reasons for  accessing treatment  assignment must be fully documented , and a  statement that 
the correct procedure was followed should be documented in the trial master file . 
12.8 GENETIC TESTING FOR APOE 4 STATUS  
Genetic testing for apolipoprotein E (APOE4) status is voluntary. Retrospective genetic 
information could be used. Patients requiring a blood test for APOE [ADDRESS_816869] should be performed during  the patient’s  last visit . 
12.[ADDRESS_816870] 6 months before Baseline (Visit 2), t he daily dose must have re mained 
unchanged for [ADDRESS_816871] be agreeable to not starting it 
throughout the study.  
Patients taking memantine (with or without acetylcholinesterase inhibitors) must be on a stable 
dose for at least [ADDRESS_816872] 3 months before the  
Screening visit  (Visit 1)  and throughout the study . 
The following medications are not allowed during the study or during the 5 weeks before the 
Screening visit (Visit 1) : 
Protocol Version 7  Date: 10 April  2017  Identification: NEUP11 -AD2  Page 45/[ADDRESS_816873] of prohibited medication is listed in Section 24 , APPENDIX  2 “PROHIBITED 
AND RESTRICTED MEDICATIONS .” 
Patients taking alternative pharmacotherapy for dementia (eg, Souvenaid, DHA 
[docosahexaenoic acid], phosphatidylserine, omega -3 fatty acids , ginkgo biloba, ginseng, 
Huperzia serrata, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, or any other supplement to improve cognitive 
function) should be on a stable dose f or at least 3 months before the Screening visit (Visit 1).  
Other n ecessary and permitted concomitant treatment should not be altered if it has been 
established and equilibrated for at least 4 weeks  prior to study enrol lment , unless the 
investigator(s) consider(s) that a change is necessary. This should first be discussed with the 
sponsor's safety officer who will assess whether the patient  is to be withdrawn.  
Continuous use of sedative -hypnotics or treatments used as a hypno tic (eg , all benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] s, 
zopi[INVESTIGATOR_11123], zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_616070], barbiturates, buspi[INVESTIGATOR_616071] , melato nin or 
melatonin agonists [ ramelteon ]) is not allowed during the study or during the 2 weeks before the 
Screening visit (Visit 1) . 
12.9.1 Rescue Medication  
Intermittent  use of short to medium -acting benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] , melatonin (up to 3 mg), ramelteon 
(up to 8 mg), eszopi[INVESTIGATOR_11123] (up to 2 mg), zaleplon (up to 5 mg) or zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_252211] (≤  6.25 mg 
controlled release and ≤  10 mg tablet) is allowed when ab solutely necessary for intermittent 
sleep disturbances . Intermittent  use is defined as no more than 2 times a week. However , these 
medications cannot be used within 3  days of any study visit.  
12.10 TREATMENT COMPLIANCE  
Treatment compliance will be calculated at each study visit by [CONTACT_616182]:  
Compliance (%) =  number of tablets actually taken   [ADDRESS_816874] visit  
Compliance between Visit 1 and Visit 2 should be calculated using number  of days since start of 
run-in. 
Any divergence from the accepted level of compliance (70% -130% of expected consumption) is 
to be investigated by [CONTACT_616183].  
Treatment compliance will be recorded in the eCRF by [CONTACT_093].

13.1 CLINICAL  EFFICACY PARAMETERS  
13.1.1  Primary Efficacy Parameter  
The primary efficacy parameter is the c NTB ( global  composite of [ADDRESS_816876] scores ): 
1. Visual recognition learning task ( OCL ): The OCL task is a continuous visual recognition 
learning  task that assesses visual learning within a pattern separation model. Theoretical 
models of the pattern separation model specify that information is organized in 
orthogonal and distinct nonoverlappi[INVESTIGATOR_616075]. The OCL has been shown to be a valid test of 
learning and memory in MCI and AD. In this task , the patient must attend to the card in 
Protocol Version 7  Date: 10 April  2017  Identification: NEUP11 -AD2  Page 52/92 
 
 
 the center of the screen and respond to the question , “Have you seen this card before in 
this ta sk?” If the answer is yes, patients are instructed to press the “YES” button, and the 
“NO” button if the answer is no. Normal playing cards are displayed (without joker 
cards). In this task, 4 cards are drawn at random from the deck and are repeated 
throughout the task. These 4 cards are interspersed with distractors (nonrepeating cards). 
The task ends after [ADDRESS_816877] answers 
(accuracy), which is normalized using an arcsine square root transformation.  
2. Verbal Learning Task ( ISLT  – immediate and delayed ): The ISLT  is a 
computer -controlled verbal learning test. In this test , patients are read a list of [ADDRESS_816878] is a concrete noun and describes an item of food that is found commonly in 
the culture/society in which testing is occurring. The examiner asks the patient “I am 
going to read to you a list of item s I want you to get from the 
supermarket/store/market/shop etc .” After the [ADDRESS_816879] been read, the patient  is 
asked to recall as many of the words as he/she can. If he/she  can recall no more words , 
the same list is read a second time with the words in  the same order after the same 
instruction. The process of reading the list and waiting for responses occurs 3 times. At 
the completion of the computerized battery , the patient  is asked to recall as many of the 
items as he/she can from the shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_321579]. T his provides a measure of delayed recall. 
The primary performance measure for this task is the total number of correct words 
recalled . 
3. Detection task : The Cogstate Detection task is a measure of simple reaction time and has 
been shown to provide a valid assessment of psychomotor function in healthy adults and 
in adults with MCI and AD. For this test, the patient  must press a “YES” response key as 
soon as he/she  detect s an event (ie , a card turning face up presented in the cent er of the 
computer screen). The software measures the response time to detect each event.  
4. Identification task : The Cogstate Identification task is a measure of choice reaction time  
and has been shown to provide a valid assessment of visual attention in MCI and AD. In 
this task an event (a card turning face up) occurs in the cent er of the computer screen and 
the patient  must decide “YES” or “NO” as to whether this event meets a prede fined and 
unchanging criterion ( eg, is the color of the card red?). The software measures the speed 
and accuracy of each response.  
5. Computerized One Back Working Memory task  (OBK) : The Cogstate One B ack 
memory task is a valid measure of working memory in MC I and AD. On this task the 
patient is shown a single stimulus in the cent er of the computer screen (a card turns face 
up). The  patient  must decide “YES” or “NO” as to whether the current card matches the 
card that had been seen on the immediately previous trial. The software measures the 
speed and accuracy of each response . 
13.1.2  Secondary Efficacy P arameters  
CGIC  
The ADCS -CGIC is a systematic method for assessing clinically significant change in a clinical 
trial as viewed by [CONTACT_124531]. The ADCS -CGIC focuses on 
clinicians' observations of change in the patient's cognitive, functional, and behavioral 
Protocol Version 7  Date: 10 April  2017  Identification: NEUP11 -AD2  Page 53/[ADDRESS_816880] examination of the patient and 
interview of infor mants. Unlike a targeted symptom scale, it takes into account a patient's overall 
function in the cognitive, behavioral,  and functional activity domains. Scoring is based on an 
interview with the caregiver and examination of the patient by [CONTACT_10981] e valuator, without 
consulting other information such as cognitive test results. The ADCS -CGIC requires the 
assessor to consider a number of cognitive, functional, and behavioral areas prior to providing an 
overall "global" assessment of clinical change (Schneider et al., 1997 ; Schneider et al., 2006 ). 
The ADCS -CGIC assessor must be blinded to all other data for the p atient after Visit 2.  
Daily living activity (ADCS -MCI -ADL)  
The ADCS -MCI -ADL is one out of several available measurements of the Activities of Daily 
Living ( ADL ) in the targeted study population (Gold, 2012 ), and it  is based on the work of the 
ADCS operating  in the US (Galasko et al., 2006 ). The ADCS -MCI -ADL is an 18 -item 
interview –based assessment  (question s 19-24 are not to be completed) , and its ratings will be 
based on an interview of the patient’s best (closest) informant by a rater from the clinic. Scale 
administration duration will be about [ADDRESS_816881] comprises 
11 items summed to a total score ranging from 0 to 70, with lower scores indicating less severe 
impairment. A negative change indicates an improvement from baseline. The addition of delayed 
recall, number cancelation , and maze tasks – and thus turning ADAS -cog into a 12 -, 13-, and 
14-item scale respectively  – has increased the ability to detect changes in patients in the early 
stages of the disease (Sano et al., 2011 ). 
Global Composite Score of the cNTB (composite of [ADDRESS_816882] scores)  
The global composite score  of the cNTB is a composite score of the ISLT (immediate and 
delayed recall), OCL, Identification, Detection, and OBK tests. For more details on the 
individual tests, please refer to Section  13.1.1 . 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_616076] (composite of [ADDRESS_816883] scores)  
The epi[INVESTIGATOR_616077] a composite score of the ISLT (immediate and 
delayed recall) and OCL tests.  
Attention Domain of the cNTB (composite of [ADDRESS_816884] scores)  
The attention domain of the cNTB is a composite score of the Identification and Detection tests.  
Executive F unction  Domain  (composite of [ADDRESS_816885] scores)  
1. Computerized One Back Working Memory task (OBK)  
2. Category Fluency Test (CFT) : In this task , the patient is given a category and is 
instructed to provide as many items as he/she can that belong to this category in 
[ADDRESS_816886] words provided for each 
category.  
Protocol Version 7  Date: 10 April  2017  Identification: NEUP11 -AD2  Page 54/[ADDRESS_816887] (COWAT) : The COWAT is a cognitive test of 
verbal processing ability used to assess brain impairment. Verbal processing ability and 
verbal fluency are considered executive functions. The emphasis on these tests focuses 
on the degree of discrepancy (as opposed to consistency) between current functioning 
and an estimated pre -impairment functioning. The COWAT assesses the patient’s ability 
to spontaneously produce words that begin with specific letters within a certain time 
limit. In particular, the tes t uses the letters F, A, and S.  
13.1.[ADDRESS_816888] 
section measures orientation, memory, and attention: the maximum score is 21. The second 
section tests the ability of the patient to name [CONTACT_272755], follow v erbal and written commands, write 
a sentence, and copy figures: the maximum score is 9. The scoring range for the MMSE is 0 -30. 
The MMSE was shown to be both reliable and valid in a group of elderly subjects , including 
those with dementia, depression with cognitive impairment, depression , and “normal” elderly 
patients. The MMSE has been shown to possess sensitivity and specificity in various 
populations. Although the MMSE alone is unable to provide diagnostic information, the data on 
its sensitivity and specificity in cognitively impaired patients demonstrates its utility as a 
screening instrument.  
cNTB – Individual Scores  
The individual scores of the cNTB include ISLT (immediate and delayed recall), OCL, 
Ident ification, Detection, and OBK.  
NPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_616078] 1 2 domains that are rated for both frequency (range 1 -4) and severity 
(range  1-3). A composite score for each domain is calculated (frequency × severity) , which 
ranges from 1 to 12. There is a leadin g question for each item. If the symptom is not present then 
the frequency, severity , and distress scores are not completed. In this case , the score is 0 for the 
item. The sum of the composite scores yields the NPI -12 total score (range 0 -144). A negative 
change in score indicates an improvement from b aseline (symptom reduction) (Cummings et al., 
1994 ). 
PSQI  
The PSQI is an effective instrument used to measure the quality and patterns of sleep in the older 
adult. It differentiates “poor” from “good” sleep by [CONTACT_35755] 7 areas: subjective sleep qual ity, 
sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_398334], and daytime dysfunction over the last month. The  investigator with the patien t and 
caregiver  rate each of these 7 areas of sleep.  In cases of discrepancies , the caregiver answers 
prevail . Scoring of answers is based on a 0 to 3 scale, whereby  a score of 3 reflects the negative 
extreme on the Likert Scale. A global sum of 5 or greater indicates a “poor” sleeper (Buysse et 
al., 1989 ). 
Protocol Version 7  Date: 10 April  2017  Identification: NEUP11 -AD2  Page 55/[ADDRESS_816889] comprises 
11 items summed to a total score ranging from 0  to 70, with lower scores indicating less severe 
impairment. A negative change indicates an improvement from baseline. The addition of delayed 
recall, number cancelation, and maze tasks – and thus turning ADAS -cog into a [ADDRESS_816890] ively – has increased the ability to detect changes in patients in the early 
stages of the disease (Sano et al., 2011 ). 
Sheehan Suicidality Tracking Scale  
The Sheehan -STS is a prospective rating scale that tracks both treatment -emergent suicidal 
ideation and behaviors. The Sheehan -STS is a 22-item scale that can be administered by [CONTACT_5640] a 
clinician or patient through self -report.  
13.[ADDRESS_816891] been used in other studies in elderly patients  and AD patients.  
13.3 CLINICAL SAFETY PARA METERS  
The safety parameters assessed at each visit will include spontaneously reported AEs  or SAEs, 
vital signs  measurements  (heart rate  and blood pressure), physical examination,  body weight , and 
clinical laboratory tests ( hematology, biochemistry , and urinalysis) . A 12-lead ECG  will be 
performed at Visit 1  (Screening) , Visit 4 ( Week 13), and Visit 5 ( Week 26; end-of-study visit ). 
The Sheehan -STS will also be rated at Visit 1 (Screening), Visit 4 (Week 13), and Visit 5 (Week 
26; end -of-study visit).  
13.3.1 Routine Laboratory Procedures  
All blood and urine samples will be analyzed using a central laboratory. An operating manual 
specifying all the steps for the urine and blood sampling will be given to the person in charge of 
the sampling.  
The sampling will be performed at the s ite at Visits 1  (Screening) , 4, and 5 and  as soon as 
possible following the Premature Discontinuation Visit (if applicable).  
The following parameters will be measured  for hematology : hemoglobin , hematocrit , red blood 
cells, mean corpuscular hemoglobin , mean corpuscular volume , mean corpuscular hemoglobin 
concentration , white blood cells, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils , 
and platelets.  
The following parameters will be measured  for biochemistry : creati nine, uric acid, urea, AST,  
ALT, albumin, GGT, total protein, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, phosphorus, glucose, 
alkaline phosphatase , and total bilirubin.  
Prolactin  and testosterone levels will be measured from blood sampl es collected at Visits 1 and 
5. 
Protocol Version 7  Date: 10 April  2017  Identification: NEUP11 -AD2  Page 56/[ADDRESS_816892] of study documentation. Detailed guidelines are set 
out below.  
Eliciting and Documenting Adverse Events  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to document all AEs that occur during the study. An AE 
includes any noxious, pathological , or unintended change in anatomical, physiological , or 
metabolic functions as indicated by [CONTACT_30597], symptoms , and/or laboratory changes , 
whether associated with the study medication  and whether or not considered d rug related. This 
includes an exacerbation of pre -existing conditions or events, intercurrent illnesses, drug 
interaction , or the significant worsening of the indication under investigation that is not recorded 
elsewhere in the eCRF under specific efficacy  assessments. Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations 
of pre -existing conditions, including the disease under study, which do not represent a clinically 
significant exacerbation or worsening, need not be considered AEs. 
Patient  entry into the study is defined as the time at which informed consent is obtained (this 
must be before any protocol -specific diagnostic procedures or interventions  are performed ). All 
AEs subsequent to Visit [ADDRESS_816893] be reported regardless of whether or not they are considered drug 
related . 
Adverse events will be elicited by [CONTACT_99020]  a nonleading question, for example “Have 
you experienced or are you experiencing any new or changed symptoms since we last 
asked/since your last visit? .” Adverse events should be reported on the appro priate page of the 
eCRF.  
Assessment of Severity  
Each AE will be assigned a category as follows:  
Mild:   The AE was not sufficiently intense to result in discontinuation of the drug. 
Symptomatic treatment may have been given.  
Moderate:   The AE was sufficiently intense to result in discontinuation of the drug. 
Symptomatic treatment may have been given.  
Severe:   Severe is more intense than moderate; moreover the AE interferes significantly 
with ability to do work or usual activity.  
If there is a change in severity of an AE, it must be recorded as a separate event.  
Assessment of Frequency  
Frequency should be assessed using the following categories:  
 unique  
 intermittent  
 continued  
Assessment of Outcome  
Outcome should be assessed using th e following categories:  
 recovered  
 recovered with sequelae  
Protocol Version 7  Date: 10 April  2017  Identification: NEUP11 -AD2  Page 57/92 
 
 
  not recovered  
 unknown  
Assessment of Causality  
Every effort should be made by [CONTACT_616200], if 
any, to study medication  treatment. Causality should be assessed using the following categories:  
 not related  
 unlikely to be related  
 possibly related  
 probably related  
 definitely related  
Follow -up of Adverse Events  
All investigators should follow -up with patient s on AEs until the event is resolved or until, in  the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the event is stabili zed or determined to be chronic. Details of AE 
resolution must be documented in the eCRF.  
13.3.3  Suicidal Ideation  
Suicidal ideation will be rated at Visit 1 (S creening ), at Visit 4 (W eek 13 ), and at Visit  5 
(Week  26; end-of-study visit) using the Sheehan -STS. At Screening, patients with evidence of 
serious risk of suicide based on the Sheehan -STS with a score of 3 or 4 on question 2 or 13 and a 
score of 2 or higher on questions 1a, 3 through 12, and 1 4 should be excluded from the study. 
During the study (at Visit 4), patients should be discontinued from the study if they score 3 or 4 
on any one question 2 through 8 or 13, or score 2 or higher on any one question 1a, 9 through 12, 
or 20 , or if, in the o pi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the patient present a serious risk of suicide.

 14. SERIOUS ADVERSE EVEN TS 
14.1 DEFINITION OF A SERI OUS ADVERSE EVENT  
An SAE  is any event that is: 
1. Fatal 
2. Life threatening  
An AE is life threatening if the patient  was at immediate risk of death from the event as 
it occurred ; ie, it does not include a reaction that might have caused death if it had 
occurred in a more serious form.  
3. Disabling or incapacitating  
An AE is incapacitating or disabling if it results in a su bstantial and/or permanent 
disruption of the patient ’s ability to carry out normal life functions.  
4. Results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9613] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_616079]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a 
pre-existing , nonworsening condition is not, however, considered an AE. The details of 
such hospi[INVESTIGATOR_420349]/phy sical examination 
page of the eCRF.  
5. In addition, medical and scientific judgment is required to decide if prompt notification 
is required in other situations ; ie, any event which the investigator regards as serious that 
did not strictly meet the criteria a bove but may have jeopardized the patient  or required 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above, or which would suggest any 
significant hazard, contraindication, side effect , or precaution that may be associated 
with the use of the drug.  
14.2 DEFINITION OF AN UNE XPECTED ADVERSE EVEN T 
An unexpected AE is defined as a ny AE that is not expected, ie , one that has not been reported as 
expected in this protocol or in the investigator’s brochure, either from previous clinical or 
preclinical studies.

 14.5 REGULATORY RESPONSIB ILITY  
INC Research , on behalf of Neurim Pharmaceutical s, has a responsibility to notify the regulatory 
authorities about the safety of a new d rug and will also inform all participating investigators of 
serious and/or unexpected drug -related events associated with the use of this drug . Therefore, 
prompt notification of SAEs is required by [CONTACT_616202], and also to ensure ethical responsibilities towards the safety of other patient s are met. The 
investigators must adhere to local requirements of the IRBs and i ndependent ethics committees 
with regard to reporting these events locally.  
  
Protocol Version 7  Date: 10 April  2017  Identification: NEUP11 -AD2  Page 61/92 
 
 
 15. STUDY TERMINAT ION CRITERIA  
Neurim Pharmaceuticals reserves the right to discontinue the study at any time. The reasons will 
be discussed with the investigator s. A study site may also be discontinued by [CONTACT_616203] . 
  
Protocol Version 7  Date: 10 April  2017  Identification: NEUP11 -AD2  Page 62/92 
 
 
 16. DATA COLLECTION AND ENTRY  
The study will be monitored at regular intervals during the enrol lment and follow -up period. 
There will be a monitoring visit or telephone call approximately every 8 weeks. The frequency of 
monitoring visits will be determined by [CONTACT_616204].  
The following will be reviewed at these visits:  
 Compliance with the protocol  
 Consent procedure  
 Source document verifica tion (see below)  
 AE procedures  
 Storage and accountability of materials  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to maintain adequate and accurate eCRFs , which have 
been designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the clinical investigation. All 
eCRFs should be completed in their entirety.  
The purpose of source document verification is to verify, so far as is possible, that the 
informa tion in the eCRF reflects the data recorded in the patient ’s medical notes (see Section 
21.2 for details). S ource document verification  will be performed with due regard for patient  
confidentiality  and will be undertaken on an ongoing basis as part of the monitoring visits. Direct 
access to the source documents will be required. The monitor will make a direct comparison with 
data entered in the eCRFs.  
The investigator must permit the monitor, the sponsor ’s internal auditors , and representatives 
from the regulatory authorities , IRB,  and ethics committee s to inspect all study -related 
documents and pertinent medical records for confirmation of data contained within the eCRFs.  
INC Research  will be responsible  for activities associated with the  Statistical Analysis Plan  and 
for data management of this study. This will include producing a n eCRF  and setting up a 
relevant database and data transfer mechanisms, along with appropriate validation of data and 
producti on of queries.  
Automated checks will be made against the data to ensure completeness and consistency. The 
database and check programs will be validated prior to implementation. Missing or inconsistent 
data will be queried in writing to the investigator for  clarification. Subsequent modifications in 
the database will be documented.  
  
Protocol Version 7  Date: 10 April  2017  Identification: NEUP11 -AD2  Page 63/92 
 
 
 17. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
Further details of the planned statistical analysis will be provided in the  Statistical Analysis Plan . 
17.1 DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE  
Eligible patients will be enrolled equally in a 1.2: 1:1:1  randomization ratio  to the 4  trial arms 
(placebo [1.2] and the equal p iromelatine treatment arms  5 mg, 20 mg , and 50 mg  [1:1:1] ). 
Assuming an effect size between treatment dose and placebo of 0. 35 over 26 weeks, a significant 
level  (α) of 0.05 , and power of 88%, a sample size of 143 patients for the placebo arm and 119 
for each  of the 3  pi[INVESTIGATOR_616081]. Assuming a 50% screen failure  rate and 
allowing for 15% patient withdrawal , [ADDRESS_816895] no major protocol violations.  
17.3 ANALYTICAL MEASURES  
Statistical testing will be one-tailed at the 5% level of significance.  The justification for this 
follows. When conducting placebo -controlled trials, it is imperati ve that the study medication  be 
demonstrated to be superior in efficacy to placebo, since equivalent or worse efficacy than 
placebo will preclude approvability. Consequently, a one -sided test for efficacy is required. The 
null hypothesis is that the drug is equal or worse than placebo. The alternative hypothesis is that 
the drug has greater efficacy than placebo. A Type I error occurs only when it is concluded that a 
study medication  is effective when in fact it is not. This can occur in only one tail of the 
distribution of the treatment difference.  
17.3.1  Analysis of Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic data (age , gender , BMI ), education (years), duration of AD , severity of disease as 
expressed by  [CONTACT_616205] , and ApoE 4 genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_616082].  
Prior medication, compliance , and medical and surgical history will be summarized by [CONTACT_616206] t using descriptive statistics.  
No formal statistical testing will be performed on these data.  
17.3.2  Analysis of Primary Efficacy Parameter  
The cNTB global  composite  score  (ISLT immediate  and delayed  recall , OCL , identification, 
detection, and OBK ) will be summarized at baseline and after 4, 13 , and 26  weeks of 
Protocol Version 7  Date: 10 April  2017  Identification: NEUP11 -AD2  Page 64/92 
 
 
 double -blind treatment (actual and change from baseline) for each treatment group using 
descriptive statistics (n,  mean, SD, median, minimum , and maximum). The primary efficacy 
analysis will be carried out using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment 
and study site as the main effects and baseline cNTB global  z-score as the covariate . To evaluate 
the effect of missing cNTB items, multiple imputations  will be used for the calculation of cNTB 
composite scores in the case of 1 or 2  missing cNTB items.  
Secondary efficacy analys es will be carried out using a mixed -effects maximum likelihood 
repeated measures (MMRM) model utilizing all baseline a nd postbaseline data  to assess any 
differences in treatment effects over time . The model shall include fixed effects of treatment, 
study site, visit , and treatment by [CONTACT_23259], with baseline score as a covariate, and a 
baseline by [CONTACT_373756] n. The global treatment effect estimates will be reported, with 95% 
confidence intervals and P values. 
17.3.3  Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Parameters  
The same aforementioned ANCOVA model will be used to analyze all secondary efficacy 
endpoints : CGIC, ADCS -MCI -ADL,  ADAS -cog14, cNTB global composite score, cNTB 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_616083]  (ISLT and OCL), cNTB attention domain composite 
score ( identification and detection), and executive function composite score ( OBK, COWAT and 
CFT).  The MMRM m odel also will be used for the  analysis of ADCS -MCI -ADL, cNTB various  
domain s composite score  (identification and detection) and  executive function composite score.  
17.3.4  Analysis of Exploratory Efficacy Parameters  
The same aforementioned ANCOVA model will be used to analyze the exploratory efficacy 
endpoints: MMSE, individual cNTB scores, NPI, PSQI  (global score and individual 
components) , and ADAS -cog13, ADAS -cog12, and ADAS -cog11 score s. 
Additionally, t he MMRM mod el will be used for the analysis of individual c NTB score s and the 
PSQI global and individual component scores .

Descriptive statistics will be provided for AEs, change in physical examination parameters , and 
vital signs. The number of patients taking concomitant medications during the 28-week treatment 
period (2-week single -blind , placebo run -in period followed by 26 -week double -blind , treatment 
period) will be summari zed by [CONTACT_616207]. The 
number of patients withdrawing during the treatment periods will be summari zed by [CONTACT_616208] g roup.  
The number of patients reporting AEs will be summarized during the 28 -week treatment period 
by [CONTACT_616209].  
The change in laboratory parameters from baseline (end of the first week) to the end of the 
28-week treatment period will be summarized using shift tables showing the number of patients 
having values below, within , and above the normal range at each assessment for each treatment 
group separately. Data will not be carried forward for patients withdrawin g due to treatment 
failure.  
The change in physical examination parameters from baseline to the end of the [ADDRESS_816897] for patients withdrawing due to treatment failure.  
Vital signs will be summarized at baseline and at the end of the 28 -week treatment period (actual 
and change from baseline) using descriptive statistics ( n, mean, SD, median, minimum , and 
maximum).  
The number of patients withdrawing during the [ADDRESS_816898] APPROV AL  
This study will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki 
(latest revision , Fortaleza  2013). In addition, this study will be undertaken in accordance with the 
protocol and GCP on the conducting and monitoring of clinical studies. The IRB must be 
constituted according to the International Council for Harmonisation ( ICH) guidelines on GCP 
and loc al laws.

accounted for and documented.  
21.2 ELECTRONIC CASE REPORT FORMS  
In accordance with GCP and ICH Guidelines, the study monitor will carry out source document 
verification to ensure that the data collected in the eCRF are accurate and reliable. Source 
document verification involves cross -referencing data  in the eCRF with those recorded in any 
source document ( eg, patient s’ medical notes, nurses ’ notes, appointment diaries, laboratory 
reports).  
All key trial information must be recorded in the patient ’s medical notes. This includes: 
confirmation of diagnosis , date of informed consent given and of study entry , visit dates , start 
and stop dates of study medication , changes to concomitant medication , and AEs . Study 
procedures will be fully documented in the eCRFs and signed by [CONTACT_093]. For data  
required to be transcribed into the eCRF, a check on accuracy will be performed by [CONTACT_1275]. The investigator will check relevant laboratory reports for accuracy, will annotate 
the laboratory report for values of clinical significance and out of r ange values , and  then will

or frequency, per physician preference 
• Any pre-operative medications may be continued 
 
4.2.[ADDRESS_1039341]-Operative Anti-Emetic Medication Regimen: 
All patients will have available IV ondansetron (zofran) 4 mg every 4 hours as needed for 
nausea. Patients unable to take ondansetron will be given metocloprmiade (reglan). 
 
4.2.[ADDRESS_1039342]-Operative Measurements: 
Protocol for RCT of TAP Blocks in Breast Reconstruction   
 
Protocol Version #3  13 28 April 2018 Patients will be asked to rate their pain level on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) every 4 hours 
while hospi[INVESTIGATOR_759083]. The total dosage of IV hydromorphone administered 
(via both the PCA and the as needed medications for breakthrough pain) will be recorded in 8-
hour periods (midnight to 8am, 8am to 4pm, 4pm to midnight). The use of other pain 
medications, as well as anti-emetic medications, will be recorded in the same 8-hour periods. 
Time to ambulation, time to first bowel movement after surgery, and time to discharge will be 
recorded. 
 4.2.5 Evaluation for Discharge: 
Patients will be evaluated daily for meeting discharge criteria as per normal Institution guidelines 
that are standard of care for patients undergoing flap-based breast reconstruction. That is, 
discharge criteria for patients on this study are the same as Institutional discharge criteria.

 “The onset of action with Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_759084]. The 
duration of anesthesia is significantly longer with Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_759085]. It has also been noted that there is a period of analgesia 
that persists after the return of sensation, during which time the need for strong analgesics is 
reduced. After injection of Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_759086], epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873], or peripheral nerve

Protocol Version #3  17 28 April 2018 7. ADVERSE EVENTS AND REPORTING PROCEDURES 
7.1 Potential Adverse Events As reported on FDA-approved drug products website:  
<http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2015/018053s055lbl.pdf > 
 “The most commonly encountered acute adverse experiences which demand immediate counter 
measures are related to the central nervous system and the cardiovascular system. These adverse 
experiences are generally dose related and due to high plasma levels which may result from over 
dosage, rapid absorption from the injection site, diminished tolerance, or from unintentional 
intravascular injection of the local anesthetic solution. In addition to systemic dose-related 
toxicity, unintentional subarachnoid injection of drug during the intended performance of caudal 
or lumbar epi[INVESTIGATOR_759092] (especially in the head and 
neck region) may result in underventilation or apnea (“Total or High Spi[INVESTIGATOR_1304]”). Also, hypotension 
due to loss of sympathetic tone and respi[INVESTIGATOR_759093]. This may lead to secondary cardiac arrest 
if untreated. Patients over 65 years, particularly those with hypertension, may be at increased risk 
for experiencing the hypotensive effects of Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_21154]. Factors influencing 
plasma protein binding, such as acidosis, systemic diseases which alter protein production, or 
competition of other drugs for protein binding sites, may diminish individual tolerance.”

7.2 Adverse Event Reporting 
Adverse events will be graded according to CTCAE v4.03.  Both Serious and Non-Serious 
Adverse Events will be clearly noted in source documentation and listed on study specific Case 
Report Forms (CRFs).  The Protocol Director (PD) or designee will assess each Adverse Event 
(AE) to determine whether it is unexpected according to the Informed Consent, Protocol 
Document, or Investigator’s Brochure, and related to the investigation. All Serious Adverse 
Events (SAEs) will be tracked until resolution, or until [ADDRESS_1039353] Cancer Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) using the study 
specific CRF regardless of the event’s relatedness to the investigation. Following review by [CONTACT_6802], events meeting the IRB definition of ‘Unanticipated Problem’ will be reported to the IRB using eProtocol within 10 working days of DSMC review, or within 5 working days for 
deaths or life-threatening experiences.

11. REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS 
11.1 Institutional Review of Protocol The protocol, the proposed informed consent and all forms of participant information related to 
the study (e.g. advertisements used to recruit participants) will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_193001] (SRC).   Any changes 
made to the protocol will be submitted as a modification and will be approved by [CONTACT_759103] #[ADDRESS_1039370] Cancer Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will be the 
monitoring entity for this study. The DSMC will audit study-related activities to determine 
whether the study has been conducted in accordance with the protocol, local standard operating 
procedures, FDA regulations, and Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  This may include review of the 
following types of documents participating in the study: regulatory binders, case report forms, 
eligibility checklists, and source documents.  In addition, the DSMC will regularly review 
serious adverse events and protocol deviations associated with the research to ensure the 
protection of human subjects.  Results of the DSMC audit will be communicated to the IRB and 
the appropriate regulatory authorities at the time of continuing review, or in an expedited 
fashion, as needed. 
 
11.3 Data Management Plan 
The Protocol Director, or his/her designee, will prepare and maintain adequate and accurate 
participant case histories with observations and data pertinent to the study.  Study specific Case 
Report Forms (CRFs) will document treatment outcomes for data analysis.   Case report forms 
will be maintained by [CONTACT_759104], a secure data storage platform, or in a locked office accessible only to the research team.

 9-3/[ADDRESS_153140] common tumor among men, and the second leading cause of male 
cancer -related death in the [LOCATION_002] [1].  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_15110], 
over 30,[ADDRESS_153141] died as a result of prostate cancer in 2010 [1].  
Treatment with surgery and radiation remain effective for presumed organ- confined disease, 
however approximately one third of these patients will have progressive or metastatic disease at 
10 years [2].  Prostate cancer, once it becomes metastatic, is not curable and is generally in itially 
treated with androgen deprivation, and androgen deprivation remains the cornerstone on which 
other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_15111] [3].  Unfortunately, within typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 2- [ADDRESS_153142] been approved by [CONTACT_15182].  Specifically, docetaxel was approved in 2004 after two large randomized trials showed a  2-3 month median 
improvement in overall survival compared with mitoxantrone [4, 5] .  Cabazitaxel was approved 
in 2010 for patients with disease refractory to docetaxel after an international trial demonstrated a similar 2 -3 month median improvement in overall survival compared with mitoxantrone [6].  
Also in 2010, sipuleucel -T (Provenge®, Dendreon Corporation) was approved for patients with 
minimally symptomatic castrate -resistant, metastatic prostate cancer, based on the results of a 
prospec tively randomized, blinded, phase III placebo- controlled clinical trial, and supporting 
data from previous phase III clinical trials, demonstrating a median 4- month improvement in 
overall survival [7].  Finally, in 2011, abiraterone, an oral androgen synthesis inhibitor, was 
similarly approved in the setting of docetaxel -refractory, castrate- resistant metastatic prostate 
cancer following a prospectively randomized, blinded, placebo -controlled trial demonstrating 
nearly a 4 -month median improvement in overall survival [8].  These recent advances have 
clearly improved the situation for patients with advanced prostate cancer;  however have 
presented new challenges in terms of the optimal sequence and appr oach to the management of 
castrate -resistant disease.   
 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_15112], many patients and treating physicians believe that the small overall survival benefit provided by [CONTACT_15183], in part due to potential side effects [9].  Vaccine- based strategies, 
also known as active immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], are particularly appealing as potentially safe r treatments , 
and the trials that led to the approval of sipuleucel -T showed markedly fewer adverse events than 
are typi[INVESTIGATOR_15113] [7].  Many vaccines for prostate cancer are in 
clinical development, all of which have demonstrated similar safety profiles, and some of which have demonstrated anti -tumor activity, as we have recently reviewed  [10-13].  Consequently, 
evaluating active immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_135192], or earlier in the course of disease, are rational directions to further improve on these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_135193] [14].    Prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) is a model antigen for vaccine -based treatment strategies 
targeting prostate cancer.  PAP is a well -defined protein whose expression is essentially 
restricted to normal and malignant prostate tissue [15].  It is also one of only a few known 
prostate- specific proteins for which there is a rodent homologue, thereby [CONTACT_135219] [16].  Data from independent labs 
has demonstrated that, in a rat model, vaccine strategies targeting PAP can result in PAP -specific 
 
 9-3/2015 Version  7  
  
CD8+ T -cells, the presumed population mediating tumor cell destruction, and anti -tumor 
responses [17-20] .  PAP is the target antigen of the autologous antigen -presenting cell 
sipuleucel -T vaccine, in which autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells are loaded ex vivo  
with a PAP -GM-CSF fusion protein.  A separate phase I clinical trial evaluated dendritic cells 
loaded with a murine homologue of PAP, and demonstrated immunogenicity of this approach 
[21].  In rodent studies, we have similarly demonstrated that PAP can be immunologically 
targeted using genetic vaccines, and a plasmid DNA vaccine in par ticular [18, 19] .   We have 
previously reported the results of a phase I/II trial conducted in patient s with early, PSA -
recurrent (clinical stage D0) prostate cancer using this same DNA vaccine (pTVG -HP).  No 
significant adverse events were observed in 22 subjects treated over a 12 -week period of time.  
Moreover, several patients developed evidence of PAP -specific CD4+ and CD8+ T -cells, and 
several patients experienced a prolongation in the PSA doubling time, demonstrating immunological efficacy and suggesting a possible anti -tumor effect [22].  The presence of long -
term IFNγ -secreting immune responses to PAP, detectable at multiple times months after 
immunization, were associated with increases in PSA doubling time, suggesting this might serve as a rational biomarker for efficacy [23].  Moreover, it was found that immune responses could 
be augmented months later with repeated immunizations, suggesting that DNA vaccines might provide a simple means of boosting immune responses from other priming immunizations [23].  
These findings have justified further  evaluation of this vaccine in a randomized phase II clinical 
trial, a study currently underway, and also specifically suggest that the pTVG -HP might be used 
in combination with sipuleucel- T to augment PAP -specific T -cell responses primed by [CONTACT_135220], as both vaccine approaches target the same antigen.  This serves as the primary rationale for the current trial.   
 
 
2. Background and Rationale 
 
A. PAP is a tumor antigen in prostate cancer and PAP-specific CD8+ CTL can lyse  prostate 
cancer cells  
 
PAP was first identified in 1938 and was initially used as a serum marker for the detection of prostate cancer [15, 24] .  PAP expression in normal and malignant prostate cells is well-
documented, and is still used in immunohistochemical staining to establish a prostate origin of metastatic carcinoma [25].  The ubiquitous expression of PAP in prostate tissue makes it an 
appealing antigen as a potential “universal” target for immune- directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_15116], unlike specific oncogenes that may or may not be expressed by a  particular tumor.  
Moreover, it has been demonstrated that some patients with prostate cancer have preexisting antibody and T -cell responses to PAP, suggesting that tolerance to this “self” protein can be 
circumvented in vivo  [26, 27].  In particular, the demonstration of Th1- like immune responses 
specific for PAP suggest that an immune  environment permissive of an anti -tumor response can 
exist in patients even without immunization [28].   Moreover, we have previously demonstrated 
that CD8+ T cells specific for PAP, with cytolytic activity for prostate cancer cells, can exist in patients with prostate cancer, and can be augmented with vaccination [23, 28]. 
 
B. Sipuleucel -T:  The first anti-tumor vaccine FDA approved for the treatment of cancer 
 
 
 9-3/[ADDRESS_153143] previously reviewed the preclinical and early clinical development of sipuleucel -T 
elsewhere [14].  Sipuleucel -T has been evaluated in three Phase I II clinical trials in patients with 
metastatic, castrate- resistant prostate cancer.  In the first phase III trial (D9901), Small and 
colleagues enrolled 127 men with asymptomatic disease , randomized 2:1 to receive three 
biweekly infusions of sipuleucel -T versus placebo.  Patients on the sipuleucel -T arm received as 
many autologous cells, cultured in vitro with PA2024 (PAP -GM-CSF fusion protein), as could 
be prepared from a standard leukapheresis product (with a median of 3.65x109 nucleated cells 
per infusion [29]).  The pat ients receiving placebo underwent a leukapheresis, and cells were re -
infused without being pulsed with PA2024.  In this study, the primary endpoint was TTP (either 
radiographic or development of pain) .  In this study, treatment with sipuleucel- T was found to be 
well tolerated.  The most common side effects associated with sipuleucel -T infusion were Grade 
1 or 2 rigors and pyrexia (54.9% and 37.8% of patients, respectively), with a lower frequency of patients having Grade 1 or 2 tremors (26.8%) [29].  T-cell proliferative re sponses were detected 
to the PA2024 fusion protein [29].  However, while serum PSA decreases of greater than 25% 
were detected in 6.8% of patients receiving sipuleucel -T (with no decreases in the control 
patients), the primary endpoint of TTP did not reach statistical sign ificance: patients receiving 
sipuleucel -T had a median TTP of 11.7 weeks (95% confidence interval (CI): 9.1 -16.6) 
compared with 10.0 weeks for patients receiving placebo (95% CI: 8.7-13.1) [29].    While the D9901 trial was ongoing, a second companion phase III trial was also underway, accruing patients with asymptomatic metastatic, castrate -resistant disease (D9902A).  This trial 
was being conducted as a confirmatory study with the same population, study design, and randomization scheme.  W hile this trial was still accruin g patients, the results from the D9901 
trial showing a lack of difference in TTP were unblinded, and due to lack of significance in the primary endpoint of TTP, the D9902A trial was abandoned.    A subset analysis of D9901 found that patients with a Gleason score ≤7 treated with sipuleucel -T 
had a significant increase in TTP compared with those receiving placebo.  This led to another Phase III trial (D9902B), which was designed similarly to the D9901 trial with 127 patients and a primary endpoint of TTP, but with the plan to only accrue asymptomatic metastatic, castrate -
resistant patients with a Gleason score of 7 or less.   However, as this trial was beginning to accrue, a later analysis of the D9901 trial revealed a significant difference in overall surviv al, 
with patients receiving sipuleucel -T having a three -year overall survival of 25.9 months, 
compared with 21.4 months of patients receiving placebo (hazard ratio (HR) 1.43, p=0.01) [30].  
Additionally, as described above, it was observed that nearly half of progression events occurred 
within the first [ADDRESS_153144] occurred, and therefore possibly accounting for a lack of difference in TTP [29, 30] .  
Furthermore, an integrated analysis of the D9901 and D9902A trials suggested that patients 
receiving sipuleucel -T had a median survival of 23.2 months (95% CI: 19.0- 31.0) versus 18.9 
months (95% CI: 13.5- 25.3) in the placebo control group (HR: 1.5, p=0.011) [30].  Due to these 
findings, the D9902B protocol was amended, changing the primary endpoint from TTP to overall 
survival, and increasing the planned patient enrollment from [ADDRESS_153145] a difference in overall survival.  This trial (IMPaCT, Immunotherapy for Prostate 
Adenocarcinoma Treatment ) confirmed that treatment with sipuleucel- T provided a significant 
increase in overall survival: patients receiving an infusion of PA2024- pulsed cells had a median 
survival of 25.8 months compared to 21.7 months in the placebo group, consistent with the previous trials [7].  This survival difference reflected  a significant difference in the risk of death 
 
 9-3/2015 Version  9  
  
in patients treated with sipuleucel- T compared to the placebo group (hazard ratio (HR), 0.78.  
95% CI: 0.61- 0.96, p=0.03) [7].  This survival benefit was also present regardless of prior or 
subsequent treatment with docetaxel and prednisone.  Similar to previous trials, no difference in 
time to progression was observed (14.6 weeks in the sipuleucel -T group versus 14.4 weeks in the 
placebo group, p=0.63), contradicting trends observed in the earlier phase studies [7].  With the 
significant survival benefit dete cted in the IMPACT phase III trial, FDA approved sipuleucel -T 
in April 2010 for the treatment of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic, castrate -
resistant prostate cancer.   
 
C. DNA vaccines can elicit antigen -specific Th1/CTL immune responses 
 Over the last decade, there has been considerable int erest in the development of plasmid DNA -
based vaccines, a strategy that offers several distinct advantages over other methods of antigen delivery.  DNA can be rapi[INVESTIGATOR_15119], and there are no problems with solubility as there frequently are with peptides and recombinant protein vaccines.  In addition, because the DNA in nucleic acid vaccines has been demonstrated to be taken up and expressed by [CONTACT_135221] -presenting cells (APC) directly [31-33] , antigen 
presentation occurs through naturally processed epi[INVESTIGATOR_322], and does not require autologous ce ll 
processing.  DNA vaccines can therefore be theoretically employed in an HLA -independent 
fashion unlike peptide -based vaccines that are necessarily HLA -restricted.  This strategy is ideal 
in the HLA -diverse human situation.  In many ways, this method of immunization is similar to 
the use of viral immunization vectors, however without the additional foreign antigens introduced with a viral vector and consequently less of a risk of an overwhelming immune response to the vector itself [19, 34].  Of importance in tumor immunization models, several groups have demonstrated that immunization with plasmid DNA encoding a target antigen is a potent means of eliciting Th1 -biased immune responses [35] and CD8+ T -cells specific for the 
targeted antigen [31, 36-39] .  In animal models, the use of an intradermal route of vaccine 
administration, in particular, tends to promote this Th1/CTL -biased immune response [35, 40, 
41].  It should also be acknowledged that the clinical efficacy of a DNA vaccine encoding 
tyrosinase for the treatment of canine melanoma, delivered with GM -CSF as a vaccine adjuvant, 
was approved by [CONTACT_15192] [ADDRESS_153146] 
vaccine approved in the U.S.  for the treatment of existing cancer.   Thus, this approach bears 
further investigation in human clinical trials .   
 
D. DNA vaccine encoding PAP (pTVG -HP) can elicit antigen -specific CD4+ and CD8+ T 
cells in patients with prostate cancer  
 We have previo usly reported that DNA vaccines encoding either the human or rat homologue of 
PAP can elicit PAP -specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in rats, suggesting a feasible means of 
eliciting PAP -specific anti -tumor immune responses in patients [18, 19].  We have subsequently 
reported the results from a phase I/II clinical trial in which subjects with non -castrate, non -
metastatic prostate cancer were immunized six times at two -week intervals with this same DNA 
vaccine.  The primary objectives of that trial were to evaluate the safety and immunological efficacy of the pTVG -HP DNA vaccine in patients with clinical stage D0 prostate cancer [42].  
This was a dose -escalation study, with an expanded cohort of subjects treated at the maximum 
tolerated dose.  In the dose -escalation portion, nine subjects were treated in three dose cohorts of 
 
 9-3/2015 Version  10  
  
100 µg, 500 µg, or 1500 µg DNA, administered intradermally every two weeks for six total 
immunizations.  200 µg GM -CSF was co -administered as a vaccine adjuvant, similar to the 
approach used in the canine melanoma vaccine trial s, with each immunization.  13 additional 
subjects were treated in an expanded cohort at the 1500 µg DNA dose.  Safety evaluation included monthly blood tests (CBC, creatinine, urinalysis, anti -nuclear antibody tests, liver 
function tests, and serum amylas e) and physical examination and review of systems.  Subjects 
were also monitored for one hour after each vaccination for any immediate allergic reactions.  No serious adverse events were observed, and no significant laboratory anomalies were observed apart  from a single grade 3 amylase that was determined to not be treatment -related.  No other 
events > grade 2 were observed in any of the 22 subjects treated.  Common events observed were grade 1/2 fevers, chills, and local site reactions lasting typi[INVESTIGATOR_135194] 24 hours.  2/22 subjects 
experienced grade 2 back pain occurring ~ 45 minutes after treatment and lasting < 10 minutes.  
The primary immunological endpoint of this trial was the induction of PAP -specific IFN γ-
secreting effector CD8+ T cells detectable two weeks following the final immunization.  For this 
evaluation autologous dendritic cells were prepared by [CONTACT_135222] -adherent monocytes for 
six days in serum -free medium supplemented with GM -CSF and IL -4.  CD8+ T cells, purified 
from PBMC by n egative magnetic bead selection, were cultured with autologous dendritic cells 
and protein antigens for [ADDRESS_153147] assessment of effector T -cell response.  As previously reported, three patients 
had a significant increase in the number of PAP -specific IFN γ-secreting CD8+ T cells after 
immunization compared with pre -immunization, one patient from each dose cohort [22].  In 
addition, several subjects, including the subject with the greatest magnitude ELISPOT response, were also found to have P AP-specific memory T -cell recall responses as identified by 
[CONTACT_135223]4+ and CD8+ T cells in a 96 -hour proliferation assay following antigen-
stimulation [22].   Finally, several individuals experienced a prolongation in PSA doubling time 
over one year following treatment compared with pre -treatment.  Overall the median PSA 
doubling time was 6.5 months in the four months pre -treatment and 8.5 months in the 4-month 
on-treatment period (p = 0.033).  Long- term PAP -specific IFN γ-secreting T -cell responses were 
observed in several patients up to one year after immuni zation; the presence of this persistent 
immunity was associated with favorable changes in PSA doubling time [23].  In addition, one 
patient went on to receive booster immunizations with 100 µg pTVG -HP at monthly intervals.  
As shown in Figure 1, booster immunizations were able to augment PAP -specific CD4+ and 
CD8+ prolifera tive T cells, as well as PAP epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230] -specific CD8+ T cells (Figure 2) months after 
the initial immunization course.  Taken together, these results demonstrate that pTVG -HP can 
elicit PAP -specific T -cell immune responses, CD8+ T -cell responses in particular, and these 
responses could be elicited at even the lowest dose (100 µg) of plasmid DNA vaccine tested.     
Figure 1 :  PAP-specific cellular immune responses can be boosted months after initial immunization .  Peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells were obtained from a patient 18 months after the initial immunization series (pre boosters), and after 2, 4, or 6 monthly booster 
immunizations with 100 µg pTVG -HP.  Antigen -specific T cells were identified by [CONTACT_488] -specific T -cell proliferation by [CONTACT_135224] (BrdU proliferation kit, BD Biosciences).  Shown is the proliferation index relative to a 
media only control of CD4+ T cells (panel A) and CD8+ T cells (panel B).  Panel C show s patient’s serum PSA levels prior to and after 
treatment, indicating stable disease.   
 
 9-3/[ADDRESS_153148] one individual these immune responses could be boosted with subsequent reimmunization [23], a second pi[INVESTIGATOR_135195] -resistant, non-
radiographically metastatic prostate cancer.  This trial was designed to answer the question of  
whether six immunizations were  insufficient in some individuals to develop an immune 
response, and whether ongoing repetitive immunization might be necessary.  While this trial is still underway and results are preliminary, to date we have identified that many patients developed PAP -specific immune responses after as few as 3 -6 immunizations ( Figure 3, subject 
#2), and some individuals (Figure 3, subject #1), no immune responses were detectable after 
even [ADDRESS_153149] provided the rationale for a randomized phase II clinical trial evaluating this same DNA vaccine to  determine whether vaccination prolongs time 
to disease progression – this trial is currently underway.   
 
E. Summary  
 The current protocol will examine the use of a plasmid DNA vaccine encoding PAP to induce and/or augment T -cell immune responses to PAP in patients with castrate -resistant, metastatic 
prostate cancer following treatment with sipuleucel- T.  Based on published results from trials 
conducted with sipuleucel -T, PA2024 and PAP antibody and proliferative T cell responses have 
been observed, suggesting a possible CD4+ T -cell-biased immune response.  In [ADDRESS_153150] had detectable Th1- biased 
PAP-specific CD4+ and CD8+ responses.  These results suggest that different types of immune 
responses to the same antigen might be elicited depending on the type of immunization, and hence a combination able to elicit a broad immune response might have greater anti- tumor effect.  
Given that a Th1/ CD8+/CTL response would be predicted to be the most effective immune 
response el icited capable of lysing PAP -expressing prostate cancer cells, the identification of 
these specific subset s will be the primary endpoint of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251].  The trial will be conducted 
in patients with minimally symptomatic, castrate -resistant, metastatic prostate cancer, as this is 
the approved indication for treatment with sipuleucel -T.  In addition, given previous observations 
from clinical trials using sipuleucel- T, and multiple other anti -tumor vaccine trials, suggesting 
that clinical effects (unlike  with standard cytotoxic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) might occur months after treatment 
Figur e 2:  PAP-derived epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230] -specific cellular 
immune responses can be detected long -term after 
initial immunization .  Peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells were obtained from an HLA -A2-expressing  
patient at multiple intervals following an initial 6 
biweekly immunization series and 6 monthly booster immunizations 18 months later (red bars indicate timing of the se immunizations).  Cells were stimulated 
in vitro for 1 week with peptides and assayed for the 
frequency of epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230] -specific T cells among 
CD3+CD8+ cells by [CONTACT_44688] -A2-specific PAP peptide -
specific pentamers (ProImmune, Inc.).

Figure 3 :  Patients with the same stage of prostate cancer respond differently to treatment with a DNA vaccine .  Patients 
with castrate -resistant, non -metastatic prostate cancer were immunized at two -week intervals with a DNA vaccine 
encoding PAP 24 times (subject 1, panels A and B) or 6 times, followed by [CONTACT_135225] 3- month intervals (subject 2, 
panels C and D), as indicated by [CONTACT_135226].  Immune response was assessed using freshly obtained PBMC, without 
in vitro stimulation by T -cell proliferation using PKH 26 dye dilution, using as stimulator antigens PAP (blue), PSA (pi[INVESTIGATOR_8745], 
negative control), and tetanus toxoid (green), and assessed by [CONTACT_113289] 7 days in antigen-specific culture 
(panel B).  Precursor frequency of antigen -specific CD8+ T cells was  estimated using ModFit software.  In addition, 
immune response was assessed by [CONTACT_488] -specific IFNγ (panel A and C) or granzyme B (panel D) release by [CONTACT_135227] 48 - or 24 -hour antigen-specific culture without in vitro stimulation.   concurrent with the generation of immune responses, exploratory clinical endpoints will be to 
determine whether treatment affects progression -free survival using a delayed (12- week) tim e 
point as the baseline for subsequent radiographic comparisons.  Additional clinical endpoints 
will be to examine the effects of treatment on circulating tumor cell number, PSA kinetics, and whether favorable delays in disease progression are associated w ith the detection of persistent 
immune responses to PAP or other “off -target” prostate cancer antigens after treatment, or 
negatively associated with unfavorable tolerant -type immune responses existing pre -treatment.  
If successful, this trial could provide rational clinical endpoints and immune biomarkers that could be used in the design of future studies using sipuleucel-T in combination with other agents, and/or a larger, confirmatory study in combination with booster DNA vaccines.

4. Product Information 
 
A. Sipuleucel -T  
 
PA2024 
 PA2024 is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of human PAP and GM -CSF.  GM -CSF acts 
as a growth factor and differentiation factor for antigen- presenting cells, including dendritic 
cells; the purpose of the fusion protein is to direct the PAP antigen to antigen- presenting cells in 
vitro , and promote antigen uptake and processing of the PAP antigen.   
 
 Preparation of sipuleucel -T 
 Patients will undergo a standard 1.5- 2.[ADDRESS_153152] 
 
 9-3/[ADDRESS_153153] will be enriched for antigen- presenting cells by [CONTACT_135228], and cultured in vitro in the presence of PA2024 for 36-44 hours.  After 
the culture period, the cells will be washed and resuspended in Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP.  
The sipuleucel -T cell product will then be shipped back to the UWHC for infusion at the U WHC 
Infusion Center.  During shipment, sterility testing and cell count data are gathered for final product release for re -infusion.  These procedures will all be performed as part of the standard-
of-care for the FDA -approved sipuleucel-T product and re- infusion.   
 
B. Plasmid DNA vaccine  
 
 pTVG-HP (pTVG4 vector containing cDNA for human PAP) 
 The sequence of the pTVG -HP plasmid has been confirmed by [CONTACT_135229].  A bacterial strain was transformed with this plasmid and transferred to the National Gene Vector Laboratories (NGVL) manufacturing facility (Center for Biomedicine and Genetics, City of Hope/Beckman Research Institute, Duarte, CA) from which a master cell bank was prepared.  This master cell bank was shipped in 2008 to the Waisman Clinical Biomanufacturing Facility (WCBF) at the University of Wisconsin.  Bacteria from this b ank was 
grown and amplified in culture under kanamycin selection, and two separate GMP -grade lots of 
plasmid DNA have been prepared (one at the Beckman Research Institute for the initial phase I trial, and one lot at the WCBF).  The biological activity of each lot has been tested in rodent studies demonstrating that T -cell immune responses specific for PAP can be elicited in vivo 
following immunization.  Lots were tested for appearance, plasmid homogeneity, DNA identity 
by [CONTACT_135230] n, protein contamination, RNA contamination, genomic 
DNA contamination, sterility, endotoxin, and pH, and criteria for each of these have been established for future lot release.  The vaccine will be supplied in single -use vials containing 0.6 
mL 0.2 mg/mL  pTVG- HP in phosphate -buffered saline.  Vials containing phosphate -buffered 
saline only will be used for preparing the placebo/GM -CSF.   Vials will be stored at –80°C until 
the day of use.    
GM-CSF 
 GM-CSF (Leukine®, Sargramostim), will be obtained from c ommercial vendor (Genzyme, 
Cambridge, MA) and used as a vaccine adjuvant and will be provided without charge to subjects participating in this trial. GM -CSF, as described above, is a growth factor that supports the 
survival, clonal expansion and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells including dendritic antigen presenting cells.  In preliminary animal experiments and human clinical trials GM-CSF has been shown to be safe and serve as an effective adjuvant for the induction of 
antibody and T -cell responses to the immunized antigen [43, 44].  The use of GM -CSF is 
associated with little toxicity [45-47] .  GM -CSF is a sterile, white, preservative- free, lyophilized 
powder supplied in 250 µg-dose vials.    
Recombinant human GM -CSF (rhGM -CSF), when administered intravenously or 
subcutaneously is generally well tolerated at doses ranging from 50 to 500 µg/m
2/day.  Severe 
toxic manifestations are extremely rare in patients treated with rhGM -CSF.  Diarrhea, asthenia, 
rash and malaise were the only events observed in more than 5% of the rhGM -CSF group 
 
 9-3/2015 Version  15  
  
compared with the placebo group in phase III controlled studies of patients undergoing 
autologous bone marrow transplantation.  In uncontrolled phase I/II studies for various indications, the adverse effects reported most frequently were fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, asthenia, headache and pain in the bones, chest, abdomen, joints, or muscles.  Most of these systemic events reported with rhGM -CSF administration were mild to moderate in severity and 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_15130].  Other events reported infrequently were dyspnea, edema, local injection site reactions, and rash.  Thrombosis and cardiac arrhythmia have also been reported, and there have been infrequent reports of tissue sloughing, leukemic progression, congestive heart failure, hepatomegaly, and intracranial bleeding; and isolated reports of Guillain -Barré syndrome and increased histiocytes.  
Neutropenia, although usually a pre -existing condition in the patients receiving rhGM -CSF, has 
been reported in association with administration.  There was an increased frequency of severe 
thrombocytopenia in patients receiving concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy with GM -
CSF.  Eosinophilia and other blood abnormalities may occur.  There have been rare reports of 1) sequestration of granulocytes in the lungs with respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856]; 2) a syndrome characterized by [CONTACT_15206][INVESTIGATOR_1506], hypoxia, flushing, orthostatic 
hypotension, and partial loss of consciousness; 3) peripheral edema, pericardial or pleural effusions, and capi[INVESTIGATOR_15131]; and 4) serious allergic or anaph ylactic reactions.  
 Administration of rhGM -CSF may aggravate fluid retention in patients with pre -existent edema, 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_12737], or pleural or pericardial effusions.  In some patients with pre -existing 
renal or hepatic dysfunction, elevation of the serum creatinine or bilirubin and hepatic enzymes has occurred during the administration of rhGM -CSF.  Dose reduction or interruption of rhGM -
CSF administration has resulted in a decrease to pretreatment values.  Occasional transient and reversible supraventricular arrhythmia has been reported in uncontrolled studies, particularly in patients with a previous history of cardiac arrhythmia.  
 Stimulation of marrow precursors with rhGM -CSF may result in a rapid rise in white blood cell 
count.  Dosing should be stopped if the ANC exceeds 20,000/cm
3.  rhGM- CSF may stimulate the 
growth of myeloid malignancies; therefore, caution must be exercised in its use in these malignancies or myelodysplastic syndromes.  
 Because GM -CSF will only be administered at most once  every two weeks on the current 
protocol, most of these side effects are not anticipated.  In previous vaccine studies using rhGM -
CSF as an adjuvant in an identical fashion, local skin reactions consisting of erythema and induration have occurred in many patients.  These resolved without need for treatment over a 2- [ADDRESS_153154].  Transient leukopenia (lasting only a couple 
of hours) has been observed in some patients, and resolved without treatment and without clinical sequelae [48].  In previous clinical trials with this DNA vaccine and GM -CSF, transient 
dyspnea and chest pain have been observed, occurring within 45 minutes of treatment and resolving within 10 minutes without treatment; these reactio ns have been attributed to the GM -
CSF.  One allergic reaction with tongue swelling and lip edema has been observed in one patient 
following 11 immunizations, resolving following treatment with antihistamines, and without 
sequelae.  Furthermore, the generat ion of a transient immune response to rhGM -CSF following 
its use as a vaccine adjuvant has been observed, however no clinical sequelae were noted, and the significance of this observation is not clear at present [47].

DNA vaccine preparation and administration 
 
Vials will be thawed, and the plasmid DNA itself will be used to reconstitute the GM -CSF, on 
the day of admi nistration.  Specifically:  
 For each of the DNA immunizations:  0.6 mL of 0.2 mg/mL pTVG -HP will be withdrawn and 
used to reconstitute 250 µg GM -CSF.  0.25 mL will then be drawn into each of two tuberculin 
syringes.  This effectively provides a 100-µg dose of DNA and 208 µg GM- CSF.

6. Experimental Design  
 This will be a 1:[ADDRESS_153162] of booster immunizations with a DNA vaccine encoding PAP with rhGM -CSF adjuvant following treatment with sipuleucel- T.  Stu dy arms will be defined as 
follows:  Arm 1:  sipuleucel -T – administered intravenously (i.v.) per standard of care biweekly, 
 weeks 0, 2, and 4 
 Arm 2:  sipuleucel -T – administered intravenously (i.v.) per standard of care biweekly, 
 weeks 0, 2, and 4 
pTVG-H P (100 µg) with rhGM -CSF (208 µg) administered intradermally 
(i.d.)  biweekly 4 times, then every 3 months to complete a 1- year 
treatment period (i.e. weeks 6 (day 43), 8 (day 57), 10 (day 71), 12 (month 3), then months 6 and 9) 
 
A. Study Arm Assignment and T oxicity Assessment  
 
Patients with asymptomatic -to-minimally -symptomatic, castrate -resistant, metastatic prostate 
cancer, with evidence of progressive disease, and a calculable PSA doubling time with at least [ADDRESS_153163] of clinical care.  
Subjects will be randomly assigned to a treatment group, stratified by [CONTACT_094] -treatment estimated 
survival (< 18 months, > 18 months), using the Halabi nomogram [50], and using 
laboratory/clinical data collected at screening for this determination.  This stratification was chosen given the identification in a previous clinical trial that patients with more indolent disease characteristics appeared to have a greater benefit from vaccine treatment in terms of overall 
 
 9-3/2015 Version  19  
  
survival, and the specific use of an 18 -month cutoff is currently being used in prospective 
evaluation of other vaccine trials [51].  Given the absence of significant adverse events observed 
in previous clinical trials with either sipuleucel- T or pTVG -HP, no adverse events > grade 2 are 
anticipated.  However, all study patients will be ev aluated for evidence of toxicity, and further 
accrual to either treatment arm will be discontinued if the toxicity rate is deemed to be excessive.  
A toxicity rate of 20% for Grade 3 events (or Grade > 1 autoimmune events) or 10% Grade [ADDRESS_153164] possibly related to study treatment will be considered 
excessive.  Grade 3 limited site reactions (lasting < 48 hours) and fevers/chills (lasting < 48 hours) will be excluded from this assessment as expected possible adverse events of  limited 
duration.      Evidence that the toxicity rate is excessive will be considered sufficient if the lower limits of the 90% one -sided confidence intervals for the estimates of the true toxicity rates exceed the toxicity 
limits defined above (i.e., 20% for Grade 3 events and 10% for Grade 4 events), after the first [ADDRESS_153165] been accrued.  Operationally, this will occur if any of the following events occurs within a study arm:  Grade ≥ 3 events (or Grade >1 autoimmune events) are present in at le ast 3 
out of 5, 4 out of 9 (or less), 5 out of 13 (or less), or 6 out of 15 (or less) of the subjects accrued (within a study arm).  Furthermore, accrual will be temporarily suspended if any of the following events occur:  Grade [ADDRESS_153166] 2 out of 5, 3 out of 11 (or less), or 4 out of 15 
(or less) of the subjects accrued (within a study arm).    If one of these thresholds is reached, accrual will be temporarily suspended and the study will be reviewed by [CONTACT_15215] (data and safety  monitoring committee) to consider safety and dose 
modifications with respect to treatment arm.  Once the study is suspended, it would only be 
reopened if modifications could be made, and approved by [CONTACT_15216] -IRB, to 
assure that patient safety i s reestablished.  If not, the study would be closed.   
 
B. Endpoints 
 Patients will come off study at the time of radiographic disease progression, with progression being defined only AFTER the first 3- month staging evaluation, at the time of undue toxicity (as 
defined below), or at the discretion of the patient and treating physician that other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_135198].  Patients should be discouraged from discontinuing protocol 
treatment for PSA rise only.  Patients will continue to have b lood drawn for immune studies, as 
per study calendar, up to one year after screening, even if off study prior to that time. The [ADDRESS_153167] not come off study earlier for these reasons will come off study at the end of the one -
year treatment period.  
 The primary endpoint of the trial will be an immunological endpoint – the detection of 
augmented numbers of PAP -specific effector (IFN γ-secreting and/or granzyme B-secreting) and 
memory (proliferating) T -cell immune response after immunization, using blood obtained at 6 
months for the primary analysis compared with pre -treatment.  Immune response will be 
determined as a static time point at 6 months, and “durable” immune responses will also be determined by [CONTACT_135232] 3, 9, and 12 months after study entry.    
 
 9-3/2015 Version  20  
  
All subjects will undergo radiographic imaging (CT of abdomen and pelvis and bone scan) prior 
to treatment, and at 3 -month intervals (or as clinically indic ated).  Radiographic disease 
progression will be defined using both RECIST 1.1 and PCWG2 published criteria [49],  as 
detailed in Section 7.  Based on the prior trials leading to the approval of sipuleucel -T, and 
because immune therapi[INVESTIGATOR_15141], the radiographic studies obtained at 3 months will not be used to define progression, rather will be used as the baseline for future comparison.  That is, while baseline studies will be obtained prior to study registration, and radiographic progression may be expected in 50% of patients at 3 months, this will not be used to define 
progression necessitating patients come off study, rather disease progression occurring after this initial 3 -month period.  Time to progression will be determined from registr ation for all subjects.  
1-year progression- free survival will be calculated for each treatment arm, as well as the median 
progression- free survival.   
 PSA doubling times will be calculated from all available values obtained within 3 -6 months from 
the sam e clinical laboratory (when feasible) prior to study enrollment, up to and including the 
baseline value, and used to determine a pre -treatment PSA doubling time.  Similarly, a post-
treatment doubling time will be calculated from all PSA values obtained beginning with the PSA value at day 1 and continuing until the end- of study (or 1 -year) value.   
  
7. Measurement of Effect  
 
A. Malignant Disease Evaluation  
 To assess objective response, it is necessary to estimate the overall tumor burden at baseline  (for 
purposes of comparison, “baseline” imaging will be that obtained at 3- month time point)  to 
which subsequent measurements will be compared. Measurable disease is defined by [CONTACT_12155].  
 All measurements should be recorded in metric notation by [CONTACT_2363] a ruler or calipers. The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified lesion at baseline and during follow -up. All pre-treatment  evaluations should be performed as 
closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and not more than four weeks  before 
registration.  
 The term evaluable in reference to measurability will not be used because it does not provide additional meaning or accuracy.  
 At baseline, tumor lesions will be characterized as either measurable or non -measurable.  
 NOTE:  While progression will be documented from pre-treatment staging studies  in all 
individuals, the intent of these measurements in this trial will be to determine wh ether “baseline” 
evaluation for immune -based treatments is preferable at a later time point after the therapy has 
been given the opportunity to exert an anti -tumor effect.  Hence, the “baseline” evaluation for 
determining progression will be the staging st udies performed at  day 85  (3 months).  Objective 
progression at Month 3 from the pre- treatment scans will not be used to alter treatment unless the 
 
 9-3/[ADDRESS_153168] one dimension (longest diameter 
to be recorded) as ≥ 20 mm (2.0 cm) with conventional techniques or as > 10 mm 
(1.0 cm) with spi[INVESTIGATOR_15142].  For a lymph node  to be considered pat hologically 
enlarged and measur able, it must be > 15mm in short axis when assessed by [CONTACT_15209][INVESTIGATOR_135199].  
If the measurable disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by [CONTACT_3973]/histology.  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area are not considered measurable.  
 
2. Non-Measurable  
All other lesions, including small lesions [longest diameter < 20 mm (2.0 cm) with conventional techniques or < 10 mm (1.0 cm) with spi[INVESTIGATOR_15142]], lymph nodes < 
15mm in short axis, and truly non- measurable lesions.  
 Lesions considered to be truly non- measurable include the following: bone lesions, 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, abdominal masses that are not confirmed and follow ed by [CONTACT_28171], and cystic lesions. 
 
B. Definitions of Response 
 
1. Target Lesions  
All measurable lesions , up to a maximum of two lesions per organ and five lesions in 
total, representative of all involved organs. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (those with the largest  diameters) and their suitability for accurate 
repeated measurements.  
 The sum of the diameters  (long axis for non- nodal, short axis for nodal)  of all target 
lesions will be calculated at baseline and reported as the baseline sum diameter . The 
sum diameter  will be used to characterize the objective tumor response.  
 
a. Complete Response (CR)   
The disappearance of all target lesions.  To be assigned a status of complete response, 
changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by [CONTACT_135233] m et.  PSA must also 
be < 0.2 ng/mL.  All disease must be assessed using the same technique as at 
baseline.  Lymph nodes that shrink to less than 1.0 cm are considered normal. 
 
b. Partial Response (PR)   
At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of tar get lesions  (long axis for 
non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) , taking as reference the baseline sum  
 
 9-3/[ADDRESS_153169] be assessed using the same techniques as 
at baseline.  
 
c. Progressive Disease (PD)   
At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions  (long axis for 
non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions), and a 0.[ADDRESS_153170] sum diameter  recorded since the Month 3 
baseline measurements, or the appearance of one or more new lesion(s).  
 
d. Stable Disease (SD)   
Change in tumor size is less than that required to identify a partial response or progressive disease. To be assigned a status of stable disease, measurements mus t 
have met the stable disease criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval of 12 weeks.   
2. Nontarget Lesions   
All other lesions or sites of disease  that do not meet the criteria for target lesions, 
including those  on bone scintigraphy. Mea surements of these lesions are not 
required, but the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout the study.  
a. Complete Response (CR)  
The disappearance of all nontarget lesions and undetectable PSA tumor marker levels. To be assigned a status of complete response, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by [CONTACT_135234].  
 
b. Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (SD)   
The persistence of one or more nontarget  lesion(s) and/ or the persistence of 
detectable serum PSA tumor marker levels.  To be assigned a status of stable 
disease, measurements must have met the stable disease criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval of 12 weeks.   
c. Progressive Disease (PD)   
The appearance of one or more new lesion(s) and/or unequivocal progression of existing nontarget lesions.    
NOTE:  For lesions only detectable by [CONTACT_15222], the appearance of > 2 new lesions, 
with symptoms, will constitute diseas e progression.  Without symptoms, and if no 
other evidence of disease progression (no progressive disease by [CONTACT_15223]), progression must be documented with repeat bone scintigraphy at 
least 6 weeks later demonstrating > 2 new lesi ons.  This is to eliminate the 
possibility of flair responses seen on bone scans. 
 
3. Symptomatic Deterioration   
 
 9-3/2015 Version  23  
  
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be classified as having symptomatic deterioration.  
 
4. PSA Progression  
While PSA values will be collected, and PSA kinetics (PSA responses and maximal changes in PSA by [CONTACT_15224]) monitored as secondary endpoints, PSA rise will not be u sed to determine objective disease progression.   Similar to 
the radiographic studies above, PSA progression or response will be defined using both pre -treatment (study entry) and 3 -month values as baseline values.   
 
a. PSA Complete Response:  Decrease in PS A to <0.2 ng/mL and confirmed with 
PSA measurement a minimum of four weeks later (confirmed PSA CR).  There must be no evidence of radiographic progression. 
 b. PSA Partial Response : Greater than or equal to 50% reduction in baseline PSA. 
There must be no evi dence of radiographic progression.  
 c. Best Response : This is calculated from the sequence of objective statuses.  The 
date of response will be defined as the first date at which PSA declined from baseline or normalized.   
 
i. Confirmed PSA PR : Two or more objective statuses of PSA PR or better 
a minimum of four weeks apart documented before progression. Best response for objective disease must be s table/no response or better.  
 
ii. Unconfirmed PSA PR : One objective status of PSA PR documented 
before progression, but not qualifying for confirmed PSA PR. Best response for objective disease must be Stable/no response or better. 
 
iii. No PSA Response : Objective PSA status does not qualify as a PSA PR or 
unconfirmed PSA PR. 
 
iv. Inadequate Assessment, response unknown : When best response for 
objective disease is inadequate or unknown or when PSA has been inade quately assessed, then PSA r esponse will be coded likewise. 
 
d. PSA Progression : Although not considered progression per the primary objective 
of this study, time to PSA pr ogression will be used for secondary analyses.  PSA 
progression will be def ined as a 50%  increase in PSA over the nadir PSA, and > 2 
ng/mL above the nadir, confirmed by a second value 3 or more weeks later (i.e. confirmed rising trend). If no on- study reduction has occurred, nadir would be the 
baseline value (pre -treatment or month 3 time point for analyses).   
 
C. Evaluation of Patient’s Best Overall Response 
 
 
 9-3/[ADDRESS_153171] response recorded from baseline until disease 
progression/recurrence, taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements 
recorded after baseline. The table below provides overall responses for all possible combinations 
of tumor responses in target and nontarget lesions, with or without new lesions.  To be assigned a status of complete or partial response, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by [CONTACT_135235].  
 To be assigned a status of stable disease, measurements must have met the stable disease criteria 
at least once after study entry at a minimum interval of 12 weeks.

CR = complete response; PR = partial response; SD = stable disease; PD = progressive disease  
 
1. First Documentation of Response  
The time between initiation of therapy and first documentation of PR or CR. 
 
2. Confirmation of Response  
To be assigned a status of complete or partial response, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by [CONTACT_135236] s than 
four weeks after the criteria for response are first met.  
 
3. Duration of Response  
Duration of overall response – the period measured from the time that measurement 
criteria are met for complete or partial response (whichever status is recorded first)  
until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since treatment started.  
 
a. Duration of Overall Complete Response  
The period measured from the time measurement criteria are met for complete response until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented.  
 
b. Duration of Stable Disease  
A measurement from baseline (3 month) until the criteria for disease progression is 
met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since baseline. To be 
 
 9-3/[ADDRESS_153172] follow-up in censored patients.  
5. Time to Objective Disease Progression   
Time to progression will be defined as a function of baseline time points in two ways:  
(1) Time to progression from randomization: Time elapsed from 
randomization until disease progression or death.  If a patient doesn’t experience 
a disease progression or death event before the end of the follow -up period, then 
the observation for this patient will be censored.  (2) Time to progression from [ADDRESS_153173] -randomization:  Time elapsed 
from the 3 months disease progression assessment until disease progression or death. If a patient doesn’t experience a disease progression or death event before the end of the follow -up period, then the observation for this patient will be 
censored.  
 
 The intent of defining time to progression as a function of baseline time points (date of randomization and 3- month disease assessment) is to determine if immunization prolongs 
the time to pro gression using a delayed baseline evaluation after the treatment has been 
given time to elicit an anti-tumor response.   
 
6. Methods of Measurement   
Imaging based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_12148]. The same imaging modality must be  used throughout the study to measure disease. 
 
a. CT and MRI  
CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the best currently available and most reproducible methods for measuring target lesions. Conventional CT and MRI should be performed with contiguous cuts of [ADDRESS_153174] decline to < 0. 2 ng/mL for a patient to be considered in complete clinical 
response when all tumor lesions have disappeared.  
 
 9-3/2015 Version  26  
  
c. Clinical Examination   
Clinically detected lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes). For skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate size of the lesion, is recommended.  Photographs should be retained at the institution. 
  
8. Definition and Management of Limiting Toxicities and Adverse Events 
 
A treatment -limiting toxicity will be defined as any Grade 3 or greater toxicity (using the NCI 
Common Terminology Criteria version 4, Appendix C) with an attribution of at least possibly related to the study or treatment procedures, and occurring between the pre- study visit and within 
one month of the final immunization.  For  purposes of this study, a Grade [ADDRESS_153175] possibly related to vaccine, the vaccination schedule will be held until the toxicity resolves to Grade 2 or less (Grade 1 for autoimmune toxicity).  There will be no dose reductions due to adverse events.  If a patient develops a second Grade 3 event (or Grade 2 
autoimmune toxicity) that is  believed at least possibly due to treatment, or any Grade 4 event, no 
further vaccinations will be given and the patient will be removed from study.  If the adverse 
event occurs d uring the initial 12 weeks of treatment , a treatment delay of up to one week will be 
permitted, with the expectation that the event resolve to < grade 1 for retreatment, and th at 
subsequent immunizations will follow at 2 -week intervals.  A delay > 1 week will result in a 
skipped dose.  If the adverse event occurs during the 3-month booster phase , vaccination  will be 
held in the event of toxicity attributed to vaccination.  If the toxicity observed is believed to be a 
result of the immune response generated, a regimen of corticosteroids may be administered, as 
clinically indicated, and after discussion with the  study and local PIs.  The following dose 
schedule could be used: 
  Day 1:  Intravenous Solu-Medrol at 1 mg/kg IV q12 hr 
 Day 2:  Intravenous Solu-Medrol at 1 mg/kg IV x 1  Day 3 -4:  Prednisone at 30 mg p.o. bid 
 Day 5 -6:  Prednisone at 15 mg p.o. bid 
 Day 7 -8:  Prednisone at 10 mg p.o. bid 
 Day 9 -10:  Prednisone at 10 mg p.o. qd 
 Day 11 -12:  Prednisone at 5 mg p.o. qd 
 Mild, low -grade fevers and chills, and local skin site reactions, are expected events following 
immunization and/or treatment with GM -CSF.  Grade [ADDRESS_153176] 48 hours after an immunization.  Constitutional 
inflammatory events > grade 1, or persisting beyond 48 hours after immunization, will be managed with ibuprofen, if needed, up to 600 mg three times daily.  
 
9. Plan of Treatment  
 
The following section describes the schedule for prescreening, sipuleucel -T collections and 
infusions, vaccine inoculations, and clinical and laboratory evaluations.  
 
 9-3/2015 Version  27  
  
 When a chemistry panel is indicated the following tests are performed:  creatinine, 
SGOT , total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, amylase, and LDH.  Whenever a CBC is indicated, 
this shall include differential and platelet count.  
 Sipuleucel -T infusions  should be 14 days apart, but  may be up to 21 days apart to 
accommodate scheduling difficulties. T he study calendar will then be delayed accordingly by [CONTACT_135237] . For a delay  greater than a week, the nature of this delay will be discussed 
with the medical monitor  or PI  [INVESTIGATOR_135200]. For subj ects on 
Arm 2, biweekly DNA v accination (Immunization #1- 3) can be +/ - 3 days and quarterly 
vaccinations  (Immunizations #4-6) can be +/ - 7 days from  the expected date (determined from 
prior visit).  
 All subjects should have blood drawn for  immune monitoring per study calendar (+/ - 7 
days) unless they come off study early. Subjects that come off study early should still have all of 
the immune draws done, but the blood draws can correspond with standard of care visits (i.e. 
once off study, they don’t need to come to clinic  just for the immune draw). This plan is 
summarized in the Study S chema ( pg. 4), S tudy Calendar ( pg. 5), and Blood Draws for Research  
table (Appendix B)

10. Response Monitoring  
 
A. Immunological Monitoring 
 
Blood will be collected by [CONTACT_15234] (up to 150 mL) or leukapheresis (50-100 
mL) pre-immun ization, after the initial three sipuleucel- T treatments, and at quarterly intervals 
up to one year, for immunological monitoring.  From the heparinized blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be prepared by [CONTACT_15235] -Paque using 
standard techniques.  PBMC will be used directly for analysis, and residual material 
cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen using 90% autologous serum collected at the time of blood draw, or 90% fetal calf serum, and 10% DMSO.  Sera will be prepared from the red -top tubes 
and stored in aliquots at –80°C for antibody analyses.  IFN γ and granzyme B ELISPOT analysis, 
PAP-specific T -cell proliferation, flow cytometric  assays of antigen -specific cytokine secretion, 
and ELISA tests for antigen -specific antibodies, will be the primary methods of analysis.  The 
primary antigens tested will be PAP (experimental), PSA (negative control), and tetanus toxoid (positive control).  The primary immune analysis will be conducted at the 6 -month time point, 
and compared with the pre -treatment time point, and for patients to be evaluable for immune 
response (primary endpoint), blood (PBMC and serum) from this time point must be available for analysis.  However, immune monitoring will be conducted at the other time points indicated in secondary analyses to evaluate kinetic measures of immunity, and evaluate whether durable immune responses of particular phenotypes are elicited and/or maintained.  Assays may be 
conducted at the time of sample collection (fresh) and/or batched and performed at one time from multiple cryopreserved samples collected at different time points.  Other methods of effector and regulatory T-cell response to PAP and  other human tissue antigens may be used.  
Some assays may assess immune responses to the PA2024 (PAP -GM-CSF) fusion antigen or to 
GM-CSF.  
 
A.1. Quantitative assessment of PAP -specific CD8+ T -cell effector immunity  
 
 
 9-3/2015 Version  32  
  
PAP-specific IFN γ- and granzyme B -secreting T -cell precursor frequency quantification by 
[CONTACT_15236] : ELISPOT will be used as the preferred methodology, as it permits analysis of low -
frequency events (LOD < 1:10,000 cells) and also permits simultaneous analysis of 
cryopreserved batched specimens  [23] .  IFNγ and granzyme B will be preferred analytes 
evaluated, as these are specifically associated with inflammatory/tissue -destructive (Th1 -type, 
cytolytic) immune responses  (see Figure 3).  Specifically, cryopreserved PBMC from subjects at 
the various time points will be thawed, rested, and then transferred to 96- well nitrocellulose 
microtiter (ELISPOT) plates previously coated with monoclonal capture antibodies specific for IFNγ or granzyme B.  10
5 cells per well will be cultured in the presence of media (RPMI 1640 
supplemented with L -glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, ß -merc aptoethanol and 10% human AB 
serum) only (no antigen), 2 µg/ml PAP protein, 2 µg/ml PSA protein (negative control), 250 
ng/ml tetanus toxoid, or 2.5 µg/ml PHA (positive mitogenic control) for 24 -48 hours.  Plates will 
then be washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween -20 and incubated for 2.5 hours at room 
temperature with 50 µl/well PBS containing 5 µg/ml biotinylated detection antibodies for either 
IFNγ or granzyme B.  After incubation, wells will be washed with PBS, and further incubated 
with 100 µl/well str eptavidin- labeled alkaline phosphatase (BioRad, Hercules, CA) and then 
developed with 100 µl/well BCIP/NBT colorimetric substrate (BioRad).  The colorimetric 
reaction will be stopped by [CONTACT_15237], and wells will be allowed to dry completely before spots are enumerated with an ELISPOT automatic plate reader.   
 REPORTING AND RESPONSE DEFINITION:  Results will be presented as the mean (+/ - 
standard deviation) number of spot- forming -units (sfu)  per 10
6 cells (frequency) , calculated by 
[CONTACT_135241], normalized to [ADDRESS_153182], with p < 0.05 (two-sided) defined as a significant antigen -
specific T-cell response.  A significant antigen -specific response resulting from immunization 
will then be defined as a PAP -specific response detectable at the [ADDRESS_153183] -treatment time 
point (or other post- treatment time point evaluated)  that is significantly higher than to media only 
(as above), at least 3 -fold higher than the mean baseline value, and wi th a frequency > 1 0 per 106 
PBMC .   
 
A.2. Assessment of PAP -specific memory T -cell immunity  
 
Ability of T -cell lines to proliferate in response to antigenic stimulation:  T -cell proliferation in 
response to antigen stimulation as a measure of memory T -cell resp onses will be assessed by a 
PKH26 dye dilution assay  (see Figure 3) .  Specifically , PBMC will be labeled in vitro with 
PKH26 dye (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) according to manufacturer’s recommendation.  T -cell 
cultures with and without antigens will be establish ed in replicates using 2x105 peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMC)/well, plated in 96- well round bottom microtiter plates (Corning, 
Cambridge, MA), in media consisting of RPMI 1640 (Gibco) and supplemented with L-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, ß -mercaptoethanol and 10% human AB serum (ICN Flow, 
Costa Mesa, CA).  Antigens may include 1 µg/ml of a pool of peptide spanning the amino acid sequence of PAP , 2 µg/ml PAP protein (Research Diagnostics Inc., Flanders, NJ), 2 µg/ml PSA 
(Research Diagnostics I nc.), 250 ng/ml tetanus toxoid, and 2.5 µg/ml phytohemaglutinin (PHA).  
After 6 -7 days of culture at 37
oC/5% CO 2, cell surface markers will be stained to characterize the 
T-cell phenotype and memory phenotype of proliferating cells (CD45RO, CCR7).  Flow 
 
 9-3/2015 Version  33  
  
cytometery will be used to identify and enumerate CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T cells co -
staining for PKH26.  The frequency of antigen- specific CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T cells will 
be determined by [CONTACT_135242]26+ events among CD4+ or C D8+ 
events (estimated from the number of cells and number of cell divisions by [CONTACT_135243], Verity Software House, Topsham, ME), and subtracting the mean precursor 
frequency of proliferating cells under media-only conditions.   
REPORTING AND RESPONSE DEFINITION:  Data will be reported as a mean and standard 
deviation of antigen- specific (PAP -specific) proliferative precursors per 106 PBMC using 
triplicate assessments for each antigen -stimulation condition.  Comparison of experime ntal wells 
with control, no antigen, wells  will be performed using a two-tailed Student’s t test, with p < 
0.[ADDRESS_153184]- treatment time point (or other post- treatment time point evaluated)  
that is significantly higher than to media only (as above), at least 3 -fold higher than the  mean 
baseline value, and with a frequency > 1 00 per 106 CD4+ or CD8+ T cells .   
 
A.3. Assessment of antigen -specific antibody immunity  
 
Enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of antibodies responses to PAP :  
The presence of a coexisting hu moral immune response to PAP will be evaluated by [CONTACT_135244] [26].  Specifically, Immulon -4 
ELISA plates (Dynex Tech nologies Inc.) will be coated with 2 µg/ml purified PAP protein 
(Research Diagnostics, Inc.) in 0.1 M NaHCO 3/Na 2CO 3 buffer (pH 9.6) overnight at 4oC.  After 
blocking with PBS/1% BSA for 1 hour at room temperature, wells will be washed with PBS + 0.05% Twee n-20 (PBS -Tween) and then incubated for 1 hour with human sera diluted 1:25, 
1:50, 1:100 and 1:200.  After washing, plates will then be sequentially incubated with a peroxidase- conjugated anti-human IgG detection antibody (Amersham), followed by [CONTACT_135245] (Kierkegaard and Perry Laboratories).  The color reaction will be stopped with 1N H
2SO 4 and the optical density measured at 450 nm.  Antibody titers for PAP -
specific IgG antibodies will be determined as previously described [26]. 
REPORTING AND RESPONSE DEFINITION:  These are not strictly quantitative assays.  IgG response will be reported graphically demonstrating sera dilution curves, and by [CONTACT_15247] – defined 
as the highest sera dilution at which IgG responses are detectable above the mean + [ADDRESS_153185] deviations of the negative control.  A positive IgG response resulting from immunization will be defined as an antigen -specific (anti -PAP) IgG titer at leas t 4-fold higher than the baseline titer 
detectable at the [ADDRESS_153186]- treatment time point (or other post- treatment time point 
evaluated).  
 
A.4. Assessment of antigen -specific regulatory immune responses 
 
Trans- vivo delayed -type hypersensitivity (tvDTH) evaluation :  7.5-10 x 106 PBMC obtained 
from patients prior to and after immunization will be co-injected into the footpads of 6- to-8-week 
old SCID mice with 1 µg of PAP protein (Fitzgerald Industries, Acton, MA), or tetanus toxoid 
(TT/D; Aventis Pasteur, Bridgewater, NJ) as a recall antigen , versus phosphate- buffered saline 
(PBS) alone as a negative control.  Antigen–driven swelling w ill be  determined as previously 
described [52].  DTH reactivity after 24 hours will be shown as the change in footpad thickness 
in multiples of 10-4 inches, measured using a dial thick ness gauge (Mitutoyo, Japan), and net 
 
 9-3/[ADDRESS_153187] of neutralizing antibodies, PBMC w ill be mixed 
with 1 µg of PAP antigen and 25 µg of either control IgG or rabbit anti -human TGF -β, goat anti -
human IL -10 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), or 1 µg of mouse anti -human CTLA -4 
monoclonal Ab (clone AS32, Ab Solutions, Mountain View, CA) and injected into the footpads 
of SCID mice as ab ove.  The extent of by[CONTACT_135246], defining an antigen -specific 
regulatory response, w ill be measured as inhibition of recall antigen  (tetanus)  response in the 
presence of PAP antigen (or prostate -specific antigen (PSA) as a negative control) and c alculated 
as previously described [53].  Given the nature  of the testing  and the requirement for SCID mice , 
data will be shown derived from single measurements, but with key experiments repeated 2 -3 
times  for confirmation.   
REPORTING AND RESPONSE DEFINITION:  These are not strictly quantitative assays.  An antigen -specific (PAP -specific) regulatory response for these purposes will be defined as an 
inhibition of a recall antigen (tetanus toxoid) DTH response by > 50% when performed in the 
presence of PAP; i.e. a DTH response in the presence of PAP+TT that is < 50% of that obtained 
with TT only.   
 
A.5. Assessment of antigen -spread to other prostate- associated antigens  
 
High -throughput immunoblot (HTI) :  A secondary objective of the study will be to determine if 
patients treated develop “off -target” prostate cancer antigen -specific immune responses as 
evidence of antigen spread.  Exploratory studies will evaluate T -cell responses to non- targeted 
antigens.  However, the primary evaluat ion will be to evaluate IgG responses to a panel of 
prostate- associated antigens as we have previously reported in patients treated with vaccines or 
other immune -modulating agents [54-56] .  IgG specific for 126 antigens, including 29 cancer -
testis antigens [57, 58]  and 97 prostate antigens frequently immunologically recognized [59-62] 
will be identified by [CONTACT_15249] a high -density phage array expressing these individual antigens, 
as we have previously reported [54, 56, 57].  The primary analysis will be conducted using sera obtained at 6 months, and compared with IgG responses identified at baseline, to determine whether IgG specific for individual antigens are elicited over time.  Other time points will be assessed to determine the durability and kinetics of immune response development, and confirmatory ELISA studies will be performed if feasible.   
REPORTING AND RESPONSE DEFINITION:  A positive IgG response will be defined as an immunoreactive spot to a defined antigen, scored by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_153188] 2 of 3 replicates per immunoblot membrane.  An IgG response resulting from immunization will be defined as an immunoreactive antigen identified at the 6 -month (or 
other post -treatmen t time for subsequent analyses) time point that was not identified at the pre -
treatment time point.   
 
B. Circulating Tumor Cell (CTC) Enumeration  
 
CTC will be enumerated at the same time points as for immune evaluation (pre -treatment, after 6 
weeks, and at q uarterly intervals for up to one year) using an ELISPOT methodology as 
described above, however using capture and detection antibodies specific for PSA [63].  This 
methodology has been used to count PSA -secreting cells directly from peripheral blood with a 
frequency < 1 per million PBMC.  Given the rarity of these cells, they will not be normally 
distributed among individual wells of an ELISPOT plate.  Hence, PBMC will be plated at 
 
 9-3/2015 Version  35  
  
200,000 cells/well of a 96- well plate, and all spots will be counted (i.e. screening for events 
among ~20 x 106 total PBMC).  Multiple replicates to determine standard deviation are not 
feasible.  Other methods of CTC enumeration, such as by [CONTACT_4133], may also be used. 
 
C. Serum PSA Doubling Time Response 
 
See Section 12 for further details.  Serum PSA doubling -time response will be considered a 
secondary endpoint.  The pre -treatment serum PSA doubling time will be calculated from all 
serum PSA values available for the three -month period prior to study treatment, not on other 
treatments for prostate cancer, up to and including the PSA value obtained at screening, using the Memorial Sloan -Kettering Cancer Center nomogram 
(http://www.mskcc.org/applications/nomograms/prostate/PsaDoublingTime.aspx
).  The post -
treatment serum PSA doubling time will be calculated using the same algorithm and using all 
serum PSA values available during the time patients are on study beginning with the PSA value obtained at day 1.   
REPORTING AND RESPONSE DEFINITION:  PSA doubling times for the pre -treatment and 
post-treatment periods will be defined as above.  An increase in the PSA doubling time to at least 
double the baseline value will be defined as a PSA doubling time “response” [64]. 
  
11. Reporting Adverse Events  
 Please see section 1 4 below, which contains in detail the policy and procedures for patient safety 
monitoring and adverse event reporting.  
A. Definition  
 An adverse event is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding  unless they are grade 1 and deemed clinically insignificant ), symptom or 
disease temporally associated with a medical treatment or procedure, regardless of whether it is considered related to the treatment or procedure. Note t hat for this study grade [ADDRESS_153189] 
possibly related to study treatment.  Serious adverse events are any events occurring that result in any of the following outcome:  
1. Subject death  
2. Life-threatening adverse event  
3. In patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
4. Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
5. Congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 
 
 9-3/2015 Version  36  
  
Adverse events are classified by [CONTACT_135247], as described in Appendix A.  The defined grades use the 
following general guidelines:  
  0 No adverse event or within normal limits  
 1 Mild adverse event  
 2 Moderate adverse event  
 3 Severe adverse event  
 4 Life-threatening or disabling adverse event 
 5 Fatal adverse event  
 
B. Procedure for Reporting Adverse Events 
 Regulations defining the responsibilities for reporting adverse events are defined by [CONTACT_135248] (NCI CTEP, http://ctep.info.nih.gov).  
Please see the details of adverse event reporting in Section 14.C.  
 Appropriate clinical, diagnostic, and laboratory measures to attempt to delineate the cause of the adverse reaction in question must be performed and the results reported.  All tests that reveal an abnormality considered to be drug - or treatment -related will be repeated at appropriate intervals 
until the course is determined or a return to normal values occurs.  Information will be r ecorded 
as noted above.     
12. Statistical Considerations 
 
A. Overview  
 This a pi[INVESTIGATOR_135201] a DNA vaccine encoding PAP with rhGM -CSF adjuvant following treatment with sipuleucel -T. 
The rationale for conducting this trial is summarized in Section 2 (E).  
 
B. Objectives  
 The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether immunization with a DNA vaccine encoding prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP, pTVG -HP) can augment PAP -specific effector and 
memory T cells following treatment with sipuleucel- T.  
 
The secondary objectives are:  
1. To determine 12- month progression- free survival  
2. To determine median time -to-progression as a function of baseline time point 
(pretreatment or [ADDRESS_153190] treatment)  
3. To evaluate effects of treatment on changes in serum PSA level and changes in PSA 
doubling time  
 
The laboratory and clinical exploratory objectives are: 
1. To determine overall survival 
 
 9-3/2015 Version  37  
  
2. To evaluate effects of treatmen t on number of circulating tumor cells as determined by 
[CONTACT_135218]  
3. To evaluate PAP -specific antibody and T -cell immune responses following treatment 
with sipuleucel-T and DNA vaccine 
4. To determine whether PAP -specific immune response is associated with pro longed (1 
year) progression -free survival  
5. To determine whether baseline immune responses (Th1 type or regulatory type) predict 
for immune responses elicited/augmented following treatment with sipuleucel- T +/- DNA 
vaccine  
6. To determine whether treatment elic its immunologic antigen spread to other prostate 
associated antigens  
 
C. Definitions/Endpoints 
 
C.1. Primary Immunological Endpoint: Immune Response  
 
An immune response will be defined based on the detection of augmented number s of PAP -
specific effector (IFNγ -secreting and/or granzyme B -secreting) and /or memory (proliferating) T -
cell immune response after immunization, using blood obtained at [ADDRESS_153191] -treatment time point that is significantly (p<0.05, two -
sided using a two- sample t -test) higher than to media only, at lea st 3-fold higher than the mean 
baseline value, and with a frequency > 10 per 10
6 PBMC , based on 8-well replicate assays (for 
ELISPOT -based assays) or triplicate assays (for proliferation analysis).  Otherwise, a patient will 
be declared as an immune non-responder.  
  
Immune response will be determined as a static time point at 6 months, and “durable” immune responses will also be determined by [CONTACT_46917] a PAP -specific immune response by [CONTACT_135249] 3, 9, or 12 months after study entry.   
 
C.2. Secondary Clinical and Immunological Endpoints 
 
C.2.1. Time to Progression  
 Time to progression will be defined as a function of baseline time points in two ways :  
 
(1) Time to progression from random ization :  Time elapsed from randomization until 
disease progression or death.  If a patient doesn’t experience a disease progression or 
death event before the end of the follow -up period, then the observation for this 
patient will be censored.  
 (2) Time to progression from [ADDRESS_153192] -randomization: Time elapsed from the 3 
months disease progression assessment until disease progression or death. If a patient doesn’t experience a disease progression or death event before the end of the follow -
up period, then the observation for this patient will be censored. 
 
 
 9-3/2015 Version  38  
  
The rationale for defining time to progression as a function of baseline time points (date of 
randomization and 3- month disease assessment ) is described in Section 6 (B). 
 
C.2.2. Twelve-month Progression Free Sur vival Rate  
 The 12- month progression free survival rate will be defined as the proportion of patients 
progression free at the 12 month (post- randomization) disease assessment time point.  
 
C.2.3. Overall Survival 
 Overall survival will be defined as the time interval from randomization to death from any cause 
or to the last follow -up in censored patients. 
 
C.2.4. PSA Response 
 PSA complete response will be defined a decrease in PSA to <0.2 ng/mL.  The decrease must be 
confirmed with PSA measurement a minimum of four weeks later (confirmed PSA CR).  PSA 
partial response will be defined as reduction of at least 50% in baseline PSA.   
C.2.5. PSA Doubling Time 
 PSA doubling time (PS ADT) will be defined  as the time it takes for the PSA value to double.  
PSADT will be calculated f or each patient pre- treatment and post -treatment.  The pre- treatment 
PSADT will be calculated from all available values obtained within [ADDRESS_153193] -treatment PSADT will be calculated for each 
patient as the log 2 divided by [CONTACT_135250], based on the linear regression model of log (PSA value) on time. 
 
C.2.6. Evaluable for Immune Response 
 
All p atients who complete sipuleucel -T treatment at weeks 0, 2, and 4, and who have a n immune 
response assessment at month [ADDRESS_153194] been treated according to protocol, i.e., all inclusion/exclusion criteria are satisfied, and adequate treatment compliance of sipuleucel -T treatment and vaccine 
(pTVG -HP) is achieved.  
  
D. Study Design  
 
The study is designed as a randomized, two- arm, open -label, single institution pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251].   Study 
arms will be defined as follows: 
 
 
 9-3/2015 Version  39  
  
Arm 1:  sipuleucel -T – administered intravenously (i.v.) per standard of care biweekly, 
weeks 0, 2, and 4. 
 
Arm 2:  sipuleucel -T – administered intravenously (i.v.) per standard of care biweekly,  
weeks 0, 2, and 4  pTVG- HP (100 µg) with rhGM -CSF (208 µg) administered intradermall y (i.d.) 
biweekly 4 times, then every 3 months to complete a 1- year treatment period (i.e. 
weeks 6 , 8, 10, 12, then months 6, 9) 
 Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned in 1:1 fashion to either Arm 1 or Arm 2.   
E. Randomization and Stratification  
 
Eligible patients will be randomized to the two study arms with an allocation ratio of 1:1. The randomi zation will be based on permutated blocks of size 2- 4, stratified by [CONTACT_135251] (< 
18 months, > 18 months) using the Halabi nomogram  [50]. 
 
F. Sample Size Estimation and Accrual  
 The endpoint of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_135202], i.e., the immune response rate at 6 months.  Based on published results from a randomized trial using sipuleucel -T only in this 
population, in which proliferative T -cell responses specific for PAP were detected in 15 of 55 
(27.3%) patients after immunization [7], and results from a phase I trial with this DNA vaccine 
only in which PAP -specific cytolytic T -cell responses were amplified after immunization in 7 
out 12 (58%) evaluable patients [23], it is anticipated that the immune respon se rate in the 
sipuleucel -T alone arm (Arm 1) will be 25% and that the addition of the pTVG- HP vaccine (Arm 
2) will boost the response rate to at least 75%.  An increase of 50% in the immune response rate 
will be considered as a clinically important differ ence.  The following table shows the required 
sample sizes (per arm) to detect various differences in the immune response rates between the two arms with 80% power at the one -sided 5% significance level.  These calculations are based 
on the stratified Mantel -Haenszel test with exact p -values.

following table shows the attainable power levels to detect various differences in the immune response rates between arms at the one- sided 5% significance level, assuming a sample size of 
28 evaluable (for immune response) patients .

30% 53% 65% 76% 85% 
 A difference in the immune response rate of 55% between the two arms will be detected with at least 84% power.  Analogously, a difference in the efficacy response rate of only 40% between the two arms will be detected with 53% power at the one -sided 5% sig nificance level.  In order 
to account for unevaluable patients, 30 eligible patients (15 per arm) will be accrued and randomized.  Based on past experience with this patient population treated at our institution, we 
anticipate that the proposed total number of [ADDRESS_153196] 12 months.   
G. Statistical Analysis Plan  
 
G.1. General  
 This section outlines the statistical analysis strategy and procedures for the study.  If after the 
study has be gun changes are made to primary and/or key secondary objectives, or the statistical 
methods related to those objectives, then the protocol will be amended. 
Summary tabulations will be presented that will display the number of observations, mean, 
standard deviation, median, range, minimum, and maximum for continuous variables and the number and percent per category for ordinal and categorical data.  All endpoints of this study 
will be presented graphically where possible using boxplots and histograms for continuous variables and (stacked) bar charts for categorical variables.  Data analysis will be performed 
using SAS
® (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina) version 9.2 or greater.  
 There are many comparisons made between the two trial arms for multiple measurements, both 
clinical and laboratory.  However, since this a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], no adjustment will be made for 
 
 9-3/[ADDRESS_153197] at a significance level of 0.05 without adjustment for 
multiplicity.  
 
G.2. Baseline Comparability  
 All measurements (variables) collected at baseline will be summarized and compared between study arms.   These include demographic variables, lab parameters (CBC and platelets, creatinine, 
alk phos, SGOT, total bilirubin, amylase, LDH, serum testosterone and PSA and PAP) and medical history information.  Comparisons between study arms of ba seline variables on a 
continuous scale will be performed using a two- sample t -test and/or nonparametric Wilcoxon 
Rank Sum test.  Comparisons between study arms of baseline variables on a categorical scale 
will be performed using Fisher’s exact test.  
 
G.3. Anal ysis of the Primary Immunological Endpoint:  Immune Response Rate 
 
Immune responses, obtained at [ADDRESS_153198] , stratified by [CONTACT_135251] (< 18 
months, > 18 months) using the Halabi nomogram [50].  Due to the small sample size, exact p -
values will be computed using Zelen’s exact  test for equal odds ratios for stratified 2 X 2 tables.  
 
As a secondary analysis, “durable” immune responses will be determined by [CONTACT_135252] 3, 9, and [ADDRESS_153199] , stratified by [CONTACT_135251] (< 18 months, > 18 months) using the Halabi 
nomogram [50].  Furthermore, a generalized linear mixed effects mod el for binomial data with a 
logit link function will be employed to evaluate the longitudinal effects of immune responses measured at the 3 -month intervals.  
 
G.4. Analysis of Secondary and Exploratory C linical and Immunological Endpoints 
 
G.4.1. Analysis of 12-month Progression- Free Survival Rate 
 The 12- month progression- free survival rate will be estimated for each arm using the Kaplan -
Meier method.  The 12 -month progression- free survival rate, along with the corresponding two-
sided 95% confidence intervals, will be  reported for each arm.  In order to evaluate the 12-month 
progression- free rate as a function of baseline time point (pretreatment or [ADDRESS_153200] 
treatment, the analysis will be conducted using two different baseline values: (1) Date of 
randomization, and (2) 3- months disease assessment.  
 
G.4.2. Analysis of Progression-Free Survival  
 
 
 9-3/2015 Version  42  
  
Progression- free survival will be estimated for each arm using the Kaplan -Meier method.  The 
median progression- free survival, along with the corresponding two- sided 95% confidence 
intervals, will be reported for each arm.  The comparison of progression -free survival between 
study arms will be performed using the stratified (by [CONTACT_135253],  < 18 months 
vs. > 18 months) log -rank test.  In order to evaluate progression- free rate as a function of 
baseline time point (pretreatment or [ADDRESS_153201] treatment, the analysis will be conducted 
using two different baseline values: (1) Date of randomization, and (2) 3- months disease 
assessment.  
 
G.4.3. Analysis of Overall Survival  
 
Overall survival will be estimated  for each arm using the Kaplan -Meier met hod.  The median 
overall survival, along with the corresponding two- sided 95% confidence intervals, will be 
reported for each arm.  The comparison of overall survival between study arms will be 
performed using the stratified log- rank test.  
 
G.4.4. Analysis of Changes in PSA Values, PSA Kinetics and PSA Doubling 
Time  
 PSA values will be summarized using standard descriptive statistics for each defined assessment 
time point (baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months) in terms of number of observations, means, standard deviat ions, medians and ranges, stratified by [CONTACT_30157].  Percentage changes from baseline to the 
3, 6, 9, and [ADDRESS_153202], i f the percentage changes are 
not normally distributed. Analysis of variance, which will include study arm and baseline predicted survival (< 18 months  vs. ≥ 18 months ) will be used to compare percentage changes in 
PSA values between study arms.  If the percentage changes are not normally distributed and if a 
normality -improving data transformation is unavailable, then the stratified, nonparametric 
Wilcoxon rank- sum tests will replace the planned ANOVA.  Changes in PSA levels will be 
presented graphically us ing waterfall plots.  
 PSA response rates (CR / PR) will be summarized in tabular format and compared between study 
arms using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test , stratified by [CONTACT_135254] (< 18 
months vs. ≥ 18 months ). 
 PSA doubling time for each patient is estimated as: PSADT = log(2)/b, where b is the OLS estimator of slope parameter of the linear regression model log(PSA) = α +β*month + ε.  This method may result in negative PSA doubling time estimates.  For analysis p urposes, negative 
PSA doubling time estimates will be replaced by [CONTACT_135255] (e.g., by [CONTACT_135256]).  Serum PSA doubling time will be summarized for each study arm by [CONTACT_135257], standard 
deviations, medians and ranges.  Percentage changes between pre -treatment and post -treatment 
PSA doubling times will be computed.  Changes between pre - and post -treatment serum PSA 
doubling time within each arm will be assessed using a paired t -test and/or non- parametric 
Wilcoxon Signed Rank test.  A two- sample t -test or non- parametric Wilcoxon Rank Sum test 
will be used to compare the changes in PSA doubling time from the pre - to the post -treatment 
assessments betw een study arms.  
 
 9-3/[ADDRESS_153203].  Results will be presented graphically over time, and trends (increase, 
decrease, stable) will be assessed over time.    
 
G.5.2. Analysis for evaluating PAP -specific antibody and T -cell immune 
responses following treatment with sipuleucel-T and DNA vaccine 
 PAP-specific antibody and T -cell immune responses, evaluated by [CONTACT_135258] 10.A, following treatment with sipuleucel- T and DNA vaccine will be 
summarized in tabular format.  
 
G.5.3. Analysis for evaluating whether PAP -specific immune response is 
associated with prolonged (1 year) progression- free survival  
 Logistic regression analysis will be conducted to evaluate whether PAP -specific immune 
response is associated with prolonged (1- year) progression -free survival. The dependent 
variables will be 12 -month progression free survival while treatment arm and PAP -specific 
immune responses (no vs. yes) will be included as covariates.  The results will be reported in terms of odds ratios and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals.   
G.5.4. Analysis for evaluating whether baseline immune responses (Th1 type or 
regulatory type) pr edict for immune responses elicited/augmented 
following treatment with sipuleucel- T +/- DNA vaccine  
 Logistic regression an alysis will be conducted to evaluate whether  baseline immune responses 
(Th1 -type or regulatory type) predict for immune responses eli cited/augmented following 
treatment with sipuleucel- T +/- DNA vaccine.  6-month and durable immune response at 3,6 or 
12 months will be included as dependent variable s in this analysis while treatment arm and 
baseline PAP-specific immune responses (no vs. yes) will be included as covariates.  Odds ratios 
and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals will be reported.   
G.5.5. Analysis for evaluating whether treatment elicits immunologic antigen 
spread to other prostate associated antigens  
 The detection of ant igen spread to other prostate associated antigens , and the identification of 
specific antigens recognized,  will be analyzed descriptively.   In addition, l ogistic regression 
analysis will be conducted to evaluate whether antigen spread is associated with the generation 
 
 9-3/2015 Version  44  
  
of PAP -specific immune responses elicited as a result of treatment .  The dependent variables will 
be the detection of IgG responses to > 1 “off -target” antigen at 6 months  (and not present pre -
treatment) while treatment arm and 6-month PAP-speci fic immune responses (no vs. yes) will be 
included as covariates.  The results will be reported in terms of odds ratios and the corresponding 
95% confidence intervals.  
  
13. Administrative Considerations  
 
A. Specimen Handling  
 Upon entry into the study, each subject will be assigned a unique identification number.  All materials collected on that subject will be labeled with that number only, for reasons of confidentiality.  Lymphocytes collected will be stored in liquid nitroge n, and sera will be 
aliquoted and stored at –80°C in the research laboratory of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_135203].   
B. Institutional Review Board  
 In accordance with federal regulations (21 CFR 312.66), an Institutional Review Board (IRB) that complies with the regulations in [ADDRESS_153204] review and approve this protocol and the 
informed consent form prior to the initiation of the study at each investigator site.  In addition, the study cannot be instituted without FDA approval of the vaccine formulations.  Finally, the trial will be conducted with adherence to this protocol, following good clinical practice (GCP) guidelines, and in compliance with other applicable regulatory requirements.  Any modifications to the protocol must follow the procedure as outlined in Section [ADDRESS_153205] also be informed that they may withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without jeopardizing their future treatment.  In accordance with Federal regulations (21 CFR 312), all patients must sign the IRB-approved consent form.   
 
 
14. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
 
A. Oversight and Monitoring Plan 
The UWCCC Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) is responsible for monitoring data quality and subject safety for all UWCCC clinical studies.  A summary of DSMC activities follows: 
• Review of all clinical trials  conducted at the UWCCC for data integrity and safety  
• Review of all serious adverse events requiring expedited reporting as defined in the 
protocol 
• Review of reports generated by [CONTACT_135259]

Phase II Trials 
 
Data related to thes e trials are discussed at regularly scheduled Disease Oriented Working Group 
meetings where the result of each subject’s treatment is discussed and the discussion is documented in the minutes. The discussion will include for each treatment arm/dose level, the 
number of subjects, significant toxicities as described in the protocol, dose adjustments, and responses observed.  Protocol Summary Reports are required for submission to the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee for review.  
 
B. Review and Oversight Requi rements  
 
B.1. Serious Adverse Event  – Reported Within 24 Hours : 
Serious Adverse Events requiring reporting within 24 hours (as described in Table D -2) must 
also be reported to the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) Chair via an email to [EMAIL_259] within one business day.  A 24 hr. initial “SAE Details” Report, generated in the UWCCC database, must be attached to the email along with any pertinent information available at the time of initial reporting. The DSMC Chair will review the information and determine if immediate action is required. Within [ADDRESS_153206] be submitted electronically along with a 24 hour follow-up “SAE Details” Report and a completed UWCCC SAE Routing Form to [EMAIL_259]. All information is entered and tracked in the UWCCC database. 
If the SAE occurs on a multiple- institutional clinical trial c oordinated by [CONTACT_135262], the 
Outreach Coordinator will ensure that all participating sites are notified of the event and resulting 
action within one working day of the determination. 
See Section D for detailed instructions on SAE reporting. 
 
B.2. Serious Advers e Event  – Reported within 10 Days 
Serious Adverse Events requiring reporting within 10 working days (as described Table D -2l) 
will also be sent to the UWCCC DSMC Chair via email to [EMAIL_259]. A 10 
day “SAE Details” report, generated in the UWCCC database must be attached to the email along with pertinent information regarding the SAE and the UWCCC SAE Routing Form. The Committee Chair will review the information and determine if further action is required.  This information is entered an d tracked in the UWCCC database.  
If the SAE occurs on a multiple- institutional clinical trial coordinated by [CONTACT_135262], the 
Outreach Coordinator will ensure that all participating sites are notified of the event and resulting action within one working day of the determination.

See Section D for detailed instructions on SAE reporting. 
 
C. Study Progress Review  
Protocol Summary Reports (PSR) are required to be submitted to the DSMC commensurate with 
the Phase of the study. The PSR provides a cumulative report of serious adverse events, as well as any protocol violations, deviations or unanticipated problems, toxicities and responses that have occurred on the protocol in the timeframe specified. PSRs are reviewed at each DSMC meeting.  
 Protocol Summary Reports enable DSMC committee members to assess whether significant benefits or risks are occurring that would warrant study closure. This information is also provided by [CONTACT_135263], internal audit and/or response review reports.  In addition, the DSMC requires the DOWG or Local Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_135205]- related information.  
 In the event that there is significant risk warranting study suspension or closure, the DSMC will notify the Local PI [INVESTIGATOR_135206].  The DSMC ensures that the Local  PI [INVESTIGATOR_135207] a clinical trial to the sponsor (e.g., NCI Program Director, Industry Supporter(s), Cooperative Group Study Chair, etc.) and ot her appropriate agencies.  
 
D. Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events 
 
Depending on the nature, severity, and attribution of the serious adverse event an SAE report will be phoned in, submitted in writing, or both according to Table D-[ADDRESS_153207] also be reported to the UW IRB (if applicable), and any 
sponsor/funding agency not already included in the li st.

FDA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (21 CFR Part 312)  
NOTE:   Investigators MUST  immediately report to the study PI  [INVESTIGATOR_135208], whether or not they 
are considered related to the investigational agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 312.64)  
 An adverse event is considered serious if it results in ANY  of the following outcomes:   
1) Death  
2) A life -threatening adverse event  
3) An adverse event that results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1328] ≥ 24

NOTE:  FOR THIS STUDY, GRADE [ADDRESS_153209] would 
be immediate toxicity due to the vaccination itself, and a second would be due to immunological 
 
 9-3/2015 Version  50  
  
consequences of the vaccination targeting other unrelated tissues.  An intradermal route of 
administration will be used, and is preferred given the presence of Langerhans’ antigen-presenting cells in the dermis.  Intradermal administrations, however, carry a risk of immediate allergic reactions.  For that reason, subjects will be monitored for [ADDRESS_153210] to eliciting unwanted immunological reactions, PAP, a protein whose expression is essentially restricted to the prostate, does share homology with other tissue phosphatases, notably lysosomal acid phosphatase (LAP), most prevalent in pancreatic tissue.  No such toxicity has been reported in clinical trials targeting PAP by [CONTACT_3553] a dendritic cell vaccine, and the generation of PAP -specific CTL in rat models similarly did not elicit detectable evidence of 
autoimmune disease in non- prostate tis sues.  Moreover, this was not seen in a previous phase I 
clinical trial with this DNA vaccine.  However, in order to further evaluate this potential toxicity in humans, subjects will be evaluated at each visit by a review of systems based on the NCI common toxicity criteria.  In addition, subjects will be examined and serum chemistries, 
including renal function tests, blood counts, liver function tests, and serum amylase, will be evaluated at [ADDRESS_153211] suggested the possibility of this occurring is less than the spontaneous mutation rate, and therefore not a real risk [65].  Even should this occur, there is little reason to suspect that this 
would put subjects at any increased risk, and in this patient population with tre ated prostate 
cancer, there is little risk of transfer to offspring.  There are no known risks to blood donation during or after immunization, however subjects will be requested to not donate blood from study entry until completion of all study procedures.  The DNA itself is not hazardous (in that it encodes no viral proteins, is not radioactive, and is not itself a carcinogen) and does not pose additional risk to subjects or study personnel.  However, standard precautions to reduce the risk of needle sticks to study personnel will be performed.  
A.2. From intradermal treatment with rhGM -CSF 
 GM-CSF, administered intradermally with the vaccine, is being used as a vaccine adjuvant, and 
has demonstrated safety from multiple other vaccine trials in humans.  Common s ide effects 
include erythema and induration at the site of immunization (lasting for several days), and a 
transient decrease in peripheral white blood cell counts (lasting for several hours), mild flu- like 
symptoms (lasting for several hours).  It has also been observed and reported that T -cell and 
antibody responses can occur to GM -CSF, but without any known clinical sequelae [47].  
Uncommon and rare side effects, which have been less frequently observed with daily 
 
 9-3/2015 Version  51  
  
administration of higher doses of GM -CSF, include: vomiting; diarrhea; fatigue; weakness; 
headache; decreased appetite; feeling of faintness; facial flushin g; pain in the bones, muscles, 
chest, abdomen, or joints; blood clots or unusual bleeding symptoms; rapid or irregular heartbeat 
or other heart problems; kidney and liver dysfunction; fluid accumulation or worsening of pre -
existing fluid accumulation in ar ms and legs, in the lungs, and around the heart that may result in 
breathing problems and heart failure; allergic reactions; sloughing of skin; liver enlargement; Guillain -Barré syndrome; hypotension; loss of consciousness; dyspnea.  In a previous phase I 
trial with this DNA vaccine and GM -CSF, two patients experienced chest and back pain, 
attributed to the GM -CSF, which lasted less than 10 minutes and occurred within one hour of 
receiving GM -CSF.  For this reason, all subjects will be monitored for one hour after receiving 
each DNA immunization treatment.  
 
A.3. From blood tests 
 Drawing blood may cause temporary discomfort and bruising at the site of venipuncture.  Skin infections, while possible, are extremely rare as a result of blood draws  
A.4. From leukapheresis  
 Adverse events from leukapheresis  are uncommon.  Bruising at the site of venipuncture for 
venous access is possible, as is a rare risk of infection related to this venipuncture.  Anticoagulants (ACD) are used during cell collection, but these have not be en associated with 
subsequent bleeding problems.  There is a rare risk for citrate toxicity as a result of the citrate anticoagulation used during cell collection.  This can cause hypocalcaemia and muscle spasms.  There is no associated increased risk of i nfection from removing white blood cells, however a 
mild anemia can result for 1-[ADDRESS_153212] be measured within 1 
week of each leukapheresis; an hematocrit < 30% and/or platelet count <50,[ADDRESS_153213], well tolerated 
immunization, rare potential side effects of this vaccine could include: difficulty in breathing or 
swallowing; hives; swelling of the eyes, face or inside of the nose; confusion; convulsions; headaches; sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]; lymphadenopathy; and vomiting.  Other mild adverse effects not requiring 
medical attention include: chills; fever; mild irritability or tiredness; skin rash; or pain, tenderness, redness, itching or swelling at the site of injection.  
A.6. From sipuleucel-T 
 Sipuleucel -T has been g iven to over [ADDRESS_153214] trial that led to its approval, the primary adverse events 
experienced by [CONTACT_135264] -T more commonly than placebo included fever, 
chills, nausea, emesis, headache, dizziness, pain, myalgias, hypertension, sweating, and 
influenza- like symptoms, all typi[INVESTIGATOR_135209] (1 -2 day) duration.  Given that sipuleucel -T will 
 
 9-3/[ADDRESS_153215] benefit is guaranteed, the results from this trial will guide the direction of future vaccine trials targeting PAP or potentially other antigens for the treatment of prostate cancer.  Thus, it is hoped that future patients will benefit from research participation in the current study. 
  
16. Study Data Management and Procedural Issues  
 
A. Study Enrollment Procedures – Recruitment and Informed Consent Process: 
 
Potentially eligible subjects at the UWCCC site will be patients regularly followed or referred to the University of Wisconsin Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15166], and seen in the Medical Oncology, Urology, or Radiation Oncology outpatient clinics at the University of Wisconsin.  No specific advertisement or recruiting tools will be used.  Subjects will be identified by [CONTACT_15280], surgical, or medical oncologist, and informed about this study, alternatives to this study, and the possible risks and benefits.  Potentially eligible subjects will be informed that their 
decision to participate or not participate will in no way affect their ongoing medical care.  Subjects who are interested at that point in obtaining more information will then be introduced to one of the GU research nurses (Jane Straus RN, Dottie Horvath RN, Mulusew Yayehyirad, RN 
or Mary Jane Staab RN) who will then present the study (review rationale, describe time 
commitment, discuss again possible risks and benefits, and answer procedural  questi ons) to the 
subject and provide them with a consent form.  In order to allow research subjects time to review the consent form thoroughly with their family and referring or primary physician, the subject will be instructed to take the consent form home without signing.  If the patient wishes to proceed with enrollment, they are then asked to contact [CONTACT_15281] (608) 263- 7107.  To avoid 
the possibility of unintended coercion, incarcerated subjects and subjects unable to provide their own informed consent will not be considered eligible.  In addition, the research staff will call the 
patient to further discuss the study and its requirements.  Any questions the subject has will be addressed by [CONTACT_135265], and the time commit ment and alternatives to 
treatment will again be reviewed.  If the subject agrees to participate in the study, they will be instructed to return to clinic to meet with the research staff and to sign and date the consent form. Our research staff will sign a nd date the consent form as the person obtaining consent.  No 
screening procedures done solely for purposes of the study will be obtained prior to the subject signing the consent form.  Assignment to treatment arm will be based on the randomization list wh ich will be generated by 
[CONTACT_15282].  
 
 9-3/2015 Version  53  
  
 
B. Data Collection Procedures  
 
Electronic case report forms (e- CRFs) will be submitted to the UWCCC GU Oncology Office via 
UWCCC’s On -line Clinical Oncology Research Environment (ONCORE). Completion of the  e-
CRFs will be done in accordance with the instructions provided by [CONTACT_15283] a study- specific data capture plan.  The e- CRFs are found in the study specific calendar that has 
been created in ONCORE.  The system will prompt the user to the forms that are required based upon the patient’s enrollment and treatment dates.  The Local  Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_135210] e -CRFs accurately and within [ADDRESS_153216]. McNeel and stored a minimum of 7 years.   
 Adverse events, clinical responses, and issues related to disease progression are reviewed each week by [CONTACT_15284] (DOWG), attended by [CONTACT_6283]. McNeel, Liu, Kyriakopoulos , Bruce, Lang and Wilding, GU 
malignancy research nurses, data coordinators, and the GU malignancy program manager.  Minutes from these meetings are recorded, and bi -annual reports from this group are submitted 
to and reviewed by [CONTACT_135266].  All clinical safety, 
immunological response, and clinical response data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_4305], [CONTACT_135269], with the University of Wisconsin Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics.  
 All subject research charts will be maintained at individual treatment sites for a minimum of seven years after study completion.  All clinical information maintained in the UWCCC clinical trials database will be stored indefinitely.  All research samples and data derived fr om these 
specimens will be maintained indefinitely in the laboratory of Dr. McNeel.  All information with patient identifiers or medical history information will be kept in locked cabinets or secured databases available only to the study personnel to maint ain patient confidentiality.   
 
C. Description of Procedures to Maintain Confidentiality of Research Specimens 
 
All specimens obtained for the immunological evaluation of this trial (blood specimens) will be 
delivered to the laboratory of Dr. McNeel .  Specimens received by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. McNeel’s lab will only be 
handled by [CONTACT_15287] -
mandated blood- borne pathogen safety training.  Receipt of specimens will be entered into a 
database that will provide a unique code for each specimen.  All stored specimens (sera, 
 
 9-3/2015 Version  54  
  
peripheral blood mononuclear cells) will be labeled with this unique code and the date of 
preparation.  Thus, all patient identifiers will be removed from the final stored samples, and any data generated will contain only the unique code as identifier.  A database will be maintained to 
link individual coded specimens with an individual subject (name, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15168], date/time point) in order to be able to compare information from samples obtained at 
different time points from a specific individual, and ultimately for transfer of research data to the clinical trials database.  This research database will only be available to the study investigators, not other laboratory personnel, t o maintain confidentiality.  Subject sera will be maintained 
indefinitely in the laboratory of the study principal investigator, stored in aliquots at –20°C to –
80°C.  Peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be stored indefinitely in the laboratory of the study principal investigator, stored in aliquots in liquid nitrogen.  
D. Modifications of Protocol and Deviations from Protocol 
 
Any changes to the preceding protocol after approval by [CONTACT_135267] a description of specific changes.  All changes 
must be approved by [CONTACT_4881].  If these changes were related to possible adverse events that could potentially affect subject safety, the consent form will also be modified, and submitted with the protocol to the IRB.  After approval, all enrolled subjects will be asked to review and sign the new consent form to proceed with treatment.  If these changes were related to a severe adverse event, or could affect the scientific integri ty of the study, the 
events would also be reviewed internally by [CONTACT_6802], as described above, and the study could be placed on hold pending a protocol and consent form amendment, as described above, or study closure.  In addition, any information that mig ht affect the immediate safety of currently enrolled 
subjects will be communicated with them directly as well.  
  
Deviations from the study protocol, for reasons other than patient safety, are not permitted.  Any 
possible deviations, intended or not, will be documented in the subjects’ research chart.  Deviations that are unlikely to affect subject safety, such as missing a specific study lab draw, will be documented in the research chart and discussed with the study PI.  Deviations that could potentially af fect subject safety, such as missing safety labs, will be documented, repeated as 
soon as possible, and reviewed at the weekly GU clinical research (DOWG) meetings, with prompt reporting as soon as any deviation is identified to the IRB if there are concerns for patient safety or scientific integrity of the study.     
 
E. Withdrawal from Study Protocol 
 
Subjects are informed during the consenting process, and in the consent form, that their 
participation is voluntary and they may withdraw consent at any time a nd for any reason.  If 
subjects wish to withdraw from the study, they will be asked, but not required, to perform the off-study procedures/blood draws.  They will be again informed that their decision to participate 
or not participate at any time will not affect their routine medical care or any other benefits to 
which they were otherwise entitled.  In addition, subjects will be removed from study 
participation if there is a concern for patient safety, as described above, if they are unable to 
comply with study procedures, or if the study is terminated by [CONTACT_15290].

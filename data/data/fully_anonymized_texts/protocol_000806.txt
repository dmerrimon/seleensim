Funding Source: VA Health Services Research and Development  
Principal Investigator /Study Chair : Sarah Hawley  
June [ADDRESS_637202]  
Provide a summary of the study ( less than 500 words).  
Background:  Although there are over 200,[ADDRESS_637203] significant side 
effects from treatment (surgery or radiation therapy) that often persist for years, including incontinence, 
erectile dysfunction, and metabolic syndrome, all of which can contribute to decrease d quality of life. 
Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_495673]. This is particularly unfortunate since many of these 
symptoms can be effectively self -managed. Furthermore, there is no program in the VA for assessing 
ongoing symptom burden in survivors and directing them to receive appropriate primary or specialty 
care if needed.  
 
Objectives:  To address the need to improve patient -centered survivorship ca re management for 
Veterans with prostate cancer, we propose a 4 year study with two aims: 1) to conduct a randomized 
controlled trial to compare a personally tailored automated telephone symptom management 
intervention for improving symptoms and symptom se lf-management to usual care. We expect that 
those in the intervention group will have more confidence in symptom self -management and better 
symptom self -management and prostate cancer quality of life following the intervention, and that these 
outcomes will  translate to more efficient use of services for these Veterans, and 2) to compare 
utilization of services among those in the intervention group to those in the control group.  
 
Methods:  We will conduct a RCT of prostate cancer survivors at 4 VHA sites (An n Arbor, Cleveland, 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_495674]. Louis) who are [ADDRESS_637204] -treatment. Those with clinically  meaningful symptom 
burden identified using an established measure of prostate cancer  symptom burden will be invited to 
the study, verbally consented and randomized to the automated  telephone system or enhanced usual 
care (information about self -management). We will  evaluate the impact of the intervention on 
confidence in symptom self -management as well as actual symptom burden and prostate cancer 
quality o f life 5- and [ADDRESS_637205]/CPRS data sources. Finally, we will conduct a small 
process evaluation that will help us to better understand which elem ents of the intervention were 
effective, and will work with our primary care partners to make a recommendation for a broader 
deployment of an automated symptom self -management program in the VHA.  
 
Our study will provide much needed information about how to  optimize the quality of care and quality of 
life of Veterans who are survivors of prostate cancer. The randomized trial will evaluate innovative 
information  for assessing and improving symptom burden and self -management of prostate -related 
symptom burden in these survivors. We will further understand how symptom burden is associated with 
use of appropriate services in the VHA. Finally, we will work with our primary care partners to inform 
how to improve survivorship care for this large and growing populati on of Veterans.

2.0 Introduction  
• Provide  scientific background and rational e for study.   
Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in Veterans. Over 12,000 Veterans will be diagnosed 
with prostate cancer in 2012 to join more than 200,000  current prostate cancer (PC) survivors, making these 
patients one of the largest populations in the Veterans Administr ation Healthcare System (VA). Data from 
numerous studies in the general population and our own pi[INVESTIGATOR_495677], and that these symptoms contribute to poo r 
disease specific, and overall, QOL. Our study is based on a conceptual framework for describing how self -
management can work to improve outcomes for cancer survivors, including both proximal outcomes (reducing 
symptom burden and improving disease specifi c QOL) as well as longer term outcomes (subjective health and 
cancer outlook). Veterans in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_495678], and many of them successfully used a prototype automated telephone system in an effort to do so. 
Improving these outcomes is likely to translate into better Veteran -centered care for survivors of prostate cancer, 
one of the largest patient groups within the VA.  
• Include summary of gaps in current knowledge, relevant data,  and how the study 
will add to existing knowledge .   
Although there are over 200,[ADDRESS_637224] significant side effects from treatment (surgery or radiation therapy) that 
often persist for years, including incontinence, erectile dysfunction, and metabolic syndrome, all of which can 
contribute to decreased quality of life. Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_495679]. This is particularly unfortunate 
since many of these symptoms can be effectiv ely self -managed. Furthermore, there is no program in the VA for 
assessing ongoing symptom burden in survivors and directing them to receive appropriate primary or specialty 
care if needed.  
To address the need to improve patient -centered survivorship care  management for Veterans with prostate 
cancer, we propose a 4 year study with two aims: 1) to conduct a randomized controlled trial to compare a 
personally tailored automated telephone symptom management intervention for improving symptoms and 
symptom self -management to usual care. We expect that those in the intervention group will have more 
confidence in symptom self -management and better symptom self -management and prostate cancer quality of life 
following the intervention, and that these outcomes will t ranslate to more efficient use of services for these 
Veterans, and 2) to compare utilization of services among those in the intervention group to those in the control 
group.  
 
Our study will provide much needed information about how to optimize the quality  of care and quality of life of 
Veterans who are survivors of prostate cancer. The randomized trial w ill evaluate innovative information for 
assessing and improving symptom burden and self -management of prostate -related symptom burden in these 
survivors. W e will further understand how symptom burden is associated with use of appropriate services in the 
VHA. Finally, we will work with our primary care partners to inform how to improve survivorship care for this large 
and growing population of Veterans.

 • Inclu de rationale for including or excluding certain populations – in particular 
vulnerable populations.  
Veteran participants:  Women are excluded as this is a condition found only in men.  
3.0 Objectives  
• Describe the study’s purpose, specific aims, or objectives.  
The specific aims are:  
 
1) To conduct a randomized controlled trial among PC survivors with high symptom burden comparing the impact 
of this personalized intervention for improving symptoms and symptom self -management to nonpersonalized 
information. We hypo thesize that relative to controls, 5- and [ADDRESS_637225] -enrollment, Veterans in the 
intervention group will: 1) have higher confidence about symptom self -management; and 2) report lower symptom 
burden and better disease -specific QOL. We further hypothesi ze that at the [ADDRESS_637226] higher scores on two key psychosocial indicators (subjective health and perceived 
cancer control) than the control group.  
 
2) To determine the intervention’s impact on the use of p rimary and specialty VA services. We hypothesize that 
relative to controls, [ADDRESS_637227] the support of the Office of Specialty Care/Patient Care Services as well as the VA Ann Arbor 
PACT  (Patient Aligned Care Team)  Laboratory. To ensure that the trial has the greatest possible impact on VA 
care, we wi ll conduct a process evaluation to determine how the intervention can best optimize the quality of life 
and survivorship care for Veterans with prostate cancer and inform program implementation with our primary care 
partners.  
• State the hypotheses to be tes ted. 
We hypothesize that relative to controls, 5- and [ADDRESS_637228] -enrollment, Veterans in the intervention group 
will: 1) have higher confidence about symptom self -management; and 2) report lower symptom burden and better 
disease -specific QOL. We furth er hypothesize that at the [ADDRESS_637229] higher scores on two key psychosocial indicators (subjective health and perceived cancer control) than the 
control group.  
4.0 Resources and Perso nnel 
• Include where and by w hom the research will be conducted.  
This study will be conducted by [CONTACT_495701]: the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System (VAAAHS), 
the VA Pi[INVESTIGATOR_108710] (VAPHS) and the St. Louis VA Medical Center (SLVAMS). The coordinating 
site will be the VAAAHS, where the PI [INVESTIGATOR_495680]. Each site has experience in the 
conduct of research, and sufficient numbers of PC survivors from which to identify participants for both phases of 
our study. VAPHS and SLVAMS sites each offer significant numbers of potentially eligible survivors who are 
racial/ethnic minority Veterans, especially African Americans who have a higher rate of PC. The coordinators from 
these three sites will also recruit patients from an additional  site, the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center 
(LSCVAMC) (this site will not have an assigned LSI or local coordinator).

 5.0 Study Procedures  
5.1 Study Design  
 
• Describe experimental design of the study .  Include sequential  and/or  parallel 
phases o f the study , including durations, and explain which interventions are 
standard of care .   
 
Through a randomized controlled trial, we propose to evaluate the effectiveness of a personally tailored, 
automated prostate cancer (PC) symptom self -management inte rvention, compared to enhanced usual care. 
Participants randomized to the intervention arm will receive automated telephone monitoring and personally 
tailored newsletters. Participants randomized to the control condition will receive standard care plus information 
about symptom self -management at the time of enrollment. Participants in both arms will also be asked to 
complete surveys by [CONTACT_648].  
There are three primary Veteran -reported trial outcomes which will be measured at 5- and [ADDRESS_637236] 
enrollment : 1) confidence in symptom self -management, 2) implementation of symptom self -management, and 3) 
symptom burden and PC -QOL.  Self-efficacy in patient -physician interactions will also be assessed at baseline , 5-
months  and 12 -months.  Participants in the trial  will be randomized by [CONTACT_495708] (VAAAHS)  study staff . We hypothesize better outcomes in the intervention arm relative to enhanced 
usual care. The impact of the intervention on two secondary psychosocial outcomes, overall s ubjective health and 
perceptions of cancer control, will be assessed only at the [ADDRESS_637237] on these outcomes. The trial will be conducted in four VA sites (Ann Arbor, 
Clevela nd, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], and St. Louis) with a large and racial/ethnically diverse population of PC survivors between 
1-[ADDRESS_637238] -treatment. The intervention is based on a conceptual framework that describes how self -
management contributes to positive outcomes for cancer patients and survivors; we also will utilize theoretical 
constructs from patient empowerment and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to inform the content of our 
intervention. We will compare the quality of health care received in intervention an d control subjects using 
guidelines for prostate cancer survivorship care developed by [CONTACT_495709] a benchmark.  
Finally, we will prepare for implementation of the intervention on a broader scale through a formative evaluation. 
This d esign will allow us to understand how the intervention can best optimize the quality of life and quality of care 
for Veterans with PC, and will inform how to implement the program more broadly with our primary care partners.  
• Include a description of how an ticipated risk will be minimized and include an 
analysis of risk vs. potential benefit.  
How anticipated risk will be minimized:  
Veteran participants:  
Psychological:  The introductory letter and screening process aren’t done by a caregiver, reducing the risk  of 
coercion. Additionally, an opt -out telephone number is provided, and those who do not opt -out will be told they are 
under no obligation to participate, and their care will not be affected by [CONTACT_495710], at the begi nning of the screening call. (We have chosen an opt -out recruitment procedure as this type 
of strategy is approved by [CONTACT_495711][INVESTIGATOR_495683]. In a 
previous 2 -site randomized controlled trial aimed at in creasing colorectal cancer screening led by [CONTACT_093], 
the opt -out strategy translated into significantly higher rates of enrollment. Recruitment occurred within the 
primary care clinic at two VA medical centers from February 2009 to June 2011. At S ite 1, an opt -in strategy was 
initially adopted. After nine months, recruitment was modified to an opt -out approach. At Site 2, an opt -out 
strategy was utilized throughout. At Site 1, during the opt -in period, 756 mailings were sent of which 32 
subsequentl y enrolled into the study (4.2%), compared to 106 of 934 potentially eligible subjects during the opt -
out period (11.1%, P <0.001). The enrollment rate at Site 2 (opt -out throughout) was 15% (339/2210). Without 
modifying Site 1’s strategy to an opt -out pro cedure, the study was in danger of not meeting recruitment goals. 
Hence, we feel the use of opt -out recruitment procedures should be permitted for studies involving minimal risk. )   
 
Participants will be instructed they are free to skip any survey question s administered by [CONTACT_495712]. However, questions administered by [CONTACT_495713] 
v. 6.14.17 VA Central IRB Protocol Template  Page 13 of 30 
 optional.  Participants will be told that they may withdraw from the study at any time without penalty. Consistent  
with the literature and our team’s previous experience providing decision aids to study participants undergoing 
cancer screening, Veterans tend to respond positively to research that seeks to improve the quality of care via 
educational materials by [CONTACT_495714]. However, if a potential study participant 
verbalizes the need for support or wants further clarification of any issue during the screening call , a study 
investigator will address the concern in a sensitive and profe ssional manner (i.e., by [CONTACT_495715]/or recommending follow up with his primary care provider).  
 
Social/legal:  we believe that risk of a breach of confidentiality is low. Throughout the study, IRB and HIPPA 
guidelines will be foll owed to ensure the privacy and integrity of the information we collect. Any breach will be 
immediately reported to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_495684]. In addition, any complaints/concerns expressed to the 
study staff by [CONTACT_4317], providers, or anyone else  affected by [CONTACT_171257] 
[INVESTIGATOR_32397], as will any unexpected events. To minimize the risk of a breach of confidentiality, we will perform the 
following steps. First, as soon as the cohort is defined by [CONTACT_58047], ea ch patient in the cohort will be 
assigned a unique study ID. We will then create an electronic tracking file on an access -restricted secure drive  
behind the VA firewall  that maps the study participant’s identifying information to the study ID. No identifyi ng 
information will be placed on data collection forms (e.g. surveys). Identifiers of potential recruits and study 
participants will be maintained to allow for follow -up contacts during the data collection phase. These will be kept 
in study folders accessi ble only by [CONTACT_495716] 
10-1 (RCS 10 -1) once direction for destruction of research records is published by [CONTACT_91719]. Electronic data will be 
maintained in access -restricted study folders on a secur e VA server behind the VA  firewall maintained by [CONTACT_495717]. All identifiable data will be kept behind the firewall, with access only available to key 
study team members. The data manager will be responsible for creating analytic dat asets for statisticians and 
investigators; these datasets will be de -identified per HIPAA guidelines. All resulting research data will be 
presented in aggregate only. Furthermore, study staff sign a pledge of confidentiality and understand that breach 
of confidentiality is grounds for dismissal. Study staff are required to complete annual training on privacy and 
HIPPA, as well as biannual training on human subjects protection.  
 
In order to receive the IVR calls, participants must be willing to have study s taff enter their name, address, 
telephone number, age, ethnicity, marital/relationship status, prostate cancer treatment type, initial diagnosis date, 
service branch VA Site, and PEPPI [INVESTIGATOR_495685] a secure, password -protected website hosted by [CONTACT_495718]. The CHCR team at the University of Michigan will have access to this information; 
however, we are in the process of obtaining revised data use agreement s. CHCR has extensive expertise in the 
protection of personal information and fo llows strict data security protocols. Also, all CHCR staff assigned to work 
on this project have completed the WOC process mandatory training including VA Privacy and Information 
Security Awareness and Rules of Behavior and Privacy and HIPAA Training.  
 
The website used to transfer data to CHCR will be protected by a Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol , 
ensuring that all data transmissions between a user’s browser and the web server are encrypted and are 
therefore secure.  The Transport Layer Security (T LS) protocol in use on the website supports both 128 -bit and 
256-bit encryption, depending on the user’s browser. In addition, FIPS [ADDRESS_637239] be stored in an encrypted partition on the Requestor’s or its 
contractors/subcontractors information system hard drive using FIPS 140 -2 validated software .   (See 
http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/ validation.html for a complete list of validated cryptographic modules).  The 
application must be capable of key recovery and a copy of the encryption key(s) must be stored in multiple secure 
locations.  FIPS 140 -2 (or current version) compliant / NIST val idated encryption will be used to secure VHA data 
stored on any portable drives, IT components, disks, CD’s / DVD’s.  
 
Data at CHCR will be stored on web servers running in a virtual server environment. MiServer is a U -M-hosted 
service maintained on the An n Arbor campus. MiServer includes safeguards required by [CONTACT_2373]. These 
datacenters provide protection from lengthy outages, 24/[ADDRESS_637240] protected. The server runs Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 -based operating 
system and security patches and updates are downloaded and installed automatically. The following FIPS 
validated software will be used:  
#1933 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 dm -crypt Cryptographic Module  
#1901 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 Kernel Crypto API [INVESTIGATOR_495686]

All study data will be stored in a password -protected M ySQL database residing on an encrypted volume using the 
FIPS validated dm -crypt software. Access to the database is restricted to the server. No external access is 
available. Access to servers by [CONTACT_495719] a password -protected, TLS -encry pted web console 
using the FIPS validated OpenSSL software, available at https://pcare.miserver.it.umich.edu/. Access to the web 
console is logged for auditing purposes. Modification to participant records are also logged. Study data can only 
be downloaded  from the web console by [CONTACT_32938].  
 
Each server is also protected by [CONTACT_495720]. Workstation computers with 
server access are configured to require passwords (which adhere to the University of Michigan’s Password Policy) 
in order to log in, wake from sleep, or unlock screen savers.  
 
Data from the CHCR server will be downloaded directly to the access -restricted study folder on the secure VA 
server behind the VA firewall  by [CONTACT_3647]. To access and down load the data from the CHCR server, 
research staff will be required to log in with a username [CONTACT_2383]. Data provided to CCMR researchers 
through the CHCR server will be in coded form, labeled only with a study ID, and with all personally identifying 
information removed.  
 
 
 
VA employees:   
We plan to interview up to 40  key stakeholders ( up to [ADDRESS_637241] s at each site , plus interviews of 
stakeholders at the VISN and national level ), recruited and interviewed by [CONTACT_495721]. By [CONTACT_7661] A nn 
Arbor study staff recruit the employees, this will reduce the risk of coercion, as in no instance will the recruiting be 
done by a supervisor of the participants. This will also reduce the risk of a breach of confidentiality. The same 
precautions for pr otecting the audio files and transcripts of Veteran participants will be used for protecting these 
data from VA employees. Data will be stored in an access -restricted study folder  so that minimal Ann Arbor study 
staff members will have access.  
 
Veteran par ticipants and VA employees:   
If a study participant (or potential study participant) is upset regarding a survey question, verbalizes the need for 
support or wants further clarification of any issue during any study calls with staff, a study investigator w ill address 
their concern in a sensitive and professional manner. Any complaints/concerns expressed to the study staff by 
[CONTACT_4317], providers, or anyone else affected by [CONTACT_171257] [INVESTIGATOR_32397], as 
will any unexpected events. Throughout the study, any breach of IRB or HIPPA guidelines will be immediately 
reported to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_495687] s. 
 
Transcription : 
Interviews of participants and employees will be transcribed. In the event our in -house transcriptionist is  unable to 
provide timely turnaround on transcription requests, we will utilize the Centralized Transcription Service Program 
(CTSP) out of the VA Salt Lake City (VASLC). Approved staff from the VASLC will transcribe the study’s audio 
files. The VASLC has a Centralized Transcription Service Program available to VA sites and monitored by [CONTACT_495722]. The study’s audio recordings to be transcribed by [CONTACT_74217]'s unique 
alphanumeric code and saved behind the VA Firewall in th e study’s secure project folder on an AAVA OI&T 
server. The VASLC transcription staff will be given access to a sub -folder within the study’s secure project folder. 
Approved study staff will place a copy of the audio files in this folder for an approved VA SLC transcriptionist to 
access for the purposes of transcription. The VASLC transcriptionist will transcribe each interview and save the 
completed transcript in the sub -folder using the same alphanumeric code. No data (audio files, in process 
transcripts, or completed transcripts) will leave the AAVA’s secure research server. As completed transcripts 
become available, approved study staff will move these files from the transcription sub -folder into another sub -
folder that is only accessible to study staff, where they will be stored and accessed for qualitative analyses.  
 
Risk vs. potential benefit:  
Veteran participants:  Although participants may not receive any direct benefit, the risks to participants are minimal 
and the benefits are great. We believe that those in the intervention (automated prostate cancer symptom 
management intervention) are likely to receive some benefit in their overall symptom burden as described in our 
v. 6.14.17 VA Central IRB Protocol Template  Page 15 of 30 
 Study Aim #[ADDRESS_637242] populat ions of Veterans using the 
VHA. The results from this study may benefit other cancer survivors experiencing symptoms, as this type of 
intervention may be easily translatable.  
 
VA employees:  Although participants may not receive any direct benefit, the risk s to participants are minimal and 
the benefits are great. Data from the process evaluation component of this study will be used to help the study 
team understand how to best implement and maintain a program to address symptom management in prostate 
cancer survivors. If effective, the potential benefits to the clinicians who care for these survivors is great, as we 
expect the program to translate into more efficient use of health services.  
 
• Provide description of the study population  (delineate all categorie s of subjects – 
patients, providers, family members , employees, etc.).  Include anticipated enrollment 
numbers  
Veteran participants:  
Participants will be selected from CDW who meet the following eligibility criteria:  
• Veteran patient at one of the four study  sites 
• History of treatment for prostate cancer treated by [CONTACT_44850], radiation or androgen deprivation therapy 
between 1 -10 years prior to identification  
• Has phone number on file and ability to converse on the telephone in English  
• No dementia or other signi ficant mental impairment  
 
A random sample of those identified will be asked to participate. Those who elect to participate, and who have a 
qualifying Brief Screener score ( [ADDRESS_637243] 1 symptom) will be randomized to the study. We estimate 
as m any as [ADDRESS_637244] a history of 
prostate cancer ; otherwise we expect t he health status of these veterans to be varied.  
 
VA employees:  
Up to 40  VA employees will be asked to participate in semi -structured  interviews. We plan to interview up to 40 
key stakeholders (up to 4 PCPs and 4 specialists at each site, plus interviews o f stakeholders at the VISN and 
national level),  recruited  and interviewed  by [CONTACT_495721]. Recruitment of these individuals is not based on 
any factor other than their position, so we expect males and females of employment age and with a health statu s 
good enough to carry out their job duties.  
• As applicable, provide information on any added protections for vulnerable 
populations.  
Veteran participants:  
This project requires no additional costs to patients and the $[ADDRESS_637245] incentive  is small enoug h so as to not be 
coercive to participants. In addition, patients are free to withdraw from the study at any time and are free to keep

5.2 Recruitment Methods  
• State how many subjects will be needed.  
Veteran participants:  
We estimate as many as 553 - 650 veterans will be randomized.  
 
VA employees:

stakeholders at the VISN and national level), recruited  and interviewed  by [CONTACT_495721].  
 
• Describe when, where, how  and by [CONTACT_495724].  
 
RCT:  
Recruitment and informed consent. We have been  granted a  waiver of documentation of informed consent and HIPAA 
Authorization. Potential participants will be sent an introductory letter and a patient information sheet.  The introductory 
letter will briefly describe the study and include a local or toll free number to call if the patient is not interested in 
participating or would like more information. After one week , a study coordinator will telephone those Veterans who 
did not opt -out, and if the patient is interested, the coordinator will ensure the p atient is properly informed, obtain 
verbal informed consent, administer the Brief Screener by [CONTACT_495725] a clinically meaningful symptom burden score ( 1 or higher  on any one symptom, as a measure o f 
low function or high symptom burden) on at least one item.  
 
For Veterans with significant symptoms, the coordinator will assess interest in participating in the trial, review the 
patient information sheet and answer any questions. The patient informatio n sheet will clearly state that being in the 
study means that some Veterans will be enrolled into a program of weekly automated telephone calls plus newsletters 
while the other group will receive only written information about PC symptom self -management at  one time -point. We 
will make clear that we are studying these methods for helpi[INVESTIGATOR_495688]. The patient information sheet will not state which of these is 
the “intervention” arm. It will further state that to be in the study requires that the Veteran’s name, address, telephone 
number, age, ethnicity, marital/relationship status, prostate cancer treatment type, initial diagnosis date, service 
branch VA Site  and survey scores  be entered into a secure website to a server that meets all VA criteria for 
confidential data transfer, but that this will be done by [CONTACT_495726]. Finally, 
the patient information sheet will inform th e participant that he is agreeing to a baseline survey and follow up phone 
call at 5- and [ADDRESS_637248] been 
answered, and the patient has verbally consented to participate, the study coordinator will then administer the 
baselin e survey over the telephone.  Once a participant has been enrolled into the study, AAVA staff will send a $[ADDRESS_637249]  or outdated , study staff will check 
the patient’ s medical record for current contact [CONTACT_3031]. In the event a letter is returned to us in the mail and an 
updated address is not available, study staff will attempt to contact [CONTACT_495727] 3 times including 
v. 6.14.17 VA Central IRB Protocol Template  Page 17 of 30 
 leaving messages. If the patient  is agreeable, study staff will send the recruitment letter to the patient’s updated 
address and contact [CONTACT_495728].  
 
Process Evaluation:  
At the end of the intervention delivery phas e, the research team will conduct semi -structured interviews with up to 40 
key stakeholders  (up to 4 PCPs and 4 specialists at each site, plus interviews of stakeholders at the VISN and 
national level ). Drs. Hawley and Skolarus will arrange interviews with  up to  4 PCPs at each site (with the support of 
the primary care service director) and [ADDRESS_637250] outcomes (i.e., had the highest reduction in symptom burden over the study period) and 
the worst outcomes (i.e., no change in symptom burden or increase in symptom burden). Starting in month [ADDRESS_637251] 
outcome group (N= 40 total), based on preliminary data analyses available at that time. We will conduct in -depth 
interviews with these participants by [CONTACT_495729]’s effectiveness. Participants in these interviews will be limited to patients who  agreed to this interview 
during the [ADDRESS_637252] during month 9 of year 3, and continue into months 1 -
2 of year 4. Telephone interviews are expected to take 30 -40 minutes and will be audiotaped  with the participan ts’ 
verbal consent.  
 
• Describe materials that will be used to recruit subjects, e.g., advertisements.  
Include materials as an appendix or separate attachment.  
Potential participants will be sent an introductory letter  and a patient information sheet. The l etter will describe the 
study and include  either  a toll -free or local  number to call if the patient is not interested in participating or would like 
more information.  
 
• Describe any payments to subjects, including the amount, timing (at the end of 
the study  or pro -rated for partial study participation), method (e.g., cash, check, gift 
card), and whether subjects will experience a delay in receiving the payment.  
Once a participant has been enrolled into the study, AAVA staff will send a $[ADDRESS_637253] by [CONTACT_2319].  Those patients 
participating in the evaluation process will receive an additional $[ADDRESS_637254] are minimal and made on a 
one-time basis. Payment for the ~ [ADDRESS_637255] staff once the interview has been completed.   
5.3 Informed Consent Procedures  
• Indicate if i nformed consent will be obtained  and/or if you are requesting a waiver 
of informed consent or waiver of documentation of informed consent.  If the 
research involves multiple phases, specify for which phases of the research  the 
waiver(s) is being requested and/or the informed consent will be sought.  
Describe who will be obtaining informed consent, if applicable, and any 
circumstances that may need to be addressed (e.g. subjects with impaired decision 
making ability and the use of a legally authorized represe ntative, etc.)  
We have obtained  a waiver of documentation of informed consent and HIPAA authorization for the entirety of the 
study.  Study staff will obtain verbal informed consent during the initial screening call (see patient recruitment script).  
General ly, the local coordinator will be responsible for recruitment of patients from her own site; however, we plan to 
add an additional coordinator at the coordinating center (VAAAHS)  who will be responsible for assisting with patient 
v. 6.14.[ADDRESS_637256].  
• If applicable, indicate how local site study personnel will be trained regarding 
human subje cts protections requirements and how to obtain and document informed 
consent.  
Study staff sign a pledge of confidentiality and understand that breach of confidentiality is grounds for dismissal. Study 
staff are required to complete annual training on priva cy and HIPPA, as well as biannual training on human subjects 
protection.  We have obtained  a waiver  of documentation  of informed consent and HIPAA authorization for the entirety 
of the study.  
 
5.4 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
• Describe the criteria that dete rmine who will be included in or excluded from  the study.  
Veteran participants:  
Participants will be selected from CDW who meet the following eligibility criteria:  
• Veteran patient at one of the four study sites  
• History of treatment for prostate cancer tre ated by [CONTACT_44850], radiation or androgen deprivation therapy 
between 1 -10 years prior to identification  
• Has phone number on file and ability to converse on the telephone in English  
• No dementia or other significant mental impairment  
 
A random sample of those identified will be asked to participate. Those who elect to participate, and who have a 
qualifying Brief Screener score ( [ADDRESS_637257] 1 symptom) will be randomized to the study. We estimate as 
many as 553 - 650 veterans will be randomized. All p articipants will be 40 -80 years old at the time of identification, 
and all will be male as this is a study of prostate cancer ; otherwise we expect the health status of these veterans to be 
varied.  
 
5.5 Study Evaluations  
• Describe all evaluations to be condu cted (including screening ; 
tests/questionnaires that will be administered; any procedures that subjects will be 
required to complete) and data collection methods .  Include materials as an 
appendix or separate attachment.  
 
Potential participants will be sen t an introductory packet from the AAVA. After one week, the coordinator will 
telephone those Veterans who did not op -out, and if the patient is interested, the coordinator will administer the Brief 
Screener by [CONTACT_495730] a clinically meaningful symptom 
burden score (1 or higher on any one symptom, as a measure of low function or high symptom burden) on at least 
one item. Once the Veteran has been deemed eligible and the baseline survey has been admi nistered, the veteran 
will be randomized to the automated telephone system or enhanced usual care (information about self -management).  
 
Veterans randomized to the automated telephone system intervention will receive 4 automated phone calls over a 3 -
month period: [ADDRESS_637258]  the option of listening to an audio testimonial tailored on priority symptom area.  Following each call, the veteran 
will receive a personalized newsletter that will provide more details regarding their symptoms and strategies to help 
them manage their symptoms.  Each newsletter will be 4 – 8 pages in length.  The automated system will try to reach 
the veteran up to eight times over the course of 4 days (see IVR call sch edule). If the veteran has not completed the 
call by [CONTACT_4475] [ADDRESS_637259] the patient (including leaving 
messages) to verify the phone number and preferred call time.  If the veteran has still not completed the call by [CONTACT_4475] [ADDRESS_637260] the option to initiate additional IVR calls should veteran be agree able. 
v. 6.14.17 VA Central IRB Protocol Template  Page 19 of 30 
  
Veterans rand omized to this group  may also be contact[CONTACT_45143] a 30 to 40 -minute audio -recorded phone 
interview to find out about their experience with the program.  These interviews will be conducted by [CONTACT_495731], M I.  During the 12 -month survey, veterans  will be asked if they are interested in 
participating in the interview.   
 
Veterans randomized to the control  group will receive one 4-page newsletter with educational information about 
symptoms and symptom manageme nt, and will complete a survey over the phone at enrollment and at 5 and 12 
months after starting the study.  
 
Telephone surveys of both intervention and control groups to obtain baseline and follow -up measures will be 
conducted at three time points : basel ine, five months, and [ADDRESS_637261] ete the survey by [CONTACT_756], a paper -and-pencil survey will be mailed to 
them with a return envelope.  Participants who fail to return the paper survey within one month  may be sent a se cond 
paper survey by [CONTACT_2319].  In addition, a reminder newsletter will be se nt to participants 1 -2 months prior to their expected 
12-month follow -up. All participants completing the 12 -month assessment will be sent an “early results” newsletter 
showing some preliminary survey results and thanking participants for their contributio n to the study.  
 
Patients are free to skip any survey questions administered by [CONTACT_495732]. 
However, because the newsletters are tailored based on responses to questions administered by [CONTACT_495733] , these questions  are not optional.  Nevertheless, p atients are free to hang up the phone if they 
prefer not to complete an IVR call.  Patients will also have the option to call into the IVR system using a toll free 
number if they prefer not to wait to complet e their call.  
 
We will use the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index (EPIC)  to assess PC -symptom burden and associated PC -QOL at 
the baseline, [ADDRESS_637262]. Wei, and has 
been widely used in prosta te cancer survivorship research. The EPIC is a 26 -item measure that assesses symptom 
burden in four domains: urinary symptoms (9 items),  bowel symptoms (6 items), sexual symptoms (6 items) and 
vitality (5 items). Each domain has a subscale related to funct ion and bother which together contribute to disease 
specific quality of life. Prior work by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Wei and colleagues has shown that these domains have good internal 
consistency (Chronbach’s alpha > 0.82 for each domain) and correlate highly with other establ ished measures of 
QOL.107 Each domain has a range of possible scores from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating worse symptom 
burden. Lower EPIC scores for any one domain are associated with lower function in that domain (e.g., lower sexual 
health functio n) and lower QOL. Thus higher symptom burden, which reflects both function and bother scores, 
translate into lower EPIC scores. Based on consultation with [CONTACT_411184] and on prior work by [CONTACT_293340], for purposes of 
this study we will consider a score of 70 or l ess to indicate “clinically meaningful symptom burden” for any one 
domain. We will conduct primary outcome analyses using the EPIC. Self-efficacy in patient -physician interactions will 
also be assessed both at baseline and 12 -months using a 5 -item short fo rm version of the Perceived Efficacy in 
Patient -Physician Interactions (PEPPI). The PEPPI [INVESTIGATOR_495689]' self -efficacy in 
obtaining medical information and attention to their medical concerns from physicians.  PEPPI [INVESTIGATOR_495690] (α=0.93).  
At the 12 -month assessment we will evaluate two key psychosocial domains of QOL (subjective health and 
perceptions of cancer control) that have been shown to be impacted by [CONTACT_495734]. We will assess 
subjective health using the VR-12, an established measure of overall QOL that includes perceptions of one’s health. 
We will assess perceived cancer control using a measure developed in prior research examining the psychosocial 
impact of prostate cancer; this measure includes three domains related to confidence that one’s cancer is under 
control, worries about recurrence, and appraisals of one’s copi[INVESTIGATOR_269590]. We will evaluate these 
v. 6.14.[ADDRESS_637263] 
on these psychosocial domains of QOL.  
 
The primary outcome for Specific Aim 2 will be use of VA services related to prostate  cancer survivorship care at the 
12 month assessment  point. We will use the 12 month assessment point to ensure we capture any medication or 
service use related to prostate cancer symptom management that may occur after patients’ exposure to the 
intervention has ended. Because there are no VA guidelines for  appropriate management of prostate cancer 
survivors, we also will operationalize symptom -specific utilization consistent with MCC guidelines which are expert 
and evidence based. In the absence of VA guidelines for prostate cancer survivorship care, we con sidered national, 
regional and specialty organization guidelines. While there exists considerable overlap in recommendations, we 
ultimately chose the Michigan Cancer Consortium (MCC) guidelines for prostate cancer survivorship care as a 
standard against wh ich to assess self -management approaches as well as use of services. We chose the MCC 
guidelines because they have good coverage of symptom management, the consortium is based in the same 
geographic area as our study sites, and because 2 study co -investiga tors contributed to their content (Skolarus, Wei). 
We will operationalize utilization consistent with these guidelines using criteria mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. This process has been used 
extensively to develop sets of quality metrics using a set of recommendations, when ev idence -based guidelines do 
not exist, as is the case with prostate cancer survivorship care. Specifically, for each symptom indicated by [CONTACT_495735], we will determine potentially appropriate use of services by [CONTACT_95559][INVESTIGATOR_495691] a t the 
12 month assessment to those outlined in the MCC recommendations. For analysis purposes, we will consider care 
recommended by [CONTACT_495736] “guideline -concordant” even though the MCC are not fully evidence based guidelines. 
Data will be derived from thr ee sources described in the Analytic Plan section below. For instance, if the patient 
indicates a problem with sexual function at baseline, we will measure use of pharmacologic treatments such as the 
phosphodiesterase inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil, var denafil) or prostaglandin E1 (alprostadil as injection or 
intraurethral pellet), use of medical devices such as a vacuum erection device, a visit to a urologist, or receipt of 
surgery such as a penile prosthesis. Pharmacological agents for managing problem s with urination include oxybutynin 
(Ditropan), tolterodine (Detrol) and phenazopyridine. Global measures for each symptom will indicate use of any of 
the pharmacologic, device, or referral measures suggested in the guideline. We also will create continuou s measures 
of guideline -concordance service use from zero (none of the non -self-management approaches used in the prior year) 
to the maximum number of options for that specific symptom. Switching from one pharmacologic approach to another 
will be counted a s separate approaches. The outcomes for Aim 2 (use of prostate cancer survivorship services 
consistent with those recommended by [CONTACT_174580]) will be obtained from two sources. We will collect pharmacy data, 
patient demographics, diagnoses, the date and type o f utilization events, location of services (study site as well as 
clinic type), and the patients' assigned primary care provider from the Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW). To obtain 
information about device utilization, such as a penile clamp for incontinenc e control, we will use both CDW and the 
National Patient Prosthetics Database (N[COMPANY_003]) from Patient Care Services. Having the CDW and the N[COMPANY_003] records 
will ensure we can collect the most accurate device utilization.  The process for requesting a data extract  from these 
sources will be initiated at the end of year 2, to ensure sufficient time to obtain appropriate approvals for these 
datasets to be accessed by [CONTACT_495737].  
 
We will collect information about participants’ use of primary an d specialty care from VA records in the [ADDRESS_637264] (urologist, oncologist, radiation oncologist, or 
gastroenterologist). For each visit, we will ask them to indicate whether the visit was related to their prostat e cancer 
symptom management. We will also use the datasets created through Aim 2 to assess patients’ use of primary and/or 
specialty care [ADDRESS_637265] enrollment.  
 
 5.6 Data Analysis  
• Provide sample size determination and analysis (include anticipated rat e of 
screen failures, study discontinuations, lost to follow -up etc.).  
In a recent EPIC study, the minimal clinically important difference for the four EPIC domains was defined as the 
difference in scores between patients who were completely satisfied with  their symptom burden (function and bother 
combined) versus only somewhat satisfied. Minimally important differences ranged from 0.[ADDRESS_637266] deviation (SD) 
to 0.[ADDRESS_637267] information at 12 
v. 6.14.17 VA Central IRB Protocol Template  Page 21 of 30 
 month with 90% power, we will need 394 participants (197 per group), based on using a regression analysis adjusting 
for baseline values (analysis o f covariance) with an α of 0.[ADDRESS_637268] the same difference with higher correlation than 0.5 between baseline and follow -up 
symptom values. Assuming conservatively 15% attrition at each assessment time, we prop ose to enroll [ADDRESS_637269] 0.33 SD differences between groups.  
• Describe how , where and by [CONTACT_495738] . 
All data will be analyzed at the Ann A rbor VA. The qualitative data analyst , Jordan Sparks,  the data manager, Jennifer 
Davis, and Drs. Hawley, Hofer and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_495692].  
 
Aim 1 initial analyses and data verification:  Analyses will be done in three phases. Baseline  analysis (data verification) 
will include examining the distribution of all study variables to assess extreme values, missing data, variances, 
skewness, and type of distribution. Descriptive statistics will be used to describe the distribution of baseline  variables 
in the two groups. We will use means, medians, and ranges for continuous variables such as age and baseline 
symptom scores, and we will use proportions for discrete variables. Baseline comparability of the two groups will be 
assessed using two -group t -tests for continuous variables, and chi -square tests for dichotomous or categorical 
variables. Variables found to be associated with the study groups will be included in subsequent analyses as 
covariates to adjust for potential differences between g roups, and the results will be interpreted with any baseline 
imbalances in mind. We also will evaluate bivariate associations between patients’ experimental condition and the 
outcomes, as well as between each covariate and the outcomes and between each cov ariate and group assignment. 
These analyses will be done to determine unadjusted measures of effect, assess possible confounders, and 
anticipate any collinearity in subsequent analyses. We will also report by [CONTACT_495739] 70 (i.e., “better symptom burden”) at both 5- and [ADDRESS_637270] graphical analysis to explore 
variation in outcome variables o ver time and between the two experimental groups. We will evaluate the trends in 
symptom burden, knowledge and information need over time in the two study groups separately. Results of these 
graphical analyses will be used to fine -tune the analytic course described below.  
 
Aim 1 outcome analyses:  Our primary outcomes for Aim [ADDRESS_637271] to the completion of the 
intervention. Multiple regression analysis will be used to evaluate the primary outcomes. The model will include an 
indicator for intervention group as the prim ary independent variable, and treatment type indicator (surgery vs. 
radiotherapy) and study site indicators as covariates. Baseline variables found to differ between the two study groups 
in the baseline analysis will also be included as covariates, though we expect the groups to be balanced on 
demographic and symptom scores by [CONTACT_260877]. The coefficient for the intervention group indicator 
will be used to evaluate the impact of the personalized automated prostate cancer symptom management pr ogram 
compared to standard information. For change in symptom burden, we will repeat the analysis using each of the four 
symptom domains for EPIC. We will use the same analytic approach to evaluate changes in confidence in symptom 
self-management, our seco nd Aim [ADDRESS_637272] better scores at both 5-and 12 -month assessments relative to those in the group (i.e., less 
symptom burden and better PC -QOL, more confidence in symptom s elf-management). For patients with available 
data at both 5- and [ADDRESS_637273] ( 5 versus 12 months) and an interaction of time by [CONTACT_495740] (at 5-months) vs. long (at 12 -months) after the intervention is discontinued. If 
the interaction is not significant, we will drop the interaction term from the model and estimate the time -averaged 
difference in outcomes between the two study groups. Analyses of other outcomes, such as self -management 
implementation and confidence, will b e done similarly.  
 
Aim 2 Analysis:  For Aim 2, we hypothesize that [ADDRESS_637274] higher rates of use for PC survivorship services that are 
consistent with the recommendations of the MCC than control patients. The primary outcome for Specific Aim 2 will be 
use of symptom -specific MCC guideline -concordant care assessed at 12 months. Using our global measure of use of 
any symptom -specific guideline concordant care (yes/no), we will evaluate differences across intervention conditions 
v. 6.14.[ADDRESS_637275] additional logistic analysis within subgroups of pat ients with various symptom patterns at baseline. For 
these models, the primary outcome will be use of guideline -concordant care for a specific symptom (yes/no). 
Secondary independent variables will include the EPIC baseline score. We will control for Veter an demographics 
(including age, race/ethnicity, education and income), study site, and type of treatment received (i.e., radiation versus 
chemotherapy). We will then explore the total amount of guideline concordant services received in regression models 
appropriate for skewed count data (e.g., poisson or negative binomial models).  
 
5.7 Withdrawal of Subjects  
• Describe any anticipated circumstances under which subjects will be withdrawn 
from the research without their consent.  
There are no anticipated circum stances under which subjects will be withdrawn without their consent.  
• Describe the consequences of a subject's decision to withdraw from the research 
and the procedures for orderly termination of participation by [CONTACT_423] (e.g., the 
subject contact[CONTACT_30697] t he investigator for an end -of-study visit).  
This is an RCT but as will be clear in the information letter, patients may choose to withdraw from the study at 
any time. If IVR calls are not answered, study staff will attempt to contact [CONTACT_1962] (up to 5 or 6  attempts  will 
be made, including leaving voice mails and providing call -back information for participants who are not home ) 
to determine whether they wish to continue participating. Participants who indicate they have changed their 
mind and no longer wish  to continue in the study will not be contact[CONTACT_49496].  
6.0 Reporting  
• Include procedures for reporting unanticipated problems, serious adverse events, 
and protocol deviations.  
Reports of related SAEs  and UAPs and protocol deviations will be made by [CONTACT_1758] t eam member who discovers 
the event, the site coordinator, or the project manager to the VA Central IRB (CIRB). The Ann Arbor project manager 
should be notified at the same time a report is made if the report is coming from another site’s study team member.  
Any unanticipated related incidents involving a death at any of the [ADDRESS_637276] manager as they are discovered, and will be reported to the 
CIRB in summary at the time of continuing re view/project closure. Protocol deviations/violations that are likely to 
substantially adversely affect 1) the rights, safety, or welfare of a participant; 2) a participant’s willingness to continue  
participation; or 3) the integrity of the research data, i ncluding VA information security requirements will all be reported 
within 5 working days of being made aware of the occurrence. These will be reported through the secure SharePoint 
site dedicated to this purpose.  
 
It is possible the automated system and fo llow-up surveys may uncover certain symptoms that warrant medical 
attention. The 2 possible symptoms that the automated system could uncover is blood in stools and/or urine, though 
the likelihood of either of these is low. If a study participant reports bl ood in stool and/or urine (or other concerning 
symptoms requiring the input of a physician), study staff will contact [CONTACT_495741]. For all 
participants verifying current or recent symptoms, we will enter a progress note in the pat ient’s medical chart with a 
description of the patient’s reported symptoms and a request for follow -up and add the appropriate provider(s) as 
additional signers on the note. This plan has been reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_495742].  In the event  a 
study participant  has no assigned provi der(s)  at the VA appropriate for follow up  of reported concerning symptoms , 
study staff will contact [CONTACT_495743] (or other ) provider of said 
symptoms. Shoul d the study participant express concerns  or request additional information , or in the event the 
participan t has no assigned community -based provider, the patient will be contact[CONTACT_426] a study MD.  In the event we 
v. 6.14.[ADDRESS_637277] no VA assigned provider, study staff will send a letter by [CONTACT_495744].   
Complaints from participants regarding VA medical care unrelated to the study should be documented by [CONTACT_495745].   
7.0 Privacy and Confidentiality  
• Describe whether the study will use or disclose subjects’ Protected Health 
Information (PHI).  
The project data manager will use data from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW)  to identify potentially 
eligible patients. The data manager maintains these files.  
 
Potential participants will be sent an introductory packet from the AAVA. After one week , the coordinator will 
telephone those Veterans who did not op -out, and if the patie nt is interested, the coordinator will administer the 
Brief Screener by [CONTACT_495746] a clinically meaningful 
symptom burden score ( 1 or higher  on any one symptom, as a measure of low function or high  symptom burden) 
on at least one item.  
 
Once the Veteran has been deemed eligible, the information sheet has been reviewed, all questions have been 
answered, and the patient has verbally consented to participate, the study coordinator will then administer  the 
baseline survey over the telephone.  
 
Survey data will be entered by [CONTACT_495747] -restricted study 
folder on a secure server behind the VA firewall. Survey data will be linked through study ID to data obta ined from 
the automated telephone system and to utilization data collected from administrative databases 12 months 
following enrollment. All datasets will be stored and merged in an access -restricted study folder behind the VA 
firewall for analysis by [CONTACT_495748].  
 
 
• Describe the steps that will be taken to secure the data (e.g., training, 
authorization of access, password protection, encryption, physical controls, 
Certificates of Confidentiality, and separation of identifiers and data)  
All paper reco rds will be kept in locked offices in locked file cabinets in VA offices. Access to the file cabinets will 
be restricted to research  personnel. All electronic data  will be kept secured on VA servers behind the VA firewall. 
No data will be stored on compute r hard drives.  
 
To minimize the risk of a breach of confidentiality, we will perform the following steps. First, as soon as the cohort 
is defined by [CONTACT_58047], each patient in the cohort will be assigned a unique study ID. We will then create 
an ele ctronic tracking file on an access -restricted secure drive that maps the study participant’s identifying 
information to the study ID. No identifying information will be placed on data collection forms (e.g. surveys). 
Identifiers of potential recruits and s tudy participants will be maintained to allow for follow -up contacts during the 
data collection phase. These will be kept in study folders accessible only by [CONTACT_495749] 10 -1 (RCS 10 -1) once d irection for destruction of research records is 
published by [CONTACT_91719]. Electronic data will be maintained behind the secure VA firewall and maintained by [CONTACT_495717]. All identifiable data will be kept behind the firewall, with access only  available to key 
study team members. The data manager will be responsible for creating analytic datasets for statisticians and 
investigators; these datasets will be de -identified per HIPAA guidelines. All resulting research data will be 
presented in aggre gate only. Furthermore, study staff sign a pledge of confidentiality and understand that breach 
of confidentiality is grounds for dismissal. Study staff are required to complete annual training on privacy and 
HIPPA, as well as biannual training on human su bjects protection.  
 
Information entered into the automated telephone monitoring system by [CONTACT_495706]’s Patient Care Database and from the baseline survey (specifically 
name, address,  telephone number, age, ethnicity, marital/relationship status, prostate cancer treatment type , time 
since treatment , service branch and survey scores ). This information will be entered by [CONTACT_280254] a secure 
v. 6.14.[ADDRESS_637278] access to identifiable informatio n; however, we are in the process of obtaining a 
data use agreement. Also, CHCR staff working on this project have completed the WOC process mandatory 
training including VA Privacy and Information Security Awareness and Rules of Behavior and Privacy and HI PAA 
Training.  
 
The website used to transfer data to CHCR will be protected by a Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol , 
ensuring that all data transmissions between a user’s browser and the web server are encrypted and are 
therefore secure.  The Transport  Layer Security (TLS) protocol in use on the website supports both 128 -bit and 
256-bit encryption, depending on the user’s browser. In addition, FIPS [ADDRESS_637279] be stored in an encrypted partition on the Requestor’s or its 
contractors/subcontractors information system hard drive using FIPS 140 -2 validated software .   (See 
http://csrc.nist.go v/groups/STM/cmvp/validation.html for a complete list of validated cryptographic modules).  The 
application must be capable of key recovery and a copy of the encryption key(s) must be stored in multiple secure 
locations.  FIPS 140 -2 (or current version) co mpliant / NIST validated encryption will be used to secure VHA data 
stored on any portable drives, IT components, disks, CD’s / DVD’s.  
 
Data at CHCR will be stored on web servers running in a virtual server environment. MiServer is a U -M-hosted 
service ma intained on the Ann Arbor campus. MiServer includes safeguards required by [CONTACT_2373]. These 
datacenters provide protection from lengthy outages, 24/[ADDRESS_637280] protected. The server runs Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 -based operating 
system and security patches and updates are downloaded and installed automatically. The following FIPS 
validated software will be used:  
#1933 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 dm -crypt Cryptographic Module  
#1901 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 Kernel Crypto API [INVESTIGATOR_495686]  
#1792 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 OpenSSH Server Cryptographic Module  
#1758 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 OpenSSL Cryptographic Module  
As listed here:  
http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/140 -1/140val -all.htm  
 
All study data will be stored in a pa ssword -protected MySQL database residing on an encrypted volume using the 
FIPS validated dm -crypt software. Access to the database is restricted to the server. No external access is 
available. Access to servers by [CONTACT_495719] a password -protected, TLS -encrypted web console 
using the FIPS validated OpenSSL software, available at https://pcare.miserver.it.umich.edu/. Access to the web 
console is logged for auditing purposes. Modification to participant records are also logged. Study data can only 
be downloaded from the web console by [CONTACT_32938].  
 
Each server is also protected by [CONTACT_495720]. Workstation computers with 
server access are configured to require passwords (which adhere to the Univers ity of Michigan’s Password Policy) 
in order to log in, wake from sleep, or unlock screen savers.  
 
Data are provided to researchers in coded form, with all personally identifying information removed. Upon study 
completion, CHCR will delete all participant d ata (as will be described in the DUA) and all data stored on VA 
servers will be permanently de -identified for archive and then destroyed according to VHA Records Control 
Schedule 10 -1 (RCS 10 -1) once direction for destruction of research records is publish ed by [CONTACT_91719].  
 
8.0 Communication Plan  
• Include plan for ensuring all required local site approvals are obtained and 
notifying the Director of any facility where the research in being conducted but the 
facility is not engaged.  
v. 6.14.[ADDRESS_637281] manager will verify VA Cen tral IRB approval and the local VA facility approval before study recruitment 
can begin at that site. There are no facilities where the research is being conducted but the facility is not engaged in 
research.  
• Include plan for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_495693], 
informed consent, and HIPAA authorization  
As this project is being implemented, the research team will conduct regular conference calls (approximately weekly) 
with the implementation team at each site, to track progress an d address any questions that arise regarding 
implementation. These weekly calls will continue for the first few months of patient enrollment and will decrease in 
frequency as appropriate, depending on the challenges (or lack thereof) associated with implem entation.  
• Include plan for informing local sites of any Serious Adverse Events , 
Unanticipated Problems , or interim results that may impact conduct of the study . 
Reports of related SAEs and  UAPs and protocol deviations will be made by [CONTACT_495750], the site coordinator, or the project manager to the VA Central IRB (CIRB). The Ann Arbor project manager 
should be notified at the same time a report is made if the report is coming from another site’s study team member. 
Any unant icipated related incidents involving a death at any of the [ADDRESS_637282] manager as they are discovered, and will be reported to the 
CIRB in summary at the time of continuing review/proje ct closure. Protocol deviations/violations that are likely to 
substantially adversely affect 1) the rights, safety, or welfare of a participant; 2) a participant’s willingness to continue  
participation; or 3) the integrity of the research data, including V A information security requirements will all be reported 
within 5 working days of being made aware of the occurrence. These will be reported through the secure SharePoint 
site dedicated to this purpose.  
• Include plan for ensuring the study is conducted acco rding to the IRB -approved 
protocol.  
The regular calls mentioned above will be used as opportunities to ensure the study is conducted according to the 
IRB-approved protocol. These team calls will include discussion of any updates to the protocol, recruitmen t 
procedures, and any issues (i.e. SAEs, UAPs, and protocol deviations, etc) that arise during the course of the study. 
Minutes for these meetings, and any updated documentation, will be posted to the AAVA study drive, to which study 
staff will have access . 
• Include plan for notifying all local facility directors and LSIs when a multi -site 
study reaches the point that it no longer requires engagement of the local facility 
(e.g., all subsequent follow -up of subjects will be performed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_495694]).  
At the end of any individual site’s particip ation in this research, the  local facility director and LSI will be notified by [CONTACT_495751].

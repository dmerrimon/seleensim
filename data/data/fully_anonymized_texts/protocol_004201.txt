1. Background  
Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) Closure (LAAC) is a potent technique of LAA isolation and 
exclusion for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation, with evidence from the 
PROTECT -AF and PREVAIL -AF trials, including their 5 -year follow -up assessments, 
solidifying LAAC as a viable option in these patients with comparable stroke reduction  in 
comparison to oral anticoagulation (OAC) as well as a reduction in bleeding risk, hemorrhagic 
CVA, and mortality [1-3].  However, the surge in the multiple methods of LAA exclusion has 
also brought to attention postprocedural complications specific to LAAC, namely, peri -device 
leaks (PDL) [4]. The s troke implication and classification of PDL itself still lacks consensus, 
with an increased thromboembolic (TE) potential due to PDL seen in patients with LARIAT and 
surgical ligation procedures, yet no statistically significant relationship seen in percut aneous and 
endocardial LAA closure approaches [5-9]. PDL > 5mm has been widely accepted as clinically 
significant, although there remains limited data with no current established guidelines. [5, 6, 10] .  
Placement of a septal occluder device such as Amplatzer Vascular Plug, Detachable 
embolization coils, Gore Cardioform Septal Occluder (CSO; W.L. Gore and Associates, Newark 
DE), and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) have all emerged as options to resolve residual PDL 
and post -surgical/ligation lea ks [5, 10-12].  However, there exists no head -to-head comparison 
between these modalities.  Given their emergence, we proposed a multi -center observational 
study to further assess and evaluate these three treatment modalities for their efficacy for leak 
closure, assessment of pre -, peri - and post -procedur al characteristics after leak closure, TE 
events, and bleeding risk, and complication rates.  
2. Objectives : 
Primary Objective:   
Our main objective is to collect data from multiple different centers that use different modalities 
to currently treat either central or peri -device leaks that occur after incomplete LAA closure, and 
compare each modality in their efficacy and safety outco mes.  
Primary Outcome:  To compare the efficacy of the three current methods of PDL closure 
modalities in patients with prior incomplete LAAC.  
Secondary Outcome:  To compare the r ates or reduction of rates  of thromboembolic  events  and 
procedure -related comp lications in patients after successful PDL closure with any of the three 
closure modalities.  
 
3. Research Methods and Statistical Considerations:  
Research Methods:  
This will be a multi - center retro spective observational comparison study.  
Study Population:   
All patients at risk for stroke or thromboembolism that demonstrated any degree of the 
significant leak on follow up TEE imaging at least 4 -6 weeks following either epi[INVESTIGATOR_371542], 
endocardial, or surgical LAAC were included in this study population. All pat ients were 
evaluated and followed with imaging, and per investigators' respective clinical judgement, then 
proceeded to have an intervention for leak closure with either detachable embolization coils, 
vascular plugs/CSO, or RFA.  
Inclusion Criteria :  
- patien ts at risk for stroke or thromboembolism that demonstrated any degree of the 
significant leak on follow up TEE imaging at least 4 -6 weeks following either epi[INVESTIGATOR_371542], 
endocardial, or surgical LAAC  
- Patients undergoing any form of eccentric or centric/centra l leak closure with available 
modalities (detachable embolization coils, vascular plu g/septal /ASD occluders, or RF 
Ablation). Criteria for this was made based on the judgement of the operator, with no 
specific cutoffs for leak size , follow -up time from LAA C to leak closure, etc)  
- Age greater than 18 years  
Exclusion Criteria :  
- Patients not undergoing leak closure after incomplete LAAC  
- Patients unable to complete 45 -day follow -up imaging for reevaluation of LAA leak  
- Patients unable to consent  
Primary Endpoints :  
1. To compare the efficacy of the three PDL closure modalities in patients with prior LAAC  
Secondary Endpoints:  
1. To compare the reduction/rates of TE events  and procedure -related complications  (DRT, 
pericardial effusion/cardiac tamponade, or CVA/TIA)  in patients after successful PDL 
closure with any of the three closure modalities  
a. Periprocedural complications occurring from Postoperative day #0 – day 7  
b. Delayed procedure -related complications and adverse events within 90 days of 
procedure  
Informed Cons ent:  
Given that this study was observational and retrospective in design, no informed consent was 
obtained or required. Patients who met inclusion/exclusion criteria were de -identified and added 
to word documents/excel spreadsheets.  
Data storage/Confiden tiality:  
Data will be collected in word documents, PDFs, and excel sheets. Data recorded on the 
worksheets will be entered into a secure password protected computer database by [CONTACT_829421]/cardiac centers. Only inv estigators involved in the study 
will have access to the data. All data will be reported in aggregate form and no names will be 
used for any publications resulting from the research. De identification of data will be done at the 
earliest.  
Sample Size:  
We will plan to aim for a total size of 1 60 patients in total among all three modalities.   
Statistical Analysis:  
Continuous variables will be  summarized using mean and standard deviation, while categorical 
variables will be  summarized as counts  and percent of the total. Comparison analysis between 
groups will be  made using  Kruskal -Wallis tests for nonparametric data sets  as appropriate. Leak 
sizes were measured initially and then via postprocedural follow -up, with overall rates of 
closure, minimal -mild leaks, and clinically significant leaks listed with associated p -values .  All 
tests were two -tailed, and a P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.  All 
analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics version [IP_ADDRESS] (IBM).

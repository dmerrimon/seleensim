LaySummary of Proposed Research
Lay Summary of Proposed Research
Thepurpose of thisstudy is to explore the tolerability and effectiveness oftranscranial direct current
stimulation (tDCS) asapotential treatment for non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). NSSI is the deliberate
attempt to harm oneself, most often through cutting or burning, without suicidal intent. NSSI isa
maladaptive emotion-regulation strategy often triggered by[CONTACT_40390], especially those involving
feelings ofrejection. tDCS is a low-cost, portable, well-tolerated, non-invasive form of brain stimulation
that delivers alowcurrent toaspecific area ofthe brain via electrodes. Several studies have demonstrated
its effectiveness in treating an array of conditions, depending on electrode placement, including depression
andchronic pain. tDCS may also facilitate adaptive emotion regulation; researchers have also successfully
used tDCS to reduce negative emotions and aggressive responses to social rejection. We therefore seek to
explore tDCS as apotential treatment for NSSI. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_40352] 1)to examine how tDCS is

protocol will minimize the burden of study visits and allow patients to continue participating in research
from thecomfort of their homes when in-person procedures arenot possible. During tDCS, participants will
listen to an audio file with different sounds andavoice instructing them to switch their attention between
thedifferent sounds. ThefMRI task will be performed at baseline and again after the completion of 12
sessions of tDCS. Subjects’ NSSI andurges toengage inNSSI willbe recorded for three weeks in real-time,

Background, Significance and  Rationale
Background, Significance and Rationale
Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), “the deliberate, self-inflicted destruction of body tissue without suicidal 
intent” ((Nock & Favazza, 2009), http://www.itriples.org/isss-aboutself-i.html), is a serious psychiatric 
problem (Briere & Gil, 1998; E. D. Klonsky, 2011) that is observed across a broad array of psychiatric and 
developmental conditions, including major depression, borderline personality disorder, intellectual 
disabilities, autism, Prader-Willi Syndrome, and Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome (Symons et al., 2001). NSSI is one 
of the most predictive risk factors for suicide attempts (Andover & Gibb, 2010; Favaro et al., 2008; E. 
David Klonsky, May, & Glenn, 2013; Lloyd-Richardson, Perrine, Dierker, & Kelley, 2007; Nock, Joiner, 
Gordon, Lloyd-Richardson, & Prinstein, 2006), and has a high prevalence, with estimates suggesting that 
about 21% of adult psychiatric inpatients (Briere & Gil, 1998) and 30-40% of adolescent inpatients have a 
history of NSSI (Darche, 1990). As the pathophysiology of NSSI is not well understood, clinicians have 
limited ability to predict which treatments will be most effective for specific individuals suffering from 
NSSI, making cases frequently persistent and treatment-refractory (Perry et al., 2009). Novel studies based 
on possible underlying mechanisms for NSSI are greatly needed to reduce the morbidity and mortality 
associated with this behavioral phenomenon. 
 
NSSI is a maladaptive emotion regulation strategy. People who engage in NSSI are more likely to have high 
sensitivity to social rejection and perceived social rejection can trigger the urge to engage in NSSI, (Nock, 
Prinstein, & Sterba, 2009). Studies using fMRI have shown that patients who frequently engage in NSSI 
also have heightened BOLD responses to social rejection in regions associated with subjective distress, such 
as the anterior insula (AI) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) (Brown et al., 2017; Groschwitz, 
Plener, Groen, Bonenberger, & Abler, 2016). This sample also exhibited abnormal responses in the 
ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, a key region for inhibitory control over emotions and response tendencies. 
The vlPFC has been shown to exert top-down influence on the amygdala and nucleus accumbens (Berkman, 
Kahn, & Merchant, 2014; Berkman & Lieberman, 2009; Cohen, Berkman, & Lieberman, 2013; Wager, 
Davidson, Hughes, Lindquist, & Ochsner, 2008; Wagner & Heatherton, 2013), subcortical regions involved 
in emotion-generation, during emotion regulation tasks such as reappraisal. During social rejection, activity

in the vlPFC negatively correlates with both subjective reports of distress as well as BOLD activity in the AI 
and dACC (Eisenberger, Lieberman, & Williams, 2003; Eisenberger, Way, Taylor, Welch, & Lieberman, 
2007; Kawamoto et al., 2012; Onoda et al., 2010), demonstrating its importance in shapi[INVESTIGATOR_40356].  Collectively, these data suggest that the vlPFC may be a promising target for 
NSSI treatment. 
 
Novel brain stimulation approaches may modulate vlPFC activity and, in so doing, could potentially exert 
therapeutic effects on NSSI. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is an inexpensive, portable, non-
invasive form of brain stimulation that has demonstrated efficacy in major depressive disorder (Brunoni et 
al., 2013), cognitive difficulties (Hoy, Arnold, Emonson, Daskalakis, & Fitzgerald, 2014), and chronic pain 
(Villamar et al., 2013). By [CONTACT_40391], tDCS 
may facilitate adaptive emotional responses to the environment. Recent studies have shown reductions in 
emotional distress and aggression following social rejection in healthy participants by [CONTACT_40392] (vlPFC) using tDCS (Riva, Lauro, DeWall, & Bushman, 2012; Riva, Lauro, 
DeWall, Chester, & Bushman, 2014; Riva, Lauro, Vergallito, DeWall, & Bushman, 2015). In her doctoral 
work, [CONTACT_40449] found reductions in rumination following social rejection due to vlPFC tDCS were 
directly related to trait emotion regulation abilities whereby [CONTACT_40393] (Yttredahl, 2019).
The primary aim of this study is to examine the tolerability and effectiveness of tDCS in treating NSSI and 
urges to engage in NSSI. For this experiment in which we are examining the effects of anodal vLPFC tDCS 
on NSSI behavior and the neural correlates of social rejection assessed by [CONTACT_40394], we plan to enroll up to 50 
individuals who engage in frequent NSSI to obtain a sample of 23 subjects who complete the study 
procedures. Participants will be randomized to receive active anodal vs. sham tDCS to right vlPFC for two 
twenty-minute applications on each of six alternating days over approximately two weeks. During the 
stimulation, participant behavior will be standardized by [CONTACT_40395]. NSSI behaviors and urges will be recorded for 
three weeks using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), a novel procedure that minimizes recall bias 
by [CONTACT_40396], feelings, and behaviors of subjects in real time. This will allow measurement of 
NSSI urges and behaviors for the weeks before, during, and after the tDCS intervention. Our first goal in 
this study is to characterize tolerability and acceptability of this intervention in this population. Secondly, 
we wish to identify changes in BOLD responses to social rejection from pre- to post-tDCS using fMRI. We 
hypothesize that activity in the AI, dACC, and amygdala during rejection will be attenuated by [CONTACT_32101]. 
Lastly, it is hypothesized that tDCS directed to the right vlPFC will lead to reductions in both NSSI and in 
urges to engage in NSSI. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_40357].
In order to continue to conduct research with patients who engage in NSSI, given the current state-instituted 
shutdown of in-person research activities, we are adding a remote-tDCS arm to our study. Remotely 
supervised, at-home tDCS has been gaining traction in clinical research in order to broaden the reach of 
clinical trials and reduce burdensome travel for patients receiving multiple tDCS sessions (Charvet et al., 
2015; Cucca et al., 2019). Specialized tDCS devices, such as the Mini-CT (Soterix, Inc) used in this study, 
have been developed to allow researchers to strictly control the dosing and timing of self-administered tDCS 
in the clinical setting (Charvet et al., 2015; Cucca et al., 2019; Shaw et al., 2017). These devices, combined 
with validated protocols, enable researchers and clinicians to provide safe, reliable, reproducible tDCS

stimulation to patients outside of the clinic (Charvet et al., 2015, 2020). Patients who enroll in our study are 
monitored regularly by a psychiatrist who provides open treatment for three months at the conclusion of 
tDCS procedures (and sooner in the event of clinical worsening). By [CONTACT_40397] a remote tDCS arm, we will 
be able to continue to enroll participants in research procedures, offer treatment following research 
procedures, and add valuable data to the literature on the feasibility and efficacy of at-home remotely-
supervised tDCS in this clinical population. This same equipment and procedure will be used in the 
neuroimaging arm of the study as well, so that participants who feel comfortable enough to receive MRI 
scanning at NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_40358].
 
Heart rate variability: The autonomic nervous system (ANS) plays an intrinsic role in the coordinated brain-
body activity that gives rise to subjective emotional states and enables regulation of ongoing emotional 
experience. Increased heart rate, which may be parasympathetically and/or sympathetically driven, 
contributes somatic cues necessary to discern emotional feeling states and mount an appropriate response 
(Levenson, 2003). Cardiac innervation from the parasympathetic branch of the ANS enables rapid and 
flexible modulation of the heart rhythm, allowing swift adjustment to complex emotional demands (Thayer 
& Lane, 2000). By [CONTACT_40398], we will 
be able to analyze these real-time sympathetic and parasympathetic responses to social rejection. Concurrent 
autonomic measurement may also aid in interpreting neural responses to task-relevant stimuli. These data 
will complement our investigation of the effectiveness of tDCS in facilitating adaptive emotion regulation in 
individuals with NSSI. 
Specific Aims  and Hypotheses
Specific Aims and Hypotheses
Aims/Hypotheses [ADDRESS_42128] arm of the study.
1. Evaluate  the tolerability and acceptability of a tDCS intervention in a sample of individuals engaging 
in frequent NSSI. We hypothesize that 6 treatments of tDCS (two times per day for three days over 
right vlPFC) will be well-tolerated by [CONTACT_40399]. 
2. Characterize  changes in BOLD responses to social rejection from pre- to post-tDCS sessions in the 
active tDCS group compared to the sham tDCS group using fMRI and a social exclusion task called 
Cyberball. Hypothesis: BOLD activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, the anterior insula, the 
amygdala, and the medial PFC/rostral ACC will scale with different percentages of exclusion in 
Cyberball. Furthermore, there will be a significant interaction effect whereby [CONTACT_40400] 2 compared 
with those in the active group. 
3. Gather  pi[INVESTIGATOR_40359] a regular basis. Hypothesis: tDCS directed to the right 
ventrolateral prefrontal cortex will lead to greater reductions in both NSSI and in urges to engage in

Patients with NSSI:
a. Gender: Based on previous clinical trials and biological studies in our research division recruiting 
individuals with self-injury, 60% of participants were female. 
b. Ethnicity: No ethnic/racial group is excluded. Since subjects will be recruited by [CONTACT_40401], we expect that the sample will be similar to those who 
have responded to our advertisements in the past. Based on previous clinical trials and biological studies in 
our research division recruiting individuals with self-injury, we anticipate that our study population will be 
approximately 15% Hispanic, 85% non-Hispanic; 75% white, 22% black, and 3% Asian. 
Description of subject population
Patients with NSSI undergoing tDCS and fMRI:
Our sample will be defined by a symptom/pattern of behavior, and not by a DSM-V diagnosis. Specifically, 
we seek to recruit individuals engaging in frequent NSSI, because that is the symptom that we will attempt 
to target with this treatment. We aim to recruit [ADDRESS_42137] withdrawal prior to study completion, and 
failure to attend appointments.

in the NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_40373]’s June 1st memo, which include but are not limited to:
• Infection Control/PPE – Guidelines
•
 Research participants will only come on-site if absolutely necessary for study procedures.
• No volunteers/externs on-site during Stage 1.
• Clinical research teams will screen their participants for COVID symptoms (night before and day of onsite 
visit, documenting this in the chart), and escort them in and out of the building.
• COVID/COVID-like symptoms in participants will be reported to the IRB via PRISM as an SAE.
 
Sample of patients with NSSI:
All of the study procedures are listed below. Participants who enroll in the arm of the study without 
neuroimaging will follow all procedures described below with the exception of the neuroimaging-related 
procedures (MRI). Participants will follow all procedures described below remotely, with the exception of 
the neuroimaging-related procedures (MRI). For females of childbearing age, a urine HCG test will be sent 
by [CONTACT_40415]. Participants will be asked to photograph the results of 
the test and upload them through RedCap or attach.nyspi.org. For both arms of the study, participants will 
have the option of receiving tDCS in-person or remotely.
Subjects who frequently engage in NSSI will be recruited as described above and will co-enroll in the brief 
medical
 assessment arm of IRB Protocol #4815. Following informed consent for participation, screening 
evaluation will be performed at study entrance through IRB protocol #4815 and will include a complete 
medical history and remote clinical examination to exclude significant physical illness. 
Psychological Assessments
Psychological assessments and their timing are described in the “Assessment Instruments” section. 
Real-Time Monitoring of NSSI, Stressors, and Urges 
In addition to using retrospective reports of NSSI, we will also employ a recently developed assessment, 
Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA). EMA records thoughts, feelings and behaviors and the 
circumstances preceding these experiences in real time, which may allow for a more accurate understanding 
of mood and behavior than retrospective reporting (Nock et al., 2009). 
In this study, we will use EMA to have participants rate the frequency, duration, and severity of urges to 
engage in NSSI, the frequency and nature of actual NSSI, as well as suicidal ideation, relevant affects, 
stressors and behaviors, and possible triggers for these events, for one week prior to treatment, through the 
duration of the course of tDCS treatments, and one week following completion of tDCS, to measure the 
persistence of any observed effects. These items will be presented to each participant on an iPod device 
during each momentary assessment. We will enter each subject’s self-reported typi[INVESTIGATOR_40374]
[ADDRESS_42164] used this procedure in a NIMH-funded study of actively suicidal patients without adverse effects 
and with good adherence. 
MRI Scans: 
MRI images will be acquired at the [LOCATION_001] State Psychiatric Institute on a GE SIGNA Premier 3T MRI 
scanner. Subjects will undergo T1-weighted structural imaging and a functional EPI, during which the 
Cyberball task will be presented (described below). If time allows, they may undergo diffusion tensor 
imaging (DTI) as well as a resting-state fMRI scan. Scans will not last more than [ADDRESS_42165]. 
Heart Rate  Variability:
 
Participants will be outfitted with MR-safe ECG leads in a lead II configuration before entering the scanner. 
The lead II configuration places the positive electrode near the lower left rib and the negative electrode near 
the right arm, just below the clavicle. This configuration maximizes the R spi[INVESTIGATOR_40375]. 
A third reference lead can be placed on either the lower right rib or near the left arm. Placement on the trunk 
rather than limbs will minimize artifacts due to movement. 
tDCS: 
All tDCS sessions for participants who do not participate in neuroimaging, may occur either remotely (see 
section below on "Remote tDCS") or at the M.I.N.D. Clinic at NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_40376]. Miller, 
who has completed training in tDCS with [CONTACT_40450] and his staff, by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Yttredahl, who has previous

minutes at each treatment. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either sham stimulation, which 
consists of a ramp-up to 1.5mA followed by [CONTACT_40417]-down and 20-minutes of no-stimulation, or

active stimulation which consists of 20-minutes of stimulation at 1.5mA between the ramp-up and ramp-
down. Both participants and researchers will be blind to the tDCS assignment. The anode will be positioned 
over right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), and the cathode will be positioned over the left supra-
orbital area. Non-metallic, conductive rubber electrodes will be used, as recommended by [CONTACT_40418], 2000. Electrode sponges will be kept moist in order to avoid skin irritation and will be secured using 
non-conductive elastic bands. If using paste, an even application of Ten20 paste will be spread on the 
electrodes to sit between the electrode and the skin to avoid skin irritation.  If contact [CONTACT_40419], additional conductive gel may be applied to the electrodes. tDCS administrations 
will be performed using the Mini-CT from Soterix Medical Inc. Soterix is a well-established company 
creating and supplying research- and clinical-grade tDCS devices that have been used in over [ADDRESS_42166] all surfaces in the participant area and the tDCS device with 
Super Sani Cloths or similar alcohol-based disinfectant cloths.
 
Attention Training Technique: 
 
During tDCS, participants will undergo the Attention Training Technique (ATT). This task involves 
listening to an approximately 12-minute audio file at a comfortable volume over a pair of headphones, 
earbuds, or stereo speakers. Participants are asked to focus on a visual fixation point in the room and engage 
in three attention exercises: 1)selective attention (focusing on indivisual sounds), 2) attention switching 
(shifting attention between different sounds), and 3) divided attention (attending to sounds simultaneously).
Open Treatment: 
Beginning one week after the conclusion of the tDCS treatment week, participants will be offered [ADDRESS_42167] in our division. 
Cyberball: 
Participants will be presented with animated drawings depi[INVESTIGATOR_40377]'s avatar and two other 2 
cartoon figures tossing a ball between each other and the participant. When the participant's avatar receives 
the ball, they will press one of two buttons indicating which of the other two cartoons will receive the ball 
next. The number of times the ball is tossed to the participant will vary each block, such that the participants 
feel excluded from the game to varying degrees. Participants will be told before the study that the other 
characters are not real people and that they are not really playing the game with other people, but asked to 
imagine it as though it were real. At the end of each scan, an investigator will check in with the participant

to make sure the task did not cause significant, lasting distress. If the participants are upset following the 
task, a clinician will be available to speak with the participant. After scan 2, the check-in will include a full 
debriefing about the purpose of the task, including an explanation that Cyberball is a simulation of social 
exclusion. During debriefing, participants will be reminded that the task was only a computer game and the 
other players were not real people.  
Remote tDCS:
Following
 consenting procedures, remote patients with NSSI will participate in all above procedures with 
the exception of in-person medical assessment and neuroimaging-related procedures (MRI). All 
assessments, clinical interviews, and procedures will be administered remotely. Cyberball will be presented 
through the computer outside of an fMRI scan. Participants will be provided with a tDCS device, headgear, 
and supply kit through the mail, and will be trained on tDCS self-administration over a HIPAA-compliant 
video-conferencing software (either CUIT-supported Zoom or NYS WebEx) by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Yttredahl or [CONTACT_10017]. 
Participants may be provided a laptop or tablet and headphones in their tDCS kit to ensure access for those 
who may not otherwise have the ability to use the videoconferencing software at home. The Mini-CT, our 
tDCS device, is intended for home use; it can be controlled via single-use codes that will be provided before 
each session once the researcher supervising the session confirms proper placement of the electrodes 
through visual inspection over the secure video-conferencing platform. Using these codes, the dose and 
timing will be controlled remotely, and the device will not operate without a code. Each tDCS session will 
be supervised over a HIPAA-compliant video conferencing platform by [CONTACT_40420]. Yttredahl or [CONTACT_10017]. 
The participant will be trained in how to terminate the tDCS stimulation at any time should they experience 
significant adverse effects during stimulation. The audio file for the ATT will be sent to participants who 
may then use their own (or researcher-provided) speaker or headphone system to listen to the task during 
each tDCS session. Audio setup will be tested with a test audio file (not the ATT) to confirm that the audio 
system is functioning properly prior to initiating tDCS. In addition to instructions received by [CONTACT_40421] ([CONTACT_10017] or Yttredahl) during the videoconference, participants will also be provided with 
detailed instructions and diagrams explaining the setup and use of the device. Participants will be instructed 
to re-package the device, accessories, and any other borrowed equipment (e.g., tablet) in the provided box 
and mail the package back to the experimenters using a prepaid label included in the kit.
 
Sample of healthy volunteers for fMRI pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]:
Following consenting procedures, volunteers will participate in the social feedback task listed in the 
previous paragraph during fMRI scanning. MRI images will be acquired at the [LOCATION_001] State Psychiatric 
Institute on a GE SIGNA Premier 3T MRI scanner. Subjects will undergo T1-weighted structural imaging 
using the same procedures listed above. Participants will also undergo functional imaging during the task 
presentation. The entire scan session is expected to last approximately [ADDRESS_42168] 5 days between scan sessions.

Data and safety monitoring plan: 
Overview: Given that we are conducting a small pi[INVESTIGATOR_9416] a minimal risk intervention in which 
concurrent ongoing treatments are permitted, we have developed a data and safety monitoring plan, as 
described below, to ensure and oversee the safety of participants. 
PI/IRB involvement: Approval for the proposed study and all amendments will be obtained by [CONTACT_40422] 
[INVESTIGATOR_40378]. The PIs will be responsible for monitoring 
all procedures related to the study and ensuring safety of participants. The tDCS equipment will be operated 
under IDE exemption under the oversight of the NYSPI [CONTACT_1744]. tDCS is considered a minimal risk procedure 
that may be associated with discomfort during stimulation (e.g. itching, tingling, burning) related to the 
scalp electrical fields but which has not been associated with lasting sequelae following completion of 
stimulation. The PIs, in conjunction with the relevant IRBs will maintain oversight of AEs. Serious adverse 
events, should they occur, will be reported by [CONTACT_40423]. 
Staff Experience: Staff in the Division of Molecular Imaging & Neuropathology at NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_40379]-injurious behavior. Drs. Miller 
and Stanley will review principles of safety assessment with the staff involved in this research (research 
psychologists, research coordinators) prior to study initiation, and will conduct follow-up training and 
supervision as needed. 
Independent safety officer: Because of potential discomfort induced by [CONTACT_32101], a Columbia psychiatrist not 
involved with the study will serve as an independent individual/safety officer. This psychiatrist will 
periodically review reported side effects and will notify the PIs should there be significantly higher than 
anticipated incidence of side-effects, in which case appropriate adjustments will be made to the stimulation 
protocols, and case procedures would be reviewed. The psychiatrist will also review the Clinical Global 
Protocol Summary Form
[ADDRESS_42169] who is serving as the 
independent reviewer. These reports will include: (1) whether participants’ safety, privacy and 
confidentiality has been consistently assured by [CONTACT_473]; (2) review of interim data analyses that 
bear on outcomes of the study and risk/benefit ratios to participants, including recommendations for 
statistical analyses; (3) judgment as to whether research instruments have been administered in a uniform 
manner and in a way that maintains the participants’ privacy; (4) a review of the study’s progress toward 
recruitment goals, quality of data (e.g., appropriate completion of forms), and participant retention/attrition 
rates; and, (5) a review of new scientific literature pertinent to the safety of participants or ethics of research 
participation. 
There will be regular, ongoing communication between the PIs and the IRBs as well as with the independent 
psychiatrist. While no serious and unexpected adverse events are expected, any unanticipated study 
problems will be reported to both IRBs. The study personnel will take all clinically appropriate actions to 
prevent and treat psychiatric emergencies in participants. 
Rationale for monitoring strategy: As per PHS guidelines (PHS SF424, section 4.15), other potential 
monitoring plans include a designated medical monitor; an Internal Committee or Board, or Data Safety and 
Monitoring Boards (DSMB). DSMBs are required for phase III and multisite studies, but, as per guidance, 
“smaller clinical trials may not require this oversight format and alternative monitoring plans may be 
appropriate”. In the case of this study, we note that the number of subjects is small and that tDCS is 
considered a minimal risk device that has been extensively used in prior human research. Thus, we feel that 
a DSMB would entail unnecessary administrative burden, and use of an independent safety officer, as 
above, represents the most appropriate level of oversight.

procedures. If individuals endorse suicidal ideation that includes a plan and intent, or have made an actual 
suicide attempt, research procedures will be discontinued, and open clinical treatment will be initiated 
immediately at an appropriate level of care.

Assessment Instruments
Create a table or give a brief description of the instruments that will be used for assessment
Sample of patients with NSSI:
 
Through co-enrollment in IRB #4815, participants will undergo a careful psychological assessment 
including characterization of DSM-IV diagnoses using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV 
(SCID, (First et al., 1995; First et al., 1997)). Recent suicidal ideation and behaviors will be assessed using 
the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), which will be repeated on a weekly basis during 
tDCS administration to monitor emergent suicidal ideation (Posner et al., 2011). Selected items from the 
Self-Injurious Thoughts and Behaviors Interview (SITBI) will be used at baseline and on a weekly basis to 
monitor self-reported frequency, nature, motivations, and effects of NSSI, as well as urges to engage in 
NSSI, throughout study participation. Selected items from the Non-Suicidal Self-Injury Assessment Tool 
(NSSI-AT) will also be acquired at baseline to acquire additional information regarding history of NSSI 
behavior. The Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI) (Guy et al., 1976) will be conducted on a weekly 
basis to monitor for clinical worsening. Possible mediators of treatment outcome that will be examined in 
the study include: emotion regulation using the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS, (Gratz et 
al., 2004)) and the Cognitive-Attentional Syndrome Questionnaire (CAS-1; Wells, 2009); engagement with 
the ATT with the ATT-Scale; trait rumination with the Ruminative Responses Scale (RRS; Treynor et al., 
2003) expectancy of clinical benefit, assessed with the Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire (Devilly et al., 
2000); and depression severity, as assessed by [CONTACT_40424] (HDRS, (Hamilton, 
1960)) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI, (Beck et al., 1961)). Tolerability of tDCS will be evaluated 
using the tDCS Adverse Effects Questionnaire (Aparicio et al., 2016). 
 
Sample of remote-only patients with NSSI: Rater-administrated psychological assessments will be 
administered by [CONTACT_40425]-conference, and participants will be sent a link to complete self-
report measures remotely through a secure platform (either REDCap, SIR, or Qualtrix). Cyberball will be 
remotely administered within one week before the first tDCS session and within one week after the final 
tDCS session. The original version of Cyberball was administered and validated for use as a digital task 
outside of the scanner (Williams, Cheung, & Choi, 2000).

ExplainNo serious adverse events have been attributed to tDCS administration in over 10,000 subjects reported in
any studies published in the modern eraoftDCS, from 1998 to2014 (Fregni et al, "Regulatory
considerations for the clinical and research use of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS): Review and
recommendations from anexpert panel; Clin Res Regul Aff. 2015 Mar 1;32(1):22-35). Therisks to human
subjects directly associated with tDCS administration include amild tingling sensation, slight epi[INVESTIGATOR_40380] (42); these do not tend
topersist beyond the completion ofthe tDCS stimulation. Mild headache has been occasionally reported
with tDCS, buttypi[INVESTIGATOR_40381], ibuprofen, or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]. As such, devices used to
administer tDCS have routinely been determined to be non-significant-risk devices by[CONTACT_40426] (Fregni et al, 2015). Moreover, standard tDCS parameters considered tobeminimal risk have been
published in terms of dose (<2.5mA), duration (≤60 minutes), frequency (≤2treatments per day), and

electrodes employed (Fregni et al, 2015). The parameters proposed in this study are all well within these 
standard parameters.
Research Related  Delay to Treatment
Will research procedures result in a delay to treatment?
Yes
Maximum
 duration of delay to any treatment 
Study participants may continue with ongoing psychotherapeutic and/or pharmacologic treatment, as long as 
it was not started within 8 weeks of study enrollment. For participants not currently receiving psychiatric 
treatment, there may be a delay of up to 35 days prior to initiating tDCS through the study, in order to 
schedule baseline assessments, MRI scanning. For patients with bipolar 1 or 2 disorder not on a therapeutic 
dose of a mood stabilizer, evidence-based treatment with mood stabilizer treatment will be offered that 
would begin within 3 weeks of enrollment; tDCS research procedures would be further delayed in this case 
for the purposes of achieving a therapeutic dose of a mood stabilizer (prioritizing this clinical treatment 
ahead of research procedures). 
Maximum duration of delay to standard care or treatment of known efficacy
Eight weeks
Treatment to be provided at the end of the study
One week following the conclusion of tDCS procedures, open medication-based treatment will be offered to 
study participants for a period of three months.
Clinical Treatment  Alternatives
Clinical treatment alternatives
Alternative
 treatments for NSSI include a form of psychotherapy called dialectic behavioral therapy. While 
there are no FDA-approved medications for the treatment of NSSI, medications are sometimes used to treat 
NSSI based on previous research findings. 
Risks/Discomforts/Inconveniences 
Risks that could be encountered during the study period
Risk 1 applies only to the neuroimaging participants. Risks 2 through 5 apply to all participants.
 
Risks associated with participation in this study are related to 1) pregnancy; (MRI); 2) discomfort during 
scanning (MRI); 3) MRI scan; 4) transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS); 5) psychological interviews
1. MRI Scan
The MRI scanner uses a large magnet (3 Tesla) to take pi[INVESTIGATOR_40382], except for persons who have a heart pacemaker, or have metal in their body (e.g. 
Protocol Summary Form

shrapnel or surgical prostheses) which may be affected by [CONTACT_40427]. Subjects will be asked to notify us if 
this is the case. The long-term effects of being placed in a magnet of 3T are unknown. Although there are no 
known risks associated with pregnancy, we will not scan someone who is known to be pregnant. There is 
also the risk of burns from medicinal patches during the MRI; therefore, subjects will be asked to remove 
any patches prior to the scanning session. Some people have reported sensations during the MRI scan, such 
as "tingling" or "twitching" (or, very rarely, a painful sensation), which are caused by [CONTACT_40428]. Occasionally, some people experience nervousness or 
claustrophobic feelings due to the scanner's small space. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_40383], in our experience, no 
one has had sensations from the scanning that did not stop as soon as the scanning stopped. The MRI scan is 
not painful, but having to lie still in the enclosed space of the scanning table is uncomfortable for some 
people.
 
2. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
The
 risks to human subjects directly associated with tDCS administration include a mild tingling sensation, 
slight epi[INVESTIGATOR_40384] 
(Brunoni et al., 2011); these do not tend to persist beyond the completion of the tDCS stimulation. Mild 
headache has been occasionally reported with tDCS, but typi[INVESTIGATOR_40381], ibuprofen, or 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]. During the period of tDCS administration, the participant will be closely and regularly observed and 
asked to report any adverse effects. Subjects may opt to discontinue at any point. We will also regularly 
debrief subjects following tDCS sessions to detect patterns or procedures that might be associated with 
discomfort and will modify procedures as necessary. Similarly, we will continuously monitor the literature 
for procedures that might reduce risk of any discomfort. Participants will complete the tDCS Adverse 
Effects Questionnaire (Aparicio et al., 2016) following each tDCS administration to acquire systematic data 
regarding tolerability and side-effects. Any severe or intolerable side-effects will lead to the immediate 
cessation of the tDCS stimulation, and clinical monitoring and treatment by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Miller or other M.I.N.D. 
division physicians, who will treat and monitor the symptoms until they resolve, and also closely follow up 
with the participant to ensure that the symptoms have not persisted. All adverse events, including serious 
ones, will be reported to the NYSPI [CONTACT_1744], with a review of procedures to determine whether the protocol 
should be modified accordingly. There are no specific risks related to using two different devices for tDCS 
in this study. Remote supervised self-administered tDCS has been successfully and safely performed in 
dozens of studies (Hordacre, 2018). All sessions will be supervised by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Miller or [CONTACT_40449], who will 
use the current best practices in remote administration of tDCS (Charvet et al., 2015, 2020; Shaw et al., 
2017), with guidance and consultation from [CONTACT_40451] of NYU, an expert of remote administration 
of tDCS in clinical research, as needed. The device provided to participants in the remote arm of the study is 
intended for use with remote self-administration, and has been validated for this purpose (clinical uses 
include treatment for ALS (Sivaramakrishnan et al., 2019), MS (Charvet et al., 2018; Kasschau et al., 2016), 
and Parkinson’s Disease (Agarwal et al., 2018; Cucca et al., 2019)), and doses are strictly controlled by 
[CONTACT_25505]-use codes that will be provided to the participants during each session once proper electrode setup 
and placement has been confirmed visually. Research has shown that the adverse events associated with at-
home tDCS are the same as those of in-person tDCS and consist primarily of superficial, temporary 
discomfort such as itching, tingling, or burning sensations (Cucca et al., 2019).
3. Psychological Interviews
Psychological and neurocognitive assessments can be boring, tiring and sometimes disturbing.

Page 36  of 45
4. EMA: 
EMA may be mildly stressful. We have administered the EMA to >50 patients with Borderline Personality 
Disorder with recent suicide attempts and/or NSSI with no adverse effects. We obtained usable data from 
98% of the participants. Data will be downloaded on the next visit to the institution. Once an assessment is 
completed the participant nor anyone else accessing the device will be able to see the responses. 
 
5. Cyberball:
Participants may feel upset, annoyed, bored, or angry during the game, especially during exclusion trials.
 
6. Attention Training Technique:
The ATT could be boring, but is not associated with additional significant risks.
 
7. COVID-[ADDRESS_42172] to screen subjects prior to scanning, maintain security of the 
restricted access areas, and ensure that system security features are in good working order. A research 
physician will be present at all times to monitor patient safety. Operation of cellular (wireless) devices, 
telephones, or two-way radios may produce changes in device output, and thus should not be used in close 
proximity (< 1m).
We do not apply electrodes over broken or irritated skin. The use of other stimulation electrodes during the 
treatment period will be avoided. Lead wires are configured so that they cannot be plugged into power 
outlets such as wall sockets and line cord receptacles.
To ensure participants can safely self-administer tDCS, the following extra procedures will be added to the 
remote tDCS arm of the study:
a. All tDCS sessions will be monitored over a HIPAA compliant videoconferencing software (either NYS 
WebEx or CUIT-supported Zoom) by a trained researcher. We use secure videoconferencing software that 
is HIPAA compliant and approved for this use by [CONTACT_17928]. While quite unlikely, there is a small risk 
that conversations that take place through videoconference could be intercepted, heard, or viewed by [CONTACT_40429]. Before beginning the tDCS, participants will be fully familiarized with all equipment, including 
how to immediately abort a stimulation session in the case of discomfort.
b. tDCS dosing will be strictly controlled by [CONTACT_2329] a device that only starts a stimulation protocol when a 
single-use code is input. Thus, the device can only be activated by [CONTACT_40430], and the single-use codes will activate a 
montage with a pre-set intensity, duration, and condition (sham versus active). In addition, this device has 
Protocol Summary Form
7170
Miller, Jeffrey
Page 37  of 45
an automatic shut-off feature that will cause the stimulation to abort if the impedance goes above a preset 
threshold (a common cause of discomfort). In the case of an aborted session due to high impedance, 
participants will be guided to add additional saline to the sponges using syringes that have been prepared 
with saline and included in the tDCS kit.
c. A specialized headstrap (SNAPstrap), designed by [CONTACT_40431]-determined 
positions on the scalp, will be used to ensure simple and consistent placement of electrodes on the scalp. 
The use of this strap will be further monitored by [CONTACT_40432] a HIPAA compliant videoconferencing software 
before stimulation codes are provided.
d. For hygiene and to control the amount of conductive saline used during each session, single-use pre-
soaked electrode sponges from Soterix will be provided to the participant. These sponges are packaged to 
include the correct amount of saline and designed to snap into the headstrap at the designated locations.
e. The protocol includes the following specific stop/go criteria for each step of the at-home administration, 
derived from the criteria published by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Leigh Charvet (Charvet et al., 2020):
1. Stimulation  will not proceed unless teleconferencing has been initiated with video and audio 
communication established. At least two forms of communication with the participant (e.g., 
telephone and videoconferencing) will be secured and tested before the first tDCS session. If the 
connection is lost during a session, the study technician will attempt to reestablish communication 
using the second form of connection. Participants will be instructed to abort the tDCS session if 
communication is lost. Training and practice on how to abort a session will occur before the first 
tDCS session.
2. Electrode  preparation and position on the scalp has been visually verified by [CONTACT_40433]. 
Intact skin will be assessed through a visual inspection by [CONTACT_40434]. Electrode preparation will be assessed by [CONTACT_40435]. To position 
and hold the electrodes in place, we will be using a SNAPstrap from Soterix. This headgear was 
designed to be used in the home setting and is customized to fit electrodes at the correct anatomical 
locations needed for our specific montage. The strap has two holes, one for each electrode, that are 
placed in the correct location on the band and are color-coded to match the polarity of the electrode 
cables. Participants will be instructed to snap the electrodes into the color-matching holes and place 
the device on their heads so that the band lays across their forehead and an easily-visible marker on 
the front of the strap is centered between the eyebrows. The researcher will confirm that the strap is 
placed in the correct position by [CONTACT_40436].
3. During  the first 1-2 minutes of stimulation, following a complete ramp-up of current, participants 
will be asked to identify any physical sensations and rate them on a scale of 0-10. If any sensation is 
given a rating >4, participants will be asked whether the stimulation is tolerable. If necessary, the 
session will be aborted and the study technician will instruct the participant on how to adjust the 
electrode preparation to attempt to reduce impedance. If tolerability cannot be achieved, tDCS will 
not continue and the session may be rescheduled or the participant may be removed from the study, 
as needed.
3. Psychological interviews
Psychological interviews will be performed by [CONTACT_40437]. 
Subjects may become distressed during testing, in which case, testing will be postponed.

4. EMA: Subjects will not download EMA data themselves and they will not have access to it once a 
session is complete. We provide information about who to contact [CONTACT_40438]. 
 
5. Cyberball
Participants will be informed that they can stop the study procedures at any time without consequence. 
Participants will also be informed that the feedback they receive is not real, but is instead generated by 
[CONTACT_40439]. In addition, a study clinician will be 
available as needed if the task causes substantial distress and patients will be carefully monitored for the 
duration of the study for any adverse effects of study procedures or worsening of symptoms. Social 
feedback paradigms have been administered safely in other studies of patients who engage in NSSI (Brown 
et al., 2017; Malejko et al., 2019).
 
6. Attention Training Technique
Participants will be informed that they can stop the study procedures at any time without consequence.
 
7. COVID-[ADDRESS_42173] all subjects in the importance of social distancing and 
wearing a mask at all times during travel to and from NYSPI [INVESTIGATOR_40385]. On the days of the MRI 
scans we will offer to pay for an Uber ride for subjects living in the extended [LOCATION_001] metropolitan area.

will be kept in secure storage at the [LOCATION_001] State Psychiatric Institute. Information in paper format will 
be kept in locked files. Electronic data, including MRI images, will be protected by a firewall (programming 
that makes it virtually impossible to access the data from outside the [LOCATION_001] State Psychiatric Institute) 
and by [CONTACT_40440] a password known

(password) setting, they may use our iPod instead. Information stored on the iPod/iPhone app is associated 
with an ID number, and not with participants' names or other identifying information.
The subject’s information will only be available to study research staff and other authorized individuals, 
including those at the [LOCATION_001] State Psychiatric Institute, [LOCATION_001] State and federal regulatory agencies 
such as the Food and Drug Administration who may review records as part of routine audits. There are also 
legal advocacy organizations that have authority under [LOCATION_001] State law to have access to otherwise 
confidential subject records, although they cannot disclose this information without the subject’s consent.
 
The subject’s MRI will be interpreted and the results will be shared with the subject or physician who the 
subject may designate. The MRI report will be maintained as part of the clinical database at the Columbia 
Radiology MRI Center at the Neurological Institute along with the subject’s name [CONTACT_40448]. The subject’s psychiatric diagnosis will not be a part 
of the report.
Will the study be conducted under a certificate of confidentiality?
No

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN  
 
This is a double -blinded, randomized, sham-controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_40389] 
eﬀec:veness of repeated administra:ons of tDCS over right vlPFC in trea:ng NSSI and its 
underlying neural correlates.   Primary analyses on behavior and clinical outcomes will be conducted using linear mixed eﬀects models to account for repeated measures over :me and individual variability. All tests will be performed using two-sided alterna:ves with alpha=0.05. Ecological momentary assessment data will be evaluated using mixed eﬀects logis:c regression. BOLD imaging data will be analyzed using generalized linear models comparing pre - and post - interven:on neural 
responses to inclusion and exclusion trials during the Cyberball game. For all analyses, we will examine standard diagnos:c plots to iden:fy evidence of lack of model ﬁt, presence of outliers or overly inﬂuen:al points, etc., and take appropriate remedies as indicated (e.g., review source data of outliers,  transform data, etc.). 
 As this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], addi:onal exploratory analyses will be conducted for hypothesis genera:ng purposes.

Background , Rationale  and Context  
 
Regional anesthesia investigators have always shown interest in measuring the specific 
duration of neuraxial or peripheral nerve blocks, and how variations in block technique or 
medications affect that duration.  Although ostensibly a simple concept, there are many 
sensory modalities available for block testing (light touch, cold or hot temperature, pain, 
pressure, etc.) and there is no consensus in the anesthesia literature on  how best to 
measure the duration of nerve block (1).  Sensory testing is repetitive, and must be 
practical and consistent.  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_799744], and these 
modalities share the same afferent fibers (C -delta) so there is close overlap in the sensory 
loss mappi[INVESTIGATOR_799745] (2).  With respect to pi[INVESTIGATOR_333686] (3 , 4) there  can 
be variability in the sharpness, pressure, and reproducibility of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_333713].  Testing 
for cold sensation may be more consistent, using a controlled stimulus temperature and 
duration, and there are different methods of testing such as a cooled glass vial  (4) (5℃) or 
Rolltemp  (5) (25℃).  
Cold therapy is a commonly applied modality following strenuous exercise or during 
recovery from extremity surgery, and is expected to reduce tissue damage and relieve 
pain.  There is some evidence of benefit but little consensus  on the optimum interval and 
duration of therapy (6), and there are many approved medical devices available for use.    
This investigation proposes an adaptation of an approved cold therapy device to 
administer automated, periodic cold stimul i at a locatio n made insensate by [CONTACT_799765].  When the patient perceives cold at that site, they will press a stop switch to 
discontinue cooling which will also stop a timer and give an accurate duration of the time 
to sensory recovery at that site.   
The concept w ill be tested by [CONTACT_799766][INVESTIGATOR_799746] -anesthesia care 
unit (PACU) nurses who will use pi[INVESTIGATOR_29107] (toothpi[INVESTIGATOR_9696]) testing of lumbar dermatomes 
every thirty minute s.

Protocol version: 10/13/20  
 
 Main objective :  To test the agreement of standard pi[INVESTIGATOR_29107] (toothpi[INVESTIGATOR_9696]) sensory recovery 
testing after spi[INVESTIGATOR_799747].  
 
 
 
.  
 
 
Methods and Measures  
 
Design  
 
This is an observational series  to determine the agreement of an experimental application 
of an approved medical device designed to test recovery of sensation from spi[INVESTIGATOR_57273], with the customary clinical method of testing recovery from spi[INVESTIGATOR_18227].  
 
Subjects selection criteria  
 
• Inclusion Criteria  
o Patients 18 -75 y/o and scheduled to undergo unilateral primary knee or hip 
arthroplasty under spi[INVESTIGATOR_799748], ropi[INVESTIGATOR_799749] W ake Forest 
Baptist Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_799750]  
• .Exclusion Criteria  
o Exclusions to cold therapy due to medical disease such as Raynaud’s 
disease, Buerger’s  disease, sickle cell disease, significant peripheral 
vascular disease (history of limb vascular  stents or by[CONTACT_6476]), 
hypercoagulable clotting disorders, cold agglutinin disease, history of 
frostbite of the legs, and neuropathy in the lumbar dermatomes under 
investigation.  
o Subject s will be excluded if pre -block sensation is abnormal in the L3 
dermatome  of the non -operative leg , or if spi[INVESTIGATOR_799751].    
o Subjects  will be excluded if sensation has already returned in the L3 
dermatome of the non -operative leg up on arrival to the PACU.   
• Sample Size  
• Sample size calcula tions (see analysis below) predict [ADDRESS_1103183] s will be recruited before their surgical date  in one of two ways.  They may be 
approached at the conclusion of their preoperative assessment clinic (PAC) appointment to

Protocol version: 10/13/[ADDRESS_1103184]’s ability to perceive cold (ice) and pain 
(toothpi[INVESTIGATOR_9696]) will be assessed in the L3 dermatome on the non -operative thigh , and they  will be 
excluded if pre -block sensation is abnormal in the L3 dermatome , They wil l also be excluded if 
decision to use general rather than spi[INVESTIGATOR_799752].  If eligibility is 
confirmed, a  skin location on the non -operative thigh  will be marked  with a circled “X” using 
marking pen after this assessment  to show t he location for the device pad to be applied in PACU.  
Subject s will be shown the cooling device and instructed on how and when to press the “stop” 
button when they feel cold at the application site.    
The patient will then undergo usual anesthesia care wi th preop erative  analgesic and sedative 
medications, peripheral blocks if indicated, spi[INVESTIGATOR_799753].  The 
time of spi[INVESTIGATOR_799754].   Subjects will be excluded at 
this point if spi[INVESTIGATOR_799755] . 
After surgery and upon arrival in PACU, if the subjec t has already recovered sensation at the L3 
dermatome (at the “X”) , they will be excluded from the study  at that time.  If they have not 
recovered sensation, the  device pad will  be wrapped to the non -operative thigh at the “X” 
location by a study team member, and an elastic bandage used to secure the cooling pad to the 
patient.  Cycling will begin with [ADDRESS_1103185] the patient in the lumbar dermatomes (L1 
to L4) every 30 minutes per usual practice (the L3 dermatome will be tested adjacent to the 
cooling pad).  The most cephalad level of p rick sensation with toothpi[INVESTIGATOR_799756].  Cooling pad temperature  during pump cycling  
will be measured  with a wireless sensor , and expected to reach approximately 40 -50 degrees 
Fahrenheit  when cooling (based on in vitro testing), and return towa rd body temperature when 
not cooling ; the range will be recorded on the data sheet. Usual PACU discharge criteria will be 
employed, but it is expected the testing will end when regression of spi[INVESTIGATOR_799757] L3 is 
achieved. Study participation will continue  until the subjec t stops the pump cycling, and is 
expected to continue up to 4  hours.   
 
Outcome Measure(s)  
 
 
• Primary Outcome Measure  
Block Recovery Time :  Time to resolution of spi[INVESTIGATOR_72163]  (minutes from injection) 
will be measured in minutes for (i ) the device and (ii) standard nursing pi[INVESTIGATOR_799758] (n on-operative) thigh.

 Analytical Plan  
 
Time to resolution of spi[INVESTIGATOR_799759] (i) our device and (ii) 
standard nursing pi[INVESTIGATOR_799760] (non-operative) thigh .  We will test the 
equivalence of (i) and (ii), where the equivalence region is defined as the difference in (i) and (ii) 
falling in the interval [ -29, 29] minutes.  In the sample size calculation, it is assumed that time to 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_799761] a mean of 140 minutes (standard deviation 29 minutes) such that we are 
targeting an equivalence region of [ -1, 1] standardized units.  With type 1 error set to 0.05, we 
need 9 pairs of observations to achieve 80% power.  Calculations were perform ed using the R 
package ‘TOSTER ’.   
To test equivalence of the measurements in real data, the same procedure of “two one -sided 
tests” will be employed, with t -tests of the one -sided hypotheses that the null difference is less 
than -[ADDRESS_1103186] Recruitment Methods  
 
Study team members (Anesthesiology Faculty) will be providing the anesthesia care for patients 
undergoing hip and knee arthroplasty and routinely review cl inical information in the day s 
before surgery to prepare for this care.   They will identify eligible patients as a part of this 
review and let the clinical research staff know of potential subject  recruitment .   Patients meeting 
eligibility requirements w ill be recruited before their surgical date in one of two ways.  They 
may be approached at the conclusion of their preoperative assessment clinic (PAC) appointment 
to review the study and consent form.  If not approached at the PAC visit, they may be conta cted 
by [CONTACT_799767] “interactions” using a telephone script 
to introduce the study, review exclusion criteria and determine interest.  If interested, patients 
will have questions answered and later complete a writ ten informed consent  in the preoperative 
holding area on the day of surgery.  Patients will NOT be recruited on the day of surgery if they 
have not already been contact[CONTACT_799768] .  
 
 
Informed Consent  
 
Signed  informed consent will be obtained from each subject .   
 
Confidentiality and Privacy  
 
Confidentiality will be protected by [CONTACT_21176], minimizing to the fullest extent possible the collection of any informat ion that could 
directly identify subjects, and maintaining  all study information in a secure manner .  To help 
ensure subject privacy and confidentiality, only a unique study identifier will appear on the data 
collection form.  Any collected p atient identif ying information corresponding to the unique study

Study Objective  
We will establish accuracy and precision data for the lifespan (up to about 3 months) of the 
Dexcom G6 transmitter exposed to inpatient radiation (x -ray and/or CT scan) that is not covered 
with lead apron.  
Background  
There are limited data published regarding the accuracy and precision of continuous glucose 
monitoring (CGM) devices after radiation exposure. While manufacturers, specifically Dexcom, 
recommend to remove CGM systems with MRI and CT scan there is some ambi guity 
surrounding radiation exposure from a diagnostic x -ray as only a few cross -sectional studies 
have been conducted [1]. Spanakis et al assessed the accuracy and precision of Dexcom two 
hours pre- and post -imaging. They reported that ongoing CGM use dur ing multiple radiology 
procedures was safe and reliable based on 98.1% of glucoses falling into Zone A and B of Clark 
Error Grid analysis which represents values that result in no difference in clinical decision 
making. However, this analysis did not asses s the transmitter longitudinally to ensure accuracy 
over its 3 -month lifespan. A second report, based on simulation of a radiotherapeutic procedure 
(80 GY) found that the components of G6 retained basic functionality and data integrity after 
exposure and a gain did not include assessment of the transmitters 3-month  lifespan.  
At CCHMC, we are in the unique position to work with a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_597870] G6 CGMs while inpatient. The patients are children and adolescents who have had a 
total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation (TPI[CONTACT_50182]) and receive, on average, 6 radiology 
procedures (defined as CT scans or x -rays) over a 2 -week period following TPI[CONTACT_50182]. This 
population has a target glucose range of 80 -120 mg/dL and Dexcom is used to monitor trends 
under careful oversight by [CONTACT_597887]. Because these patients 
represent a complex surgical population, they often have post -operative events that include 
abdominal pain, vomiting, and fever. Radiology procedures are frequently obtained for 
 
Page 5 of 12  Version 3.0  20Jul2022  assessment of obstruction, abscesses and/or thrombi. At our institution if the sensor and 
transmitter is not in the field of interest, current practice is to cover the Dexcom (sensor and 
transmitter) during all radiology procedures with a lead apron and ha ve careful assessment of 
sensor values compared to glucometer glucose readings while in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_597871] [ADDRESS_790678]-operatively. The repeated radiation exposure over a short timeframe (2 -3 weeks) in the 
context of established monitoring of device perfor mance by [CONTACT_597888]. A transmitter 
is changed every [ADDRESS_790679] -TPI[INVESTIGATOR_597872].  
Study End Points :  
CGM readings will be assessed for accuracy and precision.  Publicly available accuracy data 
will be compared to study glucometer readings over the [ADDRESS_790680] device life expectancy.  
We will take the following into consideration with our analysis:  
Hydroxyurea a known substance to interfere with CGM sensor values is started approximately 
day [ADDRESS_790681] -
administration [2]. For this reason, data from [ADDRESS_790682] Hydroxyurea dosing will not be used 
in the initial data analysis.  
Study Intervention : 
Enrolled participants will NOT have a lead apron used to cover their Dexcom G6 transmitter 
during radiation exposure procedures performed while participant is inpatient post TPI[CONTACT_50182].  
Transmitter accuracy and precision will be monitored for [ADDRESS_790683] TPI[INVESTIGATOR_597873].   
Study Procedures:  
Our main goal is to assess the accuracy and precision of the Dexcom G6 transmitter readings 
after radiation exposing SOC procedures for which the transmitter is uncovered compared to 
publicly available accuracy data. Transmitter function will be assessed b y comparing the device 
readings to glucometer readings.  
Patients undergoing a TPI[INVESTIGATOR_597874] a Dexcom G6 CGM will be approached for 
participation in this study prior to post surgery CGM placement.  
 
Page [ADDRESS_790684] TPI[CONTACT_50182].  
Dexcom G6 CGM data and point of care (POC) testing with a glucometer (such as the ACCU -
CHEK® Inform II Meter) will be utilized for this study while inpatient and a standard issue meter 
when outpatient. While participants are inpatient POC monitoring will o ccur every 1 hour when 
insulin administration is administered intravenous and every 3 hours with the transition to 
subcutaneous insulin administration. Inpatient POC glucose values and Dexcom reports will be 
collected. Once discharged, CGM and glucometer r eadings will be collected by [CONTACT_597889] 1 (+/ -3 days) week post discharge clinic visit,1 month (+/ - 7 days) 
post TPI[CONTACT_50182], 2 months (+/ - 7 days) post TPI[INVESTIGATOR_597875] 
(expected 3 months (+/ - 7 days) post TPI[CONTACT_50182]).   
The Dexcom CGM has an online platform called Clarity that can generate reports or raw data 
files of continuous glucose readings.  The home glucometer  used for the study  has a mobile app 
that can generate reports or raw data files of glucometer readings. Reports will be reviewed at 
the time of set data download time points by [CONTACT_597890].  
Downloaded data will be stored on a secure server utilizing the participants study ID.  
Participants will be requested to check their glucose values with the Contour glucometer  4 times 
a day for the ten days leading up to study data requests at study time points, but we will accept 
a minim um of 2 times  per day the 7 days  prior to a scheduled download to compare the 
functionality of the Dexcom G6 CGM.  Participants (or parents) will be contact[CONTACT_597891] 10-day period at each time point.  
While participant is inpatient post TPI[INVESTIGATOR_597876] , the 
number of and type of radiation procedure will be collected from their EMR.  
After discharge participants will be contact[CONTACT_38696] 1 (+/ -3 days) week post discharge clinic 
visit, 1 month (+/ - 7 days) post TPI[CONTACT_50182], 2 months (+/ - 7 days) post TPI[INVESTIGATOR_597877] (expected [ADDRESS_790685] TPI[CONTACT_50182]). Particip ants will be asked to 
provide information on any radiation procedures that may have occurred outside of CCHMC, 
and study staff will confirm the transmitter has not yet been changed. If at any point the 
transmitter is changed for any reason, the participant  will no longer be actively enrolled in the 
study but data for the transmitte r will be collected. If the transmitter is changed due to  clinical 
recommendations such as due to  technical issues with readings or calibrations or due to 
radiologic procedures in which it is in the field of interest, they will be considered completed in 
the study. If the transmitter is changed due to participant preference with no reason to believe 
the transmitter was not working properly or needed to be removed for clinical proce dures then 
the participant will be withdrawn. Any termination of participation prior to the anticipated 
approximately [ADDRESS_790686] TPI[INVESTIGATOR_597878]/withdraw recorded.  
Formal statistical analysis will assess accuracy of the Dexcom transmitter between the publicly 
available accuracy data and the enrolled participant data. Performance evaluation will include 
the proportion of CGM values within +/ -20% of the reference (POC)  glucose values > 100 mg/dL 
or within +/ -20 mg/dL of reference glucose values < 100 mg/dL (%20/20), the analogous 
%15/15, and the mean absolute relative difference (MARD, expressed as a percentage) 
 
Page 7 of 12  Version 3.0  20Jul2022  between temporally matched CGM and reference values (Wadwa et al. Diabetes technology & 
Therapeutics. 20:6 2018).  
Data and Specimen Banking   
De-identified data will be retained for future potential research or FDA submission. No 
specimens will be collected for this study.  
Sharing of Results with Participants   
Study participants will be informed immediately if the Dexcom G6 CGM that they are utilizing is 
malfunctioning. Additionally, after final analysis participants will be informed of the result of the 
study by a study team member. This information will be com municated to the participants 
verbally or by [CONTACT_597892]’s preference.   
Study Timelines  
The study will commence after Dexcom Company and local IRB approval. In addition, support of 
a study coordinator will be required to assist with IRB submission, obtaining consent and 
insuring protocol procedures both inpatient and outpatient. Proposed star t winter 2021. CCHMC 
performs 1 -2 TPI[INVESTIGATOR_597879] a 15 -19 month 
period.  
Inclusion and exclusion criteria:   
Inclusion Criteria: planned TPI[INVESTIGATOR_597880], staying inpatient at CCHMC post TPI[CONTACT_50182], planned 
to receive a Dexcom G6 CGM.  
Exclusion criteria: hemo - or peritoneal dialysis.  
Vulnerable populations:  
Individuals who are not yet adults will be permitted to participate in the study following 
written informed consent and assent (if aged 11 -17) with said individual and their 
parent/guardian.  
Legal guardians unable to provide consent for their child to participate in the study will 
not be enrolled.  
This study will involve participants that are children and potentially participants that are 
mentally impaired. To ensure that their rights and welfare are protected we will:  
o Make adequate provisions for soliciting assent from children [ADDRESS_790687] -TPI[INVESTIGATOR_597881]’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_597882] G6 
as standard of care and are under the careful surveillance of pediatric endocrinology.  
 
Page 8 of 12  Version 3.0  20Jul2022  Participants will be enrolled  and assign ed into the exposure group . 
CONTROL GROUP: Publicly available accuracy data from Dexcom  
EXPOSURE GROUP: patients who will NOT have the CGM covered during radiologic 
procedures involving x -rays.  
Standard of care at CCHMC is that sensor values do not replace point of care (POC) testing 
with a glucometer (such as the ACCU -CHEK® Inform II Meter)  while inpatient . POC monitoring 
will occur every [ADDRESS_790688] comparison data at our study time points.  
The following data will be collected during the life of the transmitter (approximately 3 months 
after placement):  
• POC glucose values (from inpatient and outpatient glucometers)  
• Dexcom CGM Clarity reports (inpatient and outpatient)  
• Timing of interfering substances (hydroxyurea)  
• Dates of clinically indicated x -rays and CT scans and radiation exposures (RADS) to 
radiation field of interest  
• Indication for radiologic testing (nausea, vomiting, fever, pain, etc)  
• Documentation of apron use during radiologic assessment  
The G6 transmitter will  be issue d while inpatient and be sent home with the families at 
discharge. Assessment of Dexcom reports compared to POC and home monitoring will be 
collected at 1 (+/ -3 days) week post discharge clinic visit, 1 month (+/ - 7 days) post TPI[CONTACT_50182], 2 
months (+/ - 7 days) post TPI[INVESTIGATOR_597883] (expected [ADDRESS_790689] TPI[CONTACT_50182]).  
Two endocrine providers will perform the clinical assessment of the outpatient reports of 
glucometer and CGM. Formal analysis will be completed after 3 months of transmitter data is 
collected.  
Statistical Consideration  
Several accuracy methods will be ascertained. The %20/20 and%15/15 will be assessed from 
the participant’s medical record for both inpatient and outpatient settings will be reviewed. In 
addition, use of Clark Error Grid Analysis will be performed on data p oints collected after 10 
hours of hydroxyurea dosing.  
Recruitment  
Recruitment will occur at Cincinnati Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29349] (CCHMC) or by [CONTACT_597893]. The recruitment goal is to recruit [ADDRESS_790690] TPI[CONTACT_50182]. Potential participants will be approached about the study after TPI[INVESTIGATOR_597884].  CCHMC is projected to perform 1 -2 TPI[INVESTIGATOR_597885] (12 -24 patient per 
 
Page 9 of 12  Version 3.0  20Jul2022  year). The primary recruitment strategy would consist of in -person invitation by [CONTACT_597894]. Secondary recruitment strategies may include introduction letters sent by [CONTACT_597895]. Recruitment phone calls may result in performin g eConsent following proper 
CCHMC eConsent process.   
Withdrawal of Subjects  
Participants will be withdrawn from the study if any of the following become true:  
Participant no longer wishes to remain in the study,  
Participant has moderate to severe skin inflammation from adhesive,  
Participants that cannot provide [ADDRESS_790691], radiation exposure is thought to be 
minimal/scatter and we have not documented any inaccuracy in transmitter readings (clinical 
experience, unpublished). This proposal will request that participants leave their CGM and 
transmitter uncove red during radiologic procedures. The families are instructed to monitor POC 
glucoses values every [ADDRESS_790692] demographic information (such as 
age, gender, BMI), radiologic studies performed (type and procedure da ta) and date of 
operation and date of discharge. Study data will be stored on a secure sever.  
Collected data will be kept confidential and will only be shared with authorized study staff.  
Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects . 
Adverse event monitoring: No surgery related complications will be tracked for this study, only 
events relating to the function of the study CGM will be collected.  
Monitoring and auditing procedures will be followed to ensure that the study is conducted, 
documented, and reported in accordance with the IRB approved protocol, the International 
Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines, a nd applicable 
regulatory requirements of Cincinnati Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29349].  
 
An independent medical monitor will assess the progress of this clinical study, the safety data, 
critical efficacy endpoints and provide recommendations to study personnel annually.  
Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects  
Participant data are password protected with restricted access to only qualified personnel 
involved in this research study. Documents and records are kept under lock and key in the 
Division of Endocrinology. Only the Principal Investigator (PI) and designe es will have access to 
the participant information.  
 
Participants will be encouraged to ask questions about the research and will be well informed 
about the procedures that are happening. Participants will also be reminded that they have the 
right to withdraw from the study at any time.  
 
Compensation for Research -Related Injury  
No compensation will be provided; no research related injuries are anticipated.  
 
Economic Burden to Subjects  
Subjects will be responsible for all standard of care treatments and pharmaceutical costs. Study 
will provide a Dexcom G6 sensor and transmitter. If the study transmitter fails prior to the end of 
the 3 -month (90 day) sensor life expectancy, a replacement transmitter will be provided. 
Patients who are not using a Glucometer  approved by [CONTACT_597896].  
 
Participants will be compensated $50.[ADDRESS_790693]  if minimum 
requested study procedures are followed. If participants remove their CGM early due to 
preference (not transmitter failure or for clinical reasons)  or fail to provide the minimum 
requested glucometer readings,  they will receive a prorated amount.  
 
All participants who participate to some extent will receive $[ADDRESS_790694] discharge  
timepoint  or study withdrawal (if prior to discharge), participants will get an additional $10 at the 
1-month and 2 -month time points for completing the minimum requirements, and a final $15 at 
 
Page 11 of 12  Version 3.0  20Jul2022  the 3 -month timepoint for completing the minimum requirements.  If participation is ended early 
for clinical reasons (such as transmitter failure or a procedure requires the removal of the 
device) then participants will receive the full $[ADDRESS_790695] by [CONTACT_20750]: in -person paper consent, in-person electronic 
consent (using REDCap for the eConsent) or over the phone (via paper or REDCap for 
eConsent). The eConsent form has been developed in CCHMC’s REDCap, a secure, web -
based, HIPAA -compliant, data collection platform with a user management  system allowing 
project owners to grant and control varying levels of access to data collection instruments and 
data (e.g. read only, de -identified -only data views) for other users.  Participants and/or 
Parents/LAR of potential participants will participa te in the consent/assent process (based on 
age and CCHMC guidelines) by [CONTACT_597897] -person at a participating institution 
or remotely via telephone/video call/telehealth application and accessing the REDCap survey 
electronically on personal portable electronic devices. During the consent/assent process, 
participants and/or parents/LAR will be consented by a member of the key study personnel, 
either in -person or remotely through telephone/video call/telehealth application. Participant 
and/or p arent/LAR signatures will be obtained using a written signature, either on the paper 
form or directly through REDCap. Upon completion of the consenting process, a copy of the 
consent form will either be given to the participant and/or parents/LAR in paper form or emailed 
to them via REDCap, depending on the method used to complete the consenting process. In all 
cases, the consent process will be documented in an informed consent process note and a copy 
of the signed consent(s) will be kept in the patient’s electronic medical record. Signed eConsent 
documents will be housed electronically in REDCap’s File Repository.  
No study procedures will be performed until consent/assent has been obtained.  
Available Resources  
Potential patients will be recruited through established databases. CCHMC performs 
approximately [ADDRESS_790696] had consent rates near 100%. Thus, we 
anticipate being able to recruit [ADDRESS_790697] or a 
certified nurse practitioner.  
 
A statistician is available to assists with the final data analysis.

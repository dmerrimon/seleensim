 Ethnic Differences in Antihypertensive Medication Response among Pregnant and Postpartum Patients  Dyese Taylor, MD  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  11/[ADDRESS_333099] receive IV labetalol or oral nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_272523]. The protocol used for medication administration was the same as the ACOG protocol for treatment of acute hypertension in pregnancy (See medication specific protocol below). Blood pressure for all women in the study was taken in the right arm with an automated blood pressure cuff while the patient was resting in bed in the semi-recumbent position. The systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure was recorded before and after administration of each medication. A short survey to assess patient-reported side effects were provided prior to and post medication administration.  IV Labetalol protocol Labetalol 20mg IV was given over 2 minutes and the systolic and diastolic blood pressures were recorded 10 minutes after the medication was given. If SBP was ≥160mmHg or DBP was ≥110mmHg, labetalol 40mg IV was given over 2 minutes and the systolic and diastolic blood pressures were recorded 10 minutes after the medication was given. If SBP was ≥160mmHg or DBP was ≥110mmHg, labetalol 80mg IV was given over 2 minutes and the systolic and diastolic blood pressures were recorded 10 minutes after the medication was given. If SBP was ≥160mmHg or DBP was ≥110mmHg, then another medication was chosen based on institution specific protocol. (ACOG Safe Motherhood Initiative)  Oral nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_272524] 10mg oral was given and the systolic and diastolic blood pressures were recorded 20 minutes after the medication was given. If SBP was ≥160mmHg or DBP was ≥110mmHg, 
nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 20mg oral was given and the systolic and diastolic blood pressures were recorded 20 minutes after medication was given. If SBP is ≥160mmHg or DBP is ≥110mmHg, nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 20mg oral was given and the systolic and diastolic blood pressures were recorded 20 minutes after medication was given. If SBP was ≥160mmHg or DBP was ≥110mmHg, then another medication was chosen based on institution specific protocol. (ACOG Safe Motherhood Initiative)  Statistical Analysis In the following sample size calculation, our primary aim is to detect an interaction effect between race and hypertensive treatment on time to reach goal blood pressure. We assume that the race distribution would be 20% for African Americans and 80% for Caucasians or Asians entering the clinic during the trial enrollment period. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_272525] a 1:[ADDRESS_333100] 85% with an alpha of 0.05.  Based on the above, we used a simulation approach to estimate that we would need a total of [ADDRESS_333101] 85% power to detect an interaction effect between race and hypertensive treatment.

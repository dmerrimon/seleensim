CONFIDENTIAL Page 8 16 October 2017  1. INTRODUCTION 
 
This Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) is developed to guide the details of the statistical analysis method of the 
phase [ADDRESS_840084] characteristics and the efficacy and 
safety endpoints, as well as the specific statistical analysis methods to be performed. 
 
2. STUDY OBJECTIVE(S) 
 
2.1  Primary Objective 
 
The primary objective is to assess the dose-dependent efficacy of Cyclo-Z for the treatment of subjects with 
obese type 2 diabetes. 
 
2.2  Secondary Objective 
 
The secondary objective is to assess the safety of Cyclo-Z in the treatment of subjects with obese type 2 
diabetes. 
 
3. STUDY OVERVIEW  
 
3.1  Study Design 
3.1.1 Overall Study Design 
 
This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group comparison study to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of Cyclo-Z vs. placebo in adult subjects with obese type 2 diabetes. Up to four sites may 
be utilized in the [LOCATION_002] so that a total of 80 subjects (a potential 20% screening failure rate) may be 
screened for total 16-week study period (2 weeks for screening, 12 weeks for treatment, and 2 weeks for 
safety follow-up). 
 
Subjects who meet preliminary inclusion and exclusion criteria at Screening will undergo a 2-week 
assessment period of record-keepi[INVESTIGATOR_629844]. Subjects will be asked to record daily blood glucose values 
(fasting before breakfast and two hours after dinner) and study medication adherence throughout study 
participation. 
 
Sixty-four (64) qualified subjects will be assigned randomly to either the placebo arm or to one of the three 
treatment groups requiring the oral intake of a single gel capsule of Cyclo-Z or placebo once daily before 
bedtime for 12 consecutive weeks. 
 
Refer to the schedule of assessment of Section 3.1.2  for a display of all assessments to be conducted. All 
visits are to be scheduled according to their time from the randomization visit (Visit 2).

3.3 Sample Size Considerations 
 
This is a Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate safety and explore the potential efficacy of the study drug. Therefore, 
the number of subjects was not based on formal statistical power considerations. In this clinical trial, a total of 
64 subjects was deemed sufficient and will be enrolled and randomly assigned to be administered with 1 of 3 
dose levels of Cyclo-Z or placebo. 
 
3.4 Randomization and Blinding 
3.4.1 Randomization  
 
At Visit 2 (Week 0), subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to receive 
placebo or 1 of 3 doses of Cyclo-Z in accordance with the randomization code, which will be generated by 
[CONTACT_629855]-statistics associate (BSA) at Medihelpline rather than the BSA in charge. Specifically, the subjects 
will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to the following: 
 
• Dose A: Cyclo-Z containing 23 mg zinc plus 3 mg CHP – 16 subjects 
• Dose B
: Cyclo-Z containing 23 mg zinc plus 9 mg CHP – 16 subjects 
• Dose C
: Cyclo-Z containing 23 mg zinc plus 15 mg CHP – 16 subjects 
• Dose D
: Placebo – [ADDRESS_840094] be discontinued; a written explanation on the relevant form must be prepared immediately. 
 
4. STUDY ENDPOINTS AND COVARIATES

7. ANALYSIS SUBSETS 
 
This study is planned to analy ze in analysis subsets of four groups : Full Analysis Set , Efficacy Analysis Set , 
Per Protocol Set, and Safety Analysis Set. For efficacy analysis, the Efficacy Analysis Set will be considered 
primar ily and the Per Protocol Set will be considered as supportive. The Safety Analysis Set will be used in 
the safety analysis. 
 
7.1 Full Analysis Set  
 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) includes all subjects who were randomized in the study. Subjects will be 
analyzed according to their randomized treatment, regardless of the treatment received. Tabulations of subject 
NovMetaPharma Co., Ltd. 
NMP- CYZ -P2-[ADDRESS_840097] and present medical history, concomitant medication, and protocol deviations including 
major protocol deviations will utilize this analysis set. 
 
7.2 Efficacy Analysis Set  
 
The Efficacy Analysis Set (EAS) will be used to carry out the efficacy analyses of efficacy endpoints, which 
is a subset of the FAS consisting of subjects who received at least one dose of study medication and who had 
baseline and any post-baseline efficacy data. Subjects will be analyzed according to their randomized 
treatment, regardless of the treatment received. Analyses for efficacy endpoints will utilize this analysis set. 
  
7.3 Per Pr
otocol Set  
 
All subjects valid for EAS who meet ALL the following criteria will be „valid per protocol‟ (also called „valid 
for efficacy‟): 
 
• Complete at least 2 weeks of treatment after randomization. 
• Have both baseline and at least 2 weeks of efficacy data. 
• Subject did not have any significant violation after randomization. 
 
Major protocol deviations that will potentially impact the primary analysis of efficacy endpoints at Week12 or 
violate GCP at site will be discussed and decided prior to the database lock and will be applied in per protocol 
analysis: 
 
The following cases  are excluded from the P er Protocol Set : 
 
• Informed consent was not provided 
• Subjects who were withdrawn/early terminated 
• Subjects who have not met inclusion/exclusion criteria 
• Subjects who received excluded concomitant medications 
• Subjects who have major protocol deviations - all protocol deviations will be classified as major or minor 
under the discussion with Sponsor before database is locked. 
 
Additional criteria maybe added prior to unblinding of the study database.  
 
The Per Protocol Set will be used to perform the sensitivity analysis on the primary, the secondary, and

9. DATA SCREENING AND ACCPETANCE 
 
9.1 General Principles 
 
The objective of data screening is to assess the quantity, quality, and statistical characteristics of the data 
relative to the requirements of the planned analyses. The Bio-statistics associate (BSA) who is in charge of 
this study will check errors of raw data prior to the beginning of data analysis.  
 
9.2 Data Handling and Electronic Transfer of Data 
 
After database is locked, a raw data validated by [CONTACT_629857] (MsSQL) will 
be directly accessed using SAS Open Database Connectivity ( ODBC ) Driver. The raw data needed for 
analysis will be transferred from Database Management System (DBMS) to standard folder to store the raw 
data on the server via SAS ODBC, and the analysis dataset will be created in „DATASET‟ folder. The 
analysis dataset will be generated using SAS software version 9.[ADDRESS_840099] (LOCF) method. 
 
9.3.1 Missing and Incomplete Dates 
 
Missing or incomplete dates will be listed as it is in any listings. 
 
Incomplete start date of an adverse event or concomitant medication taken will be handled by [CONTACT_629858]:

Each case will be discussed and decided with the study team and will be documented in the analysis dataset 
specification. 
 
9.5 Outliers Detection 
 
Histograms or raw data review will be examined to identify outliers in any of the continuous variables used in 
the analyses. Unexpected and/or unexplained values in categorical data will be identified by [CONTACT_629859]. 
 
Outliers due to data entry errors will be corrected by [CONTACT_629860]. The validity of 
any questionable values or outliers will be confirmed. Outliers or any questionable values with confirmed 
validity will be included in the analyses. However, ad-hoc sensitivity analyses may be conducted to evaluate 
the influence of extreme values in the data.   If it is deemed necessary after the team reviews the output from 
the planned analyses after the database lock, post-hoc analyses excluding subjects with outliers may be 
performed.

CONFIDENTIAL Page 19 16 October 2017  9.6 Bias Detection 
 
Randomization and blinding are performed for avoiding bias in this phase 2 study. Major protocol deviations 
will be listed and or/tabulated in the clinical study report (CSR). Any breaking of the blind for individual 
subjects prior to unblinding of the study will be documented in the CSR. The timing of and reasons for 
premature withdrawal from treatment and from study will be tabulated and /or listed. 
 
9.7 Distributional Characteristics 
 
Continuous endpoints of change from baseline value will be analyzed under normality assumption. If they 
deviate appreciably from normality, then appropriate non-parametric alternatives will be considered. 
 
9.8 Validation of Statistical Analyses 
 
The procedure for the validation of the analysis result is as follows: 
 
1) Self-check: The BSA in charge will check for oneself that the SAS program code, output, execution log, 
etc. are written correctly. 
2) Double programming and the review: The BSA in charge and other BSA will write SAS program code 
independently, and the Bio-statistics manager (BSM; Reviewer) will compare the outputs such as table, 
graph, listing that are printed by [CONTACT_629861]. 
3) Source code check: The BSM will check the written source code visually, and will check whether it is 
properly processed according to its purpose. 
4) Table/Graph: The BSM will check the values displayed in tables and graphs. 
5) Listing/Raw data: The BSM will check whether the raw data and listing are the same or not.

• Change in TAFGC from baseline at Week 12 
• Change in BMI from baseline at Week [ADDRESS_840134] been added for Baseline, Study Day. The definitions are as follows: 
 
Baseline  is defined as the last non-missing measurement taken on Week 0.  
 
Study day [ADDRESS_840135] IP dose date. For subjects who are randomized but not dosed after 
randomization, the study day 1 is defined as the date of randomization. 
 
Study day  is defined as the number of days from study day 1. 
 
Before study day 1:  study day = (date of interest – date of study day 1) 
On or a
fter study day 1:  study day = (date of interest – date of study day 1) + 1 
 
Therefore, the day prior to study day 1 is -1. 
 
Section 7.1  Full Analysis Set has been added. The definition of FAS is as follows:  
 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) includes all subjects who were randomized in the study. Subjects will be 
analyzed according to their randomized treatment, regardless of the treatment received. Tabulations of subject 
enrollment by [CONTACT_3725], analysis subsets, demographic and baseline characteristics including diabetes disease, past 
and present medical history, concomitant medication, subject disposition, and major protocol deviations will 
utilize this analysis set. 
 
Section 7.2  Efficacy Analysis Set has been replaced with Intent- to-Treat Set. The updated definition of EAS 
is as follows:  
 
The Efficacy Analysis Set (EAS) will be used to carry out the efficacy analyses of efficacy endpoints, which 
is a subset of the FAS consisting of subjects who received at least one dose of study medication and who had 
baseline and any post-baseline efficacy data. Subjects will be analyzed according to their randomized 
treatment, regardless of the treatment received. Analyses for efficacy endpoints will utilize this analysis set.  
 
NovMetaPharma Co., Ltd. 
NMP- CYZ -P2-[ADDRESS_840136] data has been added in detail. 
The details are as follows: 
 
Only participants whose efficacy variable were measured least once after baseline. If participants either 
discontinues from the clinical trial or the outcome measurement at any point is missing, then the missing data 
will be imputed from the last measured outcome value using the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) 
method. 
 
If repeated laboratory test data collected is due to a test error, then the last value of the visit will be used, and 
if a clinical opi[INVESTIGATOR_629852], then it will be used one value determined under discussion. 
 
No imputation methods are planned for safety analysis. 
 
Section 9.4  Handling of Early Termination has been added in detail. The details are as follows:  
 
In order to analyze and summarize the data consistently, the last visit performed for Early Termination will be 
mapped to their closest to scheduled visit within the analysis dataset. See Section 9.4 of this SAP to see more 
examples in detail.

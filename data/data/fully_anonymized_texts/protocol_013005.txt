1.0 INTRODUCTION  
From a market research study (Van Gogh ; 2013 ) – the results showed that User’s perception could not differentiate 
BD pen  needles from other competitors.  Therefore, the pen needle market is currently being driven primarily by 
[CONTACT_225437]. This study will be used  to support the business replacement strategy for BD’s  current 4mm  pen n eedle. A 
design improvement is being implemented by [CONTACT_2359]  a flatter hub  (base) by [CONTACT_225438] . 
This study is designed to assess the  User ’s experience and preference and outcomes are intended to be used for 
marketing claims.   This study will have four study groups based on  commer cially available 32G pen needle group s:  
1) BD Nano, 2) NovoFine, 3) NovoFine Plus & NovoTwist and 4)  Other 32G (such as UltiMed, MHC, or other 
private label) . 
2.0 OBJECTIVES  
2.1 Primary  Objectives  
For all study groups combined , compare user preference for the BD Nucleus pen needle vs. current 
commercially available pen needle s. 
2.2 Secondary Objectives  
For each individual study group, compare user preference for the BD Nucleus pen needle vs. current 
commercially available pen needle s. 
For all study groups combined and each individual study group , compare the user experience with the BD 
Nucleus pen needle and the commercially available pen needle s for component preference . 
a. Outer Cover Handling  
b. Inner Shield Handling

A sub -group with Asian ethnicity , all study groups combined,  will also be evaluated for the 
objectives listed in the Primary and Secondary Objectives.  
3.0 STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 Overall Study D esign  
This is a multi -site, prospective, open -label, randomized, 2 -period crossover (15 days per period) study 
comparing commercially available 32G pen needle s to the BD Nucleus pen needle. Nucleus pen need le will 
be compared to four groups  of pen needles: 1) BD Nano  (32Gx4mm) , 2) NovoFin e (32Gx6mm) , 3) 
NovoFine Plus  (32Gx4mm) & NovoTwist  (32Gx5mm) and 4)  Other 32G (such as UltiMed, MHC, or other 
private label).  Approximately 25% of the subjects are expected to be Type 1 patients and the remaining 
75% are expected to be Type [ADDRESS_271025] comes in using the BD Nano, 
they will be enrolled in Group 1.  If their current pen needle group has completed enrollment, they will be 
eligible for wash -in (see below).  
To facilitate recruitment, a  14 day wash -in period will be allowed in the following situations:  
 As BD holds the vast majority of the Pen needle market share in the US , enrolling subjects using non 
BD brands will be difficult.   Subject’s currently using a 32 G pen needle of 4, 5 or 6 mm lengths  will 
be allowed to wash-in if their current pen needle group has completed enrollment of 60 evaluable 
subjects. These subjects will be eligible to wash -in to the next available applicable group, per the Wash -
In randomization schedule. The length of their current pen needle will be maintained.  
 For subject’s currently using a 31G pen needle of 4, [ADDRESS_271026] is willing 
to switch to an assigned commercially available  32G pen needle for the duration of the study.  These 
subjects will be eligible to wash -in to an available applicable group, per the Wash -In randomization 
schedule. The length of their current pen needle will be maintained.  
 
Wash -in subjects will be random ized as follows : 
 If subject is currently on a 31G x 4mm or 32G x 4mm they will get randomized to either 
Group 3 (Novo Fine Plus (32Gx4mm) or Group 4 ( UltiCare Micro 32Gx4mm ). 
 If subject is currently on a 31G x 5mm or 32G x 5mm, they will randomized to eith er Group 
3 (NovoTwist (32Gx5mm)) or Group 4 (MHC Easy Touch 5mm x 32G).  
 If subject is currently on a 31G x 6mm or 32G x 6mm, they will randomized to either Group 
2 (Novo Fine   (32Gx6mm)) or Group 4 (Simple Diagnostics Comfort EZ 6mm x 32G) . 
Please refer to  the Wash-in randomization schedule.  
 
Subject s who will remain on their current 32G pen needle will be required to visit the site a total of three  
times. Wash -in subjects  will have an additional visit (Wash -in Visit) for a total of 4 visits. (see Subject  
Flow  Chart  Diagram 1 ).

Version:  5.[ADDRESS_271027] of two 15 day periods  (+/- 3 days, no fewer than 13 days and no more than 17 days)  
in which the subject will use each pen needle ( BD Nucleus  pen needle  or Commercially  available 32G pen 
needle , order randomized ) for injec tion. 
Results will be compared to address the Primary, Secondary and Exploratory objectives.  A final report will 
be issued summarizing all outcomes and conclusions.

3.2 Specification of Study Endpoints  
3.2.1 Primar y Endpoints  
Preference:  At the end of the last study period , each subject will be ask ed to evaluate his or her 
perception using a 150mm relative VAS scale.  The question “Which pen needle did you prefer  
overall?” will be asked. The far left ( -75mm) of the scale will be labelled “Period 1 pen needle was 
strongly preferred overall”. The 0mm center point will be labelled “No Preference”. The far right 
(+75mm) of the scale will be labelled “Period 2 pen need le was strongly  preferred overall”.  
 
 
 
3.2.[ADDRESS_271029] study period : Each subject will be ask ed to evaluate his or her perception using a 
150mm relative VAS scale  for each of the following endpoints:  Overall Comfort, Anxiety  Associated with 
a Needle Stick Injury , Injection Pain, and Ease of Use.  
 
 
After each injection : Additional secondary endpoints information will be collected for Bruising, 
Needle Bending /Breaking  and Leakage in the Subject Diary.  
 
For Needle Breaking, Bending or Injection Site Bleeding  or Bruising , each subject will evaluate 
his/her perception of each by [CONTACT_225439] a yes or no response.  
For needle l eakage , each subject will record leakage using the following scale  (0-5): 
[ADDRESS_271030] will evaluate his or her perception of each of the following by 
[CONTACT_225439] a yes or no response.  
Teardrop Label Removal Force : The subject will be asked “Did you find the teardrop label  easy to 
remove? ” The response options will either be Yes or No.  
 
Outer Cover Removal Force : The subject will be asked “Did you find the outer cover easy to 
remove ?” The response options will either be Yes or No.  
 
Inner Shield Removal Force:  The subject will be asked “Did you find t the inner shield easy to 
remove ?” The response options will eith er be Yes or No.  
 
Period 1 pen needle was 
strongly preferred overall  No Preference  Period 2 pen needle was 
strongly preferred overall

Ease of Insulin /Non -insulin  Delivery:  The subject will be asked “Were you able to deliver the 
insulin /non-insulin  easily?” The response options will either be Yes or No.  
3.2.[ADDRESS_271031] of survey questions, please refer to “Form: Questionnaire”.  
3.3 Acceptance Criteria  
Primary Objective:  Non-Inferiority Criteri on (based on relative VAS where -75mm i ndicates a strong 
prefer ence for Period 1 pen needle and +75mm i ndicates a  strong prefer ence for Period 2 pen needle ) is -
10mm .    
Secondary Objectives:   
For Overall Comfort, Anxiety  Associated with a Needle Stick Injury , Injection Pain, and Ease of Use the 
Non-Inferiority Criterion is also -10mm.    
For Needle Breaking, Needle Bending , Injection Site Bleeding , Bruising  and Leakage Score > 1 : The 
difference in o ccurrence rate with BD Nucleus pen needle vs  Occurrence rate with Current pen needle will 
be compared to a 4% non -inferiority (NI) criteria.   
Exploratory Objectives: No formal acceptance criteria has been established for this study.  
3.4 Treatment Allocation and Methods to Reduce Bias  
The order of the pen needle type (current vs. Nucleus) will be randomized for each subject.  There will be 
no masking or blinding in this study .

4.0 STUDY POPULATION  
Approximately 260 subjects that are currently injecting , using a pen injector and pen needle:  
o Insulin only  
o Non-insulin injectable only (a minimum of once a day)  
o Both -Insulin and a non -insulin  injectable  medication  
A total of 240 evaluable subjects are needed to complete the study.  A goal of 60 subjects per group (for 
90% power) is targeted. Subjects may also be injecting other diabetes medications with a pen needle and 
pen device. If subjects use the same pen needle to inject both insulin and non -insulin medications, they will 
be asked to use the Nucleus product for both injections during the study.  If subjects do not use the sa me 
pen needle to inject both insulin and non -insulin injectable medications, they will be asked to only use the 
medication (either insulin or non -insulin) with which they use one of the eligible pen needles.

collected from subjects/specimens after the point of discontinuation except as needed to follow ongoing adverse 
events.  All study data collected from the subject up to the point of discontinuation will be rec orded on the Case 
Report Form, entered into the study database, and included in subsequent analyses, as appropriate.  
Subjects may be using medication pens for non -insulin injections such as GLP -1 agonists. Subjects may use both 
of these pens in the study, provided they use the same eligible pen needle for both injections . In the study, s ubjects 
will use the commercially available  pen needle for 15 days and the  Nucleus pen needle  for 15 days , with the 
crossover period order  depending on the randomization schedule.  As the study progresses, restrictions may be 
placed on number of injections/day.  
6.2 Visit 1: Screening and Enrol lment  
Prior to screening subjects for eligibility for the study, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_225426] i nformed 
consent from all potential subjects. Once consented, subjects will be assigned a subject number.  
The following will be conducted by [CONTACT_225440]/demographical information:  
 
6.2.1 Demographics/ Diabetes  History: Subjects will be asked a number of background and 
demographic questions to ensure they meet the study -specific eligibility cr iteria. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_225427] -reported by [CONTACT_423]; this 
information wil l be re corded in the source documents.  Information collected will include, but 
is not limited to age, gender  and diabetes histor y (Type 1 or Type 2, medications  including 
dose and method s of delivery).   
6.2.2 Proficiency: Subjects will be asked to perform a mock  injection  into an injection pad using a 
BD Nano pen needle.  This will  demonstrate their proficiency in injecting  with a pen needle 
and pen device.  If the subject is unable to demonstrated proficiency, s/he is dis continued from 
the study. The study staff  will use a checklist to qualify the subject.   
6.2.3 Randomization : After each subject has completed the proficiency  test, the subject will be  
assigned a randomization number based on their pen needle group (Group 1 -4), which will 
determine the order of the pen needed used in Period  1 or Period 2 .

to accepted standards of medical practice until the event resolves, stabilizes, or in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_684], is no longer con sidered clinically significant.  
8.0 RISK / BENEFIT ASSES SMENT   
8.[ADDRESS_271046]. As a 
result of inserting a pen needle, subjects may experience pain , bleeding, or local infection.  However, given 
the size of the  investigational  pen needles (4mm x 32G) and the procedures being used in disinfecting the 
skin prior to inserting the pen needle these risks are negligible.

9.0 SAFETY  
9.1 Adverse Event Definitions  
Adverse Event (AE):  Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom or disease in a subject that is temporally associated with the u se of an investigational product or 
procedures , even if the event is not considered to be related to the study product or procedures.  
This includes events not seen at baseline and events that have worsened if present at baseline.  The term 
AE will refer t o all adverse events (serious and non -serious) occurring during participation in a study of 
either investigational devices and/or drugs.  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE):  An SAE is any AE occurring during study participation that results in any 
of the following outcomes:  
 Death  
 Life Threatening (refers to any event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the 
event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe)  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17127] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
 Persistent or significant disability or incapacitation (refers to any event which results in a 
substantial and/or permanent disruption of the subject’s ability to carry out normal life functions)  
 Required intervention to pre vent permanent impairment/damage  
 Congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Important medical event that may require intervention to prevent one of the preceding conditions.  
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE):  Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any 
life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death 
was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or 
application (including a supplement ary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem 
associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects. Refer to Protocol Section 
8.1 (Potential Risks) for a list of anticipated  adverse events, signs or sym ptoms. (21CFR -812.3(s))

9.2 Adverse Event (AE) Management  
At each study contact, subjects will be questioned in an open -ended manner regarding any new or worsening 
undesirable signs or symptoms they may have experienced since the previous contact.  Elicited si gns and 
symptoms must be comprehensively documented on the appropriate source documentation.  
Each sign, symptom, disease or illness reported must be evaluated by [CONTACT_225443].  
The clinical course of the event will be followed according to accepted standards of medical practice until 
the event resolves, stabilizes, or in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], is no longer considered clinically 
significant.  The Investigator must supply t he Sponsor with information concerning the follow up and/or 
resolution of the AE.   
Some reported or observed signs and symptoms are inherent to subcutaneous  injection and are likely to 
occur transiently for nearly all subjects in this study.   Such signs or  symptoms will not be considered AEs 
as long as they are mild (transient , easily tolerated, no interference with daily activities ) and the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_49202].  The following will not be not be considered AEs:  
 Mild, self -limited pain, swelling at the injection site  
 Mild bruising at the injection site  
 Mild self -limited bleeding at the injection site  
 
However, these signs and symptoms must be considered AEs and documented on the Adverse Event CRF   
should any of them occur in such a way that the extent or nature of the experience exceeds that normally 
associated with th e procedure, as judged by [CONTACT_225444], bruising or bleeding.  
All needle breaking must be considered AEs and documented on the Adverse Event CRF . 
Some signs and symptoms are inherent to the conditions under study (i.e. diabetes) and are likely to occur 
transiently for nearly all subjects in this study. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_225429]/o r study procedures, should be reported based 
on the following criteria:  
 All blood glucose values <50 mg/dL (hypoglycemia) or >400 mg/dL (hyperglycemia) that require 
3rd party (defined as, assistance of another person to administer carbohydrates or glucagon ) or 
medical assistance for recovery will be recorded as an AE and assessed for seriousness.  
 Any self -identified hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia without a BG reading  or with any BG 
reading  that requires 3rd party or medical assistance for recovery will be re corded as an AE and 
assessed for seriousness.  
 BG >400 mg/dL (and no symptoms of ketosis) will not be considered an AE.  
o Signs of ketosis are elevated BG along with nausea but individual has the ability to drink 
fluids and nausea is resolved with additional insulin and oral fluids, this may be 
considered an AE per the discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1461].  
All blood glucose values <50 mg/dL, or self -identified as hypoglycemia that resolves with standard 
carbohydrate administration will not be recorded as an AE unl ess otherwise determine d by [CONTACT_9532].  However, these signs and symptoms must be considered AEs and documented on the Adverse 
Event CRF   should any of them occur in such a way that the extent or nature of the experience exceeds that 
normal ly associated with the procedure, as judged by [CONTACT_978], or the event meets the criteria for a Serious 
Adverse Event (SAE).

9.3 Assessment of Adverse Events (AEs)  
All AEs must be assessed for Seriousness, Severity, and Relationship. All AEs, regardless of classi fication, 
must be comprehensively documented in the CRF  and on the SAE form, if applicable, and reported to BD.  
This includes AEs related to marketed study products. The following information about the event is to be 
reported on the AE CRF:  
 Seriousness, c lassified as: Non -Serious or Serious  
 Severity,  classified as:  
o Mild: Transient symptoms, easily tolerated, no interference with daily activities  
o Moderate: Marked symptoms, moderate interference with daily activities, tolerable  
o Severe : Considerable interference with daily activities, intolerable  
 Relationship, to the study product or study procedures:  
o Not Related:  Evidence suggests absolutely no possible causal relationship between the 
event and the investigational study device (or procedures).  
o Unlikely Related:  Evidence suggests that other possible causes or contributing etiological 
factors may have caused the event other than the investigational study device (or 
procedures).  
o Possibly Related:  Evidence suggests a causal relationship between the event and the 
investigational study device (or procedures) cannot be ruled out  
o Related:  Evidence suggests a reasonable causal relationship between the event and the 
device (or procedures) is likely  
In addition, the following should be recorded for each AE:  
 Action(s) taken to remedy the AE, including change in study treatment or participation, or 
medical/surgical treatments  
 Duration of the AE from onset through resolution, as applicable  
 Cause (including suspected product/procedure and/or other cause)  
 Outcome  of the event, including resolution and sequelae, as applicable  
9.4 Additional Procedures for Assessing & Reporting Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
SAE  criteria are specified in Section 9.1.   All SAE s must also be assessed by [CONTACT_225445]. An adverse event will be 
considered unexpected or unanticipated if the nature, severity or frequency of the event is not consistent 
with the risk information previously described in the protoco l, Informed Consent, or Investigator’s 
Brochure (if applicable).  
Any adverse event meeting the criteria for ‘Serious’, regardless of the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_225430], must be reported to BD within [ADDRESS_271048] also submit a completed SAE form to the BD Trial Safety 
Dept. via fax or email listed below within 24 hours  of receipt of the information.

BD CONFIDENTIAL    Page 22 of 30 
The investigator is required to maintain original source documents at the site.  Should an original source 
document (e.g., an instrument printout, direct entry CRF) need to be forwarded to BD for data entry, the 
site must re tain a clearly designated certified copy.  The Study Monitor will confirm that procedures for 
copy certification have been established at the site prior to transmittal of any original source documents.   
12.2 Case Report Forms (CRF)  
The case report forms (CRF) w ill be provided by [CONTACT_1034].  The term “CRF” as used in this protocol 
may refer to traditional paper CRFs, or electronic case report forms for electronic data capture (EDC), as 
determined by [CONTACT_1034].   
The Investigator may delegate CRF completion to  study personnel.  However, the Sponsor must be apprised 
in writing of the name [CONTACT_225459].  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_225434], 
an electronic signature.  An individual record will be kept for each subject that provided informed consent.  
All entries to a paper CRF should  be made clearly in black or dark blue indelible ballpoint pen to ensure 
the legibility of self-copying or photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_225435]. Corrections are made by [CONTACT_1299] a single horizontal line 
through the incorrect entry, so that the original entry can still be seen, and placing the revised entry beside 
it. The revised entry must be initialed and dated by  a member of the Investigator's research team authorized 
to make CRF entries. Correction fluid must not be used.  
CRF entries will be compared to source documents by [CONTACT_225451]. Unless 
specified otherwise, all information on the CRFs must be traceable to original source documents.   
12.2.1  CRF as Source Document  
In this study, the following  CRFs will serve as original source documents:    Visual Analog Scale for 
preference, component preference, overall comfort, anxiety, pain, bruisin g, bending and ease of use. A 
questionnaire will be used for exploratory outcomes.

backups of the data. Upon completion of the study and verification of data, data will be screened for 
accuracy and completeness, after which the database will be locked from any additional c hanges. A copy 
of the locked database will be provided to the BD Corporate Statistics Department for statistical analysis.  
13.0 STATISTICAL METHODS  
Statistical methods will be detailed i n a Statistical Analysis Plan. Any deviations from the original statistical 
plan will be justified and described in an amended statistical analysis plan and/or the protocol, or the final 
statistical and study  report.  
13.1 Sample Size Determination  
Based on previous studies, SD for relative VAS is assumed to be ~35mm.   A sample size of 60 subjects  has 
90% power of passing a 10mm NI criteria , assuming a true average of  5mm  in favor of Nucleus (2 -sided 
95% CI for the mean) .  A sample size of [ADDRESS_271054] s is sufficient to provide 80% power.   These sample size 
apply to each subgroup for which a NI (or superiority) claim  is desired . 
13.[ADDRESS_271055] to review for possible exclusion based on significant protocol  
deviations (e.g. failure to follow randomization scheme ). 
13.3 Statistical Methods  
All analyses will be performed  and presented  per subgroup (Group 1 – Group 4) first (with no alpha 
adjustment).  For each response, a  statistical test will be applied  to determine whether it is valid to combine 
the results from the four study group into one overall result.  If significant differences between the groups 
are identified, combined results will only include results from the groups exhibiting no significant 
difference; groups that are significantly different (if any) will not be grouped into the overall result.      
If a sufficient number of subjects  having a two -weeks wash -in period,  are enrolled in the study, a 
comparison of the responses may be performed . The comparison will be conducted between the subjects 
who did wash -in and those who did not wash -in  for all groups pooled together.  
Descriptive statistics (number of observations, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum and 95% 
mean confidence interval ) will be calculated and presented for all quantitative responses. Frequency tables 
with number of observations, percentage of total and 95% confidence interval (score method) for the 
percentage (as applicable) will be created for discrete responses.  
Anal ysis for relative VAS:  For each outcome measured on a relative VAS, a two -sided 95% confidence 
intervals will be calculated for the average rating.  A modeling approach may be used to adjust for the visit 
effect (b ecause of  the often observed bias towards  favoring the last PN used ).  Results will be tested for 
non-inferiority, followed by [CONTACT_225452] :

If the lower bound of the CI is > 0mm, we can conclude in superiority  
Analysis for needle breaking,  needle  bending, injection site bleeding , and bruising:  A 95% confidence 
interval for the following difference in two independent proportions will be calculated using the score 
method:  
 
Proportion  with BD Nucleus PN – Proportion  with C urrent PN  
 
The upper bound of the confidence interval will be compared to the 4% NI criterion:  non-inferiority will 
be concluded given the upper bound of the 95% score interval for the difference in proportions is < 4%.  
 
Analysis for needle l eakage :  Distribution of leakage scores will be provided and proportion of injections 
with recorded leakage score > 1 will be calculated per pen needles in each subgroup.  Same analysis as 
for needle breaking, needle bending, injection site bleeding or bruising will be  performed using 
proportion of injections with recorded leakage  score  > 1 as the response . 
Exploratory endpoints will be summarized with proportion of “Yes” answers and 95% score confidence 
interval.  
 
13.4 Demographics/Other descriptive information  
Demographic variables will be summarized for all subjects in each study group. Count, mean, standard

Protocol deviations (other than those required to protect the safety and well -being of a subject) may impact 
the evaluability of study data, and may place subjects at risk.   If the Investigator or their staff inadvertently 
deviates from the study plan, the Investigator should implement appropriate corrective and preventive 
procedures, and should notify the Sponsor at their earliest convenience.  Significant deviations may also  
need to be reported to the IRB/ EC and local health authority.   
The Study Monitor will evaluate records of study conduct at the site to identify any deviations, and will 
also report them to the Sponsor.  Upon evaluation by [CONTACT_1034], actions may be requ ired to prevent 
additional deviations, such as retraining of the site, implementation of additional site procedures, and more 
frequent monitoring.  If these steps fail, more serious measures, up to and including termination of the site

15.7 Publication of Results   
BD believes that results of applicable clinical studies  of our products should be published in peer -revie wed 
literature in a timely, accurate, complete and balanced manner, regardless of study  outcomes. BD is 
committed to making information public whenever it relates to the safety and efficacy of its marketed 
products.  
Any formal presentation or publication o f data collected from this study will be considered as a joint 
publication by [CONTACT_093](s) and the appropriate personnel of BD. Authorship will be based on 
generally accepted criteria of the ICMJE (International Committee of Medical Journal Editors)  and 
determined by [CONTACT_11402]. For multi -center studies, the first publication will be  based on data from 
all centers, analyzed as stipulated in the protocol by [CONTACT_225453], and not based on data from single 
sites or a subset of sites. Investiga tors participating in multi -center studies agree not to present data gathered 
from one center or a small group of centers before the full, initial publication, unless formally agreed to by 
[CONTACT_225454] (the sole exception being an unantic ipated adverse event that is product -
related and which might have clinically significant safety implications for a marketed product or a class of 
products).

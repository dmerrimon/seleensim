 1. PROTOCOL SUMMARY 
1.1. Synopsis  
 
Title: Touch and Feel Evaluation of Two Foam Hand Sanitizers  
 
Study Description: Hand sanitizers are a standard of hygiene requirements. Hand sanitizers must 
be effective at reducing germ count on the hands while ideally providing 
emollients to moisturize the s kin after use. To improve compliance with hand 
sanitizing protocols, hand sanitizers should provide a pleasant touch and feel 
experience for end users,  especially for healthcare worker (HCW) users, who 
use these products  frequently. 
 
The goal of this stu dy is to evaluate the user  experience of  two foam hand 
sanitizers produced by [CONTACT_488730]. 
 
 
The foam sanitizer products that will be evaluated in this study include: 
 
 Spectrum  Advanced Hand Sanitizer Foam (hereby [CONTACT_488731]) 
 
 PURELL®  Advanced  Foam Hand sanitizer (hereby [CONTACT_488732]) 
 
  
Phase: 
 Post-market. 
Primary Objective: 
 To establish the non-inferiority of the Spectrum product to the Purell produ ct 
by [CONTACT_488733]. 
Primary Endpoint: The user touch and feel experience of the hand sanitizer products evaluated 
by [CONTACT_488734] (VAS) of HCWs overall sa tisfaction and 
moisturization, and HCWs assessment of product preference.

Power Analysis 
Methods: The sample size of 90 (45 for the foam cohort and 45 for a gel cohort to be 
evaluated in a future study) was estimated to provide 80% power at the 
95% level of confidence for the proportion of HCWs preferring one product 
-Inferiority Tests for the 
Power Analysis and Sample Size Software (2021). NCSS, LLC. Kaysville, 
Utah, [LOCATION_003], ncss.com/software/pass. The estimated non-inferiority margins 
were .03 to .08 with estimated proportion differences of .1, .15 and .20. 
This study utilizes the sample of N=[ADDRESS_627794] cohort. 
 
Description of 
Sites/Facilities 
Enrolling Participants: The study will be conducted at Northshore Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].    
Description of Study 
design: This will be a prospective, single-blinded randomized cohort study that will 
be conducted over the course of one study visit. Participants will be asked 
to wash and dry their hands and apply a sanitizer product. The order in 
which the two hand sanitizer products are applied will be randomized. The 
participants will be instructed to apply the product topi[INVESTIGATOR_488715]. After product application, 
the participants will complete a VAS assessment of their touch and feel 
experience with the product. Participants will then repeat the process with 
the second product. In the time between evaluating each product, 
participants will be asked to wash and dry their hands with soap and water 
and wait an additional two minutes after their hands have dried. After 
applying both products, the participants will complete a product preference 
questionnaire.   
Participant Duration: Approximately one hour.

2. INTRODUCTION  
2.1. Background & Rationale 
 
Hand sanitizers are a standard of hygiene requirements. Hand sanitizers are a standard tool frequently 
used in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_488716] (HCWs) for hand disinfection. The Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC) states that HCWs should use an alcohol-based hand rub, such as a hand sanitizer, 
or wash their hands with soap and water immediately before and after patient contact, during aseptic 
tasks, after contact [CONTACT_166922], bodily fluids, or contaminated surfaces, and immediately after glove 
removal. 1 Additionally, the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on hand hygiene state that 
alcohol-based handrubs rapi[INVESTIGATOR_488717] a wide array of potentially harmful 
microorganisms on hands. [ADDRESS_627796] be effective at reducing germ count on the hands 
while ideally providing emollients to moisturize the skin after use. To improve compliance with hand 
sanitizing protocols, hand sanitizers should provide a pleasant touch and feel experience for users, 
especially for healthcare worker (HCW) users. 
 
The goal of this study is to evaluate the user touch and feel experience of two hand sanitizer foam 
products produced by [CONTACT_488735].  
2.2. Study Products 
 
2.2.1.  Spectrum  Advanced Hand Sanitizer Foam  
 
Spectrum Advanced Hand Sanitizer Foam is made with a 70% ethyl alcohol foaming formula 
that evaporates quickly on the hands and is effective at eliminating 99.99% of common germs 
harmful germs and bacteria. The formula includes added moisturizers to help reduce dry skin. 
The SKU number for Spectrum Advanced Hand Sanitizer Foam is HH70F1000 will be used 
with the X10 Medline Dispenser.  
 
2.2.2.  PURELL® Advanced  Foam Hand sanitizer 
 
The SKU number for PURELL®  Advanced Foam Hand Sanitizer is GOJ190502 will be used 
with PURELL® LTX-12  Dispenser SKU GOJ192004. 
 
2.3. Risk/Benefit Profile 
2.3.1. Potential Study Risks 
This study entails minimal risk to the participants. All hand sanitizer products are 
commercially available and widely used in clinical settings. There is the possibility of 
minor skin irritation with the application of the hand sanitizer products; however, the 
magnitude of this should be no greater than what occurs through the normal use of the hand 
sanitizers. In addition, the study is designed such that the test products will be applied on 
the non-compromised skin of participants with no known skin conditions, which should 
impose less risk for study participants. 
MED-2022-DIV60-[ADDRESS_627797] benefit to the study participants is unlikely. However, the results from this study 
may better inform the user touch and feel experience of the study products among HCWs, 
which may translate into improved user experience and frequency of use of the study 
products by [CONTACT_488736].  
2.3.3. Assessment of Potential Risk/Benefit Profile 
As this study entails minimal risk to the study participants and the results may further 
inform the user touch and feel experience of the study products by [CONTACT_488736], the risk/benefit 
profile of this study is acceptable. 
3. OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS

4. STUDY DESIGN 
4.1. Overall Design 
 
This will be a prospective, double-blinded randomized cohort study that will be conducted over the 
course of one study visit. Participants will evaluate two foam hand sanitizer products.   
 
The requirement to obtain informed consent will be waived for this clinical study. Following 
screening for eligibility, successfully enrolled participants will be asked to wash and dry their hands 
and apply one of two foam hand sanitizer products. The order in which each product is applied first 
will be randomized. The participants will be instructed to apply the first product (Hand Sanitizer A) 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_488718]. The aliquot provided from 
the automated dispenser will be approximately [ADDRESS_627798] (Hand Sanitizer B). After applying the two foam Hand 
Sanitizers A and B, the participant will complete a product preference questionnaire. At this point, the 
participant has completed the study and will be dismissed.

 experience with Hand Sanitizer B. Participant responses to the assessment will be recorded in the 
CRF by [CONTACT_464]. 
6.1.5.  End of Study Activity: Product Preference Questionnaire  
After applying the two foam Hand Sanitizers A and B, the participant will complete a Product 
Preference Questionnaire. Participant responses to the questionnaire will be recorded in the CRF 
by [CONTACT_464]. When both Hand Sanitizers A and B have been applied and the participant has 
completed the study VAS Assessments and the Product Preference Questionnaire, the participant 
will be dismissed from the study.  
7. ADVERSE EVENTS (AEs)  
7.1. Definition of AE  
The FDA definition for an AE is: An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or 
procedure that may or may not be considered related to the medical treatment or procedure. 
However, a narrower definition of AE will be used for this study. In this study, an AE is any untoward 
medical occurrence related to the topi[INVESTIGATOR_488720], including skin 
itching, erythema, edema, or any other skin irritation that occurs.  
7.2. Definition of Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
The FDA definition of a SAE will be used in this study: An AE or suspected adverse reaction is 
considered "serious" if, in the view of either the PI [INVESTIGATOR_10157], it results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
 Death, 
 A life-threatening adverse event, 
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], 
 A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions, or 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6721], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the 
participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in 
this definition. All SAEs will be reported to Medline, regardless of potential relationship to the study 
product(s). SAEs  will be reported to the reviewing IRB as necessary according to their reporting 
requirements.  
7.3. Severity of AE 
The severity of all AEs will be graded on a scale of one through five according to the Common 
Terminology Criteria for AE guideline, where each grade represents a unique clinical description based 
on this general guideline: 
 Grade 1:  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observation 
only; intervention not indicated. 
MED-2022-DIV60-001  
18-NOV-2022      CONFIDENTIAL  
Version 3.0   
 14 
  Grade 2:  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limited age-
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living. 
 Grade 3:  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting 
activities of daily living involving self-care.  
 Grade 4:  Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated 
 Grade 5:  Death related to AE 
7.4. Relatedness of AE and SAE 
 
 Unrelated:  This category applies to those AEs which, after careful consideration, are 
clearly and incontrovertibly due to extraneous causes (disease, environment, etc.) 
 Possible:  This category applies to those AEs for which, after careful medical 
consideration at the time they are evaluated, a connection with the Investigational 
Product administration appears unlikely but cannot be ruled out with certainty. 
 Probable:  This category applies to those AEs which, after careful medical 
consideration at the time they are evaluated, are felt with a high degree of certainty to 
be related to the study product(s). 
 Definite: This category applies to those AEs which, after careful consideration, are 
clearly and incontrovertibly due to the study product(s). 
7.5. Expectedness 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_488721]. An AE 
will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with 
the risk information previously described for the study intervention.  
7.6. AE Reporting 
The AEs will be recorded on the AE form (provided by [CONTACT_488729], LP) by [CONTACT_488741]. Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the 
duration of the event at each level of severity. Changes in severity will necessitate a new CRF to 
document the new level of severity. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of onset 
and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. 
Non-serious AEs will be reported to the study sponsor on a monthly basis for review or as agreed upon 
with the study sponsor, and reported to the IRB per IRB reporting requirements. 
7.7. SAE Reporting

proportion differences of .1, .15 and .20. This study will utilize the sample of N=[ADDRESS_627802] or second will also be 
randomly assigned. The participants, as well as on-site staff will be blinded to testing products. If 
a participant is unable to complete the study or has missing data, the participant will be replaced 
such that the new participant will be assigned to the randomization cohort of the replaced 
participant. Randomization schedule will be generated using SAS® software, Version 9.4 of the 
SAS System for Windows. Copyright © 2013 SAS Institute Inc.  
8.3. Populations for Analyses 
 
The analyses will be performed on the  intent-to-treat  population which consists of all subjects 
 who were qualified for entry criteria and adhered to the protocol, meaning completing the 
 satisfaction and user experience questionnaire for both testing products.  
No per protocol, safety, or other analyses groups are planned.  
8.4. Statistical Analysis 
Descriptive and/or summary statistics will be calculated for the primary endpoints, which are the 
user touch and feel experience of the hand sanitizer products evaluated by [CONTACT_488742], and HCWs assessment of product

[ADDRESS_126425] cancer survivors in the U.S. today .1 However, this improvement is 
offset by [CONTACT_113339] -related morbidity and mortality.2–[ADDRESS_126426] cancer patients , particularly those receiving anthracycline 
chemotherapy,   experience substantial reductions in cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_17863] (CRF) – defined by 
[CONTACT_113340] (e.g., becoming out of breath when walking across a room) .2–5 Unfortunately, many 
of these women do not regain their fitness after treatment cessation . A recent study demonstrated that 
even treatment historically thought to be well -tolerated is associated with long -term marked impairment 
of cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_17863].6 
 
This substantial loss of fitness leads to a lower quality of life (Q oL) and reduces a survivor’s ability to 
maintain activities of daily living.2,5,7,8 Reduced cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_113314] -
occurring cardiovascular disease (CVD),[ADDRESS_126427] CRF . The factors that increase the risk of reduced 
cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_113315] -treated survivors are multifaceted and extend beyond 
cardiac -specific factors.10,11 Cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_113316], and as such 
is a useful metric to estimat e total body health.9 Unfortunately, it is well -documented that cancer 
treatment can lead to dysfunction of many organ systems, including skeletal muscles and cardiac 
muscles. The changes to cardiac muscles and skeletal muscle composition – known as the 
cardiovascular -skeletal muscle axis – are known to play a cri tical role in cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_17863].3,12,[ADDRESS_126428] cancer survivors, providers lack an evidence base to offer an 
‘exercise prescription’ to patients, the lack of which contributes to lower physical activity in breast 
cance r survivors.[ADDRESS_126429] 
cancer survivors. This is supported by [CONTACT_113341]’s ability to  oxygenate17 as well as increased intermuscular fat 
was the predominant factor in breast cancer survivors with reduced cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_4806].[ADDRESS_126430] cancer survivors , that involved 
a similar focus on exercise intervention  and utilized a similar recruit ment plan  to identify and  enroll 
participants .19,20 In addition, our research team has expertise in assessment of functional  exercise 
capacity (e.g., 6 -minute walk distance , cardiopulmonary exercise testing ) and of body fat depots , 
particularly IMF and depots of abdominal adiposity using magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI).21,22  
 
2.4 Risks/Benefits  
 
Anticipated risks.  No serious risks are anticipated with this study. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing 
(CPET)  may cause some fatigue and physical discomfort.  Psychological discomfort, such as anxiety  or 
apprehension , may arise for participants related to  undergoing MRI and CPET . These are not seen as 
significant risks with levels of discomfort beyond those that they might experience during situations 
 
 
5 outside of the study. Participants will be informed that they can stop participating in the study at any 
time.  
 
Risks associated w ith the intervention are minima l, even for individuals with reduced cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_106387] . However, adverse events may occur with exercise : 
 
Exercise training . The major risks of participating in this monitored program include muscle 
fatigue, muscle so reness, and possible joint or skeletal injury. These risks are reduced by 
[CONTACT_113342], proper warm -up/cool down 
periods, conservative exercise prescriptions and progression, and monitoring by [CONTACT_113343] (including exercise physiology  specialists). If experienced, exercise -related injuries are 
expected to be of minimal discomfort and short duration and not significantly different than what 
someone might experience in everyday physical activities.    
 
The study will maintain ongoing compliance  with all University of Washington  guidelines surrounding 
COVID -[ADDRESS_126431] about the presence of any adverse events. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_113317]/serious adverse 
events.  For more information, see the study Data & Saf ety Monitoring  (DSM ; Appendix A ) 
 
Storing all data with only a code attached will help ensure confidentiality. However, there is a potential 
risk of breach of confidentiality related to collection of sensitive information and participant identifiers. 
Follo wing procedures outlined in Section [ADDRESS_126432] benefits to participants.  Participants in the intervention group may benefit from a free , 
semi-supervised  exercise program. All physiologic  measures are performed and analyzed for research 
purposes only; we do not plan to share findings with participants.  
 
Individual participant s’ findings.  Generally, individual findings will not be shared with the participant. We 
do not anticipate th e MRI will produce any timely , clinically actionable results. If a life -threatening 
condition is  identified through the CPET , this result  will be shared with the participant.

4.0   STUDY DESIGN  
 
4.1 Description of Study  
 
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] a 2-arm randomized trial with a 2:[ADDRESS_126434] control  (see Appendix B for study schema) . The intervention group will then be random ly 
assigned  (1:1) to receive either a 12-week aerobic exercise (AE) intervention or a 12-week resistance 
exercise (RE)  intervention.  
 
At 12 weeks, the intervention group will be assessed for intervention response , defined as a ≥5% 
increase in 6-minute walk distance ( 6MWD ) over baseline . Non -responders to either AE or RE  will 
receive 12 weeks of  combined AE+ RE. Intervention responders will continue the exercise intervention 
in their current assignment , either AE or RE  alone , for the additional [ADDRESS_126435] control group  will receive a digital 
copy of sessions provided to the intervention arm . The control and intervention arms’ schedule of 
evaluations  will be identical  across all 24 weeks of the trial .  
 
4.2 Endpoints  
 
4.2.1  Primary Endpoint  
 
Intervention Feasibility : Intervention feasibility will be determined with all -cause intervention  
discontinuation rate, which is the proportion of all intervention participants who permanently stop the 
intervention prior to Week 24  for any reason . 
 
4.2.2  Secondary Endpoint  
 
The secondary outcomes include:  
 
Intervention Safety  
 
Safety:  Intervention safety will be determined by [CONTACT_113344] (mild, moderate, or severe), serious adverse events, and by [CONTACT_113345]. See Section 8.0 for adverse 
event definitions and protocols.   
 
Study Feasibility  & Acceptability  
 
 
7  
Study feasibility:  Study feasibility will be measured by [CONTACT_113346] (proportion of 
enrolled participants to all individuals approached), lost to follow -up (proportion of participants who do 
not complete post -intervention assessments), relative dose intensity (pr oportion of completed to 
planned sessions), early session terminations (proportion of sessions ended by [CONTACT_113347]), intervention interruptions (missing 3 or more planned sessions 
consecutively), attendance (proportion  of attended to planned sessions), and adherence (gathered from 
HR/accelerometry data and self -report of exercise via questionnaires). A benchmark to determine 
feasibility is <40% loss to follow -up. 
 
Intervention acceptability:  Acceptability will be measur ed with qualitative, open -ended to assess 
participant experience in the intervention and gather information for improving the protocol in future 
studies. Of particular attention will be the tolerability of a remote, home -based exercise intervention with 
a semi -supervised format.  
 
Intervention session intensity and adherence : The Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale asks 
respondents to rate the intensity of exercise on a 6 – [ADDRESS_126436] RPE after each session in order to track session intensity 
and completion (adherence).  
 
Functional Capacity  
 
Submaximal exercise  capacity:  Submaximal exercise capacity , also considered functional capacity,  will 
be determined with the six  minute walk tes t (6MWT),26 which measures the distance a person can walk 
in six minutes (6MWD).  A widely used  measure of submaximal exercise capacity, t he 6MWT will be 
administered at all study timepoints  to evaluate  intervention response . 
 
Strength:  One Repetition Maximum (1 -RM) or the maximum amount  of force that can be generated in 
one maximum effort movement, will be used to assess participant strength at each time point. A chest 
press machine and leg press machine will be utilized to separately estimate upper body strength and 
lower body strength f or each participant. The [ADDRESS_126437].  
 
4.2.3  Other/ Exploratory Endpoints  
 
Cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_113319]:  This study’s primary outcome is cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_17863] (CRF). This is 
operationalized as maximal exercise capacity, which is ascertained by [CONTACT_113348] (VO 2 peak) during CPET. All CPETs will be administered by a trained exercise p hysiologist 
using the Modified Bruce protocol, an appropriate testing paradigm for people with reduced physical 
functioning. This procedure will estimate the VO 2 (absolute and relative to bodyweight), VCO 2, 
VE/VCO 2, BP, HR. Total exercise time as well as w orkload and peak exercise will be collected as well. 
Ventilatory and work efficiency/economy will be calculated. Ventilatory threshold will be determined 
from VO 2 – VCO 2 plot (V -Slope).  
 
 
 
8 Intervention adherence (accelerometry):  Participants will wear 2 devi ces during the study: (1) a waist -
worn actigraph and (2) a wrist -worn FitBit activity monitor (Charge 4, FitBit, San Francisco, CA). The 
actigraph will be worn for [ADDRESS_126438] will calculate the amount of time (in min/per day) spent in activities of 
low-, moder ate-, and vigorous -activity. Categorization of the level of physical activity will use accepted 
cutpoints from the literature. 25 
Physiologic Changes  
 
Anthropometrics:  Prior to the measurement of body weight, participants will be instructed to  remove 
heavy clothing and empty pockets of their contents. Weight will be measured to the nearest  one-tenth 
kg with a calibrated balance beam or digital scale. Height will be measured while the participant stands 
without shoes using a wall -mounted stadiometer to the nearest one -tenth cm . Hip and waist 
circumference will be measured to the nearest one -tenth cm.  
 
Intermuscular fat (IMF):  The ratio of thigh IMF to skeletal muscle (SM) will be ascertained via MRI by 
[CONTACT_113349] (see Appendix C for the MRI protocol).  Participants will undergo a screening 
process with the MRI technologist to ensure that eligibility criteria for MRI scans are met. Participants 
will then change into a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_113320]. In this longitudinal assessment of IMF, 
the MRI technologist will be instructed to match participant scan positions across  time by [CONTACT_113350]’s previous scan position, recorded at the timepoint prior. MRI 
analysts will quantitate total and compartment amounts of muscle and adipose tissue using cross -
sectional areas of thigh skeleta l muscle (SM) and IMF using commercially available software. Thigh IMF 
area will be calculated as the number of fat pi[INVESTIGATOR_113321]. The analyst will be blinded to MRI visit number, participant’s pri or/future MRI results, 
intervention group, and participant characteristics. This technique for determining muscle composition 
has been validated against cadaver specimens.  
 
Abdominal depots of fat : Subcutaneous (SQ) fat and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) wi ll be assessed via 
abdominal MRI (see MRI Protocol in Appendix C). For analysis, fat depots will be separated into 
abdominal SQ fat and VAT which will be further segmented into intraperitoneal (IP) and retroperitoneal 
(RP) fat using commercially available software.  SQ fat will be defined as the fat outside the muscular 
abdominal wall; IP fat as fat within the mesentery and omentum bounded anteriorly and laterally by [CONTACT_113351] a curved line drawn between the kidneys; RP fat as the  remaining fat. 
Adipose tissues will be segmented and colored from other tissues based on pi[INVESTIGATOR_113322]. The MRI analyst, blinded to participant characteristics, will correct any 
misidentified fat or non -fat regions u sing manual tools provided within the software. To calculate each of 
the compartmental fat deposits, the number of subpi[INVESTIGATOR_113323] (SQ, VAT, IP, and 
RP) will be multiplied by [CONTACT_113352][INVESTIGATOR_113324] (in cm2) for each compartment.  
 
Patient Reported Outcomes  
 
Quality of Life   
 
 
 
9 Quality of life will be assessed with the Short Form Health Survey -36 (SF -12), a widely used self -report 
measure of quality of life  and health status.27 Comprised of 12 multiple choice questions, the SF -12 
queries general perceptions a participant has about their health, as well as limitations to physical 
activity, physical health problems, mental health problems, pain, and energy/fatigue. The SF -[ADDRESS_126439] cancer has been utilized as a longitudinal monitor of 
quality of life.28–30 
 
Physical activity : The Stanford  7 Day Physical Activity Recall (PAR) interview31 will be used to estimate 
participant engagement in physical activity for the [ADDRESS_126440] cancer survivors.32    
 
Sedentary behaviors : Time spent engaging  in sedentary  behaviors will be measured  with the self-
administered  Sedentary Behaviors Questionnaire (SBQ) .33,34 The SBQ measures  the minutes  spent 
participating  in 9 different sedentary behaviors per “typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]” weekday and weekend day.  
 
Perceptions of Physical Activity: Participant perceptions of their readiness for physical activity  and 
barriers to successful PA will be captured with an internally developed scale created by [CONTACT_113353], Opportunity, and Motivation (COM -B) for physical activity35 and 
questions assessing perceived barriers to PA that have previously been used in adult cancer 
survivors.36 
 
Perceived  well-being:  Participants’ perception of their current well -being will be assessed with the 28-
item 5 -point Likert scale Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy  (FACT) -General .[ADDRESS_126441] -G 
contains 4 subs cales measuring physical, social, emotional, and functional  well-being  and has been 
validated for reliably  measuring well -being in cancer patients .38,39 
 
Insomnia : Participant sleep will be assessed with the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI).40 The ISI is a 7 -item, 
5-point Likert scale self -report scale measuring the nature, severity, and effects of insomnia over the 
previous month. Items are summed to a total score where greater than 7 indicates clinically significant 
insomnia.  
 
Mood disturban ces: Symptoms of anxiety and depression will be assessed with the 4 -item, 5 -point 
Likert scale Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ -4). The PHQ -[ADDRESS_126442] cancer survivors.  
 
Fatigue:  The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) -Fatigue scale is a 13 -item scale 
originally developed for and widely used to assess cancer -related fatigue.41,42 The FACIT -Fatigue scale 
measures severity ( e.g.., “I feel fatigued”; “I feel weak all over”) and impact of fatigue (e.g., “I need help 
doing my usual activities”; “I have to limit my social activity because I am tired”) over the past week, 
with responses scored on a 5 -point scale, from 0 “not at all” to 4 “very m uch.” The FACIT -Fatigue scale 
has excellent psychometric properties and a focus on physical aspects of fatigue . 
 
4.[ADDRESS_126443] will recruit 30 study participants through  a multi -pronged approach:  
 
Seattle Cancer Care Alliance  (SCCA) clinics : At SCCA, we will work with the breast oncology clinic 
research team to obtain a list of potentially eligible research participants that will include patient name, 
phone number, and mailing address. This eligibility will be based on age and  approximate end date of 
chemotherapy or Herceptin therapy. Potentially eligible participants identified through SCCA will 
receive a mailed letter endorsed by [CONTACT_113354]/or screenin g. The study team may follow up proactively with a phone call no less than 
two weeks after sending the letter . 
 
Breast cancer support groups in the community : Study information will be provided to breast cancer 
support groups in the community by [CONTACT_113355]  (paper, electronic, or Web versions)  with the 
organizers of these groups and by [CONTACT_113356] -person group events, as permitted by 
[CONTACT_113357].  
 
Re-contact[CONTACT_113358] : The pool of previous breast cancer 
research participants will be generated from past projects under the purview of the study’s princip al 
investigators  or shared from affiliate investigators . Previous participants  or candidates  will be contact[CONTACT_113359], email, or mailed letter, depending on what information is available to the study PIs.  
 
The UW ITHS Leaf too l: The University of Washington’s Leaf system will be used to generate an 
identifiable cohort of potentially eligible patients in the UW Medicine system. The study will query the 
database for patients who meet key eligibility criteria and who have recently visited the UW Medicine 
system for treatment. Candidates generated from this list will be sent a letter that describe s the study 
and invites them to contact [CONTACT_113360]. The study team 
may follow up proactively with a phone call no less than two weeks after sending the letter.    
 
4.3.2  Screening  
 
The study coordinator will use the  screening script  and questionnaire to complete  screening  (in-person 
or over-the-phone)  of participant eligibility , according to el igibility criteria detailed in section 5.0. 
Inclusion criterion 4  (reduced CRF) will be estimated with a n algorithm based on BMI, resting HR, and 
self-reported physical activity .[ADDRESS_126444] -protected computer located behind a secure and 
maintained firewall. Candidates will be sent a copy of the consent form prior to their baseline visit for 
review. They will be encouraged to ask questions prior to or at the beginning of their baseline visit. 
Consent will be obtained before data collection procedures at the participant’s baseline visit.  
 
Consent  forms will be revie wed for completeness  and stored in a locked file cabinet in a locked office, 
away from any material with personal or sensitive study data. Participants will be reassured that they 
can withdraw from the study at any time.  
 
Comprehension : Misunderstandings will be addressed in real -time through the teach -back method: 
During the informed consent process potential participants will be asked to summarize the primary 
study objective and procedures.  
 
Ongoing process : Enrolled participants will  have regular communication with study team. The study 
team will attempt to address any participant concerns over the study that arise in order to strengthen 
compliance and retention. Ultimately, participants will be reminded that they are  volunteering and  may 
withdraw from the study at any time.  
 
4.3.[ADDRESS_126445] control arm using blocked 
randomization  (2:1 intervention to control) , stratified upon whether the participant has received “AC” 
chemotherapy (doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide combination therapy) .10 Intervention  participants 
will then be randomized to either aerobic exercise training or resistance strength training,  again  using 
blocked randomization stratified on AC treatment history. Randomization will be performed  in REDCap 
with the REDCap Randomization module.  
 
4.3.4  Data Collection  
 
Clinical and self -report data  will be collected at 3 total timepoints: baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks . 
 
Self-reported data : Participants will be asked to complete baseline questionnaires ascertaining 
demographic information, health history and current health behaviors. At all timepoints  (i.e. baseline, 
12-, and 24-Week) participants will be asked to complete self -reported questionnaires on quality of life , 
physical activity, and fatigue.  
 
Clinic visits : In-person c linic visits will take place at baseline  and 24-weeks for all participants. All clinic 
visits will include  anthropometric assessment,  MRI, supervised 6MWT  and CPET. Participants will 
complete a supervised 6MWT. Study procedures will occur at the University of Washington Medical 
Center and the Fred Hutchinson Prevention Center. At intervention  completion participants will be 
asked open -ended questions regarding their experience with the study. The responses will be analyzed 
for themes to improve future study designs.  
 
Passive Data Collection:  Some data will be remotely collected via wrist - and waist -worn actigraphy 
monitors , worn in the [ADDRESS_126446] -worn devices will also be 
utilized during all interve ntion sessions, as a measure of intervention adherence.

6.0    INTERVENTION PLAN  
 
 
6.1 Treatment  Intervention Arm  
 
Participants in the intervention group will be randomized to receive either AE or RE training. The 
intervention  will comprise of a  combination of supervised and unsupervised sessions . Supervised 
sessions will be led  remotely  via videoconferencing by a trained fitness instructor , while unsupervised 
sessions will involve following along with recorded videos.  Training proto cols will be adapted from the 
American College of Sports Medicine’s (ACSM) guidelines44,[ADDRESS_126449] 3 weeks of resistance training, sessi ons will 
occur 2 times per week  (1 supervised) , to account for increased muscle soreness when starting a 
resistance training regimen.  
 
Exercise  intensity will be me asured using the Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale,23 which collects 
respondent’s perc eption of exertion level on a scale from [ADDRESS_126450] intensity levels for participants’ upcoming sessions.  
 
6.1.[ADDRESS_126451] , 
side steps, and  jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_54817]. Participants will complete exercises in sets, performing a sequence of 
exercises for a certain number of seconds each (e.g. 30 -60 seconds  per exercise ) before a rest of [ADDRESS_126452] 30 minutes and both the duration and  
intensity  of the sessions will increase during the intervention, as outlined in Appendix D . 
 
Intensity will be varied by [CONTACT_113361], the number of seconds per exercise and/or the 
amount of rest time between sets. The intensity will pro gress, as tolerated, for the first 6 weeks of the 
intervention, starting at moderate intensity  and building  to sustained  vigorous intensity (see Appendix 
D). The estimation of intensity will be based off a participant ’s heart rate (HR) at peak VO 2 from the 
CPET at baseline. Trained staff will help participants to determine this target HR.  
 
6.1.2  Resistance  exercise t raining  
 
Resistance exercise training will comprise of weight bearing functional tasks (e.g. sit -to-stand) and  
weighted  exercises , with each  session targeting upper and lower body large muscle groups. 
Participants will complete 5 exercises in sets  of 1 or 2, performing a sequence of exercises for a certain 
number of repetitions (“reps”) each (e.g. 8 -12 reps per exercise) before a short rest. Sets will be 
separated by a rest of 60 -240 seconds.  
 
At baseline testing, study staff will determine participants’ one rep maximum for various weighted 
exercises. The starting weights for the intervention will be based on this measurement.  
 
Intensity can be varied by [CONTACT_113362], the number of seconds of rest, or the 
weight  being used.  
 
6.1.3  Combined aerobic and resistance exercise training  
 
The AE+RE intervention will involve a combination  aerobic and resistance exercises  within session , with  
approximately  half of each  session devoted to AE and half devoted to RE  (See Appendix E). Aerobic 
sets will be completed before resistance sets within each session.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_126453] control group will spend 24 weeks waitlisted for the intervention, during which time they will 
follow the same schedule of evaluations as the intervention group but will not receive exercise sessions. 
After completing 24-week assessments, the control group will receive a digital copy of  sessions 
recorded during the intervention group and an outline of sessions for 24 weeks.  
 
 
7.0    GUIDELINES FOR ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
 
 
7.1 Adverse Event Reporting/Institutional Policy  
 
In accordance with institutional policy, all adverse events which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_113327] 10 calendar days of learning of 
the problem.  
 
Definitions:  
 
Adverse Event  - Any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, such as any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding , for example), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the intervention.  
 
Life-threatening Adverse Event  – Any adverse event that places the participant, in view of the 
investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction.  
 
Unexpected Adver se Event  – An adverse event is “unexpected” when its nature (specificity), severity, 
or frequency are not consistent with (a) the known or foreseeable risk of adverse events associated with 
the intervention; and are also not consistent with (b) the charact eristics of the subject population being 
studied including the expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder or condition any 
predisposing risk factor profile for the adverse event.  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  – Any adverse event occurr ing that results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
• death  
• a life -threatening adverse event (real risk of dying)  
• inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly  
• requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment o r damage  
 
Attribution - The following are definitions for determining whether an adverse event is related to a 
medical product, treatment or intervention procedure:  
 
• An adverse event is related or possibly related to the research procedures  if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_113328], it was more likely than not caused by [CONTACT_28821].  
 
 
 
17 • Adverse events that are solely caused by [CONTACT_113363], disorder or condition of the 
subjec t or by [CONTACT_113364], 
disorder or condition of the subject are not “related or possibly related.”  
 
• If there is any question whether or not an adverse event is related or possibly related, t he 
adverse event should be reported.  
 
All adverse events will be reported to the University of Washington IRB according to UW guidelines.  
 
7.1.1  Adverse Event Grading  
 
Adverse events  will be graded  as Mild, Moderate, or Severe using the NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0 as a guide : 
https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocoldevelopme nt/electronic_applications/docs/ctcae_v5_quick_reference_5
x7.pdf  See Appendix A, Data and Safety Monitoring Plan .  
 
 
8.0     DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
 
 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_113329] a monthly  basis to review participant’s adverse 
events , verify CTCAE grade , and provide attribution , and to review response data.  
 
This study will employ a Data and Safety Monitoring Plan ( DSM ; see Appendix A) to outline how  
participant safety and confidentiality will be managed throughout the study. The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_6254] -investigators  
have clinical licensure  (RN or MD)  and will review  quarterly  the following study data provided by [CONTACT_5055]:  
 
• Number of participants  
• List of adverse event and responses that have occurred in the specified time frame  
• Cumulative table of adverse events by [CONTACT_16624], including deaths as outlined in the 
protocol -specific DSM   
• Premature terminations of the intervention and other safety issues  
At each review, t he PI [INVESTIGATOR_6254] -I’s will  determine whether:  
• The trial should continue as originally designed  
• The trial should be changed  
• The trial should be terminated  
• Outcome results should be released prior to the reporting of the study results  
 
 
9.0  DATA MANAGEMENT/CONFIDENTIALITY  
 
 
This project’s varied recruitment strategies involve different types of contact [CONTACT_113365]. Recruitment streams 2  and 3  outlined in section 4.3.1 will involve 
potential participants either 1) contact [CONTACT_113366] 2) providing cons ent for the study 
 
 
[ADDRESS_126454] 
protocol.  
 
 
10.0   STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
 
For objective 1, we will measure the feasibility of our intervention by [CONTACT_113346]  (% 
participants enroll ed of those approached ), enrollment rate (% enrolled of those eligible), lost to foll ow-
up (% who dropped out of those enrolled ), intervention discontinuation rate (% of intervention 
participants who permanently stop the intervention for any reason by [CONTACT_10585] 24), intervention attendance 
(% exercise sessions attended), relative dose intensity  (% completed sessions), and compliance (based 
on accelerometry data, self -report of exercise via questionnaires). A benchmark to determine feasibility 
includes <40% loss to follow -up. 
 
In objective 2, we will start with an analy sis of  the safety endpoints  by [CONTACT_113367] . 
This analysis will be stratified by [CONTACT_113368], the seriousness of the adverse 
events, and by [CONTACT_113369].  
 
The results from above analyses (for Study Aim 1) will be a primary consideration to inform the 
feasibility and safety of launching a larger scale intervention from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_52393]. If both the se 
sets of data provide indications that the study is feasible and safe, then the exploration of additional 
intervention outcomes will take place.   These  data will be presented in a manuscript to describe the 
potential for this intervention.  The following analyses will explore additional intervention outcomes to 
inform the intervention’s potential to have an impact on CRF, functional capacity, physiologic  changes, 
and PRO in a larger scale intervention.  
 
 
[ADDRESS_126455] control participants  using generalized linear models (GLM) comparing 
baseline to 24-week measurements. This analysis will be repeated for the additional  outcomes of 
functional capacity, i.e., submaximal exercise capacity; physiologic changes, i.e., thigh IMF:SM, 
abdominal depo ts of fat (VAT, SQ, RP, and IP fat), and body weight; and patient reported outcomes, i.e., 
QOL, perceived well -being,  and fatigue. The se analyses will be performed according to the intent -to-
treat principle, where outcomes are analyzed by [CONTACT_113370], regardless of the level of 
adherence. A secondary per protocol analysis will be conducted, and these results will be reported and 
interpreted together with the intent -to-treat analysis. This per protocol analysis will include only those 
participa nts who (a) completed all clinic visits and who completed at least 85% of the required physical 
activity.  In addition, this secondary analysis will investigate factors related to a lack of intervention 
adherence, which will include baseline measures of per ceived well -being,  mood disturbance,  
perceptions of PA, fatigue, and insomnia . 
 
For objective 3, the analysis will explore the impact of AE vs RE vs combined AE+RE on safety 
outcome s using generalized linear models (GLM) comparing pre -intervention measurem ents to post -
intervention measurements. Next, this analysis will be repeated for the additional outcomes of CRF, 
functional capacity , physiologic changes , and patient reported outcomes  of QOL, perceived well-being , 
and fatigue.  
 
In addition, we will explore potential moderators of the intervention, namely baseline BMI and physical 
activity, and adherence to the intervention for Objectives [ADDRESS_126456] qualitative 
analyses utilizing data from the elicitation interviews con ducted at the end of the intervention. This 
analysis will summarize data collected from the participants’ into themes .

23 Appendix A – Data & Safety Monitoring  
 
BRIEF STUDY OVERVIEW  
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] a [ADDRESS_126472]. Kerryn Reding, the Principal Investigator (PI), and co -
investigators, Rachel Yung, MD and Richard Cheng, MD (“co -investigators” throughout).   
 
MONITORING PROCEDURES  
[CONTACT_113376] assures that informe d consent is obtained prior to performing any research procedures, that 
all subjects meet eligibility criteria, and that the study is conducted according to the IRB -approved 
research plan.   
 
Study data are accessible at all times for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_44293]. The  PI [INVESTIGATOR_6254] -investigators review study 
conduct (accrual, drop -outs, protocol deviations) on a monthly basis.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_113335] 
(AE) individually in real -time and with co -investigators in aggregate on a monthly basis.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_6254] -
investigator s review serious adverse events (SAEs) in real -time.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_44296], 
AEs, and SAEs are reported to the IRB according to the applicable regulatory requirements.  
 
COLLECTION AND REPORTING OF SAEs AND AEs  
For this study, the following  standard AE definitions are used:  
 
Adverse event:   Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or intervention 
procedure, regardless of whethe r it is considered related to the medical treatment or intervention 
procedure.  
 
Serious Adverse Event:   Any AE that results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening  
• Event requiring inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 
AEs are graded according to the following scale:  
 
Mild:   An experience that is transient & requires no special treatment or intervention.  The 
experience does not generally interfere with usu al daily activities.  This includes transient 
laboratory test alterations. A mild AE typi[INVESTIGATOR_113336] a 1 on the NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).   
 
 
24 Moderate:   An experience that is alleviated with simple therapeutic treat ments.  The experience 
impacts usual daily activities.  Includes laboratory test alterations indicating injury, but without 
long-term risk. A moderate AE corresponds to a 2 on the CTCAE.   
Severe:   An experience that requires therapeutic intervention.  The  experience interrupts usual 
daily activities. If hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) is required for treatment it 
becomes an SAE. A severe AE corresponds to a 3 on the CTCAE.   
 
The study uses the following AE attribution scale:  
 
Not related:   The AE is clearly not related to the study procedures (i.e., another cause of the 
event is most plausible and/or a clinically plausible temporal sequence is inconsistent with the 
onset of the event).   
Possibly related:   An event that follows a r easonable temporal sequence from the initiation of 
study procedures, but that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors.  
 Related:   The AE is clearly related to the study procedures.   
 
AEs are identified by [CONTACT_38767] -report at each study follow up assessments (12 -, 24-, 36- and 48 -
weeks). Participants will be asked about medical or mental health events that have happened since the 
previous assessment visit. AEs may also be identif ied during supervised (in -person or remote) exercise 
sessions, with an event either occurring or being reported during such sessions.   
 
SAEs and specific procedure -associated AEs are reported to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_6254] -investigators within 24 
hours. In addition, al l AEs are reported according to the University of Washington AE reporting 
guidelines.  
 
MANAGEMENT OF RISKS TO SUBJECTS  
 
Expected AEs  
Expected AEs associated with the exercise intervention include:   
• Fatigue  
• Muscle Soreness  
• Mild Shortness of Breath  
• Mild Ta chycardia  
• Transient increase in blood pressure  
• Lightheadedness  
• Excessive Sweating  
• Muscle strain or sprain  
 
AE Management  
Participants experiencing a mild AE (e.g. fatigue or muscle soreness) related to the intervention will 
have discretion as to whether they want to continue with the intervention exercise regimen. They will be

Series Name:   T1 AX DB Left Thigh_TE36 (REF D)  
Series Description:  T1 weighted turbo spin -echo sequence  acquired with 5 evenly spaced axial 
slices. The position of center slice will be determined by [CONTACT_113371].  
Notes:  A series of images will be acquired to assess muscle and fat composition of left 
thigh.  
Formula for slice location:  
 * Patient’s height in inches x 0.125 = distance from distal femur  
 * Inches x 25.4 = mm  
* Start at distal femur (condyle) and measure up “X” amount of mm to get location for center 
slice 
 * Use left leg  
* Example: Pt Height = 64.3 inches x 0.125 x 25.4 = 20 4 mm

3Prior to initiating any activity involving strength training, the following considerations should be 
made:  
• Resolve  any acute  arm or shoulder  problems  secondary  to breast  cancer  
treatment  before  exercise  training  
• Reduce  or avoid  upper  body  exercise  if exercise  causes  swelling  or changes  in 
arm/shoulder  symptoms  
• Women  with lymphedema  should  wear  a compression  garment  during  exercise  
• Be aware  of risk for fracture  if treated  with hormonal  therapy,  dx of osteoporosis,  or bony  
metastases

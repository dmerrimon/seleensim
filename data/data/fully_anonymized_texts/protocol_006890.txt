SPECIFIC AIMS  
Concisely state the objectives of the study and the hypothesis being tested. 
 
Specific Aim 1 :  Low -dose GH administration for 18 months to osteopenic obese men and 
women will increase bone mass, improve bone microarchitecture and increase bone strength.  
We will investigate in osteopenic  men and women with obesity and relative IGF- 1 deficiency, 
whether GH administration for 18 months to increase IGF-1 levels within the normal range results in:  
A. Increased BMD  
B. Improved bone microarchitecture, including trabecular and cortical thickness.   
• The increase in trabecular thickness will be mediated primarily by [CONTACT_689146] -1  
C. An increase in bone strength, as determined by [CONTACT_689147] 2 :  We will investigate mechanisms responsible for the increase in bone 
strength due to GH administration.  We hypothesize that the increase in strength will be 
mediated by:   
A. A reduction in bone marrow fat mediated by a decrease in Pref- [ADDRESS_934972] activity, assessed by [CONTACT_689148], including P1NP  
B. Increased insulin, in associations with an increase in undercarboxylated osteocalcin    
C. Improved body composition, including a decrease in abdominal adiposity and lipid deposits in muscle and liver, and an increase in muscle mass 
D. A reduction in inflammatory cytokines and improvement in the serum lipoprotein apoB  
E.  An increase in circulating vitamin D.

Provide a brief paragraph summarizing prior experience important for understanding the 
proposed study and procedures. 
 
Obesity is an important risk factor for osteoporosis and fractures. With the growing 
prevalence of obesity in the U.S., understanding th e pathophysiology of bone loss in this 
population is of importance to public health. The etiopathology of obesity -associated bone loss is 
incompletely understood but includes reduced bone formation, deleterious effects of 
inflammatory cytokines, low levels  of circulating vitamin D and elevated lipi[INVESTIGATOR_689145].  Growth hormone (GH) is a critical mediator of bone homeostasis and is markedly reduced in obesity. Obesity is a state of relative GH and IGF -[ADDRESS_934973] an important role for the GH/insulin -like growth factor [ADDRESS_934974] 
study on the effects of GH on stem cell differentiation and bone marrow fat in humans. 
 
RESEA RCH DESIGN AND METHODS  
Briefly describe study design and anticipated enrollment, i.e., number of subjects to be enrolled

eligibility criteria (for example, age range, gender, medical condition).  Include any local site 
restrictions, for example, “Enrollment at Partners will be limited to adults although the sponsor’s 
protocol is open to both children and adults.”
 
Over the five years of this proposal, we e xpect to screen 300 patients in order to enroll 75 (38 
healthy women and 37 healthy men) total men and women with obesity, osteopenia and 
relatively low IGF -1, adiposity  for an evaluable [ADDRESS_934975] dropped out  of the study to ensure 50 completers at 18 months (for which the study is

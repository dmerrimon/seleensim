related deaths [1]. Locally advan ced unresectable and metastati c gastroesophageal cancers are 
not curable conditions, and the goa ls of therapy include pallia tion of symptoms, including 
malignant dysphagia; improveme nt of quality of life, and prolon gation of survival. Prognosis is 
generally poor, with a median sur vival time of 3–[ADDRESS_913904] supportive care and 7–9 
months with systemic chemother apy [2, 3]. Systemic chemotherapy  is the mainstay of treatment 
for these patients. Several cytot oxic agents are active against  gastroesophageal cancer, including 
fluoropyrimidines, platinum agent s (cisplatin and oxaliplatin),  taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel), 
and irinotecan. Additionally, as it is known that the human epi [INVESTIGATOR_3506] 
(EGFR) type 2 (HER2) gene is co mmonly amplified [4-6] and overe xpressed in 
adenocarcinomas of the stomac h, gastroesophageal j unction (GEJ) , and esophagus and is a 
potential target for therapeu tic interventi on. Although the rol e of HER2 as a prognostic marker in 
gastric cancer remains an issue  of debate, HER2 amplification/o verexpression is an important 
therapeutic target for trastuzum ab and is associated with signi ficant improvements in 
progression-free (PFS) and overall s urvival [7]. Routine diagno stic testing is now recommended 
in gastric and GEJ adenocarcinom as based on these findings that  led to approval of the drug by 
[CONTACT_1622] [8] and European Medicines Agency (EMA).  1.[ADDRESS_913905] of care also  calls for testing these patients’ 
tumors for HER2 amplification a nd adding the anti-HER2 antibody  trastuzumab to 
fluoropyrimidine and platinum chemo therapy in patients with HER 2-amplified advanced 
esophagogastric adenocarcinoma.   HER2 amplification is found in 32%  of esophageal adenocarcinoma s[9] and 13% of gastric 
adenocarcinomas[10]. The phase I II ToGA trial established that addition of trastuzumab to 
fluoropyrimidine/plati num combination chemo therapy significantl y improved overall survival 
(OS) from 11.1 months to 13.8 months  and response rate from 35%  to 47%[7], establishing 
trastuzumab-based chemoimmunother apy as the first-line standard  of care in these patients. 
However, patients do invariably de velop disease progression, wi th median progression-free

refractory gastroesopha geal cancer patients, response rates hav e been roughly 11-12% with

compared to placebo in an Asia n population [26] but avelumab re portedly failing to improve 
median OS compared to investigat or’s choice chemotherapy in a g lobal population.  Thus, the 
majority of patients do not derive  substantial benefit from imm une checkpoint inhibitor 
monotherapy in this refractor y setting. Positive immunohistoche mistry for PD-L1 within tumor 
cells, lymphocytes, or macrophage s using the Dako 22C3 antibody , found in 55% of patients, 
enriched for patients who res ponded to pembrolizum ab in the KEY NOTE-059, improving 
response rate among microsatel lite stable or unknown subjects t o 13.3%, and accelerated 
approval was granted for pembro lizumab in refractory gastric or  GE junction PD-L1+ 
adenocarcinomas. Nevertheless, f urther improvement in biomarker s and strategies to potentiate 
the immune response and efficacy of immune checkpoint therapy i n more subjects for a longer 
duration are needed.  There is significant rationale for combini ng immune checkpoint antibodies with HER2-directed 
therapy like trastuzumab. Preclin ical studies demonstrated that  anti-HER2 antibody therapy 
requires an intact immune system , including IFN-γ secreting CD8 + T-cells, for efficacy, and in 
mouse models of HER2-amplified br east cancer, co-treatment with  anti-HER2 and anti-PD1 
antibodies caused significant tu mor regression[11]. The immune response to trastuzumab was 
significantly associated with improved responses in HER2-positi ve breast cancers, providing 
further evidence that a major m echanism of trastuzumab’s effica cy is harnessing the adaptive 
immune response [12]. Importantly, in HER2-amplified gastroesop hageal cancer models, 
cytotoxic T lymphocytes direc ted against HER2 also depend on in tact tumoral cellular antigen-
processing machinery [13]. Chemo therapy can also facilitate tum or antigen presentation and 
immune response, including reports of humoral immune responses after 5-fluorouracil[14] or 
oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy r egimens [15, 16]. Moreover, HER 2-amplified gastroesophageal 
cancers have significantly gr eater expressi on of PD-L1 [17, 18] . Many ongoing clinical trials of 
immune checkpoint inhibitors in gastroesophageal cancers, inclu ding all the key ongoing first-
line trials with chemotherapy ( i.e. KEYNOTE-062, JAVELIN Gastri c 100), exclude HER2-
amplified patients. Thus, HER2-amp lified patients represent an understudied cohort within the 
increasingly crowded gastroesophageal cancer space.  To potentiate benefit with ant i-HER2 therapy, it would be ideal  to administer immune 
checkpoint antibodies with first -line therapy, as there is no c lear role for con tinuation of HER2-
directed therapy after progre ssion.  Several post-progression s tudies have been negative, 
including the second-line TYTAN tr ial of lapatinib [19] and the  GATSBY [CONTACT_676057]-line T-
DM1 vs. taxane [20]. Though mechan isms of resistance remain unc lear, data from a single 
institution indicates that 35%  of patients with a repeat biopsy  post-progression indeed had lost 
HER2 positivity [21]. This woul d not be surprising given that t
here is marked intratumoral 
heterogeneity of HER2 staining e ven at diagnosis [22], and so o utgrowth of HER2-
nonexpressing subclones under the se lective pressure of anti-HE R2 antibody is not unexpected. 
However, there is em erging data that target ed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_676042] e tumor antigen presentation and 
can potentiate the antitumor adap tive immune response, motivati ng combinations of targeted 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_676043]. Indeed, combining BRAF and MEK inhibitors 
with anti-PD1 therapy is effectiv e in a mouse model of BRAF mut ant melanoma[23] and is 
being studied in several early ph ase clinical trials[24]. Indee d, this work is now being extended 
into GI cancers, with ongoing promis ing trials combining atezol izumab and cobimetinib in

immune checkpoint inhibitors with HER2-directed therapy in the second-line setting. 
 The combination of chemotherapy with FOLFOX and immune checkpoi nt inhibitors is 
undergoing testing in a variet y of indications but has generall y been well tolerated. Notably, 
combinations of capecitabine, c isplatin, trastuzumab, and pembr olizumab are also starting 
clinical evaluation (NCT 02954536, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), reflecting the promise of this strategy. 
Notably, a combination of 5-fluor ouracil and oxa liplatin (i.e. FOLFOX) is the preferred systemic 
chemotherapy for patients with met astatic gastroesophageal canc er, and though in practice 
clinicians often extrapolate results from trials of cisplatin/c apecitabine, there may well be 
confounding due to the alternativ e chemotherapy backbone and di fferential toxicities and 
supportive care measures (like cor ticosteroids) that likely nee d to be employed with the highly 
emetogenic cisplatin, as oppose d to the less emetogenic oxalipl atin. Several trials have reported 
on the safety and feasibility of c ombinations of FOLFOX with PD -1 or PD-L1 antibody therapy, 
including atezolizumab and pembro lizumab, and multiple studies combining 
chemoimmunotherapy with PD-1 or P D-L1 antibodies are ongoing, i ncluding an ongoing clinical 
trial of FOLFOX + cetuximab + ave lumab in colorectal cancer (NC T03174405). Moreover,

Initially we proposed a multi-cen ter single-arm open-label Simo n’s two-stage Phase II clinical 
trial of first-line mFOLFOX6 + t rastuzumab + avelumab in metast atic HER2-amplified gastric 
and esophageal adenocarcinomas, f ollowing an initial safety run -in of six patients. Archival 
tissue and longitudinal periphera l blood samples were collected  from all patients to facilitate 
study using UNC’s robust immunogeno mics translational program a nd facilities to perform 
extensive correlative studies t o help identify potential biomar kers. Accrual will halt after 
completion of Stage I (enroll ment of 18 patient s). Subjects cur rently on treatment will continue

inappropriate for ent ry into this study. 
 4. SUBJECT REGISTRATION All subjects must be registered through HCRN’s electronic data capture (EDC) system. Subjects 
must be registered prior to sta rting protocol therapy. Subjects  must begin therapy within 28 days  
of registration.  5. TREATMENT PLAN The initial intent of the study w as to be a multi-center single -arm open-label Simon’s two-stage 
Phase II clinical trial of first- line mFOLFOX6 + trastuzumab + avelumab in metastatic HER2-
amplified gastric and eso phageal adenocarcinomas.   
 Accrual will halt afte r completion of Stage I  (enrollment of 18  patients). This decision is not due 
to safety issues. Subjects currently on treatment will continue  until criteria as defined in Section 
6.7 is met.  5.1 Treatment Administration for Induction  
The order of administration f or study treatment during inductio n is avelumab, trastuzumab then 
mFOLFOX6. Subjects should recei ve 9 cycles of induction therapy  with avelumab, trastuzumab, 
and mFOLFOX6, regardless of wheth er they received a cycle of mF OLFOX6 +/- trastuzumab 
immediately prior to r egistration. If a cycl e of mFOLFOX6 +/- t rastuzumab is given prior to 
registration, loading dose of tra stuzumab will not be repeated.   
 An infusion window of ± 10 minutes  may be applied to the avelum ab. Institutional standards for 
infusion and infusion window ma y be applied to trastuzumab and mFOLFOX6. Body surface 
area (BSA) should be recalculate d for change in weight based on  institutional standards. A

 5.4 Pre-medication and Hydrat ion for Study Treatment 
 5.4.1 Avelumab Premedication: In orde r to mitigate infusi on related reactions,  a premedication with an 
antihistamine and with paraceta mol (acetaminophen) [ADDRESS_913926] 4 
infusions of avelumab is manda tory (for example, 25-50 mg diphe nhydramine and 500-650 mg 
paracetamol IV or oral). Preme dication should be administered f or subsequent avelumab 
infusions based upon clinical judgm ent and presence/severity of  prior infusion r eactions. This 
may be modified based on local t reatment standards and guidelin es, as appropriate.  
 Avelumab should be administered i n a setting that allows for im mediate access to an intensive 
care unit or equivalent environm ent and administration of thera py for anaphylaxis, such as the 
ability to implement immediate resuscitation measures. Steroids  (dexamethasone 10 mg), 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (1:1,000 dilution), al lergy medications (IV antihis tamines), bronchodilators, or 
equivalents, and oxygen should be ava ilable for immediate acces s. Following avelumab

Medications or vaccinations speci fically prohibited in the excl usion criteria are not allowed 
during the ongoing trial.  If ther e is a clinical  indication fo r one of these or other medications or 
vaccinations specifically prohi bited during the trial, disconti nuation from trial therapy or 
vaccination may be required.  The final decision on any support ive therapy or vacc ination rests 
with the investigator and/or the subject's pr imary physician. T he following medications are 
prohibited while receiving protocol therapy: 
• Systemic anticancer o r biological therapy. 
• Immunotherapy not specifi ed in this protocol. 
• Chemotherapy not specifi ed in this protocol. 
• Systemic glucocorticoids for a ny purpose other than to manage s ymptoms of suspected 
immune-related adverse events of interest (irAEIs) or emergent management of serious 
infusion/allergic reactions. ( NOTE:  Use of inhaled steroids, lo cal injection of steroids, 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_8826], and steroid eye  drops are allowed). If medica lly deemed necessary (eg, 
acute asthma or chronic obstruc tive pulmonary disease exacerbat ion), Investigators are 
allowed to use their judgment to t reat patients with systemic s teroids. In such cases, 
systemic steroids s hould be stopped at lea st 24 hours prior to the next dose of avelumab. 
• Live vaccines within [ADDRESS_913928] dose of study t reatment. Seasonal flu 
vaccines that do not contain live viruses are allowed. Examples  of live vaccines include, 
but are not limited to, the follo wing: measles , mumps, rubella,  chicken pox, yellow fever, 
rabies, bacille Calme tte-Guerin, and typhoid (oral) vaccine. Se asonal influenza vaccines 
for injection are generally kill ed virus vaccines and are allow ed. Intranasal influenza 
vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines and are  not allowed. 
 
5.6 Supportive Care

5.7 Hypersensitivity/Infusion Reactions 
 5.7.1 Avelumab 
 
NCI-CTCAE Grade  Treatment Modification for Avelumab 
Grade 1 – mild 
Mild transient reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; intervention not indicated. Decrease the avelumab infusion rate by 50% and 
monitor closely for any worsening. 
Grade 2 – moderate Therapy or infusion interruption indicated but 
responds promptly to symptomatic treatment 
(for example, antihistamines, NSAIDs, narcotics, IV fluids); p rophylactic medications 
indicated for ≤ 24 h. Temporarily discontinue avelumab infusion. 
Resume infusion at 50% of previous rate once infusion-related reaction h as resolved or decreased 
to at least Grade 1 in severity, and monitor closely for any worsening. 
Grade 3 or Grade 4 – severe or life-threatening Grade 3: Prolonged (for example, not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_676047]/or 
brief interruption of infusion); recurrence of symptoms following initial improvement; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_79806]. 
 Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent 
intervention indicated. Stop avelumab infusion immediately and 
disconnect infusion tubing from the subject. Subjects have to be withdrawn immediately from study avelumab and must not receive any further 
avelumab treatment. 
If avelumab infusion rate has b een decreased by 50% or interrup ted due to an infusion reaction, it 
must remain decreased for the n ext scheduled infusion.  If no i nfusion reaction is observed in the next 
scheduled infusion, the  infusion rate may be returned to baseli ne at the subsequent  infusions based on 
investigator’s medical judgment. If hypersensitivity reaction o ccurs, the subject must be treated 
according to the best available medical practice.

 9. CRITERIA FOR DISEASE EVALUATION For the purposes of this study, pa tients should be re-evaluated  for response per the study 
calendar. Response and progression will be evaluated in this st udy using the intern ational criteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_676067] T umors (RECIST) Committee 
(version 1.1) (see Eisenhauer EA et al. New response evaluation criteria in solid tumours: 
revised RECIST guideline (version 1.1). Eur J Can, 2009.45:p.228-247) and the iRECIST 
criteria. See Seymour, L. et al. i RECIST: guidelines for respon se criteria for use in trials testing

9.2 Non-measurable Lesions All other lesions (or sites of di sease), including small lesion s (longest diameter <10 mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with ≥  10 to <15 mm short axis), are c onsidered non-measurable 
disease. Bone lesions, leptomeni ngeal disease, ascites, pleural /pericardial effusi ons, lymphangitis 
cutis/pulmonitis, inflammator y breast disease, and abdominal ma sses (not followed by [CONTACT_118445]), are considered as non-measurable.  NOTE:   Cystic lesions that meet the c riteria for radiographically de fined simple cysts should not 
be considered as malignant lesi ons (neither measurable nor non- measurable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_108], simple cysts. ‘Cys tic lesions’ thought to represent  cystic metastases can be considered 
as measurable lesions, if they m eet the definition of measurabi lity described above. However, if 
non-cystic lesions are present i n the same subject, these are p referred for sele ction as target 
lesions.  9.3 Target Lesions All measurable lesions up to a  maximum of 2 lesions per organ a nd 5 lesions in total, 
representative of all involve d organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and 
measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the 
longest diameter), be represent ative of all involved organs, bu t in addition should be those that 
lend themselves to reproducible  repeated measurements. It may b e the case that, on occasion, the 
Clinical Study Protocol 
HCRN GI17-319 
Version Date: 29SEP2020 Confidential Page [ADDRESS_913982] lesion which can be m easured reproducibly should be sel ected. A sum of the diameters 
(longest for non-nodal lesions, shor t axis for nodal lesions) f or all target lesions will be 
calculated and reported as the ba seline sum diameters. If lymph  nodes are to be included in the 
sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseli ne sum diameters will be used as 
reference to further characterize any objective tumor regressio n in the measurable dimension of 
the disease.  9.4 Non-target Lesions All other lesions (or sites of di sease) including any measurabl e lesions over and above the [ADDRESS_913983] ed at baseline. 
Measurements of these lesions a re not required, but the presenc e, absence, or in rare cases 
unequivocal progression of eac h should be noted throughout foll ow-up. 
 9.5 Evaluation of Target Lesions NOTE:  In addition to the informatio n below, also see section 4.3.2 i n the international criteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_676068] (R ECIST) Committee, version 
1.1 (Eur J Cancer 45;2009:228-247)  for special notes on the ass essment of target lesions.  
 
Complete 
Response (CR) Disappearance of all target l esions. Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or non-targ et) must have reduction in 
short axis to <10 mm.
Partial Response (PR) At least a 30% decrease in the s um of the diameters of target 
lesions, takin
g as reference the baseline sum diameters 
Progressive 
Disease (PD) At least a 20% increase in the s um of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference th e smallest sum on study (this 
includes the baseline sum if th at is the smallest on study). In  
addition to the relative increas e of 20%, the sum must also 
demonstrate an absolute increase  of at least 5 mm. (Note:  the 
appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered 
progressions).
Stable Disease (SD) Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR  nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taki ng as reference th e smallest su m

Version Date: 29SEP2020 Confidential Page 39 of 60 9.6 Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR) Disappear ance of all non-target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marke r level. All lymph nodes 
must be non-pathological in s ize (<10 mm short axis) 
 NOTE:   If tumor markers are initially above the 
upper normal limit, they mu st normalize for a subject 
to be considered in comp lete clinical response. 
Non-CR/ Non-PD Persistence of one  or more non-target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor mar ker level above the normal 
limits
Progressive Disease (PD) Appear ance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of  existing non-target 
lesions. Unequivocal progr ession should not normally 
trump target lesion s tatus. It must be representative of 
overall disease status c hange, not a single lesion 
increase.
 Although a clear progression of “no n-target” lesions only is ex ceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_227762] s uch circumstances, and the prog ression status should be

*In exceptional circumstances, unequivocal progression in non-t arget lesions may be

Subjects with a global deteriora tion of health status requiring  discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of dis ease progression at that time should be classified as having 
“symptomatic deterioration.” Eve ry effort should be made to doc ument the objective progression 
even after discontin uation of treatment. 
 In some circumstances, it may be  difficult to d istinguish resid ual disease from normal tissue. 
When the evaluation of complete response depends on this determ ination, it is r ecommended that 
the residual lesion be investigat ed (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biops y) to confirm the complete response 
status.

fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin. These  drugs are commercially ava ilable and will be dispensed as 
such for this study. For more in formation on these agents, refe r to the FDA approved package 
inserts.  10.1.1 Oxaliplatin Oxaliplatin is a platinum alkyl ating agent, which contains plat inum complexed to oxalate and 
diaminocyclohexane (DACH) comp lex. Platinum complexes are forme d intracellularly and 
inhibit DNA synthesis through cova lent binding of DNA molecules  to form intrastrand and 
interstrand DNA cross-links. Oxa liplatin differs molecularly, f rom other platinum s (cisplatin and 
carboplatin), by [CONTACT_676069]-resistance with ot her platinum compounds. Cytotox icity is cell-cycle nonspecific. 
Oxaliplatin is a radiat ionsensitizing agent.  
 *Oxaliplatin is inco mpatible with 0.9% Na Cl. *Oxaliplatin is in compatible in solution with 
alkaline medications or media a nd must not be mixed with these.   *Storage and handling 
materials containing aluminum par ts that may come in contact [CONTACT_676070] o f the drug, as aluminum can deg rade platinum compounds. 
 1) The lyophilized powder is reconstituted by [CONTACT_1583] 10 mL (for  the 50 mg vial) or 20 mL (for 
the 100 mg vial) of Water for I njection, USP or 5% Dextrose Inj ection, USP. Do not administer 
the reconstituted solutio n without further dilution.   
 2) After reconstitution in the original vial, the solution may be stored up to 24 hours under 
refrigeration [2º to 8°C (36º to 46° F)]. Do not freeze the con centrated solution. 
 3) The solution must be further  diluted in an inf usion solution  of 250-[ADDRESS_913985] be between 0.2 to 0.7 mg/mL.  
Clinical Study Protocol 
HCRN GI17-319 
Version Date: 29SEP2020 Confidential Page 41 of 60 4) After final dilution with D5W , the shelf life is 6 hours at room temperature [20º to 25°C (68º 
to 77°F)] or up to 24 hours under re frigeration [2º to 8°C (36º  to 46°F)].  
 5) Store under normal lighting cond itions at 20°-25°C (68°-77°F ); excursions permitted to 15-
30°C (59- 86°F)]. Do not freeze.  10.1.2 Leucovorin Leucovorin calcium (folinic acid) is a reduced form of folic ac id. It is usually used 24 hours after 
methotrexate to selectively “resc ue” normal cells from the adve rse effects of methotrexate 
caused by [CONTACT_676071]. It is no t used simultaneously with 
methotrexate, as it might then nu llify the therapeutic effect o f the methotrexate. Leucovorin has 
also been used to enhance the activity of fluorouracil by [CONTACT_676072]. Leucovorin is available in D and L 
stereoisomers; the L stereoi somer is the active moiety. 
 * Each 50, 100, and 200 mg vial of Leucovorin when reconstitute d with 5, 10, and 20 mL, 
respectively, of sterile diluent  yields a leucovorin concentrat ion of 10 mg per mL. Each 350 mg 
vial of Leucovorin when recons tituted with 17.5 mL of sterile d iluent yields a leucovorin 
concentration of 20 mg per mL. *L eucovorin should not be mixed in the same infusion as 
fluorouracil as a prec ipi[INVESTIGATOR_314963]. 
 1) Reconstitute the lyophilize d vial products with Bacteriostat ic Water for Injection, USP 
(benzyl alcohol preserved), or S terile Water for Injection, USP .  When reconstituted with 
Bacteriostatic Water for Injec tion, the resulti ng solution must  be used within [ADDRESS_913986] any unused 
portion. Because of the benzyl al cohol contained in Bacteriosta tic Water for Injection, when 
doses greater than 10 mg /m2 are administered, Leucovorin should  be reconstituted with Sterile 
Water for Injection, and used immediately. 
 2) Dilute leucovorin in 50-1000 mL D5W or NS for infusion. Leco vorin may be mixed in 50mL 
NS or D5W minibag (doses up to 50 0mg) or 100mL minibag (doses > 500mg) or in 100mL fluid 
in graduated administration set ( D5W, NS or 2/3-1/3).  Parenter al admixture is stable for 24 
hours stored at room temperature  (25°C) and for 4 days when sto red under refrigeration (4°C).  
 3) Lyophilized powder vials shoul d be stored at 20° to 25°C (68 ° to 77° F). Solution for injection 
should be stored in refrigerator  2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F).  Prot ect from light. Retai n in carton until 
time of use.    10.1.3 5 Fluorouracil Fluorouracil was developed based o n the observation that tumor cells utilized the  base pair uracil 
for DNA synthesis more efficien tly than did normal cells of the  intestinal mucosa. It is a 
fluorinated pyrimidine antimetab olite that is metabolized intra cellularly to its active form, 
fluorouridine monophosphate (FdUMP) . The active form inhibits D NA synthesis by [CONTACT_676073]. Effects on RNA (incorporation 
into RNA and RNA inhibition) occur especially with bolus admini stration. Fluorouracil is cell 
cycle phase-specific (S-phase).

 Trastuzumab is a humanized IgG 1 kappa monoclonal antibody that selectively binds with high 
affinity to the extracellular  domain of the human epi[INVESTIGATOR_294781] 2 protein, 
HER2. Trastuzumab is produced by [CONTACT_94988] a mammalian cell (Chinese 
Hamster Ovary) culture containi ng the antibiotic gentamicin. Ge ntamicin is not detectable in the 
final product. The HER2 (or c-erb B2) proto-oncogene encodes a t ransmembrane receptor protein 
of 185 kDa, which is structurally  related to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_607366]. Trastuzumab 
has been shown, in both in vitro a ssays and in animals, to inhi
bit the proliferation of human 
tumor cells that overexpress HER2.

Clinical Study Protocol 
HCRN GI17-319 
Version Date: 29SEP2020 Confidential Page [ADDRESS_914000] udy was to be a prospective, open- label, single arm, multi-center phase 
2 clinical trial of avelumab + tra stuzumab + mFOLFOX6 in first- line, metastatic, HER2-
amplified gastric and esophageal  adenocarcinomas. Accrual will halt after enrollment of 18 
subjects (completion of Stage I). This decision is not due to s afety issues. Subjects currently on 
treatment will continue until cr iteria as defined in Section 6. [ADDRESS_914001] obj ective response rate (CR or PR, 
ORR) in these patients within [ADDRESS_914002] 1.1 criteria.  Secondary objectives include; 
estimating PFS by [CONTACT_423474] 1.[ADDRESS_914003] criteria, estimat ing OS, estimating the disease 
control rate (DCR) at [ADDRESS_914004], and c haracterizing the safety 
issues associated with this re gimen. Exploratory objectives inv olve investigating various 
biomarkers and peripheral  blood and tumor assays. 
 12.2 Sample Size and Accrual 
The objective response rate of tre atment with mFOLFOX6 + trastu zumab alone (per ToGA) is 
approximately 47%. The objective re sponse rate of the treatment  regimen which contains the 
addition of avelumab to mFOLFOX6 +  trastuzumab is expected to b e 65%. A Simon two-stage 
optimal design will be used, with alpha = 0.05 and 80% power, a nd with the null and alternative 
hypothesis response rates of  47% and 65%, respectively.  
 In the first stage, 18 evaluable patients will be enrolled and treated. If only 9 (or less) of these [ADDRESS_914005] stage. 
 The intent was that if 10 (or mo re) responses are observed, the n another 39 patients would be 
enrolled and treated in the second stage, for a total of 57 eva luable patients. If only 32 patients 
(or less) of the final total  of [ADDRESS_914006] and would therefore jus tify further development. Assum ing a possible 10% consent and 
not treat or loss to follow-up r ate, a total of 63 patients wer e planned for accrual. Accrual was 
expected to take approximately 22 months.   12.3 Toxicity Monitoring 
Toxicity will be assessed using N CI CTCAE version 5. Patients w ill be monitored for excessive 
toxicity over the duration of the  study. A toxicity rate due to  the study regimen greater than 35% 
would be considered unacceptable (with a desired probability of  early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_31081] 0.05). Toxicity 
events that will be monitored are  defined as thos e that call fo r permanent discontinuation of 
avelumab, as defined in Secti on 6.3 or any grade 3- 4 treatment- related adverse events that

Clinical Study Protocol 
HCRN GI17-319 
Version Date: 29SEP2020 Confidential Page [ADDRESS_914007] (DS MB) will be alerted. The DSMB ( in consultation with the 
sponsor-investigator) will evalua te the toxicity events to help  determine whether or not to 
terminate the study.  Accrual to the trial is to be suspended if the number of protoc ol defined toxic events as defined 
above is equal to or larger t han boundary in the table below. 
 
N u m b e r  o f  P a t i e n t s  [ADDRESS_914008] 1.1 will be considered responders. Consequently, for all  subjects who discontinue study 
treatment before documentation of  progression, every effort sho uld be made to document the 
objective progression even after  discontinuation of treatment. 
 
12.6 Definitions 
• Best Objective Response Rate ( bORR): The best objective respons e rate will be defined 
as the total number of patie nts whose best response by 24 weeks  are either a CR or PR 
divided by [CONTACT_676075]  
• Progression Free Survival (PFS): A patient’s progr ession-free s urvival (PFS) will be 
defined as the time fr om the start date of  treatment to the dat e of documented progression 
or death. Any patient who has rece ived study treatment but has neither progressed nor 
died will be censored on the da te the patient was known to be a live and progression free. 
• Overall Survival (OS): A patient ’s survival time will be define d as the time from start of 
treatment to the date of his or he r death. If the patient has n ot died, survival will be 
censored on last date the pa tient was known to be alive.  
• Disease Control Rate (DCR): The disease control rate used to he lp determine clinical 
benefit will be defined as the to tal number of patients whose r esponses are either a CR, 
PR, or SD divided by [CONTACT_676076].  Patients will need to be 
at least a SD for at [ADDRESS_914009] received  clinical benefit from the 
treatment regimen

bORR and DCR will be calculated and reported wit h their corresp onding 95% confidence 
intervals. PFS and OS estimates w ill be calculated using the Ka plan-Meier method. The primary 
analysis will apply to the tota l number of efficacy-evaluable p atients. Toxicity and safety 
information will be reported in a  descriptive manner in the for m of frequency tables. Adverse 
events will be classified and gr aded according to the National Cancer Institute’s Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version 5.0). 
 Hypothesis generating explorator y analyses will be performed wh en appropriate sample size 
considerations allow. Baseline tu mor studies may include PD-L1 expression, degree of HER2 
amplification, sequencing of low -diversity B and T cell recepto rs, and RNASeq to include 
deconvolution of immune cell infi ltrates. Changes in circulatin g markers of immune activation 
and circulating tumor DNA levels will be evaluated using periph eral blood samples  collected at 
baseline, at first restagin g, and at the end of treatment. 
 [ADDRESS_914010] (DSMB).  The DSMB is chaired by [CONTACT_676077]. The DSMB  will meet quarterly during the 
active treatment and safety fo llow-up portion of the trial to r eview information. The DSMB will 
provide a recommendation to the s ponsor-investiga tor after all information is reviewed.  
The DSMB review will incl ude but is not limited to: 
• Adverse event summary report 
• Audit results if applicable 
• Data related to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/decisi on rules described in study desi gn 
• Study accrual patterns

 14.1 Data Management 
HCRN will serve as the Clinical R esearch Organization for this trial. Data will be collected 
through a web based clinical resea rch platform (EDC system), a system compliant with Good 
Clinical Practices and Federal  Rules and Regulations. HCRN pers onnel will coordinate and 
manage data for quality control a ssurance and in tegrity. Select  data will be collected and entered 
into the EDC system by [CONTACT_197472] e personnel from participating institutions.   
 14.2 Case Report Forms and Submission 
Generally, clinical data will be e lectronically captured in the  EDC system and correlative results 
will be captured in EDC system
 or other secure database(s). If  procedures on the study calenda r 
are performed for sta ndard of care, at min imum, that data will be captured in the source 
document. Select standard of care data will also be captured in  the EDC system, according to 
study-specific objectives.   The completed dataset is the sol e property of the sponsor-inves tigator’s institution and should 
not be exported to third parties, e xcept for authorized represe ntatives of appropriate 
Health/Regulatory Authorities, w ithout permissio n from the spon sor-investigator and HCRN.

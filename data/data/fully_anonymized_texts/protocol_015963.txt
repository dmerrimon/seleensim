  09/29/2023 Page 4 of 76 Design  This is a randomized, double -masked, placebo -controlled, 
multicenter, Phase 3 study in approximately 320 subjects with 
presby[CONTACT_19555]. The study will be performed in 2 stages . 
Subjects will be  randomized 1:1:1:1 to treatments for both stages 
at Visit 1 (Screening/Baseline). Note that Visit 1 
(Screening/Baseline) assessments are recommended to be 
performed on the same day; however, in instances in which 
subject s are unable to complete the full day of assessments  for 
Visit [ADDRESS_727826] of 2  treatment groups (Nyxol or placebo  [ie, 
Nyxol vehicle] ), with approximately 160 subjects in each group. 
Stage 2 consists of 4  treatment groups (Nyxol + LDP, Nyxol +  
LDP vehicle, placebo + LDP , and placebo + LDP vehicle) , with 
approximately 80  subjects per treatment group.  
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_60230]/dark irides . The number 
of subjects in each irides type  should be as close as possible to 
1:1, with a minimum of 40% within each strat um. The subjects 
will be recruited from approximately 30 investigational sites  in 
the U nited States. 
Stage 1:  Dosing of Treatment 1  
In Stage 1, the safety and efficacy of Nyxol as a single agent will 
be evaluated following 1 day and 7 days of daily dosing , in which 
Treatment 1 ( Nyxol  or placebo)  is dosed daily in the evenings 
near bedtime  starting with the day after completion of Visit 1 , 
except for Visit 1 [Stage 1 Day 1], when the subject is dosed 
during the day at the study site , and the evening before Visit 2 , 
when Treatment  1 is dosed as close to 12 hours prior to Time 0 
min at Visit 2 . 
Following Visit 2 (Stage 1 Day 8) , subjects will discontinue 
dosing Treatment 1 for 7 to 14 days  (Washout Period) . During the 
Washout Period, subjects will return for Visit  3 (Stage 1 Day 10 ± 
1 day) to assess  the resolution of drug treatment effects  on PD . 
During Stage 1, subjects will dose with Treatment 1 (Nyxol or 
placebo [ie, Nyxol vehicle]) in the evenings  near bedtime  starting 
with the day after completion of Visit 1 , except  for Visit 1 [Stage 
1 Day 1 ], when the subject is dosed during the day at the study 
Ocuphire Pharma, Inc. Clinical Protocol OPI-NYXP-301 VEGA-2   
  09/29/2023 Page 5 of 76 site, and the evening before Visit 2 , when Treatment 1 is dosed as 
close to 12 hours prior to Time 0 min at Visit 2 .  
Stage 2:  Dosing of Treatmen ts 1 and  2 
Visit 4 (Stage 2 Day 1) is the start of Stage 2. In Stage 2, the 
efficacy and safety of Nyxol + LDP will be evaluated following 
1 day and 7 days of dosing , in which  Treatment 1 ( Nyxol  or 
placebo)  is dosed daily in the evening s near bedtime , except the 
evening before Visit s 4 and 5 , when Treatment 1 is dosed as close 
to 12 hours prior to the scheduled time for those visits . Treatment 
2 (LDP  or LDP vehicle)  is dosed daily in the morning s. Treatment 
2 will be dosed at the study site at the beginning of Visits 4 and 5 
(Stage 2 Days 1 and 8 , respectiv ely).  
Other design considerations:  
Study medications (Treatment s 1 and 2 ) will each be dosed as a 
single drop in each eye , with Treatment  1 dosed  in the evening s 
near bedtime  and Treatment  2 dosed  in the morning s. Baseline for 
the study is defined as pre -treatment (prior to Time 0 min) at 
Visit  1 (Screening/Baseline).  
During  Visit 2  (Stage 1 Day 8) , Time [ADDRESS_727827] efficacy assessments at the visit, approximately 
12 hours after dosing with Nyxol the previous night ([ADDRESS_727828]-dose timepoint). During Visits 4 and 5  (Stage 2 Days 1 and 
8, respectively) , Time 0 min is defined as the time of Treatment 2 
administration.  
The study eye is defined as the eligible eye with worse baseline 
DCNVA at Visit 1 (Screening/Baseline). In the case where both 
eyes have the same Baseline DCNVA,  then the eye with the better 
BCDVA will be the study eye. If both DCNVA and BCDVA are 
equivalent between eyes, the study eye will be the right eye (OD).  
The study eye and fellow eye will both be evaluated at all 
assessments.  The baseline values  are determined during Screening 
assessments at Visit 1.  
Stage 1: Evaluation of Nyxol single agent  
At Visit 1 (Screening/Baseline), eligible subjects will be 
randomized, and the first dose of Treatment 1 will be 
administered  (note : if Visit 1 is split into 2 separate days , then 
dosing occurs on the second day ). Efficacy and safety 
measurements are made before  dosing with T reatment 1 (Time 0 
min) and at multiple post -dose timepoints from  30 min to 8 hours. 
Prior to discharge following  completion of Visit 1  (Stage 1 Day 
1), Treatment [ADDRESS_727829] before bedtime , to 
begin the night of Stage 1 Day 2.  
Ocuphire Pharma, Inc. Clinical Protocol OPI-NYXP-301 VEGA-2   
  09/29/[ADDRESS_727830] will dose Treatment 1 
study medication as close to 12 hours prior to the scheduled time 
for that v isit.  
At Visit 2 ( Stage 1 Day 8), efficacy and safety measurements will 
be made at 12 hours after the dose of Treatment 1 study 
medication (12 -hour endpoint). After completion of these 
assessments , the subject will take no study drug for 7 to 
14 days  (during the Washout Period),  after which Stage 1 is 
complete. Measurements will be made on Visit 3 ( Stage 1 Day 10 
± 1 day) during the Washout Period to assess the absence of 
residual treatment effects.  
Stage 2: Evaluation of Nyxol + LDP  
Subjects will restart dosing daily with Treatment 1 in the evening 
immediately prior to Visit 4 (Stage 2 Day 1 ) as close to 12 hours 
prior to the scheduled time for Visit 4 for the 12 -hour 
assessments. At this visit, after completion of the 12 -hour 
assessments for Treatment 1, subjects will be administered their 
morning dose of Treatment 2 (at Time 0 min) at the study site , 
and e fficacy and safety measurements will be made at multiple 
post-dose timepoints over the next 8 hours. During Stage 2 , 
subjects will  administer Treatment 1 in the evening s near bedtime 
and Treatment 2 in the morning s from the evening prior to Visit 4 
(Stage 2 Day 1) for the next 7 days  or until the evening before 
their scheduled Visit 5 (Stage 2 Day 8). On the evening prior to 
Visit [ADDRESS_727831]-dose timepoints over 8 hours after dosing with 
Treatment 2.  Study Drug Dispensing

INTRODUCTION In this study, the efficacy of Nyxol (Phentolamine Ophthalmic Solution [POS] 0.75%) as a single agent and the combination of Nyxol and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_553877] 0.4% (Low-Dose Pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227], LDP) in improving distance-corrected near visual acuity (DCNVA) will be evaluated in presby[CONTACT_463302].  3.1. Findings From Nonclinical and Clinical Studies Nyxol Detailed findings from nonclinical and clinical studies for phentolamine mesylate or phentolamine ophthalmic solutions and potential risks are provided in the Investigators’ Brochure (IB) (2022).  Nyxol has been studied in a total of 12 clinical trials (three Phase 1, five Phase 2, and four Phase 3) enrolling over 1100 subjects (including subjects 3 years of age and up, with over 650 subjects treated with Nyxol) and has demonstrated promising clinical data for use in multiple ophthalmic indications.  In prior clinical trials, Nyxol has demonstrated a consistent ability to decrease pupil diameter (PD) by [CONTACT_3450] 20% - 30%  (~1-1.5 mm) in both mesopic and photopic conditions (1-3). Nyxol has been found to be efficacious for more than 24 hours, with an onset of action of approximately 30 to 60 min. Nyxol has been observed to be well tolerated at single doses and multiple doses up to 14 days. Safety of the subjects in these trials was evaluated by [CONTACT_60235] (AE) monitoring, physical examinations, and vital sign assessments. Across all trials, no serious adverse events (SAEs) have been reported. No deaths occurred in any of the trials. No clinically meaningful changes were observed in physical examinations or vital signs, including blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). Adverse events reported were mild to moderate in intensity, with the most common being transient conjunctival hyperemia (eye redness) and ocular irritation; however, Nyxol dosing at or near bedtime was observed to mitigate or minimize these side effects during the daytime. The VEGA-1 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of Nyxol in combination with LDP and as a single agent in presby[CONTACT_463302]. The study met its primary and many secondary endpoints.  Nyxol + LDP showed a favorable safety profile with no serious AEs. Most AEs were mild, with no headaches, no browaches, and no blurry vision AEs reported. Mild, transient conjunctival hyperemia AEs were reported in < 5% of subjects. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_553884] A detailed report of pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227], its product label, properties, and potential risk are provided in the IB (2022). Pi[INVESTIGATOR_143566] (PCH) has been studied in a prior clinical trial by [CONTACT_60248]. In addition, there is a recently approved PCH drug at 1.25% and extensive literature on pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227]’s ability to reduce PD across various concentrations. These pupil-constricting effects, however, are counteracted by a dose-dependent side effect profile, notably browache and stinging in the eye upon topi[INVESTIGATOR_208655].  In an effort to better characterize an efficacious dose of PCH that would have minimal side effects, Ocuphire conducted an expansive review of the medical literature concerning experiments of various doses of PCH and their effects on PD and side effect profile. Leavitt et al. found that

  09/29/[ADDRESS_727853] with dilute concentrations of 0.25% and 0.125% pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227] (1.7 and 0.6 mm, respectively) but constrict insignificantly at concentrations of 0.0313% and 0.0625% (4). These decreases in PD were found to occur within 15 min of dosing, and peak pupil size reduction occurred at 30 to 60 min (4). On the other hand, 2% pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227], although efficacious in decreasing PD by [CONTACT_8622] 3 mm, caused significant side effects, including worsened visual field and acuity (5). When considering the effects on PD and the potential side effects of higher doses of pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227], Ocuphire found that a range of 0.3% to 0.6% PCH may provide moderate efficacy with potentially limited side effects. Moreover, based on these data, Ocuphire has shown in its Phase [ADDRESS_727854] common in people over 40 years old (6). Patients experience blurred near vision, difficulty seeing in dim light, and eye strain. In young, healthy eyes, lenses are able to focus light from objects at different distances by a process called accommodation. During accommodation, the ciliary muscle surrounding the lens contracts, causing the lens to change shape, thus increasing the focusing power of the eye. This allows for dynamic, clear vision at both near and far distances. With increasing age, the lens becomes stiffer, which limits the eye’s ability to adjust its focus for reading or for other tasks that require clear vision at near distances.  Presby[CONTACT_245492] a significantly negative impact on quality of life (7), interfering with daily activities such as reading, use of computers or hand-held devices, and seeing the dashboard of a car. It is estimated that [ADDRESS_727855] presby[CONTACT_19555], and this number is expected to grow as the population above the age of 40 increases (8). Limitations of Existing Treatments for Presby[CONTACT_553931]™ (PCH 1.25%) has recently been approved for the treatment of presby[CONTACT_19555]. In two Phase 3 studies, Vuity met its primary outcome measure, with 31% and 26% of Vuity-treated subjects gaining [ADDRESS_727856]-dose compared to 8% and 11% of placebo-treated subjects. However, limitations to Vuity include limited duration of efficacy, with a need for twice daily dosing to achieve efficacy throughout the day; headache, browache, and burning/stinging associated with drug administration; accommodative spasm and risk of angle-closure glaucoma due to activation of the ciliary muscle; and risk of retinal detachment in subjects with high myopia (9).  Other available treatments for presby[CONTACT_245496], bifocals, gradients, bifocal contact [CONTACT_13276], and multifocal intraocular lenses (IOLs). Reading glasses can be inconvenient and must be taken off and put on frequently throughout the day to see objects at far and near distances, respectively. Many patients express frustration with losing or forgetting their reading glasses. Moreover, some patients find glasses unflattering, and contact [CONTACT_553932]. A small portion of patients elect surgical intervention, including laser treatment, to achieve monovision. The risks of such interventions include a potential decrease in contrast sensitivity and stereopsis and the creation or worsening of dim light vision disturbances.

  09/29/[ADDRESS_727857] consistently demonstrated that reducing pupil size to a diameter of approximately 2 to 3 mm will lead to significant improvement in presby[CONTACT_553933] (10-12). In multiple trials, it has been shown that Nyxol reduces PD by [CONTACT_3450] 20% to 30% and improves near visual acuity (VA) for at least 24 hours after a single application. OPI-NYXP-201 (VEGA-1) was a 7-day (2 visits), double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase [ADDRESS_727858] that treatment with Nyxol alone provides a ≥ 3-line benefit in DCNVA in a similar percent of subjects to that observed with Vuity, with better durability and a better safety profile. Nyxol with adjunctive LDP therapy resulted in a higher percentage of presby[CONTACT_553934] a gain of 3 or more lines of DCNVA, with increased durability and a better safety profile compared to those from the Vuity pi[INVESTIGATOR_6518]. A summary of the results of the VEGA-1 study are presented here. Efficacy Results From the VEGA-1 Study: Nyxol as a Single Agent Following 3 to 4 days of treatment with Nyxol or placebo, 30.1% of Nyxol-treated subjects had ≥ 15 letters of improvement in photopic binocular DCNVA compared with 13.5% of placebo-treated subjects [ADDRESS_727859] dose (p=0.0265). This benefit remained stable over the next 6 hours, with a mean of 36.7% of Nyxol-treated subjects improving by [ADDRESS_727860]-dose. In subjects with light irides, there was a 21.2% benefit of Nyxol treatment over placebo (p=0.0298) and subjects with dark irides had 10.0% more responders with Nyxol treatment compared with placebo (p=0.3771). Significantly more subjects treated with Nyxol achieved binocular DCNVA of 20/40 or better compared with placebo (56% vs 36%, respectively; p=0.0080).  Photopic binocular mean DCNVA showed significantly greater improvement in mean number of letters read among Nyxol-treated subjects (10.1-letter improvement) compared with placebo-treated subjects (5.6-letter improvement) at [ADDRESS_727861]-dose (p=0.0006). Consistent with these results, mean photopic PD in the best eye was significantly reduced among Nyxol-treated subjects compared with placebo-treated subjects at [ADDRESS_727862]-dose (p<0.0001). Nyxol + LDP as Adjunctive Therapy  A statistically significantly greater number of subjects in the Per Protocol (PP) Population treated with Nyxol + LDP had ≥ [ADDRESS_727863]-LDP treatment (primary endpoint) compared with placebo alone (60.45% vs 27.9%, respectively; p=0.0037). In addition, the Nyxol + LDP arm had significantly more subjects with ≥ [ADDRESS_727864]-LDP treatment (p≤0.0166 for each). This benefit was retained for all timepoints between 30 min and 4 hours when requiring that subjects with ≥ [ADDRESS_727865] < [ADDRESS_727866]-corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA), the accepted registration endpoint. The benefit of LDP adjunctive therapy to Nyxol was consistent regardless of iris color. The effect of Nyxol + LDP on DCNVA was rapid and clinically significant. By [ADDRESS_727867]-LDP treatment, 79% of subjects had photopic binocular DCNVA of 20/[ADDRESS_727868]-LDP 
Ocuphire Pharma, Inc. Clinical Protocol OPI-NYXP-301 VEGA-2   
  09/29/2023 Page 21 of 76 treatment, 84% of subjects had binocular DCNVA of 20/40 or better. Significantly more subjects treated with LDP adjunctive to Nyxol had photopic binocular DCNVA 20/40 or better compared with placebo at 30 min through 2 hours (p≤0.0119 for each).  Nyxol + LDP treatment resulted in more subjects achieving a ≥ 15-letter improvement in DCNVA compared with each of its components used individually at all timepoints from [ADDRESS_727869]-LDP treatment. Although the study was not statistically powered for this outcome, the percent of responders at 30 min with combination therapy (61%) was significantly greater than the response rate with LDP alone (26%; p=0.0076) or Nyxol alone (33%; p=0.0265). Safety Results From the VEGA-1 Study: Nyxol, when administered with LDP as adjunctive therapy or as a single agent, was well tolerated in this study. Fifty treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in 15 subjects (34.1%) treated with Nyxol + LDP, 4 TEAEs were reported in 2 subjects (4.4%) treated with placebo alone, 18 TEAEs were reported in 6 subjects (20.0%) treated with Nyxol alone, and 13 TEAEs were reported in 6 subjects (19.4%) treated with placebo + LDP. All subjects experienced mild TEAEs except for 3 subjects: 1 in the placebo alone arm and 2 in the Nyxol + LDP arm. All subjects had TEAEs that were considered possibly, probably, or definitely related to treatment, except for 2 subjects: 1 in the placebo alone arm had an unrelated TEAE and 1 in the Nyxol + LDP arm had a TEAE of unknown relatedness. One subject in the Nyxol + LDP arm had 2 TEAEs (mild conjunctival hyperemia and mild eye irritation) leading both to study medication discontinuation and withdrawal from the study. No subjects had any serious TEAEs, and no subjects died during the study.  3.3. Route of Administration, Dosage Regimen, and Treatment Period As the intended route of administration for Nyxol and its placebo and LDP and its placebo is topi[INVESTIGATOR_117927], this is the route to be used in this study.  The dose for 1 drop of Nyxol (POS 0.75%) selected for this study was based upon: 1) preclinical safety studies, 2) the results of the previous ophthalmic clinical studies described above and in the IB, and 3) clinical studies conducted with varying doses of drugs in the same class (13). Note that POS 0.75%, which expresses the phentolamine mesylate concentration as the free base, is the new nomenclature being used in place of Phentolamine Mesylate Ophthalmic Solution 1%, which was how Nyxol had been described in studies prior to 2020. The dose for 1 drop of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_553885] 0.4% (LDP). All treatments will be administered in both eyes (OU). 3.4. Compliance This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol and in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), the ethical principles set forth in the Declaration of Helsinki, and with the [LOCATION_002] (US) Code of Federal Regulations. 3.5. Study Population The study population for this trial will be comprised of males and females between 40 and 64 years of age with presby[CONTACT_19555]. A sample size of approximately 320 subjects will be randomized into 1 of 
Ocuphire Pharma, Inc. Clinical Protocol OPI-NYXP-301 VEGA-2   
  09/29/2023 Page 22 of 76 4 treatment arms, with the expectation that approximately 300 subjects will be evaluable for efficacy.  • Nyxol + LDP • Nyxol + LDP vehicle  • Placebo (ie, Nyxol vehicle) + LDP • Placebo + LDP vehicle  Subjects will be randomized 1:1:1:1 into the above groups. At Visit 1 (Screening/Baseline), eligible subjects will be randomized, and the first dose of Treatment 1 will be administered (note: if Visit 1 is split into 2 separate days, then dosing occurs on the second day). Efficacy and safety measurements are made before dosing with Treatment 1 (Time 0 min) and at multiple post-dose timepoints from [ADDRESS_727870]-randomization assessments in the following order on the second day (ie, confirm concomitant medications, subject questionnaire, in-office Treatment [ADDRESS_727871]-treatment). Prior to discharge following completion of Visit 1 (Stage 1 Day 1), Treatment [ADDRESS_727872] will dose Treatment 1 study medication as close to 12 hours prior to Time 0 min for that visit. At Visit 2 (Stage 1 Day 8), efficacy and safety measurements will be made at 12 hours after the dose of Treatment 1 study medication (12-hour endpoint). After completion of these assessments, the subject will take no study drug for 7 to 14 days (during the Washout Period), after which Stage 1 is complete. Measurements will be made on Visit 3 (Stage 1 Day 10 ± 1 day) during the Washout Period to assess the absence of residual treatment effects.  Subjects will restart dosing daily with Treatment 1 in the evening immediately prior to Visit 4 (Stage 2 Day 1) as close to 12 hours prior to the scheduled time for Visit 4 for the 12-hour assessments. At this visit, after completion of the 12-hour assessments for Treatment 1, subjects will be administered their morning dose of Treatment 2 (at Time 0 min) at the study site, and efficacy and safety measurements will be made at multiple post-dose timepoints over the next 8 hours. During Stage 2, subjects will administer Treatment 1 in the evenings near bedtime and Treatment 2 in the mornings from the evening prior to Visit 4 (Stage 2 Day 1) for the next 7 days or until the evening before their scheduled Visit 5 (Stage 2 Day 8). On the evening prior to Visit 5, Treatment [ADDRESS_727873]-dose timepoints over 8 hours after dosing with Treatment 2. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_60230]/dark color irides (Appendix 1). The number of subjects in each irides type should be as close as possible to 1:1, with a minimum of 40% within each stratum. The subjects will be recruited from approximately 30 investigational sites in the US.

OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE The VEGA-2 study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-masked study of the safety and efficacy of Nyxol (POS 0.75%) in combination with LDP 0.4% in subjects with presby[CONTACT_19555]. The objectives of this study are: Primary objective • To evaluate the efficacy of LDP as adjunctive therapy to Nyxol (Nyxol + LDP) to improve DCNVA without loss of BCDVA compared to placebo + LDP vehicle in subjects with presby[CONTACT_553935] • To evaluate the efficacy of Nyxol + LDP to improve DCNVA without loss of BCDVA compared to placebo + LDP (LDP alone) and Nyxol + LDP vehicle (Nyxol alone) in subjects with presby[CONTACT_19555] • To evaluate the efficacy of Nyxol as a single agent to improve DCNVA without loss of BCDVA compared to placebo in subjects with presby[CONTACT_19555]   • To evaluate additional efficacy measures, such as VA and PD, across multiple timepoints and visits for Nyxol as a single agent and Nyxol + LDP  • To evaluate the effect of iris color, Baseline PD, and Baseline DCNVA on efficacy of Nyxol as a single agent and Nyxol + LDP • To evaluate the ocular and systemic safety of Nyxol as a single agent and Nyxol + LDP  • To evaluate subject-reported outcomes of Nyxol as a single agent and Nyxol + LDP he Sponsor intends to use this Phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_553886] a single agent and Nyxol + LDP for the indication of “treatment of presby[CONTACT_19555].”  5. STUDY DESIGN This is a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, multicenter, Phase 3 study in approximately 320 subjects with presby[CONTACT_19555]. The study will be performed in 2 stages, as shown in Appendix 4.  Subjects will be randomized 1:1:1:1 to treatments for both stages at Visit 1 (Screening/Baseline). Treatment [ADDRESS_727874] of 2 treatment groups (Nyxol or placebo [ie, Nyxol vehicle]), with approximately 160 subjects in each group. Stage 2 consists of 4 treatment groups (Nyxol + LDP, Nyxol + LDP vehicle, placebo + LDP, and placebo + LDP vehicle), with approximately 80 subjects per treatment group. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_60230]/dark irides (Appendix 1). The number of subjects in each irides type should be as close as possible to 1:1, with a minimum of 40% within each stratum. The subjects will be recruited from approximately 30 investigational sites in the US. Stage 1: Dosing of Treatment 1 
Ocuphire Pharma, Inc. Clinical Protocol OPI-NYXP-301 VEGA-2   
  09/29/2023 Page 24 of 76 In Stage 1, the safety and efficacy of Nyxol as a single agent will be evaluated over the following 1 day and 7 days of daily dosing in the evenings near bedtime, except the evening before Visit 2, when Treatment 1 is dosed as close to 12 hours prior to Time 0 min for that visit. Following Visit 2 (Stage 1 Day 8), subjects will discontinue dosing Treatment 1 for 7 to 14 days (Washout Period). During the Washout Period, subjects will return for Visit 3 (Stage 1 Day 10 ± 1 day) to assess the resolution of drug treatment effects.  During Stage 1, subjects will dose with Treatment 1 (Nyxol or placebo [ie, Nyxol vehicle]) in the evenings near bedtime (except for Visit 1 [Stage 1 Day 1], when the subject is dosed during the day at the study site).  Measurements will be made at multiple visits and timepoints, and analysis will consist of comparison across the 2 arms: • Nyxol • Placebo Stage 2: Dosing of Treatments 1 and 2 Visit 4 (Stage 2 Day 1) is the start of Stage 2. In Stage 2, the efficacy and safety of Nyxol + LDP will be evaluated following 1 day and 7 days of dosing, in which Treatment 1 (Nyxol or placebo) is dosed daily in the evenings near bedtime, except the evening before Visits 4 and 5, when Treatment 1 is dosed as close to 12 hours prior to the scheduled time for those visits. Treatment 2 (LDP or LDP vehicle) is dosed daily in the mornings. Treatment 2 will be dosed at the study site at the beginning of Visits 4 and 5 (Stage 2 Days 1 and 8, respectively).  Measurements will be made at multiple visits and timepoints, and analysis will consist of comparison across the 4 arms:  • Nyxol + LDP • Nyxol + LDP vehicle  • Placebo + LDP • Placebo + LDP vehicle  Other design considerations: Study medications (Treatments 1 and 2) will each be dosed as a single drop in each eye, with Treatment 1 dosed in the evenings near bedtime and Treatment 2 dosed in the mornings. Baseline for the study is defined as pre-treatment up to and including randomization (prior to Time 0 min) at Visit 1 (Screening/Baseline).  During Visit 2 (Stage 1 Day 8), Time [ADDRESS_727875] efficacy assessments at the visit, approximately 12 hours after dosing with Nyxol the previous night (12-hour post-dose timepoint). During Visits 4 and 5 (Stage 2 Days 1 and 8, respectively), Time 0 min is defined as the time of Treatment 2 administration.  The study eye is defined as the eligible eye with worse Baseline DCNVA at Visit 1 (Screening/Baseline). In the case where both eyes have the same Baseline DCNVA, then the eye with the better BCDVA will be the study eye. If both DCNVA and BCDVA are equivalent between eyes, the study eye will be the right eye (OD). The study eye and fellow eye will both be

  09/29/2023 Page 25 of 76 evaluated at all assessments. The baseline values are determined during Screening assessments at Visit 1. 5.1. Primary And Secondary Endpoints Efficacy: The primary efficacy endpoint is the percent of subjects with ≥ 15 letters of improvement in photopic binocular DCNVA and with < [ADDRESS_727876]-LDP/vehicle comparing Nyxol + LDP to placebo + LDP vehicle at Visit 5 (Stage 2 Day 8).    This comparison will be analyzed first using a hierarchical testing method.  The key secondary endpoints are:  • The percent of subjects with ≥15 letters of improvement in photopic binocular DCNVA and with < [ADDRESS_727877]-LDP/vehicle comparing Nyxol + LDP to LDP alone at Visit 5 (Stage 2 Day 8) • The percent of subjects with ≥ 15 letters of improvement in photopic binocular DCNVA and with < [ADDRESS_727878]-LDP/vehicle comparing Nyxol + LDP to Nyxol alone at Visit 5 (Stage 2 Day 8)  These comparisons will be analyzed second and third using a hierarchical testing method.

Study Medication Administration Subjects will restart dosing daily with Treatment 1 in the evening immediately prior to Visit 4 (Stage 2 Day 1). The evening doses prior to Visit 4 and Visit 5 (Stage 2 Day 8) should be as close to 12 hours prior to the scheduled time for those visits. At both of these visits, after completion of the 12-hour assessments for Treatment 1, subjects will be administered their morning dose of Treatment 2 (at Time 0 min) at the study site, and efficacy and safety measurements will be made at multiple post-dose timepoints over the next 8 hours.  5.4.5.  Study Medication Accountability [IP_ADDRESS]. Receipt and Disposition of Study Medication The Investigator or designee (eg, study coordinator or pharmacist) will maintain a full accountability record for both Treatment [ADDRESS_727893] diaries. The monitor will review dispensing and study medication accountability records during site visits and at the completion of the study and note any discrepancies.  [IP_ADDRESS].  Return of Study Medication When the study is completed or is terminated by [CONTACT_60248], all study material including used and unused study medication bottles will be returned to Ocuphire (or its designee) or destroyed under the direction of same. All study medication accounting procedures must be completed before the study is considered completed. A final study medication and subject diaries disposition will be completed by [CONTACT_9137]. 5.5. Expected Duration of Subject Participation The total length of subject participation is approximately 22 to 36 days (accommodating for weekends), with 5 clinic visits as summarized below: • Screening/Baseline Visit 1 (Stage 1 Day 1). Note that Visit 1 (Screening/Baseline) assessments are recommended to be performed on the same day; however, in instances in which subjects are unable to complete the full day of assessments for Visit 1, subjects may be scheduled to return for the completion of Visit [ADDRESS_727894]-randomization assessments on the second day.    • Visit 2 (Stage 1 Day 8) • Visit 3 (Stage 1 Day 10 ± 1 day) during the Washout Period of 7 to 14 days • Visit 4 (Stage 2 Day 1 [Day 15-22]) • Visit 5 (Stage 2 Day 8 [Day 22-29])

  09/29/2023 Page 36 of 76 The execution of the entire study (first subject screen through last randomized subject completed) is expected to take approximately 9 months.  5.6. Randomization and Procedure for Breaking the Code A randomization code for allocating subjects to each treatment group will be prepared by [CONTACT_553942]. Subjects will be then randomized 1:1:1:1 into 1 of 4 treatment arms at Visit 1:  • Nyxol + LDP • Nyxol + LDP vehicle  • Placebo + LDP • Placebo + LDP vehicle  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_60245] (light/dark irides). The number of subjects in each irides type should be as close as possible to 1:1, with a minimum of 40% within each stratum. 5.7. Collection of Data Study-specific data that have been outlined in the protocol will be entered into the clinical database by [CONTACT_29569](s) designated by [CONTACT_737]. Data will be verified electronically using a series of online programmed edit checks that have been created by [CONTACT_60288]. Data discrepancies will be brought to the attention of the clinical team and investigated by [CONTACT_553943]. Study Monitors will review and verify all data collected in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) against any applicable source documentation during remote review or scheduled monitoring visits. The Study Monitor will work closely with the Site Staff to address any discrepancies that have been found so that proper resolutions can be made and documented in the clinical database. An audit trail within the system will track all changes made to the data. 5.8. Completed Subject A completed subject is defined as one who completes all planned procedures through the end of Visit 5. 5.9. Non-completing Subject A non-completing subject is defined as one who exits the study by [CONTACT_553944]/or the Medical Monitor prior to completing all of the study procedures required in this protocol. Any subject may decide to voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice.  5.9.1.  Study Medication Discontinuation The study medication may be discontinued for the following reasons: • Adverse events: Adverse events include clinically significant laboratory abnormalities and intercurrent diseases reported by [CONTACT_9303], with documentation on the eCRF • Death: If a subject dies, the AE(s) that caused the death should be documented on the eCRF and be noted as serious and fatal

Reasons for Withdrawal From Study • Subject withdraws consent  • Subject withdraws due to an AE • Subject is lost to follow-up  • Subject withdraws for other reason  5.9.3.  Entire Study Terminated The entire study may be terminated by [CONTACT_553946]. Prompt, written notice of reasonable cause to the other party (Ocuphire or Investigators, respectively) is required. Prompt notice to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and to regulatory authorities is also required. 5.9.4. Actions After Discontinuation All subjects who discontinue study medication due to a report of an AE must be followed up and provided appropriate medical care until their signs and symptoms have remitted or stabilized or until medical assessments have returned to acceptable or pre-study limits. For any subject who chooses to withdraw consent or who is non-compliant, every possible effort should be made by [CONTACT_553947] 8-hour measurements are assessed prior to discontinuation, in addition to a follow-up telephone call that includes assessments for AEs and concomitant medications.  5.10. Completed Study The study is completed when all randomized subjects have completed or discontinued the study, all eCRFs have been completed, and all eCRF data have been entered into the database. Final database lock will occur after the last randomized subject completes last visit, all data have been entered, and all queries are resolved.  5.11.

TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS Approximately 320 eligible subjects will be randomized into 1 of 4 treatment arms:  • Nyxol + LDP • Nyxol + LDP vehicle • Placebo + LDP • Placebo + LDP vehicle Subjects will be randomized 1:1:1:1 into the above groups. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_60245] (light/dark irides). The number of subjects in each irides type should be as close as possible to 1:1, with a minimum of 40% within each stratum. 7.1. Treatment Adherence Following the completion of Visit 1 (Stage 1 Day 1), subjects will be dispensed Treatment [ADDRESS_727903] diary to document dosing.  At the end of Visit 4 (Stage 2 Day 1), subjects will be dispensed Treatment [ADDRESS_727904] diaries with them to Visit 2 (Stage 1 Day 8), Visit 4 (Stage 2 Day 1), and Visit 5 (Stage 2 Day 8). All subjects must be instructed on the importance of following the once-daily dosing regimen for each Treatment [ADDRESS_727905] diaries for both Treatments 1 and 2.  7.2.

  09/29/[ADDRESS_727906], for example, as long as the particular agent and its dose and regimen had been consistent for the 7 days prior to Screening, and there was no reason to believe that alteration would be necessary at some point later during the study. However, Flomax (tamsulosin) is specifically excluded If there is any question about whether a medication is acceptable, the Medical Monitor should be consulted before proceeding. Use of all medications should be documented on the appropriate eCRF. Investigators are encouraged to contact [CONTACT_553950]. Judgment of continued study participation by [CONTACT_423], and inclusion of this subject’s subsequent visits in the safety and efficacy analysis, will be made by [CONTACT_60248]. All medications that the subject has taken within 30 days prior to the Screening Visit and during the study will be recorded in the eCRF. The name [CONTACT_18467], dose, route of administration, duration of treatment, and indication will be recorded for each medication. For combination products (eg, Contac®, Cosopt®) and non-combination products, the generic name [CONTACT_245533]. The use of routine ophthalmic diagnostic pharmaceutical agents (eg, fluorescein and local anesthetic) will be allowed and should be documented. Any change in dosing parameters should also be recorded in the eCRF.  8. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY 8.1. Specification of the Efficacy Parameters The primary efficacy endpoint is the percent of subjects with ≥ 15 letters of improvement in photopic binocular DCNVA and with < [ADDRESS_727907]-LDP/vehicle comparing Nyxol + LDP to placebo + LDP vehicle at Visit 5 (Stage 2 Day 8). This comparison will be analyzed first using a hierarchical testing method. Key secondary efficacy endpoints can be found in Section 5.1.  All of the efficacy endpoints will be analyzed overall and by [CONTACT_60230]/dark irides at all timepoints. All of the efficacy endpoints will also be analyzed by [CONTACT_553951]. 8.2. Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing of Efficacy Parameters Visual acuity and PD assessments will be measured as described in Section 5.1. The subject should be in the same room for all assessments, and every effort will be made to have the same person perform the measurements at all visits. The timing for recording efficacy parameters may be found in Table 1 and Table 2. 8.2.1. Screening/Baseline Visit 1 (Stage 1 Day 1)  Individuals who are potential subjects will be identified by [CONTACT_553952]. If a subject successfully completes their Screening Assessments, then Visit 1 becomes the Baseline Visit. Note that Visit 1 (Screening/Baseline) assessments are recommended to be performed on the same day; however, in instances in which subjects are unable to complete the full day of assessments for Visit 1, subjects may be scheduled to return

  09/29/[ADDRESS_727908] wishes to continue, the informed consent form (ICF) is signed, and a subject number is assigned.  The start of Screening includes an explanation of the study, a medical and ophthalmic history, demographics, HR and BP, urine pregnancy test (females of childbearing potential) and eligibility assessments.  The subject will then undergo manifest refraction and near add, and several VA measurements, including photopic BCDVA as well as mesopic and photopic DCNVA (Inclusion Criteria #5-7). In addition, subjects will undergo measurement of photopic DCIVA and mesopic BCDVA The Screening assessment will also include an ophthalmic examination that includes assessment of PD, biomicroscopy, dry eye examination with tear break-up time testing and corneal fluorescein staining, IOP measurement (using a Tono-Pen or Goldmann Applanation tonometry), and direct or indirect ophthalmoscopy without dilation.  If all eligibility criteria are met, the subject will be randomized into the study.  At Visit 1 (Stage 1 Day 1), eligible subjects will be randomized, and the first dose of Treatment 1 will be administered at the study site at Time 0 min. Efficacy and safety measurements are made before dosing with Treatment 1 (Time 0 min) and at multiple post-dose timepoints from [ADDRESS_727909]-randomization assessments in the following order on the second day (ie, confirm concomitant medications, subject questionnaire, in-office Treatment [ADDRESS_727910]-treatment). The following assessments are conducted during Visit 1: Prior/Concomitant medication Heart rate and BP Pupil diameter (photopic and mesopic) Distance-corrected near VA (photopic and mesopic), BCDVA (photopic and mesopic), DCIVA (photopic); all VA measurements will be made binocularly, except selected measurements at 0 min (DCNVA photopic, BCDVA photopic and mesopic), which will be measured binocularly followed by [CONTACT_553953], Inc.

  09/29/2023 Page 45 of 76 8.3.  Visit Variation Visit 3 may occur 1 to 3 days after Visit 2; Visit 4 may occur 8 to 15 days after completion of Visit 1; and Visit [ADDRESS_727912] questionnaire, and systemic safety (as measured by [CONTACT_60231]). Urine pregnancy tests for females of childbearing potential will also be conducted. The assessment of safety will be evaluated by: • Ocular tolerability measured on a 4 point scale • Biomicroscopy of the anterior segment including evaluation of lids, lashes, cornea, conjunctiva, iris, lens, and anterior chamber. Following topi[INVESTIGATOR_553897], the integrity of the cornea should be evaluated by [CONTACT_344599] • Ophthalmoscopy (direct or indirect) without dilation to evaluate the vitreous and posterior pole • Best-corrected distance VA • Intraocular pressure performed with a Tono-Pen or Goldmann Applanation tonometry • Subject questionnaire • Heart rate and BP (as per the site’s normal equipment and procedures) • Adverse events 9.2. Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety Parameters The timing for recording safety parameters may be found in Table 1 and Table 2. 9.3. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events All AEs and SAEs that occur following consent and until the final study visit should be collected and recorded on the AE or SAE eCRF page. Only TEAEs will be summarized (Section 9.3.1). All AEs/adverse reactions occurring during the study (ie, once the subject has signed the ICF) must be documented, regardless of the assumption of causal relationship, on the respective eCRF. All TEAEs/treatment-emergent adverse reactions must be documented from the time the subject receives the study medication until the subject’s participation in the study has been completed. If a subject has ongoing AEs/adverse reactions at the time of study completion or discontinuation from the study, the ongoing AEs/adverse reactions must be followed up and provided appropriate medical care until the signs and symptoms have remitted or stabilized or until medical assessments have returned to acceptable or pre-study limits. Documentation of AEs/adverse reactions includes start date and end date, severity, relationship to study medications, action(s) taken, seriousness, and outcome.

  09/29/2023 Page 46 of 76 9.3.1.  Adverse Event Definitions The following definitions of terms apply to this section: Adverse event. An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a study medication in humans, whether or not it is considered drug related. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory findings), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the study medication, whether or not related to the study medication. Study medication includes the investigational drug under evaluation and the comparator product or vehicle placebo that is given or administered during any phase of the study.  Medical conditions/diseases present before starting the investigational treatment are only considered AEs if they worsen after starting the investigational treatment. Abnormal test results constitute AEs only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are considered clinically significant, or require therapy. The occurrence of AEs should be sought by [CONTACT_31463]-ended questioning of the subject at each visit during the study. At each clinic assessment/visit, study personnel should ask the following question: “Have you had any problems since your last assessment/visit?” Adverse events also may be detected when they are volunteered by [CONTACT_31464]. Life-threatening adverse event or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction. An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life-threatening” if, in the view of either the Investigator or Ocuphire, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  Serious adverse event or serious suspected adverse reaction. An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view of either the Investigator or Ocuphire, it results in any of the following outcomes:  • Death • Life-threatening AE • Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] • Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  • Congenital anomaly/birth defect  • Other medically important serious event Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Treatment on an outpatient emergency basis that does not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063], or a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31437] a preplanned treatment for a pre-existing condition that is 
Ocuphire Pharma, Inc. Clinical Protocol OPI-NYXP-301 VEGA-2   
  09/29/2023 Page 47 of 76 unrelated to the medication under study and has not worsened since the start of the study is not considered an SAE. Suspected adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE. For the purposes of Investigational New Drug safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug.  Unexpected adverse event or unexpected suspected adverse reaction. An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the IB or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed. “Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also refers to AEs or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. The study medication relationship for each AE/adverse reaction should be determined by [CONTACT_516425]: • Not related • Unlikely related • Possibly related • Probably related • Definitely related • Unknown Unless the relationship is considered to be “Not related” or “Unlikely related” and there is any valid reason, even if undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause-and-effect relationship between the study medication and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be considered “related.”  If the relationship between the AE/SAE and the investigational product is determined by [CONTACT_553957] “Not related” or “Unlikely related,” the event will be considered to be related to the investigational product for the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting. Severity of an AE is defined as a qualitative assessment of the level of discomfort of an AE as is determined by [CONTACT_19577]/her by [CONTACT_423]. The assessment of severity is made irrespective of study medication relationship or seriousness of the event and should be evaluated according to the following scale: • 1 = Mild: Present, but not distressing, and no disruption of normal daily activity • 2 = Moderate: Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity • 3 = Severe: Incapacitating, with inability to work or perform normal daily activity A change in severity for a reported AE will require an end date for the previous severity and a new start and end date for the new severity. For example, a change in severity may go from mild 
Ocuphire Pharma, Inc. Clinical Protocol OPI-NYXP-301 VEGA-2   
  09/29/2023 Page 48 of 76 to severe or from severe to moderate. In either case, the start or end times/dates should be recorded.  The term “severe” is used to describe the intensity of an event/reaction; the event/reaction itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a severe headache). This is not the same as a “serious” AE, which is based on a subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to the subject’s life or vital functions. “Seriousness” (NOT severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. Should a pregnancy occur, it must be reported and recorded on the pregnancy form and emailed to [EMAIL_10544], as well as in the eCRF. Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_49850] a contraceptive medication. The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth, or congenital abnormality) must be followed up and documented even if the subject was discontinued from the study. Action taken in response to an AE is coded as: • Dose increased: An indication that a medication schedule was modified by [CONTACT_60267]; either by [CONTACT_60268], strength, or amount • Dose not changed: An indication that a medication schedule was maintained • Dose reduced: An indication that a medication schedule was modified by [CONTACT_58413], either by [CONTACT_60268], strength, or amount • Dose interrupted: An indication that a medication schedule was modified by [CONTACT_229782] a prescribed regimen of medication • Drug withdrawn: An indication that a medication schedule was modified through termination of a prescribed regimen of medication • Not applicable: Determination of a value is not relevant in the current context • Unknown: Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused Additional other action taken: • Concomitant medication • Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_553898]: • Fatal: The termination of life as a result of an AE • Not recovered/not resolved: One of the possible results of an AE outcome that indicates that the event has not improved or the subject has not recuperated • Recovered/resolved: One of the possible results of an AE outcome that indicates that the event has improved or the subject has recuperated 
Ocuphire Pharma, Inc. Clinical Protocol OPI-NYXP-301 VEGA-2   
  09/29/2023 Page 49 of 76 • Recovered/resolved with sequelae: One of the possible results of an AE outcome where the subject recuperated but retained pathological conditions resulting from the prior disease or injury • Recovering/resolving: One of the possible results of an AE outcome that indicates that the event is improving • Unknown: Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused In previous clinical studies of Nyxol, the most frequently reported AE was conjunctival hyperemia. Investigators are cautioned to use the appropriate verbatim term on the AE form to describe this observation:  • Redness related to instillation that is transient (ie, is no longer present 2 hours after instillation) = “conjunctival erythema upon instillation” • Redness that is NOT transient (ie, is present 2 hours after instillation) = “conjunctival hyperemia” Expedited reporting of serious and unexpected adverse events: All SAEs (related and unrelated) will be recorded following subject signature [CONTACT_553975] 5. Any SAEs “suspected” to be related to the study medication and discovered by [CONTACT_553958]. Any SAE that occurs must be reported to the CRO within [ADDRESS_727913] should be maintained at the site with a copy emailed to [EMAIL_10544]. The Investigator must assess the SAE relationship and complete the SAE eCRF. The CRO may request additional information. Follow-up information (eg, discharge summary) will be retained in the subject’s chart and a copy will be emailed to [EMAIL_10544]. In addition, all SAEs should be recorded on the AE eCRF page with the serious question marked “Yes.” It is the Investigator’s responsibility to notify the approving IRB of any SAEs on a timely basis, as instructed by [CONTACT_553959]’s determination of causality. All subjects who experience an SAE should be followed clinically and undergo the appropriate diagnostic evaluations until stabilization or resolution of the event. Ocuphire will report all SAEs to the FDA on the appropriate schedule, depending if the event is drug related or not drug related, expected, or unexpected (based on the available information in the IB). Any death occurring during the study and follow-up period must be reported as an SAE. For any death occurring through the end of the study, regardless of the degree of relationship to study medication, the SAE resulting in the death must be reported to the CRO. A death occurring after completion of the study that is not reasonably associated with study medication administration does not require completion of the SAE form.

  09/29/2023 Page 50 of 76 9.3.2.  Follow-Up of Subjects After Adverse Events If an AE/adverse reaction occurs, the Investigator will institute support and/or treatment as deemed appropriate. All SAEs ongoing at the time of the last visit or discontinuation from the study will be followed up until the AE/adverse reaction is resolved or stabilized, the subject is lost to follow-up, or there is other resolution to the event.   10. STATISTICS 10.1. Sample Size Using α = 0.[ADDRESS_727914], 300 total subjects (150 subjects each in the Nyxol and placebo arms) who are evaluable for efficacy will provide greater than 80% power to detect a difference of 17% between treatments in percent of subjects with ≥ 15 letters of improvement in photopic binocular DCNVA and with < [ADDRESS_727915]-dose at Visit 2 (Stage 1 Day 8). This calculation is based on a 12% placebo effect and a 29% Nyxol treatment effect. Excess power will be employed for a hierarchical analysis of selected secondary efficacy endpoints. Subjects will be randomized 1:1:1:1 to Nyxol + LDP, Nyxol + LDP vehicle, Placebo + LDP, and Placebo + LDP vehicle respectively. As a result, subjects will be randomized 1:1 to Treatment 1 (Nyxol or placebo). An additional 20 subjects will be enrolled to account for dropouts, for a total of approximately 320 subjects to be randomized. A diagram outlining the study design can be found in Appendix 4. 10.2. Analysis Populations Modified Intention-to-Treat Population: The mITT Population will include all randomized subjects who received at least 1 drop of Treatment 1. The mITT Population will be used to analyze the primary endpoint as well as other efficacy endpoints. Per Protocol Stage 1 Population: The PP Stage 1 (PPS1) Population will include all subjects in the mITT Population who receive [ADDRESS_727916] binocular DCNVA and BCDVA in photopic conditions at Baseline (Visit 1) and at [ADDRESS_727917] efficacy endpoints as specified in the SAP.  Per Protocol Stage 2 Population: The PP Stage 2 (PPS2) Population will include all subjects in the PPS1 Population who receive [ADDRESS_727918] efficacy endpoints as specified in the SAP.  All Randomized Population (ARP): The ARP will include all randomized subjects. This population is also known as the Intention-to-Treat (ITT) Population. The ARP will be used in confirmatory efficacy analyses.

  09/29/2023 Page 51 of 76 Safety Population (SP): The SP will include all randomized subjects who have received at least 1 drop of study treatment (Treatment 1 or Treatment 2). The SP will be used to summarize safety variables. Per Protocol Populations include PPS1 and PPS2 throughout this document. 10.3. Statistical Methods  10.3.1.  General Considerations All continuous variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_11139] (as applicable) using descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum). All categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_11139] (as applicable) using frequency counts and percentages.  All study data will be listed by [CONTACT_3148], subject, and timepoint (as applicable). All statistical tests will be performed using a significance level of 5% (two-tailed). The p-values for the analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints will be considered descriptive. 10.3.2.  Demographic and Baseline Characteristics Demographic and Baseline characteristics, such as age, race, and sex, will be summarized by [CONTACT_553960], PP Populations, the ARP, and the SP. These data will also be provided in by-subject listings. 10.3.3.  Subject Disposition Subject disposition, including randomization, completion, and withdrawal from the study, will be summarized using the ARP. These data will also be provided in by-subject listings. 10.3.4.  Medical History and Prior/Concomitant Medications Medical history will be coded using the latest version of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA, Version 25 or higher) and will be summarized by [CONTACT_553960].  Prior medications (medications with an end date prior to the date of randomization) and concomitant medications (medications with a start or end date after the date of randomization) will be coded using World Health Organization Drug Dictionary (March 2022 or later edition available at study start) and will both be summarized by [CONTACT_553961]. Medical history and prior and concomitant medications will also be provided in by-subject listings.  10.3.5.  Analysis of Efficacy Efficacy will be assessed using the mITT and PP Populations, with subjects included in the treatment arm into which they were randomized. For the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint, appropriate imputation techniques will be performed for missing observations if applicable; details will be provided in the study SAP. The primary comparison of interest is Stage 2 Nyxol + LDP versus placebo + LDP vehicle for the mITT Population. Confirmatory analyses may be performed using the ARP, with imputation performed for missing data. For the analysis of the secondary efficacy endpoints, only observed case data will be used. If warranted,

  09/29/[ADDRESS_727919] values taken prior to administration of Treatment 1, which will usually be the screening assessment values on Visit 1. All efficacy data will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570], study visit, and timepoint, as appropriate. The primary efficacy endpoint is the percent of subjects with ≥ 15 letters of improvement in photopic binocular DCNVA and with < [ADDRESS_727920]-LDP/vehicle comparing Nyxol + LDP to placebo + LDP vehicle at Visit 5 (Stage 2 Day 8). The primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed using a logistic regression model with treatment, light/dark irides, and Baseline DCNVA as a covariate. The percentage of subjects in each treatment arm meeting the criteria, the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI), and p-value will be provided. The analysis will be performed using the mITT and PP Populations, with subjects included in their randomized treatment regardless of the treatment they actually received. A sensitivity analysis will be completed for the primary efficacy endpoint using the same model but excluding the light/dark irides factor. Secondary efficacy endpoints are indicated in Section 5.1. Each of the continuous secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with change from Baseline as the dependent variable, treatment and light/dark irides as factors, and the respective Baseline value included as the covariate. Each ANCOVA will be performed using the mITT and PP Populations, with subjects included in their randomized treatment regardless of the treatment they actually received. The output from each ANCOVA will include the least-squares mean (LSM) and standard error for all treatment groups, along with the placebo-corrected LSM for each treatment difference, its 95% CI, and associated p-value.  All continuous secondary endpoints derived from VA assessments, such as change in DCNVA, DCIVA, and BCDVA, will be analyzed using ETDRS letters correctly read.  For each of the secondary endpoints related to percent of subjects achieving certain criteria, the analysis will be performed using a logistic regression model with treatment, light/dark irides, and the respective Baseline as a covariate. For each analysis, the percentage of subjects in each treatment arm meeting the criteria, the OR with 95% CI, and p-value will be provided. For these endpoints, the mITT and PP Populations will be used, with subjects included in their randomized treatment regardless of the treatment they actually received. In addition, each secondary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed by [CONTACT_60230]/dark irides using the same model indicated above but without irides as a factor, as appropriate. Other subgroups, such as age, sex, and race, may be analyzed as well.  Select efficacy endpoints will be included in a hierarchical analysis, which will be specified in the SAP. The first endpoint in the hierarchy will be the primary efficacy endpoint, followed by [CONTACT_553962].

  09/29/2023 Page 53 of 76 10.3.6.  Analysis of Safety Safety will be assessed using the SP, with subjects included in the treatment arm they actually received, regardless of their randomized treatment. Observed case data will be used; no imputation will be performed for missing safety data.  For HR and BP, Baseline is defined as the Screening value. Heart rate and BP values and change from Baseline in the values will be summarized by [CONTACT_553963].  For IOP, Baseline is defined as the Screening value. Observed values and change from Baseline in IOP at select timepoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_553964]. For BCDVA, the number of subjects who lose ≥ [ADDRESS_727921] timepoints.  Verbatim descriptions of AEs will be coded using MedDRA. Only TEAEs (those that occur after the first dose of study medication or increasing in severity after initiation of study medication) will be summarized. Treatment-emergent AEs and SAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570], by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC), severity, and relationship to study medication. Deaths, withdrawal from study medication due to AEs, and withdrawal from the study due to AEs will each by [CONTACT_553965]. Note that in MedDRA, ocular events are coded to the SOC of “special senses.” Thus, using SOC in the summaries will provide a separation of ocular and non-ocular AEs. All safety data will be provided in by-subject listings.  10.4. Procedure for Accounting for Missing, Unused, or Spurious Data For the summarization and analysis of efficacy data, the focus will be on observed case data only. As appropriate, confirmatory efficacy analyses will be performed using imputation for missing data; details of the imputation, if performed, will be included in the study SAP. For the summarization of safety data, observed case data only will be used. 10.5. Procedure for Reporting Deviations From the Statistical Plan Any deviations from the SAP will be described and a justification given in the final Clinical Study Report.   11. DIRECT ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA AND DOCUMENTS The Investigator will permit study-related monitoring visits, audits, IRB review, and regulatory inspection(s) by [CONTACT_60282].  12. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE The progress of the study will be monitored by [CONTACT_245526], written, and telephone communications between personnel at the Investigator’s site and the Medical Monitor. Should the COVID-[ADDRESS_727922] monitors from traveling to a site, remote review will be conducted to the extent 
Ocuphire Pharma, Inc. Clinical Protocol OPI-NYXP-301 VEGA-2   
  09/29/[ADDRESS_727923] records (source documents), signed ICFs, records of study medication receipt, storage, preparation, disposition, and regulatory files related to this study.   13. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND GOOD CLINICAL PRACTICE COMPLIANCE  13.1. Good Clinical Practice Compliance The proposed study is subject to all applicable governmental rules and regulations concerning the conduct of clinical trials on human subjects. This includes, but is not necessarily limited to, the approval of IRBs, the Helsinki Declaration, US FDA law, International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) GCP guidelines, obtaining prospective informed consent, monitoring of the conduct of the study and the completeness of the eCRFs by [CONTACT_60283](s), and appropriate record retention by [CONTACT_737].  13.2. Institutional Review Board  This protocol, materials used to recruit subjects, and materials used to document consent must be approved by [CONTACT_60284]. Written IRB approval must adequately identify the protocol and informed consent. In addition to approving the protocol, the IRB must also approve the subject information and consent form, as well as any advertising tools that will be used for the study. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_202335], all correspondence with the IRB and written approval from the IRB must be made available to Ocuphire, prior to the start of subject enrollment into the study. 13.3. Protocol Deviations/Violations The Investigator should not deviate from the requirements of this protocol without prior written approval of the Medical Monitor or Sponsor, except in the event of a medical emergency. A reportable protocol deviation is defined as nonadherence to the protocol that involves inclusion/exclusion criteria, affects subject safety, rights, or welfare, or has the potential to affect the integrity of the data. Examples of major protocol deviations include study enrollment by [CONTACT_60285], loss of key data such as equipment malfunction (eg, pupi[INVESTIGATOR_60187]), and/or use of a prohibited medication during the study.  All protocol deviations will be reported by [CONTACT_60286]. Protocol deviations should be reported to the IRB in accordance with IRB-specific guidelines. If there is any question as to whether the deviation is reportable, Ocuphire or designee and the IRB should be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. All changes to the protocol will be made by [CONTACT_553966], submitted to the FDA, and approved by [CONTACT_14226].  Changes implemented without prior approval will be considered protocol violations. 
Ocuphire Pharma, Inc. Clinical Protocol OPI-NYXP-301 VEGA-2   
  09/29/[ADDRESS_727924] be maintained in the study files at the Investigator’s site.  The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that no subject is subject to any study-related examination or activity before that subject has given informed consent. The subject must give written consent after the receipt of detailed information. The verbal explanation will cover all the elements specified in the written information provided for the subject. It should be emphasized that the subject is at liberty to withdraw consent to participate at any time, without penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled. Subjects who refuse to give or who withdraw written informed consent may not be included or continued in this study, but this will not impact on their subsequent care.  The Investigator will inform the subject of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the study, including any discomfort it may entail. The subject must be given every opportunity to clarify any points he/she does not understand and, if necessary, ask for more information. At the end of the interview, the subject may be given time to reflect if this is required, or if the subject requests more time. Subjects will be required to sign and date the ICF.  A copy of the signed and dated ICF will be given to each subject. The original signed and dated ICF must be maintained in the study files at the Investigator’s site. Signed informed consent must be obtained prior to the conductance of any study procedures.  14. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_553899]. 14.1. Data Entry Study-specific data that have been outlined in the protocol will be entered into the clinical database by [CONTACT_29569](s) designated by [CONTACT_737].  14.2. Data Quality Control and Reporting Data will be verified electronically using a series of programmed edit checks that have been created by [CONTACT_60288]. Data discrepancies will be brought to the attention of the clinical team and investigated by [CONTACT_70585] (CRA) and Site Staff. Clinical research associates will review and verify all data collected in the eCRF against source documentation during scheduled monitoring visits. The CRA will work closely with the Site Staff to address any discrepancies that have been found so that proper resolutions can be made and documented in the clinical database. An audit trail within the system will track all changes made to the data. 14.3. Archiving of Data Archived versions of the database will be saved by [CONTACT_553967], complying with whichever of the requirements is longer. Ocuphire will notify the 
Ocuphire Pharma, Inc. Clinical Protocol OPI-NYXP-301 VEGA-2   
  09/29/2023 Page 56 of 76 Investigator when documents should be returned. 14.4.  Records Retention The Investigator’s site and clinical laboratory will retain all records related to the study in compliance with ICH GCP guidelines. 14.5. Amendments to the Protocol Modifications of the signed protocol are only possible by [CONTACT_219829]. The procedure for approval of a protocol amendment is identical to that for approval of the protocol. The IRB must be informed of all protocol amendments and should be asked for its opi[INVESTIGATOR_12879] a full re-evaluation of the ethical aspects of the study is necessary by [CONTACT_942]. This should be fully documented. The Investigator must not implement any deviation from or change to the protocol, without discussion with, and agreement by [CONTACT_553968]/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_60210], except where it is necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects, or where the change(s) involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the study (eg, change in monitor, change of telephone number). Protocol amendments will be submitted to the appropriate authority(ies) as required by [CONTACT_8146](s).

 Subjects will be randomized 1:1:1:1 to treatments for both 
stages at Visit 1 (Screening/Baseline).  Note that Visit 1 
(Screening/Baseline) assessments are recommended to be 
performed on the same day; however, in instances in which 
subjects are unable to complete the full day of assessments 
for Visit 1, subjects may be scheduled to return for the 
complet ion of Visit [ADDRESS_727933] -
randomization assessments on  the second day.    
 
In Stage 1, the safety and efficacy of Nyxol as a single agent 
will be evaluated following 1 day and 7 days of daily dosing, in 
which Treatment 1 (Nyxol or placebo) is dosed daily in the 
evenings near bedtime  starting with the day after completion 
of Visit 1, except for Visit 1 [Stage 1 Day 1], when the subject 
is dosed during the day at the study site, and the evening before 
Visit 2, when Treatment 1 is dosed as close to 12 hours prior to 
Time 0 min at Visit 2.  
 
During Stage 1, subjects will dose with Treatment 1 (Nyxol or 
placebo [ie, Nyxol vehicle]) in the evenings near bedtime  
starting with the day after completion of Visit 1, except for

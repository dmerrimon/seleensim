bactericidal mechanism of action which is not mediat ed through a single receptor /target

activity again st all the ESKA PE2 bacteria strain s, includin g those resistant to antibiotics, 
bisphosphocin s™ are effective against stationary , slow-growing , and bacteria encased in

Bisphosphocin NU-3 Protocol #LAI2014-[ADDRESS_891600]. 
Briefly, 20 microliters of positive control (0.1% sodium lauryl sulfate), test product (2% Nu-3 
in 0.85% saline), or negative control (0.9% saline) was randomly applied using occlusive 
patches to either abraded or non-abraded (intact) skin for [ADDRESS_891601] skin sites. The conclusion from 
the study with regards to irritation was as follows: 
 
Abraded Skin: Positive Control > 2% Nu-3 > Negative Saline control 
 
Intact Skin: Positive Control > 2% Nu-3 = Negative Saline Control 
 
7 OBJECTIVE 
The
 objective of this study is to evaluate Nu-3 for safety, tolerability, and microbiological 
response to bacteria in patients with chronic diabetic foot ulcer, but excluding any ulcer 
caused by [CONTACT_661143] = “Yes”. 
This study will specifically examine the ability of different doses of Nu-3 to eliminate 
pathogenic
 bacteria in patients with chronic diabetic foot ulcers. Dose and regimen 
information will be obtained for future clinical studies of Nu-3. 
 
7.1 P
rimary Objective 
The primary objective of this study is  
 To assess the safety and tolerability of a twice daily, 7-day repeat topi[INVESTIGATOR_661062]-
3 in adult m
ale and female patients with chronically infected diabetic ulcer. 
 
7.2 S
econdary Objectives  
The secondary objectives of the study are: 
 To assess the clinical and microbiological response to bisphosphocin™ Nu-3. 
 To support determination of the appropriate dose range of Nu-3 to be employed in 
future clinical studies.

8.3 Cohorts 
The dose of Nu-3 administered will be escalated in five planned sequential cohorts, with 
10 subjects in each cohort, to be administered Placebo (0.9% saline) or Nu-3 doses of 0.1% 
solution 
of Bisphosphocin™ Nu-3 in 0.9% saline (w/v) (Cohort 1), 1% solution of 
Bispho
sphocin™ Nu-3 in 0.9% saline (w/v) (Cohort 2), 2% solution of Bisphosphocin™ Nu-
3 in 0.9% saline (w/v) (Cohort 3), 5% solution of Bisphosphocin™ Nu- 3 in 0.9% saline (w/v) 
(Cohort 
4), 10% solution of Bisphosphocin™ Nu-3 in 0.9% saline (w/v) (Cohort 5)  at twice 
da
ily for [ADDRESS_891602] 5 nominally scheduled study visits:  Screening (Day -7 to -4 hours), Single 
Dose Visi
t (Day 1), Safety Review and Multiple Dose Visit (Day 2), Safety Review Visit 
(Day 9 ±1 day) and Final Visit (Day 15 ± 2 days).  Additional visits for screening procedures 
and/or f
ollow-up (e.g., in follow-up of Adverse Events) may be necessary.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_891603]’s duration of participation may vary 
between approximately [ADDRESS_891604] Dose Plan 
The dosing schedule for all cohorts is intended to minimize potential risk to subjects’ safety. 
It is known that the types, severities, time courses and pharmacokinetic correlates of adverse 
effects observed in preclinical studies are not necessarily predictive of experience in human 
subjects, at any dose. This plan further recognizes that major acute toxicities of 
pharmaceuticals in human subjects may on rare occasions not be predicted by [CONTACT_661144]-3 Protocol #LAI2014-[ADDRESS_891605] doses to humans. As such 
caution has been advised in particular regarding biopharmaceuticals, it is noted that Nu-3 is 
not categorized as a biopharmaceutical. A traditional risk-reduction strategy has been to 
apply large safety factors (divisors of human equivalent doses corresponding to NOAELs in 
appropriate animal toxicology models) in determining the Maximum Safe Starting Dose for 
first-in-human study. A further risk-reduction strategy, adopted here, is to separate first and 
second exposures more widely in time than has been typi[INVESTIGATOR_62921].  
 
Preclinical experience suggests that possible adverse effects after a single dose topi[INVESTIGATOR_661064]-3 would be unlikely. Accordingly, the dose plan is as follows: 
 Qualified patients for all Cohorts are screened from Day -7 to -4 hours. Patients 
unde
rstand (disclosed in informed consent) that their qualification for enrollment is 
not finalized until the time of enrollment. They understand that their order of 
enr
ollment is randomly determined.  
 On Day -7 to -4 hours, baseline procedures are performed (demographics and medical 
history, and limited physical examination per protocol, urine pregnancy test (if 
applicable), baseline laboratory tests (blood chemistries, hematology, coagulation 
profile, and urinalysis), and baseline subject disease assessments).  
 On Day 1, the patients is randomized and dosed to either Nu-3 or Placebo. 

 On the next following day, Day 2, if the Investigator observes no dose-limiting 
tox
icity (Section 8.10.6) in the patient dosed on Day 1, the Investigator will distribute 
the investigational product kit and instructed to apply the product twice daily for one 
(1) week (7 days). 
 If the Investigator observes a suggestion of dose-limiting toxicity, the procedure 
specified in Section 8.10.3 is followed. 
 
8.10 Safety Review 
8.10.1 Safety Review Committee  
Membe
rship of the Safety Review Committee includes the Sponsor’s designated Medical 
Monitor, the Medical Director of the CRO, Medical Director of Lakewood Amedex, and 
other member(s) as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_2728].  
 
8.10.2  Safety Review Procedure  
Decisions regarding dose escalation and/or modification (including option of next cohort 
repeating at same dose, or doses intermediate to or reduced from those planned per protocol) 
are based upon review by [CONTACT_661145] (including data at least through the Day 8 Safety Review Visit) for the 
current cohort and safety data of the preceding cohorts to the date of the Safety Review Visit.  
 Safety Review meeting may be conducted by [CONTACT_577].  

 Decisions of the Safety Review Committee must be unanimous among the members 
pa
rticipating in the review and are recorded in meeting minutes.  
 Draft minutes of Safety Review Committee meetings are reviewed by [CONTACT_661146]. Proposed changes are reviewed by [CONTACT_661147]. Final 
draft of minutes is approved by [CONTACT_21128].  
 Individual members’ approvals of final draft minutes are documented to study 
re
gulatory file.  
 Final draft of minutes is placed in study regulatory file and provided to IRB. 
Bisphosphocin NU-3 Protocol #LAI2014-[ADDRESS_891606] dosed on Day 1 of Cohort 1 experiences any therapeutic adverse event around the 
wound area: 
 Further dosing of Cohort 1 is suspended. 

 The Safety Review Committee meets to consider available safety data. 

 The Safety Review Committee decides and documents rationale for further course of 
a
ction, which may include resumption of study conduct. 
8.10.4 Unblinding for Safety Review  
I
f the Safety Review Committee decides that unblinding of dose randomization is necessary 
for decision regarding continued dosing and/or dose escalation, the unblinding is done in a 
manner that minimizes the extent of unblinding and of its potential effects on assessments of 
adverse events. This action is documented in the minutes of the Safety Review Committee 
meeting. 
8.10.5 Decision Criteria 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Stoppi
[INVESTIGATOR_661065]/or Escalation 
Further study drug dose administration or escalation will be stopped: 
1. by [CONTACT_2728], for any reason at any time; 
2.
 by [INVESTIGATOR_678] [INVESTIGATOR_661066], if subjects’ safety is 
c
onsidered to be at unacceptable risk; 
3. by [CONTACT_661148], according to these criteria: 

 If 2 or more of the Nu- 3-treated subjects in a cohort experience a DLT, 
dose escalation is stopped; 
 If 1 of the Nu- 3-treated subjects experiences a DLT, the cohort is 
ex
panded to include 4 additional subjects ( Nu-3:Placebo ratio of 3:1); 
and 
 If 2 or more of the Nu- 3-treated subjects in the expanded cohort (of 
8+4=12 subjects) experience a DLT, dose escalation is stopped;  
 If only 1 of the Nu- 3-treated subjects in the expanded cohort 
experiences a DLT (i.e., no additional subjects experience a DLT 
following cohort expansion), stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_661067]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT)  
Dose-Limiting Toxicity in an individual subject is defined as any Grade 2 or higher Adverse 
Event (AE) toxicity according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events, Version 3.0 (CTCAE – See Appendix 16.1) that is considered by [CONTACT_661149].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) 
If dose escalation is stopped according to criteria of [ADDRESS_891607] tested level will be 
considered the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).   
 
8.11 Subsequent Cohort Dose Plan 
Anticipated Dose Plan – Upon completion of Safety Review of experience to date, if the 
Safety Review Committee determines that there is no reason to do otherwise, the dose plan 
for the subsequent cohort is:

of the preceding cohort.  
 Dose of study drug administered to subjects in the next cohort is the next higher dose 
a
nticipated by [CONTACT_990] (e.g., 1% Nu-3 solution dose cohort after 0.1% Nu-3 solution 
dose cohort). 
 Ten subjects are randomized such that eight dose with Nu- 3 and two dose with 
Placebo. 
 A single subject is dosed at a given scheduled time. 
 Dosing  of successive subjects are separated in time by [CONTACT_661150] 20 minutes. Safety Review Committee may 
specify this interval.

W
ithdrawal of consent for follow-up should be accompanied by [CONTACT_661151]. Withdrawal of consent for treatment should be distinguished from withdrawal 
of consent for follow-up visits and from withdrawal of consent for non-patient contact 
[CONTACT_6492]-up, e.g., medical records checks. Subjects requesting withdrawal should be informed 
that withdrawal of consent for follow-up will jeopardize the public health value of the study. 
 
Subjects who withdraw should be explicitly asked about the contribution of possible adverse 
events to their decision to withdraw consent, and any adverse event information elicited 
should be documented. 
 
Bisphosphocin NU-3 Protocol #LAI2014-[ADDRESS_891615]’s 
representative refuses or is physically unavailable, the site should document and sign the 
reason for the subject’s failure to withdraw consent in writing. The informed consent for the 
study should note that although a subject is free to leave the study and stop taking study 
medication, the investigators hope the patient will remain for follow up status evaluations. 
 
Data from subjects who withdraw from the study will still be used in the statistical analysis. 
A decision to replace a withdrawn subject will be made on a case- by-case basis after 
discussions between the investigator, Medical Monitor, and Sponsor.  Generally speaking, a 
subject who does not meet the definition of “evaluable” (i.e., received investigational product 
and has returned for the Day 2 follow-up visit) may be replaced. However, all subjects, 
whether withdrawn or not, will be included in ITT population for safety evaluations of Nu-3.

10.5 Randomization 
Subjects are assigned to dosing with Nu-3 or Placebo according to the randomization 
sche
dule prepared prior to study start and provided by [CONTACT_2728]/CRO.  In the event that an 
expanded or unscheduled cohort is added, Sponsor/CRO will provide the randomization 
schedule for that cohort prior to admission of the cohort to the investigative site. The 
randomization scheme was predetermined and ordered in blocks of five (5). Five study kits 
are provided to each investigational site utilized to maintain the randomization scheme. 
 
10.6 Blinding and Unblinding 
This is a double-blind study. The randomization schedule for each cohort is provided by 
[CONTACT_2728]/CRO as a sequential list in a sealed envelope. At the investigative site, procedural 
preca
utions are taken to avoid unblinding due to visual inspection of Nu-3 and/or Placebo 
pre
pared for dosing. 
 
Unblinding occurs only in the event of an Adverse Event, or pregnancy of a subject’s partner, 
and only if knowledge of the administered study drug is judged likely to affect the medical 
treatment decisions related to the subject or pregnant partner, or if required for decision-
making by [CONTACT_7244]. In the event of unblinding, the Investigator notifies 
the Sponsor within 24 hours of breaking the blind and provides formal, written 
documentation to the Sponsor within 5 working days. This documentation includes the 
identity of the individual(s) who have become aware of randomization assignment(s), the 
date on which the blind was broken, and a description of the event motivating the unblinding. 
The Investigator also records in relevant source documents that blind was broken, reason for 
unblinding, and the date/time of that occurrence.  
 
The Safety Review Committee may request unblinding to assist in Safety Review and 
decisions regarding further conduct of study. To the extent possible while meeting the need 
for appropriate Safety Review, the Investigator and other investigative site personnel are not 
unblinded. The existence of unresolved Adverse Events at the time of unblinding is given 
consideration. If an Investigator is unblinded, that Investigator is not subsequently involved 
in the management or assessment of AEs for Subjects whose dose assignments have been 
unblinded.

may meet entry criteria, the patient will be informed about the study. The investigator should 
also consider the patient’s risk of injury prior to screening. Even after the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria are reviewed, if the investigator considers the patient a risk for injury, the 
patient should not be enrolled in the study. 
 
12.1 Informed Consent 
All patients are to give informed consent in accordance with the origins of the Declaration of 
Helsinki and applicable regional regulatory requirements (e.g. 21 CFR Part 50).  
The patient will sign the Informed Consent Form before she/he enters the study, i.e., before 
screening bloods, screening assessments or any other study-related activity. The patient will 
be given sufficient time to consider the study’s implications before deciding whether to 
participate. The format and content of the ICF must be agreed upon by [CONTACT_661154]. 
Should there be any amendments to the final protocol; the patient must agree to sign the 
amended ICF indicating that they re-consent to participate in the trial.

A past medical/surgical history will be recorded for any conditions or treatments that are, in 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], relevant to the current diagnosis.  The previous condition will 
be recorded as a diagnosis rather than a previous symptom. The time of the previous 
diagnosis relative to the current admission will be provided (i.e., “6 months ago”) to the best 
of the patient’s knowledge. If the diagnosis was more than two years ago, then it can be 
recorded as “more than two years ago”. 
 
Prior medications will be recorded. Prior medications include medications that the patient is 
currently taken or has taken within the past fourteen days. 
 
Physical examinations are performed at screening by [CONTACT_1719].  The 
screening examinations will include general appearance, height, weight, skin, neck, eyes, 
ears, nose, throat, heart, lungs, abdomen, cervical and axillary lymph nodes, extremities, and 
nervous system. Height is measured in stocking or bare feet, and recorded in centimeters 
(cm). Weight is recorded in kilograms (kg). 
 
Results of these investigations/assessments and baseline measurements obtained from the 
local laboratory will be reviewed by [CONTACT_661155]. 
Patients who do not meet study entry criteria will be promptly notified and excluded from

Consistent BP measurement in one arm is preferred to facilitate comparisons of serial BP 
measurements.  However, optimal performance of other procedures (e.g., blood sampling) 
may require changing BP measurement from one arm to the other.  
 
The investigator or designee will perform a thorough physical examination at the start of the 
study and brief physical examination at [ADDRESS_891628]’s well-being may be assessed by [CONTACT_648]. 
An investigator will be in the premises during the investigational product administration and 
on call until the end of the study. 
13.3 Clinical chemistry 
A CMP (biochemistry and hematology) will be performed by [CONTACT_661156], and 
then repeated at Day [ADDRESS_891629] 
importance that all staff members at the site involved in the study are familiar with the 
content of this section in order to document all adverse events according to the detailed 
guidelines set out below. During the study where there is safety evaluation, the principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_661074], documenting and reporting AEs and 
SAEs. 
 
An adverse event (AE)  is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug 
in humans, 
whether or not considered drug related.  Events that are expected as a result of a 
procedure (other than drug administration of investigational product) that the subject 
undergoes should not be listed as an AE unless the event is more severe than expected or 
deemed significant by [CONTACT_079]. 
 
Timely and complete reporting of all AEs assists the medical staff and sponsor in identifying 
any untoward medical occurrence, thereby [CONTACT_17155]:  
1. protection of the safety of study subjects;  
2.
 a greater understanding of the overall safety profile of the test article;  
3. re cognition of dose-related test article toxicity; 
4. appropriate modification of study protocols;  
5. improvements in study design or procedures; and  
6. adherence to worldwide regulatory requirements.   
 
Test article is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active ingredient (or “primary 
operational component” for devices) or vehicle/placebo being tested or used as a reference in 
Bisphosphocin NU-3 Protocol #LAI2014-[ADDRESS_891630]’s overall condition since the previous visit. 
 
The 
severity of each adverse event, as judged by [CONTACT_737], will be graded according to 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.02 (CTCAE). For AEs not listed in the 
CTCAE table, the severity of adverse changes in physical signs or symptoms will be 
classified as follows (consistent with CTCAE): 
 
Grade 1 Mild  - asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated. 
Grade 2 Moderate - minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living. 
Grade 3 Severe  - medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_185854]; disabling;  limiting self-care 
activities of daily living.  
Grade [ADDRESS_891631] article according to the 
following categories: 
 
Definite  - An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the test article; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the test article; and 
that is confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_47732], and reappearance 
of the event on repeated exposure (re-challenge). 
Probable - An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the test article; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the test article; and 
that is confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_229767]; 
and that is unlikely to have been caused by [CONTACT_28260]/underlying illness or other drugs, 
procedures, or other causes. 
Possible - An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the test article; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the test article; but 
may have been caused by [CONTACT_28260]/underlying illness, other drug, procedure, or other 
causes. 
Unlikely  - An event that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the test article; that does not follow a known or expected response 
pattern to the test article, or most likely was caused by [CONTACT_28260]/underlying illness, 
other drug, procedure, or other causes, because of their known effects.  
Bisphosphocin NU-3 Protocol #LAI2014-[ADDRESS_891632] certainly caused by [CONTACT_28260]/underlying illness, other 
drug, procedure, or other causes. 
 
An adverse reaction  is any AE caused by a drug. Adverse reactions are a subset of all 
suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the 
event. For the purposes of prescription drug labelling, the term adverse reaction means an 
undesirable effect, reasonably associated with the use of a drug that may occur as part of its 
pharmacological action or may be unpredictable in its occurrence.  
 
A suspected adverse reaction  is any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the drug
 caused the event.  
 
For the purposes of safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to 
suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected adverse 
reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which 
means any adverse event caused by a drug.   
 
An event that is a serious adverse event (SAE)  must be recorded on the AE eCRF and 
requires expeditious handling to comply with regulatory requirements. 
 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_661075], it results in any of the following outcomes: 
 Death. 
 Life-threatening event. 
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].   
 Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions. 
 Congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 Is an important medical event - defined as a medical event(s) that may not result in 
death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient/subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition above. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse.  
 
Events NOT considered to be SAEs are: 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28217], which was elective or pre-planned, of a pre-
existing condition that did not worsen. A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_661076], such as a staged PCI procedure, or a planned prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
such as coronary artery by[CONTACT_661157], will not be 
considered an SAE.   
 Treatment on an emergency, outpatient basis, for an event not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of “serious” given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063].

LAI2014-1_Protocol_V3.1_15Sep20163.1  Confidential The Medical Monitor, Lead Principal Investigator, or Sponsor may be consulted with any 
questions regarding the definition of “planned”. The Medical Monitor may be consulted 
regarding other questions about SAEs. 
 
Adverse events classified as “serious” require expeditious handling and reporting to the 
Medical Monitor, Safety Officer or designee to comply with regulatory requirements. All 
SAEs, whether related or unrelated to test article, must be immediately reported by 
[CONTACT_661158], Safety Officer or, in the event that neither is 
available, to the Project Manager listed on the first page of the protocol.  All SAEs 
should be entered in the eCRF as soon as possible. These include those SAEs listed in the 
protocol or Investigator Brochure and must include an assessment of whether there is a 
reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event.   
 
All SAE are required to be captured on the study supplied SAE report form. Please contact 
[CONTACT_661159], follow-up reports are required. In the event 
of death, if an autopsy is performed, a copy of the report should be sent to the Sponsor or 
designee, if available. 
 
As required, the Sponsor or designee will notify participating investigators of all suspected 
adverse reactions that are serious and unexpected. This notification will be in the form of an 
IND safety report of potential serious risks as soon as possible but no later than 15 calendar 
days after the Sponsor determines that the information is “reportable” according to the 
criteria listed in Section 312.32(c)(1)(i) to (iv) of the CFRs. These are: 
 Serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions, 
 Findings from other studies including epi[INVESTIGATOR_9037], pooled analyses or 
other clinical studies that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the test 
articles, 
 Findings from animal or in vitro tests that suggest a significant risk to humans 
exposed to the test articles, or reports of significant organ toxicity at or near the 
expected human exposure, and 
 Clinically important increases in the rate of occurrence of serious suspected adverse 
reactions. 
 
Upon receiving such notices, the investigator must review and retain the notice with the 
Investigator Brochure and immediately submit a copy of this information to the responsible 
IRB according to local regulations. The investigator and IRB will determine if the ICF 
requires revision. The investigator should also comply with the IRB procedures for reporting 
any other safety information. Where required, submission of safety updates by [CONTACT_658916]. 
 
All AEs must be recorded on the AE CRF. AEs should be followed to resolution or 
stabilization (if possible), and reported as SAEs if they become serious. AEs will be collected 
starting when the subject signs the ICF and ending with the end-of-study visit on Day 15. For 
subje
cts who withdraw from the study, the collection of AEs will end [ADDRESS_891633] completes the study or if a 

Bisphosphocin NU-3 Protocol #LAI2014-[ADDRESS_891634] is withdrawn from the study and the adverse event has still not resolved at this time, 
additional follow-up will be performed, as appropriate. The investigator will continue to 
follow-up all serious adverse events or other adverse events that are considered to be related 
to the investigational products, until it is resolved or assessed to be stable by [CONTACT_737]. 
This follow-up may be extended beyond the end of the study period.  An adverse event can 
reach on

 Completely recovered from the AE 
 Recovered with sequelae 


 PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
Title:  A  Phase I/IIa, Randomized Double Blind , Placebo -Controlled,  
Dose Escalating Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_661052] ™ Nu-3 on Infe cted Diabetic 
Ulcers of Subjects  With Type I or II Diabetes Mellitus  
Phase:  I/IIa 
Population:  Up to [ADDRESS_891658] s over 18 years of age  suffering from diabetes 
mellitus and a chronic infected diabetic ulcer (s). 
Number of Sites:  2 
Study Duration:  [ADDRESS_891659] Participation Duration:  44 days (includes screening visit, study treatment and all follow -ups 
visits through Day [ADDRESS_891660] treatment.  
Description of Agent or 
Intervention:  Bisphosphocin ™ Nu-3 to be applied as a topi[INVESTIGATOR_661083] a bandage.  This study includes three dose 
ascending cohorts.  Within each cohort there are two phases with 
both a single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose arms . The 
three dose levels (cohorts) are  0.1% ( 1mg/ml , anticipated low do se), 
1% ( 10mg/ml , anticipated therapeutic dose, and 2% ( 20mg/ml , 
anticipated high dose).  
Objectives:  Primary:   To assess the safety and tolerability of escalating doses 
of topi[INVESTIGATOR_661084] ™ Nu-3, 
 
, to an open infected ulcer.  Assessment of safety will be 
determined by [CONTACT_661178], vital signs, CBC 
analysis, CMP analysis, and physical exami nation, as well as the 
incidence and severity of emergent adverse events that occur during 
the study participation.  The study will be monitored by [CONTACT_144278] (SMC).  
Secondary:  To assess the clinical and microbiological response to 
bisphosphocin ™ Nu-3 administered topi[INVESTIGATOR_661085], including 
the improvement of wound appearance and elimination of the 
pathogenic bacteria.

Primary Purpose:  Safety  
Description of Study Design  Phase I/IIa, three cohort ascending dose with two dosing arms per 
cohort , study in Type I  or II diabetes mellitus subject s with a 
chronic infected diabetic ulcer  defined as having a DUSS score of 
[ADDRESS_891661] cohort before initiating the next dosing level.  
At all study visits the ulcer will be visually examined for any 
changes and photographed using the Aranz Medical Silhouette™ 
system  that will calculate area and depth of the ulcer.  
In Arm 1, eligible subjects will be treated with a single application 
of Nu -3 or placebo in 4 to 1 ratio to judge the initial safety of Nu -3 
over a brief one (1) hour  interval and [ADDRESS_891662] the bandage on the wound 
and re turn for a follow up visit within 24h ± 2h.  At the follow up 
visit, the bandage will be removed, the ulcer visually examined and 
the subject cleared for the MAD Arm [ADDRESS_891663] dose in the clinic to ensure 
compliance. Subjects will  then be given a 7 day supply and sent 
home to continue treatment.  Visit 4 or earlier in the case of any 
adverse events, subjects will return to the clinic for an examination, 
including visual examination of the ulcer, vital signs, adverse 
events, photo d ocumentation, collection of a sample for 
microbiology and concomitant medication use.  A final follow up 
visit will be scheduled +[ADDRESS_891664] dose of study medication  
(Day 15)  for a complete examination as described above.

as a homeopathic treatment and were found to reduce the severity of several common infection

diabetes and a frequent cause of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]10.  According to the American Diabetes 
Association approximately 8.3% of the US population suffers from diabetes and in [ADDRESS_891671] estimated that approx imately 60 -80% of chronic infections involve 
biofilm formation which makes the bacteria more resistant to traditional antibiotics11.  Therefore, 
proper management of an infected diabetic foot ulcer require s an antimicrobial therapy to cure or 
clear the infection to allow proper wound management or therapy to heal the ulcer and prevent 
relapse.  
Bisphosphocins™, a new class of broad spectrum antimicrob ials, possess a number of 
characteristics that make these compounds extremely well -suited to the management of diabetic 
foot infections.  First, bisphosphocins™ are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_661088] 
a unique mechanism of action providin g the ability to quickly cure an infection.  The compounds 
are fairly low in molecule weight, have a n excellent safety profile, and have shown good 
penetration into wounds.  In addition, there are no known bacterial mechanisms of resistance and 
no resistan t bacteria have been identified to date eliminating a common cause of treatment 
failure7. Finally, bisphosphocins  have been demonstrated highly effective at killing bacteria 
established in biofilms12 which is increasingly become associated with many chronic inf ections.  
The preclinical studies conducted on the bisphosphocin ™ class clearly support their evaluation 
in the proposed Phase I/IIa safety study in diabetic foot infections.

 1.2 Bisphosphocin Nu -3 
1.2.1 General Information  
Bisphosphocins ™ were originally discovered  by  [CONTACT_661179].  The initial 
compounds identified were protonated/acidified oligonucleotides that demonstrated bactericidal 
activity i ndependent of nucleotide sequence.  Further experimentation expanded the class to 
protonated/acidified nucleotides and derivative molecules that exhibit chemical stability, acid pH 
resistance, and nuclease resistance enabling formulations for oral, intrave nous, pulmonary, and 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_116383].  The lead compound, designated Nu -3, is a thymidine derivative that would be 
considered to be in the nucleotide analog ue class of drugs ( Figure 1).  Experimental data has 
elucidated a non -receptor dependent mechanism of action involving disruption of the bacterial 
cell membrane causing depolarization and rapid cell death.  Bisphosphocins ™ have an extremely 
broad spectrum of activity in vitro  testing against over [ADDRESS_891672].

 1.2.2 Pre-Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology  
Specific Pharmacology  
Initial experiments revealed tha t bisphosphocins ™ had an antimicrobial activity distinct from 
any currently existing antibiotic class.  Extensive in vitro and in vivo  experiments have been 
conducted to further define their activity, identify their mechanism of action, and begin to 
establ ish a dose range to allow entry in human clinical trials.  An important factor to consider in 
the review of the following experimental results is that it is now known bisphosphocins ™ do not 
follow the simple inhibitory kinetic model of one compound binding  to one target molecule of 
the current class es of antibiotics but a more complex kinetic model involving the binding of 
multiple molecules to a bacterium resulting in direct bacteria cell death.  For this reason, the 
current hypothesis is bisphosphocin ™ dosing in vivo  will be based on total dose delivered and 
not on maintaining a circulating level above the minimum inhibitory concentration  or at the site 
of infection  to achieve an efficacy outcome  because the molecules rapi[INVESTIGATOR_661089] .  Therefore, the therapeutic effect of bisphosphocins™ can be 
manipulated by [CONTACT_661180] 
a reduction of bacterial load.  The following experiments are presented to further define, 
distinguish and compare the activity of the bisphosphocin class from traditional antibiotics in 
order to develop a comprehensive clinical plan to en able evaluation in humans.  The majority of 
the experimental data presented in the following sections was performed in the laboratory of 
outside collaborators or researchers who then published their results6,7,8,[ADDRESS_891673] Research Organization following the current guidelines for antimicrobial testing.  Due 
to the unique MOA of the bisphosphocin ™ class some standard assay s were modified to enable 
the evaluation which has been noted in the protocol.  Table  [ADDRESS_891674] common fungal pathogens.

Mouse Superficial Skin  Polymicrobial  Infection Model  
Briefly, mice are pre-treated with cyclophosphamide four day prior to initiating the infection to 
suppress the immune system.  The mice are anesthetized and kept sedated while the fur on the 
back dorsal surface is shaved using electric clippers followed by  ‘wet shaving’ with a disposable 
razor. The skin is then sterilized with a betadine wash followed by [CONTACT_661182] a +[ADDRESS_891680] that results in a smooth, red, shiny appearance with no bleeding.  A 
droplet of the bacterial inoculum  is placed directly on the abraded skin that contains 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa UNT034 -1 (ATCC [ZIP_CODE]) 6.35 Log10 CFU/ mouse and S. aureus  
UNT006 -4 (smith) 5.65 Log10 CFU/ mouse.  The infected area is treated with 50 microliters of 
varying concentrations of bi sphosphocin Nu -3, gentamycin, mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190] , or normal saline twice 
daily for 3 days.  The mice are then euthanized, the area of infected skin excised, and the CFU of 
both bacteria is determined by [CONTACT_661183] ( Table  6).  
The data shows that the top 5% dose of bisphosphocin Nu -3 results in a 1 log reduction in the 
CFU count of both S. aureus  and P. aeruginosa .

 is a thymidine analog w ith both 
the 3’ and 5’ sites blocked by [CONTACT_661184].  Nu-3 is 
activated through an acidification step that results in an acidi c or protonated compound that when 
dissolved in water has a pH between 2 and 2.5.  The compound can be neutralized or unactivated 
by a strong base or buff er such as sodium bicarbonate .  In addition, the molecule was designed to 
minimize the potential for t oxic side effects by [CONTACT_14662] a thymidine core molecule, natural 
phosphate linkages, and even carbon butyl blocking groups, all of which are either found in the 
body and/or feed into natural recycling pathways.

 1.2.3 Clinical Trials of Bisphosphocin Nu -3 
Bisphosphocin™ Nu -3 is a new chemical entity that has not been evaluated under a formal IND 
application in human clinical studies.  The compound was initial developed as a homeopathic 
treatment for a var iety of topi[INVESTIGATOR_661094]9.  As a homeopathic treatment, Nu -3 was used topi[INVESTIGATOR_661095] a variety of infections 
including acne, urethritis, ear infections, diabetic foot infections, and certain fungal infections.  
The information collected from these homeopathic treatments  revealed that N u-3 applied 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_661096] 14 da ys was able to improve the severity of an infection based 
visual observation.   
1.3 Rationale for Current Study  
The proposed clinical study is designed to demonstrate the safety and tolerability of increasing 
doses of topi[INVESTIGATOR_661084]™ Nu -[ADDRESS_891685] may be observed in the middle (1% w/v, or 10  mg/ml) and 
high dose  (2% w/v, or 20  mg/ml) cohorts that could justify extend ing the treatment course an  
additional seven (7) days.  An extension of the treatment duration to fourteen (14) days would 
only be initiated after five subjects in Cohorts 2 and 3 completed  the seven (7) day treatment and 
approval was given by [CONTACT_4484].  The  decision to extend treatment  of individual subjects 
showing a clinical response would then  be made by [CONTACT_62674] . 
Potential Risks  
This clinical trial is a first in human trial so there is a potential risk of an adverse reaction from  
the study drug.  Bisphosphocin Nu -3, however would be considered a nucleotide analog which is 
a class of drugs with a stro ng safety record so the likelihood of this particular risk i s considered 
Bisphosphocin NU -3 
Protocol #LAI2014 -1

Page  22 
 minimal.  The major distinction  between bisphosphocin Nu -3 and  the nucleotide an alog class are 
that both 3’ and 5’ sites are blocked and a novel acid activation step that is reversed when the 
compounds are exposed to buffers or base.  Therefore, it is anticipated that any reaction would be 
localized since the sodium bicarbonate in the blood would neutralize the compound which is 
supported by [CONTACT_661185].  In addition to a reaction from  the study 
drug, there is also the possibility that the drug is ineffective and the infection worsens which 
could necessitate more aggressive therapy or treatment.  
Potential Benefits  
The major benefit of the proposed study will  be an improvement in the wound due to the 
elimination  of the pathogenic bacteria that is inhibiting healing.  Bisphosphocin™ Nu -[ADDRESS_891686]  as it would reduce the risk of limb loss due to a worsening infection 
and the pain .

 2 OBJECTIVES  
Objective/Purpose: The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability  of 
Nu-3 when applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_547943] a chronically infected diabetic ulcer.  
A secondary objective of this study is to obtain preliminary data on the microbiological activity 
of Nu -3 as measured by [CONTACT_661186].   Based 
on pre clinical da ta, it is anticipated that improvement in the clinical wound assessment may be 
observed in the middle and high dose (1% and 2%) cohorts . 
Statement of Hypothesis:   Nu-[ADDRESS_891687] spectrum antimicrobial with a unique mechanism of 
action that involves cell membrane depolarization and rapid bacterial cell death.  As an 
antimicrobial it is particularly well suited for de velopme nt as a topi[INVESTIGATOR_661097]:  
1. These infections tend to be polymicrobial in nature , involve biofilm,  and require an 
antibiotic(s) with  a broad spectrum of activity.  
2. Many of the bacteria in these infected wounds are resistant to one or more classes of 
antibiotics making treatment difficult  
3. The directly bactericidal mode of action of Nu -3 should translate into an immediate 
reduction in the severity of the infections and offers new options in dosing.  
4. Research has shown that many chronic infections are due to the formation of biofilm 
which is inherently resistant to treatment by [CONTACT_661187] -3 
 
The proposed clinical trial design is aimed at defining the initial parameters for safety and 
tolerability in an infected wound based on the currently available preclinical data on Nu -3. The 
trial is focused on DFIs of mild to moderate severity and an area of 0.5 to 6 cm2 as a population 
of subjects that will provide the data across a r ange of pathogens and ulcers of varying duration.  
In addition, the middle and high dose (1% and 2% Nu -3) cohorts were selected so that some 
clinical impr ovement in wound assessment be obser ved which will enable better planning of 
following clinical trials.   
Route of Administration: Study medication  will be applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_661098]:  The study includes a sequential ascending dose protocol with Cohort 1 at 0.1 % w/v or 
1mg/ml, Cohort 2 at 1 % w/v or 10mg/ml, and Cohort 3 at 2% w/v or 2 0mg/ml.  In addition, two 
subjects in each cohort will be randomized to placebo.  The proposed doses  and treatment 
duration  were based on data from in vitro  antimicrobial assays, prec linical animal efficacy 
models, and toxicology studies and were selected to demonstrate safety at a high dose that 
provides a significant therapeutic margin lethal to all tested bacteria and fungi to date while 
proven safe in animal toxicology studies.

 Dosing Regime:   To establish the initial safety and tolerability of Nu -3, a twice daily application 
of the compound was selected for this clinical trial based on preclinical studies on efficacy and 
toxicology.  Subject s will be required to keep a daily log of when treatments are applied and  
contact[CONTACT_661188] a member of the study team.  
Ulcer Imaging and Area Calculations:   Photographs of the ulcer(s) will be taken at study visits 
using the Aranz Medical Silhouette™ system which allows capture of a color ima ge and 
computer calculation of ulcer(s) area, depth, and volume with more consistent and greater 
accuracy than traditional methods.  
Randomization: Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned in a 4:1 ratio to Nu -3 (n=8) or 
matching placebo (n=2) in each cohort.  
Treatment Period:   Day 1 (in clinic): Day 2 (end of SAD/Beginning of MAD) through Day 8   
Follow -Up Period: Day 1 5  
Selection of Study Population:   Type I or  II diabetes mellitus subjects  with a chronic infected 
lower extremity ulcer  defined as havi ng a DUSS score of [ADDRESS_891688]  to Nu -3 would provide little if any additional safety information.

 6 ADVERSE EVENTS AND TOXICITY MANAGEMENT  
6.1 Specification of Safety Parameters  
The primary endpoint safety variables will be the incidence of localized swelling surrounding the 
ulcer, development of a rash, joint pain, and any adverse changes in the appearance of the ulcer.   
The S afety Monitoring Committee (S MC) will receive safety reports outlining the number of 
subjects  enrolled in each cohort to date, summary of the safety data Day 0 – [ADDRESS_891720] of the SMC .  In addition, safety data from 
completed cohorts will be summarized in the same manner and included in the report.  All 
information on adverse events will be provided in a table.   
6.2 Methods and Timing for Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety Parameters  
6.2.1 Adverse Events  
Adverse Event: According to the ICH E6 guidelines, an AE is defined as any untoward medical 
occurrence in a  subject /subjects  in a clinical study regardless of its relationship to the 
administration of the study drug.  Therefore, an AE is any unintended, unfavorable, or 
unexpected sign, laboratory test, symptom, reaction, or disease temporarily associated with a  
clinical subject /subjects  during the duration of the study.  The occurrence of an AE may come to 
the attention of study personnel at a study visit and during interviews of subject s seeking medical 
care, or upon reviews conducted by [CONTACT_1750].  During  all visits and interviews after 
administration of the study drug, clinical staff will inquire about any anticipated adverse events 
or symptoms using standardized questions.  The data will be recorded on the appropriate CRFs,  
All AEs whether local or syste mic reactions not meeting the criteria for “serious adverse events” 
should be documented on the appropriate CRF.  The information to be recorded should include a 
description of the event, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of the severity, relationship to the 
study drug (assessment to be conducted only by [CONTACT_661194] a diagnosis and include the CMO, MD, PA, Nurse Practitioner, DO, DPM in podiatry and 
DDS), and time to resolution or stabilization. All AEs that o ccur during the study regardless of 
their association with the study drug must be documented appropriately and followed to adequate 
resolution.  
Any AE (i.e. a new event or an exacerbation of a pre -existing condition) with an onset date after 
the screening visit up to the last day on study (including follow -up), should be recorded as an AE 
on the appropriate CRF page(s).  
 
 
Bisphosphocin NU -3 
Protocol #LAI2014 -1  
Lakewood Amedex  Revised – 24SEP2015  
 
 
Page  36 
 An AE does not include:  
 Medical or surgical procedures) e.g. surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, transfusion); 
the condition that leads  to the procedure is an adverse event.  
 Pre-existing diseases or conditions or laboratory abnormalities present or detected prior 
to the scre ening visit, that do not worsen.  
 Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_661107], social  and/or convenience admissions).  
 Overdose of either study drug or concomitant medication without any signs or symptoms 
unless the subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115913] . 
Severity of Event: All AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_661195], including the date of onset and resolution, severity, relationship to study drug or study 
procedures, outcome and action taken with study medication.  The clinician will assess all AEs 
using a protocol d efined grading system as follows.  
Scale  Definition  
Grade 1  No intervention required because the event is mild or asymptomatic.  A clinical or diagnostic 
observation.  
Grade 2  Minimal to moderate intervention and/or localized event that requires non-invasive treatment  
Grade [ADDRESS_891721]  due to an adverse event.  
 
Relationship to Study Products:  
6.2.[ADDRESS_891722] may include vesicle (blistering) development, 
burning sensation at the ulcer site (may be mask ed by [CONTACT_661196]), increase in local 
temperature, and expansion of necrotic tissue surrounding the ulcer.

 6.2.3 Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as follows:  
 Any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
 Death;  
 Life-threatening situation  (subject is at immediate risk of death);  
 In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] (excluding those for 
study therapy or placement  of an indwelling catheter, u nless associated with other serious 
events);  
 Persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
 Congenital anomaly/ birth  defect in the offspring of a subject who received study drug;  
 Other: medically significant  events that may not result in death, be immedi ately life -
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be considered a n SAE when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they jeopardize the Subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definitio n. 
Examples of such events are:  
 Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm  
 Blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
 Development of drug dependency or drug abuse  
 
Clarification of Serious Adve rse Events  
 Death is an outcome of an adverse event, and not an adverse event in itself.  In reports of 
death due to “Disease Progression”, where no other information is provided, the death 
will be assumed to have resulted from progression of the disease be ing treated with the 
study drug(s).  
 All deaths, regardless of cause or relationship, must be reported for subjects on study and 
for deaths occurring within [ADDRESS_891723] study 
evaluation, whichever is longer.  
 “Occurring at any dose” does not imply that the subject is receiving study drug at the 
time of the event.  Dosing may have been given as treatment cycles or interrupted 
temporarily prior to the onset of the SAE, but may have contributed to the event.  
 “Life -threatening” means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the event 
as it occurred.  This does not include an event that might have led to death, if it had 
occurred with greater severity.  
 Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_98176] .  If a complication prolongs 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], it is an SAE.  
Bisphosphocin NU -3 
Protocol #LAI2014 -1  
Lakewood Amedex  Revised – 24SEP2015  
 
 
Page  38 
  “In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” means that the subject has been formally admitted to a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_113979], for any length of time.  This may or may not be overnight.  
It does not include p resentation and care within an emergency department.  
 The investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms and/or other clinical information.  In such cases the diagnosis should be 
documented as the AE and/or SAE an d not the individual signs/symptoms.    
 
A distinction should be drawn between serious and severe AEs.  An AE that is assessed as Grade 
4 (potentially life -threatening) should not be confused with a SAE.  Severity is a category 
utilized for rating the inte nsity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as Grade 4.  
An event is defined as “serious” when it meets one of the pre -defined outcomes as described 
above in Section 6.2.[ADDRESS_891724] Values or 
Abnormal Clinical Findings  
Laboratory abnormalities are usually not recorded as adverse events or serious adverse events 
unless they are associated with clinical signs and/or symptoms. However, laboratory 
abnormalities (e.g. clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, etc.) independ ent from the 
underlying medical condition, that require medical or surgical intervention, or lead to study drug 
interruption or discontinuation must be recorded as an AE, as well as an SAE, if applicable.  In 
addition, laboratory or other abnormal assessme nts (e.g. electrocardiogram, X -rays, vital signs) 
that are associated with sign and/or symptoms must be recorded as an AE or SAE if they meet 
the definition of an adverse event (or serious adverse event) as described in the protocol.  If the 
laboratory abn ormality is part of a syndrome, record the syndrome or diagnosis.   
Severity should be recorded and graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events v4.0 (CTCAE) .  For adverse events associated with laboratory abnormalities, the event 
should be graded based on the clinical severity in the context of the underlying conditions, which 
may or may not be in agreement with the grading of the laboratory abnormality.  
6.3 Serious Advent Event Reporting Procedures  
The study sponsor  is required to expedite to worldwide regulatory authorities reports of Serious 
Adverse Drug Reactions or Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs); 
therefore,  the study sponsor or its delegate  must be notified immediately regarding the 
occur rence of any SAE that occurs after the subject consents to participate in the study, including 
SAEs resulting from protocol -associated procedures performed from screening onwards. The 
procedures for reporting all SAEs, regardless of causal relationship, ar e as follows:  
 Record the SAE on the AE CRF and complete the “Serious Adverse Event Report” form.  
 E-mail or fax the SAE form to the attention of the Drug Safety Manager within 24  hours 
of the investigator’s knowledge of the event. Contact [CONTACT_661197]:  
Bisphosphocin NU -3 
Protocol #LAI2014 -1  
Lakewood Amedex  Revised – 24SEP2015  
 
 
Page  39 
  For fatal or life -threatening events, also e -mail or fax copi[INVESTIGATOR_3103], autopsy reports, 
and other documents when requested and applicable. Transmission of such documents should occur 
with Personal Subject Details de -identified, without losing the traceability of a document to the 
Subject Identifiers.  
 The study sponsor or its delegate  may request additional information from the investigator to  ensure 
the timely completion of accurate safety reports.  
The investigator must take all therapeutic measures necessary for resolution of the SAE. Any 
medications necessary for treatment of the SAE must be recorded onto the concomitant 
medication section o f the subject’s CRF and the event description section of the SAE form.  
Follow -up of adverse events will continue through the last day on study (including the follow -up 
off-study medication period of the study) and/or until the investigator and/or study spo nsor 
determine that the subject’s condition is stable.  The study sponsor or its delegate  may request 
that certain adverse events be followed until resolution.

Microbiological Response Evaluations:  
This assessment will be conducted on samples collected by [CONTACT_20616] r on Visit 2 , Visit 4, 
Visit 5, and Visit 6. of the study which will be cultured to determine: microbial load and identity 
of the infected pathogens or wound flora.  The microbiological response will be determined by a 
comparison of the results pre - and pos t-treatment.  
SMC Safety Reports:  
Safety reports will be written by [CONTACT_661198].  The first 
will follow the first interim analysis (once the first SAD/MAD Cohort 1 reaches Day 9), the 
second report will follow the seco nd interim analysis (once the second SAD/MAD Cohort 2 
reaches Day 9), and the third report will follow the third interim analysis (once the third 
SAD/MAD Cohort  3 reaches Day 9).  The study reports will be presented to the Principal 
Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_661109] -Amedex Inc.     
6.4.2 Study Termination  
This study may be terminated at any time by [CONTACT_661199] -Amedex Inc.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_661110] -Amedex  with recommendations regarding termination of the trial, however, 
Lakewood -Amedex  ultimately makes the final decision.  Reasons for terminating the study 
include:  
 If a serious or unexpected adverse event occurs and the event is judged to be probably or 
definitively related to exposure to  Nu-3, the study will be immediately suspended by  [CONTACT_1268] [INVESTIGATOR_661111].  The event will be 
reported to the SMC, IRB, and Sponsor Medical Monitor within [ADDRESS_891727] s in the 
ongoing MAD arms will be allowed to complete treatment.

 Informed consent is withdrawn  
 Subject  is lost to follow -up 
 
6.4.[ADDRESS_891729]  will be followe d until resolution/stabilization of the adverse 
event.  
In the case of a subject  prematurely withdrawing from the study, the following procedures and/or 
evaluations will be performed if possible at the time of withdrawal or as soon thereafter as 
possible (i .e. study subject  withdraws at time of visit and consents to the procedures or consents 
to come in for a visit and the procedures)  
 Photo documentation of ulcer site  using the Aranz Medical Silhouette™ system . 
 Collection of a sample for microbiological assessment  
 Assessment of adverse events  
 
In the event a subject is lost to follow -up, the site staff must make reasonable attempts to contact 
[CONTACT_423]. A minimum of two documented phone calls followed by a certified mailed letter is 
considered reasonabl e. The measures taken to follow up must be documented.  
Administrative w ithdraw als will be replaced in order to achieve the objective of 10 subjects per 
cohort  who receive a complete treatment regime.  Subjects withdrawn from the study due to an 
AE/SAE rela ted to the study drug will not be replaced.

 7 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
7.1 Study Hypothesis  
Study Hypothesis – Bisphosphocin Nu -[ADDRESS_891730] s may show improvement in the ulcer appearance, reduction in size, and 
improvement in both the DUSS  score and DFI Wound Score . 
The study hypothesis will be judged by [CONTACT_661200]:  
 Prim ary objective: To assess the safety and tolerability of escalating single and multiple 
doses of Nu -3, a novel antimicrobial of the bisphosphocin class, topi[INVESTIGATOR_661113]/diabetic ulcer  
 Secondary objectives: To assess clinical response of subject s of the ascending multiple 
dose arm of Nu -3 applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_661114]/diabetic ulcer to determine clinical 
and microbiological response.  
 
7.2 Sample Size Considerations  
The number of treated subjects is based on the desire to gain preliminary safety, tolerability and 
efficacy information to support future work, while exposing a minimal number of subjects to the 
study procedures and medication.   Inferential statistical testing is not the primary intent of the 
study, therefore, no formal sample size cal culation was considered.  Ten subjects per Cohort (1, 
2, and 3), for a total not to exceed 30, is considered sufficient to show clinical significance for 
safety and preliminary efficacy analysis.  The sample sizes for this study were set based on the 
trial design for dose escalation and safety evaluation requirements and not for statistical analysis.  
7.[ADDRESS_891731] s when all 
members of a cohort complete  Visit 4 (7 -Day MAD Follow Up) .  In addition, an interim analysis 
will be conducted after the first 5 subjects of Cohort 2 and 3 complete Visit 4 (7 -Day MAD 
Follow Up) .  The interim analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_941] S afety Monitoring Committee 
(SMC) which will be composed of  three  physicians and may include one infectious disease 
specialist, one diabetologist, and one orthopedic surgeon.  The SMC will communicate  by [CONTACT_661201] 3 occasions during the study and more frequently if necessary.  
No formal statistical interim analys es are planned for this Phase I/IIa study since it is primarily 
focused on evaluating safety and tolerability.  Interim safety data on each cohort will be provided 
to the SMC when all members of a cohort have reached Day 3.  The SMC will decide if the 
study can proceed to the next dose cohort (majority vote).  The SMC will also determine if the 
study may proceed after receiving a report about a study related Grade 3 or 4 adverse event

Coordinator and CMO as to whether further doses can be given or the entire study should be 
terminated.  In addition, the SMC will review all interim safety data pr ior to the next cohort

the next dose cohort (majority vote).  
7.[ADDRESS_891733] over time to assess the rate of change (if any) in study 
outcome measures over the full course of the study treatment and follow -up periods.  Inferential 
statistical testing is not the primary inte rest of thi s study.  
All subjects receiving any amount of study treatment will be evaluated for safety, tolerability, 
and efficacy.  An “intent to treat”  approach will be followed in all data summaries, using all 
available data in the summaries and analysis  for an as sessment of safety and tolerability while an 
“as treated” approach will be used for microbiological and clinical wound assessment data 
summaries and reports .  
All descriptive summaries and analyses will be presented in tabular and/or graphical form from 
all subjects as appropriate.  These summaries and analysis will be described in detail in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) which will be produced prior to breaking the study blind.  All 
statistical summaries and analysis will be conducted using SAS®.

 8 RESPONSIBILITIES  
8.1 Investigator Responsibilities  
8.1.1 Good Clinical Practice  
The investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in accordance with the principles of the 
“Declaration of Helsinki” (as amended in Edinburgh, Tokyo, Venice, Hong Kong, and South  
Africa), International Conference on Harmoni zation (ICH) guidelines, or with the laws and 
regulations of the country in which the research is conducted, whichever affords the greater 
protection to the study subject. For studies conducted under a United St ates IND, the investigator 
will ensure that the basic principles of “Good Clinical Practice,” as outlined in 21  CFR  312, 
subpart  D, “Responsibilities of Sponsors and Investigators,” 21  CFR, part  50, 1998, and 21  CFR, 
part 56, 1998, are adhered to.  
Since th is is a “covered” clinical trial, the investigator will ensure that 21  CFR, Part  54, 1998, is 
adhered to; a “covered” clinical trial is any “study of a drug or device in humans submitted in a 
marketing application or reclassification petition subject to th is part that the applicant or FDA 
relies on to establish that the product is effective (including studies that show equivalence to an 
effective product) or that make a significant contribution to the demonstration of safety.” This 
requires that investigato rs and all sub -investigators must provide documentation of their financial 
interest or arrangements with Lakewood -Amed ex or proprietary interests in the drug being

identities are protected from unauthorized parties. Only subject initials, date of birth, and an 
identification code (i.e., not names) should be recorded on any form or biological sample 
submitted to the Sponsor, IRB, or laboratory. The investigator must keep a screening log 
showing codes, names, and addresses for all subjects screened and for all subjects enrolled in the 
trial. 
The investigator agrees that all information received from  Lakewood -Amedex , including but not 
limited to the Investigator Brochure, this protocol, CRFs, the investigational new drug, and any 
other study information, remain the sole and exclusive property of  Lakewood -Amedex  during 
the conduct of the study and thereafter. This information is  not to be disclosed to any third party 
(except employees or agents directly involved in the conduct of the study or as required by [CONTACT_2371]) 
without prior written consent from Lakewood -Amedex . The investigator further agrees to take 
all reasonable precautions to prevent the disclosure by [CONTACT_547327].

applies to records for those subjects who fail to complete the study (even during a pre -
randomization screening period if a CRF was initiated). If a  subject withdraws from the study, 
the reason must be noted on the CRF. If a subject is withdrawn from the study because of a 
treatment -limiting adverse event, thorough efforts should be made to clearly document the 
outcome.

 8.1.7 Drug Accountability  
The investi gator or designee (i.e., pharmacist) is responsible for ensuring adequate accountability 
of all used and unused investigational medicinal product, placebos, and comparators. This 
includes acknowledgment of receipt of each shipment of study product (quantit y and condition), 
subject dispensing records, and returned or destroyed study product. Dispensing records will 
document quantities received from  the study sponsor  and quantities dispensed to subjects, 
including kit number, date dispensed, subject identifi er number, subject initials, and the initials 
of the person dispensing the medication.  
At study initiation, the monitor will evaluate the site’s standard operating procedure for 
investigational medicinal product disposal/destruction in order to ensure that  it complies with 
Lakewood -Amedex  requirements. Drug may be returned on an ongoing basis during the study , if 
appropriate. At the end of the study, following final drug inventory reconciliation by [CONTACT_2037], 
the study site will ship any remaining investi gational product  (to include empty containers)  to 
for dispos al.   
All drug supplies and associated documentation will be periodically reviewed and verified by [CONTACT_69878].

appropriately qualified personnel from Lakewood -Amedex  or its representatives, to IRBs  or to 
regulatory authority or health authority ins pectors. 
8.1.9 Protocol Compliance  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring the study is conducted in accordance with the 
procedures and evaluations described in this protocol.  
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol, Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP), or Manual of Procedures requirements.  The noncompliance maybe either on the part of 
the subject , the investigator, or the study site staff.  As a res ult of deviations, corrective actions 
are to be developed by [CONTACT_3483].  
These practices are consistent with ICH E6:  
 Compliance with Protocol sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3

10.  According to the American Diabetes 
Association approximately 8.3% of the US population suffers from diabetes and in [ADDRESS_891778] estimated that approximately 60- 80% of chronic infections involve

11.  Therefore, 
proper management of an infected diabetic foot  ulcer require s an antimicrobial therapy to cure or 
clear the infection to allow proper wound management or therapy to heal the ulcer and prevent relapse.  
Bisphosphocins™, a new class of broad spectrum antimicrobials, possess a number of characteristics that make these compounds extremely well -suited to the management of diabetic 
foot infections.  First, bisphosphocins™ are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_661088] a unique mechanism of action providing the ability to quickly cure an infection.  The compounds 
are fairly low in molecule weight, have a n excellent safety profile, and have shown good 
penetration into wounds.  In addition, there are no known bacterial mechanisms of resistance and no resistant bacteria have been identified to date eliminating a common cause of treatment failure
7. Finally, bisphosphocins have been demonstrated highly effective at killing bacteria 
established in biofilms12 which is increasingly become associated with many chronic infections.  
The preclinical studies conducted on the bisphosphocin™ class clearly support their evaluation 
in the proposed Phase I/IIa safety study in diabetic foot infections.

1.2.1 General Information Origina l -310ct2014 
Bisphosphocins™ were originally discov ered by- while conduc ting research in 
the field of antisense technology and attemp ting t~m g gene silencing. The initial 
compounds identified were protonated/ac idified oligonucleotides that demonstrated bactericidal 
activity independent of nucleotide sequence. Fmiher experimentation expanded the class to 
proto nated/ac idified nucleot ides and derivative molecules that exhibit che mical stabili ty, acid pH 
resistance, and n uclease resistan ce enabling fonnul ations for oral, intravenous, pulmonaiy, and 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_661126]1y. The lead compound, designated Nu-3, is a thymi dine derivative that would be 
considered to be in the nucleotide analogue class of mugs (Figure 1). Experimental data has 
elucidated a non-receptor dependent m echanism of action involving dis rnption of the bacterial 
cell membran e causing depolarization and rapid cell death. Bisphosphocins™ h ave an extremely 
broad spectrum of activity in vitro testing against over 70 different bacterial sti·ains canying 
various antibiotic resi stant mai·kers. There is c mTently no know n mechanism of resistan ce to the 
bisphosphocin class and because they were synthetically derived there is no na tural pool of 
resistant bacte ria. In addition, panelling the compounds against a number of strains with known 
antibi otic resistance or clinical isolates has failed to identify any cross -resistan ce or resistance 
mechanism s. The following preclinical phan naco logical and toxico logy data is provided as a 
brief smnm aiy of the activity of bi sphosphocin Nu-3 to support its potential as a ti·eatinent for 
diabetic foot infections and t his clinical protoco l sho uld be read in conjunction with the

 1.2.2 Pre-Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology 
Specific Pharmacology 
Initial experiments revealed tha t bisphosphocins ™ had an antimicrobial activity distinct from 
any currently existing antibiotic class.  Extensive in vitro and i n vivo  experiments have been 
conducted to further define their activity, identify their mechanism of action, and begin to 
establ ish a dose range to allow entry in human clinical trials.  An important factor to consider in 
the review of the following experimental results is that it is now known bisphosphocins ™ do not 
follow the simple inhibitory kinetic model of one compound binding to one target molecule of 
the current classes  of antibiotics but a more complex kinetic model involving the binding of 
multiple molecules to a bacterium resulting in direct bacteria cell death.  For this reason, the current hypothesis is bisphosphocin ™ dosing in vivo  will be based on total dose delivered and 
not on maintaining a circulating level above the minimum inhibitory concentration or at the site 
of infection to achieve an efficacy outcome because the molecules rapi[INVESTIGATOR_661127].  Therefore, the therapeutic effect of bisphosphocins™ can be manipulated by [CONTACT_661211] 
a reduction of bacterial load.  The following experiments are presented to further define, 
distinguish and compare the activity of the bisphosphocin class from traditional antibi otics in 
order to develop a comprehensive clinical plan to enable evaluation in humans.  The majority of the experimental data presented in the following sections was performed in the laboratory of outside collaborators or researchers who then published th eir results

Mouse Superficial Skin Polymicrobial Infection Model  
Briefly, mice are pre-treated with cyclophosphamide four day prior to initiating the infection to 
suppress the immune system.  The mice are anesthetized and kept sedated while the fur on the 
back dorsal surface is shaved using electric clippers followed by ‘wet shaving’ with a disposable 
razor. The skin is then sterilized with a betadine wash followed by [CONTACT_661182] a +[ADDRESS_891786] that results in a smooth, red, shiny appearance with no bleeding.  A 
droplet of the bacterial inoculum is placed directly on the abraded skin that contains Pseudomonas aeruginosa UNT034 -1 (ATCC [ZIP_CODE]) 6.35 Log10 CFU/ mouse and S. aureus  
UNT006 -4 (smith) 5.65 Log10 CFU/ mouse.  The infected area is treated with 50 microliters of 
varying concentrations of bisphosphocin Nu-3, gentamycin, mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190], or normal saline twice 
daily for 3 days.  The mice are then euthanized, the area of infected skin excised, and the CFU of both bacteria is determined by [CONTACT_661183] (Table  6).  
The data shows that the top 5% dose of bisphosphocin Nu- 3 results in a 1 log reduction in the 
CFU count of both S. aureus  and P. aeruginosa.

 1.2.3 Clinical Trials of Bisphosphocin Nu-3 
Bisphosphocin™ Nu- 3 is a new chemical entity that has not been evaluated under a formal IND 
application in human clinical studies.  The compound was initial developed as a homeopathic 
treatment for a variety of topi[INVESTIGATOR_661129]9.  As a homeopathic treatment, Nu -3 was used topi[INVESTIGATOR_661095] a variety of infections 
including acne, urethritis, ear infections, diabetic foot infections, and certain fungal infections.  The information collected from these homeopathic treatments  revealed that N u-3 applied 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_661096] 14 days was able to improve the severity of an infection based 
visual observation.   
1.3 Rationale for Current Study  
The proposed clinical study is designed to demonstrate the safety and tolerability of increasing 
doses of topi[INVESTIGATOR_661084]™ Nu- [ADDRESS_891792] may be observed in the middle (1% w/v, or 10 mg/ml) and 
high dose  (2% w/v, or 20 mg/ml) cohorts that could justify extending the treatment course an  
additional seven (7) days.  An extension of the treatment duration to fourteen (14) days would only be initiated after five subjects in Cohorts 2 and 3 completed the seven (7) day treatment and 
approval was given by [CONTACT_4484].  The  decision to extend treatment  of individual subjects 
showing a clinical response would then be made by [CONTACT_458]. 
Potential Risks  
This clinical trial is a first in human trial so there is a potential risk of an adverse reaction from 
the study drug.  Bisphosphocin Nu- 3, however would be considered a nucleotide analog which is 
a class of drugs with a strong safety record so the likelihood of this particular risk i s considered 
Bisphosphocin NU -3

 minimal.  The major distinction  between bisphosphocin Nu- 3 and the nucleotide an alog class are 
that both 3’ and 5’ sites are blocked and a novel acid activation step that is reversed when the 
compounds are exposed to buffers or base.  Therefore, it is anticipated that any reaction would be localized since the sodiu m bicarbonate in the blood would neutralize the compound which is 
supported by [CONTACT_661185].  In addition to a reaction from the study 
drug, there is also the possibility that the drug is ineffective and the infection worsens which could necessitate more aggressive therapy or treatment.  
Potential Benefits  
The major benefit of the proposed study will be an improvement in the wound due to the 
elimination  of the pathogenic bacteria that is inhibiting healing.  Bisphosphocin™ Nu- [ADDRESS_891793] as it would reduce the risk of limb loss due to a worsening infection 
and the pain.

 2 OBJECTIVES  
Objective/Pu rpose: The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability  of 
Nu-3 when applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_547943] a chronically infected diabetic ulcer. 
A secondary objective of this study is to obtain preliminary data on the microbiological activity of Nu -3 as measured by [CONTACT_661186].   Based 
on pre clinical data, it is anticipated that improvement in the clinical wound assessment may be 
observed in the middle and high dose (1% and 2%) cohorts that may j ustify extending the 
treatment for an additional 7 days. 
Statement of Hypothesis:  Nu-[ADDRESS_891794] spectrum antimicrobial with a unique mechanism of 
action that involves cell membrane depolarization and rapid bacterial cell death.  As an 
antimicrobial it is particularly well suited for development as a topi[INVESTIGATOR_661130]: 
1. These infections tend to be polymicrobial in nature , involve biofilm,  and require an 
antibiotic(s) with  a broad spectrum of activity.  
2. Many of the bacteria in these infected wounds are resistant to one or more classes of antibiotics making treatment difficult  
3. The directly bactericidal mode of action of Nu -3 should translate into an immediate 
reduction in the severity of the infections and offers new options in dosing. 
4. Research has shown that many chronic infections are due to the formation of biofilm which is inherently resistant to treatment by [CONTACT_661213]-3 
 
The proposed clinica l trial design is aimed at defining the initial parameters for safety and 
tolerability in an infected wound based on the currently available preclinical data on Nu-3. The 
trial is focused on DFIs of mild to moderate severity and an area of 0.5 to 6 cm
2 as a population 
of subjects that will provide the data across a r ange of pathogens and ulcers of varying duration.  
In addition, the middle and high dose (1% and 2% Nu- 3) cohorts were selected so that some 
clinical improvement in wound assessment be obser ved which will enable better planning of 
following clinical trials.   
Route of Administration: Study medication will be applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_661098]:  The study includes a sequential ascending dose protocol with Cohort 1 at 0.1% w/v or 
1mg/ml, Cohort 2 at 1% w/v or 10mg/ml, and Cohort 3 at 2% w/v or 20mg/ml.  In addition, two 
subjects in each cohort will be randomized to placebo.  The proposed doses  and treatment 
duration were based on data from in vitro  antimicrobial assays, preclinical animal efficacy 
models, and toxicology studies and were selected to demonstrate safety at a high dose that provides a significant therapeutic margin lethal to all tested bacteria and fungi to date while proven safe in animal toxicology studies.

 Dosing Regime:   To establish the initial safety and tolerability of Nu -3, a twice daily application 
of the compound was selected for this clinical trial based on preclinical studies on efficacy and 
toxicology.  Subject s will be required to keep a daily log of when treatments are applied and  
contact[CONTACT_661188] a member of the study team. 
Ulcer Imaging and Area Calculations:   Photographs of the ulcer(s) will be taken at study visits 
using the Aranz Medical Silhouette™ system which allows capture of a color image and 
computer calculation of ulcer(s) area, depth, and volume with more consistent and greater 
accuracy than traditional methods.  
Randomization: Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned in a 4:1 ratio to Nu -3 (n=8) or 
matching placebo (n=2) in each cohort. 
Treatment Period:   Day 1 (in clinic): Day 2 (end of SAD/Beginning of MAD) through Day 8 or 
Day 15 (Cohort 2 and 3) Follow- Up Period:  Day 1 5 or Day 22 (Cohort 2 and 3) 
Selection of Study Population:   Type I or II diabetes mellitus subjects with a chronic infected 
lower extremity ulcer defined as having a DUSS score of [ADDRESS_891795] to Nu -3 would provide little if any additional safety information.

 3 STUDY DESIGN  
Phase I/IIa, three cohort double- blind ascending dose with two dosing phases per cohort, study in 
diabet es mellitus subjects with a chronic infected diabetic ulcer  defined as having a DUSS score 
between [ADDRESS_891796](s) in SAD Phase [ADDRESS_891797] a microbiological sample taken from the infected diabetic ulcer(s) prior to initiating treatment.  In Phase 1, eligible  subjects will be 
treated with a single application of Nu -3 or placebo in a 4 to 1 ratio to judge the initial safety of 
Nu-3 over a brief 15- 30 mi nute interval and 24 hour interval .  Bisphosphocin Nu- 3 will be 
applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_661099]  (DUSS score: 1 -3; DFI wound score: 1-9), and the 
area observed over a [ADDRESS_891798] the  nonabrasive, hypoallergenic  bandage on the wound, avoid getting the 
bandage wet,  and return for a follow up visit within 24 ± 2h.  At the follow up visit, the bandage 
will be removed, the ulcer visually examined , photographed using the Aranz Medical 
Silhouette™ system , and the subject  cleared for the MA D Phase 2 based on the 
recommendation/decision  of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_661131].   
In Phase 2, eligible subjects, which are those who have been approved by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_661101] [ADDRESS_891799] will then be given a 7-day supply of study drug, non-abrasive bandages, a home diary , 
written instructions for care and hygiene, and sen t home to continue treatment.  On Day  9 ± 2h or 
earlier in the case of any adverse events, subjects will return to the clinic for an examination, 
including visual evaluation  of the ulcer, vital signs, adverse events, photo documentation using 
the Aranz  Medical Silhouette ™ system , collection of a sample for microbiological assessment, 
and concomitant medication use.  A final follow up visit will be scheduled for Day [ADDRESS_891800] may be observed in the middle (1% w/v, or 10mg/ml) and high- dose (2% w/v, or 20mg/ml) cohorts that could justify extending the treatment course an 
additional seven (7) days.  An extension of the treatment duration to fourteen (14) days would only be initiated after five subjects in Cohorts 2 and 3 completed the seven (7) day treatment and approval was given by [CONTACT_4484].  The decision to extend treatment of individual subjects showing a clinical response would then be made by [CONTACT_458].

 6 ADVERSE EVENTS AND TOXICITY M ANAGEMENT 
6.1 Specification of Safety Parameters  
The primary endpoint safety variables will be the incidence of localized swelling surrounding the ulcer, development of a rash, joint pain, and any adverse changes in the appearance of the ulcer.   
The Safety Mo nitoring Committee (S MC) will receive safety reports outlining the number of 
subjects enrolled in each cohort to date, summary of the safety data Day 0 – [ADDRESS_891827] of the SMC .  In addition, safety data from 
completed cohorts will be summarized in the same  manner and included in the report.  All 
information on adverse events will be provided in a table.   
6.2 Methods and Timing for Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety Parameters  
6.2.1 Adverse Events  
Adverse Event: According to the ICH E6 guidelines, an AE is defined as any untoward medical 
occurrence in a subject /subjects in a clinical study regardless of its relationship to the 
administration of the study drug.  Therefore, an AE is any unintended, unfavorable, or 
unexpected sign, laboratory test, symptom, react ion, or disease temporarily associated with a 
clinical subject /subjects during the duration of the study.  The occurrence of an AE may come to 
the attention of study personnel at a study visit and during interviews of subject s seeking medical 
care, or upon reviews conducted by [CONTACT_1750].  During all visits and interviews after 
administration of the study drug, clinical staff will inquire about any anticipated adverse events or symptoms using standardized questions.  The data will be recorded on the appropriate CRFs,  
All AEs whether local or systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for “serious adverse events” should be documented on the appropriate CRF.  The information to be recorded should include a description of the event, time of onset, clinicia n’s assessment of the severity, relationship to the 
study drug (assessment to be conducted only by [CONTACT_661219] a diagnosis and include the CMO, MD, PA, Nurse Practitioner, DO, DPM in podiatry and DDS), and time t o resolution or stabilization. All AEs that occur during the study regardless of 
their association with the study drug must be documented appropriately and followed to adequate resolution.  
Any AE (i.e. a new event or an exacerbation of a pre -existing condition) with an onset date after 
the screening visit up to the last day on study (including follow -up), should be recorded as an AE 
on the appropriate CRF page(s).

 An AE does not include: 
• Medical or surgical procedures) e.g. surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, transfusion); 
the condition that leads to the procedure is an adverse event.  
• Pre-existing diseases or conditions or laboratory abnormalities present or detected prior 
to the scre ening visit, that do not worsen. 
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_89783], social  and/or convenience admissions).  
• Overdose of either study drug or concomitant medication without any signs or symptoms unless the subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115913] . 
• Events related to the underlying condition under study should not be reported as adver se 
events unless they are co nsidered to be study related. 
Severity of Event: All AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_661220], including the date of onset and resolution, severity, relationship to study drug or study procedures, outcome and action taken with study medication.  The clinician will assess all AEs 
using a protocol defined grading system as follows. 
Scale  Definition  
Grade 1  No intervention required because the event is mild or asymptomatic.  A clinical or diagnostic 
observation.  
Grade 2  Minimal to moderate intervention and/or localized event that requires non -invasive treatment  
Grade [ADDRESS_891828]  due to an adverse event.  
 
Relationship to Study Products:  
6.2.[ADDRESS_891829] may include vesicle ( blistering ) development, 
burning sensation at the ulcer site (may be masked by [CONTACT_661196]), increase in local 
temperature, and exp ansion of necrotic tissue surrounding the ulcer.

 6.2.3 Serious Adverse Events 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as follows:  
• Any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes: 
• Death;  
• Life-threatening situation  (subject is at immediate risk of death); 
• In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] (excluding those for 
study therapy or placement  of an indwelling catheter, unless associated with other serious 
events);  
• Persistent or signific ant disability/incapacity;  
• Congenital anomaly/ birth  defect in the offspring of a subject who received study drug; 
• Other: medically significant  events that may not result in death, be immediately life -
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be consider ed an SAE when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they jeopardize the Subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Examples of such events are:  
• Intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm 
• Blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
• Development of drug dependency or drug abuse  
 
Clarification of Serious Adverse Events  
• Death is an outcome of an adverse event, and not an adve rse event in itself.  In reports of 
death due to “Disease Progression”, where no other information is provided, the death 
will be assumed to have resulted from progression of the disease being treated with the study drug(s). 
• All deaths, regardless of cause or relationship, must be reported for subjects on study and 
for deaths occurring within [ADDRESS_891830] study evaluation, whichever is longer.  
• “Occurring at any dose” does not imply that the subject is receiving study drug at the 
time of the event.  Dosing may have been given as treatment cycles or interrupted 
temporarily prior to the onset of the SAE, but may have contributed to the event. 
• “Life -threatening” means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the event 
as it occurred.  This does not include an event that might have led to death, if it had occurred with greater severity.  
• Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_98176].  If a complication prolongs 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], it is an SAE.  
Bisphosphocin NU -3 
Protocol #LAI2014-1  
Lakewood Amedex  Original – 31Oct2014  
 
 
Page 40 
 • “In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” means that the subject has been formally admitted to a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_113979], for any length of time.  This may or may not be overnight.  It does not include presentation and care within an emergency department. 
• The investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms and/or other clinical information.  In such cases the diagnosis should be 
documented as the AE and/or SAE and not the individual signs/symptoms.     
A distinction should be drawn between serious and severe AEs.  An AE that is assessed as Grade 
4 (potentially life -threatening) should not be confused with a SAE.  Severity is a category 
utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as Grade 4.  
An event is defined as “serious” when it meets one of the pre- defined outcomes as described 
above in Section 6.2.3.  
6.2.[ADDRESS_891831] Values or 
Abnormal Clinical Findings  
Laboratory abnormalities a re usually not recorded as adverse events or serious adverse events 
unless they are associated with clinical signs and/or symptoms. However, laboratory abnormalities (e.g. clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, etc.) independent from the underlying me dical condition, that require medical or surgical intervention, or lead to study drug 
interruption or discontinuation must be recorded as an AE, as well as an SAE, if applicable.  In addition, laboratory or other abnormal assessments (e.g. electrocardiogra m, X -rays, vital signs) 
that are associated with sign and/or symptoms must be recorded as an AE or SAE if they meet the definition of an adverse event (or serious adverse event) as described in the protocol.  If the laboratory abnormality is part of a syndrome, record the syndrome or diagnosis.   
Severity should be recorded and graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events v4.0 (CTCAE) .  For adverse events associated with laboratory abnormalities, the event 
should be graded based on the  clinical severity in the context of the underlying conditions, which 
may or may not be in agreement with the grading of the laboratory abnormality. 
6.3 Serious Advent Event Reporting Procedures  
The study sponsor  is required to expedite to worldwide regulatory  authorities reports of Serious 
Adverse Drug Reactions or Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs); 
therefore,  the study sponsor or its delegate  must be notified immediately regarding the 
occurrence of any SAE that occurs after the subject consents to participate in the study, including SAEs resulting from protocol -associated procedures performed from screening onwards. The 
procedures for reporting all SAEs, regardless of causal relationship, are as follows: 
• Record the SAE on the AE CRF and complete the “Serious Adverse Event Report” form. 
• E-mail or fax the SAE form to the attention of the Drug Safety Manager within 24 hours 
of the investigator’s knowledge of the event. Contact [CONTACT_10856]:

dete1mine that the subject's condition is stable. The study sponsor or its delegate may request 
that ce1iain adverse events be followed until resolution. 
6.3.[ADDRESS_891833] regarding the 
possible effects of prior study diug exposure on the fetus and the need to info1m the study site of

Visit 5, and Visit 6.of the study which will be cultured to determine: microbial load and identity 
of the infected pathogens or wound flora.  The microbiological response will be determined by a comparison of the results pre- and post- treatment.  
SMC Safety Reports:  
Safety reports will be written by [CONTACT_661198].  The first will follow the first interim analysis (once the first SAD/MAD cohort 1 reaches Day 9), the 
second report will follow the second interim analysis (once the second SAD/MAD cohort 2 reaches Day 9), and the third report will follow the third interim analysis (once  the third 
SAD/MAD cohort 3 reaches Day 9).  The study reports will be presented to the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_661136]-Amedex Inc.    
6.4.2 Study Termination  
This study may be terminated at any time by [CONTACT_661199]- Amedex Inc.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_661110]- Amedex  with recommendations regarding termination of the trial, however,

 • If a serious or unexpected adverse event occurs and the event is judged to be probably or definitively related to exposure to Nu-3, the study will be immediately suspended by [CONTACT_1268] [INVESTIGATOR_661137] w of all appropriate safety data.  The event will be 
reported to the SMC, IRB, and Sponsor Medical Monitor within [ADDRESS_891835] s in the 
ongoing MAD arms will be al lowed to complete treatment.  
• Safety Monitoring Committee terminates the study based on interim safety review  
• In the event of a clinical hold being placed on the study following a report of an AE to the FDA  
• At the discretion of Lakewood- Amedex . 
 
6.4.[ADDRESS_891836]  will be 
removed from participation in the study if any of the following occur: 
• Any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, intercurrent illness, or other 
medical condition or situation arises such that in the judgment of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_661138] 
• A protocol violation/deviation occurs that might compromise the integrity of the data, 
compliance, or subject safety  
• Informed consent is withdrawn 
• Subject is lost to follow -up 
 
6.4.[ADDRESS_891837]  will be followed until resolution/stabilization of the adverse 
event. 
In the case of a subject  prematurely withdrawing from the study, the following procedures and/or 
evaluations will be performed if possible at the time of withdrawal or as soon thereafter as 
possible (i .e. study subject withdraws at time of visit and consents to the procedures or consents 
to come in for a visit and the procedures) 
• Photo documentation of ulcer site using the Aranz Medical Silhouette™ system. 
• Collection of a sample for microbiological assessment

 7 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
7.1 Study Hypothesis  
Study Hypothesis – Bisphosphocin Nu- 3 solution applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_547943] a chronic infected diabetic 
ulcer will be safe and well tolerated in subjects suffering from diabetes mellitus.  In addition,  the 
Nu-3 MAD Arm subjects may show improvement in the ulcer appearance, reduction in size, and 
improvement in both the DUSS  score and DFI Wound Score. 
The study hypothesis will be judged by [CONTACT_661200]: 
• Primary objective: To assess the safety and tolerability of escalating single and multiple 
doses of Nu- 3, a novel antimicrobial of the bisphosphocin class, topi[INVESTIGATOR_661113]/diabetic ulcer 
• Secondary objectives: To assess clinical response of subject s of the ascending multiple 
dose arm of Nu -3 applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_661114]/diabetic ulcer to determine clinical 
and microbiological response.  
 
7.2 Sample Size Considerations  
The number of treated subjects is based on the desire to gain preliminary safety,  tolerability and 
efficacy information to support future work, while exposing a minimal number of subjects to the 
study procedures and medication.   Inferential statistical testing is not the primary intent of the study, therefore, no formal sample size calculation was considered.  Ten subjects per Cohort (1, 2, and 3), for a total not to exceed 30, is considered sufficient to show clinical significance for safety and preliminary efficacy analysis.  The sample sizes for this study were set based on the trial design for dose escalation  and safety evaluation requirements and not for statistical analysis.  
7.3 Planned Interim Analysis  
There will be an interim analysis to review safety data on each cohort of subjects when all 
members of a cohort complete Visit 4 (7 -Day MAD Follow Up) .  In addition, an interim analysis 
will be conducted after the first 5 subjects of Cohort 2 and 3 complete Visit 4 (7 -Day MAD 
Follow Up).  The interim analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_941] S afety Monitoring Committee 
(SMC) which will be composed of  three  physicians and may include one infectious disease  
specialist, one diabetologist, and one orthopedic surgeon.  The SMC will communicate by [CONTACT_661201] 3 occasions during the study and more frequently if necessary. 
No formal statistical interim analys es are planned for this Phase I/IIa study since it is primarily 
focused on evaluating safety and tolerability.  Interim safety data on each cohort will be provided 
to the SMC when all members of a cohort have reached Day 3.   The SMC will decide if the 
study can proceed to the next dose cohort (majority vote).  The SMC will also determine if the study may proceed after receiving a report about a study related Grade 3 or 4 adverse event

7.3.[ADDRESS_891838] Coordinator and CMO as to whether further doses can be given or the entire study should be 
terminated.  In addition, the SMC  will review all interim safety data prior to the next cohort 
beginning treatment.  At each review, the SMC will determine whether the study may proceed to the next dose cohort (majority vote). 
7.[ADDRESS_891839] over time to assess the rate of change (if any) in study outcome measures over the full course of the study treatment and follow -up periods.  Inferential 
statistical testing i s not the primary inte rest of this study. 
All subjects receiving any amount of study treatment will be evaluated for safety, tolerability, and efficacy.  An “intent to treat”  approach will be followed in all data summaries, using all 
available data in the summaries and analysis  for an assessment of safety and tolerability while an 
“as treated” approach will be used for microbiological and clinical wound assessment data summaries and reports.  
All descriptive summaries and analyses will be presented in tabu lar and/or graphical form from 
all subjects as appropriate.  These summaries and analysis will be described in detail in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) which will be produced prior to breaking the study blind.  All statistical summaries and analysis w ill be conducted using SAS®.

 8 RESPONSIBILITIES  
8.1 Investigator Responsibilities  
8.1.1 Good Clinical Practice  
The investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in accordance with the principles of the “Declaration of Helsinki” (as amended in Edinburgh, Tokyo, Venice, Hong Kong, and South 
Africa), International Conference on Harmoni zation (ICH) guidelines, or with the laws and 
regulations of the country in which the research is conducted, whichever affords the greater 
protection to the study subject. For studies conducted under a [LOCATION_002] IND, the investigator will ensure that the basic principles of “Good Clinical Practice,” as outlined in 21  CFR 312, 
subpart D, “Responsibilities of Sponsors and Investigators,” 21 CFR, part  50, 1998, and 21 CFR, 
part 56, 1998, are adhered to. 
Since this is a “covered” clinical trial, the investigator will ensure that 21  CFR, Part  54, 1998, is 
adhered to; a “covered” clinical trial is any “study of a drug or device in humans submitted in a 
marketing application or reclassification petition subject to this part that the applicant or FDA relies on to establish that the product is effective (including studies that show equivalence to an effective product) or that make a significant contribution to the demonstration of safety.” This requires that investigators and all sub -investigators must provide documentation of their financial 
interest or arrangements with Lakewood- Amed ex or proprietary interests in the drug being 
studied. This documentation must be provided before participation of the investigator and any sub-investigator. The investigator and sub- investigator agree to notify Lakewood- Ame dex of any 
change reportable interests during the study and for one year following completion of the study. Study completion is defined as the date that the last subject has completed the protocol defined 
activities.  
This study is also subject to and will be conducted in accordance with 21 CFR, part  320, 1993, 
“Retention of Bioavailability and Bioequivalence Testing Samples.”  
8.1.[ADDRESS_891840] (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) Approval 
This protocol and any accompanying material to be provided to the subject (such as advertisements, subject information sheets, or descriptions of the study used to obtain informed consent) wi ll be submitted by [CONTACT_661222] (21CFR Part 56) . Approval from the IRB must be obtained before  starting the study and 
must  be documented in a letter to the investigator specifying the protocol number, protocol 
version, protocol date, documents reviewed, and date on which the committee met and granted the approval. 
Any modifications made to the protocol after receipt of IRB  approval must also be submitted to 
the IRB  for approval before implementation.

Page [ADDRESS_891841]’s legally authorized representati ve and the person obtaining consent.  The information in 
the informed consent must comply with 21CFR Part 50, Subpart B.  The element s of the 
informed consent must be consistent with the requirements of 21CFR Part 50.25. 
8.1.[ADDRESS_891842] assure that subjects’ anonymity will be strictly maintained and that their 
identities are protected from unauthorized parties. Only subject initials, date of birth, and an identification code (i.e., not names) should be recorded on any form or biologica l sample 
submitted to the Sponsor, IRB , or laboratory. The investigator must keep a screening log 
showing codes, names, and addresses for all subjects screened and for all subjects enrolled in the trial. 
The investigator agrees that all information received from  Lakewood- Amedex , including but not 
limited to the Investigator Brochure, this protocol, CRFs, the investigational new drug, and any other study information, remain the sole and exclusive property of  Lakewood- Amedex  during 
the conduct of the study and thereafter. This information is not to be disclosed to any third party (except employees or agents directly involved in the conduct of the study or as required by [CONTACT_2371]) without prior written consent from Lakewood- Amedex . The investigator further agrees to take 
all reasonable precautions to prevent the disclosure by [CONTACT_250249]. 
8.1.[ADDRESS_891843] the following two categories: (1)  investigator’s study file, and 
(2) subject clinical source documents.  
The investigator’s study file will contain the protocol/amendments, CRF and query forms, IRB and governmental approval with correspondence, informed consent, drug records, staff curriculum vitae an d authorization forms, and other appropriate documents and correspondence. 
The required source data are listed in the Source Data verification Plan, and should include sequential notes containing at least the following information for each subject:  
• subject identification (name, date of birth, gender); 
• documentation that subject meets eligibility criteria, i.e., history, physical examination, 
and confirmation of diagnosis (to support inclusion and exclusion criteria); 
Bisphosphocin NU -3 
Protocol #LAI2014-1

Page 50 
 • participation in trial (including trial number);  
• trial discussed and date of informed consent; 
• dates of all visits;  
• documentation that protocol specific procedures were performed; 
• results of efficacy parameters, as required by [CONTACT_760];  
• start and end date (including dose regimen) of trial me dication (preferably drug 
dispensing and return should be documented as well); 
• record of all adverse events and other safety parameters (start and end date, and preferably including causality and intensity); 
• concomitant medication (including start and end date, dose if relevant; dose changes 
should be motivated); 
• date of trial completion and reason for early discontinuation, if applicable. 
 
All clinical study documents must be retained by [CONTACT_12415] [ADDRESS_891844] approval of a marketing application in an ICH region (i.e., [LOCATION_002], Europe, or Japan) and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region; or, if no application is filed or if the application is not approved for such indication, until [ADDRESS_891845] be completed and signed by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_119251]-investigator (as appropriate) within a reasonable time period after data collection. This also 
applies to records for those subjects who fail to complete the study (even during a pre -
randomization screening period if a CRF was initiated). If a subject withdraws from the study, the reason must be noted on the CRF. If a subject is withdrawn from the study because of a treatment- limiting adverse event, thorough efforts should be made to clearly document the 
outcome.

 8.1.7 Drug Accountability  
The investigator or designee (i.e., pharmacist) is responsible for ensuring adequate accountability 
of all used and unused investigational medicinal product, placebos, and comparators. This 
includes acknowledgment of receipt of each shipment of study product (quantity and condition), subject dispensing records, and returned or destroyed study product. Dispensing records will document quantities received from  the study sponsor and quantities dispensed to subjects, 
including kit number, date dispensed, subject identifier number, subject initials, and the initials 
of the person dispensing the medication. 
At study initiation, the monitor will evaluate the site’s standard operating procedure for 
investigational medicinal product disposal/destruction in order to ensure that it complies with Lakewood- Amedex  requirements. Drug may be returned on an ongoing basis during the study , if 
appropriate. At the end of the study, following final drug inventory reconciliation by [CONTACT_2037], the study site will ship any remaining investigational product (to include empty containers)  to 
Xcelience Inc. for dispos al.   
All drug supplies and associated documentation will be periodically reviewed and verified by [CONTACT_5276].  
8.1.[ADDRESS_891846]  be made available to 
appropriately qualified personnel from Lakewood- Amedex  or its representatives, to IRBs  or to 
regulatory authority or health authority ins pectors.  
8.1.9 Protocol Compliance  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring the study is conducted in accordance with the procedures and e valuations described in this protocol.  
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), or Manual of Procedures requirements.  The noncompliance maybe either on the part of the subject , the investiga tor, or the study site staff.  As a result of deviations, corrective actions 
are to be developed by [CONTACT_3483]. 
These practices are consistent with ICH E6:  
• Compliance with Protocol sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3 
• Quality Assurance and Quality Control, section 5.1.1 
• Noncompliance sections 5.20.1, and 5.20.[ADDRESS_891847] be promptly reported to

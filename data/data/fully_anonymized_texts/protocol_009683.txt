 3 Research Objectives and Specific Aims:  
Diabetes is arguably the most urgent healthcare challenge of the 21st century.  An estimated that [ADDRESS_1065652] been diagnosed with diabetes, with approxim ately 90 –95% of cases due to type 2 
diabetes (T2D).[ADDRESS_1065653]  of patients  on basal 
insulin and one-fourth  of those on basal insulin an d oral antidiabetes drugs  achieved target A1C <7.0% .3-[ADDRESS_1065654] common barriers with insulin injections are socio -economic factors, complexity of treatment and 
adherence to prescribed dosing time, which lead to frequent insulin omission s, as reported in more than half of 
patients with diabetes.9 The frequency of insulin injection irregularities (omission, mistiming and dosing) are 
similar for patients u sing basal insulin alone versus those using basal with bolus  insulin regimens.[ADDRESS_1065655] -worn smartwatch , 
11 and a variety of insulin pens with memory functions and electronic display.12-14 However, current devices 
are design ed for specific insulin brand s, are not interchangeable  among available insulin pens , and they lack 
alarm systems to notify patients and caretakers about insulin delays and missing doses.  
Insulclock®[ADDRESS_1065656] injection , type of insulin used and temperature. 
Insulclock has a n alarm system with visual and sound  alerts to prevent  insulin omissions  and 
mistiming . Via Bluetooth and s mart-phone technology, information is store d and read ily 
available for data analysis by [CONTACT_1962], caregivers and healthcare professionals.  The 
Insulclock ’s real time memory and alert system are likely to improve treatment adherence , 
patient 's satisfaction , and quality of life measures , which may improve glycemic control in 
insulin treated patients with T2D.   
 
Study Aims:  
Aim 1 .  To determine whether the Insulclock system results in improved treatment adherence and 
reductions in treatment irregularities (insulin omission, mistiming and dosing) compared to 
conventional insulin pen device.   Patients with inadequately controlled T2D treated with oral antidiabetic 
agents and basal insulin (NPH, glargine or detemir) w ill be randomized to Group A: Insulclock  device with 
feedback  or to Group B:  Insulclock without feedback .  All patients will use the Insulclock device attached to 
glargine U100 insulin pens (SoloStar®) during the study period. Participants in Group A will  receive daily 
information on their smartphone on insulin administration (time and dosing) as well as reminders in the event 
of missing doses. Participants in Group B, will use the Insulclock, but will not receive feedback on insulin 
administration .  Diffe rences in insulin injection irregularities (omission, mistiming and dosing) will be 
compared at each clinic visit during the study period.  
Hypothesis: The Insulclock device will improve adherence reducing insulin omission, mistiming and dosing 
errors comp ared to standard pen device.  
 
Aim 2.  To determine whether the Insulclock system yields higher treatment satisfaction scores in 
poorly controlled patients with T2D compared to a conventional insulin pen device. Patients with 
inadequately controlled T2D (HbA1c ≥ 7.0%) treated with oral antidiabetic agents and basal insulin once daily 
(NPH, glargine or detemir) will be enrolled in a 24 week randomized, cross -over clinical trial comparing the 

Insulclock Proposal, 06/01 /[ADDRESS_1065657] insulin pen. Treatment satisfaction will be assessed with the 
Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire Status (DTSQs) 16,17 to be administered at baseline (week 0) 
and at weeks 12 and 24 to assess relative changes in the DTSQ between interventions.  The amplitude of the 
score on the DTSQc gives the degree of change in satisfaction while the direction (posit ive or negative) will 
provide guidance on the preference of therapy .   
Hypothesis: The Insulclock device will improve treatment satisfaction compared to standard insulin pen 
device.  
 
Aim 3.   To explore whether changes in adherence with the Insulclock improves  glycemic control, as 
measure by [CONTACT_51971]1c from baseline, when compared to conventional insulin pen device.  HbA1c 
will be measured at week 0  and at weeks 12 and 24 to assess differences in glycemic control  between group s. 
Hypothesis: The I nsulclock device by [CONTACT_775884].  
 
II. BACKGROUND AND STATUS  OF WORK IN THE FIELD.  
Basal Insulin therapy in Type [ADDRESS_1065658] potent agent for the treatment of diabetes. Insulin therapy is the treatment of 
choice for patients with severely elevated H bA1c and symptoms of hyperglycemia , 18,19 and in patients with 
inadequate glycemic control despi[INVESTIGATOR_775874] -insulin injectables .18,19 Clinical guidelines 
recommend the use of basal insulin , given once (glargine, detemir, degludec) or twice daily ( neutral protamine 
Hagedorn [ NPH ], detemir) as  add-on to non -insulin agents. Basal insulin analogs are preferred over NPH  
insulin because a single basal dose provides a relatively flat serum insulin concentration for up to 24 hours. 
Newer basal insulin formulations – glargine U300 and degludec - have more prolonged and stable 
pharma cokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) characteristics than glargine U100 and detemir.18,20 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_775875], a systematic review of 218 randomized clinical trials found that 
only 39% of patients with T2D treated with basal insulin achieve an HbA1c <7%.[ADDRESS_1065659] reporting an average of three epi[INVESTIGATOR_775876]/non -
adherence within the previous month.7,[ADDRESS_1065660] missed or mistimed doses were unintentional (~80%) .  The most common barriers with insulin injections 
are socio -economic factors, complexity of treatment and adherence to prescribed dosing time, which lead to 
frequent insulin omission reported in more than half of patients with diabetes.9 The insulin tracking and alert 
system will address the issue of nonadherence by  [CONTACT_775885].   The alarm system can be programmed at any time(s) of the day alerting patients 
and caretakers on delayed injections, which may reduce missing doses.  
 
Use of Insulin Pens and Patient Satisfaction    
Multiple studies have reported that insulin pen devices are associated with greater treatment satisfaction and 
patient preference as well as improved dose accuracy compared to the traditional vial/syringe.28-37 
Standardized assessments of treatment satisfaction, including the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction 
Questionnaires (DTSQs and DTSQc) and the  Insulin Delivery System Rating Questionnaire (IDSRQ), have 
been validated and tested for reliability.16,17,38,[ADDRESS_1065661] evaluated patient satisfaction 
with these tools.28,30 Improving treatment satisfaction can lead to improvements in quality of life.40 
Improvements in quality of life are often cited as leading to greater adherence to treatment protocols and 
insulin administration.41

 6 Significance and Innovation :  In the US, all patients with type 1 diabetes  are treated with ba sal insulin alone  
and about 30% of patients with type 2 diabetes are treated with basal insulin  alone or in combination with oral 
agents to achieve and maint ain glycemic control .3 About 30.3% of patients on basal insulin and 24.2% of 
those on basal insulin and oral antidiabetes drugs achieved target A1C <7.0%.3 A systematic review of 218 
randomized trials reported that 39% of patients with T2D treated with basal insulin achieve an HbA1c <7%.[ADDRESS_1065664] reporting an average of three 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_775876]/non -adherence within the previous month.7,[ADDRESS_1065665] the alarm systems to notify patients and caretakers about insulin dela ys and missing doses.  
The insulin tracking and alert system may be of great help in reminding patients about insulin dosing and 
avoiding missing insulin injections .  In addition, the Insulclock will also allow us to assess treatment 
nonadherence. Differences in  treatment adherence before  and after the  crossed over will provide objective 
evidence of compliance and treatment adherence .

 8 Study Visits  
Screening (Visit 1)  
Approximately 1-2 weeks prior to the start of the study, all potential study patients will be screened to check 
their eligibility after signing the informed consent form (ICF) and assigned a patient identification number. 
Medical history, physical examination, height, weight, vital signs, pre -existing conditions, and concomit ant 
medications will be recorded during this visit. Laboratory assessments performed at Visit [ADDRESS_1065669] all glucose levels, insulin doses, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_30344].  
Insulin administration technique will be reviewed prior to randomization to ensure good technique.  
Reinforcement will be provided as needed during the follow -up visits.   
Only eligible p atients treated with a once daily insulin dose of NPH, detemir, glargine insulin will be switch ed 
to SoloSTAR pen (glargine U100) at a total dose (TDD).  
Antidiabetic agents will be continued at the same dose, except insulin secretagogues which can be stopped if 
HbA1c is <8% or reduced by [CONTACT_775887]1c is >8%.   
Patients will be instructed in performing glucose testing at home before meals, with a minimum of [ADDRESS_1065670] perform a 7 -point SMBG 
(fasting, before meals, 2 hours after meals, and bedtime) done between [ADDRESS_1065671] the device to their ph ones will be explained . They will be asked to use 
the Insulclock with their insulin pen, to get familiarized  with it . An assessment will be done after the week of 
using the device in order to review quality and understanding of the technology. Those subjec ts that fail to use 
the device properly will be deemed Screen Failures.

out of the 4 pre -meal and bedtime glucose measurements per day . 
Crossover visit (V isit 8, week 1 4) 
The following activities occur during crossover visit:  
 At midpoint ( week 12 ), patients will be converted to the alternate treatment Arm (cross -over design).   
 Patients will receive detailed instruction on the use of the Insulclock system  
 Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire Status (DTSQs)  
 Bloo d sampling for HbA1c assessment to determine efficacy of treatment  
 Study diaries collected and reviewed for BG levels, epi[INVESTIGATOR_17221], insulin self -

Visit 14 (End of Stud y) 
 Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire Status (DTSQs)  
 Blood sampling for HbA1c assessment to determine efficacy of treatment  
 Study diaries collected and reviewed for BG levels, epi[INVESTIGATOR_17221], insulin self -
administration  
 
During each visit, participants  will have their insulin dose titrated to achieve a fasting glucose <130 mg/dL as 
detailed in the glargine titration algorithm.  Once the fasting glucose 3 -day average is <130 mg/dL, insulin 
doses will be ke pt constant, unless the partic ipant experiences recurrent hypoglycemia or severe 
hyperglycemia.   
 
Insulin Glargine Titration Schedule.  Make adjustment every [ADDRESS_1065672] has been on insulin 
U100 as follows:  
 
Mean 3 day consecutive Fasting SMBG  Glargine U1 00 Dose Adjustment  
>180 mg/dL  Increase glargine dose by 4 IU  
130 – ≤ 180 mg/dL  Increase glargine dose by 2 IU  
71 – ≤ 130 mg/dL  No change  
≤ 70 mg/dL  Decrease insulin glargine dose by 10%  
≤ 40 mg/dL  Decrease insulin glargine dose by 20 -30% 
 
Upward titration s hould be stopped for one week after a case of hypoglycemia confirmed by a SMBG reading 
< 70 mg/dL unless there is an adequate  explanation (e.g. omission of a meal)  for the event . The study staff 
should instruct the  subject to contact [CONTACT_775888] . 
 
Insulclock Proposal, 06/01 /2018  
 10 Treatment satisfaction will be assessed with the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire Status 
(DTSQs) 16,17 to be administered at baseline (week 0) and at weeks 12 and 24 to assess relative changes in the 
DTSQ between interventions.  The amplitude of the score on the DTSQc gives the degree of change in 
satisfactio n while the direction (positive or negative) will provide guidance on the preference of one device 
over the other.   
 
Concomitant Medications:   
During the study treatment period, the following medications are prohibited:   
 Initiation of any antidiabetic age nts, including oral or injectable antihyperglycemic agents  
 Systemic use of glucocorticoids for more than 10 consecutive days .  
 Initiation of any weight loss drugs  
 For patients in both groups, background metformin should be maintained throughout the study  unless 
down -titration is required for safety reasons.   
Assessment of Results:  
The primary outcome of treatment adherence  with the use of Insulclock with feedback or no feedback 
information (blinded) will be determined by [CONTACT_775889], 
mistiming and dosing.  Number insulin irregularities will be registered on the Insulclock device and data will 
be retrieved during each clinic visit.  
For treatment satisfaction , subjects’ responses to questions 1, 7 and 8 o f the DTSQc  will be used .  A 
comparison of the score on the DTSQs from week 12 to week 24 as well as using the score on the other 
questions of the DTSQc, which would overcome the ceiling limitation of using the DTSQs by [CONTACT_5071], will also 
be used to assess treatment satisfaction 16,17.  The Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire Status 
(DTSQs) form will be administered at weeks 0, 12 and 24.   
Questionnaires will be given at week 0 for standardization purposes.  The amplitude of the score on the 
DTSQc gives the degree of change in satisfaction while the direction (positive or negative) will provide 
guidance on the preference of one device over the other (i.e., if we predict  that patients greatly prefer alarm 
reminders over nothing and he/she started the group 1 with daily reminders  then transitioned to group 2 
without the daily reminders , his/her score would be ‘ -3’, whereas if he/she was initially not getting the daily 
reminders  followed by [CONTACT_775890] ‘+3’).  
Quality of life  will be assessed at baseline and again at weeks [ADDRESS_1065673] of 
the type of therapy on this outcome.  Patients will be given the Diabete s Quality of Life Clinical Trial 
Questionnaire -Revised (DQLCTQ -R), the Problem Areas In Diabetes scale (PAID) and the Elderly Diabetes 
Burden Scale (EDBS) at baseline, weeks [ADDRESS_1065674] of 
the treatmen t regimen 45-47. 
Glycemi c Control  will be assessed via HbA1c at weeks -1, 12 and 24 and via fasting blood glucose averages 
at weeks 0, 12 and 24 from point of care testing during the preceding week.  
 
Duration of study  
The duration of this study will include a 26-week treatment ph ase and a safety clinic or telephone follow -up 
visit at week 28. 
 
Interim analysis  
There will be no planned interim analysis of the data.

Potential Risks to the Subject s: 
There are no major risks associated with the intervention.   
 
Hypoglycemia.     It is possible that following the proposed protocol, patients receiving basal glargine and 
metformin  may develop hypoglycemia. For this analysis,  symptomatic hypoglycemia  is defined as an event 
with typi[INVESTIGATOR_15563] (i.e., sweating, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], and feeling of hunger) with or without confirmation by 
[CONTACT_124087] < 54 mg/dl (3.9 mmol/L).  
Insulclock Proposal, 06/01 /2018  
 12 Severe hypoglycemia  is defined as epi[INVESTIGATOR_775877] < 40 mg/dl (2.2 mmol/L) or with prompt recovery after administration of carbohydrates, glucagon, or 
other resuscitative actions.  
Protection against Risks:   
We will follow safeguards to minimize the risk to our subjects: a) we wi ll carefully monitor response to 
medical treatment every [ADDRESS_1065678] and during clinic visits, b) women of reproductive age 
who are sexually active will undergo a urine pregnancy tests prior to participation in the study, c) female 
subject s whom are pregnant, breast -feeding, or not willing to use appropriate contraception at time of 
enrollment will not be included in the study, d) patients with significant comorbidities such as chronic kidney 
disease > stage III, liver cirrhosis, gastropare sis, and pancreatic disorders will be excluded from the study.  
Patients will receive diabetes education prior to discharge and will be instructed on hypoglycemia 
sign/symptoms and treatment.  Patients will be asked to call the diabetes center and/or PCP i n the event of 
hypoglycemia. If a patient develops hypoglycemia, the dose of insulin will be reduced (see treatment 
algorithm).     
Statistical Analysis:  
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_775878] (insulin omission, mistiming and dosing) betwee n 
Insulclock versus conventional insulin injection pen device.  We will also compare differences in glycemic 
control, as measure d by [CONTACT_775886]1c from baseline, number of hypoglycemic events, percentage of 
subjects maintaining therapy, 7 -point SMBG  profile, fasting plasma (FPG) profile, and HRQoL assessments 
(Patient reported outcomes) between groups.  
 
Analysis of Primary Endpoint:  
The primary outcome of treatment adherence  with the use of Insulclock  with feedback or no information 
(blinded) is whether a patient has a good adherent to the treatment regimen (assessed based on insulin 
omission, mistiming, and dosing). Given the 2 by 2 cross -over design, the superiority of the Insulclock system 
over the conventional insulin pen device will be determined by [CONTACT_775891] a 
good treatment adherence with Insulclock but a poor treatment adherence with the conventional device to the 
percent of patients showing a poor treatment adher ence with Insulclock but a good treatment adherence with 
the conventional device. We will perform this comparison based on McNemar’s test assuming the period 
effect is negligible. We will further conduct logistic regression to accommodate potential period effect and 
adjust for other potential confounders. We will apply standard model selection and model checking procedures 
(such as the Hosmer -Lemeshow tests) to decide and evaluate the final model. A p value of <0.05 will be 
considered significant.   
 
Analys is of Secondary Endpoints:  
Secondary endpoints in this study include patient satisfaction ( assessed by [CONTACT_1766]’ responses to questions 1, 
7 and 8 of the DTSQc) , quality of life score, insulin dose, rate of hypoglycemia, number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_775879] . For a continuous secondary outcome ( e.g. quality  of life score), our 
analysis will be focused on determining whether the outcome diffe rence between period after crossover (i.e. 
period 2) versus the period before crossover (i.e. period 1) in the Insulclock group is similar to  that in the 
conventional device group. We will perform the analysis based on paired t -tests. Linear mixed models will be 
conducted to assess the study group difference while accounting for potential confounders. Appropriate 
transformations may be applied to make data better meet normality assumption. Standard model selection and 
checking procedures will be applied to  determine the final linear models. For binary secondary outcomes, we 
will follow the analysis plan proposed for the primary endpoint.  
 
Power Considerations   
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_775880] 40 subjects for each study group. Our power calculat ion is mainly 
based on the binary primary outcome. We assume no more than 15% attrition rate, and assume no period 
Insulclock Proposal, 06/01 /[ADDRESS_1065679] for Binomial proportion wit h alpha=0.05, under different projections for the proportion of subjects 
showing treatment preference (i.e. adherent under one treatment but not under the other), denoted by P tp, and 
projections for the probability of preference to Insulclock given showing  treatment preference, denoted by p.  
 
 
Power  Ptp 
 90% 80% 70% 60% 50% 
p 0.6 31.2%  28.2%  21.5%  17.8%  13.9%  
0.7 87.9%  83.7%  74.9%  66.5%  55.4%  
0.8 >99%  >99%  >99%  97.6%  93.8%  
0.9 >99%  >99%  >99%  >99%  >99%  
Regarding the secondary outcomes, the power calculations can be made conservatively based on superiority 
hypotheses without specifying the equivalent margins. For continuous secondary outcomes, we would have 
over 80% power to detect outcome difference of 0.[ADDRESS_1065680] deviation based on paired t tests, with 
alpha=0.05, assuming equal outcome standard deviations for Insulclock and the conventional device, and 
within subject correlation equal to 0.3.  
Data Handing and Record Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]:  
Data collection records with personal identifiers will be stored in locked file cabinets.  Presentation of the 
study results at regional or scientific meetings or in publications will not identify subjects.  Access to research 
and confidential records will be limited to c linical investigators, research coordinators, and the IRB at Emory 
University.  
Ethics : 
Informed Consent.   
After identification of eligible patients these individuals will be provided basic information regarding the 
study and, if interested, a member of the research staff using inclusion/exclusion criteria delineated elsewhere 
in the protocol will enroll patien ts.  Informed consent will be obtained before any trial related procedures 
including screening procedures . The consent form, potential risks and benefits, and the rights of research 
participants will be explained to the participant by [CONTACT_124100].  Individuals will 
be asked if they have questions, and a member of the research staff will answer questions.  The principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_775881] a participant is enrolled in the study.  The consent form will be completed in 
accordance with the IRB guidelines of Emory University.  A signed copy of the consent form will be provided 
to the participant and a copy will be pla ced in the file that is maintained for each participant in the study 
office.   
Informed consent will follow the procedure of Emory University Institutional Review Board.   Every potential 
participant will be informed in writing and verbally with the import ant and key points of the study.   One of 
the investigators or research coordinators will obtain a witnessed informed consent prior to inclusion of a 
patient into the study.   
The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and w ill be conducted in 
accordance with the ICH GCP guidelines. The sponsor -investigator will comply with all applicable regulatory 
and legal requirements, ICH GCP guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki in obtaining and documenting the

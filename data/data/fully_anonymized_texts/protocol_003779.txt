3.0 BACK GROUND  AND  RATIONA LE 
 
3.1 Bortezomib for Injection 
 
Scientific Background 
Bortezomib for Injection is a  small mol ecule proteasome  inhibitor  developed by [CONTACT_842047], Inc., (Millennium)  as a novel agent to t reat hum an malignancies. 
Bortezomib is currently approved by [CONTACT_842048] D rug Administration (US 
FDA) and it is registered in Eu rope for the treatment of multiple  myeloma  patients who h ave 
received at least one  prior therapy. 
 
By [CONTACT_61670]  a single molecular target, the proteasome, bortezomib affec ts multiple  signaling 
pathways.  The  anti-neoplastic effect of bortezomib lik ely involv es several distin ct 
mechanisms, in cluding  inhibition of  cell growth  and su rvival pathways, induction of 
apoptosis, and inhibition  of expression of  genes that control cellular adhesion, mi gration and 
angiogenesis.  Thus, the  mechanisms by [CONTACT_842049], and the  extent to whi ch each affected pathway is critical to the 
inhibition of  tumor  growth could also di ffer.  Bortezomib h as a novel pattern of cytotoxicity 
in National Cancer Institute  (NCI) in vit ro and in  vivo assays (Adams, Palombella et al. 
1999 ).  In addition, bo rtezomib h as cytotoxic activity in a variety of xenograft tumor  models, 
both as a single agent and in combin ation with chemoth erapy and radiation (Teicher, Ara et al. 
1999; Cusack, Liu et al. 2001; Steiner, Neumeier et al. 2001;  LeBlanc, Catley et al. 2002; 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_8745], Pi[INVESTIGATOR_391136]. 2002 ).  Not ably, bortezomib in duces apoptosis in cells that over express bcl- 
2, a genetic trait that confers unregulated growth and resistance to convention al 
chemoth erapeutics (McConkey, Pettaway et al. 1999 ). 
Amended: 07/25/12  
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Ca ncer Center 
IRB Protocol 
IRB#: 05-103 A(14)  
  
 Bortezomib is thou ght to be  efficacious in multiple  myeloma  via its inhibition of  nuclear 
factor κB (NF-κB) activation, its attenuation of  interleukin-6 (IL-6)-mediated cell growth, a  
direct apoptotic  effect, and possib ly anti-angiogenic and oth er effects (Hideshim a, Richardson  
et al. 2001 ). 
 
Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics 
The clinical pharmacology characterization of  bortezomib h as been determined from ph ase [ADDRESS_1170056] ration of  1.0 m g/m2 and 1.3 m g/m2 dose, the mean first-dose maximum obs erved 
plasma concentrations of  bortezomib w ere 57 and 112 n g/mL, respectively in 11 p atients with 
multiple  myeloma  and creatinine  clearance values >50 mL/min p articipating in a 
pharmacokinetics study.  In sub sequent dos es, mean maximum o bserved plasma 
concentrations ranged from 67 to 106 n g/mL for the 1.0 m g/m2 dose and 89  to 120 n g/mL for 
the 1.3 m g/m2 dose.  The  mean elimin ation h alf-life of bortezomib upon multiple  dosing 
ranged from [ADDRESS_1170057] dos e. 
Mean Tot al Body Clearances were 102 and 112  L/h following  the first do se for doses of 1.0 
mg/m2 and 1.3 m g/m2, respectively, and ranged from 15 to 32  L/h following  subsequent dos es 
for doses of 1.0 and 1.3  mg/m2, respectively.  Clinical experience has shown th at the change 
in clearance does not result in ov ert toxi city from accumul ation in this mul tidose  regimen in 
humans. 
 
In subj ects with advanced malignancies, the  maximum ph armacodynamic effect (inhibition of  
20S activity) occurred within [ADDRESS_1170058] dos e.  At the  therapeutic dose of 1.3 mg/m2 in 
subjects with multiple  myeloma, the mean proteasome inhibition at 1-hour post dose  was 
approximately 61%. 
 
The time course of proteasome  inhibition in subj ects is characterized by [CONTACT_842050], follow ed by [CONTACT_151196] 6 to 24 hou rs to within 50%  of the pretreatment activity.  On the  Day 1, 
4, 8, and 11 s chedule, variable (10%–30%) levels of proteasome  inhibition h ave been 
observed at next scheduled dosin g.  In theory, this advantage allows cells to recover 
proteasome  activity for normal cellular housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_842012] b etween doses. 
The relationship b etween bortezomib pl asma concentrations and proteasome  inhibition can be 
described by a maximum  effect (Emax) model.  The Emax curve is initi ally very steep, with 
small changes in pl asma bortezomib concentration over the range of 0.5 to  2.0 n g/mL relating 
to large increases in the  percent inhibition (0–60%).  After that, a plateau occurs where 
marginal increases of proteasome  inhibition are observed in spi[INVESTIGATOR_842013]. 
 
Clinical Experience 
It is estimated that more than 100,[ADDRESS_1170059] been treated with bo rtezomib, in cluding  
patients treated through Millennium -sponso red clinical trials, Investigator-Initiated Studies,

the US NCI Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), and with comm ercially available 
drug.  Bortezomib h as been comm ercially available since 13 M ay 2003.  
 
The overall goal of the Millennium ph ase 1 program was to d etermine  the MTD and dos e- 
limiting  toxicity (DLT) of bortezomib in a  numb er of therapeutic settings involving  subjects 
with v arious advanced malignancies.  In a Phase I trial in p atients with refractory hematologic 
malignancies, the  MTD for a twice weekly for 4 weeks of a 42 day cycle was 1.04 
mg/m2/dose, with DLTs of thrombo cytopenia, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, fatigue, and 
malaise (Orlowski, Stinchcombe  et al. 2002 ).  The toxicity was greatest during the third and 
fourth weeks of therapy. In the  3-week schedule of bortezomib monoth erapy (4 doses, given 
on D ays 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day treatment cycle), the DLT occurred at 1.56 m g/m2/dose  (3 
subjects with G rade 3 diarrhea and 1 with p eripheral sensory neuropathy).  Therefore, the 
MTD at this s chedule was 1.3 m g/m2/dose.  In a 35-day treatment cycle with 4 w eekly doses 
of bortezomib monoth erapy, the MTD  was 1.6 mg/m2/dose  and DLT included hypotension, 
tachycardia, diarrhea, and syncope. 
 
In phase 1 clinical studi es, anti-tumor  activity was reported in subj ects with  NHL, multiple 
myeloma, Waldenström’s Macroglobulin emia, squamous cell carcinoma  of the nasopharynx, 
bronchoalveolar carcinoma of the lung, renal cell carcinom a, and prostate cancer. 
 
Studies using  bortezomib as monoth erapy and in  combin ation with oth er chemoth erapy agents 
are continui ng. 
 
3.[ADDRESS_1170060], and the  ordered degradation of  these proteins is required for 
the cell to p rogress through the  cell cycle and to undergo mitosis (King, Deshaies et al. 1996 ). 
One of the targets of ubiquitin -proteasome  mediated degradation is the  tumor  suppressor p53, 
which acts as a negative regulator of cell growth.  P53 is required for the transcription of  a 
numb er of genes involv ed in cell cycle control and DNA synthesis and also plays an impo rtant 
function in apoptosis indu ced by [CONTACT_842051] (Sherr 1996 ). 
Cyclins and the  cyclin-dependent kin ase inhibito rs p21 and p27 Kip1 are another set of 
growth regulatory proteins that are regulated by [CONTACT_712200]-dependent proteolysis (King, 
Amended: 07/25/12  
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Ca ncer Center 
IRB Protocol 
IRB#: 05-103 A(14)  
  
Deshaies et al. 1996 ).   Both p21 and p27 can ind uce cell cycle arrest by [CONTACT_842052] 
D-, E- and A-dependent kinases (Sherr 1996). 
 
 In addition, the  ubiquiti n-proteasome  pathway is required for transcription al regulation. 
Nuclear factor-
B (NF-
B) is a key transcription factor, who se activation is regulated by 
[CONTACT_712200]-mediated degradation of  the inhibitor  protein I
B (Palomb ella, Rando et al. 1994;  
Read, Neish et al. 1995 ).  Cell adhesion mol ecules (CAM)  such as E-selectin, ICAM-1, and 
VCAM-1 are regulated by [CONTACT_153542]-
B and are involv ed in tumor  metastasis and angiogenesis in 
vivo (Zetter 1993).  Du ring metastasis, th ese molecules direct the adhesion and extravasation 
of tumor  cells to and from the  vasculature to dist ant tissue  sites.  As su ch, tumor  cell 
metastasis will be limited by [CONTACT_842053]-regulation of  NF-
B dependent cell adhesion 
molecule expression.  N F-
B is also required in a  numb er of cell types to maintain cell 
viability as an anti-apoptotic  controlling  factor (Beg and Baltimo re 1996 ). Inhibiting N F-
B 
activation by [CONTACT_842054] I
B protein makes cells mo re sensitive  to environmental stress 
and cytotoxic agents, ultim ately leading to apoptosis.  
 
Altered degradation of  cell cycle control proteins can result in accelerated and un controlled 
cell division, and thereby [CONTACT_842055].  Interfering with the  temporal 
degradation of  these regulatory molecules by [CONTACT_842056], th ereby [CONTACT_842057].  In addition, inhibition of  proteasome-mediated degradation of  I
B 
will inhibit N F-
B activation and should m ake tumor  cells mo re sensitive  to 
chemoth erapeutic agents th at activate NF-
B. 
 
Collectively, these observations sug gest that inhibito rs of the proteasome  can act through 
multiple  mechanisms to  arrest tumor  growth, tumor  spread and angiogenesis.  The 
combin ation of  these mechanisms o ffers a novel approach to t reating human malignancies. 
Consist ent with this hypothesis, tumor  cells th at bear multiple  genetic defects, including 
impaired DNA repair mechanisms and aberrant cell cycle checkpoint controls, are sensitive  to 
the growth inhibito ry actions of  proteasome  inhibito rs both in vitro and in vivo. 
 
Bortezomib is a  dipeptidyl boronic acid inhibitor  with hi gh specificity for the proteasome, 
which is b eing developed by [CONTACT_20555],  Inc. to treat hum an malignancies.  It is the  first 
member of this n ew class of anti-tumor  agents to come to hum an trials.  Phase I clinical 
studies have demonst rated that bortezomib is a  well-tolerated agent with minim al adverse 
effects.  In addition, it h as been shown th at bortezomib is capable of producing a  dose related 
effect on p roteasome inhibition wh en analyzed one-hour post in fusion.  T here is little inter- 
patient variability, with respons es at the lowest doses studi ed to d ate (Papandreou, D aliani et 
al. 2001; A ghajanian, Soignet et al. 2002 ). 
 
3.3 Study Dis ease and Rationale 
 
Non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas (NHL) are presently the fifth most common cause of cancer 
related death in the  [LOCATION_002].  Collectively, they account for approximately 4 to 5%  of all 
cancer-related deaths in Caucasian and Hispanic popul ations, and about 2%  in African-

IRB#: 05-103 A(14)  
  
American popul ations (Cunnin gham, Zalcberg et al. 1996 ).  How ever, because NHL tends to 
afflict a younger popul ation (the average age of all lymphoma  patients is about 42  years), the 
years of life lost is greater than in most oth er malignancies.  This ranks NHL fourth among all 
cancers with regard to their economic  impact in the  [LOCATION_002].  In 1997,  there were 
approximately 53,600 n ew cases of NHL, with o ver 23,800 d eaths attributed to the  disease 
(Cunnin gham, Zalcberg et al. 1996 ).  Thus, the  case-fatality rate for non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma  (ie. the number of deaths attributed to the disease expressed as a percentage of the 
incidence of the disease) is approximately 44%.  As with most h ematologic malignancies, 
there is a slight male predomin ance, with about 57% of all cases developi[INVESTIGATOR_842014]. 
 
The indol ent non -Hodgkin’s lymphom as comprise approximately one-third of all NHLs. 
Indolent lymphop roliferative disorders (including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), small 
lympho cytic lymphoma  (SLL), the follicular lymphomas (FL), marginal zone lymphom as 
(MZL), and lymphopl asmacytoid lymphoma  (ie. Waldenstrom M acroglobulinemia (WM)), 
represent a class of diseases that are characterized by [CONTACT_148597], p rogressive  tumor growth th at 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_842015].  While compl ete and partial remissions can be 
obtained in most p atients, ov er time, the disease becomes increasingly more refractory to 
chemoth erapy, prompting  the need for addition al, non-cross-resistant treatment approaches. 
 
A review of 204 p atients treated over a 19 year time span has helped to characterize the 
natural histo ry of indol ent lympho mas (Johnson, Rohatiner et al. 1995 ).  With a median 
follow -up du ration of  12.[ADDRESS_1170061] rates the relapsing/recurring nature of the disease, with response  rates and 
duration of  response decreasing with subs equent relapses (see table below).  Sixty five percent 
of patients in this stu dy relapsed after initial treatment, with a  total of 37 patients ultim ately 
receiving a total of four or more courses of therapy.

First [ADDRESS_1170062] treatment, 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 
54%, whereas 5-year DFS was about h alf of that (28%) for patients achieving only a PR. 
Similarly, median duration of  response  was [ADDRESS_1170063] of the phase I clinical trial of bortezomib in p atients 
with h ematologic and solid tumor  malignancies (Aghajanian, Soignet et al. 2002 ).  This 
and another phase I study (Orlowski, Stinchcombe  et al. 2002)  demonst rated not on ly 
tolerability of the agent, with impo rtant ph armacologic endpoints, but also revealed 
significant activity in patients with multiple  myeloma, mantle cell lymphoma, and 
follicular lymphom a.  These observations sp awned a single-agent phase II study with 
bortezomib in p atients w ith indol ent lymphop roliferative disorders at MSKCC (protocol 
01-049).  Based on the  promising  activity of bortezomib in ind olent lymphoma, we 
expanded this t rial to a  large, multi center study.  The current protocol seeks to exploit the 
marked single-agent activity of bortezomib in non -Hodgkin’s lymphoma  by [CONTACT_842058] a  standard convention al regimen for the treatment of these diseases. 
 
The phase II study of single-agent bo rtezomib (IRB # 01-049) in patients with p redomin antly 
relapsed or refractory indol ent non -Hodgkin’s lymphoma  (NHL) condu cted by [CONTACT_27156] h as

Bortezomib w as administ ered at a dose of 1.5 mg/m2 on a day 1, 4, 8 and 11 schedule every 21 
days.  The patients w ere heavily pre-treated with a  median of 3 prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (2 prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_842016]).  Ov erall the  drug was very well tolerated, with most p atients experiencing

neuropathy, diarrhea, and asthenia.  Amo ng 18 assessable patients with FL, the overall response 
rate (ORR) was 50%, including  5 partial respons es (PR) and [ADDRESS_1170064] ete remission (CR)/compl ete response  unconfirmed (CRu).  Of 8 assessable patients with 
marginal zone lymphoma  (MZL), 3 achieved a PR, while  only 1 of the 6 patients with SLL 
show ed any response  to therapy (PR) (O’Connor  et al., Clinical Cancer Research 2009, in  
press).  Amo ng 36 assessable patients with M CL, the ORR was 50%, including 12PR and 6 
CR/Cru (O'Conno r, Moskowitz  et al. 2009 ).  Ov erall, the  median progression free survival 
(PFS) for responding p atients with M CL and all other non-MCL patients has been 7.[ADDRESS_1170065] rating a median time  to 
response  (TTR) of 5 and 11 w eeks, respectively.  This p articular difference has potentially 
significant ramifications  regarding how m uch therapy to give before one can adequately assess 
drug activity in follicular lymphom a. 
 
Goy et al. at M.D. And erson Cancer Center began a broader single-agent, sin gle-institution 
study of bortezomib in patients with any B-cell neoplasm, regardless of their prior numb er of 
treatments (Goy, You nes et al. 2005 ).  Oth erwise, this and the  MSKCC studies were similar in 
design.  Of 60 registered patients, 33 h ad mantle cell lymphom a, 12 h ad diffuse large B-cell 
lymphom a, and the  remainder had a variety of other subtypes, including  small lympho cytic 
lymphom a, follicular lymphom a, Waldenstrom’s Macroglobulin emia, and a transformed 
lymphom a.  Ov erall, this popul ation of  patients w as more heavily pretreated, with a  median 
numb er of prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_1309] 3 in the MCL group and 4 in the  other NHL patients.  The 
overwhelming majority of patients h ad markedly elevated LDH and Beta-2-microglobulin 
prior to stu dy enrollment. Of 29 assessable patients with m antle cell lymphoma, 12 (41%) 
achieved a major response, with 6 (20.5%) of them attaining  a compl ete remission, and 6 
(20.5%) attaining a partial remission.  Ov erall, the  duration of  response was approximately [ADDRESS_1170066] treated patients with 
bortezomib at a dose of 1.3 mg/m2, using  the twice weekly dosing schedule outlin ed above. 
The National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC) reported on a  study in patients with, both 
treated and un treated, mantle cell lymphoma  (Belch, Kou roukis et al. 2004 ).  A tot al of 30 
patients w ere accrued, of whom 28 w ere assessable for response  at the time of reporting.  The 
numb er of prior treatments was limit ed to 2.  Interestingly, there was no di fference in ORR 
between chemonaïve and chemoth erapy refractory patients.  Among  the 13 patients who h ad 
no prior therapy, 6 achieved a PR (ORR 46.2%), while  among  the 15 previously treated 
patients, 6 achieved PR and 1 achieved a CRu (ORR 46.7%).  Most adverse events w ere grade 
[ADDRESS_1170067] that many of these patients 
had pre-existing  effusions.  Interestingly, this to xicity was not s een in oth er trials.  Straus et

al. have enrolled 45 patients with N HL (21 M CL, 12 FL, 5 Waldenstrom’s macroglobulin emia 
(WM), 4 Ho dgkin’s disease and 3 oth er) (Strauss, M aharaj et al. 2004 ). Respons es were seen 
in 7 of 18 M CL patients (1 CR/CRu, 6 PR), 2 of  11 FL patients (both PR with l ate respons es, 3 
months after initiation of  treatment), and 2 of  5 WM patients (both PR). No respons es were 
seen in patients with aggressive lymphom as.  Again, the  most common to xicities were grade 3-
4 thrombo cytopenia, fatigue, and peripheral neuropathy (along with  
the addition al toxicity of grade 3-4 anemia). 
 
The consist ent results in M CL prompt ed the  PI[INVESTIGATOR_724206] - a multi center phase II 
registration stu dy of single agent bo rtezomib in M CL.  The  centrally reviewed response rate in 
this t rial was 32%  (8% CR/CRu), with a  median time to progression (TTP) and du ration of 
response  (DOR) of 6.7 and 9.2 months, respectively (Goy, Bernstein et al. 2009 ). 
 
Collectively, these data demonst rate that bortezomib h as meaningful activity  in select sub- 
types of lymphom a, and perhaps mo re impo rtantly, that the duration of  response  can be 
clinically significant.  T he future challenge, of course, is trying to figure out how b est to 
integrate this p romising n ew class of molecules into the  present standards of  care for 
lymphom a. 
 
Rationale for R-CBorP 
 
Preclinical data in a SCID-beige lymphoma  xenograft mod el suggest that the efficacy of 
bortezomib with cytotoxic therapy is schedule dependent. D ata from our  laboratory (O'Connor  
2003)  have revealed that bortezomib and cyclophosphamide  are at least additive in their ability 
to delay and reverse xenograft tumor  growth.  The  optim al therapeutic effects are seen wh en 
bortezomib is given following  cytotoxic therapy. Simult aneous administ ration is in ferior to 
sequential administ ration. 
 
The addition of  rituximab to bo rtezomib in a  SCID xenograft mod el of lymphoma  also shows 
at least an additive  benefit (De Vos, M cBride et al. 2004)  (figure below). In other experiments 
(data not shown ), bortezomib h as shown cooperative activity with st eroids, as well.  Th ese 
data suppo rt the hypothesis th at integrating bortezomib in a  schedule-dependent manner into 
certain standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_842017], if not synergistic, in the  treatment of 
non-Hodgkin’s lympho ma.

The impo rtance of vincristine, a cell-cycle dependent antimitotic  agent, in the treatment of 
slow ly growing lymphomas is qu estion able.  Single-agent efficacy of vincristine  in indol ent 
lymphom as has not b een shown in the  modern literature.  Furthermore, vincristine  and 
bortezomib both in cur the potential for neurotoxic adverse effects.  Replacing vincristine  with 
bortezomib, a  known active agent in indol ent lymphomas, in combin ation with 
cyclophosph amide, rituximab and prednisone  therefore offers the potential for greater activity 
in patients with relapsed/refractory indol ent NHL, and exploits the  cooperative interactions of 
bortezomib with cyclophosphamide, rituximab and st eroids.  
 
3.5 Phase I Results 
 
To determine  the (MTD) of bortezomib in combin ation with R-CP, we employed a modi fied 
Fibonacci dose  escalation schema. We initially sought to explore a weekly dosing  schedule of 
bortezomib, b ased on p romising  results from a  phase II trial of bortezomib combin ed with 
rituximab comparing weekly with twi ce-weekly administ ration (Saleh, Dakhil et al. 2005 ). 
During this po rtion of  the trial, the  starting doses of bortezomib and cyclophosph amide  were 
1.3 m g/m2 and 750m g/m2, respectively.  On the  second cohort (bortezomib 1.6m g/m2 and 
cyclophosph amide  750mg/m2), one  patient experienced a grade 3 diarrhea.  There were no 
further DLTs and the  maximum pre-planned dos es of bortezomib (1.8m g/m2) and 
cyclophosph amide  (1000mg/m2) were therefore consid ered to be  the MTD  and M aximum 
Administ ered Dose  (MAD).  How ever, as we neared the  compl etion of  dose escalation using 
weekly administ ration, new reports from the  bortezomib +  rituximab trial cast doubt about 
whether weekly dosing is the  most pot ent mode  of administ ration.  We therefore amended the 
Phase I trial to allow for dose escalation with a  twice-weekly schedule of bortezomib 
administ ration in our  combin ation regimen.  A minimum of  three patients w ere follow ed for at 
least one compl ete cycle (ie. 3 w eeks) of therapy before the trial entered patients at the next

dose level. Three patients were initially entered in the  twice-weekly schedule at a dose of 1.0 
mg/m2 bortezomib and 750 m g/m2 of cyclophos phamide  (with a constant dose of rituximab, 
375 m g/m2 and prednisone, 100 m g/day). Cyclophosph amide  dose was increased to 1000 
mg/m2, and bo rtezomib w as increased to 1.3 mg/m2 and 1.5 m g/m2.  As reported at the 2008  
Annu al Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (Gerecitano, Portlock et al. 
2008 ), the second cohort (1.3 m g/m2 bortezomib,  750 m g/m2 cyclophosp hamide) required one 
expansion due  to neutropenic fevers.   When a second n eutropenic fever was seen, the  
protocol was amended to include filgrastim suppo rt, and six  addition al patients w ere added at 
this dose  level to assess safety.  One  of these patients experienced two DLTs (a grade 4 
thrombo cytopenia and a grade 4 neuropathy) and the cohort was again expanded, with no 
further DLTs.  Doses were further escalated to the  highest pre-planned dose levels (1.5 mg/m2 
bortezomib, 1000 m g/m2 cyclophosph amide) without further DLTs. Altho ugh this hi ghest 
dose level is the  MTD as defined by [CONTACT_409849], we  have decided to b ring the  penultim ate 
dose level (1.3 mg/m2 bortezomib, 1000 m g/m2 cyclophosph amide) forward into the  phase II 
portion of  the study.  Th is decision w as made after consid erations regarding our phase II 
experience with si ngle-agent bo rtezomib and dis cussions with the  attendings on the  
lymphoma  service at MSKCC and Columbia  Univ ersity.  In order to allow for maximum 
dosing  flexibility and patient convenience, we investigated the safety and efficacy of using 
pegylated G-CSF (Neulasta) during bortezomib administ ration in an expanded cohort at the 
MTD of  the phase I study. A separate cohort of 10 patients w as added at the twice-weekly 
bortezomib (Bor) 1.3 mg/m2 + cyclophosph amide  (C) 1000 m g/m2 level to assess the  safety of 
administ ering overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_842018] (PegG) instead of filgrastim (G). In this cohort, PegG 
was given with bo rtezomib on d ay 2.  To  evaluate the safety of pegfilgrastim ov erlappi[INVESTIGATOR_18499]

3.[ADDRESS_1170069] ration of  bortezomib in a 
group of patients with multiple  myeloma  (MM).  At the  2010 annual meeting of the American 
Society of Hematology (ASH), this group p resented data from a  phase III randomi zed 
controlled trial comparing intravenous and sub cutaneous routes of administ ration of 
bortezomib with or  without dexamethasone in patients with MM (Moreau, Pylypenko et al. 
2010 ).  As expected, pharmacokinetic parameters were different in the  two arms, with p eak 
serum levels greater in the 74 patients in the  IV arm (223 n g/ml) compared with the  148 
patients in the  SC arm (20.4 n g/ml).  Interestingly, the area under the curve for both routes of 
administ ration w as identical.  Du ring this t rial, it w as found th at several toxicities, mo st 
impressively sensory peripheral neuropathy, was markedly and significantly lower in patients 
given bortezomib sub cutaneously: grade 3-4 toxicity rate was 70%  for the IV arm and 57% 
for the SC arm; any grade peripheral neuropathy was seen in 53%  of IV patients and 38%  of 
SC patients, p =  0.04).  Efficacy of the SC route was indistin guishable from that of the IV

route of administ ration, with an overall response  rate of 52% in both arms.  Based on this 
randomi zed trial, the  SC mode  of administ ration appears to in crease the safety profile of 
bortezomib while  maintaining  identical efficacy.  We have therefore chosen to in corporate 
this mode  of delivery into the  current protocol. 
 
3.[ADDRESS_1170070] ration for 
bortezomib.  
 
The weekly dose schedule (Arm A) chosen for phase II was the MTD  (see sections 3.5 and 
4.1.1 ). The  decision for the phase II dose in the  twice-weekly arm (Arm B) was based on 
several factors:  The phase I dose escalation of  this schedule proceeded to the  highest pre- 
planned level with filgrastim suppo rt without any DLTs. How ever, our phase II experience 
with sin gle-agent bo rtezomib at this dose  and schedule show ed clinically important adverse 
effects, especially with respect to n europathy.  Although this hi ghest dose  level is the  MTD as 
defined by [CONTACT_409849], the  phase I investigators decided to b ring the penultimate dose level 
(1.3 m g/m2 bortezomib,  1000 m g/m2 cyclophosp hamide) forward into the  phase II portion of 
the study. 
 
Because of the need for a randomi zed phase II design to assess the  optim al dosing  schedule, 
twice the numb er of patients is required (for two randomi zed arms). 
 
Interim Safety Analysis  
 
Althou gh the  SC route of administ ration s eems to in crease the safety of bortezomib 
administ ration, it h as not been explored in combin ation with oth er agents.  For this reason, an 
interim safety analysis is  planned after the enrollment of [ADDRESS_1170071] 6 p atients enrolled to each arm experiences a dose limiting  toxicity (DLT, as

Bortezomib for Injection is a  sterile lyophili zed powd er for reconstitution and is suppli ed in 
vials containing  bortezomib and m annitol at a 1:10 ratio.  For example, vials containing  3.5 
mg of bortezomib contain 35 mg  of mannitol.

5.1.2  How  Supplied and Preparation: Drug is availa ble in sterile, single-use vials 
containing 3.[ADDRESS_1170081] ration, each vial of 
bortezomib for Injection should be  reconstitut ed under a laminar flow biolo gical 
cabinet (hood ), within 8 hou rs before dosin g, with 1.4 mL of normal (0.9%) 
saline, sodium chloride injection, so that the reconstitut ed solution contains 
bortezomib at a concentration of  2.5 m g/mL. The  reconstitut ed solution is clear 
and colorless, with a  final pH of  approximately [ADDRESS_1170082] ered 
prompt ly and in no case more than 8 hou rs after reconstitution.  
 
Dosage  and Administration 
 
Bortezomib m ay be administered intravenous ly (IV) at a concentration of  1 
mg/mL, or subcutaneously  at a concentration of  2.5 mg/ml.  When adminis tered 
intravenous ly, bortezomib is administ ered as a [ADDRESS_1170083] ered. 
 
Administration Precautions 
 
The drug quantity contained in one  vial (3.5 mg) may exceed the  usual dose 
required.  Caution should  be used in calculating the dose to prevent ov erdose. 
 
When administ ered sub cutaneously, sites for each injection (thigh or abdomen) 
should be  rotated.  N ew inj ections should be  given at least one  inch from an old 
site and never into areas where the site is tender, bruised, erythematous, or 
indurated. 
 
If local injection site  reactions o ccur following  bortezomib administ ration 
subcutaneously, a less concentrated bortezomib solution (1 mg/mL instead of 2.5 
mg/mL) may be administ ered sub cutaneously.  Alt ernatively, the IV route of 
administ ration should be  consid ered. 
 
Bortezomib is an antineoplastic.  Procedures for proper handling and disposal 
should be  consid ered.

5.1.3  Bortezomib is cytotoxic: As with all cytotoxic drugs, caution is required when 
preparing and handling bortezomib solutions.  Cytotoxic drugs should on ly be 
handled by [CONTACT_842061]. The 
use of gloves and oth er appropriate protective clothing is recomm ended.  In case 
of skin contact, wash the  affected area immediately and th oroughly with so ap and 
water for at least [ADDRESS_1170084] be  kept of all 
dispos ed materials. 
 
5.1.4  Storage and Stability: Vials containing  lyophili zed bortezomib for Injection 
should be  stored according to the  label requirements.  For the [LOCATION_002], sto re 
at USP Controlled Room Temperature which is 2 5ºC (77ºF); excursions p ermitted 
from 15 to 30ºC  (59 to 86º F).  To d ate, stability data indicate that the lyophilized 
drug product is st able for at least [ADDRESS_1170085] ered only to 
eligible patients und er the supervision of  the investigator or identified sub - 
investigator(s).  Patients m ay be treated on an out -patient basis, if  possibl e. 
The pharmacist will p repare the drug under aseptic conditions.  The  amount (in 
mg) of drug to be  admin istered will be  determined based on bo dy surface area. 
Body surface area is to be  calculated based on b ody weight usi ng a standard 
nomo gram (See Appendix C).  The  dose should be  calculated on D ay 1 of each 
cycle; the dose administ ered should remain the  same throughout each cycle but 
should be  recalculated at the start of the next cycle.  If a patient experiences a 
notable change in weight within a  cycle, as determined by [CONTACT_842062], th en the  patient’s dose  should be  recalculated at that time  based on 
clinical judgment. The appropriate amount of  bortezomib will be  drawn from the 
injection vi al and administ ered as a subcutaneous injection.  Vi als are for single 
use administ ration. 
 
Patients randomi zed to t he weekly dosing schedule (Arm A) will receive 
bortezomib as a subcutaneous inj ection on d ays [ADDRESS_1170086] period.  Patients randomized to the  twice-weekly dosing schedule (Arm B) 
will receive bortezomib as a subcutaneous inj ection on d ays 2, 5, 9, 12,  follow ed 
by a one week rest period.

Precautions and Restrictions 
 
It is not known wh at effects bortezomib h as on hum an pregnancy or development of 
the embryo or fetus.  Th erefore, female patients participating in this stu dy should 
avoid b ecoming pregnant, and m ale patients shou ld avoid imp regnating a  female 
partner.  Nons terilized female patients of  reproductive age and m ale patients should 
use effective methods of  contraception th rough defined periods du ring and after 
study treatment as specified below. 
 
Female patients must m eet 1 of  the followi ng: 
• Postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening visit, or  
 
• Surgically sterile, or 
 
• If they are of childb earing potential, agree to practice [ADDRESS_1170091] 1 of  these 2 methods be  highly effective (see 
  examples below).   
Highly effective methods Other effective methods (barrier methods) 
Intra-uterine devices (IUD) Latex condom 
Hormonal contraceptives (birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]/oral 
contraceptives, injectable contraceptives, 
contraceptive patches, or contraceptive implants) Diaphragm with spermicide 
Cervical cap 
Sponge 
If one of the highly effective methods cannot be used, using 2 effective methods at the same time is 
recommended. 
 
Male patients, even if surgically sterilized (ie, status post v asectomy) must agree to 1 of 
the followin g: 
• Practice effective barrier contraception du ring the entire study treatment period and 
through a minimum of  [ADDRESS_1170092] etely abstain

5.2.2  Formulation: Rituximab is suppli ed as 100 mg  and 500 mg  sterile, preservative- 
free, single use vials. 
 
5.2.3  Preparation: The  appropriate dose is withd rawn and dilut ed to a  final 
concentration of  1-4 mg/ml in either 0.9%  sodium chloride or 5% dextrose 
solution. The  solution is then stable at 2o to 8oC for 24 hou rs and at room 
temperature for an addition al 12 hou rs. 
 
5.2.4  Storage: Vials can be stored at 2o to 8oC. They should be  protected from sunlight. 
 
5.2.5  Administration: The first infusion should be  administ ered at an initi al rate of 50 
mg/hr. If hypersensitivi ty or infusion -related events do not o ccur, the rate may be 
increased by 50 m g/hr every 30 minut es up to a  maximum of  400 m g/hr. 
Subsequent infusions m ay be started at 100 mg/hr and the  rate increased by 100 
mg/hr every 30 minut es to a  maximum of  400 m g/hr, as tolerated. Patients will be 
premedicated with acetaminoph en 650 -mg orally and diph enhydramine  50 mg IV 
30 minut es prior to beginning the rituximab infusion. For severe reactions, the 
infusion will be  stopp ed and can be resumed at 50% of the prior rate once the 
reactions are treated and symptoms resolved. If infusion int erruption is required, 
the administ ration of  steroids (the equivalent of 50-100 mg  hydrocortison e) prior 
to restarting the infusion is allowed at the investigator’s discretion.

Mechanism of action: Decreases inflammation by [CONTACT_842067][INVESTIGATOR_22425]; 
suppresses the immune  system by [CONTACT_842068]; supp resses adrenal function at high doses. Antitumor  effec ts may be 
related to inhibition of  glucose transport, phosph orylation, or  induction of  cell 
death in imm ature lymphocytes. Anti emetic effects are thought to o ccur due to 
blockade of cerebral innervation of  the emetic center via inhibition of 
prostaglandin synthesis.

A:  Patients will be seen on or within 7 days prior to day 1 of each cycle, more frequently at treating MD’s discretion. 
B:  With the exception of screening, CBCs should be perf ormed within a 24 hour window prior to treatment.  Day 2 CBCs of each cycle are optional. A CBC should be perf ormed and resulted 
within 24 hours of all Bortezomib treatments. 
C:  Serum pregnancy test (women of childbearing potential only). 
D:  Continued treatment f ollows the same pattern of f ollow-up examination as cycles 3 and 4. Treatment continues for up to 6 or 8 cycles in total, depending on response.  Please see the 
duration of therapy section in protocol for details (Section 4.3). 
E:  Radiologic evaluation and f ollow up visits will continue after treatment, starting [ADDRESS_1170115] two years, and every 12 months 
thereafter (or more frequently at discretion of treating MD) until the patient begins another treatment regimen. 
F:  Radiologic studies at the end of cycle [ADDRESS_1170116]: CA , PET scan, and, if the patient had a history of disease in neck, a CT: Neck.  CT measurements should be perf ormed during the 
3rd week of cycle 4. 
G:  Baseline, restaging, and post-treatment radiologic studies will include a CT: CAP, PET scan, and CT: Neck (only if history of disease in neck). All patients on study will have PET and CT 
scans perf ormed during the Cycle 4 radiologic evaluation. Thereafter, once a patient enters complete remission (CR), then only CT’s (chest/abdomen/pelvis and neck, if necessary) should be 
obtained. End-of treatment restaging radiologic studies should be performed 3-[ADDRESS_1170117] also be provided for patients 
removed f rom study for progressive disease. 
H: Tumor measurements should be documented after each radiologic assessment that occurs while the patient is on the study (including unscheduled scans ordered at the discretion of the 
treating physician, scans that require patient to go off  study, and any scan ordered per protocol.) 
I:   Bone marrow biopsy and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_842024] (f inal visit)  in all patients who achieve a radiologic CR and in whom bone marrow involvement 
was documented in the pre-study evaluation.  If there is radiologic evidence of a CR at interim restaging in patients with documented bone marrow involvement at baseline, a bone marrow

J:   Serum Protein Electrophoresis should be perf ormed at baseline, at restaging, and repeated at end of treatment, if baseline value was abnormal or the patient has Waldenström’s 
Macroglo bulinemia. 
K:  Baseline laboratory evaluations and physical examination are to be conducted within [ADDRESS_1170118] be done within 4 m onths prior to enrollment. 
L. With the exception of screening, serum chemistries should be perf ormed within 7 days prior to treatment. Serum Chemistry includes: Albumin, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, 
bicarbonate, BUN, calcium, chloride, creatinine, glucose, potassium, total protein, SGOT[AST], SGPT[ALT], sodium, serum cryoglobulins (quantitative), magnesium, phosphorus, uric 
acid. Serum chemistries do not need to be resulted prior to treatment on Day 1. 
M. Patients with Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia must have these labs perf ormed at screening, restaging and at [ADDRESS_1170119] negative values in CR is achieved.  These tests 
are    strongly encouraged for all patients but only required for Waldenström’s Macroglo bulinemia patients. 
N. Final visit evaluation will take place 30 days +/- one week after the last dose of bortezomib. While every attempt will be made to collect this final visit data, it is understood that medical 
and/or logistical reasons may arise that could potentially interfere with the ability of the patient to attend the final visit. If any patient is unable to comply wih the final visit, the reason(s) for 
this will be documented in the medical records and this would not be considered a protocol violation.

12.0 DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODI FICATIONS  
 
Before each drug dose, the patient will be  evaluated for possible  toxicities that may have 
occurred after the previous dos e(s).  Toxicities are to be  assessed according to the  NCI Common 
Terminolo gy Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0.  
Neuropathic pain and peripheral sensory neuropathy are to be  managed as described in T able

and ANC  must be  ≥ 100/ µl. 
 
Dose  escalation will not be  allowed in any patient, and th ere must be  at least 72 hou rs between 
each dose  of Bortezomib. Skipped dos es of bortezomib will not be  made up. 
 
12.1 Previously established or new toxicities observed at any time, with the exception of 
neuropathic pain and peripheral sensory neuropathy, are to be managed as follows: 
 
12.1.1  Patients who d evelop a  febrile neutropenia or Grade 4 hematologic toxicity can be 
treated with a  repeat cycle after holding  the dose for up to two w eeks and 
allowing  blood count recovery to either the pre-treatment criteria (dose 1 of any 
cycle – see section 6.1.7 ), or 25,000/m cl for platelets and 100/m cl for absolute 
neutrophil count (on days when bortezomib is given alone within each cycle). 
Cytokine suppo rt can be given as outlin ed in “Suppo rtive Care,” section 4 .2. 
Should the  patient develop a  second Grade 4 neutropenia or neutropenic fever, 
then the  dose of cyclophosphamide  should be  reduced to 750 m g/m2. 
 
12.1.[ADDRESS_1170123] be  discontinued. 
 
12.1.3  Dose  interruption or  study discontinu ation is not required for lymphop enia of any 
grade. 
 
12.1.4  Should the  patient develop a  second Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, then after 
resolution as above, the dose of bortezomib should  be reduced by [CONTACT_30560] 
(see table below und er section 12.2 ).  A s econd d ose reduction will be  allowed if 
grade 4 thrombo cytopenia persists.  
 
12.1.5  Drug should be  held in patients who d evelop any treatment-related Grade 3-4 
non-hematologic toxicity (except Grade 3 alopecia, injection site  reaction, fatigue, 
or grade 3-4 lab values related to und erlying baseline conditions ),  grade 1 
neuropathy with p ain or any toxicity that is deemed intol erable by [CONTACT_842070].  Such patients can be re-treated 
with a  reduced dose  of bortezomib and/or  cyclophosph amide  as outlin ed above. 
Should the  Grade 3-4 toxicity recur after dose reduction, th at patient will be 
removed from stu dy.  If a grade 3-4 toxicity is based solely on laboratory 
abnormalities that are thought to be  clinically insignificant by [CONTACT_30780], the  lab values should be  discussed with the  principle investigator to 
decide if dose interruption or reduction is n ecessary.

The neurotoxicity-directed questionn aire (see Appendix F) is a useful tool for determining the 
presence and int ensity of neuropathic pain and/or  peripheral neuropathy from the  patient’s 
perspective.  Neuropathic symptoms are more prominent than abnormalities on the  clinical 
examination.  A fter the patient compl etes the neurotoxicity-directed questionnaire, the 
questionn aire should be  reviewed to assist with the  evaluation of  the onset and int ensity of 
peripheral neuropathy and oth er neurotoxicities that may possib ly require intervention or  dose 
modi fication. 
 
13.0 CRITERIA FOR THERAPEUTIC R ESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESSMENT 
13.1 Definitions 
Response  and progression of  disease will be  evaluated in this stu dy using  the international 
criteria proposed by [CONTACT_842071]. (Cheson, Pfistner et al. 2007)  for patients with 
lymphom a, and the  Forth International Workshop  on Waldenstrom’s Macroglobulin emia 
(Dimop aulos et al, 2009)  for patients with Waldenstrom’s Macroglobulin emia..  Not e: 
Lesions are either measurable or non-measurable using  the criteria provided below. The 
term “evaluable” in reference to measurability will not be  used because it does not p rovide 
addition al meaning or accuracy. 
 
13.1.[ADDRESS_1170126] 
one dimension (longest diameter to be  recorded) as >20 mm with convention al 
techniqu es (PET, CT) or as >[ADDRESS_1170127] be  recorded in millim eters (or decimal fractions of 
centimeters). 
 
13.1.2  No n-measurable disease 
All oth er lesions (or sites of disease), including  small lesions (longest diameter 
<20 mm with convention al techniqu es or <[ADDRESS_1170128] scan), are 
consid ered non-measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptom eningeal disease, 
ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, in flammatory 
breast dis ease, abdomin al masses (not follow ed by [CONTACT_462]), and cystic lesions 
are all non -measurable. 
 
13.1.3  Target Lesions 
All m easurable lesions up to a maximum of  six lesions representative of all 
involv ed organs should be  identified as target lesions and recorded and m easured 
at baseline.  Target lesions should be  selected on the basis of  their size 
(determining the product obtained from the  longest diameter of two p erpendicular 
measurements) and th eir suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by 
[CONTACT_14217]).

IRB Protocol 
IRB#: 05-103 A(14) 
Amended: 07/25/12   
  
13.1.4  No n-target lesions 
All oth er lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions and 
should also be  recorded at baseline.  Non -target lesions in clude measurable 
lesions th at exceed the  maximum numb ers per organ or total of all involv ed 
organs as well as non -measurable lesions.  M easurements of  these lesions are not 
required, but the  presence or absence of each should be  noted throughout follow - 
up. 
 
13.2 Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
All m easurements should  be taken and recorded in metric notation using  a ruler or calipers. 
All b aseline evaluations (CT, PET, sup erficial clinical lesion m easurements) should be 
performed as closely as possible  to the  beginning of treatment and never more than [ADDRESS_1170129]:CAP and PET should be  performed at baseline, 
restaging, and at end of  treatment.  Post treatment follow -up will be  performed with CT 
scans.  A CT:Neck shou ld be performed along with each scheduled CT:CAP if the patient 
has a history of disease in the  neck. Tumor  lesions that are situated in a  previous ly irradiated 
area are consid ered measurable. 
 
The same method of  assessment and the  same technique  should be  used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and du ring follow - up.  Imaging-based evaluation 
is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_842072] m ethods h ave been used to 
assess the  antitumor  effect of a treatment. 
 
13.2.1  Cli nical lesions.  Clinical lesions will on ly be considered measurable when they 
are superficial (e.g., skin  nodul es and palpable lymph nod es).  In the  case of skin 
lesions, do cumentation by  [CONTACT_157772], including  a ruler to estimate the 
size of the lesion, is recommended. 
 
13.2.[ADDRESS_1170130], abdom en, and pelvis.  H ead and neck tumo rs and those  of extremities 
usually require specific protocols. 
 
13.2.4  Ul trasound (US).  When the  primary endpoint of  the study is obj ective response 
evaluation, US  should not be used to m easure tumor lesions.  It is, ho wever, a 
possible  alternative to clinical measurements of  superficial palpable lymph nodes, 
subcutaneous l esions, and thyroid nodul es.  US  might also be  useful to confirm 
the compl ete disappearance of superficial lesions usually assessed by [CONTACT_15077].

grade lymphom as, quantification and monito ring of any pre-existing  mono clonal 
gammop athy (via serum protein electrophoresis) and Beta-2-microglobulin  will 
be follow ed if there is an abnormal baseline value. 
 
13.2.7  Cy tology, His tology.  These techniqu es can be used to di fferentiate between 
partial respons es (PR) and compl ete respons es (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual 
lesions wh ere known  residual benign tumo rs can remain).

the treatment) and progressive  disease. 
 
13.3 Response Criteria 
 
13.3.1  R esponse Criteria for patients with NHL  
Response  criteria are determined through evaluation of  target lesions.  Response  criteria 
for patients with N HL will follow the  guidelines previous ly reported by [CONTACT_248286]., 
2007 (Cheson, Pfistner et al. 2007)  and are described below.  The  criteria for NHL are as 
follows (GTD =  Greatest Transverse Diameter; SPD = Sum of  the Products of the 
Greatest Diameter): 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  C omplete Remission  (CR): 
  Disappearance of all evidence of disease. 
  No dis ease related symptoms.  
  Lymph nod es, nodal masses regressed to “normal” size: 
o If >1.5 cm before treatment, regressed to ≤ 1.5 cm in GTD.  
o If 1.1 to 1.5  cm before treatment, regressed to ≤ 1  cm in GTD (or >75% in 
SPD). If PET scan was positive  before therapy, a post-treatment residual 
mass of any size is permitted as long  as it is PET n egative. PET is 
consid ered negative if target lesions all have uptake values below the  level 
of average uptake in the  liver.

  No in crease in size of other nodes, liv er or spleen. 
  Splenic and hepatic nodes regressed at least 50%  in SPD 
  No n ew sites of disease. 
  If the PET scan was positive  before therapy, the post-treatment PET is 
positive  in at least one  previous ly involv ed site. 
  Patients who achieve a CR by [CONTACT_86950], but who h ave persistent bone 
marrow involv ement (or those  in whom p re-treatment bone  marrow was 
involv ed and post -treatment bone  marrow involv ement was not assessed). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  R elapsed Disease (RD): 
  In patients previous ly CR : 
  New lesion >  1.5 cm in any axis 
  Size of previous ly involv ed site  has increase ≥ 50% in GTD.

o SPD of any node or other lesion.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Stable Disease (SD): 
  Patients who h ave achieved less than a partial remission but who h ave not 
developed findings consistent with p rogressive  disease. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Progressive  Disease (PD): 
  In patients previous ly PR or SD.

14.0 CRITERIA FOR R EMOVAL  FROM  STUDY  
 
Termination of  Treatment and/or  Study Participation 
 
Patients must be  informed that they have the right to withd raw from the  study at any time for 
any reason, without p rejudice to their medical care.  The  investigator also has the right to 
withd raw, and in some  cases is required to withd raw patients from the  study. 
 
The investigator or Millennium Pharmacovigilance may discontinue  the clinical research 
study if they determine  that the study or treatment offers little  or no future benefit, or the 
supply of medication ceases to be  available, or other causes prevent contin uation of  the 
clinical research study. If at any time the treating physician feels that continuing in the  study 
is not b eneficial for a given patient, or  if a patient is un able to follow the  treatment plan, 
treatment may be stopp ed. If there is progression  of disease despi[INVESTIGATOR_842028], it will be 
stopp ed.  If the investigator is in doubt as to wh ether progression h as occurred, particularly 
with respect to non t arget lesions and the  appearance of a new lesion, it is advisable to 
continue  treatment for up to one  addition al cycle until formal evaluation of  response  has been 
compl eted. Ev ery effort should be  made to compl ete this evaluation b efore the end of  the next 
cycle. 
 
15.0 BIOSTATISTICS 
 
15.1  Study Design/Endpoints 
For the weekly schedule, the MTD dos es of bortezomib (1.8 m g/m2) and cyclophosp hamide 
(1000 m g/m2) will be  brought forward to the  phase II portion.  For the twice-weekly 
schedule, the 1.3 mg/m2 dose of bortezomib will be  used.  Each treatment arm will be 
evaluated separately.  The study will employ a Simon two st age design in the analysis of  the 
Phase II portion in each arm separately. For indol ent lympho mas and M CL, a 60% response 
rate is consid ered promising, whereas, a 40% is considered not p romisin g. Assuming  Type I 
and Type II errors are 0.[ADDRESS_1170135] 
stage of each arm. If 7 or fewer patients in either treatment arm respond, no  addition al 
patients will be  enrolled in th at treatment arm and the regimen will be  considered not 
promising  in this cohort of patients. If 8 or more patients respond in either treatment arm, 
then an addition al 13 p atients (for a total of 30) will be enrolled in th at arm. 
 
We will use  the “pi[INVESTIGATOR_842029]” format based on the randomi zed phase II clinical trials 
approach proposed by [CONTACT_298835].(Simon, Wittes et al. 1985 ).  If both regimens are 
efficacious without si gnificant differences in to xicity, then we plan to pi [INVESTIGATOR_842030]:  If the numb er of patients who respond in  one arm is at least [ADDRESS_1170136] 1 p atient the  numb er of responders in the  other arm, th en the arm with  the higher 
response  rate (RR) would be declared the  winner. If neither arm had at least [ADDRESS_1170137] anned.

studies. 
 
15.2  Sample Size/Accrual Rate 
Approximately 1 to 2 patients will be  accrued per month.  It is expected that the duration of  the 
entire study should be  approximately 30-60 months. 60 p atients tot al will t ake part in Phase II of

17.3 A dverse events, regulatory and reporting requirements 
 
17.3.1  Definitions 
 
Adverse Event definition  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient 
administ ered a pharmaceutical product, whi ch does not n ecessarily have a causal 
relationship with the  treatment.  An adverse event can be any unfavorable and 
unint ended sign (eg, including  an abnormal laboratory finding ), symptom,  or 
disease temporally associated with the  use of the drug, whether or not it is 
consid ered to be  drug related.  This in cludes any newly occurring event or 
previous condition th at has increased in s everity or frequency since the 
administ ration of  drug. 
 
Serious Adv erse Event definition  
 
A Serious Adverse (SAE) is any adverse event, occurring at any dose and 
regardless of causality that: 
 Results in d eath. 
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Ca ncer Center 
IRB Protocol 
IRB#: 05-103 A(14) 
Amended: 07/25/12   
  
 Is life-threatening.  Life-threatening means that the patient was at imm ediate 
risk of  death from the  reaction as it occurred, ie, it do es not in clude a reaction 
which hypothetically might h ave caused death had it occurred in a more 
severe form. 
 Requires inpatient hospit alization or  prolongation of existing  hospit alization. 
Hospit al admissions and/or  surgical operations s cheduled to o ccur during the 
study period but pl anned prior to stu dy entry are not consid ered AEs if  the 
illness or disease existed before the patient was enrolled in the  trial, provided 
that it did not d eteriorate in an unexpected manner during the trial (eg, 
surgery performed earlier than planned). 
 Results in p ersistent or significant dis ability/incapacity.  Disability is defined 
as a subst antial disruption of  a persons’ ability to condu ct normal life 
functions.  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 Is an impo rtant medical event.  An impo rtant medical event is an event that 
may not result in d eath, be life-threatening, or require hospit alization but m ay 
be consid ered an SAE when, based upon  appropriate medical judgment, it 
may jeopardize the patient or subject and m ay require medical or surgical 
intervention to p revent one of the outcomes listed in the  definitions for 
SAEs.  E xamples of such medical events in clude allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive  treatment in an emergency room or  at hom e, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions th at do not result in inp atient hospit alization, or  the 
developm ent of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 
Clarification should be  made between the  terms “serious”  and “severe” since they are not 
synonymous.  The  term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a 
specific event (as in mild, mod erate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event its elf, 
however, may be of relatively minor  medical significance (such as a severe headache). 
This is not the  same as “serious,”  which is b ased on patient/event out come or action 
criteria described above  and are usually associated with events th at pose  a threat to a 
patient’s life or functionin g.  A severe adverse event do es not n ecessarily need to be 
consid ered serious.  For example, persistent nausea of several hours duration m ay be 
consid ered severe nausea but not an SAE.  On the  other hand, a  stroke resulting in on ly a 
minor  degree of disability  may be consid ered mild, but would be  defined as an SAE 
based on the  above noted criteria.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for 
defining regulatory reporting oblig ations.  
 
17.3.2 Procedures for AE and SAE reporting 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]     It is the  responsibili ty of the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_43865]/h er research 
team to id entify, review and report all necessary adverse events to the  institution al 
IRB, Mill ennium Pharmacovigilance and governmental agencies (i.e., NCI and/or 
FDA) as appropriate. Adverse events should be  identified through standard, 
routine  protocol review and clinical assessment of each subj ect participating in the

clinical trial. This review should be  timely in order to meet the requirements for 
adverse event reporting defined below. All un expected or serious adverse events 
(SAE), regardless of the type of research study, phase or sponsor  must be  reported 
to the  MSKCC IRB (see section 19.2 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  All serious adverse events (SAEs) (regardless of expectedness, causality, and 
whether commercial or investigational bortezomib is used) must be reported to 
Millennium Pharmacovigilance.  See Section 19.3.5 for the reporting of SAEs. The 
spons or-investigator is responsible to meet all regulations and requirements applicable to 
the sponsor-investigator. 
 
17.3.3  Millennium Reporting Guidelines 
Adverse events (AEs) may be  spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_5363]/or in response  to an open 
question from study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], ph ysical examination, or other diagnostic 
procedures.  AEs which are serious must be reported to Millennium Pharmacovigilance from first dose 
of bortezomib up to and including [ADDRESS_1170146] dose of bortezomib. 
 
When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common unde rlying pathology shou ld be noted as 
one comprehensive event. Any SAE that occurs at any time after completion of bortezomib treatment 
or after the designated follow-up pe riod that the investigator and/or sub-investigator considers to be 
related to any study drug must be reported to the Millennium Pharmacovigilance.  Planned ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_842034] (e.g., surgery was performed ea rlier or later than planned). All SAEs should be 
monitored until they are resolved or  are clearly determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic 
cond ition or  intercurrent illness(es). 
 
This is an investigator-initiated study.  The principal investigator, [CONTACT_842098], M D, PhD, 
(who may also so metimes be referred to as the spons or-investigator), is conducting the study and 
acting as the sponsor. Therefore, the legal/ethical obligations of the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_842035] a sponsor and those of an investigator. 
Sponso r-investigator must report all SAEs, regardless of expectedness or relationship with any  study 
drug, to Millennium Pharmacovigilance as soon as possible, but no later than 5 calendar  days of the 
spons or-investigator’s observation or awareness of the event.   For  external sites, the sponsor- 
investigator is responsible to ens ure that the SAE reports are sent to Millennium Pharmacovigilance 
from all sites participating in the study. Subinvestigators must report all SAEs to the sponsor- 
investigator so that the sponsor-investigator can meet his/her foregoing reporting obligations to 
Millennium Pharmacovigilance, unless otherwise agreed between the sponsor-investigator and 
subinvestigator(s). Millennium Pharmacovigilance may request follow-up information to a reported 
SAE, which the sponsor-investigator will be responsible for providing to Millennium 
Pharmacovigilance. 
 
The SAE report must include event term(s), serious criteria, and the sponsor-investigator’s or sub- 
investigator’s determination of both the intensity of the event(s) and the relationship of the event(s) to 
study drug administration. 
 
Intensity for each SAE, including any lab abnormality, will be determined by  [CONTACT_149629], 
version 4.0, as a guideline, whenever possible. The criteria are available online at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html.

investigator by [CONTACT_631043]: Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE is 
associated with the study drug(s)? 
 
Sponso r-investigator must also provide Millennium Pharmacovigilance with a copy of all

Procedures for Reporting Drug Exposure during Pregnancy and Birth Events 
 
If a woman beco mes pregnant or suspects that she is pregnant while participating in this study, she 
must inform the investigator immediately and must permanently discontinue study drug(s). All 
pregnancies and suspected pregnancies must be reported to Millennium Pharmacovigilance 
immediately.  The pregnancy must be followed for the final pregnancy  outcome (ie, delivery, still 
birth, miscarriage) and Millennium Pharmacovigilance will request this information from the sponsor- 
investigator. 
 
If a female partner of a male patient becomes pregnant during the male patient’s participation in this 
study, this must be reported to Millennium Pharmacovigilance immediately.  Every effort should be 
made to follow the pregnancy for the final pregnancy  outcome

18.2.1 Q uality Ass urance for Participating Sites 
 
Each site participating in the accrual of participants to this protocol will be audited by [CONTACT_842079], data verification 
and source documentation.  Audits  may be accomplished in one of two ways: (1) selected 
participant records can be audited on-site at participating sites or (2) source documents 
for selected participants will be sent to MSKCC for audit. Audits will usually be 
determined by [CONTACT_842080], but can also be prompt ed 
by [CONTACT_842081]. 
 
Audits  will be condu cted at least once shortly after initiation of participant recruitment at 
a site, annually during the study (or more frequently if indicated), and at the end or 
closeout of the trial. The numb er of participants audited will be determined by [CONTACT_842082]. 
 
The audit will in clude a review of source documentation to evaluate compliance for: 
 
• Informed consent do cuments and procedures 
• Adherence to eligibility criteria 
• Protocol defined treatment 
• Required baseline, on st udy and follow -up protocol testing

18.2.2  Da ta and Safety Monitoring 
 
The Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) Plans at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer 
Center were approved by [CONTACT_30589] 2001.  The  plans 
address the  new poli cies set forth by [CONTACT_11095] “Policy of the 
National Cancer Institute  for Data and Safety Monitoring of Clinical Trials” which can be 
found at:  http:// cancertrials.nci.nih. gov/researchers/dsm/ind ex.html.   The  DSM Plans at 
MSKCC were established and are monito red by [CONTACT_30591].  The 
MSKCC Data and Safety Monito ring Plans can be found on the  MSKCC Intranet at: 
http://mskweb2.ms kcc.org/irb/ind ex.htm 
 
There are several different mechanisms by [CONTACT_540286], 
safety and quality.  There are institution al processes in pl ace for quality assurance (e.g., 
protocol monito ring, compliance and data verification audits, th erapeutic respons e, and 
staff education on clinical research QA) and departmental procedures for quality control, 
plus th ere are two institution al committ ees that are responsible  for monito ring the 
activities of our clinical trials programs.  The  committees: Data and Saf ety Monitoring 
Committ ee (DSMC) for Phase I and II clinical trials, and the  Data and Saf ety Monitoring 
Board (DSMB) for Phase III clinical trials, report to the  Center’s Research Council and 
Institution al Review Board. 
 
During the protocol developm ent and review process, each protocol will be  assessed for 
its level of risk and degree of monito ring required.  Every type of protocol (e.g., NIH 
sponso red, in-house  sponsored, indust rial sponso red, NCI cooperative group, etc.) Will 
be addressed and the  monitoring procedures will be  established at the time of protocol 
activation.

Creatinine  clearance (CrCl) can be calculated using the Cockroft-Gault equation as follows: 
CrCl (ml/min)  = (140-age) (actual wt in kg) 
72 x serum creatinine  (mg/dl) 
For females use  85% of calculated CrCl value. 
Note: In markedly obese patients, the  Cockroft-Gault formula  will t end to ov erestimate 
the creatinine  clearance. (Adipose  tissue  tends to contribute  little creatinine requiring 
renal clearance.)

APPENDIX D:  NEW YORK  HEART  ASSOCIA TION (NYHA)  CLASSIFICATION OF   
 CARDIAC DI SEASE 
 
The following  table presents the  NYHA  classification of  cardiac disease: 
 
 
Class Functional Capacity Objective Assessment 
I Patients with cardiac disease but without resulting limitations of physical 
activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, 
palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], dyspnea, or anginal pain. No objective evidence of 
cardiovascular disease. 
II Patients with cardiac disease resulting in slight limitation of physical 
activity. They are comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity results in 
fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], dyspnea, or anginal pain. Objective evidence of 
minimal cardiovascular 
disease. 
III Patients with cardiac disease resulting in marked limitation of physical 
activity. They are comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary activity causes 
fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], dyspnea, or anginal pain. Objective evidence of 
moderately severe 
cardiovascular disease. 
IV Patients with cardiac disease resulting in inability to ca rry on any physical 
activity without discomfort. Symptoms of heart failure or the anginal 
syndrome may be present even at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken, 
discomfort is increased. Objective evidence of 
severe cardiovascular 
disease.

Goal: 
Assess the clinical impact o f buffered 1% lidocaine with epi[INVESTIGATOR_505147]-buffered 2% lidocaine with epi[INVESTIGATOR_505148] . 
 
Background:  
Based on discovery of the anesthetic effects followed by [CONTACT_505152] 19th century, cocaine was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_159049] a means of blocking 
painful sensory impulses during surgical procedures.(1) The discovery of procaine early in the 20
th century led to this newer drug replacing cocaine avoiding the potential  
addictive properties  of the latter . Lidocaine and its deriv atives, products of the late 20th 
century, mepi[INVESTIGATOR_9360], bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], and articaine,  are widely used today with invasive 
procedures. (2) Innovation continues allowing clinicians wider use of local a nesthetics in 
the head and neck region. Recently local anesthetics have been administered in vehicles 
such as liposomes to produce longer term sensory nerve blockade , reducing the need for 
analgesic drugs, chiefly opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], to reduce pain.( 3) New options for improving local 
anesthetic effectiveness continue to emerge with a better understanding of the 
pharmacology .(4) Buffering local anesthetics just prior to use produces positive outcomes 
including less “sting” on injection , faster onset of the drug, and possibly added drug 
potency, ie the same positive clinical effect at lower dosage . 
 The addition of a vasopressor, usually epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], to lidocaine and other injected local 
anesthetics serves to prolong the anesthetic effect by [CONTACT_29788]. To prolong 
the shelf life of the vasopressor , the drug combination must be formulated with a low pH, 
approximately pH 3.5 for lidocaine with 1/100k epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] . When inject ed, the low pH 
causes the “sting” felt by [CONTACT_29789]. Buffering to a neutral pH eliminates the 
discomfort.  (5-9) 
 
Perhaps more important, the local anesthetic drug is more effective if the pH is closer to the local anesthetic drugs pKa,, approximately 8.[ADDRESS_651670] the nerve membrane.  The 
drug injected at a neutral pH reduces the need for buffering by [CONTACT_505153]. The clinical outcome is a rapid onset of the local 
anesthetic. (8,9) 
 Anecdotal data suggest that the buffered form of the local anesthetic is more potent at 
equal dosages , and a lower dosage of the drug might be used with an effect equal to 
higher dosage not buffered. Clinical data are needed to confirm these anecdotal data.  No 
 
 
[ADDRESS_651671] a kit capable of efficiently accomplishing this end.(Anutra Medical, NC)  This 
option greatly facilitates clinical studies of dosages common for intraoral injections.  
 
 
Rationale:  
Anecdotal reports suggest buffer ing lidocaine with epi[INVESTIGATOR_29781] , results in a  deeper anesthetic effect , without the “sting” 
with injection  from a low pH . Additional data are needed to establish clinical important 
outcomes  such as depth of local anesthesia with lower drug dosages of buffered lidocaine 
with epi[INVESTIGATOR_505149] -buffered drug combination s currently in wide 
use. 
 
Clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_29782] a series of investigations to support or 
modify the use of the buffered anesthetic for intraoral procedures.  
. 
 Specific Aims:  
Compare clinical depths of pulpal anesthesia for mandibu lar molar, and canine teeth at 
30min intervals post injection for mandibular block anesthesia with buffered 1 % 
lidocaine with 1/100k epi[INVESTIGATOR_505150]- buffered 2% lidocaine with 
1/100k epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] . 
 
Hypotheses : 
No difference s exist in anesthet ic depth for pulpal anesthesia after intraoral injection for 
mandibular block anesthesia between buffered 1% lidocaine with 1/100k epi[INVESTIGATOR_505151] -buffered 2% lidocaine with 1/100k epi[INVESTIGATOR_238].

Methods:  Blinded, Randomized Clinical Design   
Recruit subject s with IRB approved consent at UNC  
Obtain NIH clinical trial registration  
Target enrollment 24 subjects 
Subjects will serve as their own controls  in a cross -over AB/BA study design  which is  
               uniform within sequences, uniform within periods, and balanced  
Sample size justi fication:  Primary interest is estimation of effect size from pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  
24 subjects should be sufficient to provide data to assess whether a larger study is    
               warranted and provide estimates for sample size calculation for larger stud ies.  
Vital signs recorded: [ADDRESS_651672] after drug administration , and 30min later after 
Randomize d subjects to be injected orally for mandibular block (inferior alveolar, 
lingual, buccal nerves) alternatively with 4cc of buffered 1% lidocaine with   
          1/100k epi[INVESTIGATOR_13027] 4cc non-buffered of 2% lidocaine with 1/100k epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] . 
SAS will be used to create randomization schedules:  
     The randomization will be performed first to type of drug given with a balanced        
      randomization (half subjects  buffered; half  to non-buffered)  
An OMS resident  or clinical OMS faculty will administer the drugs  in the OMS clinic . 
  
In week One  each subject would receive anesthetic to block the inferior alveolar   
          and lingual N ; Halstead or G ow-Gates techniques.  Buccal N. block. to complete   
              injection.  
At least a week later , longer than the elimination half -life of the drug lidocaine=  1.5-2hr, 
injections would involve the alternate local anesthetic combination.

Data Collection/ Analysis: 
Data will be managed by [CONTACT_29791]’s staff. Data collection forms and questionnaires for clinical data will be developed to use Teleform for direct scanning input into an ACCESS 
database.  Similar forms have been used in previous studies. All databases are stored on a 
password protected School of Dentistry server with specific group assignment.  SAS will 
be used for database management and statistical analysis.  Descriptive statistics are used to verify correct entry through range and logical check s.  
 Statistical analysis :  
Effect sizes are currently unknown for the difference  time to molar/canine response .  
Primary interest is the difference between type of injection . In order to check the 
assumption of negligible carryover effects , an unpaired t -test or a Wilcoxon Rank Sum 
test, depending on the distribution of the outcome, will be used to compare the  within 
subject sums of the results from sequence AB to the within subject sums from sequence 
BA.  
Under the assumption that the carryover effects are equal ( λ A = λA = λ ), the 
differences for every patient will be calculated and multiplied by ½.  The two sequences will 
be compared using a two- sample t test or a Wilcoxon rank sumtest depending on the 
distribution of the outcome .  
H0 : μAB - μBA = 0 
The expression:  
μAB - μBA = 2( μ A - μB ) 
so testing H 0 : μAB - μBA = 0, is equivalent to testing:  
H0 : μA - μB = 0 
 
Sample Size:  With a sample size in each sequence group of 12 (a total sample size of 24) a 2x2 crossover design will have 90% power to detect  a difference in means of -10.00

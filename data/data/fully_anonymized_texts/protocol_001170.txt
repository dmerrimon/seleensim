1.0 TITLE  
 
A study of cyclophosphamide (CY), fludarabine (FLU) and anti- thymocyte globulin (ATG) 
followed by [CONTACT_235846] (HCT) in patients with 
Fanconi Anemia (FA).  
  
2.[ADDRESS_285616]. 
 
2.2 Secondary Objectives  
 
To evaluate the incidence of:  
2.2.1 acute (aGVHD) and chronic (cGVHD) graft -versus-host disease 
2.2.2 regimen -related toxicity (RRT)  based on transplant outcomes through day 100 
2.2.3 one year survival 
2.2.4 late secondary malignancies (e.g. squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck, 
and cervix)  
  
3.0 STUDY DESIGN 
 
This is a study desi gned to evaluate neutrophil engraftment in Fanconi anemia (FA) patients 
transplanted with CD34+ selected bone marrow stem cells after a chemotherapy regimen consisting of CY, FLU and ATG.  
  
4.[ADDRESS_285617] after preparative regimens consisting of limited field irradiation (L FI) 
and low dose cyclophosphamide (CY).
1-7 
 For the IBMTR, Gluckman et al. (1995) analyzed the outcome of [ADDRESS_285618] for FA from HLA -identical siblings.
5  Age at transplant ranged from 1 to 39 years (median 10 years).  
Preparative therap ies consisted of low dose CY (15 to 25 mg/kg) and limited field irradiation (LFI; 
400-1500 cGy) with or without ATG (n = 75), low dose CY and total body irradiation (TBI; 300-800 cGy) (n = 20), and high dose CY (≥100 mg/kg) with or without ATG (n = 25).  G VHD prophylaxis 
regimens included cyclosporine (CSA) (n = 82), methotrexate (MTX) (n = 10), and (3) CSA and MTX (n = 28).  Two year probability of myeloid engraftment was 92%.  Probabilities of grade II- IV 
acute GVHD at day 100 was 42% and of chronic GVHD at 2 years 44%.  Probability of survival at 2 years was 66%.   In multivariate analysis, improved engraftment rates were observed with age of HCT ≤10 years, conditioning including ATG, and higher platelet count pretransplant.  In multivariate analysis, decreased mortality was observed with younger age, use of ATG in the conditioning regimen, conditioning with LFI and low- dose CY versus ≥100 mg/kg CY and no irradiation, and the 
use of cyclosporin with or without methotrexate for GVHD prophylaxis.  
MT2000- 09 – Matched Sibling Donor HCT in FA  
June 3, 2019     Page 7 of 30    CPRC #MT2000 -[ADDRESS_285619] may cure the hematological 
complications of FA, patients are still at high risk for malignancy with approximately 40% of patients 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a malignancy within 15- [ADDRESS_285620].8,9  In an analy sis of 700 patients with FA 
(n=79) or aplastic anemia (n=621) treated with allogeneic HCT in Seattle or Paris, the Kaplan -Meier 
estimate developi[INVESTIGATOR_235825] 20 years after transplantation was 14%.[ADDRESS_285621] was 42%.  For the entire cohort of patients, risk factors for developi[INVESTIGATOR_235826], and the diagnosis of FA.  In the non-FA group, chronic GVHD and azathioprine therapy, or irradiation were associated with increased risk of malignancy.  
 The Paris group described the long- term follow -up of 50 FA patients transplanted from a related 
donor.
9  With a median follow -up of >6 years, 32 patients (64%) we re alive with a probability of 
survival at 100 months of 58.5%.  In multivariate analysis, the only factor significant for poor survival was receiving more than [ADDRESS_285622] important long- term 
complication in this group of patients was the occurrence of epi[INVESTIGATOR_131715].  Six male patients developed epi[INVESTIGATOR_235827].  All six patients had extensive chronic GVHD.  The mean elapsed time between transplantation and the diagnosis of cancer was 8.2 years (range 5 -26 
years).   A seventh patient developed a liver carcinoma [ADDRESS_285623] and chronic hepatitis C.  The 8 - and 13- year projected 
incidence of malignancy in this cohort of patients was 24% and 43 % respectively.  
 In an attempt to reduce the risk of malignancy, the Seattle group used a preparative regimen of CY 120-200 mg/kg without irradiation in [ADDRESS_285624] (MSD in 38).
10  
GVHD prophylaxis was with CSA and MTX (n=27), CSA alone (n=6) or MTX alone (n=8).  Durable engraftment was observed in 88% of evaluable patients.  Two patients, each conditioned with 200 mg/kg CY developed squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity 9.[ADDRESS_285625] been used in a few cases.  In Hammersmith, 3 FA patients were transplanted with HLA- identical sibling donor BM after a preparative regimen of CY 20 mg/kg in 2 
cases and CY 80 mg/kg in one case.
[ADDRESS_285626] chosen fludarabine (FLU) to replace 
the use of irradiation.  FLU is an antimetabolite that has been shown to be an effective immunosuppressive agent in BMT conditioning therapy.
12-[ADDRESS_285627].  There are a couple of published case reports from Israel using a fludarabine in FA patients.
16,17  In both cases, preparative 
therapy consisted of CY (10 mg/m2), FLU (150 mg/m2) and ATG (40- 50 mg/kg).  GVHD 
prophylaxis consisted of CSA.  Stem cell sources were an HLA -matched cous in bone marrow in one 
case and an HLA -matched sibling umbilical cord blood in the second.  Myeloid engraftment was 
achieved on day +12 in the bone marrow recipi[INVESTIGATOR_235828] +28 in the UCB recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841].  Myeloid engraftment was achieved on day +28.  Acute grade II GVHD of the gut and liver developed in the UCB recipi[INVESTIGATOR_235829].
16  
 In summary, two factors appear to be associated with risk of late malignancy in FA patients: 1) TBI and 2) development of chronic GVHD.  Th erefore, in an attempt to decrease the risk of malignancy, 
we have developed a regimen that does not include irradiation and have incorporated TCD to reduce the risk of chronic GVHD.  In view of the fact that we are the largest referral center for HCT for FA 
and we have considerable experience with TCD, we have the unique ability to evaluate this treatment plan.  We anticipate transplanting 5 patients per year with sibling donors using this new protocol.

In April 2010, Isolex®300i System were no longer ava ilable as they ceased to be manufactured  and 
therefore enrolment on arm [ADDRESS_285628], a recipi[INVESTIGATOR_235830] -matched maternal BM, developed secondary graft 
failure (had initially engra fted but later lost the graft).  He was retransplanted using the same donor 
but later died from chronic GVHD.  Two patients also died after transplant from relapsed MDS.  In light of these events, in November 2002, the eligibility was changed to only allow for HLA -identical 
sibling donors and to exclude FA patients with MDS or acute leukemia.  A fourth patient (age 43 years) died from an intracranial hemorrhage shortly after transplantation. No patient has developed acute or chronic GVHD after an initial tr ansplantation.  To date, [ADDRESS_285629] successfully shown that neutrophil engraftment is achievable in FA 
patients transplanted with CD34+ selected bone marrow stem cells (using the Isolex®300i System ) 
after a chemotherapy regimen consisting of CY, FLU and ATG (arm 1 of trial).  As the Isolex®300i 
System is  no longer available we want to open a new arm of this protocol to study whether neutrophil 
engraftment is achievable in FA patients transplanted with CD34+ selected bone marrow stem cells (using the CliniMACS Cell Selection Sys tem) after the same chemotherapy regimen consisting of 
CY, FLU and ATG (arm 3).   We will continue to accrue patients in arm [ADDRESS_285630] 2010 revision as the starting point, an additional 20 patients will be accrued.

MT2000- 09 – Matched Sibling Donor HCT in FA  
June 3, 2019     Page 11 of 30    CPRC #MT2000 -09 
 the preparative regimen are defined in Appendix IV. 
 
6.1.1 Cyclophosphamide 
CY 5 mg/kg is to be given as a [ADDRESS_285637] attention to vigorous hydration, 
fluid balance and maintenance of good urine output.  Mesna (5 mg/kg) in divided doses may be given in the first 24 hours after CY.  
6.1.2 Fludarabine 
FLU 35 mg/m2 will be given IV over [ADDRESS_285638] practice procedures.  
 
6.1.3 Anti-thymocyte globulin  
ATG (ATGAM; Upjohn Corporation) 30 mg/kg/day will be administered after MP on days -6, -5, -4, -3 and - 2.  ATG will be diluted in sterile normal saline or half normal saline for 
intravenous infusion to a concentration of 1-2 mg/mL and will be infused through the Hickman catheter over 4 - 6 hours. In the event of a significant reaction to ATGAM, the agent 
will not be administered; instead patients will receive thymoglobulin (rabbit ATG) 1.5 mg/kg every 12 hours diluted in sterile normal saline or half normal saline for intravenous infusion to a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL and will be infused through the central venous line over 4 - 6 hours.  In the event of a significant reaction to thymoglobulin, the agent will not be administered.  
 Methylprednisolone (MP) 2 mg/kg/day intravenously every 24 hours will be given from day -6 until day - 2 as a premedication  for ATG.  
 
6.2 GVHD Prophylaxis  
 
Patients will receive cyclosporin e A (CSA) and mycophenylate mofetil (MMF) as GVHD 
prophylaxis. 
 
6.2.1 CSA 
Patients will receive CSA therapy beginning on day -3 with a taper commencing on day +100.  
For adults with normal b aseline renal function (creatinine <1.2 mg/dL), the initial dose will be 
2.5 mg/kg IV over 2 hours every 12 hours; for children <40 kg, the initial dose will be 2.5 
mg/kg IV over 2 hours every 8 hours.  CSA dosing will be monitored and altered as clinicall y 
appropriate per University of Minnesota Medical Center - Fairview pharmacy guidelines.  
Dose adjustments will be made on the basis of toxicity and low CSA levels with a trough level of <200 mg/L.    Once the patient can tolerate oral medications and has a normal gastrointestinal transit time, CSA will be converted to an oral form at a dose of 5.0 mg/kg PO every 12 hours.  Beginning on day +100 or 1 month after control of GVHD (whichever is later), CSA will be tapered by 10%/week.  
6.2.2 MMF 
Patients will receive MMF therapy beginning on day -3 through day +[ADDRESS_285639] day of 3 consecutive days of absolute neutrophil count [ANC] > 0.5 x 10
9/L. 
MT2000- 09 – Matched Sibling Donor HCT in FA  
June 3, 2019     Page 12 of 30    CPRC #MT2000 -09 
  
MMF will be give n at a dose of 15 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours PO (to a maximum dose of 1 
gram).  The MMF dose may be adjusted to tablet sizes of [ADDRESS_285640] orders. 
  
If the patient has acute GVHD requiring systemic therapy, MMF may be stopped 7 days after initiation of systemic therapy for acute GVHD (e.g. resolution of skin rash, vomiting, and diarrhea).

6.4 Stem Cell Infusion (day 0)  
Bone marrow and UCB grafts will be evaluated for sterility, cell viability, nucleated cell 
count, CD34 and CD3 counts. 
  6.4.1 Bone Marrow (arm 1 and 3) Refer to Section [ADDRESS_285642] Blood (arm 2) Selection of UCB will be based upon institutional guidelines. The selection of the UCB unit will be based on level of HLA match and cell doses following a University of Minnesota specific UCB Selection Algorithm. The ideal body weight will be determined for all patients.  
 The UCB will not be manipulated.  If one or both of the cord blood units used for the graft is unlicensed, the participant will co -enroll on University of Minnesota protocol MT2011-13R 
“Infusion of Cell Populations from Unlicensed Umbilical Cord Blood Units.”  The hydration regimen wi ll be given following institutional guidelines. Patients should 
receive pre -medication acetaminophen and diphenhydramine hydrochloride 15 to 30 minutes 
before infusion.   After proper identification and crosschecking according to institutional guidelines, the UCB unit will be infused through a central line without in- line filtration per institutional guidelines.  
 
 6.5 G- CSF 
Initiate G -CSF 5mcg/kg per day IV day +1 and continue until ANC ≥  2.5 x 109/L.

 108 nucleated cells/kg recipi[INVESTIGATOR_16148]. The ideal body weight will be determined for all 
patients.  
 
With the August 2010 protocol revision and the addition of study arm 3 (bone marrow processing 
using CliniMACS), CD34+ cells will be isola ted from the bone marrow with the CliniMACS ® Cell 
Selection System  (Miltenyi  Biotec ). Each patient is to receive 1.0 x 105/kg CD3+ cells.  An add back 
infusion of CD3+ cells may be required to achieve this prescribed cell dose.  Refer to the CMC for additi onal processing information and lot release criteria.   With the August  [ADDRESS_285644] 2016, the University of Minnesota 
received approval to use the CliniMACS CD34 Reagent System as a Humanitarian Use Device (HUD) as protocol number MT2015-31. With the November 2016 amendment, we will be using MT2015-31 to co- enroll subjects needing CD34+ cell isolation.  
 Prior to activation of the August 2010 amendment, cell selection was done using the Isolex®300i 
System (Nexell Therapeutics, Inc.) under treatment arm 1 (bone marrow processing using Isolex®300i System).

9.0 EVENT REPORTING AND DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN 
 Toxicity and adverse events will be classified according to NCI's Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events V 4.0 (CTCAE). A copy of the CTCAE can be downloaded from the CTEP home page:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm#ctc_40
 
 FOR UNLICENSED UCB UNITS ONLY: Selec ted expected adverse reactions determined to be 
caused by [CONTACT_235847]-[ZIP_CODE] (C. Brunstein, MD, PhD –sponsor /investigator).  
 FOR CD34+ SELECTED CELLS ONLY: Any clinically significant safety issues associated with cell processing failure or device malfunction regarding the CliniMACS® system must be reported to the PI ([CONTACT_186207] MacMillan) and Miltenyi (boston@ miltenyibiotec.com) per 
institutional procedures under protocol MT2015-31.  
 
Note:  throughout this section the generic term “study drug” is used to refer to the study related treatment . 
 
9.1   Adverse Event Reporting  
 
9.1.1  Definitions  
 
The following definitions are based on the Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 Part 312.32 (21CFR312.32(a)).    Adverse Event :  Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.   Suspected Adverse Reactio n:  Any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the drug caused the adverse event.   Life-Threatening Adverse Event Or Life- Threatening Suspected Adverse Reaction : An 
adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of 
either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death.    Serious Adverse Event Or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction :  An adverse event or 
suspected adverse reaction is co nsidered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
MT2000- 09 – Matched Sibling Donor HCT in FA  
June 3, 2019     Page 16 of 30    CPRC #MT2000 -09 
 • A life -threatening adverse event  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
 Unexpected adverse event or unexpected suspected adverse react ion: An adverse event or 
suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application, as amended.  Thus, adverse events that occur as part of the disease process or underlying medical conditions are considered unexpected; however, they will not be reportable per section 9.1.2.  Expedited (Rapid) Reporting : Certain events may require rapid notification to entities 
providing patient safety oversight (e.g. IRB) as detailed in section 9.1.2.    Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_235832]:  The following events count toward a study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_235833] 
10.[ADDRESS_285650] be reported to the MCC Study Coordinator using the Early Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_235834]: • graft failure at day +42  
• death  by [CONTACT_4475] [ADDRESS_285651] an early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_235835] a serious adverse event requiring expedited reporting and should be reported as such only if they meet the criteria for expedited reporting as defined in the above table.  
 
In addition, the IRB considers any of the following problems/situations as meeting the definition of UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845]: 
• Any accidental or unintentional change to the IRB-approved protocol that increases risk or has the potential to recur  
• Any deviation from the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate apparent immediate hazard to a research subject  
• Any publication in the literature, safety monitoring report (including Data and Safety 
Monitoring Reports), interim result or other finding that indicates an unexpe cted change to 
the risk/benefit ratio of the research  
• Any breach in confidentiality that may involve risk to the subject or others  
• Any complaint of a subject that cannot be resolved by [CONTACT_16133]  
• Any other possibly related event which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_235836]2000- 09 – Matched Sibling Donor HCT in FA

 FOR UNLICENSED UCB UNITS ONLY:  These p atients will be co -enrolled on 
University of Minnesota protocol MT2011-13R.  Selected expected adverse reactions  
determined to be caused by [CONTACT_235848]-[ZIP_CODE] (C. Brunstein, MD, PhD – sponsor/investigator). Included are the following: 
• The unit is mislabeled or failure to pass local lot release  
• Serious infusion reaction within first 24 hours after infusion 
• Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_186185] a contaminated UCB 
within 24 hours after infusion 
 
FOR CD34+ SELECTED CELLS ONLY : These patients will be co -enrolled on University 
of Minnesota protocol MT2015-31. Adverse events determined to be caused by [CONTACT_235849]34+  enriched cell product for hematopoietic reconstitution based on 
objective evidence will be reported to the IRB and Miltenyi Biotech per institutional procedures under protocol MT2015-31.  
9.1.2 Event Monitoring and Required Reporting

 The study’s Data and Safety Monitoring Plan will be in compliance with the University of 
Minnesota Masonic Cancer Center's Data & Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP), which can be accessed at http://z.umn.edu/dmsp . 
 For the purposes of data and safety monitoring, this study is classified as moderate risk.  
Therefore the following requirements will be fulfilled:  
 The Masonic Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Council (DSMC) will review the trial’s progress twice yearly  
 The PI [INVESTIGATOR_186187]. 
 The PI [INVESTIGATOR_235837] 9.1.2 to the Masonic Cancer Center’s SA E 
Coordinator and  the University of Minnesota IRB.   
 
In addition, at the time of the continuing review with the University of Minnesota IRB, a copy of the report with any attachments will be submitted to the Cancer Protocol Review Committee (CPRC).  
 
9.2.[ADDRESS_285652] Retention  
The investigator will retain study records including source data, copi[INVESTIGATOR_235838], consent forms, HIPAA authorizations, and all study correspondence in a secured facility for at 6 years after the study file is closed with the I RB.   
 In addition, the Clinical Trials Office (CTO) will keep a master log of all patients participating in the study with sufficient information to allow retrieval of the medical records for that patient.   Please contact [CONTACT_102676].  
 10.0 EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
Recent experience has demonstrated that among patients using a stem cell source from processed bone marrow using Isolex 300i, the primary graft failure rate is 0%.
 Therefore we 
expect that graft failure will be observed in very few patients.  
10.1Statistical Endpoints  
10.1.[ADDRESS_285653]-transplant 
10.1.2 Secondary Endpoints 
• The cumulative incidence of acute and chronic GvHD  
• The cumulative incidence of regimen -related toxicity based on transplant related 
outcomes by [CONTACT_4475] [ADDRESS_285654]-transplant 
• Probability of survival by [CONTACT_235850]- transplant  
• The proportion of late second malignancies 
MT2000- 09 – Matched Sibling Donor HCT in FA  
June 3, 2019     Page 19 of 30    CPRC #MT2000 -09 
 10.2  Statistical Analysis  
Simple proportions along with 95% confidence intervals will be used to evaluate the 
incidence of primary neutrophil engraftment. Medians and ranges for time to engraftment will also be given. A competing risk of early death is not expected among these patients. Cumulativ e incidence will be used to estimate regimen -related toxicity and GvHD ; treating 
non-event deaths as competing risks. Kaplan- Meier curves will be used to estimate overall 
survival. Additional descriptive statistics will be used for safety parameters and to  evaluate 
data from the UCB cohort. 
10.3  Sample Size Justification  
The maximum sample size will be 39 patients (29 for arm 3 using bone marrow processing 
using CliniMACS and 10 or fewer patients receiving UCB). Twenty- nine patients are 
sufficient to maintain a n overall type I error of 5% while providing 80% statistical power. The 
sample size calculation is based on the Simon method using a minimax two -stage design  
(Simon, R [1989], Optimal two- stage designs for phase II clinical trials. Controlled Clinical 
Trials, 10; 1-10).  
 
The two -stage design uses a two -step enrollment procedure with early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_235839] 
80% of patients fail to engraft. More than 95% engraftment shows evidence that this procedure is worthy of further investigation.  
 
The first enroll ment will include [ADDRESS_285655] 2012 version.

the protocol, the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_235841]:

11.[ADDRESS_285660] OF THE STUDY 
 
11.1 Ethical Considerations  
 
While there will be every effort to seek out and include females and minority patients, the patient population is dependent upon the referral pattern and the ability to locate a matched sibling donor or a UCB unit.  Females and minority patients are eligible for all aspects of the study and their partic ipation will be actively encouraged.   
 11.2 Good Clinical Practice  
 The study will be conducted in accordance with the appropriate regulatory requirement(s).  Essential clinical documents will be maintained to demonstrate the validity of the study and the integrity of the data collected.  Master files should be established at the beginning of the study, maintained for the duration of the study and retained according to the appropriate regulations.   
 
11.3 Informed Consent  
 All potential study participants will be given a copy of the IRB -approved consent to review. 
The investigator or designee will explain all aspects of the study in lay language and answer all questions regarding the study. If the participant decides to participate in the study, she/he will be asked to sign and date the consent document. Patients who refuse to participate or who withdraw from the study will be treated without prejudice.

Occurs in <[ADDRESS_285668] be maintained before and after Cycloph osphamide (CY) administration to 
help prevent hemorrhagic cystitis.  Hemorrhagic cystitis is a serious and potentially life -threatening 
toxicity of Cytoxan therapy.  The incidence varies but has a relationship to dose.  The toxicity is related to the direc t contact [CONTACT_235851][INVESTIGATOR_2130].  The recommended 
maintenance fluid is 3000 cc/m
2/[ADDRESS_285669]. High urine volume with frequent voiding (q 1-2 hour) is important to decrease the toxic exposure.  Mesna (total 60 mg/kg/day in 5 divided doses) may be given before CY, and 3, 6, [ADDRESS_285670] that appears approximately 4 hours after and is maximal 10 -14 hours 
after CY administration.  This can be controlled with furosemide.  In any patient with urine output inappropriate relative to the high volume IV input, furosemide should be given.  It is critical to closely monitor electrolytes during this diuresis.  See standing orders for administration of CY.

Methylprednisolone (MP) - possible side effects include weight gain and water retention, puffiness of 
the face, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, bleeding from the stomach and intestines due to ulcers, and personality changes including depression. High blood pressure and water retention can be treated with medications and very high levels of blood sugar can be corrected with insulin. 
 
Long -term use (which is not planned) has been associated with reversible muscle weakness and 
muscle thinning and cataracts.  It has also been associated with bone thinning; this has sometimes progressed to areas o f bone death, called “avascular necrosis” or “AVN”, especially at the knees and 
hips.  In addition, methylprednisolone or prednisone makes patients  prone to infections.

 B. Toxicities associated with T cell depletion of bone marrow  
 
The toxicities and com plications that could potentially result from the removal of lymphocytes from 
the donated bone marrow are failure of bone marrow engraftment (due to loss or damage to hematopoietic progenitor cells), an increased risk of relapse, and an increased risk of E BV-associated 
lymphoproliferative syndrome.  
C. Toxicities associated with Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation  
• nausea and vomiting  
• possible allergic reaction (including itching, hives, flushing [red face], shortness of breath, 
wheezing, chest tightness, skin rash, fever, chills, stiff muscles, or trouble breathing)

 APPENDIX V – DRUG FORMULATION AND AVAILABILITY  
 
Cyclophosphamide  
Cyclophosphamide is a nitrogen mustard- derivative, polyfunctional alkylating agent.  Cyclophosphamide for injection is 
commercially available as a sterile so lution in sodium chloride or as a powder that is reconstituted in sterile or 
bacteriostatic water.  Institutional guidelines for handling, reconstitution and administration should be followed.  
Cyclophosphamide can cause temporary hair loss, nausea, vomiti ng, diarrhea, and lowering of the blood cell counts or 
hemorrhagic cystitis.  Anti -emetics should minimize nausea and vomiting.  At the dose of cyclophosphamide used in this 
study, these symptoms are expected to be modest in severity.   
Formulation :  Parenteral 100 mg and 500 mg vials.  Commercially available.  
Storage :  Room temperature. 
Mixing :  I.V. drug should be mixed with sterile water for I.V. use.  Dissolves very slowly with cold water.  It helps to 
warm the water or to warm the vial after adding water.

Administration :  Cyclophosphamide is added to D5W and administered I.V.  
 
Fludarabine  
Fludarabine is an antimetabolite.  Fludarabine for injection is commercially available as a lyophilized cake that is 
reconstituted in sterile water.  Institutional guidelines for handling, reconstitution and administration should be followed.   
Fludarabine can cause lowering of blood counts, suppression of the immune system, nausea and vomiting, fever, hypersensitivity reaction, tumor lysis, transient elevation in serum transaminases, and neurotoxicity at doses generally 
higher than administered in this study.  
Formulation :  50 mg vial as a white lyophilized cake for IV use.  Commercially available.  
Storage :  Room temperature. 
Mixing :  Add 2 mL sterile water to vial to give a final concentration of 25 mg/mL.

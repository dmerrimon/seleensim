MAIN OUTCOMES  
 
The primary outcomes of this study are related to feasibility. This includes the domains of 
acceptability, demand, implementation, practicality, integration, adaptation, expansion, and 
preliminary efficacy testing (based on Bowen, et al., 2009, Am J Prev M ed). Below, we present each of 
the feasibility domains, how they will be measured, and corresponding hypotheses (in parentheses) .

- How likely would you be to tell your friends about this game? (≥80% ) 
 
DEMAN D 
- The number of hours the game was played (≥75% who played for ≥1 hour ) 
- Intervention group’s self -reported use of the game in hours (≥75% who played for ≥1 hour )

- How many times  texted before they completed survey? (exploratory ) 
- How many times contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]? (exploratory ) 
- Percent of people who consented post screening (80% ) 
- How long does it take to get 240 people to enroll in the study? (exploratory ) 
- Did randomization work? ( yes, we hypothesize no group differences in demographics at baseline ) 
- How many got randomized? (240 participants ) 
- How many people recruited from which venue? (exploratory ) 
 
PRACTICALIT Y 
- How many people have PC or Mac computers in our screening proced ures (exploratory ) 
- Screening based on having an email address (exploratory ) 
- How easily was the game downloaded without contact[CONTACT_800384]? (exploratory ) 
- Feelings of safety with regards to password protection? (exploratory ) 
- Feelings  of safety with regards to having other people see the game? (exploratory ) 
- Did the game interfere with other activities? (exploratory ) 
 
INTEGRATIO N 
- How could this better fit into the youth’s life? (exploratory ) 
- How well does this fit into youth’s lif e now? (exploratory ) 
- How could the game be improved? (exploratory ) 
 
ADAPTATIO N 
- Would you want to be able to play this game on your phone (an app)? (exploratory ) 
- Did you like this game on the computer? (exploratory ) 
- This game may not be appropriate for older kids. (how much do they agree with this? Exploratory ) 
- We will examine the Gaming Experience Questionnaire scores by [CONTACT_547], sexual orientation, 
race/ethnicity, age (exploratory ) 
 
EXPANSIO N 
- How could the game  be improved? (exploratory ) 
- What would you like to be added to the game? (exploratory ) 
- What would you like removed from the game? (exploratory ) 
 
PRELIMINARY EFFICACY TESTIN G 
We hypothesize that the intervention group (versus control group) will have gr eater levels of change 
over time in the following outcomes : 
1. Increased help -seeking self -efficacy, intentions, and behavior s 
2. Increased copi[INVESTIGATOR_800350] y 
3. Increased knowledge and use of online resource s 
4. Decreased bullying an d cyberbullying victimizatio n 
5. Decreased lonelines s 
6. Decreased mental health problems (anxiety, depression, suicidality ) 
7. Decreased substance use (alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs ) 
8. Decreased internalized sexual and gender minority stigm a 
 
 
 
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
 
For the measures of acceptabili ty, demand, implementation, practicality, integration, adaptation, and 
expansion, we will report results using descriptive statistics (i.e., percentages and frequencies for 
categorical variables, or means and standard deviations for continuous variables) . 
 
For the preliminary efficacy testing outcomes, we will use repeated measures (i.e., multilevel) 
statistical models using logistic or linear regression, depending on the distribution of the outcomes. To 
examine whether there were greater improvements over time in the intervention group versus control 
group, we will test the interaction term of time by [CONTACT_19313]. While we are powered to find medium effects 
(based on Cohen), our primary interest is in estimating the effect size and confidence interval width, 
which will help us power a future, larger randomized controlled trial .

T3.0 What is the anticipated risk to the research participants?
Minimal Risk  
T3.1 Why do you feel that all aspects of this research study, including screening and
follow-up, involve no more than minimal risk to the research subjects?
The probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in our research study are
not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life (i.e., of the
general population). 
Asking sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth questions about help-seeking behaviors,
bullying experiences, mental health, substance use experiences, and their experience with
the game intervention should be regarded as minimal risk. The probability and magnitude
of harm or discomfort anticipated in our research study are not greater in and of
themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life (i.e., of the general population). 
The survey questions to be asked are questions and discussions that youth normally have.
Additionally, these survey questions are routinely as part of the Youth Risk Behavioral
Surveillance Survey (YRBSS) throughout the [LOCATION_002] as part of their high-school
experience. 
It should also be mentioned that the confidential nature of the surv eys greatly reduces risk
to participant.

     [reviewer notes¬]  
1.1 Objective: What is the overall purpose of this research study?   (Limit response to 1-
2 sentences.)
The purpose of this research study is to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary
efficacy of a randomized controlled trial of a game-based intervention is able to increase
help-seeking-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors, reduce health risk
factors/behaviors, and increase resiliencies among sexual and gender minority (SGM)
youth. 
  
1.2 Specific Aims: List the goals of the proposed study (e.g., describe the relevant
hypotheses or the specific problems or issues that will be addressed by [CONTACT_45662]).
The goals of the proposed study are to: 
1) Test the feasibility and acceptability of a game-based intervention to increase help-
seeking-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors among sexual and gender minority
(SGM) youth; and 
2) Using a randomized controlled trial, test the preliminary efficacy of a game-based
intervention to increase help-seeking-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors, reduce
health risk factors/behaviors, and increase resiliencies among SGM youth.
 
1.3 Background: Briefly describe previous findings or observations that provide the
background leading to this proposal.  
Sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth experience high rates of bullying. Based on 28
school-based studies of randomly selected youth, Friedman et al., 61 found that 44.4% of
lesbian, 39.9% of bisexual female, 43.2% of gay male, and 50.2% of bisexual male
teenagers reported physical assault by a peer at school (prior year), rates that far exceeded
those of heterosexual youth. SGM youth also disproportionately experience negative health
outcomes. Meta-analyses by [CONTACT_800386], compared to young
heterosexuals, were 190% more likely to use illicit drugs 57, 85% and 200% more likely to
experience depression and suicidality respectively 107, and 91% more likely to combine sex
and alcohol (p values <.01) 108. HIV prevalence among young men who have sex with
men is an astounding 7.2% 109. Bullying appears to be a driver of these health disparities.
School-based studies found associations between peer victimization and suicidalit y, drug
use, and sexual risk among SGM youth 62-64. 
Making matters worse, anti-bullying programs that focus on perpetrators have shown small
to moderate effects 65,110. SGM youth will therefore enter toxic school environments on an
ongoing, daily basis. 
The prevalence of bullying victimization, health outcomes, and associations between
victimization and health outcomes are similar among SGM youth. Further, the needs of SGM
youth who are bullied appear to be unique. For example, bullied SGM youth have less
access to copi[INVESTIGATOR_175815]. Beyond typi[INVESTIGATOR_800360], SGM youth often
fear reactions by [CONTACT_800387] 16,17. The gay-related shame
many SGM youth internalize 19,20 may make it more likely for them to blame themselves
for bullying thus impacting their ability to cope. 
We seek to improve health and academic outcomes of SGM youth through a game-based
intervention they can easily access. Playing a game is advantageous as SGM youth are
often “out” to no or few others off-line 111,112. The game will therefore be accessible to
SGM youth who are insufficiently supported in offline programs 60,88,113. The game-based
environment is relatively safe for SGM youth to gain copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110] 94,95. Game-based
programs about sex 86,87, mental health114, alcohol use 72-75,115, asthma 116-119, and
smoking 76-[ADDRESS_1104443] with individuals usually,
though not always, produce greater effects than “stand-alone” game-based interventions
120-127, our review suggests that “stand-alone” game-based programs produce significant
change with respect to various health issues 72-74,76-85,87,128-134. Other advantages of

https://www.osiris.pi[INVESTIGATOR_32887].edu/osiris/CustomLayouts/SmartFormPrint/PrintSmartForms?Project=com.webridge.entity.Entity%5BOID%5B91FBF9B09824 … 11/44Section: Section 1 - Objective, Aims, Background and Significance
“stand-alone” game-based interventions are increased fidelity, cost-effectiveness and the
ability to reach far larger numbers of individuals 133,135-140. 
We chose a game format as 78% of teens play games 141. Games have promoted behavior
change in asthma and cancer treatment, and weight control 90,91,93,142. Primary school
students who problem solved in virtual situations were more likely to end real-life bullying
than controls 3. Grade 7-10 students who experienced cognitive restructuring, graded
exposure to and coaching in simulated situations were more likely than controls to stop
bullying 4,143. These programs’ effects were however moderate and short-term. 
 
1.4 Significance: Why is it important that this research be conducted? What gaps in
existing information or knowledge is this research intended to fill?  
We believe our game-based intervention will produce larger and longer-term effects than
the above programs because: 1) Our game will utilize more engaging storylines. 2) Prior
programs primarily focused on bullying whereas our game also focuses on social and
emotional learning (S&EL). S&EL programs build self-management, interpersonal, and
problem solving skills, and produce more confident 144 and socially connected 99 y outh
and such youth report less bullying 105,106. 3) The above games did not address
subgroups’ needs. We will address experiences of SGM youth (e.g., gay-related shame; fear
of “double victimization”) 19,145. 4) Our game design and testing are based on state-of -
the-art methods 90,146-150. It has been developed by [CONTACT_800388]-based programs
and experts in adolescence, SGM youth, bullying, and game-based programs. 5) The game
is informed by [CONTACT_431538]-based logic model ensuring it will attend to behavior change
theory and posited mediators. 
To our knowledge, this game-based intervention is the:
• First online program targeting SGM youth who are bullying victims, a format that has the
potential to reach far greater numbers of SGM youth than traditional face-to-face
interventions.
• First bullying prevention program to utilize a gaming format to attract participation and
build retention.
• First intervention addressing social and emotional learning with respect to help-seeking
among SGMyouth.
• First online intervention with 14-18 year olds - as opposed to the typi[INVESTIGATOR_800361]
“youth” who are 18+.

This is an intervention designed specifically for young sexual and gender minority (SGM)
youth. All game development procedures have been conducted in consult with SGM aged
14-17 and experts in the field of SGM youth.
Please see the background section of this IRB protocol. Generally, SGM youth are at far
higher risk to be bullied by [CONTACT_8699]. There is very little systematic support available for these
youth to help them cope with such bullying. Our program will focus on this age range to
decrease negative outcomes associated with bullying victimization among this population.

45 CFR 46.407
The risk is justified by [CONTACT_32117]; and the relation of
the anticipated benefit to the risk is at least as favorable to the subjects as that
presented by [CONTACT_167899].
Provide a justification which must address all considerations related to the
designated category of research:
The probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in our research study are
not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life (i.e., of the
general population). 
Asking sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth questions about help-seeking behaviors,
bullying experiences, mental health, substance use experiences, and their experience with
the game intervention should be regarded as minimal risk. The probability and magnitude
of harm or discomfort anticipated in our research study are not greater in and of
themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life (i.e., of the general population). 
The survey questions to be asked are questions and discussions that youth normally have.
Additionally, these survey questions are routinely as part of the Youth Risk Behavioral
Surveillance Survey (YRBSS) throughout the [LOCATION_002] as part of their high-school
experience. 
We should reiterate that all participants will be given information about contact[CONTACT_232560]
[INVESTIGATOR_124]. Egan should they have questions or concerns about the study or their reactions to it.
The participants will also be provided with national hotlines for SGM youth should they
require support. Of note, ALL individuals will automatically be giv en information about the
Trevor Project which is a well respected hotline that can be accessed either online or by
[CONTACT_800393]. 
It should also be mentioned that the confidential nature of the surv eys greatly reduces risk

Finalized R21 Facebook pi[INVESTIGATOR_800370].docx 11/13/2017 10:[ADDRESS_1104467] with participants:   We will advertise on Facebook to a wide audience of SGM youth. We intend to create a
formal Facebook ad. It is a side-bar ad. We are not using an in-line ad. An individual who is
interested in participating will click on the advertisement (see 4.1). 
We will also recruit participants from SGM-related online gaming groups, such as
geeksout.org, Gay Geeks (Facebook group), GaymerX (Facebook group), Transmission
Gaming, and the following Reddit Gaymer forums:
https://www.reddit.com/r/gaymers/
https://www.reddit.com/r/Gaymer/
https://www.reddit.com/r/LGBTFC/

https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/)
All potential participants will be taken to a REDCap survey page that will present the
screening questions. See the screening consent script in section 4.6.3. 
We will also have a Facebook page, where we will advertise our study. No one, except us, is
able to post comments on the Facebook page. We will continue to monitor this page to
ensure that this setting remains constant.

seeking behaviors, bullying experiences, mental health, substance use
experiences, and their experience with the game intervention should be
regarded as minimal risk. The probability and magnitude of harm or
discomfort anticipated in our research study are not greater in and of
themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life (i.e., of the general

The survey questions to be asked are questions and discussions that youth
normally have. Additionally, these survey questions are routinely as part of
the Youth Risk Behavioral Surveillance Survey (YRBSS) throughout the
[LOCATION_002] as part of their high-school experience. 
We should reiterate that all participants will be given information about

study or their reactions to it. The participants will also be pro vided with
national hotlines for SGM youth should they require support. Of note, ALL

The waiver
or alteration
will not
adversely
affect the
rights and
welfare of
the subjects;
[45 CFR
46.116 (d)
(2)]A description of the risks to subjects and procedures for protecting against
these risks follows as a demonstration that the waiver or alteration will not
adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects. 
Potential risks to subjects:
1) Risk of being “outed.” It is possible that someone will see what the
individual is answering questions or playing a game with SGM content.
2) Risk to confidentiality. 
3) Difficult feelings could arise due to answering questions. 
4) Will not obtaining parental consent for minors place these youth at risk? 
Procedures for Protecting Against Risk:
Note: This is an confidential survey. 
1) Risk of being “outed.” It is possible that someone will see what the
individual is answering questions or playing a game with SGM content.
Youth will be told in the assent/consent pages that this is a risk and will be
told how to protect against this. Specifically, they will be told that it is
important to be aware of their surroundings during the survey while
answering questions and while playing the game. They will be told that it is
prudent to be concerned in the same way as they normally are concerned
when engaging in any SGM-related content online (to the extent that being
“outed” is a concern to each individual). Additionally, the game will have
login procedures in which only the participants are given unique information
(username [CONTACT_2383]) for logging into the game.
2) Risk to confidentiality. 
An Internet study has a slightly different risk to confidentialit y than
conventionally-based studies. On the one hand, there is an inherent risk to
confidentiality in conventional studies just by [CONTACT_800395] a site (e.g., a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], service organization, University) where someone
might see them and intuit why they are there. Similarly, mail surveys may
be intercepted by [CONTACT_26404]’ snoopi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. By [CONTACT_2163], Internet studies
can be conducted at any location chosen that the individual feels most
comfortable (e.g., at home, school, coffee-house) thus providing the

which only the participants are given unique information (username [CONTACT_201967]) for logging into the game.
3) Difficult feelings could arise due to answering questions. 
Will difficult feelings arise due to answering questions about experiences of
help-seeking, bullying, substance use, and mental health problems? W e have
argued to our IRB previously that asking SGM youth questions of these types
should be regarded as minimal risk. The University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_800371]. The probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort
anticipated in our research study are not greater in and of themselv es than
those ordinarily encountered in daily life (i.e., of the general population). 
Asking sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth questions about help-
seeking behaviors, bullying experiences, mental health, substance use
experiences, and their experience with the game intervention should be
regarded as minimal risk. The probability and magnitude of harm or
discomfort anticipated in our research study are not greater in and of
themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life (i.e., of the general
population). 
The survey questions to be asked are questions and discussions that youth
normally have. Additionally, these survey questions are routinely as part of

individuals will automatically be given information about the Trevor Project
which is a well respected hotline that can be accessed either online or b y
phone that specializes in the support of suicidal SGM youth. 
4) Will not obtaining parental consent for minors place these youth at risk? 
We have received waivers of parental consent for prior studies of SGM youth.
We have successfully argued that by [CONTACT_800396] “come out” to
their parents in order to participate in studies, without considering the
potential consequences of “coming out” (see IRB Protocol PRO16020455).
Further, by [CONTACT_800397]. And SGM youth
who are being bullied and who have supportive and accepting parents are
probably at less risk for negative outcomes as compared to those youth who
are bullied with rejecting and even abusive parents. 
Finally, the assent/consent process described in other parts of this
application describe a process for ensuring that participants ha ve understood
the risks associated with the study and the voluntary nature of the study
before they agree to participate.
The research SGM youth are at significant risk for rejection and even abuse by [CONTACT_3654].

practicably
be carried
out without
the waiver or
alteration;
[45 CFR
46.116 (d)
(3)]We know based on the research and our work with these youth that many
such youth would not participate in a study because they are not "out" to
their parents and requiring parental support for such a study would
necessitate them coming out to their parents and facing potential rejection.
Restricting our study to SGM youth who are "out" to their parents will would
be a huge impediment with respect to achieving the aims of the study (e.g. ,
understanding help-seeking behaviors of youth who are closeted. Further, we
need youth who have been bullied to participate in this study and many such
bullying incidents are related to these adolescents' sexual orientation. Again,
revealing this to their parents could put these youth in harms way.
Whenever
appropriate,
the subjects

provided

information

logging into the game.
2) Risk to confidentiality. 
An Internet study has a slightly different risk to confidentialit y than conventionally-based
studies. On the one hand, there is an inherent risk to confidentialit y in conventional studies
just by [CONTACT_800400] a site (e.g., a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], service organization,
University) where someone might see them and intuit why they are there. Similarly, mail
surveys may be intercepted by [CONTACT_26404]’ snoopi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. By [CONTACT_2163], Internet studies can
be conducted at any location chosen that the individual feels most comfortable (e.g., at
home, school, coffee-house) thus providing the individual with more choices and control
over this element of risk. Since our recruitment strategy is through Facebook, by [CONTACT_108],
all potential participants in this study will have engaged in a level of risk to confidentiality
that is comparable to their regular Internet usage by [CONTACT_800401]. 
Our study has in place a number of safe-guards to protect participants. All data will be
stored on fire-walled servers. Please remember that the data collection will be done in a
confidential fashion. Administrative accounts will use strong passwords. Additionally, the
game will have login procedures in which only the participants are given unique information
(username [CONTACT_2383]) for logging into the game.
3) Difficult feelings could arise due to answering questions. 
Will difficult feelings arise due to answering questions about experiences of help-seeking,
bullying, substance use, and mental health problems? We have argued to our IRB
previously that asking SGM youth questions of these types should be regarded as minimal
risk. The University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_800372]. The probability and magnitude
of harm or discomfort anticipated in our research study are not greater in and of
themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life (i.e., of the general population). 
Asking sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth questions about help-seeking behaviors,
bullying experiences, mental health, substance use experiences, and their experience with
the game intervention should be regarded as minimal risk. The probability and magnitude
of harm or discomfort anticipated in our research study are not greater in and of

The survey questions to be asked are questions and discussions that youth normally have.

4) Will not obtaining parental consent for minors place these youth at risk? 
We have received waivers of parental consent for prior studies of SGM youth. We have
successfully argued that by [CONTACT_800402] “come out” to their parents in order to participate in
studies, without considering the potential consequences of “coming out ” (see IRB Protocol

As defined by [CONTACT_18121], a clinical trial is:
A research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or
more interventions (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of
those interventions on health related biomedical or behavioral outcomes.
The NIH Policy extends beyond the Food and Drug Administration Amendment Act (FDAAA 801)
requirements in that it requires registration and results reporting of:
clinical trials of behavioral, surgical and other types of health and medical interventions

Pi[INVESTIGATOR_114085].
In addition, to promote transparency of the clinical trials process, the International Committee of
Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE)  has established a policy requiring the entry of clinical trials in a
public registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov, prior to subject enrollment as a condition of consideration
for publication of the trial results.

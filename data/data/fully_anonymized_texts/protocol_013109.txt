ASSESSMENTS OF:   EFFICACY  Primary Study Endpoint The primary endpoint of this study is the time to first occurrence of any component of the composite endpoint, as adjudicated by [CONTACT_569130] (CEC). Components of the primary endpoint are: • Cardiovascular (CV) death  • Resuscitated cardiac arrest • Non-fatal MI  • Non-fatal stroke   Secondary Study Endpoints The key secondary endpoints of this study are listed below.  Time to first occurrence of:  • The composite of CV death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_569104] (with ECG abnormalities) requiring coronary revascularization • The composite of CV death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_569104] (with ECG abnormalities), or unanticipated coronary revascularization • The composite of all cause death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, non-fatal MI, or non-fatal stroke   Other secondary endpoints are listed below:  Time to first occurrence of • The composite of CV death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_569106] • The composite of CV death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_569104] (with ECG abnormalities) requiring coronary revascularization, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_569106] • The composite of all-cause death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_569106] • Fatal or non-fatal MI 
CONFIDENTIAL DAL-301 v.5- Page 6  • All-cause death  Exploratory Study Endpoints are listed below  Healthcare resource utilization information  Change from baseline for:  • Blood levels of TC, TG, LDL-C, and HDL-C • Blood levels of hsCRP  SAFETY  Safety Endpoints Safety evaluation will include the following:  • Adverse event assessments • Vital signs   An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will monitor the unblinded safety data during the study.  PROCEDURES (summary):  A table of assessment is shown below  STATISTICAL ANALYSES Sample Size: The sample size calculation is based on the primary endpoint. Under the following assumptions:   • an expected relative risk reduction of 22% and • a statistical significance defined as a two-sided alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_746154] 85% power if it continues until approximately 582 primary positively CEC adjudicated events occur in the combined treatment groups.  The total number of subjects to randomize, 6000, is chosen so that the expected number of events is approximately 582. It is based on the following assumptions, which were reviewed according to actual and planned recruitment rate:  • a 2.8-year recruitment period; • a 1% yearly lost to follow-up rate; and • a 7% event rate at 2 years following randomization in the placebo group.  Primary and Secondary Efficacy Analyses:  A stratified Cox proportional hazards model will be used to analyze the primary endpoint. Time to event will start at randomization and subjects who are lost to follow-up (while event free) will be censored at the time that they are last known to be event free. The strata will be defined by [CONTACT_561531] (Eastern Europe, Western Europe, North America, South America, and other) and the ACS index event (MI or ACS [ECG abnormalities without biomarkers]).  In order to control the Type I error that results from the multiplicity of endpoints, a closed test procedure will be used for testing the significance of the three key secondary endpoints of main interest. This will be done if the primary analysis results in significant treatment effects at p < 0.048. In that event, these three endpoints will be tested using the Hochberg’s step-up procedure again testing against a p < 0.048.  For the secondary endpoints that are expressed as time to event, an analysis similar to that for the primary endpoint will be conducted.   Exploratory Analyses:  The changes from baseline in lipid levels and hsCRP will be compared between treatment groups using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusting for baseline value and for the two stratification factors, ACS index event type and region.   
CONFIDENTIAL DAL-[ADDRESS_746155] to any potential dependence on the analysis assumptions.  Subgroup analyses may be performed in subgroups such as those defined by: [CONTACT_268050], gender, race, age, body mass index (BMI), and diabetes.  Details are provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  Interim analyses:  When approximately 70% (408) of the primary study endpoints have occurred and have been positively adjudicated, an interim analysis will be conducted by [CONTACT_569131] (DSMB).  The DSMB will determine if there is sufficient evidence of efficacy benefit to justify continuation of the trial to its completion. This futility assessment will be based on the conditional power of the trial derived under various relative risk reduction assumptions. Following this assessment, the DSMB may recommend terminating the trial.    Full details will be described in the DSMB charter and Statistical Analysis Plan.

CONFIDENTIAL DAL-301 v.5- Page 14  PART I: STUDY DESIGN AND CONDUCT 1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 1.1 Background Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a major contributor to mortality, affecting individuals of all ethnic and sociological backgrounds [1].  CHD is influenced by [CONTACT_569136], including gender, age, genetics, smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, and altered plasma lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] [2,3]. Specifically, disturbances in plasma lipoprotein profiles, including elevations of plasma total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), elevated plasma triglycerides (TG), and decreased high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), have all been linked to an increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_569111] [3-7].  Many studies have demonstrated that high serum levels of LDL-C are a major risk factor for CHD. For over two decades, large, well-controlled randomized trials have consistently documented the ability of LDL-C reduction with HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) to reduce the risk of major coronary events.  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_569112]-C levels are associated with an increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_569111] [8,9] and treatment guidelines published by [CONTACT_569137] (NCEP) expert panel suggest that HDL-C values below 40 mg/dL confer a significant risk of CHD [10].  However, most clinical trials with HDL-C elevating drugs have failed to demonstrate clinically meaningful benefit on the risk of future cardiovascular events.  Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibition has been under evaluation as a potential mechanism to raise HDL-C levels and confer cardio-protection to subjects at risk for CHD.  To date, four CETP inhibitors have been or are being evaluated in late-stage clinical trials, including torcetrapib, dalcetrapib, evacetrapib and anacetrapib.  The development of torcetrapib was halted following the observation of increased cardiovascular events and total mortality in a large outcome trial.  These effects have been associated with an off-target effect on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, and unrelated to CETP inhibition or HDL-C elevation.  Evacetrapib and anacetrapib are currently under evaluation in large Phase III cardiovascular outcomes trials.  Dalcetrapib has been extensively studied and is addressed below. 1.2 Rationale Dalcetrapib is a compound selected for its capacity to modulate plasma CETP activity and increase HDL-C levels. Detailed information on results of preclinical and clinical studies with dalcetrapib is contained in the Investigator Brochure (IB). Dalcetrapib has been evaluated in several large clinical trials, most notably dal-OUTCOMES, a 15,[ADDRESS_746163] in subjects with recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS) [11].  After subjects were followed for a median of [ADDRESS_746164] (DSMB) recommended termination of the trial for futility.  As compared with placebo, dalcetrapib did not alter the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality or total mortality despi[INVESTIGATOR_569113]-C levels (30% increase).  However, the trial demonstrated the safety and tolerability of dalcetrapib in this population.  With the hypothesis that the responses to dalcetrapib may vary according to the genetic profile, the Montreal Heart Institute has recently conducted a pharmacogenomic evaluation using a genome-wide approach in the dal-OUTCOMES study (discovery cohort, n=5749)[12].  Results demonstrated that subjects with the AA genotype at variant rs1967309 in the adenylate cyclase type 9 (ADCY9) gene experienced a 39% reduction in the risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality with dalcetrapib compared to placebo [HR=0.61; 95%CI 0.41, 0.92]. The results were confirmed through a targeted genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_569114]-PLAQUE-[ADDRESS_746165] reducing the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in a population at high risk for future events. 2. OBJECTIVES  2.1 Primary Objective The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the potential of dalcetrapib to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (cardiovascular death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, non-fatal myocardial infarction [MI] and non-fatal stroke) in subjects with a documented recent ACS and the AA genotype at variant rs1967309 in the ADCY9 gene.   2.2 Secondary Objectives Key Secondary objectives of this trial are as listed below:  
CONFIDENTIAL DAL-[ADDRESS_746166] occurrence of:  • The composite of cardiovascular (CV) death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_569104] (with electrocardiogram [ECG] abnormalities) requiring coronary revascularization • The composite of CV death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_569104] (with ECG abnormalities), or unanticipated coronary revascularization • The composite of all cause death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, non-fatal MI, or non-fatal stroke   Other Secondary objectives of this trial are as listed below: • Assessment of the long-term safety profile of dalcetrapib in this population • Evaluation of the effects of dalcetrapib on lipi[INVESTIGATOR_163311]-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) in this population • Evaluation of the effects of dalcetrapib on :  o The composite of CV death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_569106] o The composite of CV death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_569104] (with ECG abnormalities) requiring coronary revascularization, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_569106] o The composite of all-cause death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_569106] o Fatal or non-fatal MI o All-cause death 3. STUDY DESIGN  3.[ADDRESS_746167] occur within the mandated window (1-3 months after the index event). Subjects will be assessed based on their medical history.  Those who are likely to qualify will undergo centralized genetic testing to evaluate the presence of the AA genotype at variant rs 1967309 in the ADCY9 gene. The investigational cobas® ADCY9 Genotype CTA will be used for centralized testing and will support the 
CONFIDENTIAL DAL-[ADDRESS_746168] be randomized between 1 and 3 months from the index event. A total of 6,000 eligible subjects in stable condition will be randomized to 600 mg of dalcetrapib or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Subjects will receive study medication or placebo on a background of contemporary, evidence-based medical care for ACS.  This is an event driven study and approximately 582 primary events are needed to reach 85% statistical power assuming a 22% relative risk reduction in the primary endpoint. Patients will be expected to remain in the trial until the time at which approximately [ADDRESS_746169], non-fatal MI, and non-fatal stroke was selected as the primary measure of efficacy because of its clinical relevance.  3.1.2 Rationale for Dose Selection Doses of 300, 600, and 900 mg of dalcetrapib were evaluated in phase II studies. Increases in levels of HDL-C (an indicator of CETP inhibition) were observed when increasing the dose from [ADDRESS_746170] data point, which is required for statistical analysis (i.e. key safety and efficacy results for decision making), is received, whichever is the later date. 3.2 Number of Subjects/ Assignment to Treatment Groups Approximately 50,000 subjects will be screened for this study in order to identify 6000 subjects meeting the single genetic criterion and other inclusion/exclusion criteria required for randomization in this trial. Subjects will be assigned to treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by [CONTACT_11338] (Eastern Europe, Western Europe, North America, South America, and other) and ACS index event (MI or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_569104] [ECG changes without biomarkers]), to ensure equal number of subjects receiving active treatment and placebo in these strata. 3.[ADDRESS_746171] fulfill all of the inclusion criteria and not meet any of the exclusion criteria listed below.  4.1 Inclusion Criteria Subjects with the appropriate genetic profile and recently hospi[INVESTIGATOR_569109] (between 1 and 3 months following the index event) will be enrolled in this trial.

Patient HDL-C levels should not be evaluated by [CONTACT_569138], for the duration of the study.  Based on drug-drug interaction studies, there are no medications prohibited to be co-administered with dalcetrapib. In subjects receiving digoxin, plasma concentrations of digoxin should be monitored. For subjects receiving warfarin, the International normalized ratio (INR) should be checked on a regular basis to ensure that the INR is within the appropriate therapeutic target range.  The use or change in dose of any concomitant medication will be recorded on the electronic case report form (eCRF). 4.[ADDRESS_746184] the right to withdraw consent from the study at any time for any reason.  An excessive rate of premature study withdrawals can render the study un-interpretable; therefore, unnecessary study withdrawal of subjects should be avoided. Should a subject decide to withdraw consent from the study, all efforts will be made to complete and report the observations prior to study withdrawal as thoroughly as possible.    The investigator should contact [CONTACT_28246] a responsible relative either by [CONTACT_353197] a personal visit to establish as completely as possible the reason for the study withdrawal. A complete final evaluation at the time of the subject’s withdrawal from the study must be made with an explanation of why the subject is withdrawing from the study.   4.5 Criteria for Premature Study Medication Discontinuation Based on extensive experience with dalcetrapib 600 mg/day in previous Phase III trials, dalcetrapib is well tolerated.  However, if tolerability leads to considerations of study medication discontinuation, it is preferable to titrate the patient down to 300 mg/day (1 tablet per day instead of 2 tablets per day) at the investigator’s discretion rather than discontinuing study medication. Any dose changes will be recorded in the eCRF. Subjects stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_569115].  
CONFIDENTIAL DAL-[ADDRESS_746185] be made to obtain endpoint data through the duration of the trial, even if the patient discontinues study medication. 5. SCHEDULE OF ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES A detailed schedule of assessments by [CONTACT_569139] 1.  5.1 Screening Assessments and Procedures (Visit 1) All subjects must provide written informed consent before any study specific assessments or procedures are performed.  The screening assessment will consist of:  1) review of subject history to determine likely eligibility based on non-genetic inclusion and exclusion criteria; 2) written informed consent and 3) blood draw for investigational cobas® ADCY9 Genotype CTA testing for genetic assessment, conducted at a designated investigational testing lab for centralized testing. In the unlikely event that the genetic sample is deemed unanalyzable the patient would be asked to provide another genetic sample.  Subjects may undergo a blood draw for local laboratory assessments at this visit if the investigator determines it necessary to evaluate eligibility (e.g. troponin). Subjects who do not meet eligibility criteria at the screening visit based on last known laboratory values may undergo repeat testing prior to randomization.  The screening assessments of V1 may be performed at the time of the index ACS event, or any time thereafter with the condition that randomization must occur within the mandated window (1-3 months) after the ACS event. Investigators may perform the informed consent process and screening procedures in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_569116].  Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria based on the results of the investigational cobas® ADCY9 CTA genetic testing, and who meet all other inclusion and no exclusion criteria will be allowed to continue in the study and be scheduled for the randomization visit (V2).  All other subjects will be recorded as screen failures.  During the 1-3 month window between the index ACS event and randomization, subjects should receive information on a heart healthy diet (see Appendix 1) and counseling on lifestyle changes as appropriate. Contemporary evidence-based medical care for ACS, including antiplatelet agents (aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], P2Y12 blocker), statins, beta-blockers, ACE-inhibitors 
CONFIDENTIAL DAL-301 v.5- Page 24  (or angiotensin-receptor blockers), and medication for optimal control of hypertension, angina, and diabetes should be initiated as appropriate. Subjects should receive instructions on lipid-lowering medications such as statins and/or ezetimibe (ie, start lipid-lowering medication if subject is not yet receiving lipid-lowering medication, increase the dose or change to a more effective medication if subject is already on a lipid-lowering drug) in order to achieve target levels of LDL-C (at a minimum < 100 mg/dL, or < 2.6 mmol/L). 5.2 Randomization Procedures (Visit 2)  Subjects who meet all eligibility criteria will be scheduled for Visit 2, the randomization visit.  Subjects will be randomized between [ADDRESS_746186] at this visit in order to proceed with randomization.  At this visit patients will undergo all study procedures as outlined in Table 1, Schedule of Assessments, including a physical exam, collection of medical history (including smoking history), etc.   Once a subject has fulfilled all eligibility criteria, he/she will be randomized to dalcetrapib or matching placebo using an interactive web response system (IWRS).  The importance of compliance with study medication should be emphasized.    An optional blood draw for pharmacogenomics (DNA) and soluble biomarker (non-genetic) investigations may be performed on patients who volunteer to participate in this sub-study, and provide additional informed consent at this visit.  These samples will be frozen and kept for future use to evaluate biomarkers related to cardiovascular disease and the response to treatment.  5.3 Assessments and Procedures During the Double-blind Treatment Period  Subjects will visit the study clinic 1 month and 6 months after randomization and every 6 months thereafter. With the exception of the screening visit, subjects should ideally be in a fasting state (minimum of 10 hours) for all visits requiring a blood draw (Visits 2 and 5) to be submitted to the central lab.  Serum creatinine, HbA1c, fasting lipi[INVESTIGATOR_569117] [ADDRESS_746187] or fasted for less than 10 hours, the sample should still be collected and sent to the central lab for analysis and documented accordingly in the CRF. At each site visit (and phone visit) after randomization, subjects will be assessed for the occurrence of adverse events and endpoint events.  Subjects will receive a new drug supply at each visit except at visit 3 (1 month) and visit 4 (3 month phone call).  At each visit subjects will be required to bring in old unused drug for 
CONFIDENTIAL DAL-301 v.5- Page 25  assessment of compliance and the importance of compliance to study medication is to be emphasized.  All study assessments will be performed and lab samples will be collected as outlined in Table 1, Schedule of Assessments. 5.3.1 Assessments and Procedures in Response to COVID-19  During the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, in-person study visits may be replaced by [CONTACT_569140]. Communication with patients and visits may also occur by [CONTACT_569141]. Procedures that require physical contact [CONTACT_569142] (blood pressure, pulse, and weight) are to be performed whenever possible, but may be considered as optional in situations where direct physical contact [CONTACT_569134]/or staff due to the COVID-[ADDRESS_746188] limited access, the physical exam and vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, and weight) may be collected at a location other than the clinical site (i.e. a remote location, the patient’s home, etc) where possible and locally allowed.   If study visits at clinical sites are, or are expected to be significantly impacted, study medication may be dispensed within a study visit window or in advance through a secure delivery method. All study medication will be appropriately handled and tracked to ensure compliance with stability parameters.  Patients will be provided directions to save their unused study medication materials (used and unused drug supply containers) to return at their next on-site visit. Study medication may also be returned by [CONTACT_569143] a secure delivery method.  All COVID-[ADDRESS_746189] a safety follow-up phone call 14 days (+1 week window if needed) after the end of treatment visit.

That information will be provided to the investigator. 5.[ADDRESS_746191] be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of the site’s notification that the study endpoint has occurred.  As endpoints will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_569144] (CEC), endpoint classification forms will be provided as part of the eCRF. The investigator will record the event on these electronic forms and forward the supporting documentation (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_569118], autopsy reports, ECGs etc.) in a timely manner. These data will be provided to the CEC for adjudication of the event. The CEC consists of the chairman and additional qualified members.

Vital sign checks will be performed according to the schedule summarized in Table 1. 5.8.3 Physical examination and medical history Physical examinations will include examination of the following body systems: general appearance, chest/lungs, and cardiovascular. All clinically significant changes from randomization to trial completion should be reported as an AE in the source data and the eCRF. Medical history will consist of detailed information regarding the index ACS event, and risk factors for cardiovascular disease.   5.8.4 Laboratory Assessments Blood samples are to be collected at Visit 1 (screening), Visit 2 (Day 0) and Visit 5 (Month 6). Blood samples at Visits 2 and 5 are ideally to be collected in the fasting state (minimum of 10 hours without food; subjects are allowed to drink water, but no coffee or tea).

CONFIDENTIAL DAL-[ADDRESS_746196]  6.1 Dose and Schedule of Study medication and Placebo DalCor (sponsor) will supply dalcetrapib 300mg film-coated tablets and matching placebo tablets to investigators. Subjects will take 600 mg of dalcetrapib or placebo (2 tablets) once daily. Study medication should be taken with food, preferably with the largest meal of the day. Subjects should be encouraged to take the medication at approximately the same time each day.  Subjects who take study medication with breakfast should be instructed not to take study medication at home in the morning of V2 and V5 (fasting blood samples are preferred) but to wait until after collection of blood at the clinic. 6.1.[ADDRESS_746197] be maintained by [CONTACT_779]. Any temperatures exceeding 25o C should be reported to the Sponsor/designee immediately along with the following information: the minimum and maximum temperature of the excursion, duration in hours, and the medication kit numbers involved. The drug should be immediately placed at the proper temperature and quarantined (not dispensed to subjects) until notification from the Sponsor is received that the drug is acceptable to use or must be destroyed/returned.  Likewise, subjects should be informed that study medication must be stored at 25o C or below.

No. of Tablets Dose Group 300 mg dalcetrapib tablet Placebo 600 mg of dalcetrapib 2 0 Placebo 0 2  Please note that placebo tablets contain lactose (435 mg/tablet) and may lead to problems in subjects with severe lactose intolerance.  Each site will receive a supply of individually labeled double-blind study medication kits. Each kit will be labeled with a label including dosing instructions, the visit number and the subject number to be added by [CONTACT_8786]. 6.3 Randomization Subjects will be randomized to dalcetrapib 600 mg or placebo in a 1:1 ratio stratified by [CONTACT_569145] (MI or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_569104] [ECG Abnormalities without Biomarkers], see sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2), according to a computer-generated global randomization code. The subject randomization numbers will be allocated sequentially in the order in which the subjects are enrolled. Investigators are to use the IWRS to obtain randomization numbers for subjects they randomize in the study.  The Master Randomization List will be kept in a central repository at the Coordinating Center with access to the unblinded statistician only.

The dispensing logs must be returned to DalCor or DalCor designee at the end of the study. 6.6 Destruction of Study Medication Each site will be instructed by [CONTACT_569148]/destruction for their site. 7.  SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS AND GUIDANCE 7.1 Adverse Events (AEs) and Laboratory Abnormalities 7.1.1 Clinical AEs Per the International Conference of Harmonization [ICH], an AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign [including an abnormal laboratory finding], symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal [investigational] product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal [investigational] product. Pre-existing conditions which worsen during a study are to be reported as AEs. 
CONFIDENTIAL DAL-301 v.5- Page 33  [IP_ADDRESS]  Intensity All clinical AEs encountered during the clinical study will be reported on the AE page of the eCRF. Intensity of AEs will be graded on a four-point scale [mild, moderate, severe, life-threatening] and reported in detail on the eCRF.  Mild    discomfort noticed but no disruption of normal daily activity.  Moderate   discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect daily activity. Severe    inability to work or perform normal daily activity Life-Threatening represents an immediate threat to life [IP_ADDRESS]  Drug - Adverse Event Relationship Relationship of the AE to the treatment should always be assessed by [CONTACT_569149] .  The following criteria should be considered in order to assess the relationship:  • reasonable temporal association with administration of the study drug • existence of alternative causes that could on their own have caused the reaction, like the subject’s medical condition • known pattern of response to the suspected drug • de- and rechallenge information [IP_ADDRESS]  Serious Adverse Events A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any AE that at any dose fulfills at least one of the following criteria: – is fatal; [results in death; NOTE: death is an outcome, not an event] – is life-threatening [NOTE: the term "Life-Threatening" refers to an event in which the subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which could hypothetically have caused a death had it been more severe]. – required in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]*; – results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; – is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; –  is medically significant or requires intervention to prevent one or other of the outcomes listed above. * NOTE: Any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_569120].

Thus, the following events will not be reported as SAEs unless negatively adjudicated and considered study medication related by [CONTACT_093]:   Cardiovascular (CV) death  Resuscitated cardiac arrest Non-fatal MI  Non-fatal stroke  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_569121] (with ECG abnormalities) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_569104] (with ECG abnormalities) requiring coronary revascularization Unanticipated coronary revascularization Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_569122]-cause death  These events will be reported on the appropriate eCRF pages for the collection of information on endpoint events and forwarded to the CEC. 7.1.[ADDRESS_746200] returned to the normal range or baseline and/or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is found. If a clear explanation is established it should be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF. 7.[ADDRESS_746201] value that is serious [as defined in section [IP_ADDRESS] above] and which occurs during the course of the study must be reported to the sponsor within [ADDRESS_746202] also be reported to the investigator. 7.3 Warnings and Precautions No evidence available at the time of the approval of this study protocol indicated that special warnings or precautions were appropriate, other than those noted in the Investigators’ Brochure. 
CONFIDENTIAL DAL-[ADDRESS_746203] occurrence of any component of the composite endpoint as adjudicated by [CONTACT_15741]. Components of the primary endpoint are:  •  Cardiovascular death • Resuscitated cardiac arrest • Non-fatal MI • Non-fatal stroke 8.1.[ADDRESS_746204] occurrence of:  • The composite of CV death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_569104] (with ECG abnormalities) requiring coronary revascularization • The composite of CV death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_569104] (with ECG abnormalities), or unanticipated coronary revascularization • The composite of all cause death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, non-fatal MI, or non-fatal stroke   Other secondary endpoints are listed below:  Time to first occurrence of • The composite of CV death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_569106] • The composite of CV death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_569104] (with ECG abnormalities) requiring coronary revascularization, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_569106] • The composite of all-cause death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_569106] • Fatal or non-fatal MI • All-cause death  Exploratory endpoints are listed below 
CONFIDENTIAL DAL-301 v.5- Page 37  Healthcare resource utilization information Change from baseline for:  • Blood levels of TC, TG, LDL-C, and HDL-C • Blood levels of hsCRP 8.1.3 Safety Safety of the treatment will be evaluated by [CONTACT_569151].  8.2 Statistical and Analytical Methods 8.2.1 Sample Size The sample size calculation is based on the primary endpoint. Under the following assumptions:   • an expected relative risk reduction of 22% and • a statistical significance defined as a two-sided alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_746205] 85% power if it continues until at least [ADDRESS_746206] approximately 582. It is based on the following assumptions, which were reviewed according to actual and planned recruitment rate:  • a 2.8-year recruitment period; • a 1% yearly lost to follow-up rate; and • a 7% event rate at 2 years following randomization in the placebo group.  Sample size was calculated using nQuery, version 7.0. 8.2.2  Analysis Populations [IP_ADDRESS]  Exclusion of Data from Analysis Subjects will be completely excluded from analyses if they do not satisfy the criteria for inclusion in the specified analysis population, as defined below. If a subject satisfies the criteria for inclusion in an analysis population then no data from that subject will be excluded from use. [IP_ADDRESS]  Intent to Treat (ITT) Population All subjects randomized will be included in the ITT population.  
CONFIDENTIAL DAL-301 v.5- Page 38  [IP_ADDRESS]  Per-Protocol Population A per-protocol population is defined as patients who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria, are determined to be at least 80% compliant to study medication, and have completed the study with no premature study or medication discontinuation. This population will be used only in the context of exploratory analysis as described in section [IP_ADDRESS]. [IP_ADDRESS]  Safety Analysis Population All subjects who received at least one dose of treatment will be included in the safety analysis population. Subjects will be assigned according to the true treatment received for analysis purposes. [IP_ADDRESS]  Co-Diagnostic Analysis: Intent-to-Diagnose (ITD) Patients who provide written informed consent and have blood drawn for screening will be tested for RS1967309 of ADCY9 by [CONTACT_267515]® ADCY9 Genotype CTA. Patients with AA genotype results will be allowed to proceed in the study and be further evaluated for eligibility into the study treatment phase and patients with non-AA genotype will be excluded from the study; however, demographic data for both the AA and non-AA groups will be recorded for evaluation of the cobas® ADCY9 Genotype CTA as a companion diagnostic for dalcetrapib. Patients who have a biologic sample obtained after Informed Consent are part of the Intent-to-Diagnose population.  8.2.3 Efficacy Analysis [IP_ADDRESS]  Primary Analysis A stratified Cox proportional hazards model will be used to analyze the primary endpoint. Time to event will start at randomization and subjects who are lost to follow-up (while event free) will be censored at the time that they are last known to be event free. The strata will be defined by [CONTACT_11338] (Eastern Europe, Western Europe, North America, South America, and other) and the ACS index event (MI or ACS [ECG abnormalities without biomarkers], see sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2).  The null and alternative hypotheses to be tested with the above Cox model are:  H0: λ = 1 vs. HA: λ ≠ [ADDRESS_746207] ratio will be presented with a 95.2% confidence interval (CI) and a p-value.   The primary analysis will be based on the ITT population and conducted at the 0.048 significance level to account for interim assessments of efficacy as outlined in section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
CONFIDENTIAL DAL-301 v.5- Page 39    [IP_ADDRESS]  Secondary and Exploratory Analysis For the secondary endpoints that are expressed as time to event, an analysis similar to that for the primary endpoint will be conducted.  The changes from baseline in TC, TG, LDL-C, HDL-C and hsCRP levels will be compared between treatment groups using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusting for baseline value and for the two stratification factors, ACS index event type and region. Specifically, the null and alternative hypotheses to be tested are:  H0: Dplacebo = Ddalcetrapib vs.  HA: Dplacebo ≠ Ddalcetrapib where Dplacebo is the change in the placebo group and Ddalcetrapib is the change in the dalcetrapib group. Estimates of treatment effect will be presented with 95% CI and p-values.   Secondary and exploratory analyses will be conducted on the ITT population. In order to control the Type I error that results from the multiplicity of endpoints, the key secondary endpoints will be formally tested using the Hochberg’s step-up procedure only if the primary analysis results in significant treatment effect at p < 0.048.  Otherwise, statistical tests for the secondary endpoints will be presented solely for illustrative purposes. [IP_ADDRESS]  Sub-population Analyses For illustrative purposes, the following factors: • Geographic location • Age • Gender • Race • BMI • Diabetes  may be used to define subgroups of subjects within which the primary and selected secondary efficacy endpoints will be evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models similar to the ones described in section [IP_ADDRESS], adding to the models a term for the factor defining the subgroup and a term for the interaction between the factor and the treatment group. This interaction term will be tested at the 0.[ADDRESS_746208] will be estimated and presented with 95% 
CONFIDENTIAL DAL-301 v.5- Page 40  confidence intervals within subgroups.  The sub-population analyses would be conducted on the ITT population.  [IP_ADDRESS]  Interim Analysis  When approximately 70% (408) of the primary study endpoints have occurred and been positively adjudicated, an interim analysis will be conducted by [CONTACT_569131] (DSMB).  The DSMB will determine if there is sufficient evidence of efficacy benefit to justify continuation of the trial to its completion. This futility assessment will be based on the conditional power of the trial derived under various relative risk reduction assumptions. Following this assessment, the DSMB may recommend terminating the trial.    Full details will be described in the DSMB charter and Statistical Analysis Plan. 8.2.4 Exploratory Analyses [IP_ADDRESS]  Effect of Prognostic Factors In order to characterize any potential treatment effect more precisely, an analysis of the primary endpoint will be conducted with the hazard ratio assumed to depend on, in addition to treatment, the following potentially prognostic factors:  • Baseline HDL-C  • Baseline LDL-C  • Baseline TG  • Baseline TC •  Gender •  Age   A factor will be identified as prognostic if the corresponding model term is associated with a p-value of less than 0.[ADDRESS_746209] that adjusts for factors that are likely to influence the primary endpoint. This will be done on the ITT population.  [IP_ADDRESS]  Effect of Lipid Changes and Changes in hsCRP while on Treatment In order to evaluate risk reduction as it relates to changes or actual values in lipi[INVESTIGATOR_569123], additional exploratory analyses will be 
CONFIDENTIAL DAL-301 v.5- Page 41  conducted on the primary endpoint. These will include, but will not necessarily be limited to, analyses that:  • include changes or actual values in lipi[INVESTIGATOR_569124]-dependent covariates in proportional hazard regression models  • take a subset of subjects who are event free at 6 months and use the change from baseline in lipi[INVESTIGATOR_301346] (or actual values) at that time as fixed covariates in a regression analysis of subsequent events.  In all analyses, randomized treatment will be both included and excluded as a factor in the regression models in order to evaluate if there are additional effects of treatment beyond those that are attributable to changes in lipid levels. These analyses would be conducted on the ITT population. [IP_ADDRESS]  Sensitivity Analyses If a statistically significant treatment effect is demonstrated in the analysis of the primary endpoint, the robustness of the results will be evaluated with respect to their potential dependence on the assumptions made.  In particular, the effect of censoring subjects who are lost to follow-up (while event free) will be evaluated by [CONTACT_569152]. Various imputation rules will be applied and will be established prior to database closure and the breaking of the blind. The sensitivity of the primary analysis to treatments or procedures that would be expected to affect the primary endpoint will be assessed by [CONTACT_569153].  The consistency of treatment effect across the ACS index event strata and across regions will be tested using a term of treatment by [CONTACT_569154]. Interaction will be considered significant if p < 0.[ADDRESS_746210] or concern; in these instances, more extensive exploratory statistical analyses may be performed. The scope of the analyses cannot be determined a priori; but would be expected to include standard regression methods for estimating relative risks such as odds and hazard ratios. [IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Events Treatments will be examined with respect to the incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events leading to premature study withdrawal or dose modifications.   Summary statistics will be presented for all treatment-emergent events and, in addition, by [CONTACT_569155]. In the latter instances, for subjects experiencing repeated epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], only the most severe epi[INVESTIGATOR_569125]. Summary statistics will include number and incidence of events where incidence of an event within a treatment group will be determined as the simple proportion of subjects in the group experiencing the event.   Adverse events will be grouped and summarized by [CONTACT_569156] (MedDRA), following classification of investigator assessments into MedDRA preferred terms.   [IP_ADDRESS]  Laboratory Data Any clinically significant changes in laboratory data will be reported as an adverse event and will be included in the adverse event safety analyses.   [IP_ADDRESS]  Vital Signs Any clinically significant changes in vital signs will be reported as an adverse event and will be included in the adverse event safety analyses.   9. DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE Data for this study will be recorded via an Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system using electronic Case Report Forms. The eCRF can be used as the source document if the eCRF is the original place of data entry, per the FDA Guidance. Accurate and reliable data collection will be assured by [CONTACT_89836]-check of the eCRFs against the Investigator’s records by [CONTACT_11200] (source document verification), and the maintenance of a drug–dispensing log by [CONTACT_737]. A comprehensive validation check program will be defined and outlined in the Edit Checks Specifications as a part of the Data Management Plan. Throughout the study the Study Management Team will review data according to the Data Management Plan. 
CONFIDENTIAL DAL-301 v.5- Page 43  9.1 Assignment of Preferred Terms to Original Terminology For classification purposes, preferred terms will be assigned by [CONTACT_569157], reviewed by [CONTACT_1689]/DalCor Chief Medical Officer based on the original terms entered on the eCRF, using the latest version of the MedDRA for adverse events and diseases, and WhoDRUG  for medications. 10.

CONFIDENTIAL DAL-301 v.5- Page 45  PART II: ETHICS AND GENERAL STUDY ADMINISTRATION 12. ETHICAL ASPECTS 12.1 Local Regulations/Declaration of Helsinki The investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in full conformance with the principles of the “Declaration of Helsinki” or with the laws and regulations of the country in which the research is conducted, whichever affords the greater protection to the individual. The study must fully adhere to the principles outlined in “Guideline for Good Clinical Practice” ICH Tripartite Guideline [January 1997] or with local law if it affords greater protection to the subject. For studies conducted in the European Union (EU)/ European Economic Area (EEA) countries, the investigator will ensure compliance with the EU Clinical Trial Directive [2001/20/EC]. For studies conducted in the [LOCATION_003] or under US IND, the investigator will additionally ensure that the basic principles of “Good Clinical Practice” as outlined in the current version of 21 CFR, subchapter D, part 312, “Responsibilities of Sponsors and Investigators”, part 50, “Protection of Human Subjects”, and part 56, “Institutional Review Boards”, are adhered to.  In other countries where “Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice” exist DalCor and the investigators will strictly ensure adherence to the stated provisions. 12.2 Informed Consent It is the responsibility of the investigator, or a person designated by [CONTACT_093] [if acceptable by [CONTACT_427]], to obtain written informed consent from each subject participating in this study, after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the study. The investigator or designee must also explain that the subjects are completely free to refuse to enter the study or to withdraw from it at any time, for any reason. The electronic Case Report Forms [eCRFs] for this study contain a section for documenting informed subject consent, and this must be completed appropriately. If new safety information results in significant changes in the risk/benefit assessment, the consent form should be reviewed and updated if necessary. All subjects [including those already being treated] should be informed of the new information, given a copy of the revised form and give their consent to continue in the study. An optional informed consent will be provided at randomization for additional future genetic and non-genetic testing to explore the relationship between treatment response and genetic/non-genetic determinants. 12.3 Independent Ethics Committees/Institutional Review Board Independent Ethics Committees [non-US]: This protocol and any accompanying material provided to the subject [such as subject information sheets or descriptions of the study 
CONFIDENTIAL DAL-301 v.5- Page 46  used to obtain informed consent] as well as any advertising or compensation given to the subject, will be submitted by [CONTACT_569158].  Approval from the committee must be obtained before starting the study, and should be documented in a letter to the investigator specifying the date on which the committee met and granted the approval.  Any modifications made to the protocol after receipt of the Independent Ethics Committee approval must also be submitted by [CONTACT_569159].  When no local review board exists, the investigator is expected to submit the protocol to a regional committee.   Institutional Review Board [US]: It is the understanding of the sponsor that this protocol [and any modifications] as well as appropriate consent procedures, will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_3551]. This board must operate in accordance with the current Federal Regulations. A letter or certificate of approval will be sent by [CONTACT_569160], and also whenever subsequent modifications to the protocol are made. 13. CONDITIONS FOR MODIFYING THE PROTOCOL Protocol modifications to ongoing studies must be made only after consultation between an appropriate representative of the sponsor and the investigator [investigator representative[s] in the case of a multicenter trial]. Protocol modifications must be prepared by a representative of the sponsor and initially reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_526973].  All protocol modifications must be submitted to the appropriate Independent Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board for information and approval in accordance with local requirements, and to Regulatory Agencies if required. Approval must be awaited before any changes can be implemented, except for changes necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to trial subjects, or when the change[s] involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the trial [e.g. change in monitor[s], change of telephone number[s]. 
CONFIDENTIAL DAL-[ADDRESS_746213]’s interests.  15. STUDY DOCUMENTATION, ECRFS AND RECORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]  15.1 Investigator's Files / Retention of Documents The Investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the study to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified. These documents should be classified into two different separate categories [1] Investigator's Study File, and [2] subject clinical source documents.  The Investigator's Study File will contain the protocol/amendments, Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board and governmental approval with correspondence, sample informed consent, drug records, staff curriculum vitae and authorization forms and other appropriate documents/correspondence etc.  Subject clinical source documents [usually defined by [CONTACT_239227]/safety parameters independent of the eCRFs] would include subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic records, physician's and nurse's notes, appointment book, original laboratory reports, ECG, electroencephalogram (EEG), X-ray, pathology and special assessment reports, signed informed consent forms, consultant letters, and subject screening and enrollment logs. The Investigator must keep these two categories of documents on file for at least [ADDRESS_746214] be made between the Investigator and DalCor to store these in a sealed container[s] outside of the site so that they can be returned sealed to the Investigator in case of a regulatory audit. Where source documents are required for the continued care of the subject, appropriate copi[INVESTIGATOR_231654]. 
CONFIDENTIAL DAL-[ADDRESS_746215] with any required background data from the study documentation or clinic records. This is particularly important when errors in data transcription are suspected. In case of special problems and/or governmental queries or requests for audit inspections, it is also necessary to have access to the complete study records, provided that subject confidentiality is protected. 15.[ADDRESS_746216] is withdrawn from the study because of a treatment-limiting AE, thorough efforts should be made to clearly document the outcome. Data from subjects enrolled and screened, but who do not get randomized (screen failures) will not be collected in the eCRF.  However, some information such as demographic data, ACS event type, ACS event date, will be collected in the IWRS system for all screened patients.   The investigator should ensure the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported to the sponsor in the eCRFs and in all required reports. 16. MONITORING THE STUDY It is understood that the responsible DalCor monitor [or designee] will contact [CONTACT_231690], on request, to inspect the various records of the trial [eCRFs and other pertinent data] provided that subject confidentiality is maintained in accord with local requirements.  It will be the monitor's responsibility to inspect the eCRFs at regular intervals throughout the study, to verify the adherence to the protocol and the completeness, consistency and accuracy of the data being entered on them. The monitor should have access to laboratory test reports, study medication and other subject records needed to verify the entries on the eCRF. The investigator [or his/her deputy] agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved.  
CONFIDENTIAL DAL-[ADDRESS_746217] assure that subjects’ anonymity will be maintained and that their identities are protected from unauthorized parties. On eCRFs or other documents submitted to the sponsor, subjects should not be identified by [CONTACT_2249], but by [CONTACT_1209]. The investigator should keep a subject enrollment log showing codes, names and addresses. The investigator should maintain documents not for submission to DalCor, e.g., subjects’ written consent forms, in strict confidence. 18. PUBLICATION OF DATA AND PROTECTION OF TRADE SECRETS The results of this study may be published or presented at scientific meetings. If this is foreseen, the investigator agrees to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to DalCor prior to submission. This allows the sponsor to protect proprietary information and to provide comments based on information from other studies that may not yet be available to the investigator.  In accord with standard editorial and ethical practice, DalCor will generally support publication of multicenter trials only in their entirety and not as individual center data. In this case, a coordinating investigator [INVESTIGATOR_12992].  Any formal publication of the study in which input of DalCor personnel exceeded that of conventional monitoring will be considered as a joint publication by [CONTACT_569161]. Authorship will be determined by [CONTACT_11402].   
CONFIDENTIAL DAL-301 v.5- Page 50  Appendix 1 Study Recommended Diet and Principles   TLC Diet – A diet for high cholesterol heart disease recommended by [CONTACT_569162] 2001 when the National Cholesterol Education Progream (NCEP) released new diet guidelines for people with high cholesterol and risks of hear disease.  The American Heart Association (AHA) accepted and endorsed this report and began incorporating these recommendations into its materials on dietary and lifestyle change for people with high blood cholesterol.  For people at high risk or who hav known cardiovascular disease, NCEP and AHA now recommend the new Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) diet to replace the “old” Step 1 and Step 2 diets.  Summary of the TLC Diet for High Cholesterol  • Saturated fat: Less than 7% of total calories • Polyunsaturated fat: Up to 10% of total calories • Monounsaturated fat: Up to 20% of total calories • Carbohydrate: 50% to 60% of total calories • Soluble fiber: At least 5 to 10 grams a day • Protein: Approximately 15% of total calories • Cholesterol: Less than 200 mg a day • Total calories: Balance calories taken in and calories burned to reach and stay at a healthy weight.  For a detailed customized TLC diet plan, please consult with your Registered Dietitian.

These situations should also usually be considered serious.  Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  An unexpected AE is one, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable product information. Causality is initially assessed by [CONTACT_093]. For Serious Adverse Events, possible causes of the event are indicated by [CONTACT_569163]. (Check all that apply) – Pre-existing/Underlying disease – specify   – Study treatment – specify the drug(s) related to the event

For example, nausea of several hours' duration may be rated as severe, but may not be clinically serious.  A serious adverse event occurring during the study or which comes to the attention of the investigator within [ADDRESS_746219] “drug”.  Such preliminary reports will be followed by [CONTACT_569164][INVESTIGATOR_3103], autopsy reports and other documents when requested and applicable.  For serious adverse events, the following must be assessed and recorded on the AEs page of the eCRF: intensity, relationship to test substance, action taken, and outcome to date.  The investigator must notify the Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board of a serious adverse event in writing as soon as is practical and in accordance with international and local laws and regulations.

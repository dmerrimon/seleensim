Placebo in Subjects w ith Active Psoriatic Arthritis Who Have a History of Inadequate Response to at 
Least One Biologic Disease Modifying Anti -Rheumatic Drug (bDMARD) –SELECT –PsA 2
Objective s:  
Period 1
1. To compare the efficacy of upadacitinib 15 mg once daily (QD) and 30 mg QD versus placebo for 
the treatment of signs and symptoms in subjects with moderately to severely active Psoriatic 
Arthritis (PsA) who have an inadequate response to bDMARDs (Bio -IR).
2. To compare the safety and tolerabili ty of upadacitinib [ADDRESS_895717] completed Period 1.
Investigators:   Multicenter
Study Site s:  Approximately 165 sites
Study Population:   Patients with active PsA despi[INVESTIGATOR_663479].
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately 630
Methodology:   
This is a Phase 3 multicenter study that includes tw o periods.  Period 1 is 56 -weeks in duration and 
includes a 24 -week randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, placebo -controlled period follow ed by  [CONTACT_102160] 32 w eeks of blinded treatment (Weeks 24 –56).  Period [ADDRESS_895718] an inadequate response to bDMARDs (Bio -IR).  Period 2 is 
an open -label (blinded until the last subject completes the last visit of Period 1), long -term extension of 
up to a total treatment duration of approximately [ADDRESS_895719] completed Period 1.
The study is designed to enroll approximately 630 subjects at approximately 165 study centers 
worldwide to meet scientific and regulatory objectives without enrolling an undue numbe r of subjects in 
alignment with ethical considerations.  
The study duration will include a 35 -day screening period; a 56 -week blinded period w hich includes 
24weeks of double -blind, placebo -controlled treatment follow ed by  32 w eeks of treatment blinded to
the dose of upadacitinib (Period 1); a long -term extension period of up to a total treatment duration of 
approximately 3 years ([blinded until the last subject completes the last visit of Period 1] Period 2); and a 
30-day follow -up call or visit.

Methodology (Continued):
Subjects who meet eligibility criteria w ill be stratified by [CONTACT_620916] ( ≥ 3% body surface area 
[BSA] or < 3% BSA), current use of at least [ADDRESS_895721], and number of prior failed (had an inadequate 
response to) biologic DMARDs (1 vs>1), except for subjects from Japan, for which randomization will 
be stratified by [CONTACT_620916] ( ≥ 3% body surface area [BSA] or < 3% BSA) only, and then will be 
randomized in a 2:2:1:1 ratio to one of four treatment groups:
Group 1:  upada citinib 15 mg QD (N = 210) 
Group 2:  upadacitinib 30 mg QD (N = 210) 
Group 3:  Placebo follow ed by [CONTACT_620917] 15 mg QD (N = 105)
Group 4:  Placebo follow ed by [CONTACT_620917] 30 mg QD (N = 105)
No m ore than approximately 40% of subjects will be enrolled with < 3% BSA extent of psoriasis and no 
more than approximately 30% of subjects will be enrolled with prior failure of more than [ADDRESS_895722].
Subjects will receive oral study drug QD (u padacitinib 15 mg, u padacitinib 30 mg, or matching placebo) 
until the end of the study or they discontinue study drug.
Subjects who were assigned to placebo at baseline will be preassigned to receiving either u padacitinib
15mg QD or u padacitinib 30 mg QD starting at Week 24 in a 1:1 ratio.  Subjects w ho complete the 
Week56 visit (end of Period 1) w ill enter the long -term extension portion of the study, Period 2 (total 
study duration up to approximately 3 years).  Subjects will continue study treatment as assigned in 
Period 1.  Subjects w ill continue to receive u padacit inib15 mg QD or u padacitinib [ADDRESS_895723] visit of Period 1 (Week 56), 
when study drug assignment in both periods w ill be unblinded to the sites, and subjects w ill be dispensed 
study drug in an open -label fashion until the completion of Period 2.
Subjects must have had inadequate response to ≥ [ADDRESS_895724] 
therapy at baseline (methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine (SSZ), leflunomide (LEF), apremilast, 
hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), bucillamine or iguratimod), no n-biologic DMARDs should have been 
started ≥ [ADDRESS_895725] be at stable dose for ≥ 4weeks prior to the first dose 
of study drug and remain at stable dose through Week 36 of the study; the non -biologic DMARD dose 
may be decreas ed only for safety reasons.  In addition, all subjects taking MTX should take a dietary 
supplement of oral folic acid (or equivalent) throughout study participation.  Folic acid dosing and 
timing of regimen should be follow ed according to the Investigator' s instructions.  Please refer to 
Sections [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS] for additional details related to prior and concomitant DMARD therapy, 
respectively.  Starting at the Week 36 visit (after Week [ADDRESS_895726] been performed), initiation 
of or change in background PsA medication(s) including corticosteroids, non -steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen/paracetamol, low  potency opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], and non -biologic 
DMARDs (concomitant use of up to 2 non -biologic DMARDs except the combination of MTX and 
leflunomide), is allowed as per local label with maximum doses as outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS].
At Week 16, subjects classified as non -responders (defined as not achieving at least 20% improvement 
in either or both tender joint count (TJC) and sw ollen joint count (SJC) at both Week 12 and Week 16) 
will add or modify background therapy for PsA.  
At Week 24, all subjects allocated to placebo at Baseline w ill be sw itched to blinded upadacitinib
(randomized at baseline to either 15 mg QD or 30 mg QD) treatment regardless of clinical response.

3.0 Introduction
Psoriatic Arthritis
Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) is a chronic s ystemic inflammatory  disease classified as a 
sub-type of spondy loarthritis (SpA) and characterized by  [CONTACT_663496].  PsA can develop at an y time, but for most people it appears between the ages of 
[ADDRESS_895755] patients, skin manifestations predate the arthritis.1
Patients with PsA experience vary ing combinations of disease manifestations affecting the 
synovium, tendons, entheses, skin, and bone.  These manifestations of disease range in 
prevalence with peripheral arthritis and variable degrees of psoriasis observed in all 
patients at some point during their disease course, axial disease in 40 –74% depending on 
the criteria used for diagnosis,3enthesitis in 25 –51%, dact ylitis in 8 –59%4-6and 
anterior uveitis in 2 –25%.[ADDRESS_895756] decreased qualit y 
of life and functional impairment.10,11
The prevalence of PsA varies b y region and has been reported as 0.13% in North 
America, 0.07% in South America, 0.19% in Europe, 0.01 –0.07% in Africa, the Middle 
East, and Asia.[ADDRESS_895757] 2016 -004152 -30

(NSAIDs) and local corticosteroid injections, while topi[INVESTIGATOR_620885].  For patients who experience lack of efficacy or toxicity  with 
these measures, for the treatment of peripheral arthritis, both the European League 
Against Rheumatism (EULAR)13and Group for Research a nd Assessment of Psoriasis 
and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA)14recommend systemic therapy with conventional 
disease modify ing anti -rheumatic drugs (cDMARDs) (methotrexate [MTX], leflunomide 
[LEF], sulfasalazine [SSZ], or ciclosporin A), followed b y anti -tumor necrosis factor 
(TNF) therap y in patients who do not respo nd adequately  to cDMARDs.  Other biologic 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (e.g., IL -12/23 or IL -17 inhibitors) are also recommended as alternatives to anti-
TNF inhibitors in selected PsA patients.  Additional specific recommendations differ 
slightly  between EULAR and GRAPPA, ho wever recommendations for therapeutic 
choice are made based on a patient's clinical presentation as some manifestations of PsA, 
such as enthesitis, dact ylitis, and axial disease are either not responsive or poorly  
responsive to cDMARDs.  Additional therape utic options are also recommended 
specificall y for treatment of skin disease.13,14
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_663480], 
approximately  40% of patients do not h ave at least 20% improvement in American 
College of Rheumatology (ACR) scores13,15
-21and only  58%22to 61%23of patients with 
PsA who receive them are able to achieve clinical remission after 1 year of treatment, 
with only  approximately  43% achievin g sustained remission for at least 1 year.24  Thus, 
there remains a clear medical need for additional therapeutic options in PsA for patients 
with inadequate response to or intolerance to currently  available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
Targeting the Janus kinase (JAK) signaling pathway for autoimmune diseases, such as 
PsA, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis (UC), and atopic 
dermatitis, is supported by [CONTACT_110976] -inflammatory  cytokines that 
signal via JAK pathways in the pathogenesis of these immune -related disorders.  The 
activation of JAK signaling initiates expression of survival factors, cy tokines, 
chemokines, and other molecules that facilitate leukocyte cellular trafficking and cell 
proliferation, which contribute to inflammatory and autoimmune disorders.25,[ADDRESS_895758] 2016 -004152 -30
27
The JAK family  is composed of 4 members:  JAK1, 2, 3, and ty rosine kinase 2 (Ty k2).  
These cy toplasmic t yrosine kinases act in tandem to activate the Signal Transducer and 
Activator of Transcription (STAT) that transduce cy tokine -mediated signals, and are 
associated with multiple membrane cy tokine receptors such as common gamma -chain 
(CGC) receptors and the gl ycoprotein 130 trans -membrane proteins.27  JAK3 and JAK1 
are components of the CGC cy tokine receptor complexes that are responsible for the 
signaling of the inflammatory  cytokines IL -2, -4, -7, -9, -15 and -21; whereas IL -[ADDRESS_895759] mechanism of PsA has not 
been full y elucidated, multiple cytokines such as IL -1, -6, 
-12, -17, -20, and -23 are 
thought to be involved in the activation and proliferation of epi[INVESTIGATOR_663481].29  The IL 17/IL- 23 cy tokine axis is also thought to be important in PsA 
pathogenesis.30  Thus, blockade of either JAK1 or Tyk2 could inhibit the response of 
central cy tokine signals thought to be important in the pathogene sis of PsA.
Tofacitinib is an oral JAK inhibitor that inhibits JAK1, JAK2, and JAK3 with high 
invitro functional specificity  for kinases 1 and 3.  Tofacitinib is currentl y in Phase 3 
development in PsA.  The Phase 3 studies evaluated the efficacy and safe ty of tofacitinib 
5 mg and 10 mg twice daily  (BID) in adult patients with active PsA who had an 
inadequate response to at least one conventional synthetic DMARD (csDMARD) and 
who were TNF inhibitor -naïve (OPAL Broaden) or who had an inadequate response to at 
least 1 TNF inhibitor (OPAL  Beyond).  Both studies achieved the primary endpoints of 
ACR20 and change in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ DI) 
versus placebo for both the 5 mg BID and 10 mg BID doses at Month 3.  Data reported 
from O
PAL Broaden indicate ACR20 response at Month 3 for placebo, tofacitinib 5 mg 
BID, tofacitinib 10 mg BID, and adalimumab 40 mg EOW of 33.3%, 50.5%, 60.6%, and 
51.9%, respectively ; p-value versus placebo for each active therap y was ≤ 0.05.  At 
Month 3, stati stically  significant results in favor of tofacitinib over placebo for both dose 
groups were also observed for ACR50/70 responses, and PASI 75 response.  Superiority  of 
tofactinib versus placebo was seen in the Leeds Enthesitis I ndex (LEI), and Dact ylitis 
Severity  Score (DSS) at the [ADDRESS_895760] 2016 -004152 -30
28
secondary  efficacy  endpoints were maintained to Month 12.  No radiographic data were 
reported at Month 3 (end of double -blind period); however at Month 12 little radiographic 
progression was observed in any  dose group.31  OPAL  Beyond results for ACR20 
response at Month 3 f or placebo, tofacitinib 5 mg BID, and tofacitinib 10 mg BID were 
23.7%, 49.6%, and 47.0%, respectively; p -value versus placebo for each active therap y 
was ≤ 0.0001.  At Month 3 statistically  superior results in favor of tofacitinib at both 
doses versus pla cebo for ACR50, L EI, and DSS were also observed with superiority  over 
placebo for PASI 75 demonstrated only  at the 10 mg BID dose while ACR70 response was 
not significantl y different from placebo for either dose group.32  The observed safet y 
findings for both studies were consistent with those observed in the RA and psoriasis 
development programs.  In relat ed diseases (RA,1psoriasis,33and anky losing 
spondy litis34), tofacitinib has demonstrated an impact on signs and s ymptoms, as

Upadacitinib Clinical Development
To date, single and multiple doses of u padacitinib have been studied in healthy  volunteers 
in 10 Phase 1 studies (one of which also employed a substudy  in subjects with mild to 
moderate RA), which have completed stud y conduct.  I n addition, upadacitinib has been 
studied in 4 Phase 2 trials in subjects wit h RA or Crohn's disease.  Two of these Phase [ADDRESS_895762]:  2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in 
575subjects with moderately to severely active RA on background MTX 
(Studies M13- 550 and M13 -537).  One open- label extension to t he completed RA studies 
(Study  M13 -538) and [ADDRESS_895763] 2016 -004152 -30
29
(Study M13- 740) in subjects with moderatel y to severel y active Crohn's disease with a 
history  of inadequate response to or intolerance to anti -TNF therap y are ongoing.  The RA 
Phase [ADDRESS_895764] been performed with upadacitinib .  Results 
from the Phase 2 randomized controlled studies in subjects with RA are available.  
Efficacy  of treatment with upadacitinib in patients with moderate to severe RA was 
demonstrated in both Phase 2 Studies M13 -550 and M13 -537.  Results from both studies 
demonstrated dose -and exposure -dependent improvement in clinical signs and symptoms 
as measured b y the ACR20/50/70 response criteria.
The Phase 2 program for upadacitinib in subjects with moderatel y to severely active RA 
consisted of 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), both on stable background 
methotrexate (MTX) therapy , and one open -label extension (OL E) stud y (Study  M13 -538; 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) for those subjects who had completed either one of the RCTs.  
Study M13 -550 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) enrolled subjects who had an inad equate response to 
anti-TNF therap y and Study  M13 -537 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) enrolled subjects who had shown 
an inadequate response to MTX.  A total of 4 twice dail y (BID) and 1 once daily (QD) 
dose regimens of u padacitinib immediate release capsules (3 mg BID, 6 m g BID, 12 mg 
BID, 18 mg BID, and 24 mg QD) were evaluated.
In TNF -inadequate responder (TNF -IR) subjects, who represent the population with the 
greatest unmet need, the primary  endpoint of ACR20 response rate at Week 12 was 
significantl y greater at all dos es of upadacitinib (up to 73%) compared with placebo 
(35%).
In addition, numericall y higher proportions of subjects achieved ACR50 and ACR70 
responses and low disease activity  (LDA, based on Disease Activity  Score [DAS] 28 
C-reactive protein [CRP] and Clinical Disease Activity  Index [CDAI ]) in the upadacitinib
dose groups versus placebo. 
Upadacitinib

In MTX -inadequate responder (MTX -IR) subjects, the primary  endpoint of ACR20 
response rate at Week 12 was significantly greater (up to 82%) at all but the lowest dose 
of upadacitinib compared with placebo (50%).  At all doses of upadacitinib compared to 
placebo, significantl y higher proportions of subjects achieved LDA and clinical remission 
at Week 12.
Safety  results across the studies showed that upadacitinib was well tole rated and the ty pes 
and frequencies of adverse events (AEs) were consistent with subjects with moderatel y to 
severel y active RA receiving immunomodulatory  therapy .  One subject died from lung 
cancer 14 weeks after completing the 12 -week study  (Study  M13 -537); the lung cancer 
was considered b y the investigator as not related to study drug.  This subject had a 
40pack -year history  of tobacco use and a positive family  history  of lung cancer.  The 
rates of serious adverse events (SAEs) and AEs resulting in disc ontinuation of study  drug 
were low and not significantly  different from placebo.  No trends in the number of 
subjects with potentially  clinically  significant values or changes per dose group were 
observed for an y of the hematology or urine parameters; howe ver, treatment- emergent 
increases in blood creatine phosphokinase (CPK), all of which were as ymptomatic, were 
reported with higher doses of u padacitinib (12 to 18 mg BID).  No subject discontinued 
study  drug due to elevated CPK.  I n all subjects, the CPK v alues normalized or were 
significantl y reduced at the time of last observation.  Among subjects with laboratory 
evidence of s ystemic inflammation (as evidenced by  C-reactive protein [CRP] 
> upper limit of normal [ULN]), treatment with upadacitinib 3 mg BID or 6 mg BID was 
associated with improvements in mean hemoglobin (Hgb) relative to placebo.  At higher 
doses, there was a reduction in mean Hgb, however the reduction was not clinically 
significant, as mean Hgb levels remained within normal range throughou t the treatment 
period.  One subject each in the [ADDRESS_895766] 2016 -004152 -30

Phase 3 Studies with U padacitinib
Six multi- country  randomized controlled trials (RCTs) inclusive of approximately  
4,425 subjects are planned or ongoing for u padacitinib in subjects with moderatel y to 
severel y active RA.  Study M13 -542 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) will enroll subjects who had an 
inadequa te response to biologic DMARDs.  Study  M15 -925 (NCT TBD) will compare 
upadacitinib vs. abatacept in subjects who had an inadequate response to biologic 
DMARDs.  Study  M13 -549 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) will enroll subjects who are on a stable dose 
of conventional s ynthetic DMARD (csDMARD) and have an inadequate response to 
csDMARDs.  Study  M14 -465 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) will enroll subjects who are on a stable 
dose of MTX and have an inadequate response to MTX.  Study  M13 -545 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) 
will enroll subjects who are MTX naïve.   Study  M15 -555 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) will enroll 
subjects who had an inadequate response to MTX and will investigate the use of 
upadacitinib as monotherapy .  A total of 3 dose regimens of upadacitinib once -daily 
tablets [30 mg QD, 15 mg QD, and 7.5 mg QD (Japan o nly)] will be evaluated.  There are 
no data available from these studies at this time.

3.2 Benefits and Risks
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_96631] y of various PsA therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including conventional synthetic 
(cs)DMARDs, 1 targeted sy nthetic (ts)DMARD and biologic (b)DMARDs, many patients 
still do not respond adequately to these treatments, or graduall y lose response over time.  
There is evidence for clinical benefit of JAK inhibition in PsA based on 2 Phase 3 studies 
of tofacitinib, a non- selective JAK inhibitor.31,32  Many  AEs (serious infections, herpes 
zoster reactivation, malignancies, and hematologic adverse events) observed for 
tofacitinib are thought to be a consequence of non -selectivity  against the members of the 
JAK family  of proteins.  Upadacitinib is a novel selective JAK1 inhibitor with the ability  
to decrease joint inflammation and damage mediated by [CONTACT_166527]1 signaling while having  
Upadacitinib
M15 -[ADDRESS_895768] 2016 -004152 -30
32
minimal inhibitory  effects on JAK2 and JAK3.  This could potentially  minimize some of 
the reported safet y concerns with n on-selective JAK inhibition which are thought to be 
mediated b y inhibition of JAK2 and JAK3 signaling pathways.  A Phase 2 program with 
upadacitinib demonstrated efficacy  for improvement in signs and s ymptoms of RA and 
the safet y results were consistent wi th those known to be associated with JAK 
inhibition.36-46  Together, the safet y and efficacy data from the Phase 2 RA program and 
establishment of proof of concept for efficacy  of JAK inhibition in PsA (with tofacitinib) 
support furth er development of upadacitinib in Phase [ADDRESS_895769] been reported as well as adverse events in the categories of 
malignancies, and gastrointestinal disorders such as gastrointestinal perforation.  Eve nts 
of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary  embolism (PE) have been reported in 
patients receiving JAK inhibitors including upadacitinib.
In addition, laboratory  changes including elevations of liver function tests, increase in 
lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], elevation in serum creatinine, creatine phosphokinase, reduced hemoglobin 
depending on baseline inflammatory  burden, lower white blood cell counts, and 
reductions in Natural Killer (NK) cells have been observed with upadacitinib therap y. 
The results of all genetic toxico logy testing indicate that upadacitinib is not genotoxic, 
however upadacitinib is teratogenic based on animal studies, which necessitates avoidance 
of pregnancy  in women of childbearing potential.  Based on the calculated safety margins 
for human fetal exp
osure with seminal fluid transfer, there is judged to be no risk to the 
pregnancy  of female partners of male subjects who are treated with upadacitinib.
A detailed discussion of the pre -clinical and clinical toxicology , metabolism, 
pharmacology  and safet y experience with upadacitinib can be found in the current 
Investigator's Brochure.

5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description
This is a Phase 3 multicenter study that includes two periods.  Period 1 is 56 -weeks in 
duration and includes a 24 -week randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, placebo-
controlled period followed by  [CONTACT_33018] 32 weeks of blinded tre atment (Weeks 24 –
56).  Period [ADDRESS_895773] an inadequate response to bDMARDs (Bio -IR).  Pe riod 2 is an open label 
(blinded until the last subject completes the last visit of Period 1) long -term extension of 
up to a total treatment duration of approximately  [ADDRESS_895774] 2016 -004152 -30
34
Upon approval of protocol amendment 8, subjects receiving upadacitinib 30 mg QD will 
be switched to upadacitinib 15 mg QD at their next scheduled study visit.
The study  is designed to enroll approx imately  630 subjects at approximately  165 study  
centers worldwide to meet scientific and regulatory objectives without enrolling an undue 
number of subjects in alignment with ethical considerations.
The study  duration will include a 35 -day screening period ; a 56 -week blinded period 
which includes 24 weeks of double -blind, placebo -controlled treatment followed b y 
32weeks of treatment blinded to dose of u padacitinib (Period 1); a long- term extension 
period of up to a total treatment duration of approximately 3 years ([blinded until the 
last subject completes the last visit of Period 1] Period 2); and a 30 -day follow-up call or 
visit.
Subjects who meet eligibility  criteria will be stratified by  [CONTACT_620916] ( ≥ 3% body  
surface area [BSA] or < 3% BSA), current use of at least [ADDRESS_895775], and number of prior

Group 2:  u padacitinib 30 mg QD (N = 210)
Group 3:  Placebo followed by  [CONTACT_620917] 15 mg QD (N = 105)
Group 4:  Placebo followed by [CONTACT_620917] 30 mg QD (N = 105)
No more than approximately  40% of subjects will be enrolled with < 3% BSA extent of 
psoriasis and no more than approximately  30% of subjects will be enrolled with prior 
failure of more than [ADDRESS_895776] 2016 -004152 -30

Subjects will receive oral study  drug QD (u padacitinib 15 mg, u padacitinib 30 mg, or 
matching placebo) until the end of the stud y or they discontinue stud y drug.
Subjects who were assigned to placebo at Baseline will be preassigned to receive either 
upadacitinib 15 mg Q D or upadacitinib 30 mg QD starting at Week 24 in a 1:1 ratio.  
Subjects who complete the Week 56 visit (end of Period 1) will enter the long -term 
extension portion of the study , Period 2 (total treatment up to approximately 3 y ears).  
Subjects will continue study  treatment as assigned in Period 1.  Subjects will continue to 
receive upadacitinib [ADDRESS_895777] visit of Period 1 (Week 56), when study 
drug assignme nt in both periods will be unblinded to the sites, and subjects will be 
dispensed study  drug in an open -label fashion until the completion of Period 2.  Upon 
approval of protocol amendment [ADDRESS_895778] had inadequate response to ≥ [ADDRESS_895779] therap y at baseline (methotrexate (MTX), 
sulfasalazine (SSZ), leflunomide (L EF), apremilast, hy droxychloroquine (HCQ), 
bucillamine or iguratimod), non -biologi c DMARDs should have been started ≥12weeks 
prior to baseline visit, must be at stable dose for ≥ [ADDRESS_895780] dose of study  
drug and remain at stable dose through Week 36 of the study ; the non -biologic DMARD 
dose may  be decreased only  for s afety reasons.  In addition, all subjects taking MTX 
should take a dietary  supplement of oral folic acid (or equivalent) throughout study  
participation.  Folic acid dosing and timing of regimen should be followed according to 
the Investigator's instruction s.  Please refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] for additional details related 
to prior and concomitant DMARD therap y. 
At Week 16, rescue therapy will be offe red to subjects classified as non -responders

tender point, intra -bursa, or intra -tendon sheath corticosteroid injection for 1 peripheral 
joint, 1 trigger point, 1 tender point, 1 bursa, or 1 enthesis as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]
(Rescue Therap y).
At Week 24, all subjects allocated to placebo at Baseline will be switched to blinded 
upadacitinib (randomized at baseline to either 15 mg QD or 30 mg QD) treatment 
regardless of clinical response.  
After the last subject completes the Week [ADDRESS_895782] 20% improvement in either 
or both TJC and SJC compared to baseline at 2 consecutive visits will be discontinued 
from study  drug treatment.  Additionally , in subjects continuing on study  drug, starting at 
the Week 36 visit (after Week [ADDRESS_895783] been performed), initiation of or 
change in background PsA medication(s) including oral corticosteroids, non- steroidal 
anti-inflammatory  drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen/paracetamol, low potency  opi[INVESTIGATOR_858],

a. At Week 16 rescue therapy will be offered to subjects classified as non -responders (defined as not achieving at 
least 20% improveme nt in either or both tender joint count (TJC) and swollen joint count (SJC) at both Week 12 
and Week 16) as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
b. At Week 24, all placebo subjects will switch to upadacitinib 15 mg QD or 30 mg QD (1:1 ratio) regardless of 
response.
Note: Upon approval of protocol amendment 8 , subjects receiving upadacitinib 30 mg QD will be switched to 
upadacitinib 15 mg QD at their next sch eduled study visit.
Screening Period
Within 35 day s prior to the Baseline Visit, subjects will receive a full explanation of the 
study  design and stud y procedures, provide a written informed consent, and undergo the 
screening procedures outlined in Appendix C.  Lab values can be re -tested once during the 
screening period.  If the re -tested lab value(s) remain(s) exclusionary , the subject will be 
considered a screen failure.  Redrawing samples if initial samples were unable to be 
analyzed would not count as a retest since initial result was never obtained.
Subjects that initially  screen -fail for the stud y are permitted to re- screen once following 
re-consent without pr ior [COMPANY_013] approval.  For additional re -screening, [COMPANY_013]

Therapeutic Area Medical Director (TA MD) approval is required.  All screening 
procedures with the possible exceptions noted below will be repeated during re -screening.  
The subject must meet all th e inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria at the time of 
re-screening in order to qualify  for the study .  There is no minimum period of time a 
subject must wait to re -screen for the stud y. 
If the subject had a complete initial screening evaluation in cluding HBV, HCV and HIV 
serology , the assessment of an Interferon -Gamma Release Assay  (IGRA; QuantiFERON 
Tuberculosis [TB] Gold test) and/or a purified protein derivative ([COMPANY_003]) test (or 
equivalent) (or both if required per local guidelines), chest x -ray, and electrocardiogram 
(ECG), these tests will not be required to be repeated for re -screening provided the 
conditions noted in Section [IP_ADDRESS] are m et, there are no changes in the subject's medical 
history  that would warrant re -testing, and no more than [ADDRESS_895786] passed.  X -rays of 
hands and feet may  be repeated although will not be required during re -screening.
Period 1 (56 -Week Randomized, Double -Blind Treatment Period)
Period 1 will begin at the Baseline Visit (Day  1) and will end at the Week 56 Visit.  At the 
Baseline Visit, subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion 
criteria described in Section 5.2.1 and Section 5.2.2 will be enrolled into the study  and 
randomized to double -blind treatment.  During this period of the stud y, subjects will visit 
the study  site at Baseline (Day  1), Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 44 and 56.  A 
± 3 day  window is permitted around scheduled study  visits up to Week 36.  Following 
Week 36, a ± [ADDRESS_895787] dose of oral stud y drug in Period 1 is 
taken the day prior to the Week 56 visit.
Period 2 (Long -Term Extension Period [up to a Total Treatment Duration of 
Approximately  3 Years])
Period [ADDRESS_895788] visit of Period 1 (Week 56), stud y drug a ssignment in 
both periods will be unblinded to the sites, and subjects will be dispensed study drug in an 
open -label fashion until the completion of Period 2.  During Period 2, subjects will have a  
Upadacitinib
M15 -[ADDRESS_895789] 2016 -004152 -30
39
study  visit at Week 56 and every  12 weeks thereafter until completion of the study .  A 
± 7day window is permitted around scheduled study  visits. 
The last dose of oral study drug is taken the day prior to the Week 152 visit.
Upon approval of protocol amendment 8, subjects receiving upadacitinib 30 mg QD will 
be switched to upadacitinib 15 mg QD at their next scheduled study visit .
Discontinuation of Study Drug and Continuation of Study Participation (Period 1 
and Period 2)
Starting at Week 36, subjects who failed to show at least 20% improvement in either or 
both TJC and SJC compared to baseline at 2 consecutive visits will be discontinued from 
study  drug treatment.  Subjects who discontinue study  drug treatment may  choose to 
continue to participate in the study  (refer to Section 5.4.1 for additional details).  Subjects 
who prematurely  discontinue study  drug should complete a Premature Discontinuation 
visit (PD visit) as soon as possible, preferabl y within 2 weeks of stud y drug 
discontinuation and preferably prior to initiation of another therap y.  Afterwards, subjects 
should follow the regular visit schedule as outlined in Appendix Cand adhere to all stud y 
procedures except for dispensing stud y drug, annual TB testing, PK sample collection, 
blood sample collection for optional exploratory  research and validation studies, and 
calculation for drug assignment based on TJ C/SJC.  If a subject no longer wants to 
provide assessments (withdrawal of informed consent) following discontinuation of study 
drug, a second PD visit is not required.  
Premature Discontinuation of Study (Withdrawal of Informed Consent) (Period 1 
and Per iod 2)
Subjects may withdraw from the study  completely (withdrawal of informed consent) for 
any reason at any  time (refer to Section 5.4.2 for addit ional details).  If a subject 
prematurel y discontinues study drug treatment and study participation (withdrawal of 
informed consent), the procedures outlined for the Premature Discontinuation visit (PD 
visit) should be completed as soon as possible, prefer ably within [ADDRESS_895790] 2016 -004152 -30
40
discontinuation and preferably prior to initiation of another therap y.  In addition, a 30- day 
follow -up visit (or phone call if a visit is not possible) should occur to determine the status 
of an y ongoing AEs/SAEs or the o ccurrence of any  new AEs/SAEs.
Follow -Up Period

The Rationale for the Exclusion Criteria
1 –3, [ADDRESS_895811] of u padacitinib on pregnancies is unknown
4 –10, 12, 14 – 18 To ensure safet y of the subjects throughout the study
5.2.3 Prior, Concomitant, and Prohibited Therapy
Any medication or vaccine (including over -the-counter or prescription medicines, 
vitamins and/or herbal supplements including folic acid) that the subject is receiving 
within 28 day s prior to Screening and/or receives du ring the stud y, must be recorded 
along with the reason for use, date(s) of administration including start and end dates, and 
dosage information including dose, route and frequency  must be recorded in the eCRF. 
Vaccines
Vaccines recommended by  [CONTACT_663498].  If the investigator 
chooses to administer a vaccine, this should be completed before first dose of study drug 
with appropriate precautions and time interval.  It is recommended that subjects be up to 
date for recommended inactivated, toxoid or biosynthetic vaccines, such as injectable flu 
vaccine, pneumococcal, and pertussis (Tdap).  It is recommended that the live herpes 
zoster vaccine should be considered for administration at least 4 weeks (8 weeks in Japan) 
before first dose of stud y drug or administered at least [ADDRESS_895812] dose of oral stud y 
drug.  If the herpes zoster vaccine is to be administered, and there is no known history of 
primary  varicella (chicken pox), pre -existing immunity  to varicella should be confirmed
with antibody  testing at or prior to screening and prior to administration of the herpes 
zoster vaccine.  If screening varicella antibody testing is negative the herpes zoster 
vaccine should not be administered.  See Section [IP_ADDRESS] for a list of commonly  used live 
vaccines.

[IP_ADDRESS] Prior Therapy
All prior drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_620891] (arthritis and psoriasis), since initial diagnosis, must be 
recorded in the eCRF along with the dates of first and last dose, maximum dosage taken, 
route of administration and reason for discontinuation, if known.  Additionally , the 
investigator will record response to bDMARDs (e.g., no response, inadequate response, 
loss of response) or intolerance to bDMARDs.
[IP_ADDRESS] Permitted Background Therapy
In Period 1, if subjects are on background DMARDs the y should continue on their stable 
background treatment of up to 2 non- biologic DMARDs (DMARDs should have been 
started ≥ 12 weeks prior to the Baseline visit and without dosing or administration 
changes ≥ 4 weeks prior to the Baseline visit).  The followin g non -biologic DMARDs are 
permitted as background therap y during the stud y:  MTX ( ≤ 25 mg/week), SSZ 
(≤3000 mg/day ), leflunomide (L EF) ( ≤ 20 mg/day ), apremilast (≤ 60 mg/day ), HCQ 
(≤400 mg/day ), bucillamine ( ≤ 300 mg/day ) and iguratimod (≤ 50 mg/day ).  In addition, 
for all subjects taking MTX, subjects should take a dietary  supplement of oral folic acid 
(or equivalent, such as folinic acid) throughout study participation.  Folic acid dosing and 
timing of regimen should be followed according to I nvestigato r's instructions.  No other 
DMARDs are permitted during the first [ADDRESS_895814] 36 weeks of study  participation in Period 1, subjects should also continue on 
their stable doses of NSAIDs, acetaminophen/paracetamol, low -potency  opi[INVESTIGATOR_858] (tramadol 
or combination of acetaminophen with codeine or hy drocodone), oral corticosteroids 
(equi valent to prednisone ≤ 10 mg/day ).  If taking any  of the above on a scheduled basis, 
they should continue to take them as they  did at study  entry  with no change in dose or 
frequency , including on study  visit day s.  If not taking an y of the above at baselin e, these  
Upadacitinib
M15 -[ADDRESS_895815] 2016 -004152 -30
49
should not be initiated except where permitted by [CONTACT_990] (specific time period or 
protocol -defined rescue).  If taking an y of the above at baseline on an as -needed basis 
(PRN), they  should continue to use them for the same reason and same dose e ach time but 
they should not be taken within the 24 hours prior to any  study  visit to avoid bias in 
outcome measurements.  In the event of tolerability (or other safet y) issues, these 
medications may  be decreased, or discontinued with substitution of anoth er permitted 
medication from that class.  PRN use of inhaled corticosteroids is permitted at an y time.
In Periods 1 and 2, starting at Week 36 (after Week [ADDRESS_895816] been performed) 
and thereafter, [ADDRESS_895817] o f care, is allowed 
every  12 weeks.  However, corticosteroid injections should be avoided within 21 days 
prior to the next scheduled study  visit to avoid confounding effects of s ystemic absorption 
of intra -articular, trigger point or tender point, intra -bursa, and intra -tendon sheath 
corticosteroids. 
In addition, at Week 36 (after Week [ADDRESS_895818] been performed) and thereafter,

of the TJC, SJC , and enthesitis sites, injected joints or enthesitis sites will be considered 
"not assessable" for 90 day s from the time of the injection.
5.2.4 Contraception Recommendations
Contraception Recommendation for Females
A woman who is postmenopausal or permanentl y surgically  sterile is not considered to be 
a woman of childbearing potential and is not required to follow contraception 
recommendations.
Surgicall y sterile is defined as:
●bilateral oophorectomy  (surgical removal of both ovaries); or  
● bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_31639] (surgical removal of both fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_2134]); or  
●hysterectom y (surgical removal of uterus)
Postmenopausal is defined as:
●Age ≥ 55 y ears with no menses for 12 or more months without an alternative 
medical cause;
OR
●Age < 55 years with no menses for 12 or more months without an alternative 
medical cause AND an follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level 
>40mIU/mL . 
Upadacitinib
M15 -[ADDRESS_895830] is < 55 y ears of age and has had no menses for ≥ 12 months AND 
has no history  of permanent surgical sterilization (defin ed above), FSH should be tested at 
Screening.
●If FSH is not tested, it is assumed that the subject is of childbearing potential 
and protocol- specified contraception is required.
●If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent with post -menopausal status,
contraception is not required.
●If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent with pre -menopausal status, 
contraception is required, and pregnancy  testing requirements for women of 
childbearing potential must be followed (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] pregnancy  test).
For a female subject at any  age:
●Female subjects with menses within the past 12 months are of childbearing 
potential and FSH is therefore not required but contraception is required.
●Female subjects who are surgically  sterile (defined above) are not of 
childbearing potential and therefore no FSH testing or contraception is 
required.
A woman who does not meet the definition of postmenopausal or permanently  surgicall y 
sterile is considered of childbearing potential and is required to practice at least one of the 
following highly  effective methods of birth control that is effective from Study  Day  1 (or 
earlier) through at least [ADDRESS_895831] dose of study  drug.
●Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception 
(oral, injectable, intravaginal, transdermal) associated with the inhibition of 
ovulation, initiated at least 30 days prior to Baseline Visit.
●Progestogen -only hormonal contrace ption (oral, injectable, implantable) 
associated with inhibition of ovulation, initiated at least 30 days prior to 
Baseline Visit. 
●Bilateral tubal occlusion/ligation (Japan only:  bilateral tubal ligation only). 
Upadacitinib
M15 -[ADDRESS_895832] 2016 -004152 -30

●Vasectomized partner(s) provided the vasectomized partner verball y confirms 
receipt of medical assessment of the surgical success and is the sole sexual 
partner of the women of childbearing potential trial participant.
●Intrauterine device (IUD). 
●Intrauterine hormone -releasing s ystem (IUS).
●True ab stinence:  Refraining from heterosexual intercourse when this is in line 
with the preferred and usual lifesty le of the subject. Periodic abstinence, for 
example, using calendar, ovulation, sy mptothermal, post -ovulation methods, 
and withdrawal are not acce ptable.
If required per local practices, male or female condom with or without spermicide OR 
cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide should be used in addition to one of the birth 
control methods listed above (excluding true abstinence). 
If during the c ourse of the study  a woman becomes surgically sterile or post -menopausal 
and complete documentation is available, contraceptive measures as defined above are no 
longer required.
It is important to note that contraception recommendations described above are
specificall y intended to prevent pregnancy during exposure to the investigational therap y.  
Contraception recommendations related to use of concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_117925].
Additional local requirem ents may  appl y.  Refer to Appendix Gfor local requirements.
Contraception Recommendation for Males
Based on data from animal studies (including a fertility  study ) there is no effect of 
upadacitinib on male reproduction.
No contraception is required for male subjects. 
If a pregnancy occurs, a partner authorization form requesting pregnancy  outcome 
information may  be requested from the pregnant partner.

5.3 Efficacy  and Safety  Assessments/Variables
5.3.1 Efficacy  and Safety  Measurements A ssessed
Subjects will be allowed a visit window of ± 3 days for all study  visits (with the exception 
of the Baseline Visit, as the screening window is a maximum of 35 day s) up to the 
Week [ADDRESS_895834] a visit window of ± [ADDRESS_895835] date of study  drug administration (Baseline Visit).
Study  procedures described are listed in the following section of this protocol and are 
summarized in tabular format in Appendix C.
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Procedures
The study  procedures outlined in Appendix Care discussed in detail in this section, with 
the exception of in vivo pharmacod ynamic biomarkers (discussed in Section [IP_ADDRESS] ), 
exploratory  research and validation studies (discussed in Section [IP_ADDRESS] ), drug 
concentration measurements (discussed in Section 5.3.2), the collection of prior and 
concomitant medication information (discussed in Sectio n 5.2.3), and the collection of AE 
information (discussed in Section 6.0).  All study  data will be recorded in source 
documents and on the appropriate eCRFs.
Informed Consent
At the Screening visit, the subject will sign and date a study specific, IEC/IRB approved, 
informed consent form before any stud y procedures are performed or an y medications are 
withheld from the subject in order to participate in this study .  Separate written consent 
will be required for each subject in order to participate in the optional exploratory 
research and validat ion studies.  The separate written consent may be part of the main  
Upadacitinib
M15 -[ADDRESS_895836] 2016 -004152 -30
59
consent form.  Subjects can withdraw informed consent at an y time.  Details regarding 
how informed consent will be obtained and documented are provided in Section 9.3.
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
Subjects will be evaluated to ensure they  meet all inclusion criteria and have none of the 
exclusion criteria at both Screening and Baseline Visits.
Medical/Surgical History
A complete non -PsA medical and surgical history, including history  of alcohol use and 
nicotine use will be taken from each subject during the Screening Visit.  Additionally , a 
list of each subject's PsA and PsO related me dical and surgical history  will be recorded at 
Screening.  History  of herpes zoster, herpes zoster vaccination, and hepatitis B 
vaccination status will be recorded as part of the medical history .  An updated medical 
history  will be obtained prior to study  drug administration at Baseline, to ensure the 
subject is still eligible for enrollment.  
A detailed medical history with respect to TB risk factors will be documented in the study 
source documentation.  This information will include BCG vaccination, coha bitation with 
individuals who have had TB, and travel to, residence in, or work in TB endemic 
locations.
Vital Signs, Weight and Height
Vital sign determinations of sy stolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate (counted for 
at least 30 seconds after 5 minutes in sitting position), respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], body weight, and 
body  temperature will be obtained at the designated study  visits in Appendix C.  Vital 
signs shoul d be performed before blood draws and prior to receipt of study drug.  Height 
will be measured at the Screening Visit only (with shoes off).  All measurements will be 
recorded in metric units where applicable. 
Upadacitinib
M15 -[ADDRESS_895837]'s medical history .  Abnormalities noted after the Baseline Visit 
and first dose of stud y drug should be eval uated and documented by  [CONTACT_663500].  All findings whether related to an AE or part of each 
subject's medical history  should be captured on the appropriate eCRF page.
A symptom -directed ph ysical examination will be p erformed when necessary .
Due to a state of emergency  or pandemic situation, subject visits may  be conducted via 
phone or video conference.  In these situations, if a visit by [CONTACT_663501], 
the complete ph ysical examination will be performed at the next feasible visit.
12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG)
A resting 12 -lead ECG will be performed at the Screening Visit and Week 56.  A 
qualified phy sician will inter pret the clinical significance of an y abnormal finding, sign, 
and date each ECG.  ECGs with QT interval corrected for heart rate using Friedericia's 
correction formula (QTcF) should be reported (or calculated) and documented in the 
source documents and lat er transcribed on to the appropriate eCRF if QTcF prolongation 
is observed.  In these cases, the baseline QTcF will need to be entered into the appropriate 
eCRF for comparison as well.  A valid QTcF cannot be calculated in subjects who have a 
pacemaker or supraventricular or ventricular conduction abnormalities.  In addition, any  
clinically  significant findings will be documented in the source documents and later  
Upadacitinib
M15 -[ADDRESS_895838]'s s ource documents onsite.  
For subjects with a normal ECG taken within [ADDRESS_895839]'s health status since the time of the test that 
warrants a repeat test.  If there are clinicall y significant findings, the Investigator must 
contact [CONTACT_599803].
Subjects can have a repeat ECG at an y time during the stud y as warranted based on the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_689].
X-Rays of the Hands and Feet
If Item 5 of the CASPAR ( Appendix F) criteria needs to be verified for a subject to meet 
eligibilit y, prior x -rays (no time limit) of any  combination of bilateral hands and feet with 
images and/or report available to the site can be used to document juxta -articular new 
bone formation.  There is no need to have a full set of x -rays of both hands and both feet 
as a single image could fulfill this criterion. 
If no prior x -rays (images and/or report) are available, subjects are required to have x -rays 
of both hands and feet at screening in order to document all items of the CASPAR criteria. 
If prior x -raysare available, but do not demonstrate radiographic evidence of juxta -
articular new bone formation, subjects may  have repeat x -rays of both hands and feet at 
screening if at least [ADDRESS_895840] X- Ray (CXR)

relevant findings.  The CXR will not be required if the subject had a 
previously  normal CXR (posterior -anterior and lateral views) within [ADDRESS_895842]'s medical 
history  to warrant a repeat test.
●Annually  for subjects with one or more TB risk factors as identified b y the TB 
risk assessment for m (Appendix E), subjects living in areas endemic for TB, 
and subjects with newl y positive [COMPANY_003] and/or QuantiFERON -TB Gold test or 
equivalents after baseline.
Subjects can have a repeat CXR at any  time during the stud y as warranted based on the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2511] I nvestigator. 
A radiologist or pulmonologist must perform an assessment of the CXR.  The Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_176369] y findings and will sign and date 
the report.  In the assessment of the CXR (review of images required), a radiologist, the 
Principal I nvestigator or their phy sician delegate must indicate the presence or absence of 
(1)calcified granulom as, (2) pleural scarring/thickening, and (3) signs of active TB.  If the 
CXR demonstrates changes suggestive of previous TB (e.g., calcified nodule, fibrotic 
scar, api[INVESTIGATOR_110962]) or other findings that are clinically significant, 
thePrincipal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_110963].
In the event CXR may  not be performed at the planned visit due to a state of emergency  
or pandemic situation, perform the CXR at the next feasible visit.
Pregnancy Test
Aserum pregnancy  test will be performed for all women of childbearing potential at the 
Screening Visit.  The serum pregnancy test will be sent to and performed by [CONTACT_11378] .  If the serum pregnancy  test is positive the subject is considered a screen 
failure.  If the serum pregnancy  test is borderline, it should be repeated ≥ [ADDRESS_895843] is:

●If the baseline urine pregnancy  test performed at the site is negative, then 
dosing with study  drug may  begin.
●If the baseline urine pregnancy  test performed at the site is positive, dosing 
with study  drug must be withheld and a serum pregnancy  test is required.  The 
serum pregnancy  test will be sent to and performed by  [CONTACT_2237] .  
If the serum pregnancy  test is negative, stud y drug may be started.  If the 
serum pregnancy  test is pos itive, study  drug must be withheld and the subject 
must be discontinued from study  drug treatment.  In the event a serum 
pregnancy  test comes back borderline, a repeat test is required ( ≥ 3 day s later) 
to document continued lack of a positive result.
●If a urine pregnancy  test post -baseline is positive, study  drug needs to be 
temporaril y discontinued and a serum pregnancy test is required.  The serum 
pregnancy  test will be sent to and performed b y the central laboratory.  If the 
serum pregnancy  test is negat ive, study  drug may  be restarted.  If the serum 
pregnancy  test is positive, study  drug must be permanently discontinued.  In 
the event a pregnancy  test comes back borderline, a repeat test is required 
(≥ 3 days later) to document continued lack of a positi ve result.
In Period 2, for women of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test will be performed 
at all visits and monthly  at home between scheduled study  visits.  The results of the 
monthly  at home tests will be communicated to the site.  If a urine pregnancy  test is

If during the course of the study  a woman becomes surgically sterile or post -menopausal 
and complete documentation as described in Section 5.2.4 is available, pregnancy  testing 
is no longer required.
A pregnant or breastfeeding female will not be eligible for participation in this study  or be 
allowed to continue study drug.
TB Testing/TB Prophylaxis
The TB screening tests provide diagnostic test results to be interpreted in the context of 
the subject's epi[INVESTIGATOR_623], history , exam findings, etc., and it is the responsibility  of the 
Investigator to determine if a subject has previous, ac tive, or latent TB.
At screening, all subjects will be assessed for evidence of increased risk for TB b y a risk 
assessment form ( Appendix E) and tested for TB infe ction b y QuantiFERON -TB Gold 
test.  The [COMPANY_003] Skin Test should be utilized only  when a QuantiFERON -TB Gold Test is 
not possible for an y reason (unless both tests are required per local guidelines).  The site 
staff will complete the TB risk assessment form and enter the data into an appropriate 
eCRF.  The TB risk assessment form will be completed annuall y for all subjects, 
regardless of TB test results.  One or more "y es" response on the TB risk assessment form 
indicates increased risk of TB.   At annual evalua tions, questions on the TB risk 
assessment form should be answered considering the previous y ear when the timeframe is 
not indicated in the question.
If a QuantiFERON -TB Gold Test cannot be performed by  [CONTACT_663502] a subject had a nega tive [COMPANY_003] test within [ADDRESS_895847]'s medical history to warrant a repeat test.  
These cases may  be dis cussed with the [COMPANY_013] Therapeutic Area Medical Director.  The 
results of the TB test(s) will be retained at the site as the original source documentation.
In cases where the QuantiFERON- TB Gold test by  [CONTACT_663503] (i.e., no risk factors identified on 
the TB risk questionnaire) and has no clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_110958], the inve stigator may  
perform a local QuantiFERON -TB Gold test (or repeat testing through the central 
laboratory if not locall y available) to confirm the positive test result.  I f the repeat testing 
result is negative, the investigator may  consider the test to be negative based on his/her 
clinical judgment; if the repeat testing result is positive, the test is consi dered positive.
For subjects with a negative TB test result at Screening or most recent evaluation, an 
annual TB re -test will be performed.  If an annual TB test is newl y positive 
(seroconversion), a chest x -ray (CXR) needs to be performed as soon as possi ble to aid in 
distinguishing active versus latent TB.  For subjects with seroconversion on an annual TB 
test, in the absence of a positive response to an y question on the TB risk assessment 
questionnaire, if a CXR cannot be done due to restrictions because ofstate of emergency  
or pandemic situations , the investigator should contact [CONTACT_663504].  CXR should be performed as soon as 
restrictions are lifted at the study  site or local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/facility .  Expert consultation can be 
considered per Investigator's discretion.  An y positive TB screen after the patient has 
started the study  should be reported as an AE of latent TB or active TB (as applicable).
Subjects with documentation of a prior positive r esult of QuantiFERON -TB Gold Test (or 
equivalent) or [COMPANY_003] are not required to repeat either test at Screening or during the stud y 
and should be considered positive. 
Upadacitinib
M15 -[ADDRESS_895848]:
●For regions that require both [COMPANY_003] and QuantiFERON -TB Gold testing, both 
will be performed.  If either [COMPANY_003] or QuantiFERON -TB Gold are positive, the 
TB test is considered positive.
●If a site has the capacit y to perform both [COMPANY_003] and QuantiFERON -TB Gold 
tests, and local guidelines require onl y one test to be performed, then the 
QuantiFERO N-TB Gold is the preferred test.  At a site with capacit y to 
perform both tests, if a [COMPANY_003] is plac ed as the onl y form of TB test at screening, 
then the TB test to be used for the remainder of the study for that subject is the 
[COMPANY_003].  Similarly , if a subject e nters the study  with a QuantiFERON -TB Gold 
test alone or other IGRA (negative result), then the subject should have their 
annual TB test performed with QuantiFERON -TB Gold test.
●If the QuantiFERON -TB Gold Test is NOT possible (or if both the 
QuantiFERON- TBGold Test and the [COMPANY_003] Skin Test are required per local 
guidelines):  the [COMPANY_003] Skin Test (also known as a TB Skin Test) will be 
performed according to standard clinical practice .  The TB Skin Test should be 
read b y a licensed healthcare professional between [ADDRESS_895849].  The reaction will be measured in millimeters 
(mm) of induration and induration ≥ 5 mm is considered a positive reactio n.  
The absence of induration will be recorded as "0 mm" not "negative."  
●Subjects who have had an ulcerating reaction to the TB Skin Test in the past 
should not be re -exposed and the TB Skin Test should be considered positive.
●If the QuantiFERON -TB Gold test is indeterminate, then the investigator 
should perform a local QuantiFERON- TB Gold test (or through the central 
laboratory  if not locall y available) to rule out a positive test result.  I f testing 
remains indeterminate or is positive, then the subject is considered to be 
positive for the purpose of this study .  If the testing result is negative, then the 
patient is considered to be negative.
●An equivalent Interferon Gamma Release Assay  (IGRA) (such as T -SPOT TB 
test) may  be substituted for the QuantiFE RON -TB Gold. 
Upadacitinib
M15 -[ADDRESS_895850] x -ray (CXR) not suggestive of active TB or 
prior TB exposure may  be enrolled.
Subjects with a positive TB test must be assessed for evidence of active TB versus latent 
TB, including signs and sy mptom s and CXR.  Subjects with no signs or s ymptoms and a 
CXR not suggestive of active TB may be enrolled after initiation of TB prophylaxis (see 
below).  Subjects with evidence of active TB must not be enrolled.
TB proph ylaxis:
At screening, if the subject has evidence of latent TB infection (positive TB test and the 
subject has a CXR not suggestive of active TB), prophylactic treatment must be initiated

longer); at le ast 6 months of prophy laxis needs to be completed; however, the full course 
of proph ylaxis does not need to be completed prior to the first dose of study  drug.  If the 
Investigator deems that it is necessary , consultation with a TB expert could be consider ed.
Of note:  Rifampin (Rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513]) or Rifapentine are not allowed for TB prophylaxis.
Subjects with a prior history  of latent TB that have documented completion of a full 
course of anti -TB therapy  will be allowed to enter the study  provided nothing has ch anged 
in the subject's medical history  to warrant repeat treatment.
For subjects with completion of a full course of anti -TB therap y, but insufficient 
documentation, the investigator should consult with the [COMPANY_013] TA MD.
Newl y initiated proph ylactic treatm ent should be captured in the eCRF and in the source 
documents.  Prior therapy should be captured in the eCRF.
During the study , subjects with new evidence of latent TB must initiate prophy lactic 
treatment immediately per local guidelines and complete at l east [ADDRESS_895851] should be re -
evaluated (unscheduled visit) for signs and s ymptoms of toxicity  to TB prophy laxis.

Clinica l Laboratory Tests
Blood and urine samples will be obtained for clinical laboratory  tests listed in Table 2.  
Samples will be obtained at the designated stud y visits i n Appendix C. 
Unscheduled clinical labs may  be obtained at an y time during the stud y if deemed 
appropriate per Investigator's discretion.  A certified central labo ratory  will be utilized to 
process and provide results for the clinical laboratory tests.  All abnormal laboratory test 
results that are considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator will be followed to a 
satisfactory  resolution. 
The central labor atory  chosen for this study  will provide instructions regarding the 
collection, processing, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_110965].
Blood draws should be performed after all clinical assessments and questionnaires and 
vital sign determinations have been completed b ut before any  study  drug administration 
during a visit. 
In cases of state -of emergency  or pandemic situations, local laboratories may be used to
collect laboratory  samples per instructions from [COMPANY_013], as local regulations allow.
For clinic visits where samples for serum chemistry  tests are collected, subjects should be 
fasting (a minimum [ADDRESS_895853]) whenever possible.  If a subject is not able to fast when 
necessary , due to unforeseen circumstances, the non -fasting status will be recorded in 
study  sourc e documentation.
Urine samples will be obtained for urinal ysis testing at the specified time points as noted 
in Appendix C.  The central laboratory will be responsi ble for performing a macroscopic

urinaly sis (urine dipstick) on the collected urine specimens.  Specified abnormal 
macroscopic urinal yses defined as leukocy tes, nitrite, protein, ketones or blood greater 
than negative, or glucose greater than normal will b e followed- up with a microscopic 
analysis at the central laboratory .
For an y laboratory  test value outside the reference range that the Investigator considers to 
be clinically  significant, the Investigator should apply  the standard of care for medical 
evaluation and treatment per local guidelines:
●The Investigator will repeat the test to verify the out -of-range value.
●The Investigator will follow the out -of-range value to a satisfactory  clinical 
resolution.
A laboratory  test value that requires a subject to be discontinued from study  drug 
treatment or requires a subject to receive treatment will be recorded as an AE.  The central 
laboratory chosen for this study  will provide instructions regarding the collection, 
processing and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_110965].  The baseline laboratory  test results for clinical 
assessment for a particular test will be defined as the last measurement prior to the initial 
dose of study  drug.

f. At Screening only.  For Japan or where mandated by [CONTACT_5277]:  for subjects with HBs Ab+ and/or HB c 
Ab+ and negative HBV DNA at Screening, the HBV -DNA PCR test should be performed again approximately 
every [ADDRESS_895858] a history of HBV vaccine and is 
HBs Ab+ and HBc Ab–.  
g. All subjects will be assessed for evidence of increased risk for TB by a risk assessment form ( Appendix E) and 
tested for TB infection by [CONTACT_82736] -TB Gold tes t analyzed by [CONTACT_2237].  The [COMPANY_003] Skin Test 
should be utilized only when an IGRA is not possible for any reason (unless both tests are required per local 
guidelines).
h. Starting from Baseline (Day 1) the hs -CRP results will not be reported to the Sponsor, Investigator, study site 
personnel, or the subject.  For safety evaluations of signs and symptoms of infection and management of adverse 
events, the investigator may locally test procalcitonin.  Results of tests such as hs -CRP, and procalcito nin may be 
blunted in subjects taking a JAK inhibitor, thereby [CONTACT_372890] a 
possible safety assessment or adverse event management.  Any local hs -CRP, CRP, or serial procalcitonin tests 
reported to the in vestigator until a subject is known to receive upadacitinib or until treatment allocation is 
unblinded will be recorded as protocol deviations.
i. At screening for female subjects < 55 years of age AND has had no menses for ≥ [ADDRESS_895859]'s health and subject should 
receive or be referred for clinical care promptly.  A subject will not be eligible for study participation if test results 
indicate a positiv e HIV infection.  [COMPANY_013] will not receive results from the testing and will not be made aware of 
any positive result. 
l. A urine pregnancy test will be performed for all female subjects at the Baseline Visit prior to the first dose of study 
drug and all s ubsequent visits.  If the baseline urine pregnancy test performed at the site is negative, then dosing 
with study drug may begin.  If the baseline urine pregnancy test performed at the site is positive, dosing with study 
drug must be withheld and a serum p regnancy test is required.  The serum pregnancy test will be sent to and 
performed by [CONTACT_2237].  If the serum pregnancy test is positive, study drug must be withheld and the 
subject must be discontinued from study drug treatment.  In the even t a serum pregnancy test comes back 
borderline, a repeat test is required ≥ [ADDRESS_895860]
Subjects with HI V infection are excluded from study  participation.  HIV antibody  (Ab) 
testing will be performed at Screening.  The Investigator must discuss an y local reporting

indicate a positive HIV infection (HIV Ab positive).  [COMPANY_013] will not receive results from 
the testing and will not be made aware of an y positive result.
Hepatitis Screening
All subjects will be tested for the presence of the Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) at Screening.  
Hepatitis B: 
Subjects will be tested for the presence of HBV at screening using the following tests:
●HBs Ag (Hepatitis B surface antigen)
●HBc Ab/anti -HBc (Hepatiti s B core antibod y)
●HBs Ab/anti -HBs (Hepatitis B surface antibody )
A positive result for HBs Ag will be exclusionary .
A negative result for HBs Ag will be tested (automatic reflex testing) for core antibodies 
(HBc Ab) and surface antibodies (HBs Ab).
●A neg ative test result for HBc Ab does notrequire HBV DNA PCR qualitative 
testing and the subject may be enrolled ( Figure 2, Scenarios A and B).  
●For a subject who has ha d a HBV vaccination (should document in the medical 
history ), a positive test result for HBs Ab is expected, the HBV DNA PCR 
qualitative testing is not required and the subject may  be enrolled.  For 
subjects without a history of HBV vaccination (and where mandated by  [CONTACT_2243]) a positive result for HBs Ab requires HBV DNA PCR testing 
(automatic reflex testing).  Figure 2, Scenario B.

●A positive result for HBV DNA or a result that exceeds detection sens itivity  
will be considered positive and will be exclusionary.  A subject with a negative 
result for HBV DNA may  be enrolled.
●For Japan or where mandated b y local requirements: subjects with HBs A b+ 
and/or HBc Ab+ and negative HBV DNA at Screening should have HBV 
DNA PCR test ingperformed approximately every [ADDRESS_895863] hasa history  of HBV 
vaccine and HBs Ab+ and HBc Ab –.  If necessary, HBV DNA PCR may  be 
tested at unscheduled visi ts.
Figure 2. Interpretation and Management of HBV Serologic Test Results
* For subjects who have had a HBV vaccination (should be documented in the medical history), a positive test result 
for HBs Ab is expected and these subje cts may be enrolled.  For subjects without a history of HBV vaccination 
(and where mandated by [CONTACT_5277]) a positive result for HBs Ab requires HBV DNA PCR testing.  
** For Japan or where mandated by [CONTACT_5277]: subjects with HBs Ab+ and /or HBc Ab+ and negative HBV 
DNA at screening should have HBV DNA PCR testing performed approximately every [ADDRESS_895864] has a history of HBV vaccine and HBs Ab+ and

Hepatitis C: 
All subjects will be tested for the presence of Hepatitis C Virus antibodies (HCV Ab) at 
Screening.  Samples positive for HCV Ab require PCR qualitative testing for HCV RNA.  
Any HCV RNA PCR result that meets or exceeds detection sensitivity will be 
exclusionary .  Subjects with a history  of treated HCV infection may  be allowed to enroll 
if documentation of effective treatment is available and no evidence of HCV is detected 
by [CONTACT_620946].  
Randomization and Drug Assignment
All Screening laboratory  results must be reviewed, signed and dated b y the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_54720] -investigator prior to the Baseline Visit.  Subjects will not be enrolled 
into the study  if laboratory  or other Screenin g result abnormalities are deemed clinically 
significant b y the Principal I nvestigator or Sub investigator. 
Subjects will be eligible for randomization if they continue to meet all of the selection 
criteria (Section 5.2) at the Baseline Visit and are willing to continue in the study .  
Subjects will be randomized in a 2:2:1:1 ratio using an Interactive Response Technology  
(IRT) to receive double -blind study  drug in one of the following treatment groups:
●Group 1:  upadacitinib 15 mg QD (N = 210)
●Group 2:  upadacitinib 30 mg QD (N = 210)
●Group 3:  Placebo followed by  [CONTACT_620917] 15 mg QD (N = 105)
●Group 4:  Placebo followed by  [CONTACT_620917] 30 mg QD (N = 105)
No more than approximately  40% of subjects will be enrolled with < 3% BSA extent of 
psoriasis and no more than approximately  30% of subjects will be enrolled with prior 
failure of more than [ADDRESS_895866].
Randomization will be stratified b y exten t of psoriasis (≥ 3% bod y surface area [BSA] or 
<3% BSA), current use of at least [ADDRESS_895867], and number of prior failed (had an 
inadequate response to) biologic DMARDs (1 vs >1), except for subjects from Japan, for

which randomization will be stratified b y extent of psoriasis ( ≥ 3% bod y surface area 
[BSA] or < 3% BSA) only .  See Section 5.5.3 for details.
Upon approval of protocol amendment 8, subjects receiving upadacitinib 30 mg QD will 
be switched to upadacitinib 15 mg QD at their next scheduled study visit.
Study  Drug Dispensing, Dosing, and Compliance
Study  drug will be dispensed to subjects beginning at Baseline (Day  1) and as specified in
Appendix C.  The first dose of study drug will be administered after all other Baseline 
(Day  1) procedures are completed.  Subjects will maintain a diary  for all study  drug 
administered outside of the study  visit (i.e., at home) to capture dosing dates and times.  
At visits specified in Appendix C, the site personnel will re view and retain a cop y of the 
diary , returned study  drug kits, and empt y stud y drug packaging to verify  compliance. 
In cases of state -of emergency  or pandemic situations, study  drug may  be shipped directl y
to subjects per instructions from [COMPANY_013], as loca l regulations allow.
All relevant dosing information will be entered into the eCRF at each visit.  (Refer to 
Section 5.5for additional information) .
Subject Diary 
During the Baseline Visit, subjects will be dispensed a paper subject diary and will be 
trained on how to complete the diary  by [CONTACT_6624].  Subjects will be asked to notate their 
concomitant medication use, AEs, and document date and time s of doses of study  drug 
taken between study  visits.  The subject diary  will be reviewed by  [CONTACT_663505] a review and description of the subject diary notations will be 
documented in the subject's source documentation a nd recorded on the applicable eCRF.  
Replacement diaries will be dispensed as needed should a subject misplace a subject 
diary .  The completed diaries will be collected at the subject's final visit and maintained at 
the site as source documentation.

(0 –10 NRS)
●Self-Assessment of Psoriasis Sy mptoms (SAPS)
●SF-36 Health Questionnaire
●Work Productivity  and Activi ty Impairment (WPAI)
All patient -reported outcomes (PROs) are collected electronically .  The subject should 
complete the questionnaires before site personnel perform an y clinical assessments and 
before an y interaction with site personnel has occurred to a void biasing the subject's 
response.
In cases of state -of emergency  or pandemic situations, PROs may  be administered on
paper or over the telephone directl y to subjects b y site personnel within the study visit
window per instructions from [COMPANY_013], as local regulations allow.
Investigator Assessments
The investigator assessments will be recorded on paper worksheets and entered into the 
eCRF and conducted at the study visits specified in Appendix C.  For the following 
assessments, if possible, the investigator assessments should be performed by [CONTACT_663506] y other stud y related

In order to minimize variability , the same assessor should evaluate the subject at each visit 
for th e duration of the trial.  A back -up assessor should be identified.  The assessor should 
be a qualified medical professional (e.g., nurse, physician's assistant, or physician) or be 
pre-approved b y the TA MD as an assessor after review of assessor training and 
experience.  An y assessor must be trained and competent in performing such assessments.  
It is the responsibility  of the I nvestigator to ensure that all assessors are qualified and 
trained to perform assessments and that all training is documented.  If the assessor is not 
available, the pre -identified back -up assessor should perform such assessments.
Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) of Disease Activity  Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)
The PGA -Disease Activity  will be conducted to assess the subject's cur rent disease 
activity , taking into consideration both arthritis and psoriasis activity , independent of the 
subject's self -assessment, using a 0 –10 NRS, anchored at either end b y opposite 
adjectives.  
The assessor is not required to be independent but should be a qualified medical

Psoriasis Assessments
Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI)47
The PASI  is a measure of psoriasis severit y.  Four anatomic sites –head, upper 
extremities, trunk, and lower extremities – are assessed for ery thema, induration and 
desquamation using a 5 -point scale.  Based on the extent of lesions in a given anatomic 
site, the area affected is assigned a numerical value.
Since the head, upper extremities, trunk and lower extremities correspond to 
approximately  10, 20, 30 and 40% of bo dy surface area, respectivel y; the PASI  score is 
calculated using the formula:
1. PASI  = 0.1(E h+ Ih+ D h)Ah+ 0.2(E u+ Iu+ D u)Au+ 0.3(E t+ It+ D t)At + 0.4(E l+ Il
+ D l)Al
Where E, I, D , and A denote ery thema, induration, desquamation, and area, respectiv ely, 
and h, u, t , and l denote head, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities, 
respectivel y.  PASI scores range from 0.[ADDRESS_895872] possible degree.
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_620902] 3 or less represent mild disease, scores over 3 and up and including 
15represent moderate disease and scores over 15 are considered to be associated with 
severe disease.
The assessor should be an independent qualified medical professional.
Body Surface Area (BSA) – Psoriasis
The subject's right or left hand should be selected as the measuring device.  For purposes 
of clinical estimation, the total surface of the palm plus five digits will be assumed to be 
approximately  equivalent to 1%.  Measurement of the total ar ea of involvement is aided 
by [CONTACT_663507].   
Upadacitinib

The assessor should be an independent qualified medical professional.
Static I nvestigator Global Ass essment (sIGA)
The sIGA is a 5 point score ranging from 0 to 4, based on the investigator's assessment of 
the average elevation, erythema, and scaling of all psoriatic lesions.
The assessment is considered "static" which refers to the patients disease state at the time 
of the assessments, without comparison to an y of the patient's previous disease states, 
whether at Baseline or at a previous visit.
A lower score indicates less body coverage, with [ADDRESS_895874] clear.
The assessor shou ld be an independent qualified medical professional.
TJC and SJC Assessment
TJC Assessment
An assessment of 68 joints will be done for tenderness by  [CONTACT_663508].  Joint pain/tenderness will be classified as:  present, abse nt or no 
assessment.  Joints injected with corticosteroid will be considered non -evaluable for 
90days from the time of the injection.
The assessor should be an independent qualified medical professional.
SJC Assessment
An assessment of [ADDRESS_895875] ylitis
Leeds Dactylitis Index (LDI47)
This evaluation will be conducted to assess the presence or absence of dactylitis in all 
20of the subject's digits.  The assessment should begin with visual inspect ion of the hands 
and feet.  For each pair of digits in which one or both digits appear dact ylitic, the 
circumference of the affected digits (both right and left side) will be assessed using a 
dactylometer.  Additionally , the affected digit pairs will be as sessed for tenderness b y 
squeezing the digital shaft mid- way between the metacarpophalangeal and proximal 
interphalangeal joints and will be recorded as tenderness, yes or no.  Tenderness should 
not be assessed b y squeezing the joint lines.  Digits injecte d with corticosteroid will be 
considered non- evaluable for 90 day s from the time of the injection.  If a digit is missing 
and its contralateral digit is dactylitic, "digit absent" will be recorded for the missing digit.  
For an y digit without an available dacy lometer measurement the standard reference value 
will be utilized in calculation of the L DI.  The standard reference values will not be 
entered into the eCRF.  A dact ylometer will be provided to sites for use.
The assessor should be an independent qual ified medical professional.
Enthesitis
Leeds Enthesitis Index (LEI)
This evaluation will be conducted to assess the presence or absence of enthesitis at 
3bilateral sites.  Tenderness on examination is recorded as either present, absent, or not 
assessed fo r each of the 6 sites, for an overall score range of 0 –6.  Enthesitis sites 
injected with corticosteroid will be considered non -evaluable for [ADDRESS_895876] 2016 -004152 -30

Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada (SPARCC) Enthesitis Index
This evaluation will be conducted to assess the presence or absence of enthesitis at 
9bilateral sites.  Tenderness on examination is recorded as either present, absent, or not 
assesse d for each of the 18 sites.  For scoring purposes, the inferior patella and tibial 
tuberosity  are considered to be one site due to their anatomical proximity  the overall score 
range is 0 – 16.  Enthesitis sites injected with corticosteroid will be consider ed 
non-evaluable for [ADDRESS_895877] investigator.
[IP_ADDRESS] Optional Samples for Exploratory  Research and Validation 
Studies
Subjects will have the option to provide samples for explora tory research and validation 
studies.  Subjects may  still participate in the main study  even if they  decide not to 
participate in the optional collection of samples for exploratory research/validation 
studies.
Exploratory  research can help to improve our u nderstanding of how individuals respond 
to drugs and our ability  to predict which subjects would benefit from receiving specific 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  In addition, exploratory  research may  help to improve our understanding of 
how to diagnose and assess/monitor PsA b y assessing associations between disease 
characteristics, outcomes data and biomarkers of interests.

5.6 Discussion and Justification of Study  Design
5.6.1 Discussion of Study  Design and Choice of Control Groups
This study  includes two periods.
Period 1 is 56 -weeks in duration and includes a 24 week randomized, double -blind, 
parallel -group , placebo -controlled period followed by  [CONTACT_33018] 32 weeks of blinded 
treatment (Weeks 24 – 56).  Period [ADDRESS_895906] an inadequate response to biologic DMARDs

were selected as they are expected to demonstrate efficacy  in the treatment of patients 
with PsA while limiting potential drug -related effects on laboratory  parameters (e.g., 
hemoglobin).  Doses of 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD are the doses tha t are currently  being 
evaluated in Phase 3 trials in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  The doses being evaluated in the 
RA Phase 3 trials are considered appropriate for investigation in PsA as (1) effects of 
upadacitinib on tender and swollen joints, markers of inflammation, and ACR responses 
are expected to be similar in RA and PsA; and (2) proof of concept has been demonstrated 
with another JAK inhibitor (tofacitanib) at the doses that are efficacious in RA.  I n 
addition, in RA the plateau for efficacy  was achi eved by  [CONTACT_620969] 30 mg 
QD, indicating that higher doses may  not provide greater therapeutic benefit.
Results from two Phase 2b trials in subjects with RA with the upadacitinib immediate -
release capsule formulation indicate that all evaluated doses (3 mg BID, 6 mg BID, 
12mgBID, 18 mg BID, and 24 mg QD) were generall y well tolerated and without 
unexpected safet y concerns.  The Phase 2 dose -response and exposure -response results in 
RA show that the 6 mg BID dose approaches the plateau of effic acy, and increasing the 
dose to 12 mg BID appears to result in some incremental efficacy benefit, particularl y in 
the more refractory  subjects with inadequate response or intolerance to anti -TNF biologic 
therap y.  Therefore, upadacitinib exposures associat ed with 6 mg BID and 12 mg BID 
were selected as the target exposures to evaluate in Phase 3 trials in RA.
In order to enhance patients' compliance and to provide a more convenient dosing 
regimen than BID administration, [COMPANY_013] developed a once -daily tablet formulation 
which will be used in the current stud y.
A bioavailability  study  has demonstrated that 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD regimens of the 
once -daily tablet formulation provide equivalent daily AUC and comparable C max, and 
Cminto 6 mg BID and 12 mg BID, re spectivel y, of the immediate -release capsule 
formulation used in Phase 2 studies in RA.
The mean exposures (AUC and C max) for the highest dose that will be evaluated in this 
study  (30 mg QD) are predicted to be lower than the exposures associated with the  
Upadacitinib
M15 -[ADDRESS_895912] level in the 9 -month GLP preclinical toxicology study  in dogs

6.1.1 Definitions
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event
An AE is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily  have a 
causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease 
temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not 
the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  An y 
worsening of a pre -existing condition or illness is considered an AE.  Worsening in 
severit y of a reported AE should be reported as a new AE.  Laboratory abnormalitie s and 
changes in vital signs are considered to be AEs only  if they  result in discontinuation from 
the study , necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, and/or if the investigator considers 
them to be AEs.
Expected manifestations of PsA (i.e., psoriasis, joint pain and swelling, dacty litis, 
enthesitis, etc.) are not to be recorded as AEs unless the manifestation is considered to be 
a disease flare (worsening) of the underlying condition. 
An elective surgery /procedure scheduled to occur during a stud y wil l not be considered an 
AE if the surgery /procedure is being performed for a pre -existing condition and the 
surgery /procedure has been pre -planned prior to study  entry .  However, if the pre -existing 
condition deteriorates unexpectedly  during the study  (e.g. , surgery  performed earlier than 
planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery /procedure 
is being done will be considered an AE.
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious A dverse Events
If an AE meets an y of the following criteria, it is to be reported to [COMPANY_013] as a SAE 
within [ADDRESS_895916]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  This 
does not include an emergency  room visit or admission to an 
outpatient facility .
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or an y anomaly that 
results in fetal loss.
Persistent or 
Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially 
interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject.  
Disability  is not intended to include experiences of relativel y 
minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma 
(e.g., sprained ankle).
Important Medical 
Event Requiring 
Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to 
Prevent Serious 
OutcomeAn important medical event that may  not be immediately  
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but based 
on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the 
outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life -threatening, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n, prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital 
anomaly , or persistent or significant disability /incapacity ).  
Additionally , any elective or spontaneous abortion or 
stillbirth is considered an important medical event.  Examples 
of such events include allerg ic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency  or 
drug abuse.
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.

6.1.2 Adverse Event Severity
When criteria are available, events should be graded as described in the National Cancer 
Institute Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version 5.0), which 
can be accessed at:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm#ctc.  If 
guidance for specific events is not available grading should be as follows:  
Mild (Grade 1):  as ymptomatic or mild sy mptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated.

Moderate (Grade 2):  minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL).  (Instrumental ADL refer to 
preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money, 
etc.).
Severe (Grade 3 – 5): 
●Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately  life-threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_663487]; disabling; limiting 
self care ADL (Self care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, 
feeding self, using t he toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden);
●Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent interv ention indicated;
●Grade 5: Death related to AE.
6.1.3 Relationship to Study Drug
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the AE to 
the use of stud y drug:
Reasonable Possibility After consideration of factors including timing of the 
event, biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and 
potential alternative causes, there is sufficient evidence 
(information) to suggest a causal relationship.
No Reasonable Possibility After consideration of factors including timing of the 
event, biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and 
potential alternative causes, there is insufficient
evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship.
For causality  assessments, events ass essed as having a reasonable possibility  of being 
related to the stud y drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no 
reasonable possibility  of being related to study  drug will be considered "not associated."  
In addition, when the investigator has not reported a causalit y or deemed it not assessable, 
[COMPANY_013] will consider the event associated.

6.1.7 Toxicity  Management
The toxicity  management of the AEs including AESI s consists of safet y monitoring 
(review of AEs on an ongoing basis, and periodic/ad hoc review of safet y issues by  a 
safet y data monitoring committee), interruption of study  drug dosing with appropriate 
clinical management if applicable, and discontinuation of the subjects from study  drug.  
The management of specific AEs and laboratory  parameters is described below.
For subjects who have had study  drug discontinued and are instead on standard of care 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], these toxicity  management requirements do not apply  (including alerts from the 
central lab) and an y intolerability  to standard of care therapi[INVESTIGATOR_372877] b y the 
prescribing ph ysician.

Serious Inf ections:   Subjects should be closely monitored for the development of signs 
and sy mptoms of infection during and after treatment with study  drug.  Study  drug should 
be interrupted if a subject develops a serious infection or an opportunistic infection.  A 
subject who develops a new infection during treatment with study  drug should undergo 
prompt diagnostic testing appropriate for an immunocompromised subject.  As 
appropriate, antimicrobial therap y should be initiated, and the subject should be closel y 
monitored.  Re -challenge with study  drug may  occur once the infection has been 
successfull y treated.  Subjects who develop active TB must be permanentl y discontinued 
from study  drug.  See Section 5.5.[ADDRESS_895927] for 
study  drug interruption guidelines.
Herpes zoster:   If a subject develops herpes zoster, consider temporaril y interrupting 
study  drug until t he epi[INVESTIGATOR_176378].
Gastrointestinal Perforation:   Subjects presenting with the onset of signs or symptoms 
of a gastrointestinal perforation should be evaluated promptly for earl y diagnosis and 
treatment.  Gastrointestinal perforation is defined as acute, spontaneous perforation of the 
gastrointestinal tract that requires inpatient medical care or urgent surgical intervention.   If 
the diagnosis of gastrointestinal perforation is confirmed (other than due to appendicitis or 
mechanical injury ), the subject m ust be discontinued from stud y drug.
Cardiovascular Events (MACE):   Subjects presenting with potential cardiovascular 
events should be carefully monitored.  These events will be reviewed and adjudicated b y 
an independent Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee in a blinded manner.
Malignancy:   Subjects who develop malignancy other than NMSC or carcinoma in- situ 
of the cervix must be discontinued from study drug.  Information including 
histopathological results should be queried for the confirmation of the dia gnosis.  Periodic 
skin examination is recommended for subjects who are at increased risk for skin cancer.

Muscle -related symptoms:  If a subject experiences s ymptoms suggestive of my ositis or 
rhabdom yolysis, consider checking CPK and aldolase with clinical management and/or 
study  drug interruption as deemed appropriate b y the treating ph ysician.
Thrombosis Events:   Subjects who develop s ymptoms of thrombosis should be promptly  
evaluated and treated appropriatel y.  If the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis, p ulmonary  
embolus or non- cardiac, non -neurologic arterial thrombosis is confirmed, the subject must 
be discontinued from study  drug.
COVID -19:  Interrupt study  drug in subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID -19
infection. Consider interrupting study d rug in subjects with signs and/or s ymptoms and

ECG Abnormality:   Subjects must be discontinued from study  drug for an ECG change 
considered clinically  significant and with a reasonable possibility  of relationship to study  
drug OR a confirmed absolute QTcF value > [ADDRESS_895930] Laboratory Abnormalities:  For an y given laboratory 
abnormality , the Investigator should assess the subject, appl y the standard of care for 
medica l evaluation and treatment following an y local guidelines.  Specific toxicity  
management guidelines for abnormal laboratory  values are described in Table 4and may  
require an appropriate supplemental eCRF be completed.  For subjects with ongoing 
laboratory  abnormalities which require data entry  into an eCRF, an additional eCRF 
related to subsequent laboratory  abnormalities is only  required if the subject has relevant 
changes in history  (e.g., new onset signs or s ymptoms) or laboratory  values which have 
returned to normal reference range or its Baseline value followed b y subsequent 
laboratory  abnormalities meeting toxicity  guidelines (considered a new even t). All 
abnormal laboratory  tests that are considered clinically significant b y the Investigator will 
be followed to a satisfactory  resolution.  If a repeat test is required per Table 4, the repeat 
testing must occur as soon as possible.

AST or ALT 
(Continued)Subjects who meet any of the above criteria should be evaluated for an 
alternative etiology of the ALT or AST elevation and managed as medical ly 
appropriate.  If applicable, the alternative etiology should be documented in 
the eCRF. If ALT or AST values return to the normal reference range or its 
Baseline value, study drug may be restarted.  If restarting study drug, 
documentation should includ e reason that rechallenge is expected to be safe.  
If after clinically appropriate evaluation, no alternative etiology for ALT or

[IP_ADDRESS] Primary  Efficacy  Variable
Analy sis of the primary  endpoint will be conducted on the FAS based on treatment as 
randomized.  Comparison of the primary endpoint will be made between each 
upadacitinib dose group and the combined placebo groups using the Cochran -Mantel-
Haenszel test adjusting for main stratification factors.  For the p rimary  analy sis, Non -

the combined placebo group. 
For binary  endpoints, frequencies and percentages will be reported for each treatment 
group.  Simi lar analy ses as for the primary  endpoint will be conducted.
For continuous endpoints, the mean, standard deviation, median, and range will be 
reported for each treatment group.  Pairwise comparisons between each upadacitinib dose 
group and the combined placebo groups will be carried out using Mixed -Effects Model 
Repeated Measures (MMRM) with fixed effects of treatment group, visit, treatment -by-

will follow a pre -specified α transfer path which includes downstream transfer along the 
endpoint sequence within each dose as well as cross -dose transfer.  More details of the 
graphical procedure will be specified in th e SAP.
[IP_ADDRESS] Imputation Methods
The following methods will be used for missing data imputation:
Observed Cases (OC):   The OC anal ysis will not impute values for missing evaluations, 
and thus a subject who does not have an evaluation on a scheduled visit will be excluded 
from the OC anal ysis for that visit.
Non- Responder Imputation (NRI):   NRI applies to binary  endpoints only.  I n NRI 
analysis, subjects who prematurel y discontinue study drug will be considered 
nonresponders for visits after discontinuation.
Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM):   The MMRM includes treatment, visit, 
and treatment -by-visit interaction as fixed effects, and baseline as covariate.
The NRI approach will serve as the primary  anal ysis approach for binary endpoints.  
Analy sis for key  binar y endpoints will also be repeated using OC.  The mixed model 
repeated measures (MMRM) will serve as the primary anal ysis for continuous key  
secondary  endpoints.  A Missing Not At Random (MNAR) model that varies assumptions 
for the missing data in active tr eatment groups and placebo groups may be used as a 
sensitivity  anal ysis for important continuous endpoints to account for potential deviation 
from the missing at random assumption.

Events (CTCAE).  The shift tables will tabulate the number and percentage of subjects 
with baseline and post -baseline values b y the above categories.  
Descriptive summary  and listings will be provide d for potentially  clinically  significant 
laboratory  values and vital signs.
8.1.6 Pharmacokinetic and Exposure -Response A nalyses
Individual upadacitinib plasma concentrations at each study visit will be tabulated and 
summarized with appropriate statistical methods.
Data from this study  may be combined with data from other studies for the population PK 
and exposure -response analy ses.  Population PK and exp osure -response analy ses of onl y 
data from this study  may  not be conducted.  The following general methodology  will be 
used for the population PK and exposure -response anal yses.
Population PK analy ses will be performed using the actual sampling time relativ e to 
dosing.  PK models will be built using a non -linear mixed -effects modeling approach with 
NONMEM software (Version 7, or a higher version).  The CL /F and V/F of upadacitinib
will be the PK parameters of major interest in the anal yses.  If necessary , other 
parameters, including the parameters describing absorption characteristics, may  be fixed if 
useful in the anal ysis.  The relationship between the conditional estimates of CL/F and 
V/F values with onl y potentially ph ysiologicall y relevant or clinically meaningful

covariates (such as subject age, sex, body weight, concomitant medications, laboratory 
markers of hepatic of renal function, etc.) will be explored using stepwise forward 
selection backward elimination approach.  Relationships between upadacitin ibexposure 
and clinical observations will be explored.  The effect of meaningful covariates (e.g., bod y 
weight) on the exposure -response relationships for efficacy measures (e.g., ACR and 
PASI ) in PsA patients will be evaluated.
Results of the PK and expo sure- response analy ses may  be summarized in a separate 
report, rather than in the CSR.  Additional analy ses will be performed if useful and 
appropriate.

difference in ACR20 response rate (assuming a placebo ACR20 response rate of 20%).  It 
will also provide at least 90% power for the majority  of the key  secondary  endpoints.  All 
power and sample size calculations are performed at two- sided signif icance level of 0.025 
and accounting for a 10% dropout rate.
8.3 Randomization Methods
Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 2:2:1:1 ratio per study design diagram Figure 1.
Randomization will be stratified b y extent of psoriasis ( ≥ 3% bod y surface area [BSA] or 
< 3% BSA), current use of at least [ADDRESS_895950], and number of prior failed (had an 
inadequate response to) biologic DMARDs (1 vs > 1), except for sub jects from Japan, for 
which randomization will be stratified b y extent of psoriasis ( ≥ 3% bod y surface area 
[BSA] or < 3% BSA) only .  See Section 5.5.[ADDRESS_895951] 2016 -004152 -30

9.0 Ethics
9.1 Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) or Institutional Review 
Board (IRB)
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requires that the clinical protocol, an y protocol 
amendments, the Investigator's Brochure, the informed consent and all other forms of 
subject information related to the study  (e.g., advertisements used to recruit subjects) and 
any other necessary  documents be reviewed by [CONTACT_18369]/IRB.  The IEC/IRB will review the 
ethical, scientific and medical appropriateness of the study before it is conducted.  
IEC/IRB approval of the protocol, informed consent and subject information and/or 
advertising, as relevant, will be obtained prior to the authorization of drug shipment to a 
study  site.
Any amendments to the protocol will require IEC/I RB appro val prior to implementation 
of an y changes made to the study design.  The investigator will be required to submit, 
maintain and archive study  essential documents according to ICH GCP.
Any SAEs that meet the reporting criteria, as dictated by  [CONTACT_4159], will be 
reported to both responsible Ethics Committees and Regulatory Agencies, as required b y 
local regulations.  During the conduct of the stud y, the investigator should promptly  
provide written reports (e.g., ICH Expedited Reports, and an y addition al reports required 
by [CONTACT_427]) to the IEC/I RB of any  changes that affect the conduct of the study  
and/or increase the risk to subjects.  Written documentation of the submission to the 
IEC/IRB should also be provided to [COMPANY_013].
9.[ADDRESS_895952] of the Study
The study  will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, International Conference on 
Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines, applicable regulations and guidelines governing clinical 
study  conduct and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of 
Helsinki.  Responsibilities of the clinical investigator are specified in Appendix A.

include alternative methods for assessments (e.g., phone contacts or virtual site visits), 
alternative locations for data collection (e.g., use of a local lab instead of a central lab), 
and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_100638]/or supplies direct to subjects to ensure continuity 
of treatment where allowed.  In all cases, these alternative measures must be allowed b y 
local regulations and permitted by  [CONTACT_1744]/IEC.  Investigators should notify  [COMPANY_013] if a ny 
urgent safet y measures are taken to protect the subjects against an y immediate hazard.
9.[ADDRESS_895954] Information and Consent
The investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the 
subject, and answer all questions regarding thi s study .  Prior to an y stud y-related 
screening procedures being performed on the subject, the informed consent statement will 
be reviewed and signed and dated b y the subject, the person who administered the 
informed consent, and any other signatories according to local requirements.  A cop y of 
the informed consent form will be given to the subject and the original will be placed in 
the subject's medical record.  An entry  must also be made in the subject's dated source 
documents to confirm that informed cons ent was obtained prior to any study -related 
procedures and that the subject received a signed copy.
Information regarding incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions for 
treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation 
in the study  can be found in the informed consent form.
Samples for exploratory  research/validation studies will only  be collected if the subject 
has voluntarily  signed and dated the separate written consent for exploratory 
research/validation studies, approved b y an IEC/IRB, after the nature of the testing has 
been explained and the subject has had an opportunity  to ask questions.  The separate 
written consent must be signed before the exploratory research/validation studies samples  
Upadacitinib
M15 -[ADDRESS_895955] does not consent to the exploratory  
research/validation studies, it will not impact the subject's participation in the study.
In the event a subject withdraws from the main study , optional exploratory  
research/validation samples will continue to be stored and anal yzed unless the subject 
specificall y withdraws consent for the optional samples.  If consent is withdrawn for the 
optional sampling, the subject must inform their study  doctor, and once [COMPANY_013] is 
informed, the optional samples will be destroyed.  However, if the subject withdraws 
his/her consent and the samples have alread y been tested, those results will still remain as 
part of the overall research data.
In cases of state -of emergency  or pandemic s ituations, in addition to the study informed
consent additional verbal consent may  be obtained prior to adaptations or substantial
changes in study conduct, according to local regulations (e.g., labs taken at a local facility,
direct to patient courier study  drug delivery , home or virtual study  visits, etc.).

c. Obtain informed consent prior to performing any study related procedures.
d. Note herpes zoster, herpes zoster vaccination and hepatitis B vaccination status in medical history.
e. Blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature, body weight, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521] y rate should be performed before blood draws are performed.
f. Height will be measured at Screening visit only (with shoes off).
g. For concomitant medications, at Week 36 (after Week [ADDRESS_895990] been performed), per Investigator judgment, may add non-biologic DMARDs (concomitant use of 
up to 2 non -biologic DMARDs, except the combination of MTX and leflunomide), or increase DMARD dose.

h. For Period 1 (up to and including Week 56 visit), a full physical exam is required at the visits indicated.  A symptom -directed physical exam may be performed when 
necessary.  For Period 2 (after Week 56), a full physical exam is required approximately every 24 weeks (Wk 80, Wk 104, and W k 128) and at the Wk 152 visit.  A symptom -
directed physical exam may be perfo rmed when necessary.
i. For subjects with a normal ECG taken within 90 days of Screening, a repeat ECG at Screening will not be required; provided al l protocol -required documentation is available, 
and nothing has changed in the subject's health status sinc e the time of the test that warrants a repeat test.  If required by [CONTACT_51016], an annual ECG will be 
performed.  
j. The screening chest x -ray will not be required if a subject had a previously normal chest -x-ray  (posterior -anterior an d lateral views) within [ADDRESS_895992]'s health status since the time of the test that warrants a repeat test (refer to 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] for specific requirements).
k. Obtain a chest x -ray annually for subjects with one or more TB risk factors as identified by [CONTACT_176418], subjects l iving in areas endemic for TB, and subjects 
with a newly positive QuantiFERON -TB Gold test (and/or [COMPANY_003] skin test) after baseline.  In the case a subject prematurely discontinues from the study drug a che st x ray 
should not be performed if it has been less than [ADDRESS_895993] a full set of x -rays of both hands and both feet as a single image could fulfill this criterion.  If no prior x -rays (images and/or report) are available, 
subjects are required to have x-rays of both hands and feet at screening in order to document all items of the CASPAR criteria.  If prior x -rays are available, but do not 
demonstrate radiographic evidence of juxta -articular new bone formation, subjects may have repeat x -rays of both ha nds and feet at screening if at least [ADDRESS_895994] is necessary (pregnancy is an exclusion 
criterion).  If still borderline ≥ [ADDRESS_895995] can be enrolled into the study.  Refer to 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] Study Procedures Pregnancy Test for additiona l details.
n. For all female subjects of childbearing potential, collect urine for pregnancy test at Baseline and all subsequent visits.  M ore frequent pregnancy tests will be performed 
throughout the study if required per local/country requirements.  If u rine pregnancy test (which is performed at the site) is negative, begin or continue dosing.  If urine 
pregnancy test is positive, withhold dosing and perform a serum pregnancy test.  Pregnant subjects must discontinue from stud y drug treatment.  Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS]
Study Procedures Pregnancy Test for additional details.
o. If time between visits is longer than [ADDRESS_895996] that will be ana lyzed at the central laboratory. A pregnant or 
breastfeeding female will not be eligible for participation or continuation in this study.  The monthly at home tests between scheduled on -site visits are to occur at Weeks 40,

Prophylaxis .
r. Minimum [ADDRESS_895998] when necessary, due to unforeseen circumstances, the non -fasting status will be recorded in study source documentation.
s. Starting from Baseline (Day 1) the hs -CRP results will not be reported to the Sponsor, Investigator, study site personnel, or the subject.  For safety evaluations of signs and 
symptoms of infection and management of adverse events, the investigator may locally test procalcitonin.  Results of tests su ch as hs -CRP, and procalcito nin may be blunted 
in subjects taking a JAK inhibitor, thereby [CONTACT_372890] a possible safety assessment or adverse event management.  Any local 
hs-CRP, CRP, or serial procalcitonin tests reported to the in vestigator until a subject is known to receive upadacitinib or until treatment allocation is unblinded will be 
recorded as protocol deviations.  Samples for advanced lipid testing may be stored for batch testing and may include Apo A1, Apo B, and/or other lipid particle tests.
t. If required by [CONTACT_51016], subjects who initiate or increase dose of MTX during the study should undergo ALT, AST, creatinine and CBC testing every 
4weeks for a [ADDRESS_895999]'s health and subject should receive or be referred for clinical care promptly.  A s ubject will not be eligi ble for study participation if test 
results indicate a positive HIV infection.  [COMPANY_013] will not receive results from the testing and will not be made aware of an y positive result.
w. For Japan or where mandated by [CONTACT_5277]: subjects with HBs Ab+ and/or HBc Ab+ and negative HBV DNA at Screening should have HBV DNA PCR testing 
performed approximately every [ADDRESS_896000] has a history o f HBV vaccine and HBs Ab+ and HBc

x. At Week [ADDRESS_896001] PK samples at Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, Week 20, 
Week 24, Week 32, Week 56, and at PD visit only for subjects who prematurely discontinue from study drug treatmen t prior to Week 56.  No PK sample collection is 
required at Week 152.
z. PASI, BSA -Ps, sIGA, and SAPS are to be done at Week 80, Week 104, and Week 128 (every 24 weeks after Week 56).
aa. Collect serious AEs and protocol -related nonserious AEs that occur a fter a subject signs the informed consent; prior to the first dose of study drug.

Appendix F. The CASPAR Criteria
To meet the CASPAR (ClASsification criteria for Psoriatic ARthritis) criteria,* a patient 
must have inflammatory  articular disease (joint, spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], or entheseal) with ≥ 3 points from 
the following 5 categories:
1. Evidence of current psoriasis, a personal history  of psoriasis, or a famil y history of 
psoriasis (one of a, b, c).
a.Current psoriasis is define d as psoriatic skin or scalp disease present today as 
judged b y a rheumatologist or dermatologist.†
b.A personal history  of psoriasis is defined as a history  of psoriasis that may  be 
obtained from a patient, family  physician, dermatologist, rheumatologist, o r 
other qualified health care provider.
c.A family  history  of psoriasis is defined as a history of psoriasis in a first -or 
second -degree relative according to a patient report.
2. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_663492] d ystrophy  including ony choly sis, pi[INVESTIGATOR_22940], and hyperkeratosis 
observed on current ph ysical examination.
3. A negative test result for the presence of rheumatoid factor b y any method except 
latex but preferabl y by [CONTACT_269300]-linked immunosorbent assay  or nephelometry , 
according to the local laboratory  referenc e range.
4. Either current dact ylitis, defined as swelling of an entire digit, or a history  of 
dactylitis recorded b y a rheumatologist.
5. Radiographic evidence of juxtaarticular new bone formation, appearing as 
ill-defined ossification near joint margins (but e xcluding osteoph yte formation) on 
plain radiographs of the hand or foot.
*The CASPAR criteria have specificit y of 98.7% and sensitivity  of 91.4%.
† Current psoriasis is assigned a score of 2; all other features are assigned a score of 1.

or two highl y effective methods, refer to Section 5.2.4 ), that are effective fr om 
Study  Day  [ADDRESS_896009] dose of oral stud y drug.
Section 5.2.4, Contraception Recommendations
Contraception Recommen dation for Females
A woman who is postmenopausal or permanentl y surgically  sterile (bilateral 
oophorectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_176366] h ysterectomy ) is not considered to be a woman 
of childbearing potential and is not required to follow contraception recom mendations.  
Postmenopausal is defined as:
●Age ≥ 55 y ears with no menses for 12 or more months without an alternative 
medical cause; or
●Age < 55 years with no menses for 12 or more months without an alternative 
medical cause AND an FSH level > 40 mIU/mL.
If the female subject is < 55 y ears of age:
●AND has had no menses for ≥ 12 months AND has no history  of permanent 
surgical sterilization (defined above), FSH should be tested at Screening.
●If FSH is not tested, it is assumed that the subject is of childbe aring potential 
and protocol- specified contraception is required.
●If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent with post -menopausal status, 
contraception is not required. 
Upadacitinib
M15 -[ADDRESS_896010] 2016 -004152 -30
157
●If the FSH is tested and the result is consistent with pre -menopausal status, 
contraception is required, and a serum pregnancy  test must be performed (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] pregnancy test).
For a female subject at any  age:
●Female subjects with menses within the past 12 months are of childbearing 
potential and FSH is therefore not required but contraception is required.
●Female subjects who are surgically  sterile (defined above) are not of 
childbearing potential and therefore no FSH testing or contraception is 
required.
A woman who does not meet the definition of postmenopausal or permanently  surgicall y 
sterile is considered of childbearing potential and is required to practice two forms of 
contraception.  This includes one form of highl y effective contraception and one effective 
method of contraception or two highl y effective methods.  That is effective from Study 
Day 1 (or earlier) through at least [ADDRESS_896011] dose of oral study  drug.
●Highl y effective methods:
○Hormonal c ontraceptives started at least 2 months prior to randomization 
(e.g., combined [estrogen and progestogen containing] [oral contraceptives, 
patch, vaginal ring, injectables, and implants); 
○Intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine s ystem (IUS); 
○Vasectom y and tubal ligation.
●Effective methods:
○Barrier methods of contraception (e.g., male condom, female condom, 
cervical cap, diaphragm, contraceptive sponge)
○Note:  The proper use of diaphragm or cervical cap includes use of 
spermicide and is considered one barrier method.  The cervical cap and 
contraceptive sponge are less effective in parous women.  The use of 
spermicide alone is not considered a suitable barrier method for 
contraception.  When used consistently  and correctly , "double barrier" 
methods of cont raception (e.g., male condom with diaphragm, male

highl y effective contraception methods described above.  Male and female 
condoms should not be used together as they can tear or beco me damaged.

Contraception Recommendation for Females
A woman who is postmenopausal or per manentl y surgically  sterile (bilateral 
oophorectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_176366] h ysterectomy ) is not considered to be a woman 
of childbearing potential and is not required to follow contraception recommendations.  
Postmenopausal is defined as:

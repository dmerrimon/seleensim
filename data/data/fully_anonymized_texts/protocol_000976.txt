 [ADDRESS_343115] Summary  
 
Patients undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are at high risk 
for deconditionin g and functional decline. Current research provides support for 
early mobilization of patients undergoing ECMO, and indicates that activity in this 
population is safe and feasible. The timeframe prior to mobilization depends on a 
number of factors, and can  range significantly between different patient groups. One 
such factor is strength.  
 
While active lower extremity exercise is common in the pre -ambulation phase of 
those receiving ECMO, the type of exercise selected varies and little is know about 
the ben efit of weight -bearing  closed chain  exercise during this pre -ambulatory 
period. In order to evaluate this specific form of exercise, we will compare outcomes 
of patients who complete lower extremity exercise without loading to those who 
complete loaded exe rcises.  
 
All participants in this study will progress through pre -existing Ambulatory ECMO 
Guidelines, established and currently in use at the University of Minnesota Medical 
Center, Fairview. Participants will be randomized into either group A or B. Grou p A 
will receive specific closed chain lower extremity squat exercises via the MOVEO XP 
Mobile Hi -Lo Platform System. MOVEO is an exercise leg press device. The MOVEO 
exercises will be added during parts C and D of  the ECMO Early Mobilization 
Protocol listed below. Group B will progress through the ECMO Early Mobilization 
Protocol without the addition leg exercises on the MOVEO.  
 
Collecting and analyzing data on weight -bearing lower extremity exercise in this 
patient population will allow us to obtain important information on ways to address 
weakness associated with ECMO treatment, particularly in those who are unable to 
engage in bipedal ambulation.

during the pre -ambulation phase in patients undergoing ECMO. Outcome measures 
will be categorized as either functional or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_78515] . Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_281480]: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_598], intensive care unit days, days on ECMO, days on mechanical 
ventilation, length of time from physical therapy evaluation to initial am bulation, 
and discharge disposition . Func tional outcome measu res include: Leg strength, grip 
strength, [ADDRESS_343117], Functional Status Score for the Intensive Care 
Unit (FSS -ICU), and the Richmon d Agitation and Sedation Scale  (RASS) .  
 
 
Background & Significance  
 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_281481] p ersons undergoing ECMO has involved levels of medical  sedation 
to the point of unresponsiveness to outside stimuli. Past treatment theories have 
identified  numerous contraindications for mobi lization (Hodgson et al 2014). 
Recent a dvances in ECMO cannulation site (veno -venous) now allow  these patients 
to safely mobilize. A growing body of evidence has suggested that mobilizing while 
undergoing ECMO is safe, feasible and improves both medical and functional 
outcomes. For example, Abrams et al. (2014 ) found that physical therapy  (PT)  may 
increase extracorporeal gas exchange efficiency , and that patients may be  earlier  
eligible for extubation  as a result of PT . A study by [CONTACT_281498]. was suggestive of 
improved post -lung transplant recovery time when patients  participated in active 
rehabilitation while on ECMO.  A more recent study in [ADDRESS_343118] ($60,204), post -transplant ICU cost 
($104,939) and reduction in total cost compared with non -ambulatory ECMO 
subjects ($32,133).  
 
Ambulation, while safe and effective, may not be feasible early on for some critically 
ill patients. In these cases, exercise is often a pre -ambulatory intervention. Selection 
and impact assessment of open versus clos ed chain exercise has been well 
documented in literature related to recovery after knee injury , but to a lesser degree 
in those who are immobile due to critical illness . Studies  have reported knee 
extensor atrophy during bed rest (Bamman 2000) and  functional benefit of 
specificity training (Morrissey, et. al 19 98), yet little  is known  about the functional 
effectiveness of loaded closed chain exercises as compared to the open chain 
exercises in t he critically ill  patient population.  
 
Coupled with known data reflective of muscle changes and strength loss with 
immobility (Puthucherary, et. al 2010), this study aims to broaden the treatment 
repertoire to include lower extremity closed chain muscle training (hip and knee 
exten sors) along with determining the  safety and feasibil ity of such an intervention 
for critically ill individuals undergoing ECMO.   
 
 
 [ADDRESS_343119] of closed -chain le g exercise in 
individuals undergoing ECMO.  
 
Aim 1: To determine if closed -chain leg exercise decreases the time to initial 
ambulation. We hypothesize  that adding leg exercise will decrease time to 
ambulation.  
 
Aim 2 : To determine the impact of closed chain leg exercise on functional ability. We 
hypothesize  that adding leg exercise  will improve functional outcomes when added 
to an existing early mobilization program.  
 
Aim 3 : To determine the effect of closed chain leg exercise on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_95209]. We 
hypothesize  that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_281482].

supi[INVESTIGATOR_281486] a lateral transfer across a 
slide board to facilitate ease of movement.  
 
Those in G roup A will participate in leg exercise on the Moveo duri ng item 4d of the 
ECMO protocol, whereby [CONTACT_281501] G roup B will complete standard exercise as listed 
in item 4d. Group A participants will use the Moveo until subjective report of leg 
fatigue. Participants will s elf-select the pace of their leg exercise  and the primary

 A paired t -test will be used to evaluated time to ambulation in Group A as 
compared to Group B.   
 
Aim 2 : Leg exercise on the Moveo will improve functional  outcomes.  
 There are [ADDRESS_343125] 
across time. To assess both factors, repeated measures ANOVA will be used.  
 
Aim 3:  Leg exercise on the Moveo will improve hospi[INVESTIGATOR_95209].  
 All hospi[INVESTIGATOR_95209], exc ept for discharge disposition, can be assessed 
between Group A and Group B by a paired t -test.  
 Discharge disposition, categorical data, will be analyzed via Chi -Square test.

 9 Potential Risks  
 
Lower Extremity Exercise : As with any new exercise program, muscle fatigue or 
mild soreness may occur in the [ADDRESS_343126].  
 
Mobilization Protocol : Subjects participating are undergoing ECMO due to 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_281492]. To maximize safety and minimize risks, the 
primary physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_281493]. [CONTACT_281509], Acute Care Surgery physician at the University of Minnesota 
Medical Center, Fairview, is the primary medical contact [CONTACT_281506]. [CONTACT_281510] is re sponsible for removing active physical therapy orders, as is any 
critical care physician, if an individual undergoing ECMO is no longer stable for 
mobilization or exercise. Orders will be verified daily, prior to physical therapy, by 
[CONTACT_281496][INVESTIGATOR_541].  
 
Adverse Event Reporting  
Subjects in this study are patients at the University of Minnesota Medical Center, 
Fairview. As a result, adverse events will be reported not only in the medical record 
of the subject, but also recorded  by [CONTACT_093].  
 
Any adverse event will be followed and assessed until it has been determined that 
the study treatment or participation is not the cause.  
 
Adverse Events  
 
Adverse events observed or reported will be recorded in the case histories of each 
participant to determi ne if:  
 
1. The event is directly related to the study and should be classified as a serious 
adverse event (SAE)  
2. A causal relationship exists between the adverse event effect and the 
investigational exercise/mobility program  
 
Any adverse event not determined to quality,  as a SAE will be reported to the IRB 
with the continuing review progress report.  
 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_9047] a SAE o ccurs, which is deemed by [CONTACT_281507], [CONTACT_281511],  to be a 
direct result from the study intervention, the study will be  put on hold and reviewed 
by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_281494].  
 
 [ADDRESS_343127] may still be used for data analysis. There is no co mpensation associated with

Study Title : Optimizing  SARS- COV- 2 Testing and Promotores Interventions to Serve Latinx Communities  
Protocol Number:  10032020.002.2  
Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_96371] D. Leve   
 
A. Introduction and Background  
SARS- CoV-2 is a high contagious virus that has infected millions of Americans and is 
disproportionately impacting the Latinx population. Nationally, Latinx people are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_121058]- 19 infections at  four times the rate of Whites . This disparity is notable in Oregon, where 
Latinxs represent approximately 44% of COVID -19 cases, while representing only about 13% of the 
state’s population. Therefore, there is an urgent need to reach Oregon’s Latinx community with 
public health and pr evention messages t hat are culturally- relevant, address community concerns, 
and are delivered through appropriate information channels in order to increase testing rates and ultimately, reduce the spread of infection and mortality rates.  
The overall goal of the proposed research is to implement a culturally -tailored community outreach 
and testing program to increase the reach, access, uptake, and impact of testing in Latinx 
communities in Oregon.  Our project has received funding  to provide SARS- CoV-2 testing across 
the state of Oregon  from two sponsors : National Institutes of Health (N IH) (EPCS #[ZIP_CODE] and 
EPCS #[ZIP_CODE] ) and O regon Health Authority (O HA) (EPCS #[ZIP_CODE]) . NIH funded events include a 
individual -level data collection  component (par ticipant survey) to address study aims. OHA funded 
events will not include any individual -level data collection, and will only collect de-identified 
protected health information .
 
B. Specific Aims/Study Objectives  
The overall goal  of our proposed research  is to implement a culturally -tailored community outreach 
and testing program  to increase the reach, access, uptake, and impact of testing in Latinx 
communities in Oregon. This project will fully integrate with the NIHRapid Acceleration of 
Diagnostics (RADx)  consortium and its Coordination and Data Collection Center (CDCC). With 
guidance and leadership from our Latinx Community and Scientific Advisory Board , we will launch 
the proposed testing program  which will result in [ADDRESS_135621] the following questions:  
1) Do culturally -informed interventions (‘Promotor es’) increase test rates and health behaviors?  
a. Community- level intervention to increase participation in testing: Evaluate 
whether ‘Promotor es de Salud ,’ a culturally -tailored outreach intervention that 
includes psychoeducation, information support, and motivational strategies to 
address barriers, results in more tests completed and more sites testing at full 
capacity, as compared to basic community -level outreach services.  
b. Individual -level booster intervention to change future health behavior: Examine 
whether a brief , individual -level ‘Promotor es de Salud’ intervention held during a 
testing event (compared to distribution of a pamphlet only) results in greater use 
of strategies that reduce transmission at the community and individual level. 
Individual moderators (e.g., substance use, perceived th reat, health literacy, 
social determinants) will also be examined. We further hypothesize that this intervention will increase futur e test rates through repeat testing visits and 
 
 Page 2 of 14 Version Date:  November 1 5, 2021  through ‘snowball’ recruitment of friends and family to attend future testing 
events.  
C. Methods, Materials and Analysis  
Overall Study Design :  We will p artner with community organizations to administer SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_135622] whether ‘ Promotor es,’ community health workers who 
deliver culturally -informed set of outreach, education, and engagement interventions, will result in 
an increase in testing utilization and health behaviors in Latinx communities.  
 
Randomization  will occur at the site level such that 18 sites will be randomized to receive the 
Promotor es intervention and 18 will be randomized to receive services as usual. Services as usual 
include outreach by [CONTACT_121071] -based organizations (fliers, radio ads, 
social media, etc.).  The promotores  intervention includes targeted outreach to Latinx community 
members and educational direct interactions with participants and distribution of a pamphlet, with 
the goal of increasing health behaviors and encouraging additional/future testing. The UO will 
provide support to community -based organizations to employ and train these promotores  to assist 
with recruitment. The promotores  will include Spanish speakers, across cultural contexts, living and 
working in, and intricately connected  to, the target community .

Data points to assess testing site utilization and the health behaviors will include the following:  
 
1. De-identified protected health information (from intake forms) from those who engaged in 
testing (age 3 and older)  
a. After testing occurs, researchers will have access to de -identified data prepared by [CONTACT_121073]’s CLIA laboratory. The data will include four protected health identifiers, site zip code, 
participant zip code, testing date , and SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_135623] of testing site addresses 
and testing date, that will be merged with the aggregate file provided by [CONTACT_121074] . 
 
 Page 3 of 14 Version Date:  November 1 5, 2021  2. Individual level surve y data, collected at  NIH- funded  testing events from a subset of 3,600 
adult participants (age 15 and older) . 
a. Surveys will contain information including demographic information, including address, 
phone number, and email. This is being collected t o link the HIPAA data that we are 
collecting from the UO CLIA laboratory, in addition to allowing researchers to see if 
individuals are getting tested in close proximity to their residence. Researchers are looking 
at population density of Latinx individuals in an area compared to the proportion of Latinx 
people who attend the testing events . Additionally, the survey will include information about 
health behaviors to prevent the spread of COVID -19. These data will be collected using an 
elect ronic survey that participants can complete on their smartphone, or using an iPad 
provided on site. If preferred by [CONTACT_2299], the survey may be completed on paper. If 
the participant prefers or as is needed, the survey items will be read by a field team 
member, who is bicultural and bilingual. Surveys will be available in Spanish and in English.  
b. Individuals who are willing to participate in the survey wil l be asked in the first survey how 
they prefer to complete the follow -up survey. They will be able to select to receive a text 
message  with a follow -up survey link,  email  with a follow -up survey link or a paper survey 
by [CONTACT_121075] a pre- paid envelope to return the survey,  one month later. For 
participants who prefer, the one -month survey will be conducted by [CONTACT_756]. Each  survey 
will take approximately  [ADDRESS_135624] of the study is now complete.  
4. Promotores activities. In addition to non -human subjects activities ( e.g., report ing on training, 
outreach activities and interactions with participants) , promotores  will be asked to complete two 
questionnaires to provide some demographic information , information about their personality 
traits (e.g., conscientiousness ), and feelings about participating as a Promotor/a on this project . 
They will be asked to  complete an electronic informed consent before participating in the 
interviews .  
a. The first survey will directly follow the promotores training and will ask basic demographic 
information and information on their personality traits. 
b. The second interview  will be in the format of a focus group and will ask questions about 
their experience as a promotor/a and their perspectives on the intervention.     
5. Community Based Organization general outreach activities . The executive director of each 
CBO that receives promotores funding will provide a monthly report on the general outreach strategies conducted by [CONTACT_121076]. This is a condition of receiving funding, but reports 
will be included in research reports such as peer reviewed journal articles.  
D. Research Population & Recruitment Methods  
We anticipate the sample to be comparable  with community demographics in each of the testing 
regions within the counties participating in this study. As we are specifically conducting outreach to 
encourage Latinx individuals to attend testing events, we expect the overall study population to be 
85% Hispanic and 15% non- Hispanic, with 84% of individuals identifying as Caucasian in both 
ethnic groups and the remaining 16% identifying as African American, Asian, Pacific Islander, 
 
 Page 4 of 14 Version Date:  November 1 5, 2021  American Indian/ Alaska Native , or more than one race. We expect a slight excess of female 
participants, based on the demographics in the standing population. 
 
1. De- identified protected health information participants will include data from all testing 
sites participants which will include individuals age [ADDRESS_135625] between 32,000-  36,000 individuals will be included in the testing.  Individuals will not 
be directly recruited to provide these data.  
 2. Individual level survey data  will include participants who are (a) age 15 years and older ; (b) 
attending an NIH -funded testing event . Exclusion criteria include: (a) individual is unable to 
understand Spanish or English or another language translated by a qualified translator at a 5
th 
grade level (participants who cannot read will  have the consent or assent form read to them) ; (b) 
individual discloses that they previously enrolled in the research project . We anticipate up to 
3,[ADDRESS_135626] r eceived services as usual. 
Recruitment will occur at the testing site , by a study research assistant. A standardized 
recruitment script (see recruitment information document) will be used  and will include eligibility 
questions. Participants will be compensated with a $[ADDRESS_135627] for each survey they complete 
(one at baseline, one at one month follow -up for a total of $[ADDRESS_135628] renumeration 
available).  To recruit participants, we will also add the following text to testing event flyers 
circulated by [CONTACT_33748] '$30 gift cards  available for those eligible to participate in 
a research survey.' 
 
3. Anonymous participant interview  will be collected from a sub -set of randomly selected 
individuals at NIH- funded testing events who are age 18 years or older. We will invite 
approximately 15 individuals to participate in a brief anonymous interview (5- 8 open- ended 
questions) with a study staff member at our testing event s. Anonymous interview data will assist 
with informing the study about individual behaviors related to attending testing events. We will audio record these interviews for transcription. All audio recordings will be destroyed after 
transcription activities a re complete. A standardized recruitment script will be used, which will 
provide information about the purpose of the interview and permission for audio recording. 
Individuals will be compensated with a $ [ADDRESS_135629] assessment scores for site and individual 
level outcomes.  
 
 Page 5 of 14 Version Date:  November [ADDRESS_135630] of the research.  
• The research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects because the data collected 
will not be identifiable  
• The research could not be practicably carried out without the waiver, because asking 
participants to complete the informed consent process would substantially increase the 
length of time required for testing and would result in fewer resources available for testing 
• While the research uses HIPAA identifiers, it does not include identifiable patient information 
(see HIPAA 4a)  
• The waiver will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects as data provided to 
the study team will not be identifiable  
• There is not a need to provide additional pertinent information after participation  
 
2. Individual level surve y data We will use a standardized consent form to consent participants [ADDRESS_135631] the consent form read to them. When appropriate, 
translators will be available for individuals in the Latinx community who speak languages other than 
English or Spanish, such as Mam . Children will never be used as translators.   
 
The assent form is at a 6th grade reading level and is in plain language. Any questions will be answered 
by [CONTACT_16133].  
 
We are requesting a waiver of parental consent to allow individuals between the ages of 15 -17.99 
to participate in this research study. The age of medical consent in Oregon is 15, so COVID -19 
testing is available at our events to individuals 15 years of age and older without parental consent. 
Because of this, many individuals between the ages of 15 -17.99 come to COVID -19 testing events 
without a parent present.  We are requesting to seek their  assent , and not consent of their guardian. 
• The research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects because the data collected 
will not be identifiable  
• The research could not be practicably carried out without the waiver, because asking the 
guardian of participants age 15 –  17.99 to complete the informed consent process would 
substantially increase the length of time required for testing and would result in fewer resources available for testing  
• The waiver will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects as data provided to 
the study team will not be identifiable  
• There is not a need to provide additional pertinent information after participation  
 
Participant consent  or assent will include consent or assent to share protected health information 
from the University of  Oregon’s CLIA certified laboratory, with the study team, so we can link testing 
intake data with participant survey data.  During the informed consent  and assent  process, 
participants will be informed that their personally identifiable information is being collected to link 
testing intake data with their survey data and to be able to understand how well we are reaching 
people who identify as Latino/a/x in a community. 
 
 
 Page 6 of 14 Version Date:  November [ADDRESS_135632] successfully recruited large numbers of participants in 
community agencies.  
 
At the time of consent  or assent, the research staff will review the consent  or assent form  with the 
participant before they sign it to ensure that the participant is clear about data will be obtained by 
[CONTACT_121077]. The research staff 
will also clarify that the identifying inf ormation that the participant includes in the CDE survey will be 
used by [CONTACT_56758]  (NIH) and Duke Clinical Research Institute  (DCRI)  to link to 
other data such as Medicaid data, though once linked the data will  be de- identified.  The research 
assistant will also clarify that Medicaid and other data to which NIH/DCRI links will not be used by 
[CONTACT_121078].  Participants will be presented with the consent or assent to participate in the survey. Following 
that agreement, by [CONTACT_19201] a typed name, participants will be invited to link intake data and test result to the survey and core elements of a HIPAA authorization will be presented. A signature [CONTACT_121094] (typed and finger drawn). Refusal to allow linking of intake 
and test result is not an exclusion criterion.  
 
An informed consent form and assent form will be posted on a Federal Web site (e.g., 
clinicaltrials.gov) after the clinical trial is closed to recruitment, and no later than [ADDRESS_135633] of the study is now complete.  
• The research involves no more than minimal risk to the participants because the data 
collected will not be identifiable  
• The waiver will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the participants as data 
provided to the study team will not be identifiable  
• There is not a need to provide additional pertinent information after participation  
• Participants will be asked to verbally consent to completing the interview, after 1) being 
informed that this is a research study; 2) given a description of foreseeable risks and 
discomforts of participating; 3) provided contact [CONTACT_121079], 
should they have questions.  
 
 
 Page 7 of 14 Version Date:  November [ADDRESS_135634] any questions . The consent form s will be programmed in Qualtrics . The 
Qualtrics link s will be provided to Promotores  by [CONTACT_6968] . Promotores will sign  their name, type their 
name,  and provide the date  to indicate informed consent . Promotores will be invited to share 
information about their demographics and personality , as well as participate in a focus group to 
share their experiences and opi[INVESTIGATOR_121059] . Sharing this information is optional.  
 
5. Community Based Organization general outreach activities . Consent is not required for this 
activity because we are collecting data on the organization activities, rather than individual 
behaviors or impressions.  
 
F. Provisions for Participant Privacy and Data Confidentiality  
As a requirement from our funder, de -identified data will be provided to the Coordination and Data 
Collection Center ( CDCC) . This is referred to as a data library in the consent  and assent . Data will 
not be identifiable and will be shared using secure processes and procedures as designated by [CONTACT_121080].  
1. Privacy 
De-identified protected health information participants.  Potential participants will be identified 
by [CONTACT_62329] (e.g., county public health agencies or a local health care provider) and the 
research team will not have access to their information, other than the data described in the 
methods, materials a nd assessment section. Participants will be tested in an environment that 
meets the patient privacy standards of the care provider (e.g., behind a partition, or in their vehicle 
at a drive -up event ).  
Individual level survey data.  During the intervention, it will be up to participants to disclose 
vulnerable information about their previous experiences. Though testing will occur in public spaces, as is common in current pop -up testing across Oregon, efforts will be made to ensure tha t 
participants will be recruited, consented or assented, and tested in a private environment (e.g., 
behind a partition, facing away from others, in their vehicle, etc). Participants will only disclose 
contact [CONTACT_121081] , which may include email, phone number, or 
physical address.  
Anonymous participant interview.  Participants will not be asked to provide any identifiable 
information during the anonymous participant interview. In addition, efforts will be made to ensure 
participant confidentiality. For example, the interview will be conducted out of earshot from ot hers.  
This aspect of the study is now complete.  
Promotores activities. While promotores must participate in the knowledge assessment post 
training to determine adequate skill and knowledge to perform their role and must complete fidelity 
checklists to ensure program integrity , they will be abl e to elect to respond to questions asking for 
information about their personal characteristics or experiences related to the training .  
Community Based Organization general outreach activities . CBOs will never be identified by 
[CONTACT_121082], however CBO contracts are federally funded and thus publicly available so there is potential that CBOs could be identified.  
 
2. Data Disposition  
De-identified protected health information participants.
 Participant research data and samples 
will be collected without individual identifiers. Data will be maintained by [CONTACT_121083]. 
Barcode identifiers will be used to link survey data to biospecimens. The research team may be 
 
 Page 8 of 14 Version Date:  November 1 5, 2021  briefly in possession of identifiable information while transporting diagnostic samples and only team 
members listed on the protocol will be involved in the transportation of diagnostic samples.   
Individual level survey data  Identifiable participant information will be collected in Qualtrics or 
RedCap during each survey . Following data collection, identifiable data will be removed, and a 
unique identifier assigned for all analyses.  Protected health information from the sample collection 
intake form will be collected and stored by [CONTACT_2374]’s CLIA laboratory. Only pa rticipants who 
provide consent or assent to share  identifiable  data with the study team will have their identifiable 
data shared with the study team.  Disposit ion of email, phone number, or physical address will 
include keepi[INVESTIGATOR_121060].  
Anonymous participant interview.  This component does not include the collection of individual 
identifiers. Audio recordings of participant interviews will be maintained on the secure server at the 
Prevention Science Institute (see confidentiality). Immediately following transcription, aud io files will 
be destroyed. 
Promotores activities. Identifiable participant information will be collected in Qualtrics or RedCap 
during each survey. Following data collection, identifiable data will be removed, and a unique 
identifier assigned for all analyses.   
Community Based Organization general outreach activities . CBOs will never be identified by 
[CONTACT_121082], however CBO contracts are federally funded and thus publicly available so there is potential that CBOs could be identified.  
 
3. Confidentiality  
All data points. All de- identified research survey data will be stored at the Prevention Science 
Institute using standard security techniques (password protected file folders on the University’s 
Prevention Science Institute secure server). Data from Qualtrics or RedCap wil l only be accessed 
using secure wifi. GC3F will store the viral RNA data on Talapas. Any sharing of de -identified viral 
RNA or survey data will occur on shared drive (such as One Drive) that is password protected.   
Storage of data will be stored electronically on a private server and will be directly uploaded only while using secure wifi. If the data must be transferred, they will be transferred using a secure client 
server. Study researchers and the students they supervise  may be granted access to the  de-
identified  data after signing a data use agreement, in order to complete analyses. Records will be 
kept for up to 3 years after the study has been completed.  
In addition to our study’s database and data storing procedures within the UO, data collected for the 
RADx- UP project that will be shared with the RADx consortium will be uploaded through a secure 
client server and maintained by [CONTACT_121084] (DCRI). Identifiable 
data will be shared with DCRI when permission is given in the informed consent form  or assent 
form. Participants are given the option to share identifiable information with the DCRI on the 
informed consent form  or assent form . Agreeing to share identifiable data with the DCRI is not a 
requirement for participants to be enrolled in the study. The DCRI manages data from all studies 
participating in the RADx Program.  The DCRI maintains data in two separate databases , one that 
contains identifiable information and one contains de -identified information.   
Individual level survey data  and promotores data . The only individuals with access to 
identifiable participant information on Teleform, Qualtrics or RedCap  will be those who have the 
appropriate human subjects training who need access to the data to complete their assigned role 
on the research team. The code and key  with participant contact [CONTACT_121085] a 
locked file on the Prevention Science Institute (at University of Oregon) server with permissions granted to only to the study project coordinator and data manager.   
Research funded by [CONTACT_121086] a Certificate of Confidentiality associated with it. This is 
added protection against forced disclosure of research information in circumstances of subpoena.  
 
 Page 9 of 14 Version Date:  November 1 5, 2021  G. Potential Research Risks or Discomforts to Participants  
De-identified protected health information participants.  Potential risks and discomforts involved 
in participation include (1) possible violation of confidentiality. These risks are unlikely.  All records 
obtained from the CLIA laboratory will be kept strictly confidential. Identification numbers will identify 
participants’ data, not their names. Project staff will receive training on confidentiality, including data 
collection, data management, and reporting procedures.  
Individual level survey data.  Information risks, psychological risks, and social risks may occur as 
the result of participating in this study. Information risks include loss of privacy and/or breach of confidentiality. Since data will be collected using only private wifi (except when p articipants are not 
connected to secure wifi  if they use their own device ) and will be stored on a secure server, it is 
unlikely that loss of privacy will occur.  
Psychological risks may occur such as guilt or loss of self -esteem while receiving the health 
intervention . It is likely that both the treatment as usual and the treatment conditions will improve 
sense of responsibility to engage in health behaviors without inducing guilt and improve self -esteem 
but not everyone receives treatment uniformly. Participants will be encouraged to seek services if 
they are in need of additional support.  
Social risks may occur as a result of receiving services in public.  Specifically, participants might feel 
uncomfortable engaging in the intervention if they do not have a private space to participate. This 
risk may be diminished by [CONTACT_121087], regardless of their participation in the research survey.  
All risks will be communicated in the informed consent or assent process.  Our consenting  and 
assenting process informs participants that the information that they provide will be shared with NIH 
and the RADx program who will collaborate to combine data that are collected in a standardized way across the group  of studies. In addition, participants are reminded that all data will be de -
identified prior to sharing with anyone outside of our study or outside of the RADx- UP program. 
Participants have the option to agree  to let the DCRI have access to identifiable information (i.e. 
name, address, contact [CONTACT_4203], and date of birth) by [CONTACT_121088].  
The protocol involves intervention. The intervention includes a promotores  or community navigator 
intervention that aims to increase testing utilization and health behaviors. This will involve outreach by [CONTACT_121089] . Promotores will provide health information which includes 
information from the Centers for Disease Control that has been vetted by [CONTACT_121090]. This research does not pose any additional risk over the services provided as usual 
since some communities provide similar interventions.   
The funding agency required a Data Safety Monitoring Plan for this research at the time of funding proposal. A copy of the DSMP submitted to the funder is attached.  
There is no established Data and Safety Monitoring Board/Committee (DSMB/C) as noted in the 
DSMP.  
Anonymous participant interview.
 There are no physical risks for the individuals who choose to 
complete this interview , however, some participants may experience discomfort when asked 
behavior related questions. Participants who feel uncomfortable during any part of the interview have the option to skip any question. This aspect of the study has been completed.  
Promotores data.  Information risks and psychological risks may occur as the result of participating 
in this study. Information risks include loss of privacy and/or breach of confidentiality. Since data will be collected using only private wifi (except when participants are not connected to secure wifi if they 
use their own device) and will be stored on a secure server, it is unlikely that loss of privacy will occur. All risks will be communicated in the informed consent and assent process.  
 
 Page 10 of 14 Version Date:  November [ADDRESS_135635] and educational information that could improve their health 
behaviors and reduce transmission of SARS- CoV-2 in their communities and around Oregon. Thus, 
others in the community would benefit from general participation if participants are identified as 
positive who previously did not know they were infectious, and if participants actively alter their 
health behaviors, whether infectious or not.  
 
Individuals may receive benefits from participating in this research such as improvements in health 
behaviors and reduced likelihood of contracting and spreading COVID- 19.   
By [CONTACT_121091], the research team will be able to learn whether the promotores  
intervention would be generally useful over services as usual (a flyer about health behaviors).

3. Training and Oversight  
Co-investigators and research assistants will perform research activities within the scope of their 
training.  
Training for research assistants who collect data from participants will be provided by [CONTACT_96392]. Training will include how to sanitize devices used for data collection, relevant human subjects training, and standardized processes and procedures for data collection.  
Promotor es will provide services similar to  what they would provide as usual for community -based 
organization. Given they are part of the research study, but will not be responsible for answering questions about the research or collecting informed consent or assent , and given the possible 
limited understanding of academic processes and procedures, we are proposing an alternative 
human subjects training plan for these individuals. Specifically, a researcher with human subjects 
training will provide human subjects tra ining during the promotores  traini ng already being conducted 
by [CONTACT_5051]. All promotores  will be added to the research plan and will complete Individual 
Investigator Agreements (IIA)s if they are not affiliated with the UO.  Alternative training procedure 
and training dates will be documented in the research records.

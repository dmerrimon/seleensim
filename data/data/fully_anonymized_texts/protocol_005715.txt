Protocol 031- 201-[ZIP_CODE]
Confidential --Proprietary Information 22 Protocol Version 3.0, 31 Jul [ZIP_CODE] Introduction
Aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (OPC -[ZIP_CODE], L u AF41155) is a dopamine serotonin sy stem stabilizer, for 
which efficacy  is thought to be mediated through a combination of partial agonism at 
dopamine D 2and serotonin 5
-HT1Areceptors and antagonism at serotonin 5 -HT2A
receptors.
Abilify  Maintena ®, an extended- release suspension for once monthl y intramuscular ( IM)
injection, is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia at a dose of 400 mg once 
monthly  (deltoid or gluteal I M administration).1In addition, Abilify  Maintena was 
approved b y the [LOCATION_002] (US) Food and Drug Adm inistration (FDA) on 27 Jul 2017 
for the maintenance monotherap
y treatment of bipolar I disorder in adults (Supplemental 
New Drug Application [NDA] 202971 S-010 submitted 28 Sep 2016).
This trial will examine the safet y, tolerability ,and pharmacokinetics (PK)ofmultiple 
doses of aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 2month ( 2M) long-acting inject able (LAI) 960 mg injected inthe 
gluteal muscle in adult subjects with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder 
over the course 
of 32 weeks . The aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 2M L AI 960mg formulation isan extended -release 
presentation inten ded for dosing every  2months. The extension of the dosing interval for 
aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 2M LAI 960mg is primaril y through an increase in the dose while 
maintaining minimum aripi[INVESTIGATOR_92575] 400 mg after multiple doses.
Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for more detailed information on 
nonclinical data and clinical data for aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253].1A brief summary  is included below .
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Clinical Study Report 031-201-[ADDRESS_102435] been exposed to Abilify  
Maintena in all clinical trials and the safet y has been well established. T he Abilify  
Maintena safety  profile is similar to that of the Abilify  oral tablets, with the exception of 
injection site reactions, which is an IM depot -specific adverse event (AE); however, the 
injection site pain does not represent a particular safet y con cern.1
The efficacy  of Abilify  Maintena for the treatment of schizophrenia was established in:
A phase 3, short -term (12 -week), randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial 
in acutel y relapsed adult subjects with s
chizophrenia (Trial 31-12- 291)
A phase 3, long -term (52 -
week), double- blind, placebo -controlled, 
randomized- withdrawal trial in adult subjects with schizophrenia (Trial 31-07-246)
A phase 3, long -term (38 -week), randomized, double -
blind, active- controlled trial in 
adult subjects with schizophrenia (Trial 31-07- 247)
In Trial 31 -
12-291, the primary  endpoint was the change from baseline in Positive and 
Negative S yndrome Scale (PANSS) total score to Week 10. The key secondary endpoint 
was the change from basel
ine in Clinical Global Impression - Severit y (CGI-S) 
assessment scale to Week 10. Abilify  Maintena was superior to placebo in improving the 
PANSS total score at the end of Week 10 (least squares mean change from 
baseline = −26.8 for Abilify  Maintena [400 to 300 mg] and least squares mean change 
from baseline = −11.7 for placebo). Abilify  Maintena also showed improvement in 
symptoms represented b y the CGI -S score mean change from baseline to Week 10.Clinical Study Report 031-201-[ZIP_CODE] 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

07-246, in addition to the PANSS and CGI -S, clinical ratings during this 
trial included the Clinical Global I mpression -
Improvement scale and CGI- S of Suicide 
scale. The primary  efficacy  endpoint was time from randomization to relapse. The trial 
was terminated earl y because maintenance of efficacy wa s demonstrated at a preplanned 
interim analy sis. The final analy sis demonstrated a statistically  significantly longer time 
to relapse in subjects randomized to the Abilify  Maintena group compared to 
placebo- treated subjects. In the placebo group 39.6% of t he subjects had progressed to 
impending relapse, while in the Abilify  Maintena group impending relapse occurred in 
10% of the subjects. The key  secondary  efficacy  endpoint, percentage of subjects meeting 
the relapse criteria, was statistically  significantl y lower in subjects randomized to the 
Abilify  Maintena group (10%) than in the placebo group (40%).
In addition to the above, effica cy was demonstrated in Trial 31-07- 247 for registration of 
Abilify  Maintena in the European Union. The results of analy sis of the primary  efficacy  
endpoint, the estimated proportion of subjects experiencing impending relapse by  [CONTACT_92681] 26 showed that Abilify
 Maintena 400 mg/300 mg is noninferior to Abilify  oral 
tablets 10 to 30 mg. The estimated relapse rate b y the end of Week 26 was 7.12% for 
Abilify  Maintena and 7.76% for Abilify  oral tablets 10 to 30 mg. Further, the 
noninferiority  of Abilify  Maintena compared to Abilify  oral tablets 10 to 30 mg was 
supported by  [CONTACT_92682].
The efficacy  and safet y of Abilify  Maintena for the treatment of bipolar Idisorder was 
established in aphase 3, 52-week, randomized, double- blind, placebo -controlled trial 
(Trial 31-08-250) . The primary  efficacy  endpoint was the time to recurrence of any  mood 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] ,as measured in subjects with bipolar I disorder who had maintained stability  on 
aripi[INVESTIGATOR_92576] 8 weeks. The time to recurrence of any  mood epi[INVESTIGATOR_92577] I M depot treatment compared 
with placebo treatment (log -rank test p < 0.0001). Aripi[INVESTIGATOR_92578] y reduced the risk of recurrence of an y mood epi[INVESTIGATOR_81633] 1 year compared 
with placebo treatment by [CONTACT_92683] (hazard ratio = 0.451 [Cox proportional 
hazard model]; 95% confidence interval [ CI], 0.299 - 0.678). The proportion of subjects 
who met the criteria for recurrence of an y mood epi[INVESTIGATOR_92579] y lower with 
aripi[INVESTIGATOR_92580] (26.5% versus 51.1%,

3 Trial Design
3.1 Type/Design of Trial
This is a phase 1b, open -label, multiple -dose, randomized, parallel- arm, multicenter
(approximately  20trial sites )trial in adult subjects with schizophrenia or bipolar I 
disorder . After a screening period of up to 30 day s, eligible s ubjects will be randomized 
(1:1) to receive multiple doses of either aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 2M L AI 960mg (4injections) or 
aripi[INVESTIGATOR_92552] 400 mg (8injections) over the course of 32 week s. Aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 
2M L AI 960 mg will be administered at56-day (±2 day s) intervals andaripi[INVESTIGATOR_92565] 400 mg will be administered at 
28-day (± 2days) interva ls.Afinal visit will 
occur 56 (± 2) day s after the last dose of a ripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 2M L AI 960 mg or 28 (± 2) day s Clinical Study Report 031-201-[ADDRESS_102439] dose of aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] I M depot 400 mg. A schematic of the trial design is 
provided in Figure 3.1-1.
Randomization to the 2 trial treatments will be stratified by  [CONTACT_92684]
(robust or sparse) and disease t ype (schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder) .Four to [ADDRESS_102440] Sampling Trial Sites; all other trial sites will be 
designated as Sparse Sampling Trial Sites. Up to 76 subjects (38 per treatment group) 
will be enrolled to the robust sampling schedule and 182 subjects (91 per treatment 
group) will b e enrolled to the sparse sampling schedule. If enrollment of the number of 
subjects required for the robust sampling schedule is completed, the Robust Sampling 
Trial Sites may  enroll additional subjects to the sparse sampling schedule with approval 
from the sponsor. An interim anal ysis may be conducted to ensure adequate power of the 
trialSection 7.1.1. Based on the possible sample size re - estimation in the proposed 
interim analy sis, fewer subjects may  be enrolled.
Blood samples for PK analy seswill be drawn from subjects a t both Robust and Sparse 
Sampling Trial Sites after the first dose (Day  1) and fourth (final) dose (Day  169) of 
investigational medicinal product (IMP) for subjects randomized to aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 2M L AI 
[ADDRESS_102441] dose (Day  1), seventh dose (Day  169), and eighth (final) dose 
(Day  197) of IMP for subjects randomized to aripi[INVESTIGATOR_92552] [ADDRESS_102442] some visits as outpatients with 
approval from the medical monitor . For an y outpatient visit, an unscheduled C -SSRS will 
be performed.
Subjects enrolled to the sparse sampling schedule will be outpatients for administration of 
all doses of IMP; however, they may  be housed in the unit for up to [ADDRESS_102443] dose of IMP, subjects will begin a 7- to 14 -day 
period (oral overlap) where they  will transition from their current oral antipsy chotic to 
include injections of IMP. Details of the oral overlap period are provided in Section 3.2.3. Clinical Study Report 031-201-[ADDRESS_102444] IMP (aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 
2M LAI ) administered in this trial will be supplied as 
aripi[INVESTIGATOR_92552] 300 mg/mL  RTU single -dose vials. The reference IMP will be 
aripi[INVESTIGATOR_92552] 400 mg single -dose lyophilized vials.  
 
 
 
 
Subjects will be randomized (1:1)
to receive multiple doses of:
Aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 2M LAI 960mg (test) - 2-month injection ( total of 4 injections), 
administered every  56days (±2 day s) over the course of 
32 weeks.
Aripi[INVESTIGATOR_92552] 400 mg (reference) - 1-month injection ( total of 8injections), 
administered every  28days (±2 day s) over the course of 32 weeks.
The IMP will be administered as a single injection in the gluteal muscle for a total of 
4 (960 mg/injection) or 8(400 mg/injection) injections . Due to possible safe ty and 
tolerability  issues, a one -time dose reduction is allo wed as outlined below:
Aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 2M LAI 960mg: a dose decrease to [ADDRESS_102445] has had a 
decrease to 660 mg, a one -time increase back to 960mg is then allowed. 
Aripi[INVESTIGATOR_92552] 400 mg : a dose decrease to [ADDRESS_102446]’s body weight recorded on Day  1and on each subsequent visit , as 
specified in Table 3.2.1-1. Care must be taken to avoid inadvertent injection into a blood 
vessel, a sper administration instruc tions. Detailed instructions on dose preparation and 
administration will be included in the site manual.

total of 30 mg)in addition to their 
current oral antips ychotic, mood stabilizer, and if applicable, antidepressant for at least
14days prior to the first administration of IMP to establish tolerability . Subjects may  be 
housed in the unit during these 3 day s at the investigator’s discretion. 
3.2.3 Oral Overlap
At the time of administration of the firstdose of IMP, subjects will begin a 7 -to 14 -day 
period (oral overlap) where they  will transition from their current oral antipsy chotic to 
include injections of IMP ,according to the scenarios described in Table 3.2.[ADDRESS_102448] sampling schedule will switch to 10 to 20 mg oral aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] (dose 
determined b y the investigator). Subjects will take their oral antips ychotic medication s
concurrently  with I MP for [ADDRESS_102449] administration of aripi[INVESTIGATOR_92552] 400 mg. The 
oral antipsy chotic will be discontinued after 7 days 
of administration of aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 2M 
LAI 960 mg and after 14 days of administration of aripi[INVESTIGATOR_92552] 400 mg.
For s ubjects currently  stabilized on oral aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253], the recommended supplemental oral 
aripi[INVESTIGATOR_92609]10 mg/day  with the first dose of IMP for subjects
with a previous dose of 10 to 20 mg/day  or to 15 mg/day  for subjects with a previous 
dose of > 20 to 30 mg/day (Table 3.2.3-2 ).
There will be no oral overlap for subjects who are taking Abilify  Maintena® as their 
current antipsy chotic medica tion. Subjects who are on Abilify  Maintena as their current 
antipsy chotic cannot be enrolled until their next scheduled dose is required as specified in

3.2.4 Conc urrent Antipsychotic Treatment
During the trial, concurrent antipsy chotic treatment will be managed as follows :
Subjects with a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder who are taking a mood stabilizer 
(lithium, valproate, lamotrigine) will be permitted to stay  on their mood stabilizer
over the course of the trial, and if applicable, to continue treatment with their 
antidepressant (citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline) unless the medication is 
prohibited during the trial (eg, (fluoxetine, fluoxetine/olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]; Table 4.1-1).
Subjects may  resume treatment on their previous oral non -aripi[INVESTIGATOR_92615]  [ADDRESS_102451] for safety  and clinical stability .
3.3 Trial Popu lation
The trial population will include male and female subjects between the ages of 18 to 
64years of age, inclusive, with a current diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder 
as defined b y the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition 
(DSM -5) criteria. Approximately  258 subjects (129 per treatment group) will be enrolled 
into the trial with the expectation that approximately  170 subjects (85 per treatment 
group) will complete the trial. An interim anal ysis may  be conducte d to ensure adequate 
power of the trial. Based on the possible sample size re
-estimation in the proposed 
interim analy sis, fewer subjects may  be enrolled. 
Subjects entering the trial must have demonstrated prior tolerability  to aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253]. I n 
addition, subjects must be clinically stable (based on investigator judgment, 
subject/caregiver report, and/or documentation) for at least [ADDRESS_102452] 2 months prior to screening: aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253], brexpi[INVESTIGATOR_4253],

asenapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] .Other oral non- aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253], antips ychotic medications may  be allowed if 
approved b y the medical monitor and sponsor; however, clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_92560]. 
Additionally ,subjects with bipolar I  disorder, who are stabilized on their current 
medications for at least 2 months prior to screening may  continue their mood stabilizer 
(lithium, valpr oic acid, lamotrigine) and antidepressant (citalopram, escitalopram, 
sertraline). 
Subjects who are on Abilify  Maintena as their current antipsy chotic cannot be enrolled 
until their next scheduled dose is required as specified in the label ,and they cannot
receive IMP an y earlier than [ADDRESS_102453] sampling schedule (ie, subjects at these trial 
sites will not enter the screening period if they  are taking oral aripi[INVESTIGATOR_92616]).
At screening, subjects will be assigned a unique identification (ID) number (subject 
identifier) upon signing th e informed consent form (I CF). Subjects who meet the Clinical Study Report 031-201-[ADDRESS_102454] scheduled 
visit for PK sampling ( Section 3.10) .

3.7.5 Efficacy  Assessments
The efficacy assessments including PANSS (schizophrenia subjects onl y), CGI -S, CGI -I, 
SWN -S,MADRS (bipolar subjects onl y), YMRS (bipolar subjects onl y), and CGI -BP 
(bipolar subjects onl y) will be administered by [CONTACT_92698] s 
presented in the schedule of assessments (Table 3.7-1for sparse sampling and 
Table 3.7-[ADDRESS_102493] sampling) .All efficacy  assessments will be performed prior to 
PKblood draws and dosing, where applicable.
[IP_ADDRESS] Positive and Negative Sy ndrome Scale Rating Criteria
The PANSS consists of [ADDRESS_102494], severit y is rated on a 7
-point scale, with a score of 1 indicating 
the absence of s ymptoms and a score of 7 indicating extremel y severe s ymptoms. The 
symptom constructs for each su bscale are as follows:
1)Positive Subscale (7 positive sy mptom constructs: delusions, conceptual 
disorganization, hallucinatory  behavior, excitement, grandiosit y, 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_23703]/persecution, and hostility ),
2)Negative Subscale (7 negative sy mptom constructs: b lunted affect, emotional 
withdrawal, poor rapport, passive/apathetic social withdrawal, difficult y in 
abstract thinking, lack of spontaneity  and flow of conversation, stereot yped 
thinking), and
3)General Psy chopathology  Subscale (16 sy mptom constructs: somat ic concern, 
anxiety , guilt feelings, tension, mannerisms and posturing, depression, motor 
retardation, uncooperativeness, unusual thought content, disorientation, poor 
attention, lack of judgment and insight, disturbance of volition, poor impulse 
control, preoccupation, and active social avoidance).
The PANSS will be administered using the Structured Clinical Interview (SCI ) PANSS.[ADDRESS_102495] entry  of the PANSS item scores on the eCRF without verifiable sourc e 
documentation is not acceptable.
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Global Impression -Severity
The severit y of illness foreach subject will be rated using the CGI -S scale.9To assess 
CGI-
S, the rater or investigator will answer the following question: “Considering your 
total clinical experience with this particular population, how mentally  ill is the subject at 
this time? ” Response choices include: 0 = not assessed; 1 = normal, not ill at all; 
2 =borderline mentally  ill; 3 = mildly  ill; 4 = moderatel y ill; 5 = markedl y ill; 
6 = s everel y ill; and 7 = among th e most extremely ill subjects.
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Global Impression -Improvement Scale
The improvement of illness for each subject will be rated using the CGI -I scale.9To 
assess CGI -I, the rater or investigator will rate the subject’s total improvement whether or 
not it is due entirely  to drug treatm ent. All responses will be compared with the su bject’s 
condition at baseline. Response choices include: 0 = not a ssessed, 1 = very  much 
improved, 2 = much improved, 3 = minimally  improved, 4 = no change, 5 = minimally  
worse, 6 = much worse, and 7 = very much worse. Direct entry  of the CGI -I score on the 
eCRF without verifiable source do cumentation is not acceptable.
[IP_ADDRESS] Subjective Well -being under Neuroleptic Treatment -Short Form
The subject’s feeling of their own well -being will be assessed using the 20- question 
SWN -S.8The SWN -S is a validated self -report instrument to evaluate th e subject’s 
perception of well-being while recei ving antipsy chotic medication. Subjects will 
complete the questionnaire without discussing an y of the items with others to avoid 
suggestive external manipulation. The questionnaire consists of 20 items and 5 subscales 
(mental functioning, social integration, emotional regulation, phy sical functioning, and 
self-control) whose items follow in random order. For items marked with a ‘+’, response 
choic es and scoring are as follows: not at all = 1, hardly  at all = 2 , a little = 3, somewhat 
= 4, much =5, very  much = 6. For items marked with a ‘ -’, the scoring is reversed; 
response choic es and scoring are as follows: not at all = 6, hardl y at all = 5, a little = 4, 
somewhat =3, much = 2, very  much = 1.
[IP_ADDRESS] Montgomery -Asberg Depression Rating Scale
The MADRS10will be utilized as the primary assessment of a subject’s level of 
depressive s ymptoms and must be administered using a structured interview guide. 
Detailed instructions for administ ration of the structured interview guide will be 
provided. This scale consists of [ADDRESS_102496]’s subjective report of his or her clinical condition. Additional information is 
based upon clinical observations made during the course of the clinical interview. Each 
item has 5 defined categories of severity  with 4 items gr aded on a 0 to 8 scale (irritability , 
speech, content, and disruptive -
aggressive behavior) and 7 items graded on a 0 to 4 scale.
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Global Impression -Bipolar Version
The CGI -BP scale refers to the global impression of the subject with respect to bi polar I 
disorder.12The scale rates the subject’s severity  of illness (CGI -BP-Severity : mania,
depression, and overall bipolar illness) and change from preceding phase (CGI -BP
change from preceding phase: mania, depression, and overall bipolar illness) based on a
7-point scale. Severit y of illness (CGI -BP-Severity ) should be rated at visits as indicated 
inthe schedule of assessments ( Table 3.7-1for sparse sampling and Table 3.7-[ADDRESS_102497] sampling) . Ateach visit other than Day  1 (baseline), the change from preceding 
phase (CGI -BP change from preceding phase) will be judged with respect to 
the subject’s 
condition at baseline for that phase (ie, the last visit from the preceding phase).
3.7.6 Safety  Assessments
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events
Refer to Section 5 for the methods and timing for assessing, recording, and anal yzing 
AEs.
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Laboratory  Assessments
The tests listed in Table [IP_ADDRESS]-1 will be collected at the time points presented in the 
schedule of assessments ( Table 3.7-[ADDRESS_102498] 
sampling) and processed in accordance with directions from the clinical chemistry  
laboratory .Clinical Study Report 031-201-[ADDRESS_102499](s) may  be repeated. If the result of any  test (or 
repeat test, if done) is indicated as clinically  significant during the screening period, the 
subject will NOT be enrolled into the trial without the permission of the medica l monitor. 
In addition, follow- up unscheduled labs should be performed on clinicall y significant 
abnormalities d uring the course of the trial. Unscheduled laboratory  tests may  be repeated 
at an y time at the discretion of the investigator for appropriate medical care.
[IP_ADDRESS] Physical Examination and Vital Sign A ssessments
Complete phy sical examinations will be performed at the time points presented in the 
schedule of assessment s (Table 3.7-[ADDRESS_102500] 
sampling) . The principal investigators or designees are primarily  responsible for 
perfor ming the phy sical examination. Whenever possible, the same individual should 
perform all ph ysical examinatio ns for any  individual subject. If the appointed designee is 
to perform the ph ysical examination, he /she must be permitted b y local regulations and 
his/her name [CONTACT_92733] [ADDRESS_102501] -treatment 
physical examination that was not present at the baseline physical examination should be 
documented as an AE and followed to a satisfactory  conclusion.
Body height and weight will also be measured during scr eening for calculation of body  
mass index ( BMI )and weight will be measured as part of all sub sequent phy sical 
examinations. For the measurement of height, the measurement will be made without 
shoes. For the measurement of weight, all efforts will be made to use the same scale for 
all measurements throughout the trial.
Vital signs will be taken at the time points presented in the schedule of assessments
(Table 3.7-[ADDRESS_102502] sampling) . Vital signs will be 
obtained prior to PK blood draws and ECGs at the nominal time points, where applicable. 
Vital signs will include systolic and diastolic blood pressure, hea rt rate, and body  
temperature. At each time point for vital signs, blood pressure (sy stolic and diastolic) and 
heart rate will be taken after subjects have been in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_92634] l east 
5minutes and again after subjects have been standing for [ADDRESS_102503] in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547] (ie, 
only once).
[IP_ADDRESS] Electrocardiogram Assessments
Standard 12
-lead ECGs will be colle cted in triplicate (5 minutes apart) at the time points 
presented in the schedule of assessments (Table 3.7-1for sparse sampling and 
Table 3.7-[ADDRESS_102504] sampling) . Additional 12- lead ECGs may  be obtained at the 
investigator’s discretion and should always be obtained in the event of an early  
termination (ET) of an y cause. The ECGs will be collected prior to PK blood draws and 
after vital signs at the nominal time points, where applicable.
Standard 12- lead ECGs will be recorded after the subject has been supi[INVESTIGATOR_92635]≥ [ADDRESS_102505] ECG and subjects will remain supi[INVESTIGATOR_92636]. Heart rate, ventricular rate, RR interval, PR interval, QRS duration, and QT 
intervals will be re corded. The corrected QT interval using Fridericia’s formula (QTcF )
will be calculated. The [ADDRESS_102506]’s eligibility  and to mo nitor safety  during the trial. 
The principal investigators or 
designees (licensed ph ysician) will review, sign, and date each ECG reading, noting 
whether or not an y abnormal results are of clinical significance. The ECG will be 
repeated if an y results are considered to be clinically  significant. The reviewers must be 
listed on FDA Form 1572 and the trial sitedelegation of responsibility  form. 
Electrocardiogram data will be recorded electronically (ie, eCRFs) by [CONTACT_92699] b y the trial site. Eligibility  for the trial will be based on the central ECG 
report at the screening visit and the trial site’s local ECG reading at Day  1 predose.
[IP_ADDRESS] Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale
Suicidality  will be monitored during the trial using the C- SSRS. The Baseline/Screening 
version and the Since Last Visit version of the C -SSRS will be completed by  [CONTACT_92700] e of a
ssessments ( Table 3.7-1for 
sparse sampling and Table 3.7-[ADDRESS_102507] sampling) . This scale consists of a baseline 
evaluation that assesses the lifetime experience of the subject
 with suicide events and 
suicidal idea tion and a postbaseline evaluation that focuses on suicidalit y since the last 
assessment.
[IP_ADDRESS] Other Safety  Assessments

Parkinsonism (gait, arm droppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
shoulder shaking, elbow rigidity , wrist rigidity , head rota tion, glabella tap, tremor, 
salivation, and ak athisia). Each item will be rated on a 5 -point scale, with a score of 1 
representing absence of symptoms and a score of 5 r epresenting a severe condition. The 
SAS Total Score is the sum of the scores for all 10 items.
[IP_ADDRESS].1.2 Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale
The AIMS9assessment consists of 10 items desc ribing s ymptoms of dy skinesia. Facial 
and oral movements (items 1 through 4), extremity movements (items 5 and 6), and trunk 
move ments (item 7) will be observed unobtrusively while the subject is at rest (eg, in the 
waiting room), and the investigators will also make global judgments on the subject’s 
dyskinesias (items 8 through 10). Each item will be rated on a 5- point scale, with a score 
of 0 representing absence of sy mptoms (for item 10, no awareness), and a score of 
4 indicating a severe condition (for it em 10, aware/severe distress). For this scale, the 
subject is to be sitting on a hard, firm chair. In addition, the AI MS includes 2 y es/no 
questions that address the subject’s dental status.
The AIMS Movement Rating Score is defined as the sum of items 1 through 7 (ie, items 
1 through 4, facial and oral movements; items 5 through 6, extremity  movements; and 
item 7, trunk movements).
[IP_ADDRESS].1.3 Barnes A kathisia Rating Scale
The BARS14consists of 4 items related to akathisia: objective observation of akathisia b y 
the investigator, subjective feelings of restlessness by  [CONTACT_423], subject distress due to 
akathisia, and g lobal evaluation of akathisia. The first 3 items will be rated on a 4 -point 
scale, with a score of 0 representing absence of s ymptoms and a score of 3 representing a 
severe condition. The global clinical evaluation will be made on a 6-point scale, with 0 
representing absence of symptoms and a score of 5 representing severe akathisi a. To 
complete this scale, subjects will be observed while they  are seated and then standing for 
a minimum of 2minutes in each position. Symptoms observed 
in other situations (eg, 
while engaged in neutral conversation or engaged in activity  on the ward) may  also be 
rated. Subjective phenomena are to be elicited b y direct questioning.
The BARS Global Score is from the global clinical assessment of akathisia fr

procedures in Section [IP_ADDRESS] must be followed. Subjects may  be replaced, if 
discontinuations/withdrawals occur, as described in Section 3.3.
[IP_ADDRESS] Withdrawal of Consent
All subjects have the right to withdraw their consent from further participation in the trial 
at an y time without prejudice. Subjects cannot withdraw consent for use of data already  
collected as part of the trial, but only  for future participation.
Withdrawal of consent is a critical trial event and therefore should be approached with 
the same degree of importance and care as is used in initial ly obtaining informed consent. 
The reasons for a subject’s intended withdrawal need to be understood, documented, and 
managed to protect the rights of the subject and the integrity  of the trial.
At any  time, a subject may  withdraw from the substudy  and may  request that the
sponsor destro y their sample(s) by [CONTACT_92701]. Should the subject choose to 
withdraw their consent to the storage and use of their sample(s), such sample(s) will not 
be used from that point on a nd will be promptly  destroy ed. Subjects will not lose any  
benefits, medical treatment
,or legal rights which they are allowed if they request their 
sample(s ) to be destro yed. Leaving the main trial does not mean that their sample(s) used 
for this substudy  will automatically  be destroy ed. Subjects wil l have to make a request 
for their sample(s) to be destro yed after they  leave the trial.
Subjects who withdraw should be encouraged to complete all ET and follow -up

dose administered.
A suspected adverse reaction is any  AE for which there is a reasonable possibility  that the 
IMP ca used the AE. For the purpose of Investigational New Drug (IND) safety reporting, 
“reasonable possibility ” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between 
theIMP and the AE. 
“Suspected adverse reaction” implies a lesser degree of certainty
about causalit y than “adverse reaction”.
AnSAE includes an y event that results in any of the following outcomes:
Death
Life-threatening; ie, the subject was, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], at immediate 
risk of death from the event as it occurred. Itdoes not include an event that, had it

:It is the investigator’s responsibility  to 
review the results of all laborato ry tests as they  become available. This review will be 
documented by [CONTACT_093]’s dated sign ature on the laboratory  report. For each 
abnormal laboratory  test result, the investigator needs to ascertain if this is an abnormal 
(ie, clinicall y relevant) change from baseli ne for that individual subject. This 
determination, however, does not necessarily  need to be made the first time an abnormal 
value is observed. The investigator may  repeat the laboratory  test or request additional 
tests to verify  the res ults of the original laboratory tests. If this laboratory value is 
considered clinically  relevant by  [CONTACT_093] ( eg, subject is sy mptomatic, requiring 
corrective treatment or further evaluation), or if the laboratory  value leads to 
discontinuation, or fulfills a seriousness criterion, this is considered an AE.
Severity : Adverse events will be graded on a 3- point scale a nd reported as indicated on 
theeCRF . The intensit y of an AE is defined as follows:

Before trial enrollment, men and FOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding 
pregnancy  during trial participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentio nal 
pregnancy . Subjects must sign the ICF confirmin g that the above -mentioned risk factors 
and the consequences were discussed.
A urine or serum pregnancy  test for human chorionic gonadotropin will be performed on 
all FOCBP at screening and throughout the trial at the time points presented in the 
schedule of a

should also be instructed to contact [CONTACT_26819] , during the trial, if their 
partners suspect that they might be pregnant (eg, missed or late menstrual cy cle).
If a subject is suspected to be preg nant before she receives IMP, the IMP administration 
must be withheld until the results of serum pregnancy  tests are available. If the pregnancy  
is confirmed, the subject must not receive the IMP and must
not be enrolled in the trial. If 
pregnancy  is suspe cted while the subject is taking IMP, the IMP must be withheld 
immediately  (if reasonable, taking into consideration any  potential withdrawal risks) until 
the result o f the pregnancy  test is known. If pregnancy  is confirmed, the I MP will be

respectivel y
. 
It is estimated that a total of at least 100 subjects (ie, 50 per group) completing the trial 
will have at least 80% power to ensure that the lower limit of the 90% CI of the GMR of 
C56after the fourth dose of aripi[INVESTIGATOR_4253] 2M LAI 960mg (test) to C28after the eighth 
dose of aripi[INVESTIGATOR_92552] 400 mg (reference) is greater than 0. 80, assuming that the 
actual GMR of concentrations is 1.0 and the CV is 46%. 
Among these [ADDRESS_102536] 80% power to ensure that the lower limit of the 90% CI of

of aripi[INVESTIGATOR_92552] 400 mg (reference) after the seventh and eighth doses is greater 
than 0.80, assuming the actual GMR of concentrations is 1.15 and the CV is 40%.
The assumption of

treatment group) will have been enrolled to the robust 
sampl ing schedule . Subjects will continue to be enrolled into the trial until either the 
interim analy sis is complete and recommends no sample size increase or there are enough 
subjects enrolled to ensure 170 completers.
If the trial is stopped due to futility  (as described by [CONTACT_92708]), randomized 
subjects will be terminated; however, if the interim analy sis stops the trial for having 
enough conditional power, then all randomized subjects will continue until the last 
observation. Subjects in screeni ng will be discontinued and no further randomization will 
occur.
An alpha level of 0.001 (1

interim analy sis. The corresponding final significance level is 0.049 (1- sided).
The sample size will be re-estimated onl y based on the conditional power determined at 
the interim anal ysis. The adaptive designs methodology  published by  [CONTACT_92709], DeMets, and 
Lan (2004)15will be used to increase the sample size based on an in terim estimate of the 
treatment effect size, possibly  combined with other external information, without 
inflating the Ty pe I error.

into a s ystem 
(eSource) that is fully  validated. Changes to the data will be cap tured b y an

system until they  have been appropriatel y trained. Information to be originally  captured 
and reviewed electronically  shall include details of the subject visit and the protocol 
required assessments performed as a part of these visits, medical history , AEs, and

Confidential --Proprietary Information 110 Protocol Version 3.0, 31 Jul 201910 Quality  Control and Quality  Assurance
10.1 Monitoring
The sponsor has ethical, legal, and scientific obligations to follo w this trial in accordance 
with established re search principles, I CH E6 GCP: Consolidated Guidance, and 
applicable regulator y requirements and local laws. As part of a concerted effort to fulfill 
these obligations (maintain current personal knowledge of th e progress of the trial), the 
sponsor’s (or sponsor designee’s) monitors will visit the site during the trial, as well as 
communicate frequentl y via telephone, e -mail, and written communications. In addition, 
all investigators and trial siteclinical perso nnel will undergo initial and ongoing training 
for this particular trial, and this training will be clearl y documented.
10.2 Auditing
The sponsor’s (or designee’s) Quality  Assurance Unit (or representative) may  conduct 
trial siteaudits. 
Audits will include, but are not limited to, I MP supply , presence of 
required documents, the informed consent process, and comparison of eCRFs with source 
documents. The investigator agrees to participate with audits.
Regulatory  authorities may  inspect the trial siteduring or after the trial. The investigator 
will cooperate with such inspections and will contact [CONTACT_92722].
10.3 Protocol Deviations
Due to the complexity  of clinical trial protocols and despi[INVESTIGATOR_21869] a nd preventive 
efforts, deviations from the written protocol may  occur and potentially  result in harm to 
subjects, biased or inaccurate results, and possible rejection of all or part of the trial data. 
Per the ICH E3 guidance on the structure and content of clinical study  reports, 
Section 10.2, protocol deviations should be summarized by  [CONTACT_92723]:
Major IMP dosing errors that may  compromise subject safet y or efficacy assessments.
Administration of an excluded concomi tant medication during the course of the trial.
The FDA defines a protocol deviation/violation as an unplanned excursion from the 
protocol that is not implemented or intended as a systematic change.Clinical Study Report 031-201-[ADDRESS_102559] on the integrit y of the trial’s primary  scientific objectives or has a 
significant potentia l to have a negative impact on the safet y or efficacy ass essments of 
any trial subject. Major deviations are those that might significantl y affect the 
completeness, accuracy , or reliability  of the trial data or that might significantly  affect a 
subject’s r ights, safet y, or well -being.
A minor deviation is an intentional or accidental action or omission during trial conduct 
in which the protocol is not strictly  followed, but which has inconsequential impact on 
the integrit y of the trial as a whole or the saf ety or efficacy anal yses of an individual 
subject.
All protocol deviations will be categorized as major or minor according to the above 
definitions and only  major deviations will be summarized in the CSR.
If the same protocol deviation occurs for multiple subjects, it must be recorded separatel y 
for each subject.
Investigators are expected to document potential protocol deviations as well as their 
medical assessment regarding continuation of the subject(s) due to the protocol deviation.
[ADDRESS_102560] be conducted in compliance with the protocol, FDA, ICH GCP Guideline 
(E6), international ethical principles derived from the Declaration of Helsinki and 
Council for International Organizations of Medical Science guidelines, and applic able 
local laws and regulations. The trial sites will seek approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_92667], and the investigator will provide that documentation 
to the sponsor. The IRB will evaluate the ethical, scientific, and medi calappropriateness 
of the trial. Further, in preparing and handling eCRFs, the investigator, sub- investigator, 
and their staff will take measures to ensure adequate care in protecting subject privacy . 
To this end, a subject number or subject identifier wi ll be used to identify each subject.
Financial aspects, subject insurance, and publication policy  for the trial will be 
docu mented in the agreement between the sponsor and the investigator.Clinical Study Report 031-201-[ZIP_CODE] 16.1.1 Protocol and Protocol Amendments

13 Amendment Policy
The investigator will not make an y changes to this protocol without the sponsor’s prior 
written consent and subsequent approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_91805] . Any  permanent 
change to the protocol, whether an overall change or a change for specific trial sites, must 
be ha ndled as a protocol amendment. Any amendment w ill be written by  [CONTACT_456]. 
Each amendment will be submitted to the IRB, as required b
y local regulati ons. Except 
for “administrative” or “nonsubstantial” amendments, investigators will wait for IRB
approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_92668](s). 
Administrative amendments are defined as having no effect on the safet y of subjects, 
conduct or management of the trial, trial design, or the quality  or safet y of IMP(s) used in 
the trial. A protocol change intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to 
subjects should be implemented immediately  after agreement by  [CONTACT_92725], followed b y IRBnotification within local applicabl e timelines. The sponsor 
will submit protocol amendments to the applicable regulatory  agency  within local 
applicable timelines.
When the IRB, investigators, or the sponsor conclude that the protocol amendment 
substantially  alters the trial design or increases the potential risk to the subject, the 
currentl y approved written I CF will require similar modification. In such cases, after 
approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_92669] b y the IRB, repeat written informed consent 
will be obtained from subjects enrolled in the trial before expecting continued 
participation and before the amendment -specified changes in the trial are implemented.Clinical Study Report 031-201-[ADDRESS_102561] of this trial

Study Title:  Compare Q -Cup with other umbilical blood collection techniques for umbilical cord blood 
collection and transfer to laboratory tubes : A Feasibility Study  
Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_583161], M.D., M.S.  
Co- Investigator: Michael Schaffer, M .D. and Zuber D. Mulla, MSPH, PhD  
I. Abstract:   
Currently there  is no standardized method of collecting and transferring umbilical cord blood to 
laboratory vacuum tubes.  Curren t methods are messy and may require needles to draw the blood 
presenting risk of blood exposure and percutaneous injury to obstetrical personnel.  A safer, more 
efficient method of c ollecting cord blood is needed.  We propose to use our Q -Cup technology fo r 
collecting cord blood. Our Q -Cup device is a two -pi[INVESTIGATOR_583162]’s umbilical cord and readily 
transfers the blood into a laboratory vacuum tube. T he device consists of a collection cup with a wide 
opening to easily collect blood from the umbilical cord and a guide tube with a recessed needle which is 
attached to the collection cup. The operator is enabled to fill the required vacuum containing tubes  in a 
clean, quick, efficient and safe manner by [CONTACT_583167] Q -
Cup. As a result, there is less risk of blood exposure and percutaneous injury and blood is collected more 
efficiently. This device allows the practitioner to collect and  transfer umbilical cord blood: w ithout the 
need for removing the stopper from the vacuum tube (reducing mess and contamination)  and w ithout 
the need for a syringe and exposed needle (reducing injury and infection) . 
II. Background  
Approximately [ADDRESS_766674] blood (UBC) 
collection is a routine hospi[INVESTIGATOR_583163] a newborn’s health after the birth  of the 
fetus . UBC  is tested to measure bilirubin levels, blood gases, blood sugar levels, blood types, complete 
blood counts, and platelet counts. [ADDRESS_766675] of blood,  or extracting the blood by [CONTACT_44579] a needle with a syringe. The 
Center for Disease Control (CDC) estimates 5.[ADDRESS_766676] and evaluation of the Q -cup will be conducted by [CONTACT_152905].  
a. Providers (Certified Nurse Midwives, Residents, Medical Doctors) employed at the [LOCATION_007] Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso  
Blood transfer method : Blood will be collected as a  standard of care from the 
expelled umbilical cord.  
b. Patients deliverin g at University Medical Center  
Patients with established care at [LOCATION_007] Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso and who will be delivering their baby [CONTACT_583168].  Their expelled umbilic al cord blood will b e 
used to test the Q -cup device.   Inclusion criteria will include: women over [ADDRESS_766677] trimester of pregnancy and  receiving their prenatal care with a 
TTUHSC El Paso provider.  
 
c. Procedure :  
a. Providers:  
i. Delivery providers will be added to the research protocol. The research 
personnel will introduce and train the use of the blood collection methods  
Page 4 of 5 
 to the delivery providers ; Providers  will be trained on the Q -cup collection 
and review the standard collection currently used (drain umbilical cord 
blood into the vial). This project will not have an  impact on direct  patient  
care.  At the time of delivery, the Q -cup will be provided to the provider in a 
sterilized bag. The bag is opened and the vacuum tube with n eedle is 
inserted into the barrel of the Q -cup.  
ii. The expelled umbilical cord is usually clamped after delivery.  
iii. The clamp is then opened  and the blood specimen is drained  into the blood 
vial or will be drained  into the Q -cup.  
1. If the Q cup is involved, the n an additional step will be to use 
vacuum pressure to push the blood specimen into the vacuum  
collection tube.  
iv. The tube is rinsed in saline and sent to the lab for standard of care.  
v. The provider will fill out a data sheet to assess safety, ease of use, and 
length of procedure. The provider will also fill out a survey  to assess their 
satisfaction and other questions on blood collection techniques comparing 
the standard method, passive flow to the Q -cup technique .   
b. Patients  
i. Patients will be recruited at t he TTUHSC EP OBGYN Clinic. The clinical 
personnel will introduce the study to the potential participant. If the 
participant would like to hear more information, research personnel will be 
called to explain in more detail, assess eligibility,  and describe t he consent 
process.  
ii. If the patient would like to participate in the study  and meets eligibility , she 
will be a sked to  sign a consent form and will be randomly placed into the 
control or study (Q -cup) group. Participant will be given a laminated card to 
pack in her hospi[INVESTIGATOR_583164].  
1. The card will indicate to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_583165].   
2. The participant will give the card to her assigned nurse who will 
inform the providers on duty about the participant.  
3. The card will indicate if the participant is in the control or study (Q -
cup) group.  
iii. Eligibility states the participant must be pregnant in their third trimester 
since the actual feasibility of the Q -cup will take place when the baby [CONTACT_583169]. Due to this, all participants in the 
study are expected to be admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. When participants are 
admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_583166], this will not be considere d an 
unanticipated event.  
 
Page [ADDRESS_766678] any of the participant’s specimens for 
research purposes.  
V. Data analysis : Anticipating the average lengths of cord blo od collection with the standard method is 
15 seconds and 30 seconds with the Q -cup, we will need 30 subjects total. 15 in the Q -cup arm of the 
study and 15 in the comparison group (for a two -sided two -sample t -test with 80% power, an alpha of 
0.05, and a c ommon standard deviation of 14 seconds).  Data will be entered into REDCap  by [CONTACT_583170] 9.3.  Data will be coded appropriately for missing information 
as 999, and “not  applicable” sections as 88 . Additionally, frequen cies and tabulations will be created 
from the collected data.

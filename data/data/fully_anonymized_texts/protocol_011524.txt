2.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo - HCT) is a curative therapy for the treatment of 
hematological and non- hematological malignancies and certain non -malignant conditions. Bone marrow 
or peripheral blood from an HLA matched sibling donor is the most commonly used source of allogeneic stem cells. However, HLA matched siblings are a vailable for less than one third of the patients who 
require allo - SCT. In the absence of an HLA matched sibling, volunteer unrelated donors or partially 
mismatched related donors (PMRD), stored cord blood may be used as a source of allogeneic stem cells. Stored cord blood has been used as a source of allogeneic stem cells in infants and children, but had early skepticism in adults because of concerns about the engraftment potential of the relatively limited number of stem cells. The number of stem cells in  a unit of cord blood is generally one log less than the number of 
stem cells on an average collection of bone marrow from an adult for transplantation.  
2.[ADDRESS_889743] 
disease (GVHD) may be less after cord blood transplantation in comparison to volunteer unrelated donor transplantation. Up to a two antigen mismatch may be tolerated wit hout a significant effect on the overall 
transplant outcome, expanding the patient population who may undergo allogeneic transplant.  For patients who lack an HLA matched bone marrow donor, cord blood from an unrelated donor is an alternative source of hem opoietic progenitor cells. 
 The major disadvantage of cord blood transplantation is the slow rate of hematopoietic recovery and relatively higher incidence of failure to engraft. This delay of recovery may result in a higher incidence of infectious complic ations in the early post transplant period. Lack of donor lymphocytes for future use is 
another major disadvantage with cord blood transplantation.

not statistically significant in difference compared to engraftment rate in the marrow group (96%).

related mortality, relapse rate, and disease- free survival. 
 Laughlin et al.
[ADDRESS_889747] bloods were mismatched at one HLA antigen (34pts) or two HLA antigens (116pts).  The bone 
marrow patients were HLA matched (367pts) or had one HLA mismatch (83pts).  The cord blood recipi[INVESTIGATOR_659808].  As expected, cor d blood recipi[INVESTIGATOR_136833] a slower 
hematopoietic recovery.  Acute GVHD was higher in patients receiving bone marrow and chronic GVHD was higher in patients receiving cord blood.  Mismatched bone marrow transplant and mismatched cord blood showed similar rates  of treatment -related mortality, treatment failure, relapse rate, and overall 
mortality.  
 Reduced -intensity BMT has become more appealing as an attempt to minimize the toxicity and mortality 
of the preparative regimen while maintaining the anti- leukemic activity of the transplanted immune 
system.  This approach may also offer some benefit in cord blood transplant, considering a major barrier is the delay in neutrophil recovery.  Using a lower intensity regimen should allow some recipi[INVESTIGATOR_659809].  One example of this approach was published by

8 who utilized two regimens: fludarabine, busulfan, total body irradiation (Flu/Bu/TBI) and 
fludarabine, cytoxan, and total body irradiation (Flu/Cy/TBI).  Sustained donor engraftment was 76% with Flu/Bu/TBI and 94% with Flu/Cy/TBI.  The median day of neutrophil recovery was 26 and 9.5 days, respectively between the two regimens.  Incidence of grades III -IV GVHD was 9% and 1 year survival 
was 39%.  Numerous other ce nters have successfully utilized a reduced intensity approach in cord blood 
transplantation.

UCB uni ts will be required to be a 4/6 to a 6/ 6 HLA  A, B , DRB1 antigen match  with the patient as 
allowed per NMDP guidlines .  A minimum total nucleated cell (TNC) dose of >2.0 x 10
7/kg at the time of 
freezing will be utilized when possible.  When using double units, each unit should contain a minimum 
pre-cryopreserved TNC dose of 1.5 x 107/kg. 
 
UCB Transplant Procedure 
There will be a myeloablative and reduced -intensity preparative regimen that can be given prior to 
infusion of cord product.  The myeloablative approach will be selected in younger patients ( <50yo) with a 
HCT -CI score <3.   The reduced -intensity regimen will be selected for all older patients  (>50) or younger 
patients with a HCT -CI score > 3.  The reduced -intensity regimen will also be chosen for any patients 
being transplanted for indolent/follicular lymphomas , CLL, myeloma, or Hodgkin lymphoma; irrelevant 
of age or HCT -CI score.  On a case by [CONTACT_413], patients may  receive a preparative regimen outside of 
their designated category as noted above  with the approval of the PI, if deemed in the patient’s best 
interest.   Example:   A p atient that is 55yo with high -risk AML and a HCT -CI score 1, may be approved 
for the myeloablative preparative regimen. . 
 
Myeloablative Preparative Regimen:  
• Fludarabine 4 0 mg/m2 IV on Days - 6, -5, -4, and -3 
• Busulfan 130mg/m2 IV on Days - 6, -5, -4, and -3 
• TBI 200cGy on Day -1 
• Thymoglobulin (rabbit ATG) 1.5mg/kg IV Days -4, -3, -2 (may be given at the discretion of

 Reduced -intensity Preparative Regimen : 
• Cyclophosphamide 50mg/kg IV Day - 6 
• Fludarabine 40 mg/m2 IV Days - 6, -5, -4, -3, -2 
• TBI 200cGy on Day -1 
• Thymoglobulin (rabbit ATG) 1.5mg/kg IV Days -4, -3, -2 (may be given at the discretion of 
treating physician)  
  The preparative regimen will be follow ed by [CONTACT_659818](s).  UCB unit(s) will be 
thawed according to methods of Rubinstein et al.

sequentially on the same day 1- 6 hours apart.  Tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)  will be 
used for GVHD prophylaxis.  On day  +30, +60, +100, +180, and +365 the chimeric status  of patients will 
be interpreted by [CONTACT_659819].  Immune reconstitution (Digeorge Panel) will also be checked at these 
time points.

Title of study:  Safety and acceptability of deferiprone delayed release tablets in patients with 
systemic iron overload  
Study code:  LA61 -0218  
Phase of development:  Phase 2  
Objectives:  Primary objective:   To evaluate the safety of deferiprone  delayed release (DR) 
tablets  in two different dosage groups in patients with systemic iron overload . 
Secondary objectives:  
• To evaluate the tolerability of deferiprone  DR tablets in two different 
dosage group s in patients with systemic iron overload  
• To evaluate the acceptability to patients of deferiprone DR  
Study design:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Multi -center open -label study in patients with transfusion -dependent blood disorders 
who are currently taking deferiprone immediate release tablets (Ferriprox®) for the 
treatment of systemic iron overload. There will be two treatment groups, defined as 
“low dosage” (Group A) and “high dosage” (Group B).  With Ferriprox, the 
recommended starting dosage is 75 milligrams  per kilogram of body weight (mg/k g) 
per day  and the recommended maximum is 100 mg/kg  per day, but for most 
patients, the precise daily amount differs from either of these values  since  doses 
must be tailored to the individual patient’s response and therapeutic goals and 
rounded to the nearest half -tablet .  Study participants will be assigned to Group A or 
Group B depending on which end of the range their Ferriprox intake is closer to, 
with equal numbe rs of patients enrolled in each group:  
• Group A, low dosage:   Patients currently taking Ferriprox tablets at a 
dosage that is closer to 75 mg/kg /day (n=15)  
• Group B, high dosage:   Patients currently taking Ferriprox tablets at a 
dosage that is closer to 100 mg/kg /day (n=15)  
In each group, participants will be provided with deferiprone DR tablets to be 
taken twice daily (b.i.d.) for [ADDRESS_109434] been taking three times daily (t.i.d.)  as closely as 
possible. Individual doses will be rounded to the nearest [ADDRESS_109435] dose, patients will 
return to their regular chelation regimen.

Study design (cont’d):  Screening will be conducted wit hin 14 days prior to the start of dosing, and with the 
exception of hematology, laboratory results obtained at that time will be treated as 
the baseline values. Blood s amples will be collected for the assessment of 
biochemistry (screening and Days 3, 7, 14 , 21, and 28), hematology (screening, 
baseline, and Days 7, 14, 21, and 28), serology (screening only), and other safety 
parameters (screening and Day 28); and urine samples will be collected for 
urinalysis (screening and Day 28).  For the Day 3, 7, 14, an d 21 samples, patients 
may choose to visit a local laboratory instead of the study site; if this is done, they 
must use the same laboratory throughout the entire study.  If deemed necessary, 
patients with ongoing adverse events may be asked after the last dose to provide 
further blood samples until resolution.  On Day 28, patients will be asked for their 
views on the acceptability of the delayed release formulation vs. the immediate 
release (Ferriprox) tablets .   
Any patient who withdraws before completing treatment will be requested to 
return for an Early Termination visit, at which time the procedures scheduled for 
the Day [ADDRESS_109436] is administe red to patients with 
iron overload, as a precaution, enrollment will be conducted progressively in small  
groups , and safety results will be reviewed following the enrollment of a limited 
number of patients . Decisions regarding continuation will be based on  the findings.  
Duration of 
participation : The duration of participation will be 28 days , excluding the screening period . 
 
Criteria for 
evaluation:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Safety  
In recognition of the variability of levels of the liver enzymes alanine  
aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) in patients with 
iron overload, the criterion for deciding whether an individual patient’s increases 
for each of these enzymes during the study constitute a safety concern  will be set as 
follows:  
• For a patient whose level is within the normal range at bas eline, the criterion 
will be reaching a value of 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)  
• For a patient whose level is above the ULN at baseline, the criterion will be 
reaching a value of [ADDRESS_109437]  
For each dosage group, the fo llowing will be determined:  
• The number and percentage of patients with increased post -dose levels of 
ALT and/or AST that meet  either of the criteria defined above  
• Adverse events (AEs):  Frequency, intensity, time to onset, duration, and 
relatedness to stud y drug

levels of ALT or AST that meet the criteri a for being considered a safety concern  
will be calculated for each dosage group .  Similarly, the Clopper -Pearson 95% CI  of 
the inciden ce of gastrointestinal (GI) distress  reported by [CONTACT_99334]. Other  AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_99335]. 
The incidence of abnormal data for safety measures will be presented for each 
dosage group . The continuous and discrete variables for safety data will be  
summarized with descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, 
minimum, and maximum) and frequency tables, respectively, at each assessment. 
For each dosage group , frequency tables will b e used to summarize the response to 
each question of the questionnaire on treatment acceptability between Ferriprox 
IR vs. deferiprone DR. Based on the responses to the question on overall 
preference for one formulation or the other, a one-sample proportio n test  will be 
used to test if the overall preference for deferiprone DR is greater than 0.5 for 
each dosage group .

 1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background  
Beta thalassemia and certain other hereditary blood disorders are characterized by  [CONTACT_99336] s of hemoglobin  that lead to excessive destruction of red blood cells  and severe  anemia , 
necessitating  frequent and lifelong red blood cell (RBC) transfusions . As each RBC unit 
contains approximately [ADDRESS_109447] in the formation of 
free radicals  and leading to morbidity and mortalit y. Accordingly,  life-long iron chelation 
therapy is necessary for survival.  
Deferiprone (3 -hydroxy -1,2-dimethylpyridin -4-one) is a bidentate iron chelator that binds 
ferric iron tightly in a 3:1 (deferiprone:iron) molar ratio and has markedly lesser affinity for 
other cations.  Deferiprone’s small molecular size, lack of charge at physiological pH, and 
balanced octanol:water partition coefficient support cell permeability and rapid access to 
both extracellular and intracellular labile iron stores.1 
Immediate -Release Deferiprone  
Three commercial oral formulations of immediate  release (IR) deferiprone are currently 
marketed by [CONTACT_99337].  under  the brand name [CONTACT_99374]®:  500 mg film -coated tablets, 
1000 mg film -coated tablets, and a 100  mg/mL oral solution. In the European Union, all 
[ADDRESS_109448] been approved by [CONTACT_3558] (EMA) for the 
treatment of iron overload in p atients with thalassemia major for whom deferoxamine 
therapy is contraindicated or causes serious toxicity. In the [LOCATION_002], the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) has approved the 500 mg tablets and the 100 mg/mL oral solution for 
the treatment of pa tients with transfusional iron overload due to thalassemia syndromes when 
current chelation therapy is inadequate ; and in Canada, all three formulations of Ferriprox 
were  approved in [ADDRESS_109449] be  taken three times a day, at a total daily  dosage of 75 up to 99 or 100 mg/kg  
(i.e., 3 equal doses of 25 to 33 mg/kg t.i.d.).  However, p ost-marketing feedback from both 
clinicians and patients has indicated that the number of tablets per day, as well as t he need to 
take a dose  in the middle of the day, creates a situation where the choice  is sometimes  made 
to forgo the mid -day dose , particularly in the case of  school -age children .  The scale of this 
omission has not been formally assessed, but the frequenc y with which ApoPharma is asked 
if Ferriprox can be taken twice instead of three times  daily supports the intuitive sense that 
mid-day dosing is a bona fide  concern for a significant  segment of the  patient  population.

 Delayed -Release Deferiprone  
In an ef fort to improve patient compliance, ApoPharma Inc. has develop ed a 1000 mg 
delayed release (DR) deferiprone tablet that would support twice -daily (b.i.d.) administration 
instead of the t.i.d. regimen required for the IR tablets.  It contains an enteric coat ing to 
significantly decrease drug release in the stomach , and the composition of the core allows 
half-tablets to provide similar bioavailability of drug as that from a whole tablet .  To date, the 
DR formulation has been assessed in  four ApoPha rma-sponsored trials  in healthy volunteers :  
two that looked at pharmacokinetics (PK)  and two that looked at tolerability, with one of the 
tolerability studies adding a special focus on the effect of this formulation on liver enzyme 
levels . 
In the first PK study , LA53 -0116  (N=28 ), healthy volunteers received a single [ADDRESS_109450]  (equivalent to about 15  mg/kg  for a subject weighing 70 kg ) in the forms 
of a whole tablet  under fed conditions , a whole tablet  under fasting conditions, and two half-
tablets under fed conditions. In the second , LA45 -0116  (N=36 ), healthy volunteers subjects  
received a total daily dosage of [ADDRESS_109451]  (equivalent to about 45  mg/kg  
for an average -weight subject ), divided into [ADDRESS_109452] trial and as a t.i.d. regimen in the second, 
and both involved a comparison of the safety and tolerability of the two formulations  as 
well as o f PK parameters .  It was demonstrated that the extent of drug exposure (i.e., AUC) 
of the DR formulation was equivalent to that of the IR tablet after a single dose. There were 
no significant food effects on the pharmacokinetics of the DR formulation. There were also 
no differences in drug exposure between a whole tablet and two half -tablets  of the DR 
formulation. At steady state, the PK profile of the two dose adminis trations of DR over a 
24-hour period  under fed conditions demonstrated  a peak (i.e., C max) and extent of drug 
exposure that were equivalent to those of the  three dose administrations of IR over a [ADDRESS_109453] tablet at this dosage was found to be safe and 
well tolerated . 
Study  LA58 -0117 , with a planned sample size of 86, was a Phase I study that evaluated 
the gastrointestinal (GI)  tolerance of deferiprone DR.  Healthy subjects were randomized to 
receive the highest approved dosage  (100 mg/kg daily ) of either deferiprone DR or 
Ferriprox IR for [ADDRESS_109454] received 50 mg/kg b.i.d., while those  
randomized to Ferriprox received 33 m g/kg t.i.d. While the study was still in progress, it was 
observed that of the [ADDRESS_109455] formulation, 31.6%  
experienced nausea and 26.3%  experienced vomiting, compared to rates of 20.0% and 0.0%, 
ApoPharma Inc.  Deferiprone delayed release [ADDRESS_109456] in the fasting state . The subsequent study, LA60 -0118  
(N=50) , assessed the tolerability of  deferiprone DR  in healthy volunteers in the fed state , 
which is the condition under which iron-overloaded patients will be instructed to take it , as 
its [ADDRESS_109457]  
was set at 100 mg/kg/day ( 50 mg/kg b.i.d.), which i s the maximum recommended dose that 
would be prescribed to patients for the treatment of systemic iron overload.  While LA60 -0118  
was in progress, it was observed that half the subjects dosed to date had asymptomatic 
elevated levels of alanine aminotransfe rase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 
with approximately 20% reaching values of approximately  5 times the upper limit of normal 
(ULN) and [ADDRESS_109458] dose.  The protocol was amended to reduce the 
dosage for the remaining  subjects  to 75 mg/kg/day (37.5 mg/kg b.i.d.), which is the dose  
normally pr escribed  for the treatment of  iron-overload  at the start of therapy, in order to 
evaluate if there is a dose -related effect with regard to elevation of liver enzymes  in healthy 
volunteers .  That study is ongoing.   
1.2 Rationale  
According to pharmacokinetic bioequivalence criteria, adverse events that depend on C max 
and/or AUC would be expected to be the same for two formulations that provide  equivalent 
Cmax and AUC over a [ADDRESS_109459] shown that ALT 
values in individual patients fluctuate , with declines from baseline of up to 369 U/ L and 
increases from baseline of up to 564 U/ L.[ADDRESS_109460] been observed in up to 60% of patients treated with deferiprone.3  In the 
majority of these patients, the increase is asymptomatic and return s to baseline levels without 
discontinuation or dose reduction of deferiprone. In ApoPharma clinical trials, e levations of 
liver enzymes led to discontinuation of deferiprone therapy in only 5  of 889 patients ; 4 (0.4%)  
due to increased serum ALT levels and 1 (0.1%) due to an i ncrease in both ALT and AST.  
ApoPharma Inc.  Deferiprone delayed release [ADDRESS_109461] on liver 
enzyme levels. S ome i ncreases are to be expected in this population, due to liver iron 
overload and frequent blood transfusions, and may be considered acceptable.  In recognition 
of this, study participants’ past record of liver enzyme levels will be taken into account  when 
assessing safety concerns .  With regard to other adverse effects, because of the higher than 
expected rates of gastrointestinal events that were observed in healthy volunteers (studies 
LA58 -0117  and LA60 -0118), attention will be paid to the occurrence of GI events as well.  
Finally, in addition to the assessments of safety and tolerability, the study will allow for 
patients’ input on the acceptability of this new formulation and of the change in dosing from

Whether this difference extends to patients with system ic iron overload is not yet known.  
Nevertheless, n o other safety concerns were identified following a 3 -day dosing period in 
healthy volunteers.  
Comprehensive  safety information  on Ferriprox is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure 
for that product.[ADDRESS_109463] common adverse reactions were nausea, 
vomiting, and chromaturia  (seen in more than 10% of patients) and  increased ALT , arthralgia, 
and neutropenia  (seen in more than 1% of patients); and  the most serious adverse reaction was 
agranulocytosis, defined as an absolute  neutrophil count (ANC) less  than 0.5 x 109/L.  
Agranul ocytosis has been reported  in approximately 2% of patients taking Ferriprox, and l ess 
severe epi[INVESTIGATOR_22573] (ANC < 1.5 x 109/L but > 0.5 x 109/L) have been reported in 
approximately 6.4%  of patients . In clinical trials, all events of agranulocytosis or neutropenia 
resolved upon discontinuation of Ferriprox.  Because of this known risk, participants in the 
present study will undergo safety monitoring  that includes  a weekly blood count to ensure early 
detection in case of a significant dr op in ANC.

3 STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 Description of Study Design  
This is a m ulti-center open -label study in patients with transfusion -dependent blood disorders  
who are currently taking deferiprone immediate release tablets (Ferriprox) for the treatment of 
systemic iron overload.   There will be two treatment grou ps, defined as “low dosage” (Group 
A) and “high dosage” (Group B).  With Ferriprox, the recommended starting dosage is 75 
milligrams  per kilogram of body weight (mg/kg) per day  and the recommended maximum is 
100 mg/kg  per day, but for many patients, the pr ecise daily amount differs from either of these 
values  since doses must be tailored to the individual patient’s response and therapeutic goals 
and rounded to the nearest half -tablet . Study participants will be assigned to Group A or Group 
B depending on which end of the range their Ferriprox intake is closer to, with equal numbers 
of patients enrolled in each group:  
• Group A, low dosage:  Patients currently taking Ferriprox tablets at a dosage that is 
closer to 75 mg/kg /day (n=15)  
• Group B, high dosage:  Patients currently taking Ferriprox tablets at a dosage that is 
closer to 100 mg/kg /day (n=15)  
ApoPharma Inc.  Deferiprone delayed release [ADDRESS_109465] tablets to be taken twice 
daily (b.i.d.) for [ADDRESS_109466] been taking three times daily (t.i.d.) as closely as possible. Individual doses will be 
rounded to the nearest [ADDRESS_109467] dose, patients wi ll return to their regular chelation regimen.  
Screening will be conducted within 14 days prior to the start of dosing, and with the exception 
of hematology, laboratory results obtained at that time will be treated as the baseline values. 
Blood s amples will  be collected for the assessment of biochemistry (screening and Days 3, 7, 
14, 21, and 28), hematology (screening, baseline, and Days 7, 14, 21, and 28), serology 
(screening only), and other safety parameters (screening and Day 28); and urine samples will 
be collected for urinalysis (screening and Day 28).  For the Day 3, 7, 14, and 21 samples, 
patients may choose to visit a local laboratory instead of  the study site; if this is done, they 
must use the same laboratory throughout the entire study.  If deemed necessary, patients with 
ongoing adverse events may be asked after the last dose to provide further blood samples for 
up to 30 days or until resolut ion. On Day 28, patients will be asked for their views on the 
acceptability of the delayed release formulation vs. the immediate release (Ferriprox) tablets .   
Any patient who withdraws before completing treatment will be requested to return for an 
Early Termination visit, at which time the procedures scheduled for the Day [ADDRESS_109468] to  enrollment is described below.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Criteria for Safety Concerns  
As a consequence of  liver iron overload and frequent blood transfusions , patients in the target 
population may have fluctuations of AST and/or ALT that frequently exceed the reference 
ranges.   In recognition of this variability, for each of these enzymes, the criteri a for de ciding 
whether an individual patient’s increases during the current study is of concern will be set as 
follows:  
 
ApoPharma Inc.  Deferiprone delayed release 1000 mg tablets  
LA61 -0218  Clinical Study Protocol, v  1.0 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 19 of 58 
 • For a patient whose baseline level  is within the normal range, the criterion will be 
reaching a value of [ADDRESS_109469] during the study.  
• For a patient whose baseline level is above the ULN, the criterion will be reaching a 
value of [ADDRESS_109470] be 
reported to ApoPharma by [CONTACT_19452] 24  hours of occurrence, using the sponsor’s 
SAE form .   
If at any time during the study a patient’s ALT and/or AST values reach a level of [ADDRESS_109471] , 
do the following:  
• If the patient is symptomatic and/or has any other clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory results, immediately withdraw the patient from the study.  
• If the patient is asymptomatic and has no other clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory re sults, interrupt treatment and obtain a confirmatory count the next day.  
• If the value is confirmed to be ≥[ADDRESS_109472] : 
o Stop treatment , withdraw the patient  and complete all end of study 
assessments scheduled for Day 28  
o Document the event and report it within 24 hours  to ApoPharma  
o Monitor the patient daily until the elevated value returns to a level that is 
regarded  as not clinically significant  
• If the confirmatory value is found  to be < [ADDRESS_109473] , resume treatment as per 
protocol, and monitor liver enzyme levels within 3 days of resuming therapy.  
[IP_ADDRESS]   Rules for Enrollment  
The rules that will be applied for enrolling patients in each group are described below , using 
the criteri a provided in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  Decisions will be made by a safety committee 
whose composition is described  in Section  8.  
Sites will enroll and start the dosing of patients in both groups . Once enrollment has 
reached [ADDRESS_109474] group to reach an N of 5 is Group A  (low-dosage) : 
• If there are no safety concerns after one week of dosing , the safety committee will 
issue approval for enrol lment of  all remaining patients in Group A and enrollment in 
Group B up to 5 patients. (The criteria for enrollment in Group B are described below.)  
• If [ADDRESS_109475] 5 patients in Group A reach the criteria defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] ,  
the committee will issue approval  for enrollment of just [ADDRESS_109476] been dosed to date reach the 
criteria defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] , enrollment of additional patients in both groups  
will be put on hold, and the following processes are to be conducted:   
▪ Any patients who have reached the criterion and are symptomatic and/or 
have other associated abnormal laboratory values  are to be withdrawn 
from the study.  
▪ Patients who did not reach the criterion and for whom there are no other 
safety concerns should continue dosing.  
▪ Patients  who did reach the criterion but are asymptomatic and do not have 
any other associated abnor mal laboratory values should continue dosing , 
but must have  their enzyme levels monitored every 2 days:  
• If just one patient experiences a confirmed elevation of ALT and/or 
AST ≥[ADDRESS_109477] , that patient is to be withdrawn from the study , but 
enrollment of the final 5 Group A patients may proceed .  
• If two or more patients experience a confirmed elevation of ALT 
and/or AST ≥[ADDRESS_109478] group to reach an N of 5 is Group B  (high -dosage) : 
• If there are no safety concerns after one week of dosing, enroll all remaining patients in 
the study.  
• If [ADDRESS_109479] 5 patients in Group B reach the criteria defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] , 
the committee will issue approval for enrollment of just [ADDRESS_109480] 1 week of dosing.   
(Enrollment may continue in the meantime in Group A, provided the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_99314].)  
o At this point, if there are no safety concerns, the committee will  issue approval for 
enrollment of the final [ADDRESS_109481] been dosed to date reach the 
criteria defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] , enrollment of additional patients in Group B  will 
be put on hold , and as the processes  described below  are to be conducted . 
(Enrollment may continue in the meantime in Group A , provided the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_99315].)  
▪ Any patients who have reached the criterion and are symptomatic and/or 
have other associated abnormal laboratory values  are to be withdrawn 
from the study.  
▪ Patients who did not reach the criterion and for whom there are no other 
safety concerns should continue dosing.  
▪ Patients who did reach the criterion but are asymptomatic and do not have 
any other associated abnormal laboratory values  should continue dosing  
but must have  their enzyme le vels monitored every 2 days:  
• If just one patient experiences a confirmed elevation of ALT and/or 
AST ≥[ADDRESS_109482] , that patient is to be withdrawn  from the study , but 
enrollment of the final Group B patients may proceed.   
• If two or more patients experience a confirmed elevation of ALT 
and/or AST ≥[ADDRESS_109483] promptly meet to review all 
available safety data and recommend whether or not the study should 
continue  
 
Repeat assessments to confirm laboratory results may be performed.  The decision on whether 
to put the study on hold or terminate it  will be made by [CONTACT_56317] .

3.2 Ration ale for Study Design  
Study  population: To date, f our Phase I trials  have been or are currently being conducted to 
assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of deferiprone delayed release tablets in 
healthy volunteers.  This study will be the first to look at the DR  formulation in the population  
for which it is  intended. It is possible that the rates of adverse events that were seen in healthy 
subjects would occur at different rates  in patients, due to the different  action of an iron chelator  
in iron -overloaded vs. non -iron-loaded recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
Dosage s:  Patients with systemic iron overload are usually prescribed deferiprone at a dosage 
ranging from 75 mg/kg/day to 100 mg/kg/day.  Dosages within both the upper half and the 
lower half of this range  will be investigated, to determine if there is a dose eff ect on the 
adverse events that were seen in healthy subjects  (due to tailoring of dosages to individual 
patient needs  and to rounding , most potential subjects will not be  on a dosage of 
Ferriprox that is exactly  75 mg/kg /day or exactly 100 mg/kg /day).  In all cases, the total 
daily dosage of deferiprone DR will be made  to match that of Ferrip rox IR as closely as 
possible. Since dosages will be rounded to the nearest 500 mg and body weights of participants  
will differ , some variability is unavoidable.  
Safety Precautions :  The findings from the first  [ADDRESS_109485] been defined that will mandate extra  monitoring or 
termination  from the study in any patient in whom they are observed .  Information  on alert 
events is provided in Section 4.5.1 . 
Endpoints :  The endpoints are safety and acceptability.  No endpoints for efficacy have been 
included, as  bioequivalence of deferiprone DR tablets to Ferriprox IR tablets over a 24 -hour 
period has already been demonstrated.  
3.3 Rationale for Selection of Doses  
For Ferriprox, dosages of 75 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day represent the most common  
starting  dose and the maximum recommended dose, respectively, of the therapeutic dose 
range approved for patients with systemic iron overload .  The dosage groups in this study 
will be  within either  the upper half or the lower half of this range . 
The Phase I studies  LA58 -0118 and LA60 -0118 , conducted in healthy volunteers, both evaluated 
the maximum recommended dose of deferiprone ( 100 mg/kg/day) w ithout the titration that is 
ApoPharma Inc.  Deferiprone delayed release [ADDRESS_109486], there were higher than expected percentages of 
subjects with GI events  and elevated liver en zymes.   It is possible that  starting  the dosing  
directly at 100 mg/kg/day with no titration may have been a factor  in the occurrence of both 
types of  events. It  is also known  that healthy volunteers  are more  adversely impacted by [CONTACT_99338]-overloaded patients would not be .  That is, these events  may 
prove to be less prominent in the latter since with them, deferiprone will rapi[INVESTIGATOR_99316].  
As the maximum  recommended  dosage of deferiprone is essential in some patients, it is 
important to assess dosages at the high end of the range  in the target population, with safety 
measures in place to ensure that participants are not placed at undu e risk. In the case of liver  
enzymes, increases  in ALT and AST  are commonly observed in patients with transfusion -
dependent thalassemia, irrespective of deferiprone therapy, and thus the clinical significance of 
any increase needs to be evaluated in individual patients based on their medical history.   
Comparison of the  low and high  dosages  will allow for assessment  of a dose effect  of 
deferiprone .  In healthy volunteers, in contrast to the elevated ALT and AST level s seen at 
100 mg/kg/day, no such concerns were observed in the earlier study LA45 -0116 , which  
employed a f ixed dosage of 1500 mg b.i.d., the equivalent of about 20 mg/kg in an average -
weight (70 kg) person . There would be no purpose in assessing a sub -therapeutic dosage in 
patients, but it will be of interest to see if there are fewer or less severe liver enzyme 
elevations  in the lower dosage group .

occurred, and use  of concomitant medications.  A withdrawn patient should return for an 
early termination visit and a follow -up visit. All investigational product and materials should 
be returned.  If any AEs occurred, the investigator must attempt to follow up the outcome 
until resolution . 
If a patient withdraws or is withdrawn before completing the study, the date and reason for 
the withdrawal must be entered on the source document and on the appropriate  page of the 
electr onic case report form ( eCRF), and all other appropria te eCRF pages must be completed.  
4.5.[ADDRESS_109494] be 
carefully monitored , and in some cases may mandate withdrawal of a patient or even early 
termination of the study.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Elevated Liver Enzymes  
A patient  who reaches  an ALT and/or AST value  ≥[ADDRESS_109495]  at any time during the study  is 
to be immediately  withdrawn  if he or she is additionally symptomatic and/or has any other 
clinically significant abnormal laboratory results . If there are no other signs of concern, a 
confirmatory count is to be obtained the next day .  If the value  is confirmed , the patient is 
to be withdrawn; if it is not, the patient is to be  closely monitored .  Details are provided in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Neutropenia  
A sudden drop in absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is a reaction  that has been associated with 
deferiprone treatment and is considered an adverse event of special interest.   ANC values 
will be monitored  throughout the study.  For a case of mild, moderate, or severe neutropenia 
to be confirmed, there must be 2 consecutive counts  of ANC , a maximum of 3 days apart ,

 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 27 of 58 
 that are both less than a specific  value. If at any time, a patient’s confirmed ANC level is 
found to be below < 1.5 x 109/L, the investigator is to do the following:  
• Mild neutropenia:   If the confirmed ANC is < 1.5 x 109/L but ≥1.0 x 109/L, continue 
treatment without interruption, but monitor ANC every 2 days until resolution.  
• Moderate neutropenia:  If the confirmed ANC is < 1.0 x 109/L but ≥ 0.5 x 109/L, 
interrupt treatment and monitor ANC every 2 days until resolution . The patient should  
re-initiate treatment once the event is resolved . If ANC is still < 1.5 x 109/L after 14 
days, withdraw patient from the study and monitor until resolution of the event.  
• Severe neutropenia  / agranulocytosis : If a single ANC is < 0.5 x 109/L, immediately 
interrupt  treatment without waiting for confirmation of the count  and obtain a second 
measurement  the following day.  If the second ANC is still < 0.5 x 109/L, permanently  
withdraw t he patient from the study  and follow the procedures for the management 
of agranulocytosis . 
Details on  the management of each category of neutropenia are provided  in Section [IP_ADDRESS].2 . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Infection  
If a patient report s any symptoms indicative of infection such as fever, sore throat, or flu -like 
symptoms, interrupt treatment immediately  and obtain an ANC measurement, and monitor 
ANC more frequently; every 2 days if it is below  <1.5 x 109/L but ≥ 0.5 x 109/L.  Therapy 
can be re-initiated once all symptoms have been resolved and it is deemed safe by [CONTACT_1275].   (If ANC is found to be above 1.5 x 109/L, treatment can be continued  if the  
investigator assesses the patient and considers continuation to be safe . Treatment  should be 
interrupted in any case of fever of 38.5 °C or greater. )  
4.5.[ADDRESS_109496] agree to use an 
approved method of contraception (as defined in inclusion criterion # 5) throughout the 
course of the trial.  If a patient does become pregnant, the investigator must do the following  
upon becoming aware of the pregnancy : 
• Ensure that the study medication is stopped immediately  
• Inform the sponso r via the pregnancy report form  
• With the patient’s consent, follow the pregnancy  closely , and provide reports to the 
sponsor until delivery or other resolution

discretion of the invest igator.  All medications  (including  study product, herbal medications, 
and over -the-counter medications) and nutrition al supplements taken from 3 months prior to 
screening  up to the end of the study ( Day 28 or early termination) must be reviewed by [CONTACT_99341].  
4.[ADDRESS_109498] 3 months  (i.e., closer to  75 mg/kg /day or closer to 100 
mg/kg/day ) and must remain on their assigned  dosage for the duration of the study.  If it is 
determined during the study that a change in dosage or the addition of another  chelator is 
required to control iron load, that patient will be withdrawn from the trial.

5.[ADDRESS_109503] at approximately the same 
daily  dosage that they are currently on.  Those  who are presently on  Ferriprox at a dosage 
closer to 75 mg/kg/day  will be assigned to Group A , and those who are presently on  
Ferriprox at a dosage closer to  100 mg/kg/day will be assigned to Group B .  In both cases , the 
total dosage of  deferiprone DR will be as close as possible to that of Ferriprox , but divided 
b.i.d. instead of t.i.d.  
5.[ADDRESS_109504]  3 digits represent the site code (00 1 for site  #1, 002 for site

For example, if site #1 enrolls 8 patients, the ID number s will be 00 1001 to 00 1008.  The 
assigned ID numbers of patients who are screening failures or who withdraw from the study  
will not be reused . 
5.5 Treatment Compliance  
Compliance will be determined as follows: 1) the patient  will keep a daily record of  the 
number of tablets taken , and 2) at Day [ADDRESS_109505] amount of medication , the site will report compliance as 100% in the eCRF , and 
will provide the reason for the apparent over -compliance (e.g., tablets were accidentally 
spoiled and could not be ingested), along with the actual percentage . Both u nder-compliance  
< 80% and  over-compliance >120% will be reported as a protoc ol deviation , unless under -
compliance is due to treatment interruption because of infection or neutropenia or other 
extenuating circumstances  (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
[ADDRESS_109506]  
Deferiprone delayed release (DR) 1000 mg is a white to off -white, capsule -shaped, beveled

 7 MEASUREMENTS AND EVA LUATIONS  
7.1 Safety Measurements  
7.1.1 Medical Events , Adverse Events,  and Serious Ad verse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of Medical  Events  and Adverse Events  
Medical Event  (ME) : Any new untoward medical occurrence  or worsening of a  pre-existing 
condition  in a clinical trial participant  that occurs after signing the informed consent form 
(ICF) but befo re receiving the first dose of  study drug . 
Adverse Event  (AE): Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient who is administered a 
pharmaceutical or other therapeutic product  in a clinical study , not necessarily having a 
causal relationship with the product . An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign, symptom , or disease temporally associated with the use of a product, whether or not 
considered related to that product.  
AEs include:  
• Exacerbation of a pre -existing illness , including  acute epi[INVESTIGATOR_99320]/crisis of a chronic 
underlying condition  
• An increase in frequency or intensity of a pre -existing epi[INVESTIGATOR_3756]  
• A condition detected or diagnosed after study treatment administration, even though it 
may have been present prior to the start  of the study  
• A continuous persistent disease or symptom present at baseline that worsens following 
the start of the study  
• Accidents (e.g., involving a motor vehicle)  
• Reasons for changes in concomitant medication ( type of drug and/or dose)  
• Medical, nursing , or pharmacy consultation  
• Admission to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_99321]  
• Abnormal ities in  laboratory findings (e.g., clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis), 
ECG , or other assessments (e.g. , vital signs) that are not part of a larger medical 
condition already recorded as an AE and which are judged by [CONTACT_99347]. The investigator should exercise medical and scientific judgment in 
deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is 
clinically significant.  
 
ApoPharma Inc.  Deferiprone delayed release 1000 mg tablets  
LA61 -0218  Clinical Study Protocol, v 1.0 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 38 of 58 
 AEs do not include:  
• A pre -existing disease or condition present or detected at the start of the study that does 
not worsen  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_99322] s urgical procedures that had been planned prior to enrolment into 
the study  
• The disease o r disorder being studied, or a sign or symptom associated with that disease 
or disorder, unless it has worsened  
• An overdose of either the study treatment or concurrent medication without any signs or 
symptoms  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Monitoring and Documenting of Medical Event s and Adverse  Events  
Prior to enrolling a patient , study site personnel will note the occurrence and nature of any 
medical condition(s) in the source documents and the a ppropriate section of the eCRF. 
During the study, they will note any change in the conditio n(s), and the occurrence and 
nature of any MEs/ AEs.  MEs will be collected from the time the ICF is signed  until the first 
dose of study drug , and AEs will be collected from the time the treatment starts  until [ADDRESS_109510] dose . 
AEs and SAEs that are related to the underlying medical condition for which the patient 
enrolled in the clinical trial will be recorded separately  from others . 
Patients will be instructed to report any MEs/ AEs to the investigator  or a delegate .  In 
addition, at site visits and telephone calls, the investigator will solicit information about the 
occurrence  of MEs/ AEs through open -ended , non-leading verbal question s such as:  
• How are you feeling?  
• Have you  had any medical problems since the last vi sit? 
• Have you taken any new medic ations , other than that provided in thi s study, since the 
last visit?  
Based on the patient’s response to these  question s, the investigator or delegate should ask 
additional questions relevant to the specific complaint, such  as: 
• How severe is/was the symptom?  
• How often did the symptom occur?  
• How long did the symptom last?  
The patient should also be questioned about any previously reported AEs that have not 
resolved.  
ApoPharma Inc.  Deferiprone delayed release 1000 mg tablets  
LA61 -0218  Clinical Study Protocol, v 1.0 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 39 of 58 
 The i nvestigator will evaluate a ll AEs/MEs for their relationship to the investigational 
product (Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ), intensity (Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ), and seriousness  (Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ), and 
will document any measures taken to address the event .  There should be an  attempt to 
establish a diagnosis of the AE based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. 
Wherever possible, a diagnosis should be documented , rather than t he individual signs/
symptoms. All information is to be clearly recorded in the source documents.  
If the dosage of study drug is reduced or treatment is discontinued as a result of an AE, the 
circumstances leading to such reduction or discontinuation  must be clearly documented . 
All AEs must be followed until resolution, the condition stabilizes, the event is otherwise 
explained, or the patient is lost to follow -up. The investigator is responsible for ensur ing that 
follow -up includes any supplemental i nvestigations that are  needed  to elucidate the nature 
and/or causality of the AE  as completely as possible . This may include additional laboratory 
tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care 
professionals . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Causality  
The relationship of an AE to the study drug should be determined by [CONTACT_99348], including associative connections (time or place),  
pharmacological explanations, previous kn owledge of the drug, presence of characteristic 
clinical or pathological phenomena, exclusion of other causes, and/or absence of alternative 
explanations. The causal relationship of an adverse event to study drug will be assessed 
according to the following  criteria (based on World Health Organization definitions):  
• Not related:  Temporal relationship to study drug administration is missing or 
implausible, or there is no evident cause.  
• Possibly related : Reasonable time sequence to administration of study drug,  but 
event could also be explained by [CONTACT_19010].  
• Probably related:  Reasonable time sequence to administration of study drug, and 
unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or 
chemicals, and follows a  clinically reasonable response on 
withdrawal (de -challenge). Re -challenge information is not required.  
• Definitely related:  Plausible time relationship to study drug administration , and cannot 
be explained by [CONTACT_9153].  The 
response to withdrawal of the drug (de -challenge) should be 
clinically plausible. The event must be definitive pharmacologically 
or phenomenologically, using a satisfactory re -challenge procedure 
if necessary.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 40 of 58 
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Intensity  
Intensity  refers to the degree  of discomfort  or impairment  associated with an event . The 
intensity  of MEs/AEs  is to be reported on the  eCRF . To maximize consistency  in assessment, 
the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) scale is to be used.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious Adverse Event s 
An SAE is an adverse event occurring at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life -threatening adv erse event  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• A persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• A congenital anomaly in the offspring of a patient who received the study treatment  
• An important medical event that does not result in death, is not  life-threatening, and does 
not necessitate hospi[INVESTIGATOR_99323]’s judgment may jeopardize 
the patient and may necessitate  medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of those  
outcomes. Examples includ e allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or tre atment -related 
substance abuse.  
 
Clarificati ons: 
• “Life-threatening ” means that the patient was, in the view of the investigator, at 
immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred. This definition does not include an 
event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing condition that did not worsen 
during the study is not considered an AE.  
• Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084]. If a complication prolongs 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the event is considered an SAE.  
• “Inpatient” hospi[INVESTIGATOR_99324] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_99325]. This may or may not be overnight. It does not include presentation at a 
casualty or emergency room unless the event meets one of the other crit eria for being an SAE.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 41 of 58 
 • With regard to the criteria for an important medical event , medical and scientific 
judgment should be used in deciding whether prompt reporting is appropriate in this 
situation.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting of Serious Adverse Event s 
All SAEs occurring up to  [ADDRESS_109511] report all SAEs to the sponsor within 24 hours  of occurrence 
or notification by [CONTACT_102], using the sponsor’s SAE form. The sponsor will provide 
contact [CONTACT_72080]. An assessment of caus ality must be provided at the 
time of the initial report. In the case of an SAE that is fatal or life -threatening, the  
investigator or delegate must then complete and submit a follow -up SAE form to the sponsor 
within [ADDRESS_109512] report all SAEs to their IRB/IEC  as well as to the sponsor .  If any SAE 
that is considered  at least possibly related to the study medication and is unexpected  occur s at 
one site, the  sponsor will promptly inform all other sites of  this, and  all investigators must 
then report this event to their own IRBs/IECs, following the same timelines as above or 
following local IRB/IEC polic y, whichever takes precedence.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Follow -up and Document ation of SAEs  
SAEs that occur during the study and up to  [ADDRESS_109513] be 
documented in the patient’s medical record and on the SAE report form. The investigator 
should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other 
clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis rather than the individual signs/symptoms 
should be documented as the SAE.  
All SAEs must be followed until resolution, the condition stabilizes, the event is otherwise 
explained, or the patient is lost to follow -up. The investigat or is responsible for ensuring  that 
follow -up includes any supplemental investigations that may be indicated , in order  to 
elucidate the nature and/or causality of the SAE  as completely as possible . This may include 
additional laboratory tests or investigat ions, histopathological examinations, or consultation 
ApoPharma Inc.  Deferiprone delayed release [ADDRESS_109514] of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations.  
If a patient dies during participa tion in the study or during a specified  follow -up period, the 
sponsor should be sent a copy of any post -mortem find ings, including histopathology.  
New or updated information is to be recorded on the originally completed SAE report form , 
with all changes si gned and dated by [CONTACT_093].  
The clinical research associate ( CRA ) will verify the original SAE report form against the 
source documents at the next monitoring visit.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_109515] that meet the criteria described in Section 3.1.1  to the sponsor within 24 hours 
of occurrence, using the sponsor’s SAE form.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_109516] be monitored for neutropenia, defined as a confir med 
absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 1.5 x 109/L. Categories of neutropenia are as follows:  
 
Mild:  A confirmed ANC < 1.5 x 109/L but ≥1.0 x 109/L  
Moderate:  A confirmed ANC < 1.0 x 109/L but ≥ 0.5 x 109/L 
Severe  / agranulocytosis:  A confirmed ANC < 0.5 x 109/L 
For a case of neutropenia to be confirmed, there must be [ADDRESS_109517] 
a single ANC value less than  1.5 x 109/L this is to be documented in the eCRF as an AE of 
“decreased ANC”, but is not to be defined as neutropenia.   The investigator is to use judgment 
as to whether the decrease is clinically significant.  
In addition to having ANC monitored, patients  will be advised to immediately report any 
symptoms indicative of infection such as fever  (≥ 38.5°C) , sore throat, and flu-like symptoms  
at any time during treatment or during the first week following treatment. They will be 
ApoPharma Inc.  Deferiprone delayed release [ADDRESS_109518] information , and advised to carry it 
with them at all times.  
Depending of the severity of neutropenia, patients will either remain in or be withdrawn 
from the study. The management of different severities o f neutropenia  is described below.  
Mild and moderate neutropenia:  
A patient  who develop s mild neutropenia is to  continue treatment without interruption , but 
ANC is to be monitored every 2 days  until resolution .  
A patient  who develop s moderate neutropenia is to  interrupt treatment as soon as the 
neutropenia is confirmed , and ANC is to be monitored every 2 days  until resolution . 
The patient should re -initiate treatment once the event is resolved , defined as 2 consecutive 
ANC ≥ 1.5 x  109/L. If ANC is still < 1.5 x 109/L after 14 days, the investigator is to do the 
following : 
• Withdraw  patient from the study and monitor  him/her until resolution of the event  
• Advise  patient regarding protective isolatio n 
• Examine  patient the same day (if possible) , including drug h istory and physical 
examination  
• Notify ApoPharma Inc. using the SAE form  
Severe neutropeni a/agranulocytosis:  
A patient  in whom a single ANC measurement < 0.5 x  109/L is detected is to immediately 
stop treatment, without waiting for confirmation of the count,  and a second measurement is 
to be done the following day. If the second ANC is still  < 0.5 x  109/L, the patient  is to be 
permanently w ithdrawn  from the study , and ANC is to be monitored daily  until resolution . 
The following procedures should be done by [CONTACT_99349], as 
appropriate:  
• Provide protective isolation; if clinically indicated, admit patient to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_99326] 4 hours  
• Examine the patient the same day, if possible, including drug history and physica l 
examination  
• Notify ApoPharma Inc. using the SAE form.  
The following additional measures describe a suggested medical management and 
monitoring:

 • If possible , consider obtain ing bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_99327]:  
o Histology  
o Progenitor culture  
o Frozen storage (1 mL sample)  
• If possible , consider obtain ing bone marr ow biopsy (minimum length 3 mm)  
• Perform septic work -up including chest X -ray, bl ood, urine , and throat cultures  
• Obtain q4h temperatures from patient (monitored by [CONTACT_99350]) 
• If warranted, administer granulocyte stimulating factors, such as G -CSF 10 μg/kg, on 
an in-patient basis if possible, beginning the same day that the ANC is confirmed as 
< 0.5 x 109/L; administer daily until ANC is > 1.5 x 109/L on 2 consecutive days  
• If ANC < 0.5 x 109/L for 7 days, repeat bone marrow biopsy and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_99328] o f agranulocytosis, if warranted  
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Infections  
If a patient develops fever  (≥ 38.5°C)  or symptoms and signs  of that indicate systemic 
infection  (e.g., chills, sore throat, mouth ulcers)  during the study, deferiprone must be 
interrupted immediately , and neutrophil count should be obtained and monitored more 
frequently ; every 2 days if ANC is <1.5 x 109/L.  Therapy with deferiprone can be  
re-initiated onc e all symptoms have been resolved and it is deemed safe by [CONTACT_093].

if there is blood in the urine or three or more “plus 
signs” for protei n.)  Screening and Day 28  
 
Pregnancy testing:   Beta-HCG qualitative serum 
pregnancy test  Screening and Day 28  
 
Notes:  
• With the exception of hematology, laboratory results obtained at screening will be 
treated as the baseline values.  
• There will be a window of ±1 day for assessments done at Days 3 and 7, and of 
±2 days for assessments done at Days 14, 21, and 28.  
• The investigator may increase the frequency of safety evaluations if deemed 
appropriate for assessment of any clinically significant adverse event.  In the case of 
increases in liver enzymes that meet the criteria for being considered a safety concern, 
the patient is to be followed until resolution of the event, beyond Day 28 if necessary.  
• If a patient  withdraws from the study, the End of Study procedures are to be

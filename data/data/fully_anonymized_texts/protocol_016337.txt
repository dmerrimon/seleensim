Grade 1 TRAEs indicative of local reactogenicity (injection-site pain, erythema, 
induration). Systemic reactogenic AEs (fever, myalgia, headache) and Grade [ADDRESS_520419] ( Section 10.2 ). 
If a TRAE SI is identified, the site will notify the medical monitor who will review 
and determine if treatment should be continued. 
For TRAE SIs occurring during VP-[ADDRESS_520420] injection of the dose and resolves within 1-hour, the second 
injection of the dose may continue. 
For TRAE SIs Grade 2 (per CTCAE V5)  and higher reactions, the investigator 
must stop further injections in accordance with TRAE SI/DLT descriptions 
(Section 10.2). and Tryptase must be collected per protocol (Section 8.4.5). 
If there is a clinically significant AE or abnormal laboratory result at the EOS visit, 
follow-up (F/U) visits may be required until resolution of the abnormality, or until the 
condition is considered clinically stable. 
All AEs including TRAE SIs should be recorded on the subject’s AE Form.

Study Design: This is an open-label, multicenter, proof-of-concept study with a safety run-in 
designed to assess the safety, tolerability, MTD, and objective antitumor efficacy of VP-[ADDRESS_520438] 1 eligible target lesion (confirmed by [CONTACT_413010]). 
This is a 2-part study with sequential enrollment. All enrolled subjects will receive VP-315 
intratumoral injection on an outpatient basis into up to 2 target lesions: 
Part 1  (N= 2 to 8): VP- 315 once-daily dosing; starting total daily dose of [ADDRESS_520439]. Ascending once-daily 1-mg dosing increments (e.g., 2 mg on 
Day 1, 3 mg on Day 2). Subjects may be treated for a maximum of 
[ADDRESS_520440] cohorts in 1-mg increments after 
the previous cohort has completed Week 1 dosing (the DLT observation 
period) ( Figure 7-1 and Figure 7-2 ).
Part 2  (N= Approximately 66 to 72):VP-315 once-daily dosing; will be a total daily dose of 
8 mg in up to 5 cohorts (i.e. there were no DLTs that occurred during 
Part 1 and the maximum dose of 8 mg was achieved).
 Cohort 1 (N=3-6): VP-315 once-daily dosing of 8 mg with a loading 
dose of half the target dose of 8 mg (i.e. 4 mg) only on W1D1; all
remaining doses will be the full target dose without a loading dose.
Subjects will be treated until the lesion is necrosed, for a maximum of 
2 weeks (W1D1, W1D2, W1D3 and W2D1, W2D2, W2D3 – up to 
6 total doses). 
Cohort 2  (N=3-6): VP-315 once-daily dosing of 8 mg on all treatment days (i.e., NO LOADING dose on W1D1) for up to 3 consecutive daily doses/week until the lesion is 
necrosed, for a maximum of 2 weeks (W1D1, W1D2, W1D3 and W2D1, W2D2, W2D3 – up 
to 6 total doses).

Verrica Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential 13October 2023 The study design and dosing strategy listed below for Cohorts 3, 4 and 5 are 
recommendations from the Safety Review Committee following an adhoc safety review 
meeting held on June 13-14, 2023 to discuss subjects reports of pain and burning at the 
injection site that were not observed in Part 1 of the study: 
 Recommendation: Remove/skip Cohort 3 in Part 2 of the protocol and advance from 
Cohort 2 to Cohorts 4 and 5.  Revert to Part 1 dosing strategy of a 30/70 split dose for 
all treatments with the injections 19dministered 15-minutes apart. 
 
Cohort 3 (N=0)This cohort has been removed at the recommendation 
of the SRC. : This cohort has been removed upon the completion of 
Cohort 2.  
For Part 2 (Cohorts 4 and 5) the highest total daily dose of VP-315 (8.0 mg) will be divided 
into a split dose; the first dose is not to exceed 2.4 mg (30% of 8-mg dose), and the 
remaining dose will not exceed 5.6 mg (70% of 8-mg dose) and administered 15 minutes 
apart (not to exceed 30 minutes).
 Cohort 4 (N=Approximately 30 [10 initial/up to 20 expansion]): 
(Two times weekly dosing) VP-315 once-daily dosing of 8 mg, 
administered on 2 consecutive days in one week (W1D1, W1D2). The 
planned dosing regimen will be a split dose of VP-315 for all 
treatments. The 500µL (8 mg) dose will be divided into [ADDRESS_520441] 15 minutes and no more than 30 minutes apart, with 
30% (150 µL) administered in the first injection and the remaining 
70% (350 µL) with the second injection. Treatment for a second 
Target Lesion may begin on D1 of the next week (W2D1, W2D2). 
Each individual target lesion is treated for the assigned 2 days only 
(regardless of necrosis status). Up to 2 target lesions may be treated – 
up to 4 total doses .
Cohort 5 (N=Approximately 30 [10 initial/up to 20 expansion]): 
(Three times weekly dosing) VP-315 once-daily dosing of 8 mg, 
administered on 3 consecutive days in one week (W1D1, W1D2, 
W1D3). The planned dosing regimen will be a split dose of VP-315 
for all treatments. The 500µL (8 mg) dose will be divided into 
[ADDRESS_520442] 15 minutes and no more than 30 minutes 
apart, with 30% (150 µL) administered in the first injection and the 
remaining 70% (350 µL) with the second injection. Treatment for a 
second target lesion may begin on D1 of the next week (W2D1, 
W2D2, W2D3). Each individual target lesion is treated for the 
assigned 3 days only (regardless of necrosis status). Up to 2 target 
lesions may be treated – up to 6 total doses .

Protocol VP-315-201 – Amendment [ADDRESS_520444] 4 days. Dosing will commence in a single target lesion. In Part 1 and Part 2 
Cohorts 1and 2, once a target lesion has necrosed, treatment of that lesion stops, and 
treatment of a subsequent target lesion (up to 2 total, including the original target lesion) may 
continue on Day 1 of the following week. In Part 2 Cohorts 4 and 5 , treatment of a second 
target lesion begins on W2D1 (not based on status of necrosis of target lesion 1). 
For the first 10 subjects enrolled into Cohorts 4 and 5: after each treatment, subjects will 
remain in the study center for up to 2-hours post second injection for safety monitoring 
(e.g., continuousblood pressure, electrocardiographic and AE monitoring).   
Following the final treatment of the 10th subject in Cohort 4, enrollment into Cohort 5 may be 
initiated for 10 subjects.   
Cohort 4 expansion group : 
An SRC meeting was convened after the 10 subjects in Cohort 4 completed the Safety 
Assessment and approved the following: 
Up to 20 additional subjects (for a total of approximately 30 subjects) will be 
enrolled into Cohort 4. 
 After each treatment, the additional subjects enrolled into Cohort 4 expansion: 
will remain in the study center for up to 1-hour (reduced from 2-hours) post 
second injection for safety monitoring (e.g., continuousblood pressure, 
electrocardiographic and AE monitoring), an additional hour may be continued at 
the discretion of the PI.

Protocol VP-315-201 – Amendment [ADDRESS_520457] commonly diagnosed cancer in the [LOCATION_002] (US), with 
nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) being the most common malignancy in the US 
[Karimkhani , 2015 ] [Madan , 2010 ]. National incidence estimates based on the most recent 
year that new statistics were available (2012) estimated more than 5.4 million cases of 
NMSC were treated in more than 3.3 million people in the US, exceeding the number of all 
other cases of human malignancies combined [ Rogers , 2015 ; AAD ,2020 ; Skin Cancer 
Foundation ,2021 ]. Data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey estimated an annual 
increase in treatment for NMSC (2002 to 2011) in US adults from 3.1 to 4.3 million 
[Guy, 2015 ].  
Current estimates show that the approximately 80% of NMSC cases occur in people  years of age, and that the number of cases in this population could increase by [CONTACT_147393] 50% by 2030, illustrating the significant worldwide healthcare burden of NMSC, 
particularly in light-skinned populations [ Diffey , 2005 ] [Karimkhani , 2015 ]. Similar 
increases in basal cell carcinoma (BCC) incidence rates have been shown in other studies 
[Sveinbjørnsson , 2017 ] [Wu,2013 ] [Goldenberg , 2016 ] [Adalsteinsson , 2020 ].
While skin cancers have a low mortality, the average annual total cost for skin cancer

Surgery is the most common treatment for BCC and includes procedures such as excision, 
curettage and electrodesiccation, and Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS). Both excision and 
curettage leave scarring of the treatment area; MMS aims to reduce scarring, particularly in 
treatment areas near the eye or other areas of the face, but is a complex, protracted surgery 
requiring specialized training.

these studies generated data that assisted in the selection of a tolerable clinical starting dose. 
Based on observations in rats and dogs, an acute reduction in mean arterial pressure was 
observed after intravenous (IV) administration and likely resulted from vasodilation in 
peripheral circulation with a decrease in total vascular resistance and was not considered to 
be a direct cardiac effect. In vitro studies evidenced that this transient hemodynamic effect 
may be caused by [CONTACT_413014]-[ADDRESS_520464] cells 
affecting peripheral blood pressure (BP) by [CONTACT_413015].  
2.2.[ADDRESS_520465] of LTX-315, at concentrations up to 100 µM, on the catalytic activity of 
the 9 major human CYP450 isozymes was investigated in vitro using pooled human liver 
microsomes and isozyme-specific probe substrates [R315-24]. The inhibition profile of 
LTX-315 was assessed using both a 5- and 30-minute preincubation period to ascertain 
whether any inhibition observed was reversible (direct competitive) or irreversible 
(mechanism-based or time-dependent). LTX-[ADDRESS_520466] 
marked inhibition was observed with CYPs 2A6, 2C8, 2C9, and 3A4 (testosterone) where 
IC50values were all between 7 and 10 µM. There was little or no evidence for irreversible 
LTX-315 
Protocol VP-315-201 – Amendment [ADDRESS_520467] reduction in IC 50was 
observed with CYP2B6, where IC 50values of 28 and 19 µM, following a 5- or 30-minute 
preincubation respectively, indicating that some mild time-dependent inhibition was a 
possibility. In many cases, the IC 50increased following 30 minutes preincubation, suggesting 
either instability of LTX-315 in the incubation conditions, or metabolism to a less inhibitory 
metabolite. Based upon these results, it is considered unlikely that LTX-315 would 
participate in, or contribute to, inhibitory drug-drug interactions in vivo which are mediated 
by [CONTACT_097]450-dependent metabolism. 
2.2.4 Toxicology 
The maximum tolerated IV dose was 2 mg/kg in the rat (equivalent to a human dose of 
0.324 mg/kg) and was limited by [CONTACT_413016]. In the dog, the 
maximum tolerated IV dose was considered to be 1.25 mg/kg based on vital clinical signs. 
The maximum tolerated concentration of LTX-315 in normal skin was determined to be 
5 mg/mL in the rat and 10 mg/mL in dog, with maximum dose volumes of approximately 
0.75 mL/injection site in rat (3 mL/kg) and approximately 2.5 mL/injection site in dog 
(0.25 mL/kg). 
2.2.[ADDRESS_520468] been 
concluded (C08-315-01, C09-315-02 as well as a Phase I/II (C12-315-03); these studies 
evaluated the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of LTX-315 injection at varying 
dose strengths in subjects with tumors accessible for percutaneous injection, including those 
located in cutaneous, subcutaneous, oral regions, and in lymph nodes. Overall, the antitumor 
activity (tumor necrosis) of LTX-315 was observed in a number of subjects, showing marked 
tumor regression in both the injected and noninjected lesions. The immune analysis of tissue 
samples (C12-315-03) clearly demonstrated that LTX-315 has the ability to invoke necrosis, 
stimulate clonal T-cell expansion, and increase the repertoire of activated and targeted 
T cells, both within the injected tumors and in the peripheral blood [ Spi[INVESTIGATOR_18551] , 2021 ]. 
The most frequently reported adverse events (AEs) in these initial clinical studies were 
hypersensitivity related reactions that included flushing, fatigue, hypersensitivity, and 
injection-site swelling, particularly when LTX-315 was administered at dosages above 8 mg 
as a single injection. In subjects with cutaneous, subcutaneous, oral, or lymph node lesions, 
including highly vascularized locally advanced or metastatic tumors, hypersensitivity-related 
AEs leading to discontinuation were noted. Discontinuations in response to hypersensitivity-
related AEs, however, were eliminated following amendment of the study protocols to reduce 
the maximum dose to 5 mg per injection and to limit the duration of treatment to 3 weeks. 
Additional information on clinical studies may be found in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
LTX-315 
Protocol VP-315-201 – Amendment [ADDRESS_520469] in 
the selection of a tolerable clinical starting dose.
In the Phase 1 monotherapy dose-escalation study (C08-315-01), 14 subjects received 
injections of intratumoral LTX-315 at doses ranging from 1.4 mg to 9.0 mg on Day 1. Grade 
2 AEs were not noted at doses below 4.0 mg on Day 1, a determinative factor in the proposed 
LTX-315 starting total daily dose of 2.0 mg in the current study. Additionally, BCC lesions 
are expected to be less vascularized than the malignancies injected to date, which is also 
expected to further reduce systemic effects.  
In C08-315-01, at LTX-315 doses below 4.0 mg, the AEs occurring on Day 1 had a short 
duration (minutes), and at all doses became less severe and of shorter duration with 
additional LTX-315 exposure. Similarly, preclinical testing (IV administration in rats) 
indicates that LTX-315–related hypotension is a result of a direct effect on peripheral 
vasculature (without any central cardiac effect) and exhibits a tachyphylaxis effect (i.e., the 
largest reduction in BP occurs following the first LTX-315 dose; subsequent identical 
LTX-315 doses resulted in diminished BP reductions). For these reasons, the proposed total 
daily dose of VP-315 will be administered in 2 injections, with the initial 30% (150 µL) of 
the VP-[ADDRESS_520470] injection, and the remaining 70% (350 µL) 
administered at least 15 minutes and no more than 30 minutes later. In all parts of the study, 
the targeted total volume of delivery is 500 µL daily. The Safety Review Committee (SRC; 
see Section 7.4.1 ) may determine in Part [ADDRESS_520471] proposed total daily dose of VP-315(8.0 mg), is broken 
into two administrations at least 15 minutes apart (not to exceed 30 minutes), with the first 
dose not to exceed 2.4 mg (30% of 8-mg dose), and the remaining dose will not exceed 
5.6 mg (70% of 8-mg dose); both doses are well below the historical 8 mg maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD). Therefore, the maximum dose of VP-315 in the proposed study 
(8.0 mg) and maximum concentration (16.0 mg/mL) should be well within the safety limits 
established in the previous Phase 1 monotherapy study. 
For Part 2 (Cohorts 4 and 5) the highest total daily dose of VP-315 (8.0 mg) will be divided 
into a split dose; the first dose is not to exceed 2.4 mg (30% of 8-mg dose), and the 
remaining dose will not exceed 5.6 mg (70% of 8-mg dose) and administered 15 minutes 
apart (not to exceed 30 minutes). This dosing strategy was selected as a recommendation 
from the Safety Review Committee following an adhoc safety review meeting held on June 
13-14, 2023 to discuss subjects reports of pain and burning at the injection site that were not 
observed in Part 1 of the study:

4 and 5.  Revert to Part 1 dosing strategy of a 30/70 split dose with the injections 
adminstered 15-minutes apart. 
2.3.2 Rationale for the Study Design 
LTX-315 has not previously been evaluated in BCC. While the dose has been established for 
malignant tumors, a safe and efficacious dose has not been established in otherwise healthy 
subjects, for whom the alternative treatment for BCC would be surgical excision. Therefore, 
a safety run-in to confirm the appropriate dose range will be conducted as part of the current 
study. 
The current study comprises 2 parts. Part 1 is designed to explore the initial VP-315 safety 
profile when administered in escalating doses to individual subjects with BCC, starting at 
2 mg and ending at a maximum of 8 mg total daily dose to a single lesion. This strategy is 
intended to quickly assess the MTD and gain preliminary assessment of VP-315 induction of 
clinical and histological necrosis of each treated lesion while seeking to establish an AE 
profile for BCC. Centralized photography and Cutaneous Reaction Assessment (CRA) by [CONTACT_413017]-315. 
During Part 1 of the study, no DLTs were reported, and escalation up to 8 mg total daily dose 
(the maximum dose for this study) was achieved. Therefore, Part 2 is designed to determine 
the optimal dosing regimen using 8 mg of VP-315 identified in Part 1 and confirm the 
optimal dosing regimen determined from Cohorts 4 and 5 to be used in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_412977]. 
Pharmacokinetic data will be collected to characterize the PK of an 8 mg dose of VP-315 
administered with the optimal dosing regimen in Part 2 (Cohorts 4 and 5 expansion group).

All enrolled subjects will receive VP-315 intradermal injection on an outpatient basis into up 
to 2 target lesions. In all Parts of the study (1, or 2, as below), each 7-day treatment week 
comprises up to [ADDRESS_520475] 
4 days. Dosing will commence in a single target lesion. In Study Part 1 and Study Part 2 
(Cohorts 1-2), once a target lesion has necrosed, treatment of that lesion stops, and treatment 
of subsequent target lesions (up to 2 total) may continue on Day 1 of the following week 
(week 2) (see Section 7.3.2 ). 
Part 1  (N= 2 to 8): VP-315 once-daily dosing; starting total daily dose of [ADDRESS_520476]. Ascending once-daily 1-mg dosing increments (e.g., 2 mg on 
Day 1, 3 mg on Day 2). Subjects may be treated for a maximum of 
[ADDRESS_520477] cohorts in 1-mg increments after 
the previous cohort has completed Week 1 dosing (the DLT observation 
period) ( Table 7-1 ).  
Part 2  (N= Approximately 66 to 72): VP-315 once-daily dosing; will be a total daily dose of 
8 mg in up to 5 cohorts (i.e, there were no DLTs that occurred during 
Part 1 of the study and the maximum dose of 8 mg was achieved).  Cohort 1  (N=3 to 6): VP-315 once-daily dosing of 8 mg with a 
loading dose of half the target dose of 8 mg (i.e., 4 mg) only on 
W1D1; the remaining [ADDRESS_520478] treatment week (up to

without a loading dose. Subjects will be treated until the lesion is 
necrosed, for a maximum of 2 weeks (W1D1, W1D2, W1D3 and 
W2D1, W2D2, W2D3- up to 6 total doses). 
 Cohort 2  (N=3 to 6): VP-315 once-daily dosing of 8 mg on all 
treatment days (i.e., NO LOADING dose on W1D1) for up to 
3 consecutive daily doses/week until the lesion is necrosed, for a

powder for injection that will be reconstituted in saline to a concentration ranging from 4 to 
20 mg/mL based upon the target dose and volume for each subject. The single excipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], 
water for injection (WFI), is of pharmacopeial quality; the WFI is removed by [CONTACT_27197]. 
LTX-315 is supplied in colorless glass vials (Ph. Eur. hydrolytic class I) fitted with a rubber 
stopper (Ph. Eur. type I). 
7.2.2 Storage and Handling 
Unreconstituted LTX-315 vials (20 mg/vial) must be stored as follows: 
 refrigerated at 2-8°C (36- 46°F) or  
 frozen at -20 ± 5 °C (-13° to 5°F)  
protected from light at the study site, separated from other drugs. 
The reconstituted LTX-315 solution can be stored for up to 12 hours in a refrigerator at 
2-8°C (36–46°F). Syringes with LTX-315 drawn from the vial can be stored for up to 4 hours
at 20-25°C (68-77°F) protected from light. Any unused portion should be discarded.

Protocol VP-315-201 – Amendment 8 Page 48 of 94
Verrica Pharmaceuticals Inc. Confidential 13October [ZIP_CODE].3 Dosage, Administration, and Schedule
VP-315 will be administered via intradermal injection into a single target lesion (between 
cm in longest diameter) using the 1-mL syringe and 30-gauge ½-inch needle 
provided by [CONTACT_413025]. The subjects should be positioned in a way so that the target lesion lies 
flat, to avoid any dependent areas that may be susceptible to leakage of VP-315. Subsequent 
injections for the same lesion will be given in remaining nonnecrotic areas of the lesion, as 
assessed prior to treatment. In Parts 1 and Part 2 (Cohorts 4 and 5), each 500-µL dose will be 
divided into [ADDRESS_520497] 15 minutes and no more than 30 minutes apart, with 
30% (150 µL) administered in the first injection and the remaining 70% (350 µL) with the 
second injection. In all parts of the study, the targeted total volume of delivery is [ADDRESS_520498]. The second (350-µL) portion shall be injected in a clockface fashion (i.e., 12, 3, 6, 
9 o’clock [ shown below in Figure 7-1 ]) as needed to ensure uniform distribution, into the 
edges of the lesion to infiltrate the entire tumor with VP-315. Insert the needle at a 10- to 
20-degree angle for a flat lesion, or at an increased angle for a raised lesion. Subcutaneous 
injection should be avoided.

In Part 1, for any Grade 1 (per CTCAE V5) postinjection reaction (with the exception of 
local reactogenicity) occurring during VP-[ADDRESS_520501] stop further injections in accordance 
with TRAE SI/DLT descriptions ( Section 10.2 ). 
In Part 2, subjects will continue to be closely monitored for any safety signaling. If a TRAE 
SI is identified ( Section 10.2 ), the medical monitor will review and determine if treatment 
should be continued. 
7.3.2 VP-315 Dosing Strategy 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study Part [ADDRESS_520502]. Subjects will receive ascending once-daily doses (increasing in 1-mg 
increments for up to 3 days in a 7- 4 days off between treatment 
weeks]) until the first lesion is necrosed or until the subject experiences a DLT, whichever 
occurs first ( Figure 7-2 ). Subjects will be observed for DLTs throughout the treatment period 
during Part 1. 
After receiving a dose, the subject will return to the clinic the following day for assessment 
by [CONTACT_093]. If, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_412984] (see Section 7.4 ), there has been no DLT 
and if the lesion is not necrotic, the dose will be escalated, and the same lesion will continue 
to be treated before any additional target BCC lesions may be treated.  
When a target lesion is deemed necrotic in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_412984], the subject will not 
receive any additional treatment for that lesion, and a safety assessment visit will be 
performed instead. If the subject has additional lesions and no DLT has occurred, treatment 
of the next lesion may begin on day 1 (D1) of the next week. A maximum of [ADDRESS_520503] cohorts in 1-mg increments after the 
previous cohort has completed Week 1 dosing (the DLT observation period) ( Table 7-1 ). 
Dose escalation in Part 1 will end when 2 subjects experience a DLT at the same nominal 
dose (indicating that the preliminary MTD has been exceeded, and the preliminary MTD is 
the dose immediately below where any DLT occurred) or until a maximum VP-315 total 
daily dose of 8 mg is reached in up to 6 subjects.

Verrica Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential 13October 2023 [IP_ADDRESS] Study Part 2 
Part 2 will be initiated upon completion of Part 1 to determine the optimal dosing regimen of 
VP-315. There were no DLTs observed in Part 1 of the study and the maximum dose of 8 mg 
was achieved. Therefore, the dose to be evaluated in Part 2 will be a total daily dose of 8 mg 
in the following 5 Cohorts:  
 Cohort 1  (N=3-6): The planned dosing regimen in Week 1 of Part 2 will begin 
with a VP-315 loading dose on Week 1/Day 1 (W1D1) at half the target dose, 
followed by [CONTACT_413026], until the lesion is necrosed. Additional weeks of treatment 
will not include a loading dose on W2D1. Subjects may be treated for a maximum 
of 2 weeks (W1D1, W1D2, W1D3 and W2D1, W2D2, W2D3 – up to 6 total 
doses).
 Cohort 2 (N=3-6): VP-315 once-daily dosing of 8 mg on all treatment days (i.e., no 
loading dose on W1D1) up to 3 consecutive daily doses/week for up to 2 weeks 
(W1D1, W1D2, W1D3 and W2D1, W2D2, W2D3 – up to 6 total doses ).  
The study design and dosing strategy listed below for Cohorts 3, 4 and 5 are 
recommendations from the Safety Review Committee following an adhoc safety review 
meeting held on June 13-14, 2023 to discuss subjects reports of pain and burning at the 
injection site that were not observed in Part 1 of the study:  Recommendation: Remove/skip Cohort 3 in Part 2 of the protocol and advance 
from Cohort 2 to Cohorts 4 and 5. Revert to Part 1 dosing strategy of a 30/70 split 
dose for all treatments with the injections adminstered 15-minutes apart.
Cohort 3  (N=0): This cohort has been removed at the recommendation of the SRC.  
For Part 2 (Cohorts 4 and 5) the highest total daily dose of VP-315 (8.0 mg) will be divided 
into a split dose; the first dose is not to exceed 2.4 mg (30% of 8-mg dose), and the 
remaining dose will not exceed 5.6 mg (70% of 8-mg dose) and administered 15 minutes 
apart (not to exceed 30 minutes).
 Cohort 4 (N= Appproximately 30 (10 initial/up to 20 expansion): (Two times weekly 
dosing) VP-315 once-daily dosing of 8 mg, administered 2 consecutive days in one 
week (W1D1, W1D2).  The planned dosing regimen will be a split dose of VP-315 
for all treatments. The 500µL (8 mg) dose will be divided into [ADDRESS_520504] 15 minutes and no more than 30 minutes apart, with 30% (150 µL) administered 
in the first injection and the remaining 70% (350 µL) with the second injection. 
Treatment for a second target lesion may begin on D1 of the next week (W2D1, 
W2D2). Each individual target lesion is treated for the assigned 2 days only 
(regardless of necrosis status). Up to 2 target lesions may be treated – up to 4 total 
doses. 
 Cohort 5  (N= Approximately 30 (10 initial/up to 20 expansion): (Three times weekly

administered in the first injection and the remaining 70% (350 µL) with the second 
injection. Treatment for a second target lesion may begin on D1 of the next week 
(W2D1, W2D2). Each individual target lesion is treated for the assigned 3 days only 
(regardless of necrosis status). Up to 2 target lesions may be treated – up to [ADDRESS_520506] has additional lesions, treatment of the next lesion may begin on D1 
of the next week. A maximum of 2 target BCC lesions may be treated, and only 
1 lesion may be treated at a time.
 Subjects in Cohorts 4 and 5 with only 1 target lesion that complete week one of 
treatment and the W1 safety assessment visit without complete necrosis should 
return for a Limited Safety Assessment Visit on W2D1 for further evaluation of 
the lesion for necrosis.  No additional treatment will be provided. 
 Subjects in Part 2 (all Cohorts) that complete week two of treatment and the W2
Safety Assessment Visit without complete necrosis should return for a Limited 
Safety Assessment visit on W3D1 for further evaluation of the lesion for necrosis. 
No additional treatment will be provided. 
For the first 10 subjects enrolled into Cohorts 4 and 5: after each treatment, subjects will 
remain in the study center for up to [ADDRESS_520507] second injection for safety monitoring 
(e.g., continuous blood pressure, electrocardiographic and AE monitoring).  
Following the final treatment of the 10th subject in Cohort 4, enrollment into Cohort 5 may be 
initiated for 10 subjects.   
SRC Meetings
Two separate SRC meetings were convened after 10 subjects in each initial cohort (4 and 5) 
completed the Safety Assessment Visit to review the following topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]: 
o to review the safety signals that may have occurred that could impact further treatment 
o to determine if the 2-hours of safety monitoring could be reduced to 1-hour post 2nd
injection at treatment (an additional hour may be continued at the discretion of the PI).
o to dermine if enrollment could be expanded to include up to 20 additional subjects for a 
total of approximately 30 subjects in each cohort.   
The SRC approved the following for both Cohorts 4 and 5:
 Up to 20 additional subjects (for a total of approximately 30 subjects) will be 
enrolled into Cohorts 4 and 5 (expansion groups) respectively. 
LTX-315 
Protocol VP-315-201 – Amendment 8 Page 52 of 94 
Verrica Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential 13October 2023 After each treatment, the additional subjects enrolled into Cohorts 4 and 5 
expansion groups: will remain in the study center for up to 1-hour (reduced from 
2-hours) post second injection for safety monitoring (e.g., continuous blood 
pressure, electrocardiographic and AE monitoring), an additional hour may be 
continued at the discretion of the PI. 
Plasma PK sampling will be collected in subjects in Cohorts [ADDRESS_520508] injection of VP-315, subjects will return for all target and 
nontarget BCC lesions ( Section 5.4 ) to be excised for histological evaluation. If the lesion(s) 
has clinically cleared, the area where the lesion was will be excised, and tissue samples will 
be sent to the central dermatopathologist for analysis/histology. Suture removal and final 
photography should occur 7 (±1) or 14 (±2) days after excision (7 days on the face and 
14 days on the body). Subjects with excised lesions on both the face and the body will be 
required to complete 2 end-of-study (EOS) visits accordingly. 
During the study period, subjects will be expected to visit the study facility and complete 
study procedures as outlined in the schedule of assessments ( Table 8-1 ). 
Management of TRAEs/TRAE SIs (see Sections  7.3.1and  10.2) 
Subject dosing will continue until any TRAE of any grade occurs, with the exception of 
Grade 1 TRAEs indicative of local reactogenicity (injection-site pain, erythema, induration). 
Systemic reactogenic AEs (fever, myalgia, headache) and Grade [ADDRESS_520509] ( Section 10.2 ). 
If a TRAE SI is identified, the site will notify the medical monitor who will review and 
determine if treatment should be continued. 
For TRAE SIs occurring during VP-[ADDRESS_520510] 
injection of the dose and resolves within 1-hour, the second injection of the dose may 
continue. 
For TRAE SIs Grade 2 (per CTCAE V5)  and higher reactions, the investigator must stop 
further injections in accordance with TRAE SI/DLT descriptions ( Section 10.2) and Tryptase 
must be collected per protocol (Section 8.4.5 ). 
If there is a clinically significant AE or abnormal laboratory result at the EOS visit, follow-up 
(F/U) visits may be required until resolution of the abnormality, or until the condition is 
considered clinically stable. 
All AEs including TRAE SIs should be recorded on the subject’s AE Form. 
Subjects may be discontinued for AEs at any time per the discretion of the investigator.

of DLTs will result in termination of dosing in that subject. Additionally, the following 
considerations will be made based on the occurrence of DLTs: 
Part 1 of the study : Dose escalation in Part 1 will end when 2 subjects experience a DLT at 
the same nominal dose (indicating that the preliminary MTD has been exceeded) 
Part 2 of the study : For Grade 2 TRAE SIs and higher (per CTCAE V5), the investigator 
should discontinue VP-[ADDRESS_520515] Tryptase per protocol (Section 8.4.5 ) in that 
subject and the subject should return for all follow-up visits.

activities. Prospective subjects are expected to complete Screening evaluations (exclusive of 
biopsy) no more than [ADDRESS_520520] study drug administration 
(Day 1). Note: Subjects with a systolic BP <110 mmHg and/or diastolic BP <70 mmHg at the
Screening visit do not meet inclusion criteria and should not be enrolled into the study. 
At Screening, subjects will either provide a HISTORICAL  biopsy (punch or shave) collected 
according to clinical standard of care within [ADDRESS_520521] of care and 
include superficial or middle papi[INVESTIGATOR_412990]; suspected BCC lesions must meet the criteria 
described in Section 5.4 . 
Punch biopsies will be collected for suspected BCCs (a 2-mm punch biopsy for suspected  cm to 1.0 cm, and a 3-mm punch biopsy for suspected BCC >1.0 cm to 2.0 cm).
Biopsy sites should be closed with 1 to 2 non-absorbable sutures (sized 4-0 or 5-0) depending 
on investigator preference. Up to [ADDRESS_520522] of care.
All on-study treatment day visits and dosing should be scheduled from Day 1 (date of the 
first dose of study drug). 
During the study, every effort should be made to keep subjects on the timetable for 
procedures and assessments in accordance with the schedule of assessments ( Table 8-1 ). 
8.2 Treatment Period 
After completion of screening/baseline assessments ( Table 8-1 ), subjects will be enrolled to 
receive intratumoral VP-315. In Part 1, each 7-day treatment week comprises up to 
[ADDRESS_520523] 4 days.
After each treatment, all subjects in Part 1, Part 2 – Cohort 1, Cohort 2 and Cohorts 4 and 5 
(first 10 subjects in each) will remain in the study center for up to 2 hours for safety 
monitoring (e.g., continuous blood pressure, electrocardiographic and AE monitoring) After 
each treatment, the additional 20 subjects enrolled into Cohort 4 and 5 expansion groups: will 
remain in the study center for up to 1-hour (reduced from 2-hours) post second injection for 
safety monitoring (e.g., continuous blood pressure, electrocardiographic and AE monitoring), 
an additional hour may be continued at the discretion of the PI. Plasma PK sampling will be 
collected (in Part 2, Cohorts 4 and 5 expansion groups) as detailed in Table 8-1 .

Protocol VP-315-201 – Amendment [ADDRESS_520524] will return to the clinic the day after treatment for assessment by [CONTACT_093].
The treatment site will be photographed and assessed for CRA ( Appendix 1 ) and PGA of 
response to treatment ( Appendix 2 ), with images uploaded for real-time assessment by [CONTACT_203851] (Part 1) and/or Medical Monitor (Part 2). The CRA and PGA will be performed by [CONTACT_413032], at the EOT visit, and at the EOS 
visit.  
Subjects in Part 2 (Cohorts 4 and5) with only [ADDRESS_520525]-reported outcomes will be collected with the SCAR-Q 
(Scar appearance, Scar symptoms, and Psychosocial impact scales) ( Appendix 3 ) and 
relevant subscales of the FACE-Q (Satisfaction with outcome) completed at each Safety 
Assessment Visit, and EOT visit.  
8.3 End of Study and Follow-up 
Subjects will be required to return for excision at the EOT visit and F/U visits regardless of 
clinical appearance of the lesions, including all subjects who prematurely discontinue 
administration of the study drug for any reason. 
Scar Cosmesis Assessment and Rating (SCAR) Scale will be completed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_412991], prior to the excision. 
In accordance with the procedures noted in Table 8-1 , all target and nontarget BCC lesions 
will be surgically excised with a 3 mm- margin  to 6 weeks (Part 1) and 12 to 14 weeks (Part 
2) after receipt of the W1D1 injection, and a tissue sample will be sent to the central 
dermatopathologist for analysis/histology. If a lesion has clinically cleared, the area where 
the lesion was will be excised accordingly. 
Suture removal and final photography should occur 7 (±1) or 14 (±2) days after excision 
(7 days on the face and 14 days on the body). Subjects with excised lesions on both the face 
and the body will be required to complete 2 EOS visits accordingly.

8.5.1 Lesion Evaluation
At Screening, subjects will either provide a HISTORICAL  biopsy (punch or shave) collected 
within the [ADDRESS_520548] of care and will include superficial or middle papi[INVESTIGATOR_412990]. For punch 
biopsies, a 2-mm punch biopsy will be collected  cm to 1.0 cm, and a 
3 -mm punch biopsy will be collected for suspected BCC >1.0 cm to 2.0 cm, up to 
5 suspected lesions may be biopsied. All specimens (including HISTORICAL  samples) will 
be formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) and H&E stained slides of specimen slices 
will be prepared and reviewed locally to determine eligibility. The H&E stained slides will 
be sent to the central lab for imaging and high quality images of the slides will be sent to the 
central dermatopathologist for confirmation of analysis/histology. 
In accordance with the procedures noted in Table 8-1 , all target and nontarget BCC lesions 
will be surgically excised with a 3 mm- margin 4 to 6 weeks (Part 1) and 12 to 14 weeks 
(Part 2) after receipt of the W1D1 injection and tissue specimens preserved by [CONTACT_413004]. If a 
lesion has clinically cleared, the area where the lesion was will be excised accordingly. Both 
the screening and post-excision tissue blocks will be sent to the central lab for analysis of 
immune activation biomarkers including TILs by [CONTACT_413005]-IHC, as well as for 
sequencing of genomic DNA from the lesion specimens to assess changes in T-cell receptor 
clonality.
During the study, subjects will be monitored for signs of efficacy—specifically, evidence of 
necrosis in the treated lesion(s).  
8.5.2 Lesion Photography 
Prior to each treatment, each safety visit, prior to excision and EOS, the treatment site, as 
well as any additional non-treated lesions that are to be followed, will be photographed, and 
assessed for the CRA. Site(s) will be provided with specialized equipment and training for 
consistent quality photographs. Photographs may be collected and stored on digital media.  
Custom photographic equipment will be manufactured by [CONTACT_413039]. 
Canfield will provide each site with a laptop computer with Canfield’s proprietary Canfield 
Capture pre-installed on the equipment to guide site staff through all of steps of the image 
capture process required for this study. The software will be configured to include the 
specific visit schedule, image views and lighting modes to satisfy the needs of the study. In 
order to ensure consistent serial clinical photography is achieved during this study, all subject
photographs will be reviewed (monitored) on an ongoing basis. Digital images will be 
transferred to Canfield via the secure website. 
All images will be monitored for technical adherence to photographic protocol. Subject 
information, including site number, subject ID number, subject initials, and session date, will 
be entered into the database. The subject’s F/U images will be technically reviewed

8.6 Observer-reported Outcomes 
Scar Cosmesis Assessment and Rating (SCAR) Scale will be completed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_412991], prior to the excision (Appendix 5).  The scale includes six questions with six 
parameters scored by a clinician (scar spread, erythema, dyspi[INVESTIGATOR_371], suture marks, 
hypertrophy/atrophy, overall impression) and two simple questions regarding symptoms (itch 
and pain) with yes/no answer options that are answered by [CONTACT_102] [Kantor, 2016].  
8.7 Posttreatment Assessments 
Approximately 4 to 6 weeks (Part 1) and 12 to 14 weeks (Part 2) after the first treatment with 
VP-315, subjects will return to the clinic for excision (3 mm margin) of all BCC lesions for 
histological evaluation.  
A F/U visit will take place 1- or 2-weeks post excision (EOS visit). Suture removal and final 
photography should occur 7 (±1) or 14 (±2) days after excision (7 days on the face and 
14 days on the body). Subjects with excised lesions on both the face and the body will be 
required to complete 2 EOS visits accordingly. 
Subjects with AE(s) at the EOS visit will be contact[CONTACT_250076] 30 days after the EOS visit by 
[CONTACT_413041](s). The evaluations and/or procedures to be 
completed during EOT and EOS Visit are outlined in Table 8-1 .

Verrica Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential 13 October 2023 8.8 Assessment of the Immunological Response to VP-315 Treatment 
In a subset of subjects, the anti-tumor immunological response to VP-315 treatment will be 
assessed in the excised tissue obtained from basal cell tumor biopsies performed at pre-
screening (baseline) and at the approximate 12-[ADDRESS_520552]-treatment visit, as well as in 
peripheral blood samples acquired at the same time points. Analyses will include multiplexed 
immunofluorescence immunohistochemistry (IF-IHC) of slices from tumor tissue biopsies as 
well as assessment of T-cell clonality in both peripheral blood and in the same tissue 
obtained from the tumor biopsies. 
8.8.1 Multiplexed Immunofluorescence Immunohistochemistry 
Tissue sections from the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue from pre- and 
post-treatment biopsy samples will be analyzed by [CONTACT_413005]-IHC using fluorescent 
staining using a panel of 8 markers to identify tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) T-cell 
subsets and changes in immune activation.  
8.8.2 Assessment of T-cell Clonality 
The adaptive immune response to basal cell tumor antigens released following VP-315 
treatment will be assessed by [CONTACT_35755] T-cell clonal expansion in peripheral blood and the 
repertoire of T-cell clones infiltrated into the tumor tissue microenvironment using a highly 
sensitive next-generation T-cell receptor sequencing assay. gDNA for the assay will be 
obtained from the same FFPE tissue blocks used for the multiplexed IF-IHC described in 
Section 8.7.1 and from peripheral blood samples (3.0 mL) collected in BD Vacutainer™ 
tubes with K 2EDTA at the screening and approximate 12-week post-treatment visits.

The investigator and/or sponsor can decide to withdraw a subject(s) from protocol required 
procedures or from the study as a whole at any time prior to study completion. 
Withdrawal of consent from the study means that the subject does not wish to undergo 
further protocol-required procedures, and the subject does not wish—or is unable—to 
continue further study participation. Subject data up to the withdrawal of consent will be 
included in the analysis of the study and, where permitted, publicly available data can be 
included after withdrawal of consent. The investigator is to discuss with the subject 
appropriate procedures for withdrawal from the study. 
Reasons for removal from the study include any of the following:  
 subject request (withdrawal of consent) 
 safety concern (e.g., due to an AE, ineligibility determined, protocol deviation, 
noncompliance, requirement for alternative therapy, protocol-specified criteria, 
pregnancy) 
 decision by [CONTACT_3211] (other than subject request or safety concern)

Protocol VP-315-201 – Amendment 8 Page 74 of 94 
Verrica Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential 13 October 2023 10. SAFETY DATA COLLECTION, RECORDING, AND REPORTING
10.1 Adverse Events 
10.1.1  Definition of Adverse Events
Consistent with the US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 21 §312.32, an AE is 
defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an investigational 
product, regardless of its causal relationship to the investigational product.  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that any AEs observed by [CONTACT_093] (or 
staff) or reported by [CONTACT_413043]’s medical record.  
The definition of AEs includes worsening of a pre-existing medical condition. Worsening 
indicates the pre-existing medical condition (e.g., diabetes, migraine headaches, gout) has 
increased in severity, frequency, and/or duration, and/or has an association with a 
significantly worse outcome.  
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) include all AEs that occur during the treatment 
period (i.e., W1D1 through EOS).
Treatment-related adverse events (TRAE) include all AEs that occur during the treatment 
period (W1D1 through EOS) that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_412992]/procedure. 
Treatment-related adverse events of special interest (TRAE SI) will be reported in Part [ADDRESS_520555] (TRAE SI) will be defined as 
any one of the VP-315 related adverse events (AE) that occurs during the treatment visit 
listed in Section 10.2 . 
Interventions for pretreatment conditions (e.g., elective cosmetic surgery) or medical 
procedures that were planned before study enrollment are not considered to be AEs.
10.1.2  Reporting Procedures for Adverse Events 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs (i.e., those observed by [CONTACT_1275] [or staff] or reported by [CONTACT_423]) with an onset occurring any time between 
the subject providing the signed ICF through the completion of the F/U Visit are reported on 
the AE Summary eCRF.  
The investigator is required to assign the following AE attributes: 
 adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or symptoms)
 dates of onset and resolution 
 severity
 assessment of relatedness to study drug 
 action taken
LTX-315 
Protocol VP-315-201 – Amendment 8 Page 75 of 94 
Verrica Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential 13 October 2023 The investigator may be asked to provide F/U information, discharge summaries, and 
extracts from medical records or eCRFs. 
In Part [ADDRESS_520556] will be assessed by [CONTACT_7859]: “Is there a 
reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_7198]?”. 
The investigator should respond to this question with either Yes or No. 
If the AE occurred before VP-315 treatment, the relationship of the AE to study screening is 
to be assessed by [CONTACT_3553] a similar question: “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event 
may have occurred because of study screening?” The investigator should respond to this 
question with either Yes or No. If the answer is Yes, record what part of the study screening 
is suspected. 
Medically significant AEs considered by [CONTACT_413044]-[ADDRESS_520557] be 
recorded according to the following classification: unknown, completely resolved, resolved 
with sequelae, ongoing, death.  
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining whether 
an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a change from values before the 
study. In general, abnormal laboratory findings without clinical significance (based on the 
investigator's judgment) should not be recorded as AEs; however, laboratory value changes 
requiring therapy or adjustment in prior therapy are considered AEs. 
The investigator's clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be removed 
from treatment due to an AE. A subject, or subject's legal guardian, can also voluntarily 
withdraw from treatment due to an AE. If the subject withdraws consent, the subject is 
encouraged to attend, at a minimum, the EOS visit ( Table 8-1 ). 
10.1.3  Serious Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of Serious Adverse Events 
An SAE is defined as an AE that meets at least 1 of the following serious criteria:  fatal 
 life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death) 
 requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72824]/incapacity 
 congenital anomaly/birth defect, and/or  
 other significant medical hazard  
An AE would meet the criterion of “requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],” if the event necessitated an 
admission to a health care facility (e.g., overnight stay).  
LTX-315 
Protocol VP-315-201 – Amendment 8 Page 76 of 94 
Verrica Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential 13 October 2023 If an investigator considers an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any of the 
serious criteria, the event could be classified as an SAE under the criterion of “other 
medically important serious event.” Examples of such events could include allergic 
bronchospasm, convulsions, and blood dyscrasias. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse Events 
Serious adverse events will be collected and recorded at least throughout the study period, 
beginning with the signing of the informed consent through [ADDRESS_520558] will be collected and reported within 1 working day of 
discovery or notification of the event. 
Follow-up SAE information should be provided by [CONTACT_413045]. The investigator is obligated to answer queries and to submit requested 
F/U information for any SAE until the case is considered closed by [CONTACT_413046].  
The investigator should notify the appropriate IRB or ethics committee of SAEs occurring at 
the site and other AE reports received from Sponsor, in accordance with local procedures and 
statutes. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pregnancy Reporting 
Pregnancies are not considered SAEs; however, any pregnancy complication or an induced 
therapeutic abortion to terminate any pregnancy due to complications or other medical 
reasons will be recorded as an SAE. The underlying medical reason for this procedure should 
be recorded as the AE term. Furthermore, any SAE occurring as an adverse pregnancy 
outcome post-study must be reported to the Sponsor.
The investigator must report any pregnancies to the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor (using the Pregnancy Reporting Form) within [ADDRESS_520559]’s female 
partner or female subject becoming pregnant during the course of the study. Any pregnancies 
that occur within the [ADDRESS_520560] should continue until the conclusion of the pregnancy. Additional 
information regarding the pregnancy should be submitted to the Sponsor on the Pregnancy 
Form. The outcome should be reported to the Sponsor using the Pregnancy Outcome Form. If 
the end of the pregnancy occurs after the study has been completed, the outcome should be 
reported directly to the Sponsor.

Verrica Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential 13 October 2023 10.2 Dose-limiting Toxicity/Treatment-related Adverse Event of Special 
Interest  
For Part 1 of the study, a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as any of the following 
VP-315 related adverse event (AE) that occurs during the DLT period: 
For Part [ADDRESS_520561] (TRAE SI) will 
be defined as any on the following VP-315 related adverse (AE) that occurs during the 
treatment visit: 
Hypotension meeting any of the following definitions: 
 >20 mmHg decrease in systolic BP with absolute systolic BP <100 mmHg, or 
>20 mmHg decrease in systolic BP with clinical symptoms, or
 absolute diastolic BP <60 mmHg 
 Significant elevation of serum tryptase concentration is defined as an increase of 
1.2× baseline plus [ADDRESS_520562] 
 Any Grade 2 or higher local reactogenic AE (injection-site pain, erythema, 
induration) 
 Any Grade 2 or higher systemic reactogenic AEs (fever, myalgia, headache) 
 Any subject who experiences a DLT/TRAE SI will receive no further VP-315.  
If the DLT/TRAE SI is caused by [CONTACT_413006]-related event that is not listed in the 
consent form, Sponsor will revise the consent form appropriately and submit it to the IRB. 
All subjects will be advised of the new toxicity and their willingness to continue on study 
will be confirmed. When the amended consent form is approved by [CONTACT_1201], all subjects 
remaining on the study will be asked to sign the amended consent form.

Verrica Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Confidential 13 October 2023 11. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
11.1 General Considerations 
A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be provided that gives a complete description of the 
statistical methods to be used in this study. The SAP will describe the methods and data 
presentation to be used for the analysis of safety, efficacy, and PK outcome data. If analyses 
in the SAP do not align with the analyses described here, the SAP will identify where those 
methods differ. 
Analyses will be carried out by [CONTACT_16051] (Part 1 and Part 2). For Part [ADDRESS_520563] deviations, median, minimum, and maximum. Counts and percentages will be 
provided for categorical/ordinal variables. Unless specified otherwise, denominators for 
percentages will only consider non missing responses. For any summaries that involve 
change from baseline, baseline will be defined as the last measurement obtained prior to first 
injection of study drug. By-subject listings for all subjects will be provided for data collected.
11.2 Sample Size Considerations 
The sample size determination is not based on statistical power considerations, as the primary 
objective of this study is the assessment of safety and tolerability. However, the number of 
subjects enrolled in each study part should be adequate to meet the safety objectives and to 
provide preliminary evidence of efficacy. 
11.3 Analysis Populations 
The following populations will be used for the VP-315 study: 
 The Safety Population will include all subjects who take at least 1 dose of VP-315. 
Safety analyses will be conducted using the Safety Population.  
 Full Analysis Set (FAS): this set is a subset of all enrolled subjects, excluding 
subjects who do not receive at least 1 full dose of VP-315 and those with no 
assessment of histologic clearance. The FAS will serve as the primary population for 
the analysis of efficacy-related data.  
 Per-protocol Analysis Set (PPS): this set is a subset of the FAS, excluding subjects 
with important protocol deviations that may substantially affect the results of the 
primary efficacy analyses. The final determination on protocol violations, and thereby 
[CONTACT_413047], will be made before clinical database lock. The PPS may 
be used for supportive analyses.  
 PK Analysis Set: this set consists of subjects in the Safety Population with at least 
1 plasma sample with quantifiable concentration of VP-315.

LTX-315 
Protocol VP-315-201 – Amendment [ADDRESS_520564] Characteristics and Disposition 
Descriptive summaries of demographic and baseline characteristics for all enrolled subjects 
will be tabulated by [CONTACT_16051]. The number of subjects included in each analysis population 
will be summarized, along with the reason for exclusion from any analysis populations.
Subjects discontinuing from study drug or withdrawing from the study and the primary 
reason for discontinuation/withdrawal will be summarized. 
11.5.2  Safety Analyses 
All subjects who receive any amount of study drug will be included in the safety analysis. 
Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_16051]. 
All AEs will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary. Tabular summaries of AEs will only 
consider treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), which are defined as those AEs with a 
start date on or after first dose of study drug. The incidence of TEAEs will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_9313] (SOC), preferred term (PT), relationship to study drug, and severity. 
Serious TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_3592]. TEAEs leading to discontinuation as 
well as TEAEs identified as dose limiting toxicities will be listed and summarized if 
sufficient counts of either are reported. 
Hematology and serum chemistries will be summarized using conventional summary 
statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, and range). In addition, a change from baseline 
will be presented. Standard shift tables will also be prepared presenting toxicity grade vs 
baseline.  
Vital signs and ECG results will be summarized in a descriptive manner by [CONTACT_413048], standard deviation, median, and range in the same manner described for laboratory 
values. Change from baseline for vital signs and ECG parameters will also be summarized.
For ECG parameters, both QTcB (Bazett’s correction) and QTcF (Fridericia’s correction) 
will be displayed.  
Cutaneous Reaction Assessments will be summarized using counts and percentages for each 
severity level (none, mild, moderate, severe). Separate summaries will be presented for each 
cutaneous reaction type and visit.

dose prior to administration of the next VP-315 dose. Blood samples for PK will only be 
collected for subjects in Part2 (Cohorts 4 and 5 expansion groups) of the study.
Concentrations of VP-315 and metabolites will be determined in plasma using a validated 
bioanalytical assay(s). Individual subject VP-315 concentration-time data will be displayed 
using scheduled sampling times. Descriptive statistics (e.g., n, mean, SD, %CV, median and 
range) will be calculated for each sampling time. Plasma concentrations of the study drug 
over time will be plotted in semilogarithmic and linear formats as mean ± SD. Plasma 
concentration-time data for each subject will be analyzed using standard noncompartmental 
methods. Plasma PK parameters of VP-[ADDRESS_520567], AUC inf, AUC tau, and C max. The population mean slope will be estimated 
with a 90% CI. An alternate evaluation of dose proportionality will be conducted using 
ANOVA on dose-normalized AUC 0-last, AUC inf, and C max. The analysis will be conducted on 
log-transformed data. The model will include dose as a fixed effect and subject as random 
effect. Calculations of the 90% CI for the ratio of dose comparisons will be constructed.

13.3 Study Monitoring and Data Collection 
Clinical research associates (CRAs) representing the Sponsor will routinely visit the study 
site or develop a remote monitoring strategy throughout the study. The investigator will 
ensure that the monitor, or other compliance or quality assurance reviewer, is given access to 
all study-related documents and study related facilities (e.g., pharmacy, diagnostic 
laboratory, medical records), and, if the visit occurs on site, has adequate space to conduct 
the monitoring visit. In addition to the monitoring visits, frequent communications (email, 
letter, telephone, and/or fax) by [CONTACT_413053]. The investigator, or appropriate 
designee, will allocate adequate time for monitoring activities and F/U correspondences.  
The CRA will review ICFs, eCRFs, and laboratory and other diagnostic reports, comparing 
them with source documents to verify adherence to the protocol, and to ensure complete, 
accurate, consistent, and timely collection of data. The CRA will record and report any 
protocol deviations not previously sent to the Sponsor. The CRA will also confirm that AEs 
and SAEs have been properly documented on eCRFs and confirm that any SAEs have been 
forwarded to the Sponsor and those SAEs that met criteria for reporting have been forwarded 
to the IRB. The investigator will be asked to provide any missing information or to clarify 
any discrepancies found by [CONTACT_2689]. For on-site monitoring visits, it is expected that the 
investigator will be present for a concluding review at the end of each monitoring visit. 
Remote monitoring may be done if feasible, per the Monitoring Plan.

FACE-Q
The FACE-Q©is a PRO measure that can be used to measure outcomes of aesthetic facial 
procedures and products from the patient’s perspective. The FACE-Q©can be used to 
measure outcomes for any type of surgical or minimally invasive facial aesthetic treatment.
This PRO instrument has been used to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of facial aesthetic 
treatments in numerous clinical trial settings and to inform patient care in clinical practice.
The FACE-Q©is composed of a set of 39 independently functioning scales/checklists that 
measure 3 overarching domains: Facial Appearance, Health-Related Quality of Life, and 
Adverse Effects. These domains form the basis of the FACE-Q© conceptual framework (see 
link below). The FACE-Q© modular approach means that only the subset of scales most 
relevant to a specific research objective or clinical patient population need be administered.

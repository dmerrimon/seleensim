Title:  A Multicenter Study for the Long -term Follow -up of HLH 
Patients who Received Treatment with NI -0501, an Anti -
interferon Gamma Monoclonal Antibody  
Sponsor:  Sobi AG , Switzerland  
Study Type:  International , multicent er, long-term, follow -up study  of 
haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis  (HLH ) patients who have 
received NI -0501 (INN assigned name: [CONTACT_653427]) in the 
context of a previous NI -0501 clinical s tudy in which no long -term 
follow -up is planned. Patients having received NI -0501 under a 
compassionate use (CU) treatment protocol may also be 
considered for enrolment, whenever appropriate.  
NI-0501 -05 study is performed both in the US and in Europe 
accor ding to twin protocols called NI -0501 -05-P-IND #[ADDRESS_876803] -005753 -23, respectively  
Study Population:  HLH patients who  have received at least one dose of NI -0501  
during a previous NI -0501 clinical study or under a CU treatment 
protocol. 
In the event that  an appropriate donor has not been identified , at 
the end of NI -0501  induction treatment  in study NI -0501 -04, or in 
case of the need to delay Hematopoietic Stem Cell 
Transplantation ( HSCT ) for reasons unrelated to the 
administration of NI -0501, patients originally enrolled in study 
NI0501 -[ADDRESS_876804] of the treating physician after having 
establishe d a favourable benefit/risk from NI -[ADDRESS_876805] that  patients with different forms of HLH (pHLH or 
sHLH) can be enrolled in this study, the present protocol has to 
account for different patient characteristics, namely for:  
 Patients who have received NI -[ADDRESS_876806] 
received/will receive HSCT. Transplant may have been already 
performed, or may be performed under this protocol. Long -
term follow -up will be conducted up to [ADDRESS_876807] (see 
Table 1). 
 Patients who have received NI -[ADDRESS_876808] infusion 
of NI -0501 (see Table 2).

Protocol NI-0501-05- US-P-IND#111015 – VERSION 4.0 final – 31 October, 2019   CONFIDENTIAL Different flow charts and Schedules of Assessments (SoA) will be 
applied, depending on the above patient’s characteristics.  
Patients will enter study NI -[ADDRESS_876809] been already conducted 
before entry in study NI -0501 -05, the patient will proceed with the 
next planned visit.  
Main Inclusion Criteria:  1. Having received at least one dose of NI -0501  during a previous 
NI-0501 study  or under a CU treatment protocol . 
2. Having signed the Informed Consent by [CONTACT_338555]’s legal represent ative(s), as applicable , with the assent 
of patients who are legally capable of providing it . 
Study Objectives:  
  To monitor the long -term safety profile of NI -0501  
 To assess HLH patients’ survival  after NI-0501 treatment  
 To assess duration of response to  NI-0501 treatment (i.e. 
maintenance of HLH control)  
 To assess post -HSCT outcome measures, if applicable  
 To assess background disease activity, in patients with 
secondary forms of HLH  
 To study the elimination profile of NI -0501  
 To evaluate  the pharmacodyna mic (PD) effects (levels of 
circulating Total IFNγ, CXCL9, CXCL10)  
 To assess the profile of relevant HLH biomarkers, e.g., sCD25  
 To assess the immunogenicity of NI -0501  
Study Drug:  
 No investigational medicinal product (IMP) will be administered 
during the course of this long -term follow -up study . 
However, i n the event that , upon request of the treating physician, 
NI-0501 treatment needs to be prolonged beyond Week 8  in 
patients originally enrolled in study NI -0501 -04, patients will 
continue receiv ing NI-0501 in the context of thi s study . In this 
case NI -0501 will be managed as the IMP .   
Investigating Sites:  All s ites where patients have been recruited in NI-[ADDRESS_876810] been treated under a CU  treatment protocol 
may also be involved (whenever appropriate) .  
Study Duration and 
Study End Definition:   For patients who underwent or will undergo HSCT, the study 
will continue until data at [ADDRESS_876811] are collected  
 For patients not undergoing  HSCT, the study will continue

Protocol NI-0501-05- US-P-IND#111015 – VERSION 4.0 final – 31 October, 2019 CONFIDENTIAL 1. STUDY RATIONALE 
NI-0501 (assigned INN name: [CONTACT_653427]) is a fully human immunoglobulin G1 anti-interferon 
gamma (IFNγ) monoclonal antibody (mAb) which binds and neutralizes IFNγ.  
IFNγ is one of the most potent and pleiotropic cytokines of the immune system and it is considered 
critical for innate  and adaptive immunity  against viral and intracellular bacterial infections1. 
Haem
ophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a syndrome characterized by a severe impairment or 
absence of cytotoxic function by [CONTACT_398]8+ T cells, with a striking activation of the immune system, 
which presents typi[INVESTIGATOR_653395]2. Among the cytokines 
elev
ated in HLH patients are: IFNγ, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, IL-8, 
macrophage colony stimulating factor (MCSF) and granulocyte- macrophage colony-stimulating 
factor (GM-CSF). 
HLH comprises primary forms, genetically determined, and secondary forms, which are consequent to 
infections, inflammatory/autoimmune diseases or malignancies3. 
Based on data from relevant animal models of HLH4;5 and from the assessment of IFNγ levels in HLH 
patients6, neutralization of IFNγ represents a potential therapeutic objective in this patient population 
to 
achieve non-active disease (induction treatment) through a targeted therapy, which might prevent 
the use of chemotherapy. Of note is that hypercytokinemia and organ infiltration by [CONTACT_653407]8+ T cells hyperactivity and high IFNγ levels7-10.  
The
refore inhibiting IFNγ is believed to be a viable option for the development of a targeted therapy 
for HLH, required to be efficacious with no or limited toxicity11. IFNγ transient blockade is believed 
to be potentially less toxic and far less immunosuppressive than VP-16 or ATG, which are currently 
part of the induction regimen of HLH. 
Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) is a secondary form of HLH often observed in patients 
suffering from a rheumatic disease, such as systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (sJIA) and Systemic 
Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) . 
MAS, like HLH, is characterized by [CONTACT_653408]-inflammatory cytokines with overproduction of IFNγ and other cytokines .15, 16Beyond the 
demonstration of the safety, tolerability and efficacy of NI -0501 as induction  treatment for HLH  and 
as treatment for MAS , there is a need to establish the mid - and long-term safety of NI -0501 treatment  
and its  influence on survival of patients.  NI-0501 has be en administered to adult Healthy Volunteers 
(HV) as a single i.v. infusion  up to 3  mg/kg without any mid - or long -term adverse events reported 
during a maximum follow -up of 6 months (study NI -0501- 03). At the moment a pi[INVESTIGATOR_653396] 
(NI-0501 -04) is open for recruitment of patients with primary HLH in whom the disease has 
reactivated.   
Currently, 2 interventional studies are ongoing: a n open -label  Phase 2/3 study in patients with p HLH 
(protocol NI -0501 -04) and a pi[INVESTIGATOR_653397] (protocol NI -0501 -06).  
In
 addition, NI-0501 has been administered under a compassionate use treatment protocol to HLH 
patients that exhausted all available therapeutic options.

Protocol NI-0501-05- US-P-IND#111015 – VERSION 4.0 final – 31 October, 2019 CONFIDENTIAL Study NI-0501-05 allows a systematic collection of long-term data in patients previously exposed to 
NI-0501 during the course of the studies mentioned above (and potentially other studies not yet 
ongoing) or who have received NI-0501 in compassionate use.  
2. OBJECTIVES 
 To monitor the long-term safety profile of NI-0501  
 To assess HLH patients’ survival after NI-0501 treatment 
 To assess duration of response to NI-0501 treatment (i.e. maintenance of HLH control) 
 To assess post-HSCT outcome measures, if applicable 
 To assess background disease activity, in patients with secondary forms of HLH   
 To 
study the elimination profile of NI-0501 
 To evaluate the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects (levels of circulating total IFNγ, CXCL9, 
CXCL10) 
 To assess the profile of relevant HLH biomarkers, e.g., sCD25 
 To assess the immunogenicity of NI-[ADDRESS_876827] one dose of NI-0501  in the context of a previous NI -0501 clinical study in which no long -term 
follow -up is already planned. Patients having received NI -0501 under a compassionate use (CU) 
treatment protocol may also be considered for e nrolment, wh enever appropriate.  
The NI-0501-05 study is performed both in the US and in Europe according to twin protocols called 
NI-0501-05-P-IND #[ADDRESS_876828]-005753-23, respectively. 
In
 the event that an appropriate donor has not been identified by [CONTACT_10585] 8 or in case of the need to 
delay transplantation for reasons unrelated to the administration of NI-0501, patients from study NI-
0501-04- US-P-IND#[ADDRESS_876829] of the Investigator, providing a favorable benefit/risk has been established.  A close 
monitoring of these patients will be performed in the context of this study  (NI-0501 -05), according to 
the schedule of assessment reported in Appendix A, where the end of treatme nt period visit  of the NI-
0501- [ADDRESS_876830] visit for these  patient s entering NI -0501 -05 study  (refer to  NI-0501 -04-
US Study Protocol, Table 2 ). Due to the probability that, by [CONTACT_10585] 8, patients may be receiving NI -
[ADDRESS_876831] on a weekly basis. After NI-0501 discontinuation , patients will be 
monitored  weekly  for a period of 4 weeks  (4-week follow -up) before enter i ng the long-term follow -up 
study  described above.  
Study 
NI-0501-05 enrolls 2 different groups of patients: patients who underwent or will undergo 
HSCT, and patients for whom HSCT is not envisioned. The follow-up of these 2 different patients` 
groups is generally similar. The study design and visits` schedule for each patients`group is 
specifically described in Sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2, respectively.

treatment in a previous NI-0501 clinical study or in a CU treatment protocol.   
Pati
ents may enter the NI-0501-05 study at any time point after NI-0501 treatment or after completion 
of the short-term follow-up in the parent study, as applicable.  
Patients will undergo: 
 Baseline visit : it corresponds to the first study visit. The date of informed consent signature [CONTACT_653428]. If the last visit that the patient underwent in the parent study  required all the 
assessments to be collected at Baseline in NI -0501 -05 and occurred within 5 days from Baseline, 
data collected during  tha t visit will constitute the baseline for the present  study , and the visit will 
not need to be repeated or will be performed only to cover for any missing assessments. The 
Baseline visit will be combined with any other study visit depending on when the patient enters 
this study [for example, if the patient enters the study after having already performed HSCT, the 
Baseline visit will be combined with the relevant post -HSCT follow -up visit].  
 Weekly visits pre-HSCT : they have to be performed weekly until HSCT for [ADDRESS_876833] occurs beyond this time frame, the additional visits will be 
performed every 2 weeks until start of conditioning.    
 Pre-conditioning visit : it should occur up to [ADDRESS_876834] administration of conditioning drug(s). This visit 
can be combined with a ny other follow -up visit before HSCT visit , provided that they are  no more 
than 48 
hours apart .  
 P
re-HSCT visit: it should occur no more t han 2 days prior to transplant.  
 Post-HSCT visits:  weekly visits will take place during the first 4 weeks after transplant until 
Day+30, and subsequently at Day+60, Day+100, [ADDRESS_876835].  
For the allowed time windows, please see section 7.  
Additional visits (unscheduled) may be required depending on the patient’s clinical conditions.

continue to receive NI-0501 infusion. If a patient is not receiving anymore NI-0501 infusions in the 
context of NI-0501-05 study, he remains in the NI-0501-05 as it is an observational study collecting 
long term data, unless the patient or his/her legal guardian withdraw their consent.  
Patients still receiving NI-0501 treatment will be followed-up to monitor safety and efficacy of NI-
0501 treatment until treatment discontinuation and will be followed for 4 weeks as described in the 
NI-0501 treatment protocol they were part of (e.g. NI-0501-04- US-P-IND-111015 ) and as detailed in 
the specific Schedule of Assessment for patients continuing to receive NI-0501 beyond Week 8 (see 
Appendix A). Upon discontinuation of NI-0501 treatment, assessments described above will be 
performed as part of the long-term follow-up of these patients.  
8. SAFETY MONITORING 
8.1. DESCRIPTION OF STUDY PARAMETERS 
Evaluation of NI-0501 tolerability and safety will be based on the following parameters: 
 Adverse events (AEs), with special attention being paid to the occurrence of infections 
 Laboratory parameters: 
- CBC and hemoglobin 
- coagulation tests (aPTT, PT, d-Dimers and fibrinogen)  
- inflammatory markers such as CRP and ferritin,  
- biochemistry: glucose, triglycerides and liver enzymes (AST, ALT, ALP, γGT, LDH , 
total bilirubin), albumin, creatinine and urea 
 Vital signs : body temperature, heart and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], blood pressure 
 Physical examination and changes over time (see Section 7) 
 Immunogenicity: development of anti- NI-0501 antibodies

Protocol NI-0501-05- US-P-IND#111015 – VERSION 4.0 final – 31 October, 2019 CONFIDENTIAL 8.2.       RECORDING AND REPORTING SAFETY PARAMETERS 
The Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE Studies issued in December [ADDRESS_876853] (IMP). The IMP remains NI-0501 
during this study even if the patient is off drug. All AEs reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_653411]/her relatives or observed by [CONTACT_653412]-of-study visit will be reported on the AE data collection form. For all AEs, the 
following will be assessed and recorded: intensity, seriousness, relationship to test substance, action 
taken regarding test substance, any treatment received and outcome to date.  
Intensity of AEs will be graded on a three-points scale (mild, moderate, severe) using the modified 
WHO (World Health Organization) toxicity scale (Grade 3 and 4 are considered to be the severe 
grade). If AE severity is not mentioned in the scale, assessment will be made using the following 
definitions: 
 Mild: Discomfort noticed but no disruption of normal activity 
 Moderate: Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity 
 Severe: Inability to work or perform normal daily activity. 
For a given AE, the assessment of its intensity should reflect the highest grade (on the 3-points scal e 
mentioned above) reported during its course. The relationship of adverse events to NI-0501 will be 
asse
ssed by [CONTACT_12214] a “Yes/No” classification. A “Yes” relationship infers that there is a 
reas
onable suspected causal relationship to NI-0501. The expression “reasonable causal relationship” 
is m
eant to convey that there are facts, evidence or arguments to suggest a causal relationship. 
All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for Serious AEs will be 
captured in the appropriate e CRF  section. All AEs occurring while a patient is participating in the 
study must be documented appropriately, regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to 
adequate resolution.  
Any AE that is present at the time that the patient enters the NI-0501-05 study will continue to be 
monitored in the frame of previous NI-0501 study (for serious AE s, until resolution or until the 
outcome of the event is known and stable). Therefore it will not be recorded as an AE of the NI-0501-
05 study, unless in case of worsening. In this case a new AE will be recorded as a worsening of a 
previous condition.  
8.2.2.   Serious Adverse Events 
An 
adverse event or suspected  adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or spon sor, it : 
 results in death (note: death is an outcome, not an event); 
 is life-threatening; (note: the term "life-threatening" refers to an event in which the patient 
was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event whic h 
could hypothetically have caused a death had it been more severe); 
 requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43928]; 
 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; 
 is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;

Protocol NI-0501-05- US-P-IND#111015 – VERSION 4.0 final – [ADDRESS_876854] and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
The term severe is a measure of intensity/severity: thus a severe AE is not necessarily serious. For 
example, nausea of several hours’ duration may be rated as severe, but may not be clinically serious. 
For the purposes of this study, the following will not be considered as SAEs: 
 Elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_184016] a result of a patient’s pre-existing 
condition(s) which have not worsened since receiving IMP. Such events triggering the 
procedure or the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_653399]; 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_184017]-0501infusion and study visits. 
Any serious clinical AE must be communicated by [CONTACT_653413], by [CONTACT_653414], within [ADDRESS_876855] information for SAE reporting: 
Fax:  
E-mail:  
Relevant follow-up information on SAEs should be forwarded to Sobi AG as soon as it becomes 
available. In addition, the Investigator must be available to answer without delay any request for 
follow-up information or questions Sobi AG may have regarding the SAE. 
All SAEs will be recorded on the appropriate page of the e CRF . They will be reviewed, evaluated and 
followed through to resolution by a study physician. 
If either the Sponsor or Investigator believes that the event is serious, the event must be considered 
serious and evaluated by [CONTACT_80220] (21 CFR 312.32(a) and 312.32(c)(1)).  
8.2.3.   S[LOCATION_003]R reporting  
Unexpe
cted adverse reactions are all untoward and unintended responses to an investigational product 
related to any dose administered 
These reactions are S[LOCATION_003]Rs if the following three conditions are met: 
1) the event must be serious (see Section 8.2.2 above ); 
2) there must be a certain degree of probability that the event is a harmful and an undesirable reaction 
to the medicinal product under investigation, regardless of the administered dose; 
3) the event is not listed as an expected serious reaction in the Reference Safety Information (RSI) of 
the IB. Under 21 CFR 312.32(c), the Sponsor (directly or through a delegated third party) is required 
to notify FDA and all participating Investigators in an IND safety report (i.e. 7 - or 15 -day expedited 
report) of potentially serious risks from clinical trials or any other source as soon as possible, but no 
later than 7 calendar days for fatal or life -threatening events and 15 calendar days for all other events, 
after the Sponsor receives the sa fety information and determines that the information qualifies for 
reporting.  

Study NI-0501-05 NI-0501 Long-term Follow-up in HLH  Page 26  of 42 
Protocol NI-0501-05- US-P-IND#111015 – VERSION 4.0 final – [ADDRESS_876856] (IRB) all 
unanticipated problems involving risk to human subjects or others, including adverse events that 
should be considered unanticipated problems (21 CFR 312.66), such as IND safety reports. 
Sobi AG will also report all S[LOCATION_003]Rs to the EMA's EudraVigilance database within [ADDRESS_876857] Values  
All safety laboratory tests (hematology and blood biochemistry provided by [CONTACT_653415]-point, should be captured in the database in the laboratory page and should not be reported as 
AEs even if qualified as `clinically significant` at site, unless specific treatment is given for the 
abnormality or if qualifying as grade [ADDRESS_876858] or when patient has 
sign of HLH.  If a laboratory abnormality leads to a new clinical diagnosis (e.g., high white cell count 
is found to be due to incidental leukemia), the new clinical diagnosis should be reported as an AE 
rather than the laboratory abnormality. 
8.3. FOLLOW-UP OF SAFETY PARAMETERS 
8.3.1.   Treatment and Follow-up of Adverse Events 
Adverse events, especially those for which the relationship to the study drug has been assessed as 
‘Yes’, should be followed-up until the event has returned to baseline status or has stabilized. All SAEs 
must be followed-up until the event has either resolved or reached a stable clinical outcome. 
8.3.2.   Follow-up of Abnormal Laboratory Test Values 
In 
the event of unexplained clinically relevant abnormal laboratory test values, the tests should be 
repeated immediately and followed-up until the values have returned to within normal range and/or an 
adequate explanation of the abnormality is found.  
8.3.3.   Pregnancy 
I
n the event that a pregnancy occurs during the trial course, it must be reported to Sobi AG within 24 
hours of awareness. This includes pregnancies occurring in partners of male enrolled patients. All 
information pertaining to pregnancies should be reported using the Sobi AG Pregnancy form. 
Pregnancies should be followed until conclusion to obtain outcome information. 
No patient will be withdrawn from the study due to pregnancy. 
In the event of a pregnancy of a patient still receiving NI-0501, the IMP administration will be 
discontinued and the patient will enter the 4 week follow-up and then the long-term follow-up 
periods.

Protocol NI-0501-05- US-P-IND#111015 – VERSION 4.0 final – 31 October, 2019 CONFIDENTIAL 9. BENEFIT/RISK MANAGEMENT 
9.1. POTENTIAL BENEFITS 
As this study is intended to monitor the long-term safety following the administration of NI-0501, as 
well as the impact on survival, the main benefit for the patient is to be closely monitored, enabling the 
early detection of a potential issue.  
However, in case the patient would continue to receive NI-0501 in the context of this study after 
having successfully completed the NI-0501-04 protocol, the expected benefit is to maintain the 
therapeutic effects of NI-0501 treatment, enabling transplantation to be performed without using 
immune chemotherapy that has short and long term risks.  
9.2. RISKS ANALYSIS 
As NI-0501 is a monoclonal antibody and is characterized by a long half-life, the Investigator should 
be aware of the risks reported below.   
9.2.1 Risks related to the target 
IFNγ neutralization by [CONTACT_183957]-0501 clinically mimics that of complete IFNγ deficiency.     
Pati
ents with IFNγ R deficiency are prone to developi[INVESTIGATOR_653400], although to a 
lesser extent, Salmonella  infections12;13. 
The m
ean age of a first infection is 3.[ADDRESS_876859]. However this risk is 
considered to be of limited relevance to humans.  
To date, NI-0501 has been administered to Healthy Volunteers (14 subjects) in a single ascending 
dose study, which confirmed the absence of off-target toxicity. However, a reactivation of herpes 
zoster  (HZ) virus was observed in one healthy volunteer at a dose of 3 mg/kg, and it may have been 
due to the pharmacological effect of the drug. Although it is difficult to draw firm conclusions from 
this one case, prophylaxis against HZ for all patients, as long as the activity of NI-0501 is measurable, 
is to be maintained in the context of this study.  
In addition, as of 30 June 2017, NI-0501 has been administered to 34 patients (16 M, 18 F) in study 
NI-0501-04. I nfections reported by [CONTACT_653416] -0501 are 
commonly observed in immunocompromised patients  or described in pediatric population (seasonal 
viral infections). They did not prevent initiation of NI -[ADDRESS_876860] 
infusion, and did not result in the discontinuation or do se decrease of NI -050, except in  one patient 
who has experienced a disseminated histopla smosis which has resulted into  treatment discontinuation; 
inf
ection resolved with proper antifungal treat ment. Infections resolved when treated appropriately 
and not associated with a refractory disease status.  Sev ere infections were generally reported in 
patients with previous recent significant exposure to immunosuppressive treatments as they added an 
additional risk factor for infection development.

Protocol NI-0501-05- US-P-IND#111015 – VERSION 4.0 final – [ADDRESS_876861] Investigator’s Brochure.  
For patients originally enrolled in study NI-0501-04 who will continue receiving NI-0501 \ (Section 
3.1), the risk analysis described in the NI-0501-[ADDRESS_876862] already received the conventional treatment regimen for HLH. All information 
collected with regards to disease stage and previous treatments will be taken into account for the 
analysis of AEs. Duration of NI-0501 treatment will also be taken into account. Concomitant 
medications giv en during or after the administration of NI-0501 may also potentially expose patients 
to AEs; however their benefits may outweigh their risks.  
At present, the potential impact of NI-[ADDRESS_876863] been introduced to minimize the patient’s risk: 
 Patients are cared for in specialized centers for the treatment of HLH, which are used to 
managing severely immuno-compromised patients 
 Prophylaxis for herpes zoster  to avoid occurrence of these infections will be administered as 
long as deemed necessary, either because of residual NI-0501 activity or because of the 
patient ’s current treatment 
 Close monitoring of potential infections through careful physical examination and monitoring 
of laboratory parameters  
The NI-[ADDRESS_876864] party involved in the study. 
Risk minimization measures as described in corresponding protocol section of the NI-0501 study the 
patients were part of (e.g. section [IP_ADDRESS] of NI-0501-04- US-P-IND#111015 protocol) still apply in 
the event that patients continue receiving NI-[ADDRESS_876865] of the Investigator, providing a favourable benefit/risk has been established.

10.  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ANALYTICAL PLAN 
Full details of all statistical aspects and planned statistical analyses will be specified in a separate 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be finalized prior to the locking of the study database. 
This section contains an overview of the planned methods of analysis. 
Statistical methods will focus on summarizing the data collected, using appropriate graphical and 
tabular presentations. For measurements of continuous endpoints, summary statistics will include n, 
mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values. Duration  of Response a nd 
Survival time will be presented using Kaplan -Meier curves with medians calculated if available. 95% 
confidence intervals will be calculated for the med ian for each of these endpoints. Endpoints based on 
binary outcomes, including post -HSCT outcome measu res, will be converted to proportions and 
associated 95% confidence intervals calculated.  
Data collected in this study may be analyzed on multiple occasions as the study proceeds, in order to 
facilitate the development program for NI-[ADDRESS_876866]. 
All PD data will be summarized using appropriate graphical and tabular presentations. Exploratory 
statistical models may be fitted, and correlation analyses undertaken, to investigate the relationship s 
between PD data, other biomarkers and other endpoints recorded in the study. 
Other exploratory analyses of data collected in this study, including summaries for various subsets of 
patients, may also be conducted, including comparisons with appropriate historical data extracted 
from published literature, from external databases, and from other studies, if considered appropriate. 
No imputations of missing data will be performed.

Protocol NI-0501-05- US-P-IND#111015 – VERSION 4.0 final – [ADDRESS_876867], evaluation, and documentation 
of this study are designed to ensure that Sobi AG, its authorised representative, and investigator abide 
by [CONTACT_23663] (GCP), as described in International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) 
Guideline E6 and in accordance with the general ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of 
Helsinki. The study will receive approval from an Institutional Review Board (IRB)  prior to 
commencement and where applicable by [CONTACT_2371] a lso from National Competent Authorities. The 
Investigator will conduct all aspects of this study in accordance with applicable national, state, and 
local laws of the pertinent regulatory authorities.  
11.2. INVESTIGATOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES 
The
 Investigator should ensure that all persons assisting with the trial are appropriately qualified and 
adequately informed about the protocol, amendments, study treatments, as well as study-related duties 
and functions. The Investigator should maintain a list of sub-investigators and other appropriately 
qualified persons to whom he or she has delegated significant study-related duties. 
The Investigator is responsible for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a record of all patients (or their legally authorized 
representative) who have sign ed an informed consent document to enter the study. Patients not 
participating in the NI-0501-[ADDRESS_876868] the reason(s) recorded in their source documents and the study participant log. 
In
 the event that N-0501 treatment needs to be prolonged beyond Week 8, the treating physician has 
to comply with local requirements and regulations. The Investigator should maintain source 
documents and trial records that include all pertinent observations on each of the site’s trial subjects. 
Source data should be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, accurate, and complete. 
The Investigator/institution should maintain a record of the location(s) of the essential documents 
(which include source documents). The storage system (irrespective of the media used) should 
provide for document identification, search, and retrieval. 
The Investigator should promptly notify Sobi AG or designee of any inspections scheduled by [CONTACT_653417][INVESTIGATOR_653401]. 
The Investigator, or a designated member of the Investigators’ staff, must be available during 
monitoring visits, audits and inspections to review data, resolve queries and allow direct access to 
patient’ records (e.g. medical/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], office charts, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1332], and study-related charts) 
for source data and other types of verification. The Investigator must ensure timely and accurate 
completion of CRFs and queries. 
11.3. CONSENT 
Before being admitted to the clinical study, the patient must consent to participate after the nature, 
scope, and possible consequences of the clinical study have been explained in a form understandable 
to him or her. An informed consent document that includes both information about the study and the 
consent form will be prepared and given to the patient. This document will contain all ICH, GCP, and 
locally required regulatory elements (whichever are most stringent). The document must be in a 
Study NI-0501-05 NI-0501 Long-term Follow-up in HLH  Page 31  of 42 
Protocol NI-0501-05- US-P-IND#111015 – VERSION 4.0 final – [ADDRESS_876869] specify who informed the patient, and when the 
informed consent was obtained.  
Information to patients will be split into a Patient Information Sheet that provides detailed information 
about the trial and its benefits and risks, and the Informed Consent Form that summarizes the content 
of the Patient Information Sheet and is used to obtain the dated signature [CONTACT_653429]’s agreement to partake in the study. 
If applicable, since minors are involved in the trial, assent must be obtained from the minor and 
informed consent from at least one of the parents or as mandated by [CONTACT_184074] (individual or judicial 
or other body authorized under applicable law to consent on behalf of a prospective patient to the 
patient’s participation in the procedures involved in the research). The language used in the Assent 
Form is adapted to the maturity level of the minor involved in the trial. Since minors of different age 
groups are likely to be entered into the trial, different versions of the Assent Form will be provided . 
The modalities for obtaining informed consent from the parents and Assent from the minor will be 
defined at the site initiation visit and documented in the clinical trial center ’s Trial Master File (TMF). 
After reading and understanding the informed consent document, the patient (or the legally authorized 
representative) must give consent in writing. The written informed consent will be obtained prior to 
conducting any study-related procedures or tests. The patient’s consent (or the consent of the patient’s 
legally authorized representative) must be confirmed at the time of consent by [CONTACT_184075]. A copy of the signed consent 
document must be given to the patient or their legally authorized representative. The Investigator will 
retain the original signed consent document. The Investigator will not undertake any measures 
specifically required only for the clinical study until valid consent has been obtained. 
If an amended protocol impacts the content of the informed consent document, the consent document 
must be revised. Patients already participating in the study when the amended protocol is 
implemented must be re-consented with the revised version of the informed consent document unless 
specified by [CONTACT_427]. A copy of the revised informed consent document must be given to the 
patient or their legally authorized representative. The Investigator will retain the original signed 
updated consent document in their TMF. 
11.4. CONFIDENTIALITY AND DATA PRIVACY 
Sobi AG affirms the patient's right to protection against invasion of privacy and to be in compliance 
with ICH and other local regulations (whichever is more stringent). Sobi AG requires the Investigator 
to permit Sobi AG representatives and when necessary, representatives from regulatory authorities, to 
review and/or copy any medical records relevant to the study in accordance with local laws (any 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_190213]’ records must be duly anonymized to protect patients’ confidentiality). 
Should direct access to medical records require a waiver or authorization separate from the patient’s 
statement of informed consent, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain such permission in 
writing from the appropriate individual. 
11.5. PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS 
Substantial amendments will be submitted to the IRB for written approval and where applicable to 
National Competent Authorities. Written approval must be obtained before implementation of the 
amended version occurs. The written signed approval from the IRB should specifically reference the 
Principal Investigator ’s name, protocol number, study title and amendment number(s) that is/are 
applicable.

per the treating physician’s request, to continue receiving NI-[ADDRESS_876871] be 
officially signed by a committee member (chairman or secretary of the IRB). Before the first patient is 
enrolled in the study, all ethical and legal requirements must be met. 
The IRB and, if applicable, the authorities, must be informed of all subsequent protocol amendments 
in accordance with local legal requirements. Amendments must be evaluated to determine whether 
formal approval must be sought and whether the informed consent document should also be revised. 
The Investigator must keep a record of all communication with the IRB and, if applicable, between a 
coordinating Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_72616]. This statement also applies to any communication between the 
Investigator (or coordinating Investigator, if applicable) and regulatory authorities. 
Before any documents are given to patients or their legal representative, they must first be reviewed 
and approved by [CONTACT_653418], and upon approval by [CONTACT_653418], submitted to and reviewed and approved 
by t
he competent IRB. Th ese include but are not limited to the informed consent form, patient 
information sheet, assent form, advertisements, training materials, etc.

12.  MONITORING AND AUDITING 
All aspects of the study will be monitored b y Sobi AG or its representative for this study (Sobi AG 
authorized representative), for compliance with applicable government regulations with respect to 
current GCP and standard operating procedures. Direct access to the on-site study documentation and 
medical records must be ensured by [CONTACT_737]. 
12.1. STUDY MONITORING AND SOURCE DATA VERIFICATION 
As 
part of the responsibilities commensurate with participating in the study, th e Investigator agrees to 
maintain and have available for monitoring, adequate case records (accurate source documents and 
C
RFs) for the patients treated under this protocol. In addition, the Investigator agrees to maintain all 
study related documents (e.g. IRB correspondence, investigational product and supplies shipment 
manifests if applicable, monitoring logs, or correspondence with Sobi AG and with any of its 
representatives for this study, etc ). 
12.2. ON-SITE AUDITS

13.2      
USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS AT THE CLINICAL TRIAL CENTER 
When clinical observations are entered directly into an investigational site’s computerized medical 
record system (i.e. in lieu of original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve as the source 
document if the system has been validated in accordance with health authority requirements 
pertaining to computerized systems used in clinical research. An acceptable computerized data 
collection system allows preservation of the original entry of data. If original data are modified, the 
system should maintain a viewable audit trail that shows the original data as well as the reason for the 
change, name [CONTACT_25773], and date of the change. 
The system must allow the clinical research associate, auditors or inspectors to verify source data 
without infringing privacy rights of other patients, e.g. access must be restricted to records pertaining 
to the study patients and access to other patients must not be possible.

3 = C ontinuous cardiac  monitoring/pulse oxymetry: pre infusion, during infusion, and post infusion up to 4 hours after infusion  
4 = Physical Examination:  Par ticular attention paid to height (at last infusion visit and at week 4 or withdrawal visit), weight (at each infusion visit and at 
week 4 or withdrawal visit as well as at unscheduled visits), occurrence of edema or ascites, occurrence of signs of infections (e.g. tonsillitis, 
lymphadenopathies, cough and/or dyspnea), neurological examination, liver and spleen size (in cm fr om costal grill) .  
5 = TB: search for tuberculosis mycobacteria by [CONTACT_653423] (e.g. blood, urine, broncho -alveolar lavage, gastric aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]) or any 
method agreed to be used in the parent protocol or CU treatment protocol at a given  site 
6 = Adenoviruses, EBV, CMV:  search by [CONTACT_956] 
7
 = PK and PD:  sa mpling time s may be adjusted if required  
8 = PD  will look at IFNγ circulating levels and potential markers of disease activity (e.g. sCD25, CXCL10, CXCL9, CXCL11, IL-10…). 
9 
= Vital signs and physical examination wi ll be performed  at minimum , but additional assessments may be added according to the clinical judgment of the 
Investigator. 
10 = ECG:  to be done on the last NI-[ADDRESS_876880] 4 weeks.  
11 = ECG : to be performed at the Week 4 follow-up visit. In case of withdrawal prior to this Week 4 follow-up visit, an ECG is to be done at the withdrawal 
v
isit as long as an ECG has NOT been performed within the previous 4 weeks. 
12 = Efficacy/safety visits should occur every 6 days but can be combined with infusion visits, if infusion are separated by [CONTACT_23818] 7 days  
13 = Assessments can be performed within 24h before or after the planned time -p oint during  the follow -up Pe riod. If the conditioning starts during the short 
term follow -up period and is  not separated by  [CONTACT_726] 48h  from a weekly follow -up visit, then the  follow -up visit and the pre conditioning visit  may be 
combined and all assessments scheduled for each indi vidual visit  should be performed . The same process applies if the Transplant occurs during the short 
term follow -up period.  Then the  patient  will start to be monitored for the long term follow -up period according to the remaining visits to be performed in the 
SOA  presented in table 1 . 
14 = If a patient withdraws or is withdrawn at any time from the study, he/she will be asked to attend one last visit (i.e. equivalent to Week 4 visit) so that all 
f
inal assessments can be performed.

Description of the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) 
NI-[ADDRESS_876882] party manufacturi ng facility duly qualified by [CONTACT_653424] 2 mL-filled and 10  mL-filled single -use glass vials, at a concentration of 5  mg/mL for dilution 
prior to administration.  
The nominal composition of the NI-0501 sterile concentrate for infusion (per mL) is as follows: 
Ingredient  Quantity (per mL)  
NI-0501  5 mg  
L-Histidine  1.55 mg  
L-Histidine monohydrochloride, monohydrate  3.14 mg  
Sodium chloride (NaCl)  7.31 mg  
Polysorbate 80  0.05 mg  
pH 6.0 ± 0.[ADDRESS_876883] be used only once. 
Dosing Regimen 
NI-0501 will be administered by [CONTACT_67489] a period of one hour (or more depending on the volume to infuse) 
at a dose either carried forward from the last administered NI- 0501  dose as part of the NI- 0501  treatment study  
the patient was enrolled in, or at an adjusted dose if necessary and depending on NI-0501 PK profile. 
NI-0501 infusions will be performed at a dose and frequency which will be determined by [CONTACT_653425]’s clinical response. 
IMP Handling 
Packaging and Labeling 
NI-0501 will be supplied to study sites in glass vials. Labeling and packaging will be prepared to meet local 
regulatory requirements. 
IMP Supply 
NI-0501 will be supplied to the study site as open-label supplies. 
IMP Receipt and Storage 
The NI-0501 vials will be transported with temperature deviation alarms (TempTale 4 or equivalent device) in 
order to ensure consistent temperatures during transit.  When the study drug is received at the site, the 
Investigator, Pharmacist or appropriate delegate will check for accurate delivery and absence of temperature 
deviation alarm. 
The study drug is to be stored between 2° - 8°C (36° - 46°F). All vials must be stored in a secure locked location 
in a temperature controlled refrigerator or cold room. Any deviations from the recommended storage conditions 
should be immediately reported to the Sponsor, responsible study monitor or contract research organisation 
(CRO). Affected vials should not be used and quarantined until the Sponsor has authorized their use. 
Regular inspections of the NI-0501 vials are required (please refer to the study specific drug/pharmacy manual 
for more details).

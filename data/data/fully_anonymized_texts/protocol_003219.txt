1.1. Summary  
Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis and the major cause of activity 
limitation and physical disability in older people.  Today, 35 million people (13% of the US 
population) are [ADDRESS_1078678] 1 joint.  By 2030, 20% of Americans (about 70 million people) will have passed their 65th 
birthday and will be at risk for OA (Nevitt et al. 2006) . 
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168888].  Most current treatments are designed only to relieve 
pain and reduce or prevent the disability caused by [CONTACT_168938]. Drug 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_168889]; no treatment inhibits or reverses 
the degenerative structural changes that are responsible for its progression  (Nevitt e t al. 2006) . 
Samumed, LLC (Samumed) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_168890]04690 for the treatment of OA. SM04690 is a 
small molecule inhibitor of the Wnt pathway.   
1.2. Nonclinical Assessments  
SM04690 has been tested in a number of appropriate nonclinical studies. The results of those 
studies are included in the Investigator Brochure ( IB). 
1.3. Study Rationale  
Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis and chronic joint disorder in man  (Dougados 
and Hochberg 2011) . The exact cause of OA is unknown, but it is associated with aging and 
normal wear on a joint. Osteoarthritis is characterized by [CONTACT_168939], subchondral bone alterations, and synovitis. Patients present with pain and stiffness in the joints, 
with the joints becoming more stiff and immobile over time  (Dougados and Hochberg 2011) . 
Osteoarthritis is a leading cause of physical disability in the US  (Lawrence et al. 2008) .  
The Wnt pathway plays a central role in the initiation and progression of OA pathology and is crucial in normal joint metabolism (Hochberg et al. 2012) . Wnt is a major regulator of joint 
development and is involved in the formation of bone, cartilage, and synovium. The transcription 
of Wnt target genes caus es an increase in catabolic processes during the development of OA, and 
increased Wnt signaling may contribute to cartilage loss  (Gelse et al. 2012) . Polymorphisms in 
genes involved in Wnt signaling are associated with an increased susceptibility to OA 
development (Wu et al. 2012) . Established research suggests that modulation of Wnt signaling is 
an attractive target for treatment of  OA.  
In order to address the need for effective pharmaceutical agents to treat OA, Samumed has used structure -based drug design to synthesize a small molecule inhibitor of the Wnt pathway, 
SM04690, as a potential OA therapeutic to be administered in the form of a local injection in the affected joint.  
SM04690 is currently being tested  in a single Phase 1 clinical trial in subjects with moderately to 
severely symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee. The trial was a placebo -controlled, double-blind, 
dose-e scalation s tudy conducted in the US of three concentrations of SM04690 (0.03, 0.07, and 
Protocol SM04690- OA-02 Amendment 04 Version 00 
Samumed, LLC  October 13, 2016 
Confidential Page 17 of 63 0.23 mg per 2 mL injection ). In each dose cohort, s ubjects were randomized to active or vehicle 
at a ratio of 16 active: [ADDRESS_1078679] been enrolled in 3 ascending dose cohorts of approximately 20 subjects per cohort. Per protocol, data from cohort 1 and 2 were unblinded following the safety review of all subjects enrolled in the cohort (observed for a minimum of 12 weeks). Cohort [ADDRESS_1078680] been two dose- limiting 
toxicities (DLT s) and 1 serious adverse event (SAE) reported on the trial. A DLT of increased 
knee pain was reported and met the DLT criteria of increased pain at the target joint of greater 
than 30 mm increase on the pain visual analog scale (VAS) ; this DLT was due to a procedural

3. DESCRIPTION OF STUDY DESIGN
This study will be a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo -controlled, parallel group 
study of three different strengths of SM04690 injected into the target knee joint of moderately to 
severely symptomatic osteoarthritis subjects.  
Approximately 445 subjects will be  enrolled and randomized at a ratio of 1 :1:1:1  (0.03 mg active 
per 2 mL injection: 0.07 mg active  per 2 mL injection: 0.23 mg active per 2 mL injection : 
placebo ). Subjects will participate in a screening  period of up to 21 days and a 52 week follow -
up period. Clinic visits will be  scheduled at Screening, Treatment Visit Day 1 and Follow -up 
Weeks 4, 13, 26, 39 and 52 [End of study (EOS) or E arly Termination (ET)].  
The study schedule is as follows: 
•Day -21 to  -1: Screening Visit
•Day 1: Treatment visit
•Week 4: Follow -up visit
•Week 13: Follow -up visit
•Week 26: Follow-up visit
Protocol SM04690- OA-02 Amendment 04 Version 00 
Samumed, LLC  October 13, 2016 
Confidential Page 19 of 63 •Week 39: Follow-up visit
•Week 52: End of Study (EOS) or Early Termination (ET) : Follow -up visit
Specific timing of protocol procedures are described in Appendix 1. 
Thi
s study wi ll be conducted at up to 40 investigational centers in the US. Potential subjects will 
attend a Screening Visit and participate in a screening period of no longer than 21 days.    
In this study, general medical evaluations and recording of vital signs will be performed at all 
visits . A pain VAS will be administered at the Screening Visit. X- ray imaging  of the target knee 
joint will be performed at screening and at Week s 26 and 52 (EOS)/Early Termination . A 
Widespread Pain Index and Symptom Severity Score assessment  will be conducted at the 
Screening Visit  only. Physical examinations will be performed at the Screening Visit (including 
knee examination) , Day 1, Week 13, Week 26, Week 39 and Week 52 (EOS)/Early Termination . 
Clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed at the Screening Visit , Week 13, Week 26, 
Week 39  and Week  52 (EOS)/Early Termination . The subject will complete the WOMAC 
questionnaire, Patient Global Assessment , and SF-36 at all visits; the investigator or designated 
study staff will complete the Physician Global Assessment at all visits . Recording of signs and 
symptoms of study medication intolerability and adverse event reporting will start following the injection of the study medication and continue until the subject completes follow-up visit Week 
52 (EOS)/Early Termination . All AEs, whether volunteered, elicited, or noted during 
examination, will be recorded throughout the study. 
An interim analysis will be performed after all subjects have completed their W eek 26 visit; 
however clini cal study sites and subjects will remain blinded throughout the study. 
3.1. Study Endpoints  
3.1.1. Primary Endpoints  
The efficacy of treatment with SM04690 Injectable Suspension will be assessed by [CONTACT_784262] 13 . 
3.1.2. Secondary Endpoints  
Efficacy will be assessed by [CONTACT_784263] (Week 26) and 
function (Weeks 13 and 26) subscores and  Patient Global Assessment  at Weeks [ADDRESS_1078682] -OARSI responders and “strict” responders at Weeks 
13, 26, and 52 ( Pham et al. 2003) and change in lateral JSW as evaluated by X -ray at Week [ADDRESS_1078683] identify unblinded personnel who will be responsible for preparing 
the appropriate dilution of the study medication and who are able to perform the injection  of 
study medication and/or placebo. Study personnel administering or preparing study medication 
and reference therapy must minimize any contact [CONTACT_168985]. On study visit Day 1, subjects will be randomized via the Medidata database.   
3.2.2. Randomization/Assignment to Investigational Product or Placebo 
Subjects will be assigned a subject  number at their Screening Visit.  Eligible subjects will be 
randomized at their study visit Day [ADDRESS_1078684] fulfill the  following requirements: 
•Meet all study inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria
•Have acceptable Screening clinical laboratory test results
•Have signed the Informed Consent form
•Comply with the study instructions
3.2.3. Subject Re -screening  
Subjects are allowed to be re- screened once. Re- screens are limited to subjects who did not meet 
inclusion/exclusion criteria due to a transient reason. Transient refers to self -limiting and 
predictably resolving conditions or acute events (e.g., seasonal allergies, common cold, or otitis media), reversible medical conditions that are successfully treated (e.g., anemia successfully treated by [CONTACT_104482]), and/or being unable to comply with study procedures due to administrative 
convenience (e.g., family issues or atte nding to a private matter).  
Subjects who failed any entry criteria in which no further treatment or spontaneous resolution is 
expected are not allowed to be re-screened.  
Any re -screened subject must be re- consented  and will be issued a new subject number. All 
screening procedures and assessments must be performed at re-screen; no results or data may be 
used from the previous screen.  
3.2.4. Unblinding During the Study  
The blind may be broken by a qualified physician who is an Investigator in this study in the 
Protocol SM04690- OA-[ADDRESS_1078685]’s immediate course of treatment. Before breaking the 
blind, the Investigator should determine that the information is necessary (i.e., that it will alter 
the subject’s immediate course of treatment).  
If deemed necessary to break the blind for a study subject, the Samumed Medical Monitor is to 
be contact[CONTACT_784264].  If it is not possible to contact [CONTACT_519769], he or she should be contact[CONTACT_784265] a subject.  Details regarding the emergency unblinding will be documented in Medidata Balance 
and medical records.  Instructions on how to unblind treatment assignment will be provided to 
each Investigator and kept within a guidance document at each site. No other site users will have 
access roles to Balance that will allow treatment assignment unblinding.  
Any subject whose blind has been broken will continue their follow -up visits as per protocol. 
An interim analysis will be performed after all subjects have completed their W eek 26 visit; 
however clinical study sites and subjects will remain blinded throughout the study. Only t he 
study sponsor will be unblinded at this time. 
3.3. Investigational Product 
3.3.1. Rationale for Dosages and Dosing Regimen 
A phase 1 clinical trial was conducted to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), 
and pharmacodynamics (PD) of a SM04690 formulation at 3 different dose- level concentrations 
(0.03, 0.07, and 0.23 mg per 2 mL injection) injected into the intra -articular space of the OA -
affected target knee.  The initial dose level of SM04690 (0.03 mg) was based on the mammalian 
species m ost sensitive to SM04690 in 8- week toxicology studies (the approximate residence time 
of the drug) in accordance with US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines. Preclinical 
studies to date have not demonstrated toxicity or systemic exposure at the b iologically 
efficacious dose, so doses were selected that bracketed the projected biologically efficacious dose based on preclinical studies, hence resulting in the escalation sequence of 0.03, 0.07, and 0.[ADDRESS_1078686] been enrolled in 3 ascending dose cohorts of approximately 
20 subjects per cohort. Per protocol, data from cohort 1 and 2 were unblinded following the safety review of all subjects enrolled in the cohort (observed for a minimum of 12 weeks). 
Cohort 3 data remains blinded. 
A total of 28/[ADDRESS_1078687] reported 68 treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) with 35 
preferred terms. The system organ class (SOC) most reported was ‘Musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders’ with 11/[ADDRESS_1078688] been two dose- limiting 
toxicities (DLTs) and 1 serious adverse event (SAE) reported on the trial. A DLT of increased knee pain was reported and met the DLT criteria of increased pain at the target joint of greater 
than 30 mm increase on the pain VAS ; this DLT was due to a procedural error and considered 
unrelated to study drug. A DLT of tachycardia paroxysmal was also reported and met t he DLT 
criteria of an AE deemed by [CONTACT_2418] a severe or serious AE. This DLT also met 
Protocol SM04690- OA-[ADDRESS_1078689] that, at the strengths under evaluation (0.03 mg per 2 mL injection , 0.07 
mg per 2 mL injection , and 0.23 mg per 2 mL injection), this Phase 2 clinical trial with SM04690 
has the therapeutic potent ial to safely treat individuals with moderately to severely symptomatic 
osteoarthritis of the knee. 
3.3.2. Dosages and Dosing Regimen 
SM04690 will be administered in the following dosage strengths: 
•SM04690 0.03 mg in 2  mL Injectable Suspension
•SM04690 0.07 mg in  2 mL Injectable Suspension
•SM04690 0.23 mg in 2  mL Injectable Suspension
•SM04690 0 mg; placebo  (PBS) injection only
Each subject will be randomly assigned to a dose at Study Visit Day [ADDRESS_1078690] or the placebo  (PBS) is to be administered as a [ADDRESS_1078691] in this study.  
Only topi[INVESTIGATOR_15413] (absolutely no invasive anesthetic) is allowed for the study injections. 
Anesthetic is also  not allowed to be combined with the study medication for injection. 
3.3.3. Dose Modifications 
No modification in the specified dose concentration or the volume (2 mL) of the study 
medication injected into the target knee joint will be allowed.  
3.3.4. Prior and Concomit ant Medications and Procedures  
Prior medications are defined as medications that were taken within 30 days prior to study injection on Day 1. Concomitant medications are defined as medications taken any time after study injection on Day 1 until follow-up visit Week 52 (EOS)/Early Termination . All prior and 
new or modified concomitant therapy used during the study must be recorded on the “Prior and Concomitant Medications” page of the eCRF . 
Procedures that are o ngoing, new , or modified at or post- Day [ADDRESS_1078692] be recorded on the 
“Procedures and Non- Drug Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]” page of the eCRF.  
Any new or modified concomitant therapy must be considered to determine if it is related to an adverse event (AE) .  
Subjects will be encouraged to remain on a stable dose of any allowed medications throughout the study. The use of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (325 mg /day) for thrombosis prophylaxis is permitted.

The study may be discontinued at the discretion of the Investigator or the Sponsor. 
5. CLINICAL  ASSESSMENTS
5.1. Collection of Adverse Events Data
Data regarding treatment -emergent adverse event s (TEAEs)  will be collected in this study.  
TEAEs are events that occur during the course of the study that are not present prior to Day [ADDRESS_1078699] 
worsened in severity during the course of the study. Adverse events will  be assessed at each 
study visit from the time of study medication injection on study visit Day 1  through Week 52 
(EOS)/E arly T ermination .  
Each subject will be observed and queried by [CONTACT_488933] ’s designee at 
each study visit for any continuing AEs or new AEs since the previous visit. The subject will be 
asked to return to the site for an unscheduled visit if an AE occurs between study visits, and if, in 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689] , the AE requires a study visit for full evalu ation. Any AE reported 
by [CONTACT_784267] ’s designee will be recorded within 
the eCRF . The following information will be recorded for each adverse event: description of the 
event, date of onset and resolution, severity as assessed by [CONTACT_784268] 
“Guidance for Industry: Toxicity Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in 
Preventive Vaccine Trials” ( Appendix 2), causal relationship to study medication, outcome, and 
any treatment given.  
Adverse events that are not serious and are ongoing at the subject’s las t visit will be followed for 
a maximum of 30 days. Serious adverse events that are not resolved or stabilized during this time 
period will be followed until resolution or stabilization.  
5.2. Clinical Laboratory Sampling  
Non-fasting samples for clinical laborato ry analysis will be collected by a qualified staff member 
Protocol SM04690- OA-02 Amendment 04 Version 00 
Samumed, LLC  October 13, 2016 
Confidential Page 28 of 63 at the Screening Visit  and follow-up visit Week s 13, 26, 39, and 52 (EOS)/Early Termination . At 
a minimum, the following tests will be conducted:  
•Chemistry panel:  Albumin, alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ), alanine aminotransferase
(ALT ), aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ), blood urea nitrogen , bicarbonate, calcium
(corrected total), chloride, creatinine, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH),
potassium, sodium, bilirubin (total)
•Hematology:  Hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell (RBC) count, white blood cell
(WBC) count with differential, and platelet count
•Urinalysis:  Clarity, specific gravity, pH, protein, glucose, ketones, nitrite, leukocytes,
and occult  blood
A urine- based pregnancy test will be performed  on female subjects at the Screening Visit and at 
study visit Day 1, prior to study medication injection. 
An HbA1c test will be performed on all subjects at the Screening Visit.  
Urine microscopy will be performed if urinalysis values are out of range and t he Investigator 
deems that the microscopy is clinically warranted.  
The Investigator or the Investigator ’s designee must review the results of each subject’s 
Screening Visit clinical laboratory test results prior to the Day [ADDRESS_1078700] not be 
randomized on Day 1  if any of the Screening Visit results are outside the normal range for the 
laboratory AND, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689] , are clinically significant.  
The results of the clinical laboratory tests will be reported on the laboratory’s standard reports. 
The Investigator must review all laboratory reports in a timely manner, noting “not clinically 
significant” (NCS) or comment on the clinical significance (clinically significant: yes/no) of any 
result that is outside the norm al range for the laboratory or has a toxicity grade of [ADDRESS_1078701] is to be excluded. If 
it is found after study medication injection, it sh ould be reported as an AE (see Section  9). 
5.3. Medical History  
A medical history will be obtained at screening  with a follow-up at end of study or Early 
Termination . Medical history will include demographic data (e.g., age, race/ethnicity). In 
addition, medical information will also be recorded, including all (1) medical conditions and disease states that require current or ongoing therapy and (2) other medical conditions and 
disease states that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689] , are relevant to the subject’s study 
participation.  Review of medical history at the Week 52 (EOS)/Early Termination visit will only 
be to capture End Dates of any ongoing medical history collected at screening.  
5.4. Physical Examination 
A general physical examination will be conducted at the Screening  Visit, Day 1 , and Week s 13, 
26, 39, and 52 (EOS)/Early Termination . Results of the physical examination will be  noted in the 
Protocol SM04690- OA-02  Amendment 04 Version 00 
Samumed, LLC   October 13, 2016 
 
Confidential  Page 29 of 63 source documents. Any clinically significant finding noted prior to study medication injection 
should be recorded as medical history . If it is found after study medication injection, it should be 
reported as an AE (see Section  9). 
5.4.1. Knee Examination 
A knee examination will be conducted at the Screening Visit. Results of the knee examination will be noted in the source documents. Presence of bilatera l knee OA (yes/no) will be recorded in 
the eCRF.  If the subject has osteoarthritis in both knees, the site is to establish the target knee as 
the knee with greater pain at screening based on the subject’s evaluation and the Investigator’s clinical judgment. 
Misalignment of the target knee will be assessed by [CONTACT_784269]. Presence of significant misalignment of the target knee (yes/no) will be 
recorded in the eCRF. In the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], subjects with s ignificant and clinically 
evident misalignment of the target knee that would impact subject function must be excluded 
from the study. 
5.4.2. Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be measured by a qualified staff member  at all visits.  
At each time point, the following vital signs will be measured: 
• Body temperature  
• Pulse rate  
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487]  
• Blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) after the subject sits for at least [ADDRESS_1078702] be recorded as medical history if found prior to study medication injection or as an AE if 
found after study medication injection (see Section  9). 
5.4.3. Height and Weight 
Height measurements will be taken at the Screening Visit only.  Weight measurements will be 
taken at the Screening Visit  and follow-up visit Week 52 (EOS)/E arly T ermination . 
5.5. Pregnancy Tests  
A urine- based pregnancy test will be performed  on female subjects at the Screening Visit and  at 
study visit Day 1, prior to study medication injection.  
5.6. X-Ray of Knee Joint s 
X-ray of  the knee joints will be taken during the screening period  and follow-up visit Weeks 26 
and 52 (EOS)/Early T ermination . The screening X -ray is to be taken within [ADDRESS_1078703] enrollment.  The intent (and included in the 
Image Review Charter – Image Acquisition guidelines) is that X -rays should be obtained in the 
posterior-anterior (PA) view, whenever possible. The Image Acquisition Protocol allows for 
anteroposterior (AP) view when PA view X-ray cannot be acquired.  
All radiographs will be submitted to an independent radiologist who  will document disease stage 
according to the Kellgren -Lawrence grading scale for compliance with enrollment criteria, as 
well as joint space width for efficacy assessment s. 
5.7. Widespread Pain Index and Symptom Severity Score

7. PREMATURE DISCONTINUATION FROM STUDY
As the study treatment requires only a single injection, best efforts will be made to encourage 
subjects to attend all follow -up visits. A premature discontinuation from study will occu r when a 
subject who signed informed consent ceases participation in this study, regardless of 
circumstances, prior to completion of the defined study period. Subjects can be prematurely 
discontinued from the study for one of the following reasons:  
•Death
•Lost to follow-up after a minimum of [ADDRESS_1078711], including sending a registered letter
•Subject withdraws consent
The reason for the discontinuation should be recorded on the eCRF . The Investigator  or designee 
must complete all applicable  eCRF  pages for subjects who discontinue from the study 
prematurely.  Week 52 (EOS)/Early Termination  procedures should be conducted within [ADDRESS_1078712]/Ethics Committee (IRB/EC) 
reserve the right to prematurely terminate the study in the interest of subject safety and welfare.  
The Sponsor reserves the right to prematurely terminate the study at any time for administrative 
reasons.  
8. PRODUCT SPECIFICATIO NS
8.1. Description
SM04690 drug substance is an off-white powder. SM04690 drug product is a sterile suspension in diluent containing 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose sodium and 0.05% polysorbate [ADDRESS_1078713] and adding to a 
vehicle (diluent) vial, mixing well to re -suspend the product, then injecting [ADDRESS_1078714] also be logged. The log includes the following: 
• Subject number and initials 
• Date that study medication was prepared/injected  
• Quantity dispensed (active vial, vehicle vial, PBS vial, and saline vial)  
• Quantity returned (active vial, vehicle vial, PBS vial, and saline vial)  
All study medication received , prepared,  and dispensed by [CONTACT_784272]/ or 
unblinded designee will be inventoried and accounted for throughout the study. The study 
medication must be stored at the appropriate temperature (15°-30°C or 59°-86°F) and  in a 
restricted area with limited access . Temperature excursions are allowed between 2° -60°C (36°-
140°F) for a time period not to exceed 72 hours and only during study medication shipment. The  
unblinded Investigator and/ or unblinded designee must maintain an accurate, up -to-date 
dispensing log for all study medications supplied by [CONTACT_1034]. Study medication dispensed for 
all subjects must be recorded on the drug accountability forms. The study medication dispensing 
log and remaining drug inventory will be reviewed by [CONTACT_1034]- designated  unblinded clinical 
monitor. 
The study medication supplied for this study is for use only in subjects properly consented and 
enrolled into this protocol. Used and unused study medications must be kept in a secure, blinded 
location physically separated from standard clinic or office drug supplies and with  access  limited 
to the unblinded Investigator and/or unblinded designee. 
9. SAFETY MONITORING AND ADVERSE EVENTS  
9.1. Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events  (TEAEs) 
Data regarding TEAEs will be collected in this study.  TEAEs are events that are not present prior 
to study medication injection or, if present prior to study medication injection,  have worsened in 
severity.  
The reporting period for AEs starts after the injection of study medication on Day 1  and ends 
after the final study visit.  
Definition of Adverse Events:  
Adverse events in the e CRF will be classified according to the most recent US FDA definitions 
and in a manner consistent with ICH guidelines. As such the following definitions will be used: 
An adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of an investigational (medicinal) product (IP) or other protocol-imposed 
intervention, regardless of attribution. An AE may include intercurrent illnesses or injuries that 
represent an exacerbation (increase in frequency, severity, or specificity) of preexisting conditions (e.g., worsening of asthma).  
Protocol SM04690- OA-[ADDRESS_1078715] a diagnosis as the AE term rather than a series of 
symptoms relating to a diagnosis.  In order to classify AEs and diseases, pr eferred terms will be 
assigned by [CONTACT_784273] e CRF, using the Medical Dictionary 
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).   
The Investigator will assess AEs for severity utilizing the “Guidance for Industry: Toxicity Scale 
for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Trials”. This 
toxicity scale is presented in Appendix 2. Laboratory value s not listed on the toxicity scale will 
be assessed for severity by [CONTACT_168975]. 
All adverse events that occur during this trial will be considered related to the study treatment.  
For future planning and informational purposes, the investigator opi[INVESTIGATOR_784235]. All adverse events that 
occur within the trial will continue to be reported to all regulatory authorities as well as summarized in the final clinical study  report as related to study medication. The Investigator will 
determine the relationship of an AE to study treatment  and will record it on the source 
documents and eCRF using the categories defined below.  
The relationship of the study treatment to an AE will be determined by [CONTACT_363998]: 
1.  Not Related 
The AE is not related if (1) exposure to the investigational product (or placebo) or administration of the study injection has not occurred or (2) the occurrence of the AE is not reasonably related 
in time or  (3) the AE is considered related to another event or product not associated with the 
investigational product (or placebo) or the study injection. 
2.  Unlikely Related 
The AE is unlikely related if (1) the AE is unlikely related in time or  (2) the AE is considered 
unlikely to be related to use of the investigational product (or placebo) or study injection (i.e., 
there are no facts [evidence] or arguments to suggest a cau sal relationship).  
3.  Possibly Related 
The AE is possibly related if (1) the investigational product (or placebo) or the study injection and AE are considered reasonably related in time and  (2) the AE could be explained by [CONTACT_784274] (or placebo) or administration of the study 
injection.  
4.  Probably Related 
Exposure to the investigational product (or placebo) or administration of the study injection and 
AE are probably related if (1)  the investigational product  (or placebo) or study injection and AE 
are considered reasonably related in time and (2) the investigational product (or placebo) or 
Protocol SM04690- OA-[ADDRESS_1078716]’s last visit will be followed for 
a maximum of 30 days. Serious adverse events that are not resolved or stabilized during this time period will be followed until resolution or stabilization.  
9.2. Serious Adverse Events  
According to the ICH Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (E6), an SAE is any untoward 
medical occurrence during the course of a clinical investigation that is characterized by 1 or more of the following: 
• Results in death  
• Is life threatening  
• Requires nonscheduled (not routine or planned) subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_784236] ≥ 24 hours and admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is an important medical event, defined as an event that does not fit one of the other outcomes, but may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention (treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes. Examples include 
allergic bronchospasm (a serious problem with breathing) requiring treatment in an 
emergency room, serious blood dyscrasias (blood disorders), or seizure/convulsion that does not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. The development of drug dependence or drug 
abuse would be other examples of important medical events. 
Although pregnancy is not a formal SAE, if a study participant or the partner of a study 
participant becomes pregnant while the study participant is on study, the pregnancy is to be 
reported via the SAE reporting process . 
9.2.1. Investigator Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs must be reported as described in the study manual at [EMAIL_3381]
 or by [CONTACT_784275], study coordinator, other designated study personnel, or clinical research 
associate within [ADDRESS_1078717] report all SAEs 
promptly to the appropriate IRB/EC as required by [CONTACT_8236]. Sponsor contact  [CONTACT_784276] 1.

Modified Intent -to-Treat ( mITT) Analysis Set : ITT subjects who received a protocol specified 
dose of SM04690 or placebo, analyzed as treated . Subjects incorrectly receiving doses not 
prescribed by [CONTACT_784279].  
Per-Protocol Analysis Set : ITT subjects who complied with all study procedures and 
evaluations, and did not have any major protocol deviations  
Safety Analysis Set : Subjects who were randomized and received SM04690 or placebo will be 
included in the safety analyses.   
10.5. Data Analyses  
10.5.1. Global Parameters  
For all analyses detailed here, the following global parameters will be used.  For continuous 
variables, number of subjects in the analysis, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, 
and maximum will be reported. All categorical endpoints will be summarized using frequencies 
and percentages.  
10.5.2. Baseline  
For comparisons with baseline within each analysis population, baseline is defined as the last 
value recorded for any given parameter prior to stud y medication injection  at Day 1 . 
10.5.3. Safety analysis 
Safety assessments will be performed on all subjects who were randomized and received the 
study medication injection (SM04690 or placebo) . Safety assessments include physical 
examinations, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, solicitation of AEs and concomitant medications, and general medical evaluations. No formal statistical analyses are planned. Safety will be evaluated based on the incidence,  severity, and seriousness of treatment- emergent AEs 
and by [CONTACT_784280], relative to baseline.  
10.5.4. Interim Analysis 
An interim analysis will be performed after all subjects have completed their W eek 26 visit; 
however clinical study sites and subjects will remain blinde d throughout the study. The aim of 
this interim analysis is to assess safety and efficacy objectives at Weeks 13 and 26. No trial adaptation(s) will be made based upon these results. 
10.5.5. Efficacy  Analysis 
Efficacy analysis will be performed on the ITT , mITT , and PP Analysis Sets.  Change in primary 
and secondary efficacy endpoints from baseline will be estimated at specified time points  using 
parametric analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model s. Formal hypothesis testing between 
treatment groups will be conducted using a strategy to control the familywise error rate ; the error 
rate strategy is detailed in the study’s SAP.

specified time points using parametric analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model s. Logistic 
regression will be used to analyze the proportion of OARSI responders within each treatment group compared to placebo at specified  time  points. Exploratory subgroup analyses may also be 
performed.  
11. DATA COLLECTION, STU DY MONITORING, AND DATA 
DISCLOSURE  
11.1. Data Collection and Reporting  
The Investigator must maintain required records for all study subjects. Data for this study will be 
recorded in the subject's source document and on the eCRF s. All data on these  eCRF s should be 
recorded completely and promptly. A copy of the completed  eCRF s for each subject will be 
retained by [CONTACT_118250].  
The Investigator must maintain adequate and accurate source documents upon which eCRF s for 
each subject are based.  They are to be separate and distinct from  eCRF s, except for cases in 
which the Sponsor has predetermined that direct data entry into specified pages of the subject’s  
eCRF  is appropriate. The source documents should include detailed notes on the following: 
• The oral and written communication with the subject regarding the study treatment 
(including the risks and benefits of the study); the date and time of informed 
consent(s) must be recorded in the source documentation 
• The subject’s medical and disease history before participation in the study  
• The subject’s basic identifying information, such as subject number, that links the 
subject’s source documents with the eCRF s 
• The results of all diagnostic tests performed, diagnoses made, therapy provided, and 
any other data on the condition of the subject 
• The subject’s exposure to study medication  
• All AEs  
• The subject’s exposure to any concomitant therapy (including start and stop dates, 
route of administration, and dosage) 
11.2. Study Monitoring  
All aspects of the study will be monitored by [CONTACT_57756]’s designees with 
respect to current Good Clini cal Practice (GCP) and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for 
compliance with applicable government regulations. It is the responsibility of the Investigator to 
provide all study records, including eCRF s and source documents among other records, for 
review and inspection by [CONTACT_24653].  
All eCRF s will be 100% source verified against corresponding source documentation (e.g.,

evaluate the progress of the s tudy, including the verification of appropriate consent form 
procedures, review of drug accountability and preparation procedures, adherence to dosing 
procedures, and the verification of the accuracy and completeness of eCRF s. Clinical monitors 
will also e nsure that all protocol requirements, applicable US FDA regulations, other Regulatory 
requirements, and the Investigator’s obligations are being fulfilled.  
11.3. Records Retention  
During this study, an Investigator  is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case 
histories designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation on each 
individual treated with the investigational product or entered as a control in the investigation. Case report forms will be provided for each subject by [CONTACT_1034]. Data reported on the eCRF s 
and derived from source documents must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained.  The completed  eCRF s must be promptly reviewed, signed, and 
dated by a qualified physician who is an Investigator on the study. During this study, the 
Investigator must retain study medication (investigational product and placebo) disposition 
records, copi[INVESTIGATOR_343866] s (or electronic files), and source documents for the maximum period 
required by (1) applicable regulations and guidelines or institution procedures or  (2) for the 
period specified by [CONTACT_1034], whichever is longer. The Investigator must contact [CONTACT_784281]. 
The Sponsor will notify the Investigator when the study records are no longer needed. 
In the event the Investigator withdraws from the study (e.g., relocation, retirement), the records 
shall be transferred to a mutually agreed -upon designee (e.g., another Investigator ). Notice of 
such transfer will be given in writing to the Sponsor. 
The Investigator must ensure that clinical study records are retained according to national 
regulations, as documented in the Clinical Trial Agreement entered into with the Sponsor in 
connection with this study.  For example, US federal laws require that an Investigator  maintain all

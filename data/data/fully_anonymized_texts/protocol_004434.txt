CU IRB Protocol Form [ADDRESS_17680] PROPOSAL  1. Research Summary (400 words or less) People with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome/Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder (hEDS/HSD) often have pain, coordination problems, and low tolerance to activity and exercise. Therapeutic exercise is considered one of the most effective treatment options in the improvement of pain and disability in people with hEDS/HSD.(Engelbert et al, 2017; Simmonds et al, 2017) The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18708] 6 guiding principles: centering, concentration, control, precision, flow and breathing. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18709] a series of exercises that promote core stability, muscle strength and flexibility and attention to muscle control, posture and breathing (Wells et al, 2012). Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18710], and has been recommended for people with hEDS/HSD.(McNeill, 2018) A recent systematic review concluded that Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18711] a number of conditions.(By[CONTACT_18050], 2018) Although a large survey of 946 people with hEDS/HSD found that 26% of respondents considered Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18712] a helpful form of exercise,(Simmonds, 2017) there appears to be no research into the effectiveness of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18713].   One of the co-PI (Jeannie Di Bon) is a professional Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18714]-based Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18715]. This course guides participants through developi[INVESTIGATOR_18716]. Eighty people have subscribed to this course since it was first offered in August 2016. When people purchase access to these internet modules, [CONTACT_18879] is able to track how often they access the modules; hence, we would have a measure of compliance with the program.   The current research project proposes to measure pain, function, and common symptoms in individuals before and after 8 weeks of using this on-line Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18717], and will follow up 6 months later. Before starting Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18712], subjects will complete a series of on-line questionnaires using Survey Monkey, then will progress independently through the 5 video modules, performing the exercises 3 times/week. We will track utilization of the modules on-line as a measure of compliance. At the end of the [ADDRESS_17681] similar data again 6 months after completing the intervention.   2.  Introduction Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (hEDS) and Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder (HSD) are conditions characterized by [CONTACT_18836], resulting in many tissues in the body being overly flexible. Joint hypermobility is most obvious, hence the former name [CONTACT_18878]: joint hypermobility syndrome. HSD and hEDS comprise a continuum in which diagnostic criteria for hEDS are narrower. However, the pain and other symptoms such as sleep disturbance, fatigue, anxiety, proprioceptive (body position awareness) deficits, autonomic nervous system dysfunction, GI distress, can exist equally for both conditions.(Tinkle, 2017) The current study seeks to involve people throughout the continuum, hence hEDS/HSD.   Individuals with hEDS/HSD often have movement disorders, such as balance issues, due in part to reduced proprioception (Smith 2013), fear of movement or kinesiophobia and a reluctance to move due to the presence of chronic pain. Pain is often one of the first symptoms to appear with hypermobility (Smith 2013). Other issues such as fatigue and autonomic disorders such as Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) are also common in hEDS/HSD; these comorbidities can decrease desire to exercise as well as tolerance to upright (standing) exercise.  Therapeutic exercise is considered one of the most effective treatment options in the improvement of pain and disability in hEDS/HSD, but optimal type, frequency and intensity are not known.(Smith, 2014; Engelbert, 2017) However, pain, fatigue and fear are common barriers to exercise among people with hEDS/HSD.(Simmonds, 2017) Mind-body exercises, such as Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18712], Tai Chi, and yoga have been recommended for people with hEDS/HSD based on the 
  
CU IRB Protocol Form [ADDRESS_17682] that these mind-body activities are typi[INVESTIGATOR_18718].(McNeill, 2018; Russek, 2018)   Joseph Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18712] (1883-1967) called his method ‘Contrology’ - a complete coordination of mind and body. It was only after his death, that the method grew in popularity and became known as the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18719]. The original 6 guiding principles of centering, concentration, control, precision, flow and breathing remain true today. The method comprises a series of exercises that promotes core stability, muscle strength and flexibility and attention to muscle control, posture and breathing (Wells et al, 2012). Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18720] a mainstream, low-impact exercise with perceived benefits both physical (balance, flexibility, pain reduction, disability reduction) and psychological (mindfulness) (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18721], 1998).  It can be safely performed by [CONTACT_18837].     The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18722] (Latey, 2001, Kloubec 2011). Although a large survey of 946 people with hEDS/HSD found that 26% of respondents considered Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18712] a helpful form of exercise,(Simmonds, 2017) there appears to be no research into the effectiveness of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18713]. Used as a gentle, rehabilitation exercise method, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18723] a safe and effective type of exercise to manage the symptoms of pain, fatigue, disability and anxiety related to having hEDS/HSD. Furthermore, starting exercises supi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (lying down) may be better tolerated by [CONTACT_18838], such as POTS, than exercises in the upright position.   A systematic review concluded that Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18724] a number of chronic conditions, including chronic low back pain, multiple sclerosis, and chronic neck pain.(By[CONTACT_18050], 2018)  However, there is no research involving people with hEDS/HSD. There are several mechanisms by [CONTACT_18839][INVESTIGATOR_18725]/HSD. One is improved muscle strength and tone, which can stabilize hypermobile joints. Another is through improved body awareness, which may improve coordination. Also, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18726] a calming response.  Because of the proprioceptive deficits common in hypermobile individuals, use of small props like balls and bands can improve sensory awareness and help these individuals connect with their bodies.(Lauber, 2014)  Anxiety is a common symptom in people with hEDS/HSD.(Bulbena, 2017) Anxiety may be due to fear of movement associated with pain or proprioceptive deficits, or may be due to the racing heart rate associated with POTS. Kinesiophobia is an extreme fear of movement due to fear of vulnerability to pain or injury. Kinesiophobia appears to be common in hEDS/HSD, and may lead to decreased activity with resulting increased deconditioning and pain.(Celletti, 2013)  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18727],(Cruz-Diaz, 2018) and osteoporosis, but has not been studied in hEDS/HSD.(Oksuz, 2017)   People with hEDS/HSD appear to commonly hold their breath in an attempt to improve stability; increased tone/tension in accessory muscles of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (i.e., muscles other than the diaphragm, which is designed for continuous breathing) can cause pain and abnormal movement patterns. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18728], introducing simple mindfulness techniques and sensory awareness that can have an instant calming effect and reduce anxiety.(McNeill, 2017, Caldwell, 2013)   The current proposal is to study the potential benefits of an online Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18729]. The course was designed by a qualified Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18730]. Two of the PI (JDB and LR) have received very positive anecdotal feedback from people with hEDS/HSD who have taken this Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18731]. The course includes [ADDRESS_17683] movement. Safety precautions (e.g., holding on to a chair back for balance during the standing exercises, if needed) are also clearly explained. In the 3 years that this course has been available to the public, the developer (JDB) has never received any feedback that the exercises caused any harm. Furthermore, a Cochrane Review of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18732] 10 studies and 510 patients found minor or no adverse events in any of the research studies involving Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18733].(Yamoto, 2015) Consequently, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18734] a very safe form of exercise.   Subjects will be asked to do their Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18735] 3 times/week, to go through the modules in order, and to complete all modules by [CONTACT_2671] 8th week. However, subjects may choose how often to repeat given modules, and may return to modules that they find particularly helpful. While allowing subjects this choice results in an intervention that is somewhat variable among subjects, we feel it gives subjects some ownership over their program and reproduces how the modules are used in practice.  We propose to use the following outcome measures: • The Bristol Impact of Hypermobility (BIoH) questionnaire to measure function, quality of life, and common symptoms of hEDS/HSD. (Palmer, 2017) • The International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ), supplemented by [CONTACT_18840]-body and strengthening exercise, to measure physical activity.(Booth, 2000) • The Revised Body Awareness Rating Questionnaire (R-BARQ) to measure mind-body awareness and dysfunctional breathing patterns. (Dragesund, 2018) • The Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia, short form (TSK-11), to measure kinesiophobia, or fear with movement.(Woby, 2005)  Our primary outcome measures will be a hypermobility-specific functional/disability measure, The Bristol Impact of Hypermobility (BIoH) questionnaire.(Palmer, 2017) The BIoH is a 55 item questionnaire that asks about pain, fatigue, joint instability, function, self-efficacy and attitudes about having hypermobility. It is the only outcome measure specifically validated for hypermobility-related conditions, and it is recommended by [CONTACT_18841], whose goal is to encourage EDS researchers to use consistent outcome measures.   We will also measure physical activity, to determine whether participation in Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18736]. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form is a validated survey assessing physical activity during work, sport, and leisure time. (Booth, 2000) We will add questions that will track participation in mind-body exercise, such as Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18712], yoga, Tai Chi, etc. and strengthening, as these activities are not included in the IPAQ.   Kinesiophobia will be assessed through the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia, short form (TSK-11), which is an 11-question survey asking about fear of movement and fear of injury.(Woby, 2005) The Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia is one of the recommended Common Data Elements for EDS. We will also collect qualitative data from weekly electronic contact.   The Revised Body Awareness Rating Questionnaire (R-BARQ) includes 12 questions that ask about body awareness, response to discomfort, breathing patters, and physical response to stress.(Dragesund, 2018) This tool may provide insight into the mechanism by [CONTACT_18842], by [CONTACT_18843], relaxation, effective breathing, etc.  We will also solicit qualitative feedback about the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18737]. This qualitative information will build upon a recent study using qualitative methods to assess 
  
CU IRB Protocol Form [ADDRESS_17684] Revised 2018.07.12 attitudes towards exercise among people with hEDS/HSD.(Simmonds, 2017)  The current study will repeat the questionnaires at the end of the [ADDRESS_17685] been maintained. We will also monitor whether subjects continue to do the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18738] 6 months, either using the videos or on their own.  If findings in the current study are encouraging, a more formal randomized control trial would be an appropriate progression. The qualitative data may provide useful information about how to implement a follow-up study more effectively.   3. Objectives and Hypotheses 1. Implement a pi[INVESTIGATOR_18739]-line Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18740]/HSD results in beneficial changes when compared to a wait-list comparison group. We understand that the evidence will not be strong with a non-random comparison group, but having a comparison group is better than not having one. We hypothesize that 8 weeks of this specialized Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18741]: a. Decreased pain and symptoms, improved function and quality of life (measured using the BIoH),  b. Increased physical activity (measured using IPAQ with additional questions) c. Improved body awareness (R-BARQ) and less dysfunctional breathing patterns (R-BARQ) d. Decreased fear of movement (TSK-11). 2. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18742] a future study. We are looking for basement and ceiling effects, as well as change over time. 3. Explore whether certain patterns of implementation of the on-line course are associated with better outcomes. For example, is it better to repeat one module multiple times before moving on, or to move around among modules? This will be descriptive correlational data.  4. Gather qualitative data to better understand factors that may influence compliance or maximal benefit. These data can inform future research into either Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18743]-accessible exercise training for this population. This qualitative information also provides insights into factors that influence participation in exercise within this population, and whether certain patterns are observed among people who benefit from the program compared to those who do not.    Human Subjects Protection Information 4. . Participants: a. Number: 500 Age range: 18-70 Gender: Any, though the population is likely to be mostly female as hEDS/HSD affects more women than men.  b. Recruitment population, including inclusion/exclusion criteria:  Because the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18744]-line, subjects may participate from anywhere in the world. a. Inclusion criteria:  i. Have some form of HSD/hEDS diagnosed by [CONTACT_18844]; this would include individuals diagnosed with Joint Hypermobility Syndrome using the pre-[ADDRESS_17686] 3 times per week, unless they experience some adverse event or illness that prevents them from safely participating.  b. Exclusion criteria i. Medical restrictions (such as recent and healing surgery, fractures, comorbidities such as severe rheumatoid arthritis or neurological conditions, etc.) that prevent them from safely doing gentle exercise lying down on the floor, sitting, and standing.  ii. Inability to safely stand (with or without using upper extremity for balance) for 
  
CU IRB Protocol Form [ADDRESS_17687] Revised 2018.07.12 10 consecutive minutes. iii. Recent injuries or changes in status that are not stable. This will be defined as “A significant change in your wellness due to recent injury or new symptoms in the past month that result in your wellness during the past month being very different from the past 5 months. Flare epi[INVESTIGATOR_18745].” iv. Significantly changed treatment approach or medication within the past 3 months or be expecting to change their treatment program (including medication changes) during the study. This would make it difficult for us to know if changes are due to the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18746]. However, we understand that their health status may change such that they need to change their health care routine for physical and mental health. v. Currently receiving regular rehabilitation such as physical therapy, or having received PT or a similar movement-based therapy (such as such as Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18712], Feldenkrais, Tai Chi, qigung, yoga) in the past 3 months. Individuals who continue to do exercises from any of these sources are not excluded, as these individuals should be stable on their current routine.  vi. Currently doing more than 30 minutes/week of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18747].  vii. Under 18 years old or over 70 years old. c. Recruitment procedures (Attach advertisements or recruitment notices as labeled appendices. Do not begin recruiting until you have an approved protocol.):   Recruitment posters, emails and social media postings will include the information shown in Appendix A. For locations that require a shorter announcement, the brief recruitment notice (Appendix A2) will be used, and will link to the full recruitment notice.  a. The EDS Society website allows requests to be submitted online and distributed to their subscribers – link: https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/research-survey-submission/  b. Social Media via Jeannie Di Bon Facebook, Twitter and Instagram accounts c. Social media and support groups specifically for those with EDS / HSD  d. Website announcement on www.jeanniedibon.com e. Notice in the instructor’s Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18748] f. Snowball sampling through current clients and database of Jeannie Di Bon, who will be given or emailed the recruitment notice. Many of the current or past clients would themselves be excluded, as they already participate regularly in Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18712]. But, they may know other people who could participate.   d. Incentives and compensation Subjects will be able to use the on-line Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18731] “Strengthen Your Hypermobile Core” during the study (8 weeks of intervention and 6 months of follow-up) for free . Subjects who complete the study (8 week and 6 month questionnaires) will be given permanent access to this course as incentive to complete the study.   e. Group assignment method  This is a pre-test/post-test design and all subjects will serve as their own control, as we will be measuring change over time. The wait-list group will also serve as a comparison group. Because of high demand, groups will be assigned in a pragmatic way, with those already enrolled in the immediate start group, and the next, equal number in the 8-week control group. Assignment is therefore determined by [CONTACT_18845].   5. Informed Consent a. Procedure for obtaining Informed Consent from all participants (or their parent[s] or guardian[s])? Describe who will obtain consent. (Attach Informed Consent form.)   The study will be explained on an internet page that people can access if they are interested 
  
CU IRB Protocol Form [ADDRESS_17688] Revised 2018.07.12 in participating (Appendix B). Potential subjects will read the Informed Consent document and will be allowed to contact [CONTACT_18846]. People who choose to participate will be directed to a SurveyMonkey site that will require they agree to the Informed Consent to be able to continue to the questionnaires. Subjects will be able to withdraw from the research at any time; if they request that their data be deleted, they will lose access to the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18749].    The Informed Consent form will ask subjects to attest to the fact that they are between 18-[ADDRESS_17689] a waiver of obtaining written informed consent on the basis that all interaction with subjects is on-line and it is not practical to obtain signed informed consent. The on-line informed consent form advises that by [CONTACT_18847], they are consenting to participate.   b. If minors or other participants unable to provide legal informed consent are involved, outline procedures to be used in obtaining their agreement (assent) to participate, in addition to the consent of the parent(s) or guardian(s). (Attach assent form or statement.) No minors will participate in this study. The questionnaires will ask each subject to verify that he/she is [ADDRESS_17690] involvement: The intervention is provided through an on-line Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18750]://jeanniedibon.com/strengthen-your-hypermobile-core/. “Strengthen Your Hypermobile Core” has [ADDRESS_17691] this same flexibility so, while it adds variability to the intervention, it better reflects how the program is actually used.   Subjects will be asked to do their Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18751] (not from memory) to ensure that they are performing techniques optimally. Each module lasts [ADDRESS_17692] breaks, if needed, or stop and complete a session later.  Subjects will commit to doing 3 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18752], for a total of 75-90 minutes/week (depending on the exact length of the modules they do). The commercial application of this on-line Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18753], so we will have data regarding compliance and which modules are used at which time. Data about module utilization will be linked to the subject’s self-created research code, which will keep this data anonymous as we cannot link the self-created research code to any identifiable individual.  Subjects will complete questionnaires before starting the on-line Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18754]. Completing these questionnaires on SurveyMonkey is likely to take 30-[ADDRESS_17693] 3 times/week. This email will also ask them to complete some narrative questions on SurveyMonkey regarding whether they have had any problems completing the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18755] [ADDRESS_17694] one of the PI (JD) if they have questions or problems with the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18712], or (LR) if they have any questions about research participation.  At the end of [ADDRESS_17695] again and ask him/her to repeat the initial questionnaires on SurveyMonkey, and again comment on whether they felt the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18756].   We will also include an 8-week wait-list group constructed from subjects asking to participate after we have already recruited [ADDRESS_17696] is primarily because we do not want to be so overwhelmed by [CONTACT_18848] (responding to questions about the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18712], sending out follow-up surveys, etc.). Also, a wait-list group would provide a control group (albeit not randomly selected). All participants who do not start in the initial group will be asked if they still want to participate in a wait-list group; if they do, we will contact [CONTACT_476] 8 weeks after their initial surveys were completed, ask them to repeat the surveys, then start them in the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18757].   b. Measurement tools. (Attach questionnaires and surveys as labeled appendices.) • Demographic questionnaire (see Appendix C) • The Bristol Impact of Hypermobility questionnaire (BIoH) will be used to assess changes in pain, fatigue, self-efficacy and function.(Palmer, 2017. see Appendix D) • The Revised Body Awareness Rating Questionnaire (R-BARQ). 12 questions. (Dragesund, 2018, Appendix E). • The Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK, 11 item version) will be used to assess kinesiophobia.  (Woby, 2005. See Appendix F) • The International Physical Activity Questionnaires (IPAQ) Short Form is a validated survey assessing physical activity during work, sport, and leisure time; this will be used to monitor activity level.(Booth, 2000. See Appendix G)  • Weekly Email questions for qualitative information and adverse event reporting. (Appendix H)  • Post-intervention questions for 8 weeks and 6 months (Appendix I)  c. Equipment interfacing with subjects:  Subjects will interface with the questionnaires and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18758]. Subjects will be asked to use a yoga mat or padded floor, small ball or towel roll, and elastic exercise band or inelastic strap to provide feedback during some of the exercises.   d. If deception is necessary, justify and describe debriefing procedures. (Attach debriefing statement as labeled appendix.) No deception is involved.  e. Analysis of outcomes: • Quantitative data will be coded and entered into Excel, reviewed for outliers, and transferred to SPSS • Descriptive statistics related to demographics and initial scores for BIoH, IPAQ, TSK-11, R-BARQ • Descriptive statistics related to subjects use of the different modules (which Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18759] 8 weeks and overall), and continued use of the modules through the [ADDRESS_17697] Revised 2018.07.12 • Repeated Measures ANOVA comparing pretest, post-test (8 wk) and [ADDRESS_17698]: BIoH, IPAQ, TSK-11, R-BARQ • ANOVA comparing change over [ADDRESS_17699] group: BIoH, IPAQ, TSK-11, R-BARQ • Regression analysis using IPAQ, TSK-11, R-BARQ to predict quality of life and function as measured using BIoH before intervention, after intervention (including compliance) and 6 months later (including compliance). • Qualitative analysis of the narrative (email) information using content analysis using the following process:(Bengtsson, 2016) o Decontextualization to identify meaning units, create code list o Recontextualization to verify that all important information has been coded o Categorization to organize themes, with triangulation by [CONTACT_431] o Compi[INVESTIGATOR_18760], audit, member check if subjects agree We understand that the lack of a randomized control group makes our current design less rigorous than a randomized control trial (RCT), but having a wait-list comparison group makes the design stronger.   7. Risks and Benefits a. Risks: detail stress, physical, psychological, social or economic harm that may be incurred by [CONTACT_18849]? Describe risks (including risks associated with release of personal information) and methods for minimizing these risks.  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18761]; it is therefore unlikely that subjects will experience any pain or injury from participating in the activity. While, some soreness is always a possibility after beginning a new exercise/activity, [ADDRESS_17700] reported any adverse effects. A systematic review of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18762] 2 studies that discussed adverse events: one study reported no events and the other study reported 2 minor events.(Yamato, 2016) Furthermore, participation in this research creates no greater risk than if people signed up for this program outside of this research. Risk of harm is minimized by [CONTACT_18850]-awareness and safety during classes, and instructing subjects to omit any exercise in the videos that causes discomfort or does not feel safe to them. The disclaimer applied to all of Jeannie’s on-line Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18763]-line courses.  There is minimal risk of private information being revealed, as subjects will use an ID code known only to them for their data on SurveyMonkey. Thus, all of the survey data will be collected, stored and analyzed without any personal identifiers. Access to the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18764]’ email address and their self-generated research code; only Jeannie Di Bon will know subjects’ email address, but she will not have access to personal information shared on SurveyMonkey. Reminder emails will be sent out by [CONTACT_18851]’ email address, but these emails will link to SurveyMonkey where subjects can enter their self-generated research ID. Subjects will not email any information to Jeannie as part of the research (though they are allowed to contact [CONTACT_18852], as are all users of her programs). Leslie and Jane will have access to the SurveyMonkey data, but will not have email addresses. Since subjects will receive access to the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18765], subjects will not be providing credit card information.   We will be asking for qualitative information in the weekly check-in. Although we will explicitly ask subjects to not include any identifiable information in these narrative responses, it is possible that they might.  Any identifiable information will be deleted when narrative data are extracted from SurveyMonkey for further data analysis.    b. For subjects in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and/or Norway, describe how you will comply with GDPR regulations. For additional information about the GDPR, please see https://www.cnet.com/how-to/what-gdpr-means-for-facebook-google-the-eu-us-and-you/ or http://rgs.usu.edu/irb/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2018/04/GDPR-Guidance.pdf. According to GDPR regulations, we will be collecting Personal Data as we will be using subjects’ email address to contact [CONTACT_476], send them links to surveys, and enroll them in the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18731]. All data entered into SurveyMonkey (all data except utilization of the on-line modules) will be through a subject-generated identification code, so the data in SurveyMonkey will be anonymous. Jeannie Di Bon, who runs the on-line Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18766], will have email addresses and the subject-generated ID 
  
CU IRB Protocol Form [ADDRESS_17701]-generated ID code. Once data collection for any individual is complete, that person’s email address will be deleted from the research data, which will then be anonymous. Jeannie Di Bon will continue to have access to the email address as long as that individual wants to continue accessing the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18754].   c. Address how subjects will be monitored for adverse effects and what remediation is offered. The research will include a weekly email to touch base with each subject, reminding them to participate at the level they are comfortable (doing any, all, or no Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18712]). Subjects will be asked about increased pain or problems, beyond mild soreness from doing new exercises, that they think may be due to the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18733], as that is important data. Subjects will be reminded: ”If you have increased pain or problems, either due to the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18767], please modify or omit any or all Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18768].” However, no remediation will be offered or provided.  Subjects   d. Does the data to be collected relate to illegal activities? If so explain. NA  e. Rate risk level. Check the most appropriate risk level below. (Minimal risk means that the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests.)   The research involves no more than minimal risk to subjects.   The research involves more than minimal risk to subjects but the risk(s) represents a minor increase over minimal risk, or   The research involves more than minimal risk to subjects and the risk(s) represents more than a minor increase over minimal risk.   f. Methods for providing anonymity or confidentiality. For research involving patients, describe how HIPAA requirements will be met.  Each subject will create his/her own identifying code based on personal information. The identifier will be created using the following criteria: • The [ADDRESS_17702] letters of the month (in English) of your MOTHER’S birthday (e.g., SEP)  • YOUR 2-digit birthday date (e.g., ∅8 for May, 8th) (01-31) • The first letter of YOUR MIDDLE NAME; enter X if you do not know or have a middle name (e.g. M for Mary) (A-Z) • The total number of OLDER SIBLINGS you have, including living, deceased, and half (e.g., 0 if you are an only child; enter [ADDRESS_17703] 10 or more siblings) (0-9) For the examples given above, the identifier would be SEP08M0 (SEP∅8M∅). Identifiers using these variables have been shown to be highly repeatable, and there are processes for linking identifiers that are mismatched by [CONTACT_18853].(Yurek, 2008) Once data collection is complete, all subject email addresses will be deleted from the research data. The email address will be retained by [CONTACT_18854]. Di Bon as long as these individuals choose to use the on-line Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18757], in the same way that typi[INVESTIGATOR_18769]. Research subjects may request that their emails be deleted by [CONTACT_18854]. Di Bon if they no longer want to access the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18754].   g. Plan for destroying private, identifiable data at the end of the research project. (You must request approval for continuation annually until all private, identifiable data has been destroyed.) Subjects’ email address is the only identifying information that is collected during this research. Once a subject has completed the study, that person’s email address will be deleted from the research data. Identifying codes will be discarded after all data for a given individual have been collected and entered into the computer of the primary researcher, Leslie Russek.  h. Benefits to participants: Subjects will be able to participate in on-line Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18770], and will be allowed to continue using the on-line training after the research is completed.   
  
CU IRB Protocol Form [ADDRESS_17704] Revised 2018.07.12 i. Benefits to society from the research: Very little is currently known about efficacious treatments for HSD/EDS, so this pi[INVESTIGATOR_18771]. Also, this research establishes a format for pi[INVESTIGATOR_18772]-line training that is potentially feasible for additional interventions; this would facilitate more clinical research regarding treatments for HSD/EDS in the future. If, as anecdotal evidence suggests, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18773]/EDS, this research may benefit this population by [CONTACT_18855].   j. Rate benefit level. A research benefit is considered to be something of health-related, psychosocial, or other value to an individual research subject, or something that will contribute to the acquisition of generalizable knowledge. Money or other compensation for participation in research is not considered to be a benefit, but rather compensation for research-related inconveniences. Check the most appropriate benefit level, below:   No prospect of direct benefit to individual subjects, but likely to yield generalizable knowledge about a population group to which the subject belongs;  No prospect of direct benefit to individual subjects, but likely to yield generalizable knowledge that may benefit a population group to which the subject belongs; or   The research involves the prospect of direct benefit to participating subjects.   8. Investigational Device Exemption (IDE): Does this research involve any device that has not been FDA approved or which is being used for a purpose for which it has not been approved? If so, please review Clarkson’s guidelines regarding IDE. What are the results of safety testing performed for this device?   NA  9. Conflict of interest statement: One of the researchers (JD) has a financial interest in the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18774]. While her role is essential for the intervention and data collection, data analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_18856].    10. Citations   1. Bengtsson M.

We will contact [CONTACT_18860], and ask if you have any comments or concerns. You will repeat the questionnaires after 8 weeks of doing the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18712], and again 6 months later. While discomfort or injury are unlikely, these are always possible with a new exercise program. You may omit any exercise or movement that causes discomfort and should not do anything that you feel is not safe for you. Your privacy will be protected because survey data will be stored using an identification code that only you know; once your data collection is complete, your email address will be removed from the data and it will not be possible to link you to the data.

We reserve the right to make alterations to any sessions or advice without notice.  Privacy risks: Each subject will create his/her own identification code based on information known to you but not sufficient for others to identify you. Jeannie Di Bon will know your email address and your identification code as part of giving you access to the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18731]. She will also have access to data about which Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18798]. She will not have access to personal information you share via questionnaires SurveyMonkey. The other researchers will have access to the SurveyMonkey data, but will not know your email and will therefore not know any identifying information about you. Your self-generated code will allow us to link your questionnaire responses before and after, your weekly comments on the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18757], as well as to track your use of the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18799]. Information that you provide in the questionnaires and the weekly check-in will be collected securely using SurveyMonkey, which will not track your ISP (internet) address. Any identifiable information you may unintentionally include in the weekly narrative comments will be removed from the data before further analysis. Once all data has been collected for you, your self-created identifying code and email address will be removed from the data. Data from individual subjects will not be shared with anyone other than the researchers and results will be published with data for many subjects combined so that no individual can be identified. You may request that all data associated with you be deleted; see below for details.   The benefits to you if you take part in this study: Subjects will be able to participate in the on-line Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18731] “Strengthen Your Hypermobile Core” free of charge, and will be allowed to continue using the on-line training after the research is completed. This is a professionally developed Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18800]. People who have completed this program, in the past, have reported decreased pain and fewer symptoms from their hypermobility, so you may also find it beneficial.   What will you receive for taking part in this study: You will receive the on-line Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18731] “Strengthen Your Hypermobile Core” free of charge, and will be allowed to continue using the on-line training after the research is completed.

What will happen to the information collected in this study: Each subject will create his/her own subject code based on personal information, and all data will be collected using this identifying code. We will have your email address so that we can send you links to the questionnaires and weekly check-ins, but you will enter your data directly into SurveyMonkey, which will not be able to link your data to your email.  We will also be asking for weekly comments about your experience doing Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18712]; if you accidentally include any identifying information in your comments, this identifying information will be deleted before data are analyzed. Once your participation in the study is finished, we will delete your email from the research data. If you choose to continue access to the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_18757], [CONTACT_18879] will still have your email address, but she will not have access to your individual research data.

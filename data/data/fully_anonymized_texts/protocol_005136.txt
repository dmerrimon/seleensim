NUMBER OF SITES  1 
  RATIONALE  Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurologic disorder characterized by 
[CONTACT_846104], which results in disruption of nerve signal, damage to 
axons, and, ultimately, neurodegeneration.  In order to treat MS, new 
methods for promoting repair (remyeli nation) are sorely needed.   
There is a strong preclinical (including EAE)7 and epi[INVESTIGATOR_846083], 
including evidence of endogenous (puberty, postpartum period s)8 and 
exogenous hormonal influences on MS risk9-14 and course.15,16 MS affects 3 
times more women than men, and disease course in women appears overall 
less aggressive (on MRI, fewer T2 -hyperintense demyelinated lesions 
develop into axonal destruction visualized as hypointense T1 “black 
holes ”8,17).   
BZA, a third -generation SERM with extensive sa fety data in humans, was 
identified in a novel high -throughput screen (BIMA screen) for compounds 
capable of promoting remyelination.  Subsequent analysis validated BZA ’s 
remyelinating effect in vitro and in vivo  following demyelinating insult.  
Given stro ng pre -clinical support for BZA ’s remyelinating potential, and the 
clinical success of other compounds identified using the BIMA screen 
(Green et al., 2017), we propose the investigation of BZA as a remyelinating 
therapy in MS.   
  STUDY DESIGN  This is a single -center, double blind, randomized, c ontrolled, delayed -start 
Phase 2  clinical trial investigating the remyelinating effects of BZA relative 
to placebo.  
  PRIMARY 
OBJECTIVE  The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of BZA relative to placebo 
for reducing P100 latencies on full field transient pattern reversal visual 
evoked potentials at 90 days in a do uble-blinded trial (1st [ADDRESS_1176102] 90 days  of Group B.)

Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015  SECONDARY 
OBJECTIVES  ● The first key secondary objective is to assess  whether latency delay at 180 
days decreases to a greater extent in Group A (exposed to BZA for 90 days 
during both Stage 1 and Stage 2) when compared to Group B (exposed to 
placebo during Stage 1 and BZA for only 90 days during Stage 2).  
● The second key  secondary objective is to demonstrate the tolerability of 
BZA in this population. This will include special focus with regards to 
fatigue as this is a major symptom for patients suffering from multiple 
sclerosis.  
● The third key secondary ob jective is to document the safety of BZA in this 
population of patients.  
● The fourth key secondary objective of this study is to help assess which 
secondary and tertiary outcomes are likely to be informative for future 
remyelin ating trials in multiple scl erosis.

of bazedoxifene 40mg vs. placebo on promoting remyelination in women with multiple 
sclerosis (MS), as measured by [CONTACT_846107].  
 
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most prevalent chronic, non -traumatic neurological 
disorder among young adults; MS affects approximately [ADDRESS_1176110] for 
MS; diagnoses are made on the recognition of clinical disease patterns and the exclusion 
of alternatives.[ADDRESS_1176111] of action potentials.4  Myelin 
loss in MS res ults in disruption of the nerve signal, axonal damage, and ultimately 
neurodegeneration. To effectively prevent the downstream effects of myelin injury, novel 
approaches to promote repair will be required.  
There is a strong preclinical (including EAE)7 and epi[INVESTIGATOR_846086], including evidence of 
endogenous (puberty, postpartum periods)8 and exogenous hormonal influences on MS 
risk9-14 and course.15,16 MS affects 3 times more women than men, and disease course in 
women appears overall l ess aggressive (on MRI, fewer T2 -hyperintense demyelinated 
lesions develop into axonal destruction visualized as hypointense T1 “black holes ”8,17).  PI

do not appear to be “protected ” from progression typi[INVESTIGATOR_846087] c ounterpart s.18 
Further, she has shown that MS disease severity may worsen with ovarian aging.19,20 This 
age-related decline in gonadal steroids might represent a sex-specific  influence21 on age -
related disability progression,22 and on decreased CNS resilience —including  through 
remyelination —in the face of neuroinflammatory injury.  
Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators ( SERMs ) provide more tissue -selective, full 
or partial agonism or antagonism of estrogen receptors (ER α and ERβ).25 It is widely 
believed that modulation of ER α and/or ER β induce s neuroprotection through 
remyelination.[ADDRESS_1176112] indazole -chloride (Ind -Cl) induces corpus callosum remyelination

transient focal cerebral ischemia, BZA exerted neuroprotective actions mainly in the 
cortical region, and estradiol at the subcortical level.34 Further, our pre -published work 
presented at this year ’s joint Americas —Europea n Committee for Treatment and Research 
in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS —ECTRIMS) conference in Paris, demonstrates that 
BZA enhances OPC differentiation in vitro and in vivo  and promotes functional 
remyelination (Bove  et al., ECTRIMS 2017).  
To date, the  clinical  remyelinating effects of BZA  are unknown.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_1176117] been identified as compounds capable of pro moting oligodendrocyte 
differentiation using several recent unbiased screens for remyelination ,24 including BIMA  (Binary 
Indicant for myelination using Micropi[INVESTIGATOR_846088]), a functional high -throughput screen developed 
by [CONTACT_846109].1 BIMA involves freestanding micropi[INVESTIGATOR_846089] -section. These micropi[INVESTIGATOR_846090] 96 - and 384 -well formats, testing therapeutic 
compounds ’ direct influences on oligodendroglia without indirect effects from neurons.  
Using this high throughput  screen,  BZA, was identified as a bioactive compound with 
strong remyelinating potential ( platform presentation, AAN 2017 Annual Meeting ).  Our pre -
published work validate d this finding in vitro and in vivo ; OPCs were derived from WT P7 rat 
pups using prev iously validated methodology (Mei et al., 2014), cultured in isolation, and treated 
with increasing concentrations (5 -500nM) of BZA for 48 hours.  At all concentrations (5nM to 
500nM) BZA significantly enhanced OPC differentiation and subsequent myelinatio n (platform 
presentation, AAN 2017 Annual Meeting [44]).  Following a lysolecithin induced toxic, focal 
demyelinating injury to the corpus collosum of 8 -week old adult mice, daily BZA delivered via 
oral gavage resulted in enhanced differentiation and an in creased number of oligodendrocytes in 
the lesion area when compared to controls. Given subsequent in vitro analysis of BZA ’s 
differentiation effect on OPCs isolated from ER  and ER null mice (not shown), which revealed 
a remyelinating mechanism that is in dependent of either ER, we performed the same in vivo  
analysis on ER -ER double knockout mice.  Comparable OPC differentiation and remyelination 
following focal demyelination confirmed that the potent reparative effects of BZA is maintained in 
the absence of ERs.  
1.2 Overview of Clinical Studies  
Remyelination. Recently published w ork from the collaborating Chan and Green Labs at UCSF, 
provides strong support for the BIMA screening method ’s ability to identify remyelinating 
compounds with strong translational potential.  Clemastine , a first -generation antihistamine , which 
is known t o readily cross the blood -brain -barrier and has been available as an ‘over the counter ’ in 
the U.S. since 1992, was identified using this screen and subsequently tested in a clinical trial 
Riley M. Bovc  Confidential  
 
Version #:  Version Date:  Page 14 of 43 
Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015  assessing it ’s remyelinating potential in patients with MS.  This t rial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) used VEP 
latency, a well -validated measure of remyelination, to gauge Clemastine ’s therapeutic efficacy  
over the course of the trial period.  To date, this remains the only randomized controlled trial to 
document efficacy of a remyelinating drug for chronic demyelinating inju ry in MS (Green et al., 
2017).  These findings support the investigation of compounds with high translational potential 
that have b een identified in BIMA screens.    
 
Bazedoxifene in clinical trials.  The recent FDA  approval of Duavee (BZA + conjugated estrogens) 
in the U.S  was largely dependent on safety and efficacy data obtained from the Selective 
estrogens, Menopause, And Response to Therapy (SMART) trials.  The first SMART trial, 
SMART -1, included 3,[ADDRESS_1176118] one dose of the study drug ; of this group, 
840 participants received  the same  daily  dose of BZA (40 mg) as is outlined in this protocol.  At 
the end of the 2 -year study, the incidence of adverse events did not differ significantly  when 
compared to placebo, nor were significant differences observed between  the 20 mg and 40 mg 
BZA groups (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_846091]., 2009).  Subsequent SMART trials underscore the safety of BZA in 
humans but do not include [ADDRESS_1176119] 
effective dose.   
The approval of Conbriza (BZA) in the E.U. and Viviant (BZA) in Asia are a lso supported by 
[CONTACT_846110] -scale Phase I -III clinical trials documenting safety and efficacy.  In a 3 -year, 
randomized, placebo -, and active -controlled clinical trial assessing the efficacy of BZA in 
reducing vertebral fracture risk in postmenopausal w omen with osteoporosis, more than 3,750 
women took daily BZA, 1,872 of them at a daily dose of 40 mg.  BZA was well tolerated across 
all treatment doses over the 3 -year period of therapy and was shown to be effective in reducing 
risk of vertebral fracture,  increasing BMD of the hip and spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and reducing bone turnover 
(Silverman et al., 2008).  Multiple other studies, albeit slightly smaller in scale, include treatment 
groups where patients received daily 40 mg BZA (Itabashi et al., 2011; Miller et al., 20 08; Ronkin 
et al., 2005) and exhibit a favorable safety and tolerability profile.   
 
2 STUDY RATIONALE  
BZA  is an approved medication  in the EU and Japan  (Conbriza and Vivant, respectively)  for the 
treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in women at increase d risk of fract ure.  Multiple 
longitudinal, multicenter Phase I -III trials have unequivocally supported the use of BZA in human 
populations matching our inclusion criteria for age and sex  (Itabashi et al., 2011; Miller et al., 
2008; Pi[INVESTIGATOR_846092]., 2009; Ro nkin et al., 2005; Silverman et al., 2008).   We are confident in these 
safety data, which underscore the minimal assumption of risk, and believe the benefit to individual 
patients with MS —and the scientific community as a whole —to be far greater than the b urden of 
reasonably occurring treatment emergent adverse reactions.  
2.1 Risk / Benefit Assessment  
The potential benefit resulting from participation in this study is immense —both for the individual 
and the scientific community.  If our preclinical findings, indicating BZA ’s therapeutic potential 
for remyelination, are upheld in patients with MS, it will represent a significant step towards 
fulfilling the long unmet need for reparative treatments.   These potential benefits outweigh the 
minimal risk a ssumed in participation in this study.

blinded trial (1st [ADDRESS_1176120] 90 days of Group B.)  
3.2 Secondary Objectives  
● The first key secondary objective is to assess whether latency delay at 180 days 
decreases to a greater extent in Group A (exposed to BZA for 90 days during both Stage 1 
and Stage 2) when compared to Group B (exposed to placebo during Stage 1 and BZA for 
only 90 days during Stage 2).  
● The second key secondary objective is to demonstrate the tolerability of BZA in this 
population. This will include  special focus with regards to fatigue as this is a major 
symptom for patients suffering from multiple sclerosis.  
● The third key secondary objective is to document the safety of BZA in this population 
of patients.  
● The fourth key secondary objective of t his study is to help assess which secondary and 
tertiary outcomes are likely to be informative for future remyelinating trials in multiple 
sclerosis.  
Additional Secondary Objectives:  
● To evaluate the efficacy of BZA relative to placebo in increasing magne tization 
transfer ratios derived from magnetic resonance imaging of the brain during the 
period of exposure to active treatment.  
● To evaluate the efficacy of BZA relative to placebo in reducing latency delay on 
multifocal visual evoked potentials during t he period of exposure to active 
medication.  
● To evaluate the efficacy of BZA relative to placebo at reducing radial 
diffusivity derived from diffusion tensor imaging as assessed by [CONTACT_846111]. 
● To evaluate the efficacy of BZA in reducing the EDSS score at the end of Stage 
1 (Group A exposed to BZA for 90 days, Group B exposed to placebo for 90 
days), as well the efficacy of BZA in reducing EDSS at the end of Stage 2 (after 
180 days of BZA in Group A and 90 days of placebo + 90 days of BZA in Group 
B).   
● To evaluate the efficacy of BZA relative to placebo in improving Symbol Digit 
Modalities Test (SDMT) performance at the end of Stage [ADDRESS_1176121].

Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015  Patients will be randomized 1:1 into two groups: Group A and Group B. Group A will receive 180 
days of Bazedoxifene while Group B will receive 90 days of placebo followed by 90 days of 
Bazedoxifene. Patients will receive two fixed oral tablet s of 20mg Bazedoxifene  (Conbriza)  daily  
(to be taken at the same time) .  Patients will be permitted to remain on their standard disease

Screening data will be reviewed to determine subject eligibility.  Subjects who meet all 
inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be entered into the study  
5 CRITERIA FOR EVALUAT ION  
5.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
Visual evoked potentials  (VEPs) are cortically generated electrical potentials recorded over the 
scalp in response to a visual stimulus. After stimulation, a transient, cortically generated response 
is tied to the relevant stimulus (the transient VEP) and co nsists of a series of potentials that are 
alternately positive and negative in polarity.  They are labeled on the basis of their polarity and 
latency. In most individuals, the first response of the full - field pattern -reversal VEP recorded mid -
occipi[INVESTIGATOR_846093] a negative deflection termed the N75. However, given lack of consistency of both the 
presence and latency of the N75, by [CONTACT_846112] -field VEPs usually are assessed by [CONTACT_846113] [ADDRESS_1176122].  Check size wil l be held at 32 minutes of arc 
as calculated by [CONTACT_6388] M = 3438*W/D (M = minutes of arc; W = width of an individual 
check; D = distance from screen in mm).  Standard recording time is approximately [ADDRESS_1176123] will be the P100 latency although other parameters may be  
studied at a later date in secondary analyses.  
  
5.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
5.2.1  Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)  
 
EDSS Score will be determined, based on neurological examination, by a trained certified EDSS 
rater at sched uled visits according to Appendix -[ADDRESS_1176124] EDSS performed by [CONTACT_846114].  
The EDSS is an ordinal scale used for assessing neurological impairment of MS  based on a 
neurological examination. It consists of scores in each of seven functional systems (FS) and an 
ambulation score that are then combined to determine the EDSS [ranging from 0 (normal) to 10 
(death due to MS)]. The FSs are the Visual, Brain Stem, Pyramidal, Cerebellar, Sensory, Bowel & 
Bladder, and Cerebral functions. The FSs and EDSS steps will be assessed in a standardized 
Riley M. Bovc  Confidential  
 
Version #:  Version Date:  Page 17 of 43 
Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015  manner. EDSS is a widely used and accepted instrument to evaluate disability status at a given 
time and longitudinally, to as sess disability progression in clinical studies in MS.  
Disability progression based on the EDSS is defined as an increase from baseline of 1 point (in 
patients with a baseline EDSS score of 3.0 to 5.0 inclusive) or of 0.5 point (in patients with a 
baseline  EDSS score of 5.5 to 6.5 inclusive). To confirm that the progression is sustained, this 
increase should, at a minimum, be present at a visit at least 3 months later (for 3 -month confirmed 
disability progression) with any intervening EDSS values also meeti ng the criteria for change.  
Analysis of disability progression based on the EDSS  score will include variables such as:  
• Time to 3 -month confirmed disability progression  
• Proportion of patients free of a 3 -month confirmed disability progression  
5.2.2  Magneti c Resonance Imaging (MRI)  
All patients will undergo MRI scanning of the brain according to the schedule in Appendix -1. 
MRI evaluation will include, but is not limited to:  
Sequences:  
• Magnetization Transfer Ratio (5 minutes)  
• Radial diffusi vity on Diffusion T ensor Imaging (9 minutes)  
• T1, FLAIR (10 minutes)  
• 3D T2 star (10 minutes)  
• Number of new/ enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions  
• Total volume of T2 lesions  
• Volume of T 1 hypointense lesions  
• Change in brain volume  
All images will be obtained on a Siemens Skyra 3T MRI in th e Sandler Neurosciences Building . 
All scans will be performed by a trained MRI technician using protocols previously defined within 
the lab (specific MR settings to be defined elsewhere).  
Each MRI scan performed for the study, both scheduled and unscheduled (e.g. ordered by [CONTACT_846115]), will be reviewed by a neuroradiologist and the 
primary treating physician must be contact[CONTACT_560182]  (not consistent with 
optic neuritis) detected on the MRI scan for safety actions and Adverse Event reporting.  
During the study each scan performed, both scheduled and unscheduled, will be assessed by [CONTACT_846116].  Upon acquisition the MRI will be evaluated 
for quality, completeness, and adherence to the manual. Confirmation of MRI quality or a 
description of the quality problems, if detected, will be communicated to the investigators. If scan 
is incomplete or incorr ectly performed, the study center will be asked to repeat it as soon as 
possible. After completion of the quality check, all scans will be analyzed according to a 
standardized procedure.  
Scanning:  
All sequences will be performed according to lab specificat ions.  
MRI scans will include MTR, Diffusion tensor imaging, myelin water fraction, T1 -weighted 
images, T2 -weighted, Proton Density -weighted and FLAIR  images.

5.2.3  Cognition  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT)  
The SDMT will be assessed acco rding to the schedule in Appendix -1 (study coordinator to 
administer). The SDMT is a sensitive and specific test to assess processing speed and working 
memory which are typi[INVESTIGATOR_846094]. During the 
administrati on of the SDMT, only the examiner and the patient should be in the testing room. The 
examiner can be the study coordinator, independent EDSS rater or a qualified individual not 
involved in the treatment of the patients who has been instructed in the approp riate administration 
of the test. Patients are presented with a test instrument at the top of which there is a row of nine 
numbers paired with unique symbols. Below this part of the test instrument is an array of symbols 
paired with empty spaces, the patie nt’s task is to match the number for each symbol as quickly as 
possible.  The test takes approximately [ADDRESS_1176125] answers in 90 seconds.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Additional cognitive tests  
Each s tudy participant will complete approximately 10 -15 minutes of cognitive testing as part of 
three separate  study visits (baseline visit, 3 -month visit, 6 -month visit). The cognitive measures 
will be administered by a trained study research assistant  at the UCSF Multiple Sclerosis Center. 
In addition to the SDMT, participants will complete the [LOCATION_004] Verbal Learning Test -II 
(CVLT -II), an assessment of verbal learning and memory with robust normative data in both 
healthy and MS populations. This task invol ves the immediate recall of a list of [ADDRESS_1176126] / Low Contr ast Visual Acuity (LCVA)  
Visual acuity will be assessed acco rding to the schedule in Appendix -1. Disturbances in visual 
function are common in patients with optic neuritis but these impairments are often not  readily 
apparent on commonly used high -contrast acuity tests. The use of low -contrast visual acuity charts 
has therefore gained validity in the assessment of visual acuity  in patients with optic neuritis. Low 
contrast Sloan letter charts provide a practical, quantitative, and standardized assessment of visual 
function. Each chart consists of rows of gray letters, decreasing in size from the top to the bottom 
row, on a white  background. A complete set consists of [ADDRESS_1176127] ranging from 100% (normal vision chart) to 0.6%. For this study only two charts will be 
used, the 100%  (normal vision chart) and 2.5% contrast charts.  
When these charts are being rated it is important that standardized conditions are used (e.g. 
distance from the chart, lighting conditions). For high contrast testing, participants will be seated [ADDRESS_1176128] them. If they do not, they will 
be provid ed with a pair of trial lenses.

administration. The administrator will ask the participant to begin at the top line of the chart, 
reading each line complete ly and down as many lines as possible. When the  
participant finishes reading the chart, they will be prompted by [CONTACT_846117]: “Please give 
the next line your best attempt. ” The tester may continue to encourage the participant following the 
successf ul (greater than or equal to 4/[ADDRESS_1176130]) completion of each line until the participant 
can read no further.  
 
5.2.5  Optical Coherence Tomogr aphy (OCT)  
OCT will be assessed according to the schedule in  Appendix -1. Optical Coherence  Tomography 
(OCT)  is a noninvasive, noncontact, trans -pupi[INVESTIGATOR_846095] -section images of the retina (axial resolution of 3 - 5 
microns). Cross -sectional images of the retina are produced usin g the optical backscattering of 
light in a fashion analogous to B -scan ultrasonography.  Whereas ultrasound produces images from 
backscattered sound "echoes," OCT uses infrared light waves that reflect off the internal 
microstructure within the biological  tissues. The frequencies and bandwidths of infrared light are 
orders of magnitude higher than medical ultrasound signals -- resulting in greatly increased image 
resolution  approximately 8 -25 times greater than any existing modality. In addition, the anatomi c 
layers within the retina can be differentiated and retinal thickness can be measured.  
Infrared light is delivered to the imaging site through a single optical fiber only .006" diameter 
(about the size of the period in this sentence). The imaging guide wi re contains a complete lens 
assembly to perform a variety of imaging functions. Guide wire can be deployed independently or 
integrated into existing therapeutic or imaging catheters.  
While standard electronic techniques are adequate for processing ultrason ic echoes that travel at 
the speed of sound, interferometric techniques are required to extract the  reflected optical signals 
from the infrared light used in OCT. The output, measured by [CONTACT_846118], is computer 
processed to produce high -resolution, real time, cross sectional or [ADDRESS_1176131]  instrument. 
Scanning protocols will include peripapi[INVESTIGATOR_1396] B scan and 19 B scan Macular raster scan with target 
ART of 100 and 50 respectively. Quality targets will be 25 for al l studies and only studies with Q> 
20 will be analyzed.  
 
5.2.6  Health Status Q uestionnair e (SF -36) 
 
For this study, a Health Status Questionnaire will be administered to patients at the three time-
points indicated in Appendix -1. The questionnaire falls und er the comprehensive Multiple 
Sclerosis Quality of Life Inventory (MSQLI), which was developed by [CONTACT_846119] a comprehensive outcomes 
assessment battery (Fisher et al, 1999), and i t will allow us to monitor the participants ’ quality of 
life with regard to their health.  
The Short Form -36 (SF -36) was derived from the General Health Survey of the Medical 
Outcomes Study in 1988. As cited by [CONTACT_846120], it is one of the most widely 
used generic measures of health -related quality of life and ha s been shown to discriminate between

Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015  subjects with different chronic conditions and between subjects with different severity levels of 
the same disease. The SF -36 has also demons trated sensitivity to significant treatment effects in a 
variety of patient populations.  
This tool addresses health issues that are relevant to MS  patients from the patient's perspective. 
The SF -[ADDRESS_1176132] be reported on the relevant

informed consent and being randomized meets the definition of an Adverse Event and must be 
recorded on the Adverse Even t case report form through UCS F’s clinical database, REDCap.  
5.3.2 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include height, sitting pulse rate, sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressure and 
body temperature which will be assessed at the visits indicated in Appendix -1. 
Clinically notified vital signs are defined in Appendix 1.

Height will be assessed at the screening  visit in centimeters/ inches.  
Weight will be assessed in kilograms at the visits indicated in Appendix -1.

5.3.6 Other Assessments  
MS is associated with a variable combination of symptoms, including sensory loss, imbalance, 
mobility loss, bladder and bowel dysfunction, cognitive dysfunction, spasticity, pain, and sexual 
dysfunction. Measurements of these wide -ranging  effects of MS  on the lives of patients  is beyond 
the scope  of the  clinician -reported endpoints  commonly used to evaluate therapeutic effe ctiveness 
in MS  studies. Patient -reported outcome (PRO) measures provide an empi[INVESTIGATOR_846096] s perspective of the benefits of treatment that cannot be gained from Magnetic 
Resonance Imaging (MRI), Expanded Disability Status  Score  (EDSS ), or Optical Coherence  
Tomography (OCT).   
5.3.7 Adverse  Event Reporting  Plan  
This study is investigator -sponsored and does  not involve  any outside  sponsoring institution to 
which adverse events should be reported. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) or unanticipated adverse 
events, therefore, will be reported internally to the UC  San Francisco Committee on Human 
Research within 10 working days of the event s occurrence according  to requirements  outlined  in 
the CHR’s reporting  guidelines.  
All adverse even ts during this study will be recorded in real time in UCSF ’s HIPAA approved 
clinical database, REDCap.  Recording such events in the same database each paten ’s trial -based 
visit records will allow for more efficient tracking and monitoring of all adverse e vents within the 
study.   
In addition, an inventory of adverse events will be obtained at each visit.

memory which are typi[INVESTIGATOR_846094]. During the 
administration of th e SDMT, only the examiner and the patient should be in the testing room. The 
examiner can be the study coordinator, independent EDSS Rater or a qualified individual not 
involved in the treatment of the patients who has been instructed in the appropriate ad ministration 
of the test. Patients are presented with a test instrument at the top of which there is a row of nine 
numbers paired with unique symbols. Below this part of the test instrument is an array of symbols 
paired with empty spaces, the patient ’s tas k is to ver bally match the number for each symbol as

The LCVA will be assessed acco rding to the schedule in Appendix -1. Disturbances in visual 
function are common in patients with MS but these impairments are often not readily apparent on 
commonly used high - contrast acuity tests. The use of low -contrast visual acuity charts have 
therefore gained validity in the assessment of visual acuity in patients with MS. Low contrast 
Sloan letter charts provide a practical, quantitative, and standardized assessment of visual 
function. Each chart consists of rows of gray let ters, decreasing in size from the top to the bottom 
row, on a white background. A complete set consists of [ADDRESS_1176148] ranging from 100% (normal vision chart) to 0.6%. For this study only two charts will be 
used, the 1 00% (normal vision chart) and 2.5% contrast charts. When these charts are being rated 
it is important that standardized conditions are used (e.g. distance from the chart, lighting 
conditions). Letter scores indicate the number of letters identified correct ly, each chart is scored

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)  
A baseline MRI scan of the central nervous system (CNS) will be obtained. Both T1 and T2 -
weighted images will be obtained.  
The following parameters will be assessed using these MRI data:  
• Myelin water fraction  
• Magnetization Transfer Ratio  
• Radial diffusivity on Diffusion Tensor Imaging  
• Number of new/enl arging T2 hyperintense lesions  
• Total volume of T2 lesions,  
• Volume of un -enhancing T1 hypointense lesions,  
• Change in brain volume  
All images will be obtained on the NIC MS Scanner in the Sand ler Neurosciences Building. All 
scans will be performed by a trained MRI technician using protocols previously defined within the 
lab (specific MR settings to be defined elsewhere). Each MRI scan performed for the study, both 
scheduled and unscheduled (e.g . ordered by [CONTACT_846126]), 
will be reviewed by a neuroradiologist. The Primary Treating Physician must be contact[CONTACT_846127] (not consistent with MS) detected on the MRI scan for safety action s and 
Adverse Event reporting. During the study each scan performed, both scheduled and unscheduled,

the MRI will be evaluated for quality, completeness, and adher ence to the manual. Confirmation 
of MRI quality or a description of the quality problems, if detected, will be communicated to the 
investigators. If scan is incomplete or incorrectly performed, the study center will be asked to 
repeat it as soon as possibl e. After completion of the quality check, all scans will be analyzed 
according to a standardized procedure.  
For the MRI exam, each participant will be asked a number of questions concerning his or health, 
lack of metal implants and absence of claustrophobi a. They will be asked to lie down on a narrow 
bed that will then be moved into a tunnel that is [ADDRESS_1176150] igator will examine the volunteer's

11 ADVERSE EXPERIENCE R EPORTING AND DOCUMEN TATION  
11.1 Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation of a 
patient administered a pharmaceutical product and that  does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the treatment.  An AE is therefore any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated 
with the administration of an investigational product, whether or not related to that 
investigational product.  An unexpected AE is one of a type not identified in nature, 
Riley M. Bovc  Confidential  
 
Version #:  Version Date:  Page 32 of 43 
Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015  severity, or frequency in the current Brochure or of greater severity or frequency than 
expected based on the information in the I nvestigator’s Brochure.  
The Investigator will probe, via discussion with the subject, for the occurrence of AEs 
during each subject visit and record the information in the site’s source documents.  
Adverse events will be recorded in the patient CRF.  Adver se events will be described by 
[CONTACT_24109] (start and stop dates and times), severity, outcome, treatment and relation to 
study drug, or if unrelated, the cause.  
AE Severity  
The National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE ) Version 3.0 should be used to assess and grade AE severity, including 
laboratory abnormalities judged to be clinically significant. The modified criteria can be 
found in the study manual.  If the experience is not covered in the modified criteria, the 
guidelines shown in Table 1 below should be used to grade severity.  It should be pointed 
out that the term “severe” is a measure of intensity and that a  severe AE is not necessarily 
serious.  
Table 1.  AE Severity Grading  
Severity (Toxicity Grade)  Description  
Mild (1)  Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention or therapy required. The subject may be aware of the sign 
or symptom but tolerates it reasonably well.  
Moderate (2)  Mild to moderate limitation in activity, no or minimal medical 
intervention/therapy required.  
Severe (3)  Marked limitation in activity, medical intervention/therapy required, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29125].  
Life-threatening (4)  The subject is at risk of death due to the adverse experience as it 
occurred. This does not refer to an experience that hypothetically 
might have caused death if it were more s evere.  
 
AE Relationship to Study Drug  
The relationship of an AE to the study drug should be assessed using the following the 
guidelines in Table 2. 
Table 2.  AE Relationship to Study Drug  
Relationship  
to Drug  Comment  
Definitely  Previously known toxicity of agent; or an event that follows a reasonable temporal 
sequence from administration of the drug; that follows a known or expected response 
pattern to the suspected drug; that is confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_41833]; and that is not explained by [CONTACT_41846].  
Riley M. Bovc  Confidential  
 
Version #:  Version Date:  Page 33 of 43 
Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015  Probably  An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administrat ion of the 
drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected drug; that is 
confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_11125]; and that is unlikely to be 
explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s clinical state or  by [CONTACT_41847].  
Possibly  An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to that suspected drug; but 
that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors.  
Unrelated  An event that can be determined with certainty to have no relationship to the study 
drug.  
11.2 Serious Adverse Experiences (SAE)  
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
• death  
• a life-threatening adverse experience  
• inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Other important medical events may also be considered an SAE when , based on 
appropriate medical judgment, they jeopardize the subject or require intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed.  
 
11.2.1  Serious Adverse Experience Reporting  
Study sites will document all SAEs that occur (whether or not related to study drug) per UCSF 
CHR Guidelines  and those outlined in 21CFR312.[ADDRESS_1176156] 
been completed.  
This study is investigator -sponsored and does not involve any outside sponsoring institution to 
which adverse events shoul d be reported. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) or unanticipated adverse 
events, therefore, will be reported to the FDA CDER (Center of Drug Evaluation and Research), 
as well as internally to the UC San Francisco Committee on Human Research  (CHR),  within 
respective reporting guidelines.  
Unexpected fatal or life -threatening suspected adverse reactions will be reported to the CDER no 
later than 7 calendar days after initial receipt of the information . UCSF CHR will be notified 
within 10 working days of the even t’s occurrence.  
Per 21 CFM 312.32(c)(1), any (1) serious, unexpected suspected adverse reactions, (2) findings 
from other clinical, animal, or in -vitro studies that suggest significant human risk, and (3) a 
clinically important increase in the rate of a se rious suspected adverse reaction will be reported to 
the CDER no later than 15 calendar days after determining that the information qualifies for 
reporting .

14 DATA SAFETY MONITORI NG  
Safety Data Monitoring throughout the trial: Since this trial is a single -site trial and the overseeing 
Principle Investigator  will be present throughout the trial, a Data and Safety Monitoring Board is 
not deemed necessary. The study investigator will be responsible for monitoring safety data and 
adverse events recorded in the patient file and will be responsible for reporting s uch events to the 
FDA and IRB.  
Safety assessments will be throughout patient visits to ensure patient welfare and safety in daily 
activities.  
Such assessments will include:  
- Physical Examination  
- Vital Signs   
- Height and Weight measurements  
- Pregnancy and Assessments of Fertility  
- Ophthalmologic Examination  
Riley M. Bovc  Confidential

The Investigator will meet with the study staff biweekly to review safety as well as efficacy data 
collected from patient visits and assess the safety of the visits and study outcomes.  
 
Patient withdrawal from the study / Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]:  
Study treatment must be discontinued for any patient if the investigator determines that continuing 
would result in a significant risk for that patient. The following conditions/events may be 
considered su fficient to support a decision about the study drug discontinuation in individual 
cases:  
- Adverse event/serious adverse event   
- Abnormal laboratory value(s) or abnormal test result(s)   
- Withdrawal of informed co nsent  
- Pregnancy   
- Use of prohibited other inves tigational medications   
- Deviations from the prescribed dose regimen for the study drug  
-  Any other protocol deviation that results in a significant risk to the patient ’s sa fety  
 
Discontinuation of the study drug must be recorded along with the patient information in 
REDCap, giving the date and primary and secondary reasons for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_262].  
The investigator must also contact [CONTACT_846133] (University of 
[LOCATION_004] at San Francisco Multiple Sclerosis Center) to register the patient ’s discontinuation of 
randomized study drug.  
Patients may voluntarily withdraw from the study for any reason at any time. They may be 
considered withdrawn i f they state an intention to withdraw, fail to return for visits, or become lost 
to follow -up for any other reason.  
For patients who are lost to follow -up (i.e. those patients whose status is unclear because they fail 
to appear for study visits without st ating an intention to withdraw), the investigator should show 
"due diligence" by [CONTACT_268295], e.g. 
dates of telephone calls, registered letters, etc.  
If premature withdrawal occurs for any reason,  the investigator must make every effort to 
determine the primary reason for a patient ’s premature withdrawal from the study and record this 
information with the patient ’s research data in REDCap as well as rep ort this withdrawal to the 
Institutional Revie w Board  and FDA CDER,  if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_942].  
Patients will be considered to have completed the study if they attend all protocol specified visits 
and complete all assessments. A patient who discontinues the study medication for any reason, 
including an adverse event must complete a Safety Follow -Up visit. Any patient still in sc reening 
at the time [ADDRESS_1176161] refer  them for appropriate ongoing care.  
The study can be terminated at any time for any reason by [CONTACT_093]. Should this be 
necessary, each patient should be seen as soon as possible and treated as described for a 
prematurely withdrawn patient. The inv estigator may be informed of additional procedures to be 
followed in order to ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patient ’s 
interests. The investigator will be responsible for informing the Committee on Human Research of

** **In rare cases during the initial visit, the patient may be asked to undergo an electroretinogram. This test 
measures the electrical response of the eye ’s light -sensitive cells, called rods and cones. These cells are part 
of the retina (the back part of the eye). This test is used to detect disorders of the retina. For this study, this 
option exists only to be used in cases where more information is needed  to confirm a diagnosis of optic 
neuritis. The test is performed by [CONTACT_846138] ’s eyes, so that  there is no discomfort. 
Then, the patient ’s eyes are held open with a small device called a retractor. An electrical sensor (electrode)  
is placed on each eye and the electrical activity of the retina is recorded in  response to light. The primary 
risk associated with the study is a temporary scratch of the surface of the cornea due to the electrode. 
Otherwise, there are no risks associated  with this procedure.

 The aim of this study is to assess the analgesic efficacy of intravenous ibuprofen given in 
the emergency department (ED) for the treatment of biliary colic.  It is estimated over [ADDRESS_118874] gallbladder disease, with bilia ry colic being a common and painful 
symptom in these patients.  Likely due to the relatively recent approval of intravenous ibuprofen 
use for fever and pain in adults, no assessment of its analgesic efficacy for biliary colic currently 
exists in the litera ture.  
 
 Utilizing a visual analog scale (VAS) for patient self -assessment of pain, this study will 
address this lack of evidence and identify intravenous ibuprofen’s value as a novel analgesic in 
administration, at [ADDRESS_118875] -administration, and 30 -minute 
intervals in the second hour.  Though NSAID’s have been extensively studied in the management 
of this phenomenon, this study aims to help optimize pain treatment of patients presenting to 
the ED with biliary colic, and p otentially pave the way for future analgesic treatment comparison 
studies.  
 
2. RESEARCH QUESTION  
 
 The aim of this study is to assess the analgesic efficacy of intravenous ibuprofen given in 
the ED for the treatment of biliary colic.  We hypothesize that intr avenous ibuprofen will provide 
a clinically significant drop in self -reported patient pain levels as measured by [CONTACT_8298].  
 
3. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE  
 
Biliary colic  
 
 It is estimated that over [ADDRESS_118876] gallbladder disease 
(gallstones o r cholecystectomy) in the [LOCATION_002]. 1 Biliary colic (BC) is a common symptom of 
gallstone disease, and it thought to originate from an outflow tract obstruction, resulting in 
visceral and somatic pain due to muscular spasm of the gallbladder wall.[ADDRESS_118877] for 2 -3+ hours.  In several studies BC has been shown to develop in approximately 25 -
30% of cholelithiasis patients over a 10 -year per iod.3 Often presenting to the ED, patients with 
BC frequently require rapid administration of analgesics.  
 
 Treatment options include non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], 
with NSAIDs having several potential advantages over the latter .  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_107046], produce respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], sedation, and can interfere with hepatobiliary 
scintigraphy (HIDA).[ADDRESS_118878] been extensively studied in the 
treatment of biliary colic, with a numbe r of analgesics proving effective in treating moderate to 
severe pain. 4-5 This study will continue the trend of assessing the analgesic effectiveness of 
NSAIDs by [CONTACT_107051].  
   
4                                                                              5/5/2014  
 Intravenous ibuprofen  
 
 In 2009, the US FDA approved intravenous ibuprofen (Caldolor®) for the management of 
mild to moderate pain, moderate to severe pain as an adjunct to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467], and 
treatment of fever in adults.6 Intravenous ibuprofen is only the second approved int ravenous 
NSAID available in the US, the other being ketorolac.  As with other NSAIDs, ibuprofen’s 
analgesic, anti -inflammatory, and antipyretic activity is thought to be achieved through direct 
binding and inhibition of cyclo -oxygenase (COX) ensymes.[ADDRESS_118879] also shown intravenous ibuprofen to resolve 
fever to a significantly greater extent than placebo.11-13 
 
 Intravenous ibuprofen represents an exciting and largely unexplored tool i n pain 
management; its analgesic effectiveness in acute or postoperative settings is currently being 
investigated in a number of ongoing clinical trials.  As a newly available intravenous NSAID, its 
application in biliary colic has likewise been unexplored .  Compared to orally administered 
ibuprofen, the expected increase in maximum plasma concentrations (C max) as well as faster 
time to reach these  concentrations (t max), the elimination of variability in efficacy due to variable 
absorption of oral ibuprofen  by [CONTACT_107052], and the potentially more reliable time 
of onset of analgesia, have all been noted as potential benefits of intravenous ibuprofen over 
the oral form.7 This is especially applicable to biliary colic patients presenting in the ED, where 
the reliability and speed of intravenous NSAID analgesia can present an alternative to oral or 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_107047].  
 
Rationale  
 
 Likely due to the relatively recent approval of intravenous ibuprofen use for fever and 
pain in adults, no assessment of its analgesic efficacy for biliary colic currently exists in the 
literature.  Utilizing the VAS for pain, this study will address this lack of evidence and identify 
intravenous ibuprofen’s value as a novel analgesic in the treatment of biliar y colic.  Though 
NSAID’s have been extensively studied in the management of this phenomenon, this study aims 
to help optimize pain treatment of biliary colic patients in the ED, and pave the way for future 
treatment comparison studies.  
5                                                                              5/5/[ADDRESS_118880] hour following study therapy administration, and every 30 minutes in the second hour.  On the 
condition that the patient has not left the ED following two hours, a VAS will be taken every hour 
until discharge or transfe r. 
 
4.3 Study Population  
 
 Adults aged 18 -55 presenting to the Maricopa Integrated Health System (MIHS) ED with 
right upper quadrant and epi[INVESTIGATOR_107048].  Enrolled patients includ ed in the study analysis group will have 
radiographic evidence or history of gallstones, with patients diagnosed with other conditions 
being excluded.

investigators  
 
4.5 Study Procedures  
 
  Upon patient presentation with signs and symptoms of biliary colic, a MIHS ED nurse 
will triage with an initial VAS.  For initial temporary pain relief preceding study enrollment, 4mg 
of morphine will be administered.  Following obtaining consent to enroll in the study, a second 
VAS will be taken while the MIHS ED pharmacy randomizes study therapy -immedia tely 
preceding drug administration (time zero).  Patient will be randomized to a placebo group or an 
ibuprofen intravenous 800mg group.  The intravenous ibuprofen will be mixed with 250cc or 
normal saline, with an additional [ADDRESS_118881] hour, and every 30 minutes in the second hour.  On 
the condition that the patient has not left the ED  following 2 hours, a VAS will be taken every 
hour until discharge or transfer.  Patient may receive rescue doses of morphine at the discretion 
of the treating provider.  Patients will not be followed after discharge or transfer.  Additionally, 
the safety of a five -minute infusion of intravenous ibuprofen will be assess through any adverse 
drug events (ADEs) being noted simultaneously with every VAS administration.  ADE symptoms 
monitored will include nausea, vomiting, skin rash, headache, dizziness, hemorr hage, and 
hypotension.  Vital signs (temperature, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1520], and blood pressure) will also be 
assessed at the time of every VAS administration.  
 
4.6 Result Interpretation and Statistical Analysis  
 
 Analgesic efficacy will be assessed through the  use of VAS scores.  A VAS score decrease 
of 33% in relation to the VAS taken at the time of therapy drug administration (time zero) will be 
considered a clinically important different in patient -perceived pain.[ADDRESS_118882] hoc two -tailed, independent -samples t-tests and pairwise t-tests (with Bonferroni 
correction) to examine the effect of intravenous ibuprofen on patients’ self -reported pain 
scores.  The between -subjects factor will be Group (control vs. treatment), and the within -
subjects factor will be Time (measured at four [ADDRESS_118883] interval and 
two half -hour intervals during the second hour). We will need a total sample size of 36 (18 i n 
each group) to provide the 80% power to detect a change of at least 33% in average pain scores 
at a given time point between the groups ( d=0.96) and between any two time points within each 
group ( dz=0.70).  These estimates assume an alpha level of 0.05.15 All results, from both 
descriptive and inferential analysis, will be presented in table and/or graphical format.

headache, dizziness, hemorrhage, and hypotension. Pain control and potential adverse drug 
effects will be monitored through the use of the VAS and pain assessment forms, respectively.  
Vital signs, inclu ding temperature, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1520], and blood pressure will also be taken 
at every VAS administration.  An ethical issue taken into considerations is the pain potentially 
experienced by [CONTACT_107053].  As mentioned previously rescu e opi[INVESTIGATOR_107049] a patient’s pain in not well 
controlled.  
 
 
5. OBJECTIVE / DISCUSSION  
 
 The aim of this study is to assess the analgesic efficacy of intravenous ibuprofen given in 
the ED for the trea tment of biliary colic.  Currently no assessment of intravenous ibuprofen’s 
analgesic efficacy in patients with biliary colic exists in the literature, likely due to its recent 
approval for use in fever and pain in adults.  This study will address this lac k of evidence and 
identify intravenous ibuprofen’s value as a novel analgesic in the treatment  of biliary colic.  Prior 
to intravenous ibuprofen, the only other approved intravenous NSAID available in the United 
States has been intravenous ketorolac.  As s uch, intravenous ketorolac has been a staple of 
biliary colic treatment.  This study aims to help optimized pain treatment of biliary colic patients 
in the ED by [CONTACT_107054].  If intravenous ibuprofen is indeed 
shown to be effective this study seeks to pave the way for future treatment comparison studies.  
Additionally, intravenous analgesia provides an added benefit in patients who present with 
nausea and vomiting where oral medications may otherwise prove ineffective.  
 
6. RESOURCES  
 
 All work for this study will be conducted at the Maricopa Integrated Health System 
(MIHS) ED under the guidance of [CONTACT_107056].  The Maricopa Medical Center (MMC) is located 
in Maricopa County, Arizona, and features advanced medical services i ncluding adult emergency 
care.  The MMC houses a level I Trauma Center and Emergency Center, with approximately 
50,[ADDRESS_118885] access to an 
MIHS biostatistician —Andrē  Valdez, PhD., who will be performing statistical analyses for the 
study.

 7. DISCONTINUATION / WITHDRAWAL CRITERIA  
 
 The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_107050] a subject from the study 
at any time they feel it is in the subject’s best interest, or for any other reason.  All subjects may 
voluntarily withdraw their participation in the study at any time without any change in further 
treatment.  
 
8. ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
 All NSAIDs —including IV ibuprofen —carry a similar side effect profile, includi ng nausea, 
vomiting, skin rash, headache, dizziness, hemorrhage, and hypotension. Pain control and 
potential adverse drug effects will be monitored through the use of the VAS and pain 
assessment forms, respectively.  Vital signs, including temperature, hea rt rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1520], and 
blood pressure will also be taken at every VAS administration.  Every patient will receive at least 
one dose of morphine, and further morphine may be administered at the discretion of the 
treating physician if a patient’s pain in  not well controlled.

BACKGROUND  
 
Cardiovascular  Effects  and  Biomarkers  
The CV system  is sensitive  to toxicants  in tobacco smoke —toxicants  that  may  also  be 
present  in e-cigarette and HNB aerosols.  From  1965- 2009,  smoking  caused  7.0 million  
deaths  from  CVD  compared  to 5.8 million  from  cancer  and 3.2 million  from  respi[INVESTIGATOR_596700] U.S. The relationship  between tobacco  smoke  exposure  and risk of CVD  
increases  sharply  for people  who  smoke  only  a few cigarettes  per day.  
An understanding  of how  cigarette smoking  causes  CVD  informs  our approach  to 
assessing  the potential  for e-cigarette and HNB  products  to cause  CVD.  Cigarette smoking  
produces  both  chronic  (accelerated  atherosclerosis)  and acute  (acute  myocardial  
infarction,  stroke,  sudden  death)  CVD,  with  overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_596701].  Mechanisms  are 
important to understand  as this guides  selection of biomarkers.  Mechanisms  of smoking - 
induced  CVD  include  oxidative  stress,  inflammation,  endothelial  damage and dysfunction,  
thrombogenesis,  hemodynamic  stress,  and arrhythmogenesis  (the  latter  two thought  to be 
mediated  by [CONTACT_596730]  (SNS)  stimulation)  (Figure 1). Studies  suggest  
that  e-cigarette use may  cause  vascular  injury,  oxidative stress,  decrease  in flow -mediated  
dilation,  and heart rate and blood  pressure  have  been  shown  to increase immediately  after  
e-cigarette use.  
Constituents  of smoke  of 
most  concern  for CVD  include  
reactive chemicals  (carbonyls  
such as acrolein),  nicotine,  
particles,  and carbon  monoxide.  
Acrolein  is of concern  because 
risk estimates  suggest  that it 
accounts  for a majority  of the 
total  non-cancer  risk of smoking,  
as much as 88.5%.  Exposure  to 
acrolein  is associated  with  
increased  CVD  risk,  even  in 
nonsmokers.  Nicotine  causes  
SNS  stimulation  exhibited  as 
increased  heart rate and 
catecholamine release  
(particularly  epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]),  and 
has effects  on vascular  function.  
SNS  stimulation may  contribute Figure  1 Summary  of mechanisms by [CONTACT_596731].  
to CV events  in people  with  pre-existing  CVD,  including  sudden  death  due to arrhythmia.  
SNS  stimulation also  contributes  to a more  atherogenic  lipid  profile  and insulin resistance  
and diabetes,  which  are important CVD  risk factors.  Depending  on device and use 
conditions,  e-cigarettes  produce  nanoparticles  consisting  of metals,  metal  oxides,  and other  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Suddendeath  
Short -Term  Cardiovascular  Effects  of E-Cigarettes:  Influence  of Device  Power  IRB#  17-[ADDRESS_788234]  long  linked  exposure  to particles  in ambient  air to 
increased  risk of CVD,  cancer,  and respi[INVESTIGATOR_96613].  
We propose  to measure  biomarkers  of exposure  to potential  CV toxicants  (acrolein,  
nicotine,  and CO).  We will also  measure  biomarkers  of relevant pathogenesis  mechanisms  
related  to acute  CVD  (oxidant injury,  inflammation,  platelet activation,  endothelial  
dysfunction  and SNS  stimulation;  SNS 
stimulation is measured  as increased  heart  
rate and blood  pressure  and urine  
catecholamines).  Specific  biomarkers  with  
citations  are summarized  in Table 3. 
These  biomarkers  were  selected  since   
they  have  been  shown  to change rapi[INVESTIGATOR_596702],  so we can assess short -term  
effects,  and are known  to be correlated  
with  CVD  risk.  Our studies  of different e- 
cigarette power  and HNB  products  will 
include  all of the biomarkers  presented  in 
Table  3. Since  e-liquid  pH is expected  to 
influence primarily  nicotine exposure  and 
pharmacokinetics,  the e-liquid  pH study  
will focus  on the effects  of nicotine  
exposure  and pharmacokinetics  on hemodynamic  parameters  and not on the other  CVD  
biomarkers.  
E-cigarette  Power  is related  to Nicotine  Delivery and  Toxicant  Generation  
E-cigarette electrical  power  (P), which  is a function  of battery  voltage  (V) and atomizer  
(coil)  resistance (R) (P = V2/R),  may  be one of the most  important determinants  of e- 
cigarette health  effects.  The heat  supplied  by [CONTACT_596732] e- 
liquid  is a product  of electrical  power  and length  of time electricity  is applied  to the 
atomizer.  The temperature  of the heating  e-liquid  influences  nicotine delivery,  the type  and 
amount of chemicals  generated  in the aerosol,  and possibly  aerosol  particle size.  In one 
study,  the average power  used  by [CONTACT_596733] 2nd generation (pen -shaped)  e-cigarettes  and 3rd 
generation (variable voltage or wattage)  e-cigarettes  ranged  from  [ADDRESS_788235]  similar  or higher  plasma  nicotine  levels  than  users  of 
less powerful  devices  who  use high  nicotine content e-liquids.  This  is indicative  of the large  
amounts  of aerosol  delivered  to users  of high -powered  e-cigarettes  and raises  concerns  
about  exposure  to toxicants  and contaminants  in e-liquids.  Further,  propylene  glycol (PG),  
vegetable  glycerin  (VG),  and flavorants  thermally  decompose  to chemicals  such as 
formaldehyde  and acrolein  and reactive  oxygen  species  in a temperature- dependent 
manner.  Elevated  biomarkers  of acrolein  exposure  have  not been  reported  in e-cigarette 
users.  This  is most  likely  because  studies  have  not characterized  acrolein  exposure  in users  
of high -powered  e-cigarettes.  Table  3: Cardiovascular  Risk Biomarkers

1 INTRODUCTION  AND  STUDY  DESIGN 
1.1 RESEARCH  QUESTION  
What  are the effects  of electronic  cigarette device power?  
 
1.2 SPECIFIC  AIMS  
1.2.1   Specific  Aim  #[ADDRESS_788236]  of e-cigarette  device power  on nicotine  
pharmacology, systemic  exposure to toxic volatile organic compounds  
(VOCs),  and  short -term  cardiovascular  effects.  
Hypothesis  1a: Systemic  nicotine  exposure  and subjective  measures of sensation  
in the throat,  reward,  and satisfaction  will increase  with  increasing  power. 
 
Hypothesis  1b: Mercapturic  acid  metabolites  of VOCs,  particularly  acrolein,  will 
increase  with  e-cigarette  power.  
 
Hypothesis  1c: CV effects  increase  with  higher  power,  and are manifested  as 
changes  in hemodynamic  parameters,  hormonal  release,  and biomarkers  of 
endothelial  function,  platelet  activation,  inflammation,  and oxidative  stress.  
2 STUDY  DESIGN 
2.1 DESIGN  SUMMARY  
This  is a single- site,  randomized,  crossover  study  of experienced  adult  e-cigarette

participant’s  status  based  on responses  in the case  report  forms.  The Project  
Short -Term  Cardiovascular  Effects  of E-Cigarettes:  Influence  of Device  Power  IRB#  17-[ADDRESS_788242] Manager  and CRC  will refer  to the Study  Physician or Principle  
Investigator  if the participant:  
• Currently  takes  any medications  on schedule  or as needed  
• Has current  or past  depression and/or  anxiety  disorders  
• Has any psychiatric  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_596706].  If none  of the above  
conditions  are present,  the CRC  and Project  Manager  will sign  off on Eligibility  
Checklist  without  Study  Physician review.  
The participant will be notified  of eligibility  via phone  or email  after  this review.  
 
 
2.3.4  Reassessment  of Eligibility  
Eligibility  may  need  to be reassessed  if the following  conditions  occur:  the 
orientation  visit  is out of window  (e.g.  [ADDRESS_788243]  from  screening  visit),  and/or  [ADDRESS_788244]  occurred  in a participant’s  current  medical  status  and 
smoking/vapi[INVESTIGATOR_119689],  the CRC  will review  some  eligibility  items.  This  will 
occur  if the participant  is more  than 30 days,  but less than  90 days  outside  of 
their  screening  visit  window.  The CRC  will ask the following  over the phone:  
• if there are any new  medications  
• if they  have  seen  a physician  for any medical/psychological  
reason  
• if they  are still using  their  e-cigarettes  as indicated  at the in-person  
screening  visit  
If any significant changes  have  occurred,  the CRC  and Project  Manager  will meet  
to discuss and complete  another  Eligibility  Checklist based  on current  
participant responses.

 2.4 IDs & Assignment  
 
2.4.1  Study  IDs 
Participants  who  are eligible for an in-person  screening  visit  will be assigned  a 
unique  Study  ID upon  consent to participate  in the study.  This  Study  ID will begin 
with  the “####”  to refer  to the CTSI -5B study  number,  which  is how  the study  is 
referred  to at the research  ward.  These  numbers  (to be determined  after  in-service  
meeting  with  CTSI -5B) will be followed  sequentially  starting  from  001.  For example,  
the first  participant  enrolled  will have  a Study  ID of ####001.  
The Screening  Visit  Log will keep  track  the REDCap  IDs, and Study  IDs (if 
consented).  
Password for TCORS -1 Participant Log: 7775enr  
2.4.2  Randomization  
Participants will be assigned to begin procedures starting with one of three possible 
power levels  using a Latin square design.  
 
1) 10 Watts  
OR 
2) 15 Watts  
OR 
3) 20 Watts  
 
 

Short -Term  Cardiovascular  Effects  of E-Cigarettes:  Influence  of Device  Power  IRB#  17-[ZIP_CODE]   
  
The participant will not be considered for assignment until it has been verified that 
he/she is eligible and th e Eligibility Checklist has been signed. The experimental 
design includes a counter -balanced randomized treatment order to complete 
replication with total sample sizes of 21  or 24 (complete Blocks of n= 3 ). At the 
orientation visit, the participant will be assigned their treatment sequence from the 
above randomization schedule. In cases where a block will be incomplete because a 
participant has dropped out or been lost to follow up, their orientation assignment can 
be reused.  
 
The final order assignment wil l take place at the orientation visit when the participant 
is physically present at the UCSF Tobacco Research Center. The CRC will refer to the 
“Assignment Tracking Log,” input the participant’s initials, product assignment, and 
date he/she is assigned to that condition. Assignment does not necessarily reflect the 
sequence of the participant’s consent in the study, but rather when he/she is booked 
for the start of orientation. That time course will vary based upon participant, CRC and 
CTSI availability.  
 
If a participant drops out or is lost to follow -up (LTFU) during the study, he/she will 
not be replaced. The assignment schedule will continue as assigned, and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_596707]- completers.  
 
2.5 PARTICIPANT  WITHDRAWAL  
 
2.5.1  Dropout  Definition  
If a participant  declares  he/she  is no longer  interested  in completing  the study,  
he/she  will be considered  a “dropout.” Once  given “dropout”  status,  the participant 
can no longer  contribute  to the study. 
2.5.2  Dropout  Compensation  
If participant  decides  to stop  participating  in the study  prior to starting  the inpatient 
portion  of the study,  he/she  will only  receive  compensation for the Screening  Visit 
($30)  and no compensation  will be given for the inpatient  portion.  
If a participant  decides  to drop  out during  the inpatient  study,  compensation will be 
pro-rated  for completed  visits.  
2.5.[ADDRESS_788245] to  Follow -Up 
If a participant  is unable to be contact[CONTACT_596740],  he/she  will be considered  “lost  to follow -up” (LTFU).  
If a participant is considered  LTFU,  every  effort  will be made  to contact  [CONTACT_12552]/her.  
2.5.3.a  Contact  [CONTACT_596741],  a letter  of intent  to 
contact  [CONTACT_596742]’s  home  address.  This  letter  will inform  
the participant  that  they  will be formally  withdrawn  from  the study  by [CONTACT_596743] [ADDRESS_788246]  passed  
Short -Term  Cardiovascular  Effects  of E-Cigarettes:  Influence  of Device  Power  IRB#  17-[ADDRESS_788247] communication,  he/she  will be considered  “lost  to follow -up”.  No 
further  outreach  will be conducted.  Once  given  “LTFU”  status,  the participant  
can no longer  contribute  to the study. 
2.5.3.b  Returning  to Visit  Procedures  
If a formerly  lost participant  returns,  before  starting  the inpatient  portion  of the 
study,  the reassessment  of eligibility  steps  outlined  in Section 2.3.4  of this 
manual  will be followed.  If the participant  is LTFU  during  some  point  in his/her  
inpatient  portion,  there  will not be the option to repeat  this.

If preliminarily eligible based on the REDCap report , contact [CONTACT_596750]:  
Study Team: “ Good afternoon, may I please speak with [name]?”  
If the person is not available: leave a voicemail or thank the person who answered and say 
goodbye.  
If the per son is available: First confirm that you are speaking to the correct person.  
Study Team:  “This is [name] calling from the UCSF Tobacco Research Center. I am a 
coordinator working with [CONTACT_60174]’s research group. 
Is this an Ok time for you to speak?”  
If the person says “No” or “I’m not sure”  
Study Team: “ Okay. [Ask if you can schedule another time to talk. If the person is not sure or 
seems hesitant, thank him/her and say goodbye.]”  
If the person says “Yes”  
Study Team: “ Great. I wanted to talk with you about a study researching the effects of the battery 
power in e -cigarettes. You may remember you filled out a questionnaire online to be considered for 
this study. You indicated that you were interested in learning more.”  
If the person says “No” or “I’m not sure”  
Study Team: “ No problem. I just wanted to make sure you had the opportunity to learn about any 
study we have at the UCSF Tobacco Research Center. Thank you for your time.”  
If the person says “Yes”  
Study Team: “ We are conducting this research study to look at the effects of battery power in e -
cigarettes. We want to know more about how vapi[INVESTIGATOR_596713], medium, and high power levels 
changes how the body is exposed to nicotine and what effects the e -cigarette has on the heart. Just 
so you know in advance, if you choose to participate in the study, it will take place at San 
Francisco General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_596714] “arms, which include two consecutive hospi[INVESTIGATOR_596715] “arm” , you will be using e -cigarette products that we will provide and filling out 
questionnaires. There will be blood draws, we will be measuring your blood pressure and heart 
rate, as well as collecting urine samples. You will also be provided with meals during your stay, 
and the research rooms at SF General have free Wi -Fi and TVs with cable. Do you have any 
questions so far?  
If you are still interested, the first step is for me to ask you some questions to see if you are a good 
match for the study. This can take about [ADDRESS_788251] the time right now to speak with 
me? Do I have your consent to ask these questions?”  
Update the Eligibility Checklist as you ask the questions.  
Study Team : (If no)  “Okay, well it seems like this study may not be the best fit for you, which is 
totally fine. Would you like us to keep your name [CONTACT_596755]?”  
(If yes, continue)  
Study Team:  “Okay, so we reviewed the purpose and procedures of this study. I’d like to let you 
know that research is 100% voluntary and you can choose at any time to not participate.”  
“I’d like to review s ome risks with you:  
Venipuncture and catheterization:  A catheter (small plastic tube) will be placed in a vein in one 
forearm in order to make it easier to take the multiple blood samples. The catheter will remain in 
Short -Term  Cardiovascular  Effects  of E-Cigarettes:  Influence  of Device  Power  IRB#  17-[ADDRESS_788252] for about 10 hours. There is a sm all risk of pain, swelling, bruising, or infections at the blood 
draw site. 
Blood Loss:  You will lose a total of about 1 cup of blood during the entire study. This amount of 
blood loss poses no risk to healthy individuals. 
The Study Procedures  may be inconvenient and tedious (filling out forms, spending time in the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], providing specimens, etc.)  
You may also feel uncomfortable when getting your blood pressure  taken depending on the 
tightness of the cuff.  
During abstinence, you may feel uncomfortable, irritable, and restless or have difficulty 
concentrating  due to possible nicotine withdrawal. This may result in headaches, nausea, fatigue, 
or changes in mood.  
Although long- term effects are uncertain, the use of  e-cigarettes  could increase dependence on e -
cigarettes as well as pose threats to the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems; exposure to e -
cigarette aerosols  can increase risks of cancer and adverse reproductive outcomes.  
Survey Questionnaires:  You will be asked to answer personal  and private quest ions during this 
study, including questions  about your medical history, drug and alcohol use, breath sample 
measurements, urine tests of drug and pregnancy, and questionnaires about your mood. 
Answering these personal questions could make you feel uncomfor table.  
And finally, we will be collecting personal information from you, so there is a risk of break of 
confidentiality. However, we will do our best to keep your confidentiality. 
Can I answer any questions about risks? 
Okay, let’s talk about the benefits. There are no direct benefits to you, but you will be helpi[INVESTIGATOR_596716], medium, and high power levels changes how the body is exposed to 
nicotine and what effects the e -cigarette has on the heart. Which has great potential benefits to 
other vapers like you. We will also be reimbursing you for your time and effort – if you complete 
all parts of the study, you will be paid for each study visit and be given a completion bonus. If you 
complete all parts of the study, you’ll get up to $1,[ADDRESS_788253]? (If yes, answer) (If no, proceed)  
Okay, can I ask you a few questions? 
Do you remember – how long does this study last? (6 total outpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_596717]. 8 
days total  including Screening Visit and Orientation ) 
Do you remember – how many days will you be expected to stay at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]? (6 days 
total; 2 consecutive outpatient days per Study Arm ) 
What are some risks y ou may experience? (Discomfort, bruising, mood changes, breach of 
confidentiality)  
 
Do you think you are interested in seeing if you are a match for the study?  
(If yes) “Great! I am going to send you a PowerPoint presentation via your email. Please look it  
over – it describes in great detail more information about the study. I will also send you the 
consent form – please take time to read it over and review carefully. If you agree to participate, 
you will be prompted to sign the form electronically.  
I can schedule you for the next phase of screening – this is a 45 minute screening visit. When would 
be a good time for you to come in for that? 
(Proceed with scheduling visit)  
Okay, very important before you come in…  
After you sign the consent form and about 24 hours before your visit, I will send you a survey link 
to your email. It’s important that you complete this survey before you come in, otherwise you will 
need to complete it in person and the visit will take longer than [ADDRESS_788254] review a HIPAA form. This is another important form for you to

5 STUDY  VISITS  AND PROCEDURES  
5.1 SCREENING  VISIT  
Participants  will undergo  a 45 minute in-person  screening  visit  to determine  study  
eligibility.  During  this visit,  participants  will complete  a basic  physical  assessment:  
height,  weight,  heart  rate,  blood  pressure,  expi[INVESTIGATOR_596718],  urine  
toxicology  test,  and pregnancy  test (if applicable),  saliva collection,  and a Screening  
Packet containing  questions  regarding  medical  history  and product  use.  
The schedule  of procedures  for the screening  visit  will occur  in the order  as follows:  
5.1.[ADDRESS_788257] for 
drug  use and pregnancy  testing  (if female).  
If the participant  has a positive  toxicology  screen  (marijuana is okay),  he/she  will be 
dismissed  and given  the option  to rescreen  within 30 days.  
 
5.1.2  Vital  Assessment  
The following  physiological  measures  will be assessed:  
• Height  and Weight  
• Blood  pressure  and heart  rate  
If the participant’s  blood  pressure  is out of range,  it will be re-tested  at the end of 
the visit  manually,  following  the saliva collection.  If it is still  out of range,  they will  
be considered  ineligible.   
 
5.1.3  Screening  Packet  
Short -Term  Cardiovascular  Effects  of E-Cigarettes:  Influence  of Device  Power  IRB#  17-[ZIP_CODE]   
 The screening  packet  will then be administered.  It is broken  into  four  main parts:  
• Section  1: Personal  Data  Form  (Page  1) 
o This  section  contains  the participant’s  contact [CONTACT_596751].  
• Section  4: Medical  History  (Pages  23-28) 
o This  section contains  information  regarding  the participant’s  medical  
history,  including  exclusionary  medical  and psychiatric  conditions.  
o If any symptoms  are endorsed  on the Medical  History  in Section 8, the 
CRC  will follow  up with  the participant  asking:  
 How  often  and when  was  the last time you experienced  these  
symptoms?  
 Do you ever  take medication for this?  If so, how  often?  
Notes  on the Medical  History  follow -up will be recorded  at the bottom  of the last 
page  of the form  (page  16).  
5.1.4  Saliva  Collection  
After  the participant  completes  the Screening  Packet,  he/she  will be asked  to 
provide  a saliva collection.  
5.1.5  End  of Screening  Visit  
At the end of the screening  visit,  the participant  will be asked  to fill out a “Certificate 
of Participation”  in order  to receive compensation  for the screening  visit.  The 
participant will be dismissed  and the CRC  will inform  him/her  that  he/she  will be 
contact[CONTACT_596752] 1-[ADDRESS_788258] -Processing  
The participant’s  urine  will be discarded  and the CRC  will store  the participant’s  
saliva in the freezer  at the UCSF  Tobacco Research  Center  lab. The saliva samples  
will be labeled  with  the Study  ID and transferred  to the Benowitz  Lab at the end of 
the day on Friday  afternoons.  The CRC  will complete  a Screening  Log on the Shared  
Lab Drive  filling  in information on the samples  dropped  off. Cotinine results  will be 
expected  the following  Tuesday.  
 
The CRC  will complete  the Screening  Visit Log and enter  data from  the Screening  
Packet into  the “TCORS -Study  1 Screening  Packet”  REDCap  database.  Data entry  
should  occur  within 48 hours  of the screening  visit.  
The CRC  will submit  the participant’s  check  request after  confirming  the 
participant’s  vapi[INVESTIGATOR_596719]  (COT ≥  30 ng/ml).  If the participant’s cotinine is < 30 
ng/ml,  they  will not be compensated  for their  screening  visit.

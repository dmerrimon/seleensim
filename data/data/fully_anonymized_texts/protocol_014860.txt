3.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
3.1 Hepatocellular Carcinoma  
 
Hepatocel lular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and 
is responsible for more than 500,000 deaths annually.  (1) Previously considered 
uncommon in Western countries, the incidence and mortality of HCC have 
increased three -fold in the [LOCATION_002] over the past two decades. (2) Although 
complete resection or hepatic transplantation remains the most effective the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_333479], 50 -70% of patients present with advanced disease not 
amenable to curative surgical approaches. (3,4) Disease that is diagnosed at an 
advanced stage or with progression after locoregional therapy has a dismal 
prognosis with a media n overall survival of < 12 months mainly due to underlying 
liver dysfunction and suboptimal treatment options. (2) Ablative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_333480] (>5  cm) or multifocal 
tumors, both commonly found in advan ced disease. (5,6) Hepatic artery 
chemoembolization may have utility in patients with HCC but there are 
conflicting reports regarding its efficacy and in advanced disease a survival 
benefit has not been demonstrated. (7,8)  
 
Systemic Therapy for Advanced H epatocellular Carcinoma  
 
The use of single agent systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens including  
 Current: Version 18 dated 0 7/05/[ADDRESS_412146]  historically  demonstrated low 
response rates with little to no clinical efficacy. (9 -11) Combination 
chemotherapy regimens using cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents have fared no 
better with response rates ranging from 0% to 40% and limited clinical efficacy. 
A recent study compared single agent doxorubicin to a combination of cisplatin, 
interf eron, doxorubicin and 5 -fluorouracil (PI[INVESTIGATOR_195652]). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_333481] (10% for doxorubicin vs. 21% for PI[INVESTIGATOR_195652]) the study failed to show an 
improvement in survival (6.8 vs. 8.6 months, respectively; P=0.83). (12)  
 
The lack of appropriate traditional  chemotherapeutic agents led to the 
investigation of molecular targeted agents, which have been shown to be 
efficacious in other tumor models.  Sorafenib, an oral multikinase inhibitor that 
blocks tumor cell proliferation by [CONTACT_333511]/MEK/ERK signa ling pathway 
and exert s an anti-angiogenic effect by [CONTACT_333512], 
VEGFR -2, VEGFR -3 and PDGF -, is the first biologically targeted agent to show 
efficacy in the treatment of advanced stage HCC. ( 13,14 ) In a phase III 
randomized c ontrolled trial  (SHARP trial) , patients with  advanced  hepatocellular 
carcinoma  (not eligible for surgical resection or transplantation)  and preserved 
liver function (Child -Pugh A score) were randomly assigned to either systemic 
sorafenib or placebo. There was a significant ly longer  survival and radiologic 
time to progression (TTP) outcome in the cohort of patients that received 
sorafe nib with little or no toxicity. Grade 3 drug relate events included diarrhea 
(8% in the sorafenib group vs. 2% in the placebo  group), hand -foot skin reaction 
(8% vs. 1%), hypertension (2% vs. 1%) and abdominal pain (2% vs. 1%); there 
were no grade [ADDRESS_412147] supportive care : 5.[ADDRESS_412148] 
supportive care, 10.7 months versus 7.9 months, respectively. (1 4) Although 
systemic treatment with sorafenib shows statistically significant clinical efficacy, 
its overall  benefit is modest . The complexity of HCC would appear to lend itself 
to escape  mechanisms  from the sorafenib -specific blockade of the RAF -MEK -
ERK and VEGFR/PDGF pathways, thereby [CONTACT_333513]-angiogenesis through alternative means .  Such a mechanism would explain 
why certain patients fail to benefit from  sorafenib therapy and provides the 
rationale for combining sorafenib with other chemotherapeutic agents.  
 
3.2 Scientific background of bavituximab  
Anionic phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_333482] y absent from the surface of resting mammalian 
cells under normal conditions.  Phosphotidylserine (PS), the most abundant 
anionic phospholipid of the plasma membrane, is tightly segregated to the internal 
leaflet of the plasma membrane in most cell types. In tumors, however, PS 
becomes exposed on the accessible outer surface of the vascular endothelium in 
response to oxidative stresses present in the tumor microenvironment. (15,16) PS 
 Current: Version 18 dated 0 7/05/201 6 12 exposure on tumor vascular endothelium occurs in 15 -40% of tested tumor 
models in the absence of cellular injury or exogenous agents and has not been 
demonstrated on blood vessels in non -tumor tissues regardless of the model used.  
The administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiation therapy increases PS 
externalization pr esumably through the production of oxygen radicals and the 
subsequent translocase inhibition and scramblase activation. (17 -22) 
3.2.[ADDRESS_412149]. Phillip Thorpe 
at UT Southwestern Medical Center, binds PS complexed with 2-glycoprotein [ADDRESS_412150] effector cells to the tumor vascular endothelium. 
Murine 3G4 has demonstrated significant anti -tumor effects as a stand -alone 
therapy in various murine xenograft tumor models. (20) The growth of MDA -
MB-[ADDRESS_412151] carcinoma, Meth A 
fibrosarcoma and L540 Hodgkin lymphoma tumor xenografts was r educed by 
65%, 75%, 90% and 50%, respectively, compared to controls during treatment 
with 3G4. F c domain -mediated immune effector functions such as antibody 
dependent cell -mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement -dependent 
cytotoxicity and antibody -mediate d phagocytosis appear to be responsible for the 
anti-tumor effect of 3G4. (17)  
The combination of 3G4 with cytotoxic chemotherapy has been shown to have an 
additive effect in multiple tumor models.  Cytotoxic chemotherapy including 
gemcitabine and docetaxe l increases PS exposure on tumor vascular endothelium 
providing additional targets for binding of the 3G4 antibody.  Combination 
gemcitabine -plus- 3G4 therapy reduced tumor growth in a pancreatic cancer 
tumor model 5 -fold compared to either gemcitabine or 3G4 alone. (20) Similar 
results were seen with a combination of docetaxel and 3G4 in a breast cancer 
tumor model. (25) We have recently demonstrated that sorafenib also increases 
PS exposure in the human HCC cell lines, C3A and Huh7. (unpublished results 
from [CONTACT_333539]) (Figure 1)   
 Current: Version 18 dated 0 7/05/[ADDRESS_412152] tumor growth. (22)   
 
 3.2.2  Chimeric 3G4 (Bavituximab)  
Chimeric 3G4 (bavituximab) is a genetically engineered IgG 1 κ immunoglobulin 
containing the variable region sequences (Fab) of a murine PS -targeting 
monoclonal antibody (MAb) and human IgG 1 κ constant region sequences ( Fc). 
Bavituximab is produced by [CONTACT_156331] (CHO) -K1 cells in 
suspension culture in a nutrient medium. Bavituximab is purified by a 
combination of capture, cation, and anion -exchange chromatography. The 
purification process includes specific vira l inactivation and removal procedures. 
Bavituximab is supplied as a sterile preservative -free liquid for intravenous (IV) 
administration.  
3.2.3  Nonclinical Studies with Chimeric 3G4 (Bavituximab)  
The nonclinical safety program to date comprises IV pharmaco kinetic (PK) 
studies in rats and monkeys and tissue distribution studies in rats. Single and 
repeat -dose IV toxicity studies were performed in rats, rabbits, and cynomolgus 
monkeys with treatment duration up to 8 weeks. Special toxicity studies 

 Current: Version 18 dated 0 7/05/201 6 14 evaluating the effects of bavituximab on coagulation, vascular disease, wound 
healing, and platelet aggregation were conducted in rats, rabbits, mice, and 
monkey and human citrated whole blood, respectively. Central nervous system 
(CNS) safety pharmacology and immuno genicity studies were integrated into the 
Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) repeat -dose studies performed in rats. 
Cardiovascular safety pharmacology, immunogenicity, and immunotoxicity 
studies were integrated into the GLP repeat -dose studies performed in mon keys.  
In single -dose studies, findings were limited to in vitro  assay interference in 
phospholipid -based coagulation parameters (i.e., activated partial thromboplastin 
time [aPTT] and prothrombin time [PT]) in all species examined. Drug -induced in 
vitro  coagulation interference peaked within [ADDRESS_412153] -dose. A coagulation study in rats (using a single 60  mg/kg 
dose) confirmed that while aPTT and PT were elevated 2.[ADDRESS_412154] of 
bavituximab (or 3G4) o n phospholipid -based coagulation assays. Plasma 
harvested from normal rats and spi[INVESTIGATOR_333483], in a dose -dependent manner, with 
the analytical performance of aPTT determination. Four p rocoagulant 
T-lymphoblastoid cell lines were characterized for their cell -surface procoagulant 
activity. At high concentrations, 3G4 partially inhibited phospholipid -dependent 
coagulation. Partial inhibition was explained by [CONTACT_96101] 3G4 binding to othe r 
phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (eg, phosphatidylethanolamine) . (25) 
In GLP repeat -dose toxicology studies, bavituximab was generally well tolerated 
with effects in the rat limited to histological findings (minimal, chronic 
subendocardial inflammation) in the high -dose group (100  mg/kg/week for 8 
weeks) and transient increases in coagulation times (aPTT and PT) at 
doses   20 mg/kg/week. Effects in monkeys were limited to transient increases in 
coagulation times (aPTT and PT) and histological changes (i.e., minimal to mil d 
cardiac and pulmonary thrombi, subendocardial fibrosis, and minimal to mild 
pulmonary arteriopathy) in the high -dose group (100  mg/kg/week for 8 weeks).  
Bavituximab did not have any biologically significant effects on monkey or 
human whole blood platelet  aggregation at the range of concentrations tested (i.e., 
1-3130 μg/mL bavituximab). Repeat doses of bavituximab up to 100 mg/kg did 
not affect time to healing in a full thickness excisional dermal wound model in 
rats. 
 
  3.2.4  Clinical Studies with Bavitu ximab  
Bavituximab is currently being investigated in patients with refractory advanced 
solid tumor malignancies and in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection 
(HCV) by [CONTACT_333514].  
 Current: Version 18 dated 0 7/05/[ADDRESS_412155] been 
conducted or are ongoing. In a phase 1 study, 30 patients with chronic HCV 
infection were treated with a single dose of bavituximab at 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3 , or 6 
mg/kg . Patients receiving 6  mg/kg ha d a slight ele vation in d -dimer, which 
returned  to baseline as the antibody cleared from circulation.  Transient reductions 
in viral load suggestive of anti -viral activity were observed at all dose levels. In a 
phase 1b study, 24 patients with chronic HCV were treated tw ice weekly with 
bavituximab at 0.3, 1, 3, or 6 mg/kg. Bavituximab exhibited predictable PK 
characteristics in both studies. All dose levels tested exhibited transient anti -viral 
activity, and 3 mg/kg appeared most active.  
Cancer studies  
Five studies with bavituximab in oncology indications have been conducted or are 
ongoing.  
A phase 1  IND study in patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies was 
conducted  to evaluate the safety, PK, and maximum tolerated/ effective dose of 
bavituximab given as a single agent weekly for 4 weeks. Twenty -six patients were 
enrolled at 0.1, 0.3, 1, or 3  mg/kg. Most adverse events (AEs)  related to 
bavituximab were mild or moderate, and linear PK characteristics were observed. 
Pulmonary embolism, considered se rious and related to study drug, was the only 
dose limiting toxicity observed in the study. This adverse event was grade 4 in 
nature and occurred in one patient 7 days after initiation of therapy.  
Another study in advanced solid tumor malignancies was cond ucted using 3 
mg/kg bavituximab weekly for 8 weeks in combination with chemotherapy 
(docetaxel, gemcitabine, or paclitaxel + carboplatin). Two patients in the 
docetaxel arm discontinued bavituximab treatment after developi[INVESTIGATOR_333484] ; urti caria in both patients . In response to these observed 
infusion reactions, the protocol  was amended to add instructions for 
premedication  with a steroid and an antihistamine prior to each bavituximab 
infusion. One patient with stage IV ovarian carcinoma developed grade 4 
refractory hypotension 2 days after receiving the initial dose  of docetaxel and 
bavituximab and expi[INVESTIGATOR_5697] 1  week after the initial serious adverse event ( SAE ); 
these events are considered probably study drug related. Twelve of the 14 patients 
enrolled were evaluable for tumor response using Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors (RECIST). Three patients achieved partial response (PR)  (2 in the 
paclitaxel/carboplatin arm, 1 in the gemcitabine arm) and continued bavituximab 
maintenance on compassionate grounds, 3  patients demonstrated stable disease, 
and 6  patients had tumor progression . (26) 
Two non -IND phase [ADDRESS_412156] cancer, to investigate the safety and efficacy of bavituximab 3 mg/kg 
weekly in combination with carboplatin plus paclitaxel in 28 -day cycles or 
docetaxel in 28 -day cycles. Fifteen of 46 patients treated in  PPHM 0702 
experienced AEs considered related to bavituximab, including fatigue and 
anemia, and 4 patients experienced drug -related severe adverse events (SAE); 
 Current: Version 18 dated 0 7/05/201 6 16 among stage A patients (in a Simon 2 -stage design) in the intent -to-treat (ITT) 
group, the ORR was 60% (9/15). Thirty -six of 46 patients treated in PPHM 0704 
experienced AEs considered related to bavituximab, including epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], infusion -
related reaction, nasal dryness, and nail bed bleeding, and 4 patients experienced 
drug-related SAEs; the ORR fo r all enrolled patients was 61% (28/46). In PPHM 
0702 and 0704 there were 6 grade 3 or 4 AEs (6 of 92 patients, incidence of 
6.5%). The median number of bavituximab doses for a grade 3 or 4 adverse event 
was 15 (range, 8 to 20). (27,  28) 
Another non -IND ph ase 2 study is being conducted in untreated locally advanced 
or metastatic NSCLC to investigate the safety and efficacy of bavituximab 3 
mg/kg weekly in combination with carboplatin plus paclitaxel in 21 -day cycles. 
Twenty of 49 patients experienced AEs co nsidered related to bavituximab, 
including anemia and fatigue, and 8  patients experienced drug -related SAEs, 
which included fatal myocardial infarction (in 2  patients) and fatal hemoptysis 
and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (in 1 patient). Among stage A patients (in a Simon 2 -stage design) 
in the ITT group, the ORR was 52% (11/21). Grade 3 or 4 AEs were experienced 
by 28.5% of patients.  The most common grade 3 or 4 AEs were anemia (4 
patients), asthenia (4 patients) and neutropenia (4 patients). (29)  
3.3 Study Rationale  
Combi nation therapy consisting of bavituximab and sorafenib is attractive for 
patients with advanced HCC for the following reasons:  
1. Based on the previously mentioned SHARP trial, sorafenib is the first 
drug in the modern era to receive FDA approval for treatmen t of 
advanced HCC.  Although sorafenib is now established as part of 
standard therapy, its overall benefit is modest, and advanced HCC 
remains uniformly fatal.  Due to the multiple escape mechanisms for 
angiogenesis inhibition in HCC, a logical next step w ould be to 
combine sorafenib with other biologic or chemotherapeutic agents.  
2. Externalized PS is a desirable marker for tumor targeting for several 
reasons: PS is specifically and abundantly expressed on tumor vascular 
endothelium; it is present on a high p ercentage of tumor endothelial 
cells in a variety of solid tumors; it is absent from non -tumor 
vasculature; and it is expressed on the luminal side of tumor vascular 
endothelium, which is readily accessible for targeting drugs.  
Combining bavituximab, an a ngiogenesis inhibitor, with sorafenib, an 
angiogenesis inhibitor with a different mechanism, may prevent 
signaling escape mechanisms seen with either drug if given 
individually.  
3. Data from preclinical studies have demonstrated that sorafenib therapy  
increas es PS exposure on tumor vascular endothelium in a HCC tumor 
model.  The increase of PS exposure will amplify the target for 
bavituximab and should increase tumor vessel destruction producing 
increased treatment efficacy.  
 Current: Version 18 dated 0 7/05/201 6 17 It is our hypothesis that combinati on therapy with bavituximab and sorafenib will 
provide greater clinical efficacy than either agent alone with minimal toxicity.  
4.0 OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 4.1 Design  
This is a non -randomized, open -label, single -institution phase I/II therap eutic trial 
of bavituximab and sorafenib in patients with advanced HCC. This study will be 
activated at the UT Southwestern Medical Center, (comprised of The Harold C. 
Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, UT Southwestern Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] -St. Paul and 
Parkland Mem orial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48214] ), VA -North [LOCATION_007], and UT Austin -Seton.  
Advanced HCC is defined as disease that is not amenable to surgical resection or 
orthotopic liver transplantation or is metastatic in nature.   
The phase I component of the study will consist of a traditional 3+3 dose 
escalation rule as outlined in section 11.0.  
The dose levels of bavituximab ( 0.3,1.0,and 3.0 mg/kg weekly) were selected 
based on available data from preclinical and clinical studies that is predicted to 
achieve and sustain biologic ally active blood antibody levels or tumor binding in 
cancer patients.  
 A bavituximab dose of 3 mg/kg  gives a blood concentration in excess of that 
needed for maximal efficacy based on preclinical models while having little 
effect on coagulation and safety  laboratory parameters and causing no 
significant depletion of the cofactor protein, β 2GP1 . 
 In preclinical models, dosing above the biologically effective blood 
concentration of 2 µg/mL did not increase anti -tumor efficacy.  
 Treatment with ≤ 3 mg/kg bavitux imab appears to be well tolerated . 
 β2-glycoprotein I levels are significantly depleted above 3 mg/kg 
bavituximab . 
4.2Intervention  
4.2.1 Phase I component  
 The following is a brief schematic of Phase I component study flow:   
 
 Current: Version 18 dated 0 7/05/[ADDRESS_412157] one of the following criterion listed below:  
a. Histologically confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma  
b. Axial imaging consistent with liver cirrhosis and at least one soli d liver 
lesion ≥2 cm with early enhancement and delayed enhancement washout 
regardless of alpha -fetoprotein (AFP) levels.  
c. AFP ≥ 400 ng/ml and evidence of at least one solid liver lesion ≥ [ADDRESS_412158] advanced disease as defined previously in section 4.1. 
Attending surgical oncology, hepatologists and liver transplant physicians (either 
surgeons or hepatologists) with expertise in the management of HCC will assess 
suitability of surgical re section and liver transplantation at participating sites.  
All patients will initially be staged with a liver protocol MRI  or CT  of the abdomen. A 
chest CT will be done if there is a concern for intra -pulmonary metastases.  
Bavituximab will be administered o n a weekly schedule until completion of the phase I 
component of the study or the development of any of the criteria for requiring removal 
from the study as outlined in Section 11 of the protocol. Bavituximab will be dosed 
according to the timeline of the phase I and II components of the study.  In the phase I 
component, bavituximab will be started at 0.3 mg/kg and will be escalated pending DLT 
to 1.0 mg/kg and 3.0 mg/kg.  These doses will be given intravenously over [ADDRESS_412159]

10.1 Correlative Studies  (Phase II patients only)  
Pathology Correlative Studies  
 A major obstacle to molecularly targeted chemotherapeutic agents has been 
obtaining relevant tumor tissue to measure the agents’ biologic effects on target 
molecules or cellular pathways within the tumor.  The utilization of sequential 
tumor biops ies to obtain tissue following treatment is well established in breast 
and colorectal carcinoma. (30) However, sequential tumor biopsies of liver 
tumors are less established due to a fear of procedural complications.  The fear of 
bleeding events following liver biopsy of HCC appears unfounded and based on 
anecdotal evidence.  A large, multi -institutional trial where patients with 
advanced chronic hepatitis C underwent sequential liver biopsies demonstrated 16 
cases (0.6%) of bleeding following 2740 liver bi opsies.  There were no deaths 
from peri -procedural bleeding and a platelet count under [ZIP_CODE] was identified as 
a risk factor. (31) Two large published series of core needle biopsy of HCC as a 
diagnostic measure report bleeding events in less than 1% of pat ients with no 
reported mortalities.  In both series capsular location of HCC was associated with 
increased incidence of bleeding event. (32,33)  
In this study all patients will potentially undergo up to two image -guided (either 
CT or ultrasound) core needle  biopsy of a single site of HCC at baseline (for 
clinical care) and between five and six weeks after the initiation of bavituximab . 
In addition to the patients receiving treatment as part of this clinical trial, patients 
identified from the HCC clinics at UT Southwestern who are initiating sorafenib 
monotherapy will undergo biopsies at baseline and between five and six weeks 
after initiation.  These biops ies are not mandatory to initiate or continue with 
therapy  and are subject to a separate informed consent .  To increase patient safety 
the following conditions must be met prior to liver biopsy:  
 Platelet count ≥ 70,000 
 INR ≤ 1.8  
 Target lesion not subcapsular in nature as determined by [CONTACT_333519]  
 Sorafenib will be discontinued for a period of [ADDRESS_412178] clinical protocol, wh ich includes obtaining a separate informed 
consent for the procedure itself.  The core samples will be provided to the 
surgical oncology laboratory. If a core biopsy is performed as a part of the 
 Current: Version 18 dated 0 7/05/201 6 32 patient’s  clinical care, extra cores will be obtained for su rgical oncology 
laboratory, in addition to the cores necessary for clinical care.  All cores will 
be obtained through the same needle to avoid t he need of additional 
punctures and  to minimize associated risks.  
We will plan to use this tissue to correlate p atient outcome measures with markers of 
anti-angiogenesis therapy and immune response modulation on patients with matched 
samples.  Specifically, we will perform the following tissue based analysis at baseline 
and 5 and 6  following initiation of either mon otherapy with sorafenib or combination 
therapy with bavituximab and sorafenib : 
 Histologic analysis of cell infiltrate of the tumor (specifically macrophage 
and T cell, both cytotoxic and regulatory)  
 Localization of PS exposure on tumor vascular endotheliu m 
 Markers of immune response including T cell activation assays  
 Analysis of angiogenic, hypoxia and RAS/MAPK pathway tissue 
biomarkers  
These tissue -based analyses will be correlated with the primary endpoint of time 
to progression. The collection of tissu e in patients treated with sorafenib alone 
and with combination of sorafenib and bavituximab will allow us to further define 
the mechanism of action as it pertains to bavituximab. We believe the liver 
biopsies provide minimal risk to the patient and will a llow us to validate whether 
the therapy  regimen affects intended molecular targets to further elucidate 
mechanism of action. This will allow us in the future to develop a predictive 
profile to tailor this regimen in patients who will show the most benefit.  
Laboratory Correlative Studies  
The kinetics of alpha -fetoprotein and viral hepatitis titers (in those patients with 
baseline elevation) may serve as an early indicator of response to treatment in 
patients with advanced HCC.  These biomarkers have been ass ociated with 
response to sorafenib therapy  and may serve as a predictive biomarker to 
treatment outcome with the bavituximab and sorafenib regimen.  We plan to 
conduct an analysis of alfa -fetoprotein and viral hepatitis titer levels as biomarker 
surrogates  of outcome.  Specifically, alfa -fetoprotein titers will be drawn at 
baseline, at 2 weeks after initiation of therapy and every 6 weeks thereafter while 
still enrolled in the study.  Quantitative changes in alfa -fetoprotein will be 
described for patients w here matched samples are available and will be correlated 
with the primary clinical endpoint of time to progression.  
In addition, serum angiogenic and hypoxia biomarkers will be analyzed from 
serum  and plasma samples collected from patients treated with ba vituximab and 
sorafenib and sorafenib alone. Blood will be collected in two separate vacutainer 
tubes, a red top with no additive and a purple top with EDTA additive.  
 Current: Version 18 dated 0 7/05/[ADDRESS_412179] of a traditional 3+3 dose 
escalation rule with the dose of sorafenib remaining constant and the dose of 
bavituximab escalating up to 3.0 mg/kg weekly to determine the maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) that will be  used during the phase II component. Sorafenib 
has been demonstrated in multiple phase I and II studies in advanced HCC to have 
minimal toxicity and to be safe, therefore doses will be constant. (13,14) Cohorts 
of three patients will be assigned to one dos e level of bavituximab starting at 0.3 
mg/kg weekly.   Only the first cycle of therapy ( 4 doses of bavituximab and 4 
weeks of sorafenib constitutes a cycle ) will be used to determine dose limiting 
toxicity (DLT). The patients will be followed for thirty da ys following the end of 
the first cycle for adverse events. These adverse events will be submitted to the 
Data Safety Monitoring Committee for evaluation.  During this thirty -day period 
and beyond patients will be administered sorafenib at the discretion o f the treating 
oncologist. Patients will be enrolled into the next highest drug cohort only after [ADDRESS_412180] cycle of therapy. The number of observed 
toxicities is counted and the traditional escalation rule applied:  
 No toxici ty: the next three patients will be assigned to next higher 
dose level (3.0 mg/kg of bavituximab is the highest dose assigned).  
 At least two toxicities: the MTD is exceeded and the phase I 
component of the trial will be stopped with the next lowest dose to  
be defined as the MTD that will be used in the phase II component.  
 One toxicity: the cohort will be expanded to [ADDRESS_412181] six patients:  The next cohort of 
three patients will be assigned to the next highest dose level  
o At least t wo DLTs  within the last six patients: the MTD is 
exceeded and the phase I component of the trial will be 
stopped with the next lowest dose to be defined as the dose 
that will be used in the phase II component.  
The Data and Safety Monitoring Committee and i nvestigators as described below 
will regularly review all adverse events. The study will utilize the Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 for grading of all 
adverse events related to treatment.  
 Current: Version 18 dated 0 7/05/201 6 34  
The following will be considere d a dose -limiting toxicity:  
 
 Grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia ≥ 7 days (absolute granulocyte 
count < 0.5 x 109/L) 
 platelet count < 25,000  
 ALT or AST levels ≥ grade 3 adverse event for 7 days  
 ≥ grade 3 adverse event for any non -hematologic toxicity (excluding 
alopecia and non -premedicated nausea/vomiting ) attributable to drug 
therapy by [CONTACT_333520].  In the 
SHARP trial patients in the placebo arm had over a 50% ≥ grade 3 adverse 
event rate due to the comordities seen in the patient population with 
advanced HCC.   
 
12.0 TOXICITIES/SIDE EFFECTS  
12.1 Sorafenib  
1. Cardiac ischemia and/or infarction:  The  incidence of cardiac 
ischemia/infarction was 2.7% in NexavarTM patients compared with 1.3% 
in the placebo group and in patients treated with renal cell carcinoma. 
Temporary or permanent discontinuation of NexavarTM should be 
considered in patients who develop cardiac ischemia and/or infarction.  
2. Risk of hemorrhage: A n increased risk of bleeding may occur following 
NexavarTM administration. In the SHARP trial, an excess of bleeding 
regardless of causality was not apparent and the rate of bleeding from 
esophageal varices was 2.4% in NexavarTM patients and 4% in placebo  
patients.  
3. Hypertension: Blood pressure should be monitored weekly during the first 
[ADDRESS_412182] medical practice. In the SHARP 
trial, hypertension was reporte d in approximately 9.4% of NexavarTM -
treated patients and 4.3% of patients in the placebo group . 
4. Dermatologic: Hand -foot skin reaction and rash represent the most 
common adverse reactions attributed to NexavarTM. Rash and hand -foot 
skin reaction are us ually CTCAE Grade [ADDRESS_412183] six weeks of treatment with NexavarTM. Management of 
dermatologic toxicities may include topi[INVESTIGATOR_333489], temporary treatment interruption and/or dose modification of 
NexavarTM, or in severe or persistent cases, permanent discontinuation of 
NexavarTM.  
12.2 Bavituximab  
1. Thromboembolic events: in the initial studies administering bavituximab   
for patients with chronic HCV infection there were no reports of 
 Current: Version 18 dated 0 7/05/201 6 35 thromboembolic  events including arterial thrombosis or venous 
thrombosis (deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).  In later 
studies combining bavituximab and chemotherapy in cancer patients there 
was a small increase in thromboembolic events.  These events were 
mainly deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.  There were no fatal 
events attritubutable to these adverse events and it is unclear whether the 
events were a direct result of combined chemotherapy or the inherent risk 
of thromboembolic events seen in canc er patients.  
2. Infusion reactions: Bavituximab is a chimeric antibody and some patients 
may experience side effects associated with monoclonal antibody therapy, 
including allergic/hypersensitivity reactions or cytokine release 
syndrome/acute infusion reactio ns. There is significant overlap between 
these reactions, with common manifestations including (but not limited 
to):  drug fever, flushing, rash, dyspne a, bronchospasm, or hypotension. I n 
studies investigating bavituximab in combination with chemotherapy, pre-
medication with antihistamines and/or steroids was administered resulting 
in 20 -30% Grade I or II adverse infusion reactions. These have been 
generally well tolerated, and have not required an alteration in 
bavituximab dosing.  
3. Prolonged coagulation tim es: Prolonged coagulation times (e.g., aPTT) 
have been observed in preclinical and clinical studies that are not 
associated with significant bleeding.  In clinical studies, prolongation of 
aPTT has been noted at the highest doses administered (3 and 6 mg/k g).  
This concentration - dependent, transient and reversible phenomenon is 
believed to be due to in vitro  assay interference and does not pose a 
significant bleeding risk to patients.  
4. Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting and anorexia occur infrequently and 
are self -limiting without additional treatment.  
 
Because of the potential for thrombogenicity with agents such as bavituximab, 
patients will be monitored for the development of thromboembolic events as 
follows:   
 Regular assessment of blood coagulation param eters (PT, INR, aPTT ). 
Regular screening for potential arterial or venous thromboses during 
physical examination  
 Regular bilateral lower extremity venous doppler ultrasound  
Thrombotic/thromboembolic events including, but not limited to,  superficial 
thrombophlebitis, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, 
cerebrovascular accident, ischemic stroke, coronary thrombosis, myocardial 
infarction, myocardial ischemia (including isolated ECG findings), arterial 
embolism, arterial thrombosis, ca theter -related thrombosis, or intra -abdominal 
thromboembolism should be captured as an adverse event. Tumor thrombus is 
not a thrombotic/thromboembolic event and will not be captured as an AE.  
 Current: Version 18 dated 0 7/05/201 6 36 Note:  Elevated d -dimer alone does not constitute a thrombotic AE and should 
not be captured as such.   
13.0 CRITERIA FOR THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESSMENT  
(Phase II Component)  
 
For the purposes of this study, patients will be evaluated for response at [ADDRESS_412184] criteria 
are included below.  
 
13.1 Definitions  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new 
international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_107330] (RECIST) Committee [ JNCI  92(3):205 -216, 2000].  Changes in only the 
largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions are  
used in the RECIST criteria.  Note:  Lesions are either measurable or non -
measurable using the criteria provided below. The term “evaluable” in reference 
to measurability will not be used because it does not provide additional meaning 
or accuracy.  
 
13.1.[ADDRESS_412185] 
one dimension (longest diameter to  be recorded) as > 20 mm with conventional 
techniques (PET, CT, MRI, x -ray) or as > [ADDRESS_412186] be recorded in millimeters or decimal fractions of 
centimeters.  A “high -resolution” CT scan is one in wh ich images are recorded at 
least every 5 mm.  
   
13.1.2  Non-Measurable disease  
 
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter < 
20 mm with conventional techniques or < [ADDRESS_412187] scan), are 
considered non-measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, 
ascites, pleural / pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, inflammatory 
breast disease, abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), and cystic lesions 
are all non -measurable.  
 
13.1.3 Target lesions  
 
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of five lesions per organ and 10 lesions 
in total representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions  
and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selec ted on the 
basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and their suitability for 
accurate repeated measurements (either by [CONTACT_14217]).  A 
 Current: Version 18 dated 0 7/05/[ADDRESS_412188] diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and 
reported as the baseline sum LD.  The baseline sum LD will be used as reference 
by [CONTACT_14218].  
 
13.1.4  Non-target lesions  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) that are not target lesions as defined in 
section 13.1.[ADDRESS_412189] progressive disease on the basis of larger non -target 
lesions. The presence or absence of eac h non -target lesion should be noted 
throughout follow -up. 
 
13.2 Evaluation of target lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all target lesions. The patient must 
be free of all symptoms of cancer.  
  
Partial Response (PR) :  At least a 30% decrea se in the sum of the longest 
diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the baseline sum LD.  Positive 
washing, brushing or biopsy and/or residual tumor may still be evident on 
endoscopy and/or CT scan. No lesion may increase in size and no new le sion may 
appear.  
 
Progression (PD) :  At least a 20% increase in the sum of LD of target lesions 
taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or 
the appearance of one or more new lesions.  
 
Stable Disease (SD) :  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD taking as references the smallest sum LD.  
 
13.3 Evaluation of non -target lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions and 
normalization  of tumor marker level.  
 
Non-Complete Response (non CR) :  Persistence of one or more non -target lesions 
or/ and maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
 
Progression (PD) :  Appearance of one or more new lesions. Unequivocal 
progression o f existing non -target lesions. (Although a clear progression of "non -
target" lesions only is exceptional, in such circumstances, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_333490], and the progression status should be confirmed 
at a later time by [CONTACT_333521] (or study chair).  
 
 Current: Version 18 dated 0 7/05/[ADDRESS_412190] response recorded from the start of the 
treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). The 
patient's best re sponse assignment will depend on the achievement of both 
measurement and confirmation criteria.   
 
 
Target Lesions  Non-target lesions  New lesions  Overall response  
CR CR No CR 
CR Non-CR/Non -PD No PR 
PR Non-PD No PR 
SD Non-PD No SD 
PD Any Yes or No  PD 
Any PD Yes or No  PD 
Any Any Yes PD 
 
 
 
1.  Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be 
reported as  "symptomatic deterioration". Every effort should be made to 
document the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  
  
2.  In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from 
normal tissue. When the evaluatio n of complete response depends upon this 
determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine 
needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) before confirming the complete response status.  
 
13.[ADDRESS_412191] of a treatment.  
 
• Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g. skin nodules, palpable lymph nodes). In the case of skin 
lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_3606] a ruler to estimate t he 
size of the lesion is recommended.  
 Current: Version 18 dated 0 7/05/201 6 39  
• Lesions on chest X -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. However, CT is preferable.  
 
• Conventional CT and MRI should be performed with cuts of [ADDRESS_412192], abdomen, and 
pelvis. Head & neck and extremities usually require specific protocols.  
 
• When the primary endpoint of the study is objective response evaluation, 
ultrasound (US) should not be used to measure tumor lesions that are 
clinically not easily accessible. It is a possible alternative to clinical 
measurements of superficial palpable nodes, subcutaneous lesions, and 
thyroid nodules. US might also be useful to confirm the complete 
disappearance of superficial lesions usually assessed by [CONTACT_12148].  
 
 13.6 Confirmatory measurement/duration of response  
 
Confirmation :  The main goal of confirmation of objective response is to avoid 
overestimating the response rate observed.  In cases where confirmation of 
response is not feasible, it should be made clear when reporting the outcome of 
such studies that the responses ar e not confirmed.  To be assigned a status of PR 
or CR changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by [CONTACT_333522] [ADDRESS_412193] once 
after study entry at a minimum interval of 8 weeks.  
 
Duration of overall response :  The duration of overall response is measured from 
the time measurement criteria are met for CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) 
until the fir st date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented, 
taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded 
since the treatment started).  
 
The duration of overall complete response  is measured from the time 
measu rement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease 
is objectively documented.  
 
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started.  
 
14.[ADDRESS_412194] 
one cycle of treatment.  In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse 
event(s), treatment may continue until one of the following criteria applies:  
 Current: Version 18 dated 0 7/05/201 6 40  
 Disease recurrence/progression, defined as emergence of an unequivocal 
new tumor (site of metastasis) > 1 cm in size, clinical progression in non -
measurable sites of disease, or unequivocal changes in size of the primary 
tumor.  
 Development of an intercurr ent medical condition or need for 
concomitant treatment that precludes further participation in the trial.  
 Unacceptable toxicity or any adverse event that precludes further 
participation in the trial.  
 The investigator removes the patient from the trial in the best interests of 
the patient.  
 Patient death.  
 Study completion or discontinuation.  
 Patient withdraws consent to continued participation in the trial or is lost 
to follow -up. 
 
15.0 BIOSTATISTICS  
 
The study is an open -label, non -randomized single -arm, single institution phase 
I/II therapeutic clinical trial.  The study population will be patients with advanced 
hepatocellular carcinoma.  
  
 15.[ADDRESS_412195] of a traditional 3+3 dose 
escalation r ule with 3 or 6 patients in each cohort, the process for dose escalation 
is outlined in section 4.1.  
 
The median TTP of patients with advanced HCC treated with sorafenib therapy  is 
5.5 months.  Using this as a benchmark, we will enroll 38 patients, which w ill 
allow us to differentiate between a median TTP of 5.5 months and 8.3 months 
with 80% power and a two-sided significance level of 10% assuming a 24-month 
accrual and a 12 -month follow -up period.  TTP will be calculated from initiation 
of therapy to dise ase progression  (intention to treat) as outlined in section 13.0.  
Removal from study as outlined in section 14 will be a censored event.  
 
15.2 Secondary endpoints  
 
Secondary endpoints of efficacy are to evaluate overall survival, progression -free 
surviva l and response rates.  The overall survival and progression -free survival 
will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method, and Greenwood’s formula will 
be used to calculate the standard error of the corresponding Kaplan -Meier 
estimate and 95% confidence in terval.  Survival curves will be estimated using 
Kaplan -Meier methodology.  Response rates will be calculated as described in 
section 13.4.  Accrual is expected to take 2 years with a minimum of 1year 
subsequent follow -up, overall follow -up will range from  1 to 3 years.   
 Current: Version 18 dated 0 7/05/201 6 41  
Other secondary objectives will include description of toxicity of the therapy  
regimen.  These data will be analyzed separately.  The safety analyses will be 
performed on all patients who receive any dose of therapy .  Adverse events will 
be described using the NCI CTCAE v 4.0 criteria 
(ctep.cancer.gov/forms. CTCAEv4 .pdf).  Frequency and severity of adverse events 
according to the NCI CTCAE v# body system and severity criteria will be 
described.  In addition, frequency of Grade 3 or 4 adverse events will be described 
separately.  Causality will also be noted. Adverse events will be recorded for up to 
1 year following discontinuation from study.  
 
Laboratory assessments will also be described according to the NCI CTCAE v 4 
criteria, with separate descriptions for Grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities.  
Clinically signif icant laboratory abnormalities will be described as well.  Serious 
adverse events will be summarized, including a causality assessment.   
 
The number of treatment cycles and doses administered will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics.  Treatment del ays will summarized using counts and 
percentages.  
 
 Patients’ disposition will be summarized in the following manner:  
 
 The number and percentage of patients selected, included, completed, 
withdrawn and lost to follow -up will be summarized using descriptiv e 
statistics.  
 Major protocol deviations will be summarized.  
 The reason for withdrawal (adverse events, lack of efficacy, major 
protocol deviation, non -medical reason, recovery or remission) will be 
summarized.  
 
For pathology -, laboratory - and imaging -corre lative studies, Cox regression 
analysis will be conducted to investigate the association between TTP and 
parameters from correlative studies.  
 
16.0 DATA MANAGEMENT  
 
 16.1 Data and Safety Monitoring  
  
The UTSW Simmons Cancer Center (SCC) Data Safety Monitoring Committee 
(DSMC) is responsible for monitoring data quality and patient safety for all 
UTSW SCC clinical trials.  As part of that responsibility, the DSMC reviews all 
local serious adverse events in real time as they are reported and reviews adverse 
events on a quarterly basis.  The quality assurance activity for the Clinical 
Research Office provides for periodic auditing of clinical research documents to 
ensure data integrity and regulatory compli ance.  
  
 Current: Version 18 dated 0 7/05/[ADDRESS_412196], 
frequency of DSMC monitoring is dependent upon the lev el of risk.  Risk level is 
determined by [CONTACT_264031] a number of factors such as the patient 
population to be studied; adequacy of the data management system; and 
procedures to ensure the safety of study subjects based on the associated risks of 
the study.  Protocol -specific DSMC plans must be consistent with these 
principles. The following examples can be used to begin developi[INVESTIGATOR_333491].   
 
 High risk  examples include Phase 1 studies; Phase II or III studies where 
the S CC is the DSMC; gene therapy or recombinant DNA studies; and studies in 
which the investigator holds the IND.  
 
 Moderate risk  examples include pi[INVESTIGATOR_333492] a 
non-FDA approved  drug.  
 
 Low risk  examples include Phase II or III studies involving FDA -
approved drugs where the SCC DSMC is not the DSMC of record, or trials, which 
involve non -therapeutic interventions.  
 
 Exempt examples include non -interventional studies, which are exempt 
from audit requirements outlined above.  
 
17.[ADDRESS_412197] conform to IRB guidelines.  
  
Inclusion of Women and Minorities:  Patients of all races, both male and female, 
will be accepted into the protocol.  
 
Exclusion of Lactating or Pregnant Women:  Children have been excluded from 
this study.  Hepatocellular carcinoma is an adult cancer.  Thu s, the relevance of 
this drug to the pediatric population has not been established.  Lactating and 
pregnant women are also excluded because of potential anti -proliferative effects 
of therapy  that may be harmful to the developi[INVESTIGATOR_17779].  
 
Benefits:   It is possible that this treatment will result in shrinkage of 
hepatocellular carcinoma or in a stabilization of an otherwise progressing disease.  
 Current: Version 18 dated 0 7/05/[ADDRESS_412198] overall survival of the patients.  
 
Costs:   The patient will be responsible for the costs of standard medical care, 
including, MRI scans (excluding the MRI scan at week 5 of treatment), all drug 
administration fees (exc luding sessions where bavituximab is given), and all 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], even for complications of treatment.  Bavituximab will be 
supplied to patients without costs from Peregrine Pharmaceuticals.  Patients will 
not be responsible for the costs of tissue or  serum procurement (including image 
guided biopsies) obtained for research purposes.  
 
Incentives:   No incentives will be offered to patients/subjects for participation in 
this study.  
 
Alternatives:   For patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, alternative 
treatments may include other chemotherapy regimens or loco -regional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_333493].  At 
present, no specific treatment appro ach is considered standard of care for the 
disease.  Patients may be eligible for other investigational studies.  
 
Confidentiality:   Every effort will be made to maintain patient confidentiality.  
Research and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_333494].  Patient’s n ame or any personally 
identifying information will not be used in reports or publications resulting from 
this study.  The Food and Drug Administration or other authorized agencies (i.e., 
qualified monitors from UT Southwestern Medical Center, the NCI, etc. ), may 
review patients records and pathology slides, as required.  
 
17.1 Privacy  
 
It is the responsibility of the research staff to endure that protocol subjects receive 
the UT Southwestern Medical Center Notice of Privacy Practices.  
 
17.2 Adverse Events  
 
Adve rse Events will be reported as indicated by [CONTACT_114641] 
(see below).    
 
Definition  
An adverse event  is defined as any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence 
in a human research study participant, including any abnormal sign (for example, 
abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, clinical event, or 
disease, that occurs during the subjec t’s participation in the research, whether or 
not it is considered related to the subject’s participation in the research.  
 Current: Version 18 dated 0 7/05/[ADDRESS_412199] commonly in the context of biomedical research, although on 
occasion, they can occur in the context of social and behavioral research. Adverse 
events may be expected or unexpected.  
Severity  
Adverse events will be graded by a numerical score according to the defined NCI 
Common Terminology Crit eria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) and version 
number specified in the protocol. Adverse events not specifically defined in the 
NCI CTCAE will be scored on the Adverse Event log according to the general 
guidelines provided by [CONTACT_333523].   
 Grade 1: Mild  
 Grade 2: Moderate  
 Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life 
threatening  
 Grade 4: Life threatening consequences  
 Grade 5: Death related to the adverse event  
 
Serious Adverse Events  
ICH Guideline E2A and the U TSW IRB define serious adverse events as those 
events, occurring at any dose, which meets any of the following criteria:  
 Results in death   
 Immediately life -threatening  
 Results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929]  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition.  
Note: A “Serious adverse event” is by [CONTACT_333524]. Serious adverse events may or may not be related to the research 
project. A serious adverse event determination does n ot require the event to be 
related to the research. That is, both events completely unrelated to the condition 
under study and events that are expected in the context of the condition under 
study may be serious adverse events, independent of relatedness to  the study 
itself. As examples, a car accident requiring overnight hospi[INVESTIGATOR_283060] a 
serious adverse event for any research participant; likewise, in a study 
investigating end -stage cancer care, any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_333495] a 
serious adve rse event, even if the event observed is a primary clinical endpoint of 
the study.  
 
 Current: Version 18 dated 0 7/05/201 6 45  
Unanticipated Problems:  
The term “unanticipated problem” is found, but not defined in the regulations for 
the Protection of Human Subjects at 45 CFR 46, and the FDA regula tions at 21 
CFR 56. Guidance from the regulatory agencies considers unanticipated problems 
to include any incident, experience, or outcome that meets each  of the following 
criteria:  
 Unexpected  (in terms of nature, severity or frequency) ; AND  
 Definitely, pr obably, or possibly related  to participation in the research; AND  
 Serious or a possible unexpected problem in  that the research places subjects 
or others at a greater risk of harm  than was previously known or recognized.  
Note: Any serious adverse event wou ld always suggest a greater risk of harm.  
 
Follow -up  
 
All adverse events will be followed up according to good medical practices.  
  
Reporting  
Local unanticipated problems require  expedited reporting, are submitted to the 
UTSW IRB through the UTSW eIRB and to the SCC DSMC Coordinator.  
Hardcopi[INVESTIGATOR_279177]; FDA Form #3500A forms, 
or other sponsor forms, if applicable; and/or any other supporting docu mentation 
available should be forwarded to the DSMC Coordinator.  The DSMC 
Coordinator forwards the information onto the DSMC Chairman who determines 
if immediate action is required.  Follow -up eIRB reports, and all subsequent SAE 
documentation that is ava ilable are also submitted to the DSMC Chair who 
determines if further action is required.    
  
All local serious adverse events which occur on research subjects on protocols for 
which the SCC is the DSMC of record require reporting to the DSMC regardless o f 
whether IRB reporting is required. Hardcopi[INVESTIGATOR_333496] #3500A forms, or other sponsor forms, if applicable; and/or any other 
supporting documentation available should be forwarded to the DSMC Coordinator.  
 
If the event occur s on a multi -institutional clinical trial coordinated by [CONTACT_283096], the 
DOT Manager or lead coordinator ensures that all participating sites are notified of the event 
and resulting action, according to FDA guidance for expedited reporting. DSMC Cha irperson 
reviews all serious adverse events within upon receipt from the DSMC Coordinator. The 
DSMC Chairperson determines whether action is required and either takes action 
immediately, convenes a special DSMC session (physical or electronic), or defers t he action 
until a regularly scheduled DSMC meeting.

Pati ents with Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma  
Funding Agency/Sponsor:  UT Southwestern Medical Center ; Peregrine 
Pharmaceuticals  
Study Doctors:  Adam C. Yopp , John C. Mansour, C. Glen Balch, Yull 
Arriaga, Sirrisha Karri, Muhamm ad Sha alan Beg , , 
William M. Lee,  Juan Arenas, Meelie Debroy , , 
Jonathan Dowell , Takeshi Y okoo, and Hao Zhu  
Research Personnel:  Tyson Dudley , Alisha Hill , Erika Lopez,  
You may call these study doctors or research personnel during regular office hours 
at [PHONE_6940]. At other times, you may call them at [PHONE_6941].  
Instructions:  
Please read this consent form carefully and take your time making a decision about 
whether to participate.  As the researchers discuss this consent form with you, 
please ask him/her to explain any words or infor mation that you do not clearly 
understand.  The purpose of the study, risks, inconveniences, discomforts, and other 
important information about the study are listed below.  If you decide to participate, 
you will be given a copy of this form to keep.  
Why is  this study being done?  
This study is being done to find out whether an investigational (non -FDA approved) 
drug combination including bavituximab and sorafenib can treat hepatocellular 
carcinoma better or more safely than standard medication. The word 
“inv estigational” means the combination of bavituximab and sorafenib is still being 
 Current: Version 18 dated 0 7/05/201 6 55 tested in research studies and is not approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) for combination treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.  
Sorafenib has been approve d by [CONTACT_333528].  
Why is this considered research?  
This is a research study because the combination of bavituximab and sorafenib has 
not been previously used in combination as study drugs for hepatocellular 
carcin oma.  
The following definitions may help you understand this study:   
 Standard medical care means the regular care you would receive from your 
personal doctor if you choose not to participate in this research.  
 Researchers means the study doctor  and research personnel at the 
University of [LOCATION_007] Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas and its affiliated 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].  
Why am I being asked to take part in this research study?  
You are being asked to take part in this study because you have hepatocellular 
carcinoma.   
Do I have to take part in this research study?”  
No.  You have the right to choose whether you want to take part in this research 
study.  If you decide to participate and later change your mind, you are free to stop 
participation at any time.  
If you decide not to take part in this research study it will not change your legal 
rights or the quality of health care that you receive at this center.  
How many people will take part in this study?  
About 56 people will take part in this study at UT Southw estern , Parkland Health 
and Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_333502]-North [LOCATION_007] or UT Austin -Seton . 
What is involved in the study?  
If you volunteer to take part in this research study, you will be asked to sign this 
consent form and will have the following tests and procedures .  Some of the 
procedures may be part of your standard medical care, but others are being done 
solely for the purpose of this study.  
Screening Procedures  
To help decide if you qualify to be in this study, the researchers may ask you 
questions about your he alth, including medications you take and any surgical 
procedures you have had.  
 Current: Version 18 dated 0 7/05/[ADDRESS_412211] the following exams, tests or 
procedures:  
 Demographic information  
 Medical history and physical exam  
 Vital signs  
 Blood tests  
 Radiology (x -ray) tests  
 Biopsy of liver tumor  
 Urinalysis  
 EKG  
 
Treatment  
If you decide to participate in this study you will take the following:  
 1-2 tablets of sorafenib (200 -400mg daily, twice a day) and 
 Bavituximab is given intravenously once a week, the approximate time to 
complete each infusion is 90 minutes  
o The study uses increasing doses of bavituximab and your dose of 
bavituximab may be different from other patients in the study.  
 
Participation and Evaluation during the Research  
Participation in this study will involve several procedures.  Many of these 
procedures are part of the normal process of treating tumors such as yours.  
However, some of these procedures can be uncomfortable, inconvenient or painful.  
In addition to the procedures associated wi th the administration of bavituximab and 
sorafenib as detailed above, you will be asked to participate in other procedures as 
part of your involvement in this study.  
1. Blood tests:  Blood will be drawn from your vein prior to enrollment in the 
study and ever y week prior to the administration of bavituximab up until the 
time you are no longer receiving bavituximab. No more than 45 ml (3 
tablespoons) of blood will be collected at any one time.  
2. Urinalysis: A urine sample will be collected prior to enrollment and  every 
week prior to the administration of bavituximab up until the time you are no 
longer receiving bavituximab.  
3. CT or MRI Scan: This imaging test will be performed prior to enrollment in 
the study  and every 6 weeks up until the time you are no longer rec eiving 
bavituximab.  
4. Biopsy of liver tumor:  If a biopsy of your liver tumor is deemed necessary for 
your clinical care, we would like to collect additional  specimen s for research 
in addition to the amount needed for clinical care.  A second biopsy may be  
collected at the 5-6 week visit or after five to six doses of bavituximab.  This 
second biopsy is the  optional component of the study.  A separate consent 
form will be completed by [CONTACT_333529]: Version 18 dated 0 7/05/201 6 57 procedure.  
5. Bilateral lower  extremity venous duplex:  This routine test will be performed 
prior to enrollment and at [ADDRESS_412212] dose of bavituximab.  
 
There will be no scheduled additional doctors’ office visits for the study.  Study visits 
will be included during the ro utinely scheduled follow -up, which is routine for these 
types of treatment.  
The first biopsy will be collected prior to enrollment in the study. If a biopsy of your 
liver tumor is deemed necessary for your clinical care, we would like to collect a 
small a mount of specimen for research in addition to the amount needed for clinical 
care.  The second biopsy of the liver tumor (completed [ADDRESS_412213] dose of 
bavituximab) is designed for research, not for medical purposes.  They are not 
useful for fin ding problems or diseases.  Even though the researchers are not 
looking at your second tumor biopsy to find or treat a medical problem, you will be 
told if they notice something unusual.  You and your regular doctor can decide 
together whether to follow up  with more tests or treatment.  Because the second 
tumor biopsy done in this study is not for medical purposes, the research results 
will not be sent to you or to your regular doctor.  
Procedures for storing of extra or left over samples  
 The tissue obtained from the biopsies of the liver tumor will go to the 
surgical oncology laboratory at UT Southwestern Medical Center.  The samples will 
be labeled with your name [CONTACT_333536]. Only [CONTACT_333540] C . Yopp will have access to the samples.   
 The biopsy and serum samples will be shipped to Peregrine Pharmaceuticals 
to complete research studies testing how the drugs you are taking in the study work. 
The samples will not have any personal information on them and shipped with 
codes only known to [CONTACT_333540] C. Yopp.  All left over tissue or serum will be 
destroyed by [CONTACT_333514]. How long can I expect to be in this 
study?  
We will ask you to be in this study for the rest of your life.  You will re ceive the study 
drugs, bavituximab and sorafenib, until your hepatocellular carcinoma shows 
growth based on radiologic (X -ray) tests.  After the initial treatment period, your 
participation in this study will be primarily limited to the follow -up, which is  routine 
for patients with your type of tumor.  
You can choose to stop participating for any reason at any time.  However, if you 
decide to stop participating in the study, we encourage you to tell the researchers.  
You may be asked if you are willing to co mplete some study termination tests.  
 
 
 Current: Version 18 dated 0 7/05/201 6 58 What are the risks of the study?  
Study Procedure/Intervention  
Because of your participation in this study, you are at risk for the following side 
effects. You should discuss these with the researchers and your regular  health care 
provider. The risks of this study are primarily related to the combination 
chemotherapy and the biopsy of your liver tumor.  
Bavituximab  will be given to you as part of this study. Bavituximab is an 
investigational drug.  Because it is an antib ody made of human and mouse proteins, 
some people may experience an allergic reaction to bavituximab.  Possible side 
effects may include rash, hives, itching, shortness of breath, fever, flushing, chills, 
headache, nausea, vomiting, weakness, diarrhea, low  blood pressure, difficulty 
breathing, or anaphylaxis (a severe form of allergic reaction).  To lower the risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_333503](s) before 
each infusion.  
Bavituximab is still being studied in humans  and little is known about the possible 
side effects of bavituximab.  Over [ADDRESS_412214] received bavituximab in research 
studies to date.   
Frequent (Greater than 20% of patients) : 
 Nausea  
 Fatigue  
 Headache  
 Abdominal pain  
  Vomiting  
 
Occasional (<20% of pa tients) : 
 Constipation  
 High blood pressure  
 Cough  
 Anemia (decreased number of red blood cells)  
 Anxiety  
 Dry skin  
 Dizziness  
  Mild nose bleed  
 Nasal dryness  
 Back pain  
 Joint pain  
 Inflammation of the mouth  
 Nail bed bleeding,  
 Chest pain  
 Irregular heartbeat  
 Current: Version 18 dated 0 7/05/201 6 59  Blurred vision  
 Mild disorientation.  
 
Rare but serious (< 2% of patients) : 
 Hypotension (low blood pressure)  
 Ischemic heart disease and he art attack  
 Blood clots involving arteries, veins, and in the lungs;  
 Muscle weakness,  
 Neuropathy (abnormal nerve functio n),  
 Severe diarrhea  
 Severe chest pain requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  
 Fever with low white blood cell count.   
 
Many of these effects occurred in people with advanced cancer who were also 
receiving chemotherapy.  
Animal studies also suggest that bavituximab may cause small clots in arteries found 
in the heart and lungs and/or thickening in arteries found in the heart and lungs.  
Clots may become life -threatening emergencies, especially if they break free in the 
veins or arteries and move to the heart, lungs, or brain, resulting in a heart attack, 
pulmonary embolism, or stroke.  However, clots and thickened arteries were only 
seen in animals given a high enough bavituximab dose to significantly alter their 
clotting t ests.  The risk of both clotting and bleeding complications is unknown for 
the doses of study drug being tested in this study.  As noted above, blood clots 
involving arteries, veins, and lungs have occurred uncommonly in people receiving 
bavituximab for ca ncer.  
 It is possible that in the event of a clotting event, management of appropriate levels 
of anti -clotting drugs may not work as well when given in combination with 
bavituximab.  Your blood pressure and your blood’s ability to form a normal clot will 
be closely monitored at each study visit.  Additionally, if you experience any side 
effects between study visits (for example abdominal pain, bleeding, 
limpness/lameness, swelling, cold -induced symptoms such as Raynaud’s 
phenomenon [such as discoloration o f fingers and toes in response to cold]), 
headache, migraine (including change in severity or pattern of existing migraines), 
bone pain, joint pain, and visual disturbance, you should notify the study doctor 
right away.  
Although uncommon, temporary disorie ntation, blurred vision, hypertension, and 
irregular heartbeat were reported in studies of bavituximab in people with chronic 
hepatitis C infection.  Events usually resolve on their own without treatment and 
additional tests did not reveal any heart damage  or blood clots.  
Sorafenib will be given to you as part of this study.  Sorafenib may cause some, all, or 
none of the side effects listed below.  Sorafenib will be given in a standard fashion 
for people with tumors like yours.

Risks to Sperm, Embryo, Fetus or Breast -fed Inf ant 
Males:  Being in this research may damage your sperm, which could cause harm to a 
child that you may father while on this study. If you take part in this study and are 
sexually active, you must agree to use a medically -acceptable form of birth control. 
Medically -acceptable forms of birth control include:  
 Current: Version 18 dated 0 7/05/201 6 61 (1) surgical sterilization (vasectomy), or  
(2) a condom used with a spermicide (a substance that kills sperm).  
Females:  If you are part of this study while pregnant or breast -feeding an infant, it 
is pos sible that you may expose the unborn child or infant to risks.  For that reason, 
pregnant and breast -feeding females cannot participate in the study.  If you can 
become pregnant, a blood pregnancy test will be done (using 1 teaspoon of blood 
drawn from a v ein by [CONTACT_79825] -stick), and it must be negative before you participate in 
this study. If you take part in this study and you are sexually active, you and any 
person that you have sex with must use medically -acceptable birth control 
(contraceptives) during th e study.  Medically -acceptable birth control 
(contraceptives) includes:  
(1) surgical sterilization (such as hysterectomy or “tubes tied”),  
(2) approved hormonal contraceptives ( such as birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], patch or 
ring; Depo -Provera, Depo -Lupron, Implano n), 
(3) barrier methods (such as condom or diaphragm) used with a spermicide 
(a substance that kills sperm), or  
(4) an intrauterine device (IUD).  
If you do become pregnant during this study, you must tell the researchers 
immediately.  
Risks of Radiation -Diagnostic Test  
The radiation dose that you will get from diagnostic tests is medically indicated for 
your condition and it is the same that you would get if you were not involved in this 
research study.  
Risks of Blood Drawing  
Risks associated with drawing b lood from your arm include minimal discomfort

Instructions:  
Please read this consent form carefully and take your time making a decision about 
whether to participate.  As the researchers discuss this consent form with you, 
please ask him/her to explain any words or information that you do not clea rly 
understand.  The purpose of the study, risks, inconveniences, discomforts, and other 
important information about the study are listed below.  If you decide to participate, 
you will be given a copy of this form to keep.  
Why is this study being done?  
This study is being done to find out whether an investigational (non -FDA approved) 
drug combination including bavituximab and sorafenib can treat hepatocellular 
carcinoma better or more safely than standard medication. The word 
“investigational” means the com bination of bavituximab and sorafenib is still being 
tested in research studies and is not approved by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) for combination treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.  
Sorafenib has been approved by [CONTACT_333533].  
 Current: Version 18 dated 0 7/05/201 6 69 Why is this considered research?  
This is a research study because the combination of bavituximab and sorafenib has 
not been previously used in combination as study drugs for hepatocellular 
carcinoma.  
The following definiti ons may help you understand this study:   
 Standard medical care means the regular care you would receive from your 
personal doctor if you choose not to participate in this research.  
 Researchers means the study doctor  and research personnel at the 
University  of [LOCATION_007] Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas and its affiliated 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].  
Why am I being asked to take part in this research study?  
You are being asked to take part in this study because you have hepatocellular 
carcinoma  and you are participating in treatment portion of this study  
Do I have to take part in this research study?”  
No.  You have the right to choose whether you want to take part in this research 
study.  If you decide to participate and later change your mind, you are free to stop 
participation at any time.  
If you decide not to take part in this research study it will not change your legal 
rights or the quality of health care that you receive at this center.  
How many people will take part in this study?  
About 56 people will take part in this study at UT Southwestern or Parkland Health 
and Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48214].  
What is involved in the study?  
Participation in this study will involve several procedures.  Many of these 
procedures are part of the normal process of treating  tumors such as yours.  
However, some of these procedures can be uncomfortable, inconvenient or painful.  
In addition to the procedures associated with the administration of bavituximab and 
sorafenib as detailed above, you will be asked to participate in o ther procedures as 
part of your involvement in this study.  
Biopsy of liver tumor:  A second biopsy will be collected at the 
5-6 week  visit or  after five to six  dose s of bavituximab   
This second biopsy of the liver tumor  is designed for resear ch and not for  medical 
purposes.  In other words, t hey are not useful for finding problems or diseases.  
Even though the researchers are not looking at your second tumor biopsy to find or 
treat a medical problem, you will be told if they notice something unusual.  You a nd 
your regular doctor can decide together whether to follow up with more tests or 
 Current: Version 18 dated 0 7/05/[ADDRESS_412216] and use your Social Security Number (SSN) in order 
to properly label the sample.  You d o not have to give this information to the 
researchers; it will not affect study participation.  This information will remain 
confidential unless you give your permission to share it with others or if we are 
required by [CONTACT_186168].  
How long can I ex pect to be in this study?  
We will ask you to be in this study for the rest of your life.  After the initial treatment 
period, your participation in this study will be primarily limited to the follow -up, 
which is routine for p atients with your type of tumor  
You can choose to stop participating for any reason at any time.  However, if you 
decide to stop participating in the study, we encourage you to tell the researchers.  
You may be asked if you are willing to complete some study termination tests.  
What are the risks of the study?  
Study Procedure/Intervention  
Because of your participation in this study, you are at risk for the following side 
effects. You should discuss these with the researchers and your regular health care 
provider. The risks of this study a re primarily related to the combination 
chemotherapy and the biopsy of your liver tumor.  
Biopsy of liver tumor  
Prior to receiving bavituximab and sorafenib and five weeks after the study drugs 
have been given one of the tumors in your liver will be biopsie d as part of this study.  
Biopsy of the liver tumor may cause some, all, or none of the side effects listed 
below. The biopsies will be performed in the standard way it performed for patients 
with tumors like yours.  Your radiologist will discuss the risks  of the biopsy with you 
in detail and will ask you to sign a separate consent form.  If a liver biopsy is to be 
performed for clinical care anyway, additional specimen s will be taken for research 
purpose in the same biopsy session.  No additional puncture will be necessary for 
additional specimen, and this is unlikely to significantly increase the overall 
procedure risk.   
 Current: Version 18 dated 0 7/05/201 6 71 Occasional (2 -20% of patients) : 
 Pain at site of biopsy  
 
Rare but serious (< 2% of patients) : 
 Bleeding from liver  
 Leakage of bile from liver  
 Difficulty in breathing  
 Death  
 
Loss of Confidentiality  
Any time information is collected; there is a potential risk for loss of confidentiality.  
Every effort will be made to keep your information confidential; however, this 
cannot be guaranteed.  
Risks to Sperm, Embryo, Fetus or Breast -fed Infant  
Males:  Being in this research may damage your sperm, which could cause harm to a 
child that you may father while on this study. If you take part in this study and are 
sexually active, y ou must agree to use a medically -acceptable form of birth control. 
Medically -acceptable forms of birth control include:

(2) a condom used with a spermicide (a substance that kills sperm).  
Females:  If you are part of this study while pregnant or breast -feeding an infant, it 
is possible that you may expose the unborn child or infant to risks.  For that reason, 
pregnant and breast -feeding females cannot participate in the study.  If you can 
become pregnant, a blood pr egnancy test will be done (using 1 teaspoon of blood 
drawn from a vein by [CONTACT_79825] -stick), and it must be negative before you participate in 
this study. If you take part in this study and you are sexually active, you and any 
person that you have sex with mus t use medically -acceptable birth control 
(contraceptives) during the study.  Medically -acceptable birth control 
(contraceptives) includes:  
(1) surgical sterilization (such as hysterectomy or “tubes tied”),  
(2) approved hormonal contraceptives ( such as bir th control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], patch or 
ring; Depo -Provera, Depo -Lupron, Implanon),  
(3) barrier methods (such as condom or diaphragm) used with a spermicide 
(a substance that kills sperm), or  
(4) an intrauterine device (IUD).  
 Current: Version 18 dated 0 7/05/[ADDRESS_412217] tell the researchers 
immediately.  
Other Risks  
There may possibly be other side effects that are unknown at this time. If you are 
concerned about other, unknown side effects, please discuss this with the 
researchers.  
How will risks be minimized or prevented?    
Study risks will be minimized or prevented by [CONTACT_333530].  Patients will be screened 
prior to enrollment to assure that each patient meets the safety require ments of the 
study.  All treatments will be modified within the study parameters to match your 
treatment needs. These modifications will include the area being treated with 
chemotherapy.  Throughout your participation in the study you will be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_333531], minimize, and treat side effects of your treatment.  
You will be withdrawn from the study if you experience an adverse event which 
causes unacceptable risk as determined by [CONTACT_473]. You will continue to 
receive sta ndard medical care if you are no longer participating in the study.  
What will my responsibilities be during the study?    
While you are part of this study, the researchers will follow you closely to determine 
whether there are problems that need medical car e.  It is your responsibility to do 
the following:  
 Ask questions about anything you do not understand.  
 Keep your appointments.  
 Follow the researchers’ instructions.  
 Let the researchers know if your telephone number or address changes.  
 Store study materials  and sorafenib tablets in a secure place at home away 
from anyone who is unable to read and understand labels, especially 
children.  
 Tell the researchers before you take any new medication, even if it is 
prescribed by [CONTACT_186167] a different medical problem or something 
purchased over the counter.  
 Tell your regular doctor about your participation in this study.  
 Carry information about sorafenib and bavituximab in your purse or wallet.  
 Report to the researchers any injury or illnesses while you are on study even 
if you do not think it is related.  
 
 
 
 Current: Version 18 dated 0 7/05/201 6 73 If I agree to take part in this research study, will I be told of any new risks that 
may be found during the course of the study?  
Yes.  You will be told if any new information becomes available during the s tudy that 
could cause you to change your mind about continuing to participate or that is 
important to your health or safety.  
What should I do if I think I am having problems?  
If you have unusual symptoms, pain, or any other problems while you are in the 
study, you should report them to the researchers right away.  Telephone numbers 
where they can be reached are listed on the first page of this consent form.  
If you have a sudden, serious problem, like difficulty breathing or severe pain, go to 
the nearest ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_9487], or call 911 (or the correct emergency 
telephone number in your area).  Tell emergency personnel about any medications 
you are taking, including any medications you are taking for this study.   
What are the possible benefits of this s tudy?  
If you agree to take part in this study, there may be direct benefits to you.  The 
researchers cannot guarantee that you will benefit from participation in this 
research.  The type of chemotherapy drugs used in this study may be superior to 
standard treatment.  
We hope the information learned from this study will benefit others with 
hepatocellular carcinoma in the future.  Information gained from this research could 
lead to better treatment.   
What options are available if I decide not to take part in this research study?  
You do not have to participate in this research to receive care for your medical 
problem. Instead of being in this study, you have the following options:  
 Evaluation by a medical oncologist for chemotherapy  
 
Please talk to the researche rs or your personal doctor about these options.

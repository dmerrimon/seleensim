STUDY OBJECTIVES  
1. DETERMINING THE SAFETY OF THRIVE FOR LASER LARYNGEAL SURGERY . Current practice involves the use of specialized ETTs or jet 
ventilation catheter ( JVC) that are laser resistant, but not laser proof. One of the major concern s with their use is the possibility of airway 
fire. The “fire triangle” requires the presence o f an o xidizer (O 2), the ignition source (lase r) and the “fuel” (ETT or JVC). If high oxygen 
concentration (FiO 2) is administered to the patient, the airway fire may happen, with devastating consequences. Thus, a decrease in 
oxygen concentration (FiO 2) belo w 30% constitutes current standard of care when ETT or JVC are used. Such low FiO [ADDRESS_108655],  during THRIVE the fuel source (ETT or JVC) is removed, the “fire triangle” is disrupted, and safe administration  of a higher FiO 2 
is possible. Importantly, a completely “tubeless”, non -instrumented surgical field will be greatly enlarged, providing superior operating 
conditions and access to all parts of the glottis. This should improve operating conditions, decreas e surgical time, and potentially lead to 
better patient outcomes.  The safety of THRIVE for laser laryngeal surgery has not been formally investigated, and will be explored in this 
study.  
2. DETERMINING THE SAFE DURATION OF THRIVE FOR VOCAL CORD  LASER SURG ERY.  With the patient anesthetized, apneic, and 
adequately oxygenated with THRIVE, the build up of carbon dioxide in patient’s blood (PaCO 2) and ensuing acute hypercapnic acidosis will 
be the main factors limiting the duration of THRIVE administration. At present, the rate of PaCO 2 rise with THRIVE is suggested to be 
between 1.1 – 1.8 mm Hg per minute . By [CONTACT_98771] , we will be able to determine the rate of PaCO 2 rise during 
THRIVE and provide clinical guidance for safe administration  of THRIVE in the future.  We will allow PaCO 2 to rise to 75  mm Hg, which is 
considered a safe level for moderate hypercapnia in patients without significant comorbidities (see Exclusion Criteria).  
3. DETERMINING THE OPTIMAL VENTILATORY STRATEGY FOR MAINT AINING SAFE PACO 2 LEVEL DURING THRIVE ADMINISTRATION 
ITRAOPERATIVELY.   Once PaCO 2 has exceeded 75  mm Hg, we will administer either the low -frequency or high -frequency supraglottic jet 
ventilation (LFJV, HFJV) through the in situ operating surgical laryngos cope, in or der to counteract hypercapnia. The administration of JV 
modality will be conducted in a randomized fashion, and will continue for at least 10 min, or until PaCO 2 has decreased below  65 mm Hg, 
STUDY  PROTOCOL: THRIVE AND LASER LARYNGEAL SURGERY  
    Prepared by [CONTACT_98770], M.D.  [ADDRESS_108656] of total intravenous anesthesia 
(TIVA), as delivery of anesthetic gases to the patient is not possible. TIVA wi th propofol and remifentanil is commonly used for VC laser 
surgery, and will be employed in this study.  Acute hypercapnia and hypercapnic acidosis have been shown to produce an increa se in 
cardiac output, cardiac index, a decrease in systemic vascular res istance, without associated tachycardia and myocardial depression with 
PaCO 2 ≤ [ADDRESS_108657] significant comorbidities. These hemodynamic responses will be modified by [CONTACT_98772], and we will investigate  the extent of these changes to determine cardiovascular safety of THRIVE used in 
conjunction with TIVA. We will be continuously monitoring the heart rate, arterial blood pressure, cardiac output, cardiac index, and 
systemic vascular resistance during the surge ry using Edwards EV1000 Clinical Platform with FloTrack sensor. Determining hemodynamic 
changes that accompany THRIVE that is conducted under TIVA with propofol and remifentanil will promote safe use of this techn ique in 
clinical anesthesia practice. Using  Edwards EV1000 Clinical Platform we also will assess acute hemodynamic changes that may be 
associated with supraglottic LFJV and HFJV  under the conditions of de liberate moderate hypercapnia. Demonstrating the safety and 
efficacy of THRIVE may make this te chnique a simple , safe  and effective alternative to conventional use of ETT or JV during laser laryngeal 
surgery in selected patients.

41.0 INTRODUCTION
Study Design
Non-randomized Phase II de-escalation clinical trial to establish recurrence rates, site of recurrence,  
survival and quality of life outcomes for early T-stage HPV positive oropharyngeal SCCA treated with 
upfront surgery and reduced dose radiotherapy.  Eligible, consented and registered patients will undergo 
transoral robotic surgery and selective neck dissection. After pathologic evaluation, patients with early 
stage disease as defined below will be placed into surveillance protocol as outlined or assigned to 
adjuvant therapy, depending on risk factors. Patients with intermediate risk factors will receive 
postoperative radiotherapy alone (5000 cGy).  Patients with poor prognostic features will receive 
concurrent chemoradiotherapy (5600 cGy) with weekly cisplatin.  Patients taken off study (based on 
Section 9.2 “Criteria from Removal of Study”) will be followed for survival until the study ends.  Any 
adverse events occurring thereafter in these patients will not be considered related to the study and will 
not be tracked or reported.

62.1 HPV – Related Oropharynx Cancer
The demographics and excellent prognosis of HPV related oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (HPVOPC) 
has called into question the rational for aggressive concurrent chemoradiotherapy for intermediate stage HPV 
related oropharyngeal SCCA. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_709099] a significant increase in the incidence of 
oropharynx cancer (OPC) in North America and Europe. Molecular studies of oropharyngeal tumors have 
revealed that this increase is due to an increase in the incidence of tumors which contain Human Papi[INVESTIGATOR_28597] 
(HPV), most specifically HPV16 and for which there is direct evidence that HPV16 is the molecular cause 
mechanistically driving the development and viability of the cancer cells. HPV-related oropharynx cancer 
(HPVOPC) now accounts for almost 60% of OPC seen in the [LOCATION_003] and an increasing fraction of these 
malignancies in Europe 1-3.  
Based on the existing data from clinical trials and patient material through retrospective analysis, it is now 
understood that there are two dominant carcinogenic and biologic pathways where oropharynx cancer 
develops: Environmentally related OPC (EROPC), caused principally by [CONTACT_709136], and HPV 
related OPC (HPVOPC).  The relative paucity of genetic changes in HPV-positive head and neck cancer is in 
sharp contrast to what is observed in HPV-negative head and neck cancer and is mechanistically related to the 
direct effects of viral proteins in inactivating regulators of key cellular processes4-7. In the typi[INVESTIGATOR_709100], 
mutations and deletions of p53 have very frequently been demonstrated. In contrast, HPVOPC do not contain 
p53 mutations. Similarly, p16 in the Rb pathway of cell growth is frequently mutated, deleted or silenced in 
EROPC but is often up-regulated in HPVOPC as a consequence of viral alterations in Rb function. Up 
regulation of p16 can be seen in up to 20% of non-HPV related cancers including other sites in the head and 
neck, however, p16 appears to be up-regulated in >95% of HPVOPC making it a good screening tool8.
Studies in unselected patients suggest that patients with HPVOPC have a better prognosis than patients with 
HPV-negative, predominantly environmentally related OPC (EROPC) 9-11.  In one retrospective study of 
radiotherapy as sole therapy from Denmark, p16 was used as a surrogate for HPV. In this randomized study 
of a radiation sensitizer, the control arm of radiotherapy only was analyzed for p16 expression. There was 62% 
5-year survival among p16+ patients compared to 26% in p16- patients. LRC was 58% vs. 28%, respectively
(Figure 1). A significant fraction of p16+ tumors were not of oropharyngeal origin 12.
A second trial, Licitra et al retrospectively evaluated surgery in the HPV positive and negative cases. Surgery 
alone was effective therapy for a small group of patients.  Patients who underwent surgery as a single modality 
were spared the long term consequences of radiation. However, selection criteria for surgery alone was not 
well explained13.

Recently, results of retrospective analyses of survival and HPV status were reported from two International 
Phase III trials comparing chemoradiotherapy (CRT) regimens in locally advanced HNC. In both trials there 
were insufficient patient numbers to report a treatment effect; however the impact of HPV on survival, 
regardless of therapeutic assignment, was highly significant 8,14. The RTOG (R) 01-[ADDRESS_964083] extensive 
data and retrospectively analyzed on 323 out of 433 OPC cases.  In RTOG 01-29, patients were randomized 
between CRT with accelerated fractionation with cisplatin versus regular fractionation and cisplatin. The 
overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) at three years were 82%and 74% in HPVOPC 
compared to 57% and 43% for EROPC, respectively. A careful analysis of failure and death revealed a LRF 
rate of 14% versus 35% for HPVOPC versus EROPC and a second primary tumor rate of 6% versus 15% 
respectively. Non-cancer deaths also occurred in 9% and 19% respectively. All these data support a better 
outcome for HPVOPC, much of which is found in improved LRC, some of which is explained by [CONTACT_709137]-
morbidity.
2.2 Transoral Surgery and HPV Related Oropharynx Cancer
Robotic surgery has been widely applied in the medical field and the FDA has approved several 
applications including: laparoscopic surgery (2000),  prostate surgery (2001),  thorascopic surgery (2001),  
mitral valve surgery (2002). More recently, investigators began exploring the feasibility of transoral robotic 
surgery in the oropharynx.  Hockstein et al. studied the use of the robot in an airway mannequin and determined 
that it was feasible to access both the oropharynx and the larynx using the Da Vinci robot and both the 5 mm 
and 8mm instrument arms.15 In a subsequent report, the same group demonstrated that several surgical 
procedures including a tongue base resection and several laryngeal procedures were technically feasible using 
the Da Vinci robot system.16  Hockstein further demonstrated that effective hemostasis of the extensive 
pharyngeal vasculature was achievable using a combination of cautery and robotically applied hemoclips to 
control the lingual artery.17
Effective Date: 2/14/2022
End Date:2/7/[ADDRESS_964084] for 
several preliminary clinical cohort studies.  O’Malley et al. described the first series of TORS tongue base 
resections for squamous cell carcinoma.[ADDRESS_964085] series of TORS cases for radical tonsillectomy on 27 
patients.21 The technical aspects of the surgery were described to allow for negative margin resection of tonsil 
malignancies while protecting the internal carotid artery in the parapharyngeal space. In this early series, all 
patients had gastrostomy tubes inserted prophylactically and one patient had planned tracheostomy. An 
additional patient had unexpected tracheostomy following exacerbation of pre-existing obstructive sleep 
apnea.  The surgical complication rate was 19% including one mucosal hemorrhage requiring a return to the 
operating room, one tracheostomy, two patients developed trismus, and one patient developed hypernasality 
requiring an outpatient procedure for correction. Genden et al. and the Mount Sinai group published their 
institutional experience with their first 20 transoral robotic surgery cases.22  Two cases were aborted due to 
inadequate access and the remaining 18 cases consisted of 7 tonsil lesions, 4 tongue base lesions, 4 supraglottic 
lesions, 2 parapharyngeal lesions and 1 palate lesion.  Patients did not require prophylactic gastrostomy tubes, 
and oral diet was achieved on 1.4 days after surgery on average.  Patients were discharged on average 1.7 days 
after surgery.23 These investigations lead to FDA approval of transoral robotic surgery in 2009.
Functional Outcomes 
Proponents of transoral robotics surgery for oropharynx cancer contend that it offers improved 
functional outcomes when compared to non-surgical treatment with radiation therapy with or without 
chemotherapy.  Many of the functional limitations incurred by [CONTACT_709138].  A recent retrospective analysis of three RTOG trials suggested that the rate of severe late toxicities 
in patients receiving chemoradiotherapy is 43% for all subjects, and 35% for patients with oropharyngeal 
cancer.24 This group defined late toxicities as grade 3 or 4 pharyngeal/laryngeal toxicity, feeding tube 
dependence at 2 or more years from treatment, and/or treatment related death (grade 5 toxicity).  Another 
prospective study of 104 patients (72 oropharyngeal cancers) found that 26.4% of patients are feeding tube 
dependent at one year, and 13.8% were tracheotomy dependent (although less commonly for oropharyngeal 
cancers).25  These numbers are considerably better in modern practice, and only 5-12% of patients remain PEG 
dependent in more recent studies. In patients undergoing TORS and selective neck dissection, pathologic data 
can provide staging information that may allow for tailoring treatment to the individual and obviate the need 
for unnecessary toxic adjuvant treatments.  Additionally, patients with unfavorable pathologic criteria are 
identified and more intense adjuvant therapy may be applied more appropriately.
Several studies report favorable swallowing outcomes using TORS for resection of oropharyngeal 
cancers.21,22,26-29  Genden et al. reported all patients (n=20) tolerated an oral diet at a mean 1.4 days after surgery 
without any patients requiring gastrostomy tubes, in patients who did not receive adjuvant CCRT.22  Iseli et al. 
performed TORS on 54 patients, and 83% of their patients were tolerating a diet within 14 days, 17% required 
a feeding tube at 12 months follow-up, and 5.6% of patients demonstrated signs or symptoms of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].29  
Moore et al. performed TORS on 45 patients, and 82% of patients were tolerating an oral diet by [CONTACT_709139]-
operative visit.  Seventeen percent of patients required a feeding tube, but none required assistance with feeding 
at one year follow-up.28 Hurtuk et al also described an early return to oral diet with all 54 patients in their study 
tolerating oral diet on the day of surgery.27  They reported, 20% of their patients requiring feeding tubes mainly 
during adjuvant therapy. In these studies, tracheostomy rates varied from 0-31% of patients requiring 
temporary tracheostomy tubes, more commonly for supraglottic or laryngeal malignancies.21,22,28,29  However, 
the majority of patients were decannulated within two weeks and no patients required tracheotomy tubes at 
one year follow-up.

End Date:2/7/[ADDRESS_964086]-treatment (72 vs. 43; p=0.008 and 43 vs. 25; p=0.01).[ADDRESS_964087] reported local failure rates which varied 
between 0-3% with median follow-up rates ranging from 18 months to two years.26,31-33 Regional recurrence 
rates in the same studies varied between 2-8%, while distant disease was identified in 1-9% of patients.26,31-33  
Eighte
en month overall survival was 90% in one study31, and two-year overall survival was 82% and 80.6% 
in two other studies.26,32  While many investigations include large proportions of HPV+ oropharyngeal 
malignancies, Cohen et. al. stratified survival by [CONTACT_709140] 81% in the HPV+ group and 80% in the HPV-.  Two year disease-specific survival rates were 90% 
and 92.6%, respectively .26,32  Meanwhile 18 month recurrence free survival rates were 78% and  two year 
rates were 79% and 86.3% respectively.26,32,[ADDRESS_964088] to evaluate the role of de-intensification of 
therapy.43  The Easter Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) and the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 
(RTOG) both have studies investigating de-intensified therapy.  The former group is investigating the role of 
induction therapy with dose-reduced radiation while the latter group is conducting a phase III randomized  
controlled trial comparing standard chemoradiation with cisplatin to radiation and cetuximab in HPV positive 
patients. 
In addition, more recent data has prompted changes in the AJCC staging system for HPV related 
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.[ADDRESS_964089] of the number of 
cervical lymph nodes appears less important than previously realized. This has prompted the addition of a 
cutoff group of >6 nodes (as proposed in the new AJCC staging system, see SIRS Groups IIIA,IIIB) for a 
marker for more advanced disease, thereby [CONTACT_709141]. In addition, this proposed 
staging system which will be implemented in 2018 has now been validated by [CONTACT_709142]: 2/14/2022
End Date:2/7/[ADDRESS_964090] radiation for local 
regional control, reserving “salvage” chemoradiotherapy for local regional failure and sparing a large fraction 
of patients the morbidity and mortality of radiotherapy. 
2.3 Rationale for Single Modality Treatment of Early stage HPV related OPSCC 
In general, patients with HPVOPC are young and will live for prolonged periods. They are at high risk for 
long-term toxicity and mortality from therapy24. While the long-term consequences of chemotherapy for head 
and neck cancer are relatively constrained, high-dose radiotherapy (RT) and chemoradiotherapy substantially 
impact on local tissues and organ function and result in a significant rate of late mortality and morbidity in 
patients48-51. Studies are now being designed to reduce the impact of RT and CRT for patients. 
There are currently few trials examining the role of de-escalation using surgery alone in early T-stage HPV 
related disease or reduced radiotherapy in intermediate risk patients.  New surgical techniques have broadened 
the range of patients capable of achieving a complete resection and the functional outcomes in such patients. 
Furthermore, the sensitivity of HPVOPC to chemotherapy and radiotherapy raise the possibility that delayed 
or salvage treatment in early stage patients would be highly effective, would result in similar survival outcomes 
and could be applied to a much smaller population then current standards call for. Looked at from a different 
perspective, the need for post-operative radiotherapy in this younger, HPV+ and more functional population 
have not been validated in clinical trials to date. 
2.4 Histological Requirements
Patient selection for the SIRS trial will include squamous cell carcinomas of head and neck classified as 
oropharynx that are both positive for HPV16 or any high risk HPV subtype (i.e. 18, 33, 35, etc.) by [CONTACT_4480] 
p16 positive1,52. Tissue for confirmation of p16 status and confirmatory HPV-PCR and will be required and 
analyzed at a central laboratory. Although p16 has been found to be a potential independent risk factor for 
prognosis, and a negative p16 is highly predictive of a negative HPV test, about 20% of HNC tumors are p16 
positive independent of HPV presence. Because the biologic behavior of this population may be heterogeneous 
and is less well understood, p16- or p16+ HPV- patients will be excluded from the trial. Similarly, 90% of 
HPV positive oropharynx cancer is HPV16+, and the behavior of other serotypes is unknown. Hence this study 
will be limited to HPV16+ cancers, and cancers from high risk HPV subtypes will be analyzed in a separate 
group. Testing for p16 will be performed and/or reviewed in the central laboratory.
In addition, smoking has been shown to be a prognostic factor in HPVOPC53. In the SIRS trial, patients with 
a history of > 20 pack years and recent (within 5 years) tobacco abuse will be excluded, as this is a known 
negative prognostic factor and the role of adjuvant therapy in smoking related HPVOPC is currently being 
examined in other investigations.
2.5 Correlative Studies Background
It is still not well understood as to what biological factors influence the growth and response to treatment of 
HPVOPC tumors.  Current research strongly suggests that there are multiple pathways that may account for 
the difference in growth and treatment response between HPVOPC and non-HPVOPC tumors.  Furthermore, 
there are several mechanisms reported in the literature that may account for differences in survival within the 
HPVOPC subset of patients.  The advantage of surgical trials in this arena is the availability of high quality 
tissue specimens for analysis.

End Date:2/7/[ADDRESS_964091] also shown HPV copy number to be linked to better response to treatment and improved 
OS7.  p16 will be measured as a marker for HPV status, as it is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, which acts 
to inhibit pRb phosphorylation, thus blocking cell cycle progression.  The inactivation of pRb by [CONTACT_709143] p16, making it a good marker for HPV status.  Additionally, high EGFR expression, low 
p53, as well as high Bcl-xL (an antiapoptotic protein) expression are factors that may indicate poor response 
to treatment and poor outcomes.  This study will seek to analyze these factors, as well as proteins that are often 
mutated in cell signaling pathways, such as cMET, in order to further correlate these proteins with treatment 
response.

(i.e., no history of smoking/alcohol, age range, etc.). To be assigned to a group and participate in the 
experimental portion of the trial, surgery must be performed at MSSM, tumor tissue must be available, and 
both p16 and HPV status must be assessed and proven to be positive for HPV 16 or any high risk HPV subtype

4.0 REGISTRATION PROCEDURES 
After the patient signs the informed consent the patient will be registered for screening and once the 
investigator has verified that the patient meets all inclusion/exclusion criteria, the patient will be registered for 
and started on the protocol. Patients who lack p16 and HPV PCR may proceed to surgery however they will 
not be assigned to an experimental group and registered on the protocol until p16 IHC and HPV PCR are 
completed and positive. The verification of patient’s eligibility and screening completion will be performed 
centrally after the receipt of the patient primary post-surgical registration form.  It is mandatory not to exceed 
21 days between the date of registration for screening and the start of the study treatment (surgery).  In any 
case, all events occurring after the registration for therapy must be recorded in the case report form and will 
be taken into account in the analysis, whether the patient received the study treatment or not.  Patient must 
receive surgery and be p16 IHC and HPV PCR positive to be included in the intent to treat analysis. Patients 
found to not meet entry criteria will be offered best therapy.

registration and assignment to treatment group. Issues that would cause treatment delays should be 
discussed with the Principal Investigator. If a participant does not receive protocol therapy and assignment 
treatment following registration, the participant’s protocol status must be changed to registered not treated. 
Notify the registrar of participant status changes as soon as possible. Patients who are eligible and do not 
receive study surgery will be analyzed in a separate cohort.
4.2 Registration Process 
The registration procedures are as follows:
1.Obtain written informed consent from the participant prior to the performance of any study related
screening procedures or assessments and register consent and register the patient for screening.
2.Complete the protocol-specific screening and eligibility checklist using the eligibility assessment
documented in the participant’s medical/research record. To be eligible for registration to the surgery
on study, the participant must meet each inclusion and exclusion criteria listed on the eligibility
checklist, however p16 and HPV PCR results need not be necessary.
3. Patients will be re-registered for post-surgical adjuvant treatment assignment as per the protocol
design and will require final p16 IHC and HPV PCR for this. Pathologic criteria as outlined in the
protocol will determine the post-surgical adjuvant arm assignment.

CT/PET. Formal operative endoscopy with biopsy under general anesthesia will be performed as indicated 
when diagnostic or staging dilemma occurs. A preoperative tissue biopsy will be taken and used for 
histopathological analysis and assignment of p16 status and, if possible,  HPV status. All biopsies performed 
outside the institution will be internally reviewed by [CONTACT_709148]. All patients will be presented and 
reviewed at multidisciplinary tumor board. Final staging will be performed according to standard 8th Edition 
AJCC TNM criteria.
Surgical Intervention
Patients who meet inclusion criteria and are surgical candidates will be consented for primary 
surgical therapy. Surgery will include transoral robotic resection of the tumor with negative 
intraoperative frozen section margins. Selective neck dissection of levels II-IV will be performed 
routinely ipsilateral to the primary tonsillar tumors.  Bilateral selective neck dissection of levels II-
IV will be performed for all tongue base tumors. Additional levels (i.e. I,V) will be performed at the 
discretion of the operating surgeon if indicated on the size and location of the primary tumor.  
Appropriate reconstruction will be performed at the time of tumor resection as deemed necessary by 
[CONTACT_67361].

CONFIDENTIAL
This document is confidential. Do not disclose or use except as authorized.
17Photon beams of >4 MV are required.  Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) is required for all cases. 
IMRT via dynamically moving leaves, step-and-shoot with a multileaf collimator, Rapid Arc, binary multileaf 
collimator and tomotherapy are allowed.  Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) and proton 
therapy are not allowed.
Immobilization, Simulation, and Localization
A thermoplastic head mask (or similar immobilization device) is required for IMRT.  Bite blocks, dental rolls 
and other set-up techniques may be used at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist.  A treatment 
planning CT scan is mandatory for defining target volumes.  IV contrast is not required for the treatment 
planning CT.  CT scan thickness should be <0.[ADDRESS_964104] slice. 
Treatment Planning/Target Volumes
Gross Tumor Volume (GTV)
Since radiotherapy will be given postoperatively there should not be any gross disease and therefore no GTV.  
Clinical Target Volume (CTV) –  Group II and IIIA
The clinical target volume (CTV) is generated to account for microscopic disease.  CTV50 may include the 
primary tumor bed and/or lymph node regions in the neck at risk for harboring microscopic disease.  CTV50 
should not include bone or air.  There will be only one CTV (CTV50) for patients in  Group II and IIIA.
Clinical Target Volume (CTV) – Group IIIB
CTV56 is generated to account for areas at highest risk of harboring microscopic disease (positive margin or 
positive ECS >1mm).  If there is a positive margin, CTV56 should encompass the primary tumor bed.  If there 
is extracapsular spread >1mm, CTV56 should encompass the operative bed of the lymph node that was found 
to have ECS.  Group IIIB will have a second CTV, called CTV50.4.  CTV50.4 is generated to account for 
areas at lower risk for harboring microscopic disease than CTV56.  CTV50.4 may include the primary tumor 
bed (if negative margin) and/or lymph node regions (if no ECS) in the neck.  CTV56 and CTV50.4 should not 
include bone or air.  There are 2 CTVs for the Group IIIB(CTV56 and CTV50) which will be treated with a 
simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) technique.
Planning Target Volume (PTV)
PTV incorporates a margin that accounts for daily set up variation. The PTV should be a 0.[ADDRESS_964105]: Maximum dose <[ADDRESS_964106] ([ADDRESS_964107]): Maximum dose <50 Gy
C. Brainstem: Maximum dose <54 Gy
D. Parotid glands: Mean dose <26 Gy. If this is not possible due to adjacent disease, then the volume of
one parotid gland receiving 30 Gy or more (V30) should be <50%.

PTV50.4 will be treated to a total dose of 50.4 in 1.8 Gy/fraction.
PTV56 and PTV50.[ADDRESS_964109] (SIB) technique.
PTV Coverage 
All plans must be normalized such that 95% of the PTV is covered with the prescription dose.  No more than 
20% of the PTV may receive > 110 % of the prescription dose.  No more than 1% of the PTV may receive < 
93% of the prescription dose.  No more than 1cc of tissue outside the PTV may receive > 110% of the 
prescription dose. 
Note: in any case with a conflict/overlap between target and normal tissue, target dose considerations will take 
priority, with the exception of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_709103].
Treatment Breaks
There are no planned treatment breaks on this study; any breaks in planned radiotherapy are strongly 
discouraged. Radiotherapy interruptions will be permitted for unavoidable mechanical malfunction or serious 
illness requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], such as sepsis, delirium, severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_709104], at the discretion of the Principal Investigator. Treatment breaks should be as short as possible. The 
reason for any interruption in treatment must be documented in the treatment chart.
Quality Assurance
Initial:  Prior to the first radiation treatment, the standard quality assurance procedures will be followed. The 
monitor units required to deliver the prescribed dose shall be calculated. The monitor units generated by [CONTACT_709149]’s first treatment.  Measurements in

practice.
Weekly:  Verification portal images will be taken at least once per week and approved by a radiation oncologist 
prior to continuation of treatment per standard practice.
Isodose Distribution 
All plans will have complete documentation in the patient’s chart, including representative CT slices with 
treatment isodoses. A DVH with all PTV and CTV structures and all normal tissue structures will be generated 
for each patient and documented in the patient’s radiotherapy chart.
Quality Assurance:
Each treatment plan will be reviewed by [CONTACT_709150]-treating radiation oncologist prior to therapy to assure 
that the appropriate fields and doses will be delivered.

accessed until the study is complete. 
1) T Cell specificity and Function in HPV Oropharynx Cancer
It is possible that preserved or improved immune responses in HPVOC patients may protect 
against distant metastases, second primaries or recurrence or may mediate some portion of 
the responsiveness. We have identified immunogenic HLA-A2-restricted peptides derived 
from HPV16E6 and E7 (Reimer, Anderson, and Reinherz, unpublished data). Here, we will 
evaluate pre and post therapy T cell function towards HPV peptides by [CONTACT_709152], clinical response and tumor control. We hypothesize 
that cured patients will have a more robust response after therapy has completed and we 
may identify preferred peptide epi[INVESTIGATOR_709107]/or response.
2) Serologic assessments
We have developed a novel multiplex antibody assay using the Luminex system that allows 
us to establish the titers of complex and seemingly heterogeneous antibody responses to 
the full genome of HPV16. Using this system we will monitor the antibody response of the 
HPVOC prior to, and [ADDRESS_964120] tumor control, and 
can establish patterns that might be useful in predicting the development of cancers.
3) Tissue microarrays
There will be distinct differences between primary tumors and metastatic, nodal and 
persistent disease in patients. We will use TMA to evaluate biomarkers and tumor 
differences that can be used to predict metastatic behavior and response. While tumor 
control is frequently a process related to tumor volume, those cells that can metastasize 
may have a distinct signature [CONTACT_709173] a pathway that can be exploited for better 
anti-tumor therapy, could be identified in small numbers of tumor cells, might be present 
in CTC, etc. This is exploratory study data set.

will be less than 200 mls of whole blood (46ml at baseline, 3 month (or pre-XRT) and 24 months; 16 
ml at  6, 12, and 36 months).  Blood will be collected in 1x 6ml red top tube and 4 x 10ml green top 
tubes at baseline, 3 month (or pre-XRT) and at the 24 month visit. Only 1 red top tube and one green 
top tube will be collected at the 6 month, 12 month, and 36 month visits.   Processing and labeling of

26the blood will be done according to the “Blood Handling” section outlined below.  Lag time between 
collection and the start of processing will be within 5 hours and this time will be recorded for each 
sample.  Components will be stored from these tubes including serum, plasma and buffy coat.  If 
collected and handled properly, each of the tubes should yield approximately 3mls of serum.  Serum 
will be maintained as 1ml aliquots and frozen and stored at –80C and buffy coat will be stored from 
green tubes, at local institutional temperature guidelines.  A portion of each of these samples will be 
stored at the biospecimen repository, and a portion maintained at this facility, until exhausted.  Samples 
will be labeled a code linked to the patient case report form. All patients will have tumor testing for 
HPV and p16 in a central laboratory as part of their screening. Slides and microarrays from tumor 
tissues will be labeled similarly as blood samples above. 
Blood Handling
Blood collection will be performed before surgery (if necessary) and in the absence of any systemic 
anesthesia.
Samples (6 ml of blood/tube) will be obtained at each visit as noted, according to the table below for

10’ at 4C and the serum removed by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_42115].  Serum will be stored in 1ml aliquots.  All samples 
will be stored at -80C.  White blood cell fraction will be stored in a single tube at local institutional 
temperature guidelines and kept locally. 
Tissue Collection
All patients will have their tumors tested for HPV and p16 in the central laboratory at at Icahn School 
of Medicine at Mount Sinai per current standard protocol. Paraffin embedded and formalin fixed 
blocks from the original and subsequent biopsy specimens will be sent to the laboratory and will be 
cut in his laboratory for PCR testing and IHC. The primary untreated tumor will be tested for HPV 
and p16 prior to the start of radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy. 
Additional slides, from 5-20, and tissue microarrays will be cut from the blocks and stored in the 
Mount Sinai Biorepository before they are returned to the site. Any additional biopsies from the 
primary tumor or a recurrence will be obtained and handled in the same fashion.

12.0 ASSESSMENT OF QUALITY OF LIFE AND PATIENT REPORTED SYMPTOMS
Head and neck cancer often arises in cosmetically or functionally important areas. Thus, the ability to eat, 
speak, breathe easily, as well as the patient’s overall sense of comfort is frequently affected by [CONTACT_48831]. In 
addition to these disease-specific symptoms, patients with head and neck cancer may also experience 
symptoms related to surgery (e.g. disfigurement) or to radiation therapy (e.g., dysphagia, xerostomia, and 
mucositis). These may lead to feeling of general overall sickness and can potentially result in social isolation. 
Patient-reported symptoms tend to be more severe than those recorded by [CONTACT_13922], patient reported outcome 
instruments are increasingly being used to measure symptom burden, functionality and quality of life. It can 
provide more comprehensive and improved toxicity data. Quality of life (QOL) assessment is a multi-
dimensional construct that involves an individual’s subjective assessment of the impact of an illness or 
treatment on his/her physical, psychological, social, and somatic functioning and general well-being. The 
European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core measure (EORTC QLQ-C30) is a well 
validated cancer-specific QOL scale that is used as a generic measurement for patients with cancer that in head 
and neck patients is used in conjunction with the site specific measurement tool EORTC QLQ H&N35. The 
M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory-Head and Neck (MDASI-HN) module is a validated instrument that
provides a brief measure of the symptom distress experienced by [CONTACT_709153] a result
of their disease and/or treatment. This symptom burden instrument was closely associated with the severity of
radiation-induced mucositis. The MDA Xerostomia and Dysphagia questionnaires are radiotherapy/head and
neck cancer directed questions which have a robust, validated assessment the specific concerns of swallowing
and salivary function in head and neck cancer treated patients.

31In this study, patients will complete the EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ H&N35, MDASI-HN, the MDADI-
HN (dysphagia) and xerostomia questionnaires prior to therapy and then at  3, 6,  12 and every 12  months 
after therapy for 5 years for all patients. During the concomitant chemo-radiation phase of treatment, in order 
to avoid patient fatigue, the EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ H&N35, MDASI-HN module, MDADI-HN 
(dysphagia) and xerostomia questionnaires will be completed on pre and weeks 5, [ADDRESS_964127] rx 3 months; and

assessments in conjunction with adverse events assessments to compare the experiment and control arms of 
this study.
13.0   ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
13.1 Definitions
13.1.1 Adverse Event (AE)
An adverse event (AE) is any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition or experience that develops or 
worsens in severity after starting the first dose of study treatment or any procedure specified in the protocol, 
even if the event is not considered to be related to the study. 
Abnormal laboratory values or diagnostic test results constitute adverse events only if they induce clinical 
signs or symptoms or require treatment or further diagnostic tests. 
13.1.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event, occurring at any dose and regardless of causality that:

32Is life-threatening. Life-threatening means that the person was at immediate risk of death from the reaction
as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction which hypothetically might have caused death had it
occurred in a more severe form.
Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (i.e., the event required at least a 24-hour hospi[INVESTIGATOR_709108] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57892]). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6930]/or
surgical operations scheduled to occur during the study period, but planned prior to study entry are not
considered SAEs if the illness or disease existed before the person was enrolled in the trial, provided that
it did not deteriorate in an unexpected manner during the trial (e.g., surgery performed earlier than
planned).
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Disability is defined as a substantial disruption of
a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.
Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or
Is an important medical event when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the
participant and require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an
emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],
or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
Events not considered to be serious adverse events are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315]:
Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any deterioration in
condition, or for elective procedures.
Elective or pre-planned treatment for a pre-existing condition that did not worsen.
Emergency outpatient treatment for an event not fulfilling the serious criteria outlined above and not
resulting in inpatient admission.
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594].
13.1.3 Expectedness
Adverse events can be 'Expected' or 'Unexpected.' 
13.1.3.1Expected adverse event
Expected adverse events are those that have been previously identified as resulting from administration of the 
agent. For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered expected when it appears in the current 
adverse event list, the Investigator’s Brochure, the package insert or is included in the informed consent 
document as a potential risk.  
Refer to Section 6.1 for a listing of expected adverse events associated with the study agent(s).
[IP_ADDRESS] Unexpected adverse event
For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered unexpected when it varies in nature, intensity or 
frequency from information provided in the current adverse event list, the Investigator’s Brochure, the package 
insert or when it is not included in the informed consent document as a potential risk.  
13.1.4.Attribution
Attribution is the relationship between an adverse event or serious adverse event and the study treatment. 
Attribution will be assigned as follows:

statistician shall be  a member. The chairman of the DSMB will prepare minutes and report to the DSMC. The 
study report will remain blinded for efficacy results unless there is sufficient reason for the DSMB to consider 
halting the trial. 
The DSMB will meet semi-annually and/or more often if required to review toxicity and accrual data.  
Information to be provided to the committee may include: up-to-date participant accrual; all unexpected 
adverse events that have been reported; summary of all surgical complications or deaths while being treated 
and during active follow-up; any response information; audit results, and a summary provided by [CONTACT_123894]. Other information (e.g. scans, laboratory values) will be provided upon request.  
Adverse Events. safety data, including all protocol-defined and serious unanticipated adverse events, will be 
collected throughout the entire course of the study. Expedited reporting to the IRB and study sponsor will be 
required for any unexpected serious adverse event. 
Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
All investigators NHLBI must report both expected (protocol defined) and unexpected serious adverse events. 
All serious adverse events must be reported directly to the clinical center’s IRB within [ADDRESS_964139] semi-annually, at the discretion of the DSMB. In addition, the investigators 
are expected to comply with their institutional policies and reporting requirements.
After recruitment of half of the study subjects (100) a full dataset analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_709155]. 
This will include statistical analysis of adverse events, recurrence rates after surgical therapy, outcomes of 
adjuvant therapy arms, and disease specific survival. Deviation from the proposed recurrence rates or overall 
disease specific survival will result in halting the trial. The primary endpoints are DFS and LRC at [ADDRESS_964140] therapy and the experimental therapy groups. 
Ninety-percent one-sided confidence intervals will be calculated for DFS at 3 and 5 years in the surgical and 
surgical/adjuvant therapy groups.  The secondary endpoint of overall survival will be analyzed using Kaplan-
Meier curves and a log-rank test for the difference between the two therapy groups. Five year OAS, DFS and 
LRC will be calculated using a log-rank test will be used to test for differences between the two treatment 
groups. Toxicity is another secondary endpoint. We will compute for each arm the toxicity rate and provide 
the corresponding 90% confidence intervals based on the exact binomial distribution.

of the trial will be included as appropriate: study coordinators, data managers, research nurses, sub-
investigators, collaborators (if applicable), and the statistician. The timing of these meetings will be at minimal 
quarterly, but more frequent during initial accrual, adverse event reporting, or at any time at the discretion of 
the Participating Site or Coordinating site.
During these meetings, matters related to the following will be discussed: enrollment rate relative to 
expectation, characteristics of participants, retention of participants, adherence to protocol (potential or real 
protocol violations), validity and integrity of the data, toxicities, surgical complications, unanticipated barriers, 
acquisition of serum samples and transfer to lab, and progress of data for objectives. Any other issue related

discussions will be provided to the appropriate personel, and if applicable, formal action plans.
16.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
16.1 Study Design/Endpoints
This is a prospective clinical trial evaluating surgery alone for early stage HPV related oropharyngeal 
squamous cell carcinoma. The primary endpoints are the rate of local-regional control OAS, and PFS at 3 years 
in patients with HPV 16 and p16+ related head and neck cancer, treated with surgery alone.  The secondary 
objectives include [ADDRESS_964146]-operative radiotherapy (>85%) and that LRC without 
radiotherapy will be > 50%. Additional Hypotheses relate to Group [ADDRESS_964147]-operative radiotherapy (>85%) and that LRC will 
be > 85%. 
16.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate
Sample size justification:
The proposed sample size of 100 for Group 1 has been determined to ensure that an upper bound 
for recurrence may be estimated with adequate precision, defined as within 8-12% of the true 
recurrence rate. The upper bound is estimated by [CONTACT_709160], assuming a non-informative beta(1,1) prior distribution. The table below provides 
the upper 95% bound (from the Bayesian credible interval) assuming the true rate of recurrence is 
.1,.2,.3,.4, or .5 and 100 patients are studied.

The various specific aims outlined in Aim 1 share a common objective: determining rates of important 
measures of treatment response (progression-free survival, overall survival, local regional control and 
ultimate disease control) for patients  treated  with surgery alone and compare them to those expected in 
patients with similar diagnostic criteria.  We will assess this overall objective by [CONTACT_2329] a Bayesian approach 
to estimate the posterior probability distributions for each respective sub-aim based on observed outcomes.   
This approach permits estimating probabilities with which a specified rate of interest exceeds a threshold 
value (e.g.; 50% local regional control, 85% overall survival, etc.)  
Our approach begins with the premise that surgery alone offers no improvement in expected outcomes. This 
is an exact correspondence to a “null hypothesis”. We incorporate this assumption through a prior 
distribution for each suspected rate; for example, for Group I patients we would assume that the rate of local 
regional control (LRC) at three years is 50%. After the studies are conducted, each respective rate is 
combined with the "null"  prior distribution through Bayes’ Theorem to yield the posterior distribution for 
the rate.  The table below depi[INVESTIGATOR_709116] (theta) using 100 patients based on 
two differing assumptions: that LRC at three years is 50% (p=0.5 shown on the left) and 85% (p=0.85 shown 
on the right).  
Our expected sample size of 100 for Group I patients ensures that the inter-quartile range for the estimated 
probability distributions will extend from approximately 10-12 percentage points. This range is wider for 
smaller sample sizes (e.g. 30 or 50) but still less than 20 percentage points.

for DFS at 3 and 5 years in the surgical and surgical/adjuvant therapy groups.

Setting of Human Research
Valley Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/Valley Health System/Blumenthal Cancer Center
The Valley Health System (VHS) is comprised of three entities: The Valley Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (TVH), 
Valley Home Care, and Valley Physician Services. TVH is a private, not-for-profit hospi[INVESTIGATOR_709131].  It is a fully accredited, [ADDRESS_964154] research infrastructure. In 2013, research 
administration and clinical trials were centralized to form The Valley Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_709132] (TORC). This support translates into over 25 dedicated research FTEs and a 
total operating budget of over $3M annually.  TORC’s programs include, the Human 
Subjects Protection Program (HSPP), Research Administration and Sponsored Programs 
(RASP), Clinical Trials & Research Program (CTRP), and the Translational Research 
Program (TRP) which houses the institutions core facilities and robust biorespositories, 
including the Oncology Biorepository and the Cardiac Bio-registry for Translational 
Research (CBTR). 
HSPP provides the institution with regulatory policies and procedures, the IRB, regulatory 
education and training and the continual improvement processes. Valley received AAHRPP 
accreditation of its HSPP in June of 2016. RASP regulates all pre and post award activities, 
contract negotiation, coverage anaylsis, budget development and implements the cost 
accounting principles for federal awards and oversees the clinical trials management systems 
for the institution. The CTRP includes dedicated outpatient clinical research facilities and 
research coordination staff. The TRP is located in a dedicated building that houses state-of-
the-art laboratories, a freezer farm with dedicated back-up generated and fully alarmed 
systems, dark room, shared equipment and core facilities that include biostatistics and 
bioinformatics.  
Oncology Clinical Research Center
The oncology clinical research unit is comprised of dedicated research space imbedded in the 
Blumenthal Cancer Center. There is a dedicated Supervisor of Oncology Clinical Research 
and 5.[ADDRESS_964155]. The physical location of the clinical trials staff adjacent to the

End Date:2/7/[ADDRESS_964159] display clinical features 
that are consistent with p16 positivity (i.e., no history of smoking/alcohol, age range, etc.). To be 
assigned to a group and participate in the experimental portion of the trial, surgery must be performed 
at MSSM, tumor tissue must be available, and both p16 and HPV status must be assessed and proven 
to be positive for HPV 16 or any high risk HPV subtype (i.e., 18, 33, 35, etc.) by [CONTACT_4480] p16 positive 
by [CONTACT_4658].
8.0 REGISTRATION PROCEDURES 
After the patient signs the informed consent the patient will be registered for screening and once the 
investigator has verified that the patient meets all inclusion/exclusion criteria, the patient will be 
registered for and started on the protocol. Patients who lack p16 and HPV PCR may proceed to surgery 
however they will not be assigned to an experimental group and registered on the protocol until p16 
IHC and HPV PCR are completed and positive. The verification of patient’s eligibility and screening 
completion will be performed centrally after the receipt of the patient primary post-surgical registration 
form.  It is mandatory not to exceed 21 days between the date of registration for screening and the start 
of the study treatment (surgery).  In any case, all events occurring after the registration for therapy must 
be recorded in the case report form and will be taken into account in the analysis, whether the patient 
received the study treatment or not.  Patient must receive surgery and be p16 IHC and HPV PCR positive 
to be included in the intent to treat analysis. Patients found to not meet entry criteria will be offered best 
therapy. Of note Drs Genden and Teng will be seeing patients at the Participating Site (VHS) 
to facilitate evaluation and recruitment procedures.
Procedures Involved in Human Research – Participating Site
Surgical Intervention
Transoral Robotic Resections or TORS will be peformed by [CONTACT_709167] (Mount Sinai Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_709133]). Surgical 
guidelines will be performed as outlined in the protocol above. 
Delivery of Radiation
Radiotherapy will be delivered by [CONTACT_709168]. The delivery, dosage, and technical factors will be uniform across 
all study sites, in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_709134]. In addition, formal volume 
reviews will be performed by [CONTACT_709169] . This will ensure 
consistency in radiation treatment planning, volumes, and delivery. VSH department of 
Radiation Oncology will adhere to the protocol quality assurance measures and isodose 
distribution as noted in the protocol. Protocol deviations will be reported to the Coordinating 
Site PI, and the radiation oncology co-investigators.
Effective Date: 2/14/2022
End Date:2/7/[ADDRESS_964160] approximately 5-10 patients per 
year to accrue from the VHS. 
Blood Collection
Blood collection will adhere to the protocol for all patients accrued from the participating site. 
Samples (6 ml of blood/tube) will be obtained at each visit as noted in the protocol by [CONTACT_709170]. The exception to this will be if the intital blood sample is obtained immediately prior to 
surgery, which will be occurring at Mount Sinai Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_709133]. All other blood 
samples will be stored in the VHS. Viable lymphocytes will be processed from green top tubes using 
standard ficoll-hypaque density gradient separation.  Buffy coat layers will be stored as viable cells in 
DMSO-containing media at  -80C to -170C. 
Blood for serum will be spun within 5 hours of collection.  Blood tubes will be spun at 3000 x g for 10’ 
at 4C and the serum removed by [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_42115].  Serum will be stored in 1ml aliquots.  All samples will be 
stored at -80C.  White blood cell fraction will be stored in a single tube at local institutional temperature 
guidelines and kept locally. Blood samples will then be batched shipped to the Mount Sinai Health 
System Immune Core (as outlined above) at frequencies appropriate for the number of samples.
Specimen Banking 
As no surgical intervention/transoral robotic surgery will be performed at the VHS Participating Site, 
all specimens obtained from subjects accrued at VHS will be managed per the protocol, as surgical 
interventions will only occur at Mount Sinai Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_709133], and therefore from the 
standpoint of specimen management, the management is identical and will be handled the same for all 
SIRS study sujects. Any additional biopsies from the primary tumor or a recurrence obtained at VHS 
will be processed at the VHS laboratory, reviewed by [CONTACT_709171], and then shipped 
to the main biorepository at Mount Sinai for storage for correlative studies.

PBRC IRB# 2016-[ADDRESS_310008] year of life. We propose that unintentional overfeeding,  of 
nearly one additional  day of calories per week,  due to the “over-scoopi[INVESTIGATOR_007]” of powdered formula  contributes  
significantly to this phenomenon and potentially to the early development  of childhood obesity, a significant 
public health problem. Research of US infants indicates that infant formula use is most prevalent in families with  
lower levels of education and poverty and as such  infant formula is provided  to families within the National 
Women, Infants and Children program. Given the higher prevalence of formula feeding  in lower socioeconomic 
populations, there is an increased need  for easy to follow instructions for formula preparation. 
We recently  completed the Baby [CONTACT_255104] ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) which adapted the 
Remote Food Photography Method to estimate infant formula consumption in infants. An unexpected finding, 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_255080], was that the weight of a single  scoop  of 
formula varied significantly. Ninety-five percent of the prepared scoops weighed more than the intended gram 
weight stated on the package. “Over-scoopi[INVESTIGATOR_007]”  can result  in increased caloric  density and unintentional 
overfeeding of the infant. While the error  for one scoop may have  little  impact on the overall nutrition of the 
infant, the error is compounded with every  scoop and bottle fed over the course of a day.  
In the proposed study we will assess  the literacy and understanding  of individuals to follow commercially 
available infant formula  instructions. We will collaborate with the LA CaTS Health  Literacy  Core to improve the 
reading and comprehension of the manufacturer  package  instruction,  and we will solicit the input of caregivers  
and key stakeholders  to inform the development  of educational intervention around infant  feeding. Following 
modification of infant  formula preparation  instructions, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial that will 
test the efficacy of the modified instructions on infant overfeeding in comparison with the manufacturer  
package instructions. One hundred and fifty individuals will be asked to complete one study visit during which 
they will be asked to measure various  serving  sizes  of infant formula following  either the manufacturer package 
instructions or the modified instructions. The primary outcome variable will be powdered formula weight.  We 
have designed qualitative and quantitative research studies to test the following specific aims.
1.Aim 1 is to evaluate parental and caregiver literacy  related to the use of commercially-available 
instructions for the preparation of infant  formula.  Hypothesis A: the health  literacy of parents and 
caregivers to the instructions of commercially-available infant formula is variable. Hypothesis B: More 
than half of the parents and caregivers studied will not demonstrate adequate understanding of the 
infant formula instructions of the most commonly used infant formula in the US.
2.Aim 2 is to improve the accuracy and precision by [CONTACT_255105]’ measure powdered infant 
formula by [CONTACT_255106]. Hypothesis: Improving 
reading ease and adding explicit pi[INVESTIGATOR_255081].  We 
hypothesize that preparation instructions developed with  a health literacy focus (Aim 1) will reduce the 
proportion of over-scooped bottles  from 89% to 50%.Pennington Biomedical IRB FWA 00006218Approved 06/28/2016

52.BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE
2.1.  Significance
The 1,000 days between a woman’s pregnancy and the child’s  second  birthday is a critical period for growth and 
development. During this time the child  is particularly vulnerable to the environment and permanent  metabolic  
and developmental  changes  that may occur. Inadequate nutrition  and improper feeding  practices early in life 
leads to childhood obesity and chronic diseases  in adulthood such as obesity,  diabetes, and cardiovascular  
disease [1] and therefore, the National Institutes of Health is currently  soliciting proposals to understand  the 
development of obesity in children within this critical window for metabolic programming (PAR-14-323). From 
the outset,  the introduction of synthetic infant formula as an alternative to breast  milk was met with 
tremendous scrutiny [2]. While improvements to the composition of synthetic infant  formula have  been  made  
since its development in [ADDRESS_310009] year of life than exclusively breastfed infants [3]. Potential mechanisms linking infant formula feeding 
and childhood adiposity include lower levels of feeding self-regulation and increased appetite due to differences 
in sucking biomechanics between the bottle and breast  [4-6], differences in established  feeding practices  [7], 
and maternal  attitudes  towards infant feeding. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_255082] [8], over 80% of infants in the 
[LOCATION_002] receive infant formula prior to their six month birthday [9, 10]. Given that the majority of infants 
in the U.S. receive infant  formula in the first year of life, it is perplexing  that there is little to no current NIH 
funding dedicated  to better understanding the link between infant  formula and obesity development in young 
children. On the other hand,  there  is an abundance  of research that focuses  on the promotion of breastfeeding 
or mechanistic  studies  to understand  why breast milk may  be protective against childhood obesity which seems  
counterintuitive. We agree  that research on breastfeeding and breast  milk is important  however  the scientific 
community is neglecting the equally  or arguably  more important research of infant feeding in general  and in 
particular feeding  with infant formula. If this trend research continues,  the childhood obesity epi[INVESTIGATOR_255083], as pointed out in the US Surgeon 
General Report in 2011 [11],  including maternal  obesity,  lack of social and family support and unpaid maternity 
leave are not likely to be overcome in the near  future. Furthermore, evaluating the health  literacy and 
comprehension of infant formula instructions is critical  because the USDA’s Special Supplemental  Nutrition 
Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)  is the largest  purchaser  of infant  formula making WIC 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_255084]  [12]. Individuals who receive WIC benefits 
are generally from racial  and ethnic minority groups,  GED  certificate recipi[INVESTIGATOR_255085] 12th  
grade education level [13],  and these demographics are consistent with  a population with low health  literacy  
[14]. Infant  formula preparation instructions must therefore be written and designed to accommodate a low 
level of health  literacy  to ease readability, improve caregiver competency, and increase preparation accuracy  to 
ensure proper  feeding  of the nearly 662,[ADDRESS_310010]  qualitative  research to evaluate the 
health literacy  of infant formula instructions. In collaboration with the LA CaTS  Health  Literacy Core, we aim to 
improve the reading and comprehension  of package preparation instructions.  The revised infant  formula Pennington Biomedical IRB FWA 00006218Approved 06/28/2016

PBRC IRB# 2016-[ADDRESS_310011]  preparation instruction or the revised  instructions in a randomized  controlled trial.
This is a novel translational study which  will demonstrate that toolkits  aimed  to educate caregivers in the proper 
preparation of infant formula along with improved preparation instructions  need to be developed. With  easier  
to follow  preparation instructions, caregivers  will less likely  overfeed infants  resulting  in decrease infant  
adiposity and risk for childhood obesity.  
Our study is highly novel because: 1) it addresses  infant formula feeding which  is postulated to be a major  factor  
in the development of childhood obesity which  is a major public health concern, 2) we have highly provocative 
preliminary data from a recently completed study at Pennington Biomedical Research Center  (PBRC)  that shows 
adults including caregivers  of infants grossly overestimate infant formula which would lead to a significant 
overfeeding, 3) we plan for the first time  to carryout qualitative research  that assesses the literacy  and 
understanding of individuals to follow commercially available infant  formula instructions and 4) we will solicit 
the input of caregivers and key stakeholders to inform the development of educational intervention around 
infant feeding. The results of our study therefore translate our previous research findings to improve the 
understanding of infant  feeding and in particular the accuracy of infant formula preparation to prevent  
unintentional overfeeding  and to inform public health  strategies  related to the prevention  of obesity from birth.
The majority of the commercially available infant formula exists in powdered form. Caregivers are required to 
correctly interpret  the package label to accurately estimate the serving size and prepare a bottle  of formula for 
the infant. This is particularly  problematic because adults are unable to accurately measure estimate portion 
sizes [8, 15] and the preparation of infant formula requires an accurate estimate of not one but two parts that 
can impact the energy density of the meal; the powdered infant formula and the added  water. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_255086] [9], it is surprising that there is no 
consistency between products  in the preparation instructions provided to consumers on the label and the 
measuring scoop used to prepare the required serving size. Difficulty  in understanding preparation instructions 
together with an inaccurate estimation  of portion  sizes  would lead  to an incorrect  preparation of infant formula 
bottle.
2.3. Preliminary Studies
Preliminary data obtained  in the Baby [CONTACT_255107]. From  2012-2013  we conducted the Baby 
[CONTACT_255108]  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). The purpose  of 
the baby [CONTACT_255109] (RFPM) for estimating 
energy intake  for formula-fed infants.  To this end, we 
recruited [ADDRESS_310012] year  or non-caregivers. Subjects completed two visits 
approximately one-week apart and prepared  three  bottles measuring 2fl oz, 4 fl oz, 6 fl oz and 8 fl oz, such that 
two trials  were conducted at Visit  1 and the final trial was conducted at visit 2. The gram weights recommended  
for each serving of infant formula is shown in Figure 1, alongside the mean±se  of actual  gram weights of servings 
prepared by [CONTACT_174897]. Of the 636 bottles prepared,  607 or 95%  contained significantly more infant  
formula powder (by [CONTACT_8497])  than what  was recommended  on the package label (p<.0001).  This finding was Pennington Biomedical IRB FWA 00006218Approved 06/28/2016

PBRC IRB# 2016-002 -Protocol-June  24, 2016-V3-

evident for each bottle size which  is suggested for infant feeding from birth until  12 months of age and averaged 
11± 0.6%  (range: -24 to +140%) over-scoopi[INVESTIGATOR_255087]. The caloric density of a standard scoop of infant 
formula is 20 kcal/fl oz and therefore with this unintentional over-scoopi[INVESTIGATOR_255088] 
a caloric density  of 22 kcal/fl  oz, the caloric density often prescribed to premature  infants  to accelerate  infant 
growth rate [16]. While this error may appear to be marginal  for a single bottle,  the error was consistent  across  
trials. We can therefore assume that 
the unintentional over-scoopi[INVESTIGATOR_255089]. 
These data  are summarized in Table 
1. For each bottle  size the additional 
formula added to each bottle, would  result in an almost entire day of additional energy intake per week. 
Furthermore, there was no difference between caregivers and non-caregivers which points to a fundamental  
error in understanding the package instructions.
3.RESEARCH PLAN:  PHASE [ADDRESS_310013] the modification of infant formula 
manufacturer preparation instructions to enhance 
user understanding and accuracy.
In collaboration with  the LA CaTS Health Literacy 
Core, the health literacy elements of infant formula 
preparation instructions  will be assessed (Figure 2). 
Initial modifications to the manufacturer instructions will be made  to increase  reading  ease and ability to 
understand and act on instructions. Tools used to assess the health literacy  elements and to inform  necessary 
modifications to the standard instructions include the Patient Education Materials  Assessment Tool (PEMAT) 
[17],  Ensuring  Quality Information  for Patients (EQUIP) [18], and the Health Literacy INDEX [19]. These literacy 
tools encourage the use of plain  language, statement of a clear  purpose, specific concrete instructions, use of 
short sentences, use of pi[INVESTIGATOR_255090], clear layout, use of headings,  chunking of related 
information, and audience  appropriateness. Directed by [CONTACT_255110],  we will modify the 
manufacturer infant formula preparation instructions  to decrease the level of health literacy  required to 
properly prepare a bottle of formula. The instructions  will be modified to be easier to read  and navigate. The 
aim is to increase the participant’s ability to understand the words and measurements  and increase their ability 
to properly act on the instructions. The modified  instructions will then be presented  to focus groups in a 
stepwise fashion  to continually  improve consumer  comprehension of the instructions and until feedback  from 
the focus  groups is completely addressed.
3.1. Study  Population
Up to 40 individuals will be recruited to participate in focus groups at Pennington  Biomedical  Research Center. 
Approximately six focus  groups (each with 5-10  participants)  will be conducted at the PBRC Demonstration  
Kitchen over the course  of approximately 3 months.  Focus group participants will be matched based on 
demographic representation (i.e. level of education, household income, gender, and relation  to infants) to 
encourage equal participation of focus group attendees. A primary caregiver is defined as an individual who  has 
routinely cared for an infant  in the last year for more than 12 hours  per day.  Secondary caregiver is defined  as Pennington Biomedical IRB FWA 00006218Approved 06/28/2016

3.2. Recruitment
Potential participants will be recruited  from  within PBRC and the Greater Baton Rouge area via Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) approved posters, flyers  and advertisements posted on the PBRC website 
(http://www.pbrc.edu/clinicaltrials ) and through PBRC approved social  media  outlets  including but not limited 
to Facebook, blogs, and Craigslist. In addition to recruitment in the community, the Reproductive  Endocrinology 
and Women’s Health Laboratory has successfully recruited participants for pregnancy, breastfeeding, and 
women’s health studies through  partnerships  with Baton Rouge  General and Ochsner OB/GYNs  and local 
Women, Infants,  and Children (WIC) clinics.  Referrals  from these  collaborators  will also be used in recruitment 
efforts.
3.3. Study  Screening
Interested participants  will complete initial  screening via phone or the online webscreener survey.   Interested  
participants may  contact  [CONTACT_255111]. Participants not meeting these basic criteria from the webscreener will be excluded. All eligible 
volunteers will be assigned a unique study ID number and referred to study staff for study specific screening and 
focus group scheduling.
3.4. Assessment Schedule  and Procedures
Potential participants will complete screening to determine 
eligibility prior to enrollment. Interested  and eligible 
participants will be scheduled for a focus group visit. At the 
beginning of the focus group visit,  participants will be 
provided the Whoa Baby [CONTACT_7609] 1 informed consent and 
HIPAA authorization for review and completion. After signing  
the Whoa Baby [CONTACT_7609] 1 informed consent and HIPAA  
authorization, participants will complete  several procedures 
and participate in focus group discussion at the focus group visit. See Table  2, Schedule of Procedures.TABLE 2. Schedule of Procedures

93.4.1. Focus Group Visit
When an individual arrives to the assigned focus group visit at the PBRC Demonstration Kitchen, the Whoa Baby 
[CONTACT_7609] 1 informed consent will be provided  for reading and review. If the participant  agrees, the participant will 
sign the consent prior to the initiation of study procedures.  After  signing  the informed consent, study  
procedures will be completed as part of the focus group visit. Height and non-fasting body  weight will be 
measured by [CONTACT_3665]. Before focus group discussion, individuals will be asked (one participant at a 
time) to go to a different room for the individual structured  interview for health literacy assessment and the 
infant formula preparation procedure. After all participants have completed the individual, structured 
interviews, infant formula  preparation, and anthropometric assessments,  the focus group discussion will be 
completed where the focus group will elicit  barriers  and facilitators to infant  formula using  standard package 
instructions and provide  recommendations for improvement of standard infant formula preparation instructions 
to enhance  readability and improve understanding.
3.5. Measures and Outcome Assessments
3.5.1. Anthropometrics
Height and body  weight will be measured using standard procedures of PBRC.  Non-fasting body weight  will be 
recorded. Body mass  index (BMI) will then  be calculated  from the recorded  height and body weight. BMI will be 
computed as a cohort  demographic characteristic to ensure that focus group population  is representative  of the 
general population  in the Baton Rouge area.
3.5.2. Individual  Interview
1.General information: A research assistant will conduct a structured interview with participants to collect 
general information  (e.g. age, race,  income, education, experience with infant formula preparation,  number 
of children, caregiver status,  etc.), experience with infant formula preparation, and relation to infants. 
2.Health Literacy Assessment: Health literacy  and numeracy skills will be assessed through structured 
interview. The following assessments will be completed as part of the health literacy  assessment.
a.Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM-SF): The REALM-SF [20] asks participants to 
read medical terms  aloud.
b.Newest Vital Sign: The Newest Vital Sign [21] is based on a nutrition label from an ice cream  
container. Participants  are given the label  and then asked [ADDRESS_310015] responses, the study staff can assess the patient’s health  literacy level.
c.Modified Parental Health Literacy  Activities  Test (PHLAT): The PHLAT  [22] assesses parental 
health literacy and numeracy skills in understanding instructions  for caring for young children.
3.5.3. Infant Formula Preparation
Participants will be asked to prepare a single  2 fl oz bottle of infant formula according to the manufacturer 
package instructions without assistance or interruption (Figure 3). Participants will be asked to prepare a 2 fl oz 
bottle again,  but this time the weight of the dry powder scooped and the weight of the prepared formula will be 
recorded. Weights will be obtained (to the nearest  tenth of a gram) using a METTLER TOLEDO PB3001 scale.  
Discrepancies between actual weight and the weight recommend by [CONTACT_255112] a point of 
discussion during the focus  group. Both trials will be video recorded  for future review  by [CONTACT_255113].Pennington Biomedical IRB FWA 00006218Approved 06/28/2016

preparation of infant formula
3.5.4. Focus Group Discussion
Focus group discussions  will be led by a moderator who  will follow a script of group discussion probes.  During 
the focus  group, participants will be asked  to comment on discussion themes (e.g. attitudes towards infant 
feeding, current feeding  practices, desired  education  regarding  infant feeding, and recommendations  to 
improve preparation instructions), and all responses will be audio  and/or video  tape-recorded and will be 
transcribed verbatim later.  Responses  will be de-identified in the transcript. Modified preparation instructions 
will be presented to the first focus  group  for discussion. The preparation  instructions  will be further  modified  
based on participant feedback.  Iterative focus groups will view  and provide feedback on the preparation 
instructions modified by [CONTACT_255114]. Focus groups will continue  until a satisfactory set of 
instructions are developed. Conducting focus groups in a stepwise fashion allow one focus group to build  on the 
improvements recommended by [CONTACT_20904].
4.RESEARCH DESIGN: PHASE [ADDRESS_310016] the efficacy of 
the revised instructions  on infant  overfeeding  in comparison with  
the instructions currently provided on the packaging  (Figure 4). 
Individuals will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two groups:
1. Group 1: Group  [ADDRESS_310017] infant  formula 
preparation instructions  provided by [CONTACT_13989].
2. Group 2: Group  2 participants will prepare infant 
formula following the modified  infant formula 
preparation instructions. Pennington Biomedical IRB FWA 00006218Approved 06/28/2016

4.5.3. Infant Formula Preparation
Participants will be asked to prepare 2 trials of 2, 4, 6, and 8 fl oz bottles of infant  formula in random order. A 
total of 8 formula bottles will be prepared  at Visit 1. For each bottle, the participant will follow their randomly 
assigned (Group 1 or Group 2 randomization) preparation instructions to measure the required amount of 
powdered formula. The participant  will dispense the respective  number of scoops  of powdered formula into the 
formula bottle depending on which  size bottle is being  prepared.  After  all powdered formula is dispensed  into 
the feeding bottle, PBRC staff will weigh  the formula bottle with powdered formula only.  The participant will 
continue following  the instructions and pour water into the bottle and mix the formula. PBRC staff will weigh the 
formula bottle. This procedure will be repeated to assess intra- individual variability.  Bottles will be weighed  (to 
the nearest tenth of a gram) using a METTLER TOLEDO PB3001 scale, and dry formula and prepared formula 
weights will be recorded. Study staff who record the formula weights will be blinded to the randomization 
assignment and intended bottle size.
5.PARTICIPANT SAFETY AND CONFIDENTIALITY
5.1. Risks to participants 
This study  involves humans, but does not meet the definition of a clinical trial because  there is no prospective 
intervention that may  impact  health. This study does not involve major risk to screeners and trial participants. 
Efforts to minimize the potential risks of the assessment  methods  and outcome variables include  monitoring by 
[CONTACT_255115] 
a result of participating  in the research.
Potential Risks associated with the study procedures  include (presented in alphabetical order):
Body weight. There  is no risk to participants who  record  their  body  weight.
Focus  groups. There is minimal risk associated with participation  in a focus group. Participants  will be 
told that the discussion  during a group is confidential  prior  to the start of a discussion. Participants will 
be encouraged to participate in the discussion, but will not be required to do so if they feel 
uncomfortable.
Infant formula preparation. There is no risk to participants who prepare infant formula. The formula will 
be poured  out after  preparation, and no formula will be consumed.Pennington Biomedical IRB FWA 00006218Approved 06/28/2016

PBRC IRB# 2016-002 -Protocol-June  24, 2016-V3-
13Interview: There is no known or anticipated risk associated with the completion of an interview. 
Participants will be encouraged to answer  all questions, but will be told that they can choose  not to 
answer any questions if they feel uncomfortable  answering them.  Responses to the questions will be 
coded to protect  confidentiality.
5.2. Adverse events
Pennington Biomedical Research Center is an AAHRPP  accredited institution and,  above  all else,  is committed  to 
ensuring and maintaining  the safety  of its participants.  Participants in the study will come to Pennington 
Biomedical Research for one visit and will not be followed longitudinally. Therefore,  adverse events and 
medications will not be tracked. There are three physicians on site at Pennington Biomedical Research  Center  
who will be available if an incident occurs during a study visit. Study staff will follow institutional procedures for 
reporting any incident.
Protection of subjects from risks related to the study is of paramount concern to investigators.  Due diligence will 
be applied  to ensure that study subjects are not exposed to undue or untoward  risk. Remedial action,  including  
additions and changes to the protocol, will be taken as appropriate. The specific reporting mechanism currently 
in place is also outlined in PBRC HRPP  Policy 8.0 Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks  to Subjects  or Others. 
While Federal  guidelines require that Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others [21 CFR
56.108(b)] be reported to the IRB [45 CFR 46.103(b)(5)], related  internal and external events involving risk but 
not meeting the prompt reporting requirements should be reported to the IRB in summary  form at the time of 
continuing review. Surveillance and reporting  procedures are summarized in the following section.
5.2.1. Surveillance
All incidents  will be recorded and reviewed by [CONTACT_34355] [INVESTIGATOR_1238] a Center physician. Proper 
action as directed by [CONTACT_255116].
5.2.2. Reporting
The following  events  may represent  unanticipated  problems involving risks to subjects or others and should be 
promptly reported  to the IRB:
Breach of confidentiality involving risks
Event requiring prompt reporting (Report only  when required by [CONTACT_760], sponsor, or funding 
agency.)
New information  (Report information indicating an unexpected change  in risks or potential benefits, 
e.g., literature/scientific report or other published finding.)
Subject complaint (complaints indicating unanticipated risks or those that cannot be resolved by [CONTACT_75275].)
Unapproved  change made to the research to eliminate an apparent  immediate hazard
Other problem  or finding (e.g., loss of study data, a subject becomes a prisoner while  participating in 
research)
New information  that may affect adversely the safety  of the participants  or the conduct of the clinical 
trial.
Any changes significantly affecting the conduct  of the clinical  trial or increasing  the risk to participants.
Both internal events and external events that may  represent unanticipated  problems involving risks to subjects  
or others should be promptly reported. Unanticipated problems involved  risks to subjects or others will be 
reported within 10 working days of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_255092] 00006218Approved 06/28/2016

PBRC IRB# 2016-[ADDRESS_310019] likely scenario that would indicate a cessation  of the 
study would be failure to recruit participants.  Nevertheless, in addition to monitoring recruitment, we also will 
monitor the rates of injury in our participants.  The study investigators  will alert  the IRB, if a larger  than 
reasonably expected  injury rate occurs in our participants. Other issues  that are related to the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_255093]:
New information  – It is unlikely that new information will become available  during this study that would  
result in discontinuing the trial.
Limits of assumption – It is possible  that the value of data analysis will be limited by [CONTACT_255117].   Baseline  differences 
will be analyzed annually and effects on the power to detect differences  in the outcome measures will 
be evaluated and discussed with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_255094].  Although an excessive number  of dropouts  
could occur, this has not been our past experience. In CALERIE  study  (24 weeks), the dropout  rate was 
only 2% (1 out of 36 enrolled).  If  the dropout rate for the proposed study  exceeds 15%, the study 
coordinator will initiate  a meeting with  the PI [INVESTIGATOR_255095].  If the dropout 
rate exceeds 25%,  the safety officer  will meet with the study  investigators to determine  whether or not 
the study  should continue.
Limit of rules – We acknowledge that circumstances, other than what are listed,  may justify stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_90348].
 
5.4. Confidentiality
All volunteers are assured of their anonymity and confidentiality both verbally and in the informed consent 
form.  The clinical facilities are strictly limited to the staff of the research institution and to research volunteers.  
This is accomplished by a variety of stringent security  measures.  All medical records are stored in locked areas.  
Access to these areas is limited to the clinical support  staff, director of the clinical facilities, and the PIs.  
Volunteers’ medical records  are filed according to ID numbers.  All  forms  on the chart, with the exception of 
consent form,  display only the ID number.  Electronic  data  storage  is similarly restricted with only the PIs and 
authorized persons having access to databases containing confidential clinical records, i.e. those containing 
name, Social Security Number or other identifying  information.
Data will be collected  from participants.  Data are confidentially collected  from study  participants and are only  
used for research purposes.   All records are kept  in locked  file cabinets,  and participant data can be identified  
only by [CONTACT_6227].   Data are used only in aggregate, and no identifying characteristics of individuals are published 
or presented.
6.DATA MANAGEMENT
6.1. Sample  Size Consideration
In the Baby [CONTACT_255118], participants were asked to prepare  a randomly ordered set of liquid baby [INVESTIGATOR_14420] (2, 4, 
6, or 8 fl oz). Estimated  proportions of participants over-scoopi[INVESTIGATOR_255096].  A separate power analysis  for the proposed study was carried  
out for each formula  amount with the Baby [CONTACT_255119]-scoopi[INVESTIGATOR_255097].  To ensure a well 
powered study, each estimate from the Baby [CONTACT_255120] 15%. The most 
conservative results from  the power  analyses are presented in Table 4 and provide a sufficient  sample  size to Pennington Biomedical IRB FWA 00006218Approved 06/28/2016

PBRC IRB# 2016-002 -Protocol-June  24, 2016-V3-
15achieve desired power when comparing the control and experimental group proportions of over-scoopi[INVESTIGATOR_255098]. In the proposed study, we hope to see the 
proportion of participants over-scoopi[INVESTIGATOR_255099] 50% following use of the new preparation 
instructions. 75 participants will be enrolled in each study group, ensuring 80% power  to detect this decrease.

participant randomization,  bottle  size preparation order will also be randomized. At the visit, participants will 
receive a slip of paper revealing the order  in which to prepare each  bottle.  A biostatistician will create the 
randomized sequences and each participant will be asked to prepare the bottles as dictated by [CONTACT_255121].
6.3. Data Analysis Plan
To address the primary aim,  dry formula weights will be compared to package recommendations (i.e. 8.7 g per 
scoop) and classified as under-scooped, accurate  scoop, or over-scooped. The proportion of bottles that are 
over-scooped will be compared between the two groups. Both univariate  and multivariate analyses  will be 
employed. 2x2 contingency tables with counts of participants over-scoopi[INVESTIGATOR_255100]-square tests used to compare raw proportions. This will be carried out separately for each 
bottle size.  In addition, estimated probabilities of over-scoopi[INVESTIGATOR_255101]. Group-level odds  
ratios constructed  from  the estimated probabilities will be compared using  two-sample t-tests. For all tests, 
statistical significance is defined as p<α. Adjustments  for multiple comparisons will be made when appropriate.
7.SUBJECT PAYMENT
Participants enrolled in Whoa Baby [CONTACT_7609] 1 or Whoa Baby [CONTACT_7609] 2 will receive  $25 for participation  in the study  
to help offset  transportation  costs and their  time. The compensation is in line with  other studies conducted at 
PBRC, and checks will be requested from the Pennington Biomedical  (LSU) payroll department.Pennington Biomedical IRB FWA 00006218Approved 06/28/2016

 STUDY OVERVIEW  
The optical aberrations and resultant visual quality of a contact [CONTACT_709610], pre-  and post -contact [CONTACT_709611], contact [CONTACT_709612], water content, 
and the lens design. Previous studies have evaluated the optical quality of soft contact [CONTACT_709613] (e.g. Kollbaum 2004) and on the eye (e.g. Kollbaum 2007).  A previous study by [CONTACT_352098] -Mico (Montes -
Mico 2012) also evaluated the optical quality of soft contact [CONTACT_13276], focusing on the change in on -eye 
optical contact [CONTACT_709614].  They found that some lenses had relatively little change across the day, whereas other lenses had greater changes, presumed due to contact [CONTACT_13293] s urface 
and lens bulk dehydration. This study, however, had limited published details making modeling and 
predictions based on the results not possible.  The study also used an incomplete set of lenes compared 
to what is currently in the marketplace.   The c urrent study aims to systematically investigate the diurnal 
variation in the optical quality of soft contact [CONTACT_709615].  Subject reported quality 
of vision will also be evaluated.

 Page 3 of 14 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
KEY OBJECTIVE  1. Diurnal variation within lens in the on-eye optical quality  of 
soft lenses over  time (12 hours)  
2. Subject reported within -lens vision stability  over time  (0-100 
scale)  
KEY ENDPOINTS  
/OUTCOME MEASURES Key endpoints are the monocular ( OD only ) responses of:  
1. RMS.   RMS (total and higher -order) only, will be compared 
across time and between lenses.  From these measures of 
RMS, change over time can be quantified as a magnitude and percentage.  
2. Root Mean Square (R MS) Fit Error.  For each optical 
measurement, the wavefront will be reconstructed using both 
a ‘typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]’ m odal (Zernike) reconstruction and zonal (local 
integration) reconstruction.  The difference between these two 
reconstructed wavefronts  constitutes an estimate of the RMS 
fit error (how much error is introduced from the “real wavefront” (local is closest ap proximation) relative to the 
Zernike modally fit wavefront.   
3. Subject reported within -lens vision stability  over time  (0-100 
scale, viewing distant target)

 Page 4 of 14 STUDY DESIGN  The study is a monocular  (only OD measured, matching type of 
correction for OS) , subject masked, 2 x 2 randomized, crossover (with 
an additional non -randomized  baseline reference (3 arms in all) ) 
comparing the within -lens difference in diurnal (AM to PM) change in 
optical quality  with different soft  lenses  relative to the diurnal change 
at baseline  (no lens) .  
 
Subjects will be tested for and must meet all inclusion criteria and not meet any exclusion criteria prior to beginning lens testing.  
 
Lens wearing  protocol:  
1. Subjects will first have measurements acquired every 2 ±0.5  
hours for 12 hours without any lenses (no lens, baseline).  The 
subject will wear their habitual spectacles between 
measurement periods.  
2. Following a day of washout with spectacle wear on ly each type 
of lens  will be use d in both eyes for a period of 2 ±[ADDRESS_964687] been wearing for the previous 2 ±1 days will be insterted  while a

aberrometry (minimum 5mm analysis diameter), Medmont topography, and subjective measures. (0 -100 scale).  
3. Subjects will then be dispen sed the next randomized lens pair 
and told to not wear the lens that day or the following (washout) day, but the next 2±[ADDRESS_964688] day not wearing the lenses.  Lenses will be inserted, and then  measures will be 
taken throughout the day.  
 Measurement protocol:  
1. At the beginning of each testing  day, measures of the subject’s 
eye alone will be captured.  This will serve as ‘baseline’ for 
each day.  
2. The study lenses will then be inserted acrording to the lens 
randomization schedule.  
4. Following 10 -20 minutes of lens settling, eye+lens aberrometry 
(minimum 5mm analysis diameter) and  subjective measures 
(0-100 scale)  will be  acquired.  
3. This cycle will be repeated every 2 ±0.5  hours up to 12 ±1 hours.  
4. At the end of 12 ±[ADDRESS_964689] will return all lenses of 
that set, and be given the next set of lenses to repeat the 
washout, wearing, and measurement cycle .

 Page 7 of 14 RATIONALE AND SIGNIFICANCE :   
The optical aberrations and resultant visual quality of a contact [CONTACT_709617], pre-  and post -contact [CONTACT_709611], contact [CONTACT_709618], water content, and the lens design. Previous studies have evaluated the optical quality of soft contact [CONTACT_709619] (e.g. Kollbaum 2004) and on the eye (e.g. Kollbaum 2007).  
A previous study by [CONTACT_352098] -Mico (Montes -Mico 2012) also evaluated the optical quality of soft 
contact [CONTACT_13276], focusing on the change in on- eye optical contact [CONTACT_709620].  They found that some lenses had relatively little change across the day, whereas other lenses had greater changes, presumed due to contact [CONTACT_709621].  
This study, however, had limited published details making modeling and predictions based on 
the results not possible.  The study also used an incomplete set of lenes compared to what is 
currently in the marketplace.   
 
 
AIM: The current study aims to systemat ically investigate the diurnal variation in the optical quality 
of soft contact [CONTACT_709615].  Subject reported quality of vision will also be 
evaluated.  
  
STUDY DESIGN  
The study is a monocular  (OD only) , subject masked,  2 x 2  randomized, crossover (with an 
additional non- randomized baseline reference (3  arms in all)) comparing the difference in 
diurnal change in optical quality with different soft lenses relative to baseline (no lens).  
 
Lens wearing protocol : 
1. Subjects will first have measurements acquired every 2±0.5 hours for 12 ±1 hours 
without any lenses (no lens, baseline).  The subject will wear their habitual spectacles 
between measurement periods.  
2. Following a day of washout with spectacle wear only , each type of lens wil l be used in 
both eyes for a period of 2±[ADDRESS_964698] been wearing for the 
previous few days will be insterted while a masked examiner then performs 
measurements every 2±0.5  hours for 12 ±1 hours.  
3. Subjects will then be dispensed the next randomized lens pair and told to not wear the 
lens that day or the following (washout) day, but the next two days.  As previous, the 
subject will present to the clinic on the third day not wearing the lenses.  Lenses will be 
inserted, and then measures will be taken throughout the day.  
 
Measurement protocol : 
1. At the beginning of each testing  day, aberrometry, Medmont topography  (non-invasive 
tear break -up), and subjective quality measures of the subject’s OD eye alone will be 
captured.  This will serve as ‘baseline’ for each day.  
2. The study lenses will then be inserted acrording to the randomization schedule.  
3. Following 10- 20 minutes of  lens settling, eye+lens aberrometry (minimum 5 mm analysis 
diameter, Medmont corneal topography, and subjective (0- 100 scale) measures will be 
acquired  on the OD .  Measures of contact [CONTACT_709622] (through recorded imaging) will also 
be performed. Measur es at this time point  will serve as “time 0” for each lens wearing 
day. 
4. This cycle will be repeated every 2±0.5  hours up to 12 ±1 hours.  
5. At the end of 12±[ADDRESS_964699] will return all lenses of that set, and be given the 
next set  of lenses to repeat the washout, wearing and measurement cycle.

 Page 8 of 14 Dilation Protocol :  
No pharmacological dilation will be used in this study.  Subjects will be in a dark room 
aiming to achieve a natural pupil diameter of at least [ADDRESS_964700] time points/lenses, but not all, inclusion of data acquired smaller than 5 mm will be scaled to 5 mm and considered on an individual basis.  
 
 
Equipment : 
1. An aberrometer  (e.g. COAS -HD or CSO Osiris)  will be used for all optical measures.  
The aberration data will be obtained for central 3 - and 5 -mm diameter areas.  
Wavefront data will be recontstructed by [CONTACT_709616] (up to 6th order Zernike 
polynomials) and zonal (local slope) methods.  
2. A Medmont corneal topographer will be used following each set of aberration 
measures to also monitor the tear film upon the eye/contact [CONTACT_13293].  
 SUBJECTS  
 
Sample Size:  
This section describe s the rationale and approach used to establish the minimum sample 
size (N) needed to achieve 80% power at a nominal significance level α=0.[ADDRESS_964701] lens (no- CL).  For each subject and lens, a series of five RMS measurements will be 
obtained at 0 hours (baseline) and at six, 2- hr intervals within each period .  Technically, the 
statistical power for testing the contact [CONTACT_709623]=0 hours are 
incorporated into the statistical model(s).  But , given the degree of uncertainty about the input 
parameter values required to estimate sample size, we believe it reasonable to base initial calculations on a dependent sample t -test on a mean difference score under the assumption of 
no differential carry over effect.  Thus, the target parameter of interest for our primary analysis 
corresponds to the true difference in the mean post -baseline percentage change over [ADDRESS_964702] lenses and no- CL for N subjects.  Note that this tes t would be 
equivalent to testing the interaction of “lens” and “hours of use” factors in a two- way repeated 
measurements ANOVA.   
 
Data was not available on the two test lenses, so we used previously published data on an 
ALCON lens expected to provide similar responses.  Specifically, w e approximated parameter 
values for [1] effect size, [2] within- subject variance, and [3] within- subject correlation from the 
data reported in two previous studies.  Specifically, Montes -Mico, et al (2013) measured 
wavefr ont aberrations in [ADDRESS_964703] lens fitting 
over a 12- hr period.  Using the 5- mm pupil diameter data presented in Figure 2  of the 
referenced paper , we estimated that the group- averaged percentage change between the 
baseline (i.e., 2 -hr after lens fitting) and the final measurement (i.e., after 12- hr wearing time)  of 
~3% and ~5% for no -CL and DAILIES TOTAL  ONE  (DT1)  lens, respectively.  Note that this 
difference between no- CL and DT1 was smaller than any of the o ther lenses under test , but 
mirrors the expectation for the current test lenses .  To allow for mean differences larger than the 
observed 2% mean difference between each of the test lenses and no -CL in the current study , 
we added a 1.5% non -inferiority marg in; thus, our sample size calculation assumes a ‘null 
difference’ of 3.5%.   
CONFIDENTIAL STUDY PROPOSAL  (v. 2018 -09-05)  Pete Kollbaum, OD, PhD; Indiana University  
 Page [ADDRESS_964704] variability and correlation estimates were taken from Cheng, et al  (2004) who 
reported on the stability of clinical monochromatic aberrometry measurements over a wide 
range of time scales.  First, temporal variability of wavefront root mean square (RMS) error, 
excluding defocus and astigmatism, was tracked across five repeated measurements for 4 
subjects at four different time scales.  The averaged variance estim ates for different time scales 
ranged from 8.10 x 10-5 μm2 (t < 1 second) to 9.73 x 10-4 μm2 (t < 1 year).   For our calculations, 
we used their reported value of 4.41 x 10-4 μm2 (t < 1 week) as our variance estimate, which 
translates to a standard deviation of 2.1%.  We expect that this is a worst -case scenario 
because the value was derived by [CONTACT_709624]- day variances for individual trials 
across five days for each subject and then c alculating the average across the four subjects and 
five trials on each day.  Our data will be multiple measurements taken within a 12- hr period on 
the same day.  Second, Cheng, et al  (2004) reported a within- subject correlation estimate of 
r=0.[ADDRESS_964705] AB.  Again, because the time -scale in the 
current study proposal is only 12 hours (i.e., is much shorter than 1 year), we expect that the magnitude of the within- subject correlation in our sample is likely to be 0.80 higher. For 
purposes of the sample size calculation, we used three values for the correlation parameter, i.e., 
r = {0.70, 0.75, and 0.80}.  The input parameters for this sam ple size calculation scenario are 
shown in Table 1(a).  The actual power and number of paired observations for this scenario are 
presented in Table 1(b) and were obtained using SAS 9.4 by [CONTACT_709625].

 Page 11 of 14 OUTCOME MEASURES  
Primary : 
The primary outcome measure in this study will be a derived variable indexing the percentage 
change in the RMS of higher -order wavefront  aberrations (microns) at a 3 and 5 mm pupil from 
baseline to 12 hours.  For each participant, we will convert the data from microns into the percentage change in RMS, %Δ
i(12-0)k = 100 x (RMS i12k –RMS i0k)/RMS i0k where i=1,2,..,N 
participant, j represents t ime (hrs) Є (0 (BL) , 2, …, 12), and k denotes lens.  Our initial analysis 
will compare the mean %Δ ∙(12-0)test computed across N participants for each of the Air Optix plus 
Hydraglyde and Air  Optix Aqua lens es independently  with the mean %Δ ∙(12-0)NCL with no contact 
[CONTACT_13293].  
 
Secondary : 
1. Subject -reported vision- stability  (0-100 scale, while viewing at distance)  
2. Root Mean Square  Fit Error.  For each optical measurement, the wavefront will be 
reconstructed using both a ‘typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]’ modal (Zernike) reconstruction and zonal (local integration) reconstruction.  The difference between these two reconstructed wavefronts will be evaluated.  
 
 
TESTING  PROCEDURES :  
In office testing will be done at study entry , and following 2±1 days of lens wear for each of the 
follow up visits.  
 
Testing Day 1, Visit 1 Baseline /Inclusion:

5. Habitual lens information (type, power)  
6. Habitual lens use (wearing schedule, replacement schedule, hours per day, insertion time, removal time)  
7. Subjective refraction ( best objective with an additional - 0.25 D for subjective 
improvement ) 
8. Fit evaluation of all lens pairs.  If all lens pairs do not fit adequately enough per 
investigator clinical determination for dispensing, subject will be exited from the study.  
9. Snellen acuity of each eye for all lens pairs.  
 
Testing Day 2, Visit 1-7 Naked eye diurnal measures : 
1. Subjects will first have aberrometry, Medmont topography, and subjective quality

subjective quality measures of the subject’s eyes alone (COAS and Medmont) will be 
captured.  This will serve as ‘baseline’ for each day  (for the spectacle day, this will also 
be “time 0”) .

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
Separate tables with descriptive statistics will be provided for all baseline, outcome/endpoint and safety variables, as appropriate.  Continuous variables will be summarized with location and 
dispersion parameter estimates while categorical data will be s ummarized using frequency 
counts, percentages and margin tables where appropriate.  Visualizations and related graphs 
will be provided in support of these data summaries.    
 
Statistical analyses will be performed only after all data have been collected, t ranscribed into the 
electronic database, and error checked and corrected if needed.   We will first test for a 
differential carryover effect of lens using a linear (ANOVA) model.  For a crossover design, the 
model can be expressed as   
𝑦𝑦
𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖=𝜇𝜇+𝛼𝛼𝑑𝑑+𝜌𝜌𝑖𝑖(𝑑𝑑)+𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖+𝜏𝜏𝑖𝑖+𝜆𝜆𝑚𝑚+𝛾𝛾𝜏𝜏𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝑒𝑒𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 
where μ is the overall mean, 𝛼𝛼𝑑𝑑 is the effect for the ith sequence, 𝜌𝜌𝑖𝑖(𝑑𝑑) is the random effect for the 
of the jth individual within the ith sequence (i.e.  𝜌𝜌𝑖𝑖(𝑑𝑑) ∼𝑁𝑁(0,𝜎𝜎𝜌𝜌2) , 𝛾𝛾𝑖𝑖is the effect of the kth period, 
𝜏𝜏𝑖𝑖 is the effect of the lth lens effect and 𝜆𝜆𝑚𝑚 is the effect of the mth carryover effect with  𝑒𝑒𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 being 
the NIID residual term (i.e., 𝑒𝑒𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ~𝑁𝑁(0,𝜎𝜎𝑒𝑒2).  Assuming that there is no statistical evidence of a 
period x lens interacti on (𝛾𝛾𝜏𝜏𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖), we will use a one- sided  equivalence (i.e., non -inferiority) test to 
determine whether the average percentage increase in higher -order RMS induced by [CONTACT_709626]1 
Lens is no worse than the average increase without a contact [CONTACT_13293].  In practice we can use a single directional paired- sample t -test to test the null hypotheses. If we reject H
o we should 
conclude that the p ercentage increase over a 12- hour period in higher -order RMS induced by 
[CONTACT_709627] a contact [CONTACT_13293].  In this 
context, smaller differences in the mean difference in higher -order RMS are “better.”  Thus, the 
statistical hypotheses are arranged so that rejecting the null hypothesis for the spec ified null 
difference implies that, the observed m ean change over [ADDRESS_964713]  lenses is 
not significantly worse than the mean change with no- CL. i.e.,  
 
𝐻𝐻𝑜𝑜: 𝜇𝜇𝐷𝐷−𝜇𝜇𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁≥𝑀𝑀𝐼𝐼𝑁𝑁 versus 𝐻𝐻𝑎𝑎: 𝜇𝜇𝐷𝐷−𝜇𝜇𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁<𝑀𝑀𝐼𝐼𝑁𝑁

Second, a comparison of the statistic %Δ i(12-0)test  for one test lens  with %Δ i(12-0)k-[ADDRESS_964714] 
lens in the study will be performed by [CONTACT_6486] a linear mixed effects regression model with 
restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation.  The effect of lens will be parameterized in 
this model with (0,1) GLM dummy coding using Air Optix  with Hydraglide  as the reference lens; 
thus, a separate parameter estimate will be obtained for the other  test lens. The initial model will 
include a single random effect for subject.  We will also perform sensitivity analyses by [CONTACT_709628] h ML to obtain ‘adjusted’ parameter estimates for the fixed 
effect of lens to account for potential confounding due to measured covariates.  
 
 
PUBLICATION PLAN:   Work will be presented at least one international meeting, such as American Academy of 
Optometry, Global Specialty Lens Symposium , ISCLR,  BCLA, American Optometric 
Association, or ARVO .  The work will also be prepared for submission for peer -reviewed or 
trade publication (e.g. Optometry and Vision Science) at Sponsor’s re quest  and if results merit .

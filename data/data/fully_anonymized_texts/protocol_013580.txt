1.0 PROTOCOL SUMMARY AND/OR SCHEMA  
The goal of this study is to extend findings of propofol’s effects on memory, as measured 
in volunteer research studies, to a clinical setting. Standard memory tasks utilized in 
clinical drug studies do not readily differentiate between effects on memory from 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_833065] (sedation) or from a specific effect of certain drugs (e.g. benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], propofol) on memory itself (amnesia). We have been able to differentiate these effects in adult volunteers using a visual pi[INVESTIGATOR_833066] a period of approximately [ADDRESS_1156811] memory function are not suitable for 
pediatric patients, particularly in a busy clinical setting. The visual pi[INVESTIGATOR_833067], on the other hand, is simple in nature and should be able to be performed easily by [CONTACT_833109].  
We wish to assess the feasibility of a similar pi[INVESTIGATOR_833068], principally MRI scans of the brain.  Pediatric patients who are old enough to be able to name [CONTACT_21173][INVESTIGATOR_833069]. Before the therapeutic procedure is begun, during induction of sedation, 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_833070]. This procedure will form memories as propofol concentration is increasing. After awakening following completion of the therapeutic procedure, recognition memory will be tested for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_833071].  
A control group of children of similar age and undergoing similar minor therapeutic procedures will be recruited to perform memory tasks as for the children who receive propofol.   
2.0 OBJECTIVES AND SCIENTIFIC AIMS  
1. The primary objective is to determine the feasibility of using the visual pi[INVESTIGATOR_833072]. Feasibility will be defined as being able to 
accrue an average of 2 patients a week who successfully name [CONTACT_833125][INVESTIGATOR_833073]  (as described in Section 11.0, Aim 1) . 
2. The strength of propofol amnesia (the effect of propofol on memory not related to sedation) will be estimated as a difference between thresholds for amnesia (loss of memory) and sedation (loss of verbal responsiveness)

Hypothesis 1: The threshold effect for memory will occur significantly sooner, i.e. at lower 
drug concentrations, than the threshold effect for sedation, as illustrated in Fig 2 (the 
threshold for memory effect is illustrated by [CONTACT_833110], and for 
sedation by [CONTACT_833111]).  
3.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
Amnesia versus Sedation 
One of the critical components of anesthesia is amnesia (lack of recall) for events during 
surgery or therapeutic procedures. The failure of this anesthetic effect, i.e. conscious 
awareness and recall of events during anesthesia, known as ‘awareness’, occurs at a low, but predictable frequency of ~0.5% both in adults and children.  (1) In fact, the incidence of 
this complication may be higher in the pediatric population.  (2) (3) Serious psychological 
sequelae may occur after an epi[INVESTIGATOR_833074], with symptoms similar to those of 
post-traumatic stress disorder.  (4) (5) (6) This eventuality may be particularly distressing 
for patients with cancer, who frequently require repeated therapeutic procedures. The fact 
that the incidence of awareness is so low makes it difficult to conduct systematic studies to address this issue. Thus, practice aimed at prevention of this complication is frequently 
based on expert opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. One common recommendation is to use drugs with specific 
amnesic properties during anesthesia.  
A more precise definition of an amnesic drug is on e that is able to prevent recollection of 
memories at low or minimal levels of sedation. Amnesic drugs are useful adjuncts to other anesthetic agents, most of which prevent recall of intra -operative events on the basis of 
sedation alone, i.e. no conscious memories are formed because the patient is unable to experience and process stimuli from the outside world. However, periods of inadequate anesthetic level may occur for any number of reasons e.g. individual response to 
medications, sudden painful stimulus, hemodynamic instability necessitating decreased 
drug doses, refilling the drug delivery device, ‘stormy’ induction or emergence, etc . The 
rationale for the routine use of an amnesic drug is that it will prevent recall of any events occurring during periods of inadvertently light anesthesia. Midazolam is such an amnesic drug, and is frequently used in the therapeutic setting for this reason. Relative 
disadvantages of midazolam include relatively prolonged duration of action, of particular 
concern in the outpatient setting, and the inability to act as a suitable anesthetic agent when given alone. Propofol has been shown in many studies in adults to posses s specific 
amnesic properties, both in the research and clinical settings.  (7) (8) (9) (10)  To date, 
propofol provides the most desirable qualities for an ‘all -purpose’ anesthetic agent, as it 
possesses amnesic properties, has a short duration of action, and can be administered as the sole anesthetic agent.  
Sedation for therapeutic procedures in children  
As propofol has desirable pharmacokinetic properties that allow deep levels of sedation commensurate with rapid recovery, it is the most common sedative agent given to 
pediatric patients for therapeutic procedures. However, almost no research has been done 
to determine if propofol is indeed an am nesic, as opposed to a purely sedative drug when

Amended:  
given to pediatric patients.  (11) There is evidence that the pharmacodynamics for propofol 
are different in children than adults, so the amnesic effects present in adults need to be 
confirmed in children. ( 12) Recently dexmedetomidine, an agent with a similarly favorable 
pharmacologic profile to that of propofol, has been introduced for sedation in pediatric patients.  (13,14) Similarly to propofol, there is no research in pediatric patients regarding 
the memory effects of dexmedetomidine. In adult patients, the amnesic  effect of 
dexmedetomidine is unclear, but there are some data to indicate that dexmedetomidine 
has few amnesic properties.  (15) (16) (17) Interestingly, when dexmedetomidine was used 
for sedation in pediatric patients, improvement in the quality of sedation was noted when a known amnesic  agent (e.g. midazolam or ketamine) was co- administered.  (18,19) 
Whether this improvement may have been a result of the additional amnesic effect of these drugs, or some other property is unknown.  
Thus, the possibility exists that using agents with amnesic properties may provide better quality of sedation in pediatric patients. The only way this hypothesis can be critically assessed is to have some measure of the amnesic effect of a given drug when given to 
pediatric patients in a clinical setting.  
Measures of amnes ic versus sedative effects 
Sedative effects of anesthetic drugs can be measured in real time, for example by 
[CONTACT_833112], or presence of an adequate behavioral response while the drug is being given (e.g. keepi[INVESTIGATOR_833075], or performing a simple task such as naming a pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103]). However, the assessment of memory is by [CONTACT_833113]. The memory 
effect of amnesic drugs develops over 10- 30 minutes, and the full extent of memory 
impairment is only evident after this time interval has elapsed. (7,16) Measures of memory 
impairment due to a drug use recognition performance at some distinct time after the 
sedative effect of a drug was measured during administration. Thus, comparison of the amnesic and sedative properties of a drug represent behavioral responses obtained at two 
distinct time points. Modulation of the memory effect of a drug is related back in time to 
conditions present when the memory was being formed, i.e. at encoding. F or the purposes 
of this study we are assessing modulation of memory by [CONTACT_833114].  (20) (21) 
The methods used to assess the amnesic properties of drugs in the clinical setting are quite limited in comparison to controlled research settings.  (22) Frequently measures of 
memory are used which cannot differentiate among the various factors that impair memory 
in the clinical setting. For example, anxiety in the peri -operative setting can itself impair 
memory for events before the administration of anesthesia.  (23) Other difficulties in 
translation of methods to the clinical setting include the use of other drugs, timing of 
measurements, the presence of painful treatments, etc. (24) One of most difficult issues to 
address is the ability  to separate the amnesic and sedative effects of drugs on memory. 
(25) (21) A behavioral paradigm that could separate sedative and amnesic effects of drugs 
easily applied in the clinical setting would allow the ability to measure the influence of the amnesic properties of a given drug on outcome, for example patient satisfaction with anesthesia or recall of procedure events. Over the past decade we have developed

methods to measure amnesic versus sedative effects, in particular with propofol, in the 
research setting using volunteers. (7,16,21)  
The drug rampi[INVESTIGATOR_782504]  
A simple paradigm that allows amnesia to be differentiated from sedation is to infuse drug 
in increasing concentrations over a period of ~10 minutes. During this time period, as drug 
concentration and sedation are increasing, visual stimuli are presented. Importantly, these stimuli are attended to by [CONTACT_481552] a task, in this case by [CONTACT_833115] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103]. A positive response on the task , naming the pi[INVESTIGATOR_833076] , confirms 
that the stimulus was processed sufficiently to be learned and allow testing for subsequent 
recognition.  
The full range of sedation effects is achieved by [CONTACT_299775] a rate so that no 
sedation is present initially, with levels of sedation present that allow the naming task to be 
performed  during the bulk of the infusion period. By [CONTACT_833116], namely, unresponsiveness to voice. Analysis of subsequent recognition memory and sedation at the time of encoding allows one to determine the time of pi[INVESTIGATOR_833077] 50% memory effect occurs and compare it  to the time at which 50% sedation occurs. The larger the 
separation between these two dose- response points, the greater are the amnesic 
properties present for the drug. This is illustrated below using exemplars from volunteer 
studies we have previously conducted.

subsequent lack of recognition memory parallels the increase in sedation, i.e. there was no specific 
amnesic effect (a small difference in 50% effect (horizontal black line) for memory and sedation)

(dark line). The hallmark of amnesia is the lack of subsequent recognition which begins well before any 
increase in sedation (dark line, a large difference in 50% effect for memory and sedation).
 
As there is substantial evidence that propofol is amnesic in adults and propofol is the most 
common sedative agent used for pediatric procedures, we wish to initially test the drug rampi[INVESTIGATOR_833083] a measure of amnesic effect using propofol in pediatric  patients. The 
main goal of this study is to determine the feasibility of patient accrual and ability to define the relationship of amnesia to the level of sedation.  
In summary, a rationale exists, but is not proven, for the desirability of specific amnes ic 
properties for drugs used during sedation/anesthesia. The development of an instrument to detect the amnesic effect of a given drug in a clinical setting would not only confirm results from previous volunteer studies, but would provide an opportunity to measure an 
important variable in patient outcome in terms of recall of the surgical/therapeutic 
experience, or of patient satisfaction. If the quality of amnesia does indeed relate to 
outcome, then this measure applied in the clinical setting would provide a rational basis for 
drug selection. Future studies could be used to compare drugs with similar pharmacokinetic profiles, for example, propofol with dexmedetomidine or various inhalational agents.  
A protocol using the same methodology as in the current one is now open at [LOCATION_011] 
Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], where dexmedetomidine is used for pediatric sedation. Accrual demographics are nearly identical with the patients accrued so far to the MSKCC protocol. 
Inclusion of a control group at both sites will validate a more direct comparison of memory 
effects from propofol with those of dexmedetomidine.

Post-Operative Cognitive Dysfunction  
Another important clinical issue is the presence of cognitive dysfunction after anesthesia in 
the elderly with impaired cognitive reserve.  (26-28) (29,30) Memory impairment is an 
important component of post -operative cognitive dysfunction, which in turn is associated 
with a higher incidence of post -operative delirium, and poorer outcomes.  (31) Of 
importance, patients of all ages who have received chemotherapy demonstrate varying 
degrees of cognitive impairment.  (32) Thus, in theory, this patient population may be at 
similar risk to elderly patients with diminished cognitive reserve in terms of post -operative 
cognitive dysfunction. In fact, age, cognitive reserve and chemotherapy are all important 
determinants of cognitive performance. (33) If feasibility is demonstrated in the current 
protocol, the proposed behavioral paradigm could then be tested in a more heterogenous adult patient population. The drug rampi[INVESTIGATOR_833084] a useful tool to assess the sensitivity of different patient populations to acute memory impairment by [CONTACT_833117]. The paradigm could be easily modified to assess memory function at various time points before and after intervention (as we have done to define memory 
decay characteristics in volunteers after receiving sedative and amnesic agents (16)). 
Substantial improvement in patient outcome may be possible if anesthetic management 
could be modified to decrease the incidence of POCD or delirium. Development of a 
behavioral measure of amnesia / memory dysfunction that can be easily applied in the 
clinical setting is a key component of this process.   
4.0 OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
4.1 Design  
Children either  requiring sedation or not for therapeutic or diagnostic procedures will be 
offered inclusion in the study. Sedation will be induced over a period of 10 minutes by 
[CONTACT_833118] (heavily sedated or asleep). During the infusion pi[INVESTIGATOR_833085]. After completion of the procedure, when the child is awake and being assessed for discharge, memory will be tested using forced choice recognition of pi[INVESTIGATOR_833086]. The child will indicate yes/no whether the pi[INVESTIGATOR_833087].  Children not requiring sedation will perform exactly the same 
tasks as  described above, but without any drug infusion.  
4.2 Intervention  
During induction of sedation, or in the case of no sedation, before the therapeutic 
procedure, children will be encouraged to name [CONTACT_833126][INVESTIGATOR_833088], one every 5 seconds, as drug concentration is increasing. Naming pi[INVESTIGATOR_833089]. The child’s response will be used to assess the degree of sedation present (response present / response absent). After  recovery from sedation, or after a similar time period after the therapeutic procedure

(approximately 40 min)  for children in the control group memory for the previously 
presented pi[INVESTIGATOR_833090] a yes/no response. The recognition testing set will 
contain both previously seen and novel items.  
5.[ADDRESS_1156812] Inclusion Criteria  
• The patient must be between 4 and 14 yrs of age and be undergoing a therapeutic 
or diagnostic procedure with or without sedation  
• The patient must be able to comprehend and perform the task (naming pi[INVESTIGATOR_499])  
• The patient must have a minimum weight of [ADDRESS_1156813] Exclusion Criteria  
• Allergy to propofol  (for those patients requiring sedation)  
• Procedure of short duration (< 15 min)  
• Pregnancy  
• Recent use (within 5 half -lives) of centrally acting medications that could affect 
concentration (e.g. diphenhydramine)  
6.0 RECRUITMENT PLAN  
Pediatric patients undergoing therapeutic or diagnostic procedures that might require 
sedation will be offered inclusion in the study on the day of the procedure upon arrival to the Pediatric Day Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. It is anticipated that between 2 and up to 5 patients a week will participate in this study.  
7.0 ASSESSMENT/EVALUATION PLAN  
The recognition memory task will consist of simple line drawings selected from a larger stimulus 
data base (http://crl.ucsd.edu/experiments/ipnp/method/getpi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]/getpi[INVESTIGATOR_1102].html ) based on their age 
appropriateness and identifiability by [CONTACT_833119]. Stimulus items are 
presented by [CONTACT_3553] a bound stimulus book with one black and white line drawing presented on each page. A brief test will be performed to familiarize the child with performing the pi[INVESTIGATOR_833091], using different pi[INVESTIGATOR_833092]. If the child is not 
able to cooperate sufficiently with the test task, then he/she will be withdrawn from the study  and 
propofol will then be administered as per normal clinical practice for their procedure. If sedation 
will be needed, propofol infusion will be started at a rate to deliver 3mg/kg over a [ADDRESS_1156814] pi[INVESTIGATOR_833093]. If sedation is being given, the drug infusion rate will be adjusted according to clinical observation (e.g. excessive sedation/no drug effect apparent) so that the 
patient will be appropriately sedated for the planned procedure by [CONTACT_2671] 10 minute 
infusion period. After conclusion of the initial infusion, propofol will be administered as per usual  
practice. Following the procedure after awakening in the PACU, when no apparent sedation is

Amended:  
present, or after a similar time period, if no sedation was used, the pi[INVESTIGATOR_833094]. Patients will again be presented the original pi[INVESTIGATOR_833095]. The order of pi[INVESTIGATOR_833096] 
(propofol infusion) and recognition phases(PACU) will be the same for every patient. The child will 
indicate whether the pi[INVESTIGATOR_833097] (yes/no). The study is complete. The child will be discharged form the PACU as per standard clinical criteria.”   
8.0 TOXICITIES/SIDE EFFECTS  
As is normally used for pediatric sedation, propofol will be used. As the length of sedation for the procedure is anticipated to be more than a few minutes, propofol will be infused 
using a drug infusion pump, as is routinely done now. Thus, no additional toxicities/side effects beyond those associated with the clinical administration of propofol as currently practiced are present.  
9.[ADDRESS_1156815] the feasibility of the proposed study design, including 1) accrual rate in the proposed 4 – 6 months study period, 2) drop- out rate (children who complete the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_833098]), 
and 3) sufficient data (e.g., few observations during the pi[INVESTIGATOR_833099]; few accurate responses during the memory task).   
The accrual and dropout rates will be addressed by [CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_007] a running tally of the number of recruited participants to monitor the recruitment numbers.  Our target is to recruit at least an average of 2 out of the anticipated 4 – [ADDRESS_1156816] been collected before we can begin calculating the proposed threshold statistic (Section 14 below).  The statistical computer packages may or may not be able to derive a stable estimate of the 
threshold measure per child.  This will have to be determined after each child’s data have 
been collected, entered, and fitted for the threshold statistics.  
It is premature to anticipate a statistically reliable difference between the two threshold measures, one for the sedative effect threshold and the other for the memory  effect 
threshold.  These will have to be ascertained after the data have been collected, entered, 
fitted, and plotted in the manner similar to Figures 1 and 2 above.  It is plausible that the threshold values are similar in some children and quite different in some other  children.  
An important goal of this study is to examine the variability between the two threshold values among the sample of children.   
10.0 CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY  
If the patient cannot adequately perform the pi[INVESTIGATOR_343191] (defined as verbally responding to >80% of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_833100], or half way through the list in the case of no sedation) through a significant portion of the initial 10 minute

infusion, data collection will be stopped, the patient withdrawn from the study, and no 
further testing be performed. Similarly, if the patient is unable or unwilling to perform the 
recognition task, he/she will be withdrawn from the study. In the extremely unusual 
circumstance of severe or unanticipated toxicity from the administration of propofol (e.g. 
allergic reaction), the participant will be withdrawn from the study . Any participant who is 
removed from the study prior to the start of their procedure for reasons other than toxiticity (i.e., inability or unwillingness to complete the practice or actual task) will then be 
administered  propofol  as per normal clinical practice for their procedure.

sedative effects of the  drug propofol.  The plan is to recruit a pi[INVESTIGATOR_219917] 40 children 
who will undergo sedation as part of their clinical management and give them a memory encoding task during propofol infusion to measure the effects of sedation.  The mere task 
of naming a pi[INVESTIGATOR_833101]. When the anesthesia has worn 
off (at approximately 1 hour later), children will be given a memory recognition task to 
measure the amnesic  effects of propofol.  We will also recruit a total of 30 children who w ill 
not undergo sedation to serve as a control group. This brings out total number of participants to 70.

psychophysics function.  The probability of declaring the study design feasible is 0.51 
when the true population feasibility is 0.70; and the probability of a feasible study  
increases to 0.92 when the true population feasibility is 0.80.  
Descriptive statistics will be sought to examine study feasibility.  A running tally of the number of recruited participants will be kept to monitor the recruitment numbers during the 
anticip ated 4 – [ADDRESS_1156818] study feasibility.  It would be impractical and unrealistic to set an a priori feasibility target.  Rather, we will monitor several factors, including patient volume, rate of study consent, the proportion of patients who can complete the experimental tasks and the 
practicality of fitting the psychophysical Weibul model described below.  Study feasibility 
will be evaluated holistically at the end of the study by [CONTACT_30967].  
 As for the minimally sufficient number of responses , the 10 -events -per-parameter rule of 
thumb may apply here . (34)  Although that rule was developed for logistic regression, 
which may or may not be too restrictive for the SAS NLMIXED procedure we intend to use to fit the threshold functions.

Aim 2.  Illustrative Examples .  Aim 2 involves the calculation of a “sedation threshold” 
and a “memory threshold” for each child.  Figures 1, and 2 provide illustrative examples on 
how the separate sedative and amnesic effects will be estimated statistically.  An example 
is provided below to explain the procedures and the analytic plan.  
1. “Sedation threshold”: During the 10- minute infusion of propofol, children will be 
presented with pi[INVESTIGATOR_391550] 5 -second intervals and asked to name [CONTACT_32360][INVESTIGATOR_1103].  They will be 
asked to name [CONTACT_365567][INVESTIGATOR_1103] (e.g., cat, tree, pencil, etc.). A valid response is naming of the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_833103] [ADDRESS_1156819] is a 
validated set of stimuli, as described in Section 7.0, some stimuli may end up being too 
difficult to name [CONTACT_833127]. Thus no response due to sedation may be 
confounded by [CONTACT_833120]. Responses from the control group of children will be used to eliminate problematic stimuli which reach a given criterion of no response at both sites. 
In Figures 1 and 2, the dark circles with a value of 1 on the y -axis represent that the 
participant is making valid responses.  The dark circles with a value of 0 on the y- axis 
represent lack of a valid response because the participant is sedated to the point of 
impaired response performance as  propofol concentration continues to increase.  As the 
child gets sedated and becomes gradually sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_833104], he/she is 
less likely to make a valid response (thus the increased frequency of dark circles at the bottom of the Figures as  image number increases).  The dark line in Figure [ADDRESS_1156820] literature in psychophysics on modeling the shapes of these curves.  Since the seminal paper by [CONTACT_833121] (1974; Kybernetik , 16: 65 -67: PMID: 4453110), the model 
below has been used extensively in modeling various psychophysical functions. We will use an asymmetric Weibull cumulative density function F(x) to model in the overall 
probability of a valid response G(x) over time x:  
𝐺(𝑥)= 0.5 + 0.5 ∙𝐹(𝑥) 
                          = 0.5 + 0.5 �1−e
−(α∙x)β�, 
where α > 0 and β > 0 are the scale and shape parameters, respectively, and x ≥ 0. (35)  
The constant of 0.5 assumes a 50 -50 chance of a random response in a psychophysical 
task.  Conventionally, the median of F(x) is called the “threshold” of the underlying 
psychometric function (the value of x for which F(x) = 0.5).  Because of the ass umed 0.50 
constant in G(x), and the 0.5 times the median of the Weibull, the threshold estimate is the 
x value of an overall 75% response probability given the Weibull parameters. The 
threshold of a psychometric function generally represents the strength of stimulus that elicits a sensation or a noticeable difference.  In this case the sedation threshold 
represents the time value of x when sedation is actuated.  We will estimate one sedation 
curve and its corresponding threshold for each child.

2. “Memory threshold”: When the anesthesia has worn off at approximately [ADDRESS_1156821] of 120 pi[INVESTIGATOR_833105].  At the presentation of each pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103], the child will be 
asked whether or not he/she remembers having seen it previously.  Each response will be 
coded as correct (true positives and true negatives) or incorrect (false positives and false negatives).  A curve may be fitted to the memory recognition data  to estimate the average 
memory decay function for each child.  In Figure 1 and 2 this is represented as the light 
gray curve, which can be modeled as 1 – G(x) above.  Similarly, a threshold represents 
the time value (pi[INVESTIGATOR_833080]) when memory fades below threshold.  
The sedation threshold in Figure 1 is at image 25 (250 seconds), while the memory  
threshold is at approximately image 28 (280 seconds).  This 30- second / 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_833106].  
Alternatively, in Figure 2, the  sedation  threshold is at image 58 (580 seconds) while the 
memory  threshold is approximately at image 40 (400 seconds).This larger difference of 
180 seconds / [ADDRESS_1156822] of 180 seconds can be inferred from the two threshold values. 
 
Calculations of the sedation and memory thresholds.   The overall statistical paradigm will 
involve  non-linea r regression modeling to estimate G(x) functions for the memory and 
sedation curves for each child in order to address the main hypothesis :  
“The threshold effect for memory will occur significantly soon er, i.e. at lower drug 
concentrations, than the threshold effect for sedation”.  
Sample Size Considerations .  The proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_219917] [ADDRESS_1156823] a pool of approximately 10 children who undergo anesthesia for clinical scans each week who would meet the eligibility criteria.  Among them an anticipated 50% would agree to participate in this study.  If half of these (2-3/week) produce data of sufficient quality to be able to perform curve fitting as described above, we expect to complete recruitment within 5 months. 
A sample of 35 children will also yield an 80% power in a one- sample t -test against the 
null that the difference in the sedation and memory thresholds is zero (null  ~ N(0, 1)), 
assuming a two -sided Type- I error rate of 0.05, and an alternative population distribution 
with a mean of 0.[ADDRESS_1156824] deviation of 1.0.  The statistical power was estimated by [CONTACT_941] G*Power computer program.

and (646) 735 -0003. Registrations can be phoned in or faxed. The completed signature 
[CONTACT_167000]/verbal script  and a completed Eligibility Checklist must be 
faxed to PPR.  
12.2 Randomization  
This study does not require randomization.  
13.0 DATA MANAGEMENT ISSUES  
A Research Study Assistant (RSA) will be assigned to the study. The responsibilities of 
the RSA  include project compliance, data collection, abstraction and entry, data reporting, 
regulatory  monitoring, problem  resolution and prioritization, and coordinat ing the activities 
of the protocol  study team. The data collected for this study will be entered into a secure 
database. Source  documentation will be available to support the computerized patient 
record.  All dat a will be maintained by [CONTACT_833122].  
13.1 Quality Assurance
Weekly registration reports will be generated to monitor patient accruals and 
completeness of registration data. Routine data quality reports will be generated to assess missing data and inconsistencies. Accrual rates and extent and accuracy of evaluations 
and follow -up will be monitored periodically throughout the study period and potential 
problems will be brought to the attention of the study team for discussion and action

13.2 Data and Safety Monitoring  
The Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) Plans at Memorial Sloan- Kettering Cancer Center 
were approved by [CONTACT_30589] 2001. The plans address the 
new policies set forth by [CONTACT_30590] “Essential Elements of a Data Safety and Monitoring Plan for Clinical Trials Funded by [CONTACT_6812]” which can be found at: 
http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/conducting/dsm -guidelines
. The DSM Plans at MSKCC 
were established and are monitored by [CONTACT_30591]. The MSKCC Data 
and Safety Monitoring Plans can be found on the MSKCC Intranet at:  
http://mskweb5.mskcc.org/intranet/_assets/_tables/content/359709/DSMPlans07.pdf .   
There are several different mechanisms by [CONTACT_30592], safety and quality. There are institutional processes in place for quality assurance (e.g., 
protocol monitoring, compliance and data verification audits, therapeutic response, and staff education on clinical research QA) and departmental procedures for quality control, plus there are two institutional committees that are responsible for monitoring the activities 
of our clinical trials programs. The committees: Data and Safety Monitoring Committee 
(DSMC) for Phase I and II clinical trials, and the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for Phase III clinical trials, report to the Center’s Research Council and Institutional Review Board. During the protocol development and review process, each 
protocol will be assessed for its level of risk and degree of monitoring required. Every type 
of protocol (e.g., NIH sponsored, in- house sponsored, industrial sponsored, NCI 
cooperative group, etc.) Will be addressed and the monitoring procedures will be established at the time of protocol activation.  
14.0 PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS  
As is routinely performed, a medical doctor will be present during drug administration and 
performance of the therapeutic procedure (usually MR scanning) and vital signs will be 
monitored by [CONTACT_833123]. After sedation is established, propofol dosing will be adjusted as per clinical routine during the therapeutic procedure. Each patient will be observed for as long as necessary after the conclusion of the procedure, and will meet the usual clinical discharge criteria used for ambulatory surgery.  
Side effects of sedative agents are more pronounced with bolus administration than continuous infusion. Using a continuous infusion to obtain targeted concentrations will minimize the potential side effects of propofol.  
No direct benefit to the participant is expected from participation in the study and participants will not be reimbursed for participation in the study.  
All members of the research study team will have current certification in HIPAA Regulations and Human Subjects Protection as required by [CONTACT_18121]. Every effort will be made to ensure that this study  is conducted within the federal, state, local and institutional 
guidelines regarding research involving the use of human subjects. To this end, the 
following will be done:

 SYNOPSIS:  
 
Primary Objectives: 
 
1. To evaluate the safety of pembrolizumab in combination with pTVG -HP in patients with 
castration -resistant, metastatic prostate cancer  
2. To determine the 6- month progression- free survival and median time to radiographic 
progression in patients with castration- resistant metastatic prostate cancer treated with 
pembrolizumab in combination with pTVG- HP 
3. To evaluate the anti -tumor response rates (objective response rate and PSA response rate, 
using PCWG2 criteria) in patients with castration -resistant metastatic prostate cancer 
treated with pembrolizumab in combination with pTVG- HP 
 
Secondary Objectives: 
 
1. To determine whether either treatment sequence, or PAP -specific immune response, is 
associated with prolonged (6-month) radiographic progression- free survival  
2. To evaluate effects of schedule (concurrent versus delayed administration of 
pembrolizumab) on the magnitude of PAP -specific T -cell responses, PD -1 expression on 
circulating T cells, and PD -L1 expression on circulating epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663] (CEC) and on 
tumor biopsies 
3. To determine the median time to radiographic progression using concurrent administration 
schedules 
 
Exploratory Objectives:  
 
1. To evaluate effects of treatment on the number of circulating tumor cells  
2. To evaluate PAP -specific antibody responses following treatment with pembrolizumab and 
pTVG- HP DNA vaccine  
3. To determine whether treatment with either sequence elicits immunologic antigen spread to other prostate associated antigens 
4. To determine whether pre -existing or vaccine -induced PD -L1 expression on CEC or tumor 
biopsies is predictive of objective clinical response 
5. To determine whether treatment elicits expression of other regulatory molecules on tumor -
specific T cells (e.g. TIM3, BTLA, and LAG3) or tumor cells (e.g. HVEM, phosphatidyl serine, PD -L2)   
6. To determine whether PD -1-regulated antigen -specific T -cells identified by [CONTACT_15179] -1 
blockade therapy in combination with pTVG- HP 
7. To determine whether changes in lymph nodes and soft tissue tumor lesions are observed by [CONTACT_15180] /CT after treatment with vaccine with or without pembrolizumab  
8. To determine if PD -1 inhibitor therapy in combination with pTVG -HP will change number 
and activity (SUV) in osteoblastic metastases as measured by [CONTACT_15181]/CT .

Version 04/06/[ADDRESS_14548] common tumor among men, and the second leading cause of male 
cancer -related death in the [LOCATION_002] [ 1].  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_15110], 
over 30,000 U.S. men are estimated to die as a result of prostate cancer in 2014 [ 1].  Treatment 
with surgery and radiation remain effective for presumed organ- confined disease, however 
approximately one third of these patients will have progressive or metastatic disease at 10 years [2].  Prostate cancer, once it becomes metastatic, is not curable and is generally initially treated 
with androgen deprivation, and androgen deprivation remains the cornerstone on which other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_15111] [ 3].  Unfortunately, within typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 2- [ADDRESS_14549] been approved by [CONTACT_15182].  Specifically, docetaxel was approved in 2004 after two large randomized trials showed a 2 -3 month median improvement in 
overall survival compared with mitoxantrone [ 4, 5].  Cabazitaxel was approved in 2010 for patients 
with disease refractory to docetaxel after an international trial demonstrated a similar 2 -3 month 
median improvement in overall survival compared with mitoxantrone [ 6].  Also in 2010, 
sipuleucel -T (Provenge®, Dendreon Corporation) was approved for patients with minimally 
symptomatic castrate -resistant, metastatic prostate cancer, based on the results of a prospectively 
randomized, blinded, phase III placebo- controlled clinical trial, and supporting data from previous 
phase III clinical trials, demonstrating a median 4 -month improvement in overall survival [ 7].  
Finally, i n 2011 and 2013, abiraterone  and enzalutamide , agents targeting androgen synthesis or 
signaling, were  similarly approved in the setting of docetaxel- refractory, castrate -resistant 
metastatic prostate cancer following prospectively  randomized, blinded, placebo -controlled trial 
demonstrating a 2-3- month median improvement in overall survival  [8, 9].  These recent advances 
have clearly improved the situation for patients with advanced prostate cancer, however have presented new challenges in terms of the optimal sequence and approach to the management of castrate -resistant disease.   
 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_15112], many patients and treating 
physicians believe that the small overall survival benefit provided by [CONTACT_15183], in part due to potential side effects [ 10].  Vaccine- based strategies, also 
known as active immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], are particularly appealing as potentially safer treatments , and 
the trials that led to the approval of sipuleucel -T showed markedly fewer adverse events than are 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_15113] [ 7].  Many vaccines for prostate cancer are in clinical 
development, all of which have demonstrated similar safety profiles, and some of which have demonstrated anti -tumor activity, as we have recently reviewed [ 11, 12, 13, 14].  There has also 
been interest in developi[INVESTIGATOR_15114]- specific immune -activating therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as through T -
cell checkpoint blockade.  Inhibitors of PD/PD -L1 or CTLA -4, for example, have demonstrated 
remarkable efficacy alone or in combination for metastatic melanoma [ 15, 16, 17], and PD/PD -L 
blockade inhibitors have demonstrated activity as single agents for several solid tumor types [ 18, 
19].  Targetin g PD -1, in particular, should be a universal therapy, as it targets the T -cell 
compartment rather than the tumor directly.  However, in separate phase I trials with PD -1 
blocking antibodies, there has been no objective response observed to patients (n=25) with metastatic prostate cancer [ 18, 19].  The difference in response to certain tumors, with higher 
frequencies of responses observed in patients with renal cell cancer, melanoma and non -small cell 
lung cancer compared to prostate cancer, for example, suggest that differences are likely due to 
 
 
Version 04/06/[ADDRESS_14550] one of the ligands 
for PD -1 (PD -L1) on the target tumor cell by [CONTACT_15184] 
[18].  This is expected, given that tissue -infiltrating T cells can induce the expression of PD -L1 
via the expression of IFNγ.  Notwithstanding, some tumors that are known to express PD -L1, such 
as prostate cancer [20], have demonstrated little response to treatment with PD -1 blockade as 
single- agent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_15115] [18, 19 ].   
  
In pr eliminary studies  (further described below), we have recently identified in a murine model 
using a vaccine targeting a tumor antigen that DNA immunization leads to the generation of CD8+ 
T cells with cytolytic activity, and that these cells express PD -1. Moreover, immunization leads to 
a compensatory response in the tumor to increase expression of PD-L1.  In further studies, efforts to increase the number and avidity of CD8+ T cells with cytolytic activity by [CONTACT_15185]-tumor immune response due 
to this PD -1/PD -L1 upregulation.  Blockade of this pathway using antibodies blocking either PD-
[ADDRESS_14551].  Importantly, immunization with the vaccine encoding the native (unmodified) antigen in combination with an antibody blocking PD -[ADDRESS_14552] durable, objective 
anti-tumor responses in patients with metastatic cancer [
21]. 
 Prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) is a model antigen for vaccine -based treatment strategies 
targeting prostate cancer.  PAP is a well -defined protein whose expression is essentially restricted 
to normal and malignant prostate tissue [ 22].  It is also one of only a few known prostate -specific 
proteins for which there is a rodent homologue, thereby [CONTACT_15186] [23].  Data from independent labs has demonstrated that, 
in a rat model, vaccine strategies targeting PAP can result in PAP -specific CD8+ T -cells, the 
presumed population mediating tumor cell destruction, and anti -tumor responses [ 24, 25, 26, 27].  
PAP is the target antigen of the autologous antigen-presenting cell sipuleucel -T vaccine in which 
autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells are loaded ex vivo  with a PAP -GM-CSF fusion 
protein.  A separate phase I clinical trial evaluated dendritic cells loaded with a murine homologue of PAP, and demonstrated immunogenicity of this approach [ 28].  In rodent studies, we have 
similarly demonstrated that PAP can be immunologically targeted using genetic vaccines, and a plasmid DNA va ccine in particular [ 25, 26].   We have previously reported the results of a phase 
I/II trial conducted in patients with early, PSA -recurr ent (clinical stage D0) prostate cancer using 
this same DNA vaccine (pTVG -HP).  No significant adverse events were observed in 22 subjects 
treated over a 12- week period of time.  Moreover, several patients developed evidence of PAP -
specific CD4+ and CD8+ T -cells, and several patients experienced a prolongation in the PSA 
doubling time, demonstrating immunological efficacy and suggesting a possible anti- tumor effect 
[29].  The presence of long- term IFNγ -secreting immune responses to PAP, detectable at multiple 
times months after immunization, were associated with increases in PSA doubling tim e, suggesting 
this might serve as a rational biomarker for efficacy [ 30].  Moreover, it was found that immune 
responses could be augmented months later with repeated immunizations, suggesting that DNA vaccines might provide a simple means of eliciting tumor -specific CD8+ T cells [ 31].  These 
 
 
Version 04/06/[ADDRESS_14553] ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  Finally, fur ther preliminary studies have suggested 
that patients previously treated with pTVG -HP have circulating PAP -specific CD8+ T cells with 
PD-1 expression and circulating EpCam+ circulating epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663] (CEC) with PD -L1 
expression, analogous to our findings  in murine models.  These finding suggest that the pTVG -HP 
vaccine might specifically be used to elicit CD8+ T cells specific for prostate tumors, the efficacy of which could be augmented with concurrent treatment with PD -1 blockade.  Collectively, these 
findings form the rationale for the current trial.   
 
 
2. Background and Rationale 
 
A. PAP is a tumor antigen in prostate cancer and PAP -specific CD8+ CTL can lyse prostate 
cancer cells  
 
PAP was first identified in 1938 and was initially used as a serum marker for the detection of prostate cancer [22, 32].  PAP expression in normal and malignant prostate cells is well -
documented, and is still used in immunohistochemical staining to establish a prostate origin of 
metastatic carcinoma [33].  The ubiquitous expression of PAP in prostate tissue makes it an 
appealing antigen as a potential “universal” target for immune -directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_15116], unlike specific oncogenes that may or may not be expressed by a particular tumor.  Moreover, it  has been demonstrated that some patients with prostate cancer have preexisting 
antibody and T -cell responses to PAP, suggesting that tolerance to this “self” protein can be 
circumvented in vivo  [34, 35].  In particular, the demonstration of Th1- like immune responses 
specific for PAP suggest that an immune environment permissive of an anti -tumor response can 
exist in patients even without immunization [ 36].  Moreover, we have previously demonstrated 
that CD8+ T cells specific for PAP, with cytolytic activity for prostate cancer cells, can exist in patients  with prostate cancer, and can be augmented with vaccination [ 30, 36]. 
 
B. PD-1 blockade 
 A major mechanism by [CONTACT_15187] -L1 or 
PD-L2, ligands for a receptor on T cells (PD -1), activation of which can decrease T -cell function 
and lead to immune tolerance.  There is currently great enthusiasm t o specifically develop PD/PD -
L blockade inhibitors given the relative paucity of adverse events observed with these agents in 
clinical trials , and long- term disease response observed in some instances in early phase clinical 
trials.    Targeting PD -1, in particular, should be a universal therapy, as it targets the T -cell 
compartment rather than the tumor directly.  However, clinical trial experience to date suggests that patients with some solid tumor types (notably renal cell cancer, melanoma and non- small  cell 
lung cancer) experience more benefit than patients with other histologies, including prostate cancer [18, 19].  This dispa rity suggests that differences are due to differences in the T -cells of responding 
and non- responding patients.  In particular, higher frequencies of tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes 
(TIL) are typi[INVESTIGATOR_15117] a than prostate cancer 
[37].  In addition, early phase clinical trials using PD -[ADDRESS_14554] one of the ligands for PD -1 (PD -L1) on the target tumor cell by [CONTACT_15188] [ 18].  This is expected, given that tissue -infiltrating T 
cells can induce the expression of PD -L1 via the expression of IFNγ, and ligand binding of PD -1 
 
 
Version 04/06/[ADDRESS_14555] infiltrating PD -1-expressing T cells [20].  Taken together, these 
results suggest that the efficacy of anti- tumor immunotherapy could be increased for prostate 
cancer by [CONTACT_15189] -specific T cells,  such as through 
vaccination, and by [CONTACT_4002]-1/PD -ligand blockade.   
 
Given the anti -tumor responses observed in early phase clinical trials with antibodies targeting 
either PD -[ADDRESS_14556] been developi[INVESTIGATOR_15118].  A t 
the time of this writing, only one agent has yet been approved as a therapy, pembrolizumab (Keytruda®, [COMPANY_006]).  Specifically, pembrolizumab was approved in September 2014 for the treatment of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -refractory advanced melanoma as a “breakthrough” th erapy on the basis 
of an open- label, international, multicenter expansion cohort of a phase I trial of patients with 
advanced (metastatic) melanoma whose disease had progressed following treatment with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] [ 38].  In that trial, 173 patients received pembrolizumab at one of two doses (2 mg/kg 
or 10 mg/kg) at 3- week intervals until disease progression or intolerable toxicity.  An overall 
response rate of 26% was observed, irrespective of dose [38].  Grade 3 fatigue was the only drug-
related grade 3 o r 4 adverse event reported in more than one patient.  Given these findings, 
pembrolizumab is currently FDA approved for the treatment of patients with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -
refractory melanoma, dosed at 2 mg/kg intravenously every [ADDRESS_14557] suggested that treatment can lead to prolonged responses even after discontinuing treatment [ 15].    
  
C. DNA vaccines can elicit antigen -specific Th1/CTL immune responses 
 Over the last decade, there has been considerable int erest in the development of plasmid DNA -
based vaccines, a strategy that offers several distinct advantages over other methods of antigen delivery.  DNA can be rapi[INVESTIGATOR_15119], and there are no problems with solubility as there frequently are with peptides and recombinant protein vaccines.  In addition, because the DNA in nucleic acid vaccines has been demonstrated to be taken up and expressed by [CONTACT_15190] d presented by [CONTACT_15191] -presenting cells (APC) directly [ 39, 40, 41], antigen 
presentation occurs through naturally processed epi[INVESTIGATOR_322], and does not require autologous cell processing.  DNA vaccines can therefore be theoretically employed in an HLA -independent 
fashion unlike peptide -based vaccines that are necessarily HLA -restricted.  This strategy is ideal 
in the HLA -diverse human situation.  In many ways, this method of immunization is similar to the 
use of viral immunization vectors, however without the additional foreign antigens introduced with  
a viral vector and consequently less of a risk of an overwhelming immune response to the vector itself [26, 42].  Of importance in tumor immunization models, several groups have demonstrated 
that immunization with plasmid DNA encoding a target antigen is a potent means of eliciting Th1 -
biased immune responses [43] and CD8+ T -cells specific for the targeted antigen [ 39, 44, 45, 46, 
47].  In animal models, the use of an intradermal route of vaccine administration, in particular, 
tends to promote this Th1/CTL -biased immune response [ 43, 48, 49].  It should also be 
acknowledged that the clinical efficacy of a DNA vaccine encoding tyrosinase for the treatment of canine melanoma was approved by [CONTACT_15192] 2010 based on the results of clinical studies demonstrating an improved survival of companion dogs with oral melanoma [ 50, 51].  In fact, this 
represents the first vaccine approved in the U.S. for the treatment of existing cancer.   Thus, this 
approa ch bears further investigation in human clinical trials .

 D. DNA vaccine encoding PAP (pTVG -HP) can elicit antigen -specific CD4+ and CD8+ T 
cells in patients with prostate cancer  
 
We have previously reported that DNA vaccines encoding either the human or rat homologue of PAP can elicit PAP -specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in rats, suggesting a feasible means of 
eliciting PAP -specific anti -tumor immune responses in patients [ 25, 26].  We have subsequently 
reported the results from a phase I/II clinical trial in which subjects with non -castrate, non-
metastatic prostate cancer were immunized six times at two -week intervals with this same DNA 
vaccine.  The primary objectives of that trial were to evaluate the safety and immunological efficacy of the pTVG -HP DNA vaccine in patients with clinical stage D0 prostate cancer [ 52].  
This was a dose- escalation study, with an expanded cohort of subjects treated at the maximum 
tolerated dose.  In the dose -escalation portion, nine subjects were treated in three dose cohorts of 
100 µg, 500 µg, or 1500 µg DNA, administered intradermally every two weeks for six total immunizations.  200 µg GM -CSF was co -administered as a vaccine adj uvant with each 
immunization.  13 additional subjects were treated in an expanded cohort at the 1500 µg DNA dose.  No serious adverse events were observed, and no significant laboratory anomalies were observed.  Common events observed were grade 1/2 fevers , chills, and local site reactions lasting 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_15120] 24 hours.  The primary immunological endpoint of this trial was the induction 
of PAP -specific IFN γ-secreting effector CD8+ T cells detectable two weeks following the final 
immunization.  As previously reported, three patients had a significant increase in the number of PAP-specific IFN γ-secreting CD8+ T cells after immunization compared with pre -immunization, 
one patient from each dose cohort [ 29].  Several individuals experienced a prolongation in PSA 
doubling time over one year following treatment compared with pre -treatment.  Overall the median 
PSA doubling time was 6.5 months in the four months pre -treatment and 8.5 months in the 4-
month on-treatment period (p = 0.033).  Long- term PAP -specific IFN γ-secreting T -cell responses 
were observed in several patients up to one year after immunization; the presence of this persistent 
immunity was associated with favorable changes in PSA doubling time [ 30].   
 A second pi[INVESTIGATOR_15121] -resistant, non -radiographically metastatic prostate cancer.  This trial was designed to 
answer the question of  whether six immunizations were  insufficient in some individuals to develop 
an immune response, and whether ongoing repetitive immunization might be necessary.  This trial demonstrated that PAP -specific immune responses developed in some individuals after as few as 
3-6 immunizations, and some individuals developed no detectable immune responses after even 
24 biweekly immunizations [ 31].  Favorable changes in PSA doubling time were again observed, 
and tended to be greatest in pati ents with evidence of long- term immunity [31].  The findings from 
both of the trials above have prov ided the rationale for a randomized phase II clinical trial 
evaluating this same DNA vaccine to determine whether vaccination prolongs time to disease progression, a multicenter trial that is currently underway ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).    
E. DNA vaccine with PD pathway  blockade elicits anti -tumor response in murine model 
 Given our findings in human trials that some patients did not develop evidence of immune response, and even those that did still showed evidence of disease progression, we have sought to evaluate methods to increase the efficacy of DNA vaccines and evaluate potential mechanisms of 
tumor escape.  For these efforts we have focused on vaccine strategies targeting SSX2, a “neoantigen,” and one for which we have identified that there are only two HLA -A2-restricted 
 
 
Version 04/06/2021  15 
 epi[INVESTIGATOR_322], one dominant (p103- 111) and one subdominant (p41-49) , providing a convenient 
preclinical model  [53].  Using the HHD- II strain of mice, which expresses human HLA -A2 and 
HLA- DR1 and is knocked out for murine MHC class I and II [ 54], we have demonstrated that 
immunization with a DNA plasmid encoding SSX2 elicits robust CD8+ T cells that can be 
identified by [CONTACT_15193] γ ELISPOT [36, 53, 55].  We have also generated a 
syngeneic sarcoma cell line in this HHD -II strain, and transfected this to express SSX2 
(Sarc/SSX2).  Using this system, we have explored whether the CD8+ effector T -cell response can 
be augmented using plasmid DNA vaccines modified to encode stronger MHC class I binding 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_322].  Using peptides with point mutations demonstrated to increase HL A-A2 binding affinity, 
we demonstrated that direct immunization could elicit CD8+ T cells with cross -reactive 
recognition for the native epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230], and that these cells could lyse peptide -loaded target cells, and 
human prostate tumor cells expressing native SSX2 and HLA -A2 [56].  Having identified altered 
peptide ligands (APL) for each epi[INVESTIGATOR_15122] a higher frequency of epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230] -specific T cells, 
we next encoded these APL within the coding sequence of an SSX2 plasmid DNA vaccine.  HHD -
II mice, without tumors, were immunized with plasmids encoding one or two modified epi[INVESTIGATOR_322], modified at single amino acids.  We have reported that immunization with a plasmid encoding 
both modified epi[INVESTIGATOR_15123] a greater frequency of T cells specific for both epi[INVESTIGATOR_15124] (pTVG -SSX2)  [56
].  Immunization with a DNA vaccine with point 
mutations ablating HLA -A2 binding elicited no peptide -specific T cells.  The plasmid DNA with 
two HLA- A2-optimized point mutation s (pTVG -SSX2opt) was then evaluated for anti -tumor 
efficacy in studies in which Sarc/SSX2 tumors were implanted prior to imm unization.  As shown 
in Figure 1, animals receiving the native SSX2 gene by [CONTACT_15194] a marked decrease  
in tumor growth rate, but complete tumor eradication was not observed.  Unexpectedly, and replicated in several additional studies, tumor -bearing mice receiving the pTVG -SSX2
opt DNA 
vaccine had greater  tumor growth compared with the native pTVG -SSX2 vaccine.  To evaluate 
possible means of immune avoidance, we evaluated tumor cells for expression of PD -L1.  
Sarc/SSX2 tumor cells treated with IFNγ in vitro upregulated PD -L1 as detected by [CONTACT_4133] 
(not shown).  Moreover, as shown in Figure 2, Sarc/SSX2 tumors from mice immunized with 
either pTVG -SSX2 or pTVG -SSX2opt, but not vector control, upregulated PD -L1 expression, 
suggesting that PD -L1 expression was induced by [CONTACT_15195]- specific T cells.  This was further 
demonstrated by [CONTACT_15196]- SSX2opt with tumor cells 
in vitro – PD-L1 expression was increased compared with treatment of tumor cells with 
splenocytes from control -immunized mice (data not shown).  Next, as shown in Figure 3, antigen -
specific CD8+ T cells detected by [CONTACT_15197] -1 expressing in mice 
immunized with pTVG -SSX2opt compared with mice immunized with the native pTVG -SSX2 
vector .  Finally, as shown in Figure 4, combining vaccine treatment with an antibody blocking PD -
1 (clone G4, courtesy of [CONTACT_15298][INVESTIGATOR_15125]) was found to elicit a greater anti -tumor response than 
treatment with either vaccine or anti -PD1 alone.  Similar results were demonstrated in separate 
studies with the native vaccine alone in combination with anti -PD-1 treatment (not shown), and 
tumor eradication was observed in 5/10 animals treated with either vaccine combination (not shown).  Taken together, these findings demonstrate that PD -L1 expression by [CONTACT_15198], induced by 
[CONTACT_488]- specific CD8+ T cells, is a mechanism of tumor immune  escape, and this can be abrogated 
by [CONTACT_4002] -1 blockade.  
 Given these  findings , we next asked whether other immune regulatory markers were increased 
following immunization.  Splenocytes from animals treated with a DNA vaccine encoding native or optimized SSX2 were collected and antigen- specific CD3+CD8+ T cells were assessed for 
 
 
Version 04/06/[ADDRESS_14558].  Expression of CD244 was higher on tetramer+ cells from animals 
immunized with the native vaccine than with the control or modified construct.  These findings demonstra te that combining T -cell regulatory receptor blockade with anti- PD-1 with a T -cell 
activating therapy (DNA vaccine) is a rational clinical direction, and this is the primary endpoint of this trial.  Moreover, our murine studies suggest that other regulatory receptors might also be affected by [CONTACT_15199], and hence the evaluation of this will be an exploratory endpoint of this trial.   
 In further preclinical studies to evaluate the possible role of PD -1 in patients who previously 
received a DNA vaccine encoding PAP, we used a delayed- type hypersensitivity (DTH) model 
(developed by [CONTACT_15200]. William Burlingham, PhD) to evaluate mechanisms of immune regulation, similar to studies we have previously reported [ 57].  While a small number, we have 
found in 2 of 2 patients evaluated prior to and after DNA vaccination that PD -1 blockade, like 
CTLA -4 blockade, could restore effector function (as measured by [CONTACT_15201]) of PAP -specific T cells 
elicited with vaccination (Figure 6).  We also found in a patient previously treated with pTVG -
HP, who then subsequently received sipuleucel -T for metastatic disease, that PD -L1 expression 
could be directly detected on  circulating CD45
-EpCAM+ cells (Figure 7 ).  These studies form the 
basis for further exploratory studies proposed, to determine whether the trans vivo DTH method 
used can identify patients with antigen- specific PD -1-mediated regulation as eith er a predictive 
biomarker or measure of response, and whether similarly the presence of PD -L1 can be detected 
on circulating epi[INVESTIGATOR_018] (tumor) cells as a predictive biomarker or measure of response, similar to what has been proposed for other studies using PD -1 blocking antibodies [ 18].

on tumors relative to controls.

F. Summary  
 The current protoco l will examine the use of a plasmid DNA vaccine encoding PAP to induce 
and/or augment therapeutic T -cells specific for the prostate tumor antigen PAP in patients with 
castrate -resistant, metastatic pr ostate cancer with concurrent or subsequent treatment with a PD 
pathway inhibitor, pembrolizumab.  The primary endpoint, objective response, is based on observations from previous early phase clinical trials demonstrating no objective disease response in patients treated with PD -[ADDRESS_14559] blockade was combined with tumor antigen -
specific vaccination.  This trial will explore whether there is a preferred sequence of treatment, and will in secondary and exploratory endpoints evaluate whether sequential or concurrent treatment affects the character and magnitude of the immune response.  Further studies will explore whether the identification of antigen -specific PD-1-regulated T -cells is predictive for response to 
combined treatment.  An additional exploratory endpoint will be to identify whether changes in 
FLT PET scan s, particularly in systemic lymph nodes  or lymph nodes in the area of immunization, 
might serve as a molecular imaging tool to identify immunological activation following immunization with or without pembrolizumab . The trial will be conducted in patients with 
castrate -resistant, metastatic prostate cancer, as this is the lethal form of prostate cancer and one 
for which there is a high need for therapi[INVESTIGATOR_15128] a greater safety profile and greater magnitude of benefit.  Moreover, based on published studies, the median time to disease progression in this stage

vaccination alone in published studies in this stage of disease [7, 58], simplifying the identification 
of potential benefit, and potential magnitude of such benefit, for planning future confirmatory clinical trials.   
 In May [ADDRESS_14562] 1 2 evaluable subjects per study 
arm, those arms will be closed to fu rther accrual, with an extended treatment cohort (Arm 3) that 
will be opened to accrual as described below.    In early [ADDRESS_14563] one treatm ent with DNA and pembrolizumab. At that point, 2 of 
11 patients treated in Arm 3 had no evidence of PSA decline from baseline, which was lower than 
expected from what had been observed in Arm 1 (in which 8 of 13 patients had some  PSA decline 
from baseline,  p=0.04). In addition, while not a clinical parameter, the frequency of immune 
response to the PAP target antigen was observed in the laboratory to be overall lower than what 
had been observed in either Arm 1 or Arm 2.  Given these findings, and given that  the primary 
change from Arm 1 to Arm 3 was in changing the vaccine schedule from every 2 weeks to every 3 weeks, it was decided to add an additional treatment arm that would keep the vaccine schedule at 2-week intervals, but continuing combined treatment beyond 12 weeks.  The schedule for 
pembrolizumab was increased to every 4 weeks for patient convenience and with the goal of reducing toxicity, since adverse events > grade 2 experienced to date were all attributed to pembrolizumab. This extended treatment  cohort (Arm 4) will open to accrual after completion of 
enrollment to Arm 3.

Version 04/06/2021  20 
 B. Secondary Objectives:  
 
1. To determine whether either treatment sequence, or PAP -specific immune response, is 
associated with prolonged (6-month) radiographic progression- free survival  
 
2. To evaluate effects of schedule (concurrent versus delayed administration of pembrolizumab) on the magnitude of PAP -specific T -cell responses, PD -1 expression on 
circulating T cells, and PD -L1 expression on circulating epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663] (CEC) and on 
tumor biopsies  
3. To determine the median time to radiographic progression using concurrent administrati on 
schedules  
 
C. Laboratory and Exploratory Objectives: 
 
1. To evaluate effects of treatment on number of circulating tumor cells  
 
2. To evaluate PAP -specific antibody responses following treatment with pembrolizumab and 
pTVG- HP DNA vaccine  
 
3. To determine whether either treatment sequence elicits immunologic antigen spread to other prostate -associated antigens  
 
4. To determine whether pre -existing or vaccine -induced PD -L1 expression on CEC or tumor 
biopsies is predictive of objective clinical response  
5. To determine whether treatment elicits expression of other regulatory molecules on tumor -
specific T cells (e.g. TIM3, BTLA, and LAG3) or tumor cells (e.g. HVEM, phosphatidyl serine, PD -L2)   
 
6. To determine whether PD -1-regulated antigen- specific T cell s identified by [CONTACT_15203] -1 blockade 
therapy in combination with pTVG- HP 
 
7. To determine whether changes in lymph nodes and soft tissue tumor lesions are observed by [CONTACT_15180] /CT after treatment with vaccine with or without pembrolizumab  
 
8. To determine if PD -1 inhibitor therapy in combination with pTVG -HP will change number 
and activity (SUV) in osteoblastic metastases as measured by [CONTACT_15181]/CT . 
  
4. Product Information  
 
A. Anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (Pembrolizumab, Keytruda®)   
 
Pembrolizumab (Keytruda®, [COMPANY_006]) is a human programmed death receptor -1 (PD -1)-blocking 
antibody indicated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and 
 
 
Version 04/06/2021  21 
 disease progression follo wing ipi[INVESTIGATOR_164], if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF 
inhibitor.  While this agent is commercially available and will be purchased for use, its use is 
investigational under this protocol.  The same dose and schedule will be used in this protocol as for the approved melanoma indication.  Specifically, it will be administered at 2 mg/kg as an 
intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 3 weeks (up to four maximum doses).  Actual current body weight will be used to calculate the dose for each treatment. Pembrolizumab will be administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes using an IV line containing a sterile, non-pyrogenic, low -protein binding 0.2 µm to 5 µm in- line or add- on filter, and according to its 
package insert.   
 NOTE:  For the expansion cohort (Arm 3), t his will similarly use a dose of 2 mg/kg 
pembrolizumab, but with 200 mg maximum dose, administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 3 weeks for up to a maximum of 16 doses .  For the second expansion cohort (Arm 
4), this will similarly use a dose of 2 mg/kg pembrolizumab, but with [ADDRESS_14564] common adverse reactions (reported in > 20% of patients) included fatigue, cough, 
nausea, pruritis, rash, decreased appetite, constipation, arthralgia, and diarrhea.  Immune -mediated 
adverse reactions have also been observed, including immune -mediated pneumonitis , colitis, 
hepatitis, hypophysitis, nephritis, hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism.  The management of suspected adverse reactions is discussed in Section 8 below.  
 
B. Plasmid DNA vaccine  
 
 pTVG-HP (pTVG4 vector containing cDNA for human PAP) 
 pTVG- HP is a plasmid DNA, produced in E. coli, that encodes the cDNA for human prostatic acid 
phosphatase (PAP).  DNA from the master cell bank bacterial strain has been confirmed by [CONTACT_15204].  The biological activity of each lot has been tested in rodent studies demonstrating that T -cell immune responses specific for PAP can be 
elicited in vivo following immunization.  Lots  are tested for appearance, plasmid homogeneity, 
DNA identity by [CONTACT_15205], protein contamination, RNA contamination, genomic DNA contamination, sterility, endotoxin, and pH, and criteria for each of these have been established for lot release.  The vaccine will be supplied in single -use vials containing at least 0.6 
mL 0.2 mg/mL pTVG- HP in phosphate -buffered saline.  Vials will be stored at <–60°C until the 
day of use.    
GM-CSF 
 GM-CSF (Leukine®, Sargramostim), will be obtained from commercial vendor (such as 
Genzyme, Cambridge, MA, or other commercial vendor ) and used as a vaccine adjuvant and will 
be provided without charge to subjects participating in this trial. GM -CSF, as described above, is 
a growth factor that supports the survival, clonal expansion and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells including dendritic antigen presenting cells.  In preliminary animal experiments and human clinical trials GM- CSF has been shown to be safe and serve as an effective adjuvant 
for the induction of antibody and T -cell responses to the immunized antigen [ 59, 60].  The use of 
 
 
Version 04/06/2021  22 
 GM-CSF is associated with little toxicity [ 61, 62, 63].  GM -CSF is a sterile, white, preservative-
free, lyophilized powder supplied in 250 µg-dose vials.   
 Recombinant human GM -CSF (rhGM -CSF), when administered intravenously or subcutaneously 
is generally well tolerated at doses rang ing from 50 to 500 µg/m
2/day.  Severe toxic manifestations 
are extremely rare in patients treated with rhGM- CSF.  Diarrhea, asthenia, rash and malaise were 
the only events observed in more than 5% of the rhGM -CSF group compared with the placebo 
group in phase III controlled studies of patients undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation.  In uncontrolled phase I/II studies for various indications, the adverse effects reported most frequently were fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, asthenia, headache and pain in the 
bones, chest, abdomen, joints, or muscles.  Most of these systemic events reported with rhGM -
CSF administration were mild to moderate in severity and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_15130].  Other events reported infrequently were dyspnea, edema, local injection site reactions, and rash.  Thrombosis and cardiac arrhythmia have also been reported, and there have been infrequent reports of tissue sloughing, leukemic progression, congestive heart failure, hepatomegaly, and intracranial bleeding; and isolated reports of Guillain- Barré syndrome 
and increased histiocytes.  Neutropenia, although usually a pre -existing condition in the patients 
receiving rhGM -CSF, has been reported in association with administration.  There  was an 
increased frequency of severe thrombocytopenia in patients receiving concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy with GM-CSF.  Eosinophilia and other blood abnormalities may occur.  There have been rare reports of 1) sequestration of granulocytes in the lungs with respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856]; 2) a syndrome characterized by [CONTACT_15206][INVESTIGATOR_1506], hypoxia, flushing, orthostatic hypotension, and partial loss of consciousness; 3) peripheral edema, pericardial or pleural effusions, and capi[INVESTIGATOR_15131]; and 4) serious allergic or anaphylactic reactions.  
 Administration of rhGM -CSF may aggravate fluid retention in patients with pre -existent edema, 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_12737], or pleural or pericardial effusions.  In some patients with pre -existing 
renal or hepatic  dysfunction, elevation of the serum creatinine or bilirubin and hepatic enzymes 
has occurred during the administration of rhGM -CSF.  Dose reduction or interruption of rhGM -
CSF administration has resulted in a decrease to pretreatment values.  Occasional t ransient and 
reversible supraventricular arrhythmia has been reported in uncontrolled studies, particularly in patients with a previous history of cardiac arrhythmia.  Stimulation of marrow precursors with rhGM -CSF may result in a rapid rise in white blood cell 
count.  Dosing should be stopped if the ANC exceeds 20,000/cm
3.  rhGM -CSF may stimulate the 
growth of myeloid malignancies; therefore, caution must be exercised in its use in these malignancies or myelodysplastic syndromes.  Because GM- CSF will only be administered at most once every two weeks on the current protocol, 
most of these side effects are not anticipated.  In previous vaccine studies using rhGM -CSF as an 
adjuvant in an identical fashion, local skin reactions consisting of erythema and induration have occurred in many patients.  These resolved without need for treatment over a 2- [ADDRESS_14565].  Transient leukopenia (lasting only a couple of hours) has been observed in some patients, and resolved without tre atment and without clinical sequelae [ 64].  In 
previous clinical trials with this DNA vaccine and GM- CSF, transient dyspnea and chest pain have 
been observed, occurring within 45 minutes of treatment and resolving within 10 minutes without 
 
 
Version 04/06/2021  23 
 treatment; these reactions have been attributed to the GM- CSF.  One allergic reaction with tongue 
swelling and lip edema has been observed in one patient following 11 immunizations, resolving 
following treatment with antihistamines, and without sequelae.  Furthermore, the generation of a transient immune response to rhGM -CSF following its use as a vaccine adjuvant has been 
observed, however no clinical sequelae were noted, and the significance of this observation is not clear at present [ 63]. 
 
DNA vaccine preparation and administration  
 Vials will be thawed, and the plasmid DNA itself will be used to reconstitute the GM -CSF, on the 
day of administration.  Specifically:  For each of the DNA immunizations:  0.6 mL of 0.2 mg/mL pTVG -HP will be withdrawn and 
used to reconstitute [ADDRESS_14566] of the arm (left arm, preferentially) in two adjacent sites, with the total syringe contents (0.25 to 0.3 mL) administered at each site.

6. Experimental Design  
 This will be a 1:[ADDRESS_14574] of a DNA vaccine encoding PAP with rhGM -CSF adjuvant 
given with (concurrently or sequentially) pembrolizumab.  Study arms will be defined as follows:  
 Arm 1:  pTVG- HP (100 µg) with rhGM -CSF (208 µg) administ ered intradermally (i.d.) 
 biweekly 6 times Pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, administered intravenously every [ADDRESS_14575] pTVG-HP vaccination  
 Arm 2:  pTVG- HP (100 µg) with rhGM -CSF (208 µg) administered intradermally (i.d.)  
 biweekly 6 times 
 Pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, administered intravenously every [ADDRESS_14576] pTVG -HP vaccination 
 Extended treatment Arm 3: 
pTVG-HP (100 µg) with rhGM-CSF (208 µg) administered intradermally (i.d.)  
 every 3 weeks, for a maximum of 16 doses Pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, with a maximum dose of [ADDRESS_14577] pTVG -HP vaccination   
 Extended treatment Arm 4: 
pTVG-HP (100 µg) with rhGM- CSF (208 µg) administered intradermally (i.d.)  
 every 2 weeks, for a maximum of 24 doses Pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, with a maximum dose of [ADDRESS_14578] pTVG -HP vaccination  
  
A. Study Arm Assignment and Toxicity Assessment 
 Patients with castrate- resistant, metastatic prostate cancer, with evidence of progressive disease by 
[CONTACT_15213] (but not by [CONTACT_15214]) or rising PSA, who may or may not have been previously treated with other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (including chemotherapy, abiraterone, or enzalutamide), will be invited to 
participate.  Subjects will be randomly assigned to a treatment group for the first two study arms.  
Once at least [ADDRESS_14579] been accrued to Arms 1 and 2, and once Arm 3 is open to accrual, Arms 1 and 2 will be closed and all further accrual will be to Arm 3 .  Given the absence 
of significant adverse events observed in previous clinical trials with pTVG -HP, no adverse events 
> grade [ADDRESS_14580] been observed with pembrolizumab, including immune -mediated pneumonitis, 
colitis, hepatitis, hypophysitis, nephritis, hyperthyroidism, and hypothyroidism.  Hence these may 
 
 
Version 04/06/2021  27 
 be anticipated events.  In 89 patients treated with pembrolizumab at 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks in a 
study of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, < 20% of patients experienced any 
adverse reaction  > grade 2; the most common adverse reaction was fatigue (7% of patients) .  Three 
grade 4 laboratory abnormality events (hyperglycemia, increased ALT, and anemia) were reported.   
In a larger trial of 411 patients with advanced melanoma, 9% of patients discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions.  However, patients in the approval trial received a medi an of 9 doses, 
more doses than will be used in the current trial.  In the current trial patients will be evaluated for evidence of toxicity, and further accrual to a specific treatment arm will be discontinued if the toxicity rate is deemed to be e xcessive for that arm .  Given the more limited exposure to this agent 
(4 doses total), a toxicity rate of 35 % for Grade 3 events or 20% Grade [ADDRESS_14581] possibly related to study treatment will be considered excessive.  Grade 3 limited site reactions (lasting < 48 hours) and fevers/chills (lasting < 48 hours) will be excluded from this assessment , as expected possible adverse events of limited duration from vaccination.     
 Evidence that the toxicity rate is excessive will be considered sufficient if, within any arm, the lower limits of the 90% one -sided confidence intervals for the estimates of the true toxicity rates 
exceed the toxicity limits defined above (i.e., 35% for Grade 3 events and 20% for Grade 4 events), 
after the first [ADDRESS_14582] been accrued.  Operationally, this will occur if any of the following 
events occurs within a study arm:  Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_14583] 7 (or less), [ADDRESS_14584] 10 (or less), or [ADDRESS_14585] 12 (or less) or [ADDRESS_14586] 14 (or less) or [ADDRESS_14587] 16 (or less) of the subjects accrued (within a study arm).  Furthermore, accrual will be temporarily suspended if a ny of the following events occur:  Grade [ADDRESS_14588] 5, 4 out of 9 (or less), [ADDRESS_14589] 13 (or less) or 6 out of 16 (or less) of the subjects accrued (within a study arm).    If one of these thresholds is re ached,  accrual will be temporarily suspended and the study will be 
reviewed for safety, dose modification and safety modification, and the study will be reviewed for safety by [CONTACT_15215] (data and safety  monitoring committee) with respect to treatment arm .  
Once the study is suspended, it would only be reopened if modifications could be made, and approved by [CONTACT_15216] -IRB, to assure that patient safety is reestablished.  If not, the 
study would be closed.    
B. Endpoints 
 Patients will come off study at the time of radiographic (CT and/or bone scintigraphy) disease 
progression, with progression being defined only AFTER the first 3 -month staging evaluation, at 
the time of undue toxicity (as defined below), or at the discretion of the patient and treating physician that continuing treatment is not in the best interest of the patient and/or that other standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_15138].  Patients should be discouraged from discontinuing protocol treatment for PSA rise only.  NaF and FLT 
PET/CT scans will be investigation al and will not be used for making individual subject treatment 
decisions with respect to progression necessitating continuing or discontinuing protocol treatment.  
However, findings on NaF or FLT PET/CT that might pose medical risk to individual subjects will 
be communicated to the treating physician such that dedicated clinical imaging/intervention could be pursued, if necessary.  Such findings on NaF or FLT PET/CT, by [CONTACT_1029], will not be used 
to define disease progression necessarily requiring patients to come off trial.  Patients who, in the discretion of the treating physician, appear to be benefiting (e.g. declining serum PSA and/or 
 
 
Version 04/06/2021  28 
 improvement in symptoms despi[INVESTIGATOR_15139]), may continue in protocol 
treatment/observation after discussion with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_15140] .  Patients will continue to 
have blood drawn for immune studies, as per study calendar, up to one year after screening, even if off study prior to that time. Patients who undergo an initial research biopsy and/or NaF/ FLT 
PET scan should also undergo the subsequent scans, as long as they are willing, even if they are off study prior to Month 3. In particular, evaluations performed a t 6-month time point should be 
performed even if off -study prior to that time, if feasible.  All subjects who have not come off 
study earlier for these reasons will come off study at the end of one year.  The primary endpoints of the trial will be clinical  endpoints (safety, 6 month PFS, and objective 
response rates).  All subjects will undergo radiographic imaging (CT of abdomen and pelvis and bone scan) prior to treatment, and at 3- month intervals (or as clinically indicated).  Radiographic 
disease progression and response will be defined using PCWG2 published criteria [65], and as 
detailed in Section 7.  Based on the prior trials leading to the approval of sipuleucel -T, and because 
immune therapi[INVESTIGATOR_15141], the radiographic studies obtained at 3 months will not be used to define progression, rather will be used as the baseline for future comparison.  That is, while 
baseline studies will be obtained prior to study registration, and radiographic progression may be 
expected in 50% of patients at [ADDRESS_14590] been observed with immune -based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including pembrolizumab and other T -cell 
checkpoint inhibit ors [80]. Time to progression will be determined from registration for all 
subjects.  6- month progression- free survival will be calculated for each treatment arm, as well as 
the median progression- free survival.  
 The primary endpoint for the extended trea tment Arm s [ADDRESS_14591] ( PCWG2 Recommendations) 
 
A. Malignant Disease Evaluation  
 To assess objective response, it is necessary to estimate the overall tumor burden at baseline (for 
purposes of comparison, “baseline” imaging will be that obtained at 3- month time point)  to which 
subsequent measurements will be compared. Measurable disease is defined by [CONTACT_12155].  
 All measurements should be recorded in metric notation by [CONTACT_2363] a ruler or calipers. The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified lesion at baseline and during follow-up. All pre- treatment evaluations should be performed as closely as 
possible to the beginning of treatment and not more than four weeks before registration.  
 The term evaluable in reference to measurability will not be used because it does not provide additional meaning or accuracy. 
 
 
Version 04/06/2021  29 
  
At baseline, tumor lesions will be characterized as either measurable or non -measurable.  
 NOTE:  While progression will be documented from pre- treatment staging studies  in all 
individuals, the intent of these measurements in this trial will be to determine whe ther “baseline” 
evaluation for immune -based treatments is preferable at a later time point after the therapy has 
been given the opportunity to exert an anti -tumor effect.  Hence, the “baseline” evaluation for 
determining progression will be the staging studies performed ~ day 85 (3 months) .  Objective 
progression at that time point (Month 3, day 85) from the pre -treatment scans will not be used to 
alter treatment unless the patient has symptomatic disease requiring other therapy and thereby 
[CONTACT_15217] s to discont inue treatment.  For all of these measurements, PCWG2 criteria will be used to 
identify “measurable” lesions at each of the baseline (pre- treatment and 3 month time points), and 
RECIST 1.1 criteria will be used to monitor for change over time (consistent w ith PCWG2 
criteria).  
 
1. Measurable  
Lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter 
to be recorded) as ≥  20 mm (2.0 cm) with conventional techniques or as > 10 mm (1.0 
cm) with spi[INVESTIGATOR_15142].  For a lymph node to be cons idered pathologically enlarged 
and measurable, it must be > 15mm in short axis when assessed by [CONTACT_15209][INVESTIGATOR_15143].  
 
If the measurable disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by [CONTACT_3973]/histology.  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area are not considered measurable.  
 
2. Non-Measurable  
All other lesions, including small lesions [longest diameter < 20 mm (2.0 cm) with conventional techniques or < 10 mm (1.0 cm) with spi[INVESTIGATOR_15142]], lymph nodes < 
15mm in short axis, and truly non- measurable lesions.  
 Lesions considered to be truly non -measurable include the following: bone lesions, 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, abdominal masses that are not confirmed and followed by [CONTACT_15218], and cystic lesions.  
 
B. Definitions of Response  
 
1. Target Lesions  
All measurable lesions, up to a maximum of two lesions per organ and five lesions in total, representative of all involved organs. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (those with the largest  diameters) and their suitability for accurate 
repeated measurements.  
 
 
 
Version 04/06/2021  30 
 The sum of the diameters (long axis for non- nodal, short axis for nodal)  of all target 
lesions will be calculated at baseline and reported as the baseline sum diameter . The 
sum diameter  will be used to characterize the objective tumor response.  
 
a. Complete Response (CR)   
The disappearance of all target lesions.  To be assigned a status of complete response, 
changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by [CONTACT_15219].  PSA must also 
be < 0.2 ng/mL.  All disease must be assessed using the same technique as at baseline.  
Lymph nodes that shrink to less than 1.0 cm are considered normal. 
 
b. Partial Response (PR)   
At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of tar get lesions  (long axis for 
non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) , taking as reference the baseline sum  
diameter . To be assigned a status of partial response, changes in tumor measurements 
must be confirmed by [CONTACT_15220].  There must be no new lesions.  All target measurable 
lesions must be assessed using the same techniques as at baseline.  
 
c. Progressive Disease (PD)   
At least a 20% increase in the sum of the d iameters of target lesions  (long axis for 
non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions), and a 0.[ADDRESS_14592] sum diameter  recorded since the Month 3 
baseline measurements, or the appearance of one or more new lesion(s).  
 
d. Stable Disease (SD)   
Change in tumor size is less than that required to identify a partial response or 
progressive disease.  To be assigned a status of stable disease, measurements must have 
met the stable disease criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval of 12 weeks.   
2. Nontarget Lesions  
All other lesions or sites of disease  that do not meet the criteria for target lesions, 
including those on bone scintigraphy. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout the study.  
a. Complete Response (CR)  
The disappearance of all nontarget lesions and undetectable PSA tumor marker levels. To be assigned a status of complete response, changes in tumor measurements must 
be confirmed by [CONTACT_15221].  
 
b. Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (SD)   
The persistence of one or more nontarget lesion(s) and/ or the persistence of detectable 
serum PSA tumor marker levels.  To be assigned a status of stable disease, 
measurements must have met the stable disease criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval of 12 weeks.  
 
 
Version 04/06/2021  31 
  
c. Progressive Disease (PD)   
The appearance of one or more new lesion(s) and/or unequivocal progression of 
existing nontarget lesions.    
NOTE:  For lesions only detectable by [CONTACT_15222] (or NaF PET/CT) , the appearance 
of > 2 new lesions, with symptoms, will constitute disease progression.  Without 
symptoms, and if no other evidence of disease progression (no progressive disease by [CONTACT_15223]), progression must be documented with repeat bone scintigraphy (or NaF PET/CT) at le ast 6 weeks later demonstrating > 2 new 
lesions.  This is to eliminate the possibility of flair responses seen on bone imaging scans.  
 
3. Symptomatic Deterioration   
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment w ithout objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be 
classified as having symptomatic deterioration.  
 
4. PSA Progression  
While PSA values will be collected, and PSA kinetics (PSA responses and maximal changes in PSA by [CONTACT_15224]) monitored as secondary endpoints, PSA rise will not be used to determine objective disease progression.   Similar to 
the radiographic studies  above, PSA progression or response will be defined 
using both pre -treatment (study entry) and 3 -month values as baseline values.   
 
a. PSA Complete Response:  Decrease in PSA to <0.2 ng/mL and confirmed with PSA measurement a minimum of four weeks later (confirmed PSA CR).  There 
must be no evidence of radiographic progression. 
 b. PSA Partial Response : Greater than or equal to 50% reduction in baseline PSA. 
There must be no evidence of radiographic progression. 
 c. Best Response: This is calculated from the sequence of objective statuses.  The date of response will be defined as the first date at which PSA declined from baseline or normalized.   
 
i. Confirmed PSA PR : Two or more objective statuses of PSA PR or better 
a minimum of four weeks apart documented before  progression. Best 
response for objective disease must be stable/no response or better.  
 
ii. Unconfirmed PSA PR : One objective status of PSA PR documented before 
progression, but not qualifying for confirmed PSA PR. Best response for objective disease must be Stable/no response or better. 
 
iii. No PSA Response : Objective PSA status does not qualify as a PSA PR or 
unconfirmed PSA PR. 
 
 
 
Version 04/06/2021  32 
 iv. Inadequate Assessment, response unknown : When best response for 
objective disease is inadequate or unknown or when PSA has been 
inade quately assessed, then PSA response will be coded likewise.  
 
d. PSA Progression : Although not considered progression per the primary objective 
of this study, time to PSA progression will be used for secondary analyses.  PSA 
progression will be def ined as a 50%  increase in PSA over the nadir PSA, and > 2 
ng/mL above the nadir, confirmed by a second value 3 or more weeks later (i.e. confirmed rising trend). If no on- study reduction has occurred, nadir would be the 
baseline value (pre- treatment or month 3 time point for analyses).   
 
C. Evaluation of Patient’s Best Overall Response 
 The best overall response is the best response recorded from baseline until disease 
progression/recurrence, taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded after baseline. The table below provides overall responses for all possible combinations 
of tumor responses in target and nontarget lesions, with or without new lesions. 
 
To be assigned a status of complete or partial response, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by [CONTACT_15225].  
 To be assigned a status of stable disease, measurements must have met the stable disease criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval of 12 weeks.

1. First Documentation of Response  
The time between initiation of therapy and first documentation of PR or CR. 
 
2. Confirmation of Response  
To be assigned a status of complete or partial response, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by [CONTACT_15226].  
 
3. Duration of Response  
 
 
Version 04/06/2021  33 
 Duration of overall response – the period measured from the time that measurement 
criteria are met for complete or partial response (whichever status is recorded first) 
until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since treatment started.  
 
a. Duration of Overall Complete Response  
The period measured from  the time measurement criteria are met for complete 
response until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented.  
 
b. Duration of Stable Disease   
A measurement from baseline (3 month) until the criteria for disease progression is 
met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since baseline . To be 
assigned a status of stable disease, measurements must have met the stable disease criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval of [ADDRESS_14593] follow -up in censored patients. 
 
5. Time to Objective Disease Progression   
Time to progression will be defined as a function of baseline time points in two ways:  
(1) Time to progression from randomization: Time elapsed from randomization 
until disease progression or death.  If a patient doesn’t experience a disease 
progression or death event before the end of the follow -up period, then the 
observation for this patient will be censored.  
 (2) Time to progression from [ADDRESS_14594] -randomization :  Time elapsed from 
the 3 months disease progression assessment until disease progression or death. If a patient doesn’t experience a disease progression or death event before the end of the follow-up period, then the observation for this patient will be censored. 
 
The intent of defining time to progression as a function of baseline time points (date of randomization and 3- month disease assessment) is to determine if treatment  prolongs the 
time to progression using a delayed baseline evaluation after the treatment has been given time to elicit an  immunologically- mediated  anti- tumor response.    
 
6. Methods of Measurement   
Imaging based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_12148]. The same imaging modality must be used throughout the study to measure disease.  
a. CT and MRI   
CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) a re the best currently available and 
most reproducible methods for measuring target lesions. Conventional CT and MRI should be performed with contiguous cuts of [ADDRESS_14595], abdomen, and pelvis, while head 
 
 
Version 04/06/[ADDRESS_14596] decline to < 0. 2 ng/mL for a patient to be considered in complete clinical 
response when all tumor lesions have disappeared.  
 
c. Clinical Examination  
 Clinically detected lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes). For skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate size of the lesion, is recommended.  Photographs should be retained at the institution. 
 
 
8. Definition and Management of Limiting Toxicities and Adverse Events  
 A treatment -limiting toxicity will be defined as any Grade 3 or greater toxicity (using the NCI 
Common Terminology Criteria version 4, Appendix C) , or a specific Grade [ADDRESS_14597] treatment with pembrolizumab (whichever is 
later).  In general, i f a patient develops Grade [ADDRESS_14598] possibly 
related to treatment (vaccine and/or pembrolizumab ), the treatment schedule will be held until the 
toxicity resolves to Grade [ADDRESS_14599] be related 
to the development of other autoimmune toxicities.  If the adverse event occurs during the initial 12 weeks (Arm 1) or 24 weeks (Arm 2) of treatment, a treatment delay of up to one week will be permitted, with the expectation that the event resolve to < grade 2 for retreatment, and that 
subsequent treatment will resume at the original study intervals.  A delay > 1 week will result in a 
skipped dose /treatment.  While rare overall, autoimmune events observed following 
pembroli zumab treatment o f patients with melanoma typi[INVESTIGATOR_15144].     For patients specifically treated in Arm s 3 or 4, the following management rules will apply:  If a 
patient develops Grade [ADDRESS_14600] possibly related to pembrolizumab and unlikely related (or unrelated) to pTVG -HP vaccine, the pembrolizumab treatment will be held 
until th e toxicity resolves to Grade 1 or less, with the vaccine schedule continuing as per protocol.  
If a patient develops a second Grade 3 event (or any Grade 4 event) believed to be at least possibly due to pembrolizumab, but unlikely related (or unrelated) to pTVG -HP vaccine, no further 
pembrolizumab treatments will be given.  The patient will continue with pTVG -HP administration 
only as per protocol.  However, if a patient develops a Grade [ADDRESS_14601] possibly related to pTVG -HP vaccine, both pTVG -HP and pembrolizumab treatment will be 
 
 
Version 04/06/2021  35 
 held until the toxicity resolves to Grade 1 or less.  If a patient develops a second Grade 3 event (or 
any Grade 4 event) believed at least possibly related to pTVG -HP vaccine, no further treatment s 
will be given.  The patient will remain on study, however, with collection of radiographic and laboratory data as per protocol.  The rationale for these modifications is that patients could continue to benefit in terms of anti- tumor response and this could in fact be related to the development of 
other autoimmune toxicities, and patients who have toxicity from pembrolizumab could still potentially benefit from continued pTVG-HP vaccination.    
Specific symptoms and potential adverse events that have been identified in previous trials 
with pembrolizumab are described below.  Management for these specific conditions will be 
conducted as described, consistent with what has been previously recommended in the FDA 
prescribing information “package insert” : 
 
Infusion- related reactions: 
 Treatment with pembrolizumab will be permanently discontinued for grade 3 or 4 infusion- related 
reaction.   
 
Constitutional symptoms : 
 
Mild, low -grade fevers and chills, and local skin site reactions, are expected events following 
immunization and/or treatment with GM -CSF.  Grade [ADDRESS_14602] 48 hours after an immunization.  Constitutional inflammatory events > grade 1, or persisting beyond 48 hours after immunization, will be managed with ibuprofen, if needed, up to 600 mg three times daily.  Fatigue was reported in 47% (and 7% grade 3 fatigue) of 89 patients with melanoma who received pembrolizumab in the trial leading to its approval.  As this is a potentially expected event, and not life-threatening, treatment will not be held for fatigue grade 3 or lower.  
 
Hematologic: 
 Anemia was reported in 14% (and 5% grade 3 anemia) of [ADDRESS_14603] this is an immune -mediated event, 
treatment will not be held for anemia grade 3 or lower.   
Pulmonary adverse events: 
 
Pneumonitis occurred in 12 (2.9%) of 411 melanoma patients receiving pembrolizumab, including 8 (1.9%) with grade 3 and 1 (0.2%) with grade 4 events.  The median time to development of symptoms was 4.9 months.  Patients will be monitored for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis , 
with radiographic imaging (chest X -ray or CT) and specialist referral as clinically indicated.  
Specifically, a CT of the chest will be performed at baseline as a basis for comparison, and then subsequently as clinically indicated.  Pembrolizumab will be  held for grade 2 pneumonitis, and 
permanently discontinued for grade 3 or higher events.  Symptomatic patients will be treated with high- dose systemic corticosteroids ( > 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) for at least one 
 
 
Version 04/06/2021  36 
 week followed by [CONTACT_13217], or a s clinically indicated.  If retreatment is possible, treatment with 
pembrolizumab will continue to be held until the toxicity resolves to < grade 2. 
 
Immune -mediated colitis adverse events: 
 
Colitis (including microscopic colitis) occurred in 4 (1%) of 411 melanoma patients receiving pembrolizumab, including 1 patient with grade 2 and 2 patients with grade 3 events.  The median time to development of symptoms was 6.5 months.  Patients will be monitored for signs and symptoms of colitis (abdominal pain +/ - diarrhea), with radiographic imaging and/or colonoscopy 
as clinically indicated.  Pembrolizumab will be held for grade 2 or grade 3 colitis, and permanently discontinued for grade 4 events.  S ymptomatic patients will be treated with high -dose systemic 
corticosteroids ( > 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) for one week followed by [CONTACT_13217], or as 
clinically indicated.  If retreatment is possible, treatment with pembrolizumab will continue to be  
held until the toxicity resolves to < grade 2. 
 
Immune -mediated hepatitis adverse events : 
 
Hepatitis (including liver -associated pain and/or elevation of serum liver function tests) occurred 
in 2 (0.5%) of [ADDRESS_14604] abnormalities, an d permanently discontinued for grade 3 or 4 events.  Patients 
with grade 2 or higher events will be treated with high- dose systemic corticosteroids ( > 40 mg 
prednisone or equivalent per day) for at least one week followed by [CONTACT_13217], or as clinically indicat ed.  
If retreatment is possible, treatment with pembrolizumab will continue to be held until the toxicity resolves to < grade 2. 
 
Immune -mediated hypophysitis adverse events : 
 
Hypophysitis occurred in 2 (0.5%) of 411 melanoma patients receiving pembrolizumab, including 1 patient with grade 2 and 1 patient with grade 4 events.  The median time to development of symptoms was 1.5 months.  Patients will be monitored for signs and symptoms of hypophysitis , 
which could include headache, visual disturbances, polyuria, and polydipsia; lab tests will be performed as clinically indicated.  Pembrolizumab will be held for grade 2 or higher hypophysitis, 
and permanently discontinued for grade 4 events.  Patients with grade 2 or higher events will be treated with high- dose systemic corticosteroids ( > 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) for at 
least one week followed by [CONTACT_13217], or as clinically indicated.  If retreatment is possible, treatment 
with pembrolizumab will continue to be held until the toxicity resolves to < grade 2. 
 
Immune -mediated nephritis adverse events : 
 Nephritis occurred in 3 (0.7%) of [ADDRESS_14605] one patient.  Patients will be monitored for changes in renal function, with other lab tests as clinically indicated.  Pembrolizumab will be held for grade 2 or higher nephritis, and permanently discontinued for grade 3 or higher events.  Patients with grade 2 or higher events will 
 
 
Version 04/06/2021  37 
 be treated with high -dose systemic corticosteroids ( > 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) for 
at least one week followed by [CONTACT_13217], or as clinically indicated.  If retreatment is possible, treatment 
with pembrolizumab will continue to be held until the toxicity resolves to < grade 2. 
 
Immune -mediated thyroid function adverse events: 
 
Hyperthyroidism occurred in 5 (1.2%) of 411  melanoma patients receiving pembrolizumab, 
including 2 patients with grade 2 events and 1 patient with a grade 3 event.  The median time to development of symptoms was 1.5 months.  Patients will be monitored for serum changes in thyroid function, and subs equently with other lab tests as clinically indicated.  Pembrolizumab will 
be held for grade 3 or higher hyperthyroidism, and permanently discontinued for grade 4 events.  Patients with grade 3 or higher events will be treated with high -dose systemic corti costeroids ( > 
40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day) for at least one week followed by [CONTACT_13217], or as clinically indicated.  If retreatment is possible, treatment with pembrolizumab will continue to be held until 
the toxicity resolves to < grade 2. 
 Hypothyroidism occurred in 34 (8.3%) of 411 melanoma patients receiving pembrolizumab, 
including 1 patient with a grade 3 event.  The median time to development of hypothyroidism was 
3.5 months.  Patients will be monitored for serum changes in thyroid function, a nd subsequently 
with other lab tests if clinically indicated.  Isolated hypothyroidism will be managed with thyroid hormone replacement therapy without treatment interruption and without corticosteroids.    
Other immune -mediated adverse events: 
 Other clinically significant, immune -mediated adverse reactions have been observed in <1% of 
patients treated with pembrolizumab, including exfoliative dermatitis, uveitis, arthritis, myositis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, partial seizures, adrenal insu fficiency, myasthenic syndrome, optic 
neuritis, and rhabdomyolysis.  For suspected immune -mediated adverse events apart from those 
previously listed, efforts should be made to confirm the etiology and exclude other causes.  Based on the severity of symptoms, and as directed by [CONTACT_1963], pembrolizumab should be either discontinued or held until improvement in symptoms to < grade 2.  Corticosteroids may be administered if clinically indicated, again as directed by [CONTACT_1963]. 
 
 
9. Plan of Treatment  
 The following section describes the schedule for prescreening, treatment, and clinical and laboratory evaluations.  When a chemistry panel is indicated the following tests are performed:  Chem 7 (including sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, BUN, creatinine, and glucose), ALT, AST, 
bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, amylase, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and LDH.  Whenever a CBC is indicated, this will include differential and platelet count.  This plan is summarized in the Schema.  
 Because one biomarker endpoint is to evaluate metastatic tissue prior to and after treatment, patients with disease amenable to biopsy will initially be required to undergo one pretreatment biopsy and one post -treatment biopsy roughly three months after the start of t reatment. It is our 
intent to have at least [ADDRESS_14606] -treatment 
 
 
Version 04/06/[ADDRESS_14607] study participation.  Similarly, up to 6 subjects per 
arm will be required to  complete the FLT PET scan  at baseline and again at month 3  (Week 12) .  
If there are subjects who complete the first but not the second scan, more than [ADDRESS_14608] 6 subjects who complete both scans.  A maximum of 10 evaluable subjects between Arms 3 and 4  
will be required to undergo the NaF PET scans. Selected subjects in Arm #3 will undergo either 
the FLT PET or the NaF PET based on t he area of their disease (soft tissue vs bone).   Subjects in

monitoring.  From the heparinized blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be prepared by [CONTACT_15235] -Paque using standard techniques.  PBMC will be 
used directly for analysis, and residual material cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen using 90% autologous serum collected at t he time of blood draw, or 90% fetal calf serum, and 10% DMSO.  
Sera will be prepared from the red -top tubes and stored in aliquots at –80°C for antibody analyses.  
IFNγ and granzyme B ELISPOT analysis, PAP -specific T -cell proliferation, flow cytometric 
assays of antigen -specific cytokine secretion, and ELISA tests for antigen -specific antibodies, will 
be the primary methods of analysis.  The primary antigens tested will be PAP (experimental), PSA (negative control), and tetanus toxoid (positive control).  The primary immune analysis will be 
 
 
Version 04/06/2021  52 
 conducted at the 6- month time point, and compared with the pre -treatment time point, and for 
patients to be evaluable for immune response (primary endpoint), blood (PBMC and serum) from 
this time point must be available f or analysis.  However, immune monitoring will be conducted at 
the other time points indicated in secondary analyses to evaluate kinetic measures of immunity, and evaluate whether durable immune responses of particular phenotypes are elicited and/or maintai ned.  Assays may be conducted at the time of sample collection (fresh) and/or batched and 
performed at one time from multiple cryopreserved samples collected at different time points.  Other methods of effector and regulatory T-cell response to PAP and other human tissue antigens may be used.    
B.1. Quantitative assessment of PAP -specific CD8+ T -cell effector immunity  
 
PAP-specific IFN γ- and granzyme B -secreting T -cell precursor frequency quantification by 
[CONTACT_15236]: ELISPOT will be used as the preferred methodol ogy, as it permits analysis of low -
frequency events (LOD ~ 1:100,000 cells) and also permits simultaneous analysis of cryopreserved 
batched specimens [ 30].  IFNγ and granzyme B will be preferred analytes evaluated, as these are 
specifically associated with inflammatory/tissue -destructive (Th1- type, cytolytic ) immune 
responses.  Specifically, cryopreserved PBMC from subjects at the various time points will be 
thawed, rested, and then transferred to 96- well nitrocellulose microtiter (ELISPOT) plates 
previously coated with monoclonal capture antibodies specific for IFN γ or granzyme B.  105 cells 
per well will be cultured in the presence of media (RPMI 1640 supplemented with L -glutamine, 
penicillin/streptomycin, ß- mercaptoethanol and 10% human AB serum) only (no antigen), 2 µg/ml 
PAP protein, 2 µg/ml PSA protein (negative control), 2 µg/ml  of peptide libraries specific for PAP 
or control, 250 ng/ml tetanus toxoid, or 2.5 µg/ml PHA (positive mitogenic control) for 24- 48 
hours.  Plates will then be washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween- 20 and incubated for 2.5 
hours at room temperature with 50 µl/well PBS containing 5 µg/ml biotinylated detection 
antibodies for either IFN γ or granzyme B.  After incubation, wells will be washed with PBS, and 
further incubated with 100 µl/well streptavidin -labeled alkaline phosphatase (BioRad, Hercules, 
CA) and then developed with 100 µl/well BCIP/NBT colorimetric substrate (BioRad).  The colorimetric reaction will be stopped by [CONTACT_15237], and wells will be allowed to dry completely before spots are enumera ted with an ELISPOT automatic plate reader.   
 REPORTING AND RESPONSE DEFINITION:  Results will be presented as previously reported as the mean (+/ - standard deviation) number of spot-forming- units (sfu)  per 10
6 cells (frequency) , 
calculated by [CONTACT_15238], normalized to 106 starting PBMC, from 
8-well replicate assays [ 31].  Comparison of experimental wells with control, no antigen, wells  
will be performed using a two -sample t -test, with p < 0.05 (two -sided) defined as a significant 
antigen- specific T-cell response.  A significant antigen -specific response resulting from 
immunization will then be defined as a PAP -specific response detectable at the [ADDRESS_14623] -
treatment time point (or other post- treatment time point evaluated)  that i s significantly higher than 
to media only (as above), at least 3 -fold higher than the mean baseline value, and with a frequency 
> 10 per 106 PBMC.   
 
B.2. Assessment of PAP -specific memory T -cell immunity  
 
 
 
Version 04/06/2021  53 
 Ability of T -cell lines to proliferate in response to antigenic stimulation :  T-cell proliferation in 
response to antigen stimulation as a measure of memory T -cell responses will be assessed by a 
PKH26 dye dilution assay as previously reported [31].  Specifically , PBMC will be labeled in vitro 
with PKH26 dye (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) according to the manufacturer’s recommendation.  T -
cell cultures with and with out antigens will be established in replicates using 2x105 peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)/well, plated in 96- well round bottom microtiter plates (Corning, 
Cambridge, MA), in media consisting of RPMI 1640 (Gibco) and supplemented with L -glutamine, 
penicillin/streptomycin, ß- mercaptoethanol and 10% human AB serum (ICN Flow, Costa Me sa, 
CA).  Antigens may include 2 µg/ml of a pool of peptide spanning the amino acid sequence of 
PAP, 2 µg/ml PAP protein (Research Diagnostics Inc., Flanders, N J), 2 µg/ml PSA (Research 
Diagnostics Inc.), 250 ng/ml tetanus toxoid, and 2.5 µg/ml phytohemaglutinin (PHA).  After 6- 7 
days of culture at 37oC/5% CO 2, cell surface markers will be stained to characterize the T -cell 
phenotype and memory phenotype of proli ferating cells (CD45RO, CCR7).  Flow cytometery will 
be used to identify and enumerate CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T cells co- staining for PKH26.  
The frequency of antigen- specific CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T cells will be determined by 
[CONTACT_15239]26+ events among CD4+ or CD8+ events (estimated 
from the number of cells and number of cell divisions by [CONTACT_15240] , 
Verity Software House, Topsham, ME), and subtracting the mean precursor frequency of 
proliferating cells under media -only conditions.  Other cell surface markers may be assessed, other 
antigens evaluated, and/or other methods of antigen- specific T -cell proliferation.   
 
REPORTING AND RESPONSE DEFINITION:  Data will be reported as a mean and standard deviat ion of antigen -specific (PAP -specific) proliferative precursors per 10
6 PBMC using triplicate 
assessments for each antigen -stimulation condition, as previously reported [ 31].  Comparison of 
experimental wells with control, no antigen, wells  will be performed using a two -tailed Student’s 
t test, with p < 0.[ADDRESS_14624] -treatment time point (or other post -treatment time 
point evaluated)  that is significantly higher than to media only (as above), at least 3- fold higher 
than the mean baseline value, and with a frequency > 1 00 per 106 CD4+ or CD8+ T cells .   
 
B.3. Assessment of PAP -specific T cells by [CONTACT_15241]-specific T -cell cytokine expression by [CONTACT_15242] :  As another method of 
evaluating AR LBD -specific T cell responses, intracellular cytokine staining will be used.  
Specifically, fresh or cryopreserved PBMC from subjects at the various time points wil l be rapi[INVESTIGATOR_15145], cultured in 96- well microtiter plates in the presence of test antigens (PAP (protein or pool 
of overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 15- mer peptides), PSA, tetanus, PHA, or media only) for 4 -24 hours, and then will 
be analyzed for intracellular cytokine expression.  Spe cifically, stimulated cells will be treated 
with monensin for 4- 8 hours at 37oC/5%CO 2.  Cells will then be washed with PBS/3%FCS, 
followed by [CONTACT_15243] (including CD3, CD4, and CD8 to identify T cell subsets, as well as CCR7 and CD45RO to identify memory populations, and potentially other cell surface markers).  Cells will then be fixed, permeabilized, and then stained for intracellular expression of a panel of cytokines (including, but not limited to, IFNγ, TNFα, IL -2, IL -17, and IL -
10), or control IgG labeled with the appropriate fluorochromes.  Cells will be analyzed on a flow cytometer, and results will be determined by [CONTACT_15244] T cells (either total T cells and/or T cell subsets, including CD4+ and CD8+  T cells, as well as various memory 
 
 
Version 04/06/2021  54 
 populations or regulatory populations) expressing each individual cytokine, or cells expressing 
multiple cytokines.   
 REPORTING AND RESPONSE DEFINITION:  Data will be reported as a mean and standard deviation of antigen- specific (PAP -specific) CD4+ or CD8+ T cells expressing one or more 
cytokines per 10
6 PBMC using triplicate assessments for each antigen -stimulation condition , as 
previously reported [ 31].  Comparison of experimental wells with control, no antigen, wells  will 
be performed using a two-tailed Student’s t test, with p < 0.[ADDRESS_14625] -treatm ent time point (or 
other post -treatment time point evaluated)  that is significantly higher than to media only (as 
above), at least 3- fold higher than the mean baseline value, and with a frequency > 100 per 106 
CD4+ or CD8+ T cells.   
B.4. Assessment of antigen -specific antibody immunity  
 
Enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of antibodies responses to PAP :  
The presence of a coexisting humoral immune response to PAP (or other antigens) will be evaluated by [CONTACT_15245] [
34].  
Specifically, Immulon -4 ELISA plates (Dynex Technologies Inc.) will be coated with 2 µg/ml 
purified PAP protein (Research Diagnostics, Inc. , or other antigens  or commercial sources) in 0.1 
M NaHCO 3/Na 2CO 3 buffer (pH 9.6) overnight at 4oC.  After blocking with PBS/1% BSA for 1 
hour at room temperature, wells will be washed with PBS + 0.05% Tween- 20 (PBS -Tween) and 
then incubated for 1 hour with human sera diluted 1:25, 1:50, 1:100 and 1:200.  After washing, plates will then be sequentially incubated with a peroxidase -conjugated anti-human IgG detection 
antibody (Amersham), followed by [CONTACT_15246] (Kierkegaard and Perry Laboratories).  The colo r reaction will be stopped with 1N H
2SO 4 and the optical density measured 
at 450 nm.  Antibody titers for PAP -specific IgG antibodies will be determined as previously 
described [ 34]. 
 REPORTING AND RESPONSE DEFINITION:  These are not strictly quantitative assays.  IgG response will be reported graphically demonstrating sera dilution curves, and by [CONTACT_15247] – defined as 
the highest sera dilution at which IgG responses are detectable above the mean + [ADDRESS_14626] deviations of the negative control.  A positive IgG response resulting from immunization will be defined as an antigen -specific (anti -PAP) IgG titer at least [ADDRESS_14627]- treatment time point (o r other post -treatment time point evaluated).  
 
B.5. Assessment of antigen -specific regulatory immune responses  
 
Trans- vivo delayed -type hypersensitivity (tvDTH) evaluation:  7.5- 10 x 106 PBMC obtained from 
patients prior to and after immunization will be co -injected into the footpads of 6- to-8-week old 
SCID mice with 1 µg of PAP protein (Fitzgerald Industries, Acton, MA), or tetanus toxoid (TT/D; Aventis Pasteur, Bridgewater, NJ) as a recall antigen , versus phosphate- buffered saline (PBS) 
alone as a negati ve control.  Other antigens may be evaluated as well.  Antigen–driven swelling 
will be  determined as previously described [
66].  DTH reactivity after 24 hours will be shown as 
the change in footpad thickness in multiples of 10-4 inches, measured using a dial thickness gauge 
(Mitutoyo, Japan), and net swelling will be defined as the antigen -specific swelling subtracted for 
 
 
Version 04/06/[ADDRESS_14628] of neutralizing 
antibodies, PBMC w ill be mixed with 1 µg of PAP antigen and 25 µg of either control IgG or 
rabbit anti -human TGF -β, goat anti -human IL -10 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), 1 µg of 
mouse anti -human CTLA -4 monoclonal Ab (clone AS32, Ab Solutions, Mountain View, CA), or 
1 µg of mous e anti -human PD-1 monoclonal Ab (or potentially other antibodies to other regulatory 
molecules) , and injected into the footpads of SCID mice as above.  The extent of by[CONTACT_15248], defining an antigen- specific regulatory response, w ill be measured as inhibition of 
recall antigen  (tetanus) response in the presence of PAP antigen (or prostate -specific antigen (PSA) 
as a negative control) and calculated as previously described [67].  Given the nature of the testing 
and the requirement for SCID mice , data will be shown derived from single measurements, but 
with key experiments repeated 2 -3 times  for confirmation.   
 
REPORTING AND RESPONSE DEFINITION:  These are not strictly quantitative assays.  An antigen- specific (PAP -specific) regulatory response for these purposes will be defined as an 
inhibition of a recall antigen (tetanus toxoid) DTH response by > 50% when performed in the 
presence of PAP; i.e. a DTH response in the presence of PAP+TT that is < 50% of that obtained 
with TT only.  The identification of PD-1 (or CTLA- 4) regulated responses will be defined as the 
identification of an increase (>15 x 10-4 inches) in a PAP -specific response in the presence of anti -
PD-1 (or anti- CTLA -4) versus IgG control, as in Figure 6.   
 
B.6. Assessment of antigen -spread to other prostate -associated antigens  
 
High -throughput immunoblot (HTI) :  An exploratory objective of the study will be to determine 
if patients treated develop “off -target” prostate cancer antigen -specific immune responses as 
evidence of antigen spread.  Future studies may evaluate T -cell responses to non -targeted antigens.  
However, the primary evaluation will be to evaluate IgG responses to a panel of prostate -associated 
antigens as we have previously reported in patients treated with vaccines or other immune-modulating agents [
68, 69, 70].  IgG specific for 126 antigens, including 29 cancer -testis antigens 
[71, 72] and 97 prostate antigens frequently immunologically recognized [73, 74, 75, 76] will be 
identified by [CONTACT_15249] a high- density phage array expressing these individual antigens, as we have 
previously reported [ 68, 70, 71].  An alternative to this approach may include the evaluation of 
responses to pan els of protein antigens fixed to support membranes provided by [CONTACT_15250].  The primary analysis will be conducted using sera obtained at 6 months, and compared with IgG responses identified at baseline, to determine whether IgG specific for individual antigens are elicited over time.  Other time points will be assessed to determine the durability and kinetics of immune response development, and confirmatory ELISA studies will be performed where feasible.   
 REPORTING AND RESPONSE DEFINITION:  A pos itive IgG response will be defined as an 
immunoreactive spot to a defined antigen, scored by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_14629] 2 of 3 replicates per immunoblot membrane as previously described [ 68, 77], 
or by [CONTACT_15251].  An IgG response resulting from immunization will be defined as an immunoreactive antigen identified at the 6 -month (or 
other post -treatment time for subsequent analyses) time point that was not identified at the pre -
treatment time point.    
 
 
Version 04/06/2021  56 
 C. Circulating Tumor Cell (CTC) E valuation 
 
CTC will be enumerated and characterized at the same time points as for immune evaluation (pre -
treatment, after 6 weeks, and at quarterly intervals for up to one year) using flow cytometry .  
Specifically, as in Figure 7, PBMC obtained at these time points will be stained with fluorochrome -
labeled antibodies specific for, and including at least, CD45, EpCAM, PD -1, CTLA -4, and DAPI.  
CTC will be defined as CD45- EpCAM+DAPI - cells, and the perc entage of these events among all 
live cellular events will be determined at the different time points.  The % of CTC expressing PD -
[ADDRESS_14630] deviation are not feasible.  Other methods of CTC capture 
and enumeration may also be used.  Further investigational studies may be conducted with CTC collected by [CONTACT_15252].   
 
D. Histopathology Evaluation 
 
Tissue biopsies will be obtained from metastatic lesions (the same lesion per patient) prior to 
treatment and at week 12 .  The purpose of these studies is to determine whether immuniz ation 
affects PD -L1 expression in the tumor (likely by [CONTACT_15253]- specific T cells secreting 
IFNγ), whether concurrent treatment with anti -PD-1 mAb leads to an increase in infiltration of 
CD8+ T cells, and whether treatment increases expressio n of other T -cell regulatory ligands on T 
cells (PD -1, CTLA -4, TIM -3, BTLA, LAG -3) or tumors (e.g. HVEM, phosphatidyl serine, PD -
L2).  Consequently, biopsy specimens obtained pre -treatment and after [ADDRESS_14631] blinded to the treatment groups to determine CD8+ T cells per 
field, C D4+FoxP3+ (Treg):CD8+ T cell ratio, PD -L1 expression, and whether these or the 
expression of CD8+ T cells expressing one regulatory receptors (or tumor cells expressing one or more regulatory ligands) change from pre-treatment to the [ADDRESS_14632] -guided biopsy of a bone or soft tissue abnormality 
consistent with prostate cancer metastasis.  This site of biopsy will be determined by [CONTACT_15254] [INVESTIGATOR_15146] (bone 
scans, CT scans, MRI), with preference given to lesions meeting the following factors:  (1) size of lesion (preference towards the largest lesion, given the need for biopsy and re -biopsy after 12 
weeks); (2) safety of  biopsy (with obvious preference to lesions with the least risk to the patient); 
and (3) for bone lesions with the greatest intensity activity noted on bone scintigraphy.  Coordination and acquisition of biopsy material will be performed by [CONTACT_15255]  
(Translational Science Biocore) .  Standard laboratory tests to assess bleeding and coagulation will 
also be completed prior to the procedure.  Conscious sedation will be used as necessary  (typi[INVESTIGATOR_15147] ) and with appropriate nursing support.  In order to 
obtain adequate tumor sample, and as long as it is deemed safe, and based on accessibility, target 
lesion size, specimen integrity, specimen appearance, and intraprocedural bleeding, an attempt will be made to obtain [ADDRESS_14633] an 11-13 gauge bone-cutting needle, with or without a co -axial trocar, will be used.  2 -6 biopsy samples will be obtained of the selected lesion, 
with multiple samples obtained by: 1) sequential advancement of needle passes through a fixed 
 
 
Version 04/06/2021  57 
 trocar, such that each needle pass progresses more deeply into the bone lesion; or 2) re -insertion 
and re -direction of the needle and/or  trocar through another region of the bone lesion.  At the 
completion of the procedure, CT imaging will be repeated to assess for immediate complications.  
The patient will be observed for 2-4 hours before discharge.    Samples will be transported to the U WCCC TRIP (Translational Research Initiatives in Pathology) 
lab for formalin fixation, paraffin embedding, sectioning, H&E staining, and ultimately for IHC analysis as described above.   Other types of gene expression profiling may be used as well to 
evalua te gene expression changes, and changes in T cell subtypes infiltrating tumors prior to and 
after treatment.  
 
 
E. FLT PET/CT Imaging 
 
3’-Deoxy-3’-[18F]Fluorothymidine (FLT) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed 
tomography (CT) uses a thymidine analogue  that accumulates in proliferating tissue.  Proliferating 
tissue could include malignant lesions  or immune cells .  Following vaccination we have observed 
a proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells specific for PAP, at least as assessed in vitro following 
reencounter with the PAP antigen [ 29, 31].  In a study of patients with melanoma treated 
intranodally with a dendritic cell vaccine, FLT PET/CT could detect uptake in treated lymph nodes  
compared to control lymph nodes following vaccination, uptake that persisted for up to 3 weeks [78].  Consequently, FLT PET/CT may be useful as a molecular imaging tool to  detect immune 
activation after immunization, at the same time as detecting decreases in proliferating tumor masses as a result of treatment.  We hypothesize that FLT PET/CT will be able to detect increased uptake in left axillary draining lymph nodes (dra ining site of intradermal immunization) at 12 
weeks compared with pre- treatment studies, and that a decrease in uptake will be observed in soft 
tissue metastatic deposits.  FLT PET/CT will be performed at baseline (within 4 weeks of starting treatment) and  at week 12, thus enabling comparative evaluation with other imaging obtained at 
that time and biopsy results.  FLT PET/CT I MAGING PROCEDURES:   To ensure uniformity as well as optimal data 
interpretation, analyses will be conducted under the supervision of [CONTACT_15299], PhD (co -
investigator) at the University of Wisconsin Image Analysis Core (IMAC) facility, with all 
radiographic analysis by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Jeraj and designees blinded to study treatment arm.   • At the beginning of each imaging session, a CT scan will be obtained on the combined 
PET/CT scanner. The CT scan is an integral part of the PET/CT acquisition and serves for attenuation correction calculations and better PET/CT image co -registration. It will enable better 
delineation of the patient anatomy, which will be important when comparing different scans. An FLT-PET scan will follow. The patients will be injected up to 15 mCi ( 555 MBq) of 
18F-FLT.   
 • Dynamic imaging (15 cm field of view) will be performed first to obtain arterial input 
function and post injection kinetics of the tracer. The field of view will be positioned so that either a tumor mass  or axillary dra ining nodes  will be in the field of view. If applicable, the region that 
will allow at least a partial heart view will be selected. The dynamic scan will be performed for 30 minutes. The arterial blood decay curve of 
18F-FLT will be estimated from the time -dependent 
 
 
Version 04/06/2021  58 
 activity in the left ventricular blood pool. The arterio -venous difference will be quantitatively 
assayed from the time- dependent activity in the right cardiac chambers. 
 
• After the initial dynamic imaging of the heart region, a static whole body scan wil l be 
initiated. The whole body scan will be initiated at approximately 60 minutes after the injection. To minimize errors of the relative change assessment, the subsequent whole body scans will be 
initiated within 5 minutes of the initiation time of the ba seline scan. The whole body scan will be 
performed with up to 10 minutes/scanning position, lasting up to 60 minutes. The patient will be scanned “head first”. Together with the dynamic imaging, the total body scanning time will be up to 90 minutes (30 minutes dynamic plus up to 60 minutes static whole body scan).   • All th e scans will be acquired in a 3 D mode to increase spatial resolution of the imaging 
data.    FLT- PET/CT image reconstruction:  
 
• For both the dynamic and whole body scans, two PET image reconstructions will be used 
– optimal qualitative and optimal quantitative reconstructions. The optimal quantitative 
reconstruction will be used for quantitative evaluation; the optimal qualitative reconstruction will 
be used for clinical read of the FLT PET/CT scans.  
  FLT- PET/CT image analysis:  
 • All the PET image data will be coregistered to the baseline (pretreatment) image data to 
enable comparison of the spatially dependent changes of the investigated tumor and metastasis parameters during the ther apy. The scans will be coregistered based on the CT data. Each of the 
metastase s will be coregistered locally, segmented and treated in dividually. Up to five metastase s 
will be used in this analysis. Both the CT data, as well as the corresponding FLT PET d ata, will 
be analyzed for spatial correlation. The correlation coefficients, as well as joint histograms, will be used to evaluate similarity of the distributions.   • The CT data will be analyzed to establish anatomical changes in tumor size. Evaluation 
will be based on the change of the volume of the metastatic mass, as segmented from a CT scan: 
ΔV=V
follow- up-Vbaseline . 
 • The dynamic FLT -PET/CT imaging data will be used to perform kinetic analysis of the 
imaging data, thus allowing increase correlation to the biological parameters (cell proliferation index).   • The static total body FLT -PET/CT imaging data will be used to identify tumor masses. 
Each of the metastasis will be treated individually. Standardized uptake values (SUV) will be used 
to assess the FLT PET uptake. SUVmax, SUVmean and SUVtotal will be recorded and analyzed. In addition, the spatial distribution of the change will be determined, in case of heterogeneous tumor uptake distribution.  
 
 
Version 04/06/2021  59 
  
F. NaF PET/CT Imaging  
 
One of the best  PET imaging agents for detection of bone metastasis is 18F-Sodium fluoride (NaF). 
NaF uptake is characterized by [CONTACT_15256], which results in a high bone -to-background ratio in a short time. The retention and 
clearance mechanisms of NaF are well understood (16) . NaF retention is a 2 -phase process (17) . 
NaF is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_15148], which leads to rapid clearance from the plasma. It is cleared from plasma in a biexponential manner -- the first phase has a half -life of 0.4 h, and the second 
phase has a half -life of 2.6 h (18) . Retention of NaF in the bone is almost perfect --  essentially all 
the NaF that is delivered to bone by [CONTACT_15257] (19) , illustrated by [CONTACT_15258], only about 10% of the injected dose remains in the blood (20). In the first phase, the 
18F2 ion exchanges for an OH 2 ion on the surface of the hydroxyapatite 
matrix of bone. In the second phase, the 18F2 ion migrates into the crystalline matrix of bone, where 
it is retained until the bone is remodeled; therefore its retention directly reflects active bone metabolism. As a result, its accumulation is proportional to both blood flow and osteoblastic (metabolic) activity; thus,  it represents an excellent PET tracer for imaging of bone metastasis (21, 
22). NaF PET h as been validated clinically as a diagnostic imaging modality. In this context, NaF 
PET has been shown to be superior to both FDG PET and 
99mTc-MDP SPECT in detection of bone 
metastases (16, 25). NaF is a  FDA approved imaging tracer for use with PET/CT. We hypothesize 
that NaF PET/CT will be able to detect early changes in number of bone metastases, as well as 
changes in osteoblastic activity that may reflect inflammatory effects. Three NaF PET/CT will be obtained in 6 - 10 patients with known osteoblastic metastases (baseline, at week 6 (+/ - 1 wk), and 
again at week 12 (+/- 1 wk) ).  
 
Sodium Fluoride F 18 (NaF) Injection 
 
NaF is commercially available.  Ordering,  Dosimetry, Quality Assurance, Quality Control, and 
Storage will be per usual protocols. 
 
“Sodium Fluoride F 18 Injection is provided as a ready- to-use, isotonic, sterile, pyrogen -free, 
clear and colorless solution. Each mL of the solution contains 10–400 mCi fluoride 18F at the end 
of synthesis (EOS) reference time in 0.9% aqueous sodium chloride. Fluoride 18F ions decay by

11. Statistical Considerations  
 
A. Overview 
 This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_15149] a DNA vaccine 
encoding PAP (and using a rhGM -CSF adjuvant) with a monoclonal antibody (pembrolizumab) 
specific for PD -1.  The rationale for conducting this trial is summarized in Section 2 (E).  
 
B. Objectives  
 
The primary objectives are to : 
 
1. To evaluate the safety of pembrolizumab in combination with pTVG -HP in patients with 
castration -resistant, metastatic prostate cancer  
2. To determine the 6- month progression- free survival and median time to radiographic 
progression in patients with castration- resistant metastatic prostate cancer treated with 
pembrolizumab in combination with pTVG- HP 
3. To evaluate the anti -tumor response rates (objective response rate and PSA response rate, 
using PCWG2 criteria) in patients with castration -resistant metastatic prostate cancer 
treated with pembrolizumab in combination with pTVG- HP 
 
The secondary objective s are to :

associated with prolonged (6-month) radiographic progression- free survival  
2. To evaluate effects of schedule (concurrent versus delayed administration of pembroliz umab) on the magnitude of PAP -specific T -cell responses, PD -1 expression on 
circulating T cells, and PD -L1 expression on circulating epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663] (CEC) and on 
tumor biopsies 
3. To determine the median time to radiographic progression using concurrent admi nistration 
schedules 
 
The exploratory objectives are to: 
 
1. To evaluate effects of treatment on the number of circulating tumor cells  
2. To evaluate PAP -specific antibody responses following treatment with pembrolizumab and 
pTVG- HP DNA vaccine  
3. To determine whether treatment with either sequence elicits immunologic antigen spread to other prostate associated antigens

biopsies is predictive of objective clinical response 
5. To determine whether treatment elicits expression of other regulatory molecules on tumor -
specific T cells (e.g. TIM3, BTLA, and LAG3) or tumor cells (e.g. HVEM, phosphatidyl 
serine, PD -L2)   
6. To determine whether PD -1-regulated antigen -specific T -cells identified by [CONTACT_15179] -1

and activity (SUV) in osteoblastic metastases as measur ed by [CONTACT_15181]/CT. 
 
C. Study Design 
 
The study is designed as a randomized, two- arm, open- label, single institution pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251].  Study 
arms will be defined as follows:  
 
Arm 1:  pTVG- HP (100 µg) with rhGM -CSF (208 µg) administered intradermally (i.d.) 
biweekly 6 times beginning at day 1 pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, administered 
intravenously every 3 weeks 4 times, beginning at day 1  
 Arm 2:  pTVG- HP (100 µg) with rhGM -CSF (208 µg) administered intradermally (i.d.) 
biweekly 6 times beginning at day 1 pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, administered intravenously biweekly [ADDRESS_14635] pTVG- HP vaccination  
 Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned in 1:1 fashion to either Arm 1 or Arm 2.   During accrual to these 2 study arms, clinical observations suggested it could be advantageous to further investigate the combined treatment arm (Arm 2), but over a longer period of time.  Specifically, objective responses and PSA declines were observed during the [ADDRESS_14636], non-randomized arm was proposed after 12 evaluable subjects were  accrued  to Arms 1 and 2 to further investigate 
concurrent treatment, and specifically timed with vaccine administration.    Extended treatment Arm 3: 
pTVG-HP (100 µg) with rhGM- CSF (208 µg) administered intradermally (i.d.)  
 every 3 weeks, for a maximum of 16 doses Pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, with a maximum dose of [ADDRESS_14637] pTVG -HP vaccination  
 During accrual to Arm 3, laboratory observations suggested it may be preferable to use vaccine at every 2- week intervals rather than every 3 -week intervals.  In order to evaluate this s chedule with 
concurrent pembrolizumab, but ideally reduce the potential toxicity from pembrolizumab by 
 
 
[CONTACT_15261] 04/06/2021  62 
 decreasing the frequency of administration, a separate extended treatment arm (Arm 4) is proposed 
after completion of accrual to Arm 3.   
 Extended treat ment Arm 4:  
pTVG-HP (100 µg) with rhGM- CSF (208 µg) administered intradermally (i.d.)  
 every 2 weeks, for a maximum of 24 doses Pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, with a maximum dose of [ADDRESS_14638] two study arms with an allocation ratio of 1:1. The 
randomization will be based on permutated blocks of size 2 -4.  Treatment arm assignment will be 
made by [CONTACT_15262]/investigational pharmacy after a patient has been registered.   
 
E. Sample Size and Power Calculation  
 The expected 6- months progression- free survival rate in Arm 2 (pembrolizumab is administered 
sequentially after pTVG -HP) is 25%.  It is hypothesized that the treatment of pTVG -HP, when 
administered concurrently with pembrolizumab (Arm 1), will result in a substantial increase in the 6-month progression -free survival rate. Specific ally, it is anticipated that the [ADDRESS_14639] 65 -75%. The following table shows the required sample 
sizes for detecting various differences in the 6 -month progression- free survival rates between the 
two s tudy arms, assuming 80% power and a one -sided 0.10 significance level. Since this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_11480], a less stringent significance level of 0.10 rather the traditional 0.05 level will be used for the primary efficacy evaluation.   
 6-month progression free survival rate Arm 1  
6-month progression free  
survival  rate Arm 2  0.65 0.70 0.75 0.80 
0.20 15 11 10 9 
0.25 17 15 11 10 
   A sample size of 15 patients per arm is proposed. This sample size will provide 80% power to detect an anticipated absolute difference of at least 45% (e.g., 25% vs. 70% or 20% vs. 65%) in the 6- months progression free survival rates between the two arms. These calculations are based 
on Fisher’s exact test.  Furthermore, the proposed sample size of 15 patients per arm is also 
sufficient to provide accuracy in estimating toxicity rates.  Specifically, the toxicity rates (i.e., of 
grade ≥ 2, grade ≥ 3, grade 4 toxicities)  for each arm will be estimated with a standard error of less 
than 15% and the 95% confidence interval of the toxicity rates will be no wider than 45%. The probability of observing at least one event of a serious adverse event within a study a rm is >95% 
if the adverse event rate is 20%. Analogously, the probability of observing at least one event of serious adverse event is at least 79% if the adverse event rate is only 10%.   
 
 
Version 04/06/2021  63 
 In order to account for unevaluable (for efficacy evaluation) patients, 32 eligible patients (16 per 
arm) will be accrued and randomized.  Based on past experience with this patient population treated at our institution, we anticipate that the proposed total number of [ADDRESS_14640] the alternative hypothesis that the median is greater than 3 months. A median time to radiographic progression of 6 months or more, on the other hand, w ill 
be considered as promising to warrant further clinical evaluation of the proposed concurrent administration schedule. With the proposed sample size of 20 evaluable patients for the exten ded 
treatment Arm 3, a median time to radiographic progression of 6 months will be detected with 90% power at the one -sided 0.[ADDRESS_14641] the alternative hypothesis that the median is greater than 3 months. With the proposed sample size of 20 evaluable patients for the extended treatment Arm 4, a median time to radiographic progression of 6 months will be detected with 90% power at the one -sided 0.[ADDRESS_14642] error of less than 12% and the corresponding two- sided 95% confidence 
intervals will be no wider than 40%.   NaF PET/CT will be obtained in [ADDRESS_14643] 80% power to detect moderate to large effect sizes ranging from 1.0 -2.0 for the diffe rences in SUV metrics between time points at the 
two-sided 0.05 significance level.   
   
F. Analysis 
 
F.1. General  
 This section outlines the statistical analysis strategy and procedures for the study.  Prior to the analysis of the final study data, a detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be written describing all analyses that will be performed.  
Summary tabulations will be presented that will display the number of observations, mean, standard deviation, median, range, minimum, and maximum for continuous variables and the number and percent per category for ordinal and categorical data.  All endpoi nts of this study will 
 
 
Version 04/06/2021  64 
 be presented graphically where possible using boxplots and histograms for continuous variables 
and (stacked) bar charts for categorical variables.  Data analysis will be performed using SAS® 
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina) version 9.[ADDRESS_14644] been treated according to protocol (all inclusion/exclusion criteria are satisfied, and adequate treatment compliance (complete treatment to at least day 43). The safety population consists of all subjects who received at least one dose of pTVG HP alo ne or in combination with pembrolizumab. All primary, secondary and correlative 
outcomes will be analyzed for both the IIT and per -protocol population. The IIT population will 
be the primary analysis population. Safety will be evaluated using the safety population.    
F.3. Baseline Comparability  
 All measurements (variables) collected at baseline will be summarized and compared between study arms.  These include demographic variables, ECOG PS, lab parameters (CBC, chemistry panel, serum testosterone, PSA and PAP ) medical history information and CTCs.  Comparisons 
between study arms of baseline variables on a continuous scale will be performed using a two -
sample t -test and/or nonparametric Wilcoxon Rank Sum test.  Comparisons between study arms 
of baseline variables on a categorical scale will be performed using Fisher’s exact test.   
F.4. Analysis of Primary Endpoints 
 
F.4.1. Analysis of Toxicity Rates and Serum Chemistry Parameters 
 Subjects will be evaluated at each visit by a review of systems based on the most recent version of the NCI common toxicity criteria.  Furthermore, serum chemistries, including renal function tests, blood counts, liver function tests, and serum amylase, will be evaluated at 6- 12 week intervals. 
Toxicities will be summarized by [CONTACT_15263] y in tabular format. Toxicity rates (grade 2, grade 
3, grade 4, grade ≥ 2, grade ≥ 3, etc.) will be calculated for each study arm and reported along the corresponding 95% confidence intervals. The 95% confidence intervals will be constructed using the Wils on score method. Fisher’s exact test will be used to compare toxicity rates between study 
arms. Serum chemistry and amylase parameters will be summarized using standard descriptive statistics. Changes from the baseline assessment will be evaluated using a paired t- test. 
 
F.4.2. 6-Month Progression Free Survival Rate and Median Time to Radiographic 
Progression 
 The 6 -month progression- free survival rate, along with the corresponding two- sided 95% 
confidence intervals, will be reported for each arm, and for the overall combined study. The Wilson 
 
 
Version 04/06/[ADDRESS_14645] the confidence intervals. Fisher’s exact test will be used to 
compare the 6 -month progression- free survival rates between study arms.  
 Median time to radiographic progression will be estimated for each  arm using the Kaplan- Meier 
method. The median time to radiographic progression will be reported for each of the four arms 
along with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals  which will be constructed using the 
Brookmeyer- Crowley method. The log- rank test will be used to perform the comparison of time 
to radiographic progression between Arm [ADDRESS_14646] the alternative hypothesis that the median time to radiographic progressio n is greater than 3 months.  
 In order to evaluate the 6- month progression -free rate and median time to radiographic progression 
as a function of baseline time point (pretreatment or [ADDRESS_14647] treatment, the analysis will be 
conducted using two different baseline values: (1) Date of randomization, and (2) 3- months disease 
assessment.  
 
F.4.3. Objective Response Rate and PSA Response Rate  
 
The objective response rate and PSA response rate will be calculated for each study arm and for 
both arms combined along with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals. The Wilson score method will be used to construct the confidence intervals. Fisher’s exact test will be used to compare the objective response and PSA response rates between study arms. Duration of response will be analyzed using the Kaplan -Meier method.  
 
F.5. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints 
 
F.5.1. PAP-Specific Immune Response  
 The number and frequencies of PAP -specific immune responses will be summarized in tabular 
format for each study arm and both study arms combined. A log -linear model will be used to 
evaluate whether PAP -specific immune response predicts the 6 -months progression- free survival 
rate. The interaction between treatment (pembrolizumab administered sequentially versus delayed) and PAP -specific immune respo nse will be included in the model. Analogously, a Cox 
proportional hazard regression model will be used to examine the association between PAP -
specific immune response and the time to radiographic progression.   
F.5.2. PAP-Specific T -Cell Response, PD-[ADDRESS_14648] deviations and 
ranges for each study arm separately and for both arms combined. The number and frequencies of PAP-specific T -cell responses will be summarized in tabular format. Fisher’s exact test will be 
used to compare the PAP -specific T -cell respon se rates between study arms. A linear regression 
model or a negative binomial regression model will be utilized to evaluate the effects of schedule (concurrent versus delayed administration of pembrolizumab) on PD -1 expression on the number 
of circulating T cells, and PD -L1 expression on the number of circulating epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663]. The 
 
 
Version 04/06/2021  66 
 choice of the model will be dependent on the distribution of the outcome variables (number of 
circulating T -cells and number of circulating epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663]).  
 
F.6. Exploratory Analyses  
 
F.6.1. Evaluation of Treatment Effects on the Number of Circulating Tumor Cells  
 The number of circulating tumor cells will be summarized in terms of m eans and standard 
deviations. Within each arm, and for both arms combined, changes in the number of circulating tumor cells from the pre -treatment (date of screening/randomization) to the post- treatment 
assessments (day 43, day 85, day 169, month 9, and of f-study) assessments will be evaluated using 
a paired t -test. A two -sample t -test will be used to compare the number of circulating tumor cells 
at each time point, and the changes in the number of circulating tumor cells from the pre -treatment 
assessment, between study arms.  In order to evaluate longitudinal changes in the number of 
circulating tumor cells, linear mixed effects modeling with subject specific random effects will be conducted.   
F.6.2. Evaluating of Treatment Effects on PAP -specific Antibody Responses  
 The number and frequency of PAP -specific antibody responses will be summarized in tabular 
format, stratified by [CONTACT_15264]. A generalized linear mixed effects model with subject specific random effects will be used to evaluate the treatment effect of  the proposed pTVG -HP DNA vaccine and pembrolizumab (sequentially versus concurrently) 
combination on  PAP- specific antibody response.  
 
F.6.3. Evaluation whether Treatment with either Sequence Elicits Immunologic 
Antigen Spread to other Prostate Associated Antigens 
 The detection of antigen spread to other prostate associated antigens, and the identification of specific antigens recognized, will be analyzed descriptively.  Furthermore, linear regression analysis will be conducted to evaluate whether treatment with either sequence (pembrolizumab administered sequentially or concurrently) elicits immunologic antigen spread to other prostate associated antigens.  
 
F.6.4. Evaluation of Pre -Existing or Vaccine Induced PD -L1 Expression on CEC 
or Tumor B iopsies as a Predictor for Clinical Response 
 Logistic regression analysis will be conducted to examine whether pre -existing or vaccine induced 
PD-L1 expression on CEC or tumor biopsies predict clinical response. This analysis will be 
conducted for both arms combined. The results will be summarized in terms of odds ratios along with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals.   
F.6.5. Evaluation whether Treatment with either Sequence Elicits other 
Regulatory Molecules on Tumor- Specific T cells or Tumor Cells  
 Linear regression analysis will be conducted to determine whether treatment with either sequence 
elicits other regulatory molecules on tumor- specific T cells or tumor cells.  
 
 
Version 04/06/[ADDRESS_14649] clinical response. The sensitivity, specificity, 
negative predictive value and positive predictive value of PD -1 regulated antigen specific T -cell 
responses for predicting clinical response will be calculated and reported along with the 
corresponding 95% confidence intervals.   
F.6.7. Evaluation of changes in FLT uptake by [CONTACT_15180]/CT after Treatment with 
pTVG- HP with or without Pembrolizumab  
 Standard PET parameters, including SUV
total, SUV max, SUV mean, and the number of lesions, in 
terms of soft tissue lesions and major lymph node groups, will be obtained.  P arameters will be 
summarized in terms of means, standard deviations and ranges. Within each arm and  for both arms 
combined, changes in parameters will be evaluated using a paired t -test (for SUV) or 
nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank test (number of lesions). Since the distribution of SUV values is generally skewed, a log- transformation will be utilized  before conducting the comparisons. A 
two-sample t -test or nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used to compare changes in 
parameters between study arms.   
 
F.6.8 Evaluation of changes in NaF uptake by [CONTACT_15181]/CT after treatment with 
pTVG- HP with or  without Pembrolizumab  
 Standard PET parameters, including SUV
total, SUV max, SUV mean, and the number of lesions, in 
terms of osteoblastic lesions, will be obtained  using established PERCIST criteria .  To ensure 
uniformity, the established UW Nuclear Medicine image acquisition and reconstruction procedures for NaF PET/CT will be utilized. Please refer to the UW Nuclear Medicine Standard Operating Procedure for image acquisition and other image -related details. Image analysis will be 
performed in Nuclear Medicine and led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Perlman (co- investigator).  
  
12. Administrative Considerations  
 
A. Specimen  Handling 
 
Upon entry into the study, each subject will be assigned a unique identification number.  All materials collected on that subject will be labeled with that number only, for reasons of confidentiality, and specimens may be listed with unique codes for individual subjects and obtained at the different time points.  Lymphocytes collected will be stored in liquid nitrogen, and sera will be aliquoted and stored at –80°C in the research laboratory of the protocol sponsor (Dr. McNeel) for immune analyses.  
 
 
 
Version 04/06/[ADDRESS_14650] 
 
In accordance with federal regulations (21 CFR 312.66), an Institutional Review Board (IRB) that complies with the regulations in [ADDRESS_14651] review and approve this protocol and the informed consent form prior to the initiation o f the study at each investigator site.  In addition, the 
study cannot be instituted without FDA approval of the vaccine formulations.  Finally, the trial will be conducted with adherence to this protocol, following good clinical practice (GCP) guidelines, and in compliance with other applicable regulatory requirements.  Any modifications 
to the protocol must follow the procedure as outlined in Section [ADDRESS_14652] also be informed that they may withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without jeopardizing their future treatment.  In  accordance with Federal regulations (21 
CFR 312), all patients must sign the IRB -approved consent form.   
  
13. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
 
A. Definitions  
 An adverse event is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory fin ding), symptom or disease temporally associated with a medical treatment or 
procedure, regardless of whether it is considered related to the treatment or procedure.  Adverse events are categorized as definite, probable, possible, unlikely or unrelated in relation to the medical treatment or procedure performed.  A life -threatening event is defined as any adverse 
event that places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction.  Serious adverse events are any event s occurring that result in any of the following 
outcomes:  
1. Subject death 
2. Life-threatening adverse event 
3. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
4. Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
5. Congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 Adverse events are classified by [CONTACT_15265], as described in Appendix A.  The defined grades use the following general guidelines:   0 No adverse event or within normal lim its 
 1 Mild adverse event  
 2 Moderate adverse event  
 3 Severe adverse event  
 
 
Version 04/06/[ADDRESS_14653] be performed and the results reported.  All tests that reveal an abnormality considered to be drug- or vaccine -related will be repeated at appropriate intervals until 
the course is determined or a return to normal (or pre -treatment) values occurs.  Information will 
be recorded as noted above.     
B. Oversight and Monitoring Plan 
The UWCCC Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) is responsible for the regular 
review and monitoring of all ongoing clinical research in the UWCCC.  A summary of DSMC activities are as follows:  
• Reviews all clinical trials conducted at the UWCCC for subject safety, protocol compliance, and data integrity.  
• Reviews all Serious Adverse Events (SAE) requiring expedited reporting, as defined in the protocol, for all clinical trials conducted at the UWCCC, and studies conducted 
at external sites for which UWCCC acts as an oversight body. 
• Review s all repo rts generated through the UWCCC DSMS elements (Internal Audits, 
Quality Assurance Reviews, Response Reviews, Compliance Reviews, and Protocol Summary Reports) described in Section II of this document. 
• Notifies the Local  Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_15150], if applicable, any 
requirements for corrective action related to data or safety issues.  
• Notifies the CRC of DSMC decisions and any correspondence from the DSMC to the Local  Principal Investigator.  
• Works in conjunction with the UW Health Sciences IRB in the review of relevant safety information as well as protocol deviations, non- compliance, and unanticipated 
problems reported by [CONTACT_15266].  
• Ensures that notification is of SAEs requiring expedited reporting is provided to external si tes participating in multi- institutional clinical trials coordinated by [CONTACT_15267].  
  
C. Monitoring and Reporting Guidelines 
Phase I/II and Phase II Trials  
 
 
 
Version 04/06/2021  70 
 UWCCC quality assurance and monitoring activities are determined by [CONTACT_15268] (PRMC) .  All protocols (including Intervention Trials, Non- Intervention  Trials, Behavioral and 
Nutritional Studies, and trials conducted under a Training Grant) are evaluated by [CONTACT_15269].  UWCC C monitoring requirements for trials without an acceptable 
external DSMB are as follows:

ensuring SAEs are reported to the FDA as well as to all participating investigators.  
 
See Section E.2 for detailed instructions on SAE reporting. 
 
Sponsor -Investigator Responsibilities for SAE Review  
 
In the event the UWCCC Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_15155] -Investigator (i.e., the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_15156]), the PI [INVESTIGATOR_15157] 21 CFR 312.32.  In this capacity, the UWCCC PI [INVESTIGATOR_15158] a determination of 1) suspectedness (i.e., whether there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE); and 2) unexpectedness (the event is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed) in the context of this study.  SAE with suspected causal ity to study drug and deemed unexpected are reported as IND Safety Reports by [CONTACT_15271] [INVESTIGATOR_15159], all participating investigators on the study, and the external global sponsor (if applicable) within [ADDRESS_14655] 
suspected causality to the study drug will be reported by [CONTACT_15272] [INVESTIGATOR_15159], all participating investigators on the study, and the external global sponsor (if applicable) within 7 calendar days.  
 
 
Study Progress Review  
Protocol Summary Reports (PSR) are required to be submitted to the DSMC in the timeframe 
determined by [CONTACT_15273] (quarterly; semi -annually; or annually). The PSR provides 
a cumulative report of SAEs, as well as instances of non -compliance , protocol deviations, and 
unanticipated problems, toxicities and responses that have occurred on the protocol in the 
timeframe specified.  PSRs for those protocols scheduled for review are reviewed at each DSMC meeting. Cumulative reports will also be due  annually to FDA (pertaining to this IND), and to the 
NIH OBA (pertaining to this OBA reference number).  
 Protocol Summary Reports enable DSMC committee members to assess whether significant benefits or risks are occurring that would warrant study suspension or closure. This information is evaluated by [CONTACT_15274] (e.g., reports from Internal Audits, Quality Assurance Reviews, etc.) occurring since the prior review of the protocol by [CONTACT_6802].  Additionally, the DSMC requires the study team to submit external 
 
 
Version 04/06/2021  72 
 DSMB or DSMC reports, external monitoring findings for industry- sponsored studies, and any 
other pertinent study- related information.  
 
In the event that there is significant risk warranting  study suspension or closure, the DSMC will 
notify the Local PI [INVESTIGATOR_15160] 
(e.g., suspension or closure).  The DSMC ensures that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_15161] a  clinical trial to the sponsor (e.g., NCI Program Director, Industry Sponsor Medical 
Monitor, Cooperative Group Study Chair, etc.) and other appropriate agencies. DSMC findings and requirements for follow-up action are submitted to the CRC.   
 
E. Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events 
 
Depending on the nature, severity, and attribution of the serious adverse event an SAE report will be phoned in, submitted in writing, or both according to Table D-[ADDRESS_14656] also be reported to the UW IRB (if applicable), and any sponsor/funding agency not already included in the list.

14. Potential Risks and Benefits, and Procedures to Minimize Risk  
 
A. Potential Risks 
 
A.1. From immunization with DNA plasmid encoding PAP 
 
Two potential toxicities might be predicted to occur from DNA -based vaccines.  The first would 
be immediate toxicity due to the vaccination itself, and a second would be due to immunological consequences of the vaccination targeting other unrelated tissues.  An intradermal route of administration will be used, and is preferred given the presence of Langerhans’ antigen- presenting 
cells in the dermis.  Intradermal administrations, however, carry a risk of immediate allergic reactions.  For that reason, subjec ts will be remain for [ADDRESS_14661] been rare ( grade 3 
angioedema observed in 1 of over 50 treated subjects, <5% individuals).  With respect to eliciting unwanted immunological reactions, PAP, a protein whose expres sion is 
essentially restricted to the prostate, does share homology with other tissue phosphatases, notably lysosomal acid phosphatase (LAP), most prevalent in pancreatic tissue.  No such toxicity has been reported in clinical trials targeting PAP by [CONTACT_15276] a dendritic cell vaccine, and the generation of 
 
 
Version 04/06/[ADDRESS_14662] suggested the possibility of this occurring is less than the spontaneous mutati on rate, and therefore 
not a real risk [ 79].  Even should this occur, there is little reason to suspect that this would put 
subjects at any increased risk, and in this patient population with treated prostate cancer, there is little risk of transfer to offspring.  There are no known risks to blood donation during or after 
immunization, however subjects will be requested to not donate blood from study entry until completion of all study procedures.  The DNA itself is not hazardous (in that it encodes no viral proteins, is not radioactive, and is not itself a  carcinogen) and does not pose additional risk to subjects or study personnel.  However, 
standard precautions to reduce the risk of needle sticks to study personnel will be performed.  
A.2. From intradermal treatment with rhGM -CSF 
 GM-CSF, administered intradermally with the vaccine, is being used as a vaccine adjuvant, and 
has demonstrated safety from multiple other vaccine trials in humans.  Common side effects include erythema and induration at the site of immunization (lasting for several days), and a transient decrease in peripheral white blood cell counts (lasting for several hours), mild flu- like 
symptoms (lasting for several hours).  It has also been observed and reported that T -cell and 
antibody responses can occur to GM -CSF, but without any known clinic al sequelae [63].  
Uncommon and rare side effects, which have been less frequently observed with daily administration of higher doses of GM -CSF, include: vomiting; diarrhea; fatigue; weakness; 
headache; decreased appetite; feeling of faintness; facial flushing; pain in the bones, muscles , 
chest, abdomen, or joints; blood clots or unusual bleeding symptoms; rapid or irregular heartbeat or other heart problems; kidney and liver dysfunction; fluid accumulation or worsening of pre -
existing fluid accumulation in arms and legs, in the lungs, and around the heart that may result in breathing problems and heart failure; allergic reactions; sloughing of skin; liver enlargement; Guillain -Barré syndrome; hypotension; loss of consciousness; dyspnea.  In a previous phase I trial 
with this DNA vaccine and GM -CSF, two patients experienced chest and back pain, attributed to 
the GM -CSF, which lasted less than 10 minutes and occurred within one hour of receiving GM -
CSF.  For this reason, all subjects will be monitored for one hour after receiving each DNA immunization treatment.  
 
 
Version 04/06/2021  77 
  
A.3. From treatment with pembrolizumab  
 
Pembrolizumab (Keytruda®, [COMPANY_006]) is a human programmed death receptor -1 (PD -1)-blocking 
antibody.  Given that PD -[ADDRESS_14663], the goal of this therapy is to “unleash” T cells, and cytolytic CD8+ T cel ls in particular, that 
recognize tumor cells.  In this trial, the goal is to elicit a specific population of CD8+ T cells that recognize prostate tumors, and allow them to lyse prostate tumor by [CONTACT_15277] -L1 on prostate tumors to inhibit their function.  But because PD -[ADDRESS_14664] been relative ly 
uncommon (occurring in <10% of patients with melanoma treated), multiple different immune adverse events have been observed.  These have included immune -mediated pneumonitis, colitis, 
hepatitis, hypophysitis, nephritis, hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidis m.  Other clinically 
significant, immune -mediated adverse reactions have been observed in <1% of patients treated 
with pembrolizumab, including exfoliative dermatitis, uveitis, arthritis, myositis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, partial seizures, adrenal insufficiency, myasthenic syndrome, optic neuritis, and rhabdomyolysis.  Most of these events resolved following discontinuation of pembrolizumab, or in some cases following treatment with systemic corticosteroids.  But because of these rare, but potential ly serious immune adverse events, patients will be followed closely for unusual new 
symptoms.    
In addition to these immune -mediated adverse events, other common adverse reactions (reported 
in > 20% of patients) included fatigue, cough, nausea, pruritis, rash, decreased appetite, 
constipation, arthralgia, and diarrhea.   
 
A.4. From blood tests 
 Drawing blood may cause temporary discomfort and bruising at the site of venipuncture.  Skin infections, while possible, are extremely rare as a result of blood draws  
 
A.5. From leukapheresis 
 Adverse events from leukapheresis  are uncommon.  Bruising at the site of venipuncture for venous 
access is possible, as is a rare risk of infection related to this venipuncture.  Anticoagulants (ACD) are used during cell collection, but these have not been associated with subsequent bleeding problems.  There is a rare risk for citrate toxicity as a result of the citrate anticoagulation used during cell collection.  This can cause hypocalcaemia and muscle spasms.  There is no associated increased risk of infection from removing white blood cells , however a mild anemia can result for 
1-[ADDRESS_14665] be measured within 1 week of each leukapheresis; 
an hematocrit < 30% and/or platelet count <50,000 will be used as a contraindication for leukapheresis.    
A.6. From tetanus immunization 
 
 
 
Version 04/06/2021  78 
 A tetanus booster vaccine (commercially available vaccine delivered as an intramuscular injection) 
will be delivered prior to receiving  the DNA vaccine as an immunological positive control for the laboratory analysis.  While this is a standard, well tolerated immunization, rare potential side effects of this vaccine could include: difficulty in breathing or swallowing; hives; swelling of the eyes, face or  inside of the nose; confusion; convulsions; headaches; sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]; lymphadenopathy ; 
and vomiting.  Other mild adverse effects not requiring  medical attention include: chills; fever; 
mild irritability or tiredness; skin rash; or pain, tenderness, redness, itching or swelling at the site of injection.  
A.7. From tissue biopsies  
 
Standard laboratory tests will be done to assess bleeding risk before the procedure is done.  The sample will be taken from an area of reduced risk of complications .    Possible side effects of a 
biopsy include bleeding, infection, bruising, pain or discomfort at the biopsy site and possible side effects from the local anesthetic (pain or bruising at the site where anesthetic is given).  The main discomfort associated with this test is pain when the bone or tissue is being withdrawn. In order to make the procedure more comfortable, subjects will get a local anesthetic to numb the area. A mild 
sedative may also be given . While sedated, subjects will be able to respond to commands.  It is 
recommended that subjects be observed for 2-[ADDRESS_14666] scans for biopsies:  At the time of biopsy, a CT scan may be done to determine where the biopsy will be done.  After the biopsy, a CT scan may be done over the biopsy site to look for any immediate complications.  These scans will be performed in addition to the scans as part of normal cancer care.  The scans involve exposure to radiation in the form of x- rays.  The level of radiation 
used is kept to a minimum to prevent damage to body cells.  Under some rare circumstances of prolonged, high- dose exposure, x- rays can cause adverse health effects, such as skin reddening 
(erythema), skin tissue injury, hair loss, and cataracts.  The amount of radiation from the additi onal 
scans in this study is not known to be associated with any serious health risks. The exposure related 
to this CT scan equals approximately one year of standard environmental background radiation. 
 
A.8. From FLT PET/CT and NaF PET/CT 
 
The FLT PET/CT and NaF  PET/CT scans will expose subjects to a small amount of radiation, 
approximately equal to one bone scan.. The amount of radiation subjects will receive from this 
study is within the limits of the federal government’s rules and regulations and is thought to be safe.  Risks generally associated with insertion of a catheter ( for the administration of the tracer) 
include pain, bruising, lightheadedness, and on rare occasions, infection.    Reproductive risks of the FLT PET/CT and NaF PET/CT scans : The effects of the FLT  and NaF  
tracer s on the developi[INVESTIGATOR_15165].  Subjects should discuss the use of reliable methods 
of birth control like condoms and spermicidal foam or sexual abstinence with their study doctor (s).  
Procreative sex should be avoided prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation.  If a subject’s partner is of child -bearing potential, the subject  must be su rgically sterile or use an 
acceptable m ethod of birth control.  If a subject’s partner becomes pregnant while the subject is  
participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. 
 
A.9. Confidentiality  
 
 
 
Version 04/06/[ADDRESS_14667] effort to keep samples and data confidential at all  times.  
However, absolute confidentiality cannot be guaranteed.  There is a slight risk of breach of 
confidentiality  which could be embarrassing or stigmatizing. 
  
B. Potential Benefits  
 No benefit s are guaranteed.  It is hoped that individual patients treated with the DNA vaccine either 
together with, or in sequence with, pembrolizumab will derive a clinical response as suggested by [CONTACT_15278], decline in serum PSA, and/or a prolonged time to disease progression.  While no direct benefit is guaranteed, the results from this trial will guide the direction of future vaccine trials targeting PAP or potentially other antigens for the treatment of prostate cancer, and could suggest means by [CONTACT_15279] -PD-[ADDRESS_14668] demonstrated substantial benefit for patients with other types of malignancies other than prostate cancer.  Thus, it is hoped that study participants and future 
patients  will benefit from research participation in the current study.  
 
 
15. Study Data Management and Procedural Issues  
 
A. Study Enrollment Procedures – Recruitment and Informed Consent Process: 
 
Potentially eligible subjects at the UWCCC site will be patients regularly followed or referred to 
the University of Wisconsin Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15166], and seen in the Medical Oncology, Urology, or Radiation Oncology outpatient clinics at the University of Wi sconsin.  No specific advertisement 
or recruiting tools will be used.  Subjects will be identified by [CONTACT_15280], surgical, or medical oncologist, and informed about this study, alternatives to this study, and the possible risks and benefits.  Potentially eligible subjects will be informed that their decision to participate or not 
participate will in no way affect their ongoing medical care.  Subjects who are interested at that point in obtaining more information will then be introduced to one of the GU research nurses who will then present the study (review rationale, describe time commitment, discuss again possible risks and benefits, and answer procedural  questions) to the subject and provide them with a consent 
form.  In order to allow research subjects time to review the consent form thoroughly with their family and referring or primary physician, the subject will be instructed to take the consent form home without signing.  If the patient wishes to proceed with enrollment, they are then asked to contact [CONTACT_15281] (608) [ADDRESS_14669] which will be generated by [CONTACT_15282].  
 
 
Version 04/06/2021  80 
  
B. Data Collection Procedures  
 
Electronic case report forms (e- CRFs) will be submitted to the UWCCC GU Oncology Office via 
UWCCC’s internal database.  Completion of the e -CRFs will be done in accordance with the 
instructions provided by [CONTACT_15283] a study- specific data capture plan.  The e -CRFs 
are found in the study specific calendar that has been created in the database.  The system will prompt the user to the forms that are required based upon the patient’s enrollment and treatment dates.  
 The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_15167] e-CRFs accurately and within [ADDRESS_14670]. McNeel and stored a minimum of 7 years.   
 Adverse events, clinical responses, and issues related to disease progression are reviewed each week by [CONTACT_15284] (DOWG), attended by [CONTACT_15285], GU malignancy research nurses,  data 
coordinators, and the GU malignancy program manager.  Minutes from these meetings are recorded, and bi -annual reports from this group are submitted to and reviewed by [CONTACT_15286].  All clinical safety, immunological response, and clinical 
response data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_4305], with the University of Wisconsin Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics.  
 All subject research charts will be maintained at individual treatment sites for a mini mum of seven 
years after study completion.  All clinical information maintained in the UWCCC clinical trials database will be stored indefinitely.  All research samples and data derived from these specimens will be maintained indefinitely in the laboratory  of Dr. McNeel .  All information with patient 
identifiers or medical history information will be kept in locked cabinets or secured databases available only to the study personnel to maintain patient confidentiality.    
C. Description of Procedures to Maintain Confidentiality of Research Specimens 
 
All specimens obtained for the immunological evaluation of this trial (blood specimens) will be 
delivered to the laboratory of Dr. McNeel.  Specimens received by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. McNeel’s lab will only be handled by [CONTACT_15287] -
mandated blood- borne pathogen safety training.  Receipt of specimens will be entered into a 
database that will provide a unique code for each specimen.  All stored specimens (sera, peripheral blood mononuclear cells) will be labeled with this unique code and the date of preparation.  Thus, 
all patient identifiers will be removed from the final stored samples, and any data generated will contain only the unique code as identifier.  A database will be  maintained to link individual coded 
specimens with an individual subject (name, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15168], date/time point) in 
 
 
Version 04/06/[ADDRESS_14671]. McNeel’s laboratory , stored in aliquots at –20°C to –80°C.  Peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be stored 
in Dr. McNeel’s laboratory , stored in aliquots in liquid nitrogen. If warranted, samples may be sent 
to an external institution or a contract research organization for the purpose of collaboration and /or analysis.   Subjects will have the option to consent to future research using both their samples and data which may be used independently. Samples remaining after the primary analysis has been completed and available for future research will be “banked” and stored as they were for this study unless they are selected to be sent for research elsewhere, which may be within or outside of the University of Wisconsin. Subjects wishing to withdraw their banked samples will be required to provide written notice to the principal investigator, otherwise their samples may be used indefinitely for cancer research. All research samples and data derived from these specimens will be maintained indefinitely in t he laboratory of Dr. McNeel.  All information with patient identifiers or medical 
history information will be kept in locked cabinets or secured databases available only to the study personnel to maintain patient confidentiality.  
 
D. Modifications of Protocol and Deviations from Protocol 
 
Any changes to the preceding protocol after approval by [CONTACT_15288] a description of specific changes.  All changes must be approved by [CONTACT_15289].  If these changes were related to possible adverse 
events that could potentially affect subject safety, the consent form will also be modified, and submitted with the protocol to the IRB.  After approval, all enrolled subjects will be asked t o 
review and sign the new consent form to proceed with treatment.  If these changes were related to a severe adverse event, or could affect the scientific integrity of the study, the events would also be reviewed internally by [CONTACT_6802], as described above,  and the study could be placed on hold 
pending a protocol and consent form amendment, as described above, or study closure.  In addition, any information that might affect the immediate safety of currently enrolled subjects will be communicated with them directly as well.  
  
Deviations from the study protocol, for reasons other than patient safety, are not permitted.  Any 
possible deviations, intended or not, will be documented in the subjects’ research chart.  Deviations that are unlikely to affect subject safety, such as missing a specific study lab draw, will be documented in the research chart and discussed with the study PI.  Deviations that could potentially affect subject safety, such as missing safety labs, will be documented, performed as soon as 
possible, and reviewed  at the weekly GU clinical research (DOWG) meetings, with prompt 
reporting as soon as any deviation is identified to the IRB if there are concerns for patient safety or scientific integrity of the study.     
 
E. Withdrawal from Study Protocol 
 
Subjects are in formed during the consenting process, and in the consent form, that their 
participation is voluntary and they may withdraw consent at any time and for any reason.  If 
 
 
Version 04/06/2021  82 
 subjects wish to withdraw from the study, they will be asked, but not required, to perform the off -
study procedures/blood draws.  They will be again informed that their decision to participate or 
not participate at any time will not affect their routine medical care or any other benefits to which they were otherwise entitled.  In addition, sub jects will be removed from study participation if 
there is a concern for patient safety, as described above, if they are unable to comply with study procedures, or if the study is terminated by [CONTACT_15290].   
16. Roles and Responsibil ities of Specific Study Personnel at UWCCC  
 
Protocol sponsor: 
 [CONTACT_15300] McNeel  MD PhD, Professor of Medicine, is a genitourinary medical oncologist, with 
a clinical research and laboratory interest in immune -based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_15169].  He has 
served as the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_15170], and has had formalized training in the ethics and conduct of clinical trials and human subjects protection.  He is overall responsible for the design of the trial, interpretation of the protocol as study sponsor , and its laboratory 
analysis, and holds the physician IND for the pTVG -HP DNA vaccine.  Because of his ownership 
interest in the pTVG -HP vaccine that has been licensed by [CONTACT_15291] (Wisconsin Alumni 
Research Foundation, intellectual property manager for the University of Wisconsin) to a company that is seeki ng to commercialize this vaccine (Madison Vaccines, Inc), however, he will not be 
involved in any direct patient care aspects of this trial (recruitment, treatment of subjects on trial, review of imaging studies, or review of clinical laboratories as they pertain to the treatment of individual subjects).     UW Principal Investigator:  
 [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Glenn Liu MD, Associate Professor of Medicine, is a genitourinary medical oncologist with a primary interest in genitourinary cancer clinical trials research. He will serve as principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_15171] a clinical co -investigator for this study, involved in 
the recruitment, treatment and review of individual treated subjects, and will also oversee all UW/IRB aspects related to direct patient c are issues.

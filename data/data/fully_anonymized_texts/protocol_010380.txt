General Design and Methodology: This is a 16 -week, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
parallel-group study to compare the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of 2 dose regimens of TEV -[ZIP_CODE] and placebo.
After completing the informed consent process (screening visit [visit 1]), eligible patients will enter a baseline, 
28-day run-in period. Headache information will be captured daily during the entire study using an electronic 
headache diary device. Patients shouldnot beusing concomitant preventive migraine medication s(presented in 
Appendix B)at the time of the screening visitandwill not be allow ed to initiate these medications after study start. 
A small subgroup of patients(approximately 30%) will be allow ed to use concomitant migraine preventive 
medications(presented in Appendix A), andno changes in these medications will be allowed throughout the study 
(ie, from the screening visit through completion of the last study assessments). Patients will be allow ed to use acute 
medications to treat acute migraine attacks,as needed.
Patients will return to the study center after completing the 28 -day run-in period on day 0 (visit 2). Those patients 
who have confirmed CM and meet all other eligibility criteria (including electronic headache diary compliance 
criteria during the 28-day run-in period) will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment groups:
sc administration of 675 mg of TEV -[ZIP_CODE] at visit 2 followed by [CONTACT_127632]- [ZIP_CODE] at 225 mg
sc administration of 675 mg of TEV -[ZIP_CODE] at visit 2 followed by [CONTACT_72533] 
monthly sc administration of placebo
Randomization will be performed using electronic interactive response technology (IRT). Patients will be stratified 
based on gender , country, and baseline preventive migraine medication use (yes, no) to ensure balance for the 
covariates (treatment group, preventive medication use, country, and gender).
Placebo-Controlled Study –Chronic Migraine
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125-CNS-[ZIP_CODE]
14Blinded treatm ent will be administered sc once monthly (approximately every 4 weeks) for a total of [ADDRESS_555077] 
treatment administration will occur at visit 2 (day 0), and additional doses will be administered at visits 3 and 4. 
Final study assessments will be perf ormed at visit 5 (end -of-treatment [EOT] visit), approximately 4weeksafter 
administration of the 3rdand final dose of study drug. Upon completion of the final study assessments, patients may 
enter adouble-blind,long-term safety and efficacy study (Stu dyTV48125 -CNS-[ZIP_CODE]), consisting of a 12 -month 
double-blind treatment period and a 6.5 -month follow -up period. In the long -term safety extension study, p atients 
receiving active study drug in the current study will continue receiving the same treatment (i e,monthly sc 
TEV-[ZIP_CODE] at 225 mg or quarterly sc TEV -[ZIP_CODE] at 675 mg), and patients receiving placebo in the current study 
will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a loading dose of sc TEV -[ZIP_CODE] at 675 mg followed by [CONTACT_438040]-[ZIP_CODE] at 225 mg or quarterly sc TEV -[ZIP_CODE] at 675 mg during the long -term safety and efficacy study. Patients 
who do not enroll in the long -term safety and efficacy study for any reason will be offered to enter the long -term 
safety extension for the purpose of evaluating ADA approximately 7.5 months (225 days[the approximate 
equivalent of 5 half -lives]) after receiving the last (3rd) dose of study drug in this study .
Methodof Blinding and Randomization: The sponsor, investigators, study staff (except for staff involved in 
bioanalytical analyses), and patients will be blinded to treatment assignment. A computer -generated master 
randomization list will be provided to drug packaging facilities. Packaging vendor(s) w ill package active and 
placebo into single- visit kits according to Good Manufacturing Practice procedures. Kits will be identical in 
appearance and contain 1 prefilled syringe with active drug or placebo. Adequate kit supply for upcoming study 
visits will be managed by [CONTACT_142905] (refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C ) on site.
This is a randomized study with stratification based on gender , country, and baseline preventive medication use (yes, 
no). Each patient will undergo randomization in a 1:1:1 ratio within the stratum to which he or she belongs to 
receive 1 of the 2 TEV-[ZIP_CODE] dose regimens or placebo, as assigned by [CONTACT_6606]. The IRT will manage initial drug 
supply, maintenance of adequate study drug supplies on site, and study randomization centrally. At the time of each 
study visit, the IRT w ill be queried, and site person nel will retrieve and administer a 1.5 -mL volume from each 
syringe contained in the appropriately numbered kit (s).
The total number of patients receiving concomitant preventive medication during the study will not exceed 30% of 
the total sample size of the study.
Study Drug Dose, Mode of Administration, and Administration Rate: Prefilled syringes (active or placebo) w ill 
be contained in uniquely numbered kits and stored (refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C ) on site. Active syringes will contain 
150 mg/mL of TEV -[ZIP_CODE], and placebo syringes will contain the same vehicle and excipi[INVESTIGATOR_72424]. Each kit will contain 1 prefilled syringe. 
Study drug will be administered by [CONTACT_72498] 4 weeks(28 days)
for a total of 3 doses as follows:
Patients randomized to receive TEV -[ZIP_CODE] 675/225 /225mg will receive 675 mg of TEV- [ZIP_CODE] as 
3active injections (225 mg/1.5 mL) at visit 2 and 225 mg of TEV -[ZIP_CODE] as 1 active injection 
(225mg/1.5 mL) at visits 3 and 4. 
Patients randomized to receive TEV -[ZIP_CODE] 675 mg/placebo /placebowill receive 675 mg of 
TEV-[ZIP_CODE] as 3 active injections (225 mg/1.5 mL) at visit 2 and placebo as asingle 1.5 -mL injection 
at visits 3 and 4. 
Patients randomized to receive TEV -[ZIP_CODE] placebo will receive three 1.5 -mL placebo injections at 
visit 2 and asingle 1.5 -mL placebo injection at visits 3 and 4.

15The recommended sc injection sites follow the National Institutes of Health Patient Education Guidelines of 
June2012, which are availab le inAppendix Cand at http://www.cc.nih.gov/ccc/patient_education/pepubs/subq.pdf. 
The suggested sites of injection are back of upper arms, lower abdomen/belly/waistline, and front of thighs. Each of 
the injections at visit 2 should be given in a different location (eg, not in precisely the same place), and study staff 
member(s) responsible for administration of injections should inspect previous injection sites to ensure that they are 
free of bruising and tende rness and that proper rotation of sites is performed.
The total number of sc injections and their locations will be recorded for each dosing visit (visits 2, 3, and 4). A

Measures and Time Points: 
Primary Efficacy Measure and Time Point: The primary efficacy endpoint for this study will be derived from 
headache data (ie,occurrence of headache , duration of headache, maximumseverityof headache ,and acute
migraine-specificmedication use) collected daily using an electronic headache diary device. 
Eligible patients will receive training on the use of the electronic headache diary device and w ill be informed of 
compliance requirements at screening. Patients will complete elect ronic headache diary entries with questions 
about the previous day daily, beginning on day –27(the day after the screening visit) through the EOT/early 
withdrawal visit. The electronic headache diary device will allow  entry of headache information for up to 
48hours after a given day.
Secondary Efficacy Measures and Time Points: Secondary efficacy endpoints will be derived from headache 
data (ie, occurrence of headache , duration of headache, maximum severityof headache, and acute
migraine-specificmedication use) collected daily using an electronic headache diary device. In addition, 
migraine-related disability will be assessed using the HIT -6 completed at time points specified in Table1.
Exploratory Efficacy Measu res and Time Points: The following exploratory efficacy measures will be
assessed at time points specified in Table 1: 
exploratory efficacy endpoints derived from headache data (ie, occurrence of headache , duration of 
headache,maximumseverityof headache , and acute migraine-specificmedication use), which are 
collected daily using an electronic headache diary device

electronic Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( eC-SSRS)
Pharmacokinetics/Biomarkers/Immunogenicity Measures and Time Points:
Pharmacokinetic Measures and Time Points : Blood samples for pharmacokinetics an alysis of TEV -[ZIP_CODE] will 
be collected from all patients at the time points specified in Table 1for the purpose of 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship assessment. The pharmacodynamic parameters will be the 
efficacy responses. The actual date and time of each blood sample, as well as the date and time of the last study 
drug dose prior to each sample, w ill be recorded in the case report form.
TEV-[ZIP_CODE] plasma concentration will be measured using a validated as say. 
Immunogenicity Measures and Time Points : Blood samples for immunogenicity will be collected at time points 
specified in Table1.
Biomarker Measures and Time Points : Biomarker blood and urine samples will be co llected from all patients at 
time points specified in Table1, and a blood sample will be collected from patients who consent to 
pharmacogen omicassessment at visit2or any visit thereafter . 
Allowed and Disallowed Medications Before and During the Study:
Prior Medications and Therapeutic Failures of Migraine Preventives : Details regarding excluded prior migraine 
preventive treatments and therapeutic failures of migraine preventives are described in the exclusion cr iteria.
Concomitant (Current) Therapy: Up to 30% of p atients will be allow ed to remain on stable doses of no more than 
1preventive migraine medication for the duration of the study provided the medication has at least moderate 
evidence of efficacy as defined by [CONTACT_21401] ( Silberstein et al 2012 )and presented in Appendix A. Patients on 
preventive medication must be on a stable dose for at least [ADDRESS_555088] be recorded w ith indication, daily dose, and start and stop 
dates of administration. All patients will be questioned about concomitant medication at each visit.
Statistical Considerations:
Sample Size Rationale: In a Phase 2b study in CM patients, a treatment difference of 1.[ADDRESS_555089] moderate severity between the TEV -[ZIP_CODE] 675/225/225 mg and placebo treatment groups 
was observed. A sample size of 867 patients (ie, 289 evaluable p atients completing the study per treatment group) 
gives at least 90% pow er for the study to succeed ( assuming a common standard deviation [SD] of 6.29days) at an 
alpha level of 0.05. Assuming a 15% discontinuation rate, 340 patients per treatment group wi ll be randomized.
Placebo-Controlled Study –Chronic Migraine
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125-CNS-[ZIP_CODE]
20Efficacy Analysis: Individuals with CM often complain of continuous levels of very low severity headache, which 
is typi[INVESTIGATOR_127577]. Accordingly, and following Classification Committee 
of the International Headache Society (IHS) (Silberstein et al 2008 )guidelines, headache days of at least moderate 
severity will be defined for the purpose of this study as a calendar day (00:00 to 23:59) w here the pati ent reports:
a day with headache pain that lasts ≥[ADDRESS_555090] moderate severity
or
a day when the patient used acute migraine -specific medication (triptans or ergots) to treat a headache 
of any severity or duration
Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint : The primary efficacy endpoint, the m ean change from baseline (28-day 
run-in period) in themonthly averagenumber of headache days of at least moderate severity during the [ADDRESS_555091] squares mean differences between each TEV -[ZIP_CODE] group and 
the placebo group. The primary comparison is between the monthly TEV -[ZIP_CODE] dose and placebo.
Analysis of S econdary and Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints : The same analysis used for the primary efficacy 
endpoint will be performed for the continuous secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints . For the proportion of 
responders defined as 50% or more reduction from baseline in the monthly average headache days of at least 
moderate severity, Cochran -Mantel-Haenszel test will be used.
Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity : A fixed-sequence (hierarchical) testing procedure will be implemented to 
control the type 1 errorrate at 0.05. The sequence of comparisons will be described in detail in the statistical 
analysis plan .
Safety and Tolerability Analyses : All adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities. Each patient will be counted only once in each preferred term or system organ class category for the 
analyses of safety. Summaries w ill be presented for all adverse events (overall and by [CONTACT_926]), adverse events 
determined by [CONTACT_7185] (defined as related or w ith missing relationship) (overall 
and by [CONTACT_926]), serious adverse events, and adverse events causing withdraw al from the study. Patient listings of 
serious adverse events and adverse events leading to withdraw al will be presented.
Local tolerability findings will be listed and summarized descriptively.
Changes in laboratory and vital signs measurement data will be summarized descriptively. All values will be 
compared with prespecified boundaries to identify potentially clinically significant changes or values, and such 
values will be listed.
The use of concomitant medications will be summarized by [CONTACT_23507]. 
Concomitant medications will include all medications taken while the patient is treated with study drug.
Safety data will be summarized descriptively overall and by [CONTACT_1570]. For continuous variables, descriptive 
statistics ( number, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum) will be provided for actual values and changes 
from baseline to each time p oint. For categorical variables, patient counts and percentages will be provided. 
Descriptive summaries of serious adverse events, patient withdraw als due to adverse events, and potentially 
clinically significant abnormal values (clinical laboratory or vit al signs) based on predefined criteria will also be 
provided.

21If any patient dies during the study, a listing of deaths will be provided, and all relevant information will be 
discussed in the patient narrative included in the clinical study report.
Pharmacokinetic Analysis: Pharmacokinetic plasma concentration results (TEV -[ZIP_CODE]) will be tabulated 
descriptively at each planned sampling time point by [CONTACT_1570].
Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analysis: The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship w ill be 
estimated by [CONTACT_65935]. The pharmacokinetic parameters will be based on TEV -[ZIP_CODE] 
measurements. The pharmacodynamic will be the efficacy responses. 
The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship will be estimated using the most app ropriate model after 
comparing different candidate models for their quality of fit. Covariates that may affect the 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship will be tested for inclusion in the model. This analysis will be 
reported separately.
Immunogeni city Analysis: Summary of immunogenicity results will be provided, and the incidence of 
immunogenicity will be calculated. The impact of immunogenicity on the pharmacokinetic profile, drug efficacy, 
and clinical safety will be evaluated. This impact analysis will be reported separately.

331. BACKGROUND I NFORMATION
1.1. Introduction 
Migraine is a prevalent condition characterized by [CONTACT_72506] s ymptoms 
(such as nausea, photophobia, or phonophobia). The [ADDRESS_555104] common forms of migraine, 
migraine without aura and migraine with aura, occur on less than 15 days per month and are 
referred to as epi[INVESTIGATOR_72431] (ie, EM) ( Lipton et al 2007 ). However, approximately  
3% of individuals with EM evolve, in an y given year, to a significantly more disabling condition 
called chronic migraine ( CM)(Bigal et al 2008, Lipton et al 2007 , Scher et al 2003 ). Individuals 
with CM present with headaches of an y severity on [ADDRESS_555105] 8 day s per month (Classification Committee of the International 
Headache Societ y [IHS], 2013). A sizable proportion of individuals with CM experience s daily 
headaches and, therefore, face sconsiderable disability  (Bigal and L ipton 2008 ). 
The pathoph ysiology of migraine involves central and peripheral events. Activation of structures 
in the brainstem are involved in t he modulation of sensory  activity, which is impaired during 
migraine attacks. Chronic dysfunction in these structures predisposes migraineurs not only  to 
migraine attacks, but to increased headache frequency  (Goadsby [CONTACT_72507] 2008 ). 
Furthermore, the activation of these structures is also associated with inflammation and protein 
extravasation at the level of the meningeal blood vessels, muscles and other structures innervated 
by [CONTACT_72508]. This co mbination of peripheral insults (inflammation and plasma protein 
extravasation) with impairment of the inhibitory  pain mechanisms at the level of brainstem is 
paramount to frequent migraines ( Goadsby [CONTACT_2297] 2002). 
Calcitonin gene -related peptide (CGRP) is a well -studied neuropeptide found at the centers of 
the migraine processes, both centrall y and peripherally ( Eftekhari and Edvinsson 2010 ). Its role 
in migraine pathophy siology was suggested more than 20 y ears ago ( Edvinsson and Goadsby  
1990,Goadsby [CONTACT_2297]1990). Jugular levels of CGRP are increased during migraine attacks, and 
intravenous ( iv)CGRP administration induces migraine -like headache in most individuals with 
migraine ( Ashina et al 2000, Hansen et al 2010 ). Calcitonin gene -related peptide is therefore 
involved in the pathophysiology  of migraine at all levels, peripherally  (vasodilation, 
inflammation and protein extravasation), at the trigeminal ganglion, and inside the brain ( Ho et al 
2010). Inhibition of CGRP has demonst rated efficacy  in the treatment of EM ( Hewitt et al 2011 ,
Ho et al 2008 , Olesen et al 2004 ).
The goals of migraine treatment are to relie ve pain, restore function, reduce headache frequency , 
and to prevent progression of EM to CM. Pharmacological interventions for the treatment of 
migraine include acute (symptomatic) treatments and daily preventive medications. The latter is
indicated for patients with CM and may be appropriate patients with EM who have significant 
disability with migraine attacks (>3 days per month with headache -related disability ), 
contraindications to triptans or other vasoactive medications, significant adverse effects from
triptans, and patients with severe or prolonged attacks (Lipton and Silberstein 2015 ). Currentl y 
available drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_438009], 
beta-blockers, triptans, antidepressants, angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting 
enzymeinhibitors, serotonergic agents, calcium channel blockers, nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory  drugs, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], and direct vascular smooth muscle relaxants. Although there

Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125-CNS-[ZIP_CODE]
34are more tha n 40 medications within these classes of drugs that are used with vary ing response 
rates to prevent migraine, only 5 marketed drugs are approved b y the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) in the [LOCATION_002] (US) for the preventive treatment of migraine; 4 of 
them are approved for the proph ylaxis of migraine: propranolol, timolol maleate, divalproex 
sodium, and topi[INVESTIGATOR_052]. The clinical studies(Brandes et al 2004 , Klapper 1997 , Mathew et al 
1995, Nadelmann et al 1986 , Silberstein et al 2004 ) that supported registration of these drugs for 
this indication were cond ucted before the establishment of CM as a single entity and generall y 
included patients with headaches on less than 15 day s per month. Only 1medication, 
onabotulinumtoxinA, is approved for proph ylaxis of CM ( Lipton and Silberstein 2015).
TEV-[ZIP_CODE] (also known as PF -04427429, RN307, or LBR- 101) is a fully  humanized 
immunoglobulin G ( IgG) 2a/kappa monoclonal antibody derived from a murine precursor. 
TEV-[ZIP_CODE] is a potent, selective CGRP binder and blocks both CGR P isoforms (α -and 
β-CGRP) from binding to the CGRP receptor. TEV -[ZIP_CODE] is specific for CGRP and does not 
bind to the closely  related family  members am ylin, calcitonin, or adrenomedullin peptides. Two 
mutations were introduced into the constant region of the TEV-[ZIP_CODE] heavy chain to limit 
antibody effector functions. This loss of function prevents TEV- [ZIP_CODE] from stimulating 
antibody-dependent cell mediated cy totoxicity  and triggering complement -mediated ly sis; these 
activities can lead to unwanted consequences such as cell ly sis, opsonization, and cy tokine 
release and inflammation ( Armour et al 1999, Zeller et al 2008 ).
The pharmacokinetics and tolerability  of TEV-[ZIP_CODE](iv doses ranging from 0.2 to 2000 mg and 
subcutaneous [ sc]doses of 225 mg and 900 mg) has been well -characterized in the Phase 1 
development program (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). Furthermore, the safet y and effectiveness of 
TEV-[ZIP_CODE] has been demonstrated in a randomized double -blind, placebo controlled Phase 2 
study of 2 sc dosing regimens of TEV -[ZIP_CODE] (monthly TEV-[ZIP_CODE] at 900 mg or TEV -[ZIP_CODE] at 
675 mg followed b y monthly TEV-[ZIP_CODE] at 225 mg) in patients with CM and a randomized, 
double-blind, placebo -controlled Phase 2 study  of 2 sc dosing regimens of TEV -[ZIP_CODE](monthly 
TEV-[ZIP_CODE] at 675 or 225 mg) in patients with EM (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) . The acceptable 
tolerability, longterminalelimination half-life (t½, approximately  45 days) and ability  to 
administer sc make TEV -[ADDRESS_555106]
TEV-[ZIP_CODE] (formerl y LBR-101, PF-04427429, or RN307) is a full y humanized IgG2a/k appa 
monoclonal antibody  derived from a murine precursor. TEV -[ADDRESS_555107] is given in Section 3.9. 
1.3. Findings from Nonclinical and Clinical Studies
1.3.1. Nonclinical Studies
In vivo pharmacology  studies of TEV -[ZIP_CODE] in animal models indicate that TEV -[ZIP_CODE] 
prevented an increase in blood flow in rat paw skin and the middle meningeal artery  after 
electrical stimulation and produced a dose- dependent inhibition of the capsaicin -induced skin 
flare response in cy nomolgus monkey .
Placebo-Controlled Study –Chronic Migraine
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125-CNS-[ZIP_CODE]
35Safety pharmacology  parameters of TEV- [ZIP_CODE] were assessed in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_72433] s and a separate cardiovascular safet y 
pharmacology  study in male cy nomolgus monkey s. There were no treatment -related changes in 
electrocardiograms (ECGs) and heart rates in the 1 -and 3-month toxicity  studies, and a single iv 
dose of TEV -[ZIP_CODE] at 100 mg/kg did not result in changes in cardiovascular parameters or body  
temperature in monkey s. Additionally , no target organ toxicity  was identified. I n these 
referenced studies, the no -observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) ranged from 100 to 
300mg/kg dosed either iv or sc. In a 3 -month monkey  study, perivascular inflammation of the 
ciliary artery was observed in a few animals at doses ≥100mg/kg. The inflammation was 
suspected to be the result of immune complex formation/deposition from the monkey s’ 
immunogenic response to the drug (TEV- [ZIP_CODE]). In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735] 6-month chronic toxicity  study in 
monkeys following once -weekly sc dosing at dosage levels of up to 300 mg/kg/week, achieving 
high exposure throughout the study , no microscopic findings were noted in any  of theorgans, 
including the ciliaryvessels of the ey es, and the NOAEL of the chronic toxicity  study was 
determined to be the high estdose tested, 300 mg/kg/week. Thus, it is believed that in view of the 
low frequency  (ie,observed in very  few animals) and mini mal severity , the finding (perivascular 
inflammation) thatwas only recorded in the 3- month toxicity  study, and had been resolved 
during the recovery  period, is an incidental finding. 
The pharmacokinetics of TEV -[ZIP_CODE] in animals (rats and monkey s) is typi[INVESTIGATOR_12340] a humanized 
IgG2 molecule, with low mean plasma clearance, low volume of distribution at stead y state, and 
a long t ½. Exposure as defined by  [CONTACT_72509] (C max) and 
the area under the plasma concentration- time curveincreased linearly  across doses following 
single and repeated once -weekly dosing. No gender differences in exposure were observed in 
rats or monkey s.
Additionally , pi[INVESTIGATOR_72434]-[ADDRESS_555108] that weekl y dosing with 
TEV-[ZIP_CODE] was well tolerated and did not induce any  obvious maternal toxicity  at any dose 
level. No apparent evidence of embry o-fetaltoxicity was noted in an y dose group.
Overall, no toxicological concerns were identifi ed following up to 6 months of dosing to the 
experimental animals.
Further details may be found in the current Investigator’s Brochure. 
1.3.2. Clinical Studies
To date, TEV -[ZIP_CODE] has been studied in 6 Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers and 
2Phase2bstudies in migrai ne patients. In total, 48 4subjects (118 healthy volunteers and 
366 migraine patients) received at least 1 dose of TEV- [ZIP_CODE] via iv or sc administration.
A brief summary  of clinical pharmacology  and clinical safety and efficacy  studies of TEV -[ZIP_CODE] 
follows. Further details may be found in the current Investigator’s Brochure. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Pharmacology Studies
A total of [ADDRESS_555109] 1 dose of TEV-[ZIP_CODE] across 6 completed Phase 1 studies
atdoses ranging from 0.2 through 2000 mg. Studies included 2 single-dose-escalation 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacod ynamic studies in healthy  men (Studies B0141001 and
Placebo-Controlled Study –Chronic Migraine
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125-CNS-[ZIP_CODE]
36B0141002); a 2 -cohort, placebo -controlled ,cross-over study  to examine the acute effects 
administration of TEV -[ZIP_CODE] on capsaicin flare re sponse in health y men(Study B0141006); a 
parallel-group, repeat -dose study  of TEV-[ZIP_CODE] in healthy men and women (Study B0141007); 
a single-dose study  evaluating the safety, tolerability ,and pharmacokinetics of doses up to 
2000mg administered to healthy women ( Study LBR-101-008); and a single-dose study
comparing the safety, tolerability, absolute bioavailability , and pharmacokinetics if sc and iv 
TEV-[ZIP_CODE] in healthy men and women ( StudyLBR-101-011).
Based on noncompartmental anal ysis,TEV-[ZIP_CODE] exposure increases with dose in an 
approximately dose-proportional manner from 225 to 900 mg following sc administration and 
over the dose range from 100 to 2000 mg following iv infusion. The Cmaxoccurred near the end 
oftheiv infusion (median time to C max[tmax]of 1 to 5hours after the start of the infusion), and 
Cmaxwasprolonged as indicated b y the delay ed tmax(median t max96to 108 hours postdose) after 
scadministration. The mean t½following sc administration was similar to that observed after iv
administration for each dose level. Thet½ranged from approximately  642 to 770 hours 
(approximately  27 to 32 days)at the 225 -mg dose level, andt ½ranged from approximately  
1140to 1200 hours (approximately  48 to 50 days)at the 900 -mg dose level . Absolute 
bioavailability  of the sc dose was approximately  55%.
TEV-[ZIP_CODE] was well tolerated with favorable safety  profile.The treatment -emergent adverse 
events reported in the Phase 1 studies were predominantly  mild to mod erate in severit y. A
specific “pattern of adverse events” that could be associated with a do se or a dose range of 
TEV-48125has not been identified, nor has a maximally  tolerated dose been identified. The 
most common treatment -emergent adverse events reported were headache, nasophary ngitis, 
gastroente ritis, and back pain. There were no deaths . One serious adverse event reported as 
"thoracic aortic aneury sm aggravated" in a n individual receiving a single iv 300 -mg TEV-[ZIP_CODE] 
doseresolved.
TEV-[ZIP_CODE] does not appear to be associated with any  clinically  relevant patterns of change in 
vital signs (s ystolic and diastolic blood pressure, temperature and heart rate) or cardiac 
conduction and repolarization (P -R interval, QT interval corrected for heart rate using Ba zett’s
and Fridericia’s formulas) measured b y frequent 12 -lead ECGs. No changes in liver function 
tests (aspartate aminotransferase [ AST], alanine aminotransferase [ ALT], total bilirubin, and 
alkaline phosphatase [ALP]) ordifferences between TEV-[ZIP_CODE] andplacebo in hematological 
parameters, tests assessing renal function, electroly tes, or urinal ysis has been observed in any  of 
the Phase 1 studies.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Clinical Safety and Efficacy Studies
The safety, tolerability , and efficacy  of TEV-[ADDRESS_555110] study  was a multicenter, randomized, double- blind, 
placebo-controlled, pa rallel-group study  comparing the efficacy , safety, tolerability , and 
pharmacokinetics of 2doses of TEV -[ZIP_CODE] with placebo in 264 patients withCM
(StudyLBR-101-021). Following a 28- day run-in period, participants were randomized and 
treated sconce monthl y for 3months. One active group received a first dose of 675 mg followed 
by 225mg on the subsequent 2 months. The otheractive groupreceived 900 mg per month. The 
mean change in headache hours relative to baseline for each TEV -[ZIP_CODE] dose arm w as
significantl y different from the placebo arm at 3 months (primary  endpoint), and the stud y was

Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125-CNS-[ZIP_CODE]
37also positive at 2 and 1 months.Both doses we re also superior to placebo for the secondary  
endpoint (decrease in the number of day s with moderate or severe headache at 3 months). At the 
doses tested, TEV -[ADDRESS_555111] adv erse event s were mild to moderate. No safet y signals were observed in 
the clinical laboratory  tests, vital signs, phy sical examination, or ECGs. 
The second stud y was a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
parallel-group stud y comparingthe efficacy, safety, tolerability , and pharmacokinetics of 2 doses 
of TEV-[ZIP_CODE] with placebo in 297 patients with EM ( Study LBR-101-022). Following a 28- day 
run-in period, participants were randomized and treated sconce monthl y for 3months. Two 
active doses were tested, 225 mg given monthly  for 3 months and 675mg given monthly  for 
3months. The mean change in number of migraine day s at month 3 relative to baseline for both 
TEV-[ZIP_CODE] dose arms was significantly  different from placebo at 3(primary endpoint), 2, and 
1months. Secondary and exploratory  endpoints were also positive for the duration of the study . 
Both doses were well tolerated ,and no serious treatment- related adverse events were reported. 
Most adverse event s were mild to moderate and the lowest dose had a numericall y lower number 
of adverse events relatively  to placebo. No safet y signals were observed in the clinical laboratory 
tests, vital signs, phy sical examination, or ECGs.
1.4. Known and Potential Risks and Benefits to Human Patients
1.4.1. Known and Potential Risks and Benefits ofTEV-[ZIP_CODE]
Information regarding risks and benefits of TEV-[ZIP_CODE] to human patients may  be found in the 
current Investigator’s Brochure .
[IP_ADDRESS]. Risks of TEV-[ZIP_CODE]
Identified risks (adverse drug reactions) of TEV-[ZIP_CODE] include injection site ery thema, 
administration site pain, injection site pain, injection site pruritus, injection site dermatitis,
infusion-relatedreaction, and drug h
ypersensitivity .None of the identified risks are considered 
important risks.
Potential risks f or TEV-[ZIP_CODE] are perivascular inflammation; development of antidrug 
antibodies (ADAs); liver enzy me elevations; andcardiovascular consequences of C GRP
inhibition, including effects on blood pressure, heart rate ,orother cardiovascular parameters.
As described in Section [IP_ADDRESS], sc TEV -[ZIP_CODE] has generall y been well tolerated over the ranges 
of doses evaluated (single doses of 0.02 to 2 000 mg in healthy  volunteers, multiple doses of 
30to 300 mg in health y volunteers, and multiple doses of 225 to 900 mg in migraine patients).
The most common treatment -emergent adverse events were mild to moderate transient general 
administration site disorders/reactions . Other commonly  reported treatment- emergent adverse 
events we re headache, back pain, and upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_2826] .
[IP_ADDRESS]. Benefits of TEV-[ZIP_CODE]
As described in Section [IP_ADDRESS], results from Phase [ADDRESS_555112] demonstrated 
statistically significant reduction s in mean headache hours after 1, 2, and 3 months of 
TEV-[ZIP_CODE] treatment in patients with CM and statistically  significant reductions in monthly  
Placebo-Controlled Study –Chronic Migraine
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125-CNS-[ZIP_CODE]
38migraine days after 1, 2, and 3 months of TEV-[ZIP_CODE] treatment in patients with EM .Results for 
several secondary /exploratory  endpoints also showed TEV -[ZIP_CODE] to be superior to placebo.
1.4.2. Overall Risk and Benefit Assessment for t his Study
Based on the current safety  profileand the demonstrated efficacy ofthe scTEV-48125dosage 
form, the overall risk and benefit assessm ent for this study  is favorable.
1.5. Selection of Drugs and Dosages
A detailed description of study  drug administration is presented in Section 5.1.
1.5.1. Justification for Dosage of Active Drug
The TEV-[ZIP_CODE] doses and dos ing regimens to be evaluated in this double -blind study  were 
selected on the basis of animal pharmacod ynamic and pharmacokinetic data, 
6pharmacokinetic/safet y studies in healthy  volunteers, 2 safety/efficacy studies in patients with 
migraine, and population pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic/pharmacody namic modeling and 
simulations.
The pharmacod ynamics of TEV -[ZIP_CODE] were examined in animal models by  [CONTACT_72510]-[ZIP_CODE] to block CGRP functions in vivo(see Section1.3.1). Specificall y,
neurogenic vasodilation by  [CONTACT_72511] a 
CGRP-mediated increase in vasodilatation or skin blood flow in cy nomolgus monkey s. In this 
study, TEV-[ZIP_CODE] (dosed as a singl e iv bolus at 1, 10, or 100 mg/kg) produced a dose -dependent 
inhibition of the capsaicin -induced skin flare response. The magnitude and duration of the 
inhibition produced by  [CONTACT_72512]-[ZIP_CODE] were dose -dependent, with the 10 and 100 mg/kg doses 
showing inhibition out to [ADDRESS_555113] dose with potential for effectiveness. Since the 225 -mg dose would not reach 
steady state during the 3 -month Phase 2b efficacy  study in patients with CM 
(StudyLBR-101-021), a loading dose of 675 mg was utilized to mimic a concentration that was 
similar to what would b e reached during stead y state.
In Study LBR-101-021, patients in the active treatment groups received either a loading dose of 
TEV-[ZIP_CODE] at 675 mg followed by  [CONTACT_72512]-[ZIP_CODE] at 225 mg on the subsequent 2 months or 
TEV-[ZIP_CODE] at 900 mg administered monthly  for 3 months. The results of this study  showed both 
selected doses to be effective, safe, and well tolerated by  [CONTACT_438041] (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).The 
mean change in headache hours relative to baseline for both TEV- [ZIP_CODE] dose arms was 
significantl y different from the placebo arm at 3 months (primary  endpoint), but the study  was 
also strikingly  positive at [ADDRESS_555114] the lower 
dose for administration when 2doses are equivalent, a loading dose of TEV-481 25 at 675 mg 
followed b y TEV-[ZIP_CODE] at 225 mg dose monthl y was selected as the treatment for 1 of the active 
treatment groups in this Phase3 study in patients wit h CM.The intent of this dose and schedule 
is to preserve the speed of efficacy , a very important and clinically  relevant attribute in CM 
therapy, while avoiding a higher dose than is necessary. A 2ndactive treatment group will receive 
Placebo-Controlled Study –Chronic Migraine
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125-CNS-[ZIP_CODE]
39TEV-[ZIP_CODE] at 675 mg quarterly to examine the potential for loss of efficacy within a 3 -month 
treatment period following a single sc administration. 
1.5.2. Justification for Use of Placebo
A placebo -controlled design is appropriate given the purpose and objectives of this clinical 
study. Inclusion of a placebo control group is consistent with guidelines for controlled trial s of 
prophylactic treatment of CM in adults ( Silberstein et al 2008 ) and the Classification Committee 
of the IHSguidelines for controlled trials of drugs in migraine, 3rdedition (Tfelt-Hansenetal 
2012).

1.7. Population to be Studied and Justification
The study  population will be composed of f emale and male patients , aged18 to 70years,
inclusive, with a history of migraine for at least 1 2 months and CM(as defined by  [CONTACT_438043], 3rdrevision [I CHD-3] criteria [ Classification Committee 
of the IHS,2013])prospectivel ydocumented via a review of headache data recorded daily 
during a 28- day run-in period in an electronic headache diary  device. 
Because headache consortium guidelines recommend preventive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_438011] , patients using no more than 
1preventive medication at the time of study enrollment will be allowed to remain on the 
Placebo-Controlled Study –Chronic Migraine
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_555115] moderate evidence of efficacy  for migraine (Silberstein 
et al 2012 ). Patients must be on a stable dose and regimen of the preventive medication for at 
least 2months prior to study  entry (ie, before the run -in period), and they  cannot change the dose 
and regimen during the stu dy. The total number of patients receiving concomitant preventive 
medication during the study will not exceed 30% of the total sample size of the study .
Patients with CM have significant disability despi[INVESTIGATOR_438012]
(approved and off label) and non-pharmacological treatments. The persistence of CM-associated 
disability likely reflects variable response rates , adverse effects of available preventive 
treatments , and the paucity  of approved preventive treatments( Lipton and Silberstein 2015, 
Shamiliyan et al 2013).
1.8. Location and Timing of Study 
This study  is planned to be conducted in approximately  15countries, including North and South 
America, the EU, and Asia Pacific, at approximately 140centers. It is expected to start in 
1Q2016and have a duration of approximately  21 months. Additional centers will be added, if 
needed. Expected duration of the study  may also be extended dependent on enrollm ent speed and 
other factors.

483. STUDY DESIGN
3.1. General Design and Study Schema
This is a 16- week, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled, parallel -group 
study to compare the safety , tolerabilit y, and efficacy of 2 dose regimens of sc TEV-[ZIP_CODE] and 
placebo in adults with CM. The study consists of a screening visit, a 28-day run-in period, and a 
12-week (84- day) treatment per iod,including a final evaluation at week 12 (end-of-treatment 
[EOT] visit, approximately  4 weeks [28 day s] after the final dose of study  drug).
This study  will include female and male patients ,aged [ADDRESS_555133] 12 months and CM(as defined by  [CONTACT_25420]-3 criteria [ Classification 
Committee of the I HS,2013]). The diagnosis will be prospectivel y confirmed via a review of 
headache data recorded daily during a [ADDRESS_555134] moderate evidence of efficacy  
for migraine (Silberstein et al 2012). Patients shouldnot beusing concomitant preventive 
migraine medication s(presented in Appendix B)at the time of the screening visit, andwill not 
be allowed to initiate these medications after study  start. A small subgroup of patients 
(approximately  30%) will be allowed to use concomitant migraine preventive medications 
(presented in Appendix A), andno changes in these medications will be allowed until the last 
study assessments are complete. Patients will be allowed to use acute medications to treat acute 
migraine attacks , as needed.
After completing the informed consent process (screening visit [visit 1]), patients will be 
screened for eligibility . Eligible patients will enter a 28- day run-inperiod. Headache information 
will be captured daily  throughout study  participation using the electronic headache diary device. 
After completing the run -in period, patients will be asked to return to the study  center on day  0 
(visit2). Patientswho have confirmed CM and meet all other eligibility  criteria(including
electronic headache diary compliance criteria during the 28 -day run-in period)willbe random ly 
assignedin a1:1:1ratio to 1 of 3treatment groups:
sc administration of 675 mg of TEV-48125at visit 2followed by  [CONTACT_438051]-[ZIP_CODE] at 225 mg 
sc administration of 675 mg of TEV-48125at visit 2followed by  [CONTACT_72476] 
monthly scadministration of placebo
(Note: For this stud y, monthly dosing refers to dosing approximately every 4 weeks[28days].)
Randomization will be performed using electronic interactive response technology (IRT). 
Patients will be stratified based on gender, country, and baseline prev entive migraine medication 
use (yes,no)to ensure balance for the covariates ( treatment group, preventive migraine 
medication use, country,and gender).The total number of patients receiving concomitant 
preventive medication during the stud y will not exc eed 30% of the total sample size of the study .
Placebo-Controlled Study –Chronic Migraine
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125-CNS-[ZIP_CODE]
49Blinded treatment will be administered sc once monthly  (ie, approximately  every 4 weeks) for a 
total of [ADDRESS_555135] treatment administration will occur at visit 2 (day 0), and additional doses 
will be admin istered at visits 3 and 4. Final study  assessments will be performed at visit 5
(EOTvisit), approximately  4 weeksafter administration of the 3rdand final dose of study  drug. 
Headache information will be captured daily  during the entire study  using an e lectronic headache 
diary device. Assessments of migraine -related disability  and change in quality  of life (using the 
HIT-6, PHQ-2/PHQ-9, MSQOLquestionnaire , EQ-5D-5Lquestionnaire, PGICscale, and WPAI 
questionnaire ); safety evaluations; blood draws for p harmacokinetic, immunogenicity , and 
biomarker anal ysis; and urine sampling for biomarker anal ysiswill be performed throughout the 
study according to the schedule of assessments ( Table1).In addition, patients who consent to 
pharmacogenomic assessment will provide a blood sample for testing.
Upon completion of the final study  assessments, patientswho complete all scheduled visits may
be eligible to enter a long-term safety  and efficacy study (Study TV48125-CNS-[ZIP_CODE]), 
consisting of a 12 -month double -blind treatment period and a 6.5 -month follow -up period. 
Patients receiving active study  drug in the current study  will continue receiving the same 
treatment (ie, monthly  sc TEV-[ZIP_CODE] at 225 mg or quarterl y sc TEV-[ZIP_CODE] at 675 mg), and 
patients receiving placebo in the current stud y will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_555136] EOT visit (visit 5) proce dures and assessments performed on the last day  they 
receive the stud y drug or as soon as possible thereafter. Those patients who do not enter the 
long-term safet y and efficacy study for any reason will be offered to enter the long-term safet y
extension for the purpose of evaluating ADA approximately  7.5 months (225 days [the 
approximate equivalent of 5 half -lives]) after administration of the last (3rd) dose of study  drugin 
this study .
The assessments and procedures performed during each stud y visit are d etailed in Table1and 
Section3.14.The study  schema is presented in Figure 1.
The end of the stud y is defined as the date the l ast patient attends the EOT/earl y withdrawal visit 
(visit5).
A total of 1020 patients are planned to be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio ( 340patients per treatment 
group) to receive sc TEV -[ZIP_CODE] at 675 mg followed by  2 monthl y sc doses of TEV -[ZIP_CODE] at 
225mg,sc TEV-[ZIP_CODE] at 675 mg followed b y 2 monthly  sc doses of placebo, or 3 monthly sc 
doses of matching placebo.

Note: Baseline refers to the 28 -day run-in period f or headache variables and visit 2 (day 0) for all other variables .
3.2. Justification for Study Design
A randomized, double- blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group design is appropriate given the 
objectives of this study .Furthermore, this design is consisten t with the recommendations of the 
Classifications Committee of the IHSfor controlled trials of pr eventivedrugs in migraine 
(Tfelt-Hansenet al2012).
The dose planned for administration at visit 2 (1stdose) for patients randomized to either 
TEV-[ZIP_CODE] dosing regimen requires administration of 3 ×1.5- mLinjections. I n order to blind 
the treatment arms based on both dose -volume and number of injections, each patient will 
receive 3 sc injections of either active drug (TEV -[ZIP_CODE] treatment groups) or placebo (placebo 
treatment group) at visit 2. Each patient will receive a single 1.5- mL sc injection of active drug 
(225 mg) or placebo at visits 3 and 4 according to their randomized treatment .
3.3. Primary and Secondary Efficacy Measures and Time Points
A description of the efficacy  measures is provided in Section 6.
3.3.1. Primary Efficacy Measure and Time Point

The following exploratory  efficacy measures will be assessed time points specified in Table 1:
exploratory  efficacy endpoints derived from headache data (ie, occurrence of 
headache, duration of headache, maximum severity  of headache, and acute 
migraine-specific medication use), which are collected dail y using an electronic 
headache diary  device
PHQ-2/PHQ-9 (Note: Patients will first respond to the PHQ -2. They will respond to 
questions 3 through 9 [unique questions] of the PHQ- 9 only if the PHQ -2 is positive.)
MSQOL questionnaire 
EQ-5D-5Lquestionnaire 
PGIC scale 
WPAI questionnaire 
3.7. Randomization a nd Blinding
The sponsor, investigators, study  staff (except for staff involved in bioanaly tical analyses), and 
patients will be blinded to treatment assignment. A computer -generated master randomization 
list will be provided to drug packaging facilities. P ackaging vendor(s) will package active drug 
and placebo into single -visit kits according to Good Manufacturing Practice procedures. Kits will 
be identical in appearance and contain 1prefilled sy ringe with active drug or placebo . Adequate 
kit supply  for upcoming stu dy visits will be managed b y IRTand kept (refrigerated at 2°C to 
8°C) on site. 
This is a randomized study with stratification based on gender , country,and baseline preventive 
medication use (y es, no). Each patient will undergo randomization ina 1:1:1ratiowithin the 
stratum to which he or she belongs to receive [ADDRESS_555138] y, maintenance of adequate stud y 
drug supplies on site, and study  randomiza tion centrally . At the time of each study  visit, the IRT
will be queried, and site personnel will retrieve and administer a 1.5- mL volume from e ach
syringe contained in the appropriatel y numbered kit (s).
Placebo-Controlled Study –Chronic Migraine
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_555139] to unblind and will receive the unblinded codes.
3.8.2. Blinding/Unblinding
Pharmacokinetic data may be assessed during the study . Personnel responsible for bioanal ysis 
will be provided with the randomization code in order t o facilitate the analy sis. However, the 
personnel responsible for bioanaly sis will not have access to clinical safet y and efficacy  data and 
will provide concentration data to other personnel in a manner that will not identify  individual 
patients (ie, a dum my patient identifier will be linked to an individual patient’s concentration 
data). 
For information about personnel who may  be aware of treatment assignments, see Section 3.7. 
These individuals will not be invo lved in conduct of an y study procedures or assessment of an y 
adverse events.
In case of a serious adverse event or pregnancy , or in cases when knowledge of the study  drug
assignment is needed to make treatment decisions, the investigator may  unblind the pa tient’s
drug assignment as deemed necessary , mainly in emergency situations. Individual treatment
codes, indicating the treatment randomization for each randomized patient, will be available to
the investigator(s) and/or pharmacist(s) at the study center v ia the IRT, both via telephone and
internet. If possible, the sponsor should be notified of the event prior to breaking of the code. If 
this is not possible, the sponsor should be notified immediately  afterwards, and the patient’s drug 
codeassignment should not be revealed. Breaking of the treatment code can alway s be 
performed b ythe site without prior approval by  [CONTACT_456].
When a blind is broken, the patient will be withdrawn from the stud y, and the event will be 
recorded onto the CRF . The circumstanc es leading to the breaking of the code should be fully  
documented in the investigator’s study  files and in the patient’s source documentation. 
Treatment assignment should not be recorded in any  study documents or source document.
In blinded studies, for ad verse events that are defined as: suspected, unexpected, serious,adverse 
reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) (ie, reasonable possibility ; see Section 7.1.4), Global Patient Safety and 
Pharmacovigilance may  independentl y request th at the treatment code be revealed (on a
case-by-case basis) to comply  with regulatory  requirements. The report will be provided in an 
unblinded manner for regulatory  submission. If this occurs, blinding will be maintained for the 
investigator and for other personnel involved in the conduct, anal ysis, and reporting of the data.

675mg/placebo/placebo dosing regimen ). A more detailed description of administration 
procedures is given in Section 5.1.
3.10. Drug Supply and Accountability
3.10.1. Drug Storage and Security
The study  drug (TEV-[ADDRESS_555140] bo) must be storedrefrigerated at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 
46°F), protected from light; the site should have a process for monitoring the drug storage 
temperature. TEV-[ADDRESS_555141] be kept in a secure area (eg, locked 
refrigerator). 
3.10.2. Drug Accountability
Each stud y drug shipment will include a packing slip listing the contents of the shipment, drug 
return instructions, and any  applicable forms. 
Each investigator is responsible for ensuring that deliveries of stud y drug and other study 
materials from Teva are correctly  received, recorded, handled, stored, accounted for, and used in 
accordance with this protocol. I n addition, each investigator is responsible for ensuring that study  
drug and other material sfrom Teva are correctl y,safely, and properly disposed of in accordance 
with local regulation s.
A record of stud y drug accountability (ie, study drug and other materials received, used, retained, 
returned, or destro yed) must be prepared and signed by  [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_1461], 
with an account given for any discrepancies. 
Placebo-Controlled Study –Chronic Migraine
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_555142] of a screening visit, a 28-day run-in period,and a 12-week (84-day)
double-blind treatment period . Patients are expected to participate in this study  for approximately  
16 weeks. Patients completing this study  may enroll in the double-blind, long -term safety  and 
efficacystudy (StudyTV48125-CNS-[ZIP_CODE]). Those patients who do not enter the long-term 
safety and efficacy study  for any reason w ill be offered to enter the long-term safet yextension 
for the purpose of evaluating ADA approximately 7.5 months (225days) after administration of 
the last (3rd) dose of study  drugin this study . Thus, patient participation for these patients will 
last approximately  10.5months.
See Section 12.4for the definition of the end of the study .
The durations of the run -in and double- blind treatment periods align with Classification 
Committee of the IHS guidelines for controlled trials for the preventive treatment of migraine
(Tfelt-Hansen et al 2012).
Patients who do not enroll in the long -term safet y and efficacy  study for any reason but who 
enter the long -term safety  extension for the purpose of evaluating ADA will return 
approximately  7.5 months (225 day s, the approximate equivalent of 5 half- lives) after the last 
dose of study  drug. This is consistent with the 2009 FDA Guidance for Industry  on Assay  
Development for Immunogenicity Testing of Therapeutic Proteins; a complete washout of the 
drugfrom the circulating blood is expected after approximately  7.5months (≥5 half-lives), 
allowing a more precise evaluation of ADA.
3.12. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_438013] . During the conduct of the study , 
serious adver se events will be reviewed (see Section7.1.5) as they are reported from the 
investigational center to identify  safety concerns. The study  may be termina ted by [CONTACT_72536].
A patient may  discontinue p articipation in the study at an y time for an y reason (eg, lack of 
efficacy, consent withdrawn, and adverse event). The investigator and/or sponsor can withdraw a 
patient from the study  at any time for any  reason (eg, protocol violation or deviation as defi ned 
in Section11.1.2, noncompliance, or adverse event). In addition, p atients with abnormal hepatic 
laboratory  values (eg, ALT, AST, ALP, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase [GGT], total bilirubin, 
or international no rmalized ratio [I NR]) may  meet criteria for discontinuation from the study  
drugas summarized in Appendix E.
3.13. Source Data Recorded on the Case Report Form
All patient data must have supportive original source doc umentation in the medical records, or 
equivalent, before they are transcribed onto the CRF . Data may  not be recorded directl y onto the 
CRF and considered as source data unless the sponsor provides written instructions specify ing 
which data are permitted to be recorded directly  onto the CRF . 
Sourcedata, including test results and/or assessments (eg, clinical laboratory , central ECG 
evaluation center, and electronic headache diary data)collected by  [CONTACT_72537], aresent to the investigational center where they  are retained ,but not entered

to the sponsor (or organization performing data management) for direct entry  into the clinical 
database (see Section 13.1). All data from other institutions will be available to the investigator .
The CRFs are filed in the sponsor’s central file.

methods (defined in Section 5.2) with their partners during the entire stud y period 
and for 7.[ADDRESS_555148] dose of stud y drug.
Sexual abstinence is only considered a highly effective method if defined as 
refraining from heterosexual intercourse in the defined period. The reliability of 
sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical 
study and the preferred and usual lifesty le of the subject. Periodic abstinence (eg, 
calendar, ovulation, sy mptothermal, post -ovulation methods), declaration of 
abstinence for the duration of a study , and withdrawal are not acceptable methods

patient inappropriate for inclusion in the study
u.The patient is a study  center or sponsor employ ee who is directly  involved in the 
study or the relative of such an emplo yee
4.3. Justification for Key Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
The inclusion and exclusion criteria select for patients who meet ICHD-3criteria for CM
(Classification Committee of the IH S,2013). Because headache consortium guidelines 
recommend preventive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_438014] , Inclusion C riterion e allows for the use of up to 1 concomitant 
preventive medication for migraine.
4.4. Withdrawal Criteria and Procedures
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (in accordance with the applicable country ’s 
acceptance), each patient is free to withdraw from the study  at any time. Theinvestigator also 
has the right to withdraw a patient from the stud yin the event of intercu rrent illness, adverse 
events, pregnancy  (see Section7.2), or other reasons concerning the health or well- being of the 
patient, or in the event of lack of cooperation . In addition, a patient may  be withdrawn from the 
studyas described in Section s3.8,3.12, 3.14.4, 5.4, and 7.1.7. 
Should a patient decide to withdraw after administration of study  drug, or should the investigator 
decide to withdraw the patient, all efforts will be made to complete and report all observations up 
to the time of withd rawal. A complete final evaluation at the time of the patient’s withdrawal 
should be made and an explanation given as to why the patient is withdrawing or being 
withdrawn from the study.
The reason for and date of withdrawal from study  drug treatment and the re ason for and date of 
withdrawal from the study  must be recorded on the source documentation and transcribed onto 
the CRF. If a patient withdraws consent, every attempt will be made to determine the reason . If 
the reason for withdrawal is an adverse ev ent or a potentially  clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory  test result, monitoring will be continued at the discretion of the investigator (eg, until 
the event has resolved or stabilized, until the patient is referred to the care of a health care 
professional, or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the study  drug or study  procedure is 
made). The specific event or test result must be recorded on the source documentation and 
transcribed onto the CRF .

70All protocol -specified procedures/assessmen tsshould be performed at the EOT/early withdrawal 
visit (see Table 1). Patients who withdraw from the study  will be offered to enter the long -term 
safetyextension for the purpose of evaluating ADA approximately  7.5 months (225 days[the 
approximate equivalent of 5 half -lives])after the ir last (3rd) dose of study  drug in this study . A
patient should only  be designated as lost to follow up if the site is unable to establish contact

715. TREATMENT OF  PATIENTS
5.1. Drugs Administered During the Study 
Following the baseline assessments, eligible patients will be randomly  assigned with 
stratification based on gender, country,andbaselineuse of preventive migraine medication 
(yes,no) to receive TEV -[ZIP_CODE] at 675 mg followed by  [CONTACT_127615]-[ZIP_CODE] at 225 mg, 
TEV-[ZIP_CODE] at 675 mg follow edby [CONTACT_142925], or monthly  placebo.
Study drug will be administered by  [CONTACT_72540] 28 days for a total of 3 doses,as follows:
Patientsrandomized to receive TEV -[ZIP_CODE] 675/225/225 mg will receive 675 mg of 
TEV-48125as 3active injections (225 mg/1.5 mL ) at visit 2 and 225 mg of 
TEV-[ZIP_CODE] as 1 active injection (225 mg/1.5 mL) at visits 3 and 4. 
Patients rand omized to receive TEV -[ZIP_CODE] 675 mg/placebo/placebowill receive 
675mg of TEV -[ZIP_CODE] as 3 active injections (225 mg/1.5 mL) at visit 2 and placebo 
as a single1.5-mL injection at visits 3 and 4. 
Patients randomized to receive TEV -[ZIP_CODE] placebo will receive three 1.5- mL placebo 
injections at visit 2 and asingle1.5-mL placebo injection at visits 3 and 4. 
The 4-week (28 -day)period will be determined relative to the planned dosing d ay provided the 
patient returns to the study  center within the tolerance window (±3 days). If the patient returns to 
the study center more than 3days late, then the 4- weekperiod will be determined from the actual 
dosing day  rather than the planned dosing day.
Individual , uniquely numbered visit kits containing 1 prefilled syringewith a staked 
27 G½”needle,will be provided. 
At the time of each stud y visit, the I RTwill be queried, and site personnel will retrieve and 
administer 1.5 mL  from each s yringe contained in the appropriately  numbered kit (s).
Recommended sc injection sites follow the National I nstitutes of Health Patient Education 
Guidelines of June 2012, which are available in Appendix Cof this docum ent and in this 
website: http://www.cc.nih.gov/ccc/patient_education/pepubs/subq.pdf. The suggested sites of 
injectionare back of upper arms, lower abdomen/belly /waistline, and front of thighs. Each of the 
injections at visit 2 should be given in a differ ent location (eg, not in precisely  the same place), 
and study  staff member(s) responsible for administration of injections should inspect previous 
injection sites to ensure that they are free of bruising and tenderness and that proper rotation of 
sites is 
performed. 
Study drug should be removed from the refrigerator and allowed to equilibrate at room 
temperature for 15 to 30 minutes before stud y drug administration.
A1.5-mL volume from eachsyringe in each visit’s kit (s)must be injected sc for dosing to be 
considered complete. The total number of sc injections and their locations will be recorded for 
each dosing visit (visits 2, 3, and 4).

746. ASSESSMENT OF  EFFICACY
6.1. Primary Efficacy Measure and Justification
The primary  efficacy endpoint (and secondary  and exploratory  efficacy endpoints as well) will 
be derived from headache variables collected daily  using an electronic headache diary device. 
Eligible patients will receive comprehensive training from site personnel on the use of the 
electronic headache diary device. Site personnel will also instruct patients on the requirement for 
timely and daily completion of the e lectronic diary .
On each day , the patient will be asked to record diary  data for the previous 24- hour period.
Patientsmay be asked about their performance at work, at school, and when doing household 
chores (ie, functional assessments). Patients who report headache on the previous day will 
answer questions about the headache (ie, the number of hours with headache, presence of 
associated s ymptoms, and use of acute migraine medications). Additional details regarding the 
questions patients will answer can be found in the e lectronic headache diary training manual.
If a patientfails to complete the diary  for the preceding day , the patient will be prompted to enter 
the missed day ’s information the next time he/she accesses the electronic diary  provided no more 
than 48hours have elapsed since complet ion of that day . If more than [ADDRESS_555160] moderate severity.
If headacheis reported, the nheadache severity will be subjectively rated by [CONTACT_438052]:
mild headache
moderate headache
severe headache
Patientswill also record whether photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, and vomiting are present, 
and they will record an y migraine medica tions(name [CONTACT_61144], number of tablets/capsules, and 
the dose in milligrams per tablet/capsule) taken on each day .
6.2. Six-Item Headache Impact Test
The HIT- 6 was developed by  [CONTACT_127639] (2003) as a short form for r eliably assessing the 
adverse headache impact in clinical practice and clinical research settings . The questionnaire
measures the adverse impact of headache on social functioning, role functioning, vitality , 
cognitive functioning, and psy chological distress. It also assesses headache severit y. The HIT-[ADDRESS_555161] in patients with 
CM (Yang et al 2011).
Patients will complete the HIT -6 at baseline (visi t 2) and the EOT visit (visit 5).

Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS-[ZIP_CODE]
756.3. Two-Item Patient Health Questionnaire /9-Item Patient Health 
Questionnaire
The PHQ is a 9- item questionnaire with each item corresponding to 1 criterion of the Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders 4thedition diagnostic criteria for major depressive 
disorder. Each of the items is scored on a scale of 0 (“not at all”) , 1 (“several day s”), 2 (“more 
than half the day s”), and 3 (“nearly every day”) based on the frequency  of symptomsduring the 
past 2 weeks ( Spi[INVESTIGATOR_72443] 1999 ). The PHQ -[ADDRESS_555162] 2 questions from the PHQ-9 . The PHQ -2 and the PHQ -9 
are validated measures for detecting and monito ring depression, anxiety , and somatization 
(Kroenke et al 2010 ).
Patients will complete the PHQ-2 a t baseline (visit 2) and the EOT visit (visit 5). I f the PHQ -2 is 
positive(ie, a score of ≥3) , patients will complete questions 3 through 9 (unique questions )ofthe 
PHQ-9.
6.4. Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire
The MSQOL , version 2.[ADDRESS_555163] of migraine and 
migraine treatment on a patient’s quality  of life during the previous 4 weeks, which has been 
shown to be a reliable and valid tool for use in CM and EM ( Bagley et al 2012). The MSQOL 
measures the degree to which performance of normal act
ivities is limited by  [CONTACT_65950] (Role 
Function-Restrictive domain comprising 7 items), the degree to which performance of normal 
activities is prevented b y migraine (Role Function- Preventive domain comprising 4 items), and 
the emotional effects of migraine (Emotional Function domain comprising 3items). Scores range 
from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health- related quality  of life.
Patients will complete the MSQOL  at baseline (visit 2), visits 3 and 4, and the EOT visit 
(visit5).
6.5. EuroQol-5 Dimension Questionnaire
The EQ-5D-5Lis astandardized questionnaire that assesses overall state of health. The 
EQ-5D-5Lconsists of2 parts.In Part 1, patients rate their health state in 5 domains: mobility, 
self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and mood, using a scale of 1 to 5 where 1=no 
problems, 2= slight problems, 3= moderate problems, 4=severe problems, and 5=extreme 
problems. In Part 2, patients rate their health state on a 100 mm visual analog scale; a rating of [ADDRESS_555164] imaginable 
health state .
Patients will complete the EQ-5D-5Lat baseline (visit 2) and the EOT visit (visit 5).
6.6. Patient Global Impression of Change Scale
The PGIC scale is a validated generic tool for assessment of overall change in the severit y of 
illness following treatment. Patients will rate how they describe the change (if any ) that their 
migraine/headaches have had in their general quality  of life and health status since beginning the 
treatment in this study on a 7-point scale where 1= no change (or condition got worse) ;2=almost 
the same, hardl y any change at all ; 3=a little better, but no noticeable change; 4= somewhat 
Placebo-Controlled Study –Chronic Migraine
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS-[ZIP_CODE]
76better, but the change has not made an y real difference ;5=moderately better , and a slight but 
noticeable change ; 6=better, and a definite improvement that has made a real and worthwhile 
difference ;and 7=a great deal better, and a considerable improvement that has made all the 
difference .
Patients will complete the PGI C scalebefore study drug administration at visits 3 and 4 and at 
the EOT visit (visit 5).
6.7. Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire
The generic version of the WPAI  questionnaire measures the overall effect of health on 
productivity  at work and daily  activities. The specific health problems version of the WPAI  
questionnaire allows investigators to attribute productivity  and activity  impairment issues to 
specific health conditions. After the employment status of a respondent is identified, 
3open-ended questions are asked concerning (1) hours absent from work due to health problems 
(or specific condition), (2) hours absent from work due to other reasons ,and (3) hours actually  
worked. Two additional questions are included that ask about the impact of healt h on 
productivity , 1concerning productivity  at work and the other concerning daily  activities outside 
of work. The response format of each item of the WPAI  questionnaire consists of an 11- point 
scale ranging from 0 (no impairment) to 10 (complete impairme nt) (Reilly et al 1993). 
Patients will complete the WPAI  questionnaire at baseline (visit 2) and at the EOT visit (visit 5).

777. ASSESSMENT OF  SAFETY
In this stud y, safety will be assessed b y qualified study  personnel by [CONTACT_167405]: 
reported adverse events ,clinical laboratory  test results, vital signs measurements, 12-lead ECG 
findings, ph ysical examination findings (in cluding body  weightmeasurements), eC- SSRS scores, 
local injection site assessments, and concomitant medication usage .
7.1. Adverse Events 
7.1.1. Definition of an Adverse Event
An adverse event is an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient a dministered a pharmaceutical 
product, regardless of whether it has a causal relationship with this treatment. 
In this study , any adverse event occurring after the clinical study patient has signed the informed 
consent form should be recorded and reported as an adverse event. 
An adverse event can, therefore, be an y unfavorable and unintended ph ysical sign, s ymptom, or 
laboratory  parameter that develops or worsens in severit y during the course of thisstudyor a 
significant worsening of the disease under study  or of any  concurrent disease, whether or not 
considered related to the study  drug. A new condition or the worsening of a pre -existing 
condition will be considered an adverse event . Stable chronic conditions (such as arthritis) that 
are present before stud y entry and do not worsen during this studywill not be considered adverse 
events. 
Accordingl y, an adverse eve nt can include an y of the following:
intercurrent illnesses
physical injuries
events possibly  related to concomitant medication
significant worsening (change in nature, severit y, or frequency) of the disease under 
study or other pre- existing conditions (Note: A condition recorded as pre -existing that 
is intermittently  symptomatic [eg, headache] and that occurs during thisstudyshould 
be recorded as an adverse event.)
drug interactions
events occurring during diagnostic procedures of thisstudyor during an y follow-up 
period of this study
laboratory  or diagnostic test abnormalities that result in the withdrawal of the patient 
from the study , are associated with clinical signs and sy mptomsor a serious adverse 
event, require medical treatment or further diagn ostic work -up, or are considered b y 
the investigator to be clinically significant(Note: Abnormal laboratory  test results at 
the screening visit that preclude a patient from entering the study  or receiving study  
drug are not considered adverse events.)
Placebo-Controlled Study –Chronic Migraine
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS-[ZIP_CODE]
78allevents of possible drug- induced liver injury  with hyperbilirubinemia (defined as 
ASTor ALT≥[ADDRESS_555165] , plus either total bilirubin ≥[ADDRESS_555166] or INR
>1.5) or Hy’s Law events require immediate study treatment cessation and reporting 
as a serious adverse event. Refer to Appendix Efor guidance regarding monitoring 
patients with elevated liver function tests.
Migraine exacerbations, including acute headache, requiring headache medications will be 
collected as part of the efficacy  assessment in this study . Migraine exacerbations (including acut e 
headache) should be recorded as an adverse event only if the presentation and/or outcome is 
more severe than would ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_65890] a 
particular patient or if they are severe enough to require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65891], in which 
case they are recorded as serious adverse events.
7.1.2. Recording and Reporting Adverse Events
Foradverse event recording, the study  period is defined for each patient as th etime period from 
signature [CONTACT_72586] [ADDRESS_555167] be reported immediatel y (see Section7.[IP_ADDRESS]).
The investigator does not need to activel y monitor patient s for adverse events once the study  has 
ended. Serious adverse events occurring after the defined study period should be reported to the 
sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them, following the procedures described in 
Section7.[IP_ADDRESS].
At each contact [CONTACT_10970], the investigator or designee must question the patient about 
adverse events b y asking an open- ended question such as, “Have y ou had any  unusual sy mptoms 
or medical problems since the last visit? If yes, please describe.” All reported or observed signs 
and symptoms will be recorded ind ividually, except when considered manifestations of a 
medical condition or disease state. A precise diagnosis will be recorded whenever possible . 
When such a diagnosis is made, all related signs, symptoms, and an y test findings will be 
recorded collectivel y as a single diagnosis on the CRF and, if it is a serious adverse event, also
on the serious adverse e vent form.
The clinical course of each adverse event will be monitored at suitable intervals until it resolves, 
stabilizes, or returns to baseline; untilthe patient is referred for continued care to a another health 
care professional ;or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the study  drug or study  
procedure is made.
The onset and end dates, duration (in case of adverse event duration of less than 24hours), action 
taken regarding study  drug, treatment administered, and outcome for each adverse event must be 
recorded on the source documentation and transcribed onto the CRF . 
The relationship of each adverse event to study  drug and study  procedures, and the severity  and 
seriousness of each adverse event, as judged b y the investigator, must be recorded ,as described 
below.
Placebo-Controlled Study –Chronic Migraine
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_555168] be recorded as 1 of the choices on the following scale:
Mild: No limitation of usual activities
Moderate: Some limitation of usual activities
Severe: Inability to carry out usual activities
7.1.4. Relationship of an Adverse Event to the Study Drug
The relationship of an adverse event to the study  drug is characterized a s follows:
Term Definition Clarification
No reasonable 
possibility
(not related)This category applies to adverse 
events that, after careful 
consideration, are clearly due to 
extraneous causes (disease, 
environment, etc) or to adverse 
eventsthat, after careful medical 
consideration at the time they are 
evaluated, are judged to be unrelated 
to the study drug.The relationship of an adverse event may be considered

807.1.5. Serious Adverse Events
[IP_ADDRESS]. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event
A serious adverse event is an adverse event occurring at an y dose that results in any  of the 
following outcomes or actions:
death
a life-threatening adverse event (ie, the pati ent wasat immediate risk of d eath from 
the event as it occurred ); does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], which means that 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72444]/or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_438015], or that they  occurred as a consequence of the event. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72446],unless there was worsening of the pre-existing condition during the patient’s 
participation in this study
persistent or significant disability  or incapacity  (refers to a substantial disruption of 
one’s ability  to conduct normal life functions)
a congenita l anomaly /birth defect
an important medical event that may  not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the patient and may  require medical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. E xamples of such events are 
intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the 
development of drug dependency  or drug abuse. Note: Any  suspected transm ission of 
an infectious agent via a medicinal product is considered an important medical event .
An adverse event that does not meet an y of the criteria for seriousness listed above will be 
regardedas a nonserious adverse event.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Expectedness
A serious adve rse event that is not included in the Adverse Reaction section of the relevant 
reference safet y information by [CONTACT_11348] y, severity, outcome, or frequency is considered an 
unexpected adverse event. The reference safety information for this study is th e Investigator’s 
Brochure.
The sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Department will determine the expectedness for all serious 
adverse events.
For the purpose of S[LOCATION_003]R reporting, the version of the reference safety information document at 
the moment of the occurrence of the S[LOCATION_003]R applies.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting a Serious Adverse Event
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Investigator Responsibility
To satisfy  regulatory  requirements, a ll serious adverse events (as described in Section7.1.5.1) 
that occur during the definedstudy period, regardless of judged relationship to treatment with the 
study drug, must be reported to the sponsor by  [CONTACT_093]. The event must be reported
within [ADDRESS_555169] not be delay ed, even if not all the information is available.
The investigator does not need to activel y monitor patient s for adverse events once this study has 
ended. Serious adverse events occurring in a patient after the defined study period should be 
reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them .
The serious adverse event form should be sent to the local safet y officer ( LSO)or other 
designated personnel (a contract research organization [ CRO]in acountry without a sponsor 
LSO; contact[CONTACT_72543]) ; the 
LSO will forward the report to the sponsor’s Global Patient Safety & Pharmacovigilance 
Department .
The following information should be provided to record the event accurately  and completel y:
study number
investigator and investigational center identification
patient number
onset date and detailed description of adverse event
investigator’s assessment of the relationship of the adverse eve nt to the study  drug 
(no reasonable possibility , reasonable possibility )
Additional information may  include the following:
age and sex of patient
date of 1stdose of stud y drug
date and amount of last administered dose of study drug
action taken
outcome, if known
severity
explanation of assessment of relatedness
concomitant therap y (including doses, routes, and regimens) and treatment of the 
event
pertinent laboratory  or other diagnostic test data 
medical history
results of dechallenge/rechallenge, if known

82for an adverse event resulting in death: 
cause of death (whether or not the death is related to study  drug)
autopsy findings (if available)
Each report of a serious adverse event will be reviewed and evaluated b y the investigator and the 
sponsor to asse ss the nature of the event and the relationship of the event to the study  drug, study  
procedures, and underl ying disease . 
Additional information (follow -up) about an y serious adverse event unavailable at the initial 
reporting should be forwarded b y the investigational center within 24 hours of when it becomes 
known to the same address as the initial report. 
Forall countries, the sponsor’s Global Patient Safety  & Pharmacovigilance Department will 
distribute the Council for I nternational Organizations of M edical Sciences form/ extensible 
markup language file to the L SOand/or CRO for local submission to the regulatory  authorities,
IEC/IRBs ,and investigators, according to regulations. The investigator is responsible for 
ensuring that the IRB/ IEC is also info rmed of the event, in accordance with local regulations.
Blindingwill be maintained for the people who are involved directly  in the study . Therefore, in 
case of a S[LOCATION_003]R, only  the LSOor CROpersonnel involved with safet y regulatory submissions 
will receiv e the unblinded report for regulatory  submission; the others will receive a blinded 
report. 
Note: Although pregnancy is not a serious adverse event, the process for reporting a pregnancy  is 
the same as that for reporting a serious adverse event , but using the pregnancy form(see 
Section7.2). 
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Sponsor Responsibility
If a serious unexpected adverse event is believed to be related to the stud y drug or study  
procedures, the sponsor will take appropriate steps to not ify all investigators participating in
sponsored clinical studies of TEV-[ZIP_CODE] and the appropriate regulatory  authorities (and 
IEC/IRB, if appropriate) . 
In addition to notify ing the investigators and regulatory  authorities (and IEC/IRB, if appropriate) , 
other measures may  be required, including the following:
altering existing research by  [CONTACT_23504]
discontinuing or suspending the stud y
altering the process of informed consent b y modifying the existing consent form and 
informing current stud y participants of new findings
modifying listings of expected toxicities to include adverse events newl y identified as 
related to TEV-[ADDRESS_555170]
The following are considered protocol- defined adverse events to be sent to the sponsor’s Global 
Patient Safety  andPharmacovigilance Department for evaluation: ophthalmic adverse events of 
at least moderate severit y, events of possible drug -induced liver injury  (AST or ALT ≥3 ×the 
Placebo-Controlled Study –Chronic Migraine
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_555171], total bilirubin ≥2 ×the ULN or IN R >1.5),Hy’s Law events , or events of suspected
anaphylaxis and severe hy persensitivity  reactions. Severe h ypersensitivity  reactions will be 
monitored using the diagnostic criteria for anaph ylaxis as outlined by  [CONTACT_941] 2006 Joint National 
Institute of Allerg y and Infectious Disease/Food Allergy and Anaph ylaxis Network Second 
Symposium on Anaphy laxis (Sampson et al 2006 [also seeAppendix F]).In the event of 
suspected anaph ylaxis, vital signs, including ox ygen saturation and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], will be 
measured. Other assessments will be performed at the discretion of the investigator.
The process for reporting a protocol-defined adverse event is the same as that for reporting a 
serious adverse event (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). Protocol-defined adverse events for reporting to 
Pharmacovigilance Department can be either serious or nonserious according to the criteria 
outlined in Section7.1.5.1.
7.1.7. Withdrawal Due to an Adverse Event
Any patient who experiences an adverse event may  be withdrawn from the study  or fromstudy 
drugat any time,at the discretion of the investigator. If a patient is withdrawn be cause of an 
adverse event, both the adverse events page and te rmination page of the CRF will be completed 
at that time.
The patient will be monitored at the discretion of the investigator (eg, until the event has 
resolved or stabilized, until the patient is referred to the care of a health care professional, or 
until a determination of a cause unrelated to the study  drug or study  procedure is made). The 
investigator must inform the clinical project ph ysician/clinical leader as soon as possible of all 
patients who are being considered for withdrawal due to adverse events . Additional reports must 
be provided when requested.
If a patient is withdrawn from the study or study drugfor multiple reasons that include adverse 
events, the termination page of the CRF should indicate that the withdrawal is related to an 
adverse event . An exception to this requirement will be the occurrence of an adverse event that,
in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871] ,is not severe enough to warrant discontinuation but requires the 
use of a prohibited medication, thereb y requiring discontinuation of the patient . In such a case, 
the reason for discontinuation would be the need to take a prohibited medication, not the adverse 
event.
7.1.8. Overdose of Study Drug 
Any dose of study  drug (whether th e investigational product or placebo), whether taken 
intentionally  or unintentionally , in excess of that prescribed must be immediately  reported to the 
sponsor. When the identification of the stud y drug must be known, the investigator must follow 
the procedures outlined in Section3.8. 
7.1.9. Protocol Deviations Because of an Adverse Event
If a patient experiences an adverse event or medical emergency , departures from the protocol 
may be allowed on a case -by-case basis .After stabilization and/or treatmen t hasbeen 
administered to ensure patient safet y, the investigator or other ph ysician in attendance must 
contact [CONTACT_438053] s oon as possible to discuss the situation . The investigator, in consultation with 
the sponsor, will decide whether the patient should continue to participate in the study .
Placebo-Controlled Study –Chronic Migraine
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment [ADDRESS_555172] provide the LSO and/or CROwith the pregnancy  form.The process for 
reporting a pregnancy is the same as that for reporting a serious adverse event (see 
Section7.1.5.3). 
Any femalepatient becoming pregnant during the study  will discontinue the study drug.All 
patients who become pregnant will be monitored for the outcome of the pregnancy  (including 
spontaneous or voluntary termination). If the pregnancy  continues to term, the outcome (health 
of the infant up to 8
weeks of age), incl uding details of birth and presence or absence of any  birth 
defect, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and newborn complications, will be reported to the 
sponsor. Any complication of pregnancy  during the study  and any complication of pregnancy  
that the investigator becomes aware of after termination from the study  will be reported as an 
adverse event or serious adverse event, as appropriate.
If the pregnancy  does not continue to term, 1 of the following actions will be taken:
Fora spontaneous abortion, report as a serious adverse event.
Foran elective abortion due to developmental anomalies, report as a serious adverse 
event.
Foran elective abortion notdue to developmental anomalies, report on the pregnancy  
form; do not report as an adverse event .
Forpregnancies of partners of men participating in the study , the Teva Pharmacovigilance 
Department will determine the procedure to appropriately  follow up after notification as 
described above. All partners who become pregnant and provide appropriate consent to the Teva 
Pharmacovigilance Department will be monitored until the completion or termination of the 
pregnancy .
7.3. Clinical Laboratory Tests
All clinical laboratory  test results outside of the reference range will be interpreted b y the 
investigator as belonging to 1of the following categories:
abnormal but not a clinically significant worsening from baseline
abnormal and a clinically significant worsening from baseline 
A laboratory  test result that has significantly  worsened (according to medical judgment) from the 
baseline result will be recorded on the source documentation, transcribed onto the CRF as an 
adverse event, and monitored as described in Section7.1.2.An adverse event includes a 
laboratory  or diagnostic test abnormality  (once confirmed by  [CONTACT_15013]) that results in the 
withdrawal of the patient from the study , the temporary  or permanent cessation of treatment with 
study drug, or medical treatment or further diagnostic work-up.
In addition, potentially  clinically  significant values will be predefined b y the sponsor for selected 
laboratory  parameters and will be detailed in the statistical analysis plan.

7.3.5. Other Clinical Laboratory Tests
[IP_ADDRESS]. Human Chorionic Gonadotropin Tests
Serum β-HCGtestswill be performed for all women of childbearing potential at screening 
(visit1), and urine β- HCG tests will be performed for women of childbearing potential at visits 2 
through5. Any patient who becomes pregnant during the stud y will bewithdrawn. Procedures 
for reporting the pregnancy  are provided in Section7.2. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Follicle-Stimulating Hormone Tests
Postmenopausal women will have a n FSH test at screening (visit 1).
7.4. Vital Signs
Vitalsigns (puls e,systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body temperature, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_2842]) 
will be measured before other assessments (eg, blood draws and administration of 
questionnaires) at the time points detailed in Table1.
Before pulse and blood pressure are measured, the patient must be in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_47342]-erect/seated position and resting for at least 5 minutes. The same position and arm should 
be used each time vital signs ar e measured for a given patient. For any abnormal vital sign 
finding, the measurement should be repeated as soon as possible. Any  vital sign value that is 
judged by [CONTACT_1694] a clinically significant change (worsening) from a baseline value 
will be considered an adverse event, recorded on the source documentation and transcribed onto 
the CRF, and monitored as described in Section7.1.2.
In addition, potentially  clinically  significant values may  be predefined by  [CONTACT_438054] s (see Section9.7.2)and, if so, will be documented in the statistical analy sis 
plan or other relevant documents (eg, medical monitoring plan).
7.5. Electrocardiography
Twelve-lead ECG swill be conducted before other assessments (eg, blood draws and 
administration of questionnaires) at the time points detailed in Table1.The ECGs should be 
performed after the patient has been supi[INVESTIGATOR_1919] 5 minutes. The ECG s will be performed 
in triplicate .
A qualified ph ysician at a central diagnostic center will be responsible for interpreting the ECG. 
ECGs should be performed and transmitted according to the central ECG reading instructions 
provided in the ECG user manual. ECG equipme nt will be provided to all clinical sites.
Placebo-Controlled Study –Chronic Migraine
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS-[ZIP_CODE]
88Although the ECG interpretation will be performed centrall y, the clinical evaluation remains 
under the Investigator’s responsibility .
The ECG will be evaluated by  [CONTACT_72546] (signed and dated), and 
the printout should be kept in the source documentation file. When potentially  clinically 
significant findings are detected b y the Investigator, a cardiologist should be consulted for a 
definitive interpretation. All communications and diag noses should be filed in the source 
documentation file. The Investigator's interpretation will be recorded in the CRF regardless of 
the central reading interpretation. An y abnormal findings assessed b y the Investigator as 
clinically significant should be r ecorded in the relevant CRF modules (eg, adverse event, medical 
history).
Objective alerts are predefined as described in the central ECG reading manual. I n these cases, 
the site and the sponsor will be informed immediately .
Any unscheduled ECGs must also be submitted for central ECG reading.
Any ECG finding that is judged by  [CONTACT_1694] a potentiall y clinically significant change 
(worsening) compared with a baseline value will be considered an adverse event, recorded on the 
source documentation and transcribed onto the CRF, and monitored as described in 
Section7.1.2.
7.6. Physical Examinations
Physical examinations, including height (to be obtained at the screening visit only ) and weight 
will be performed at the time points detailed in Table1. 
A complete ph ysical examination will include the following organ s ystems: general appearance; 
head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; chest and lung s; heart; abdomen; musculoskeletal; skin; ly mph 
nodes; and neurological. Any physical examination finding that is judged by  [CONTACT_1694] a 
potentially  clinically significant change (worsening) compared witha baseline value will be 
considered an adverse event, recorded on the CRF, a nd monitored as described in Section7.1.2.
7.7. Electronic Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale
The eC-SSRS will be used to assess the patient’s suicidal ideation (severity  and intensity ) and 
behavior ( Posner et al 2011). The eC-SSRS Baseline/Screening version will be completed b y the 
patientat visit2, and the eC-SSRS Since Last Visit version will be completed by [CONTACT_72547], as described in Table1. Any positive findings on the eC-SSRS Since L ast 
Visit version requires evaluation by  a physician or doctoral -level psychologist.
7.8. Concomitant Therapy or Medication
Concomitant therap y or medication usage will be monit ored throughout the study . Details of 
prohibited medications are found in Section 5.3.
7.9. Immunogenicit y
Blood samples for serum ADA assessment will be collected at visits 2, 3, and the EOT/ early 
withdrawal visit. Only the samples from TEV- [ZIP_CODE]-treated patients will be anal yzed for ADA. 
Blood samples for ADA assessment will also be collected upon observation of an y severe 
Placebo-Controlled Study –Chronic Migraine
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS-[ZIP_CODE]
89hypersensitivity  reaction (eg, anaph ylaxis). See Appendix Ffor the clinical criteria for 
diagnosing anaph ylaxis. Bioanalytical personnel should be made aware of any anaphylaxis 
occurrence as soon as possible in case an anti- TEV-[ZIP_CODE] immunoglobulin E assay is required.
7.10. Injection Site Assessments
Injection site assessments will be performed immediatel y and 1 hour after administration of each 
dose of study  drug(Table1). The injection site(s) will be assessed for ery thema, induration, 
ecchymosis, and pain, and sever ity will be graded according to the following criteria:
Injection-site erythema, injection -site induration, and injection-site ecchymosis will 
be graded acc ording to measurements: absent, 5 mm to ≤50mm (mild), >50 to 
≤100mm (moderate), and >100 mm (severe). Induration must be assessed by  [CONTACT_438055] o r squeezing the injection site.
Injection-site pain will be measured as summarized in Table3.
Table3:Severity of Pain Scale for Injection Site Assessments
Grade Assessments
[ADDRESS_555173] possible
If a patient has severe injection site induration, erythema, and/or ecch ymosis and/or grade 3 
(severe) or grade 4 (worst possible) injection site pain at 1 hour after completion of study  drug 
administration, the patient will be reassessed at 3 hours after stud y drug administration and 
hourly thereafter un til the reaction/pain is of moderate or less severity .
Appropriate treatment may  be provided if necessary , in which case it must be recorded as 
concomitant medication.
Injection site reactions will also be recorded as adverse events as described in Section 7.1.
7.11. Methods and Timing of Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety 
Data
All adverse events will be reviewed on a periodic basis by  [CONTACT_72549]/medical 
monitor according to the safet y monitoring plan (eg, scheduled safet y reviews for TEV -[ZIP_CODE]) 
as interim/preliminary  safety databases become available. Safety data will additionally  be 
evaluated periodically and ad hoc (if necessary) in the Product Safet y Group.
Methods and timing of assessing safet y data are discussed in Section 3.14.Procedures for 
recording safet y data are discussed in Section 13.1and methods of anal yses are discussed in 
Section9.7.2.

8.1. Pharmacok inetic Variables
Sampling for pharmacokinetics will be sparse. Thus, t he TEV-[ZIP_CODE] pharmacokinetic samples 
will be anal yzed using a population ph armacokinetic approach and will be reported separatel y to 
the clinical study  report. 
Samples from patients who receive active stud y drug will be anal yzed for TEV-[ZIP_CODE] using a
validated method. Samples from patients who receive placebo will not be anal yzed.
8.1.1. Specimen Sampling and Handling
Blood samples ( 4mL) will be collected via venipuncture or indwelling c atheterat the time points 
detailed in Table1for plasmaconcentration measurements of TEV-[ZIP_CODE]. 
The dates and times of study  drug administration and the date and time of each pharmacokinetic 
sample will be recorded on the source documentation and transcribed onto the CRF . 
Forplasma collection, s amples will be collected into dipotassium EDTA collection tubes,
inverted slowly  6to8times tomix the contents,and placed on water/ice (~4 °C). Blood samples 
will be centrifuged (1500g, ~10 minutes, 2°Cto 6°C) between 5 minutes and 1 hour after 
sampling. If a refrigerated centrifuge is not available, samples should be chilled before 
centrifugation. Other measures should be taken as appropriate to prevent samples from heating 
significantl y during centrifugation . Separated plasma will be transferred in approximately  equal 
portions into 2 labeled, 2-mL polypropylene tubes (setsAandB).
Labels for samples should include study number, patientnumber, period, nominal collection 
time, set (A or B), and indication that they  are pharmacokinetic samples. S amples will be stored 
at a temperature within the range of -70°C±20°Cin an upright position until they  are shipped to

8.3. Assessment of Exploratory Biofluid Biomarkers
Biomarkers ar e defined as biological substances that monitor phy siological effects, assess drug 
activity, and predict clinical outcome, safet y, and response to therap y. 
Calcitonin gene -related peptide -containing nerve fibers are prevalent in bone tissue and have 
been hypothesized to be important in the regulation of bone metabolism, response to bone injury ,
and the perception of bone pain. In vitro, C GRP is anabolic to osteoblasts and can inhibit 
maturation to osteoclasts. Preclinical studies suggest C GRP antagonism ma y have benefit in 
osteoarthritis ( Benschop et al 2014) and bone -related pain. In the current study , exploratory  
Placebo-Controlled Study –Chronic Migraine
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS-[ZIP_CODE]
92analysis may be conducted on blood (serum, plasma, and RNA) and urine biomarkers for 
extracellular matr ix turnover, bone formation, and bone resor ption.
In preclinical models, CGRP can promote angioge nesis in ischemia, capsaicin -induced s ynovitis, 
and neovascularization of tumors. Exploratory  analysis will be conducted on 
endothelial/angiogenic markers to d etermine if TEV -[ADDRESS_555174] as a regulator of the innate immune response. Exploratory  
analysis will be conducted on inflammatory  endpoints in blood to examine effects of TEV -[ZIP_CODE] 
in patients with migraine.
Based on the known biology  of CGRP’s mechanism of action, biomarker assessment will 
potentially  include markers of bone remodeling, inflammation, and angiogenesis. M ultiplex 
immunoassay  panels will be applied to measure changes in urine, serum, plasma, and RNA 
biomarkers.
The planned biomarker analy siswill be detailed in a separate document, which may be updated 
at a later stage before the anal ysis to allow updating with new scientific information .
8.3.1. Pharmacogenomic Assessment
A blood sample (6 mL)will be collected from each patient who signsthe separate inform ed 
consent form for pharmacoge nomicassessment 
during this study. Pharmacoge nomicassessment 
potentially  includes the association anal ysis of both known and unknown DNA and RNA genetic 
variations. In the current study , known CGRP and migraine-associated ge nes will be examined to 
determine their association with clinical treatment responses to study  drug and their potential to 
be markers predictive of migraine severit y and progression (eg, efficacy , pharmacokinetics, 
tolerability , and safet y features or dise ase susceptibility  and severity  features). The current list of 
genes with poly morphisms associated with either CGRP target engagement or migraine 
mechanism of action includes CALCA, CALCB, CAL CRL,CRCP,RAMP, PRDM16, AJAP1, 
TSPAN2, MEF2D, TRPM8, TGFBR2, PH ACTR1, FHL5, C7orf10, MMP16, ASTN2, L RP1, 
APOA1BP, TBC1D7, F UT9, STAT6, ATP 5B, and MTHFR ( Anttila et al 2013) . The final list of 
genes that may  be investigated may  be edited ata later timebefore the anal ysis to all ow updating 
with new scientific information. Genetic analy sis could also include sequencing of the whole 
genome and/or RNA transcripts, if required. 
Pharmacog enomicassessment will be performed based on study  results. Samples will be used for 
investigatio ns related to headache, indications where CGRP pathway s are implicated, and 
indications that may  be associated with the risk of headache or those that are common 
comorbidities associated with headache and/or response to study  drug or related investigationa l 
drugs.
8.3.2. Specimen Sampling and Handling
Blood samples ( a total of 18.5mL; 6 mL each for plasma andserumand6.5 mL forRNA 
[PAXgene]) will be collected via venipuncture or indwelling catheter at the time points detailed 
inTable1for serum, plasma, and RNA biomarker measures. Urine will be collected in parallel 
with blood collection . In addition, a 6-mLwhole blood sample will be collected at baseline for 
Placebo-Controlled Study –Chronic Migraine
Clinical Study  Protocol with Amendment 01 Study TV48125- CNS-[ZIP_CODE]
93DNA. Details for processing and handling of each ty pe of biomarker sample will be outlined in 
the laboratorymanual.
All blood and urine tubes will be labeled with the patient coded number. Following DNA 
extraction from pharmacogenomic sample, the sample will be labeled with a new code 
(ie,double coding), so thatgenetic data will not be recorded having a patient number. 
Samples will be stored for a period of up to [ADDRESS_555175] visit in the main 
study and then destroy ed.
8.3.3. Shipment and Analysis of Samples
Biomarker samples for serum, plasma, RNA,and urine will be stored at –70°C and sent to the 
central laboratory  on dry ice ,per instructions in the lab oratory manual.Sample labels should 
include study  number, patient randomization number, visit code, collection date and time ,and 
indication t hat they are biomarker samples. Shipments should be made as specified in laboratory  
manual. An electronic file containing sample demographics will be e- mailed to the respective 
biomarker laboratory  and the sponsor’s biomarker representative for each shipme nt.
Following DNA extractions of whole blood, the samples will be stored at –70°C and labeled 
with a new code (ie, double coding), so that genomic data will not be recorded with a patient 
number. Data will be kept confidential and stored separately .
The biomarker sample analy ses will be performed if and when required. Since new techniques 
continue to be developed, the method and laboratory  that will be recommended for the future 
biomarker anal ysis cannot be anticipated.
8.4. Methods and Timing of Assessing, Reco rding, and Analyzing Clinical 
Pharmacology Data
Methods and timing of assessing clinical pharmacology data are discussed in Section 3.14. 
Procedures for recording clinical pharmacology data are discussed in Secti on13.1, and methods 
of analyses are discussed in Section 9.5.4.

No changes from the final approved (signed) protocol will be initiated without the prior written 
approval or favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1101] a written amendment by  [CONTACT_6179]/IRB and national and local 
competent authorities, as applicable , except when necessary  to address immediate safety  
concerns to the patients, or when the change invol ves only nonsubstantial logistics or 
administration. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16932], the coordinating 
investigator (if applicable), and the sponsor will sign the protocol amendment. 
11.1.2. Protocol Violations
Any deviation from the pro tocol that affects, to a significant degree, (a) the safet y, physical, or 
mental integrit y of the subjects of the study and/or (b) the scientific value of the study will be 
considered a protocol violation. Protocol violations may  include nonadherence on the part of the 
patient, the investigator, or the sponsor to protocol- specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, 
primary objective variable criteria, or GCP guidelines; noncompliance to study  drug 
administration; and use of prohibited medications. Protocol violations will be identified and 
recorded b y investigational center personnel inthe CRF. All protocol violations will be reported 
to the responsible IEC/I RB, as required.
When a protocol violation is reported, the sponsor will determine whether to discont inue the 
patient from the study  or permit the patient to continue in the study , with documented approval 
from the medical expert. The decision will be based on ensuring the safety of the patient and 
preserving the integrity  of the study . 
Changes in the inclusionand exclusion criteria of the protocol are notprospectivel y granted by 
[CONTACT_456]. If investigational center personnel learn that a patient who did not meet protocol 
inclusion and exclusion criteria was entered in a study , they must immediately  inform the 
sponsor of the protocol violation . If such patient has alread y completed the study or has 
withdrawn earl y, no action will be taken but the violation will be recorded .
11.2. Information to Study Personnel
The investigator is responsible for giving infor mation about the study  to all staff members 
involved in the study  or in any  element of patient management, both before starting the study  and 
during the course of the study  (eg, when new staff members become involved). The investigator 
must assure that all study staff members are qualified by  [CONTACT_8640], experience, and training to 
perform their specific responsibilities. These study  staff members must be listed on the 
investigational center authorization form, which includes a clear description of each staf f 
member’s responsibilities. This list must be updated throughout the study , as necessary .
The study  monitor is responsible for explaining the protocol to all study  staff, including the 
investigator , and for ensuring that 
they comply with the protocol . Additional information will be

The study  monitor is the primary  association between the sponsor and the investigator . The main 
responsibilities of the study  monitor(s) are to visit the investigator before, during, and after the 
study to ensure adherence to the protocol, that all data are correctl y and completely  recorded and 
reported, and that informed consent is obtained and recorded for all patients before they  
participate in the study and when changes to the consent form are warranted, in accordance with 
IEC/IRB approvals.
The study  monitor(s) will contact [CONTACT_72556] . The study monitor will be permitted to check and verify the 
various records (CRFs and other pertinent source data record s, including specific electronic 
source documentation [see Section3.13]) relating to the study  to verify adherence to the protocol 
and to ensure the completeness, consistency , and accuracy  of the data being reco rded. If 
electronic CRFs are used for the study , the study  monitor will indicate verification by

12.1. Informed Consent
The investigator, or a qualified person designated by  [CONTACT_093], should fully  inform the 
patient of all pertinent aspects of the stud y, including the written information approved b y the 
IEC/IRB.All written and/or oral information about the study  will be provided in a language as 
nontechnical as practical and understood b y the patient . The patient should be given ample time 
and opportunity to inquire about details of the study  and to decide whether or not to participate in 
the study.The above should be detailed in the source documentation .
Written informed consent will be obtained from each patient before any  study-specific 
procedures or assessments are done and after the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and 
potential hazards are explained, according to the IEC/IRB requirements. The patient’s 
willingness to participate in the study  will be documented in a consent form, which will be 
signed and personally  dated by [CONTACT_80281]. The investigator will keep the original consent forms, and copi[INVESTIGATOR_72448] . It will also be explained to the patients that the patientisfree to refuse entry  
into the study  and free to withdraw from the study  at any time without prejudice to future 
treatment.
Patients will be asked to sign a separate informed consent form if they agree to provide blood 
samples for pharmacogenomic assessment.
12.2. Health Authorities and Independent Ethics Committees/Institutional 
Review Boards
Before this study  starts, the protocol will be submitted to t he national/local health authorities and 
to each IEC/IRB for review. As requ ired, the study  will not start at a given investigational center
before the IEC/I RB and health au thority (where applicable) for the center to give written 
approval or a favorable o pi[INVESTIGATOR_1649].
12.3. Confidentiality Regarding Study Patients
The investigator must ensurethat the privacy  of the patients, including their identity  and all 
personal medical information, will be maintained at all times. I n CRFs and other documents or 
image material su bmitted to the sponsor, patients will be identified not by  [CONTACT_2249], but by  [CONTACT_72560] ( ie,identification number).

13.1. Data Collection
Data will be collected using CRFs that are specifically  designed for this study . The data collected 
on the CRFs will be captured in a clinical data management s ystem (CDMS) that meets the 
technical requirements described in 21CFR Part 11. The CDMS will be fully  validated to ensure 
that it meets the scientific, regulatory, and logistical requirements of the st udy before it is used to 
capture data from this study . Before using the CDMS, all users will receive training on the 
system and study -specific training. After they  are trained, users will be provided with individual 
system access rights.
Data will be colle cted at the investigational center by [CONTACT_11399] y designated and trained 
personnel, and CRFs must be completed for each patient who provided informed consent . Patient 
identity should not be discernible from the data provided on the CRF . Data will be veri fied using 
the data source b y the study  monitor, and reviewed for consistency  by [CONTACT_72562]. All data collected will be approved b y the 
investigator at the investigational center . This approval ack nowledges the investigator’s review 
and acceptance of the data as being complete and accurate. 
If data are processed from other sources (eg, central laboratory, bioanal ytical laboratory , central 
image center, electronic diary  data, or ePRO Tablet ),the results will be sent to the investigational 
center, where they  will be retained but not entered into the CRF ,unless otherwise specified in the 
protocol. These data may also be sent electronically  to the sponsor (or organization performing 
data management) f or direct entry  into the clinical database. Laboratory  test results will not be 
entered into the CRF ,unless otherwise noted in the protocol . All data from other sources will be 
available to the investigator s.
Forpatients who enter a study  but do not meet entrycriteria, at a minimum, data for screen 
failure reason, demography , and adverse events from the time of informed consent will be 
entered into the CRF . 
13.2. Data Quality C ontrol 
Data Management is responsible for the accuracy , quality, completeness, and internal 
consistency  of the data from this study . Data handling, including data quality  control(QC), will 
comply with international regulatory  guidelines, including ICH GCP guidelines. Data 
management and control processes specific to this study , along with all steps and actions taken 
regarding data management and data QC, will be described in a data management plan.
Case report forms received will be processed and reviewed for completeness, consistency , and 
the presence of mandatory  values. Applicable te rms will be coded according to the coding 
conventions for this study . Logical checks will be implemented to ensure data quality  and 
accuracy. Any necessary  changes will be made in the clinical database, and data review and 
validation procedures will be rep eated as needed . Data from external sources will be compared 
with the information available in the CDMS. Discrepancies found will be queried.

1211BACKGROUND INFORMATION
1.1Introduction (Other sections affected by [CONTACT_11376]: Section 16)
However, approximately 3% to 6%of individuals with EM 
evolve, in any given year, to a significantly more disabling 
condition called chronic migraine (CM) ( Bigal et al 2008, 
Lipton et al 2007 , Scher et al 2003). Individuals with CM 
present with headaches of any severity on [ADDRESS_555204] 8 days per 
month (Classification Committee of the IH S, 2013). A 
sizable proportion of individuals with CM experiences daily 
headaches and, therefore, facesconsiderable disability (Bigal 
and Lipton 2008).
[…]
Calcitonin gene -related peptide (CGRP) is a well -studied 
neuropeptide found at the centers of the migraine processes, 
both centrally and peripherally (Eftekhari and Edvinsson 
2010, Olesen 2011).However, approximately 3% of individuals with 
EM evolve, in any given year, to a significantly 
more disabling condition called chronic migraine

headaches of any se verity on [ADDRESS_555205] 8

1.3.1Nonclinical Studies
In vivo pharmacology studies of TEV -[ZIP_CODE] in animal 
models indicate that TEV -[ZIP_CODE] prevented an increase in 
blood flow in rat paw skin and the middle meningeal 
artery after electrical stimulation and produced a dose -
dependent inhibition of the capsaicin -induced skin flare 
response in cynomolgus monkey.
[…]
The inflammation was consideredsuspected to be the result of 
immune complex formation/deposition from the monkeys’ 
immunogenic response to the drug (TEV -[ZIP_CODE]) and was not 
considered to be clinically relevant . In thepi[INVESTIGATOR_22735] 6-month 
chronic toxicity study in monkeys following once -weekly sc 
dosing at dosage levels of up to 300 mg/kg/week, achieving 
high exposure throughout the study, no microscopic 
findings were noted in any o f the organs, including the cil iary 
vessels of the eyes , and the NOAEL of the chronic toxicity 
study was de termined to be the highest dose tested, 300 
mg/kg/week. Thus, it is believed that in view of the low 
frequency (ie, observed in very few animals) and minimal 
severity, the finding (perivascular inflammation) that was 
only recorded in the 3 -month toxicity s tudy, and had been 
resolved during the recovery period, is an incidental 
finding.

Important protocol deviations, referred to as protocol 
violations, are a subset of protocol deviations that may 
significantly impact the completeness, accuracy, and/or 
reliability of the study data or that may significantly affect a 
patient’s rights, safety, o r wellbeing. Protocol violations 
include enrolling patients in violation of key eligibility criteria 
designed to ensure a specific subject population, failing to 
collect data necessary to interpret primary endpoints, 
noncompliance to study drug administra tion, use of prohibited 
medications, GCP noncompliance, or any other deviations that 
may have an impact on the processes put in place for the care 
and safety of the patients or compromise the scientific value of 
the trial.
Any deviation from the protocol t hat affects, to a 
significant degree, (a) the safety, physical, or mental 
integrity of the subjects of the study and/or (b) the

161APPENDIX E.GUIDANCE ON SAFETY M ONITORING
Guidance on Monitoring Patients with Elevated Liver Function Tests
Liver enzy mes (ALT, AST, GGT, and ALP) as well as total bilirubin and direct bilirubin will be 
measured(and indirect bilirubin will be calculated) at each study  visit.
In any case of elevated ALT or AST to a level exceeding ≥2× the ULN (including patient s whose 
baseline ALT or AST levels are ≥2× and ≤3× the ULN, who may  be enrolled in the study ), a 
thorough medical history and phy sical examination with a focus on liver disease should be 
undertaken.1In addition, the 
patientshould be instructed to refrain from alcoholic beverages.
In case of s ymptoms compatible with drug -induced liver injury during the study , patients will be 
instructed to return to the study  centerfor an unscheduled visit or to go to the emergency  roomto 
measure liver enzy mes as soon as possible. Solitary  elevations of total or direct bilirubin, not 
accompanied b y elevations of ALT or AST, should be managed according to the discre tion of the 
treating p hysician.
Elevation o f Either A LT or AST to ≥3× ULN
Confirmation is required prior to study  drug discontinuation in cases of elevation of either ALT 
or AST ≥3× ULN (Note: In cases of elevation of AL T or AST ≥8× the ULN, no confirmation is 
required prior to study  drug discontinuation, but the assessments below should be performed). 
The following procedures should be followed :
The day in which the abnormal value is received from the laboratory  will be
considered as day  0. 
The investigator should repeat the test for confirmation purposes ( this may be 
performed in a local laboratory  along with complete blood count [CBC] and 
differential to assess for eosinophilia. I n general, in case a blood sample is sent to a 
local laboratory , the following assessments [and reference ranges] are mandatory :
ALT [serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase], AST [serum glu tamic oxaloacetic 
transaminase ], ALP, total and direct bilirubin, CBC [with differential for eosinophil 
count, separate tube], and INR [separate tube; not to be sent in a confir matory test]). 
The investigator should also question the patient regarding s ymptoms.
The abnormalit y will be regarded as confirmed in each of the following scenarios:
thebaseline value was within the normal range and AL T or AST is still ≥3× the ULN
the 
baseline value was above the ULN and ALT or AST is ≥2 ×the baseline value
                                                
1Thorough medica l history with a focus on liver disease: personal or family his tory of liver disease; personal history 
of a systemic disease with potential liver involvement; exposure to alcoho l, medications (prescription or 
over-the-counter), herbal preparations, dietary supplements, recreational drugs, special diets ,orenvironmental 
chemical agents; potential exposure to infectious agents (eg, travel to developi[INVESTIGATOR_14696], history of potential 
exposure to blood or blood products, high -risk sexual relations) ;and any a dditional information deemed relevant 
by [CONTACT_093]. Physical examination, including signs of chronic liver disease .

162Additional Tests/Evaluations:
Upon confirmation of the abnormality  as noted above, the f ollowing additional evaluations 
should be performed and results should be recorded in the CRF:
serology for hepatitis A (antibody and immunoglobulin M [IgM] and IgG), B (core 
antibodytotal, core IgM, and surface a ntigen), and C viruses (central laboratory )
serology for autoimmune hepatitis: anti -nuclearantibodies (titer), a nti-smooth muscle 
antibodies, and anti-liver kidney  microsomal antibodies (central laboratory ); further 
testing may  be required in case of a positive result for hepatitis B or C
ultrasound examination of the liver and biliary tract at the investigator’s discretion
other diagnostic tests/consultations as deemed ne cessary by [CONTACT_093] 
(eg,serology for hepatitis E virus in case of travel to endemic geography )
observation and follow -up (to be performed after the abnormalit ywas confirmed as 
above)
ALT or AST ≥3× (>3.5× the ULN if the Baseline Value Is >2.5× the ULN) but Less T han5× 
the ULN
In addition to the above procedures required for any elevation to levels >3× the ULN:
Alanine aminotransferase , AST, GGT, ALP, total and direct bilirubin, CBC and 
differential (to assess for eosinophilia) ,and INR should be monitored on days 5 
(±2days), 8 (±2days), 14(±3days), and 28 (±3days). On at least [ADDRESS_555241] should be p erformed centrally. ( The INR should be sent to a local laboratory
only.)
In cases where a local laboratory  is used, the results should be recorded in the CRF, 
accompanied b y the reference range of the relevant measurements.
Should the abnormality  (≥3× the ULN in case baseline was within the normal ra nge 
or ≥2×the ULN in case t he baseline value was above ULN but still <5× the ULN) 
persist further, the patient will be followed according to the investigator’s discreti on,
but a blood sample for ALT, AST, GGT, ALP, and total and direct biliru bin should 
be sent to the central laboratory at least once a month .
ALT or AST ≥5× but Less Than 8× the ULN
In addition to the above procedures required for any  elevation to levels >3 × the ULN:
Alanine aminotransferase , AST, GGT, ALP, total and direct bilirubin, CBC and 
differential count (to assess for eosinophilia), and INR should be monitored 
twice aweek.
At least for every  other measurement, the test s should be sent to the central 
laboratory . The rest of the tests may  be sent to a loca l laboratory . The INR should 
always be sent to a local laboratory .

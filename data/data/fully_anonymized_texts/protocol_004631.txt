v11, 3 -1-2018    4 1.0 Study Synopsis and Schema  
1.1 Study Objectives  
The primary objective of this proposal is  to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of buprenorphine- assisted 
discontinuation from chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_199628] (COT- P) and to determine the role of gabapentin, an N -
type calcium channel blocker, as an adjunctive agent to assist with opi[INVESTIGATOR_199629]. Secondary objectives are 
to identify pat ient characteristics (biological, psychological, and pharmacological) that predict (1) successful 
transition to buprenorphine, (2) successful buprenorphine taper , and (3) opi[INVESTIGATOR_199629].  
The central hypothesis of this study is that COT -P patients underg oing a buprenorphine taper with adjunctive 
gabapentin will have higher rates of opi[INVESTIGATOR_199630]/placebo.  
Secondary hypotheses are that patients will have decreased pain after buprenorphine initiation,  and that those 
on adjunctive gabapentin will have lower withdrawal and pain scores when compared with placebo.  
1.2 Study Design  
This study will be conducted over four years to evaluate buprenorphine-
assisted opi[INVESTIGATOR_199631] 150 individuals on COT- P who are (1) seeki ng 
assistance with opi[INVESTIGATOR_199632] (2) willing to attempt 
buprenorphine- assisted taper.   Because the fundamental question of 
how COT -P patients tolerate buprenorphine initiation is unanswered, 
we have divided this pi[INVESTIGATOR_199633] .   
1.2.1  Aim 1 
[IP_ADDRESS] Research Questions  - Aim 1 
The primary research question for Aim 1 is, “What is the base rate of 
COT -P patients who can transition to buprenorphine?”  The secondary 
research  question is, “Which patient characteristics (biological, 
psychological, and pharmacological) predict successful transition to 
buprenorphine?”  
[IP_ADDRESS] Hypothesis Aim 1  
Aim 1 Main Hypothesis:  It is expected 50% of the subjects transitioned 
to buprenorphine will tolerate buprenorphine.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Outcome Mea sures  – Aim 1 
For Aim 1, the primary outcome measure is the percentage of 
patients who tolerate buprenorphine initiation  within an 8- hour 
initiation period, as evidenced by (1) moderate- good level of pain 
control (same or improved rating on a 0-10 visual analogue scale for pain), (2) mild to no withdrawal  symptoms 
(≤10 on the Clinical  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_9721]), and (3) willingness to continue to the stabilization and tapering 
phase of the study . 
1.2.2 Aim 2 
[IP_ADDRESS] Research Questions – Aim 2 
Aim 2 will involve  preliminary evaluation of buprenorphine tapering and opi[INVESTIGATOR_199634] -P as well as the efficacy of gabapentin in assisting with discontinuation.  The primary research questions 
for Aim 2 are: “What is the base rate of successf ul taper from buprenorphine?” and “What is the efficacy of 
gabapentin in improving completion outcomes during buprenorphine taper ?”  The secondary research 
questions are “Do subjects have more/less pain after transition and taper from buprenor phine?” and “ Which 

v11, 3 -1-2018    5 patient characteristics (biological, psychological, and pharmacological) predict successful taper from 
buprenorphine?”  
[IP_ADDRESS] Hypothesis –  Aim [ADDRESS_238161] higher rates of opi[INVESTIGATOR_199630]/ placebo.  
Secondary hypotheses are that patients will have decreased pain after buprenorphine initiation and that those 
on adjunctive gabapentin will have lower withdrawal and pain scores when compared with placebo.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Outcome Measures –  Aim 2 
For Aim 2, the primary outcome measure will be opi[INVESTIGATOR_199635] 8 weeks, measured through self -report, 
prescription drug monitoring data, and confirmatory UDS for a full panel of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].  
1.2.3 Study Design  Aims 1 and 2 
During the screening/baseline phase, all subject s will be assessed to determine eligibility .  These assessments 
may occur over one or more visits and include medical exams, mental health and pain assessments, collection 
of biological specimens and opi[INVESTIGATOR_199636].  
Followin g the screening/baseline procedures, a [ADDRESS_238162] s 
will receive an initial 4mg dose of buprenorphine and will be observed. The observation periods will include 
assessment of  opi[INVESTIGATOR_199637]. A dditional doses of buprenorphine will be administered 
as clinically indicated up to a cumulative dose of up to 16mg. If the subjec t does not tolerate  buprenorphine 
after 16mg, they will be transitioned back to the prescribing physician. If the subjec t tolerates the 
buprenorphine and agrees to continue with the study, they will move into the stabilization/ tapering  phase of the 
study  (Phase II) . 
The stabilization/tapering phase of the study will begin with a 2 week stabilization phase during which subjec ts 
will be randomized to receive either gabapentin or placebo titration in conjunction with the buprenorphine. 
Doses will continue to be closely monitored  and adjusted as clinically indicated to determine the stabilizing 
dose of buprenorphine and the appropriately titrated dose of gabapentin/placebo. Subject s will attend weekly 
study visits and study staff will conduct additional phone visits as needed.  
Following the stabilization phase, subjec ts will begin the tapering phase of the study. The dose of 
buprenorphine will be tapered over a period of 8 weeks  to 0mg , during which subjec ts will continue to take 
gabapentin or placebo.  Once the buprenorphine dose has been tapered to 0mg, subjec ts will go through a 1 
week taper of the gabapentin/placebo. Subject s will continue to attend weekly study visits throughout the 
tapering phase and additional phone visits will be conducted as needed throughout the study.  
The final phase of the study is the follow -up phase. Subjects will be monitored for opi[INVESTIGATOR_199638] 1, 3, 6, and 12- months post -study discontinuation/completion.  
1.[ADDRESS_238163] a concurrent medical 
or psychiatric condition that, in the study team’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], would preclude safe or meaningful participation.    
2.[ADDRESS_238164] of a prescription drug overdose epi[INVESTIGATOR_901], and one of the main populations at 
risk are the 9 million individuals maintained on chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_199628] (COT- P).  While the benefits of 
COT -P continue to be debated, research indicates that a s ignificant number of  COT -P patients demonstrate  
improvement in pain and functional outcomes after opi[INVESTIGATOR_46218].  Reducing the number of individuals 
maintained unnecessarily on COT -P would significantly reduce the risk of dev elopi[INVESTIGATOR_199639]. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], major barriers to opi[INVESTIGATOR_199640] (e.g., continued pain, fear of disabling withdrawal 
symptoms ) and empi[INVESTIGATOR_199641]. The overall 
goal of this study  is to expand the evidence regarding opi[INVESTIGATOR_199642] -P.  In the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_199643], evidence suggests that buprenorphine- assisted opi[INVESTIGATOR_199644], and gabapentin has been shown to improve outcomes in buprenorphine- assisted 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_9734].   However, these interventions have not been well -studied in individuals on COT -P without 
addiction. T he primary objectives  of the current study  are to : (1) evaluate the tolerability of buprenorphine 
initiation in patients on COT -P, (2) evaluate the efficacy of gabapentin up to 1600mg/day in improving 
outcomes for patients undergoing buprenorphine- assisted taper from COT- P using a placebo- controlled 
randomized design, and (3) identify potential predictors of opi[INVESTIGATOR_199629]. In order to accomplish this, we will 
conduct an intent -to-treat, double- blind, randomized controlled trial (8 weeks) of buprenorphine -assisted opi[INVESTIGATOR_199645] [ADDRESS_238165] -treatment, as well as 1- , 3-, 6-, and 
12- month follow up. The following specific aims are proposed:  
Specific Aim 1:  To determine the base rate of buprenorphine tolerability among COT -P subjects 
(N=150) with an indication for opi[INVESTIGATOR_199629].  
We will determine buprenorphine tolerability among patients on COT- P using a one- day, outpatient medically -
supervised buprenorphine initiation protocol.  Relevant baseline factors will be measured to identify predictors 
of buprenorphine tolerability (e.g., gender, opi[INVESTIGATOR_40533]/ duration, pain measures/characteristics).  COT -P 
patients who tolerate buprenorphine initiation (defined by [CONTACT_199739], opi[INVESTIGATOR_43351], and willingness to 
continue with taper) will then proceed to Phase 2 (stabilization/tapering phase) . 
Specific Aim 2:  To compare the efficacy of the N -type calcium -channel blocker , gabapentin , versus 
placebo in improving treatment outcomes  (i.e., pain, opi[INVESTIGATOR_199629]) during an [ADDRESS_238166]  by [CONTACT_199740] a major 
v11, 3 -1-2018    7 clinical need in the area of chronic pain management, ultimately leading to decreased risk of  prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_5422], addiction and overdose in this population.  
2.1 Backg round  
2.1.1 Significance and Rationale 
A significant proportion of patients maintained on chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_199628] (COT -P) have  
suboptimal pain relief and/or  poor functioning despi[INVESTIGATOR_199646] . 
Americans represent less than 5% of t he world’s population, but consum e 80% of the gl obal opi[INVESTIGATOR_199647]31 
with [ADDRESS_238167] to optimal approaches to  opi[INVESTIGATOR_199648] -P patients and how opi[INVESTIGATOR_199649].  Discontinuation of opi[INVESTIGATOR_199650], experience improvement in the underlyin g pain condition (e.g. after surgery or 
other interventions), exhibit aberrant drug- related behaviors or addiction,  and in patients who wish to 
discontinue therapy for other reasons (e.g., for work, patient preference).  Among patients who are functioning 
poorly on COT -P, decreasing or tapering the opi[INVESTIGATOR_199651] a medication with appreciable risks and limited benefit. However, opi[INVESTIGATOR_199652]- P can cause disabling withdr awal symptoms in a substantial proportion of patients31-33.  The few 
studies evaluating opi[INVESTIGATOR_199653]- P show dismal rates of both reduction and cessation of opi[INVESTIGATOR_199654]33-36. Treatment guidelines and tapering protocols vary widely 
among instit utions and specialty societies37 and there has been little systematic investigation or progress 
towards optimizing tapering protocols, making it unclear which opi[INVESTIGATOR_199655].  This project will begin to systematically address the gaps in this important area of clinical 
research.  
Buprenorphine  is an agent well-suited to assist  with opi[INVESTIGATOR_199656], but questions remain rega rding optimal length of taper.  Buprenorphine, a partial mu -opi[INVESTIGATOR_199657] , produces a more limited withdrawal syndrome as compared to other full opi[INVESTIGATOR_199658]38-40, which may be related to its long plasma half -life and slow dissociation from the receptor38-42.  
Also, buprenorphine has a ceiling on its agonist effects that reduces risk of overdose, making it a good 
candidate for use in outpatient settings40-47.  Recent preliminary evidence confirms an advantage of 
buprenorphine over full agonists, like methadone, in detoxification settings48.  Longer buprenorphine tapers 
may be related to improved detoxification outcomes (consistent with methadone literature), but studies are 
highly variable in methodology and duration (ranging from 1 -120 days), thus, investigations in COT -P patients 
applying more rigorous methodology are needed49.  Clinical pain rehabilitation programs that incorporate opi[INVESTIGATOR_199659] [ADDRESS_238168] udy will allow the 
maximum taper time used in current practice, up to 8 weeks based on stabilizing dose, for taper completion 
(Please see Approach section).   
v11, 3 -1-2018    8 Preliminary studies show that buprenorphine initiation and taper is tolerated in approximately 50% of 
those on COT -P, which  leaves room for significant improvement .  In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], [CONTACT_199766] (Co-
Mentor) and colleagues transitioned non -addicted COT -P patients to buprenorphine with the purpose of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a protocol for the use of buprenorphi ne in this population52.  This pi[INVESTIGATOR_199660] a small and 
diverse sample o f patients (n=12) and found that 7 of 12 subjects (58%) on COT- P tolerated initial 
buprenorphine induction and of the 7 , 42%  responded favorably to buprenorphine taper.  Other trials 
evaluating the transition rate for those on COT- P to buprenorphine (in those with and without addiction) also 
show that approximately 50% tolerate transition from COT -P to buprenorphine (taking into account both si de 
effects and efficacy)53. Based on these trials , it is recommendation to  target COT -P candidates on total opi[INVESTIGATOR_199661] > 19mg and <200mg of oral morphine equivalents for transition to buprenorphine and to not 
use buprenorphine use in patients receiving methadone or transdermal fentanyl , and t hese recommendations 
are followed in the current  protocol.   
Because COT -P patients who tolerate buprenorphine taper show a significant decrease in pain, 
patients and clinicians would benefit from an improved response rate  to buprenorphine taper.   Data 
from our group and others have shown that even when indications for opi[INVESTIGATOR_199662], patients’ 
fear of pain and withdrawal symptoms makes the decision to taper off  COT-P daunting54.  Because those  who 
tolerate buprenorphine initiation, taper  and opi[INVESTIGATOR_199663] a significant decrease in average and worst 
daily pain52, buprenorphine is a promising agent that can address the fears of pain and withdrawal in this 
population.  However, ba sed the existing data above, clinicians only have an approximately 50% chance of 
identifying COT- P patients who would respond well to transitioning to buprenorphine, and less than 50% 
chance of identifying those able to tolerate taper .  Examining  predictors of successful transition from COT -P to 
buprenorphine as well as ways  improve the taper response rate  (i.e. adjunctive medication) could have 
profound clinical implications  in this population.    
Gabapentin is an ideal adjunct ive agent to improve outcomes in those tapering off COT -P, as it is a 
safe and effective agent that can address both chronic pain and opi[INVESTIGATOR_9801].  
Gabapentin, an N -type calcium channel blocker55-[ADDRESS_238169] 
gabapentin administration of 1,600 mg/day during a methadone -assisted detoxification in those with opi[INVESTIGATOR_199664]70.  Because gabapentin has a proven 
safety and efficacy history in those with chronic pain and in those on opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], including buprenorphine, it is an 
ideal adjunctive agent to study in this proposal.  Thus, Phase 2 of this study will evaluate the effects of 
gabapentin at up to 1,600 mg/day vs. placebo on completion of buprenorphine taper , opi[INVESTIGATOR_199665] -P undergoing a buprenorphine taper.  
2.1.[ADDRESS_238170]  to systematically explore buprenorphine initiation/tapering with 
adjunctive gabapentin treatment  as an approach to opi[INVESTIGATOR_199666] -P.  [CONTACT_199767] ’s 
(Co-Mentor)  pi[INVESTIGATOR_199667] -P showed that a significant proportion of COT- P patients 
tolerate transi tion to buprenorphine with a subsequent decrease in pain.  This study will expand these findings 
by [CONTACT_199741] a larger sample to allow for the first time: (1) Determination of the base 
rate of COT -P individuals who can tolerate buprenorphine initiation, (2) Determination of the base rate of 
successful taper from buprenorphine, and (3) Examine the efficacy of gabapentin in improving completion 
v11, [ADDRESS_238171] public health problems that faces our 
nation today.   
Comprehensively evaluating predictors of buprenorphine tolerance and successful opi[INVESTIGATOR_199668] -P is novel.  To date, pain phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], including self -report measures of pain and 
pain laboratory  testing in those tapering from COT -P has not been studied. Exploring pain characteristics and 
pathways in relationship to treatment outcomes can (1) elucidate the mechanism of change in pain level 
(descending pain pathways, wind- up pain pathways, nociceptive pain pathways), (2) provide information about 
predicting  opi[INVESTIGATOR_199669], and (3) inform future studies targeting therapeutic development. 
Thus, this application represents a highly innovative and novel proposal that will yield extremely valuable data 
pertaining to a significant health concern i n the US.    
3.0 Study Objectives  
The primary objective of this proposal is  to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of buprenorphine- assisted 
discontinuation from chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_199628] (COT- P) and to determine the role of gabapentin, an N -
type calcium channel blocker, as an adjunctive agent to assist with opi[INVESTIGATOR_199629]. Secondary objectives are 
to identify patient characteristics (biological, psychological, and pharmacological) that predict (1) successful 
transition to buprenorphine, (2) successful buprenorphine taper , and (3) opi[INVESTIGATOR_199629].  
4.0 Study Design  
4.1 Overview of Study Design  
This study is to be conducted over four years to evaluate buprenorphine- assisted opi[INVESTIGATOR_199631] 150 
individuals on COT -P who are (1) seeking assistance with opi[INVESTIGATOR_199632] (2) willing to attempt 
buprenorphine- assisted taper.   Because the fundamental question of how COT- P patients tolerate 
buprenorphine initiation is unanswered, we have divided this pi[INVESTIGATOR_199670].   
4.2 Prescreening  and Consent  
Subjects will be pre- screened for general inclusion/exclusion criteria.  Potential ly eligible  subjects will be given 
a full description of the study procedures and will be asked to read and sign an IRB -approved informed 
consent form.   
4.3 Screening and Baseline Assessments  
During the screening/baseline phase, subject s will be assessed with a clinical interview and self -report forms to 
confirm their eligibility. These assessments may occur over one or more visits and will also include medical 
exams, mental health and pain assessments, collection of biological specimens and opi[INVESTIGATOR_199671]. Subjects will be required to allow communication with their prescribing physicians and will be on 
no other opi[INVESTIGATOR_199672].  S ubjects' prescribing physicians will 
be informed of patient participation and outcome as part of the study to protect against duplication of opi[INVESTIGATOR_199673] . The state prescription drug monitoring database will also be checked weekly throughout the study 
period and during the follow -up period at 1- , 3-, 6- and 12 -months .   
In preparation for buprenorphine initiation,  subjects will be advised by [CONTACT_5989] (board- certified 
addiction psychiatrist) how to taper and stop t heir full agonist opi[INVESTIGATOR_199674]; they will also be prescribed supportive 
medications to take as needed for withdrawal the day/night prior to buprenorphine in itiation. Long- acting 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_199675] [ADDRESS_238172] 2 days prior to induction.    
v11, 3 -1-2018    10 4.4 Buprenorphine Initiation   
Following the screening/baseline procedures, the buprenorphine induction visit will be conducted.  On 
buprenorphine initiation  day, subjects  will spend up to 5 hours in the Research Nexus or clinical office.  On 
arrival, vital signs, subjective pain levels , and opi[INVESTIGATOR_199676],  and buprenorphine 
induction will begin with 4mg once the C OWS is ≥8. If the 4mg induction dose is tolerated and withdrawal 
symptoms remain, repeated doses o f buprenorphine 4 mg (up to 16 mg on day 1) will be given every 30- 60 
minutes until withdrawal symptoms are mild or res olved, monitoring for sedation.  The following i nduction 
algorithm is proposed:  
1. Participants should refrain from any opi[INVESTIGATOR_199677] 8 hours prior to induction.  
2. Pre-dose baseline score on COWS should be ≥8 (with no signs of intoxication).  
3. An initial 2  mg sublingual dose should be given and the participant observed for 30  minutes.  If 
symptoms do not improve, an additional 2 -4 mg (total cumulative dose 6 mg) can be given and the 
participant observed for 30- 60min.  If withdrawal or pain symptoms persist, another 2 -4mg (total 
cumulative dose 10 mg) ca n be given, and patient will be observed for 30- [ADDRESS_238173], the study medical clinician believes it is necessary, and participant wants to 
continue in study, a final 4mg dose can be given in the office and patient obser ved for 1 hour  (total 
cumulative dose 14 mg).   
4. Participants can leave once the assessment suggests that withdrawal phenomena and pain are 
both tolerable and stable or improving.  If the patient does not tolerate buprenorphine after 16mg, 
they will be transitioned back to prescribing physician (see details below) . 
5. The study medical clinician or a designated staff member should contact [CONTACT_199742].  
This induction scheme is relatively conservative and aims to limit  the first day dose to 16mg.  Alternative 
induction schedules can be used if the study medical clinician believes it is necessary.  
Self-report measures of pain, withdrawal and sedation will be obtained every [ADDRESS_238174] amount of side effects (stabilizing dose), he or she  will be observed for [ADDRESS_238175] (1) does not tolerate the initial or subsequent doses of buprenorphine; 
(2) experienc es an increase in pre -buprenorphine measures of pain; (3) fails to have a decrease in withdrawal 
symptoms to the mild range (COWS≥8); or (4) does not want to continue with buprenorphine for any reason, 
the patient will be instructed to resume their previous opi[INVESTIGATOR_199678] 1/2 the pr evious 
dose for one day, then as  tolerated, slowly titrate back up to previous dose (in collaboration with their 
prescribing physician).  The prescribing physician will also be provided with general guidelines for outpatient 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_164846], should that be pursued .  If the patient  has any serious adverse reaction to buprenorphine, they 
will be escorted  to the emergency room .

4.5 Randomization and Blind Maintenance Procedures  
All subjects who tolerate buprenorphine initiation during the induction visit will be enrolled in the study and 
randomized to adjunctive gabapentin or placebo (labeled A or B by [CONTACT_199743]) 
performed by  [CONTACT_199744] ( stratified random block design with 
block sizes of 2, 4 and 6 through RedCap) , balancing groups on sex. Based on the randomizations sequence 
generated by [CONTACT_199745], the study physic ian will dispense the correct 
medication to the subject (labeled “A” or “B” from the supply ).  Only the research pharmacist and data manager 
will be aware of medication condition.  After each study visit, the clinician and subject will complete a 
questionnaire asking them to guess the study condition (real vs. placebo) along with a confidence rating on a 
Likert scale (0=complete guess; 10=absolutely sure).  Any scores of 10 on the confidence scale will be 
investigated.  If a problem is detected, it  will be corrected under the advisement of the Medical Monitor .  
Blinding will be broken for any emergencies or with any recommendation from the Medical Monitor after review 
of adverse events or serious adverse events.   
4.6 Buprenorphine stabilization and  gabapentin induction (2 weeks)  
Subjects who tolerate buprenorphine induction and choose to continue in the study  will be randomized in a 
double- blind fashion to gabapentin or placebo and enter a 2 -week buprenorphine stabilization/gabapentin

to balance pain relief, withdrawal relief and sedation to set a buprenorphine "stabilizing dose."  Dose changes 
are to be determined after the study staff obtains vital signs , evaluation of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] (urine and self -report),  
craving, signs and symptoms of opi[INVESTIGATOR_199680] -medication, adverse events and current 
buprenorphine and other medication taken since the last visit. Subjects will also be titrated on 
gabapentin/ placebo according to the suggested titration schedule (split doses), which can be adjusted by [CONTACT_199747].  Subjects will be provided with a 7 day take- home supply of buprenorphine 
and gabapentin, and receive weekly urine toxicol ogy. Compliance with medication doses will be assessed via 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_10685], UDS, and self -report.  Buprenorphine and gabapentin will be dispensed and monitored throughout 
the study . 
4.7 Buprenorphine Tapering Phase (8 weeks)  
An 8-week buprenorphine taper will be assigned 
based on stabilizing dose determined in the 2 week 
stabilization period.   All subjects will be maintained 
on gabapentin during the buprenorphine taper.  
Subjects will be provided with a 7 day take- home 
supply of buprenorphine and gabapentin, and 
receive a weekly urine toxicology (and at 
completion).  During the taper, subjects will continue 
weekly medication management (15 min) and CBT 
for pain (45 min)  with the study physician for support 
and to review critical issues or problem areas .  If the 
participant wants to taper more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_199681], 
they will discuss with study physician.  If in 
agreement, the taper change will be noted and dose 
adjustments can be made, but all tapers must 
complete by [CONTACT_4475] [ADDRESS_238178] of in-
person meeting (medications would need to be distributed in advance or taper adjusted accordingly ).  
Prescription Drug Monitoring Data will be checked weekly.   The following standard supportive medications for 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_199682] (and assessed for self -reported use and pi[INVESTIGATOR_199683] ): (1) 
clonidine 0.1mg every 8 hours as needed for withdrawal; (2) cyclobenzaprine 5mg every 8 hours as needed for 
pain; (3) dicyclomine 20mg every 8 hours as needed for GI upset. All supportive medications will be tracked 
(type and dose utilized) to allow for statistical control and to track as an ancillary outcome measure.  
4.7 Gabapentin taper 
All subjects will be 
maintained on gabapentin or 
placebo throughout the 
buprenorphine tapering period and receive a 7- day gabapentin or placebo taper starting after buprenorphine

6.0 Study D rug Management  
6.1 Dosing During Taper  
Taper guidelines are provided in Section 4. 7. The study medical clinician m ay deviate from the guidelines and 
individualize the taper to the extent indicated by [CONTACT_199752] (missed doses, emergent  
withdrawal signs, etc.) but the taper must be completed within the specified timeframe, and the dosing 
schedule recorded on the appropriate form.

increased dosage.  Participants receiving buprenorphine will be instructed to hold the tablet(s) under their 
tongue until the tablet(s) have completely dissolved. This may take several minutes. The tablet(s) should not 
be swallowed.  
6.3 Drug Packaging/Handling/Storage/Accountability  
Buprenorphine is available as a sublingual tablet in two doses: 2 mg and 8 mg. Buprenorphine will be obtained 
through MUSCs Narcotic Vault ( narcotic -[EMAIL_3925] ) by [CONTACT_199753] a C -III: copy of DEA registration, copy of DHEC registration, Authorization Signature [CONTACT_108798], MUSC 
Controlled Substance Purchase Requisition Form .  Accura te recording of all buprenorphine received,  
dispensed, administered, returned, or destroyed will be made.   Buprenorphine will be stored in the PIs locked 
narcotic cabinet at MUSCs Institute of Psychiatry, room 104H in accordance with the PIs registered res earch 
DEA  and stored at 25ºC (77ºF), with excursions permitted to [ADDRESS_238187] Thomas, MUSCs  Controlled Substance Investigator.  
Gabapentin/placebo will be obtained and dispensed through Pi[INVESTIGATOR_199695], SC .  The 
study pharmacist will prepare the gabapentin and placebo and will dispense pre -ordered batches labeled as 
“A” and “B” to the study physician, with the assignment of med vs placebo to either A or B blind to the study 
physician.  The pharmacist will retain the assignment and also give it to the study statistician in a sealed 
envelope in the event that the blind needs to be broken.  Only the study pharmacist and study statistician will 
know the assignment of the gabapentin or placebo.  Each participant  who is enrolled in Phase II of the study  
will be dispensed gabapentin or placebo.  
Non-controlled withdrawal medications (clonidine, dicyclomine, cyclobenzaprine) will be obtained through 
MUSCs Pharmacy Procurement Center ( pharm -[EMAIL_3926]) .

steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs, antidepressants) and/or nonpharmacologic treatments (e.g., acupuncture, 
physical therapy, hypnosis) to assist them w ith their pain. This trial will not  restrict the use of concomitant 
medications used by a participant’s outside physician for pain management with the exception of gabapentin or 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. Concomitant treatments will be assessed at each scheduled visit and r ecorded.  
v11, 3 -1-2018    16 7.2 Medications Allowed During the Trial  
Prior to study initiation (induction) participants should not have taken or been administered any opi[INVESTIGATOR_199697] [ADDRESS_238190] the option to receive ancillary withdrawal comfort medications before the induction and 
during the tapering portion of the protocol.  Use of any medications will be recorded .  Each participant will be 
instructed on the use of each medication prescribed and told they can self -administer the medication in 
accordance with the instructions. The use of ancillary medications will be closely monitored for the duration of 
the study. Prescribing of ancillary medications will be at the physician’s discretion in accordance with clinical 
need to assist with the management of withdrawal signs and symptoms during taper but should be limited only 
to those medications listed below.  All supportive medications will be tracked (type and dose utilized) to allow 
for statistical control and to track as an ancillary outcome measure.  The following list provides the dose, 
schedule and indication for withdrawal ancillary medication use:  
For general withdrawal: clonidine 0.1mg  every 8 hours as needed  
For muscle pain: cyclobenzaprine 5mg every 8 hours as needed  
For GI upset: dicyclomine 20mg every 8 hours as needed  
If the physician feels additional medications are needed for symptoms related to withdrawal, the following 
medications can be prescribed (but they will not be provided through the study):  
• For anxiety and restlessness: hydroxyzine hydrochloride 50 mg , po q6 hrs prn; not to exceed 200 mg 
per 24 hrs  
• For bone pain and arthralgia: non -steroidal anti -inflammatory agent (NSAID) such as  ibuprofen (Advil,

testing.  
9.3 Clinical Assessments (e.g. Medical History and Physical /Psychiatric  Exam) 
The study medical clini cian (or other qualified medical study staff) will complete a physical /psychiatric  
examination to help determine eligibility. The physical exam will also ensure that there are no medical  
concerns regarding participation and to gather baseline information abou t the participant’s health. The physical 
examination will be repeated at the end of buprenorphine induction visit and weekly during the buprenorphine 
taper  phase.  Pertinent laboratory  tests ( CMP , UPT ) will be reviewed.  Participants with abnormal laboratory 
values will be notified and counseled to seek medical evaluation and care.  For participants receiving opi[INVESTIGATOR_199701], the study medical clinician will consult with the participant’s prescribing physician to ensure that 
the participant is appropriate to parti cipate in this protocol; e.g., that the participant’s pain is not due to an 
underlying malignancy or that further diagnostic testing is not needed to determine the source of the pain.  
9.[ADDRESS_238195] ug screen cards will be used to identify the following 
substances: oxycodone, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651],  THC,  buprenorphine, methadone, cocaine, amphetamine, 
methamphetamine, propoxyphene, PCP, barbiturates, MDMA , TCAs and the Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2573] 300 group  analytes  
(morphine, heroin, and codeine). Other drugs may be detected by [CONTACT_199754]. For 
example, hydrocodone may be detected under the oxycodone test at high concentration levels. The cups also 
include adulterant testing for creatinine,  nitrite, pH, bleach and specific gravity.  The results will be recorded on 
the appropriate CRF.   If the subject’s buprenorphine screen is positive at completion of the taper, t hey will be 
asked to return in [ADDRESS_238196] 30 days  of opi[INVESTIGATOR_173942]. The use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], other drugs of abuse, and alcohol will be recorded. A urine drug  screen will be 
performed at each of these visits as well  as week 11 (if necessary) and all follow -up visits . 
9.4.3 Buprenorphine Tolerance Form  
v11, 3 -1-2018    21 During the induction onto buprenorphine, the physician will fill out the Buprenorphine Tolerance form to 
determine outcome and eligibility for Phase II.  
9.4.4 State Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) Data  
At baseline, at each study visit, and at months 1,3, 6,  and 12,  the study physician will check the subject’s 
PDMP data and record results on the appropriate CRF.   
9.4.5  Clinical Opi[INVESTIGATOR_199702] (COWS)  
The C linical Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2433] (COWS) is an 11- item scale designed to be administered by a clinician. 
This tool can be used in both inpatient and outpatient settings to reproducibly rate common signs and 
symptoms of opi[INVESTIGATOR_199703]. The summed score for the complete 
scale can be used to help clinicians determine the stage or severity of opi[INVESTIGATOR_199704]. This will be administered before and dur ing buprenorphine induction and 
weekly during Phase II.

event reporting, and concomitant  medications use.  
9.5.1 Adverse events (AEs)  and Serious adverse events (SAEs)  
Adverse events  will be monitored during the study. An AE i s defined as any reaction, side effect, or untoward 
event that occurs during the course of the clinical trial, whether or not the event is  considered medication-  or 
study -related or clinically significant. For this study AEs will include events reported by [CONTACT_2299]. A new 
illness, symptom, sign, or worsening of a pre- existing  condition or abnormality is considered an AE. Stable 
chronic conditions , such as arthritis, which are present prior to clinical trial entry and do not worsen are not 
considered AEs. All AEs must be recorded on the AE CRF (Case Report Form). The AE CRF is also used to 
record follow -up information for unresolved events reported  on previous visits. Each AE will be classified by [CONTACT_199755]- serious and appropriate reporting procedures followed.  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) are defined as any fatal event, any immediately life -threatening event, any 
permanent or substantially disabling event, any event that requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], any  congenital 
anomaly, or any event that required intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes.

9.7 Pain and Other Assessments  
9.7.1 Brief Pain Inventory  
The Brief Pain Inventory -SF (BPI; Cleeland & Ryan, 1994) is a 9- item assessment of intensity of pain and 
interference of pain in life. Originally developed for cancer pain, it is widely used to assess  nonmalignant acute 
and chronic pain (Tan, Jensen, Thornby & Shanti, 2004).  The complete BPI -SF will be collected at baseline, 
pre- and post -induction, during each visit in Phase 2 and follow -up.  In addition to verbal patient report of pain, 
these items will permit study  clinicians to monitor for any clinical deterioration in pain status that may require 
collaboration with prescribing physician, follow-up and/or referral.  
9.7.2 VAS- Pain 
Before and after buprenorphine induction, subjects will be asked to rate their pain on a scale of 0- 10. 
9.7.3  Pain Laboratory Testing Procedures  
Laboratory Pain Procedures ( Quantitative Sensory Testing; QST) will be performed at baseline and at visit s 
week 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 and month 1, 6, and 12  in Phase II.  
1.  Mechanical (Pressure) Pain Threshold Assessment (PPTh):  A digital anesthesiometer (IITC Life Sciences 
ElectroVonFrey) will be used to assess mechanical pain perception. Pain threshold to static mechanical stimuli 
will be determined by [CONTACT_199756]’s right hand with 
increasing pressure (10 grams per second) until the participant indicates verbally that the pain threshold has 
been reached. Participants will rate the intensity and unpleasantness using a computerized visual analog scale 
(CVAS).  
2.  Diffuse Noxious Inhibitory Controls (DNIC):  Baseline mechanical pain threshold w ill be assessed on the 
right brachioradialis or right trapezius in random order  as above.  Immediately following this “baseline” 
assessment, participants will undergo a cold pressor task.  During the cold pressor task, each participant will 
immerse his or her contralateral hand up to the wrist in a circulating ice water bath maintained at 4.5  degrees C  
(40 degrees Fahrenheit) .  Ten seconds after starting hand immersion, PPTh will be reassessed at the same 
site of baseline assessment.  During each pain assessment session, a total of 4 DNIC tasks will be performed: 
2 trials at each anatomical site with 2 minute intervals between cold pressor tasks.  Participants will be directed 
to keep their hand in the water for the duration of the PPTh assess ment.  DNIC will be measured as the 
percent change in PPTh during the cold pressor tasks relative to baseline.  An increase in PPTh during cold 
pressor reflects normal functioning of pain- inhibitory processes.  
3.  Controlling for General Physiological Arousal:  During the laboratory pain procedures, subjects will be 
hooked -up to an Avant 2120 Pulse Oximeter with non- invasive blood- pressure measurement capabilities. 
Heart rate, pulse oximetry readings and blood pressure will be recorded during the procedure t o determine if 
effects on pain are associated with any changes in cardiovascular activity . These are important processes to 
track in order to rule- out potential confounds of general physiological arousal and changes in pain perception.  
9.7.4 Beck Depression Inventory II  
This 21 -item scale (Beck et al., 1961) assesses common features of depression on a 4- point severity scale, 
with a focus on cognitions. It is widely used in both drug and psychosocial treatment studies of  depression, and 
v11, 3 -1-2018    23 is commonly used in studies of pain (Dworkin et al., 2005). The BDI will be collected at baseline and week s 2, 
6, 11 and M onth 1 follow -up.  
9.7.5 SF-36 
The SF -36 version 2 is a 36- item, participant administered instrument examining health- related quality of life 
changes as a function of treatment (Ware and Sherbourne, 1992). Most items are rated on a 5 -point scale. The 
SF-36 v. 2 will be completed at baseline and Weeks 4, 8, 11 and M onths 1 and 12  during Phase II.  
9.7.6 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272] (PSQI)  
The PSQI is a 19 item self -report questionnaire that assesses sleep quality over a 1 -month time interval. The 
measure consists of  19 individual items, creating 7 components that produce one global score, and takes 5- 10 
minutes to complete.  This will be administered at baseline and Week s 2, 8 and 11 of Phase II.  
9.7.7 Patient Health Questionnaire –  15 (PHQ -15) 
The PHQ -15 is a brief,  self-administered questionnaire that may be useful in screening for somatization and in 
monitoring somatic symptom severity in clinical practice and research.  This will be per formed at baseline.  
9.7.8 PROMIS SF 10  
The PROMIS SF 10 is a 10- item scale that  evaluates self -report of general health, mental health, physical 
activity and quality of life.  This will be performed at baseline, and Weeks 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, and Months 1, 6, and 
12. 
9.8 Treatment Compliance 
Medication compliance will be measured using pi[INVESTIGATOR_199708]. Treatment participation will 
be measur ed in the follow -up treatment visit CRF.  
Participation in medical and psychosocial treatment and self -help outside of the study will be captu red on a 
concomitant treatment CRF.  
9.9 Common Assessment Battery (CAB)  
9.9.1 Brief Demographics Form  
Basic demographic information assessing for age, ethnicity/race,  and gender will be collected at baseline.   
9.9.2 Locator Information  
Basic locator  data will be collected and kept confidential in the participant’s record. Locator information typi[INVESTIGATOR_199709], or  an address of someone who knows where to 
contact [CONTACT_199757], and a phone number where they can be reached. Additional 
information includes the names and addresses of two or three individuals who would likely know their 
whereabouts, particularly relatives or close friends. This information will be obtained at bas eline and will be 
updated as necessary. This information will be used to facilitate contact [CONTACT_199758] -up. 
9.9.3  Current Opi[INVESTIGATOR_85581] (COMM)  
The COMM is a 17- item scale validated in chronic pain patients us ed to identify aberrant behaviors associated 
with risk for misuse of opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007]. A cut -off score of 9 or greater identifies 77% of those at high risk for 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_199710] (non- addicted, whereas those with a score of 13 or greater identifies patients w ith an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2428] (sensitivity 77%, specificity 77%).  The  COMM will be administered at baseline.  
9.9.4  Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)  
v11, 3 -1-2018    24 The PCS is a 13 -item sc ale that was developed to help quantify an individual's pain experience, asking about 
how they feel and what they think about when they are in pain. Compared to other ways of measuring pain-
related thoughts, this questionnaire is unique in that the individual does not need to be in pain while completing 
it. This will be measured at baseline.  
9.9.5 Controlled Preference Scale (CPS)  
The CPS is a context domain, card sort instrument that assesses preferences regarding participation in health 
care decisions f or people with life threatening illnesses. This will be administered at baseline.  
9.9.6  Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Questionnaire  
The ACE Questionnaire is a [ADDRESS_238201] statistic. Fo llowing completion of the study , estima tes of the proportions (and 
associated 95% confidence intervals) of participants that successfully completed opi[INVESTIGATOR_199635] [ADDRESS_238202] taper. Model based estimates will be 
compar ed between those who were randomized to gabapentin vs. placebo using Generalized Estimating 
Equations for correlated binary outcomes ( treatment phase  cohort).  Additionally, generalized linear models will 
be used to investigate clini cal and demographic cor relates of treatment success using baseline and 
longitudinal study characteristics while controlling for adjunctive medication use. Following the analysis of the 
treatment phase cohort, a complementary analysis will compare opi[INVESTIGATOR_199711] . Secondary outcomes such as medication compliance and 
withdrawal symptoms will be tracked longitudinally over time.  As selection into the treatment phase  cohort was 
not randomiz ed, a full anal ysis of covariates associated with the cohort assignment will be done and those 
predictive of assignment will be included in model development and tested f or possible effect modification.   
10.2 Power and Sample Size 
The primary aim of the proposed study is to investigate the proportion of subjects enrolled into a buprenorphine 
taper who discontinue use of COT- P. The study aims to estimate the precision of the efficacy estimate by 
[CONTACT_199759], the 95% confidence interval for 
each study treatment group (gabapentin vs. placebo), and the difference between groups. The lower bound of 
the 95% confidence interval around each estimate will be used to inform larger randomized trials of efficacy.  
The induction phase  of the proposed study is to determine the proportion of subjects maintained on COT- P 
who tolerate transition to buprenorphine using a one- day outpatient protocol.  Based on a small pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] a 
COT -P participants (n=12), 58% (7/12) tol erated buprenorphine initiation and 71% of those that tolerated the 
study drug completed the taper (5/7)65.  Of a feasible sample of 150 partici pants screened for tolerance (using 
target morphine dose equivalents), we anticipate 50- 60% (n=75- 90) will toler ate the study drug and be 
randomized into the treatment phase of the study .  The detectible margin of erro r varies with the proportion that 
succeeds in discontinuation of opi[INVESTIGATOR_199712], with greater margins associated with proportions 
near 50 % (most conservative).  With an estimated base rate of 50% of COT -P subjects who successfully 
v11, [ADDRESS_238203] a margin of error from the overall study 
proportion and lower 95% confidence interval between 0.09 ( n=90) and 0.10 (n=75).   Based on pi[INVESTIGATOR_199713] a similar population, we anticipate 30% attrition in the treatment phase study population65.  With 
attrition, we are powered to detect a slightly wider margin of error of between 0.095 (n=90) and 0.105 (n =75).  
In the analysis of the effect of gabapentin versus placebo in the treatment phase cohort , assuming an overall 
rate of 50% of COT -P subjects who successfully discontinue opi[INVESTIGATOR_199714], [ADDRESS_238204] a margin of error in the difference and lower 95% confidence 
interval of 0.20 (n=45 per group).  When accounting for possibly high attrition, with 70% retention, we will be 
able to detect a lower limit of the 95% confidence interval of 0.24 below the true proportion of the group 
difference.  
11.0 Protection of Human Subjects and Data Safety Monitoring Plan  
11.1 Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
This study will include and recruit women and minorities. Based on previous and ongoing research efforts at 
MUSC within prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_45155], we anticipate that approximately 50% of the subjects recruited will be 
women. We will make every effort to recruit and retain women into the study.  Charleston's population is 
currently 64% Caucasian and 34 % African -American, with African Americans representing the only minority 
group of any large number in South Carolina.  However, it is estimated, based on previous and ongoing 
research efforts in prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_199715], that approximately 20% 
of the subjects will identify themselves in a minority group.  Every effort will be made to recruit and retain 
minority individuals in the study.  We will also utilize the South Carolina Clinical and Translational Research 
Institute’s (SCTR) Research Support Services (SUCCESS) Center’s Recruitment Core in order to ensure 
adequate numbers of males, females and minorities.  
11.[ADDRESS_238205] any medical or psychiatric 
condition that would preclude safe or meaningful participation (e.g. traumatic brain injury; severe mental 
illness; severe cardiac, renal, pulmonary, or liver disease); current use of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_199716]; or 
maintenance on fentanyl or methadone.  During each clinic visit of the treatment phase, subjects will be asked 
about adverse events and have vital signs taken.  Patients will not receive medication if they have any signs or 
symptoms that may pose a safety issue with either trial medication.  All adverse events during the study will be 
collected, documented and reported to the PI.  The occurrence of A Es will be assessed at screening/ baseline, 
and at each clinic visit during the treatment phase of the study and again during any follow -up visits.  All AEs 
are reviewed weekly by [CONTACT_978] (new or continuing), quarterly by [CONTACT_1689].  All AEs will be assessed 
to determine if they meet the criteria for an SAE.  Any SAE  (meeting reporting criteria)  will be reported within 
48 hours in writing to the MUSC IRB, NIDA (via SAETRS), and the FDA.  Initial and follow -up of any SAEs will 
also be reported to these three agencies.  For each AE/SAE recorded, the research staff will follow the 
AE/SAE until resolution or stabilization.  A subject may have their medication discontinued or may be 
withdrawn from the study if the investigator determines it is the best de cision in order to protect the safety of a 
participant.  In the event that a subject withdraws or is discontinued from the study due to an SAE, the patient 
will have appropriate follow -up medical monitoring.  Monitoring will continue until the problem has 
resolved/stabilized with no further change expected, is clearly unrelated to study medication, or results in 
v11, [ADDRESS_238206] one or more indications for opi[INVESTIGATOR_199717], which places them in a higher risk category for adverse events in general.  The following are the 
expected risks in this study:  
1.  Discomfort from opi[INVESTIGATOR_43351]:   It is necessary to be in moderate opi[INVESTIGATOR_199718].  To minimize the discomfort, subjects will be provided with standard symptomatic 
medications detailed in the protocol to relieve those symptoms of withdrawal.  It is expected that withdrawal 
symptoms will be temporary until buprenorphine is initiated.  Subjects will be provided with extensive 
supportive counseling prior to and while undergoi ng withdrawal.  
2.  Precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2613]:   Induction on buprenorphine comes with risk of precipi[INVESTIGATOR_199719], and 
every step will be taken to minimize this risk (by [CONTACT_199760], fentanyl, or on opi[INVESTIGATOR_199720] 200  morphine equivalents), ensuring patients are in moderate withdrawal before induction, and 
discontinuing long- acting opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] 24 hours before induction.   
3. Side effects to buprenorphine:   The following are the expected adverse events (and frequency, over 5%) 
related to buprenorphine (from package insert for Suboxone, which includes rates for buprenorphine alone): 
headache (29%), insomnia (21%), pain (18%), withdrawal syndrome (18%), nausea (14%), sweating (13%), 
pain in abdomen (12%), infection (12%), rhinitis (10%), pain in back (8%), chills (8%), constipation (8%), and 
vomiting (8%).  Expected adverse events will be closely monitored and recorded, and subjects will be able to 
discontinue the study at any time due to an adverse event.  Supportive medications will be used or suggested 
to assist with treatable adverse events (e.g. bisacodyl for constipation).  
4.  Side effects to gabapentin:   The following are the expected adverse events (and frequency, over 5%) 
related to gabapentin (from package insert for N eurontin): dizziness (28%), somnolence (21.4%), peripheral 
edema (8.3%), asthenia (5.7%), diarrhea (5.7%), infection (5.1%).  Expected adverse events will be closely 
monitored and recorded and subjects will be able to discontinue the study at any time due to an adverse event, 
Supportive medications will be used or suggested to assist with treatable adverse events (e.g. loperamide for 
diarrhea).  
5.  Side effects of buprenorphine + gabapentin:   In a population that received this dose of gabapentin (vs. 
placebo) while undergoing a buprenorphine taper (n=30) (Sanders et al 2013), the following adverse events 
were noted: nausea/vomiting (gabapentin: n=2; placebo: n=1); somnolence (gabapentin: n=2, placebo: n=0); 
sleep disturbance (gabapentin: n=2, placebo: n=0); loss of motor skills (gabapentin: n=1; placebo: n=0); fatigue 
(gabapentin: n=1, placebo: n=0), and lightheadedness (gabapentin: n=1, placebo: n=0).  All events were mild 
and did not require intervention, except for lightheadedness.  Although vital signs were within the normal 
range, the gabapentin titration was kept at a lower dose to be conservative.  
6.  Side effects from buprenorphine + benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]:  The combination of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_199721], 
including buprenorphine, can result in respi[INVESTIGATOR_199722].  However, 
a recent FDA Drug Safety Report (9/20/17) explains that buprenorphine products should not be withheld from 
patients solely because they are on benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651].  For this reason, we will include subjects who are on 
prescribed stable doses of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_199723] 6 months w ith no evidence of sedation.  Our induction 
regimen is very conservative with regards to induction dosing, and all subjects will be closely monitored for 
sedation.  
 7.  Suicidal Ideation:  Antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_006] (AEDs), including gabapentin, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or 
behavior in patients taking these medications for  any indication. In this study, subjects will be assessed three 
times a week for worsening mood, suicidal thoughts or behavior by [CONTACT_3476].  Should depression or 
v11, 3 -1-2018    27 suicidal thoughts/behavior emerge during the study, the subject will be immediately eval uated by [CONTACT_978], board-
certified psychiatrist, to determine appropriate recommendations for treatment (inpatient, outpatient, intensive 
outpatient) and safety planning. Coordination of care will occur with the referring/prescribing physician to 
ensure proper follow -up and monitoring.   
8.  Respi[INVESTIGATOR_199724]:   To minimize this risk, current use of illicit or unstable  dose of  
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], alcohol, or active/history of sedative- hypnotic use disorder will be exclusion criteria for the 
study.  Additionally, on the day of buprenorphine initiation, subjects will be monitored for up to [ADDRESS_238207] for the use of other opi[INVESTIGATOR_199725].  
Subjects will be terminated from the study if sedation or respi[INVESTIGATOR_199726] (if symptoms are moderate- severe) or monitored until resolution (if symptoms 
are mild).    
9.  Worsening pain/clinical deterioration:   Buprenorphine, a partial mu opi[INVESTIGATOR_2641], can provide variable pain 
relief to those with chronic pain.  Although most studies show an improvement in pain with buprenorphine 
initiation, should the subject's pain worsen after buprenorphine initiation or during taper, subjects will have the 
opportunity to exit  the study and resume their previous treatment.  Any effects of buprenorphine in worsening 
pain control should be temporary and wear -off within [ADDRESS_238208] participation, and any clinical issues 
that arise.  Drs. Barth and Brady, both of whom are reachable by [CONTACT_199761], will monitor participants 
for ps ychiatric and medical stability.  In addition, there will be a Medical Monitor who will review any adverse 
events occurring during the study on a quarterly basis.  
The following safety precautions will be utilized to minimize risks/harms:  
Laboratory pain testing : For mechanical stimulation procedures, the range of von Frey Hair weights to be used 
for stimulation will be incapable of breaking the skin or causing any tissue damage. The study is set up to test 
for thresholds, so when a subject feels any pain, the stimulus will immediately stop.  
Confidentiality:  Every effort will be made to ensure that health information will be collected and stored in a 
manner that ensures the highest level of protection of confidentiality, including coding all study material and 
keepi[INVESTIGATOR_199727].  All interviews and procedures will be 
performed in a private office at MUSC generally used for private medical interviews. Each subject will be 
assigned a code number which will be used t o identify all collected data. The key for the code numbers will be 
kept in a separate locked cabinet from the study data in a locked office, accessible only by [CONTACT_978].  Data 
management and statistical analysis will be done with coded material only. This s tudy involves healthy 
participants who will be entering the Institute of Psychiatry. If they are seen by [CONTACT_199762], they will be 
able to share that they are participating as a healthy control in a research study, if they feel so inclined.  Study 
data collected will be stored in the following locations:  in a locked office, in a locked cabinet, in a password 
protected office computer and password protected network storage.  
Buprenorphine Initiation:  To minimize the risks of buprenorphine initiation, we will be taking the following 
precautions: (1) selecting individuals within a certain opi[INVESTIGATOR_199728], (2) 
selecting subjects without major medical or psychiatric c o-morbidities, (3) providing close medical supervision 
in the week preceding the initiation and up to a full day of medical supervision the day of the initiation, (4) 
requiring that subjects have transportation available the day of buprenorphine initiation and not be operating 
any heavy machinery, (5) excluding individuals on illicit or unstable doses of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_199729] 
v11, 3 -1-2018    28 sedatives as well as those on fentanyl of methadone, (6) conducting the induction in the Research Nexus or 
physician’s office , (7 ) completing a physical exam and laboratory evaluation prior to buprenorphine initiation, 
(8) allowing subjects to stop the study at any time and resume their previous level of care, (9) coordinating with 
the subject's opi[INVESTIGATOR_74527], if applicable, benzodiaze pi[INVESTIGATOR_199730] , 
(10) providing cognitive behavioral therapy for pain, (11) providing patient education about the risks of 
buprenorphine overdose, especially in combination with sedatives or alcohol, (12) obtai ning weekly urine 
toxicology for opi[INVESTIGATOR_199731].  For 
those on stable doses of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_199723] 6 months duration who are unable or unwilling to safely 
taper off benz odiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_199732], it has been shown that buprenorphine can safely be used with 
stable doses of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], as reported in a recent FDA Drug Safety Communication (attached).  Our 
initiation protocol is very conservative using 2mg buprenor phine induction, we provide education about using 
caution with benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_199733], and we monitor closely for sedation throughout the study.  
Gabapentin initiation/maintenance/taper:  To minimize the risk of poor tolerance of initial gabapent in titration, 
our proposed titration is more gradual than that which was already demonstrated to be well -tolerated in a 
sample of 30 subjects undergoing buprenorphine taper (Sanders, et al). We will monitor for worsening mood or 
suicidal thoughts/behavior once a week and review all adverse events with our Medical Monitor.  Gabapentin 
taper has been well -tolerated in durations of less than one week, but we will taper gabapentin over one week 
to minimize any possible risk and maximize tolerance.  
Buprenorphine Taper/Study Termination:   To minimize the risks of buprenorphine taper, we will complete the 
above precautions with the following additions: (1) continue to coordinate with the prescribing physician during 
and at the conclusion of the taper (or study term ination), (2) medical supervision once  a week, (3) providing 
only a 1 week  supply of take -home buprenorphine to minimize the risk of diversion, (4) have a phone meeting 
with the prescribing physician should a patient terminate at which time options for sa fe pain treatment will be 
discussed, including education about decreased tolerance and increased risk of overdose should the patient 
resume opi[INVESTIGATOR_199734].  Education will be provided to patient 
and prescribing provider regarding safe re- initiation and/or tapering of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2538].  
Students and Employees:   Students and employees are eligible for this study.  It will be clearly discussed that 
there is no obligation to participate in this study, consequence for not participating, and confidentiality will be 
maintained.  
Use of buprenorphine and gabapentin in elderly populations:   
Gabapentin: The total number of patients treated with gabapentin in controlled clinical trials in patients with 
postherpetic  neuralgia was 336, of which 102 (30%) were 65 to 74 years of age, and 168 (50%) were [ADDRESS_238209] observed in patients ≥75 years may be a consequence of increased 
gabapentin exposure for a given dose that results from an age- related decrease in renal function. How ever, 
other factors cannot be excluded. The types and incidence of adverse reactions were similar across age 
groups except for peripheral edema and ataxia, which tended to increase in incidence with age.  We are 
following package insert recommendations for  cautious dosing for all subjects, starting at the low end of the 
dosing range.  We are also only including subjects with normal renal (GFR>/=60) and hepatic function 
(LFTs<5x upper limit of normal).  Renal dosing for gabapentin for GFR ≥60 = 900 to 3600mg/ day.  In clinical 
studies, efficacy for neuralgia was demonstrated over a range of doses from 1800 mg/day to 3600 mg/day with 
comparable effects across the dose range; however, in these clinical studies, the additional benefit of using 
doses greater than 1800 mg/day was not demonstrated.  In this study, we are limiting the m ax dose to 
1600mg/day  gabapentin.  
v11, 3 -1-2018    29 Buprenorphine: Clinical studies of SUBOXONE sublingual tablets, SUBOXONE (buprenorphine and naloxone) 
sublingual film, or SUBUTEX (buprenorphine) sublingual tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects 
aged 65 and over to determine whether they responded differently than younger subjects. Other reported 
clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and young er patients. In 
general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing 
range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant 
disease or other d rug therapy.  In this study,  we do start buprenorphine dosing at the low end of dosing , and 
we are excluding patients with renal or liver disease, or any other medical condition or concomitant drug 
therapy (e.g. unstable or illicit benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]) , that w ould put them at increased risk with buprenorphine.   
Given opi[INVESTIGATOR_199735], it is not 
warranted to exclude healthy elderly individuals that otherwise qualify for the study based  exclusively on age, 
so the upper limit of age cut -off for this study will be set at 70 years of age.  
Unknown Risks:  The experimental treatments may have unknown side effects. The researchers will inform 
subjects immediately if any information learned mig ht cause subjects to reconsider participation in the study.  
Should it become apparent that the subject has a medical or psychiatric issue, appropriate referrals will be 
made for treatment.  Any adverse events will be reported to the IRB.   
Populations vul nerable to coercion/influence:   In order to minimize the risk to subjects vulnerable to coercion or 
undue influence, we are ensuring prior to study entry that all subjects have an active opi[INVESTIGATOR_199736] (including opi[INVESTIGATOR_199737]) should the initiation/taper not be successful.  [CONTACT_199768] currently manages 50 outpatients on chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_199738] a clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_29426] 
(Comprehensive Pain Management Program, CPMP)  at MUSC (10% effort , Wednesday afternoons) ).  To 
eradicate the possibility of conflict of interest, coercion or undue influence, [CONTACT_199769] will not recruit for this 
study from her CPMP clinical population.  All referrals to the study will come from providers other than [CONTACT_199768], and the subjects can  return to that provider’s care upon completion of the study.   
11.[ADDRESS_238210]. Barth (PI) and [CONTACT_199770] (Medical Monitor) have no current conflicts of interest in performing or monitoring 
this research.  Each physician is reviewed yearly by [CONTACT_199763].  If a potential 
conflict of interest becomes apparent, this will be addressed under the guidance of MUSC’s IRB by [CONTACT_199764] (in the case of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_151596]), or if it cannot be removed (in the case of the 
Medical Monitor), to change the Medical Monitor.

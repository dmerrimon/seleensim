Objectives : To e valuate, in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_510136],  efficacy and tolerability of electrical counter -
stimulation using the Scrambler device in alleviating uncomfortable sensations and urge 
to move in patients with restless legs syndrome/Willis Ekbom Disease (RLS/WED).  
 
Hypothese s: Electrical stimulation  applied to the lower extremities using the Scrambler 
device will improve discomfort and alleviate urge to move in patients with RLS/WED. 
This form of therapy will be well -tolerated and without significant side effects.  
 
 
Background Information:  
 
Clinical Description of RL S/WED  
Restless legs syndrome/ Willis Ekbom Disease (RLS/WED) is characterized by [CONTACT_752678]. Symptoms occur in the evening and nighttime hours
1. It is estimated that 7.2% of the Western population has  RLS/WED, with 2.7% of 
the population experiencing moderate to severe symptoms.  
 RLS/WED has a significant negative impact on quality of life and is associated with anxiety and depression.  Patients often experience significant sleep fragmentation due to symptoms which leads to daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_423302], cognitive symptoms, and loss of productivity at work
2.  
 One-third of RLS/WED patients require daily pharmacologic therapy to manage 
symptoms
3. Patients with refractory symptoms often require multiple drugs of different 
classes4. Adverse effects from the most common agents used in treating RLS/WED 
include: drowsiness, dizziness, unsteadiness, weight gain, depression, augmentation, and development of impulse control disorders
5-7. 
 
Nonpharmacologic modalities are an important means of  treating symptoms. Many 
nonpharmacologic strategies  are based on counter -stimulation  techniques  to mask 
RLS/WED symptoms  such as  warm baths and massage.  Sequential compression 
devices have been shown to be helpful in alleviating sym ptoms8.  Nonpharmacologic 
counterstimulation modalities may be an important means of reducing medication 
burden in patients with RLS/WED and complementing  pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_752670].  
 
Electrical Stimulation in the management of centrally driven neurogenic pain  
Electrical stimulation has been utilized as an intervention in treatment of various forms 
of neurogenic pain (including peripheral neuropathy, trigeminal neuralgia, and m ultiple 
sclerosis) .  Much of the published data involves use of transcutaneous electrical nerve 
stimulation (TENS). TENS appears to work to reduce pain through both central and 
peripheral mechanisms.  Animal and clinical studies demonstrate that the electr ical 
impulses have a local effect on peripheral nerves to reduce pain at area of application. There also appear to be effects on central nervous system pathways (periaqueductal gray, medulla, and spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]) thus reducing pain at sites outside of the area of 
stimulation
9,10.  The opi[INVESTIGATOR_752671] .  
These receptors are also targeted by [CONTACT_752679][INVESTIGATOR_752672].  There are no good data regarding the efficacy of TENS for RLS.  
  Scrambler Therapy is a specific form of electrical stimulation which has also been 
utilized in chronic neurogenic pai n
11. This modality of therapy differs from TENS in that 
the goal is to mediate the patient’s perception of pain, rather than masking the peripheral pain signal. The results of this modality of treatment may be longer -lasting 
than TENS, presumably via reduction in central signal generation. Scrambler therapy works through C fibers to retrain the peripheral sensation in the area being treated. Further description of  this technology is available at: International Patent 
PCT/IT2007/[ADDRESS_1030432] shown that electrical stimulation using Scrambler Therapy is an effective method of treating chronic neurogenic pain. Table 1 reviews the literature 
regarding the use of Scrambler Therapy in over 800 patients. Treatment is well tolerated and without significant side effec ts.  
 
Electrical stimulation as a potential treatment of RLS/WED  
Most patients with RLS/WED experience discomfort in the lower limbs which is described using terminology including: crawling, tingling, restless, electric, tension, and itching
12. The peripheral discomfort  localized to the lower extremities  in RLS/WED 
appears to be  driven by a central mechanism.  Functional neuroimaging studies have 
elucidated that RLS/WED stems from striatal dopaminergic dysfunction13,14. This is 
corroborated by [CONTACT_752680]
15.  The above data demonstrating efficacy of electrical 
stimulation in other forms of centrally -mediated neurogenic pain, would suggest that this 
modality may also be an effective treatment in RLS/WED.  
 
Significance:  If electrical stimulation via Scrambler Therapy is effective in alleviating  
discomfort associated with RLS/WED, this may represent a novel  nonpharmacologic 
modality of managing symptoms.  Negative results will also be clinically useful in 
guiding strategies in the treatment of RLS/WED.  
 
Proposed Study Design: Prospective, interventional, pi[INVESTIGATOR_750336]:  
• Male patients age [ADDRESS_1030433] -menopausal women (or women who are 
not of child- bearing potential) diagnosed with RLS/WED by a board certified 
sleep medicine physician within the Mayo Clinic Center for Sleep Medicine.  
• Patients must have moderate to severe symptoms which have been present for ≥ 
[ADDRESS_1030434] endorse discomfort as part of their typi[INVESTIGATOR_752673]/WED 
symptomatology.  
• Patients must experience daily symptoms and must experience  daily symptoms 
during afternoon hours ( 12-5 PM)  
• Patients on no medications  for RLS/WED , or those who have refractory 
symptoms despi[INVESTIGATOR_752674]/WED medications will be enrolled.  Patient s on alpha-2-
delta ligands (pregabalin, gabapentin) will be asked to discontinue these medications two weeks prior to starting treatments and remain off these medications throughout the study protocol.   
• Informed consent to participate in this study needs to be obtained  
 
Exclusion criteria:  
• R esearch authorization not provided  
• Patients who are asymptomatic (either by [CONTACT_752681]) at time of initiation of Scrambler Therapy treatment  
• Patients who have made changes in medication regimen during the 2 weeks prior to study initiation (including initiation of iron supplementation)  
• Prior use of  Scrambler Therapy  
• Female patients of child- bearing potential (those who are not post -menopausal or 
post-hysterectomy)  
• Patients with implantable drug delivery systems, heart stents, or metal  implants 
(including pacemakers and  defibrillators)  
• Patients with history of epi[INVESTIGATOR_752675]  
• Patients with skin conditions or wounds in or around the area of electrode 
application (lower extremities)  
• Patients treated with alpha- 2 delta ligands (gabapentin, pregabalin), who cannot 
discontinue the medications as above 
   
 
Proposed Methods:  
A total of up to [ADDRESS_1030435] been diagnosed with 
chronic RLS/WED in the Mayo Clinic Center for Sleep Medicine. Subjects  must 
experience daily symptoms  and must typi[INVESTIGATOR_752676] ( 12-5 PM).  E ach patient will complete the 
International Restless Legs Syndrome Rating Scale (IRLS), a validated scale which 
assesses severity of RLS symptoms16 at baseline (pre- treatment) and before and 
directly after each session of Scrambler Therapy . 
 Patients will r eceive Scrambler Therapy  (Appendix VI)  on a daily basis for up to [ADDRESS_1030436] on one leg. Treatments 
will be administered by a technician trained in using the Scrambler device.  A physician or nurse (with familiarity of Scrambler therapy) will be available throughout each 
treatment session.  
 Patients will complete  questionnaires regarding discomfort or other side effects 
encountered during or after treatment.  They will also complete surveys assessing for  
any changes (benefits or worsening) in RLS symptomatology between treatments.  
 Patients will be mo nitored for any adverse events associated with the study procedures. 
Any reported adverse events will be expediently classified by [CONTACT_752682], whether it relates to the treatments in the study protocol, and whether the 
event was e xpected or unexpected. This information will allow determination of whether 
or not the adverse event should be reported as an expedited report or part of the routinely reported outcomes data. All adverse events which meet criteria for expedited 
reporting  will be reported to the institutional IRB as well as external agencies as 
required.

Appendix I 
Algorithm 1: Basic Scrambler Treatment Algorithm  
 
 
 
 
 
 1. Assess/Locate Area of Pain  
• Start with area of most severe pain  
2. Place Electrodes  
 
• Place electrodes outside area of pain, in 2 D line o f pain (horizontal or vertical), and 
on the same side as pain, preferably 2 fingerbreadths outside of pain area  
• The area under electrode should be free of pain and allodynia  
• The area under the electrode should have good sensation  
 
*If the above criteria ar e not met, use Algorithm 2  
3. Begin Treatment (turn on channel)  
 
Ask 3 questions:  
• When do you feel something?  
• When do you feel a sting?  
• When do you feel maximum tolerated intensity without discomfort?  
 
*May need to turn up past sting to treat effectively  
*During process may turn up as quickly as tolerated to the maximum 
tolerated intensity after the sting  
0 pain  
Continue to treat for 30 
minutes  
*May turn up intensity if 
intensity has decreased during 
treatment and if  patient 
tolerates   Decreased pain, but >0  
 
Try again to increase 
intensity. If patient does not 
tolerate further increase 
then return to tolerable 
intensity and add anothe r 
channel (Step 1) to attempt 
zeroing pain  
OR 
If at max on machine and 
pain still>0 add another 
channel (Step 1) to attempt 
zeroing pain  No change in pain  
 
Zero machine and 
reposition electrodes  Increased 
Pain/Discomfort  
 
If increase of his/her 
pain, move one 
electrode farther  
(may mean that initial 
electrode p lacement is 
in area of pain)  
If different/new area of pain 
presents then place new set of 
electrodes using same 
algorithm  
No limit to number of 
electrodes used per  area 
 
Algorithm 2: Advanced S crambler Treatment Algorithm  
(If patient does not meet criteria for proper electrode placement)  
 
 
 
 
 Option 1: Reduce Area of Pain  
 
Place all electrodes above area of pain  
 
• For feet, place electrodes on leg above area of pain, most likely minimum o f 2 electrode sets, but may use as many as fit and are 
tolerated, or pain/tingling is zeroed  
 
• For hands, place electrodes on arm above area of pain, most likely 
minimum of 2 electrode sets, but may use as many as fit and are 
tolerated, or pain/tingling is zeroed  
 Goal: Replace pain or tingling with new/different tingling sensation in the area 
of pain, in order to reduce area of pain/tingling and allow for proper placement 
of electrodes in next session  
 
Treat for 30 minutes after tingling begins  
 
 
* Patient assessed daily for ability to follow Algorithm 1  
Option 2: Treat in area of pain  
 
When electrode cannot be placed in area of non -pain, an electrode can be placed 
in the area of  least  pain and then Algorithm 1 can be followed 
 
However, this can cause increased pain and discomfort and therefore this 
technique should be used based on provider experience and patient tolerability

Four doses of NT-814 (40 mg once a day, 80 mg once a 
day, 120 mg once a day and 160 mg once a day) will be 
investigated and compared to placebo, in five parallel 
groups. All subjects will receive placebo for the last 2 weeks of the screening/baseline period , after which 
subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomised into the study.  Subjects will initially be randomised 1:1:1:1:[ADDRESS_1235143]:  CONFIDENTIAL Protocol No.: 814-PM-02

 approximately 19 weeks, comprising a screening & 
baseline period (3 weeks), [ADDRESS_1235144] participating in the study.  
Subjects who provide informed consent will be 
screened for participation in the study. After giving informed consent, but before Screening Visit 2 (i.e. before starting the placebo run-in period), subjects will be withdrawn from prohibited concomitant medications. 
At the first visit (Screening Visit 1), they will be 
provided with a paper diary, which they will be asked to complete once daily (prior to retiring to bed) for 7 days, recording their recall of the total number of hot flushes (also known as hot flashes) over the previous 24 hours, and the severity of each of those hot flushes. At the second visit (Screening Visit 2), the investigator or designee will review the paper diary to determine if the subject can continue in the st udy. To continue, subjects 
must have completed the paper diary for at least [ADDRESS_1235145] 5 days that the paper diary was completed. 
Subjects who continue to satisfy all the initial selection 
criteria at Screening Visit 2 will commence placebo 
treatment on a single-blind (s ubject only) basis and be 
provided with an electronic diary (eDiary) which they will be asked to complete twice a day for 14 (+2) days 
during the remaining screening/baseline period. The eDiary will record the subject’s recall of the number of hot flushes during the day (recorded just prior to retiring to bed) and overnight (recorded on wakening). The severity of each hot flush will also be recorded. To proceed to randomisation, th e subject will be required 
to have completed the eDiary for at least [ADDRESS_1235146] 7 days that the 
eDiary was completed. 
At the baseline visit (Day 1), subjects who comply with 
all selection criteria will be enrolled into the 12-week double-blind portion of the study and be randomised to one of the NT-814 doses or placebo. Subjects who do not meet the eDiary criteria will not continue into the study (they will be screen failures).

 Randomised subjects will undergo further clinic visits 
at Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12 (end of treatment visit) and Week 16 (end of study) with regular assessments of complian ce with study medication, 
compliance with the eDiary completion as well as assessments of concomitant medications, mental well-being, quality of life (QoL), sleep, and safety.  
A treatment kit will be dispensed at Screening Visit 2 
(for the placebo run-in), the Baseline Visit, Week 4 and Week 8. A final follow-up safety assessment will be performed at Week 16, 4-weeks after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_14930]. 
Blood samples will be collected for pharmacokinetic 
(PK) analysis for all subjects at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12.

ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION  Oral 
DURATION/FREQUENCY OF TREATMENT  Once daily dosing in the evening for [ADDRESS_1235161] 2 weeks of the screening/baseline period.  
PLANNED SAMPLE SIZE For the efficacy objectives of the study, assuming a 
common standard deviati on (SD) of 4.4, N=27 per 
treatment group has ~95% pow er (alpha=0.05 2-sided) 
via trend test across all doses including placebo if the true underlying dose response is non-decreasing from a reduction of [ADDRESS_1235162] dose of NT-814.   N=33 per treatment group is required for 95% power for pairwise comparison of the highest dose to placebo under these same assumptions. Hence, a total of 150 comple ted subjects (30 x 5) was 
used for the simulations of adaptive design.  The actual sample size will be determined by [CONTACT_882883]-finding design algorithm outcomes. In addition, the initial actual sample size is increased by 10% to allow for subjects who withdraw prematurely and so the initial sample size will be 165 subjects. 
 The sample size allows for 95% power since each of the four co-primary endpoints are required to demonstrate statistical significance to yield a firm conclusion of beneficial treatment effect on hot flushes.  Conservatively, assuming independence among the four endpoints, this would yield approximately 81% power overall for achieving statistical significance for each of

NT-814  NeRRe Therapeutics Ltd 
 
Protocol No.:  814-PM-02 FINAL 2.1 (US) Page [ADDRESS_1235164] 81%; the actual power depends 
on the unknown magnitudes of correlations among the co-primary endpoints.   
STATISTICAL METHODS The Safety Analysis Set consists of all subjects who 
receive at least one dose of double-blind study drug irrespective of treatment received. Subjects will be analysed according to treatment received. The Full Analysis Set (FAS) consists of all randomised subjects who received at least one dose of double-blind study drug, irrespective of treatment received, and have a at least 7 days’ worth of post-treatment assessments (i.e. requirement for the primary efficacy endpoint). Subjects will be analysed according to randomised treatment. This is the primary efficacy analysis set for the study. The Per Protocol analysis set consists of all subjects in the FAS excluding those identified as having relevant protocol deviat ions. The Exposure-Response 
Set consists of all subjects who received at least one dose of double-blind study drug and for whom the PK data are considered sufficient.  All statistical hypothesis tests and confidence intervals will be two sided, using a type I error rate of 0.05. No adjustment for multiple comparisons will be used for this Phase [ADDRESS_1235165] 7 days of the baseline eDiary completion period. Absolute and changes from baseline in the mean daily frequencies and average hot flush severity will be summarised by [CONTACT_1570]. The change from baseline endpoint will be analysed by [CONTACT_484939].  Pairwise statistical comparisons are planned for each NT-814 dose group (40 mg, 80 mg, 
120 mg and 160 mg) versus placebo, presenting the 
adjusted mean treatment difference with its corresponding 95% confidence interval. Secondary efficacy endpoints will be analysed in a similar fashion, except that the proportion of responders, defined as a reduction of >=50% points and >=80% points on the weekly average frequency of hot flushes will be analysed by [CONTACT_51621].

 5. BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
5.1 NT-814 
Prior to its acquisition, initially by [CONTACT_882884] (NeRRe), and then subsequently by 
[CONTACT_882885] (KaNDy), NT-814’ s laboratory code name [CONTACT_882927]1144814. The 
[COMPANY_004] laboratory code may be used in this and ot her trial related document when referring to the 
studies conducted by [CONTACT_23983], but NT-814 is used  for all development activities conducted by 
[CONTACT_882886]. NT-814 is be ing developed in a number of i ndications in women’s health, 
including the treatment of post-menopausal symptoms. 
KaNDy has delegated all regulatory and quality Sponsor res ponsibilities to NeRRe.

in pharmacodynamic models for the NK 1 receptor (the gerbil foot tappi[INVESTIGATOR_157662]) and NK 3 receptor 
(wet dog shaking behaviour in guinea pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107]); bo th in a dose dependent manner.  NT-[ADDRESS_1235177] in the marmoset.   
The brain penetrant proper ties of NT-814 were conf irmed in the gerbil and guinea pig in which 
receptor occupancy (RO) in the brain was demonstrated at both the NK 1 and NK 3 receptors in a 
dose- and concentration-dependent manner; the RO at both re ceptors was sustained for extended 
periods post-dose. In a positron emission tomogr aphy (PET) study in baboons, NT-[ADDRESS_1235178] of brain NK 1 and NK 3 receptors in vivo .  
NT-814 was shown to be >100-fold selective for the human NK 3 receptor and >300-fold for the 
human NK 1 receptor, in comparison to 53 other non-tachykinin receptors, ion channels, enzymes 
and transporters. There were no clinically relevant findings in respi[INVESTIGATOR_882861] 100 mg/kg or in a cardiova scular study in cynomolgus monkeys at doses up 
to 60 mg/kg. NT-814 did not inhibit the human ether-a-go-go (hERG) tail current. 
5.1.2 Pre-clinical Safety 
A full package of pre-clinical safety studies ap propriate to the stage of development has been 
completed with NT-814.  This includes single dose studies in marmoset and monkey (up to 
1000 mg/kg) and repeat dose studies of up to 13-weeks in rat (up to 100 mg/kg/day) and cynomolgus monkey (up to 40 mg/kg/day). The safety profile was acc eptable and supported 
clinical evaluation with appropriate monitoring.  
Genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity studies  have also been undertaken. NT-[ADDRESS_1235179]:  CONFIDENTIAL Protocol No.: 814-PM-02

 100 mg/kg/day or in the rabbit at doses up to 140 mg/kg/day. A signal with respect to potential 
phototoxicity warrants monitoring of subj ects for skin reactions to sunlight.  
5.1.[ADDRESS_1235180] been completed with single total daily doses up to 250 mg and repeat doses up to 200 mg total daily dose for 28 days. These studies comprise a single dose escalation pharmacokinetic  (PK) and safety study incorporating an 
assessment of NK
1 RO using PET imaging (Study MNK111321), a repeat-dose PK and safety 
study with a drug interaction assessment and NK 1 RO evaluation (MNK111587), a single-dose 
study assessing the PK and effect of food on a tablet formulation (MNK112891), a single dose 
study assessing whether the psychomotor and cognitive effects of alcohol are exacerbated by [CONTACT_110586]-
814 (MNK113476) and a relative bi oavailability and food effe ct study (814-1-01).  
Thirty-seven female and [ADDRESS_1235181] accumu lation ratios and approxima tely linear increases 
in exposure with increasing dose. The terminal elimination half-life was estimated to be in the 
range ~15-[ADDRESS_1235182]-menopausa l female subjects experiencing tr oublesome hot flushes participated 
in a 14 day repeat dose study which assessed the safety, efficacy and PK of NT-814 in this 
indication (Study RELENT-1). Eighteen subject s received placebo and [ADDRESS_1235183]-menopausal symptoms, 
with clinically relevant and statistically significant improvements on both daytime hot flush 
frequency and severity and night-time awakening at the higher doses (150 and 300 mg) compared 
to placebo.  
The PK profile in post-menopausal  females was very similar to th at observed in younger male 
volunteers. However, the hard gel capsule formulati on used in the study resulted a high degree of 
within and between subject variability in exposure. The variability was generally greater at the 
higher doses, with the coefficients of variation (CV%) approaching 150% for some parameters.  In addition to the high variability, the mean ex posures observed at doses up to [ADDRESS_1235184] acceptable vari ability (CV% <45%) and good exposures.  
Administration of the soft-gel capsule with f ood was found in this study to reduce the maximum

21 May 2019 plasma concentration (C max) of NT-814 quite significantly (by [CONTACT_129743] 70%) but with only a 
modest reduction (~9%) on overall ex posure. This blunting of the C max dose not result in lower 
concentrations at later time points and the overall exposure is anticipated to be sufficient for 
efficacy in both the fed and fasted states. 
This soft gel formulation is the current devel opment form of NT-814 and will be used in this 
study.

in the current version of the Investigators Brochure (IB). 
5.[ADDRESS_1235185]-menopausal women and rationale for this study 
Over the coming decades, it is estimated that more than 1 billion women worldwide will be older 
than 50 years. Up to 75% of these women will experience adverse symptoms related to 
menopausal transition, particularly  hot flushes (also called flashe s) vasomotor symptoms, sleep 
disturbances and adverse mood effects that have such a negative impact upon patient daily 
activities and quality of life1,2,3. Hot flushes are transient but recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_287751], 
perspi[INVESTIGATOR_882862], bothersome and 
distressing symptoms felt by [CONTACT_882887] e transition to menopause (peri-menopause) and 
post-menopause periods4. They are the leading cause for seeking medical attention during this 
particular phase of a woman’s life, particularly amongst those experiencing the severest 
symptoms5,6.  The hot flushes may also be associated with difficulty in sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]7, [ADDRESS_1235186] menses13,14. Current treatment options are limited and 
include hormone replacement therapy (HRT) which is effective in many women but associated 
with an increased risk of hormone-dependent can cers, thrombotic risk and cardiovascular adverse 
effects15. HRT can also take several months to im prove hot flush symptoms, especially when 
used at lower doses, and has limited effects on sleep disturbance16,17. These and other limitations 
preclude its use in many women. A low dose of the anti-depressant paroxetine is licensed for use in some countries but has limited efficacy and a ra nge of safety and tole rability concerns that 
prevent its widespread usage especially  in the breast cancer survivor population. 
Emerging data show that hot flushes may be trea ted by [CONTACT_882888]
18. The menopause is characterized by [CONTACT_882889], and a resultant increase in go nadotropin releasing horm one (GnRH) secretion 
from the hypothalamus leading to high gonadotropin (luteinising hormone [LH] and follicle stimulating hormone) concentrations.  A link between initiation of the LH pulse and hot flushes 
has been reported
19. However, a number of studies invol ving oestrogen administration and 
withdrawal in patients who do not have elevated LH have shown they still experience hot 
flushes20,21,22, as do patients with Kallman’s syndrome who lack hypothalamic GnRH neurons, 
and in whom oestrogen withdrawal will trigger hot flush es23. These findings show that hot

21 May 2019 flushes can occur even in the absence of pulsatile GnRH or LH release, implicating the 
involvement of upstream processes res ponsible for GnRH synthesis. The h ypothalamic 
infundibular (arcuate) nucleus is a group of sex steroid-res ponsive neurons that co-express 
kisspeptin, dynorphin as well as NKB; the so-called ‘KNDy’ neuron s24. Morphologic studies 
have shown that KNDy neurons from postmenopausal women are hypertrophied25 and this 
hypertrophy is accompanied by [CONTACT_882890], kisspeptin and Substance P gene expression; but 
not dynorphi n25-27.  These expression changes are a conseque nce of oestrogen withdrawal as they 
can be induced by [CONTACT_882891]28-30.    
KNDy neurons, expressing NK [ADDRESS_1235187] ate of hyperactivation 
(consistent with the observed hypertrophy) which could disrupt baseline thermoregulation and trigger hot flushe s
31. Therefore, modulation of the KNDy ne urons could be a viable therapeutic 
approach to controlling hot flushes. Clinical  evidence supporting the hypothesis comes from a 
study in healthy women in which it was shown th at intravenous infusion of NKB (endogenous 
ligand that binds the NK 3 receptor) acutely induces hot  flushes in healthy wome n33. Furthermore, 
two recently completed proof of concept studies with NK [ADDRESS_1235188] 
fezolinetant resulted in a sustained reduction in the frequency (-93% vs -54% for placebo) and severity (-70% vs -23%) of hot flushes (HF). The maximum improvements were apparent within 
[ADDRESS_1235189] MLE4901, the 
reduction in HF frequency was 78.4% compar ed to a reduction of 45.6% with placebo.  
A role for SP and NK [ADDRESS_1235190]-me nopausal and other reproductive system 
disorders is supported by a body of evid ence that indicates that the SP/NK 1 receptor system 
modulates KNDy neurons in unison with the NKB/NK 3 system. In adult male and/or 
ovariectomised female rodents, central infusion of specific NK 1 receptor agonists induces 
gonadotropin releas e36,37. In the mouse this response can be shown to be modulated by [CONTACT_882892] (Kiss1r-/-) fail to respond to the NK 1 agonis t36. Expression of the gene 
encoding for SP (Tacr1) can be inhibited by [CONTACT_882893] ~50% of 
Kiss1 positive neurons also expressed the Tacr1 gene. In goats, however, although data suggests 
that SP (along with NKA and NKB) has a s timulatory effect on the GnRH pulse-generator 
and LH release, it only does so at high doses i ndicating that NKB in this species is the pi[INVESTIGATOR_882863] e38. Although there is evidence suggesting that SP does not play a key role in 
the non-human primate GnRH pulse generato r39, SP immunoreactivity frequently co-localises 
with kisspeptin and NKB in the human infundibular regio n40. Further, hypertrophy and 
increased gene expression of neurons containing SP messenge r ribonucleic acid and SP+ immunoreactive nerves has been

21 May 2019 demonstrated in humans in the hypothalami of postmenopausal women, with significantly more 
SP+ immunoreactive neurons than in age-matched men41.  
In addition to a central role in flushing, NK [ADDRESS_1235191] properties. 
Taken together this evidence supports the hypothesis that the dual NK 1,3 receptor antagonism that 
NT-814 offers could be an effective treatment fo r vasomotor symptoms in the menopausal patient 
population as well as addressing important comorbidities. 
5.3 Rationale for endpoints 
There is no uniform clinical profile of hot fl ushes and variations are observed in terms of 
frequency, severity, duration, and course. Patients’ perception of a hot flush and their impact on 
quality of life (QoL), sleep and psychosomatic reactions differ, and each is vulnerable to 
confounders, such as current mood, environmental fact ors or stress. It is, th erefore, important to 
use a variety of assessment tools in clinical studies of hot flushes.  
The primary efficacy assessment in this study will be based on subject reported assessments of 
hot flush frequency and severity. These will be recorded daily in an electronic diary (eDiary) throughout the study. Hot flush is a subjective experience for the subject and so its occurrence 
and intensity can only be assessed by [CONTACT_423].  The assessment will be based on the subject’s 
recollection of the number and severity of hot flushes experienced twice daily; once in the 
evening on retiring to bed and once in the morning on waking. The morning assessment also enables the number of times the subject awoke at night to be recorded. These assessments are routinely employed in clinical studies in hot flush and their use is supported by [CONTACT_882894]
[ADDRESS_1235192] of menopausal sy mptoms on subjects’ hea lth and well-being will 
be evaluated using the Menopause Specific Quality of Life Scale (MenQOL) which is a quality of 
life instrument designed speci fically for use in the menopaus e and is used frequently in 
menopause clinical research
51. In addition, the Hot Flash Re lated Daily Interference Scale 
(HFRDIS) will be used to evaluate interference with daily functioning. This is a validated 
instrument that has been shown to be sensitive to the effects of pharmacological interventions on 
menopause symptoms52,53.The effect of NT-[ADDRESS_1235193]:  CONFIDENTIAL Protocol No.: 814-PM-02

of development (adverse events, routine safety la boratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiogram 
(ECG)). Although the effect is expected to  be modest in the post-menopausal population, NK 3 
receptor blockade may result in a reduction in circ ulating oestrogen concentrations and so safety 
assessments will, additiona lly, include an assessment of bone  turnover. No adverse effects are 
anticipated but because NT-814 acts centrally in the nervous system its safety  related to suicidal 
ideation will, in accordance with regulatory expectations, be assessed using the electronic version of the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Score.   
The assessment of safety for hor monal menopause therapi[INVESTIGATOR_882864]-vaginal ultrasound (TVU) a nd, if indicated, endometrial biopsy. Since NK 
receptor blockade will, if anything, reduce horm onal drive to the endometrium these invasive 
evaluations are not warranted routinely for all subjects. However, any subject experiencing 
uterine bleeding (including spotting) during th e study will undergo TVU and biopsy if indicated.

 8.6.1 Justification for Study Design 
The study is a dose-range finding study, with assessment of dose-response based on both efficacy 
and safety. A four-fold range of doses will be evaluated which broadly encompasses the 
equivalent exposures to those evaluated in th e RELENT-1 study that were associated with 
efficacy (See Section  5.1.3) .  
The study will have an adaptive design component in which the number of subjects randomised to each treatment group is modified on the basis of emerging safety and efficacy data. This design 
enables a broad range of doses to be evaluated in the first instance, but with the ability to reduce the number of doses of NT-814 being evaluated if  this emerging data shows that there is no 
advantage in continuing to evaluate them. The interim reviews also enable the sample size (per treatment group) to be assessed on an ongoing basis and to be increased if the estimates of treatment effect and variability used to derive the sample size originally prove to be incorrect. These adaptive features ensure that the study has the greatest probability of success while making efficient use of the trial population.  
The study will be placebo controlled to minimise  assessment bias. Placebo is considered an 
acceptable reference group for studies in PM VMS as the disorder, whilst uncomfortable and 
disruptive to the affected individual, is not life- threatening or limiting, and studies are typi[INVESTIGATOR_882866]. Experience from multiple studies in  women with VMS has shown that a placebo 
response of up to 60% can be expected
[ADDRESS_1235216] 
to receive some benefit from study participation. The use of placebo is also recommended by 
[CONTACT_882897]-specific guidelines49,55.   
Although the interim analyses used to make  the adaptive randomisation decisions will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_882898] (DRC), the Sponsor and CRO study 
operational team will remain fully blinded throughout the study. The subjects and investigative site staff will also be blinded throughout the rando mised phase of the trial and thus the study will 
be triple blind to reduce assessment bias. All subjects will receive  placebo on a single blind basis 
during the last 2-weeks of the baseline period to enable baseline assessments to be recorded under similar conditions to those used during the randomis ed phase of the study. This run-in period, 
which has been used in similar trials previously
56, also allows participants to familiarise 
themselves with the requirements and systems used in the study before the start of the randomised treatment phase. 
The study will comprise a 2-week baseline peri od followed by a 12-week treatment period. The 
2-week baseline period allows subjects one week to become familiar with eDiary completion 
before the baseline efficacy assessments are made during the second week. Studies with other NK antagonists have demonstrated that maximum efficacy is achieved within a matter of weeks
34,35, 
and, in the case of fezolinetant, is sustained for at least 12-weeks. The disease-specific guidelines 
from both the FDA and CHMP recommend studies of 12-weeks duration to demonstrate 
maintenance of effec t49,55.  
8.6.[ADDRESS_1235217] Participation 
Subjects will participate in the study for a total of approximately 19 weeks, comprising a formal 
screening and baseline period (3 weeks), [ADDRESS_1235218]:  CONFIDENTIAL Protocol No.: 814-PM-02 
NT-814  NeRRe Therapeutics Ltd 
 
Protocol No.:  814-PM-02 FINAL 2.1 (US) Page [ADDRESS_1235219]’s initial eligibility for 
inclusion into the study: 
x Recording of the subject’s medical history, and prior and concomitant medication use, in 
particular, hormonal therapie s and drugs used to manage menopausal symptoms  
Subjects will be provided with, and trained on the use of, a paper diary to be completed once a 
day for 7 days. Each evening (before retiring to bed), subjects will record in the diary their recall 
of the total number of hot flushes of each se verity experienced over the previous [ADDRESS_1235220] 8 m oderate or severe hot flushes per day 
(including night-time) over the last 5 days that the paper diary was completed, or who are not 
compliant with diary completion will be Screen Failures and will not be able to continue into the 
study. Limited data will be collected for subjects who withdraw from the study after providing informed consent but prior to randomis ation onto the study (Screen Failures). 
If the diary compliance and hot flush criteria are satisfied, the following assessments will be 
performed to further determine the subject’s eligibility for inclusion into the study: 
x Review of other inclus ion/exclusion criteria 
x Full physical examination, 12-lead ECG, vital signs 
x Blood sampling for haematology and clinical ch emistry, and urine sample collection for 
urinalysis and urine pregnancy test  
x Review for adverse events and ch anges in concomitant medications

Subjects will be provided with a medication kit containing sufficient placebo capsules for a 2-week period (plus 2 days overage).  
This placebo-run in period will be single-blind in de sign, in that whilst the investigator and clinic 
staff will know that placebo is being provided, subjects must remain blinded, and should be 
merely be informed that they are being given study medication. 
8.6.5 Baseline (Day 1) 
Subjects will return to the clinic for the Baseline visit at which compliance with eDiary 
completion and hot flush data will be reviewed. Subjects who comply with all other selection criteria, who have completed the diary for at least [ADDRESS_1235222] 7 moderate or severe hot flushes per day (including night-time) over the last [ADDRESS_1235223] 7 m oderate or severe hot flushes per day 
(including night-time) over the last 7 days that the eDiary was completed, or who are not 
compliant with eDiary completion will be deemed Screen Failures and will not be able to continue into the study. Limited data will be collected for subjects who withdraw from the study after providing informed consent but prior to randomisation onto the study (Screen Failures). 
The Baseline visit will be Day 1. Prior to dosing on Day 1, the following assessments will be completed:  
x Review of inclusion/exclusion cr iteria, including eDiary data 
x Symptom directed physical examination 
x Vital signs ( after resting for ≥ 5 mins , see Section  10.3.8)  
x 12-lead ECG  
x Blood samples for clinical chemistry, haem atology and plasma bone turnover markers 
x Urine sample for urinalysis

 x Subjects will be asked to complete the MenQoL-I, HFRDIS, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_379017], Insomnia Severity Index, electronic Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (eC-SSRS) and the Beck Depression Inventory II. 
x Review for adverse events and ch anges in concomitant medications 
Eligible subjects will be randomised on Day 1 to NT-814 or placebo. Randomisation will be 
performed centrally via an interactive web response system (IWRS). 
Subjects will be given their first dose of IMP in the clinic and take all subsequent doses at home 
once a day in the evening (starting the following day) for a total of 12 weeks. At the baseline 
visit, subjects will be provided with IMP sufficient for the next 4 weeks. 
Subjects will continue to comple te the eDiary twice a day throughout the study until the Final 
Follow-up visit at Week 16. 8.6.6 Interim visits (Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12) 
During the double-blind treatment phase, subjects will return to the clinic for interim assessments 
at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12. Weeks 2 and 4 should be sche duled within ±3 days of the target visit day 
and Weeks 8 and 12 within ±4 days of the target visit day. The visit at Week 12 should be 
conducted at a similar time of day to  the baseline visit to reduce di urnal variation in the plasma 
bone turnover markers. 
At the start of each visit a blood sample will be taken for determination of  plasma levels of NT-
814. At the same time, if required per the Study Schedule, blood samples for safety laboratory 
assessments and plasma bone tur nover markers will be taken. Subj ects will be asked to provide 
the time they took their dose of study medication on the previous day and this will be recorded on 
the eCRF.  
Study medication compliance will be  reviewed at all visits and a new supply of study medication 
(sufficient for the next 4 weeks) will be provided at Weeks 4 and 8. Diary completion compliance 
will also be reviewed, and training/re-training provided as necessary.  
At each visit the following assessments will be completed: 
x Vital signs (after resting for ≥ 5 mins, see  Section  10.3.8)  
x 12-lead ECG  
x Blood samples for hematology (Weeks 2, 4 and 12 ), clinical chemistry (Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 
12), pharmacokinetic analysis (Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12) and plasma bone turnover markers 
(Week 12 only)

x Review of eDiary compliance 
x Review for adverse events and ch anges in concomitant medications 
At Week 12, subjects may be re-started on any prohibited medications th at are permitted after 
the end of treatment (see Appendix A). 
8.6.7 Final Follow-up / Early Termination visit 
Subjects will return to the clinic for the final study visit 4-weeks (+5 days) after the end of 
treatment. The visit should be c onducted at a similar time of day to  the baseline visit to reduce 
diurnal variation in the pl asma bone turnover markers. 
The same procedures will also be undertaken if  a subject withdraws from the study early.  
The eDiary will be collected and the following assessments completed:  
x Symptom directed physical examination 
x Vital signs (after resting for ≥ 5 mins per Section  10.3.8)  
x 12-lead ECG 
x Blood samples for clinical chemistry and hema tology and plasma bone turnover markers

A 40 mg soft-gel capsule has been developed and so all doses in the current study will be a 
multiple of 40 mg. The exposure after a single 150 mg dose in RELENT-1 is approximately 3-
fold higher than the exposure after a single 25 mg dose of the soft gel capsule. Thus, an 
equivalent dose in the soft gel capsule is ~[ADDRESS_1235233]:  CONFIDENTIAL Protocol No.: 814-PM-02

 linearity is also assumed when setting the doses for the current study. Assuming a ‘pi[INVESTIGATOR_53643]’ dose of 
80 mg, dose-linearity across the dose range and an  accumulation ratio of 1.7 (to convert single 
dose data to steady state conditions), the estimated median AUCs at steady state at the four doses planned will be as shown in  Table 9-3.

AUC 0-24 = Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours, CI = confidence interval  
These four doses enable a range of exposures to  be evaluated that encompass the full range of 
effectiveness responses observed in RELENT-1. Th e mean values at the mid doses (80 and 120 
mg) are around the point that exposure-response modelling predicts max imum efficacy and the 
low and high doses are, respectively, expected to enable the rising and plateau parts of the dose-response curve to be demonstrated.   
The upper bound of the confidence interval for pred icted exposure at the high dose is below the 
mean exposure for the high dose in the RELENT-1 study (~15,000 ng*hr/ml) and is substantially 
below the individual highest exposures (up to ~8 0,000 ng*hr/ml) that were we ll tolerated in that 
study. It is also below the mean (~14,000 ng*hr/ml) and maximum (~42,000 ng*h/mL) values

10.2.1 Hot Flush Electronic Diary 
Subjects will be provided with an eDiary to document the number of hot flushes experienced, the 
severity of each hot flush using a scale of 1 to  3 (mild, moderate or severe) and the number of 
night-time awakenings (Appendix C). Subjects will complete the eDiary twice a day, starting the evening of Screening Visit [ADDRESS_1235251] as follows: 
Mild:  Sensation of heat without sweating Moderate:  Sensation of h eat with sweating, but able  to continue activity.  
Severe:  Sensation of heat with sweating, causing cessation (stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) of activity A hot flush at night which awakens the subject should be classed as severe. Once awake, subjects 
should record any further hot flush epi[INVESTIGATOR_882869]. 
10.2.2 MenQoL-I (1 month recall version) 
The MenQoL-I (Menopause-specific Quality- of-Life Questionnaire Intervention Version, 
Appendix C) is a validated questionnaire used to  measure condition-specif ic quality of life in 
menopausal women. It is composed of 32 it ems across 4 domains (physical, vasomotor, 
psychosocial and sexual). For each item, subjec ts record whether they have experienced the 
problem in the past month, and if so, they rate how bothered they were by [CONTACT_882903] a scale 
of 0 (not at all bothered) to 6 (extremely bothered). The item respons es can then be converted into 
analysis scores and an overall questionnaire score.

 Subjects will complete the MenQoL-I questionnaire at each clinic visit except the two Screening 
visits and Week 2. 
10.2.3 Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale (HFRDIS) 
The HFRDIS (Appendix C) is a 10-item, self-re port questionnaire assess ing the impact of hot 
flushes on a woman’s life during th e past week. For each of the [ADDRESS_1235252] of th eir life on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 10 (very 
much so). Subjects will complete the HFRDIS at each clinic visit except the two Screening visits. 10.2.4 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_882870] (PSQI, Ap pendix C) is a self-ra ted questionnaire which 
assesses sleep quality and disturba nces over a 1-month time interv al. Nineteen individual items 
generate seven "component" scor es: subjective sleep quality, sl eep latency, sleep duration, 
habitual sleep efficiency, sl eep disturbances, use of sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_88794], and daytime 
dysfunction. The sum of scores for these se ven components yields one global score. 
Subjects will complete the PSQI at each clinic visit except the two Screening visits and Week 2. 10.2.5 Insomnia Severity Index 
The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI, Appendix C) is  a brief self-report questionnaire assessing the 
nature, severity, and impact of insomnia. The ISI comprises 7 items assessing the perceived 
severity of difficulties initiating sleep, staying asleep, and early morning awakenings, satisfaction 
with current sleep pattern, interference with daily functioning, noticeability of impairment attributed to the sleep problem, and degree of distress or concern caused by [CONTACT_157501]. 
Subjects rate each item on a scale of 0 to 4, yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 28. 
Subjects will complete the ISI at each clinic visit except the two Screening visits and Week 2.  
10.2.6 Beck Depression  Inventory II 
The Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II, Appe ndix C) is a 21-item que stionnaire assessing the 
intensity of depressive symptoms over the past [ADDRESS_1235253]:  CONFIDENTIAL Protocol No.: 814-PM-02

time since the date of diagnosis. 
History should include (but is not limited to): 
x All current and past medications  taken during the six months before the Screening Visit  
x Relevant history of menopausal, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696],  cardiovascular, renal,  gastro-intestinal, 
hepatic, endocrine, hematolo gical, neurological, psychiat ric and any other diseases 
The menopausal symptom history does not need to  be recorded on the general medical history 
page of the eCRF. However, surgeries rela ted to menopause (e.g. bilateral oophorectomy, 
hysterectomy) do need to be reco rded on the medical history page. 
10.3.2 Physical examinations 
A full physical examination will be conducted at Screening Visit 2 and a symptom directed 
physical examination at the Baseline and Week 16 visits. This will be completed by a physician 
or an appropriatel y qualified delegate. 
A full physical examination includes a review of the following body systems: 
x General appearance 
x Skin 
x Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat 
x Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] 
x Cardiovascular 
x Abdomen (including liver and kidneys)

10.3.4 Electronic Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale, or C-SSRS (Appendix C), is a rating scale created 
to evaluate suicidality in adults  and children over the age of 12. It rates an individual's degree of 
suicidal ideation on a scale, ranging from "wish to be dead" to "active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent." The ve rsion used will be the electr onic C-SSRS (eC-SSRS), which is a 
subject-reported version of the scale. The C-SSRS has been found to be reliable and valid in the 
identification of suicide risk in several research studies and is a standard tool used in clinical 
development studies with centrally acting inve stigational drugs, re gardless of indication. 
Subjects will complete the eC-SSRS at Baseline, Weeks 4, 12, and 16. 
10.3.5 Clinical chemistry 
Blood for clinical chemistry assessments will be collected as indicated in the Study Schedule 
(Table 10-1)  and sent to the central laboratory for analysis.  The following clinical chemistry 
parameters will be assessed: sodium, potassium, glucose, ur ea (blood urea nitrogen), creatinine, 
creatine kinase, albumin, calcium, phosphate, bilir ubin (total), alkaline phosphatase, aspartate 
transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (A LT), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), 
bicarbonate, magnesium, chloride, total protein and haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Subjects do not 
need to fast before clinical chemistry samples are taken. 
All clinical chemistry test reports must be revi ewed, signed and dated by [CONTACT_335848]. Reports will then be filed with the subject’s medical record. The Investigator 
will comment on all abnorma l results and determine whether th ey are clinically significant.

10.5 Adverse events 
10.5.1 Definitions 
Adverse Event (AE) 
Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical trial subject administered an IMP and 
which does not necessarily have a causal relationshi p with this treatment. An AE can therefore be 
any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an IMP, whether or not considered 
related to the IMP.

NT-814  NeRRe Therapeutics Ltd 
 
Protocol No.:  814-PM-02 FINAL 2.1 (US) Page [ADDRESS_1235260] until Screening Visit 2, 
the adverse event reporting period starts after this visit is complete.  
Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) 
All AEs considered to be untoward and uninte nded responses to an IMP related to any dose 
should be considered ADRs. The definition covers also medication errors and uses outside what 
is foreseen in the protocol, including misuse an d abuse of the product. The phrase “responses to 
an IMP” means that a causal relationship betwee n an IMP and an AE is at least a reasonable 
possibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out. Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
An adverse event that: 
x Results in death 
x Is life-threatening (i.e. the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not 
refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe) 
x Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_254341] (see 
explanation below) 
x Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
x Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
x Is considered to be an important medical event 
Based upon medical and scientific judgment, important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening, or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the subject 
and/or
11 may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition 
above may be considered a SAE. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_882871]. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27589] t echnical, practical or social reasons, in the 
absence of an adverse event is not an SAE and neither is attendance at an Emergency Room / 
Accident and Emergency Department that takes place in the evening or night and does not result 
in formal admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction 
An adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with applicable product 
reference safety information (Section 6.5 of the Investigator Brochure).

 Reports which add significant information on the sp ecificity, increase of occurrence, or severity 
of a known, already documented serious adve rse reaction constitute unexpected events. 
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) 
A serious adverse event that is suspected to be  related to the administe red medicinal product and 
the nature or severity of which is not consistent with th e reference safety information. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
NT-[ADDRESS_1235262]- menopausal bleeding af ter randomisation should 
undergo a transvaginal ultrasound with subseque nt investigation and management (including 
endometrial biopsy, if i ndicated) according to the investigat or’s clinical judgement and usual 
practice (unexplained post-menopausal bleeding prior to randomisation will exclude the subject 
from the study). 
10.5.2 Assessment of Severity 
The severity (intensity) of each adverse event will be classified as: 
x Mild   Awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated 
x Moderate Sign or symptom causes discomfort, but does not interfere with normal  
  activities 
x Severe  Sign or symptom of sufficient intensity to interfere with normal activities 
10.5.3 Assessment of Causality 
A determination will be made of the relationship (if any) between an AE and the study drug. A 
causal relationship is present if a determination is made that there is a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_502170] y procedure. AEs will be classified as either 
related or unrelated.

 complete. Adverse events occurring from the time of Screening Visit 2 up to the final study visit 
will be recorded. All AEs should be recorded in the eCRF and in the subjects’ source notes. 
Any SAE occurring from Screening Visit [ADDRESS_1235264] be 
reported immediately (within 24 hours of the investig ator becoming aware of it) and recorded on 
the SAE Form. Detailed instructions for the repor ting of SAEs can be found in the Study Manual. 
All subjects with a SAE must be followed up and the outcomes reported. The investigator must 
supply the Sponsor and the relevant agency/IRB/I EC with any additional requested information 
(e.g., autopsy reports and terminal medical reports). Any follow-up information on a previously reported SAE will also be reporte d within [ADDRESS_1235265] all information regarding an SAE, he/ she will not wait to receive additional information be fore reporting the event and co mpleting the appropriate data 
collection form. The Investigator should always provide a preliminary assessment of causality at 
the time of the initial report as described in Section  10.5.3. 
The primary mechanism for reporting SAEs will be a paper collection form. 
Scan & email of the SAE form is the preferred me thod to transmit this information to the project 
contact [CONTACT_882905]. In rare circumstances and in 
the absence of email facilities or  fax equipment, notification by  [CONTACT_72031], with a 
copy of the SAE data collection form sent by [CONTACT_9338]. Initial notif ication via the telephone 
does not replace the need for the Investigator to complete and sign the SAE data collection form 
within the designated reporting periods. 
If required according to local regulatory authorities and IRB/IEC policy, each Investigator must 
then notify his or her relevant agency/IRB/IEC of the SAE. 
NeRRe is required to expedite to worldwide re gulatory authorities reports of S[LOCATION_003]Rs in line 
with the relevant legislation. Fatal or life-threatening S[LOCATION_003]Rs must be reported within 7 calendar 
days and other S[LOCATION_003]Rs within 15 calendar days. 
In accordance with the European Commissi on Directive 2001/20/EC, NeRRe will notify the 
relevant Ethics Committees in concerned Member states of applicable S[LOCATION_003]Rs as individual 
notifications or through a periodic line listing. S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be reported to IRB/EC in non-EU 
countries according to local regulations and IRB/EC policy. 
All investigators will receive a safety letter notifying them of relevant S[LOCATION_003]R reports. 
NeRRe (or their designee) will submit to the regulatory authorities all safety updates and periodic 
reports, as required by [CONTACT_40007].

(alpha=0.05 2-sided) via trend test across all doses including  placebo if the true underlying dose 
response is non-decreasing from a reduction of [ADDRESS_1235267] 
dose of NT-814.   N=33 per treatment group is re quired for 95% power for pairwise comparison 
of the highest dose to placebo under these same assumptions. Hence, a total of 150 completed 
subjects (30 x 5) was used for the simulations of adaptive design.  [Note, the actual performance / power for the adaptive designs may be higher than the values cited in this report since additional 
subjects will be added to selected dose groups to better inform on safety.]  The actual sample size 
will be determined by [CONTACT_882883]-finding design algorithm (See Appendix B). In addition, 
the actual sample size is increased by 10% to allow for subjects who withdraw prematurely and so the initial sample size will be 165 subjects. 
The sample size allows for 95% power since each of the four co-primary endpoints are required 
to demonstrate statistical significance in order to yield a firm conclusion of beneficial treatment effect on hot flushes.  Conservatively, assuming independence among the four endpoints, this would yield approximately 81% power overall for achieving statistical significance for each of 
the four endpoints.  Thus, overall power for the tr ial is estimated to be at least 81%; the actual 
power depends on the unknown magnitudes of correlations among the co-primary endpoints.   
11.1.2 Safety 
In addition to assessing efficacy, the study objectiv es also include further evaluation of the safety 
of a range of doses of NT-814 in women with  menopausal symptoms. Regarding estimation of 
differences in AE rates from placebo for a gi ven dose group, Table 11-1 (computed via normal 
approximation to the binomial distribution) shows th e half-width of 95% confidence intervals for 
difference between a pair of tr eatment groups.  This indicates the precision for such estimation 
for several example cases.  The DRC will use these confidence intervals to assist in their 
consideration of increasing the sample size of those doses which achieve target levels of HF 
frequency and severity reduction in order to better assess safety.  Criteria for such considerations 
will be described more fully in the DRC Charter.

11.2 Interim Reviews 
A number of interim analyses (IA) are planned to enable the following two questions to be 
addressed as the trial progresses:  
1) Do the emerging efficacy and safety data  support the continued evaluation of all four
NT-814 doses?
2) Do the assumptions used in the original sample size estimate remain valid?
The first IA will be conducted after efficacy data for the frequency and severity of hot flushes is 
collected through Week 4 from 30 patients randomiz ed in equal proportions to the four NT-814 
doses and placebo. The DRC will review the HF fre quency and severity results, together with all 
available safety data, and will determine the randomisation ratios for subjects subsequent enrolled 
into the study. The ratio may be changed to optimise the adaptive design to estimate doses with 
target levels of weekly average daily HF reduction from baseline of between 6 and 8.  The adaptive design algorithm will be based on Bayesian Emax dose-response modeling
57 and / or T-
statistic adaptive dose-finding design58.  The DRC will have dose assignment recommendations 
by [CONTACT_882906]-finding algorithms  and assign the randomiz ation ratio that best 
integrates the safety and efficacy objectives of the trial and the adaptive design results.  Additional details regarding the adaptive algorithms and their performance characteristics are in the adaptive dose-finding design simulation report (Appendix B).  Subsequent IA's will be 
conducted similarly, after Week 4 data from each  cohort of ~[ADDRESS_1235268]:  CONFIDENTIAL Protocol No.: 814-PM-02

 11.3 Analysis Sets 
The following data sets will be used for the statistical analysis. 
1. Safety Analysis Set : All subjects who receive at least one dose of double-blind study drug 
irrespective of treatment received. Subjects will be  analyzed according to treatment received 
2. Full Analysis Set (FAS):  All randomised subjects who r eceived at least one dose of double-
blind study drug, irrespective of treatment rece ived, and have hot flush data for at least 7 
days’ worth of post-treatment assessments (i .e. requirement for the primary efficacy 
endpoint). Subjects will be analyzed according to randomised treatment. This is the primary 
efficacy analysis set for the study. 
3. Per Protocol (PP) Set: All subjects in the FAS excluding those identified as having relevant 
protocol deviations. 
4. Exposure-Response (ER) Set: all subjects who received at least one dose of double-blind 
study drug and for whom the PK data are considered sufficient. 
Analysis Sets will be identified prior to the unblinding of the study data.  
11.4 Data Analysis 
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be written and finalised prior to database lock and treatment unblinding. The SAP will give a more detailed description of the summaries and analyses that will be performed, expanding on the protocol specified analysis. Any deviation 
from the protocol specified analysis will be documented within a protocol amendment or in the 
SAP, as appropriate, and de scribed within the CSR.  
Data will be analysed using SAS
® version 9.[ADDRESS_1235269] quartiles, minimum a nd maximum values. Categorical 
variables will be summari sed using counts and percentages. A ll statistical hypot hesis tests and 
confidence intervals will be tw o sided, using a type I error rate of 0.05. No adjustment for 
multiple comparisons will be used for this Phase 2 study. For the analysis of each efficacy 
endpoint pairwise statistical co mparisons are planned for each NT-814 dose group (40mg, 80mg, 
120 mg and 160 mg) versus placebo, with the understa nding that this increases the overall type I 
error rate of the study. All collected subject data will be listed. 
No subgroup analyses are planned to be performed. 11.[ADDRESS_1235270] interim analysis (IA) will be conducted after efficacy data from frequency and severity 
of hot flushes (HF) is collected through Week [ADDRESS_1235271]:  CONFIDENTIAL Protocol No.: 814-PM-02

 subsequent enrolled patients may be changed to optimize the adaptive design to estimate doses 
with target levels of weekly average daily HF reduction from baseline 6 and 8.  Adaptive design algorithm will be based on Bayesian Emax dose-response modeling
57  and / or T-statistic adaptive 
dose-finding design58.  The DRC will have dose assignment  recommendations by [CONTACT_882907]-finding algorithms and assign the randomization ratio that best integrates the objectives of the trial and the adaptive design results.  Additional details regarding the adaptive algorithms and their performance characteristics are in the adaptive dose-finding design simulation report (Appendix B).  Subsequent IA's will be conducted similarl y, after Week 4 data 
from each cohort of ~[ADDRESS_1235272] data, prior to database lock, at a blinded data review 
meeting (BDRM). Subjects with any relevant deviations that are judged to impact on the statistical analysis will be excluded from the PP analysis set. 
11.[ADDRESS_1235273] analysis set will be 
summarised by [CONTACT_6654]. Any screen failure subjects will be separately 
described in the CSR. In addition, the number of  subjects completing / not completing the study 
will be summarised along with the primary reason for withdrawal from the study. 
11.8 Demographics and Base line Characteristics 
Relevant Screening and Baseline data (i.e. data collected prior to the study treatment 
administration initiation) and demographic characteristics will be summarised descriptively for 
each treatment group. The FAS will be used in su mmaries of demographic and baseline data. No 
statistical testing will be used to compare treatment groups for different baseline characteristics.

mean treatment difference with its corresponding 95% confidence interval.  In addition, treatment 
mean comparisons to placebo may be made via estimated means from a 4-parameter Emax model 
fit and trend test for increasing response with increasing dose based on isotonic regression modelling [details will be in the Statistical Analysis Plan]. 
The primary objective will be assessed by [CONTACT_882908]-814 
group versus placebo separately: 
Null hypothesis (H
0): There is no difference in the mean  change from baseline in hot flush 
frequency [or severity] at Week 12 [or Week 4] compared to Baseline for the NT-814 treatment 
group compared to placebo. 
H0: μ (active) = μ (placebo) 
Alternative hypothesis (H 1): There is a difference in the mean change from baseline in hot flush 
frequency [or severity] at Week 12 [or Week 4] compared to Baseline for the NT-814 treatment 
group compared to placebo. 
H1: μ (active) ≠ μ (placebo) 
Absolute and changes from baseline in the in the mean frequency and severity will be 
summarised by [CONTACT_1570].  
11.9.2 Secondary Efficacy Analysis 
[IP_ADDRESS] Other hot flush frequency and severity secondary endpoints 
Each of the hot flush frequency and severity secondary endpoints, including night time 
awakening (Section 8.2), will be summarised by [CONTACT_882909] (as 
applicable) and will be analysed, following th e same approach as for the primary endpoint. 
The proportion of responders, defined as a redu ction of >=50% points and >=80% points on the 
weekly average frequency of hot flushes will be summarised at each scheduled visit. The Week 4 and Week 12 response will be analysed by [CONTACT_882910], including the same terms in the 
model as for the primary efficacy endpoint analys is. Pairwise statistical comparisons are planned 
for each NT-814 dose group versus placebo, presen ting the adjusted odds ratio for the treatment 
difference with its corresponding 95% Wald confidence interval.

 [IP_ADDRESS] Other Secondary endpoints  
The analyses of the following endpoints will use the same approach as for the primary endpoint: 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_38409], Insomnia Severity Index Scores, Beck Depression 
Inventory Scores, MenQoL and HFRDIS (total sc ore and domain/sub-scores , as applicable).  
For each of these secondary endpoints the appropri ate analysis method to be used to assess the 
observed data will be reviewed, and any changes documented in the SAP. Only the Week 4 and Week 12 time points will be analysed, other visits summarised only, by [CONTACT_1570]. 
11.10 Statistical Methods for Safety Parameters 
The safety analysis set will be used for all presentations of safety endpoints.  No statistical testing 
will be used to compare treatment groups for di fferent safety endpoints.  Safety data will be 
summarised descriptively for each treatment group.  
11.10.1 Adverse Events 
All adverse events will be coded using the current version of the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) will be presented 
within summary presentations, by [CONTACT_882911] (SOC), preferred term and 
treatment group.  
An adverse event will be defined as treatment emergent if the onset date is on or after the date of 
first dosing with study treatment. Any adverse event with an onset date earlier than the first 
dosing with study treatment will be considered as a pre-treatment adverse event. If a subject experiences more than one AE with the same pref erred term, that preferred term will be counted 
only once within summaries. It will be assigned the highest observed severity and the strongest 
relationship to study treatment among those events for the tables in which those characteristics are summarised. Pre-treatment AEs will be identified in a subject listing.  
Summaries presentations for the number and percen tage of subjects reporting TEAEs, severity of 
TEAEs, TEAEs by [CONTACT_78487], and treatment emergent serious adverse events 
(SAE) will be presented by [CONTACT_6654]. In addition, SAEs and adverse events 
directly resulting in withdrawal from study will be listed. 11.10.2 Laboratory Parameters 
Laboratory parameters (haematology, biochemistr y, bone turnover marker s and urinalysis) will 
be summarised over the scheduled  visits by [CONTACT_1570]. Absolute values and changes from 
baseline will be summarised for the haematology, biochemistry and bone turn -over parameters. In 
addition, for haematology and biochemistry paramete rs, shift tables will be presented for changes 
in category (below, within or above normal ra nge) from baseline to the subjects’ worst post-
baseline value (‘worst’ separately identified as either lowest or highest value observed on a 
subject for specific parameter being presented). Laboratory values outside the reference range 
will be identified in the subject listings.

APPENDIX B:  PHASE 2B ADAPTIVE DOSE-FINDING DESIGN FOR NT-[ADDRESS_1235297] ON REDUCTION OF HOT FLUSHES  
  J.Bolognese
 
18 July 2018  INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE 
 A Phase 2b dose-finding placebo-controlled trial of NT-814 treatment with four different doses for 12 weeks aimed at reduction of hot flushes is  being planned.  Adaptive design options are 
being considered to modify randomization ra tios to the NT-814 doses based on accumulating 
data.  This report summarizes several example adaptive design options along with their performance characteristics for an initial assume d example set of potential TRUE underlying 
dose-response curves.  The primary endpoints for the trial are hot flush frequency and severity; however, the adaptive design simulation software cannot handle multiple endpoints.  Hence, the scenarios evaluated focus on re duction of hot flush frequency. 
 METHODS 
 First, in order to arrive at so me example TRUE underlying dose-response scenarios, prior data on 
hot flush reduction was examined.  NT-814 has shown efficacy in reduction of hot flushes over a 
2-week period in a Phase 1/2a trial.  Mean re ductions in hot flush frequency of up to 9 per day 
from a baseline frequency ~10-12 were observed (w ith an observed SD of change from baseline 
ranged between ~3.4 to ~4.9; SD back-calculated from SE's from the analysis model yielded SD's 
of change ~3.7).  In order to obtain longer term prior data to inform on expected variability, the Duavee label was also examined.  It yielded SD 's of change ~4.4 after 4 weeks' treatment and 
~3.6 after 12 weeks' treatment.  Based on these pr ior data, an SD=4.[ADDRESS_1235298] were used to simulate adaptive design outcomes and performance characteristics.  The following TRUE under lying dose-response curves were examined:

Protocol No.:  814-PM-02 FINAL 2.1 (US) Page [ADDRESS_1235300] deviation (SD) of  4.4, N=27 per treatment group has ~95% power 
(alpha=0.05 2-sided) via tr end test across all doses including placebo if the true underlying dose 
response is non-decreasing from a reduction of [ADDRESS_1235301] 
dose of NT-814.   N=33 per treatment group is re quired for 95% power for pairwise comparison 
of the highest dose to placebo under these same assumptions. Hence, a total of 150 completed 
subjects (30 x 5) was used for the simulations of adaptive design.  [Note, the actual performance / 
power for the adaptive designs may be higher than the values cited in this report since additional subjects will be added to selected dose groups to better inform on safety.]  The actual sample size will be determined by [CONTACT_882883]-finding design algorithm.  The sample size allows for 95% power since each  of the four co-primary endpoints are required 
to demonstrate statistical significance in order to yield a firm conclusion of beneficial treatment effect on hot flushes.  Conservatively, assuming independence among the four endpoints, this would yield approximately 81% power overall for achieving statistical significance for each of the four endpoints.  Thus, overall power for the tr ial is estimated to be at least 81%; the actual 
power depends on the unknown magnitudes of corr elations among the co-primary endpoints. 
 Adaptive dose-finding design algorithms use results from interim analysis (IA) of accumulating data from the trial to modify dose-choices and / or randomization ratios fo r subsequent subjects 
entering the trial.  Three numbers of IA and two adaptive dose-finding algorithms were evaluated for each of the four potential TRUE underlying dose-response curves (total 24 scenarios = 4 DR 
curves X 3 cohort sizes X 2 design algorithms).  Th e three IA sizes evaluated are (i) no IA's (i.e., 
N=15 per dose group to compare to a non-adaptive design ), (ii) two IAs, and (iii) five IAs.  Both 
the 2-IA and 5-IA designs randomize the initial 25 patients 1:1:1:1:1 to the 5 dose groups (note, 
placebo is the zero dose group) to obtain a r easonable amount of seeding data upon which to 
begin the adaptation.  Note, the actual planned si ze of the first cohort is N=30, which would yield 
results between those of the two sample size scen arios simulated for the adaptive designs.  Hence, 
the actual performance characteristics of the trial fall between the those two sample size scenarios.   Since the timing of the actual IA's may vary due to logistical / enrolment constraints, these two scenarios are representative of the those expected during the trial. Then the 2-IA design carries out a second IA after N=[ADDRESS_1235302]:  CONFIDENTIAL Protocol No.: 814-PM-02

 carried out after the 75 patients are completed.  After the initial IA at N=25, the 5-IA design 
carries out an IA after results of each 10 patients are added to the accumulating data. 
 The two adaptive algorithms are (i) a Bayesian  adaptive Emax (S-shape d) dose-response model 
fit at each IA (COMPASS User Manual), and (ii) a model based on classical T-statistics at each IA (Ivanova, 2008).  The Emax design uses a "vag ue" Bayesian prior distribution on each of the 
four parameters of the S-shaped Emax model in combination with the observed data to estimate the posterior distribution of the Emax model pa rameters from which es timates of mean response 
at each dose are obtained, along with their SE's.  Then randomization ratios are chosen for the next cohort to minimize the variances of the resu lting Emax model estimates at two target levels 
of response, namely hot flush reductions of 6 per day and of 8 per day.  The Emax algorithm was 
set up to recommend stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_882876] a given dose if (a) the probability is > 90% that the mean hot flush reduction at least 8 at that dose, or (b) the probability is <20% that the mean hot flush reduction is at least 5 (i.e., >80% probability that the mean hot flush reduction is <5).  The T-statistic design relies on isotonic regression (i.e., best-fit non-decreasing dose-response curve) derived estimated means for each dose and then computes the resultant T-statistic for estimated mean difference from each target level of  response (hot flush reduction of 6 and of 8) 
for each dose.  Then the subjects in the next cohort are split among the two doses with T-statistics pointing closest to each target level of response and placebo.  The sample sizes of each cohort are 
always 10 on placebo for the 2 IA design, and always 5 on placebo for the 5 IA design, to yield N=[ADDRESS_1235303].  The only stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_882877] T-statistic in the simulation software (Cytel 's COMPASS V1.1) is futility stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]; hence, if 
probability of a significant difference from placebo is <5% for a given dose based on the IA results, then the algorithm recommends that dose is dropped from any further randomization to it.  The 24 scenarios (4 DR curves X 3 cohort sizes X 2 design algorithms) were each simulated [ADDRESS_1235304] a flat dose-response curve (a lpha=0.05 2-sided), and c onclude statistically

 In order to account for recruitme nt rate and lag of data collection and analysis as patients 
continually enter the trial, the simulations were run assuming a 6-week lag for each patient 
entering and their 4 week hot flash frequency data entering the interim analysis.  An average recruitment rate of 5 patients per week was assumed, since the software cannot accommodate 
varying recruitment.  It should be noted that the analysis models fo r the actual trial data w ill be longitudinal mixed 
effects models to model the correlation structure of  all hot flash frequency data at each week from 
baseline to week 12.  Due to software limitations, the simulations only assume available data of 
Week 4, so the performance characteristics in this report are likely conservative.  SIMULATION RESULTS 
 For dose-response curve 1 (DRCID_1), power is approximately 90% for both the adaptive and the non-adaptive designs - highest for the (Emax 90 & 93%; Tstat 85 & 89%; non-adaptive design (88 & 89%).  The adaptive designs achieve this power with slightly smaller overall sample 
sizes (~148 for Emax, ~145 for Tstat), since they have potential for early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16589].  Note that all of the adaptive designs, except th e Emax 3-cohort design, assign fewer subjects to 
the lower [ADDRESS_1235308] TRUE underlying mean  hot flash values less than the lower target 
value 6, and assign the majority of subjects to doses 3 and 4, the former having TRUE response 
equal to the lower target value 6.  The Emax 3-cohort design assigns more subjects to Dose1 
(which has TRUE underlying response 4) than to doses [ADDRESS_1235309] subjects to Dose 4.  The 
subtle distinction between the Emax and Tstat ad aptive designs (more spread of subjects across 
the dose range via Emax design than via Tstat design) arises since the Emax design estimates target doses via optimally fitting the Emax model, whereas the Tstat design seeks to assign most subjects to the two doses closest to the target le vels of response.  The average estimated target 
doses for both designs are very close to the TR UE target values (>4 for the upper target and 
approximately dos e3 for the lower target.  Howe ver, only approximately 2/3 of the simulations 
actually estimate the target dose exactly at Dose3 for the lower target, but nearly all simulations estimate the lower target dose at Dose3, or Dose4 (i.e., at or adjacent to the correct / TRUE target dose).  For dose response curves 2,3 and 4 (DRCID_2, DRCI D_3, DRCID_4) power is at least 94% for 
the adaptive designs, and generally similar to  that for the non-adaptive 1-cohort designs.  The 
Emax design achieves this power with somewhat  smaller average sample sizes (N=133-146) than 
the Tstat and non-adaptive designs. The Tstat design sample sizes are N=146-149 because in a 
small portion of trials the design incorrectly stops early for futility - note the software does not permit inclusion of early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_882878] [NOTE: in the actual trial, the same 
early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_882879]; it is just that the simulation software does not have that feature for the Tstat design].  Note also that the Emax design assigns more subjects to dose 4 (t he highest dose) in order to fit the plateau 
response level, whereas the Tstat design focuse s the dose assignments more at the doses with 
TRUE target levels of response 6 and 8.  The Ts tat design seems slightly better than the Emax 
model in estimating the target doses on average; Tstat design average estimated target doses are generally closer to TRUE target doses or mid-point of TRUE target doses when multiple doses have same TRUE target level of response.  Th e percentage of correct target dose estimates are 
generally higher for the Tstat design than for the Emax design, except for the DRCID_2 lower target dose, for which they are generally similar, but the percentages are generally similar for the Emax adaptive designs compared to the non-adaptive designs, but higher for the Tstat design than

 Type 1 error (false positive, i.e., rejecting the null hypothesis of flat dose-response curve when 
the TRUE underlying dose-response curve is fl at) was estimated via simulation in the same 
manner as performance characteristics were s imulated and summarized for the above four non-
flat dose-response curves (perfo rmance characteristics are summarized in Table 2). Type 1 error 
is estimated to be approximate ly 5% for both adaptive designs and the non-adaptive designs 
analyzed by [CONTACT_882924].  Hence, the adaptive designs adequately 
preserve type 1 error.  Note the much lower av erage sample sizes associated with the adaptive 
designs; they result from the high proportion of  adaptive designs that stop early for a futility 
conclusion (66-78%).  Finally, note the adaptive de signs assign the largest number of subjects to 
dose 4, and minimize assignment to the lower doses.   RECOMMENDATIONS for consideration 
 Simulation software limitations to  a single endpoint at a single  time point make the performance 
characteristics summarized conservative.  The actual analysis model can incorporate all time points of observation and multiple endpoints (freque ncy and severity); hence, actual statistical 
precision and performance characteristics will likely improve during the actual study beyond those levels reported in this simulation report.  An adaptive dose-finding design is preferable to the fixed randomization design since it will allocate more subjects to doses with target levels of response and/or minimize randomization to doses be low or above those with target levels of 
response.  In addition, both the Emax and Tsta t algorithms can be run at each IA and the 
suggested dose-assignments can be compared by [CONTACT_73623] (DRC), which can recommend the best dose ratio assignments in the context of the overall accumulated data 
available at the IA.  Alternatively, depending on the performance characteristic(s) of most interest, the better performing adaptive design on that(those) performance characteristic(s) can be chosen.   REFERENCES

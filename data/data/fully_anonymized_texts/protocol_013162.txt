they did not receive treatment per protocol (i.e., until progre ssion).  However, including just 
patients who had progressed or di ed or who had otherwise come o ff study treatment, while 
excluding patients still on treat ment at the time of the clinic al hold, would introduce bias into 
the assessment of the efficacy of  the study treatment.  Therefo re, all patients enrolled in 
stage 2 prior to the clinical hold will be  excluded from efficacy anal yses and will be 
replaced.  All treated patients wi ll be included in all safety analyses. (5/23/2011)

2.0 BACKGROUND AN D RATIONALE 
 2.1 Cervical Cancer and Its Relatio nship to the Human Papi[INVESTIGATOR_27509] (HPV)  (06/27/2016) 
 
Cervical cancer is the fourth m ost common cancer and the most c ommon cause of 
mortality in women worldwide with 528,[ADDRESS_151546] 
cases present at an advanced sta ge due to lack of effective cer vical cancer screening 
systems.2  In the [LOCATION_002] (US), it is estimated that 12,340 women were diagnosed 
with cancer of the cervix , and 4,030 women died of the disease in 2013.3 
The human papi[INVESTIGATOR_27509] (HPV ) is now recognized to be the pri mary etiologic agent 
for cervical carcinogenesis, and c ervical cancer is the first c ancer recognized by [CONTACT_133918] 100 % attributable to an infecti on with high-risk HPV 
genotypes.[ADDRESS_151547] an asy mptomatic 
course, with clearance of the  virus occurring within 1 or 2 yea rs in 90% of cases.  Ten 
percent of individuals experien ce persistent HPV infection, which increases t heir risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_33919].  U ltimately, approximately one-hal f of the 10% of 
NCI Protocol #: GOG-0265 
Version Date: 05/20/[ADDRESS_151548] invasive cancers and are considered “high-
risk” HPV-genotypes.  HPV-16 accounts for approximately 53% of invasive cervical 
cancer (ICC) cases in most count ries, followed by [CONTACT_33968]-18, which accounts for 
approximately 13%.5  The high-risk HPV genotypes produce 2 oncoproteins, designate d 
E6 and E7, which bind and inactivat e the tumor suppressor’s p53 an d retinoblastoma 
protein (pRB), respectively.  The  E6 mediated inhibition of p53  blocks apoptosis, 
whereas E7 inhibition of pRB abr ogates cell cycle arrest leadin g to deregulated cellular 
proliferation and ultimately malignancy.5 
Persistent HPV infection may lea d initially to abnormal changes  in cervical cells, termed 
cervical dysplasia or cervical int raepi[INVESTIGATOR_69687] (CIN).   However, CIN is a distinct 
clinic pathological entity from I CC and defines premalignant le sions (namely CIN 2/3) 
that, if left untreated, may e ventually progress to ICC.  Howev er, these lesions have a 
high rate of spontaneous remission and can be curatively treated with a minor gynecologic surgical procedure such as loop elect rical electros urgical procedure or a cone 
biopsy. 
In the US, most cases of ICC are  detected at early  stages becau se of the implementation 
of cervical cancer screening programs.  Staging of ICC is usually based on the American 
Joint Committee on Cancer or the International Federation of Gy necology and Obstetrics 
system, which are similar.  Approximately 60% of ICC cases are diagnosed at stage I, 
25% at stage II, 10% at stage III, and 5% at stage IV.
[ADDRESS_151549] treatments for ICC 
include surgery, radiation alone , chemotherapy alone, or combin ation 
radiation/chemotherapy.  Surger y and radiation therapy are considered to be equally 
effective for early-stage, sma ll-volume disease.  For more adva nced disease, that is not 
reliably curable by [CONTACT_44850], addi tional treatments including ra diation and potentially 
systemic chemotherapy are required.  Several clinical trials ha ve shown an overall 
survival advantage with cispla tin concurrent with radiation the rapy (chemoradiation), and 
chemoradiation with cisplatin is the currently recommended trea tment for locally 
advanced cervical cancer.[ADDRESS_151550] of care for patients with recurrent or primary 
metastatic (stage IVB) cervical cancer that is not amenable to surgery or radiation.[ADDRESS_151551] 
100%, stage IB2 and IIB 50%–75%, st age III 30%-50%, and stage I V 15%.  For locally 
recurrent disease, pelvic exenteration can lead to a 5-year sur vival rate of 32%-62% in 
selected patients.[ADDRESS_151552] activ e therapy, has produced

 prognosis of patients with advanced  cervical cancer , there is c ertainly an unmet medical 
need for novel, more efficacious, less toxic therapeutic approa ches for ICC. 
Doublets containing cisplat in (GOG-0169 and GOG-0179) demonstrated superiority over 
single-agent platinum.10,11 The GOG completed GOG-0204, a phase III, four-arm study 
comparing three cisplatin contai ning doublets (gemcitabine, vin orelbine, or topotecan) to 
a control arm of cisplatin/paclitaxel.8  No therapy was superior to cisplatin and paclitaxel, 
and the results demonstrated a trend towards improved quality o f life, progression-free 
survival, and overall survival i n the cisplatin/paclitaxel arm.  Thus, paclitaxel/cisplatin 
remained the preferred platinum-based chemotherapy backbone for  metastatic or 
recurrent cervical cancer.   On August 14, 2014, the FDA approve d the use of 
bevacizumab in combination with pacl itaxel and cisplatin or pac litaxel and topotecan in 
persistent, recurrent, or metasta tic cervical cancer.  This app roval was based on the 
results of the GOG-0240 study,12 which noted a statistically  significant improvement in 
OS for the bevacizumab plus chemo therapy arm (med OS of 16.8 mo nths for 
bevacizumab plus chemotherapy vs. 12.9 months for chemo alone P =0.0132).  
 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], there continues t o be a large unmet medical need for agents with different 
mechanisms of action (such as an tiangiogenics, checkpoint inhib itors, or therapeutic HPV 
immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) that when used alone or in combination can imp rove the survival of 
patients with recurrent cervical cancer.

localization of these antigens , these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_133826].  The ability to deliver antigen to the cytosolic com partment of APCs in order 
to develop HLA class I presenta tion to induce CD8+ cytotoxic T cell responses is widely 
believed to be necessary for developi[INVESTIGATOR_133827] c anti-tumor vaccine. 
 
Several approaches have been emp loyed to develop therapeutic HP V vaccines against 
cervical cancer.  Peptide-based va ccines using E7 peptide have been shown to generate 
cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) th at were protective against HPV -16 E7 positive 
tumors.13-14  One Phase I/II clinical tri al immunized 19 terminally ill cervical cancer 
patients with HLA-A*0201-restri cted HPV 16 E7 peptide and demon strated safety, but 
no CTL responses were detected.15 Another Phase II clinical tri al in end-stage cervical 
cancer patients used E6 or E 7 HLA-A*0201-binding peptides pulse d onto cytokine-
stimulated autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).  The trial showed 
that [ADDRESS_151555] the disadvantage of someti mes leading to tolerance

would not be eligible for treatment.

viral vectors in use.  Phase I/II trials of vaccinia virus expr essing E6 and E7 (TA-HPV) 
demonstrated the vaccine to be  safe, but only [ADDRESS_151557] smallpox may at tenuate a vaccine’s 
efficiency.  In the case of adenovirus, the host may mount a si gnificant humoral and 
cellular response to the adenovira l vector, thereby [CONTACT_133919].  In addition, adverse events that occur  often cannot be 
controlled.  For instance, in the 1960's, smallpox vaccination was the cause of a 
substantial number of adverse ev ents and resulted in a lethal i nfection in approximately 
one out of one million people who received this live vaccinia v accine.25 Recently the use 
of adenovirus for gene therapy has also resulted in a fatality.26 Dendritic cell (DC) based 
vaccines and modified tumor cel l-based vaccines have also been investigated with limited 
success in preclinical models.  The literature provides many references to support the idea tha t many HPV species 
respond to therapeutic agents based upon HPV-16 E7.
27 A phase II study, conducted by 
[CONTACT_133920] m (an NCI-sponsored consortium), immunized [ADDRESS_151558] asia (CIN) III with 
three, monthly subcutaneous vaccinations with 500 mcg of SGN-[ZIP_CODE] [Heat Shock Fusion Protein-Based Immunothera py (HspE7)].  Of the 31 evaluab le patients, 32% 
(10/31) had a complete patholog ic response; 39% (12/31) had a partial response and 29% 
(9/31) had stable disease. The  overall response rate was 71% (2 2/31, 95% C.I.=55-87%). 
No patient progressed.  Fifty-five  percent (17/31) were HPV-[ADDRESS_151559] all 
cervical cancer patients (not just those who are HPV-16 positiv e) would benefit from the 
vaccine targeted at HPV-16 E7. Further, it supports the idea that HPV epi[INVESTIGATOR_133829]. Resear ch completed by [CONTACT_133921], 
formerly Stressgen, reports extremely high efficacy using the H PV-16 E7 antigen even in 
non-HPV-16 positive patients; which demonstrates the antigen ha s immuno-therapeutic 
activity across HPV types.
28  Davidson et al. reported cross reactivity to the E7 antigen 
and responses in patients with other HPV types in a trial of a vaccinia based HPV-16 E7

some epi[INVESTIGATOR_133834]-specifi c and others were cross reactive with other HPV types.32  
Additional support for the cro ss reactivity of HPV-16 E7 with o ther HPV types has been 
demonstrated in human HLA-A2 transgenic mice.33  It further appears that certain HPV-
16 E7 epi[INVESTIGATOR_133835], as Nilges et al demonstrated that “…cross-

2.3 Recombinant Listeria monocyt ogenes (Lm) as a Vaccine Vector  
 
The advantages that Listeria monocytogenes possesses as a vaccine ve ctor are rooted in 
its biology.  It is a beta hemolytic gram-positive facultative intracellular bacterium that 
has been used to study cell mediated immunity for decades.[ADDRESS_151560] cell  by [CONTACT_133922].  Also unlike 
Salmonella,  Listeria  is a gram positive organism, thus does not release endotoxin, a rate 
limiting attribute of Salmonella.  Because Listeria  quickly leaves the circulation 
becoming an intracellular infection, and because it replicates in the cytoplasm, humoral 
immunity does not play a m ajor role in combating Listerial  infections.  Peptides derived 
from L. monocytogenes in the phagolysosome and the c ytosol can be presented by [CONTACT_133923] I and Class II molecu les, inducing both CD4+ and CD8+  T-cell responses.  
Listeria  has other useful properties, s uch as stimulating monopoiesis, stimulating the 
differentiation and maturation of  APC, and the generation of a particularly strong innate

nucleus of HPV associated tumors .  Most therapi[INVESTIGATOR_133836].  The  ability to deliver antigen t o the cytosolic compartment

2.4  Listeria monocytogenes Expr essing HPV 16-E7 (ADXS11-001 Im munotherapy) 
(06/27/2016) 
 
ADXS11-001 is a live attenuated Listeria monocytogenes ( Lm) immunotherapy, 
developed for the treatment of  HPV-associated cancers.  ADXS11- 001 is bioengineered 
to secrete an antigen -adjuvant fusion prot ein (tLLO-HPV-E7) con sisting of a truncated 
fragment of the listeriolysin O  (truncated LLO, tLLO) fused to the full length E7 peptide 
of HPV-16.  ADXS11-[ADDRESS_151561] been manufactured under GM P conditions and in 
compliance with GMP regulat ions, and are so documented.

2.5 ADXS11-001 Mechanism of Action (06/27/2016) 
 
ADXS11-001 is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_133838] (APC ) within the subject.  
This causes activation of the APC and results in a multi-factorial stimulation of innate immunity.  To the subject, this activation can manifest as flu- like symptoms or symptoms 
associated with cytokine release  that occur during or in the ho urs immediately following 
administration.  Once inside the APC, ADXS11-001 can escape the phagolysosome into the cytoplasm where it secretes t he HPV-E7-tLLO fusion protein.  This peptide, along 
with other Lm peptides, is very rapi[INVESTIGATOR_133839]-presented through major 
histocompatibility complex (MH C) Class 1 and Class 2 pathways.  This cross-
presentation, in immunologic context of responding to a “perceived” acute infection, stimulates the development of ada ptive immunity culminating in HPV-specific effector 
T-cells that can infiltrate into t he tumor microenvironment (TM E) and destroy tumor 
cells immunologically.  Advaxis Lm-LLO immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_133840] d effects on the immune system an d the 
ability to neutralize mechanis ms of immune tolerance.  These Lm-LLO immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_133841] a target-specific T-cell immunity.  High avidity T-cells are generated where 
possible, but when they are not, Lm stimulates an up-regulat ion of T-cell responses to 
sub-dominant epi[INVESTIGATOR_322].  Advaxis Lm-LLO immunotherapi [INVESTIGATOR_133842].  This increased LLO se cretion triggers

in the number and function of regul atory T-cells and myeloid-de rived suppressor cells 
(MDSC) in the TME, which enables  tumor cell killing, even when the T-cells are lower

2.6 Summary of Previous Clinical Studies (06/27/2016) 
 
Refer to the Investigator Broc hure (IB) for detailed preclinica l and clinical data. 
 
2.6.1 Lm-LLO-E7-07:  Phase 1 Experience 
In the initial Phase 1 dose esca lation study (Lm-LLO-E7-01), AD XS11-001 was assessed 
in 15 subjects with previously tr eated metastatic, refractory o r recurrent invasive cervical 
cancer.
52  ADXS11-001 was administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion at doses of 
1 x 109 to 1 x 1010 CFU followed by a second dose 3 weeks later.  Overall, ADXS11- 001 
infusion was safely administere d and well tolerated in end-stage subjects who had failed 
multiple prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
 No pre-medications were given in this study and all subjects ex perienced flu-like 
symptoms and/or symptoms associated with CRS.  The most commonl y reported AEs 
were pyrexia (100%), vomiting (60%), chills, headache and anemi a (53.3% each), nausea 
and tachycardia (46.7% each), a nd musculoskeletal pain (26.7%).   At all doses, AEs were 
acute and transient in most subjects, and responded to non-pres cription symptomatic 
treatment with no observed listeriosis or Lm shedding.  A total of 9 (60%) subjects 
experienced Grade 3 AEs, and in 6 ( 40%) of those subjects AEs w ere considered 
treatment-related (pyrexia i n [ADDRESS_151563],  and increased gamma-
glutamyltransferase [GGT] leve ls in 2 subjects).  No Grade [ADDRESS_151564] dose of 1 x 10
10 CFU led to a dose-limiting toxic ity (DLT) of Grade 2 diastolic 
hypotension.  Under typi[INVESTIGATOR_133844] a DLT (as defined  per the protocol) in Phase 
[ADDRESS_151565] met the criteria for DLT.  Two deaths occurred during the stu dy period and were considered  unrelated to ADXS11-
001 administration.  Although not de signed to assess efficacy, stable disease (SD) was 
reported in 7 of 13 (54%) evaluable subjects, and [ADDRESS_151566] (8% ) had an unconfirmed 
partial tumor response.  Base d on the AE profile, all subsequent studies incorporate the 
administration of NSAIDs and an tiemetic medica tions pre- and po st-infusion to help 
reduce the incidence and severit y of AEs related  to cytokine re lease.  As an additional 
precaution, a course of oral an tibiotics is initiated on Day [ADDRESS_151567] in clearance of the Lm. 
 
2.6.2 Lm-LLO-E7-15:  Phase 2 Study of ADXS11-001 vs ADXS11-001 and Cisplatin in 
Recurrent, Refractory Cervical Cancer

 therapy, including chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.  Eligible subjects were randomized 
1:1 to ADXS11-001 or ADXS11-001 + cisplatin.  Subjects in the ADXS11-001 group received 1 cycle (3 doses of 1 x 10
9 CFU) of ADXS11-001 at 28-day intervals.  Subjects 
in the ADXS11-001 + cisplatin gro up received a single dose of A DXS11-001, followed 
28 days later by 5 weekly doses of cisplatin (40 mg/m2), followed 28 days later by 1 
cycle of ADXS11-001; as a precautionary measure, a course of oral antibiotics was given to ensure clearance of the Lm .  After first dosing, subjec ts were followed at 3, 6, 9, 12, 
and 18 months; [ADDRESS_151568] udy was OS.  Of 109 enrolled subj ects, 89 (81.7%) 
subjects at 3 months, 70 (64.2%) at 6 months, 49 (45%) at 9 mon ths, 35 (32%) at 12 
months, and 24 (22%) at 18 months w ere alive, suggesting that A DXS11-001 is an active 
agent in recurrent cervical can cer.  There was no statistically  significant difference in the 
median duration of OS betwee n ADXS11-001 and ADXS11-001 + cispl atin (p = 0.9993), 
nor was there any statistically si gnificant effect of disease s tatus, prior therapy, or Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status on OS betw een treatment 
groups.  Of 69 subjects in the efficac y population, 10% of subjects had an objective tumor 
response.  Complete response (CR) was recorded as the best response in 5 subjects (3 ADXS11-001; 2 ADXS11-001 + cisplatin ), partial response (PR) in  6 subjects (3 
ADXS11-001; 3 ADXS11-001 + cisplat in), SD in 31 subjects (16 AD XS11-001; 15 
ADXS11-001 + cisplatin), and progressive disease (PD) in 27 subjects (13 ADXS11-001; 14 ADXS11-001 + cisplatin).  Tumor response at 3, 6, 9, 12, and  18 months was 
comparable between treatment groups.  The disease control rate was 39% (42/109).  
Results of the safety profile are shown in Table 1. 
 
2.6.3 GOG-0265:  Phase 2 Evaluation of ADXS11-01 in Recurrent, Refractory Cervical 
Cancer 
 
GOG-0265 is an ongoing study being conducted by [CONTACT_69142], throug h sponsorship by [CONTACT_133927] (CTEP).  It is a 2-stage study designed to 
evaluate ADXS11-001 (3 doses of 1 x 10

advanced, metastatic, or recurren t squamous or non-squamous car cinoma of the cervix 
who have had at least 1 prior systemic chemotherapeutic regimen  in the metastatic 
setting.  The primary objectives of  the study are to evaluate: 
 
The tolerability, safet y, nature and degree of toxicity of ADXS 11-[ADDRESS_151569] 12 months after 
initiating therapy  Twenty-nine subjects were en rolled to Stage 1 of the study, of which 3 were never treated 
with ADXS11-001.  Among the 26 subjects, 8 (30%) had 1 prior therapy, 14 (54%) had 2 prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_13265] 4 (16%) had 3 prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_133845].

 The study is being conducted according to the GOG’s standard Si mon 2-stage design (for 
recurrent/refractory cervical cancer).  A Stage 1 efficacy bar of 20% 12-month survival 
was established as a predetermi ned criterion (by a logistic reg ression model from 17 
studies conducted by [CONTACT_133928] 50 0 subjects with recurrent/re fractory cervical cancer) 
to be met in order for the study to proceed to Stage 2. Based o n the historical data in 
subjects with recurrent/refractor y cervical cance r, the expecte d 12-month survival rate is 
10-15%.

   2.7 Summary of Safety of ADXS11-001 (06/27/2016) 
As of January 1, 2015, [ADDRESS_151571] been admini stered to 229/230 
enrolled subjects at doses of 5 x 10
7, 3.3 x 108, 1 x 109, 3.3 x 109, and 1 x 1010 CFU.  In 
the Phase 1 study, 100% of subjects (n=15) have experienced flu -like AEs or symptoms 
associated with cytokine release  syndrome. The incorporation of  NSAIDs and antiemetic 
medications pre and post infusions has effectively reduced the incidence of these symptoms from 100% to 37%.  In addition, a course of antibiotic s is given 3 days after 
each dose of ADXS11-001 as a precau tionary measure to ensure cl earance of the Lm.  
From the clinical experience i n 230 subjects, a clear pattern o f mild to moderate 
treatment-related AEs consistent with cytokine release symptoms  (e.g., constitutional 
symptoms such as fever, chills, rigors, headache, nausea, vomit ing, tachycardia, shortness 
of breath, hypotension, and rash) a re commonly seen and typi[INVESTIGATOR_133847] 2-4 hours after 
infusion.  Symptoms either self-r esolve or respond quickly to symptomatic treatment.

 2.8 Rationale for Survival Endpoint and Confirmation of Progres sion (5/23/2011) 
 
Unlike cytotoxic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_133851] h directly kill tumor cells and diminish tumor size, 
immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_133852].  First, they effect changes in the immune system and then those changes exert a therapeutic effect on the disease.  This process may take month s to fully occur.  In 
patients with rapi[INVESTIGATOR_133853], immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_133854]
59-61; which would be defined as a therapeutic failure 
under RECIST criteria and would be a response not observed at a ll if the evaluation 
model was based upon progression fr ee survival (PFS), as the patient would not have 
been evaluated on-study subseque nt to initial disease progressi on. However these patients 
experienced overall survival matching those who had exhibited t raditional PR and CRs. 
Whereas PFS is an adequate surroga te for overall survival when treating with cytotoxic 
agents, multiple studies of immunotherapy have demonstrated tha t PFS does not correlate 
with overall survival and therefore is an inadequate surrogate for overall survival in 
immunotherapy. (5/23/2011) 
 The patient population in this current trial has historically been associated with a median life expectancy of approximately [ADDRESS_151577] are 
NCI Protocol #: GOG-0265 
Version Date: 05/20/2016  
- 17 - 
 inadequate surrogates for clin ical benefit and survival in immu notherapy, time to death is 
the primary efficacy endpoint in this trial. (5/23/2011) 
 Because a positive response to an immunotherapy treatment will always involve the 
infiltration of tumor-specific wh ite blood cells and local inflammation in the tumor tissue 
at some point, the total lesion size circumscribed by [CONTACT_941] “tumo r” area will typi[INVESTIGATOR_133855]. For thi s reason, particular care must 
be applied when using tumor measur ement-based criteria like REC IST to make clinical 
decisions about determin ing disease progression.  (5/23/2011) 
 
2.[ADDRESS_151578] r eceived only one prior 
chemotherapy regimen (12/23/2013) (06/27/2016) 
 
Immunotherapy of cancer is an indi rect form of cancer treatment. In order for patients to 
derive potential clinical benef it, they need to mount an immunologic response after the 
treatment is administered in orde r for their immune system to resist progression, or 
induce tumor responses against their malignancy.   For ADXS11-0 01, clinical benefit is 
presumed to be based on the generation of tumor-antigen specifi c adaptive immunity, 
infiltration of those cells int o the tumor and a reduction in r egulatory T-cell (Treg) and 
myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) mediated immunologic tol erance within the 
tumor microenvironment. The best  responses in-vitro were seen a fter three treatments 
because each subsequent treatment has a “booster effect” resulting in greater numbers of antigen specific cytotoxic T-cells. It takes time for such an i mmunologic response to 
develop and ultimately be reflected in the growth characteristi cs of a patients tumors. For 
this reason most immunotherapie s are not typi[INVESTIGATOR_133856] [ADDRESS_151579] e prior chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_133857]. In 
the “run-in” phase, several patients expi[INVESTIGATOR_133858]11-001 treatments and/or be asses sed. For these reasons, 
amending the protocol to enroll  patients who have not received more than one prior 
chemotherapy regimen in the recurrent setting better enables the opportunity for clinical benefit and assessment in this refractory patient population. 
 
2.10 Rationale for Additional Treatment Cycles (03/09/2015)  
 
ADXS11-[ADDRESS_151580] clin ical benefit in patients.  On e can be described as its 
“vaccine effect” which results in the generation of tumor antig en specific cytotoxic T 
cells which replicate and distribute throughout the body and have been shown to 
concentrate in tumors.  The second is the ability of Lm-LLO vec tors to induce a relative 
reduction in the number of imm
unologic inhibitory cells, Tregs and MDSCs in the tumor 
NCI Protocol #: GOG-0265 
Version Date: 05/20/2016  
- 18 - 
 microenvironment coupled with a gr eatly reduced capacity of Tregs and MDSCs to 
secrete the inhibitory cytokines IL-10 and argin ase-1 (respecti vely). 
 Each time a patient receives an infusion of ADXS11-001, more T-cells are generated 
which can migrate to the tumors  and mediate CD8+ T cell killing of tumor cells.  
Repeated dosing every 3-4 weeks  x three has been established in  animal models to 
develop a “booster effect” resu lting in a greater number of ant igen-specific CD8 T cells.  
Larger numbers of antigen specifi c T-cells in the  periphery as well as infiltrating tumors 
consistently results in better tu moricidal effects.  Therefore more T cells equals better 
tumor killing.  Furthermore, in these models, higher doses (CFU s) consistently resulted in 
a greater number of antigen speci fic CD8+ T cells, which engenders better tumorcidal 
activity, therefore establishing a  clear “dose effect”.  Unlike most vaccine approaches, 
Advaxis LM-LLO vectors do not gene rate neutralizing antibodies which enables the 
potential of giving repeating cyc les of treatment to patients w ho could potentially benefit.  
Together, since repeating doses of ADXS11-001 generates more tu moricidal CD8+ 
Tcells and since there is no contraindication to giving repeati ng cycles of treatment.  
Patients with bulky and/or resista nt tumors may benefit from ad ding repeated cycles of 
treatment beyond the initial 3- dose cycle.  Each subsequent cyc le can generate more 
cancer fighting cells and could deepen or help maintain clinica l benefit achieved from the 
initial cycle of tr eatment.  This is particularly relevant in s ettings where additional 
treatment options  are limited. 
 The ability of Lm-LLO  vectors to reduce th e number and function  of inhibitory Treg and 
MDSCs within the tumor microenvironment is a relatively recent discovery that is 
exclusively associated with Adva xis Lm-LLO vectors like ADXS11-001.  The precise 
mechanism is still under invest igation, but it cl early involves  a relative reduction in the % 
of T regs and MDSCs coupled with a  massive change in the ratio of effector to 
suppressor cells in the tumor micro-environment (TME).  It is a lso clearly li nked to the 
secretion of the tLLO fusion peptide by [CONTACT_133931].  Furthermore, in 
animal models the suppressor ce lls remaining in the TME virtual ly lose their ability to 
secrete inhibitory cytokines for a generation.  The duration of  this change in suppressor 
function in patients remains unde termined thus far.  However, c linical evidence would 
suggest that it is temporary because there is no evidence of au toimmunity and also since, 
after one 3-dose treatment cycle , partial tumor responses were observed that remained 
constant for several months a nd subsequently begin to grow again after 6 or 9 m
onths. 
 Each administration of the live attenuated vectors results in a  new secretion of the tLLO 
fusion peptide which would there by [INVESTIGATOR_1312]-establish the conditions that inhibit suppressor cell 
activity within the tumor microenvironment.  Therefore repeatin g doses or cycles of 
treatment could benefit the pati ent by [CONTACT_4205][INVESTIGATOR_133859].  Taking all of these things together, if a patient has resistant  or bulky disease, tolerates 
initial treatment well and still has evidence of residual tumor , they may benefit from 
receiving repeating cycles of t reatment.  Each administration g enerates more tumor-

 specific CD8+ T cells which can fight against the tumors as wel l as re-establish a tumor 
microenvironment beneficial t o effector T cell activity. 
 In the case of recurrent cervica l cancer, there are limited tre atment options.  ADXS11-
[ADDRESS_151581] further prolo nged or even furthered 
these clinical benefits.  Sin ce ADXS11-001 is relatively well t olerated and there is no 
contraindication to repeated dos ing, and since each administrat ion can generate more

 4.1.5 Handling Precautions: (05/06/2013) (03/09/201 5) (06/27/2016)   
 ADXS11-001 is classified a BSL-2, minimally pathogenic.  Precau tions as stated in the 
BMBL 5
th Edition61 [62] include:  
 
Agent: ADXS11-001, live attenuated genetically engineered live vaccine  (5/23/2011) 
ADXS11-001 is a live attenuated strain  of Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) that has been 
attenuated such that it is cleared by [CONTACT_133935] (SCID) mice 
lacking cellular immunity and ga mma interferon knock-out mice l acking adaptive 
immunity.  It has also been altered such that it is impossible for it to recombine with 
wild-type Lm.  In the Phase [ADDRESS_151610] dose of ADXS11-001 tested (1 x 1010 CFU).[ADDRESS_151611] weakened

Precautions as stated in the BMBL 5th Edition include: 
 
Wild-type L. monocytogenes poses a potential hazard to laboratory personnel.  The 
Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, aerobic bac illi are hemolytic and catalase-positive. 
Bacteria have been isolated from soil, dust, human food, animals, and asymptomatic 
humans. Most cases of listeriosis have arisen  from eating conta minated food products, 
most notably soft cheeses, raw meat, and unwashed raw vegetables.  Although healthy adults and children can contract a Listeria infection, they do not usually become seriously ill. At risk of severe illness are pregnant women, newborns, and persons with 
impaired immune function.  
 Laboratory Hazards : Wild-type Listeria monocytogenes are ubiquitous in the 
environment and  may be found in feces, cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872]  (CSF), and blood, as well as 
food and environmental materials . Ingestion is the most common mode of exposure, but 
wild-type Listeria can also cause eye and skin infections following a direct expos ure. 
Wild-type Lm  infections in pregnant women occur most often in the third trim ester and 
may precipi[INVESTIGATOR_133861]. Transplacental transmission of Lm poses a grave risk to the fetus 
and may result in disseminated abscesses contributing to a mortality rate of nearly 100%. 
 
Recommended Precautions : BSL-2 practices, containment equipment, and facilities are 
recommended for activities with  clinical specimens and cultures  known or suspected to 
contain the agent. Gloves and e ye protection should be worn whi le handling the agent.  
Pregnant women who work with Lm in the clinical or  research laborat ory setting should 
be fully informed of the potenti al hazards associated with the organism, including 
potential risks to the fetus. 
 
Disposing of Contaminated Materials: 
 
Gloves should be used while clean ing spi[INVESTIGATOR_3353].  Unless ingested o rally or parenterally no 
pathologic hazard exists.  Contaminated materials can be disposed of in sealed containers 
as medical waste (e.g. close d plastic bags).  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_133862] (e.g. Clorox).  See Section 4.1.12.  
 4.1.6 Drug preparation and administration: (03/09/2015) (06/27/2016) 
Only sterile containers will be used in the preparation of these materials.  They may be autoclaved glassware, disposable containers, or other sterile m aterials as provided for 
within each institution’s SOP.  
Please note that ADXS11-001, the Investigational Study Drug, is a live, highly attenuated 
microbe, L monocytogenes, which can multiply, thus increasing t he dosage, or die off, thus 
decreasing the dosage.  ADXS11-001 is stable for 6 hours when stored at room temperature

[IP_ADDRESS] Please refer to Section 2. 6 for summary information on the ADXS11-001 AE profile. 
 [IP_ADDRESS] ADXS11-001 is a live attenua ted bioengineered nonpathog enic strain of Lm, and one that 
is known to stimulate a strong inn ate immune response character ized by [CONTACT_133938] .  This pattern of side 
effects is consistent with  other immunotherapy agents. 
 [IP_ADDRESS] The most likely AEs associated with ADXS11-001 are comp rised primarily of individual 
flu-like symptoms (e.g., fever, chills, body ache, and fatigue) or cytokine release symptoms (e.g., headache, nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, shortn ess of breath, 
hypotension and rash).  The symptoms usually present within 2-[ADDRESS_151615] up to 24 hours.  No 
cumulative toxicity has been observed.

 5.1 Patient Entry and Registration 
 
For patients in the safety l ead-in, the GOG Statistical and Dat a Center’s web-based 
patient reservation system (available at the GOG web menu page)  will be used, in which 
slots for particular patients are reserved.  Reservations are n ot transferrable to other 
patients, and if the patient is  not enrolled within the require d timeframe, the reservation is 
then cancelled and the slot is then made available to other pat ients and sites.  If all slots 
are reserved, patients can be a dded to a waiting list for that dose level.  NOTE:  The 
safety lead-in has been completed.  (03/09/2015) 
 All site staff will use OPEN t o enroll patients to this study.  OPEN can be accessed at on 
the GOG web menu page and clicking on the OPEN link.    Prior to accessing OPEN site staff should verify the following:  
  All eligibility criteria have b een met within the protocol stat ed timeframes. Site staff 
should use the registration f orms provided on the group web site as a tool to verify 
eligibility. All patients have signed an a ppropriate consent form and HIPAA authorization form (if 
applicable).    Access requirements for OPEN:   Site staff will need to be regi stered with CTEP and have a vali d and active CTEP-IAM 
account. This is the same account (user id and password) used f or the CTSU members'

cytokine release symptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_133879] d are mediated by a 
different mechanism of action.  S igns/symptoms of infusion reac tions may include: 
allergic reaction/hypersensitivity (including drug fever); arth ralgia (joint pain); 
bronchospasm; cough; dizziness;  dyspnea (shortness of breath); fatigue (asthenia, 
lethargy, malaise); headache; hype rtension; hypotension; myalgi a (muscle pain); nausea; 
pruritic/itching; rash/ desquama tion; rigors/ch ills; sweating (diaphoresis); tachycardia; 
tumor pain (onset or exacerbati on of tumor pain due to treatmen t); urticaria (hives, welts, 
wheals); and vomiting.

6.3 Listeriosis and Listeria In fection – Identification and Man agement (06/27/2016)  
 
A person with (wt) listeriosis usually presents with fever and muscle aches, sometimes 
preceded by [CONTACT_133945].  Almos t everyone who is 
diagnosed with listeriosis has a n "invasive" infection, in whic h the bacteria spread 
beyond the gastrointestinal tract .  The symptoms vary with the infected person.  Pregnant

analysis of spi[INVESTIGATOR_133881]. 
 For symptomatic subjects, diagnos is is confirmed only after iso lation of Lm from a 
normally sterile site, such as bl ood or spi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (in the se tting of nervous system 
involvement), or amniotic flui d/placenta (in the setting of pre gnancy).  Stool samples are 
of limited use and are not recommended.  Lm can be isolated readily on routine media, but care must be taken to disti nguish this organism from other Gram-positive rods, 
particularly diphtheroids.  Select ive enrichment media improve rates of isolation from 
contaminated specimens.  You ca n expect that the cultures will take approximately 1-[ADDRESS_151650] tested concentration o f the following 
antimicrobial agents:  ampi[INVESTIGATOR_10312], amoxicillin/K clavulanate, c iprofloxacin, erythromycin,

for [ADDRESS_151653] dose of study tre atment. 
Should a diagnosis of listeriosis  be made at any point after treatment with ADXS11-001 
and the 6-month course of oral ant ibiotics are completed, immed iate and intensive IV 
antibiotic treatment (ampi[INVESTIGATOR_10312] +/- gentamycin or other IV ant ibiotic regimen as 
indicated) is required  An infec tious disease consult should be  obtained.   Based on each 
individual subject’s case and at the discretion of the treating  physician, the removal of 
any foreign medical object that ha s been present since treatmen t with ADXS11-001 was 
initiated may be warranted.  It is extremely important that the  Investigator, his/her 
research staff, other healthcare providers involved in the care  of the subject as well as 
each subject participating in thi s study are educated and made aware of the signs and 
symptoms of listeriosis and the  potential for delayed listeremi a/listeriosis.  Educational 
materials for the Investigator , research staff, health care pro viders and subjects will be 
prepared and educational training performed.  
 6.4 Major and Minor Surgeries and ADXS11-001 Treatment ( 06/27/2016) 
 
No formal studies of the e ffect of ADXS11-[ADDRESS_151654] been conducted.  
However, based on its mechanism of  action it is not expected th at administration of 
ADXS11-001 would complicate wound healing.  Therefore, a subjec t may initiate or 
resume study treatment 2 weeks after minor surgery (i.e., surge ry involving little risk to 
the life of the subject; specifi cally an operation on the super ficial structures of the body 
or a manipulative procedure th at does not involve a serious ris k) if the wound has 
completely healed and there are no wound healing complications.   A subject who has 
wound healing complications follo wing minor surgery, received m ajor surgery or 
requires new implants and/or devices (permitted by [CONTACT_760]) during the course of the 
study, must wait a minimum of [ADDRESS_151655] recovered f rom any toxicity 
(e.g., return to baseline or Grade 1) and/or complication befor e the next infusion of study 
treatment.  Sponsor consultation is required prior to resuming study treatment for these 
subjects.  If the treatment is  delayed due to concomitant surge ry beyond [ADDRESS_151656] may be discontinued from the study .

In this study, disease paramete rs (section 8.11) and methods fo r tumor evaluation 
(Section 8.12)--but not evaluation of tumor response--will be in accordance with the 
Response Evaluation Criteria in S olid Tumors (RECIST) guideline  Version 1.1.[69]  
RECIST 1.1 response criteria are  primarily designed to evaluate the early effects of 
cytotoxic agents, and depend on tumor shrinkage to demonstrate biologic activity. 
However, clinical evidence of  tumor responses seen with immunotherapeutic agents such 
as ADXS11-001 can take longer t o achieve, and may occur after a  period of disease 
stabilization or following an initial increase in tumor burden. In light of the limitations of utilizing RECIST1.1 to evaluate immunomodulatory agents, immune -related response 
criteria (irRC) have been propos ed to systematically detect the  novel response patterns 
observed with immunologic agents.
[ADDRESS_151676] v1.1. (See also Section 8.2). 
(06/27/2016) 
8.1.1 Disease Parameters   
Measurable disease:  Measurable lesions are defined as those th at can be accurately 
measured in at least one dimen sion (longest diameter to be reco rded) as >[ADDRESS_151677] 
scan, as >[ADDRESS_151678] x-ray, or >[ADDRESS_151679] be recorded in decimal fractio ns of centimete rs. 
 Note:  Tumor lesions that are si tuated in a previously irradiated area will not be 
considered measurable unless progression is documented or a bio psy is obtained to 
confirm persistence at least  90 days following completion of ra diation therapy. 
 Malignant lymph nodes:  To be consi dered pathologically enlarge d and measurable, a 
lymph node must be >[ADDRESS_151680] scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed.  Non-measurable disease:  All othe r lesions (or sites of disease ), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis), 
are considered non-measurable d isease.  Leptomeningeal disease,  ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, i nflammatory breast disease, 
and abdominal/pelvic masses (i dentified by [CONTACT_133947] t CT or MRI), are 
considered as non-measurable.  Notes:   Bone lesions:  Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions, with identifiable soft 
tissue components, that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_133948].  Blastic bone lesions are non-measurable. 
NCI Protocol #: GOG-0265 
Version Date: 05/20/2016  
- 57 - 
  Cystic lesions that meet the cr iteria for radiographically defi ned simple cysts should not 
be considered as malignant lesi ons (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they 
are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  “Cystic lesions” thought to represent cystic metastases 
can be considered as measurable l esions, if they meet the defin ition of measurability 
described above. However, if non-cy stic lesions a re present in the same patient, these are 
preferred for selecti on as target lesions. 
  Target lesions:  All measurable  lesions up to a maximum of 2 l esions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representativ e of all involved organs, should be identified as target 
lesions and recorded and measured at ba seline.  Target lesions should be selected on the 
basis of their size (lesions w ith the longest diameter), be rep resentative of all involved 
organs, and in addition should be tho se that lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the larges t lesion does not lend itself 
to reproducible measurement, in w hich circumstance the next lar gest lesion which can be 
reproducibly measured should be s elected.  A sum of the diamete rs (longest for non-
nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target les ions will be calculated and 
reported as the baseline sum diam eters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, 
then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline s um diameters will be used 
as reference to further charact erize any objective tumor regres sion in the measurable 
dimension of the disease.  
 Non-target lesions:  All other  lesions (or sites of disease), i ncluding any measurable 
lesions over and above the 5 targe t lesions should be identifie d as non-target lesions and 
should also be recorded at baselin e.  Measurements of these les ions are not required, but 
the presence, absence, or in r are cases unequivocal progression  of each should be noted 
throughout follow-up.  
 8.1.2 Methods for Evalu ation of Disease: 
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notatio n using a ruler or 
calipers.  All baseline evaluati ons should be performed as clos ely as possible to the 
beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the 
treatment.  The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesi on at baseline and during follow-up. Imaging-based 
evaluation is preferre d to evaluation by [CONTACT_12148] u nless the lesion(s) being 
followed cannot be imaged but are a ssessable by [CONTACT_461]. 
 Clinical lesions: Clinical lesions wi ll only be considered measurable when they a re 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and 10 mm diameter as 
assessed using calipers (e.g., ski n nodules).  In the case of s kin lesions, documentation by 
[CONTACT_6775], including a rul er to estimate the size of th e lesion, is recommended.  
 Chest x-ray:  Lesions on chest x-ray are accepta ble as measurable lesions when they are 
NCI Protocol #: GOG-0265 
Version Date: 05/20/[ADDRESS_151681] and MRI: This guideline has defined measurabili ty of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_151682] slice thickness greate r than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measu rable lesion should be 
twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain s ituations (e.g., for body 
scans), but NOT lung.    Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables  involved in MRI, which 
greatly impact image quality, le sion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measureme nt.  Furthermore, the 
availability of MRI is variable  globally.  As with CT, if an MR I is performed, the 
technical specifications of th e scanning sequences used should be optimized for the 
evaluation of the type and site  of disease.  Furthermore, as wi th CT, the modality used at 
follow-up should be the same as w as used at baseline, and the l esions should be 
measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the  scope of the RECIST 
guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body 
parts, and diseases.  Ideally, subs equent image acquisitions sh ould use the same type of 
scanner and follow the baseline imaging protocol as closely as possible.  If possible, body 
scans should be performed with br eath-hold scanning techniques.  
 FDG-PET/CT: At present, the low -dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a 
combined PET-CT is not always  of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST 
measurements.  However, FDG-PET/CT may be used in this study if  the CT portion of 
this study is a diagnos tic quality CT with contrast (oral and I V) allowing for tumor 
measurements. If it is not of di agnostic quality, a diagnostic CT scan must be done.  
While FDG-PET/CT scan response assessments need additional stud y, it is reasonable to 
incorporate the use of FDG-PET/ CT scanning to complement CT sca nning in tumor 
assessment. If a post-baseline FDG-PET/CT scan shows evidence o f a new lesion, 
progressive disease must be confirmed ≥ four weeks later by [CONTACT_3610], and classification 
of progressive disease will be m ade based on irRECIST criteria below. (10/22/2012) 
 Note:  A “positive” FDG-PET scan lesion means one that is FDG avid with an uptake greater than twice that of the s urrounding tissue on the attenu ation corrected image. 
 Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used 
as a method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their 
entirety for independent review at a later date and, because th ey are operator dependent, it 
cannot be guaranteed that the sa me technique and measurements w ill be taken from one 
assessment to the next.  If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_133949], confirmation by [CONTACT_12154].  If there is concern about radiation 
exposure at CT, MRI may be used i nstead of CT in selected instances. 
 Endoscopy, Laparoscopy: The uti lization of these techniques for  objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised.  Howev er, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete

 pathological response when biops ies are obtained or to determin e relapse in trials where 
recurrence following complete re sponse (CR) or surgical resecti on is an endpoint. 
 Cytology, Histology: These tec hniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete res ponses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor 
types, such as germ cell tumors , where known residual benign tu mors can remain). 
 It is mandatory to obtain cyto logical confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion 
that appears or worsens during t reatment when measureable disea se has met criteria for 
response or stable disease.  This confirmation is necessary to differentiate response or 
stable disease versus progressive disease, as an effusion may b e a side effect of the 
treatment.  
8.1.3 Response Criteria  (RECIST 1.1) (10/22/2012)  
 
THIS SECTION IS FOR REFERENCE ONLY.  Refer to Section 8. 2 for response 
criteria to be used in this study. 
Determination of response should t ake into consideration all ta rget (See 8.131) and non-
target lesions ( See 8.132 ) and if appropriate, biomarkers ( See 8.133). (06/27/2016) 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR): Disappe arance of all target lesions.  A ny pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or non-targ et) must have reduction in sho rt axis to <10 mm. 
 Partial Response (PR):  At leas t a 30% decrease in the sum of t he diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference th e baseline sum diameters. 
 Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of  the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference th e smallest sum on study (this in cludes the baseline sum if 
that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative in crease of 20%, the sum must 
also demonstrate an absolute in crease of at least [ADDRESS_151683]  be confirmed after 3-4 
weeks in the absence of clinical  deterioration. (N ote:  the appearance of one or more 
small new lesions is not consid ered progression if when added to total tumor burden it 
does not increase by 20%). PD need not be confirmed if accompanied by [CONTACT_133950] (decreas ing performance status, organ  function, other clinical 
impression). (5/23/2011) 
 Stable Disease (SD): Neither su fficient shrinkage to qualify fo r PR nor sufficient increase 
to qualify for PD, taking as ref erence the smallest sum diamete rs while on study 
 
Not evaluable (NE): When at leas t one target lesion is not eval uated at a particular time

a single lesion increase and be considered with the total tumor burden. (5/23/2011)  Not evaluable (NE): When at l east one non-target lesion is not evaluated at a particular

 [IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Biomarkers   Biomarker measurements are no t used to determine response or progression in this study. 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Best Overa ll (unconfirmed) Response 
 The best overall response is the best time point response recor ded from the start of the 
treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as refer ence for progressive disease 
the smallest sum recorded since baseline).  The patient's best response assignment will 
depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria in some 
circumstances.

*If a CR is truly met at first time point, then any disease seen at a subsequent  time point, 
even disease meeting PR criteria  relative to baseline, makes th e disease PD at that point

claimed when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely  still present and in fact 
the patient had PR or SD, not CR at the first time point. Under  these circumstances, the

 In non-randomized trials where re sponse is part of the primary endpoint, confirmation of 
CR or PR is needed to deem either  one the “best overall response.”   Responses (CR and 
PR) require confirmation at grea ter than or equal to 4 weeks from initial documentation.  
 For this study, the minimum cr iteria for SD duration is 6 weeks . 
 Patients with a global deteriora tion of health status requiring  discontinuation of treatment 
or die without objective eviden ce of disease progression at tha t time should be reported to 
be off study treatment due to “symptomatic deterioration.”  Eve ry effort should be made 
to document the objective progressi on even after discontinuatio n of treatment. 
 
8.2 Response Assessment:  Immune-Related RECIST (10/22/2012)  
 
As previously noted, this study will assess tumor response with  an immune-related 
modification of RECIST 1.1 (see Table 8.2-1 below). 
Determination of response via ir RECIST should take into conside ration all target and 
non-target lesions.  
A key distinction between standa rd RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_151684] requires early evidence of progressive disease (i.e., a 
determination of irPD ≤ 12 weeks after starting study treatment) be confirmed by [CONTACT_7850], 
consecutive imaging ≥ 4 weeks afte r the initial documentation in the absence of rapid 
clinical deterioration. During this interim ≥ 4 week period, pa tients should continue to be 
followed per protocol, includi ng continued dosing of the study drug(s). 
Additionally, the immune-mediat ed responses expected from ADXS1 1-[ADDRESS_151685]  imaging assessment will be 
performed at Week 12, followed by [CONTACT_133951] 8 weeks ther eafter.

8.2.[ADDRESS_151688] diameters (SumD) of all tar get lesions (up to 2 lesions 
per organ, up to total 5 lesions) is measured. At each subseque nt tumor assessment (TA), 
the SumD of the target lesions  and of new, measurable lesions (≥ 10 mm [lymph nodes 
≥ [ADDRESS_151689] diameter];  up to 2 new lesions per organ, tot al 5 new lesions) are 
added together to provide the to tal measurable tumor burden (TM TB):

 Neither a 30% decrease in tumor burden compared with baseline nor a 20% increase compared with nadir can be established
 
PD At least 20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as 
reference the smallest sum on study. In 
addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression.

 response in target and new, measur able lesions is defined based on the change in TMTB 
(after ruling out irPD) as follows: 
Complete Response (irCR): Comple te disappearance of all target and new, measurable 
lesions, with the exceptions of l ymph nodes which must decrease  to < 10 mm in short 
axis Partial Response (irPR): Decreas e in TMTB ≥ 30% relative to bas eline (see below). 
Stable Disease (irSD): Not meeting criteria for irCR or irPR, i n absence of irPD. 
Progressive Disease (irPD): Increase in TMTB ≥ 20% relative to nadir. 
8.2.2 Response in Non-measurable Lesions 
At each TA, the presence of any ne w, non-measurable lesions is assessed. The presence 
of such lesions will rule out an overall response of irCR. An i ncrease in the size or 
number of new, non measurable les ions does not necessarily imply an overall response of 
irPD; if these lesions become m easurable (≥ 10 mm) at a subsequ ent TA, their 
measurement will at that point start to contribute to the TMTB.  
In addition, the response in non-ta rget lesions is defined as f ollows: 
Complete Response (irCR): Comple te disappearance of all non-target lesions 
Stable Disease (irSD): Non- target lesions are stable 
Progressive Disease (irPD): Une quivocal increases in number or size of non-target 
lesions. To achieve unequivocal  progression of n on-target lesio ns, there must be an 
overall level of substantial wo rsening of non-target disease that is of a magnitude that the 
treating physician would feel it is important to change therapy. 
NOTE:  Equivocal findings of progression of non-target lesions (e.g., small and uncertain 
new lesions; cystic changes or ne crosis in existing lesions) sh ould be considered irSD, 
and treatment may continue until  the next scheduled assessment.   
8.2.3 Evaluation of Biomarkers 
None. 
8.2.4 Overall Response 
The OR according to the irRC is derived from the responses in measurable lesions (based 
on TMTB) as well as the presence  of any non-measurable lesions as follows: 
Complete Response (irCR): Complete disappearance of all lesions  (whether measurable 
or not); lymph nodes must decrease to < [ADDRESS_151691] dimension. 
NCI Protocol #: GOG-0265 
Version Date: 05/20/2016

 Partial Response (irPR): Decreas e in TMTB ≥ to 30% relative to baseline. 
Stable Disease (irSD): Not meeting criteria for irCR or irPR, i n absence of irPD. 
Progressive Disease (irPD): Increase in TMTB ≥ 20% relative to nadir. 
The immune-related best overall r esponse (irBOR) is the best ir RC OR over the study as 
a whole, recorded between the date of first dose until the last  TA prior to subsequent 
therapy (including tumor resecti on surgery) for the individual patient in the study. As 
with the primary definitions of tumor response, early progressi on (i.e., irPD occurring 
prior to Week 12) will not preclude an irBOR of irCR, irPR or i rSD resulting from the

to the TMTB. To achieve unequivoc al progression of non-target lesions, there must 
be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target dise ase that is of a 
magnitude that the treating physi cian would feel it is importan t to change therapy. 
Equivocal findings of progression of non-target lesions (e.g., small and uncertain 
new lesions; cystic changes or necrosis in existing lesions) sh ould be considered 
irSD, and treatment may continue until the next schedule assessment. 
8.3 Duration of Response (10/22/2012) 
 
Duration of overall response:  The  duration of overall response  is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for irCR or irPR (whichever is fir st recorded) until the first

10.2 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING FOR AN INVESTIGATIONAL AGENT (5/23/2011) 
(03/09/2015) (06/27/2016) 
 
Timely and complete reporting of s afety information assists Adv axis in identifying any 
untoward medical occurrence, the reby [CONTACT_17155]:  (1) the protection of the safety of study 
subjects, (2) a greater understa nding of the overall safety pro file of ADXS11-001, (3) 
recognition of dose-related ADXS11 -001 toxicities, (4) appropri ate modification of study 
protocols, (5) improvements i n study design or p rocedures, and (6) adherence to 
worldwide regulatory requirements.   
 All Investigators have the prim ary responsibility for AE identi fication, documentation, 
grading, and assignment of attrib ution to the study treatment.  It is the responsibility of 
the Investigator to supply the m edical documentation needed to support expedited AE 
reports in a timely manner.  Adverse events (AEs) will be reported to FDA according to 21 CF R 312.32. 
  
 
10.2.1 Definition of Adverse Events (AE) 
 
Adverse event (AE):  any untowar d medical occurrence in a subje ct or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and  which does not 
necessarily have to have a causa l relationship with this treatm ent.  An AE can therefore 
be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the us e of a medicinal product 
or protocol-specified procedure , whether or not considered related to the medicinal 
product or protocol-specified procedure.  Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/ or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally 
associated with the use of st udy treatment (ADXS11-[ADDRESS_151696] bo) is also an AE. 
 AE(s) may also occur in screened subjects during any pre-allocation baseline period as a result of a protocol-specifie d intervention, including washout or discontinuation of usual 
therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure.  AEs may occur during the course of  the use of Advaxis’ product in clinical trials or 
within the follow-up period speci fied by [CONTACT_760], or presc ribed in clinical practice, 
from overdose (whether accidental or intentional), from abuse a nd from withdrawal. 
 All AEs will be recorded from the time the consent form is sign ed through 30 days 
following cessation of treatment during the study treatment per iod of the study.   
 Progression of the cancer under study is not considered an AE unless it results in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30059]. 
NCI Protocol #: GOG-0265 
Version Date: 05/20/2016  
- 69 - 
  If known, the diagnosis of the unde rlying illness or disorder s hould be recorded, rather 
than its individual symptoms.  The following information should  be captured for all AEs:  
onset and end dates, severity (grade of the event), Investigato r’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_133884]11-001 (see de finitions below), treatment/a ction required for the 
AE, and information regarding resolution/outcome.  Overdose:  any dose exceeding the prescribed dose by 100%.  No specific information is 
available on the treatment of  overdose of ADXS11-001.  In the e vent of an overdose, the 
subject should be observed close ly for signs of toxicity.  Appr opriate supportive 
treatment should be provided if clinically indicated.  If an AE (s) results from the 
overdose of ADXS11-001, the AE is  reported as a SAE(s), even if  no other seriousness 
criteria are met.  An overdose w ithout any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal 
laboratory results is reported as an AE. 
 AEs and other symptoms will be graded according to the expanded  NCI CTCAE v 4.0.  
All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of  the CTCAE version 4.0. 
A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 ca n be downloaded from the CTEP  web site 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov). The C TCAE v4.0 Manual is also availab le on the GOG member 
web site (http://www.gog.org under MANUALS).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluating Adverse Events 
 An Investigator who is a qualifie d physician will evaluate all AEs according to the NCI 
CTCAE v 4.0.  Any AE that changes CT CAE grade over the course of a given epi[INVESTIGATOR_133885] r ecorded on the CTEP-AERS report . 
 When possible, AEs should be described in terms of a change in the baseline status or 
with a diagnosis or summary term rather than as individual symp toms. 
 Criteria for Determining AE Severity:  The descriptions and gra ding scales found in the 
revised NCI CTCAE v 4.0 will be u tilized for AE reporting. 
 Criteria for Determining AE Causality:  The following attributi on categories must be 
used in assessing the relationship between the AE and the study  treatment: If the 
Investigator does not know whether or not the investigational a gent caused the event, 
then the event will be handled as “related to investigational a gent”.

 [IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Abnormal Test Findings  
The criteria for determining whe ther an abnormal test finding should be reported as an 
AE are as follows:  
 Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms; and/or 
 Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/s urgical intervention: 
and/or 
 Test result leads to a change i n study dosing or discontinuatio n from the study, 
significant additional concomitant drug treatments, or other; a nd or 
 Test result is considered to be an AE by [CONTACT_133952] t est, in the absence of any of the above conditions does not 
constitute an AE.  An abnormal test result that is determined t o be an error does not 
require reporting as an AE. 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Cytokine Release Syndrome  
As per NCI CTCAE v 4.03, CRS is de fined as a disorder character ized by [CONTACT_33234], 
headache, tachycardia, hypotension, rash, and shortness of brea th.  Subjects must have 
experienced ALL symptoms for an AE to be documented as CRS.  In dividual symptoms 
associated with CRS should not be reported as CRS, but should b e reported as separate 
AEs. 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Follow-Up  
AEs and SAEs related to ADXS11-001 (definitely, probably or possibly) should be followed to resolution or stabi lization and reported as SAEs if  they become serious.  This 
also applies to subjects experien cing AEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of 
ADXS11-001 or those experiencing AE s that are present at the end of their participation 
in the study; such subjects should receive post treatment follo w-up as appropriate.  If an 
ongoing AE changes in its severity or in its perceived relation ship to ADXS11-001, an 
amendment to the CTEP-AERS report  should be submitted. 
 10.2.2 Reporting Expedited Adverse Events  
 
Depending on the phase of the study , use of investigational age nts, and role of the 
pharmaceutical sponsor, an expedited AE report may need to reac h multiple destinations.  
For patients participating on a GOG trial, all expedited AE rep orts should be submitted 
by [CONTACT_133953] (AERS).  All reports are reviewed 
by [CONTACT_133954]-AERS. Submitting a repor t through CTEP-
AERS serves as notification to GOG, and satisfies the GOG requi rements for expedited 
AE reporting.  All adverse reactions will be immediately direct ed to the Study Chair for

 further review.   Additionally, all CTEP-AERS reports for this study will be sent  to 
the GOG Phase I Committee Chair and the GOG Safety Review Commi ttee Chair.  
 
The requirement for timely repor ting of adverse events to the s tudy sponsor is specified 
in the Statement of Investigator, Form FDA-1572.  In signing th e FDA-1572, the 
investigator assumes the responsibility for reporting AEs to th e study sponsor.  In

the study agent, ADXS11-001, in pa tients with recurrent or pers istent cervical cancer.  
The primary measure of efficac y will be overall survival at 12 months. 
 We note here that the change in t reatment regimen from stage 1 (three cycles of 
treatment) to stage 2 (unlimited cyc les) complicates the interp retation of the trial. Under 
the reasonable but not certain a ssumption that extended treatment (i.e., >3 doses) is more 
effective than 3 doses: at the e nd of the study, if we reject the null hypothesis of 
inactivity, then we can conclude that the extended regimen is effective. (03/09/2015)   
 11.1 This is a single-arm, two-stage Phase II study, and no randomization is involved; 
however, patient registration will be accomplished in the usual  fashion. For patients in

 introduce bias into the assessment of the efficacy of the study treatment.  Therefore, all patients enrolled in stage 2 prior to the clinical hold will be excluded from efficacy 
analyses and will be replaced.  A ll treated patients will be in cluded in all safety analyses.

Thirty-seven patients were orig inally planned for Stage 2. As described above in Section

replaced. Therefore, a two-stage total of 90 patients will be t argeted (including [ADDRESS_151721] stage [26 treated], 25 in Stage 2 [all to  be replaced], and [ADDRESS_151722] accrual of 37 patients to complete i n approximately twelve

study (1x10
9 cfu). No DLT has occurred in these patients or in the [ADDRESS_151725] of the study’s patients. 
 We denote by θ the probability of a DLT at the 1x10
9 cfu dose.  In the traditional 3+3 
phase I design used in the dose escalation phase, the implicit (but not technically correct) 
goal of the MTD estimation pro cess is to obtain a dose that has  a probability of a DLT 
less than 0.33.  We focus our c onsideration on the probability that θ [i.e., Pr(DLT) at the 
1x109 cfu dose], is higher than a target of 0.33. 
As proposed by Gönen71, we utilize a Bayesian interpretation of θ, in which θ  is 
considered to be a random variab le with a probability distribut ion.  We combine the data 
observed in our trial with a prio r probability distribution for θ  to obtain a posterior 
distribution for θ.  The DLT data is binomially dist ributed (DLT yes/no).  The co njugate 
prior for the binomial distribu tion is the beta distribution, s o we assume the prior for θ, 
p(θ), to be Beta( α, β).  We denote the number of DLT-ev aluable patients treated at the 
1x109 cfu in the dose safety lead-in to be NS, and of these we denote the number with 
DLTs to be X S.  The posterior for θ  at the end of the safety lead-in is thus p(θ|X1), is thus 
Beta(α+X S, β+ N S − XS). (10/22/2012)

Version Date: 05/20/[ADDRESS_151726] from the Phase I trial 
(0 DLTs out of 5 patients treated).  We use a Beta(α, β ) with α=2 and β =6, which is the 
prior curve in Figure 11.1.  This reflects the belief that the pr(DLT) for the 1x109 cfu 
dose is most likely around 0.[ADDRESS_151727] observed.  These are shown in Table 11.3.  For  example, if we observe 
0/6 patients with DLTs safety l ead-in, there is 0.04 probabilit y that θ exceeds a target of 
0.33; whereas, if we see 3/[ADDRESS_151728] DLTs, the probability that θ exceeds our target of 0.33 is 0.57.

Phase II End point and design selection 
Survival at 12 months is the  primary endpoint of the study for the reasons described 
above in section 2.6. 
 The guiding principle in selec ting the design f or this study is  to limit the number of 
patients treated with clinically ineffective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; yet to estimate efficacy with 
reasonable precision for those agen ts that are c linically activ e.  However, the accrual is 
complicated by [CONTACT_133957] a multi-center phase I I study. When the targeted 
sample size is attained, those  patients who have already been a pproached will be 
permitted to register.  Strict adherence to a two-stage samplin g design with ‘optimal’ 
early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_133888].  Instead, flexible stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_133889]. 
 
Historical Data and Design Parameters  
The design parameters for this study arise from considering the results from the GOG 
[ADDRESS_151729] studies (shown in Table 11.2) to predict th e probability of a patient 
surviving at least 12 months.  The following terms were examined to determine if they were significantly relat ed to 12-month survival:  
• age (linear and quadratic terms) • cell type (squamous vs. other [ unspecified adenocarcinoma, mu cinous 
adenocarcinoma, adenosquamous]) 
• performance status (0 vs. 1 vs. 2 or 3) • number of prior chemoth erapy regimens (0 or 1 vs. 2) 
• prior radiotherapy • extra-pelvic disease 
NCI Protocol #: GOG-0265 
Version Date: 05/20/2016  
- 80 - 
 • grade • race (black, white, other) • stage. A backward elimination procedure was used, with p≤0.20 required for terms to remain in 
the model.  This resulted in the selection of age, age
2, performance status, and race for the 
predictive model.  The same vari ables were selected when stepwi se selection was used, 
with p<0.20 required for entry and to r emain in the model.  Models we re also built 
excluding variables (stage, grade , number of prior chemotherapy  regimens, and extra-
pelvic disease) for which some patients had missing values; var iable selected based on 
these models also matched the above. (10/22/2012) 
 Between-trial variability was assessed using two methods.  First, as proposed by [CONTACT_133958]
72, we compared the proportion of pa tients survivi ng at 12 months  in each protocol ( ri 
based on ni patients in protocol i, i=1, …, k ; k=17 protocols) with the overall proportion 
surviving at 12 months ( r based on n  patients).  If ri was outside the following interval, it 
was considered different fro m the overall event rate: 
10 . 0 2 5 / (1 )i
k
innrz r rnn 
None of the trials had rates th at differed significantly from t he overall event rate. 
 The second method to assess betwee n-trial variability was to bu ild a proportional hazards 
model with protocol section, and then to add the variables that  were predictive to 
determine if they removed the s ignificance of protocol section.   With the first model, 
protocol section had a statistically significant effect: p=0.0764 (based on 16 degrees of 
freedom).  When age, age
2, performance status, and race were included in the model, 
protocol section was no longer significant: p=0.7662. (10/22/2012) 
 The predictive model is show n in Table 11.3.  We will use this model to compute the 
expected (null) proportion of patie nts surviving [ADDRESS_151730] .  The model’s predicted probabilities of survival are 
presented graphically by [CONTACT_545], performance status, and age in F igure 11.2.

 Figure 11.2: Predicted Survival at 12 Months by [CONTACT_31365], Race, and Performance Status 
 
For sample size calculation, we assume the expected null propor tion of patients surviving 
12 months (denoted by ) to be the overall percentage acr oss all trials (of inactive a gents) 
in the 127 and 227 queues: 21% ≈ 20%.  We size the study to hav e 90% power to detect a 
15% increase in 12-month surviva l (to 35%) at a one-sided significance level of 0.10.  
We utilize a two-stage design, and we use the optimal sample si ze as proposed by 
[CONTACT_52254]73 to set the targeted sample size for each stage: n1=27 (including 6 patients from 
safety lead-in), and n2=36 ( n=63).  However, the actual method of Simon is not 
applicable here because of t he dynamic nature of the null propo rtion of patients surviving 
12 months (i.e., the null value for the proportion of patients surviving 12 months depends 
on the observed patient characte ristics).  The design is inherently flexible in that while we 
target these sample sizes, the actual attained sample sizes wil l be utilized in the analyses 
of stage 1 and overall. (5/23/2011) (10/22/2012) 
 A conditional power approach wil l be utilized to determine if t he second stage of accrual 
should be undertaken.  Conditional on the results from the firs t stage, the power to detect 
a statistically significant resu lt at the end of the trial (after stage 2) will be  calculated.  For 
this calculation, the 12-month survival probabili ty in the seco nd stage ( p
2) will be based 
on the estimated probability from the first stage ( ): 
 
This “simple optimistic but plausi ble alternative” was proposed  by [CONTACT_133959]74  
and is shown to yield reasonable  operating characteristics belo w. (10/22/2012)

and reason for study suspension.   Under these circumstances, a ccrual cannot be re-
activated until the study is reviewed by [CONTACT_133965] (SRC). 
However, patients currently receiving treatment may continue to  receive treatment in 
accordance protocol guidelines at the discretion of their physi cians, unless directed 
otherwise. (02/06/2012) 
 In addition to the safety run-i n of six patients to assess safe ty and in addition to the 
routine monitoring of safety desc ribed above this section, an additional assessment of 
safety and tolerability will done  at the end of the first stage  of accrual.  At that point, we

protocol series 0127 and 0227) assu ming 63 total patients are a ccrued. There are no data 
that support differences in the i ntervention effects between ra cial/ethnic subgroups; 
therefore, the study design does not involve race. However, subsets defined by [CONTACT_133967]-white will be analyzed in this study to investigate this im portant question with the 
current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The trial is registered at clinicaltrials.go v, and all patients who meet 
eligibility criteria are invited to participate.

(12/23/2013 ) 
 
Obtaining a GOG Bank ID for Translational Research Specimens (1 0/22/2012) 
 
Only one GOG Bank ID (# # # # - # # - G # # #) is assigned per patient. All translational research 
specimens and accompanying paperwor k must be labeled with this coded patient number. A 
GOG Bank ID can be obtained online via the Tissue Bank Portal o n the GOG website (under 
Tools on the Web Menu page).  
 Obtain the GOG patient study ID fo r all GOG protocols with tran slational research specimen 
requirements before requesting a Bank ID from the Tissue Bank P ortal. Be sure to indicate if 
the patient has a previous GOG # when registering.  This will ensure that the patient is only 
assigned one Bank ID. The GOG ID – Bank ID Lookup on the Tissue Bank Portal can be used to search for an existing Bank ID. (02/06/2012)  Please contact [CONTACT_133972] a patient (Email: [EMAIL_2784]; Phone: 716-845-77 67). 
 
III. Requesting Specimen Kits 
 
One single-chamber specimen kit will be provided per patient fo r the collection and shipment of 
serum for each time point (Dose 1, Dose 2, and Dose 3). (12/23/2013) 
 Translational research speci men kits can be ordered online via the Kit Management link on the 
GOG website (under Data Entry on t he Web Menu page). Each site may order a maximum of 
two specimen kits per protocol  per day (daily max = 6 kits). 
 Please contact [CONTACT_133973] (Emai l: 
[EMAIL_2785] ; Phone: 866-GOG-BANC/[PHONE_3034]). 
  Be sure to plan ahead and allow time for kits to be shipped by [CONTACT_133974].  Note: Unused materials and kits  should be returned to the GOG Tissue Bank. 
 
IV.  Labeling Translational Research Specimens 
 
A waterproof permanent marker  or printed label should be used t o label each translational 
research specimen with:  GOG Bank ID (# # # # - # # - G # # #) GOG protocol number (GOG- # # # #) 
NCI Protocol #: GOG-0265 
Version Date: 05/20/2016  
- 93 - 
 specimen code (see section I) 
collection date (mm/dd/yyyy) surgical pathology accession number (tissue specimens only) block number (tissue specimens only)  Note: If labeling slides, onl y label on the top, front portion of the slide. Do not place a label on 
the back of the slide or over th e tissue. The label must fit on  the slide and should not be wrapped 
around the slide or hang over the edge. 
 
V. Submitting Archival Formalin-Fixed, Paraffin-Embedded Tumor (10/22/2012) 
(12/23/2013) 
 
Formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue should be the m ost representative of the 
specimen type (primary, metastatic, recurrent). Primary and met astatic tumor should be collected 
prior to all treatment. Recurre nt tumor should be collected pri or to the study treatment. Only one 
block may be submitted per tissue type. 
 Every attempt should be made to provide a tumor block; however,  if a block cannot be provided 
on a permanent basis, then 15 unstained sections (charged, 5µm)  should be submitted. All tissue 
sections should be cut sequen tially from the same block. 
 The type of specimen (block or s lides) should be specified on F orm SP. 
 If submitting recurrent tumor, include a comment on Form SP not ing whether the tumor is from 
the primary site or a metastatic site.  All FFPE tissue should be submitted with the corresponding path ology report. 
 
VI. Submitting Serum Specimens 
 
1. Label cryovials and a 15mL conical  tube as described above. Use  2mL cryovials if serum 
will be shipped to the GOG Tissue Bank. 
 
2. Draw 7-10mL of blood into red top tube(s).

- 113 - APPENDIX IX - GOG GENERAL CHEMOTHERAPY GUIDELINES  ( 06/27/2016 ) 
 
 For [ADDRESS_151763] a new cycle of chemotherapy 
delayed up to 7 days (without thi s being considered to be a pro tocol violation) for major 
life events (e.g., serious illness in a family member, major ho liday, vacation which is 
unable to be re-scheduled).  D ocumentation to justify this deci sion should be provided. 
 It will be acceptable for indi vidual chemotherapy doses to be delivered within a “24-hour 
window before and after the protoc ol-defined date” for “Day 1” treatment of 21 or 28 day 
cycles.  If the treatment due date  is a Friday, and the patient cannot be treated on that 
Friday, then the window for treat ment would include the Thursday (1 day earlier than 
due) through the Monday (day [ADDRESS_151764] due). 
 For weekly regimens, it will be a cceptable for individual chemo therapy doses to be 
delivered within a “24-hour window ,” for example; “Day 8 chemotherapy” can be 
delivered on Day 7, Day 8, or Day 9 and “Day 15 chemotherapy” c an be given on Day 
14, Day 15, or Day 16. 
 Chemotherapy doses can be “rounded” according to institutional standards without being 
considered a protocol violation ( most institutions use a rule o f approximately +/- 5% of 
the calculated dose). 
 Chemotherapy doses are required t o be recalculated if the patie nt has a weight change of 
greater than or equal to 10%.  Patients are permitted to have chemotherapy doses recalculated for < 10% weight changes.

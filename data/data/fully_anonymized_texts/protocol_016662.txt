4.0 BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
 
4.1 Background  
 
4.1.1 The clinical problem of sepsis  
 Sepsis , a complex syndrome characterized by [CONTACT_593645] , affects over 1 million Americans annually  and is associated with substantial health care costs , 
in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_593618] 20 -30%,  and significant long -term functional and neurocognitive deficits in 
survivors .1-[ADDRESS_783250] been successfully developed (ex- anti-IL-1 therapy, activated 
protein C) .6,[ADDRESS_783251] spectrum antibiotics and resuscitative intravenous fluids. Sepsis 
management guidelines focus primarily on reducing delay to these life -saving therapi[INVESTIGATOR_593619] .8-10  
  
4.1.2 Hyperglycemia and inflammation in sepsis  
Approximately 40%  of patien ts in the intensive care unit develop hyperglycemia, and , of those , 
one third do not have pre -existing diabetes.11 The development of hyperglycemia in previously non-
diabetic patients with sepsis  (referred to as stress hyperglycemia)  is associated with in creased organ 
dysfunction and mortality.12-16 Stress hyperglycemia shares many characteristics with diabetes mellitus 
type 2: disrupted glucose homeostasis, impa ired insulin sensitivity, inflammation, and counter -regulatory 
hormone imbalance. Once hyperglycemia develops, it further increases production of pro -inflammatory 
cytokines, suppresses neutrophil activity, and increases leukocyte adhesion and migration.20-22 While 
Page | 8                                                                              Protocol Version 3.1    01/24/[ADDRESS_783252] highlighted 
potential harm with the early initiati on of parenteral nutrition in critically ill patients , and, as such,  current 
guidelines favor the provision of nutrition support via enteral route . The optimal timing and dose of 
enteral nutritional support  during sepsis remains uncertain .26,27  Current guidelines state28: 
 
•  “nutrition support therapy in the form of early enteral nutrition should be initiated within 24 –
48 hours in the critically ill patient ” (Quality of Evidence: Very Low)  
•  “in the setting of hemodynamic compromise or instability, EN should be withheld until the 
patient is fully resuscitated and/or stable. Initiation/re -initiation of EN may be considered with 
caution in patients undergoing withdrawal of vasopressor support. ” (Expert consensus)  
 
Nutrition is provided to septic patients with the goals of preserv ing lean body mass , preventing 
malnutrition, and facilitating recovery. Providing nutrition via enteral route is also believed to maintain 
the integrity of intestinal epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], prevent bacterial translocation, and even potentially modulate 
inflammatory responses.28-31 Important ly the benefits of enteral nutrition are  noted at low (so-called 
“trophic” ) levels of support.[ADDRESS_783253] 48 hours  perhaps  due the expert consensus 
recommendation to avoid enteral nutrition during periods of hemodynamic compromise. The SCCM 
guidelines base this recommendation in part on the theoretical risk of bowel ischemia , but this is a rare 
clinical condition that occurs in less than 1% of patients  receiving enteral nutrition .33 Furthermore , a 
retrospective prope nsity score based analysis of critically ill patients demonstrated that patients with 
hemodynamic instability requiring vasopressors not only tolerated enteral support but had a reduction in 
mortality compared to similar patients who did not receive entera l support.34 The potential benefit of 
enteral nutrition in this retrospective study of critically ill patients highlights the need for further 
prospective clinical  trials to better characterize the effects of early enteral support with a focus on 
understanding underlying  physiology and mechanisms of disease .

that low level enteral dextrose 
provision (~10% daily caloric 
requirements) early in the course of 
sepsis  attenuate s the systemic 
inflammatory response  and 
improves glucose disposal in mice . 
In our first set of 
experiments , we used intravascular 
endotoxin (LPS), a component of 
the cell wall of gram negative bacteria, administered to  10 week old C57BL/6J male mice to test the effects 
of intravenous (IV, parentera l) and intragastric (enteral)  dextrose in the acute phase of sepsis.  
Infusion of a low level of IV dextrose in endotoxemic mice significantly impaired glucose tolerance  
compared to  either IV dextrose or LPS alone. Enteral dextrose infusion at an equivalen t level of support, 
however, increase d insulin secretion and preserved  glucose disposal  in endotoxemic mice . Furthermore, 
infusion of early enteral dextrose in endotoxemic mice was associated with improvement in mean arterial 
blood pressure and attenuated the systemic inflammatory response, evidenced by [CONTACT_593646]-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 by 35-50% (Figure 1) compared to endotoxemic mice receiving saline 
infusion or intravenous ( IV) dextrose .  Similar trends were noted for the pro -inflammat ory cytokines IL-1β 
and TNF-α. Thus, early enteral dextrose infusion in endotoxemic mice had beneficial effects on the 
systemic inflammatory response as well as glucose metabolism.  
In a second set of 
experiments , we examined the 
effects of IV and enteral dextrose in 
a pneumonia model of sepsis. Mice 
were infected with Klebsiella 
pneumonia e and 24 hours after 
septic insult were randomized to 
receive (1) IV dextrose, (2) enteral 
dextrose, or (3) enteral saline. 
Infusion of IV dextrose in septic 
mice was associated with 
hyperglycemia and decreased 
survival . Mice receiving IV dextrose 
exhibited 100% mortality at 36 hr  
whereas 25% of septic mice 
receiving enteral saline survived to  
[ADDRESS_783255], in fusion of 
enteral dextrose increased survival 
to ~70% at 72 hours (Figu re 2) . Mice 
receiving enteral dextrose also

dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) protease, are FDA approved and widely used for the treatment of type [ADDRESS_783259] in the 
development and evolution of sepsis.51,52 The advent of culture -independent techniques for the study of 
microbes with next -generation sequencing  has revealed that humans harbor in their gastrointestinal 
tracts up to ~ [ADDRESS_783260] invasive pathogens.54 
Dysbiosis or disruption of a “healthy” gut microbiome is associated with a loss of commensal microbiota 
resulting in increased susceptibility to pathogen s and dysregulated immune responses.55  
Page | 11                                                                              Protocol Version 3.1    01/24/201 9 
    
 The gut microbiome in sepsis is severely disturbed  by [CONTACT_593649] (e.g. gut hypop erfusion, endogenous catecholamines, systemic hyperglycemia etc.) but also from 
critical care interventions, including systemic antibiotics, gastric acid suppression , and nutrition delivery 
interruptions.51,52 The dysbiotic gut microbiome is now considered a central orchestrator in sepsis ( gut-
origin sepsis ), bot h in triggering pathogen invasion ( microbial translocation ) and in mediating distal end -
organ damage by [CONTACT_593650] ( gut-lymph hypothesis ).56,[ADDRESS_783261] measurable effects in the colonic microbiota. However , little is known about the 
composition and evolution of gastric /proximal intestinal  microbiome  in sepsis , and gastric acid 
suppression and dysmotility from sedatives  are well known to promote bacterial growth in critically -ill 
patients .[ADDRESS_783262] (oral swabs , tracheal aspi[INVESTIGATOR_593621]) to assess for a potential impact of enteral dextrose on host microbial communities. We 
will also examine stool samples or rectal swabs as proxies for the assessment of the colonic microbiome

infusion and a placebo control arm in which participants will receive an enteral free water  infusion . The 
primary outcome of this study is the extent of systemic inflammation as determined by [CONTACT_593651]-inflammatory cytokines IL -6 measured at the end of the int ervention . Secondary outcomes 
include measures of glycemic control by [CONTACT_7092][INVESTIGATOR_30135] ; measures of insulin, C -peptide, and the 
incretin hormones glucose -dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) and glucagon -like peptide -1 (GLP -1); 
measures of other p ro-inflammatory cytokines including IL -1β and TNF -α; determination of the 
composition and function of the aerodigestive  tract and colonic microbiome ; and clinical measures 
(including incidence of emesis, ICU length of stay, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577], mortali ty).  
5.1 General characteristics  
 
We will include patients 18 years or older diagnosed with sepsis at the time of admission to an 
intensive care unit (ICU) at UPMC Presby[CONTACT_194840] , UPMC Montefiore , UPMC Shadyside, or UPMC 
McKeesport  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] . Etiology of se psis can include any organ system (e.g. pneumonia, urinary tract 
infection, severe soft tissue infection , etc.) as long as the type of infection does not preclude use of the 
gastrointestinal tract for nutrition and medication administration (e.g. peritonit is).  
5.1.1 Inclusion criteria  
1. Adults age d 18 years and older  admitted to an ICU at UPMC Presby[CONTACT_194840] , UPMC 
Montefiore , UPMC Shadyside, or UPMC McKeesport . 
2. New presentation of sepsis characterized by a confirmed or suspected infection, with an 
acute increa se from baseline in a modified  Sepsis -Related  Organ Failure Assessment 
(SOFA)  score of greater than or equal to 2  points  (Appendix 11.1) . If baseline values are 
unknown, baseline SOFA score of 0 will be assumed.  
3. Available enteral access defined by: (1) an existing nasogastric  or orogastric tube, (2) 
plans to place a nasogastric or orogastric  tube, or (3) an existing percutaneous 
endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube.   
4. Less than [ADDRESS_783265] with recruitment to be performed in the ICUs  of UPMC Presby[CONTACT_194840] , 
UPMC Montefiore , UPMC Shady side, and UPMC McKeesport  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] .  
Page | 13                                                                              Protocol Version 3.1    01/24/201 9 
    
 5.2.1  Initial screening (pre -consent):   
The principal investigator s will introduce the study to ICU physicians in the In -Service Session 
before the start of the study and in ongoing staff meetings, grand rounds, and i n any other ICU meetings. 
The study procedures, eligibility criteria, and study window will be explained. With this knowledge, the 
clinicians in the ICU will be able to assist in identify ing potential subjects and communicate this to the 
study team for pos sible enrollment.  
Screening evaluations to determine eligibility will be conducted daily by [CONTACT_593652] a diagnosis of 
sepsis/septic shock. Initial assessment will re ly on review of admitting diagnoses as recorded by [CONTACT_512883], admitting medical documentation, and lab and imaging results to assess possible sources of 
infection , presence or absence of organ dysfunction , and use of invasive mechanical ventilati on. Initial 
screen for inclusion/exclusion will based on chart review. For those individuals meeting criteria for 
enrollment, the subject or his/her  legally authorized representative (LAR) will be contact[CONTACT_426] a member 
of the clinical ICU team and offered the opportunity to participate in the clinical trial. This will avoid “cold 
calling” coercion that could occur if direct contact [CONTACT_593653].  If that agreement is obtained, a member of the research team will 
preliminarily introduce the study to the subject or LAR.  At that time, a member of the study team will 
review other inclusion and exclusion criteria with the LAR to assess  eligibility.   
 
5.2.2 Consent ing process :  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a design ated physician co-investigator will follow -up the preliminary discussion to 
answer any additional questions and obtain written authorization and consent for participation from 
subjects or their LAR. The investigator or a co -investigator will discuss the na ture of the research study 
and study procedures with the participant or LAR inclusive of the risks and potential benefits of study 
participation. In cases where the LAR is not present in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], the study will be discussed over the 
telephone. If the LAR agrees, the consent form (ICF) will be e -mailed or faxed to the number provided by 
[CONTACT_55639]. No research activities can start before the signed document is received from the LAR. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_593622], date, and time the consent form 
when it is received (date/time of receipt, not the date of discussion).  
Pennsylvania law defines no specific surrogate decision maker for health care. However, if consent 
is obtained from a surrogate decision maker, the basis for establishing his/her identity should be one of 
the following: Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care, next of kin, or following lines of sanguinity in 
order of relationship (i.e., court appointed guardian, spouse, natural or adoptive paren t, adult child, adult 
sibling, any other available adult relative related through blood or marriage known and documented to 
have made decisions for the subject in prior health care settings).  
Rights as a research subject will be explained and ample time fo r the participant or LAR to review 
the consent document prior to obtaining written signature [CONTACT_593668]. After this 
detailed discussion of the study and conclusion of any questions, the study investigator and/or co -
investigator will obtain informed consent with documentation of the consenting process, prior to 
beginning any research activities. All participants and LARs will be informed of their right to withdraw the 
patients from study participation at any time. Additionally, enrolle d patients will have the right to 
withdraw from the study once decision -making capacity is regained if the patients recover quickly from 
their acute illness (e.g. with early liberation from the ventilator while the patient is still in the study).  
After co nsent, the pre -entry procedures include those listed in Section 5.4.[ADDRESS_783266] be completed within 12 hours  prior to study entry.  
 
5.2.3 Baseline evaluation and randomization:   
Page | 14                                                                              Protocol Version 3.1    01/24/201 9 
    
 If pre -entry evaluation is acceptable, the participant will  be enrolled in the study and undergo 
baseline testing include d in Section 5.4.3 . At that point, the participants will be randomized to 
interventional and  placebo  control arms . Enrollment into interventional and placebo arms will be 
stratified at one level  by [CONTACT_593654] -existing self -reported diabetes mellitus utilizing 
separate randomization tables. The University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_593623] 
(UPMC -IDS) will be responsible for randomization, blinding, and pr ovid ing the study infusion  at the  
bedside  to the clinical team .  
 
5.2.4 Blinding:  
The UPMC -IDS will dispense investigational infusions that conceal infusion contents with an 
opaque cover , thus t he treating ICU clinicians , nursing staff , and study investig ators  will be blinded to 
group allocation. Group allocation will remain concealed until blinding is broken after final data analysis 
is completed .  
 
5.3 Study treatment  
 
5.3.1 Treatment arms  
At study entry,  the participant  will be randomized into an interv entional arm that will receive an 
enteral dextrose infusion or a control arm that will receive enteral free water placebo .  
 
1a: Enteral dextrose infusion: A standard solution of 50% Dextrose (0.85 kcal/mL) will be initiated 
within [ADDRESS_783267] an expected daily caloric requirement of 2000 kcal per day, enteral 
dextrose infusion would deliver approximately 20% of the daily caloric need . As a referenc e, the 
enteral tube formulation Jevity 1.2 provides 1.2 kcal/mL  and is often infused at 10 mL per hour 
upon initiation  of enteral tube feeding. T hus the volume and level of delivered calories  in the 
study group will be similar to the amount delivered in lo w level enteral tube feed formulations.  
 
1b. Placebo control : Patients in the placebo control arm will receive enteral free water at a rate 
of 10 mL per hour following randomization to control for the effects of an enteral infusion . 
Although these particip ants will not receive any enteral calories, a  retrospective review of 
critically ill patients admitted to the Acute Lung Injury Registry a t the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_593624] 
a patient population similar to the patients we will enroll to this study revealed  that (1) less than 
10% of patients receive any enteral infusions in the first 48 hours of ICU admission, (2) greater 
than 50% of calories are delivered in intravenous infusions rather than the enteral route, and (3) 
total level of caloric support in the a bsence of enteral feeding is approximately 10 -15% of daily 
caloric needs.

monitoring may be utilized as part of the care dictated by [CONTACT_593658].  
 
6.3.2 Research blood draws  
Blood will be drawn for plasma and serum  at two time point s (a) at the time of randomization and 
(b) after the completion  of the intervention  period . Approximately 10 mL of blood will be drawn each time 
either by [CONTACT_593659] ( central venous lines or 
arterial  lines) by [CONTACT_102]’s bedside nurse. Blood will be drawn into several tubes including serum, EDTA, 
and BD P [ADDRESS_783271] samples will be collected as follows  at baseline, at the end of the 
infusion period, and at day 7 :  
 
Oral swabs: A swab will be gently rubbed on the tongue dorsum, the hard palate, the buccal 
mucosa, and the gingiva. Specimens will be secured in a sterile tube and stored in a locked freezer 
until bacterial nucleic acid  extraction procedures.  The procedure will be performed twice in order 
to obtain samples for both bacterial DNA and RNA extractions.

 Tracheal aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026]:  Five to 10 ml of tracheal aspi[INVESTIGATOR_593629] a sterile catheter 
during endotracheal tu be suctioning if the patient remains on mechanical ventilation for the study 
period. Samples are collected according to standardized protocols by [CONTACT_593660][INVESTIGATOR_335613]. Such samples are typi[INVESTIGATOR_593630], but are  usually 
discarded. Samples will be transported immediately in wet ice. Sample aliquots are stored at -
80oC in a locked freezer until bacterial nucleic  extraction procedures.  
 
Gastric aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026]:  Ten to [ADDRESS_783272] and the patient remains in the ICU.  
 
Stool samples:  If stool is available, a portion of the sample will be taken and stored in a sterile 
specimen cup, as above.  
 
Rectal swabs:  A swab will be gently advanced through the anal sphincter in the anal vault and 
gently rubbed on the rectal mucosa. Specimens will be secured in a sterile tube and stored at -
80oC in a locked freezer until bacterial nucleic a cid extraction procedures. The procedure will be 
performed twice in order to obtain samples for both bacterial DNA and RNA extractions.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_783273] ome (HHS)  
The development of either diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome during 
the intervention period of this study will prompt cessation of enteral infusion to allow for the strict control 
of caloric delivery required in the trea tment of these syndromes.  
 
7.1.3 Ischemic bowel  
 Ischemic bowel is a rare and potentially serious complication associated with enteral feeding 
occurring in less than 1% of patients.33 Ischemic bowel presents with intolerance to enteral feedings 
manifested by [CONTACT_9551], abdominal pain, or bloating and is characterized by [CONTACT_593661] | 19                                                                              Protocol Version 3.1    01/24/[ADDRESS_783274] a greater likelihood of being study related, study endpoints ( including 
level of glycemic control, incidence of emesis, incidence of hypotension ) and certain pre -specified 
expected events for critically ill septic patients (see Append ix 11.3) will not be reported as serious adverse 
events  if they occur during the 24-hour  intervention period . Reportable s erious adverse events (defined 
as fatal or immediately life -threatening or those that are permanently disabling) that are unexpected a nd 
are suspected to be related to study interventions will be disclosed within [ADDRESS_783275] of adverse events in the usual care and 
intervention arms wil l be made available to the DSMB . 
 
7.4 Indications for study discontinuation  
  
The following indications will be criteria for study discontinuation:  
• Request by  [CONTACT_3445] . 
• Serious adverse event related to intervention . 
• Medical need to hold further enteral infusions including impending intra -abdominal surgery.  
• Clinical evaluation by [CONTACT_593662] 500 mg/dL, severe ileus, or development 
of severe abdominal pain or emesis related to study intervention . 
• Discretion of the investigator . 
• Decision by [CONTACT_593663].  
 
7.5 Protocol adherence  
Participants in both the placebo and intervention group will be assessed to determine the (1) the 
number of interruptions in enteral study infusion and (2) total amount of time that enteral study infusion 
was successfully admi nistered during the 24 hour intervention period.  
 
7.6 Clinical nutrition management  
The clinical ICU team will be encouraged by [CONTACT_593664] -
containing intravenous infusions and enteral tube feed formulations during the  24 hour intervention 
period. Study infusions will not be given concomitantly with enteral tube feeds. If enteral tube feeds are 
started during the intervention period, the study infusion will be stopped and the total time the study 
infusion was delivered will be recorded. Research specimens will still be collected for these participants. 
After the 24 hour intervention period, further nutrition support (if any) will be at the discretion of the 
clinical ICU team .

 7.7 Data Safety and Monitoring Plan (DSMP)  
The data safety and monitoring plan for this research study will be conducted by a local Data 
Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB)  that will be created to review this study . The individuals to be chosen 
for the DSMB will be free from financial and academic con flicts, will not include study investigators, and 
will have the expertise  required  to understand and identify any issues that would arise with the conduct 
of a clinical trial in critically ill patients.  
The DSMB will meet every six months to review: (1) tr ial performance with a focus on recruitment, 
(2) protocol adherence, (3) completeness of data ma nagement, and (4) trial safety.  
 Furthermore, m onthly meetings for the monitoring of individual case review will be conducted by 
[CONTACT_079] s and research team with review of the  following items:  recruitment, enrollment, 
retention, all adverse events, unanticipated problems, withdrawals and any breaches of confidentiality. A 
regular review of accrued data will be done to ensure data integrity and v alidity and to ensure that there 
is no change in the risk to benefit ratio of the study. Any serious or unexpected adverse events, 
unexpected problems that involve risk to the participants or others, or breaches of confidentiality will be 
reported to the I nstitute Review Board (IRB) in compliance with IRB Policies and Procedures. Reporting to 
the NIH will be the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_44200].  
All Serious Adverse Event reporting to the IRB will occur within 24 hours of no tification to the 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_593631]’s stated policy for reporting adverse events. If an unexpected adverse event occurs, the 
investigators will re -assess the ris k/benefit ratio of the study and submit any modifications deemed 
necessary to the IRB for approval. At the time of the IRB renewal the PI [INVESTIGATOR_593632], the dates that the monthly meetings took  place, a ny

Title of Study:  
A Multicenter, Placebo -Controlled, Double-Blind, Randomized, Parallel-Group, Phase 2b Study to 
Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612318]’s Syndrome 
Study center(s): Approximately 60 sites in the United S tates, Canada, and the European U nion  
Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_349580]: TBD  
Studied period (years):  
Estimated date first subject enrolled: Q2 [ADDRESS_811828]  completed: Q2 2022 Phase of development:  
2b 
Objectives:  
Primary:  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612319] 
(aged > 6 to < 18 years) with Tourette’s Syndrome (TS). 
Secondary: 
The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety of ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612320] (aged > 6 to <18 years) with TS and characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612313].  
Exploratory: 
To evaluate the PK/pharmacodynamic relationship between plasma levels of ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612321].  
Methodology:  
This is a multicenter, placebo -controlled, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, Phase 2 b study in 
pediatric subjects (aged >6 to <18 years) with TS.  Following a 28 -day Screening period and Baseline 
visit, eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive either a target steady -state dose of 
2 mg/kg /day ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612322] a 4-week Titration period followed by [CONTACT_1629] 8- week 
Treatment period.  Following titration, subjects who weigh 18 kg to <23 kg will receive a 37.5-mg 
active dose (or placebo), subjects  who weigh >23 kg to <34 kg will receive a 50-mg active dose (or 
placebo), subjects who weigh >34 kg to <44 kg will receive a 75-mg active dose (or placebo), 
subjects who weigh >44  kg to <68 kg will receive a 100 -mg active dose (or placebo), subjects  who 
weigh >68  kg to <83 kg will receive a 150-mg active dose (or placebo), and subjects who weigh 
>83 kg will receive a 200- mg active dose (or placebo). 
After the screening period, subjects will retu rn to the clinic at Baseline and 4, 6, 8 and 12 weeks after 
Randomization.  Study Visits at Weeks 4, 6, 8 and 12 after randomization may be completed in 
locations other than clinic and/or s afety and efficacy assessments required at these visits will be made 
available for remote administration due to restrictions as a consequence of the COVID -[ADDRESS_811829] dose of study medication  may be completed in locations other than clinic and/or s afety 
and efficacy assessments required at these visits will be made available for remote administration due 
to restrictions as a consequence of the COVID-[ADDRESS_811830] (DSMB) when 
50% of the total subjects complete the study.  The DSMB will determine the probability of a 
successful study (conditional power).  If this probability is too small and does meet pre- specified 
criteria, the DSMB could recommend stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_402928].  If th e probability of a successful 
study is reasonable, the DSMB can recommend conti nuing the study as planned.  The DSMB can also 
recommend the continuation of the study with a sample size adjustment based on conditional power.   
Sample Size Justification:  
A sample size of 75 subjects per group will provide >80% power to detect difference between groups 
of 3 points on change from baseline the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale-T otal Tic Score ( YGTSS -
TTS), with standard deviation = 6.1 and alpha = 0.05 , assuming 10% drop out.

of Life Scale for Children and Adolescents (C&A -GTS-QOL)  and the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale 
(PARS).  Subjects will be monitored for signs of abuse, and withdrawal or dependence.  
PK: 
Blood samples will be collected to measure concentrations of ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612311]/or its major (active) 
metabolites at Weeks 4 and 12.  If visits a t Weeks 4 and 12 are not conducted at a site due to 
restrictions as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic or other q ualifying event, collection of PK 
samples is optional.   
For the Week 4 visit, a morning appointment is suggested.  P arents/caregivers will be instructed not to 
administer the study medication to the subject on the evening prior to the Week [ADDRESS_811834] samples collected at the following 
time windows:  one sample at pre -dose ( [ADDRESS_811835] dose), one sample between 0.[ADDRESS_811836] 30 min apart.   
For the W eek 12 visit, parents/caregivers will be asked to record the time of study drug administration 
on the evening prior to the visit.  An appointment is suggested to be made for  the morning of the 
Week 12 visit .  A blood sample will be collected at the end of the visit.  The time of sample collection 
will be recorded.  Blood samples will be processed as outlined in the protocol and serum/plasma will 
be frozen, shipped and analyzed for ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612331]40853.  
Statistical methods:  
Efficacy:  
The Modified Intention -to-Treat (mITT) population will include all randomized subjects who 
received at least one dose of study drug.  The mITT population will be used for the analysis of the 
efficacy endpoints. 
The primary efficacy endpoint for this study will be the change from Baseline (YGTSS -TTS from 
Baseline) to end of therapy (YGTSS -TTS from  Week  12).   
The primary endpoint will be assessed with a Mixed Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM) model 
which will include fixed effects for treatment, visit (categorical week in  study ), interaction between 
treatment and visit, center and a covariate for baseline YGTSS -TTS.  Taking consideration of missing 
data, multiple imputa tion or tippi[INVESTIGATOR_612332] a sensitivity analysis  
Secondary endpoints will be evaluated in a similar manner with hierarchy to preserve alpha.  
Additional analyses may need to be conducted for data not collected at sites and/or collected v ia 
remote administration due to restrictions as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic or other 
qualifying event , details of these  additional analyses will be specified in the SAP.   
The full details will be specified in the SAP.

5.1 Background  on Tourette’s Syndrome  
Tourette’s Syndrome (TS) is a neurological disorder characterized by [CONTACT_612409] (see box below with the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual for Mental Disorders – 5th Edition [DSM-5 diagnostic criteria).   The tics are brief in 
duration, occur spontaneously, and do not show a regular temporal pattern.  Further the tics are 
not caused by [CONTACT_6589], other medical reasons, or confirmed neurological abnormality.  They 
can be consciously suppress ed for some time  and are exacerbated by [CONTACT_174120].  Males are more 
susceptible than females with a ratio of about 4.1 to 3.  Motor tics can include such things as eye-
blinking, facial grimacing, mouth movements, head jerks, shoulder shrugs and arm/leg jerks. In 
more severe cases gyrating, bending, pi[INVESTIGATOR_612334].  Vocal tics 
are fast meaningless sounds or noises, and include such things as sniffing, throat clearing, grunting, barks and squealing.  Complex vocal tics can include shouting out of single words, 
whole sen tences or repeating words (echolalia).  In small numbers of subjects , explosive 
obscenities (coprolalia) are possible.
P1,2
P  Diagnosis of TS is complicated because it often co- exists 
with other psychiatric illnesses.   Common co-morbid conditions include attention 
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), anxiety, and 
depression. P2
P  These symptoms often mask TS and make diagnosis difficult.  Tic severity can 
range from mild to severe according to its frequency and intensity.  The tics have a variable 
course, with severe bouts interspersed with complete absence of symptoms.  Onset of tics is seen 
early in childhood (average approximately 7 year s) and peaks in the teenage years.  Vocal tics 
appears several years after the onset of motor tics.  For most subjects , the period of worst- ever tic 
severity is between [ADDRESS_811845] into adulthood and require treatment.  Complete remission of tics 
is reported in approximately 50% of subjects .  Severe tics are thought t o occur only in about 10% 
of the cases. P3
P  
 DSM -5 Diagnostic  Criteria  For Tourette's  Syndrome  
 
  Note: A tic is a sudden, rapid, recurrent,  nonrhythmic,  stereotyped motor movement  or 
vocalization . 
A. Both multiple  motor and  one or more  vocal  tics have been  present at some  time during the  
illness,  although  not necessarily  concurrently.  
B. The tics may wax and wane in frequency but have persisted for more than [ADDRESS_811846] tic onset.  
C. The onset  is before  age 18 years.  
D. The disturbance  is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g. Cocaine) 
or another medical condition (e.g. Huntington’s disease, postviral encephalitis).

Confidential Page 36 of 95 Natural History of Tics  
 
 
Approaches to the treatment of tics include: education, behavioral therapy, pharmacological 
therapy and treatment of comorbid conditions (ADD, OCD).  Approximately, 20% of subjects  do 
not need treatment.  Counseling and behavioral therapy may be sufficient with mild symptoms.  
Medications should be considered when tics interfere with peer relationships, social interactions, job or school performance or interfere with activities of daily living.  Medications should be 
started at low doses, titrated up slowly to lowest effective d ose and tapered slowly during non-
stressful periods.  Medication therapy incudes: dopamine receptor blocking agents, dopamine 
depleting agents, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], low dose dopamine agonists, botulinum toxin and 
neurosurgical treatment.  Non-selective dopamin e receptor blocking agents have been the 
mainstay of treatment and are the most effective.  They suppress tics in 70-80% of subjects .  
Many subjects  eventually discontinue medication therapy due to adverse events, including extra-
pyramidal disorders, somnolence, blood glucose changes, weight gain and effects on lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805].  A 
selective D1 dopamine receptor blocking agent may mitigate against some of these adverse events and has to potential to offer a safer alternative option.  
5.1.1. Disrupted Dopamine Systems in Tourette’s Syndrome 
The underlying mechanism responsible for TS is unknown.  Although the disease tends to run in 
families, there have been no definitive genetic mutations identified.
P4
P  Research to date has 
indicated that dopamine circuits in the central ne rvous system (CNS) are intimately involved 
based on the following observations. P5,6,7
P  
• Dopamine-rich areas of the brain (e.g., striatum) are believed to control motor tics . 
• Clinical neuroimaging studies of TS subjects  implicate dopamine -rich brain areas .

Clinical Summary: Legacy Schering -Plough Studies in Indications other than TS 
The early clinical program for ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612336]-Plough investigated the safety 
and effectiveness of ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612337], cocaine addiction and schizophrenia 
in adults.  These comprised 30 Phase 1 studies; seven Phase 2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602], 5 in subjects with schizophrenia and 2 (including 1 extension study) in subjects with cocaine addiction; and 
1 completed Phase 2 and 3 discontinued Phase 3 studies in subjects  with a primary diagnosis of 
moderate to severe obesity.

Ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612316] 6.0, Amendment 5, 13 April 2020 
 
Confidential Page 38 of 95 The Phase 1 s tudies examined ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612313]'s pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, bioavailability, 
distribution, food-effects on absorption, interactions with other drugs, bioequivalence of different 
formulations, and various physiological effects in cocaine users, smokers, or healthy subjects .  
The results of these studies demonstrate that ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612338] -tolerated with no clinically 
significant changes in physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), laboratory tests, electroencephalograms (EEGs), neurolo gical examinations, or liver function tests (LFTs).  
Most of the reported adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity.  The most commonly 
reported adverse event in Phase I clinical studies was somnolence.  Other commonly reported 
adverse events in Phase I clinical studies were headache, fatigue, nausea and insomnia.  
In a Phase 2 study (C197-184), 279 subjects  with cocaine dependence in three dose groups (10-, 
25-, and 100 mg/day) were exposed to ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612339] a placebo-controlled study.  
No differences in the reduction of cocaine use were demonstrated in favor of ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612340].  The most common adverse events reported among all subjects  in the 
cocaine addiction studies were fatigue, headache, nausea, insomnia, and somnole nce.  Fatigue 
and somnolence appeared to be reported more often in subjects  treated with ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612341].  Somnolence appeared to occur in a dose-related fashion, occurring in 28% (26/94), 
31% (29/94), 43% (39/91), and 20% (19/93) of subjects  treated with ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612342] , 10, 25, and 
100 mg/day, and placebo, respectively.   
Five open- label safety, tolerability  and Phase [ADDRESS_811847] 
commonly reported adverse events were somnolence (21%, 12/56), headache, nausea, vomiting 
and dizziness (each reported in 14%, 8/56 subjects ), insomnia (9%, 5/56), dyspepsia (7%, 4/56), 
and anxiety (7%, 4/56).  
In a Phase 2, double -blind, placebo-controlled study (C/I98-271), 185 subjects  with a primary 
diagnosis of moderate to severe obesity were treated with ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612327] (10, 30, or 100 mg PO, 
once per day) for [ADDRESS_811848] commonly reported adverse events by [CONTACT_612410][INVESTIGATOR_612343], 19% (36/185), viral infection, 19% (36/185), somnolence, 18% (34/185), insomnia, 
9% (17/185), and nausea, 9% (16/185).   
In three Phase 3, double-blind, placebo -controlled studies (P00359, P00396, and P00741), obese 
subjects  including type 2 diabetic subjects  were treated with ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612327] (50 or 100 mg PO, 
QD) for 52 weeks.  Subjects receiving ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612344] a dose-dependent weight loss.  
These Phase 3 studies were discontinued because of unexpected psychiatric adverse events 
(ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612313] 31% vs. placebo 15%), including depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation, thereby 
[CONTACT_612411].  The most frequently reported adverse events 
in all Phase [ADDRESS_811849] infection, 
30% (439 of 1482 subjects reporting), insomnia 17% (248/1482), headache, 16% (244/1482),

14% (211/1482), pharyngitis, 9% (137/1482), back pain, 8% (114/1482), nausea, 7% (107/1482).  The frequencies of insomnia, depression, somnolence and anxiety were about twice as frequent 
in subjects  receiving ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612345].  The frequencies of upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_612346], Inc.  Protocol EBS-101- CL-[ADDRESS_811850] infection, headache, fatigue, pharyngitis, back pain and nausea were similar in frequencies 
in subjects  receiving ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612347].   
Clinical Summary: Legacy Psyadon Studies in Indications other than TS 
Following acquisition of ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612348]-Plough, two Phase 1 studies, one 
study in Lesch- Nyhan Disease (LND) subjects aged  ≥6 years old (PSY101) and one study of the 
pharmacokinetics of ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612349] (PSY401), 
were completed.   
One Phase 2a study in adult subjects  with Pathological Gambling (PG) (PSY201) was also 
completed.  In addition, a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 3-period crossover study with an open-label extension in subjects  with LND (≥ 6 years old) (PSY102) was 
discontinued before completion for financial (non- safety related) reasons.  
In the Phase 1 LND study (PSY101), in which [ADDRESS_811851] commonly 
reported adverse events were sedation (3 subjects ), dystonia (2 subjects ) and nausea (2 subjects ). 
In a Phase 2a, single-blind (the subjects  were blinded to treatment assignment), nonrandomized 
study, 28 subjects  with PG (PS Y201) received placebo (1-2 tablets/day orally depending on their 
urge to gamble) for 1 week and then ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612313] (1-2 50 mg tablets/day orally depending on their 
urge to gamble) for [ADDRESS_811852] commonly reported adverse events (incidence≥5%) were 
drowsiness (11%), fatigue (11%), anxiety (11%), vomiting (11%), headache (7%), fever (7%), depression (7%) and rhinorrhea (7%).  
A Phase 3 study (PSY102) of ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612350]-injurious behaviors in LND 
subjects  was conducted .  A total of nine pediatric subjects  were enrolled before the study was 
terminated for non- safety related reasons.   Ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612351] 50  mg/day 
(<20 kg body weight) or 100 mg/day (>20 kg body weight).  In the PSY102 LND study, one 
subject aged [ADDRESS_811853] dopaminergic

unlikely to occur in subjects without this disorder.

Study PSY301  
In a Phase 2a multicenter, open -label, nonrandomized study, 18 adult subjects with TS (PSY301) 
were given ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612342]  50 mg for 2 weeks followed by 100 mg for 6 weeks.  The primary 
outcome measure was Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS).  After ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612312], 
YGTSS total score s, motor tics scores, phonic tics scores and overall impairment were all 
significantly decreased from baseline to endpoint, which indicated that the severity of tics was

and anxiety (22%).  
Study PSY302  
In a Phase 2b multicenter, double blind, randomized, crossover study (PSY302), 40 children/ 
adolescents (ages 7 -17 years) were given ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612352] 50 mg/day (if <75 lbs) or 100 mg/day 
(if >75  lbs) for four weeks.  The primary endpoint was the YGTSS Total (MP) Scores which 
were the sum of the motor and phonic subscales of YGTSS. In the ITT population, the mean (±SD) YGTSS Total (MP) Scores at baseline were 32.8 (±7.1) prior to ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612353] 33.7 (±6.7) prior to placebo treatment.  On Day 16 of the treatment period, YGTSS Total (MP) 
Scores decreased 5.1 (±8.5) points on ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612311] 2.1(±4.7) points on placebo.  On Day 30, 
YGTSS Total (MP) Scores decreased 5. 5 (±8.7) points on Ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612311] 3.4 (±5.8) points on 
placebo. Similar results were observed in the Evaluable population.  
In the ITT population, LS means (±SE) of the difference between ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612354] -2.8885±1.5282 (95%CI: -5.9822, 0.2053, p=0.0664) on Day 16 and -2.1366 
±1.6551 (95%CI: -5.4871, 1.2139, p=0.2045) on Day 30.  The treatment difference was more 
obvious in the evaluable population for both dates (on Day 16, p=0.0155, and on Day 30, 
p=0.0435). 
With respect to secondary endpoints, the changes of subscale scores were similar to YGTSS 
Total (MP) Scores results. In the ITT population, the mean (±SD) motor, phonic, impairment and 
global scores (the sum of motor, phonic and impairment scores) at baseline were 18.4 (±3.3), 14.4 (±4.9), 28.0 (±10.7) and 60.8 (±16.5) prior to ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612313], and 18.3 (±3.4), 15.4 (±4.5), 27.5 
(±9.3) and 61.2 (±14.0) prior to placebo, respectively.  After 30 -day treatment, the decreases in 
scores  compared to baseline were 3.3 (±4.2), 2.3 (±4.9), 7.0 (±11.6) and 12.6 (±18.7) on 
ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612311] 1.6 (±3.3), 1.8 (±3.6), 3.0 (±9.1) and 6.4 (±13.4) on placebo, respectively.  Similar 
results were observed in evaluable population. 
In the ITT population, afte r 30-days of treatment, CGI Severity Scores decreased 0.8 (±0.7) 
points on ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612311] 0.2 (±0.9) points on placebo.  Also, after ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612312], the 
percentages of subjects with much improved, minimally improved, no change, minimally worse 
CGI Improv ement ratings were 40.00%, 15.00%, 20.00% and 12.5%, while the percentages on 
placebo were 20.00%, 27.50%, 32.50% and 12.50%, respectively.  Similar results were observed in evaluable population.  These data suggest that the subjects’ disease severity decreased  and that 
they had greater improvement while on ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612313]. 
In the ITT population, the mean (±SD) DuPaul ADHD rating scale at baseline was 20.2 (±11.6) 
points prior to ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612311] 22.1 (±11.3) points prior to placebo.  On Day 30, ADHD scores 
decreased 1.9 (±5.2) points on ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612311] 2.7 (±6.6) points on placebo. ADHD scales were 
almost unchanged after ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612312].  Similar results were observed in evaluable 
population. 
In the ITT population, the mean (±SD) YBOCS total scores at baseline were 5.7 (±6.3) prior to 
ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612311] 6.6 (±6.9) prior to placebo.  On Day 30 of the treatment period, YBOCS total 
scores decreased 0.8 (±3.3) points on ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612311] 0.9(±4.1) points on placebo.  The results of

events were more common in ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612362].  Th ere were no serious adverse 
events (SAEs) and only one subject discontinued treatment due to an adverse event in the 
ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612363].  Most adverse events were mild to moderate in severity.   Adverse events in the 
Psychiatric Disorders, Central Nervous System Disorders and Gastrointestinal Disorders 
categories were more common with ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612364].  Notably, more subjects  experienced 
adverse events of somnolence, insomnia, sedation, restlessness, irritability, nausea and vomiting with ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612365].  There were no AEs of extra-pyramidal symptoms in the pediatric study.  A higher percentage of subjects on ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612366] 5 pounds or more during 
the study than with placebo (17.5% compared to 15%).  Orthostatic blood pressure assessments 
were not done (or not reported).  A table of weight changes was provided for the open- label 
extension study (PSY302A) and almost all of the children gained weight after 3, 6, [ADDRESS_811859] commonly reported adverse events (incidence ≥20%) were sedation (33%), insomnia (33%), fatigue (33%), somnolence (28%), headache (22%), muscle 
twitching (22%) and anxiety (22%).  Two subjects developed adverse event of akathisia and one 
developed an adverse event of tremor, both of which are extrapyramidal reactions.  Three of 18 subjects (16.7%) also discontinued study drug due to an adverse event. 
For the older obesity and cocaine dependence program, there were subjects who experienced 
adverse events of weight gain, suicidal ideation, diabetes, extrapyramidal reactions, somnolence, insomnia, hypotension and sexual side effects.  There was no raw data on orthostatic blood 
pressure.  In a table of all adverse events during the whole program, the adverse event of 
dyskinesia is listed but is not in any of the data tables.  When reviewing the large Phase 2 and 
Phase 3 studies in obesity and the other indications, the rate of tardive dyskinesia appears to be 
extremely low (or absent) and the rate of other extrapyramidal reactions (akathisia, tremor, etc.) 
appears at rates that are largely less than what is seen with D1/D2 antagonists.  Data for shifts in 
fasting glucose or lipi[INVESTIGATOR_612367]’s Brochure prepared by a previous sponsor

tics was decreased (Table 16, Investigator’s Brochure).  
In a Phase 2b double-blind, randomized crossover study in children/adolescents (ages 7-17 
years) with TS (PSY302), 40 subjects were enrolled and 38 (95.0%) completed the study.  The primary endpoint was the YGTSS Total (MP) score.   
Ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612371] a numerical decrease in the YGTSS Total score relative to the 
placebo treatment, but the decrease was not statistically significant (Figure 9, Investigator’s 
Brochure).  The least squares means (±SE) of the difference between ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612354] -2.8885 (±1.5282); 95% CI: -5.9822, 0.2053, p=0.0664) on Day 16 and -2.1366

5.3.3. Methods to Minimize Risks 
The following steps are incorporated in the protocol to minimize risks to subjects:  
• Subjects will be screened for appropriateness to participate in the study. 
• All subjects will be evaluated for safety every two weeks while receiving study medication, with 4 evaluations conducted at the site  and 2 via tele phone assessments . 
• All subjects will be evaluated using the following scales to assess possible worsening of other psychiatric symptoms or other side effects: 
− Abnormal Involuntary Movements Scale 
− Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale  
− Caregiver Global Impression of Change 
− Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
− Children’s Depression Rating Scale 
− Children’s Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale 
− Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome Quality of Life Scale  
− Pediatric Anxiety Scale  
− Swanson, Nolan and Pelham Questionnaire

7.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a multicenter,  randomized, double-blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, Phase 2b 
study in pediatric subjects  (aged >6 to <18 years) with TS.  Following a S creening period up to 
28 days and B aseline visit , eligible subjects  will be randomized 1:1 to receive either a target 
steady -state dose of 2 mg/kg/day  ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612322] a 4 -week Titration 
period followed by [CONTACT_1629] 8- week Treatment period.  Following titration, subjects who weigh ≥18 kg 
to <23 kg will receive a 37.5 -mg active dose (or placebo), subjects who weigh >23 kg to <34 kg 
will receive a 50 -mg active dose (or placebo), subjects who weigh >34 kg to < 44 kg will receive 
a 75-mg active dose (or placebo), subjects who weigh >44 kg to < 68 kg will receive a 1 00-mg 
active dose (or placebo), subjects who weigh >68 kg to <83 kg will receive a 150- mg active dose 
(or placebo), and subjects who weigh >83 kg will receive a 200-mg active dose (or placebo). 
After the Screening period, subjects  will return to the clinic  at Baseline and  at 4, 6, 8, and  
12 weeks after Randomization.  Study visits at Weeks 4, 6, 8 and 12 after randomization may be 
completed in locations other than clinic and/or s afety and efficacy assessments required at these 
visits will be made available for remote administration due to restrictions as a consequence of the 
COVID-[ADDRESS_811862] dose of 
study medication to determine any adverse events.  At study completion or early termination, 
subjects will be tapered off study drug as outlined in the protocol.  
7.2. Number of Subjects  
One hundred and fifty subjects  will partic ipate in the study. 
7.3. Treatment Assignment  
Subjects  will be randomized 1:[ADDRESS_811863]’s weight at 
Baseline according to the following weight bands to better achieve the targeted 2 mg/kg/day target dose: ≥18 to ≤23 kg, >23 to ≤34 kg, >34 to ≤44 kg, >44 to ≤68 kg, >68 to ≤83 kg, >[ADDRESS_811864]  with a new positive response on questions 4 and/or 5 of the Columbia Suicide 
Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS ) will be immediately discontinued and evaluated for risk.  
Dosing may be restarted at the discretion of the Investigator following consultation with the 
Sponsor or its designee. 
Subjects  who discontinue early from the study will be evaluated for one of these primary 
reasons: AE(s), lost to follow-up, subject choice, inadequate therapeutic effect, and 
administrative/other.  In addition to the primary reason, the subject may have indicated one or 
more of these reasons as secondary reasons for discontinuation.  Study disposition information will be colle cted on the CRF. 
Subjects  who discontinue treatment for any reason, other than an SAE (even if the SAE is not 
treatment related) or an AE (unless the AE can be determined to be unrelated to treatment), may be replaced only after consultation with Sponsor or its designee.

This dosing regimen was chosen based on modeling and simulation with the results and 
important information summarized below:  
• A double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of 40 subjects  with TS aged 7 to 
17 years receiving ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612387] 50 mg (if <75 pounds) or 100 mg (if >75 pounds), 
after a titration, showed that it is likely that ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612388] a post-hoc analysis (Study PSY302); 
• 2 mg/kg targets a mg/kg dose that is above the median mg/kg dose in 75% of subjects  in 
Study PSY302, with the remaining 25% of subjects having a mg/kg dose that is substantially below the 95
Pth
P percentile from Study PSY302; 
• The predicted plasma concentration -time curves for the median, 5 Pth
P percentile and 95 Pth
P 
percentile are within the exposures  studied in PSY302 and similar to other proposed 
dosing regimens; 
• The animal:human ratios for the active moieties (unconjugated parent plus active 
metabolite, SCH40853) are adequate based on the no-observed-adverse- effects -level 
(NOAEL) in the 3 -month GLP toxicology study for mice (30 mg/kg), the 3-month GLP 
toxicology study in rhesus monkeys at 12 mg/kg, and the 1-year GLP toxicology study in 
cynomolgus monkeys at 12 mg/kg and do not differ from those in Study PSY302 (Table 5).  For rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys, the main toxicities observed at 
12 mg/kg were decreased activity, decreased appetite, and decreased defecation.  For cynomolgus monkeys, these AEs were reported during the first 1 to 3 weeks (hence, the need for titration in the proposed clinical study Protocol EBS-101- CL-001). 
• In Study PSY302, the treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., nausea, upper abdominal pain), general disorders and administrative site conditions (e.g., decreased appetite, fatigue), and nervous systems disorders (e.g., somnolence, headache, sedation).  The current study will incorporate a two- week titration 
which has the potential to improve tolerability.   
• While studying multiple dose levels is important in a Phase 2b study, a dose titration approach (instead of fixed 3-dose parallel design study) was chosen because the PSY302 
study suggested that doses lower than ∼ 1.4 mg/kg the [ADDRESS_811884] substantial efficacy.  The exposure between ∼1.4 mg/kg and ∼ 2 mg/kg would have 
significant overlap in exposure (i.e., they would not be distinctly different doses), doses higher than ∼ 2 mg/kg may not be well tolerated, and doses higher than ∼ 2 mg/kg would 
result in animal:human exposures significantly lower than 1.

10.7. Study Drug Accountability  
The Investigator (or pharmacist, as appropriate) must maintain records of the delivery of the 
study drug to the study site, the inventory at the site, use for each subject, and return of the study 
drug to a delegate of the Sponsor.  Total study site accountability will be conducted at the end of the study and the Investigator must explain all discrepancies.  
A Drug Dispensing Log must be kept current and should contain the following information:  
• Identification (subject number and initials  or as allowed per local requirements ) of 
subject to whom the study drug was dispensed 
• The dates and lot numbers for the study drug dispensed  
• Initial inventory on receipt of drug at the site  
• Final inventory on completion of the study  
All records and inventory must be available for inspection by [CONTACT_12935] 
(CRA).

12.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
12.2.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered 
a study drug and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not related to the study drug. 
An abnormality identified during a medical test (e.g., laboratory parameter, vital sign, ECG data, 
physical exam) should be defined as an AE only if the abnormality meets one of the following criteria:  
• Induces clinical signs or symptoms 
• Requires active intervention 
• Requires interruption or discontinuation of study medication  
• The abnormality or investigational value is clinically significant in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the deterioration of a pre-
existing medical condition including worsening of TS following or during exposure to a 
pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered casually related to the product.  In clinical 
studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including baseline or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered. 
All AEs that occur after any subject has been screened, enrolled, before treatment, during 
treatment, or within [ADDRESS_811890] be recorded on forms provided by [CONTACT_226422]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse ev ent is an AE occurring during any study phase ( i.e., baseline, treatment, 
washout, or follow-up), and at any dose of the investigational product, comparator or placebo, 
that fulfils one or more of the following: 
• Results in death  
• It is immediately life -thre atening . 
• It requires in -subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. 
• It results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity . 
• Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect

Confidential Page 66 of 95 • It is an important medical event that may jeopardize the subject  or may require medical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
All SAEs that occur after any subject /subject has been enrolled, before treatment, during 
treatment, or within  [ADDRESS_811891] be recorded on forms provided by [CONTACT_13670].  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Other Adverse Event (OAE)  
OAEs will be identified by [CONTACT_257977].  Significant adverse events of particular clinical importance, other than SAEs and those AEs leading to 
discontinuation of the subject /subject from the study, will be classified as OAEs.  For each OAE, 
a narrative may be written and included in the Clinical Study Report.  Adverse events of special 
interest (AESI) include weight gain and extra- pyramidal reactions.  
12.3. Relationship to Study Drug  
An Investigator who is qualified in medicine must make the determination of relationship to the 
investigational product for each AE (Unrelated, Possibly Related or Probably Related).  The 
Investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, t here is a reasonable 
possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_7198].  If no valid reason 
exists for suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “unrelated.”  If there is 
any valid reason, even if undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause- and-effect relationship 
between the investigational product and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be considered “related.”  
If the relationship between the AE/SAE and the investigational product is determined to be “possible” or “probable” the event will be considered related to the I nvestigational Product for 
the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting. 
12.4. Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_127205]/or in response to an open question 
from the study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_7235].  Clinically significant changes in laboratory values, blood pressure, and 
pulse can be reported as AEs  per the investigator’s judgement .  However, abnormal values that 
constitute an SAE or lead to discontinuation of administration of study drug must be reported 
and recorded as an AE.  Information about AEs will be collected from the signing of consent 
form until the end of the study.  SAE  information will be collected from signing of consent form 
until [ADDRESS_811892] 
medical terminology when possible.  For each AE, the investigator will evaluate and report the onset (date and time), resolution (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken, serious outcome (if applicable), and whether or not it caused the subject  to discontinue the study. 
Intensity will be assessed according to the following scale: 
• Mild ( awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated) 
• Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)

Ecopi[INVESTIGATOR_612308] 6.0, Amendment 5, 13 April 2020 
 
Confidential Page 67 of 95 • Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities)  
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_31468]  [IP_ADDRESS].  An AE of severe intensity 
may not be considered serious. 
Should a pregnancy of a subject or partner occur, it must be reported and recorded on Sponso r’s 
or Sponsor approved pregnancy form.  Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there 
is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_49850] a contraceptive medication.   Reports of pregnancy must be submitted to Syneos Health Safety &

representatives  within one business day of receipt and this should be completed on a follow -up 
SAE form and placed with the original SAE information and kept with the appropriate section of 
the CRF and/or study file. 
The Sponsor and its representatives are responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory 
authorities of certain events.  It is the Principal Investigator’s responsibility to notify the IRB or 
IEC of all SAEs that occur at his or her site.  Investigators will also be notified of all unexpected, 
serious, drug-related events (7/15 Day Safety Reports) that occur during the clinical study.  Each 
site is responsible for notifying its IRB or IEC of these additional SAEs.

cleaned by [CONTACT_514702], and the analysis and reporting of the interim data to the DSMB will be the responsibility of an independent statistical group (who will not be directly 
involved in the conduct of the study).  The DSMB will meet afte r the data presentation and issue 
recommendations relating to safety and study conduct; after the interim analysis, these 
recommendations may also include stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_612391].  
The rationale for these recommendatio ns will be documented in a set of minutes as to the safety 
and viability (i.e., conditional power) of the study to reach its goals at study completion.  The 
Emalex Biosciences, Inc.  Protocol EBS-101- CL-[ADDRESS_811897] (DSMB) meetings to primarily assess safety and preliminary efficacy.   An interim analysis will 
be conducted after approximately 50% of subjects  have enrolled and completed treatment or 
early termination procedures are completed.   These interim analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_612417].  The DSMB will assess the safety 
data as well as the probability of a successful study based on observed data (conditional power).  
The DSMB could recommend stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_402928].  The decision to stop the study will 
include evaluating the probability of successful study (conditional power), as well as safety data and other prespecified criteria to be described in the DSMB charter .  The DSMB can also 
recommend the continuation of the study as planned or with a sample size adjustment based on 
the conditional power.  If the sample size is adjusted,  the CHW (Cui -Hung-Wang) method will 
be used to control the type 1 error in the final analysis. 
Full details of the DSMB procedures including primary responsibilities of the DSMB, its 
relationship with other study components, its membership, and the purpose and timings of its 
meetings will be documented in a DSMB charter.  These details will also includ e procedures to 
ensure confidentiality and proper communication, the guidelines to be implemented by [CONTACT_612418] (unblinded) and open reports (blinded) that will be provided to the DSMB.

A sample size of 75 subjects per group will provide >80% power to detect difference between groups of 3 points on change from baseline the Yale Global Tic Severity Sc ale-Total Tic Score 
(YGTSS -TTS), with standard deviation = 6.1 and alpha = 0.05, assuming 10% drop out. 
Emalex Biosciences, Inc.  Protocol EBS-101- CL-[ADDRESS_811898] ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS  
The sponsor should ensure that it is specified in the protocol or other written agreement that the 
investigator(s)/institution(s) will permit study-related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review, and 
regulatory inspection(s) by [CONTACT_54454] a ccess to source data/documents.  
14.1. Study Monitoring  
Before an investigational site can enter a subject  into the study, the Sponsor or its representatives 
will visit the investigational study site to:  
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities . 
• Discuss with the investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard to 
protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of Emalex  or its representatives.  This will be 
documented in a Clinical Study Agreement between Emalex  and the investigator. 
During the study, a monitor from the Sponsor or its representatives will have regular contacts with the investigational site, for the following: 
• Provide information and support to the investigator(s). 
• Confirm  that facilities remain acceptable . 
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being accurately recorded in the case report forms, and that investigational product accountability checks are being performed. 
• Perform sou rce data verification.  This includes a comparison of the data in the case 
report forms with the subject ’s medical records at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7117], and other 
records relevant to the study.  This will require direct access to all original records for each subject (e.g. clinic charts). 
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to Emalex . 
• Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on CRFs and confirm any SAEs have been forwarded to the Sponsor or its representatives and those SA Es that met 
criteria for reporting have been forwarded to the IRB.

WMA DECLARATION OF HELSINKI – ETHICAL PRINCIPLES FOR 
MEDICAL RESEARCH  INVOLVING HUMAN SUBJECTS 
Preamble 
1.         The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a 
statement of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, including research 
on identifiable human materia l and data.  
The Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs should 
be applied with consideration of all other relevant paragraphs. 
2.         Consistent with the mandate of the WMA, the Declaration is addressed prim arily to 
physicians. The WMA encourages others who are involved in medical research involving human 
subjects to adopt these principles. 
General  Principles  
3.         The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, “The health 
of my subject  will be my first consideration,” and the International Code of Medical Ethics 
declares that, “A physician shall act in the subject’s best interest  when providing medical care.” 
4.         It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health, well-being and rights 
of subject s, including those who are involved in medical research. The physician’s knowledge 
and conscience are dedicated t o the fulfilment of this duty. 
5.         Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving 
human subjects. 
6.         The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to understand the 
causes, developm ent and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic 
interventions (methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best proven interventions must be 
evaluated continually through research for their safety, effectiveness, efficiency , accessibility 
and quality. 
7.         Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote and ensure respect for all 
human subjects and protect their health and rights. 
8.         While the primary purpose of medical research is to generate new  knowledge, this goal 
can never take precedence over the rights and interests of individual research subjects.  
9.         It is the duty of physicians who are involved in medical research to protect the life, 
health, dignity, integrity, right to self- deter mination, privacy, and confidentiality of personal 
information of research subjects. The responsibility for the protection of research subjects must 
Emalex Biosciences, Inc.  Protocol EBS-101- CL-[ADDRESS_811911], 
incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions for treating and/or compensating 
subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the research study. 
In clinical trials, the protocol must also describe appropriate arrangements for post- trial 
provisions. 
Research  Ethics  Committees  
23.       The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance and 
approval to the concerned research ethics committee before the study begins. This committee 
must be transparent in its functioning, must be independent of the researcher, the sponsor and 
any other undue influence and must be duly qualified. It must take into consideration the laws 
and regulations of the country or countries in which the research is to be performed as well as 
applicable international norms and standards but these must not be allowed to reduce or 
eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration. 
The committee must have the right to monitor ongoing studies. The researcher must provide 
monitoring information to the committee, especially information about any serious adverse 
events. No amendment to the protocol may be made without consideration and approval by [CONTACT_612421], Inc.  Protocol EBS-101- CL-[ADDRESS_811912] submit a final report to the committee 
containing a summary of the study’s findings and conclusions. 
Privacy and Confidentiality  
24.       Every precaution must be taken to protect the privacy of research subjects and the 
confidentiality of their personal information. 
Informed  Consent  
25.       Participation by [CONTACT_54126]. Although it may be appropriate to consult family members or 
community leaders, no individual capable of giving informed consent may be enrolled in a 
research study unless he or she freely agrees.  
26.       In medical research involving human subjects capable of giving informed consent, each 
potential subject must be adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any 
possible conflicts of interest, institutional affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated benefits 
and potential risks of the study and the discomfort it may entail, post-study provisions and any 
other relevant aspects of the study. The potential subject must be informed of the right to refuse 
to participate in the study or to withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal. 
Special attention should be given to the specific information needs of individual potential 
subjects as well as to the methods used to deliver the information. 
After ensuring that the potential subject has understood the information, the physician or another 
appropriately qualified individual must then seek the potential subject’s freely-given informed 
consent, preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be expressed in writing, the non- written 
consent must be formally documented and witnessed. 
All medical research subjects should be given the option of being informed about the general 
outcome and results of the study. 
27.       When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the physician must 
be particularly cautious if the potential subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician 
or may consent under duress. In such situations the informed consent must be sought by [CONTACT_612422]. 
28.       For a potential research subject who is incapable of giving informed consent, the 
physician must seek informed conse nt from the legally au thorised representative. These 
individuals must not be included in a research study that has no likelihood of benefit for them 
unless it is intended to promote the health of the group represented by [CONTACT_11275], the 
research  cannot instead be performed with persons capable of providing informed consent, and 
the research entails only minimal risk and minimal burden.  
29.       When a potential research subject who is deemed incapable of giving informed consent is 
able to give assent to decisions about participation in research, the physician must seek that 
Emalex Biosciences, Inc.  Protocol EBS-101-CL-[ADDRESS_811913]’s 
dissent should be respected. 
30.       Research involving subjects who are phys ically or mentally incapable of giving consent, 
for example, unconscious subjects , may be done only if the physic al or mental condition that 
prevents giving informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research group. In such 
circumstances the physician must seek inform ed consent from the legally authorised 
representative. If no such represen tative is available a nd if the research cannot be delayed, the 
study may proceed without informed consent pr ovided that the specific reasons for involving 
subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give inform ed consent have been stated in 
the research protocol and the study has been a pproved by a research ethics committee. Consent 
to remain in the research must be obtained as  soon as possible from the subject or a legally 
authorised representative. 
31.       The physician must fully inform the subj ect which aspects of thei r care are related to the 
research. The refusal of a subjec t to participate in a study or th e subject’s decision to withdraw 
from the study must never adversely a ffect the subject-phys ician relationship. 
32.       For medical research using identifiab le human material or da ta, such as research on 
material or data contained in biobanks or simil ar repositories, physicians  must seek informed 
consent for its collection, stor age and/or reuse. There may be exceptional situations where 
consent would be impossible or imp racticable to obtain for such re search. In such situations the 
research may be done only after consideration a nd approval of a research  ethics committee. 
Use of Placebo  
33.       The benefits, risks, burdens and eff ectiveness of a new interv ention must be tested 
against those of the best proven interventio n(s), except in the following circumstances: 
Where no proven intervention exists, the use of pl acebo, or no intervention , is acceptable; or 
Where for compelling and scie ntifically sound me thodological reasons the use of any 
intervention less effectiv e than the best proven one, the us e of placebo, or no intervention is 
necessary to determine the efficacy  or safety of an intervention 
and the subjects who receive any intervention less effective than the best proven one, placebo, or 
no intervention will not be subject to  additional risks of serious or ir reversible harm as a result of 
not receiving the best proven intervention. 
Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option. 
Post-Trial Provisions 
34.       In advance of a clinical trial, s ponsors, researchers and host country governments should 
make provisions for post-trial acces s for all participants who still need an intervention identified 
as beneficial in the trial. This  information must also be disclo sed to participants during the 
informed consent process. 
Emalex Biosciences, Inc.  Protocol EBS-101-CL-[ADDRESS_811914] or a legally aut horised representative, may use an unproven 
intervention if in the physician’s  judgement it offers hope  of saving life, re-e stablishing health or 
alleviating suffering. This intervention should su bsequently be made the object of research, 
designed to evaluate its safety and efficacy. In all cases, new in formation must be recorded and, 
where appropriate, made publicly available

Confidential Page 87 of 95 CONTRACEPTION GUIDELINES  
The Clinical Trials Facilitation Group’s recommendations related to contraception and 
pregnancy testing in clinical studi es include the use of highly effective forms of birth control.  
These methods include the following: 
• Combined (estrogen- and progestogen-containing) hormonal contraception associated 
with the inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, or transdermal) 
• Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with the inhibition of ovulation 
(oral, injectable, or implantable)  
• Intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Intrauterine hormone- releasing system (IUS)  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
• Vasectomized male partner  
− Vasectomised partn er is a highly effective birth control method provided that 
partner is the sole sexual partner of the woman of childbearing potential study participant and that the vasectomised partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success.  
• Sexual abstin ence (defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the 
entire period of exposure associated with the study treatment). 
− In the context of this guidance, sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective 
method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments.  The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.

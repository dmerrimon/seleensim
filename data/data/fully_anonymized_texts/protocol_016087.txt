Purpose of Study     
o Primary Aim:  To describe female patient  preferences when choosing their  
OB/GYN  and other providers . 
o Secondary Aim:  
o To assess  these preferences based on patient demographic factors as well as 
physician specialty . 
o To assess qualities which  are most important to female patients when choosing a 
physician .  
 
Hypothesis or Research Question  
• We hypothesize that females are not more  likely to choose a female physician, in 
particular for their O B/GYN care  
 
Background    
In 2017, the AAMC published that the number of women accepted into US medical school s 
increased by 3.2% and the female students represented 50.7% of the new enrollees [1]. This 
represents a dramatic increase in female trainees over the past decade.  Furthermore, the 
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) published that  as of 2009, 79.7% 
of the Obstetrics and Gynecology residents were female  [2]. This gender disparity could be 
related to perceived limitations in practice, leading to fewer males selecting this specialty.  
 
Nevertheless, it is not clear that females have s trong preferences regarding gender.  One study 
revealed that 34% of women preferred females because they were “more comfortable ” and 
“easier to talk to ”, 58% had no preference and only 7% preferred male providers because they 
were “more gentle” and “more c ompassionate”  [3, 4]. Another study reported that of the 
qualities when choosing an OB/GYN, it was experience, knowledge and ability that were what 
patients looked for over 15.7% reporting gender was a role in choice of physician  [3].  
 
The overall conclus ion drawn from these studies was that female physician choice is less based 
on gender preference and more on characteristic qualities [2 -5]. However, w omen aged ≤25

published more than 10 years ago. Given the striking decline in male providers selecting 
OB/GYN  in more recent years , it is critical to characterize patient preferences in the current 
environment. We hope to better understand the influence of bias on p hysician gender in 
present day.  
 
Research Plan   
• Study Design  
This will be a cross sectional survey conducted via an online server  
• Setting for the study  
The study will be conducted on an online platform distributed across the [LOCATION_002] 
by [CONTACT_334399] S urvey Monkey  
• Participants  
o Study population: All women between 18 and 80 years of age residing in  the [LOCATION_003]   
o Inclusion/Exclusion criteria:  
▪ Inclusion  
• Females between 18 and 80  years of age  (this will be selected 
during the target population inquiry within the  survey limits)  
▪ Exclusion  
• Unwillingness to participate in the study  
• Lack of access to the internet  
• Non-English speaking   
▪ Sample size  
• We hope to gather 1000 responses from females across the U.S.  
• SurveyMonkey ® will use their databank to recruit enough 
panelists for obtaining 1000 responses.   
• Data Collection  
o Primary Outcome:  
▪ Describe female population preferences based on physician gender  
o Secondary Outcomes:  
▪ Describe qualities that female patients use to choose physicians  
▪ Describe if physician specialty p lays a role in choice  
▪ Describe demographic factors that may predict patient preferences, such 
as age, race, socioeconomic factors  
o General demographic data:  
▪ Age, ethnicity , religion, parity, income level, education level, marital 
status,  medical insurance status, number of regularly seen  providers  
 
• Intervention or experimental aspect of the study  
o Procedure  
Physician Preference      3 
Template version: 10/16/15  ▪ Study group will be surveyed online using Survey Monkey using the 
Physician Prefer ence Survey designed by [CONTACT_473].  
 
• Statistical Analysis  
• Demog raphic data will be described using frequency (percentage). The association 
between the preference on physician gender and demographic factors will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_141612]’s chi -square test. Logistic regression will be used to investigate 
whether the prefer ence on physician gender can be predicted based on a 
demographic factor(s).  
 
Ethical Considerations  
• Informed consent  
o By [CONTACT_334400].  
A waiver of documentation of informed consent will be requ ested.   
• Privacy information  
o Because this is an online anonymous conducted survey, there will be no 
available identifying information.  
o Participants however,  will be logged in the Excel spreadsheet and assigned a 
Subject ID number. Each participant will be assigned the next available 
Subject ID number. Once each Subject ID number has been assigned, it will 
not be reassigned. The Excel spreadsheet will be stored on a password 
protected, encrypted TriHealth computer for ten years following study 
closure, and t hen purged.

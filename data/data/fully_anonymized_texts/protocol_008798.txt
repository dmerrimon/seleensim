of ZELTIQ.2. Introduction 
Background
Fat reduction and body contouring procedures, which include invasive, minimally-invasive, 
and non-invasive procedures, have become increasingly popular aesthetic procedures. 
Patients who are obese and do not have specific fat bulges but require significant fat 
reduction to achieve aesthetic results are candidates for invasive and minimally-invasive 
procedures, such as liposuction and laser-assisted liposuction. Although effective at reducing 
fat, these invasive and minimally-invasive procedures involve significant patient discomfort, 
expense, downtime, and the risks typi[INVESTIGATOR_229281]. As a result, 
patients who do not require significant fat reduction to achieve meaningful aesthetic results 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_229282]-invasive fat reduction and body contouring procedures to avoid the pain, 
expense, downtime, and surgical risks associated with invasive and minimally-invasive 
procedures.
ZELTIQ Aesthetics has developed and commercialized a technology for cold-assisted 
lipolysis.  The ZELTIQ CoolSculpting technology is based on the sensitivity of fat cells to 
cold injury in order to selectively eliminate subcutaneous fat tissue without affecting the skin 
or other surrounding tissues. The technology, cryolipolysis, enables a non-invasive 
alternative for subcutaneous fat reduction through cellular apoptosis. The ZELTIQ 
CoolSculpting System is cleared for use in the [LOCATION_002] for the indication of cold-
assisted lipolysis of various body areas, including the abdomen, flanks, thighs, submental and 
submandibular areas, back fat, bra fat, and banana roll. It has been clinically proven to reduce 
fat bulges, allowing patients to achieve noticeable and measurable aesthetic results without 
the pain, expense, downtime, and risks associated with existing invasive and minimally-
invasive procedures. 
In response to physician feedback, ZELTIQ Aesthetics has explored other non-invasive 
aesthetic treatment technologies and modalities to enhance and/or improve the contouring 
effects of the CoolSculpting treatment.  
One treatment of interest is the use of magnetic muscle stimulation (MMS) as an adjunct to 
CoolSculpting treatment and/or as a standalone procedure.  Electrical muscle stimulation, 
also known as neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is the elicitation of muscle 
contraction using electric impulses. The impulses mimic the action potential that comes from 
thecentral nervous system, causing the muscles to contract. [1]

of ZELTIQ.NMES devices are frequently used in physical therapy or rehabilitation settings to strengthen 
and tone muscles damaged by [CONTACT_914785], but they may also be used for other 
purposes. [2] High intensity magnetic muscle stimulation devices (MMS) can elicit stronger, 
more effective muscle contractions believed to increase muscle strength and endurance. 
MMS has received an increasing amount of attention in the last few years from fitness 
enthusiasts as various manufacturers promote the technology for muscle strengthening, 
firming and improvement in muscle tone specifically, in the abdomen, buttocks and thighs. [3]
  
Regulatory Status
The MMS devices that will be used in the proposed evaluation, such as the EmFieldPro 
(K182963) [CoolTone prototype], are non-significant risk devices that are FDA -cleared for 
the indications of improvement in abdominal tone, strengthening of abdominal muscles and 
development of firmer abdomen.

of ZELTIQ.7. Statistical Methodology and Analyses
Primary Endpoints
The primary endpoints of the study are defined as follows: 
•Safety Endpoint: The frequency of device and procedure-related adverse 
events (AEs), including device-related serious adverse events (SADEs), will be summarized.
•Efficacy Endpoint: Change in subject perception of body shape as measured using the Body Satisfaction Scale (BSS) at the one-month post-final-treatment 
follow-up visit.  
Statistical Methods: Overall Plan
Data will be summarized based on the nature of the data. Dichotomous (e.g., gender, 
independent photographic review) and ordinal (e.g., Fitzpatrick Skin type) data will be tabulated by [CONTACT_17203]. The mean, standard deviation, maximum, and minimum will be tabulated for continuous data (e.g., age, fat thickness). The significance level will be two-sided 0.[ADDRESS_1285776] of all the treated participants with safety evaluation 
after the treatment.  This cohort should be identical to the As Treated (AT)cohort.  The safety data analyses will be performed based on the Safety Cohort.

Two groups of subjects will be identified for the analysis of effectiveness 
endpoints:  Per Protocol Cohort and the As Treated Cohort.  All analyses of 
effectiveness will be performed on each cohort of subjects.  However, study 
success will be based on the Per Protocol Cohort of subjects.  
 
Per-protocol Cohort (PP):  
The Per -protocol Population will consist of all the treated subjects followed 
through to the one-month post-final treatment visit and with weight change 
of no more than five percent at the time the final post -treatment visit images 
are taken. Since a weight change of more than [ADDRESS_1285777] the 
images, the primary efficacy analysis will be performed based on this study 
population. Subjects who do not complete the treatment or ha ve an 
incomplete  treatment will not be included in the primary and secondary 
efficacy analyses  
 
As-Treated Cohort (AT):  
This cohort consists of all participant s who received initiation of at least one 
treatment, regardless of whether they become pregnant or undergo weight 
change during the study.   
 
7.3.3.  Endpoint Analysis  
Primary Safety Endpoint   
The primary safety endpoint will be t he frequency of device  and procedure -
related adverse events (AEs) , including device -related serious adverse events 
(SADEs).  The number and percentage of subjects experiencing each AE will 
be descriptively summarized. Adverse events and SAEs will be presented as 
summary tables showing the frequency and type of events.  
 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study will measure subject perception 
of body shape, assessed using the Body Satisfaction Questionnaire at the 1 -
Month follow -up visit.   The scale measures body image using a set of ten 
dichot omous items used to describe aspects of shape and appearance. The 
items are rated on a five -point semantic differential scale. Mean scores will 
be tabulated. Differences and percentage change from baseline at the 1-
Month follow -up visit will be determined.

In general, no imputation for missing data will be made. Data will be 
analyzed “as -is” where subjects with missing data not being included in the 
analysis.  
7.3.5.  Data Pooling   
Data are assumed to be poolable across sites due to: 1) use of  the same study 
protocol, 2) equivalent training of all sites in the study protocol and use of 
the investigational device, 3) use of the same CRF at each site, and 4) use of 
Independent Evaluator (s).  
  
 
 
 
 
 
8. Adverse Events  
Adverse events (AE) will be collected and assessed continuously throughout 
the study. An AE is defined in accordance with ISO [ADDRESS_1285778] clinical signs 
(including abnormal laboratory findings) in study participants, users, or other 
persons temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not 
considered related to the study treatment.  
Disease signs and symptoms that existed prior to the study treatment are not 
considered AEs unless the condition recurs after the patient has recovered 
from the pre -existing condition or the condition worsens in intensity or 
frequency during the study.  
Adverse event s will be monitored throughout the study beginning with signing 
of informed consent. At each post -baseline visit, the investigator will begin 
querying for AEs by [CONTACT_229298] a general, non -directed question such 
as “Have you had any changes to your con dition since your last visit?” 
Previous AEs and changes in therapy/concomitant medications are to be 
updated. Directed questioning and examination will then be done as

will be documented on the appropriate CRF.
Adverse events will be reported by [CONTACT_2299] (or, when appropriate, by a 
caregiver, surrogate, or the participant's legally authorized representative). The 
investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, collecting and
recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain 
responsible for following up AEs that are serious, considered related to the 
study treatment or study procedures, or that caused the participant to 
discontinue the study until the event has resolved or until [ADDRESS_1285779] (ADE)
Any sign, symptom, or disease in a study subject that occurs during the 
course of a clinical trial that is determined by [CONTACT_95334] a 
causal relationship or possible causal relationship with the device under 
investigation. This definition includes any AE s resulting from insufficient or 
inadequate instructions for use, deployment, implantation, installation, or 
operation, or any malfunction of the investigational medical device as well as 
any event resulting from use error (per ISO [ZIP_CODE]) or from intentional 
misuse of the investigational medical device.
8.1.1. Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE)
A serious adverse device effect (SADE) is defined in 
accordance with ISO [ZIP_CODE] as “an adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the consequences characteristic of a 
serious adverse event.”
8.1.2. Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect ([LOCATION_003]DE)
An unanticipated serious adverse device effect ([LOCATION_003]DE) i s 
defined in accordance with ISO [ZIP_CODE] as “any serious adverse 
device effect which by [CONTACT_5942], incidence, severity, or 
outcome has not been identified in the current version of the 
risk analysis report.” The investigator is to consult the IFU for 
anticipated risks or anticipated AEs.

An SAE is defined in accordance with ISO [ZIP_CODE] as an AE that:  
1. Led to death  
2. Led to serious deterioration in the health of the 
patient, that either resulted  in: 
a. a life -threatening illness or injury,  or 
b. a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function,  or 
c. inpatient or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  or 
d. medical or surgical intervention to prevent life -
threatening illness or injury or permanent impairment 
to a body structure or a body  function, or 
e. led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital 
abnormality or  birth defect  
NOTE: Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre -existing condition, 
or a procedure required by [CONTACT_760], without serious 
deterioration in health, is not considered an SAE.  
8.1.4.  Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information  
All AEs and SAEs from the signing of the I nformed Consent Form (ICF)  
until the last follow -up visit will be collected at the time  points specified in 
the schedule of activities, and as observed or reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_103607].  
Medical occurrences that begin after signing of informed consent and before 
administration of study treatment will be recorded as an AE on the 
appropriate CRF.  
All SAEs will be recorded and submitted to the Sponsor or designee within 
24 hours of learning about the event using the SAE form . All non -serious 
AEs related to the devices used in the study, as well as Device Complaints, 
will be submitted to the Sponsor within 7 working days. The investigator will 
submit any updates on these events to the Sponsor within 24 hours of it being 
available.  
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AE or SAE in former study 
participants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a 
death, at any  time after a participant has completed the final visit of the 
study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study 
treatment or study participation, the investigator must promptly report the 
event to the Sponsor.

Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. 
Open -ended and non -leading verbal questioning of the participant is the 
preferred method to inquire about possible AEs.  
8.1.6.  Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
After the initial AE/SA E report, the investigator is required to proactively 
follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs will be 
followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained , the 
participant is lost to follow -up or until [ADDRESS_1285780] of 
supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as 
requested by [CONTACT_29551]/or causality of the AE or 
SAE as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or 
investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other 
health care professionals.  
New or updated information will be recorded in the originally 
completed CRF.  
The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the 
Sponsor within 24 hours of receipt of the information.  
8.1.7.  Reportable Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
Serious adverse events (SAEs  and SADEs ) as well as  unanticipated adverse 
device effects (UADEs) must be reported within [ADDRESS_1285781] be reported to the Sponsor within 
24 hours.

This document and the contents hereof  are considered proprietary and confidential information of ZELTIQ Aesthetics, 
Inc.  Disclosure to unauthorized individuals or dissemination, publication or copying is prohibit ed without prior written consent 
of ZELTIQ.    If an event is classified as an SADE or a UADE, the Sponsor will determine 
if there is an unreasonable risk to the patients within the study.  In the event a 
UADE is reported during this study, it will be reported to the IRB and to the 
regulatory agencies as appropriate according to the relevant standard 
operating procedures and law of the country where the tria l is performed.   
8.1.8.  Assessment of Severity  
Severity of adverse events will be determined using the following 
scale:  
• Mild : Event  that is easily  tolerated  and may require  only 
minimal  treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does 
not generally interfere with usual activities of daily  living.  
• Moderate : Events  that interfere  with usual  activities  of daily  
living,  causing discomfort but poses no significant or 
permanent risk of harm to the research participant. It is 
usually alleviated with additio nal specific therapeutic  
intervention.  
• Severe : Event that is incapacitating, with inability to work 
and do the usual activities of daily living, or significantly 
affects clinical status. This may require intensive therapeutic 
intervention.  
8.1.9.  Assessment of Relatedness  
• The investigator  is obligated  to assess  the relationship  between  
study  treatment  and each occurrence of each  AE/SAE.  
• A reasonable possibility of a relationship conveys that there 
are facts, evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causal 
relationship, rather than a relationship  cannot be ruled out.  
• The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the  relatedness . 
• Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant 
therapy, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal 
relationship of the event to study treatment administration will 
be considered and  investigated.  
• The investigator will also consult the investigator’s brochure 
and/or product information, for marketed products, in his/her  
assessment.

This document and the contents hereof  are considered proprietary and confidential information of ZELTIQ Aesthetics, 
Inc.  Disclosure to unauthorized individuals or dissemination, publication or copying is prohibit ed without prior written consent 
of ZELTIQ.    • For each AE/SAE,  the investigator  must  document  in the 
medical  notes  that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has 
provided an assessment of  relatedness . 
• For each AE/SAE,  there are 4 levels of relatedness , as follows:  
• Not related  
• Possible  
• Probable  
• Definite  relationship  
There may  be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator 
has minimal information to include in the initial report to the Sponsor. 
However, it is very important that the investigator always  make an 
assessment of relatedness  for every event before th e initial transmission of 
the SAE data to the  Sponsor.  
• The investigator may cha nge his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_914783] -up information and send an SAE follow -up 
report with the updated relatedness  assessment.  
• The relatedness  assessment is one of the criteria used when 
determining  regulatory reporting  requirements.  
 
The investigator will determine the relationship of each adverse event to the 
study  device using the question: "Is there a reasonable possibility that t he 
event ma y be related to  treatment with the device ? Answer 'yes' or 'no' for 
each adverse event."  
The guideline below should be used to consider relatedness:  
For a “not related ” assessment, the adverse event:  
• May be judged to be due to extraneous causes such 
as disease or environment or toxic  factors  
• May be judged to be due to the subject's clinical state or 
other therapy being  administered  
• Is not biologically  plausible  
• Does not reappear or worsen when the investigational

• Does not follow a temporal sequence from treatment with 
the investigational device ,  
For an assessment of relatedness  (including, probable and 
possible assessments) there is a reasonable possibility that the 
event may have been caused by [CONTACT_14882], t he 
adverse event:  
• Follows a temporal sequence from treatment with the 
device.   
• Is a known response to the device  based on clinical or 
nonclinical  data 
• Could not be explained by [CONTACT_78456]'s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other 
therapy  administered  
• Disappears or decreases upon cessation of the use 
of the device .   
• Reappears or worsens when the device  is re-
administered.  
8.1.10.  Serious Adverse Event Reporting Procedures  
All serious adverse events must be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours  of 
discovery or notification of the event and according to IEC/IRB requirements 
and the institution  at which  the study  is conducted,  if applicable.  Serious  
adverse  event  information and any follow -up information will be recorded on 
a Serious Adverse Event  Form and transmitted to the Sponsor using the 
contact [CONTACT_229299]. Note that for each device used 
in this study, a separate SAE form and contact [CONTACT_3031] w ill be used.  The 
Sponsor is responsible for evaluating and reporting any  serious adverse event 
and unexpected serious adverse reactions in accordance with all applicable 
laws and standards.

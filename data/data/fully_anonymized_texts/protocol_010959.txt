3 2.0 STUDY SYNOPSIS 
 Study Objectives 
Objective: Through CTN-0076-Ot (Clinical Decision 
Support for Opi[INVESTIGATOR_362460]: 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_360244] (COMPUTE)), our team 
has iteratively developed and pi[INVESTIGATOR_31219] a web-based and 
electronic health record (EHR)-integrated Opi[INVESTIGATOR_338665] (OUD) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system 
to offer expert guidance to primary care providers (PCPs) 
on the diagnosis and management of OUD. The OUD-
CDS has been implemented within the EPIC EHR of one 
large care system and was pi[INVESTIGATOR_60528] [ADDRESS_451579] on practice process measures and patient 
outcomes. We also aim to prepare for scalability (i.e., 
integration into usual primary care practice after the study 
is complete) and dissemination by [CONTACT_362516], determining the costs of 
implementation and maintenance, and assessing the 
short-term cost impacts of the OUD-CDS. 
The study will include three large diverse care systems 
and randomize a minimum of 30 clinics to receive the 
OUD-CDS intervention or usual care (UC). In intervention 
clinics, the OUD-CDS will identify patients who are at 
high risk for OUD or diagnosed with OUD; use data 
stored in the EHR for each eligible patient to assemble 
treatment recommendations tailored to each patient’s 
current needs; display these recommendations to PCPs via the OUD-CDS user interface; and 
store analytic data from all targeted visits. In UC clinics, the OUD-CDS will run invisibly in the 
background to identify high-risk or OUD patients, assemble treatment recommendations tailored 
to each eligible patient’s needs, and store analytic data from all targeted visits. 
Specific Aims: 
Aim 1. To implement OUD CDS in primary care settings and assess its impact on process 
measures related to diagnosis of patients at high risk for OUD, as well as prescription of 
naloxone for patients at high risk for or diagnosed with OUD.  
H1.1: Patients previously undiagnosed with OUD but identified as high risk by [CONTACT_46251]-CDS 
at an index visit will be more likely to receive an OUD diagnosis (in the problem list or as an 
International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) visit code) in intervention 
clinics than in UC clinics within [ADDRESS_451580]-index. Definitions

4 H1.2: Patients previously diagnosed with OUD or identified as high risk by [CONTACT_46251]-CDS at 
an index visit will be more likely to have naloxone rescue kits ordered in the intervention clinics 
than in the UC clinics within [ADDRESS_451581] of OUD-CDS on important patient outcomes of initiation and 
maintenance of Medications for Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2442] (MOUD) in patients identified as 
having OUD or being at high risk for OUD.  
H2.1: Patients identified as having OUD or as being at high-risk for OUD by [CONTACT_46251]-CDS at 
an index visit will be more likely to have MOUD orders or referral for OUD treatment within [ADDRESS_451582]-index in intervention clinics than in UC clinics. 
H2.2: Patients identified as having OUD or as being at high-risk for OUD by [CONTACT_46251]-CDS at 
an index visit will have significantly more days covered by a MOUD prescription at [ADDRESS_451583] of OUD CDS on important patient outcomes in 
patients with OUD or identified as high risk for OUD. 
H3.1: Patients with OUD or identified as high-risk for OUD by [CONTACT_46251]-CDS who are cared 
for in intervention clinics will have significantly fewer post-index emergency department (ED) 
visits during the observation period (i.e., the period between each patient’s index date and 
last observation) compared to patients cared for in UC clinics. 
H3.2: Patients with OUD or identified as high-risk for OUD by [CONTACT_46251]-CDS who are cared 
for in intervention clinics will have significantly fewer post-index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_362461]. 
Aim 4. To describe and quantify costs of OUD-CDS implementation and maintenance and 
the short-term cost impacts of the OUD-CDS. 
H4.1: After controlling for demographics, baseline clinical status and prior costs of care, 
patients with OUD or identified as high risk for OUD by [CONTACT_46251]-CDS will have lower 
healthcare costs in intervention compared to UC clinics during the observation period (i.e., 
savings from lower ED visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_362462]-CDS implementation and maintenance). 
Aim 5. To use mixed quantitative and qualitative methods to identify, describe and quantify 
barriers and facilitators to implementation of the OUD-CDS so that it can be adapted to 
maximize its use and effectiveness. 
Secondary Analyses:  As secondary outcomes, we may assess whether patients with OUD or 
identified as high risk for OUD by [CONTACT_46251]-CDS who are cared for in intervention clinics have 
lower post-index rates of all cause death and of fatal or non-fatal opi[INVESTIGATOR_362463]. We will also assess OUD-CDS use 
rates for intervention clinics and assess whether the effectiveness of OUD-CDS varies as a 
function of site, clinic, provider or patient characteristics. Finally, we will assess whether PCP 
ratings of confidence in treating patients with OUD differ at 9 months between treatment groups, 
and how intervention PCPs rate satisfaction and acceptability of the OUD-CDS tool at 9 months.

5 Exploratory Analyses: In exploratory analyses, we will assess whether (a) PCPs in intervention 
clinics who are non-waivered at go-live dates are more likely to become buprenorphine-waivered 
than PCPs in UC clinics during the intervention period; (b) waivered PCPs in intervention clinics 
are more likely to prescribe buprenorphine than PCPs in UC clinics during the intervention period; 
(c) whether PCPs in intervention clinics who are non-waivered at go-live dates are reportedly 
more likely to prescribe buprenorphine should a waiver no longer be required than PCPs in UC 
clinics measured prior to go-live dates and at 9 months following go-live dates; (d) if we have 
adequate data, potentially via health plan or Surescripts data, whether adherence/persistence to 
methadone, buprenorphine, XR-NTX or therapy for patients with OUD differs for patients in 
intervention vs. UC clinics during the observation period; and (e) PCPs in intervention clinics are 
more likely to screen their patients for mental health conditions and infectious diseases than PCPs 
in UC clinics during the intervention period. 
Notes: The COVID-19 pandemic has delayed implementation, and these impacts to date are 
reflected in the updated timeline (Section 7.2). HealthPartners vanguard clinic sites went live on 
February 3, 2021; and remaining randomized clinics went live on April 7, 2021. The vanguard 
clinic site at Geisinger is anticipated to go live in November 2021, with remaining sites anticipated 
to be operational in December [ADDRESS_451584], 3UG1DA040316-06S3 (aka CTN-0095-A-1), is a cluster-randomized 
trial that randomizes half of COMPUTE intervention clinics to receive decision support aimed at 
suicide prevention. The second, 3UG1DA040316-06S4 (aka CTN-0095-A-2), is a clinician-
randomized trial of an intervention aimed at reducing OUD stigma for PCPs. Separate protocols 
for each supplemental application reference this protocol.  
 Study Design and Outcomes 
In this multicenter clinic-randomized pragmatic trial, clinics will be randomized 1:1 to OUD-CDS 
or to UC within each healthcare system. To encourage a larger number of buprenorphine-
waivered PCPs in both intervention and UC clinics, we may offer financial incentives to become 
waivered. 
Primary outcome measures will include: 
1. OUD diagnosis (in the problem list or as an ICD-10 visit code) within 30 days of index 
visit for patients identified by [CONTACT_46251]-CDS as being at high risk of OUD 
2. Naloxone prescription within 30 days of index visit for patients with OUD or identified by 
[CONTACT_46251]-CDS as being at high risk for OUD 
3. MOUD orders or referral to OUD treatment within 30 days of index visit for patients with 
OUD or identified by [CONTACT_46251]-CDS as being at high risk for OUD 
4. Total days covered by [CONTACT_362517] 90 days after index visit for patients 
with OUD or identified by [CONTACT_46251]-CDS as being at high risk for OUD 
Secondary outcome measures  will include:

Other outcome variables  will include: 
1. Number of non-waivered PCPs becoming buprenorphine waivered during the 
intervention period, assessed via health system administrative data 
2. Number of buprenorphine prescriptions written by [CONTACT_362518] 
3. PCP ratings of likelihood to prescribe buprenorphine for patients with OUD, should no 
waiver be required, measured prior to go-live dates and at 9-months following go-live 
dates 
4. Adherence to therapy during the observation period, assessed via Clarity and claims 
data 
5. Number of patients diagnosed with OUD screened for mental health comorbidities and 
infectious diseases during the observation period 
 Sample Size and Study Population 
The study will be conducted at a minimum of 30 primary care clinics within 3 healthcare systems 
in the [LOCATION_002] that are geographically dispersed and will include a racially, ethnically and 
socioeconomically diverse population. Clinics will be randomized equally within each care system 
and balanced on pre-randomization outcomes, such as the percentage of patients at high-risk or 
with diagnosed OUD, and on clinic characteristics that may enhance or impede intervention 
uptake and adherence, such as the number of buprenorphine-waivered PCPs (see Section 10.2 ). 
PCPs who practice at randomized clinics will be asked to complete pre-and post-implementation 
surveys assessing their comfort and confidence treating patients with OUD. Primary and 
secondary outcomes data will be collected from the EHR or CDS tool for each patient with an 
NIDA CTN-[ADDRESS_451586] surveys 
with patients and interviews with PCPs, clinic staff, clinic leaders and patients to understand their 
perceptions of the acceptability of OUD treatment in primary care and their impressions of the 
OUD-CDS to help improve the implementation and uptake of the OUD-CDS. 
 Treatment/Assessment/Intervention and Duration 
The OUD-CDS provides clinical guidance to PCPs in the screening, diagnosis and treatment of 
OUD, along with common comorbid conditions, and will display for patients with OUD or at high 
risk for OUD in intervention primary care clinics during each site’s intervention period (see 
timeline). PCPs are also able to access the OUD-CDS in EPIC for patient encounters for which it 
did not display (e.g., new patient visits). Patient follow-up time from the date of index visit is 
estimated to range from [ADDRESS_451587] 
of care in OUD treatment. PCPs will be trained that, as with other clinical decision tools, the OUD-
CDS is meant to supplement but not supersede clinical judgment. PCPs will be able to choose to 
follow or to not follow the guidance of the CDS at any given time for any given patient. PCPs will 
be asked to use the Feedback Tab within the tool to let the team know of questions or potential 
errors in the CDS. Additionally, PCPs will be trained to let the research team know via the 
Feedback Tab when their clinical judgment is inconsistent with the CDS. This feedback will be 
monitored by [CONTACT_360296]. 
An independent Clinical Trials Network (CTN) Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will 
monitor this study. Tables will summarize, by [CONTACT_362519], (a) number of 
patients, index visits and eligible clinic encounters during the intervention period; (b) rates of OUD-
CDS use in intervention clinics; (c) baseline clinic and patient characteristics; and (d) safety 
measures (overdose rates, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14285], ED visit rates, content of PCP feedback via 
Feedback Tab and any actions taken in response). Reports will be provided to the DSMB at a 
frequency the DSMB requests. The CTN DSMB will be responsible for conducting periodic 
reviews of accumulating study data. The CTN DSMB will provide an opi[INVESTIGATOR_362465], evidence that study procedures should be changed, or 
evidence that the trial should be halted for any reason, such as the safety of study participants, 
the efficacy of the treatment under study or inadequate trial performance. 
 Analyses 
Aims 1 through 3 pertain to the effectiveness of the OUD-CDS intervention relative to UC, 
predicting that it will increase diagnosis, naloxone prescribing, and access to MOUD, and

8 decrease ED visits and inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7959]. These hypotheses will be tested using 
generalized linear mixed models to account for clustering of outcomes within eligible patients and 
randomized clinics or generalized estimating equations to compare event rates across clinics. 
Outcomes will be normalized via distribution-appropriate link functions (e.g., logistic-Normal, 
Poisson-Normal). Clinic-randomized treatment group, care system and other predictors will be 
treated as fixed effects. 
For Aim 4, OUD-CDS implementation and maintenance costs will include programming, training 
and ongoing algorithm maintenance but exclude research costs, using micro-cost accounting 
methods and nationally-representative pricing of inputs. A generalized linear model, allowing 
clustering by [CONTACT_362520], will estimate 
costs by [CONTACT_362521].[1-3] Economic analyses will 
be done in consultation with the NIDA P-30 CHERISH program. 
The Aim 5 mixed methods analysis will include an iterative, team-based, triangulation of 
quantitative and qualitative data sources. Qualitative analysis of the field notes, observations and 
interviews will be conducted using techniques of qualitative content analysis based on a 
deductive-directed approach to evaluate the factors influencing RE-AIM constructs.[4]

NIDA CTN-[ADDRESS_451588] of an opi[INVESTIGATOR_15817].[5] More than 72,000 
people in the US died from drug overdoses in 2017, including illicit and prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].[6] 
Approximately 20% of patients diagnosed with OUD seek treatment, but only 25% of those 
receive MOUD.[7] Primary care is the most common point of healthcare contact [CONTACT_362524]. Buprenorphine and monthly injections 
of XR-NTX show promise for OUD treatment in primary care.[8-14] Over 50,000 physicians are 
waivered to prescribe buprenorphine, but only 14,000 (28%) do.[15] Providers identify time 
constraints, poor access to clinical guidelines, and lack of institutional support, staff training and 
confidence as barriers to using buprenorphine.[15-18] Similar barriers limit the use of XR-NTX.[19] 
In the last decade, EHR-linked web-based point-of-care CDS systems designed to improve quality 
of chronic disease care have become increasingly sophisticated and successful [20-22]. Our 
team has developed a CDS system that improves glucose and blood pressure control in adults 
with diabetes, reduces 10-year cardiovascular risk in high risk patients, and increases recognition 
of adolescents with hypertension in clinic-randomized trials. [23-27] Use rates of the CDS system 
remain high at 70-80% of targeted encounters, and the CDS tools have obtained 95% PCP 
satisfaction ratings. This web-based CDS system is designed for scalability, is used by 4 large 
health care systems serving approximately 2 million patients and has recently been implemented 
through a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) grant at 60 federally health care 
qualified centers in 10 states. 
Prior Work. Through CTN-0076-Ot, we pi[INVESTIGATOR_31219] a CDS tool that supports the diagnosis and 
treatment of OUD in primary care at HealthPartners. A total of 55 enrolled PCPs included 8 of our 
11 buprenorphine-waivered MDs, 24 non-waivered medical doctors (MDs), and 22 non-waivered 
advanced practice PCPs. The OUD-CDS tool translates the NIDA CTN Blending Initiative White 
Paper [unpublished] into web-based algorithms that identify patients at high risk for OUD and 
provides a usable and intuitive interface that guides PCPs through OUD management and 
referrals, when indicated. The OUD-CDS tool links to the prescription drug monitoring database. 
It uses the Tobacco, Alcohol, Prescription medication and Substance Use (TAPS) tool [28] to 
screen patients for OUD and prompts use of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) [29] diagnostic criteria for patients with positive TAPS screens. 
Next, the treatment selection module alerts PCPs to any relative contraindications to certain 
MOUDs, and guides prescription of MOUDs or referral for OUD treatment, as appropriate. It 
provides patient educational materials, including a one-page summary of MOUDs, as well as 
detailed MOUD-specific handouts. The final module prompts screening for common 
comorbidities, such as infectious diseases and mental health conditions, and includes 
recommendations to bring vaccinations up-to-date. All modules contain active guidelines that 
make it easy to order recommended labs, medications and referrals by [CONTACT_362525], saving the PCP time and clicks. The orders are then reviewed within the EHR prior to signing. 
In CTN 0076-Ot, use rates were disappointingly low, in that PCPs used the OUD-CDS in 5% of 
eligible encounters with patients identified at high risk. PCPs reported that barriers to use included 
not seeing the alert banner in EPIC, not feeling they had enough time to address opi[INVESTIGATOR_362466], or

11 feeling OUD was a low priority for the patient or that the PCP could tell who was at risk for OUD. 
This PCP feedback has been instrumental in our planning for this trial, as it gives us actionable 
steps to take to improve use rates of the OUD-CDS, which we outline in Section 8.5 (Strategies 
for Recruitment and Retention) . One key change in the larger study will be to have multiple 
alerts to the care team that a patient has been identified as high risk and that use of the OUD-
CDS is recommended, including alerts to the rooming staff. In prior work, this has substantially 
improved uptake of the CDS tool. 
In surveys, 66% of intervention PCPs (21 of 32 PCPs) and 
75% of waivered intervention PCPs (6 of 8 PCPs) were 
moderately or very likely to recommend the tool to 
colleagues. In all, 89% of PCPs thought the OUD-CDS 
helped them screen for OUD, 86% felt the tool made them 
feel more comfortable in prescribing MOUDs, 93% felt the 
tool made it easier to discuss treatment options with 
patients, 93% felt the tool helped them know when to refer 
patients, and 82% felt the tool saved them time. 
Intervention PCPs (both waivered and non-waivered) 
reported increased confidence in screening for OUD after 
the intervention on 4-point Likert scales (Figure 1), while 
only non-waivered PCPs saw a significant increase in 
confidence in diagnosing OUD by [CONTACT_124808] 
(Figure 2). None of the PCPs reported a significant 
increase in treating OUD by [CONTACT_124808] (Figure 3). 
Early feedback from the COMPUTE 1.0 pi[INVESTIGATOR_362467], such as considering use of other 
care opportunities (e.g., telephone encounters where 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_362468]; annual 
renewal of opi[INVESTIGATOR_362469]), involving rooming 
staff in the screening process, changing the type of EHR 
alert, and simplifying the user interface. We will 
incorporate these changes in COMPUTE 2.0 as detailed 
in Section 8.5 , as well as provide clinic- and PCP-specific 
use rates to clinic leadership, which in prior work has 
increased use rates to 70-80% of eligible encounters.[30] 
Summary of Study Design. The proposed study will include 3 large diverse healthcare systems 
and randomize a minimum of 30 clinics equally within each system to receive the OUD-CDS 
intervention or UC. In intervention and UC clinics, the OUD-CDS will identify study-eligible 
patients, those who are at high risk for OUD or diagnosed with OUD; and will use data stored in 
the EHR to assemble treatment recommendations tailored to the needs of each study-eligible 
patient. In intervention clinics, these treatment recommendations will be displayed via the OUD-
CDS user interface. Finally, data from all targeted visits in all randomized clinics will be stored in 
a data repository for analysis and reporting needs. The targeted visits for each study-eligible 

NIDA CTN-[ADDRESS_451589] lower healthcare costs. We hypothesize that qualitative data will help to identify barriers and 
facilitators to implementation and propose steps to mitigate barriers. 
Mixed Methods Approach. Virtually every evidence-based intervention in medicine has turned 
out to be difficult to implement and maintain in real life practice and to fall far short of fidelity to 
the process used in randomized trials.[31, 32] As a result, a whole new field of dissemination and 
implementation research has been developi[INVESTIGATOR_362470] [ADDRESS_451590] now 
gone well beyond the previous paradigm of focusing on changing the attitudes and behaviors of 
individual physicians to a growing awareness that the need instead is to alter the environment in 
which physicians work so that it is easier to do the desired evidence-based thing than to stick with 
old established habit patterns.[33] That means focusing change efforts on organizational factors 
and practice systems. The Solberg conceptual framework has proven to be particularly helpful in 
clarifying this new approach.[34] 
Simultaneously, there has been increasing interest in transitioning effectiveness clinical trials from 
traditionally highly selective and controlled circumstances to pragmatic trials that make use of 
normal care delivery processes and patients.[35] The measurement of such trials has been 
facilitated by [CONTACT_66867] a conceptual framework called RE-AIM, an acronym for 5 key 
facets of such studies – Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance.[36, 
37] Recently, the developers of RE-AIM have recognized the need for more flexible use of this 
framework, greater use of qualitative methods to understand why interventions are not used 
consistently, and making adaptations in the implementation approach based on such 
understandings.[38-41] We propose to use the RE-AIM framework to guide (1) a monitoring 
system for intervention problems, (2) a mixed methods evaluation of the reasons for those 
problems, and (3) modification of the intervention to reduce those problems. These steps will be 
reiterated in a cyclic fashion, resulting in a more sophisticated approach to the long-standing 
quality improvement emphasis on Plan-Do-Study-Act rapid cycle tests of change.[42, 43] 
Furthermore, we will take advantage of the staggered implementation of the study through three 
different care systems to ensure that the solutions for intervention problems in Site 1 are not 
assumed to be the same as the approach in subsequent sites without further RE-AIM monitoring 
and evaluation.  
Potential Risks and Benefits.  There is a small but important risk that the OUD-CDS could 
provide the wrong treatment advice at the wrong time. As with other clinical decision tools, the 
OUD-CDS makes suggestions for patient care that are meant to supplement but not supersede 
clinical judgment. PCPs can choose to follow or not follow the guidance of the CDS at any given

Confidential  
13 time in any given patient encounter. PCPs will be trained to let the research team know via the 
Feedback Tab in the CDS when their clinical judgment leads them to a different action than that 
suggested by [CONTACT_46255]. These events will be monitored in real time by [CONTACT_362526]. Every clinical encounter requires 
medical judgment and poses some element of risk to patients. In the situation of a PCP who is 
unfamiliar or uncomfortable with OUD, use of the CDS will likely make care safer by [CONTACT_362527], and to encourage referrals when 
patients are classified as high risk. We will not be encouraging buprenorphine use in non-certified 
providers, and this will be reinforced in PCP training on the CDS. For buprenorphine-certified 
providers, the use of the CDS may improve the likelihood of using MOUD in high-risk situations; 
however, the risks of MOUD are generally considered lower than untreated OUD in high-risk 
situations. This is a minimal risk study and the risk to a patient who is not receiving MOUD greatly 
exceeds the risk of the CDS intervention. Overall, the potential benefits of providing the OUD-
CDS to intervention clinics, which include the ability to improve the identification of patients at-
risk for OUD, to guide screening and diagnosis of OUD, and to guide treatment selection and 
prescription of MOUDs or referrals for people with OUD, ultimately increasing access to OUD 
treatment for patients with OUD in primary care, outweigh the potential risks outlined above.  
NIDA CTN-[ADDRESS_451591] 30 primary care clinics across three healthcare systems.  
Specific Aims: 
Aim 1. To implement OUD CDS in primary care settings and assess its impact on process 
measures related to diagnosis of patients at high risk for OUD, as well as prescription of 
naloxone for patients at high risk for or diagnosed with OUD.  
H1.1: Patients previously undiagnosed with OUD but identified as high risk by [CONTACT_46251]-CDS 
at an index visit will be more likely to receive an OUD diagnosis (in the problem list or as an 
ICD-10 visit code) in intervention clinics than in UC clinics within [ADDRESS_451592]-index. 
H1.2: Patients previously diagnosed with OUD or identified as high risk by [CONTACT_46251]-CDS at 
an index visit will be more likely to have naloxone rescue kits ordered in the intervention clinics 
than in the UC clinics within [ADDRESS_451593] of OUD-CDS on important patient outcomes of initiation and 
maintenance of Medications for Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2442] (MOUD) in patients identified as 
having OUD or being at high risk for OUD.  
H2.1: Patients identified as having OUD or as being at high-risk for OUD by [CONTACT_46251]-CDS at 
an index visit will be more likely to have MOUD orders or referral for OUD treatment within [ADDRESS_451594]-index in intervention clinics than in UC clinics. 
H2.2: Patients identified as having OUD or as being at high-risk for OUD by [CONTACT_46251]-CDS at 
an index visit will have significantly more days covered by a MOUD prescription at [ADDRESS_451595] of OUD CDS on important patient outcomes in 
patients with OUD or identified as high risk for OUD. 
H3.1: Patients with OUD or identified as high-risk for OUD by [CONTACT_46251]-CDS who are cared 
for in intervention clinics will have significantly fewer post-index ED visits during the 
observation period (i.e., the period between each patient’s index date and last observation) 
compared to patients cared for in UC clinics. 
H3.2: Patients with OUD or identified as high-risk for OUD by [CONTACT_46251]-CDS who are cared 
for in intervention clinics will have significantly fewer post-index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_362461]. 
Aim 4. To describe and quantify costs of OUD-CDS implementation and maintenance and 
the short-term cost impacts of the OUD-CDS. 
NIDA CTN-0095  Version 6.0  
 COMPUTE 2.0  March 31, 2023  
 
Confidential  
15 H4.1: After controlling for demographics, baseline clinical status and prior costs of care, 
patients with OUD or identified as high risk for OUD by [CONTACT_46251]-CDS will have lower 
healthcare costs in intervention compared to UC clinics during the observation period (i.e., 
savings from lower ED visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_362462]-CDS implementation and maintenance). 
Aim 5. To use mixed quantitative and qualitative methods to identify, describe and quantify 
barriers and facilitators to implementation of the OUD-CDS so that it can be adapted to 
maximize its use and effectiveness. 
 Secondary Objective(s) 
Among patients with OUD or identified as high-risk for OUD, we will assess secondary outcomes, 
which include whether those who are cared for in intervention clinics have lower rates of all-cause 
death and of fatal and non-fatal opi[INVESTIGATOR_362471]. 
Treatment effectiveness may vary as a function of contextual as well as patient factors. In 
secondary analyses, care system indicators (Site 1, Site 2, Site 3) and clinic characteristics (e.g., 
proportion of primary care patients eligible for OUD-CDS, proportion of clinic patients with 
government-sponsored insurance) may be added to the primary model as main effects and in 
interaction with the treatment group indicator to assess treatment heterogeneity due to contextual 
factors. Patient characteristics (e.g., race, ethnicity, age, estimated neighborhood income and 
education, documented heroin vs. oral opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]) may be similarly added to the primary model 
to assess treatment heterogeneity due to patient factors. 
The OUD-CDS tool is hypothesized to improve process measures of appropriate care for patients 
at high risk for or diagnosed with OUD by [CONTACT_362528]. For each PCP 
who practices at an intervention clinic, we will assess the extent to which engagement with the 
OUD-CDS (e.g., opening or printing OUD-CDS recommendations, use of embedded screening 
tools) is associated with patient outcomes. Via surveys, we will also assess PCP ratings of 
confidence in treating OUD and their satisfaction with the OUD-CDS. 
 Exploratory Objective(s) 
In exploratory analyses, we may assess whether (a) PCPs in intervention clinics who are non-
waivered at go-live dates are more likely to become buprenorphine-waivered than PCPs in UC 
clinics during the intervention period; (b) waivered PCPs in intervention clinics are more likely to 
prescribe buprenorphine than PCPs in UC clinics during the intervention period; (c) whether PCPs 
in intervention clinics who are non-waivered at go-live dates are reportedly more likely to prescribe 
buprenorphine should a waiver no longer be required than PCPs in UC clinics measured prior to 
go-live dates and at 9 months following go-live dates; (d) if we have adequate data, potentially via 
health plan or Surescripts data, whether adherence/persistence to methadone, buprenorphine, 
XR-NTX or therapy for patients with OUD differs for patients in intervention vs. UC clinics during 
the observation period; and (e) PCPs in intervention clinics are more likely to screen their patients 
for mental health conditions and infectious diseases than PCPs in UC clinics during the 
intervention period. 
NIDA CTN-[ADDRESS_451596] 30 clinics will be randomized to receive 
the OUD-CDS intervention or UC. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_362529], with key pre-
randomization clinic measures balanced across treatment arms. Randomization in each 
healthcare system will be approximately 1:1. In intervention clinics, the OUD-CDS will identify 
patients who are at high risk for or previously diagnosed with OUD; use data stored in the EHR 
for these patients to assemble treatment recommendations tailored to the current needs of each 
patient; display these recommendations via the OUD-CDS user interface; and store analytic data 
from all targeted visits. In UC clinics, the OUD-CDS will run invisibly in the background to identify 
high-risk and OUD diagnosed patients, assemble treatment recommendations and store analytic 
data from all targeted visits. The targeted visits for each study-eligible patient in all randomized 
clinics will be the index visit, the first visit at which the OUD-CDS identifies that the patient is 
eligible, and all post-index visits through the end of the observation period. Patients who are 
identified as eligible during the accrual period and meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be 
considered for inclusion in the primary outcome analyses. Patient outcomes will be derived from 
the data elements stored by [CONTACT_46251]-CDS at all targeted visits. To the extent it is available, EHR 
data from the year prior to the index visit through the end of the observation period will be included 
in primary and secondary analyses. Process outcomes at or following the index visit (Aims 1 and 
2), and clinical outcomes following the index visit through the end of the observation period (Aim 
3), will be compared between patients cared for in intervention and UC clinics to assess the 
effectiveness of OUD-CDS. 
 Duration of Study and Visit Schedule 
Primary care clinics will be randomized within each health care system to receive or not receive 
access to the OUD-CDS. Once OUD-CDS is implemented in each health care system, its 
algorithms automatically identify eligible patients in all randomized intervention and UC clinics, 
independent of any PCP actions. PCPs in clinics with CDS access are anticipated to have access 
to the OUD-CDS intervention through May 2024, depending on factors such as healthcare system 
leader preference. In UC clinics, the OUD-CDS will run silently in the background over the same 
time period, collecting data without displaying. There is no study-determined visit schedule; rather, 
patient visits will be jointly determined by [CONTACT_362530]. We plan to stop collecting outcome 
data in October [ADDRESS_451597] of the OUD-CDS on OUD identification and 
care.

(a) be included in one of the three care delivery systems included in this study, (b) have a 
minimum of 3 full-time PCPs who do not regularly work at any other primary care clinic, and (c) 
have an estimated minimum of 50 adult patients who meet study criteria for OUD or high risk for 
OUD. Exclusion criteria for potentially eligible primary care clinics include (a) plans to close or 
transfer ownership of the clinic within 24 months after the anticipated OUD-CDS go-live date, or 
(b) clinic not using their current EHR system for at least [ADDRESS_451608] PCPs at clinic Z practice a day or two a week at clinics X and Y, 
clinics X, Y and Z would be randomized as one potential unit (thereby [CONTACT_362532]). 
Primary care clinics that pass all these eligibility and exclusion criteria will be randomized (within 
study site) using a validated computer-generated randomization scheme that takes into 
consideration such factors as overall clinic size, number of PCPs, number of buprenorphine 
PCPs, and baseline prevalence of diagnosed OUD. All PCPs and their study-eligible patients will 
be assigned to the treatment group of their randomized primary care clinic. 
 PCPs and Clinic Staff 
To be eligible for inclusion in this study, a PCP must be a family physician, general internist, or 
adult-care non-obstetric nurse practitioner (NP) or physician assistant (PA) working at a study-
eligible primary care clinic. PCPs who are and who are not buprenorphine-waivered are study 
eligible. PCPs in the intervention clinics will be encouraged but not required to use the OUD-CDS 
with eligible patients, so that the decision to use or not use OUD-CDS at a given clinical encounter 
is up the PCP at each clinical encounter. All PCPs will be asked to consent to and complete pre-
and post-implementation surveys and may receive modest compensation for completing these 
surveys. In the intervention phase, PCPs who are high-, moderate- and low/non-users of the 
OUD-CDS will be invited to participate in interviews. Clinic staff associated with invited PCPs 
(e.g., rooming staff, nurses) will also be invited to participate. PCPs and staff who are asked to 
participate in interviews will be consented for those interviews and may receive modest 
compensation. Exclusive of consenting PCPs for interviews and surveys, we will request a waiver 
of written informed consent for PCPs from the IRB for the intervention because (a) the OUD-CDS 
is based on current national standards of OUD identification and management and does not make 
any treatment recommendations that are not accepted as community standard of care, and (b) 
consenting PCPs would compromise the external validity of the study by [CONTACT_362533]. Measures to protect the privacy of PCPs participating in this study are described further 
NIDA CTN-[ADDRESS_451609] meet all the following eligibility criteria: (a) 
be aged 18-75 years, inclusive, at the time of an index visit; (b) have been diagnosed with OUD, 
currently prescribed MOUD, or identified by [CONTACT_362534]. There 
are no exclusions for pregnancy, lactation, or mental health or behavioral health issues. However, 
patients who meet the following criteria at the time of their index visit will be excluded and not be 
exposed to the OUD-CDS intervention: (a) those receiving active parenteral chemotherapy within 
the last year, (b) those with stage 4 or equivalent cancer diagnosis, (c) those enrolled in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_362472]. All women and members of racial or ethnic minority groups and 
their subpopulations who meet the above eligibility criteria and do not meet exclusion criteria will 
be included in accordance with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Policy on Inclusion of 
Women and Minorities as Participants in Research Involving Human Subjects. A sample of 
patients with diagnoses of OUD and/or identified as being at high risk for OUD and/or referred by 
a PCP will be invited to participate in interviews and surveys. Patients who are asked to complete 
surveys or participate in interviews will be consented and will receive modest compensation. 
Beyond survey and interview participation, we will request and anticipate receiving a waiver of 
written informed consent from the governing IRB for patient participation because the study is 
minimal or less than minimal risk compared to the risk associated with any primary care 
encounter, and because the study could not be conducted if written informed consent were 
required to be obtained in the context of busy community-based primary care clinic environments. 
We have requested and received such waivers of written informed consent for patients in several 
similar prior studies. Note that patients who have requested non-participation in research studies 
at any of the participating care delivery systems will be excluded from all analyses. 
Definition of High Risk: Algorithms determine when a patient is identified as being at high risk 
for OUD or opi[INVESTIGATOR_46211], and, in intervention clinics, this will trigger a best practice alert to be 
displayed for a particular patient at a particular clinic encounter. These algorithms, like all of the 
OUD-CDS algorithms, are housed on a web platform that interacts with the EHR to pull data 
elements to run risk equations and determine patient eligibility.  We anticipate that how the 
algorithms will identify patients at high risk of OUD or opi[INVESTIGATOR_362473]. In early phases of this study, we may use EHR data elements such 
as long-acting opi[INVESTIGATOR_75155], concomitant benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_362474], mental 
health diagnoses, alcohol and substance use diagnoses and previous opi[INVESTIGATOR_362475].[31] We may also use, in care 
systems where this is available, a risk equation developed and validated by [CONTACT_362535] 
a patient’s risk of OUD or opi[INVESTIGATOR_362476]. As the study progresses, we 
anticipate incorporating additional calculators for high risk into our algorithms. In work funded by 
[CONTACT_133312] (1R01DA047724-01, PI [INVESTIGATOR_362477]), we are developi[INVESTIGATOR_362478], as well as risk calculators for unintentional opi[INVESTIGATOR_75178], in a population of 
nearly 8 million patients across 7 care systems. Variables in these risk models will include 
prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_362479], prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_46218], 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-related overdose, OUD and/or MOUD prescription, and illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]. 
NIDA CTN-[ADDRESS_451610] influenced study outcomes. For each patient at each 
encounter, we will know why that patient was identified as high risk. 
 Healthcare System Leaders 
We will work with study teams and healthcare system leadership at each site to identify up to 15 
leaders at each site with various levels of engagement with the OUD-CDS implementation and 
oversight to provide input into perceived value of the OUD-CDS, barriers and facilitators to 
implementation of the OUD-CDS, and costs associated with implementation and maintenance. 
Leaders will be recruited to provide wide representation of influence within the organization, 
including high-level decision makers and mid-level supervisors, such as clinic manager and care 
team leaders. Leaders will be consented to participate in interviews. 
 Strategies for Recruitment and Retention 
Clinic Recruitment and Retention:  Our team will work as directed by [CONTACT_22866], their 
contractors, and the study teams and clinical leadership at each healthcare site to determine 
which primary care clinics will be eligible for inclusion in this study. All PCPs and their patients 
who meet the criteria defined in Sections 8.2 and 8.3  will be included in this study. 
Through prior work, we know that feedback about use rates of the OUD-CDS tool, provided at the 
clinic level and the individual PCP level, is crucial for achieving and maintaining high use rates of 
the CDS tool, essentially one important measure of retention and continued engagement. To 
promote high and sustained use rates of the OUD-CDS, we will work with each system’s primary 
care leadership to identify to which clinic leaders such use reports should be sent, and whether 
we will be able to offer incentives to clinics to achieve and maintain high use rates. In previous 
studies, incentives have included clinic lunches or contributions to the general clinic fund that is 
used to pay for such things as flowers to mark important life events for clinic employees. 
Strategies to achieve and maintain high use rates may include the following multi-pronged 
strategies: 
1. We will use a multi-level approach to prompt PCPs to screen and treat patients for OUD. 
Depending on the healthcare system, this will include several or all of the strategies 
below, and potentially additional strategies based on healthcare system leader 
recommendations. After a high-risk patient is screened and not assessed to have OUD, 
all alerts for that patient would be silenced for a period of time depending on the 
underlying algorithms. 
NIDA CTN-[ADDRESS_451611] practice advisory (BPA) for rooming staff in EPIC that 
prompts the rooming staff to print the patient and PCP interfaces of the tool with 
one click. The patient printout prompts patients to discuss any concerns they 
have about opi[INVESTIGATOR_362480], while it notifies the PCP that this is a 
patient who has been identified as needing screening and possibly treatment for 
OUD. It will also alert patients and PCPs when OUD has been identified in the 
electronic health record, with or without corresponding MOUDs. 
b. We will prompt the screening of patients identified at high risk for OUD at refill 
encounters for opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007]. Such encounters may occur either in clinic 
with the PCP, via phone with registered nurse (RN) refill encounters, or via other 
encounter types depending on the care system. 
c. At healthcare systems that require that PCPs complete contracts with their 
patients that outline agreements re: use of their opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], we will prompt 
assessment of patients for OUD when those contracts are due to be renewed. At 
HealthPartners, such contracts occur annually and are identified via a health 
maintenance alert in EPIC. Our team will work to determine whether such opi[INVESTIGATOR_362481] 2 & 3, whether they are tracked/prompted in 
EPIC, and whether these encounters may provide additional opportunities for 
OUD screening. 
2. We will provide monthly clinic- and provider-level feedback of use rates to clinic 
leadership, and, where allowed, offer clinic-level incentives to achieve and maintain high 
use rates. In other CDS studies, we have found that providing clinic-level and PCP-level 
use reports data has dramatically improved and sustained use rates for the duration of 
the intervention. 
One month after each healthcare system’s go-live date, study staff will begin sending 
intervention clinic leaders monthly reports that include (1) each clinic’s use rate of the 
OUD-CDS in the previous month, compared to other clinics in that healthcare system 
(and, as available as the study progresses, previous months’ use rates), ranked from 
highest-use clinics to lowest-use clinics, and (2) the use rates for each primary care 
provider (PCP) in that particular clinic (i.e., clinic leaders only get use rate reports at the 
PCP level for their own clinic, not other primary care clinics). Accompanying these 
monthly use rate reports is clear communication of the use rate goal of 60% or more of 
targeted encounters, and, where allowed, the threshold to reach a clinic incentive (such 
as achieving target use rates for at least 3 consecutive months to earn a clinic lunch). 
The example report below is from an implementation of a cardiovascular decision 
support tool, where target use rates were 80% of eligible encounters. Leadership at 
every primary care clinic in that care system received emailed monthly reports.

25 and discuss potential strategies for increasing use rates, including training or retraining for 
rooming staff of PCPs with low use rates and qualitative interviews with care teams to 
understand potential barriers to use (Is the rooming staff seeing the best practice alert? 
Are there issues with being able to print the CDS? Does the PCP feel he or she doesn’t 
have time to integrate this tool with their usual workflow, or that OUD is not a clinical priority 
for his or her patients?) and any concerns or questions about the OUD-CDS tool itself. 
3. We will conduct a pre-implementation pi[INVESTIGATOR_362482]-CDS and make any 
improvements needed to the tool and workflow prior to live implementation. The step-wise 
evaluation of the OUD-CDS by [CONTACT_362537]-out will inform the implementation at subsequent 
sites. Ongoing evaluation during implementation will offer continuous process 
improvement for the OUD-CDS with a goal of optimizing PCP use rates. 
4. One example of the effectiveness of these strategies is seen in Serious Mental Illness 
Wizard (SMI), an NIH-funded study that aimed to reduce cardiovascular risk in people with 
SMI. Our team used clinic-and PCP-specific use rates and clinic lunch incentives to 
achieve use rates well above the goal of 80% of eligible encounters. Of note, the best 
practice alert was sent to rooming staff, not the PCP, accounting for the higher baseline 
rates (prior to use rate report feedback) of 30% vs 5% in the COMPUTE pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].

 Rationale for Site Selection 
A total of three study sites involving at least 30 primary care clinics (at least 10 primary care clinics 
in each healthcare system) will provide for diversity in primary care practices, patient race and 
ethnicity, geographical distribution, and rural/urban representation.  
HealthPartners will serve as Site [ADDRESS_451614] consumer-governed nonprofit health care organization 
in the country, providing care, coverage, research, and education to improve health and well-
being in partnership with its members, patients and community. HealthPartners serves more than 
1.5 million medical and dental health plan members and more than1 million patients in its 
HealthPartners Medical Group (HPMG) and Park Nicollet Medical Group (PNMG) clinics and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. In 2013, HealthPartners and Park Nicollet combined under the name [CONTACT_362579] a single consumer-governed board of directors. The new organization includes a 
multispecialty group practice of more than 1,700 physicians, seven hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], 47 primary care 
clinics, 22 urgent care locations, 22 dental clinics, and numerous specialty practices in Minnesota 
and western Wisconsin. The majority of HPMG and PNMG patients (>80%) have commercial 
health insurance, while approximately 6% are insured via Medicare and 4% via Medicaid. HPMG 
and PNMG offer outpatient primary and specialty addiction care, day programs, partial 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_362485]. The 
medical groups refer out for methadone maintenance; for the approximately 40% of patients who 
are also HealthPartners Insurance members, we will be able to capture data on their methadone 
prescription dispensings. 
The remaining two study sites, Geisinger and Essentia, were selected based on the availability 
and engagement of an effective clinicians champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], and the care system’s ability to: (a) obtain 
adequate support from their primary care and other care system leadership, (b) modify and install 
custom EHR code, (c) help determine best ways to integrate the CDS into their clinical workflows 
and achieve and maintain high clinical use, (d) provide required training for PCPs and staff, and 
(e) obtain timely IT security clearance and a letter of support from their IT group. These criteria 
are imperative for ensuring proper functioning and maintenance of the OUD-CDS. They were also

29 selected based on their ability to provide diversity in primary care practices, patient race and 
ethnicity, geographic distribution, and rural/urban representation. 
Primary Care Clinics 
In this clinic-randomized trial, decisions about which primary care clinics may be ineligible for 
inclusion will be made in partnership with primary care leadership. Primary care clinics that have 
fewer than [ADDRESS_451615] PCPs at clinic Z practice a day 
or two a week at clinics X and Y, clinics X, Y and Z would be randomized as one potential unit 
(thereby [CONTACT_362538]). 
NIDA CTN-[ADDRESS_451616] visit 
at which the OUD-CDS algorithms determine that a patient is eligible for the intervention will be 
denoted as the index visit. 
 Randomization 
The OUD-CDS software is a system level intervention comprised of 1) a passively operating web 
service that gathers, analyzes and retains information pertinent to every web service call, and 2) 
a user interface that presents a summary of algorithm results to front end users. The web service 
documents every web service call made by [CONTACT_362539]-end users in all participating locations so that 
data pertinent to all targeted visits from all eligible and enrolled patients will be identically collected 
and available in both treatment arms. The user interface will function as the intervention delivery 
vehicle and therefore be operative only in intervention locations. Intervention or Control 
designation will vary randomly by [CONTACT_6903]. The OUD-CDS web service will therefore operate 
passively in all participating clinics but the user interface will only be turned on in clinics that are 
randomly assigned to the intervention treatment group. 
To the extent that patients tend to receive most of their care over time at a single clinic, and that 
clinicians tend to practice at a single clinic, it is reasonable to assert that the risk of intervention 
contamination across clinics is low. However, because it is common for patients to see more than 
one clinician in a clinic location over time, and for clinicians within a clinic location to discuss 
aspects of care delivery with each other, the risk of intervention contamination within clinics is 
rather high. Randomizing by [CONTACT_362540]. 
Generally speaking, randomization should balance treatment groups on factors that enhance or 
impede intervention uptake and adherence, that are related to and including study outcomes, and 
on any other unmeasured factors that may affect statistical power. However, the likelihood that 
factors related to these considerations are balanced may be diminished in cluster-randomized 
trials due to relatively few randomized units.[33, 34] Covariate constrained randomization of the 
clinics will be implemented to balance treatment groups across the study and within health care 
systems (strata) on factors related to study outcomes, implementation of the intervention, and 
potential treatment modifiers. Potential balancing factors include:  
 % of all patients with diagnosed OUD with a current MOUD 
 % of all patients with diagnosed OUD 
 % of all patients at high risk for OUD 
 % of patients at high risk for OUD provided a with naloxone rescue kit 
 n of adult patients at clinic 
 % of adult patients with government sponsored insurance 
 % of adult patients who are non-Hispanic White 
 n of waivered providers 
NIDA CTN-[ADDRESS_451617] visit that is eligible 
for the OUD-CDS intervention (i.e., index visit) takes place, and as such will be in the treatment 
group to which their clinic was randomly assigned. Post-index visits may take place in the same 
or different clinics or treatment groups relative to the index visit and may or may not be eligible 
for the OUD-CDS to offer treatment recommendations. In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_46228]-to-treat principle, 
all index and post-index visits and outcome measures for each patient will be attributed to the 
treatment group assignment of the clinic where the index visit took place. 
 Treatment/Intervention 
The intervention is the availability of the OUD-CDS display in approximately half of randomized 
primary care clinics.  
 Premature Withdrawal of Participants 
Once randomized, all primary care clinics are anticipated to remain enrolled for the duration of 
the study. All PCPs in randomized clinics will be followed for the duration of the study unless they 
die or leave the employment of the clinic. All study-eligible patients with OUD or identified by [CONTACT_362541]. Patients who have opted out of research will 
be excluded from all analyses. 
 Study Halting Rules 
Reasons for the DSMB, investigator or sponsor to halt the study may include, but are not limited 
to, lack of funding or early termination of the study for safety reasons. If the study is prematurely 
terminated or temporarily suspended, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_362486](s) for the termination or temporary suspension. 
 Follow-Up 
There is no study-determined visit schedule. Patient visits with their PCPs in the randomized 
clinics will take place without any interference or involvement from the study team. Primary care 
visits that take place after the index visit and prior to the end of the observation period will be 
denoted as post-index visits. The OUD-CDS will flag the occurrence of all index and post-index 
visits so that EHR data documented from each may be extracted and assembled into an analytic 
dataset. 
 Participant Reimbursement 
We will not be directly reimbursing PCPs and patients to participate in the OUD-CDS intervention. 
However, where allowed by [CONTACT_362542], we will be offering clinic incentives to encourage high use rates of the OUD-
CDS (see Section 8.5 ). Additionally, we may offer incentives to PCPs to complete surveys and 
to PCPs and clinic staff to participate in interviews where allowed by [CONTACT_362543]. This may include, but is not limited 
to, cash incentives, gift cards, donations to charities or chocolates. We will offer patients modest 
monetary incentives to participate in surveys and interviews. We do not plan to offer clinic or 
administrative leaders incentives to participate in interviews. At healthcare systems where this is 
allowed, we may provide incentives to PCPs in randomized clinics (i.e., PCPs in both intervention 
and UC clinics) to become buprenorphine-waivered during each site’s implementation period.

expedient and beneficial use of the findings during active implementation. However, a larger 
implementation analysis will conclude in the later phase of the study in order to inform broader 
dissemination recommendations in other settings. In order to maximize the benefit of early 
learnings, qualitative investigators at subsequent sites will be involved in planning and analysis 
of both monitoring activities and qualitative data. 
Pre-Implementation/Design Phase Activities 
1. Design phase PCP interviews: Conduct up to 10 semi-structured interviews with key 
informants (PCPs, clinic staff and health system leaders) about the design and workflow 
for the OUD-CDS and related post-index follow-up care to ensure acceptability, and 
feasibility of the intervention design. 
2. Design phase patient interviews: Conduct up to 30 semi-structured interviews at 
baseline with patients previously diagnosed with OUD, identified as high risk for OUD, or 
referred by [CONTACT_362549], content, and messaging of any patient-facing 
materials related to the OUD-CDS and patient perspective on discussing opi[INVESTIGATOR_362489]. 
3. Plan data monitoring approach: Plan and construct a monitoring system to identify in real 
time the use of the OUD-CDS and intervention-related post-index care at the levels of 
the health system, randomized clinics, individual clinicians, and individual patients. This 
monitoring system will be utilized during active implementation to provide feedback to 
clinics and system leaders and support the ongoing assessment of barriers and 
facilitators to the use of the OUD-CDS as well as modifications in adoption and 
implementation. 
4. Mini-pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]: Conduct a mini-pi[INVESTIGATOR_362490]-CDS with a small 
number of clinicians in order to test the OUD-CDS tool and the monitoring and feedback 
system. Collect feedback from pre-pi[INVESTIGATOR_362491]. 
5. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_362492]-CDS in 1-2 clinic sites in the care system. 
6. Finalize implementation plan: Make adjustments to final implementation analysis where 
feasible and necessary, and document implementation-related issues from multiple 
stakeholder perspectives prior to moving forward. 
7. Baseline PCP surveys: Collect baseline surveys (prior to vanguard or overall go-live 
dates, depending on clinic) of all PCPs in randomized clinics to assess confidence in 
assessing, diagnosing, treating, and referring patients with OUD.

35 Implementation Activities 
1. Monitoring: Produce monitoring data reports developed during the pre-implementation 
phase that describe the use of the OUD-CDS and the types of post-index follow-up care 
received by [CONTACT_362550]-CDS. 
2. Feedback: Distribute monitoring reports to clinic leaders on a periodic basis (at least 
monthly). 
3. Interview selection: Utilize the monitoring reports to identify and compare characteristics 
of clinics and clinicians with high and low rates of OUD-CDS use as well as high and low 
proportions of patients receiving post-index care. 
4. PCP/staff/leader interviews: Conduct up to [ADDRESS_451619]. 
5. Patient interviews: Conduct up to 90 semi-structured interviews with patients previously 
diagnosed with OUD, identified as high risk for OUD, or referred by [CONTACT_362551]. 
6. Patient Surveys (0-6 months after go-live date): Collect up to [ADDRESS_451620] 
and quantify conclusions developed from the patient interviews. 
7. Adaptation: Work with system and clinic leaders to devise and implement adaptations to 
the original design and workflows that address any barriers identified above and 
document all changes and known factors contributing to barriers and facilitators. 
8. Adaptation: Make continuous recommendations to Sites 2 and 3 about their 
implementation plan based on findings from early implementation analysis in Site 1. 
9. Follow-up PCP Surveys (9-months after go-live date): Collect 9-month surveys of all 
primary care clinicians in randomized clinics to assess change in confidence assessing, 
diagnosing, treating, and referring patients with OUD. Include set of questions about the 
usability, accuracy, likelihood to recommend the tool, and barriers and facilitators 
identified through the clinician interviews for PCPs in OUD-CDS randomized clinics. 
 
The above series of activities will be repeated at each site. Data collected will be analyzed rapi[INVESTIGATOR_362493].   
Subject Recruitment and Data Collection 
A. PCP Surveys 
All PCPs in intervention and control randomized clinics will be surveyed at Baseline and 9 months

go-live date to pi[INVESTIGATOR_362494]-out of the baseline surveys and go-live procedures in a select subset 
of clinics. Follow-up surveys will be conducted after the intervention has been live for [ADDRESS_451622] of unique survey links, one of which will be included 
in each invitation to a PCP to respond to the survey. The survey will appear to originate within the 
health system. All surveys will include a consent form which will allow the respondent to agree to 
the collection and storage of the respondent’s data prior to proceeding with the survey. Clinicians 
may receive an incentive for participation. 
The initial PCP survey (“Baseline Survey”) will focus on confidence in their ability to appropriately 
assess, diagnose, treat and refer patients with OUD, assessed via 4- or 5-point Likert scales. At 
intervention end, PCPs will again be surveyed about their confidence in OUD care (“Follow-up 
Survey”), and PCPs in intervention clinics will also complete survey questions specific to the OUD-
CDS, including questions regarding usability, accuracy, and provider likelihood to recommend the 
tool. A draft of specific items in the surveys follows. The survey draft that follows is provided as 
an example, is subject to change, and may differ slightly between healthcare systems.

organizational context. 
Recruitment for all interviews will be conducted by [CONTACT_21639]-site study team in a method that is 
acceptable in each setting. All recruitment materials will be developed and submitted for IRB 
review when data collection is indicated. Interview guides will be developed by [CONTACT_362552]. 
Clinician interviews will explore questions about the workflow of the OUD-CDS within the primary 
care setting; ease of use, areas of confusion, and potential improvements in overall usefulness 
for clinicians; options for overcoming barriers in primary care encounters for using the OUD-CDS; 
and appropriateness of the tool for clinicians’ priorities in identifying and treating OUD. Clinician 
interviews will aim to explore and explain specific observations from the quantitative data, such 
as: differences between experiences of high and low clinician users of the OUD-CDS; relationship 
between the tool and process measures developed by [CONTACT_50783]; relationship between the tool 
and clinician outcomes like clinician waiver status, and/or patient outcomes like diagnosis, 
treatment, and post-index follow-up status. Clinician interviews will be relatively brief in nature, 
particularly during the active intervention phase when they will be used to learn more about 
problems, troubleshoot, and learn more about specific barriers. 
Patient interviews will explore questions about how patients interpret the tool; reactions to having 
OUD raised during the primary care encounter; reactions to seeing language around their opi[INVESTIGATOR_362499]; preferences for addressing risks around opi[INVESTIGATOR_362500]; 
preferences for effective communication between patients and physicians about OUD; likelihood 
of accepting treatment recommendations from the OUD-CDS. Patient interviews will also aim to 
explore and explain specific observations from the quantitative data, such as: differences in 
patients identified by [CONTACT_46251]-CDS whose physician did or did not utilize the tool in their index 
encounter; differences in patients who did or did not receive post-index care or initiate treatment 
for OUD; differences between patients by [CONTACT_70166], biomedical characteristics, and co-
NIDA CTN-[ADDRESS_451627] up to 130 brief surveys 
from patients in order to quantify the observations and conclusions drawn from the interviews. 
Samples for evaluation surveys will be defined and identified by [CONTACT_21639]-site study team for 
recruitment and data collection. Recruitment samples will be balanced by [CONTACT_362553], such as race/ethnicity, gender, or presence/absence of an OUD diagnosis in order 
to draw generalizations from the survey results. 
The DSC will work with the Lead Node and each study site to construct a survey that will be 
acceptable within each care system. The survey data will be collected by [CONTACT_362554]. 
The DSC will provide each study site with a list of unique survey links, one of which will be included 
in each invitation to a patient to respond to the survey. The survey will appear to originate within 
the health system where possible. All surveys will include a consent form for the respondent to 
agree to the collection and storage of the respondent’s data prior to proceeding with the survey. 
Patients will receive a small incentive for survey completion. 
Patient interviews will be designed first to solicit patient input on their perception about the 
acceptability of PCPs addressing OUD in general, feedback on the OUD-CDS in particular and 
how it affects this discussion, and how to better fit the tool into clinical workflows from the patient 
perspective. Patient survey content will then be designed based on the findings of the qualitative 
patient interviews, and as such, we are not submitting a draft of this survey at this time. 
D. Field Notes and Observation Data 
Throughout the project, each study site will maintain careful notes related to health system 
stakeholder engagement that include meeting notes, clinic visits, and major health system 
initiatives related to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2512]. 
Each study team will contribute information from field notes to a central implementation log held 
and maintained by [CONTACT_325592]. The implementation log will track major issues related to the RE-
AIM constructs and contextual factors related to the care system, individual clinics, adaptations 
by [CONTACT_362555], and technical changes over time in the intervention. Notes will also capture 
broader macro-environment issues affecting opi[INVESTIGATOR_362501]. Each study site will contribute updates to the implementation log on a quarterly basis. 
Original primary notes will be held by [CONTACT_362556] a resource to reference through the 
analysis process.

will be collected from the EHR by [CONTACT_46251]-CDS and stored in a secure analytic database. Data 
will be collected from the EHR via the OUD-CDS tool itself, with data stored in a secure server 
located behind multiple HealthPartners firewalls. 
 Measures of Primary and Secondary Outcomes 
Primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed using the data collected from the EHR via the 
OUD-CDS, from EHR (Clarity) data pulls, through PCP surveys and qualitative interviews, patient 
surveys and qualitative interviews, healthcare administrator interviews, and site implementation 
staff interviews. The specific outcome measures are described in Section 7.[ADDRESS_451629] us directly with any questions or concerns if they’d rather not use the

45 12.0 TRAINING REQUIREMENTS 
 Overall 
A comprehensive Training Plan will be developed to incorporate general training, study-specific 
training, and mechanisms for competency assessment. The Investigative Team is responsible for 
the development of a comprehensive Training Plan, instructional material, and delivery of the 
training (e.g., via self-study, online, webcast, or teleconference), with the team comprised of the 
Lead Node, Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC), Data and Statistics Center (DSC), as well as 
other participating nodes and subject matter experts, as applicable. PCPs who are in primary care 
clinics randomized to receive the OUD-CDS will be trained on how to diagnosis and manage OUD 
in primary care, use of the OUD-CDS, and the importance of using the Feedback Tab to let the 
study team know of any issues or questions. Traditionally, we have completed such trainings at 
in-person lunch meetings with clinic personnel, but will also consider other training modalities, 
such as web-based trainings or teleconferences, depending on the standard training practices at 
partner sites and clinic leadership preference. 
Study staff will be trained as specified in the Study Training Plan and are required to complete 
institutionally required training per their research site, IRB(s), and authorities with regulatory 
oversight. Training will include Human Subject Protection (HSP) and Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP), as well as protocol-specific training. Tracking of training completion for individual staff as 
prescribed for assigned study role(s) will be documented, endorsed by [CONTACT_362557] [INVESTIGATOR_268507], and audited by [CONTACT_145859]. As changes occur in the prescribed 
training, the Training Plan and training documentation tracking forms will be amended to reflect 
these adjustments.

46 13.0 STATISTICAL DESIGN AND ANALYSES 
 General Design 
 Study Hypotheses 
H1.1: Patients previously undiagnosed with OUD but identified as high risk by [CONTACT_46251]-CDS at 
an index visit will be more likely to receive an OUD diagnosis (in the problem list or as an ICD-10 
visit code) in intervention clinics than UC clinics within [ADDRESS_451630]-index. 
H1.2: Patients previously diagnosed with OUD or identified as high risk by [CONTACT_46251]-CDS at an 
index visit will be more likely to have naloxone rescue kits ordered in the intervention clinics than 
in the UC clinics within [ADDRESS_451631]-index. 
H2.1: Patients identified as having OUD or as being at high-risk for OUD by [CONTACT_46251]-CDS at an 
index visit will be more likely to have MOUD orders or referral for OUD treatment within [ADDRESS_451632]-index in intervention clinics than in UC clinics. 
H2.2: Patients identified as having OUD or as being at high-risk for OUD by [CONTACT_46251]-CDS at an 
index visit will have significantly more days covered by a MOUD prescription at [ADDRESS_451633]-
index in intervention clinics than in UC clinics. 
H3.1: Patients with OUD or identified as high-risk for OUD by [CONTACT_46251]-CDS who are cared for in 
intervention clinics will have significantly fewer post-index ED visits during the observation period 
(i.e., the period between each patient’s index date and last observation) compared to patients 
cared for in UC clinics. 
H3.2: Patients with OUD or identified as high-risk for OUD by [CONTACT_46251]-CDS who are cared for in 
intervention clinics will have significantly fewer post-index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_362502]. 
H4.1: After controlling for demographics, baseline clinical status and prior costs of care, patients 
with OUD or identified as high risk for OUD by [CONTACT_46251]-CDS will have lower healthcare costs in 
intervention compared to UC clinics during the observation period (i.e., savings from lower ED 
visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_362503]-CDS implementation and maintenance). 
 Primary and Secondary Outcomes (Endpoints) 
Primary outcome measures  will include: 
1. OUD diagnosis (in the problem list or as an ICD-10 visit code) within 30 days of index 
visit for patients identified by [CONTACT_46251]-CDS as being at high risk of OU 
2. Naloxone prescription within 30 days of index visit for patients with OUD or identified by 
[CONTACT_46251]-CDS as being at high risk for OUD 
3. MOUD orders or referral to OUD treatment within 30 days of index visit for patients with 
OUD or identified by [CONTACT_46251]-CDS as being at high risk for OUD 
4. Total days covered by [CONTACT_362517] 90 days after index visit for patients 
with OUD or identified by [CONTACT_46251]-CDS as being at high risk for OUD

8. All-cause mortality rates during the observation period for patients at high risk of OUD 
9. Fatal and non-fatal opi[INVESTIGATOR_362464] 
10. Rates of OUD-CDS use in intervention clinics 
11. PCP ratings of confidence in treating patients with OUD prior to go-live date and 9-
months following go-live date 
12. Intervention clinic PCP ratings of satisfaction and acceptability of the OUD-CDS at 9 
months following go-live date 
Exploratory outcome measures  may include: 
1. Number of non-waivered PCPs becoming buprenorphine waivered during the 
intervention period, assessed via health system administrative data 
2. Number of buprenorphine prescriptions written by [CONTACT_362518] 
3. PCP ratings of likelihood to prescribe buprenorphine for patients with OUD should no 
waiver be required, measured prior to go-live dates and 9-months following go-live dates 
4. Adherence to therapy during the observation period, assessed via Clarity and claims 
data 
5. Number of patients diagnosed with OUD screened for mental health comorbidities and 
infectious diseases during the observation period 
 Recruitment 
COMPUTE 2.0 will be conducted at a minimum of 30 primary care clinics within 3 care systems 
that are geographically dispersed and will include a racially, ethnically and socioeconomically 
diverse population. Site 1 is HealthPartners, which was the sole site for the COMPUTE 1.0 pi[INVESTIGATOR_11480], while Site 2 is Geisinger and Site 3 is Essentia. A minimum of 10 primary care clinics to be 
included per site will be selected in partnership with site PIs and primary care leadership at each 
site, taking into consideration such factors as overall clinic size, number of waivered PCPs, and 
baseline prevalence of diagnosed OUD. Clinics will be randomized equally within care system

48 and balanced on pre-randomization outcomes, such as the percentage of study-eligible patients 
with diagnosed OUD, and on clinic characteristics that may enhance or impede intervention 
uptake and adherence, such as the number of waivered PCPs (see Section 10.2 ). 
PCPs who practice at randomized clinics will be asked to complete surveys prior to go-live date 
and 9-months after go-live date assessing their comfort and confidence treating patients with 
OUD, and among providers in intervention clinics their perceptions of the OUD-CDS. The DSC 
will work with the Lead Node and each study site to construct a survey that will be acceptable 
within each care system. The survey data will be collected by [CONTACT_362554]. Samples for 
PCP surveys will be identified by [CONTACT_21639]-site study teams for recruitment and data collection. The 
DSC will provide each study site with a list of unique survey links, one of which will be included in 
each invitation to a PCP to respond to the survey. The survey will appear to originate within the 
health system where possible. All surveys will include a consent form which will allow the 
respondent to agree to the collection and storage of the respondent’s data prior to proceeding 
with the survey. Clinicians may be offered an incentive for participation.  
A sample of patients who have been diagnosed with OUD, have been identified as being at high 
risk for OUD or opi[INVESTIGATOR_46211], or referred by a PCP will be recruited to participate in surveys 
and interviews via a mailed or emailed invitation based on standard processes at each site. 
Samples for evaluation surveys will be defined and identified by [CONTACT_21639]-site study team for

agree to prior to proceeding with the survey. Patients will receive a small incentive for survey 
completion. 
Clinic and administrative leaders will be identified as potential candidates for interviews in 
conjunction with site investigators and healthcare system leadership. Leaders will be emailed an 
invitation to participate in a phone or in-person interview, and leaders will complete verbal consent 
to participate at the beginning of the phone interview. 
 Randomization and Factors for Stratification 
The OUD-CDS software is a system-level intervention comprised of 1) a passively operating web 
service that gathers, analyzes and retains information pertinent to every web service call, and 2) 
a user interface that presents a summary of algorithm results to front end users. The web service 
documents every web service call made by [CONTACT_362539]-end users in all participating locations so that 
data pertinent to all targeted visits from all eligible and enrolled patients will be identically collected 
and available in both treatment arms. The user interface will function as the intervention delivery 
vehicle and therefore be operative only in intervention locations. Intervention or Control 
designation will vary randomly by [CONTACT_6903]. The OUD-CDS web service will therefore operate 
NIDA CTN-[ADDRESS_451635] statistical power. However, the likelihood that 
factors related to these considerations are balanced may be diminished in cluster-randomized 
trials due to relatively few randomized units.[33, 34] Covariate constrained randomization will be 
implemented to balance treatment groups across the study and within health care systems (strata) 
on factors related to study outcomes, implementation of the intervention, and potential treatment 
modifiers. 
Potential balancing factors include: 
 n of waivered providers 
 n of adult patients at clinic 
 % of adult patients with government sponsored insurance 
 % of adult patients who are non-Hispanic White 
 % of all patients at high risk for OUD 
 % of patients at high risk for OUD provided a with naloxone rescue kit 
 % of all patients with diagnosed OUD 
 % of all patients with diagnosed OUD with a current MOUD 
Each patient will be assigned to the clinic in which his or her first visit that is eligible for the OUD-
CDS intervention (i.e., index visit) takes place, and as such will be assigned to the treatment group 
to which their clinic was randomly assigned. Post-index visits may take place in the same or 
different clinics or treatment groups relative to the index visit and may or may not be eligible for 
the OUD-CDS to offer treatment recommendations. In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_46228]-to-treat principle, all 
index and post-index visits and outcome measures for each patient will be attributed to the 
treatment group assignment of the clinic where the index visit took place. 
Further details regarding the randomization procedures including the final balancing factors 
included in the randomization are provided in a separate study randomization plan.  
 Prediction Models 
Aims 1 through 3 pertain to the effectiveness of the OUD-CDS intervention relative to UC, 
predicting that it will increase diagnosis, naloxone prescribing, and access to MOUD, and 
decrease ED visits and inpatient stays. These hypotheses will be tested using generalized linear 
mixed models to account for clustering of outcomes within eligible patients and randomized 
clinics, or using generalized estimating equations to compare event rates. Outcomes will be 
normalized via distribution-appropriate link functions (e.g., logistic-Normal, Poisson-Normal). 
NIDA CTN-[ADDRESS_451636] 30 primary care clinics at three participating healthcare systems (i.e., at least 10 primary 
care clinics per healthcare system) are expected to participate in this study. 
 Projected Number of Participants per Site 
There must be at least [ADDRESS_451637] this will be a low threshold for clinics to attain. 
The COMPUTE 1.0 intervention was implemented for six months among 55 randomized providers 
who practiced in 30 clinics. During that time, these providers saw between 14 and 137 patients 
(provider median = 77; 37-412 patients per clinic, clinic median = 163) who were eligible for the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_362504]-CDS intervention. To the extent the COMPUTE 2.[ADDRESS_451638] index visits at many clinics. 
 Statistical Power 
A preliminary power analysis was conducted to estimate the minimum detectable difference in 
the likelihood of OUD diagnosis (H1.1), naloxone rescue kit order (H1.2) and MOUD order or 
referral for treatment (H2.2) within [ADDRESS_451639]-index (H2.2) among patients cared for in OUD-CDS 
relative to UC clinics (see Section 13.4 ). The power analysis relied on conservative assumptions 
regarding the numbers of randomized clinics (10, 30, 50) and of eligible patients (50 or 100 per 
clinic); a range of clinic intraclass correlations consistent with those observed for other process 
measures at HealthPartners (i.e., ICC clin = 0.01, 0.03, 0.05); and central tendency estimates for 
the outcomes (2%, 5%, 10% and 20% or 70, 50, 30 days not covered in UC). Power estimates 
will be updated after Sites [ADDRESS_451640] size estimates for the binary outcomes were calculated using the NIH group randomized 
trial sample size calculator.[48] The difference in days covered was estimated using the Poisson 
regression module of PASS 11 software[49] after calculating an effective sample size (i.e., N eff = 
(n clinics*m patients per clinic) / (1+(m-1)*ICC clin)). In addition, the Poisson model power analysis 
was conducted to estimate the minimally detectable decrease in days NOT covered in the [ADDRESS_451641]-index among OUD-CDS relative to UC patients to ensure that the estimated days in 
both groups remained between 0 and 90 days. 
Table 3 summarizes the minimum detectable increases in outcome rates among OUD-CDS 
relative to UC patients given the aforementioned assumptions. Assuming 30 randomized clinics 
with 50 high risk patients each, that 5% of UC patients have an OUD diagnosis within 30 days of 
their index visit and ICC clin = 0.03, the H1.1 analysis would be powered (power=0.80, α 2 = 0.05) 
to detect a difference if ≥11.35% (odds ratio = 2.43) of OUD-CDS patients have an OUD diagnosis 
within 30 days of their index visit. For an event occurring among 10% of UC patients given the 
NIDA CTN-[ADDRESS_451642] a difference if it occurs 
among ≥ 18.12% (odds ratio = 1.99) of OUD-CDS patients. Having more patients per clinic (e.g., 
30 clinics * 100 patients each = 3000 patients) results in a smaller detectable effect size (i.e., 
17.18 OUD-CDS vs. 10% UC; odds ratio = 1.87) although randomizing more than the minimum 
30 clinics (e.g., 50 clinics * 50 patients each = 2500 patients) would reduce the minimum 
detectable effect (i.e., 16.02 OUD-CDS vs. 10% UC; odds ratio = 1.72) further with fewer patients.

ICCclin m=50 clinics   m=[ADDRESS_451647] that the OUD-CDS intervention will increase the likelihood 
that patients at high risk of OUD are diagnosed with OUD (H1.1); and that among those at high 
risk or diagnosed with OUD it will increase the likelihoods that a naloxone rescue kit is ordered 
(H1.2) and that MOUD is ordered or the patient is referred to a provider who can order MOUD 
(H2.1), and the number of days covered by [CONTACT_362558] (H2.2). The hypotheses from 
Aims 1 and 2 will be tested using generalized linear mixed models so that the likelihood or counts 
of outcomes may be accurately estimated among OUD-CDS relative to UC clinics, accounting for 
the clustering of patients within randomized clinics. Binary outcomes (H1.1, H1.2, H2.1) will be 
normalized using a logistic-Normal link function, while it is anticipated that the count outcome 
(H2.2) will be normalized using a Poisson-Normal link function. The model will estimate fixed 
effects of OUD-CDS, care system and other covariates on outcomes, and random intercepts for 
clinics and patients (H1.1, H1.2, H2.1) or for clinics (H2.2). 
Hypotheses for Aim [ADDRESS_451648] fewer ED visits (H3.1) and inpatient stays (H3.2) during the 
observation period of patients receiving care in the OUD-CDS relative to UC clinics. The rate at 
which each of these outcomes occurs per patient-year will be compared across clinics using 
generalized estimating equations. Clinic-aggregated counts of ED visits and inpatient stays will 
be normalized using a Poisson-Normal link function, and the intercept offset by [CONTACT_362559]-
years within the clinic. The model will estimate fixed effects of OUD-CDS, care system and other 
covariates on the rate of each outcome per patient-year. Should it be feasible, we will also collect 
and count ED visits and inpatient stays that occurred in the year prior to each patient’s index visit 
so that treatment group differences in pre-post changes in event rates can be quantified (i.e., 
treatment by [CONTACT_6491]). 
Hypotheses for Aim [ADDRESS_451649] lower healthcare costs and the identification and mitigation of 
barriers and identification of facilitators to OUD-CDS implementation and uptake. Analysis of 
costs for this aim will include delivery costs of the OUD-CDS and incremental medical care costs 
attributable to the intervention, defined from the health system perspective. Intervention costs 
may include resources used for implementation, maintenance, compensation, and PCP and staff 
training – which may be assessed by [CONTACT_57245]/surveys with implementation site staff or study 
resource use documentation, as appropriate – but will exclude research, development, and 
measurement costs, using standard micro-cost accounting methods and nationally-representative 
pricing of inputs. Medical care costs will include all prescribed medications and clinical inpatient, 
emergency, outpatient, and skilled nursing facility services incurred in the pre- and post-index 
observation periods by [CONTACT_362560], as indicated by [CONTACT_362561]. The study sample for the cost analysis will be participants who have 
continuous insurance coverage during the study period, including pharmacy benefits. This sample 
NIDA CTN-[ADDRESS_451650]-intervention periods. To address this, claims 
will be converted to dollar amounts using Total Care Relative Resource Values TM (TCRRVs), 
which are a nationally standardized set of measures that have been endorsed by [CONTACT_362562][50] and are derived from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) 
relative value units (RVUs). TCRRVs extend CMS RVU measures to include utilization categories, 
such as laboratory services and medications, which do not have CMS RVU weights.[51] Inpatient 
costs are calculated by [CONTACT_362563]-related group classification and length 
of stay of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
Standard health econometric and specification testing methods will be used to assess the 
incremental differences in healthcare costs between study groups [1, 2, 39]. Specifically, 
healthcare care costs will be analyzed using a generalized hierarchical model with a time x study 
group interaction term that can account for clinic-level clustering and the correlation in each 
subjects’ repeated measures of costs over time (i.e., pre-index and post-index). Demographics 
and baseline clinical status will be controlled for based on randomization imbalances and model 
fit criteria. The marginal effect of being assigned to an intervention clinic will provide an estimate 
of the incremental medical cost associated with the OUD-CDS intervention. To account for the 
non-normality in costs, the distribution family will be specified appropriately, such as by [CONTACT_362564],[2] and the goodness of fit for the specified link function will be tested, such as 
by [CONTACT_362565].[53, 54] Confidence intervals 
will be estimated using heteroscedasticity-robust estimation methods.[55] 
Mixed method data analysis for Aim 5 will occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_362505], so that new 
information can support decision making about revisions in the implementation plan and 
adaptations as the study proceeds. All data analysis and subsequent conclusions and decisions 
made during live implementation will be carefully documented. 
After the implementation phase is complete at all sites, monitoring data, survey data, and 
qualitative data from all sites will be triangulated to draw conclusions about the barriers, 
facilitators, adaptations, and recommendations for future dissemination of the OUD-CDS tool. 
 Qualitative Data Analysis 
All interview data (from patients, PCPs and leaders) will be analyzed in two phases by a team 
consisting of the interviewers and analysts from each of the sites: 
1. Small samples will be reviewed immediately without coding to identify specific 
intervention problems needing prompt attention and revision in implementation 
approach. 
2. As larger samples are created, we will use a more standard content analysis employing 
an iterative data-reduction method.[56] 
A draft codebook will be developed based on the structure and content of the interview guide. 
That will be revised during application in early interviews by [CONTACT_362566]-0095  Version 6.0  
 COMPUTE 2.0  March 31, 2023  
 
Confidential  
54 coding can be performed by [CONTACT_362567], themes, and patterns emerging from the data. The main analytic 
purpose is to identify the clinic, PCP and patient barriers and facilitators to consistent effective 
use of the OUD-CDS.[57] Classification schemes and typologies will be used to identify and 
develop themes, concepts, and patterns. Coding and managing qualitative analyses will be 
conducted using appropriate software. 
We will maintain a data codebook and audit trail in order to map decision points in the analysis. 
Individual interviews that do not fit evolving patterns in the data will get special attention. The 
analysis team will work to agree on final themes and patterns in the data and interview data will 
be triangulated with other data sources. These themes and patterns will then be developed into 
recommendations for larger, less immediate adaptations in the use of the OUD-CDS that can then 
be tested in subsequent interviews with key informants. 
 PCP Survey Data Analysis 
PCP survey analyses will compare providers’ pre- and post-implementation reports of confidence 
in treating patients with OUD and other items included in both PCP surveys; and to assess 
intervention providers’ post-implementation ratings of satisfaction and acceptability of the OUD-
CDS. Generalized linear mixed models will compare pre-post PCP ratings to account for repeated 
survey measures from PCPs and to ensure all PCP ratings are included in the estimated changes 
in ratings. Changes in PCP ratings may vary as a function of contextual factors or PCP 
characteristics. In secondary analyses of the PCP ratings, care system indicators (Site 1, Site 2, 
Site 3), clinic (e.g., proportion of primary care patients eligible for OUD-CDS, proportion of clinic 
patients with government-sponsored insurance), and provider (e.g., waiver status, number of 
patients eligible for OUD-CDS) characteristics may be considered as main effects or in interaction 
with each other or the treatment group indicator to assess their relationship with pre-post changes 
in survey outcomes.  Provider ratings may also be used to represent provider characteristics that 
may modify the OUD-CDS treatment effectiveness. 
 Patient Survey Data Analysis 
Patient survey analyses will be descriptive to assess the extent to which themes identified in 
patient interviews are confirmed in a larger sample, and to identify correlates between these 
themes and other patient characteristics, such as racial/ethnic group, age group, or being at high 
risk for OUD vs. having diagnosed OUD. 
Secondary outcomes analyses  will follow the same logic as the primary outcomes analyses. 
Secondary outcomes that quantify person-based outcomes (e.g., MOUD maintenance and 
adherence) will be analyzed using generalized linear mixed models while those that represent 
population-averaged event rates (e.g., all-cause death rates, fatal and non-fatal opi[INVESTIGATOR_362506]) will be analyzed using generalized estimating equations.  
 Significance Testing 
The H1.1, H1.2 and H2.1 outcomes will be assessed 3 times for each patient – at the index visit 
(0 days), and 30 (for primary outcomes) and [ADDRESS_451651]-index. Outcomes that occur at an index 
visit will be coded as also having occurred by [CONTACT_46062] 30 and 90. Similarly, outcomes that occur 
between days 1 and 30 will be coded as having occurred by [CONTACT_46062] 30 and 90; and those occurring 
NIDA CTN-[ADDRESS_451652] with a Type I error rate of 5%. Comparisons 
at other time points will aid understanding of how relative differences in OUD-CDS versus UC 
settings may increase or decrease in the short term. For example, OUD-CDS might initiate a 
course of provider actions that otherwise would not occur (increase) or merely hasten action that 
eventually takes place in UC settings (decrease). 
The Aim [ADDRESS_451653] 
with a Type I error rate of 5%. 
For Aim 4, Hypothesis 4.1, the marginal effect of being assigned to an intervention clinic will 
provide an estimate of the incremental medical cost associated with the OUD-CDS intervention. 
Analyses will be 2-sided, and p-values of less than .[ADDRESS_451654] estimation methods.[55] 
There are several secondary outcomes; however, multiple comparisons will not be adjusted for 
since these are not part of the study’s primary objective. 
 Interim Analysis 
There are no planned interim analyses. 
 Exploratory Analysis 
Treatment effectiveness may vary as a function of contextual as well as patient factors. In 
secondary analyses of the primary outcomes, care system indicators (Site 1, Site 2, Site 3), clinic 
(e.g., proportion of primary care patients eligible for OUD-CDS, proportion of clinic patients with 
government-sponsored insurance), and provider (e.g., waiver status, number of patients eligible 
for OUD-CDS, confidence in treating patients with OUD, intent to prescribe buprenorphine if 
waiver no longer required) characteristics may be added to the primary model as main effects 
and in interaction with the treatment group indicator to assess treatment heterogeneity due to 
contextual factors. Patient characteristics (e.g., race, ethnicity, age, estimated neighborhood 
income and education, documented heroin vs. oral opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]) may be similarly added to assess 
treatment heterogeneity due to patient factors. 
NIDA CTN-[ADDRESS_451655] always indicates that the utilization (such as a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) did not occur. Truly missing field-based observations (e.g., OUD diagnosis 
assigned, action not observed) will be extremely rare, undetectable and assumed to be missing 
at random. 
 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic and clinical variables available in the EHR at the index visits will be summarized for 
all enrolled study participants, overall and by [CONTACT_362568]. Descriptive summaries of 
the distribution of continuous baseline variables will be presented with percentiles (median, 25th 
and 75th percentiles), and with mean and standard deviation. Categorical variables will be 
summarized in terms of frequencies and percentages. 
 Safety Analysis 
We will assess the rates of ED use, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_362507]’s observation period.  The rate at which each of these 
outcomes occurs per patient-year will be compared across clinics using generalized estimating 
equations. Clinic-aggregated counts of ED visits and inpatient stays will be normalized using a 
Poisson-Normal link function, and the intercept offset by [CONTACT_362559]-years within the clinic. 
The model will estimate fixed effects of OUD-CDS, care system and other covariates on the rate 
of each outcome per patient-year. Should it be feasible, we will also collect and estimate the rate 
at which these events occurred in the year prior to each patient’s index visit so that treatment 
group differences in pre-post changes in event rates can be quantified (i.e., treatment by [CONTACT_26072]).

57 14.0 REGULATORY COMPLIANCE, REPORTING and MONITORING 
 Statement of Compliance 
This study will be conducted in accordance with the current version of the protocol, in full 
conformity with the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki, the Protection of 
Human Subjects described in the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) GCP Guidelines, 
applicable [LOCATION_002] Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), the NIDA Terms and Conditions of 
Award, and all other applicable state, local and federal regulatory requirements. The PIs will 
assure that no deviation from, or changes to, the protocol will take place without prior agreement 
from the Sponsor and documented approval from the IRB, except where necessary to eliminate 
an immediate hazard(s) to the trial participants. An Operations Manual will be provided as a study 
reference guide and study quality assurance tool. 
 Institutional Review Board Approval 
Prior to initiating the study, participating site investigators will obtain written IRB approval from the 
IRB to conduct the study at their respective sites, which will include approval of the study protocol. 
If changes to the study protocol become necessary, protocol amendments will be submitted in 
writing by [CONTACT_354355]. In addition, IRBs will approve 
all consent forms, recruitment materials, and any materials given to the participant, and any 
changes made to these documents throughout study implementation. For changes to the consent 
form, a decision will be made regarding whether previously consented participants need to be re-
consented. IRB continuing review will be performed annually, or at a greater frequency contingent 
upon the complexity and risk of the study. Each Site PI [INVESTIGATOR_362508], IRB-approved consent documents, and approval for all protocol 
modifications. These materials must be received by [CONTACT_362569]. Unanticipated problems 
involving risk to study participants will be promptly reported to and reviewed by [CONTACT_60683], 
according to its usual procedures. 
HealthPartners will serve as Site 1, and as such, the HealthPartners IRB will serve as the central 
IRB for this study. The IRBs at Sites 2 and 3 will be expected to cede to the HealthPartners IRB 
and enter into reliance/authorization agreements for Protocol CTN 0095. The HealthPartners IRB 
will provide study oversight in accordance with 45 CFR 46. HealthPartners IRB will follow written 
procedures for reporting its findings and actions to appropriate officials at each participating 
institution. Of note, it is possible a partner site may meet Exception Criteria to the NIH sIRB (single 
IRB) Policy and may not utilize the IRB of Record.  
 Informed Consent 
 OUD-CDS Implementation 
We will request a waiver [or alteration] of informed consent of patients and PCPs from the IRB of 
record for this study to implement and run the OUD-CDS in primary care clinics. In accordance 
with applicable federal regulations (45 CFR 46.116(f)), the study protocol meets the following 
required criteria as defined in 45 CFR 46.116(f)(3)):

58  The research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects; 
 The research could not practicably be carried out without the requested waiver or 
alteration; 
 The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects; 
and 
 Whenever appropriate, the subjects or legally authorized representatives will be 
provided with additional pertinent information after participation. 
COMPUTE 2.0 uses secondary observational data to evaluate outcomes that result from primary 
care clinics randomized to receive or not receive access to the OUD-CDS. Use of these 
observational data pose no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects, with the risk chiefly being 
loss of confidentiality of data. The risk of using these data is no greater than the risk of routine 
uses of healthcare data for quality improvement by [CONTACT_39517]. Subjects’ access to 
healthcare or healthcare benefits will not be affected by [CONTACT_15365]. 
The primary objective of this study could not be achieved if only consenting a sub-sample of 
patients were included. Moreover, to identify these subjects and conduct outreach to obtain 
signed authorization would greatly increase the risk of breach of confidentiality. Additionally, we 
estimate our patient enrollment numbers will exceed 10,[ADDRESS_451656] of care. Historically this waiver has been granted by [CONTACT_362570]. 
 Patient, PCP and Health System Leader Interviews and Surveys 
All patients, PCPs and health system leaders will be consented to participate in any interviews or 
surveys. The informed consent process is a means of providing study information to each 
prospective participant and allows for an informed decision about participation in the study. The 
informed consent forms will include all of the required elements of informed consent. Every 
interview or survey participant is required to give consent verbally, electronically, or physically (via 
study staff prior to in-person interviews) prior to the initiation of any interview or survey. Every 
participant providing consent verbally or electronically will have the opportunity to obtain a hard 
copy of the consent form. 
Prior to informed consent, research staff will provide a detailed description of the study and 
interview or survey to the potential participant and provide a copy of the consent to read. If the 
participant is interested in participating in the interview or survey, he or she will have the 
opportunity to ask any questions related to participation. 
The informed consent forms will be updated or revised whenever important new safety information 
is available or whenever the protocol is amended in a way that may affect participants’ 
participation in the trial. Participants will be informed that their participation is voluntary and they 
may withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason, without penalty. Individuals who refuse 
to participate in interviews or surveys or who withdraw will be treated without prejudice. Study

59 sites will be responsible for maintaining signed consent forms as source documents for quality 
assurance (QA) review and regulatory compliance in a manner that is in compliance with the 
overseeing IRB and its institutional policies. 
 Quality Assurance Monitoring 
In accordance with federal regulations, the study sponsor is responsible for ensuring proper 
monitoring of an investigation and ensuring that the investigation is conducted in accordance with 
the protocol. Qualified monitors will oversee aspects of site conformity to make certain the site 
staff is operating within the confines of the protocol, and in accordance with GCP. This includes 
but is not limited to protocol compliance, documentation auditing, and ensuring the informed 
consent process is being correctly followed and documented. Non-conformity with protocol and 
federal regulations will be reported as a protocol deviation and submitted to the study sponsor 
and study IRB of record for further review. 
 Participant and Data Confidentiality 
Participant confidentiality and privacy is strictly held in trust by [CONTACT_3486], their 
staff, the safety and oversight monitor(s), and the sponsor and funding agency, and will be 
maintained in accordance with all applicable federal regulations and/or state/Commonwealth law 
and regulations. This confidentiality is extended to the data being collected as part of this study. 
Data that could be used to identify a specific study participant will be held in strict confidence 
within the research team. No personally-identifiable information from the study will be released to 
any unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the sponsor/funding agency and the 
participant. 
All research activities will be conducted in as private a setting as possible. 
The study monitor, other authorized representatives of the sponsor or funding agency, 
representatives of the Institutional Review Board (IRB), or regulatory agencies may inspect all 
documents and records required to be maintained by [CONTACT_093]. The clinical study site will 
permit access to such records. 
Participant records will be held confidential by [CONTACT_9909], secure storage of any documents that have participant identifiers, and secure 
computing procedures for entering and transferring electronic data.  The study participant’s 
contact [CONTACT_10414]. 
At the end of the study, all records will continue to be kept in a secure location for as long a period 
as denoted in Section 14.11, Records Retention and Requirements . 
By [CONTACT_200877], the investigator affirms that information furnished to the

 Certificate of Confidentiality 
To further protect the privacy of study participants, the Secretary, Health and Human Services 
(HHS), has issued a Certificate of Confidentiality (CoC) to all researchers engaged in biomedical, 
NIDA CTN-[ADDRESS_451657] 
identifiable research information from forced disclosure per the terms of the NIH Policy (see 
https://humansubjects.nih.gov/coc/index). This protects participants from disclosure of sensitive 
information (e.g., drug use). It is the NIH policy that investigators and others who have access to 
research records will not disclose identifying information except when the participant consents or 
in certain instances when federal, state, or local law or regulation requires disclosure. NIH expects 
investigators to inform research participants of the protections and the limits to protections 
provided by a Certificate issued by [CONTACT_17355]. 
 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) 
Study sites may be required by [CONTACT_268637]. Sites will be responsible for communicating with the IRBs or 
Privacy Boards of record and obtaining the appropriate approvals or waivers to be in regulatory 
compliance. Releases of participant identifying information that are permitted by [CONTACT_362571], but which are prohibited by [CONTACT_9912]/or 
state/Commonwealth law and regulation, are prohibited. 
 Investigator Assurances 
Each site must file (or have previously filed) a Federalwide Assurance (FWA) with the HHS Office 
for Human Research Protection (OHRP) setting forth the commitment of the organization to 
establish appropriate policies and procedures for the protection of human research subjects in 
alignment with 45 CFR 46, Subpart A, with documentation sent to NIDA or its designee. Research 
covered by [CONTACT_362572] (45 
CFR 46.103). Prior to initiating the study, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_200761] a protocol signature

according to the standards stipulated therein. 
 Financial Disclosure/Conflict of Interest 
All investigators will comply with the requirements of [ADDRESS_451658] monitors who will examine whether study 
procedures are conducted appropriately and that study data are generated, documented and 
reported in compliance with the protocol, GCP, and applicable regulations. These monitors will 
audit, at mutually agreed upon times, regulatory documents, case report forms (CRFs), informed 
consent forms and corresponding source documents for each participant. Monitors will have the 
opportunity and ability to review any study-associated document or file. 
NIDA-contracted monitors will assess whether submitted data are accurate and in agreement with 
source documentation and will also review regulatory/essential documents such as

forms, protocol adherence, reported safety events and corresponding assessments, and PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_200762]. Reports will be prepared following the visit and forwarded 
to the site principal investigator, the lead investigator and NIDA CCTN. 
Qualified node personnel (Node QA monitors) or other designated parties will provide site 
management for each site during the trial. Node QA staff or other designated parties will audit 
source documentation, including informed consent forms and HIPAA forms. This will take place 
as specified by [CONTACT_9920], node PI [INVESTIGATOR_200763], detect, and correct problems at the study sites. Node QA personnel will verify 
that study procedures are properly followed and that site personnel are trained and able to 
conduct the protocol appropriately. If the node personnel’s review of study documentation 
indicates that additional training of site study personnel is needed, node QA personnel will 
undertake or arrange for that training. Details of the contract, node QA and data monitoring are 
found in the study QA monitoring plan. 
 Inclusion of Women and Minorities 
All patients aged 18-75, inclusive, who have a diagnosis of OUD or are determined by [CONTACT_46251]-
CDS algorithms to be at high risk for OUD and who meet all other protocol-defined eligibility 
criteria will be included in the study, regardless of sex or racial/ethnic group. Patients who have 
opted out of research will be excluded from analyses. All PCPs in randomized clinics will be 
included in the study, regardless of sex or racial/ethnic group. Patients who meet the per 45 CFR 
46 Subpart C definition of prisoner will be excluded from surveys and interviews. 
 Prisoner Certification 
As per 45 CFR 46 Subpart C, there are additional protections pertaining to prisoners as study 
participants. A prisoner is defined as any individual involuntarily confined or detained in a penal 
institution. The term is intended to encompass individuals sentenced to such an institution under 
a criminal or civil statute, individuals detained in other facilities by [CONTACT_200883] a penal 
institution, and individuals detained pending arraignment, trial, or sentencing. 
Due to the nature of the OUD CDS, a prisoner certificate is not applicable to this data collection. 
Patient participants who meet the OHRP definition of “prisoner” will be ineligible for participation 
in any interview or survey.  
 Regulatory Files 
The regulatory files should contain all required regulatory documents, study-specific documents, 
and all important communications. Regulatory files will be checked at each participating site for 
regulatory document compliance prior to study initiation, throughout the study, as well as at study 
closure. 
 Records Retention and Requirements 
Research records for all study participants will be maintained by [CONTACT_8713] a secure 
location for a minimum of [ADDRESS_451659] or outcome of the trial or increase risk to study participants. Safety 
reporting will occur as previously described. At the completion of the trial, the Co-Lead 
Investigators will provide a final report to the Sponsor. 
 Audits 
The Sponsor has an obligation to ensure that this trial is conducted according to good clinical 
research practice guidelines and may perform quality assurance audits for protocol compliance. 
The Lead Investigator and authorized staff from the Northstar Node; the NIDA CTN (the study 
sponsor); NIDA’s contracted agents, monitors or auditors; and other agencies such as the HHS, 
the OHRP and the IRB of record may inspect research records for verification of data, compliance 
with federal guidelines on human participant research, and to assess participant safety. 
 Study Documentation 
Each participating site will maintain appropriate study documentation (including medical and 
research records) for this trial, in compliance with ICH E6 R2 and regulatory and institutional 
requirements for the protection of confidentiality of participants. Study documentation includes all 
CRFs, workbooks, source documents, monitoring logs, sponsor-investigator correspondence, 
and signed protocol and amendments, ERC or IRB correspondence and approved consent form 
and signed participant consent forms. As part of participating in a NIDA-sponsored study, each 
site will permit authorized representatives from NIDA and regulatory agencies to examine (and 
when permitted by [CONTACT_2371], to copy) clinical records for the purposes of quality assurance reviews, 
audits, and evaluation of the study safety, progress, and data validity. 
Source documents include all recordings of observations or notations of clinical activities and all 
reports and records necessary for the evaluation and reconstruction of the clinical research study. 
Whenever possible, the original recording of an observation should be retained as the source 
document; however, a photocopy is acceptable provided that it is a clear, legible, and exact 
duplication of the original document. 
 Protocol Deviations 
This protocol defines a protocol deviation as any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol. 
The noncompliance may be either on the part of the participant, the investigator, or the study site 
staff. As a result of deviations, corrective actions will be developed by [CONTACT_48162].  
These practices are consistent with ICH GCP:  
• Section 4.5 Compliance with Protocol, subsections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3 
• Section 5.1 Quality Assurance and Quality Control, subsection 5.1.1 
• Section 5.20 Noncompliance, subsections 5.20.1, and 5.20.2.

63 Any departure from procedures and requirements outlined in the protocol will be classified as 
either a major or minor protocol deviation. The difference between a major and minor protocol 
deviation has to do with the seriousness of the event and the corrective action required. A minor 
protocol deviation is considered an action (or inaction) that by [CONTACT_200884], rights, or welfare of a study 
participant. Major protocol deviations are departures that may compromise the participant safety, 
participant rights, inclusion/exclusion criteria or the integrity of study data and could be cause for 
corrective actions if not rectified or prevented from re-occurrence. Sites will be responsible for 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_9818]. Those 
corrective action plans may be reviewed/approved by [CONTACT_362573]. All protocol deviations will be monitored at each site for (1) 
significance, (2) frequency, and (3) impact on the study objectives, to ensure that site performance 
does not compromise the integrity of the trial. 
All protocol deviations will be recorded. 
Additionally, each site is responsible for reviewing the IRB of record’s definition of a protocol 
deviation or violation and understanding which events need to be reported. Sites must recognize 
that the CTN and IRB definition of a reportable event may differ and act accordingly in following 
all reporting requirements for both entities. 
 Safety Monitoring 
 Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) 
An independent CTN DSMB will examine accumulating data to assure protection of participants’ 
safety while the study’s scientific goals are being met. The CTN DSMB is responsible for 
conducting periodic reviews of accumulating safety and efficacy data. It will provide an opi[INVESTIGATOR_362509], or evidence that study procedures should be 
changed, or if the trial should be halted, for reasons relating to the safety of the study participants, 
the efficacy of the treatment under study, or inadequate trial performance (e.g., poor recruitment). 
 Safety Events 
This study is being conducted at the provider level using CDS prompts for evidence-based best 
practice standards related to OUD. As such, we are not trying to change the standard of care for 
OUD in primary care, but rather to help PCPs achieve this standard of care in their care of patients 
with OUD. Prior to implementation, we will train all intervention PCPs and their rooming staff on 
the importance of helpi[INVESTIGATOR_360273]-misses that may be related to the 
EHR or CDS. We will systematically educate them in identification of potential safety events and 
near-misses and informing us of these events via use of the Feedback Tab in the CDS or email. 
We will also ask PCPs to notify us of any clinical situations where their clinical judgment differs 
from the CDS. Use of the Feedback Tab automatically generates an email that is sent to the study 
team. The study team then discusses this feedback and any necessary actions, and connects 
with the PCP to answer the question, discuss steps taken to address the issue, or gather 
additional information and further trouble-shoot. In addition, at HealthPartners, the emails of Drs. 
Rossom and Sperl-Hillen are listed on the CDS interface for providers, and PCPs are encouraged 
to contact [CONTACT_360326]’d rather not use the Feedback Tab in 
NIDA CTN-[ADDRESS_451660] with questions or concerns. All PCP feedback will be 
provided to the DSMB twice per year. 
This is a minimal risk study. Adverse events and Serious Adverse events are not collected in the 
context of this trial. ED Visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], Overdose events and deaths (all cause) will be 
captured through data pulls. 
The site will follow local standard operating procedures (SOPs) for managing any medical or 
psychiatric emergencies.

65 15.0 DATA MANAGEMENT 
 Design and Development 
The OUD-CDS itself will house the algorithms, communicate with and display within the EHR, 
and store data required to assess study objectives in a secure analytic database at 
HealthPartners Institute. These data, supplemented by [CONTACT_362574], will be used to assess 
CDS use rates, diagnosis of OUD, treatment of and referral for treatment of OUD, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_362510]. Data collected from the PCPs, patients and leadership via 
surveys will be collected and housed by [CONTACT_362575]. 
 Site Responsibilities 
Investigators at each site, including a clinical champi[INVESTIGATOR_47003], will be responsible for leading 
healthcare system engagement with clinic and administrative leaders, and for partnering with 
Emmes to facilitate survey administration. An EPIC programmer at each site will be responsible 
for helpi[INVESTIGATOR_362511]-CDS to run at the 
site. A data programmer at each site will be responsible for pulling preliminary Clarity data at each 
site to allow for harmonization of medication, lab, diagnosis and other data between each site and 
HealthPartners. In partnership with each site’s study team, we will determine whether qualitative 
work at that site will be done by a site co-investigator or by [CONTACT_362576]’ team. Encounter 
data will be collected by [CONTACT_46251]-CDS itself from each care system, and each care system’s data 
will be maintained separately on secure servers. The data programmer at each partner site will 
pull Clarity data to assess such outcomes as orders placed outside of the OUD-CDS tool, 
emergency department visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. 
 Data Collection/Acquisition and Entry 
Much of the data for this study will be collected directly by [CONTACT_46251]-CDS tool and stored on secure 
servers at HealthPartners behind multiple firewalls accessible only by [CONTACT_4144]. 
Programmers at each partner site will pull data from Clarity to assess such outcomes as orders 
placed outside of the OUD-CDS tool, ED visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_362512], 
where these data will be stored on secure servers behind multiple firewalls and only accessible 
by [CONTACT_4144]. 
 Qualitative Data 
All qualitative data will be collected and stored by [CONTACT_129583], with master files of all qualitative 
data stored at the main site. Original audio files will be kept on-site behind secure firewalls until 
transcription is complete. Verbatim transcripts of audio-recorded interviews will be made and de-
identified before being stored on local, secure servers. All sites will collaborate on analysis of 
original, de-identified transcript data. Transcripts will be stored on secure servers behind multiple 
firewalls at each site. All field notes and other observation data will be kept by [CONTACT_25733]. Sites will 
contribute non-primary field note data to the study-wide implementation log described above, kept 
by [CONTACT_362577]. All qualitative data will be stored in a de-identified format until study 
completion. All identifiable qualitative data (audio recordings, speaker IDs) will be destroyed when 
analysis is complete.

Data and Safety Monitoring Plan Template 
1.0 BRIEF STUDY OVERVIEW 
Through CTN-0076-Ot, our team has developed and pi[INVESTIGATOR_31219] a web-based and EHR-integrated 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2442] (OUD) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system to offer expert guidance to 
primary care providers (PCPs) on the management of OUD. The OUD-CDS has been 
implemented within the EPIC electronic health record (EHR) of one large care system and was 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_60528] [ADDRESS_451666] effectiveness of the OUD-CDS. This study will randomize 
a minimum of 30 clinics to receive the OUD-CDS intervention or usual care (UC) across three 
large diverse healthcare systems. In intervention clinics, the OUD-CDS will identify patients at 
high risk for OUD, display the OUD-CDS and store analytic data from all eligible visits. In UC 
clinics, the OUD-CDS will run invisibly in the background to identify high risk patients and store 
analytic data.  
2.0 OVERSIGHT OF CLINICAL RESPONSIBILITIES 
A. Site Principal Investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_9842]’s Principal Investigator (PI) is responsible for study oversight, including 
ensuring human research subject protection by [CONTACT_9939], trained 
research staff and by [CONTACT_362578]. 
B. CCC Medical Monitor 
It is not anticipated that a CCC Medical Monitor will be assigned to this study. Drs. Rossom and 
Sperl-Hillen and the Site PIs for Sites [ADDRESS_451667] (DSMB) 
An independent CTN DSMB will monitor this study. The CTN DSMB is responsible for conducting 
periodic reviews of accumulating safety and efficacy data. It will provide an opi[INVESTIGATOR_362515], or evidence that study procedures should be changed, 
or if the trial should be halted, for reasons relating to the safety of the study participants, the 
effectiveness of the intervention under study, or inadequate trial performance (e.g., poor 
recruitment). 
Following each DSMB meeting, the NIDA CCTN will communicate the outcomes of the meeting, 
based on DSMB recommendations, in writing to the study Lead Investigator. This communication 
summarizing study safety information will be submitted to participating IRBs.

Confidential  
73 D. Quality Assurance (QA) Monitoring 
Quality assurance monitoring will be accomplished via pre-implementation testing to confirm that 
the CDS is collecting and storing the data as expected. After implementation and throughout the 
intervention phase, data will be repeatedly tested to ensure all data elements necessary for 
analysis are collected from all three sites on secure servers, and [CONTACT_360336] will conduct periodic 
test analyses to ensure that all the data she requires for analysis are complete. Additionally, Drs. 
Rossom and Sperl-Hillen and investigators from Sites [ADDRESS_451668] participant identifiers on-site, as well as secure computing procedures for collecting, storing, 
entering and transferring electronic data. Any documents or logs linking study codes with study 
participants  on-site will be kept locked/secured separately from the study files and the medical 
records. No identifying information will be disclosed in reports, publications or presentations. 
Information That Meets Reporting Requirements 
We anticipate that the IRB of record will grant a waiver of consent for PCPs and patients to 
participate in the OUD-CDS intervention. PCPs will be using the OUD-CDS during their care of 
patients, and PCPs are required to report any suspected or known sexual or physical abuse of a 
child or elders to the appropriate authorities. PCPs are also expected to act on patient threats of 
violence to self and/or others. 
Participant Protection 
PCP participant protection: This study will provide OUD-CDS to approximately half of randomized 
primary care clinics and their employed PCPs. Practice decisions made during the course of any 
patient encounters will not be reported to the practice group, thus preventing adverse employment 
or incentive-based decisions being made solely as a result of study participation. 
Patient participant protection: With this work, we are not attempting to change the standard of 
care for OUD treatment in primary care, but rather are attempting to help PCPs achieve this 
standard of care in OUD treatment. There is a small but important risk that the OUD-CDS may 
malfunction or provide inaccurate information. PCPs will be trained that, as with other clinical 
decision tools, the OUD-CDS is meant to supplement but not supersede clinical judgment. PCPs 
can choose to follow or not follow the guidance of the CDS at any given time for any given patient. 
PCPs will be asked to use the Feedback Tab within the tool to let the team know of questions or 
potential errors in the CDS. Additionally, PCPs are trained to let the research team know via the 
Feedback Tab when their clinical judgment is inconsistent with the CDS. This feedback will be 
monitored by [CONTACT_360296]. 
Pregnancy 
There are algorithms specific to treatment of pregnant women in the OUD-CDS. At HealthPartners 
clinics, for example, it is recommended that all pregnant women at high risk for OUD be referred 
to the Healthy Beginnings program for treatment by [CONTACT_5019]-risk perinatologists and consideration of 
treatment with monotherapy buprenorphine for OUD. There are also algorithms that recommend 
NIDA CTN-[ADDRESS_451669] makes suggestions for 
patient care that are meant to supplement but not supersede clinical judgment. PCPs can choose 
to follow or not follow the guidance of the CDS at any given time in any given patient encounter. 
PCPs will be trained to let the research team know via the Feedback Tab in the CDS when their 
clinical judgment leads them to a different action than that suggested by [CONTACT_46255]. These events 
will be monitored by [CONTACT_360330]. Every clinical encounter requires medical judgment and poses some element of risk to 
patients. In the situation of a PCP who is unfamiliar or uncomfortable with OUD, use of the CDS 
will likely make care safer by [CONTACT_360331], and to encourage referrals when patients are classified as high risk. We will not be 
encouraging buprenorphine use in non-certified providers, and this will be reinforced thoroughly 
in provider training on the CDS. For buprenorphine-certified providers, the use of the CDS may 
improve the likelihood of using Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) in high risk situations; 
however, the risks of MAT are generally considered lower than untreated OUD in high-risk 
situations.  
3.0 DATA MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES 
This protocol will utilize a centralized Data and Statistics Center (DSC). A web-based distributed 
data entry model will be implemented. This electronic data capture system will be developed to 
ensure that guidelines and regulations surrounding the use of computerized systems in clinical 
trials are upheld. Data collected by [CONTACT_46251]-CDS and from Clarity pulls will be stored on secure 
servers behind multiple firewalls at HealthPartners Institute in a secure project folder only 
accessible by [CONTACT_21575]. 
4.0 DATA AND STATISTICS CENTER RESPONSIBILITIES 
The DSC will: 1) develop and apply data management procedures to ensure the collection of 
accurate and good-quality survey data, 2) prepare instructions for the use of the electronic data 
capture system, 3) conduct ongoing monitoring activities on study data collected from all 
participating sites, and 4) perform survey data cleaning activities as necessary prior to the transfer 
of data resulting from the conduct of each survey. There will be no interim monitoring analyses 
for this study.  
5.0 DATA MONITORING, CLEANING AND EDITING 
All OUD-CDS, Clarity and interview data will be monitored, cleaned and edited at HealthPartners 
Institute on secure servers and accessible only by [CONTACT_3462]. Survey data will be monitored, 
cleaned and edited by [CONTACT_9928].

75 6.0 DATABASE LOCK AND TRANSFER 
At the conclusion of data collection for each survey, the DSC will perform final data cleaning 
activities and will “lock” the survey database from further modification. The final analysis dataset 
will be transferred to the Lead Investigator or designee. De-identified versions of these datasets 
will also be provided to the NIDA CCTN-designated parties for posting on Datashare, as well as 
storage and archiving.

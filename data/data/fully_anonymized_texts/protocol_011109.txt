1.  PROTOCOL TITLE :  Enhancing Prolonged Exposure with Cannabidiol to Treat PTSD  [ADDRESS_838950]    46 
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is considered a signature [CONTACT_629258]. When left [ADDRESS_838951] half of military patients fail to benefit from 49 
treatment. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8321] (Cannabidiol [CBD]) is an FDA -approved, non -controlled prescription medication with promising [ADDRESS_838952] 54 
of care prolonged exposure (PE) psychotherapy to reduce PTSD symptoms (Aim 1). We will also assess possible 55 
biochemical and physiological outcomes associated with treatment (Aim 2) and evaluate the relationship between 56 
changes in biochemical/physiological measures with PTSD symptom reductions (Aim 3). To address study aims, we will 57 
enroll 24 individuals with PTSD to be randomized to CBD (n=12) or placebo (n=12) and all participants will receive 10 58 
daily sessions of PE.  59 
3.  OBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS/RESEARCH QUESTIONS  [ADDRESS_838953] will be a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], double -blind randomized controlled trial of CBD effects to pursue three goals: (1) to 61 
demonstrate the safety and feasibility of using CBD to reduce PTSD symptoms in conjunction with massed PE (mPE); (2) 62 
to assess biochemical and physiological outcomes associated with PTSD treatment; and (3) to evaluate the possible 63 
relationship between changes in biochemical/physiological measures with PTSD symptom reductions.  64 
 65 
Aim 1 : To examine the safety, feasibility, and PTSD symptom reductions associated with CBD (n=12) vs. placebo (n=12) [ADDRESS_838954] of care for PTSD.  67 
Hypothesis 1 : Combining CBD with mPE will be safe based on minimal (< 5%) adverse events and no serious adverse 68 
events related to treatment in the study.  69 
Hypothesis 2 : A CBD vs. placebo trial design will be feasible defined as 75% or more of assessed individuals meeting 70 
all eligibility criteria and 80% or more of CBD participants completing all 10 mPE sessions.  71 
Hypothesis 3 : Participants in the CBD condition will have greater treatment -related PTSD reductions than placebo as 72 
measured by [CONTACT_26055] (CAPS -5)[ADDRESS_838955] (PCL -5).4 73 
Aim 2 : To evaluate biochemical and physiological levels associated with the eCB system and stress response in CBD vs. 74 
placebo.  75 
Hypothesis 4 : Participants in the CBD condition will have higher levels of AEA and 2 -AG, and lower levels of cortisol 76 
than placebo following treatment.  77 
Hypothesis 5 : Participants in the CBD condition will have lower average heart rate during exposure therapy sessions 78 
than placebo.  79 
Aim 3 : To determine the association between changes in biomarker levels (cortisol, AEA, 2-AG), physiology (heart rate), 80 
and PTSD symptom reduction following treatment.  81 
Hypothesis 6 : Reductions in cortisol and increases in AEA and 2 -AG will be associated with PTSD symptom reductions 82 
following treatment.  83 
Hypothesis 7 : Lower average heart rate observed during exposure therapy sessions will be associated with PTSD 84 
symptom reductions following treatment.  85 
4.  MILITARY RELEVANCE  86 
As compared to civilians, t he rate of PTSD is particularly elevated among military populations, with approximately 23% of 87 
military vs. 6 -8% of civilians meeting criteria for PTSD.[ADDRESS_838956] service members their military 89 
careers and veterans with PTSD are at increased risk of unemployment and homelessness following military separation.6 90 
Notwithstanding evidence that PE is an effective treatment for PTSD, there remains room for improvement in outcomes 91 
given that a large proportion of patients (~50%) fail to significantly benefit from treatment.[ADDRESS_838957] deployed to Afghanistan, 94 
Iraq, and surrounding locations in support of military combat operations since September 11, 2001, the need for effective 95 
treatment for PTSD is critical.  Research dedicated to target mechanisms associated with PTSD symptomatology has the 96

21-711H, Straud, Form BB, [ADDRESS_838958] of PTSD is substantial and often leads to significant burdens on the individual, their family, and the 103 
community.12 The sequalae of PTSD not only impacts an individual’s immediate environment but also places significant 104 
burden on society due to increased work sick days and greater healthcare utilization.6,11 The rate of PTSD is particularly 105 
elevated among military populations, with approximately 23% of military meeting criteria for PTSD annually.[ADDRESS_838959] and are well - 112 
established.13 PE is a type of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and one of the most widely used first -line interventions 113 
for PTSD. PE has been validated across various populations and trauma types.e.g.,14–16 Preliminary evidence suggests that 114 
PE can even be effectively delivered in deployed settings, potentially helpi[INVESTIGATOR_629216] 115 
being aeromedically evacuated out of theater.17 PE aims to reduce trauma -related distress and PTSD symptomatology 116 
through extinction learning interventions (i.e., repeated exposure) to internal (e.g., trauma memory) and external (e.g., 117 
environmental stimuli) trauma cues under objectively safe conditions. Notwithstanding evidence that PE is an effective 118 
treatment for PTSD, there remains room for improvement in outcomes given that a large proportion of patients (~50%) fail [ADDRESS_838960] commonly used approach to treat PTSD in civilians and military veterans.18 The only 127 
pharmacological interventions for PTSD approved by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) are the selective serotonin 128 
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fluoxetine and sertraline. Although approved by [CONTACT_629244], these drugs [ADDRESS_838961]-line option for treatment of PTSD. Unfortunately, this state of pharmacotherapy for PTSD has prompted many 132 
providers to use polypharmacy in which patients are prescribed a combination of medications with little to no empi[INVESTIGATOR_10477] 133 
guidance on either the benefits or adverse reactions.22 134 
Endocannabinoid System and PTSD. One potential reason for the low efficacy of SSRIs and the use of 135 
polypharmacotherapy is that these medications do not directly target PTSD symptomatology. A rapi[INVESTIGATOR_629217] 136 
evidence has highlighted the endocannabinoid (eCB) system as a critical regulator of the stress response.23 Further, it has 137 
been suggested that psychological trauma can lead to long -term alterations in the eCB system.24 The eCB system is a 138 
neuromodulatory system comprised of two primary receptors (CB1 and CB2), two main neurotransmitters (anandamide 139 
[AEA] and 2 -arachidonylglycerol [2 -AG]), and several enzymes that synthesize and degrade these neurotransmitters.[ADDRESS_838962] densities in brain regions associated with anxiety and fear learning (e.g., cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus). [ADDRESS_838963] been devoted to pharmacotherapy options. The recently 150 
FDA-approved prescription medication, Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8321] (Cannabidiol [CBD]) is a cannabis -derived, non -controlled drug that may 151

21 be beneficial for PTSD. Existing research has shown that CBD may facilitate extinction learning, decrease anxiety, and 152 
improve mood and sleep, all of which might enhance the effectiveness of mPE for PTSD.30,31 Furthermore, CBD is well 153 
tolerated, even in large doses, and has not been shown to produce adverse side effects associated with other cannabis - 154 
derived medications (e.g., dependence, withdrawal, psychoactive effects, increased anxiety, memory and concentration 155 
difficulties, slowed reaction time, coordination problems, and elevated heart rate). Thus, CBD may be able to maximize [ADDRESS_838964] 169 
pharmacotherapy for PTSD had produced only limited and acute symptom relief.38 In a retrospective case series analysis 170 
of adults (N=11) with PTSD, participants received oral CBD in combination with routine psychiatric and psychotherapy 171 
care over 8 weeks.2 Results suggested that CBD was associated with a 28% decrease in PTSD symptom and was well 172 
tolerated (with no discontinuation due to side effects) among participants. Though these findings suggest that CBD may [ADDRESS_838965] the potential to improve outcomes among military and civilians with PTSD and mitigate the personal, social, and 189 
economic costs of this debilitating, chronic condition. This study will also expand understanding of the relationship 190 
between PTSD, CBD, and the eCB system.  191 
6.  RESEARCH DESIGN  192 
This study is an early Phase II double -blind, pi[INVESTIGATOR_473252]. We will use a permuted block 193 
randomization design stratified by  [CONTACT_629245] 51  on the PCL-5 and population type (military or 194 
civilian). The median score stratification was derived from a recently completed  STRONG STAR randomized clinical trial 195 
of military veterans seeking treatment for PTSD  (manuscript in press) . The decision to stratify by [CONTACT_629246] 196 
existing literature that has found differences in treatment response between military and civilian samples (e.g., Steenkamp 197 
et al., 2015; Straud et al., 2019).  Participants will be 24 individuals  with PTSD to investigate the safety, feasibility, and 198 
PTSD symptom change  associated with CBD 250mg  taken twice a day for 18days (n=12) vs. placebo (n=12) in [ADDRESS_838966] of care, 10 -session s mPE psychotherapy  administered over 2 weeks . Aims 2 and 3 will 200 
evaluate biochemical and physiological outcomes associated with eCB and PTSD that may be affected by [CONTACT_58649]. 201 
Permuted block randomization is advantageous in small clinical trials to ensure equal allocation of participants in each 202 
condition. Participant randomization will be subdivided into randomized blocks of four, two patients in each block will be 203 
assigned to CBD and two will be assigned to placebo . Randomization will occur after the participant consents to the study 204 
and eligibility is determined. John Roache, PhD (Co -Mentor on this KL2) will determine randomization codes and 205 
coordinate with the compounding pharmacy (Oakdell Pharmacy) providing the medication and placebo for this trial to 206

Interventions.  336 
Participants will be randomized to either Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8321] (CBD) or placebo. All participants will receive 10 sessions of mPE  337 
administered weekdays over 2 weeks .  338 
 339 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8321] (CBD)  is an FDA approved, non -controlled prescription medication indicated for the treatment of seizure 340 
disorders. Prior research has demonstrated the safety and early positive benefits of off -label use of CBD for Anxiety and 341 
Trauma -Related symptoms in humans. CBD comes in a 100 -mL bottle containing 100 mg of CBD per ml of strawberry - 342 
flavored liquid solution that is taken using an oral syringe. Strawberry -flavored liquid solution is also available for Oakdell 343 
pharmacy to create a comparable placebo to maintain the blind. Starting recommended dose is 2.5 mL (250mg) taken 344 
twice daily (total = 5 mL/500mg) in the morning and evening after meals.1 We will employ this dosing recommendation for 345 
this study for 18 consecutive days. Steady state has been shown to occur in 2 days.41 To ensure maintenance on an 346 
adequate steady state dose for all randomized participants, we will begin medication 3 days prior to the start of mPE. CBD 347 
and matching placebo for this study will be obtained through Oakdell Pharmacy which will obtain a sufficient supply of 348 
CBD for 12 participants from their supplying manufacturer. They will then prepare CBD (n = 12) and matching placebo (n 349 
=12) dosage for 24 participants in blinded containers that will be numbered per the randomization design. The medication 350 
and placebo will be dispensed to a trained study team member and transported in a locked container to the STRONG 351 
STAR Clinic where it will be stored in a locked cabinet until the participant arrives to receive the medication at the 352 
medication review appointment 3 days prior to beginning mPE.  353 
 354 
Massed Prolonged  Exposure (mPE) . Prolonged Exposure (PE) is a first -line, empi[INVESTIGATOR_629234] 355 
treatment for PTSD and serves as the foundation for mPE.16 mPE, delivered daily Monday through Friday over two 356 
weeks, utilizes exposure -based interventions to target psychological mechanisms (i.e., experiential and behavioral 357 
avoidance; maladaptive cognitive changes) that are thought to maintain trauma -related symptoms. Ten [ADDRESS_838981] spaced PE therapy manual, mPE includes four primary treatment components: (1) 363 
psychoeducation on common reactions to trauma; (2) relaxation training; (3) in vivo exposure; and (4) imaginal exposures. 364 
In vivo exposure involves approaching avoided situations, people, places, and/or objects that are realistically safe.  With 365 
imaginal exposure, participants repeatedly and systematically revisit their trauma memory and related thoughts and 366 
feelings. Participants also will be asked to complete homework, including reviewing treatment materials, listening to 367 
recordings of their imaginal exposure, and completing in vivo exposures. Since mPE requires considerable time and 368 
effort, the study team will work with the participant to receive a release from work while participating in the treatment.  369

severity scores on measures of depression, general anxiety, disability, and PTSD -related cognitions.  484 
Biospecimens & Heart Rate Monitoring Measures : We will also assess possible biochemical and physiological 485 
outcomes associated with treatment (Aim 2) and evaluate the relationship between changes in biochemical/physiological 486 
measures with PTSD symptom reductions (Aim 3). To address these aims we will collect blood and saliva samples and 487

8.0. RISKS/BENEFITS ASSESSMENT  532 
 533 
8.1. Risks.  534 
 535 
Likely, but Not Serious Risks : 536 
 537 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8321] (CBD) : CBD is well tolerated in human subjects and is considered a safe drug, with minimal adverse events 538 
(AEs) and low abuse potential.1,41,45 –[ADDRESS_838998] common side effects of CBD can include fatigue, drowsiness, feeling weak, malaise, loss of appetite, diarrhea, skin 540 
rash, insomnia, and viral/fungal infections.  541 
 542 
PTSD & Prolonged Exposure (PE) : Potential risks associated with PTSD assessment and PE therapy can include [ADDRESS_838999] that a small minority experience an increase in symptoms 545 
of PTSD after the initiation of imaginal exposure and for this minority, the distress and increased symptoms are 546 
temporary, are not predictive of poor outcome, and are not associated with increased likelihood of dropout.46 547 
 548 
Biospecimen Collection : Potential risks associated with blood draw may include pain, bruising, infection, lightheadedness, 549 
fainting, blood clots, and bleeding or other discomforts at the blood draw site.  550 
 551 
Rare, but Serious Risks : 552 
CBD : Serious side effects of CBD are very rare but can occur. Serious side effects include liver problems, sedation (e.g., 553 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], loss of coordination, and difficulty with concentration), severe allergic reaction (skin rash, itchiness, flushed  554 
skin, angioedema, difficulty breathing), and in very rare circumstances ( < 1%) suicidal thoughts or behavior.1 555 
 556 
Biospecimen Collection : More rare risks of blood draw may include swelling and/or infection at the needle site, and 557 
thrombosis of the vein due to trauma. Proper training of study team members on biospecimen collection safety 558 
procedures can reduce the risk of contamination, clerical error, infection, injury, misuse of appropriate blood -sampling 559 
devices, and risk when transporting laboratory samples.   560

of 21 Risks to Confidentiality  562 
With the handling of medical and research records there is always the possibility of a breach of confidentiality. We will 563 
maintain patients’ names, contact [CONTACT_3031] (i.e. Identifiers), and all PHI (protected health information) in an encrypted [ADDRESS_839000] participant records.  566 
 567 
Risks of PTSD Diagnosis regardless of Treatment:  568 
Possibility of increased suicidal risk. One of the risks of PTSD both in and out of treatment is attempted suicide, which can  569 
result in death.  570 
 571 
Safeguards for Protecting Participants:  572 
CBD : Participants will be required to complete  a liver function test ( LFT) or provide a copy of recent LFT lab results 573 
(completed within the last 90 days) to the study team prior to randomization to be considered for study eligibility. To 574 
mitigate unnecessary LFTs, candidates will complete the full assessment to determine eligibility. If the candidate is 575 
deemed eligible, the final step of the assessment process will be to complete an LFT or provide a copy of a recent (LFT).  [ADDRESS_839001] 581

of the platelet inhibitors Clopi[INVESTIGATOR_629238] .  These participants will be monitored for AEs on a more frequent basis 585 
(daily at each session). Additionally, consultation between the study team and [CONTACT_8675] may occur on a more regular basis 586 
regarding potential medication/health risk and additional risk management procedures.  Individuals on medications with 587 
known drug -drug interactions may also complete an additional LFT during study participation.  588 
 589 
All participants will complete the STRONG STAR Health Questionnaire and the Prior and Concomitant Medications 590 
Interview at the baseline assessment. These measures assess  medical and psychiatric diagnoses, current prescription 591 
and over the counter medication use, and caffeine use. Prior to enrollment in the study, Van King , MD (physician 592 
collaborator) and Casey Straud, PsyD (principal investigator) will review participants’ Health Questionnaire  and [ADDRESS_839003] on Day 1 (beginning of mPE), Day 5 -Interim 599 
Assessment, Day 10 -Interim Assessment, and at the 1 -month follow -up. For participants identified as being at high risk for 600 
a health/medication -related AE or drug -drug interaction, ineligibility will be considered if it is unlikely that standard 601 
treatment plus additional risk management procedures (i. e., adverse event monitoring at every visit) will maintain safety. [ADDRESS_839004].

Assessment  2 (PE Session 5) , Interim Assessment  3 (PE Session 10) , and at the [ADDRESS_839010] emergency room.  636 
 637 
Biospecimen Collection : To reduce the risk of AEs for study participants, all staff members collecting biospecimens will be 638 
trained in procedures to reduce the risk of contamination, clerical error, infection, injury, use of appropriate blood -sampling 639 
devices, and safe transportation of laboratory samples via IATA guidelines. When collecting or handling biospecimens, 640 
staff members will wear well -fitting, non -sterile gloves, and carry out hand hygiene before and after each patient 641 
procedure, before putting on gloves and after removing them. To reduce the risk of environmental contamination with 642 
pathogens, the blood draw room will be appropriately sanitized before and after each blood draw and saliva collection. To 643 
prevent infections and other AEs, health workers should follow the guidelines on patient identification, hand hygiene, use 644 
of gloves, skin disinfection, use of appropriate blood -sampling devices and safe transportation of laboratory samples.  645

Participation in the study may be discontinued by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_629240] a 668 
danger to a participant’s welfare. Reasons for discontinuation include: 1) a serious AE such that continued participation 669 
would be a danger to the participant; 2) clinical worsening for any reason that is deemed to necessitate non -study 670 
psychological or medical treatment; 3) exacerbation of PTSD, anxiety, or depressive symptoms that the participant cannot 671 
tolerate; or 4) drug interactions from concomitant medications that the participant cannot tolerate or would be a danger to 672 
the participant;  or 5) discontinuation would be in the participant's best interest. Participants deemed candidates for 673 
discontinuation will be discussed in conference calls with relevant study team members and will be brought to the 674 
attention of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_629241]. Participants who are discontinued from the study for any 675

1. Demographics and Military Service Characteristics Form :  The Demographics Form measures standard demographics 701 
(race, gender, age) and military service information (e.g., rank).   This measure will be administered at the baseline [ADDRESS_839018] -5 (LEC -5).[ADDRESS_839019] of 24 potentially traumatic life events commonly associated with 705 
PTSD symptoms. The instrument was designed to facilitate the diagnosis of PTSD. In this study, the LEC -5 will also be 706 
used to identify the index event and focus of the PTSD treatment. For each potentially traumatic life event, respondents 707 
rate their experience of that event on a 5 -point nominal scale (1 = happened to me, 2 = witnessed it, 3 = learned about it, 708 
4 =part of my job, 5= not sure, and 6 = does not apply). Each nominal point will be scored separately, as either 0 (=not 709 
endorsed by [CONTACT_3445]) or 1 (=endorsed by [CONTACT_3445]). This measure will be administered at the baseline assessment.  710

8. The Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM -5 (CAPS -5).3 The CAPS -5 is structured interview that assesses the 752 
DSM -5 criteria for PTSD. Each item is rated on a severity scale ranging from 0 (Absent) to 4 (Extreme/incapacitating) and [ADDRESS_839027] for evaluating PTSD and demonstrated good reliability and validity. In 758 
addition to reflecting diagnostic changes for PTSD in DSM -5, the CAPS -5 differs from the CAPS in that frequency and 759 
intensity ratings for each symptom are no longer scored separately, so the severity rating for each item determines 760 
whether a symptom is present or not. Subscale scores are calculated by [CONTACT_629256] 761 
following PTSD symptom clusters: re -experiencing, avoidance, negative alterations in cognitions and mood, and 762 
hyperarousal. Scores ≥ [ADDRESS_839028] -5 (PCL -5).[ADDRESS_839029] week (for all 768 
assessments during treatment) or the past two weeks (all other assessment time points) as a result of a specific life event.  769 
Each item of the PCL -5 is scored on a five-point  scale ranging from 0 “not at all”) to 4 (“extremely). This measure will be 770 
administered at the baseline assessment, the interim assessments, and the one -month follow -up assessment.  771

groups. This measure will be administered at the baseline assessment , interim assessments,  and the one -month follow - 793 
up assessment.  794 
 795 
12. Brief Inventory of Psychosocial Functioning (BIPF).55 The BIPF is a 7 -item self -report instrument measuring respondents’ 796 
level of functioning in seven life domains: romantic relationship, relationship with children, family relationships, friendsh ips [ADDRESS_839037] 30 days in each area on a 7 -point scale ranging from “0 = Not at all” to “6 = Very much.” This 799 
measure will be administered at the baseline assessment, and the one -month follow -up assessment.  800

among service members redeployed for combat, it is critical to pay close attention to functional capacities as an important 803 
index of intervention efficacy.  The Veterans SF -36 (VR -36) was adapted from the RAND SF -[ADDRESS_839039] modification is an increase in the number of response choices for the role physical (RP) and role 806 
emotional (RE) items from a two  point yes/no choice to a five -point likert scale (no, none of the time, yes, a little of the [ADDRESS_839040] of the time, yes, all of the time).  The second modification is the use of two items t o [ADDRESS_839041] to the one general 809 
change item in the RAND SF -36.56 The VR -36 has been widely used, distributed and documented in the Veterans Health 810 
Administration (VHA) with close to [ADDRESS_839042] increased the overall precision of the instrument and the discriminant validity of the physical 812 
and mental component summary scales.57 The VR -36 is comprised of 37 items and eight scales:  physical functioning, 813 
role limitations due to physical problems, bodily pain, general health perceptions, energy/ vitality, social functioning, rol e 814 
limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health. Also, there are two summary scales:  a physical component 815 
summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS). Higher scores indicate better health. Each summary is [ADDRESS_839043] 90% of the reliable variance in the eight SF -36 concepts. The Veterans SF -12 was 818 
developed from the Veterans SF -36 and adapted from the MOS SF -36. It includes fewer items for seven of the eight 819 
scales and provides 90% of the reliable variance in the two component summary measures using the Veterans SF -36. 820 
Using independent results from the Veterans Health Study and the 1996 National Survey of Ambulatory Care Patients, the 821 
results for the Veterans SF -12 corresponded very closely with the results for the Veterans SF -36 (average differences of 822 
0.06 points between them for PCS and 0.31 points for MCS). This measure will be administered at the baseline 823 
assessment and the one -month follow -up assessment  and only among participants who identify as a military veteran .  824

14. Quick Drinking Screen (QDS).[ADDRESS_839044] two weeks. 828 
The average total drinks consumed per week can also be calculated by [CONTACT_629257] 1 (average number of drinking 829 
days per week) and 2 (average drinks per day). This measure will be administered at the baseline assessment and the 830 
one-month follow -up assessment. At the baseline assessment, the PI (Casey Straud, PsyD) and physician collaborator 831 
(Van King , MD) will review QDS scores to determine if the screened individual demonstrates clinically significant alcohol 832 
abuse that warrants exclusion from the study.  This measure will be administered at the baseline assessment and the one - 833 
month follow -up assessment.  834

additional follow -up questions are asked to determine the frequency and severity of use for each substance. Part two of 842

five listed substances described in the exclusion criteria section will be excluded from the study. This measure will be 846 
administered at the baseline assessment and 1 -month follow -up. 847 
 848 
16. Insomnia Severity Index (ISI).60 The ISI is a 7 -item self -report measure that assesses perceived severity of insomnia. 849 
Each item uses a 4 -point Likert type scale from 0 (not at all satisfied) to 4 (very much satisfied). The items sum to produce 850 
a total score (range 0 – 28). The ISI has an internal consistency alpha coefficient of 0.74, and has shown convergent 851 
validity with other measures such as the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272] (r = 0.67), the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes 852 
about Sleep (r = 0.55), and sleep diaries (r ranges from 0.32 -0.91). This measure will be administered at the baseline 853 
assessment and the one -month follow -up assessment.  854 
 855 
17. Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory (PTCI).[ADDRESS_839048] suggested that PTSD is a consequence of 858 
disruptions in the normal processes of recovery when an individual has excessively rigid concepts about self and world 859 
rendering the person vulnerable if a traumatic event occurs. Thus,  the PTCI was developed as a measure of trauma - 860 
related thoughts and beliefs.  It is comprised of three subscales (Negative Cognitions about the Self, Negative Cognitions 861 
about the World, and Self -Blame).  The measure was tested in almost 600 adult volunteers recruited from two university 862 
PTSD treatment clinics as well as a university community.  Approximately 65% (n=392) of individuals reported having 863 
experienced a trauma in which their own life or that of another person was perceived to be in danger and their response at 864 
the time included intense terror, horror, or helplessness (Criterion A event).  The remaining 35% (n=162) denied such a [ADDRESS_839049] moderate severity 866 
while the remaining 185 reported a low symptom severity.  The three subscales of the PTCI demonstrated internal 867 
consistency with alpha coefficients ranging from 0.86 to 0.97.  Convergent validity was demonstrated comparing the PTCI 868 
to appropriate subscales of the World Assumptions Scale and Personal Beliefs and Reactions Scale.  Significant 869 
correlations between the appropriate subscales ranged from 0.20 to 0.85.  The PTCI was able to differentiate individuals 870 
with and without PTSD demonstrating discriminate validity (sensitivity = 0.78, specificity = 0.93).  Test –retest reliability for 871 
each of the three subscales at a 1 -week interval ranged from 0.75 to 0.89 and for a 3 -week interval ranged from 0.80 to 872 
0.86. This measure will be administered at the baseline assessment, the interim assessments, and the one -month follow - 873 
up assessment.  874 
 875 
18. Credibility/ Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ) for PE .62  The CEQ is a 6 -item measure that was designed to assess 876 
treatment expectancy and rationale credibility for use in clinical outcomes studies.  This measure has been utilized across 877 
a number of STRONG STAR treatment trials and can be easily adapted to assess the target intervention(s). For the 878 
current proposed study, the CEQ will be adapted to assess the credibility and expectancy for PE and CBD separately will 879 
be assessed separately from the credibility and expectancy for Cannabidiol.  The 6 -item CEQ assesses both whether the 880 
person cognitively understands how the therapy works (credibility) as well as whether the person affectively believes that 881 
the therapy will work for them personally (expectancy).  The 6 -item CEQ has been tested in 217 individuals including 68 882 
male Vietnam veterans and 58 female spouses, 69 individuals diagnosed with general anxiety disorder who had received 883 
treatment, and 22 individuals who had received either Cognitive Based Therapy (CBT) or Eye Movement Desensitization 884 
and Reprocessing (EMDR) for the treatment of PTSD.  The scale demonstrated high internal consistency (alpha 885 
coefficients ranged from 0.84 to 0.85).   Test -retest reliability over a one -week period was found to be 0.82 for expectancy 886 
and 0.75 for credibility. The CEQ was able to differentiate between two treatment rationales in one study, one with and 887 
one without an encompassing theory while maintaining equivalence between three rationales in another study.  888 
Responses to four questions are scored using a 9 -point Likert scale (1= not at all, 9= extremely).  Responses to two of the 889 
questions are scored using an 11 -point Likert Scale (0% to 100%).  The combined responses are used to generate a 890 
score for credibility and another score for expectancy. This measure will be administered prior to the second PE session 891 
following Session 1 which will review the PE rationale for the treatment of PTSD.  892 
 893 
19. Credibility/ Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ) for CBD . The CEQ is a 6 -item measure that was designed to assess 894 
treatment expectancy and rationale credibility for use in clinical outcomes studies.  The CEQ has been utilized across a 895 
number of STRONG STAR treatment trials and can be easily adapted to assess the target intervention(s). For the current 896

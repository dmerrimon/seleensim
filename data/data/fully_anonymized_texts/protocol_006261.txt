Title of Study: A Phase 3, Multicenter, Doub le-Blind, Randomized, Vehicle Controlled Clinical Study to 
Assess the Safety and Efficacy of IDP-122 in the Treatment of Plaque Psoriasis 
Number of clinical centers:  Multicenter, approximately 12-16 investigational centers in North America 
Objective: 
The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of topi[INVESTIGATOR_249238]-122 Lotion when applied once 
daily to adult subjects with moderate to severe plaque  psoriasis (defined as an Investigator’s Global 
Assessment [IGA] score of 3 or 4). The intent of the study is specifically to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
a once daily application of IDP-122 Lo tion in comparison with vehicle. 
Methodology: 
This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, 
and efficacy of IDP-[ADDRESS_669814] a clinical diagnosis of modera te to severe psoriasis (defined as an IGA score of 
3 or 4). 
Approximately 210 subjects who meet the study entry criteria will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive 
IDP-122 (HP 0.01%) Lotion and IDP-[ADDRESS_669815] at the Baseline visit. The study drug will be applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_516858] (as determined by [CONTACT_45010]) once daily for [ADDRESS_669816]-baseline study visits (Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8) the 
subjects will be asked to return their containers of study drug which will be evaluated for drug usage 
compliance. Upon completion of the 8- week treatment period, all subjects will be asked to return to the 
investigational center [ADDRESS_669817]-treatment cessation follow-up visit (Week 12). During the study, 
subjects will be allowed to use investigator approved non-medicated cleansers, mois turizers and sunscreens; 
no other skin care products will be permitted on the treatment areas. Th e investigator will assess the areas 
affected by [CONTACT_249261]. 
All areas affected by [CONTACT_22803] (with an affected body surface area [BSA] of 3%-12%, inclusive) are to be 
treated with study drug. The affected areas (3%-12% BSA) will not include face, scalp, palms, soles, groin, 
axillae, and intertriginous areas. Informatio n on reported and observed advers e events (AEs) will be obtained 
at each visit. An abbreviated physical examination will be performed at Baseline, Week 8 (end of treatment), and Week 12 (4-week post-treatment ce ssation follow-up visit) for all subjects. 
Blood samples for complete blood count with differential (CBC/Diff) and serum chemistry will be collected 
from subjects at Screening, Week 4, and Week 8. For all female subjects of  childbearing potential, urine and 
serum pregnancy testing will be performed at Screen ing. Urine pregnancy testing will be performed at 
Baseline (prior to randomization) and Week 12 (4-week post-treatment follow-up visit), and serum pregnancy 
testing will also be conducted at Week 4 and Week 8. 
Subjects who terminate study participation early will be asked to complete all Week 8 assessments, as 
appropriate, prior to commencement of any alternative ther apy for psoriasis (if po ssible). Subjects who 
discontinue from the study during the treatment period will not be replaced and these subjects may be asked to 
return for the 4-week follow-up vi sit after the last treatment visit. 
Protocol V01-122A-302, IDP-122 Phase 3  Valeant Research & Development 
Amendment 1, Clinical Study Protocol, [ADDRESS_669818] to temporar ily interrupt use of the study drug and to resume application of the study drug 
once the signs/symptoms have subsid ed. The investigator should try to minimize study drug interruptions; and 
if needed, make best efforts to limit a “drug holiday” to 4 days. If th e study drug interruption does exceed 
4 consecutive days, the investigator sh ould consult with the medical monitor to determine a course of action. If 
the study drug is interrupte d, discontinued, or a concomitant medicati on is used to treat a sign/symptom, an 
adverse event shall be recorded. 
Subjects who discontinue from the study, due to clinically significant laboratory abnormalities or AEs will 
return for the 4-week follow-up  visit after the last treatment visit and w ill be instructed to follow-up with their 
primary care physician, if indicated. If any subject who has an AE, during the treatment period, the subject will be followed by [CONTACT_117186] (retu rn to normal or to the baseline state) or stabilization, 
as determined by [CONTACT_093]. 
In addition, application of study drug ma y be delayed or halted at any time if ongoing safety data evaluations 
(including reports of local skin reactions, such as skin atrophy, or severe AEs) raise concern for subject safety. 
If the subject participation is suspended, all of the subject’s safety data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_516872]. 
Number of subjects planned: 
Approximately 210 adult subjects (approximately 15 subjec ts per investigational ce nter) with moderate or 
severe psoriasis (defined as an IGA score of 3 or 4)  will be enrolled and randomized in the study. With a 
2:1 randomization ratio, it is anticipated that:

20 5 Introduction
Psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated disease that varies widely in its clinical expression. 
Disease severity ranges from mild (limited number of plaques) to very severe. Characteristic features of psoriasis include hyperproliferation of epi[INVESTIGATOR_516862]/epi[INVESTIGATOR_249245], resulting in sharply demarcated red plaques, which may be covered by [CONTACT_516878]. 
There are presently no curative treatments for psoriasis. Treatment options focus on relieving 
symptoms, reducing inflammation, induration, and scaling, and controlling the extent of the disease. Patient age, severity of disease, and the type and extent of body surface area (BSA) involvement are considerations in selecting therapy. 
Biologic treatments are now either available or in development to treat psoriasis. However, 
these treatments are not typi[INVESTIGATOR_249246], and their safety profile is not entirely 
well understood. 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_516863], but may be impractical when psoriasis 
involves a large BSA. The mainstay of psoriasis treatment is topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930], which range in potency from superpotent to low potency (Class I to Class VII, respectively). Generally, the more potent corticosteroids are required for effective management of psoriasis.
Although topi[INVESTIGATOR_249248], long-term safety remains a concern, 
particularly with the more potent ones. Adverse effects such as skin atrophy, telangiectasia, and potential hypothalamic-pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117]-adrenal axis suppression have been associated with higher potency topi[INVESTIGATOR_249249]. Ultravate
® cream and 
ointment (halobetasol propi[INVESTIGATOR_16847] [HP] 0.05%) is currently on the market and are classified as super-high potency (Class I) corticosteroids indicated for the relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses.  
Having a lower concentration product that is a Class I steroid might be advantageous for 
patients, as the steroid provides relief from inflammation, and may reduce the adverse 
reactions associated with a steroid (eg, skin atrophy). 
6 Study Objectives and Purpose 
The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of topi[INVESTIGATOR_249238]-122 Lotion 
when applied once daily to adult subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (defined as an Investigator’s Global Assessment [IGA] score of 3 or 4). The intent of the study is 
specifically to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a once daily application of IDP-122 Lotion 
in comparison with vehicle.

21 7 Investigational plan 
7.1 Overall Study Design and Plan: Description 
This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study designed to assess the 
safety and efficacy of IDP-[ADDRESS_669851] a clinical diagnosis of moderate to severe psoriasis (defined as an IGA score of 3 or 4). 
Approximately 210 subjects who meet the study entry criteria will be randomized in a 
2:1 ratio to receive IDP-122 (HP 0.01%) Lotion and IDP-122 Vehicle Lotion, respectively. The assigned study drug will be applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_516864] (as determined by [CONTACT_180397]) once daily for [ADDRESS_669852]-baseline study visits (Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8) the subjects will be asked to return their used containers of study drug. Subjects will be asked to not apply study drug on day of 
clinic visit so that subject can apply during the visit after assessments are completed. Upon 
completion of the 8-week treatment period, all subjects will be asked to return to the investigational center [ADDRESS_669853]-treatment cessation follow-up visit (Week 12). During the study, each subject will only be permitted to use Investigator approved non-medicated cleansers, moisturizers and sunscreens; no other skin care products will be permitted on the treatment areas. 
The investigator will assess the treatable areas affected by [CONTACT_249261]. All 
treatable areas affected by [CONTACT_249279] (with an affected BSA of 3%-12%) are to be treated with study drug. The treatable affected areas will not include the face, scalp, 
palms, soles, axillae, and intertriginous areas. If palms and soles are affected, study drug may 
be applied at the discretion of the investigator; however, these areas will not be included in treatable BSA or efficacy assessments. 
Information on reported and observed adverse events (AEs) will be obtained at each visit. An 
abbreviated physical examination will be performed at Baseline, Week 8 (end of treatment), and Week 12 (the 4-week post-treatment cessation follow-up visit) for all subjects. 
Blood samples for complete blood count with differential (CBC/Diff) and serum chemistry 
will be collected from subjects at Screening, Week 4, and Week 8. For all female subjects of childbearing potential, urine and serum pregnancy testing will be performed at Screening and 
Protocol V01-122A-302, IDP-122 Phase 3  Valeant Research & Development 
Amendment 1, Clinical Study Protocol, [ADDRESS_669854] will be performed at Week 12 (4-week post-treatment follow-up visit). 
The Dermatology Life Quality Index questionnaire (DLQI) questionnaire will be 
administered to subjects at Day 0 (Baseline), Week 4, Week 8/End of Treatment and Week 12 (4-week post-treatment follow-up visit). 
Subjects who terminate study participation early will be asked to complete all Week 8 
assessments, as appropriate, prior to commencement of any alternative therapy for psoriasis (if possible). Subjects who discontinue from the study during the treatment period will not be replaced and these subjects may be asked to come back for the 4-week post-treatment cessation follow-up visit.

27 Subjects who terminate treatment early will be asked to complete all Week 8 assessments 
prior to commencement of any alternative therapy for psoriasis (if possible). Subjects who discontinue from the study during the treatment period will not be replaced and these subjects will be asked to come back for the 4-week post-treatment cessation follow-up visit. 
All subjects are free to withdraw from participating in this study at any time and for whatever 
reason, specified or unspecified, and without prejudice. No constraints will be placed on ordinary subject management, and subjects, when appropriate, will be placed on other conventional therapy upon request or whenever clinically necessary as determined by [CONTACT_9682].
9 Treatment Plan 
9.1 Methods of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
This is a double-blinded study, in which the identity of the study drug will be unknown to investigator/evaluator and subjects, as well as all individuals closely associated with the study.
Subjects will be randomized to 1 of the 2 study drug groups in a ratio of 2:1 (IDP-122 
[HP 0.01%] Lotion: IDP-122 Vehicle Lotion). Each screened subject will be assigned a unique 6-digit study subject number assigned by [CONTACT_118250], which will consist of the 3-digit investigational center/site number (pre-assigned by [CONTACT_3211]/designee) and the 3-digit chronological screening order number, starting with 001 (e.g., 101001, 101002). The study drug kit will be assigned to subjects based on a randomization code and kits will be dispensed to the subjects at Baseline.  A study drug log will document the inventory and dispensing of study drug at each investigational center.

28 9.3 Unblinding
The treatment assignments for all enrolled subjects will be unblinded only after the 
conclusion of the study. Specifically, the blind will be broken only after all data are verified, entered into the database, and validated; subject evaluability assessments are performed and entered into the database; and the database is locked. 
In the case of a medical emergency, the investigator can break the blind for the subject 
involved preferably by [CONTACT_220142] (or designee) immediately. After confirmation, the investigator will be contact[CONTACT_85193] a sponsor representative. The investigator will record the code break in the subject’s source documents. 
9.[ADDRESS_669864] psoriasis that was previously nonresponsive to prescription medications, per the Investigators’ best clinical judgment. Subjects must also not be using lithium or Plaquenil. Any concomitant therapy stopped for washout as indicated below is to be recorded. As noted in the exclusion criteria, there are mandatory washout periods and restrictions during the study. Specifically: 
x Received treatment with any topi[INVESTIGATOR_516860] [ADDRESS_669865] used any phototherapy (including laser), photochemotherapy, or non-biologic systemic 
psoriasis therapy (such as newer oral psoriasis medications (eg Otezla), systemic corticosteroids, methotrexate, retinoids or cyclosporine)

29 Protocol excluded areas of palms and soles may be treated with study drug but will not be 
included in the BSA or IGA assessments. If palms and soles are treated, they may be evaluated by [CONTACT_516882]. 
Subjects using concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_516867] (including but not limited to those listed above) should not be withdrawn, but the use of the concomitant product should be discontinued. No other topi[INVESTIGATOR_35786] (except as noted above) other than the study drug will be permitted for psoriasis.
Information on concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_249254]. Any therapy used by [CONTACT_516883] (e.g., aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], Tylenol, birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], vitamins, moisturizers, sunscreens). Every attempt should be made to keep concomitant therapy dosing constant during the study. Any change to concomitant therapy should be noted on the Concomitant Therapy source document and eCRF. 
9.[ADDRESS_669867]’s compliance with applying the study drug. A 
subject who deviates significantly from the prescribed application amount will be counseled. Any missed applications of study drug will be noted by [CONTACT_249288], which will be collected and placed in the appropriate source document. Missed applications will be documented in the eCRF. 
9.[ADDRESS_669868] follow the instructions exactly.  
A deviation from the protocol is an unintended and/or unanticipated departure from the 
procedures and/or processes approved by [CONTACT_135785]/IEC and agreed to by [CONTACT_093]. Deviations usually have an impact on individual patients or a small group of patients and do not involve inclusion/exclusion or primary endpoint criteria.

significant, additional risk to the patient, when the patient or investigator has failed to adhere to significant protocol requirements (inclusion/exclusion criteria) and the patient was enrolled without prior sponsor approval, or when there is nonadherence to FDA regulations and/or ICH GCP guideline. 
The investigator or designee must document and explain in the patients’ source 
documentation any deviation from the approved protocol. The investigator may implement a deviation from, or a change of, the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard to study patients without prior IRB/IEC approval. As soon as possible after such an occurrence, the implemented deviation or change, the reasons for it, and any proposed protocol amendment(s) should be submitted to the IRB/IEC for review and approval, to the sponsor for agreement, and to the regulatory authorities, if required.

The collection of nonserious AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) should begin following the subject's completion of the consent process to participate in the study. 
11.5.2 Documenting Adverse Experiences 
It is the responsibility of the investigator to document all AEs that occur during the course of 
the study. The AEs should be documented as a single medical diagnosis. When this is not possible, the AE should be documented in terms of signs and/or symptoms observed by [CONTACT_516890]. 
All AEs occurring after the subject signs the informed consent through the last study visit 
must be reported, regardless of whether or not the AEs are considered drug-related. All AEs, whether in response to a query, observed by [CONTACT_3991], or reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_423], will be recorded. 
At each visit during the study, the subject will be assessed for the occurrence of new and 
ongoing AEs. Cutaneous tolerability signs and symptoms that result in the subject’s requiring a concomitant therapy or discontinuation from the study will be reported as an AE. The following data will be collected on all AEs and recorded on the appropriate eCRF: 
x Event name (diagnosis preferred, if unknown, record the signs/symptoms) 
x Onset date and end date

43 x Maximum intensity (severity) 
x Seriousness
x Action taken regarding study drug 
x Corrective treatment, if given 
x Outcome 
In addition, the investigator’s assessment of causality will be recorded. 
Vital sign abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs only if they are clin ically significant (for 
example: are symptomatic, requiring corrective treatment, leading to discontinuation or 
fulfilling a seriousness criterion). 
11.5.[ADDRESS_669892] medical occurrence that at 
any dose: 
x Results in death 
x Is immediately life threatening, (the term "life threatening" in the definition of 
"serious" refers to an event in which the subject is at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe) 
x Requires in patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22215] a baseline condition is not considered an 
AE)
x Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (permanent or substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
x Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
x Is a medically important event that may not be immediately life threatening or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the above listed outcomes 
Note: A spontaneous abortion will be considered an SAE, and must be reported to the sponsor/designee within 24 hours of your awareness of the event.

44 11.5.4 Assessment of Severity 
The severity assigned to an AE should be determined by [CONTACT_85210]. 
The categories described below should be used to estimate the severity of AEs: 
x Mild: Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention/therapy required 
x Moderate: Mild to moderate limitation in activity; some assistance may be 
needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required 
x Severe: Marked limitation in activity; some assistance usually required; medical 
intervention/therapy required; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85153]; may be incapacitating or life threatening 
11.5.5 Assessment of Causality 
The investigator should assess the relationship of the AE, if any, to the study drug as either “Related” or “Not Related”. The following should be taken into account when assessing SAE causality: 
x Positive temporal relationship to study drug, such as if the study drug was 
withdrawn and the SAE resolved or the event recurred after re introduction. 
x If there is a reasonable possibility that the AE is associated with an underlying or concomitant illness. 
x Possible association with previous or concomitant therapy. 
x No temporal relationship to the study drug and/or a more likely alternative etiology exists.

Adverse events classified as “serious” require expeditious handling and reporting to sponsor 
or designee within [ADDRESS_669893] be immediately reported to the 
medical monitor within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the event. All SAEs must be reported via confirmed facsimile transmission and must be submitted on a written SAE report form signed by [CONTACT_19452] 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the event.

45 The fax number for reporting an SAE is: 
 
 
           
Investigators should not wait to receive additional information to fully document the event 
before notifying Medical Monitor of an SAE. If only limited information is initially available, follow-up reports are required. Additional relevant information such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_516871]/designee as soon as they are available. Should the investigator become aware of an SAE (regardless of its relationship to investigational product) that occurs within [ADDRESS_669894] be reported in accordance with procedures specified in this protocol. 
The investigator should take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety of the subjects, 
notably he/she should follow a subject with an SAE until the event has resolved or the condition has stabilized. This may imply that follow-up will continue after the subject has left the study, and that additional investigations may be requested by [CONTACT_456]. 
11.5.7 Expedited Serious Adverse Event Reports 
An AE, whether serious or nonserious, is designated unexpected (unlabeled) if it is not 
reported in the clinical safety section of the Investigator Brochure or if the event is of greater frequency, specificity or severity. 
Expedited SAE reports are those that are both unexpected based on the reference document 
(Investigator Brochure or Package Insert) and are related (i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out) to the study drug. These expedited reports are subject to reporting timelines of 7 and/or 15 calendar days to the regulatory reporting agency(ies). Valeant Pharmaceuticals will 
notify regulatory authorities of these AEs and all participating investigational centers in 
writing for submission by [CONTACT_85213]/IEC. This notification will be in the form of a Safety Update to the Investigator Brochure (i.e., “15-day letter”). 
Upon receiving such notices, the investigator must review and retain the notice with the 
Investigator Brochure and immediately submit a copy of this information to the responsible IRB/IEC according to local regulations. The investigator and IRB/IEC will determine if the informed consent requires revision. The investigator should also comply with the IRB/IEC procedures for reporting any other safety information. 
11.5.[ADDRESS_669895](s) must be obtained by [CONTACT_249304]’s source documentation. Any laboratory test result that meets the criteria for an SAE must also be reported to the sponsor/designee via written SAE report form signed by [CONTACT_19452] 24 hours of investigational center notification. 

Protocol V01-122A-302, IDP-122 Phase 3 Valeant Research & Development 
Amendment 1, Clinical Study Protocol, [ADDRESS_669896] review the following information about study participation: 
x Informed consent requirements 
x Contraceptives in current use 
Following review of this information and appropriate subject counseling, the investigator or designee and the subject must sign the informed consent before study enrollment. 
During the study, all female subjects of childbearing potential should be instructed to contact 
[CONTACT_28265] (e.g., missed or late menstrual period). 
If a subject or investigator suspects that the subject may be pregnant prior to study 
enrollment, the study drug must be withheld until the results of laboratory pregnancy testing are available. If pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must not receive study drug and must not be enrolled in the study. If pregnancy is suspected while the subject is receiving study treatment, the study drug must immediately be withheld until the result of pregnancy testing is known. If pregnancy is confirmed, the study drug will be permanently discontinued and the subject will be followed until the pregnancy come s to term. A Pregnancy Report form will be 
submitted to the sponsor, initially and at the end of the pregnancy, which includes the outcome of the pregnancy and any complications occurring during the pregnancy or the delivery.
All confirmed pregnancies must be immediately reported to the medical monitor within 24 
hours of the investigator’s awareness of the pregnancy. All confirmed pregnancies must be reported via confirmed facsimile transmission and must be submitted on a written Pregnancy Report form within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the pregnancy. 
12 Statistics
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® unless otherwise stated. No interim 
analyses are planned. Except where noted, all statistical tests will be two-sided and will be performed at the 0.05 level of significance. 
Descriptive statistics will be used to provide an overview of the efficacy and safety results. 
For categorical parameters, the number and percentage of subjects in each category will be presented. For continuous parameters, descriptive statistics will include n (number of subjects), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. Appropriate inferential statistics will be used for the primary and secondary efficacy variables.

47 The primary method of handling missing efficacy data will be the method of Markov Chain 
Monte Carlo (MCMC) multiple imputation. As a sensitivity analysis, the last observation carried forward method (LOCF) will be used (i.e., the last available on-therapy observation for a subject will be used to estimate subsequent missing data points). No imputations will be made for missing safety data. 
A statistical analysis plan (SAP), describing all statistical analyses will be provided as a 
separate document. The SAP will be finalized prior to unblinding of the study treatments.

12.1.4 Pooling Analysis 
The clinical study will be conducted under a common protocol for each investigational site with the intention of pooling the data for analysis. Every effort will be made to promote consistency in study execution at each study site. The study is intended to be conducted in a manner such that a minimum of 15 subjects will be randomized and included in the ITT population (i.e., approximately at least [ADDRESS_669904] 5 subjects in the Vehicle arm) for any investigator. In the event that there are too few subjects in a treatment arm for an investigator, then the investigator’s data will be combined to achieve the desired sample size minimum per treatment arm. The combining of investigator data will be accomplished by [CONTACT_516891], restricted to investigational sites that did not meet minimum 
enrollment. If there is a further need to combine data, then the data of the investigator with the second smallest enrollment will be combined with the investigator's data which had the second largest enrollment, and so on. This process will continue for all investigators who did not have a minimum of 15 subjects enrolled.
Protocol V01-122A-302, IDP-122 Phase 3 Valeant Research & Development 
Amendment 1, Clinical Study Protocol, [ADDRESS_669905] insufficient subjects per treatment arm 
will result in redefining the groups of investigators for the purposes of statistical analyses. These combined groups will be referred to as "analysis centers" in the statistical analyses. 
The consistency of treatment response will be investigated across the analysis centers 
subsequent to combining the data as described above. Statistical tests will be conducted to identify if there are extreme analysis centers that could affect the interpretation of common statistical and clinical conclusions. For the purpose of testing consistency of treatment response, the primary efficacy variable will be considered. The percent of subjects with treatment success at Week [ADDRESS_669906] excluding 1, then 2, then 3, etc, analysis centers until the logistic regression interaction p-value exceeds 0.10. 
Protocol V01-122A-302, IDP-122 Phase 3 Valeant Research & Development 
Amendment 1, Clinical Study Protocol, [ADDRESS_669907] will be investigated to determine if the main site-to-site variability is such that it could mask the analysis center effects. Thus, prior to pooling, the percent of subjects with treatment success at Week 8 will be analyzed with a logistic regression with factors of treatment group, site, and the interaction term of treatment group by [CONTACT_3725]. If the analysis is not computationally feasible due to some sites having very few subjects enrolled, the low-enrolling sites will be excluded from the analysis. 
12.1.5 Missing Efficacy Data Imputations 
The primary method of handling missing efficacy data will be MCMC multiple imputation. 
This method does not rely on the assumption of data missing at random. Additionally, imputation will be conducted within each treatment group independently, so the pattern of missing observations in 1 treatment group cannot influence missing value estimations in another.
For each efficacy variable (IGA and psoriasis signs), the following steps will be performed to 
impute missing data: 
1. Calculate the number of missing Week 8 values to be estimated by [CONTACT_249308]. Let nmiss be the maximum number of missing Week 8 values 
among the treatment groups. 
2. For each treatment group, create a data set containing subjects with observed values 
and those needing estimation by [CONTACT_85222]. The missing efficacy data in each data set 
will be filled in using the MCMC method ‘5 x nmiss’ times to generate ‘5 x nmiss’ data sets. The resulting data set for each treatment group will be combined into 
1 complete data set for each imputation. Options will be included in each imputation 
process to prevent estimating values to be outside the range of expected values for the assessment. 
3. Imputed data will be used to determine dichotomized success/failure values. 
4. Each complete data set will be analyzed with the appropriate CMH test. 
5. CMH statistics will be normalized using the Wilson-Hilferty transformation. 
6. The results from these analyses will be combined into a single inference using SAS PROC MIANALYZE.

In the first set of sensitivity analyses, missing IGA values will be imputed using LOCF. 
Treatment success at Week 8 will be analyzed as it was in the primary analyses. Comparisons will be performed on imputed data using CMH tests stratified by [CONTACT_85229]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Repeated Measures Analysis on Observed Data 
As a second sensitivity analysis, treatment success at Week 8 will be analyzed with a repeated measures logistic regression model (generalized estimating equations), with treatment success as the dependent variable and treatment, analysis center and visit (Weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8) as independent factors. 
12.1.7 Subgroup Analyses 
Subgroup analyses will be conducted for the ITT population for the following subgroups: 
Baseline IGA, sex, age, ethnicity, and race. Age will be dichotomized to less than the median age of subjects and greater than or equal to the median age of subjects. Subgroup analyses will be conducted on the primary efficacy endpoint and will contain only descriptive statistics. 
12.2 Assessment of Safety 
12.2.1 Adverse Events 
The primary analysis of safety will be conducted at Week 8.  There will be a tabulation, however, of the AE’s that start in the period post the Week 8 to Week 12 visit.  All AEs occurring during the study will be recorded and classified using terminology from the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). All reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), defined as any AE with an onset on or after the date of first study 
drug application, will be summarized by [CONTACT_119116], system organ class, preferred term, severity, and relationship to study drug. When summarizing TEAEs by [CONTACT_59222], each subject will be counted only once within a system organ class or a preferred term using the event with the greatest severity or causality, respectively, within each category. All reported SAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_119117], system organ class, preferred term, severity, and relationship to study drug.

In addition, a listing of subjects who prematurely discontinue from the study due to AEs will 
be provided as well as a listing of subjects who reported an SAE. 
12.2.2 Local Skin Reactions 
The frequency of local skin reactions including itching, dryness, burning/stinging, skin 
atrophy, striae, telangiectasia and folliculitis will be summarized by [CONTACT_6982]. Additionally, the percent of subjects who experience a local skin reaction (itching, dryness, burning/stinging) graded at a level of 3, at any point in the study following the first application of study drug, will be tabulated by [CONTACT_1570]. 
12.2.[ADDRESS_669909] demographic data and Baseline characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_220130], PP, and safety analysis sets. Comparisons between treatment groups will be performed to ensure comparable results. 
12.5 Protocol Deviations

12.8 Additional Statistical Considerations 
12.8.1 Analysis Populations 
Approximately 210 adult subjects with moderate or severe psoriasis (defined as an IGA score 
of 3 or 4) will be enrolled and randomized in the study. With a 2:1 randomization ratio, it is anticipated that: 
x Approximately 140 subjects will be randomized to receive IDP-122 (HP 0.01%) 
Lotion 
x Approximately 70 subjects will be randomized to receive IDP-122 Vehicle Lotion 
Efficacy analyses will be performed using the intent-to-treat (ITT) population and the per 
protocol (PP) population. The ITT analysis set will be considered primary for the evaluation of efficacy. Safety analyses will be performed using the safety population. 
All subjects who are randomized and dispensed study drug will be included in the ITT 
analysis set. 
All subjects who are randomized, receive at least [ADDRESS_669910]-baseline safety assessment will be included in the safety analysis set. 
All subjects in the ITT analysis set who complete the Week 8 visit without any major 
protocol violations will be included in the PP analysis set. The PP population will include subjects in the ITT population who did not meet any of the following criteria: 
x Violated the inclusion/exclusion criteria 
x Used an interfering concomitant medication 
x Did not attend the Week [ADDRESS_669911] not been compliant with the dosing regimen (i.e., subjects must apply 
80%-120% of the expected applications of study medication during participation 
in the study) 
x Out of visit window at the Week 8 visit by [CONTACT_726] ± 5 days

12.8.2 Sample Size Determination 
The following power calculations were computed using the observed Week 8 dichotomized 
IGA efficacy data in the ITT population from the Phase 2 study V01-118A-201. SAS PROC POWER with the Fisher’s exact test option was used to calculate the power for various sample sizes using a two-sided test with an alpha of 0.05. Table 5 presents the efficacy estimates derived from study V01-118A-201.

**IDP 118 Vehicle composition used in the V01-118A-201 is equivalent to the vehicle that will be used in this 
study (IDP 122 Vehicle Lotion). 
One hundred forty (140) IDP-122 treated subjects and seventy (70) vehicle treated subjects 
will have greater than 95% power to detect a statistically significant outcome for a two-sided 
test with an alpha level of 0.05.
It was noted that the estimates extracted from the above studies are based on the LOCF 
method of handling missing values while the proposed Phase 3 analysis will account for missing values using multiple imputations. The power stated above sufficiently exceeds 95% which will compensate for the difference in handling of missing data. 
12.8.3 Handling of Missing Data 
The method of multiple imputation will be used (see  Section 12.1.4).

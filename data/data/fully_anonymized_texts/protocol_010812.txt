Official Title:  “Vestibular Rehabilitation and Otolith Dysfunction”  
NCT Number:  02652442  
Document date:  9-28-2021  
Scientific Back ground : Vestibular Rehabilitation (VR) is the treatment of choice for patients experi encing dizziness, imbalance, and mobility impairments related 
to vestibular dysfunction.  VR typi[INVESTIGATOR_324791], which  were developed to facilitat e vestibular compensation of the semicircular canal -
mediated vestibulo -ocular reflex (VOR).  A critical signal to induce adaptation is retinal slip during head movements; thus, adaptation exercises involve head 
rotation while focusing on a target.  Most studies examining the effectiveness of VR have used only tests of VOR function  (caloric and rotational tests) that 
measure horizontal semicircular canal to determine vestibular loss.  Thus, little is known about interventions to facilitate vestibular compensation of the otolith 
organs.  
The concept of using centrifugation for otolith adaptation may be similar to using gaze stability exercises for VO R adaptation.   Recent studies have demonstrated 
adaptation fo llowing otolith organ stimulation using centrifugation (or linear acceleration), but there is no data regarding optimum stimu lus parameters.  The 
purpose of this study i s to determine  optim al off-axis distance of the rotary chair, duration of off -axis rotation (OAR), and training schedule  for ot olith 
adaptation . 
Study Objectives: The goal for testing different training protocols in healthy controls is: 1) to determine optimal stimulus parameters (off-axis distance of the 
rotary chair, duration of off -axis rotation , and training schedule ) that will be used to treat patients with otolith dysfunction and 2) to demonstrate otolith 
plasticity with a given set of stimulus paramet ers.   
Study design:  Sequential assignment  to stimulus param eters (off -axis distance, duration of off -axis rotation, training schedule)  
Study Protocol: For healthy controls, only unilateral centrifugation (UC)  training  (randomized for right or left ear off -axis) will be performed.  Direction (CW or 
CCW) of off -axis rotation (OAR) will be standardized so that subjects are facing forw ard in the direction of rotation.   
Primary outcome measure : Static subjective visual vertical (SVV) assesses spatial perception and is influenced by [CONTACT_324793].  Perception of vertical is 
measured in a darkened room with subject seated upright . The test assesse s an individual’s ability to adjust a laser line to be parallel with true vertical in the 
absence of any other visual cues.  The s tart position of line for SVV testing is randomized and participants are instructed to use the track ball to position the line 
in a vertic al position .  Five  trials are completed , and the software calculates the distance (in degrees ) from  vertical .  The average of the trials is calculated  and 
used for data analysis .  
  
Experiment 1.   Determination of optimal distance  of OAR (n = 5 subjects).  Each subject will complete training at chair position (A) followed by  (B) with at least 2 
weeks in between each training session until static SVV returns to normal.

Statistical Analysis Plan:  All data will be summarized using descriptive statistics. To examine the extent to which centrifugation parameters (distance, duration, 
schedule) impact the primary outcome (Subjective Visual Vertical , SVV ) for healthy controls, paired t -tests will be used to examine change in static SVV (pre- to 
post -centrifugation ).  Alpha level is 0.05.  No adjustments  will be made for multiple comparisons.

On May 12, 2021, IRB approval was granted for a period not to exceed [ADDRESS_401147] on the 
next agenda.   
 
This study was ap proved under expedited category : 
Category 4: Collection of data through noninvasive procedures (not involving general anesthesia or 
sedation) routinely employed in clinical practice - excluding procedures involving x -rays or 
microwaves. Where medical devices are employed - they must be cleared/approved  for marketing. 
(Studies intended to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the medical device are not generally 
eligible for expedited review - including studies of cleared medical devices for new indications.) 
Examples: (a) physical sensors that are app lied either to the surface of the body or at a distance and 
do not involve input of significant amounts of energy into the subject or an invasion of the subject’s 
privacy; (b) weighing or testing sensory acuity; (c) magnetic resonance imaging; (d) 
electroc ardiography - electroencephalography - thermography - detection of natural occurring 
radioactivity - electroretinography - ultrasound - diagnostic infrared imaging - doppler blood flow - and 
echocardiography; (e) moderate exercise - muscular strength testing - body composition assessment - 
and flexibility testing where appropriate given the age - weight - and health of the individual.  
Category 7: Research on individual or group characteristics or behavior including - but not limited to - 
research on perception - cognition - motivation - identity - language - communication - cultural 
beliefs/practices - and social behavior - or research employing survey - interview - oral history - focus 
group - program evaluation - human factors evaluation - or quality assurance methodologies. NOTE: 
some of the research in this category may be exempt [45CFR46.101(b)(2) and (b)(3). This listing

Note:   This study is clos ed to accrual; therefore , there are no stamped, approved informed consent

only exception is that a change can be made prior to IRB approval when necessary to eliminate 
apparent immediate hazards to the research subjects [ 45 CFR 46.108(3)(iii ), 21 CFR 56.108 (a)(4)].  
In such a case, the IRB must be promptly informed of the change following its implementation (within

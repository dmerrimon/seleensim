 1 Introduction  
 
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted according 
to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and 
International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable governm ent regulations, and 
University of North Carolina research policies and procedures.  
1.1 Background  
 
Autism spectrum disorder  (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by [CONTACT_713940], repetitive behaviors and interests [1]. 
ASD is now estimated to affect 1 in 68 children in the U.S., including 1 in 42 boys [2], and leads to 
substantial, lifelong burden for individuals, families, and communities.  Use of psychiatric 
medication in ASD is high, with 66% of affected individuals taking at least 1 psychotropic 
medication by [CONTACT_449738] [3]. However, no medications are c urrently available to treat the 
defining clinical features of autism, and pharmacological management is instead limited to 
treating associated behavioral symptoms, such as hyperactivity, self -injury, and aggression.  Only 
risperidone and aripi[INVESTIGATOR_713884], specifically for the treatment of 
severe irritability in children [4].  Faced with heavy side effect burden and often limited efficacy, 
patients and their families frequently turn to supplements and alternative treatments that 
promise low toxicity but lack rigorous investigation and oversight.   
 
Developi[INVESTIGATOR_713885], epi[INVESTIGATOR_57591], and molecular pathways; as such, 
no treatments based on an understanding of disease mechanism are presently available.  
However, several emerging lines of research suggest that interrelated metabolic dysfunction and 
immune dysregulation at the cellular level contribute to the pathogenesis  of ASD in at least a 
subset of individuals [5, 6] .  Preclinical and human studies have documented increased levels of 
oxidative stress [7-9]; reduced antioxidant activity [10-12]; mitochondrial dysfunction [13-15]; 
elevated inflammatory markers [16-19]; evidence of neuroinflammation [20-23]; and synaptic 
dysfunction [24]  in association with ASD.  Evidence of cellular dysfunction provides an intriguing 
hypothesis for the systemic phenomena commonly observed in patients with ASD, including 
gastrointestinal p roblems and improvement in ASD symptoms during fever [25, 26] .  Anecdotal 
improvement in core symptoms of autism during fever, particularly repetitive speech and 
behavior, is commonly observed, possibly as a result of upregulation of heat shock proteins (H SPs) 
that play a key role in multiple CNS cellular processes, including synaptic transmission and 
response to metabolic stress [25, 27, 28] .   
 
It is hypothesized that this varied evidence of cellular dysfunction may reflect impaired activity in 
common met abolic pathways, the consequence of which is aberrant protein synthesis that 
impedes normal synaptic development and function.  Synaptic dysfunction is believed to be a key 
pathogenic mechanism in ASD [24] .  In particular, overactivation of the mammalian t arget of 
rapamycin (mTOR) intracellular signaling pathway has been implicated in excessive protein 
synthesis and synaptic dysfunction in ASD [29-31].

The Kelch -like ECH -associated protein 1 (Keap1)/nuclear factor -erythroid factor 2 
(Nrf2)/antioxidant res ponse elements (ARE) pathway is a highly efficient system involved in 
maintaining cellular redox balance and reducing oxidative damage through a series of antioxidant 
molecules and detoxifying enzymes.  Nrf2 is a nuclear transcription factor that, when act ivated by 
[CONTACT_713941], translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and induces 
expression of a variety of antioxidants and immune mediators involved in limiting cellular damage 
from these conditions [32, 33] .  ASD diagnosis in children has been linked to a 45% reduction in 
gene expression of Nrf2 in association with evidence of greater oxidative stress [6].  These 
findings suggest that deficits in the Keap1/Nrf2/ARE pathway may lead to a state of chronic 
inflammation and decreas ed capacity to respond effectively to conditions promoting oxidative 
stress in autism. While it is not yet clear if these cellular abnormalities are etiological or secondary 
manifestations of another disease -causing mechanism, preliminary studies have sugg ested that 
treatments aimed at reducing oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction may improve core 
and associated symptoms of ASD [34] . In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_713886], compounds that upregulate 
Nrf2 activity may have the potential to improve symptom burd en in ASD.  
 
Sulforaphane (SF) is a naturally -occurring isothiocyanate (ITC) in cruciferous vegetables that 
induces HSP and Nrf2 activity, leading to enhanced redox homeostasis, DNA repair, and fatty acid 
and lipid cellular metabolism [32] .  SF has also bee n shown to (1) suppress lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS) -induced inflammation in rat microglia [35] , (2) reduce neuroinflammation in degenerative 
CNS disorders [36] , and (3) mitigate reactive oxygen species (ROS) -mediated neurotoxicity in a 
murine model of herpes encephalitis [37]  through activation of Nrf2.  In cultured cardiomyoctes 
and prostate cancer cells, SF reduces cellular damage through downregulation of mTOR -mediated 
excessive protein synthesis [38, 39] .  
 
Due to its chemoprotective properties, SF has bee n investigated as a therapeutic agent in clinical 
trials of prostate cancer, breast cancer, exposure to air pollutants, and insulin resistance in type 2 
diabetes with promising results [40-44].  Importantly, SF is bioavailable when taken orally and 
readily  crosses the blood -brain barrier [45-47].  SF is attractive as a potential therapeutic 
compound in ASD for its demonstrated capacity to improve redox balance, enhance antioxidant 
capacity, reduce neuroinflammation, support cellular metabolism, and regulate  the mTOR 
signaling pathway, all of which have been implicated in autism pathogenesis.  In a recent clinical 
trial, Singh and colleagues [48]  first demonstrated that young men with autism treated with oral 
SF for 18 weeks were rated as calmer by [CONTACT_713942] a placebo group.  In this proposed clinical trial, 
we aim to independently replicate this important study and add to the evidence base of SF 
treatment for autism.   
 
Of note, the trial by [CONTACT_145559] [48]  utilized freeze -dried, SF -rich broccoli sprout extracts, an 
investigational product formulated by [CONTACT_713943].  Hydrolyzed Brocco li Sprout Extract (BSE) is costly, 
difficult to manufacture, and no longer produced in the [LOCATION_002] for clinical trials or routine 
clinical use.  Avmacol® is a commercially available nutraceutical that provides a rich source of SF 
through co -delivery of glucoraphanin (GR), a sulforaphane precursor, and myrosinase, the plant 
enzyme that catalyzes conversion of GR to SF.  Avmacol® is readily available as a dietary 
 
Clinical Protocol: Sulforaphane for ASD  
- [ADDRESS_972303], Avmacol® (Nutramax  Laboratories, Inc., Edgewood, MD) is a dietary 
supplement containing broccoli seed extract and freeze -dried broccoli sprouts that is 
manufactured under GMP standards and has been commercially available since 2013.  Avmacol® 
provides a rich source of the i sothiocyanate (ITC) sulforaphane (1 -isothiocyanato -(4R) -
(methylsulfinyl)butane) in the form of glucoraphanin (4 -methylsulfinylbutyl -glucosinolate), an 
inert glucosinolate (GS), and myrosinase, the plant enzyme that hydrolyzes glucoraphanin to 
sulforaphane [49] .  The chemoprotective properties of cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, 
cauliflower, cabbage, etc.) are largely attributed to their high content of GS, which are converted to 
biologically active ITCs (i.e., sulforaphane) by [CONTACT_713944] [50] . Myrosinase is present in plant cells and is physically 
segregated from the glucosinolates until the barrier is ruptured via cell damage or chewing.     
 
SF is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_713887] -S-transferases (GSTs) [51, 52]  and 
accumulates in various types of cells through conjugation with cellular glutathione [53, 54] . SF 
conjugates are exported from the cell by a transporter -mediated mechanism [54] .   Successive 
steps of hydrolysis o f the conjugates lead ultimately to formation of N -acetyl -cysteine derivatives 
(mercapturic acids).  These conjugates are dithiocarbamates (DTC) that are excreted in urine and 
can be quantified through a cyclocondensation reaction developed in the Cullman 
Chemoprotection Center of Johns Hopkins University.  SF activates the Nrf2 pathway, resulting in 
elevated gene transcription via the Antioxidant Response Element (ARE) in the regulatory domain 
of its target genes [55, 56] .

Each tablet of Avmacol® contains [ADDRESS_972304], 
providing approximately 15 mg (34.4 µmol) of glucoraphanin and enough myrosinase to fully 
hydrolyze the glucoraphanin contained in the tablet.  In the batch of tablets formulated for  the 
proposed clinical trial, manufacturing specifications required at least 13 mg glucoraphanin per 
tablet, and recent analysis indicated 17 mg per tablet (see Avmacol® COA in Section 7).  
Manufacturing data from Nutramax, Inc. and bioavailability studies  of similar compounds 
containing GR and myrosinase suggest a bioconversion to SF rate in the range of 40 -50% [47] ; it is 
expected that each Avmacol® tablet with therefore supply approximately [ADDRESS_972305] -order metabolism, and urinary excretion of metabolites 
(DTCs), yielding a mean half -life of 1.77 ± 0.13 hr. and volume of distribution of 59.9 ± 7.0 liters 
[57] .  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_273359] -life, SF is believed to have a longer duration of action, a s 
induced phase [ADDRESS_972306] half -lives measured in days [56] .  SF has been shown to cross the 
blood -brain barrier [58] .  Urinary metabolites (DTCs) are renally excreted and can be quantified 
using a cyclocondensation reaction.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_972307] not demonstrated any 
significant change in body weight or evidence of organ toxicity [59-62].  SF has also shown little 
cytotoxicity in vitro , though hepatotoxity in rats has been demonstrated at extremely high 
concentrations (>500 µM) [63] .  
 
Numerous studies have associated ASD with cellular abnormalities, including: (1) redox imbalance 
and oxidative stress [9, 10, 64] ; (2) mitochondrial dysfunction [13-15]; (3) immune 
dysregulation/ neuroinflammation [20-23, 65] ; (4) symptomatic improvement with fever/ heat 
shock response [25, 27] ; and (4) aberrant mTOR expression and its effects on synaptic 
transmission [29-31].  It is hypothesized that these varying  types of cellular dysfunction may 
involve a number of related, interacting metabolic pathways [11] , though the relationship 
between them has not been fully characterized.  Preclinical data has identified a role for SF and its 
ability to upregulate the Kea p 1/Nrf2/ARE pathway in modulating each of these areas of cellular 
dysfunction, suggesting SF could have therapeutic benefit in autism.   
 
Upregulation of antioxidant enzymes via activation of the Keap 1/Nrf2/ARE pathway has 
important implications for ASD,  which has been associated with reduced levels of Nrf2 expression 
and oxidative phosphorylation capacity in cultured cells [6]. Lower concentrations of reduced

 glutathione (GSH), the primary intracellular antioxidant, higher levels of oxidized glutathione 
(GSSG), and reduced GSH/GSSG redox ratios have also been identified in plasma, peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs), lymphoblastoid cell lines, brain tissue, and mitochondria of 
individuals with autism in comparison to healthy controls [9, 64, 66, 67 ].  SF has been found to 
have neuroprotective effects against oxidative stress through Nrf2 induction and the resulting 
increased expression of antioxidant enzymes and elevation of GSH [68-73]. In a rat model of spi[INVESTIGATOR_713888], SF readily crossed th e blood -brain barrier, increasing phase 2 enzyme expression 
and reducing inflammation at the site of the injury [74] .  Similarly, in a murine model of herpes 
encephalitis, SF stimulated Nrf2 activity and antioxidant enzyme (heme oxygenase -1, glutathione 
peroxidase 1) expression in astrocytes, inhibiting ROS -mediated neurotoxicity [37] .  Animal 
models of neurodegenerative diseases suggest that SF can have a neuroprotective effect by 
[CONTACT_713945] [36, 75] . 
 
Evidence o f mitochondrial dysfunction in individuals with ASD has been demonstrated in brain 
mass resonance spectroscopy imaging [76] , cell lines derived from children with ASD [14] , and in 
blood cell [13, 77]  and brain samples [15]  of children with ASD, and this dy sfunction may play a 
critical role in disease pathogenesis in a subset of individuals [11, 78, 79] .  In particular, 
impairment in fatty acid oxidation is believed to be one of the major contributors to the impaired 
mitochondrial phenotype [80] , supported b y elevated levels of acyl -carnitines [81]  and decreased 
levels of free carnitine [82]  in some individuals with ASD.  Emerging evidence suggests that Nrf2 
plays a role in supporting mitochondrial function and metabolism, possibly through improving the 
effic iency of fatty acid oxidation [80, 83] .  In a rodent hippocampal model, SF was associated with 
increased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis and decreased vulnerability to induced 
seizures [84] .  SF also induced mitochondrial and peroxisome biogenesis i n cultured fibroblasts 
[85] . 
 
Inflammation and immune dysregulation has been well -documented in animal models and 
individuals with ASD, both peripherally and within the central nervous system [5, 11, 22, 65] .  ASD 
is associated with elevated rates of micro glial activation in murine models, post -mortem studies, 
and brain imaging [20, 21, 23, 86]  as well as heightened expression of proinflammatory cytokines 
in the CNS, particularly interleukin -6 (IL -6), tumor necrosis factor -alpha (TNF -α), and interferon -
gamm a (IF -γ) [16-19].  SF has been shown to modulate neuroinflammation in animal models [35, 
37, 74] .  The beneficial effect of SF on inflammation is mediated at least in part through inhibition 
of the nuclear factor -ΚΒ (NF - ΚΒ) pathway, resulting in decreased  expression of numerous 
proinflammatory factors [80] .  Nrf2 -deficient mice demonstrate increased microglial activation 
and release of proinflammatory cytokines in response to LPS challenge [87] .  When treated with 
SF, mice exposed to LPS show attenuated ne uroinflammation, as evidenced by [CONTACT_713946] (iNOS), IL -
6, and TNF -α [87] . 
 
Common anecdotal reports and observational studies suggest that some individuals with ASD 
experience a substantial but temporary improvement in autistic symptoms (primarily stereotypic 
behavior and in appropriate speech) during fever [25] , unrelated to the severity of fever or autism.  
Though the mechanism of this “fever effect” is not entirely c lear, direct thermal effects as well as 
indirect effects, including increased expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) and activation of 
cellular stress responses, may be involved [85, 88] .  HSPs have a cytoprotective  effect during 
 
Clinical Protocol: Sulforaphane for ASD  
- 14 - 
 thermal stress, functioning as molecular chaperones for misfolded proteins and playing a role in 
cellular repair [88] .  In addition, HSPs are central to synaptic transmission and may improve long -
range cerebral cortical connectivity that is depressed in ASD [80, 89] .  SF has extensive effects on 
HSPs [85, 90] , including induction of the HSP heme oxygenase 1 (HO -1, or Hsp32) [91] , activation 
of heat -shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1), and upregulation of Hsp27, which increases 
proteasomal act ivity [85] . SF may therefore ameliorate features of autism, in part, by [CONTACT_713947] [80] . 
 
Finally, dysfunctional synaptic transmission caused by [CONTACT_713948] a key pathogenic role in ASD [24] , potentially due to overactivation of the phosphoinositide -3 
kinase/protein kinase -B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/Akt/mTOR) signaling pathway 
[31, 92] .  Mutations in genes upstream of mTOR (e.g., phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), 
tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1/2)) lead to overactivity of the mTOR pathway, resulting in 
excessive protein synthesis, abnormal synaptic function, and ASD phenotypes [80] .  Synaptic 
plasticity requires a balance between protein synthesis and degradation [93] , and  deficits in 
autophagy, a major protein degradation pathway downstream of mTOR signaling, are also 
associated with overactivation of the mTOR pathway and ASD dendritic spi[INVESTIGATOR_351338] [31] .  SF 
has been shown to downregulate mTOR signaling and associated e xcessive protein synthesis in 
breast cancer [94] , cardiomyocyte [38] , and prostate cancer cell lines [39] , as well as induce 
autophagy in neuronal cells and the brains of mouse models for Huntington’s disease [95, 96] .  
mTOR signaling and protein synthesis  are also inhibited in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells 
treated with SF [97] .  Taken together, these findings suggest that SF modulates aberrant mTOR 
signaling activity and autophagy, which may have a therapeutic effect for ASD.  
 
 
Clinical Data to Date  
 
Sulforaphane (SF), derived from freeze -dried broccoli sprouts, was recently investigated as a 
treatment for symptoms of ASD in a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial of 45 male 
adolescents and young adults (ages 13 -30 years old) with moderate  to severe autism (clinical 
trials identifier [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) [48] .  Fifteen participants were randomized to placebo and 29 to 
SF; each group was treated for 18 weeks, followed by a 4 -week discontinuation period and final 
follow -up at 22 weeks.  Forty partici pants (14 on placebo, 26 on SF) completed the trial; of those 
participants, 32 (80%) had a reported history of behavioral improvement during fever epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].  
The primary outcome was change in symptoms of autism as measured by [CONTACT_713949] s Scale (SRS) total scores; additional measures of interest included change in 
caregiver -completed Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) scores and clinician -rated Autism Clinical 
Impressions Severity and Improvement Scales (OACIS -Severity and OACIS -Improvemen t).  SRS 
scores improved significantly more in the SF group compared with the placebo group ( -15 units vs 
-3 units; p=0.02).  Considering the 4 non -completers as non -responders, 31% (9/29) SF 
participants vs 0% placebo participants demonstrated a 25% decre ase in total SRS score from 
baseline (p=0.018).  SF participants also demonstrated significantly greater improvement in ABC 
total and OACIS -Improvement scores, particularly in the domains of social interaction (p=0.003), 
aberrant/ abnormal behavior (p=0.00 7), repetitive/ stereotypi[INVESTIGATOR_5485] (p=0.08), and verbal 
communication (p=0.008).  SF was well -tolerated with no serious adverse events.  Two subjects

 with a history of seizures had single unprovoked seizures during the course of the study (one after 
3 weeks on SF, one 3 weeks after discontinuing SF), and the possibility of seizure as potentially 
associated with SF could not be ruled out.  
 
Based on available data from Phase I human clinical trials of SF -rich compounds, SF appears to be 
extremely well -tolerated with minimal risk aside from mild gastrointestinal symptoms, which may 
include bloating, nausea, and loose stools.  
 
A Phase I study of orally administered SF - and GR -containing BSE (75 µmol glucosinolates, 300 
µmol glucosinolates, or 75 µmol isothio cyanates daily) for 7 days in 12 healthy volunteers did not 
demonstrate any clinical adverse events [51] .  Two of 12 subjects assigned to active treatment 
demonstrated an increase in plasma ALT exceeding the upper limit of normal, though ALT levels 
rose fo r all subjects during the course of the study (including those assigned to placebo control), 
and the increase was not clearly attributable to consumption of BSE.  Three of 12 subjects (2 
active treatment, 1 placebo) demonstrated TSH levels exceeding the up per limit of normal during 
or after the dosing period, though elevated TSH was not associated with clinical symptoms or 
T3/T4 abnormalities.   
 
Egner et al. [46]  conducted a cross -over trial in [ADDRESS_972308] a SF -rich 
beverage (150 µmol/day) for [ADDRESS_972309] on liver and kidney function [43] . 
 
A study of orally administered broccoli sprout homogenates (2 5 to 300 g) in 57 subjects over 3 
separate days found no adverse effects aside from mild digestive effects [98] .  Similarly, in a RCT 
of 20 men with recurrent prostate cancer treated with sulforaphane 200 µmol/ day for 20 weeks, 
no serious adverse events o ccurred, though some reported mild gastrointestinal upset [40] .

represents the highest daily dosing of sulforaphane to date (338 µmol) [99] .  No serious adverse 
events were reported, though gastrointestinal  bloating was experienced somewhat more often in 
the SF group (N=17 vs. N=10), and one participant in the SF group withdrew from the study due to 
bowel discomfort.  The differences in adverse effects between the two groups were not 
statistically significan t (p=0.149).  Furthermore, no significant between -group differences were 
found for body weight, BMI, blood counts, and chemistries.  
1.4 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits  
The Avmacol® dosing regimen for the current study was designed to deliver a slightly higher  
concentration of SF as that administered in a previously reported clinical trial of SF for ASD [48] .  
In the randomized, placebo -controlled trial by [CONTACT_713950]. al [48] , participants randomly assigned to 
the active treatment group received capsules containi ng SF -rich broccoli sprout extracts that 
provided approximately 50 µmol SF/cap.  Dosing was weight -based as follows:  
 
Clinical Protocol: Sulforaphane for ASD  
- 16 - 
  
 50 µmol SF (1 cap) daily for weight < 100  
 100 µmol SF (2 caps) daily for weight 101 -199 lb.  
 150 µmol SF (3 caps) daily for weight ≥ 200 lb.   
 
Using this dosing schedule, participants receiving SF demonstrated significant improvement in 
social impairment as measured by [CONTACT_713951] (SRS) total scores and 
significant improvement in related challenging behaviors as  measured by [CONTACT_713952] (ABC) as compared with placebo over the course of the [ADDRESS_972310] observed by [CONTACT_5875] 4 of treatment.  These doses of SF were 
well -tolerated by [CONTACT_3445] s and were not significantly associated with adverse events, change in 
blood pressure or heart rate, or change in routine laboratory values.  Unexpectedly, SF treatment 
was associated with minor but significant weight gain, and 2 participants with a histor y of 
seizures had single, unprovoked seizures (one taking SF, one taking placebo).  
 
The currently proposed clinical trial is designed to independently replicate the study by [CONTACT_713953] [48] , to support or refute these findings.  Avmacol® delivers SF in the form of its 
glucosinolate precursor, glucoraphanin (GR; derived by [CONTACT_713954]), and the active 
enzyme myrosinase (derived from broccoli sprouts), which hydrolyzes GR to SF upon ingestion.  
Bioavailability studies have demonst rated approximately 40 -50% endogenous conversion of GR to 
SF upon ingestion of compounds containing GR enriched with myrosinase in healthy participants 
[47] .  Each tablet of Avmacol®, formulated for use in clinical trials,  contains approximately 15 mg 
(34. 4 µmol) of glucoraphanin.  Assuming 45% endogenous conversion of GR to SF (which will vary 
somewhat from individual to individual), each tablet will therefore supply approximately 15.5 
µmol SF/tablet. The weight -based Avmacol®/ placebo dosing schedule for the current study is as 
follows:  
 
 3 tablets (approx. 46.5 µmol SF) if <100 lb  
 5 tablets (approx. 77.5 µmol SF) if 100 -125 lb  
 6 tablets (approx. 93 µmol SF) if 126 -175 lb  
 7 tablets (approx. 108.5 µmol SF) if 176 -199 lb  
 8 tablets (approx. 124 µmol SF) i f ≥ 200 lb  
 
Based on previous studies of SF in human subjects, this dosing regimen is expected to be very 
well -tolerated with minimal to no adverse effects.  This dosing regimen is also expected to deliver 
a slightly higher weight -based dose of SF than the  trial conducted by [CONTACT_145559] [48] after 
accounting for the 70% bioconversion rate (approximate) when purified SF is administered orally 
(i.e., an oral dose of 50 µg SF derived from freeze -dried BSE is expected to provide 35 µg SF 
following ingestion and  bioconversion).    
 
If a participant experiences significant adverse events that affect tolerability, may reasonably be 
related to taking the investigational product, and do not meet the protocol definition for a serious 
AE, the dose may be reduced by [CONTACT_41672] 30% according to the following dose modification

exacerbation of behavioral symptoms (such as self -injurious behavior or aggression) that do not 
improve substantially following a dose reduction  and are determined “probably” or “definitely” 
related to taking the investigational product, the investigational product may be permanently 
discontinued sooner than [ADDRESS_972312]  cyclical changes in behavior independent of medication effects, the study staff 
will rely on caregivers’ experience with the participant to determine if any observed behavior 
changes are within the expected range for that individual.  If the investigation al product is stopped 
permanently, the participant and his caregiver will be asked to complete the remainder of the 
study visits, return any unused study drug, and repeat safety lab studies.  
2 Study Objectives  
 
Primary Objective:  
The primary objective of t his clinical trial is to determine if  Avmacol® is superior to placebo for  
improving social communication impairment in adolescent and young adult men with moderate to 
severe autism spectrum disorder (ASD) , as measured by [CONTACT_713955]-2 
(SRS -2) [100]  total scores . 
 
Secondary Objectives:  
Secondary objectives include: (1) assessing the safety and tolerability of Avmacol® in subjects 
with ASD; and (2) characteriz ing the effects of Avmacol® on behavioral challenges commonly 
associated with ASD, including hyperactivity, irritability, repetitive behavior, and inappropri ate 
speech .

- 18 - 
 Exploratory Objectives : 
In a subset of 30 participants, exploratory objectives include: (1) Assessment of  gut micobiota 
diversity and relative  abundance of microbial species from feca l samples collected before and 
after 12 weeks of treatment with  sulforaphane or placebo. (2) Explore the relationship  
between changes in microbiota composition and behavioral outcomes  in young men treated with  
sulforaphane or placebo.  
[ADDRESS_972313]  a Phase II , randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial of Avmacol®, 
a rich source of sulforaphane, for the treatment of social impairment in individuals with ASD .  
Fifty -four male subjects  with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) between ag es 13 and 30 years old 
will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by [CONTACT_67579] (13 -18 and 19 -30 years old) , to receive 
either Avmacol® or identical placebo tablets.  Participation will be limited to males to closely 
approximate the sample used in the SF for ASD clinical trial by [CONTACT_145559].  [48]  and to account for 
possible mechanistic differences in ASD between males and females (ASD is 4 times more common 
in males). Stratification by [CONTACT_713956] -based differences in response to 
treatment (adolescence vs. adulthood) and allow for secondary analysis by [CONTACT_551] (adolescent 
vs. adult).   
 
The length of study participation from baseline to  study termination for each individual subject is 
16 weeks, including a 12 -week active treatment phase ( Avmacol® or placebo), followed by a 4 - 
week blinded discontinuation phase.  Participants will be monitored with clinic visits at regular 
intervals (base line and weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16) for improvement in a well -characterized, caregiver -
rated measure of social impairment (Social Responsiveness Scale -2 (SRS -2) [100] , the primary 
outcome) as well as secondary measures of (1) repetitive behaviors associated w ith ASD 
(Repetitive Behavior Scale - Revised; RBSR) [102] ; (2) challenging behaviors commonly associated 
with developmental disabilities (Aberrant Behavior Checklist; ABC) [103] ; (3) clinician -rated 
functional severity (Clinical Global Impression Scale - Severity; CGI -S) [104] ; and clinician -rated 
functional improvement (Clinical Global Impression Scale - Improvement; CGI -I) [104] . 
 
Vital signs and reports of adverse events will be monitored at each study visit (Baseline, Week 4, 
Week 8, Week 12, Week 16) for tolerability and safety monitoring.  A phone call with the subject’s 
caregiver at Week 2 of the treatment phase will also be used to monitor for early adverse events.  
Physical exam and phlebotomy for routine laboratories (Complete Blood Count (CBC); 
Compr ehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP); Liver Function Tests (LFTs), and Thyroid Stimulating 
Hormone (TSH)) will be conducted at Baseline and Week 12 for the purposes of safety monitoring.  
Fecal samples will be collected at home in the 48 hr prior to Baseline and  Week 12 visits for 
microbiota analyses.

4.[ADDRESS_972315] Recruitment and Screening  
 
Subjects will primarily be recruited from the Caroli na Institute for Developmental Disabilities 
(CIDD) Research Subject Registry, which includes more than [ADDRESS_972316] information of study staff.  Participants will also be 
recruited from the clinical practices of physicians, psychologists, and allied he alth staff at the 
Carolina Institute for Developmental Disabilities as well as from local referring providers.  
Electronic and written advertisements will be disseminated to local community autism support 
agencies (e.g., Autism Society of North Carolina, A utism Resource Centers).  All recruitment 
materials will first be approved by [CONTACT_713959].  
 
Potential subjects expressing an interest in study participation will go through an initial telephone 
screening process to assess eligibility for study participation (e.g., previous autism diagnosis, 
male, ages 13 -30, able to be accompanied by a caregiver who can serve as a primary informant, 
not taking chronic anti -inflammatory medication, free of major medical illness, no clinical seizures 
in the previous 12 months).  Before the initial clinic screening visit, the caregiver and subject will 
be sent a copy  of the informed consent form for review.   
 
 
Clinical Protocol: Sulforaphane for ASD  
- 22 - 
 Written informed consent by a caregiver will be obtained before proceeding with all screening 
assessments.  Whenever possible, informed assent will also be obtained from the participant.  The 
study will pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] a  tablet -based electronic decisional capacity  tool developed at Research Triangle 
Institute (RTI) International to enhan ce participation in the  assent process for individuals with 
developmental disabilities.  Prior to study enrollment, participants will unde rgo diagnostic 
confirmation of autism spectrum disorder at the screening visit by [CONTACT_713960] -5 Autism 
Spectrum Disorder (ASD) criteria (by [CONTACT_9154]) and by [CONTACT_713961] -
2 administration (by a master’s level clinician experi enced in ADOS -2 administration for research 
purposes).  Screening requirements will also include routine laboratory testing (CBC, electrolytes, 
LFTs, TSH), medical history, and physical examination to identify any exclusionary factors.  
Screening laborator y values and physical exam findings must be within normal limits or deemed 
not clinically significant by [CONTACT_713962].  Subjects with serious 
medical illnesses that are poorly controlled, that may increase risks associated with study 
participation, or that may otherwise confound results will not be enrolled.   
4.[ADDRESS_972317] may include:  
 
 The subject experience s a serious adverse event (SAE) that the study physician determines 
is likely related to the study treatment or that presents a safety risk for ongoing 
participation.  
 The subject experiences a clinical seizure during the course of the active treatment phas e, 
either by [CONTACT_713963].  
 The subject requires significant dose adjustments to concomitant psychopharmacological 
medications (e.g. stimulants, antidepressants, mood stabilizing agents, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]) or 
starts a new psychopharmacological medication due to significantly worsened behavioral 
disturbance.   
 The subject requires a new chronic medication that may potentially interact with the study 
medication.  
 
No withdrawal symptoms or adverse effects are anticip ated from abrupt discontinuation of the 
study medication.  However, if a patient needs to discontinue the study treatment for one of the 
aforementioned reasons, every effort will be made to bring the subject in promptly for a clinic visit 
to perform safety  measures, including physical examination and laboratory measures.  As 
described below, study personnel will request that subjects who prematurely stop treatment 
complete the remaining study visits and procedures as outlined in the protocol.  
4.4.2 Data Collectio n and Follow -up for Withdrawn Subjects  
 
 
Clinical Protocol: Sulforaphane for ASD  
- [ADDRESS_972318]/ caregiver’s permission to collect data through the end of the planned subject follow -up 
period (week 16 visit).  The  data collected will be included in the final data set under intention -to-
treat analysis, provided the participant took at least [ADDRESS_972319]’s caregiver 
by [CONTACT_713964].  If the caregiver 
cannot be reached by [CONTACT_61529], a certified letter will be sent requesting that the caregiver 
contac t the study personnel to further discuss the subject’s involvement in the trial.  A second 
certified letter will be sent two weeks after the first letter was sent if the subject’s caregiver has 
not responded within those two weeks.  If the caregiver does n ot respond to the second letter, the 
subject will be considered lost to follow -up.  All attempts to contact [CONTACT_423]’s caregiver will be 
documented in a communication log.  
[ADDRESS_972320] powder (equivalent to approximately 36 µmol GR), [ADDRESS_972321] powder (source of myrosinase), 15 mg as corbic acid, 7.5 mg 
carboxymethylcellulose, 6.5 mg silicon dioxide, and 171 mg microcrystalline cellulose.  The 
placebo tablets will be similar in shape, size, and color.  
5.2 Treatment Regimen  
Participants will take 3 -8 Avmacol® or placebo tablets once daily b y mouth for a total of 12 weeks, 
with dosing regimen based on weight as follows:  
 
3 tablets (approx. 46.5 µmol SF) if <100 lb  
5 tablets (approx. 77.5 µmol SF) if 100 -125 lb  
6 tablets (approx. 93 µmol SF) if 126 -175 lb  
7 tablets (approx. 108.5 µmol SF) if 1 76-199 lb  
8 tablets (approx. 124 µmol SF) if ≥ 200 lb  
 
The tablets may be crushed and mixed with a soft food, such as applesauce, if needed.  Participants 
will be instructed to avoid taking the tablets with a heavy meal.  
 
5.3 Method for Assigning Subjects to T reatment Groups  
 
Enrolled participants will be stratified  for age (13 -18 and 19 -30 years)  to account for possible 
effects of age on treatment response.  The goal is to recruit twenty -seven 13 -18 year -olds and 
twenty -seven 19 -30 year -olds  to allow for separ ate analysis of adolescents and adults 
(exploratory) .  Individuals will be randomly assigned to treatment group within age strata by 
[CONTACT_713965] (i.e., 1 -27 for younger group and 1 -27 
 
Clinical Protocol: Sulforaphane for ASD  
- 24 - 
 for older group).  The large r half of the random numbers within each group will be assigned to 
receive  the treatment and the smaller half to the placebo  condition.  These two lists – listed in 
their original order (1 -27 for younger and 1 -27 for older) will be provided to UNC Investig ational 
Drug Services (IDS) pharmacists.  They will consult the list and provide the appropriate 
medication to each individual depending on the order in which they present to the pharmacy 
within their age group.   Study personnel will remain blinded to trea tment condition for the 
duration of the study.  
5.4 Preparation and Administration of Study Drug  
 
Avmacol® and placebo tablets will be shipped in bulk to UNC IDS (984 -974 -0469) in 500 count 
bottles, which wi ll be stored at 2 -8⁰C in the refrigerator until needed.  Prior to a participant’s 
study visit, a 5 -week supply of the investigational drug ( Avmacol® or placebo) will be packaged in 
a smaller, labeled bottle to be pi[INVESTIGATOR_115835].  The label will not indicate whether the 
bottles contain Avmacol® or placebo tablets.  The study personnel will verify the number of tablets 
dispensed and record on the drug accountability form.  The bottle of investigational drug will be 
stored in a small refrigerator used exclusively for this purpose at the study site  until the 
designated visit.  The investigational drug will be dispensed to the subject’s caregiver at the time 
of the study visit (Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8 visits) in a freezer bag for transport with 
instructions to s tore the bottle in a home refriger ator.  Subjects and caregivers will be advised to 
avoid taking the tablets with a heavy meal and to take by [CONTACT_713966].  If a subject is unable to swallow pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], the tablets may be crushed with a pi[INVESTIGATOR_713889] a nd pestle and mixed with a soft food, such as applesauce.  Of note, investigators at the 
Cullman Chemoprotection Center and others have successfully administered sulforaphane and its 
precursor, glucoraphanin, in a number of different formulations, both enc apsulated and in various 
types of juices [43, 44, 46, 47, 105] . 
5.[ADDRESS_972322] Compliance Monitoring  
Subjects’ caregivers will be provided with a medication log to track daily dosing of the study 
medication.  At Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12 visits, subjects and th eir caregivers will be 
instructed to return the medication log and any unused tablets to study staff, who will count the 
remaining tablets and address any discrepancies between remaining tablets and the medication 
log with the families.  Compliance percent ages will be recorded on a drug compliance form.  For 
frequent missed doses, the study physician will discuss the importance of adherence to the 
recommended dosing regimen and will identify any potential barriers to compliance, providing 
support when possi ble.   
5.6 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
Participants will be permitted to continue their usual regimen of medications, psychotropic and 
otherwise, during the study with the exception of chronic anti -inflammatory medications (e.g., 
ibuprofen, naproxen, cortico steroids), which may confound the treatment effects.  Concomitant 
medication doses must be stable for 4 weeks prior to study enrollment and remain constant for 
the duration of the study, to the extent possible.

 5.7 Packaging  
Avmacol® will be shipped in bulk from Nutramax Laboratories, Inc. ([ADDRESS_972323], 
Edgewood, MD [ZIP_CODE]) to UNC IDS in boxes of bottles containing 500 tablets of Avmacol © each.  
The bottle labels will include: product name ( Avmacol®), manufacturer (Nutramax Labor atories, 
Inc.), Quantity, Lot Number, Expi[INVESTIGATOR_5952], Study Name ( Avmacol® for autism spectrum 
disorder), Institution (UNC), PI (Politte), IRB number, “Investigational Study Material,” and 
“Caution: New Drug Limited by [CONTACT_12201] O nly.”  For an example of 
labelling, please see section 7.3.7 of the IND application.  
 
Matched placebo tablets will be manufactured and shipped from the University of Maryland 
Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences ([ADDRESS_972324]., Baltimore, MD [ZIP_CODE]) to UN C IDS in boxes 
of HDPE plastic bottles containing 200 tablets each.  The bottles will be individually labeled as 
described above.   
5.8 Blinding of Study Drug  (if applicable)  
Subjects will be randomized by [CONTACT_713967] a random numbers list, an d 
treatment assignment will not be disclosed to study staff.  Avmacol® and placebo tablets will be 
similar in shape, size, and color, and the labels on bottles dispensed to study staff and families will 
not indicate treatment assignment.  Blinding of treat ment assignment for the study team and 
subjects will be maintained until after the conclusion of all data collection.  In the event of a 
serious adverse event, a physician monitor who is not directly associated with the study (ie, an 
independent medical mo nitor) will determine if the SAE is potentially related to taking the study 
drug.  If a possible association is suspected, the pharmacy will disclose treatment status to the 
medical monitor, and the event will be reviewed by [CONTACT_713968] (DSMB) to determine if treatment discontinuation is warranted.   
 
Receiving, Storage, Dispensing and Return

 5.8.2 Storage  
The investigational drug (Avmacol®) and placebo  tablets will be stored at 2-8⁰C in the refrigerator  
in UNC Investigational Drug Services (IDS) pharmacy prior to being dispensed to study staff in the 
week prior to the designated study visit.  The study drug will be stored on site at the CIDD in a 
refrigerator used expressly for study drug storage until th e study visit, at which time it will be 
dispensed to the participant’s caregiver by [CONTACT_3476].  Caregivers will be asked to store the 
bottle  of study drug in a home refrigerator  as a precautionary measure to preserve the integrity of 
the compound, tho ugh the manufacturer of Avmacol® reports stability at room temperature.   
5.8.3 Dispensing of Study Drug  
Study drug will be dispensed by [CONTACT_713970] a 5 -week 
supply (4 week supply plus 1 week buffer) of active drug or pla cebo tablets prior to baseline, week 
4, and week 8 study visits.  The study drug will be stored on site at the CIDD in a refrigerator used 
expressly for study drug storage until the study visit, at which time it will be dispensed to the 
participant’s careg iver by [CONTACT_3476].  Caregivers will be asked to transport the investigational 
drug in a freezer bag and store the bottle of study drug in a home refrigerator  as a precautionary 
measure to preserve the integrity of the compound, though the manufacturer  of Avmacol® reports 
stability at room temperature.  Caregivers will be asked to record each administered dose on a 
medication log and to return the medication log and any unused study drug to study staff at the 
next visit.  Study drug reconciliation will be performed at week 4, week 8, and week 12 study visits 
to document drug assigned, drug consumed, and drug remaining.  This reconciliation will be 
logged on the drug accountability form, and signed and dated by [CONTACT_713971].   
 
Return or Destruction of Study Drug  
 
At the completion of the study, there will be a final reconciliation of drug shipped, drug consumed, 
and drug remaining.  This reconciliation will be logged on the drug reconciliation form, signed and 
dated.  Any discre pancies noted will be investigated, resol ved, and documented prior to 
destruction of unused study drug  by [CONTACT_18103] .  Drug destroyed on site will be documented in the study 
files.  
6 Study Procedures  
 
6.1 Pre -Screen  Phone Call : 
Prior to screening, potential partici pants will undergo a pre -screening assessment by [CONTACT_713972].  A written 
copy of the informed consent document will be provided by [CONTACT_2319], electronically, or in pe rson for 
the participant’s caregiver to read prior to the screening visit.   
 
6.2 Screening Visit:  
The screening visit will take approximately [ADDRESS_972328] obtain 
written informed consent from participants or their Legally Authorized Representatives (LAR).  
We anticipate that most subjects will not have capacity to provide informed consent themselves 
due to cognitive and/or communication deficits associated with ASD, though every effort will be 
 
Clinical Protocol: Sulforaphane for ASD  
- 27 - 
 made to increase their  participation in the consent/ assent process.  For individuals under 18 
years of age or those unable to consent due to significant cognitive or communication impairment, 
written assent for participation will be sought.  An electronic, tablet -based interac tive consent tool 
will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_713891].  
 
After written informed consent is obtained, diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) will be 
confirmed by [CONTACT_713973]: clinical review of the Diagnostic and Statistical  Manual -5 (DSM -5) [1] 
ASD criteria and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule -2 (ADOS -2) total score [106] .  The 
ADOS -[ADDRESS_972329] of ASD diagnosis [106] .  The ADOS -2 will be 
performed by a trained master’s -level clinician, and DSM -5 diagnostic criteria for ASD will be 
assessed by a study physician with extensive experience in diagnosing ASD.  ADOS -2 
administration will be videotap ed to permit clinician scoring after administration; the digital 
recording will be stored on a secure server than will be accessible only by [CONTACT_713974] a password .  Individuals must meet criteria for a diagnosis of ASD based on both 
DSM-5 cri teria (severity level 2 or 3) and ADOS -2 total score (≥8 , exceeding the “autism” cut -off) 
to be eligible for participation.  An abbreviated cogn itive assessment using the Wechsler 
Abbreviated Intelligence Scales (WASI ) two non -verbal subtests  will b e [107]  obtained for the 
purposes of data analysis, though there is no cut -off intelligence quotient (IQ) score for study 
participation.   A medical history will be obtained by [CONTACT_5989], including current 
medical conditions, past medical history , surgical history, psychiatric history, past and current 
psychotropic medications, allergies, and current non -pharmacological treatments for ASD (e.g., 
speech therapy, occupational therapy, behavioral therapy).  Caregivers will complete the Social 
Respons iveness Scale, Second Edition (SRS -2) [100] , Repetitive Behavior Scale -Revised (RBSR) 
[102] , and Aberrant Behavior Checklist - Community Edition (ABC) [103]  for baseline 
characterization of social communication deficits, repetitive behaviors, and behavioral  challenges.  
The study physician will complete the Clinical Global Impression Severity Scale (CGI -S) [104] , a 7 -
point rating scale of overall symptom severity.  Baseline bloodwork will include a comprehensive 
metabolic profile (CMP), liver function tests (LFTs), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and 
complete blood count (CBC) with white blood count differential.  Participants will be given an 
OMNIGene -Gut stabilization kit to take home and use in the collection of a stool sample in the [ADDRESS_972330] the participant and 
caregiver in the collection of the stool sample and ask them to return it at the Baseline visit.  
 
6.3 Baseline Visit (Week 0):  
The baseline visit will take approximately 1.5 hr  to complete.  Prior to the baseline visit, the study 
physician will review safety labs drawn at the screening visit (CBC, CMP, LFTs, TSH) to ensure 
eligibility for participation.  For individuals who meet all inclusionary and exclusionary criteria as 
desc ribed in sections 4.1 and 4.2, a baseline visit will be scheduled within 2 weeks of screening.  
Clinical outcome measures will again be obtained from caregivers, including the SRS -2, ABC, and 
RBSR.  The study physician will complete the CGI -S to establish baseline clinical severity of ASD 
prior to intervention.  Vital signs (height, weight, blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature) will 
be obtained by [CONTACT_464].  An adverse event log for baseline symptom assessment will be 
completed by [CONTACT_101590].  With specific written informed consent, participants will 
provide a saliva sample (approximately 2.6 mL total), either through expectoration into a special 
collection tube or through cheek swab (approximately 5 swabs).  The de -identified saliva sampl e

- 28 - 
 will be stored in the UNC Biospecimen Repository for use in a possible future study of genetic 
markers associated with clinical response to sulforaphane.  Participation in the  storage of genetic 
material is not required for participation in the primary clinical trial.  Participants will also return 
the stool sample in the OMNIGene -Gut stabilization kit, which is stable at room temperature for up 
to 60 days.  The kit will be labeled with the date and participant PIN, securely packaged in a 
Styrofoam conta iner, and mailed to the Cullman Chemoprotection Center at JHU (director, [CONTACT_714031]) for storage in cryovials at -80⁰C until all study samples have been collected.  
 
Participants will be randomly assigned at baseline to receive either the active compound  
(Avmacol®) or identical placebo tablets.  UNC IDS will be provided with a random table of 
numbers for randomization of participants, and both study staff and participants will remain 
blinded to treatment assignment.  Study staff will retrieve the investig ational product in labeled 
bottles f rom IDS and stored on site in a  refrigerator  at 2-8⁰C prior to the baseline visit.  A 5 -week 
supply of investigational drug will be dispensed to the participant and their caregiver in a labeled 
bottle by [CONTACT_60656] t he visit, and they will be instructed to transport the bottle home in a 
freezer bag (supplied by [CONTACT_464]) and store the bottle in their home refrigerator  to ensure 
compound stability (a precautionary measure; the manufacturer of Avmacol® reports stabil ity at 
room temperature).  They will be given detailed instructions for taking the medication and 
completing the medication log, which will be returned and reviewed at the participant’s next visit.  
Caregivers will also be instructed to return any remainin g tablets to the study staff at the 
following visit to determine adherence to the dosing protocol.  
 
6.4 Week 2 Telephone Call:  
The week [ADDRESS_972331]’s caregiver  2 weeks after the baseline visit to assess tolerability and general 
response.  The adverse event log will be completed by [CONTACT_099].  Caregivers will be asked to 
report any changes in concurrent medications or non -pharmacological treatments since the 
previous study visit.  
 
6.5 Week 4 Follow -Up Visit:  
The week [ADDRESS_972332] and his caregiver will return to the 
clinic for a follow -up visit that will include measurement of vital signs (height, weight, blood 
pressure,  heart rate, and temperature), caregiver completion of behavioral outcome measures 
(SRS -2, RBSR, and ABC), and clinician -rated CGI -Severity and CGI -Improvement scores.  The 
adverse event log will also be completed by [CONTACT_5989].  Caregivers will b e asked to 
report any changes in concurrent medications or non -pharmacological treatments since the 
previous study visit.  The medication log and returned tablets will be reviewed/ counted for 
treatment compliance, and the next 5 -week supply of investigati onal drug will be dispensed to the 
participant and his caregiver.  Caregivers will be instructed to administer any unused tablets from 
the previous bottle before starting the new supply.  
 
6.6 Week 8 Follow -Up Visit:  
The week 8 visit will take approximately  1 hr. to complete.  The patient and his caregiver will 
return to the clinic for a follow -up visit that will include measurement of vital signs (height, 
weight, blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature), caregiver completion of behavioral outcome 
measur es (SRS -2, RBSR, and ABC), and clinician -rated CGI -Severity and CGI -Improvement scores.

previous study visit.   The medication log and returned tablets will be reviewed/ counted for 
treatment compliance, and the next [ADDRESS_972333] to return it at the next visit.  
 
 
6.7 Week 12 Follow -Up Visit:  
The week 12 visit marks the end of the active treatment phase of the study and  will take 
approximately 2 hr. to complete.  The patient and his caregiver will return to the clinic for a 
follow -up visit that will include measurement of vital signs (height, weight, blood pressure, heart 
rate, and temperature), physical exam by [CONTACT_43038] y physician, and repeat blood draw for safety 
monitoring (CMP, LFTs, TSH, and CBC with differential).  Caregivers will complete behavioral 
outcome measures (SRS -2, RBSR, and ABC), and clinicians will assign CGI -Severity and CGI -
Improvement scores.  At this  phase -ending visit, responder status will be assigned to those with a 
10 point or greater reduction on the SRS -2 and  CGI -Improvement score of 1 or 2 (very much or 
much improved).  Partial responder status will be assigned to participants with a 10 point or 
greater reduction on the SRS -2 and a CGI -Improvement score of 3 (minimally improved).  The 
adverse event log will also be completed by [CONTACT_5989]. Caregivers will be asked to report 
any changes in concurrent medications or non -pharmacological t reatments since the previous 
study visit.    The medication log and returned tablets will be reviewed/ counted for treatment 
compliance, and any remaining investigational drug will be collected by [CONTACT_713975] .  Participants  will also return a stool sample in the OMNIGene -Gut stabilization 
kit.  The kit will be labeled with the date and participant PIN, securely packaged in a Styrofoam 
container, and mailed to the Cullman Chemoprotection Center at JHU (director, [CONTACT_714032] ) for 
storage in cryovials at -80⁰C until all study samples have been collected.  
 
 
6.8 Week 16 Follow -Up Visit/ Study Termination:  
The week 16 visit will take approximately 1 hr. to complete.  Participants and their caregivers will 
return for a follow -up v isit 4 weeks after discontinuing the investigational treatment.  The 
assessment will include measurement of vital signs (height, weight, blood pressure, heart rate, and 
temperature), caregiver completion of behavioral outcome measures (SRS -2, RBSR, and ABC ), and 
clinician -rated CGI -Severity and CGI -Improvement scores.  The adverse event log will also be 
completed by [CONTACT_5989].  Caregivers will be asked to report any changes in concurrent 
medications or non -pharmacological treatments since the prev ious study visit.  Treatment 
assignment (Avmacol® or placebo) will be obtained by [CONTACT_713976].  Participants who were assigned to take placebo will have the 
opportunity to receive a 3 -month supply o f Avmacol® at no cost, supervised by [CONTACT_713977].  Monetary compensation for study 
participation will be provided to participants and their caregiver in the form of 2 checks at the end 
of each clinic  visit, as described in section 12.3 below.

 7 Statistical Plan  
7.1 Sample Size Determination  
We calculated power for comparing groups on change in SRS -2 total score (the primary outcome 
measure), using a standard approach for linear mixed models  (Littell  RC, Milliken GA, Stroup WW, 
Wolfinger RD, Schabenberger O. SAS for mixed models [electronic resource].  Cary, N.C.: SAS 
Institute, Inc.; 2006 ). We assumed that the mean differences observed in the trial by [CONTACT_145559]. 
represented the true values (i.e., we  assumed mean differences of 7, 20, 18.4, and 0.4 at weeks 4, 8, 
12 and 16, respectively), and we assumed a constant standard deviation of 20, consistent with that 
observed by [CONTACT_145559]. Furthermore, we assume within -participants across time correlation of 
0.5 (a conservative value) and we assume no more than 15% loss distributed over the [ADDRESS_972334] 80% power for an overall test comparing groups across al l time points using a two -sided [ADDRESS_972335] at the 0.05 significance level.    
 
For the exploratory microbiota analysis, we aim to include a subset of 30 subjects in the sample. In 
a recent randomized cross -over trial of the effects of broccoli consumption on microbiota 
composition in 18 healthy adults [Kaczmarek 2017*], participants consumin g broccoli exhibited 
an increase in the ratio of Baceteroidetes to Firmicutes by 37% from baseline to end, compared to 
a 5% reduction during the control period (p=0.02). With [ADDRESS_972336] 
>80% power to detect a similar change in the ratio of Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes.

Journal, 2017. 31([ADDRESS_972337]): p.965.  
 
7.2 Statistical Methods  
General linear mixed models (GLMM)  will be used to test the primary and secondary hypotheses 
in longitudinal analyses:  
  
Primary Hypotheses  
Compared to control participants, treated participants will show larger changes over time on SRS -
2 total scores from Baseline to Week 12, and differences will not be mainta ined after treatment 
discontinuation at Week 12 through the end of the follow -up period at Week 16.   
 
GLMM analyses will describe individual patterns of change over time on the SRS -2 Total score. 
Individual intercepts and slopes will be estimated as rando m-effects variables, and will be allowed 
to correlate.  The SRS -2 scores from Baseline, Week 4, 8, 12, and 16 will be modeled as a function 
of treatment, time, time x treatment and will include covariates of age -stratum and the SRS -2 total 
score from scree ning.  In addition to time, we will add a time -varying variable representing 
treatment phase (0=treatment, 1=follow -up period) and we cross this variable with treatment, 
time, and treatment x time.  Time will be centered at Week 12.  Of interest will be th e main effect 
of treatment (i.e., treatment impact at end of active treatment), treatment x time (i.e., treatment 
impact on change over time during the active treatment phase), and treatment x time x treatment 
phase (i.e., treatment differences in change o ver time during follow -up period).   We will use an 
 
Clinical Protocol: Sulforaphane for ASD  
- [ADDRESS_972338] is sig nificant at the 5% level, we will then test for differences separately at each time point. 
We will also report estimated mean differences along with 95% confidence intervals.  
 
 
Secondary Hypotheses  
Compared to control participants, treated participates wil l show larger changes over time on CGI 
Severity and RBSR scores from Baseline to Week 12 and will show reduction in those gains after 
discontinuation through the end of the follow -up period at Week 16.  
 
Compared to control participants, treated participate s will show larger changes over time on 
subscales when treatment impacts were observed on the total scores on the SRS -2, CGI Severity, 
and RBSR from Baseline to Week 12 and will show reduction in those gains after discontinuation 
through the end of the fol low-up period at Week 16.   
 
Similar GLMM analyses will be conducted to examine the longitudinal assessments of CGI Severity 
and RBSR and of subscales if the total scores show treatment impacts.  
 
Exploratory Hypothese s  
We hypothesize that treatment with sulforaphane will result in greater diversity of  gut 
microbial species and a higher ratio of Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes spp. compared to placebo, and 
that these alterations in gut microbiota will be positively associated with behavioral 
improvements in th e sulforaphane treatment group.  
 
We will utilize Genotek's validated wet -lab and metagenomic data analytic pi[INVESTIGATOR_713892]. Microbial DNA will be extracted and amplified using 
PCR, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing w ill be performed using the Illumina MiSeq platform. A 
curated taxonomic database will be used to assign a taxonomic classification to the sequencing 
reads. The mean (%) relative abundance of microbial phyla and genera will be calculated for the 
sulforaphan e and placebo groups pre - and posttreatment.  The percent change in Bacteroidetes to 
Firmicutes (B:F) ratio from baseline to endpoint will be compared between treatment groups 
using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA), with baseline B:F ratio included as a cov ariate.  
 
Microbiota diversity and relative abundance  will be assessed using conventional within sample 
("alpha diversity") and between -sample ("beta diversity") metrics. Three metrics will be used to 
assess change in alpha diversity over time: the absolute  number of operational taxonomic units 
(OTUs), Chao1 estimator, and Shannon index. We will use ANCOVA to test for significant 
differences in alpha diversity from baseline to endpoint within each treatment group. Beta 
diversity will be assessed with 3 metri cs: Bray -Curtis dissimilarity, Weighted Unifrac distance, and 
Unweighted Unifrac distance. These indices will be used  to determine the variance in an individual 
over time and the mean dissimilarity between individuals in each group. Weighted Unifrac 
distan ce will be used for Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA). We will create a PCoA plot to 
visually identify whether samples from each treatment group cluster together at different time 
points (before and after treatment). This can help determine whether any  changes identified 
during beta diversity analysis are directed changes or random noise.  
 
Clinical Protocol: Sulforaphane for ASD  
- [ADDRESS_972339] Population(s) for Analysis  
Study analysis will include all available data from all randomized subjects who receiv ed at least 
one dose of study medication and participated in at least one post -baseline efficacy assessment 
(i.e., intent -to-treat population).  Missing outcome data will not be imputed and will be assumed to 
be missing at random.  
8 Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1 Definitions  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency   (i.e. not described in study -related documents 
such as the IRB -approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc)  
 Related or possibly related to participation in the research  (i.e. possibly related means there 
is a reasonable possibility  that the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused 
by [CONTACT_3459],  
 Serious  (as defined below)  “ Serious” is different than “severe” as reported in the CTC 
criteria that applies a grade to the AE.  
 
Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in 
severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries will  be regarded as 
adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are consi dered to be adverse events if 
the abnormality:  
 results in study withdrawal  
 is associated with a serious adverse event  
 is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
 leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
 is considered by [CONTACT_713978] -serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
 fatal  
 life-threatening  
 requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
 results in persistent or significant di sability or incapacity  
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 an important medical event  
 
Clinical Protocol: Sulforaphane for ASD  
- [ADDRESS_972340], and may require intervention to 
prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a 
seizure that did not result in in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in 
an emergency department would ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_15355].  
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non -
serious adverse events .  
 
Based on previous clinical trials of sulforaphane in humans [43, 48, 51] , we do not anticipate any 
sign ificant adverse events with Avmacol®, though the following gastrointestinal symptoms may 
potentially occur with greater frequency:  
 
 Nausea and vomiting  
 Abdominal pain  
 Large or soft stools  
 Constipation  
 Diarrhea  
 Weight gain  
 
In a randomized, controlled trial of sulforaphane for autism spectrum disorder conducted by 
[CONTACT_145559]. [48] , 2 subjects with a history of seizures had single unprovoked seizures during the 
course of the study (one after 3 weeks on sulforaphane, one 3 wee ks after discontinuing 
sulforaphane), and the possibility of seizure as a potential adverse effect of sulforaphane could not 
be ruled out.  In our proposed study, a history of clinical seizure in the year prior to screening is an 
exclusionary criterion for  safety reasons.  
 
One  subject enrolled in this trial experienced a worsening of behavioral symptoms that may or 
may not have been directly study related.  
 
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which adverse even ts must be reported is defined as the period from the 
initiation of any study procedures to the end of the study treatment follow -up.  For this study, the 
study treatment follow -up is defined as [ADDRESS_972341] administration of study 
treatment.   
 
Preexisting Condition  
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.   A preexisting condition will  
be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition 
worsens during the study period.  
 
General Physical Examinat ion Findings  
 
Clinical Protocol: Sulforaphane for ASD  
- 34 - 
 At screening, any clinicall y significant abnormality will  be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At 
interval study visits and at the end of the study, any new clinically significant 
findings/abnormalities that meet the defi nition of an adver se event will also be recorded and 
documented as an adverse event.   
 
Post -study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events will  be followed by [CONTACT_1374], 
the subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherw ise explained.  At the l ast scheduled 
visit, the study physician will  instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the 
subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation 
in this study.   
 
 
Abnormal Laboratory Values  
A clinic al laboratory abnormality will  be documented as an adverse event if any one of the 
following  conditions is met:   
 The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm the 
abnormality  
 The abnormalit y suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity  
 The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; e.g. change of dose, 
discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow -up assessments, further diagnostic 
investigation, etc.  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_713893] a serious advers e event .  Any conditio n responsible for surgery will  be 
documented as an adverse event if the cond ition meets the criteria for an  adverse event.   
 
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an 
adverse event in the following circumstances:  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] o r prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_713894] a preexisting condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse 
event if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was 
uneventfu l. 
8.[ADDRESS_972342] , the investigator will  seek information on adverse events by 
[CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Informat ion on all adverse events will  
be recorded immediately in the so urce document, and also in th e appropriate adverse event log  of 
the case report form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagn ostic 
procedures results will be recorded in the so urce document, though grouped under one diagnosis.  
 
All a dverse events occ urring during the study period will  be recorded  in the adverse event log .  
The clin ical course of each event will  be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been 
determined that the study treatment or participation is not  the cause.  Serious adverse events that 
 
Clinical Protocol: Sulforaphane for ASD  
- 35 - 
 are still ongoing at the end of  the study period will be followed up, either by [CONTACT_713979], to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study period 
and is consid ered to be possibly related to the study treatme nt or study participation will  be 
recorded and reported immediately  to the FDA, UNC Biomedical IRB, and DSMB . 
8.3 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events and Unanticipated Problems  
The study PI [INVESTIGATOR_713895] t any serious adverse events to the FDA, UNC Biomedical IRB,

adverse event that is rare in the absence of drug exposure (such as agranulocytosis, hepatic 
necrosis, Stevens -Johnson syndrome).  
 Any adverse event that would cause the sponsor to modify the inv estigator’s brochure, protocol 
or informed consent form, or would prompt other action by [CONTACT_284581].  
 Information that indicates a change to the risks or potential benefits of the research, in terms of 
severity or frequency. For example:  
– Safety monitoring indicates that a particular side effect is more severe, or more frequent 
than initially expected.  
– A paper is published from another study that shows that an arm of your research study 
is of no therapeutic value.  
 Change in FDA safety labeling or withdrawal from marketing of a drug, device, or biologic 
used in a research protocol.  
 Breach of confidentiality  
 Change to the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate apparent immediate 
hazard to a research participant.  
 Incarceration of a participant when the research was not previously approved under 
Subpart C and the investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject to remain on 
the study.  
 Complaint of a participant when the complaint indicates unexpected risks or the complaint 
cannot be resolved by [CONTACT_5051].  
 Protocol violation (meaning an accidental or unintentional deviation fro m the IRB approved 
protocol) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_445653], or affects the rights or welfare of subjects.   If a large number of protocol 
deviations are identified, or if they are deemed to affect patient safety or the overall efficacy 
of the trial, the protocol deviations will also be reported to the DSMB.   
8.3.3 Investigator reporting:  
Not applicable, as this is a single -site study.  
8.3.4 Sponsor reporting: Notifying the FDA  
 
The study PI (study sponsor) wi ll promptly complete a written IND safety report for any adverse 
event meeting the following criteria:  
 
 Within 7 calendar days  
Any study event that is : 
– associated with the use of the study drug  
– unexpected,  
– fatal or life -threatening, and  
 
 Within 15 calendar days  
 
Clinical Protocol: Sulforaphane for ASD

 Any study event that is : 
– associated with the use of the study drug,  
– unexpected, and  
– serious, but not fatal or life -threatening  
-or- 
– a previous adverse event that was not initially deemed reportable but is later found to fit 
the criteria for r eporting (reporting within 15 calendar days from when event was 
deemed reportable).  
 
Additional reporting requirements  
The study PI (sponsor) will  identify in IND safety reports all previous reports concernin g similar 
adverse events and analyze the signifi cance of the current event in light of the previous reports.  
 
Reporting Process  
Adverse events will  be submitted on FDA Form  3500A or in a narrative format, along with FDA 
form 1571.  If supplied as in a narrative format, the minimum information to be supp lied is noted 
above at the beginning of section 8.3.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_972343]’s study participation.  
Treatment unblinding will be limited to the occurrence of a serious adverse event (SAE ) that the 
independent medical monitor determines is  possibly related to study treatment and study 
participation.   In the event of such an unanticipated problem, study staff will contact [CONTACT_713980] -call pager (919 -216-9727)  to report the occurrence of the event and request that treatment 
assignment status be disclosed to the independent medical monitor.  The study staff and 
participant and caregiver will remain blinded to treatment.  The treatment status will be faxed by 
[CONTACT_713981] (e.g., 
emergency room physician, primary care physician).  A narrative description of the SAE and 
treatment status will be documented in the CRF, and the FDA and UNC IR B will be promptly 
notified as specified above in Section 8.3.1.  
8.5 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]  
 If a participant experiences significant adverse events that affect tolerability, may 
reasonably be related to taking the investigational product, and do not meet the protocol  
definition for a serious AE  (including non-extreme behavi oral changes ), the dose may be 
reduced by [CONTACT_3450] 30% according to the following dose modification schedule:

 If the dose is reduced during the course of the study, the participant will continue the 
lowered dose for the remainder of the study.  If adverse events do not im prove within [ADDRESS_972344] may be permanently discontinued at 
the discretion of the treating study physician, participant, and participant’s guardian. If a 
participant exhibits extreme exacerbation of behavioral symptoms (such as self -injurious 
behavior or aggression) that do not improve substantially following a dose reduction and 
are determined “probably” or “definitely” related to taking the investigational product, the 
investigational product may be permanentl y discontinued sooner than [ADDRESS_972345] cyclical 
changes in behavior independent of medication effects, the study staff will rely on 
caregivers’ experience with the participant t o determine if any observed behavior changes 
are within the expected range for that individual.  If the investigational product is stopped 
permanently, the participant and his caregiver will be asked to complete the remainder of 
the study visits, return an y unused study drug, and repeat safety lab studies.  
 If a participant has a seizure while taking the study medication, the study medication will 
be stopped, and the DSMB will be notified.  The participant will be evaluated by [CONTACT_80278] [INVESTIGATOR_713897] t’s primary care physician, treated, and monitored appropriately for 
the duration of the study.  The participant and his caregiver will be asked to return to 
complete the remainder of the study visits, return any unused study drug, and repeat safety 
lab st udies.  
 If the participant newly requires a long -term medication that is thought to interact 
adversely with the study medication, the study medication will be stopped.  The participant 
and his caregiver will be asked to return to complete the remainder of t he study visits, 
return any unused study drug, and repeat safety lab studies.  
 If a participant experiences a serious adverse event that is thought to be related to taking 
the study medication (as determined by [CONTACT_605605]), the study 
medication will be permanently discontinued, and the appropriate overseeing regulatory 
organizations will be notified (FDA, IRB, and DSMB).  The participant and his caregiver will 
 
Clinical Protocol: Sulforaphane for ASD  
- 39 - 
 be asked to return to complete the remainder of the study visits, return any unused study 
drug, and repeat safety lab studies.  
 Potential reasons for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_713898] y include: occurrence of a grade 3(severe) or 
grade 4 (life -threatening)  SAE in more than one participant that an independent medical 
monitor and DSMB believe i s likely related to active treatment; new information from other 
clinical trials that indicate serious risks associated with oral administration of a 
sulforaphane product; the death of a participant that is determined to be related to the 
study interventio n; and insufficient funds to complete study tasks.  
8.6 Medical Monitoring  
It is the  primary responsibility of the Principle  Investigator  to oversee the saf ety of the study .  This 
safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of ad verse events as 
noted above, as well as the constructi on and implementation of a data and safety -monitoring plan  
(DSMP)  (see section 9 Auditing, Monitoring and Inspecting).  A medical monitor (ie, a physician 
not directly affiliated with the study) will be  retained to review any SAEs and determine if the SAE 
may reasonably be related to treatment status.  
8.6.[ADDRESS_972346]   or DSMP   
The North Carolina Translational and Clinical Science (NC TraCS) Institute Data and Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB) will provide additional safety and oversight for the proposed trial. The 
NC TraCS DSMB will consist of a chair, an ethicist, an epi[INVESTIGATOR_47561], a biostatistician, and one or 
more clinical researchers, each serving three year terms (please see Attachment 6C, NC TraCS 
DSMB Charter, for a listing of current Committee members).  The DSMB will review all SAEs and 
any seizure events, which the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_713899] 7 calendar 
days of the event.  The DSMB will also r eview safety information (abnormal baseline and end -of-
treatment screening labs; unanticipated problems; significant physical exam findings) in a face -to-
face meeting after every [ADDRESS_972347] 
the confidentiality of participants.  Due to the relatively small size and anticipation of minimal risk 
associated with this s tudy, no interim data analysis is planned.   
The DSMB staff or chair will prepare minutes of each meeting within ten (10) working days of 
each meeting.  These minutes will be circulated and approved at the next regularly scheduled 
meeting of the DSMB.  The  DSMB will report their findings to the UNC Biomedical IRB, as 
appropriate, and will make any recommendations directly to the IRB and to the study PI.  
[ADDRESS_972348] of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those 
regul ations require a signed subject/ LAR authorization informing the subject of the following:  
 
Clinical Protocol: Sulforaphane for ASD  
- 40 - 
  What protected health informati on (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
 Who will have access to that information and why  
 Who will use or disclose that information  
 The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 
In the event that a sub ject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by 
[CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject 
authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, a ttempts should 
be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end 
of their scheduled study period.  
9.2 Source Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities 
in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source data are 
contained in source documents.  Examples of these original documents, and data records include: 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office cha rts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or 
evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_10379], microfiches, 
photogra phic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, subject files, and records kept at the 
pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico -technical departments involved in the clinical trial.  
 
Source documents will be maintained behind two levels of locked doors (ie, in a locked room on a 
floor with badge -access only).  Only study staff directly involved in data collection, entry, and 
analysis and independent monitoring personnel will have access to source documents.  
9.3 Case Report Forms   
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  All data 
requested on the CRF must be recorded.  All missing data must be explained.  If a space on the CRF 
is left blank because the procedure was not done or the question was not asked,  write “N/D”.  If 
the item is not applicable to the individual case, write “N/A”.  All entries should be printed legibly 
in black ink.  If any entry error has been made, to correct such an error, draw a single straight line 
through the incorrect entry and enter the correct data above it.  All such changes must be initialed 
and dated.  DO NOT ERASE OR WHITE OUT ERRORS.  For clarification of illegible or uncertain 
entries, print the clarification above the item, then initial and date it.  
9.4 Records Retention  
 
It is the investigator’s  responsibility to retain essential study documents  for at least 3 years after 
the study is completed and the FDA is notified (in accordance with 21 CFR 312.62).

 16 Appendix 6B: Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
 
I. RISKS TO SUBJECTS  
a. Human Subjects Involvement and Characteristics: Approval from the UNC IRB for this 
research project will be obtained prior to any recruitment or involvement of human subjects.  The study 
will include 54 healthy adolescent and young adult males, ages 13 -30 years old, with a diagnosis of 
Autism Spectrum D isorder (ASD)  severity level 2 or 3 , confirmed by [CONTACT_713960] -5 diagnostic 
criteria for ASD , and exceeding the ASD  cut-off score of 8 on the Autism Diagnostic Observation 
Scheduled -2 (ADOS -2).  The study population will be limited to male subjects for tw o primary reasons: 
(a) we aim to conduct an independent replication of a previous clinical trial of sulforaphane in ASD [1], 
which included only male participants; (b) potential mechanistic differences in ASD between males and 
females may lead to excessive  heterogeneity in this relatively small sample size (ASD is 4 times more 
common in males than females).  The proposed study includes adolescents and adults with 
developmental disabilities, both vulnerable populations, rather than healthy volunteers because  the 
study intervention, a nutraceutical containing broccoli extracts, may provide specific benefit for social 
deficits observed in ASD, but is not expected to confer behavioral benefits for those without ASD.  The 
intervention also has a well -documented s afety profile and is considered low -risk.  Furthermore, 
interventions in children with developmental disorders are likely to have greater impact than similar 
treatments at a later stage of development due to increased neuroplasticity early in development.  The 
study will exclude individuals with significant medical problems and active seizure disorders (defined 
as clinical seizure activity in the 12 months preceding the study) due to theoretical increased risk of 
seizure with sulforaphane treatment [1].  Individuals taking chronic anti -inflammatory agents, such as 
corticosteroids or non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs, will also be excluded due to potential 
confounding of results.   
 
Subjects will primarily be recruited from the Carolina Institute for Deve lopmental Disabilities Research 
Subject Registry, which includes more than [ADDRESS_972375] information of study staff.  Participants will also be recruited from the clinical practices of 
physicians, psychologists, and allied health staff at the Carolina I nstitute for Developmental Disabilities 
as well as from referring providers.  Electronic and written advertisements will be disseminated to local 
community autism support agencies (e.g., Autism Society of North Carolina, Autism Resource 
Centers).  All adve rtisement materials will first be approved by [CONTACT_713959].  
 
Enrolled participants will be stratified for age (13 -18 and 19 -30 years) to account for possible effects of 
age on treatment response.  The goal is to recruit twenty -seven  13-18 year -olds and twenty -seven  19-30 
year-olds to allow for secondary analysis by [CONTACT_551] .  Individuals will be randomly assigned to 
treatment group within age strata by [CONTACT_713965] (i.e., 1 -27 
for younger g roup and 1 -27 for older group).  The larger half of the random numbers within each group 
will be assigned to receive the treatment and the smaller half to the control condition.  These two lists – 
listed in their original order (1 -27 for younger and 1 -27 for older) will be provided to UNC 
Investigational Drug Services (IDS) pharmacists.  They will consult the list and provide the appropriate 
medication to each individual depending on the order in which they present to the pharmacy within their 
age group.  S tudy personnel will remain blinded to treatment condition for the duration of the study.  
 
 
Clinical Protocol: Sulforaphane for ASD

 During the course of the study, participants will take 3 -8 Avmacol© or placebo tablets once daily by 
[CONTACT_5555] a total of 12 weeks, with dosing regimen based on weigh t as follows:  
 
3 tablets (approx. 46.5 µmol SF) daily if <100 lb  
5 tablets (approx. 77.5 µmol SF) daily if 100 -125 lb  
6 tablets (approx. 93 µmol SF) daily if 126 -175 lb  
7 tablets (approx. 108.5 µmol SF) daily if 176 -199 lb  
8 tablets (approx. 124 µmol SF) d aily if ≥ [ADDRESS_972376], and do not meet the protocol definition for a serious AE  (including 
behavioral changes that are not severe) , the dose may be reduced by [CONTACT_3450] 30% according to 
the following dose modification schedule:

*Rounded down if equidistant between two [ADDRESS_972377] may be permanently discontinued at the discretion of the treating study 
physician, participant, and participant’s guardian. If a participant exhibits extreme exacerbation of 
behavioral symptoms (such as self -injurious behavior or aggression) that do not improve substantially 
following a dose reduction and are de termined “probably” or “definitely” related to taking the 
investigational product, the investigational product may be permanently discontinued sooner than [ADDRESS_972378] cyclical 
changes in behavior independent of medication effects, the study staff will rely on caregivers’ 
experience with the participant to determine if any observed behavior changes are within the expected 
range for that individual.  If the investigational product is stopped permanently, the participant and his 
caregiver will be asked to complete the remainder of the study visits, return any unused study drug, and 
repeat safety lab studies.

 b. Source of Materials:  Data collection will primarily include clinical and b ehavioral information, 
including: medical history, medication/treatment history, developmental history, behavioral 
questionnaires/ inventories, clinical assessment for ASD, cognitive evaluation, report of adverse events, 
and physical examination.  Phleboto my will be performed at screening and at the end of the active 
treatment phase (Week 12 visit) for (a) basic safety lab monitoring (complete blood count, 
comprehensive metabolic panel, liver function tests, and thyroid stimulating hormone) .  Stool samples 
will be collection at Baseline and Week 12 for analysis of microbiota diversity and relative abundance.  
 
c. Potential Risks: Cruciferous plants, including broccoli sprouts, are widely regarded as safe for 
ingestion and are regular dietary components in many r egions of the world.  Based on previous data 
from clinical trials of broccoli sprout extracts (BSE), we anticipate few, if any, adverse effects, as 
summarized below:  
 
A Phase I study of orally administered sulforaphane - and glucoraphanin -containing BSE (75  µmol 
glucosinolates, 300 µmol glucosinolates, or 75 µmol isothiocyanates daily) for 7 days in 12 healthy 
volunteers did not demonstrate any clinical adverse events [2].  Two of 12 subjects assigned to active 
treatment demonstrated an increase in plasma AL T exceeding the upper limit of normal, though ALT 
levels rose for all subjects during the course of the study (including those assigned to placebo control), 
and the increase was not clearly attributable to consumption of BSE.  Three of 12 subjects (2 activ e 
treatment, 1 placebo) demonstrated TSH levels exceeding the upper limit of normal during or after the 
dosing period, though elevated TSH was not associated with clinical symptoms or T3/T4 abnormalities.   
 
Egner et al. [3] conducted a cross -over trial in  [ADDRESS_972379] a sulforaphane -rich 
beverage (150 µmol/day) for [ADDRESS_972380] on liver and kidney func tion [4]. 
 
A study of orally administered broccoli sprout homogenates (25 to 300 g) in 57 subjects over 3 separate 
days found no adverse effects aside from mild digestive effects [5].  Similarly, in a RCT of 20 men with 
recurrent prostate cancer treated wi th sulforaphane 200 µmol/ day for 20 weeks, no serious adverse 
events occurred, though some reported mild gastrointestinal upset [6]. 
 
A randomized, placebo -controlled trial of the sulforaphane product Prostaphane® in [ADDRESS_972381] daily dosing of 
sulforaphane to date (338 µmol) [7].  No serious adverse events were reported, though gastrointestinal 
bloating was experienced somewhat more often in the SF group (N=17 vs.  N=10), and one participant in 
the SF group withdrew from the study due to bowel discomfort.  The differences in symptoms between 
the two groups were not statistically significant (p=0.149).  Furthermore, no significant between -group 
differences were found  for body weight, BMI, blood counts, and chemistries.  
 
In a RCT of 45 male subjects with autism, ages 13 -30, administered sulforaphane 50 -150 µmol/day for 
16 weeks, no significant differences in adverse events or safety labs (blood counts, chemistries, liv er 
function tests, TSH) were reported [1].   Two subjects with a history of seizures had single unprovoked 
seizures during the course of the study (one after 3 weeks on sulforaphane, one 3 weeks after 
 
Clinical Protocol: Sulforaphane for ASD  
- 51 - 
 discontinuing sulforaphane ), and the possibility of seizure as a potential adverse effect of sulforaphane 
could not be ruled out.  
 
One subject enrolled in the current trial experienced a worsening of behavioral symptoms that may or 
may not have been directly study related.  
 
Finally , there is some evidence from animal studies and in vitro studies suggesting that sulforaphane 
and/or its metabolites can inhibit expression of CYP 1A2, 3A4, and 2D6, which could be a potential 
source of drug -drug interactions if the participant is taking medications that are substrates of these 
enzymes.  The risk of possible drug -drug interactions is not well -established.  Upon reviewing the 
participants concurrent medications at screening and all subsequent visits, the study physician will 
consult an exte nsive P450 Table to identify possible d rug-drug interactions. If the participant develops 
significant adverse effects that appear consistent with increased exposure to a concurrent medication 
metabolized by 1A2, 3A4, or 2D6, t he dose of SF will be lowered by 30% as specified in the 
protocol.   If the adverse events persist  14-day post -reduction , SF may be permanently discontinued at 
the discretion of the study physician, participant, and guardian.  
 
In summary, based on available data from human clinical tria ls of SF -rich compounds, SF appears to be 
extremely well -tolerated with minimal risk aside from mild gastrointestinal symptoms, which may 
include bloating, nausea, and loose stools.  No significant changes in blood counts, serum chemistries, 
liver function , kidney function, or thyroid function are anticipated.  As it is unclear if sulforaphane may 
lower the seizure threshold in those with a history of seizures, our study will exclude those with a 
history of seizure within the previous year.  As with any med ication, there is a theoretical risk of allergic 
reaction, and participants and their caregivers will be instructed on how to identify possible signs of 
allergic reaction.  Additional risks include mild physical discomfort, psychological distress, or mild 
bruising and bleeding associated with phlebotomy.  Participants will be offered the use of a local 
anesthetic (EMLA cream) prior to blood draw to minimize physical discomfort, and there is a small risk 
of transient local reaction to EMLA cream, including p aleness, erythema, and edema.  Many individuals 
with ASD experience oral sensory aversions, and some could find taking multiple medication tablets on 
a daily basis unpleasant.   
 
Though every effort will be taken to ensure the protection of confidential information, there is a small 
risk to privacy in the event that security measures are breeched.  In addition, participants may experience 
some mild anxiety or psychological distress  in answering questions about their psychiatric and medical 
history.   
 
II. ADEQUACY OF PROTECTION AGAINST RISKS  
 
a. Recruitment and Informed Consent:  Subjects will primarily be recruited from the Carolina 
Institute for Developmental Disabilities Research Subjec t Registry, which includes more than [ADDRESS_972382] information of study staff.  Participants will also 
be recruited from the clinical practices of physicians, psychologists, and allied health staff at the 
Carolina Institute for Developmental Disabilitie s as well as from referring providers.  Electronic and 
written advertisements will be disseminated to local community autism support agencies (e.g., Autism 
 
Clinical Protocol: Sulforaphane for ASD  
- 52 - 
 Society of North Carolina, Autism Resource Centers).  All advertisement materials will first be 
approved by [CONTACT_713959].   
 
Participants and their caregivers/ Legally Authorized Representatives (LARs) will be provided with a 
written copy of the Informed Consent document to read thoroughly prior to the initial screening visit.  
Due to social communication and cognitive deficits inherent in ASD, we anticipate that most 
participants, including those 18 years and older, will not be capable of providing adequate informed 
consent.  For subjects unable to provide informed consent, either  due to age or cognitive disability, 
every effort will be made to obtain written informed assent.  To enhance the ability of participants to 
participate meaningfully in the consent/ assent process, a novel electronic tablet -based consent tool will 
be utili zed during the consent process.  Informed consent from the caregiver or participant will be 
obtained prior to conducting any study -related measures or activities.   Participants or their LARs will 
sign a separate stored specimen consent form for the de -identified storage of a saliva specimen for 
possible future genetic analysis. Subjects will still be allowed to participate in the primary clinical trial 
if they do not consent for specimen storage.  
 
b. Protection against risk: Risks to participants will be minim ized through frequent follow -up and 
careful consideration of all reported symptoms and concerns of participants and their caregivers.  The 
study PI [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a designated physician colleague will be available by [CONTACT_713987]/or mobile phone 24/7 for 
any emergencies or urgent concerns about potential adverse events during the course of the study.  
Adverse events will be monitored and recorded at each study visit and with a phone call at week 2 after 
beginning the study intervention.  Safety labs (complete blood count with differential, chemistries, liver 
function tests, and thyroid stimulating hormone) will be obtained at screening and again at the 
completion of the active treatment phase, and the data will be reviewed periodically by [CONTACT_713988].   
 
The minor risks associated with phlebotomy will be minimized through use of calming behavioral 
strategies, offering topi[INVESTIGATOR_713903], and having the blood draw performed by 
[CONTACT_713989].  The maximum amount 
of blood drawn at any visit will not exceed 2 ml/kg body weight.  To minimize risk of psychological 
distress associated with routine assessment and answering questions about personal history, every effort 
will be made to provide a relaxed atmosphere with as little waiting time as possible; breaks will be 
offered as needed.  Confidentiality will be protected by [CONTACT_713990], which will be labeled with a designated participan t number and initials only.   Paper 
charts will be maintained in a locked file cabinet behind two locked doors and will only be accessed by 
[CONTACT_713991].  Electronic data files will be 
protected  by [CONTACT_713992], and only study staff directly involved in data collection/ entry 
and monitors from regulatory agencies will have access to them.  Saliva specimens will be stored in a 
locked cabinet and labeled with a personal identifier number  rather than patient name, and the key will 
be maintained in an encryption -protected digital file accessed only by [CONTACT_713993].  
 
If a participant experiences significant adverse events that affect tolerability, may reasonably be rel ated 
to taking the investigational product, and do not meet the prot ocol definition for a serious AE  (including 
non-extreme behavioral symptoms) , the dose may be reduced by [CONTACT_3450] 30% according to the

caregiver will be asked to complete the remainder of the study visits, return any unused study drug, and 
repeat safety lab studies.  
 
There is some evidence from animal studies and in vitro studies suggesting that sulf oraphane and/or its 
metabolites can inhibit expression of CYP 1A2, 3A4, and 2D6, which could be a potential source of 
drug-drug interactions if the participant is taking medications that are substrates of these enzymes.  The 
risk of possible drug -drug inte ractions is not well -established.  Upon reviewing the participants 
concurrent medications at screening and all subsequent visits, the study physician will consult an 
extensive P450 Table to identify possible drug -drug interactions.  If the participant deve lops significant 
adverse effects that appear consistent with increased exposure to a concurrent medication metabolized 
by 1A2, 3A4, or 2D6 and do not improve with a 30% investigational product dose reduction within [ADDRESS_972385] may be recommended .   
 
 
Clinical Protocol: Sulforaphane for ASD  
- [ADDRESS_972386] adversely with the 
study medication, the study medication will be stopped.  The participant and his caregiver will be asked 
to return to complete the remainder of the study visits, return any unused study drug, an d repeat safety 
lab studies.  
 
If a participant experiences a serious adverse event that is thought to be related to taking the study 
medication  (as determined by [CONTACT_605605] , the study medication will be 
permanently discontinued, and the  appropriate overseeing regulatory organizations will be notified 
(FDA, IRB, and DSMB). The participant and his caregiver will be asked to return to complete the 
remainder of the study visits, return any unused study drug, and repeat safety lab studies.  
 
III. POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH TO THE SUBJECTS AND 
OTHERS  
 
Preliminary evidence suggests that sulforaphane can improve social relatedness and have an overall 
calming effect for some individuals with ASD [1].  Treatment with sulforaphane may als o improve 
mitochondrial dysfunction and redox imbalance, both of which have been implicated in autism.  Broader 
benefits for the autism community include new knowledge about a safe and potentially efficacious 
treatment for core symptoms of autism, for whic h current treatment options are limited.  
 
IV. IMPORTANCE OF THE KNOWLEDGE TO BE GAINED  
 
ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is now estimated to affect 1 in 68 children in the U.S., 
including 1 in 42 boys [8], and leads to substantial, lifelong burden for individuals, families, and 
communities.  Use of psychiatric medication in ASD is high with 66% of affected individuals taking at 
least 1 psychotropic medication by [CONTACT_449738] [9]. Faced with heavy side effec t burden and often 
limited efficacy, caregivers frequently turn to supplements that promise low toxicity but lack rigorous 
investigation and oversight. To date, no pharmacological agents have indication for the treatment of core 
social communication impair ments in autism, and safe, evidence -based, rationally -developed treatments 
for ASD are greatly needed.  Sulforaphane has shown initial promise as a well -tolerated and potentially 
efficacious treatment for ASD in a small clinical trial [1], though this find ing warrants replication before 
being adopted into clinical practice more widely.  The form of sulforaphane used in the ASD study by 
[CONTACT_145559]. [1] is also prohibitively expensive to manufacture on a large scale and no longer produced in 
the United State s, and Avmacol© (Nutramax, Inc), a sulforaphane precursor, is a far less costly and 
more readily available alternative.  It is not yet clear if a sulforaphane precursor (and converting 
enzyme) will have benefit similar to direct ingestion of sulforaphane, and the currently proposed study 
will contribute to knowledge about the efficacy and safety of this widely available nutraceutical for the 
treatment of ASD.

 V. DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN  
a. Definitions of Unanticipated Problems, Adverse Events, and Seriou s Adverse Events  
1. Unanticipated Problems  Involving Risk to Subjects or  Others  is any incident, 
experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency   (i.e. not described in study -related 
documents such as the IRB -approved protocol or consent form, the investigator’s brochure, etc.),  
 Related or possibly related to participation in the research  (i.e. possibly related means 
there is a reasonable possibil ity that the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused 
by [CONTACT_3459],  
 Serious (as defined below)  “ Serious” is different than “severe” as reported in the CTC 
criteria that applies a grade to the AE.  
 
2. An adverse event  (AE)  is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or 
worsens in severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries will be 
regarded as adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures (eg, laboratory values ) 
are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
 results in study withdrawal  
 is associated with a serious adverse event  
 is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
 leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
 is considered by [CONTACT_713994]  
 
3.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
 fatal 
 life-threatening  
 requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
 results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 an important medical event (of major clinical significance and may require intervention 
to prevent one of the serious outcomes noted above)  
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious will be regarded as non-serious 
adverse events .  
 
b. Monitoring of adverse events: The study physician will review AEs with the participant and 
family member at each study visit (baseline, week 2, week 4, week 8, week 12, week 16), and patients 
and their families will have 24/7 access to the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a de signated covering physician by [CONTACT_648]/ 
pager to report possible AEs as needed between visits.  AEs will be recorded on an AE log and assigned 
a numerical grade of 0 (not at all a problem), 1 (mild problem), 2 (moderate problem), and 3 (severe 
problem).  As previously noted, an AE rated as severe (“3”) is distinct from classification of a serious 
AE, defined above.  The study period during which adverse events must be reported is defined as the 
period from the initiation of any study procedures to the end of the study treatment follow -up.  For this 
 
Clinical Protocol: Sulforaphane for ASD  
- [ADDRESS_972387] administration of study 
treatment.   
 
 A preexisting condition  is a reported symptom, clinically significant physical exam finding, or 
laboratory finding that is present at the start of the study and will be recorded as an adverse event if the 
frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period.  At interval study 
visits and at the end of the study, any ne w clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the 
definition of an adverse event will also be recorded and documented as an adverse event.   
 
All unresolved adverse events will be followed by [CONTACT_1374], the 
subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the 
study physician will instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the 
subject’s personal physician, believes might r easonably be related to participation in this study.   
 
c. Entity responsible for monitoring: The study PI [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a designated Co -Investigator will be the 
primary individual responsible for eliciting, recording, and monitoring AEs, and the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_713904] (e.g., 
IRB, DSMB, FDA) in a timely manner.  Additional monitoring entities for this study will include the 
University of North Carolina IRB and the North Carolina  Translational and Clinical Science (NC 
TraCS) Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).  
Any study -related unanticipated problem posing risk of harm to subjects or others, and any type of 
serious adverse event (SAE), will be reported to the FDA wi thin 7 calendar days using FDA Form 
3500A for mandatory reporting.  SAEs will also be reporting to the UNC IRB by [CONTACT_9154] [INVESTIGATOR_713896] 
(the IRB information system for UNC) as well as the NC TraCS DSMB within [ADDRESS_972388], a biostatistician, and one or 
more clinical res earchers, each serving three year terms (please see attached TraCS DSMC Charter for a 
listing of current Committee members).  The DSMB will review all SAEs, which the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_713905] 7 calendar days of the event.  The DSMB will also  review safety 
information (baseline and end -of-treatment screening labs; adverse event forms; significant physical 
exam findings) after every [ADDRESS_972389] the co nfidentiality of participants.  Due to the relatively small size and 
anticipation of minimal risk associated with this study, no interim data analysis is planned.  The DSMB 
will report their findings to the UNC Biomedical IRB as appropriate.  
 
Though not ex pected, any of the following events will also be reported to the UNC IRB:  
 Any adverse experience that, even without detailed analysis, represents a serious unexpected 
adverse event that is rare in the absence of drug exposure (such as agranulocytosis, hepa tic 
necrosis, Stevens -Johnson syndrome).  
 Any adverse event that would cause the sponsor -investigator to modify the investigators brochure, 
protocol, or informed consent form, or would prompt other action by [CONTACT_713995].  
 
Clinical Protocol: Sulforaphane for ASD  
- 57 - 
  Information that indicates a change to the risks or potential benefits of the research, in terms of 
severity or frequency. For example, safety monitoring indicates that a particular side effect is 
more severe, or more frequent than initially expected.  
 Breach of confidentiality  
 Change to the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate apparent immediate hazard to 
a research participant.  
 Incarceration of a participant when the research was not previously approved under Subpart C 
and the sponsor -investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject to remain on the study.  
 Complaint of a participant when the complaint indicates unexpected risks or the complaint cannot 
be resolved by [CONTACT_5051].  
 Protocol violation (meaning an acciden tal or unintentional deviation from the IRB approved 
protocol) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_713906], or affects the rights or welfare of subjects.

 Introduction  
 
The North Carolina Translational and Clinical Sciences (TraCS) Institute is committed to the safety of patients 
participating in clinical trials at our institution.  In addition, it is committed to data accuracy and protocol 
compliance.  The NC TraCS Institute has establishe d an institutional plan to provide data safety and monitoring 
for selected clinical trials conducted at UNC.  This plan is designed to comply with policies and guidelines 
regarding data and safety monitoring from the National Institutes of Health 
(http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice -files/not98 -084.html ; http://nih.gov/grants/guide/notice -files/NOT -OD-00-
038.html ).   
 
This charter is for the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) of the North Carolina TraCS Institute.  The 
charter contains the following:  
 A description of the composition and organization of the DSMB  
 Details the roles and responsibili ties of DSMB members  
 Outlines the responsibilities of the Principal Investigators and Sponsors  
 Lists important contact [CONTACT_713997] a committee within the NC TraCS Institute.  The charge to the DSMB is review clinic al 
trials to assure patient safety both by [CONTACT_256435] (AEs) and interim analyses of both safety and 
efficacy.  
 
Committee Structure  
The DSMB Chair (currently [CONTACT_177488]) has the overall responsibility for the chairing the DSMB committee 
and reporting its findings to the UNC Biomedical IRB.  The Committee will be under the direct supervision of the 
NC TraCS Institute Director or d esignated representative. The Committee will consist of a chair, an ethicist, an 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_47561], a biostatistician, and one or more clinical researchers.  Committee members will serve for [ADDRESS_972395] and /or failure to act in accordance with the objectives of the DSMB.   A list of 
current DSMB members can be found in Appendix 1.   
 
PROCESS  
 
Eligibility  
A clinical trial is defined as “a prospective study involving human subjects designed to answer specific questions 
about the effects or impact of particular biomedical or behavior interventions; these may include drugs, 
treatments, devices, or behavior or nutritional strategies.”  Studies that include nutritional, behavioral, and 
psychosocial interventions are considered to be clinical trials.  Studies evaluating diagnostic s (imaging, etc.) in 
which findings alter the patient’s clinical care are also considered to be clinical trials.  Observational studies, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_29820], studies of diagnostics that do not effect patient care, and studies that do not test 
interventio ns are not considered to be clinical trials.  
 
DSMB Functions and Activities  
The DSMB is responsible for reviewing data from clinical trials approved by [CONTACT_713998].  
Investigators with commercially or governmentally sponsored trials will normall y work with their sponsor’s DSMB.  
The DSMB will review data from the following types of trials, when review is deemed necessary by [CONTACT_713999] (PI), in order to ensure the safety of participating subjects.  
 Phase I, I/II, II, and II/III trials when such review is deemed necessary by [CONTACT_714000].    
 Phase III clinical trials (single site trials where the PI [CONTACT_832] a UNC faculty member and for which UNC is the 
sponsor)  
 
Clinical Protocol: Sulforaphane for ASD  
- 61 - 
  Phase IV clinical trials (single site trials where the PI [CONTACT_832] a UNC faculty member and for which UNC is the 
sponsor)  
 Select multicenter clinical trials in which UNC is the coordinating center or the PI [INVESTIGATOR_713908] a UNC faculty 
membe r IF the DSMB determines that it has adequate resources to conduct the monitoring required of the 
study.  
 
The DSMB will meet at least every other month and has the following responsibilities.  
 Assessing risk and complexity of clinical trials submitted for review  
 Determining the appropriate level of data and safety monitoring  
 Reviewing serious adverse events (AEs) reports when requested.   
 Reviewing yearly data and safety monitoring reports when requested. Recommending appropriate actions 
(closure, increased  monitoring, etc.) to the Principal Investigator, UNC Biomedical IRB, and the Director or 
designated representative.  
 Communicating its finding with the Biomedical IRB  
 Preparing minutes for all meetings  
 Preparing an annual summary of activity for review by  [CONTACT_25513], NC TraCS Institute  
 Review of the monthly reports of the UNC Lineberger Oncology Protocol Review Committee (PRC) -Data and 
Safety Monitoring Subcommittee (DSMS)  
 Assessing ethical and scientific soundness of trials reviewed  
 
DSMB -Investigator Communications  
The DSMB will make available to investigators the following:  
 An Annual Data Reporting form for annual reporting of all AEs  
 A Data Safety Monitoring Plan template  
 
Principal Investigators shall make available to the DSMB the following information:  
 A copy of the approval letter from the UNC Biomedical Institutional Review Board  
 A Data Safety Monitoring Plan  
 All adverse event reports using the most current UNC Biomedical Institutional Review Board form  
 An annual summary of all AEs  
 
Relat ion to Biomedical Institutional Review Board and Lineberger Oncology Protocol Review Committee  
The DSMB will report its findings and make recommendations to the UNC Biomedical IRB.  For research 
conducted by [CONTACT_714001], the DSMB will repo rt its findings and make recommendations to the 
UNC Lineberger Oncology Protocol Review Committee (PRC).  Trials required to have an independent data and 
safety monitoring board as defined in this charter are expected to use the NC TraCS Institute DSMB ins tead of 
establishing their own independent board, unless outside expertise not available on the DSMB is necessary to 
adequately monitor the trial.   
 
Notice of a recommendation of early closure or suspension will be reported directly to the Biomedical IRB and the 
Director or designated representative.  As appropriate, such recommendations will be reported to the Director of 
the Lineberger Cancer Center and the Director of the Clinical Translational Research Center.  The Chair of the 
DSMB in conjunction with  the Chair of the Biomedical IRB is responsible for seeing that these trials are closed to 
accrual.  
 
Guidelines for Members  
In order for the DSMB to fulfill its responsibilities, the member will observe the following guidelines:  
 Members are free of apparen t conflicts of interest involving financial, scientific, or regulatory matters.  In case 
of any question of conflict of interest, standards used by [CONTACT_714002]  
 Members  should assess trial objectives and design in an unbiased way.  
 Members are guided both by [CONTACT_094] -specified study performance criteria, such as early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], and also 
by a masked and, if necessary, unmasked review of all data prior to making decisions  
 The DSMB members will review data and pertinent procedures in order to be confident that the data on which 
the decisions are based are accurate and complete  
 
Clinical Protocol: Sulforaphane for ASD  
- 62 - 
  All decisions of the DSMB shall be independent  
 
PROTOCOL REVIEW AND DATA MONITORING  
 
Monitoring and  Reporting Requirements  
In collaboration with the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_314421], the DSMB will set data monitoring and 
reporting requirements before study enrollment begins.  Members will review the interim analysis plan to ensure 
the an alyses planned will provide necessary information for DSMB decisions.  Members will participate in 
specification and review of all tables and specifications for data that they will review in accordance with timelines 
established by [CONTACT_714003].  
 
The DSMB will have face -to-face meeting(s) to review and discuss results of interim analysis.  The DSMB may 
also have face -to-face meeting(s) as prompted by [CONTACT_714004].  The DSMB staff or chair wi ll prepare minutes of each meeting within ten (10) working days of 
each meeting.  These minutes will be circulated and approved at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the 
DSMB.   
 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_713909].  If requested by [CONTACT_40746], the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_713910] o f all 
computer programs used to generate reports and analyses for each DSMB meeting.  The documents will be 
made part of the minutes of each meeting.  All formal reports will be circulated to the DSMB members no later 
than one week prior to each DSMB meeti ng. 
 
Data Review by [CONTACT_714005] a closed session.  The open session will provide a forum for 
exchange of information among DSMB members, Principal Investigator, and study biostatistician.  During the 
open session, the  Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_713911] a brief summary report of the study progress, including 
enrollment rates, data collection, and data quality.  There will be an opportunity for the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_713912].  
 
Only members of the DSMB will attend the closed session.  During this session, the DSMB will address issues 
regarding the following: 1) safety concerns, 2) efficacy concerns, 3) termination of the trial due to pre -specified 
stoppi [INVESTIGATOR_3418], and 4) ethical concerns.  The DSMB will be furnished with relevant information by [CONTACT_9532] [INVESTIGATOR_713913].  During this session the DSMB members may ask the Principal Investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_713914] (i.e., treatment A or treatment B without revealing what 
treatment A and B represent) or completely unmasked (i.e., identify treatment group).  
 
In addition to the open and closed sessions, the voting members of the DSMB may meet in an exec utive session 
at their discretion.  The DSMB will:  
 Review the protocol and any protocol amendments  
 Review the interim analysis monitoring plan, make recommendations, and give approval  
 Review interim analysis reports and meet as a group  
 Communicate recommen dations in writing to the Principal Investigator  
 
[INVESTIGATOR_713915] (such as safety, efficacy, ethics, and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]), the DSMB 
will take appropriate action.  This may involve a request for additional information, or a request for an early, 
unscheduled meeting of the DSMB with the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_314421].  At each meeting that 
includes review of interim data, the DSMB will recommend one of the following actions to the Principal 
Investigator, Biom edical IRB, and when appropriate the NC TraCS Institute Director or designated representative.  
 Continue the study according to the protocol  
 Modify the study protocol.  Modifications may include such items as changes in the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, nat ure and frequency of safety monitoring, study procedures, study drug/intervention dosing, consent 
form changes, subject re -notification, and any other changes deemed necessary  
 Discontinue one or more study arms  
 
Clinical Protocol: Sulforaphane for ASD  
- 63 - 
  Discontinue the study  
 
The DSMB may request a dditional data, analyses, or meetings to address specific concerns.  The DSMB may 
hold additional meetings without knowledge of the sponsor or Principal Investigator.  
 
Release of DSMB Recommendations  
The DSMB will refrain from revealing to the sponsor, Pri ncipal Investigator, or any other party information that 
would lead to compromising the integrity of the trial unless such a release is required to protect subject safety.  In 
particular, the following guidelines will be followed with respect to the dissem ination of the DSMB interim analysis 
results.  
 Individual patient treatment assignments will not be revealed  
 Individual center results will not be revealed  
 The magnitude of treatment differences in efficacy will not be revealed  
 Study results will not be communicated to investigators  
 The DSMB will not make any public disclosures of its discussions and decisions  
 The DSMB will complete a brief report documenting decisions and rationale behind its decisions.  The report 
will be conveyed confidentially to the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_38107], who in turn, will forward it to 
appropriate regulatory agencies.  A copy of the report will also be made available to the UNC Biomedical 
Institutional Review Board, in form that does not contain information that could co mpromise the integrity of the 
clinical trial.  
 When appropriate a copy of the report will also be made available to the Director of the Lineberger Cancer 
Center and/or the Director of the Clinical Translational Research Center.   
 All DSMB decisions will be deemed advisory to the Principal Investigator, UNC Biomedical Institutional 
Review Board, and the Director, NC TraCS Institute.

cardiovascular disease risk using biochemical indicators such as blood lipid profiles, most notably 
cholesterol; markers of inflammation as well as established physiological measurements suc h as 
Pulse wave velocity (PWV), Augmentation index (AIx) and Ambulatory Blood Pressure Measurements 
(ABPM). Broccoli contains compounds known as glucosinolates which are metabolised to 
isothiocyanates when consumed. The major glucosinolate in broccoli is k nown as glucoraphanin 
which produces the isothiocyanate  sulforaphane. The glucosinolates are thought to be the principal 
component in broccoli that may reduce CVD risk. The investigators will use a standard cultivar of 
broccoli and a cultivar that has enha nced levels of glucosinolates ('HG broccoli'). This broccoli has 
been used in previous intervention studies (e.g. ClinicalTrials.gov [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Volunteers will be 
asked to consume 400g of standard broccoli, HG broccoli or peas each week over a 12 week p eriod in 
a double blinded (for the broccoli) parallel study. The volunteers recruited will, according to the Joint

Duke University]. The overall purpose of this st udy is to obtain a better understanding of the 
biological response of red blood cells to sulforaphane contained in fresh  broccoli sprouts  that have 
been put through a blending process. This study will use commercially available fresh  broccoli 
sprouts  certi fied by [CONTACT_714013] (BroccoSprouts®). This product can also be 
purchased at some local grocery stores in the produce section. It is believed that NRF2, a 
transcription factor encoded by [CONTACT_714014]2L2 gene, plays a role in the regulation of defense against 
oxidative stress. The detrimental accelerated breakdown of sickle cell disease (SCD) red blood cells 
(SS RBC) is partially due to reduced anti -oxidative capacity. Previous analysis of SS RBC microRNAs 
revealed that a reduced level of NRF 2, the master regulator of anti -oxidative stress capacity, 
contributes to reduced resistance to oxidative stress and increased hemolysis; NRF2 also induces fetal 
hemoglobin (HbF), which is known to prevent SS RBC sickling.  
First, erythroid progenitors from  normal and SCD subjects will be tested ex -vivo to find out how 
sulforaphane, a natural NRF2 activator, affects the oxidative stress capacity, HbF expression, and 
microRNA expression of red cells.

recommendation. Importantly, intake of brightly colored fruits and vegetables is even lower when 
potatoes are not considered. I t is possible that improved fruit and vegetable intake will have 
beneficial health effects. For example, higher intakes of fruits and vegetables, and particularly 
cruciferous vegetables (e.g.,  broccoli , Brussels sprouts , cauliflower, etc.), are associated with lower 
rates of many degenerative diseases, including some cancers, yet this group of vegetables may 
continue to be under -consumed due to their strong flavors. A supplement made from these vegetables 
(Cruciferous CompleteTM made by [CONTACT_714016] . Palmyra, WI) contains a group of 
phytochemicals called glucosinolates that can shift estrogen metabolism in a favorable way. One 
proposed biomarker of chemoprotection from breast cancer is the urinary estrogen metabolite ratio 
of 2- to 16α -hydroxyestroge ns (2:16). In the main study, the effects of cruciferous vegetables 
(broccoli  or Brussels sprouts ), Cruciferous CompleteTM whole food supplements, or placebos on this 
ratio of urinary estrogen metabolites in healthy premenopausal women will be compared ove r an 
eight -week period. The investigators hypothesize that treatment with daily supplements will increase 
the 2:[ADDRESS_972403] cancer risk.  
In a sub -study, the relationships between serum α -carotene, β -carotene, β -cryptoxanthin, lutein and 
lycopene with dietary carotenoid intake as measured by a food frequency questionnaire and body 
composition will be evaluated in healthy premenopausal women . Carotenoids are a family of 
lipophilic compounds found primarily in colorful plant tissues and their concentration in human 
blood reflects dietary intake of carotenoid -rich foods. Carotenoid levels in the blood of healthy 
women do not appear to be influe nced by [CONTACT_714017], but are inversely associated with body 
fatness. Thus, serum carotenoid concentrations may serve as a functional marker for chronic disease 
risk associated with excess body fat.

and gEnotype Study (ENGAGE) . [R. Mithen, Institute of Food Research, Norwich,  Norfolk, United 
Kingdom]. The variation in extent of isothiocyanate (ITC) excretion in urine from a capsule delivered 
dose of glucoraphanin will c orrelate with differences in (a) the gut microbiota, and (b) the genotype 
of key polymorphic genes (GSTM1, GSTT1, and other as yet undetermined candidate genes).  
Our study is a human dietary intervention in which participants will consume one capsule conta ining 
100mg purified glucoraphanin from broccoli. The levels of glucoraphanin delivered by [CONTACT_714021]. As this is purified glucoraphanin there is no myrosinase 
enzyme present. All conversion of the glucorapha nin, contained within the capsule, to ITC will 
therefore occur by [CONTACT_714022].  
The ability of the glucoraphanin in the capsule to be metabolised to ITCs by [CONTACT_714023] d in the urine. The ITCs will be quantified in 
urine using validated analytical methods.  
It has been shown in human dietary intervention studies that the extent of conversion of 
glucosinolates varies greatly. In order to assess possible causative factors f or variation in rate of 
glucoraphanin metabolism each participant will provide a faecal sample from which their faecal gut 
microbiota phylogeny will be analysed.  
For a small number of participants a second faecal sample will be requested (a maximum of 3 
participants). It is our aim to select one low, one medium and one high ITC excreter. Ideally the low 
and high excreters would be within the lowest and highest 5% excretion of ITC and the third 
participant would be as close to the mean ITC excretion as possi ble. The aim would be to culture the 
faecal microbiota over time with repeat dosing of glucoraphanin in order to select for microbiota 
that are able to metabolise glucoraphanin. It is known that the main hydrolysis product of 
glucoraphanin,  sulforaphane , has a variety of benefits to human health, however there is no known 
clinical relevance to being a high, medium or low excreter of ITC.  
For each participant a blood sample will also be requested in order that we can assess whether 
genotype affects the rate of ITC excretion in urine. The GSTM1 genotype and other, as yet, 
unidentified candidate genes of each participant will be determined. Whether the genotype  
affects the rate of ITC excretion either alone or in combination with the phylogenetic profile will be 
assessed.

Mithen, Institute of Food Research, Norwich, Norfolk, [LOCATION_008]]. There is current evidence 
that sugges ts eating cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage is beneficial to our 
health as they contain compounds which are thought to reduce the risk of diseases such as cancer 
and cardiovascular diseases. Cruciferous vegetables are able to deliv er in our body a group of 
compounds called isothiocyanates (ITCs) that are thought to be responsible of their health -
promoting effects.  Sulforaphane (SF) from broccoli is one of the most studied ITCs and its anticancer 
properties have been extensively inves tigated in in vitro and in vivo models.  
The investigators propose to undertake an intervention study to measure the bioavailability of SF 
from the soups used in another intervention study called ESCAPE. The investigators would like to 
investigate the rate and extent to which SF reaches the systemic circulation and is excreted in urine

Mithen, Institute of Food Research, U.K.]. Prostate cancer is a major public health problem and 
there is a strong need of new preventive strategies based on drug and lifestyle interventions. It is now 
well -established that healthy eating patterns a nd increasing physical activity can prevent or delay 
prostate cancer progression. Intake of cruciferous vegetables (e.g.  broccoli,  cabbage, 
cauliflower,  Brussels sprouts,  kale) has been associated with decreased risk of prostate cancer 
progression; however  the underlying biological mechanisms remain unknown. The investigators 
propose to undertake a pi[INVESTIGATOR_302987] a group of men with early prostate cancer on active 
surveillance to determine whether a diet rich in  broccoli  will induce changes in tumor size an d blood

68Ga-DOTATATE PET for Localizati on of Phosphaturic Mesenchymal Tumors in Patients with 
Tumor Induced Osteomalacia  Protocol version number and date :  5;  10/12/2022 
 
Research Question and Aims 
 Hypothesis : 
68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT will help localize phosphatu ric mesenchymal tumors and thus aid in 
the diagnosis and treatment of tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO).  Aims, purpose, or objectives : This study aims to identify cases of  FGF23-mediated onc ogenic osteoomalacia 
in which the underlying phosphaturic mesenc hymal has not been found and perform 
68Ga-DOTATATE PET in 
these patients to localize the tumor.   Background :   
Tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome which pres ents as a clinical spectrum that 
can include hypophosphatemia, fractures, bone and muscular weakness. The osteomalacia is mediated by [CONTACT_828132] a hormone called FGF23 that causes renal pho sphate wasting.  In this syndrome FGF23 is usually 
secreted by [CONTACT_828133] (PMTs).  These tumors can occur anywhere from the head to 
toe, can arise in bone and soft tissue, and are usually sm all and slow growing.  As su ch, they are often difficult 
to localize. However, localization is cr itical, as surgical resection is curative in these patients.  Various imaging 
modalities including FDG-PET/CT, CT, and MRI; selective venous sampling of  FGF23 has also been used with 
variable success to localize these tumors. PMTs have b een shown to variably expres s 5 somatostatin receptors 
(SSTR 1-5), and this has also allowed utilization of SSTR based functional imaging by [CONTACT_828134] 
(Gonciulea and Jan De Beur, Endocr inol Metab Clin North Am 2017 ) and more recently, 68Ga-DOTATATE 
PET/CT. 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT is a novel ima ging modality which is currentl y not very widely available, 
but early reports indicate th at this may be superior to all other avai lable imaging modalities at PMT localization. 
A recent multicenter case series re ported 6 patients in which this imaging modality was used for PMT 
localization (Clifton-Bligh et al., J Cl in Endocrinol Metab 2013 ).

Study Design and Methods 
 
Methods:    
This will be a prospective cohort study.   We have searched the Mayo Clinic – Roch ester medical records between January [ADDRESS_1149102] “FGF 23 osteomalacia”, “oncogenic osteomalacia”, “tumor  induced osteomalacia”, 
or “hypophosphatemic osteomalacia” (under RPR-6054-18). Fr om this list, we have excluded patients who 
were diagnosed to have hypophosphatemic rickets or t hose in whom the underlying tumor has already been 
identified. After January 30th, 2018, patients evaluated for TIO at Mayo Clin ic without a localized tumor will be 
reviewed quarterly thro ugh the same search strategy and inclusion/ex clusion criteria noted in this document.  
 Subjects in whom a tumor was not localized will be recruited prospectively to undergo imaging by 
68Ga-
DOTATATE PET/CT. These subjec ts will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] (phone script at tached) to inform them of the study and 
the imaging modality. The first 22  patient s that agree to participate in the study will be asked to present to the 
Clinic where they can provide a writte n consent and perform  the imaging study. 
 Enrolled subjects will be evaluated in th e clinical practice prior to having 
68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT imaging 
performed. The treating endocrinologist will be informed of the imaging results and w ill review the results with 
the subject using a follow- up visit or phone call; when a tumor is localized, he/she will discuss appropriate 
management options. These visits/conversations will be standard of care and not part of the research protocol.  Medical records will be accessed for up to one year follow ing the date of the PET/CT scan to obtain subject-
specific clinical, laboratory and radiographic data. If the subject is to  undergo an intervention related to the 
localized tumor, the pathology report will also be accessed during this time-frame to collect pathology data.   Information retrieved from patient’s medical records will be kept confidential. Unless  required by [CONTACT_2371], only the 
investigators as well as the instituti onal review board (IRB) will have direct access to subject information. 
Collected personal information, research data, and related records will be c oded, and this code will be used on 
all documents to prevent subject identification. Each pa tient will be assigned a unique code. One document only 
will relate patient identifiers to the unique codes. The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_828130]-protected, 
and that both the document and the password are kept in a secure, private hard-drive . This document will be 
destroyed at the end of the research study. Subjects will not be identifi ed in any publications or presentations 
that result from this study. Data will be entered into  a separate database which will not contain any patient 
identifiers.   Resources:  Describe the available resources to conduct the research (personnel, time, facilities, mentor 
commitment, etc.) :  
 This study will be performed by [CONTACT_941] a bove listed investigators. All aspects of the study including data 
collection, analysis and preparing the abstract and manuscript will be done at Mayo Clinic [COMPANY_002]ster. The PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_828131]. We plan to conduct this study over a period of 2 years startin g from the time of IRB approval.

osteomalacia (FGF23 mediated os teomalacia caused by [CONTACT_20150]).  
 Inclusion Criteria: Adults (18 years of age or olde r) seen at Mayo Clinic, Roch ester for FGF23 mediated 
osteomalacia who provide informed c onsent to participate in the study. 
 Exclusion Criteria:   
1. Pregnant 
2. Prisoners 
3. Subjects diagnosed with heritable hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia 
4. Subjects who do not consent for the study or wit hdraw consent during the duration of the study.  
5. Subjects in whom tumor loca lization and successful resec tion has already occurred. 
 At the discretion of the investigat or, it may be appropriate for a subj ect to undergo an additional DOTATATE 
PET/CT examination if the phosphatu ric mesenchymal tumor is not loca lized or if there are recurrent 
biochemical abnormalities.  The max imum number of PET/CTs a patient can undergo as part of this study is 
two.  The patient must still meet the cr iteria for enrollment in the study.  The subject will receive a new subject 
ID and the subject will be reconsented.

 HIPAA Identifiers and Protected  Health Information (PHI) 
 
Protected health information is medical  data that can be linked to the subject directly or through a combination 
of indirect identifiers.   Recording identifiers (including a c ode) during the conduct of the study allo ws you to return to the medical 
record or data source to delete duplic ate subjects, check a missing or quest ionable entry, add new data points, 
etc. De-identified data is me dical information that has been stripped of all HIPAA identifiers so  that it cannot be 
linked back to the subject. De-identified data is rarely  used in the conduct of a research study involving a chart 
review.    Review the list of subject identifiers below and, if a pplicable, check the box next to each HIPAA identifier 
being recorded at the time of data collection or abstraction.  Identifiers apply to an y subject enrolled in the 
study including Mayo Clinic staff, patients a nd their relatives and household members.  
 Internal  refers to the subject’s identi fier that will be recorded at  Mayo Clinic by [CONTACT_5984]. 
External  refers to the subject’s identifier that  will be shared outside of Mayo Clinic.

SPECIFIC AIMS:  
We propose to perform a randomized controlled trial (RCT) assessing calcium chloride (CaCl 2) as 
a novel intervention  to prevent hemorrhage from uterine atony  with nested PK/PD analysis.  
PPH is the leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide1,2. Concerningly, the incidence 
of PPH has  been rising3. Uterine atony, defined as failure of the uterus to adequately contract after placental 
delivery, causes approximately  80% of PPH2. Current medications  used to prevent or treat  uterine atony are 
limited by [CONTACT_10322] , adverse side effect s, expense,  and contraindications to use2. As such, there  is a critical 
need for effective , safe,  and inexpensive pharmacologic measures for uterine atony.  
Intravenous CaCl 2 is an inexpensive, shelf -stable drug with good biologic and epi[INVESTIGATOR_10293]/or prevent  uterine atony. Calcium is already frequently utilized in obstetric anesthesia for indications 
such as hypocalcemia from massive transfusion and overcoming magnesium toxicity. Multiple in vitro  studies 
have demonstrated that adequate extracellular calcium levels are necessary for forceful myometrial  contraction 
in response to oxytocin5-7. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_10294] a dose -response fashion8.  
We recently conducted a 40- patient placebo -controlled, double- blind pi[INVESTIGATOR_10295] a one -gram 
dose of intravenous CaCl [ADDRESS_9593] efficacy in prevention of uterine atony in women who received calcium as compared to placebo 
infusion ( p=0.07,  relative risk 0.38, 95% CI 0.15- 1.07, number needed to treat 3.3).  
Pharmaceutical development  and pharmacokinetic characterization in pregnancy has become a National 
Institute of Health priority9. The NICHD has established an Obstetric and Pediatric Pharmacology and 
Therapeutics Branch dedicated to advancing knowledge of drug PK/PD in pregnancy and childhood given critical 
knowledge gaps in these areas9. We will collect and analyze PK/PD for intravenous CaCl 2 within our trial. Building 
upon the  promising  results  from our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we aim to:  
AIM 1: E stablish  the effect of a CaCl 2 infusion on blood loss and uterine tone during cesarean 
delivery i n parturients at heightened risk for uterine atony in a double- blind , randomized, placebo-
controlled trial. We hypothesize that , as suggested by [CONTACT_10323][INVESTIGATOR_799],  CaCl 2 infusion will reduce quantitative 
blood loss ( QBL, primary outcome) and improve a numerical rating score for uterine tone (NRS UT, secondary 
outcome) compared to placebo without significant safety or tolerability concerns.  
AIM 2 : Measure PK /PD of intravenous CaCl 2 in pregnant patients. Establishing the PK of intravenous 
CaCl 2 in parturients is of great relevance whether  or not CaCl 2 is shown to be effective in preventing atony in Aim 
1, given  the multiple indications for calcium administration in obstetric patients . We will generate a PK/PD model 
for calcium in pregnancy that includes estimates of covariate effects and intra- and interindividual variability using 
non-linear mixed effects modeling.  Meanwhile, PD modeling of calcium effect upon uterine tone will allow us to 
quantify calcium’s effect on myometrial function.  
Significance:  I f CaCl 2, an inexpensive, widely  available drug, has efficacy in the prevention or treatment 
of uterine atony, it has the potential to change the maternal standard of care and decrease the leading cause of 
maternal morbidity and mortality.  We will leverage t he intervention tested in the RCT, the infusion of CaCl 2, to 
define the PK/PD  of calcium in pregnant women at term. This has potential relevance in defining approaches for 
administering calcium in various  obstetrical  context s and will facilitate dose optimization .

BACKROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
Uterine atony and postpartum hemorrhage: PPH,  defined by [CONTACT_10324] a cumulative blood loss of >1000mL within [ADDRESS_9594] 
after placental delivery, causes about 80% of PPH.[ADDRESS_9595] up to $1000 per dose, is contraindicated in women with asthma and requires 
refrigeration, significantly limiting its utility in poor resourced settings. Misoprostol causes fever and rigors and 
its efficacy for treating uterine atony has been called into question.
2 As such, additional prevention or treatment 
modalities for uterine atony--especially inexpensive, shelf -stable, and well -tolerated drugs —are essential.  
 
Calcium: Intravenous CaCl 2 is an inexpensive, widely -available,  shelf -stable  drug which is familiar to  
anesthesiologists in a variety of contexts. On obstetric units, calcium is utilized for indications including 
hypocalcemia from rapid transfusion of citrate -containing blood products and overcoming magnesium toxicity.  
 
Biological plausibility: calcium and uterine contractility : In vitro studies have established calcium’s important 
physiological role in uterine contractility. Uterine myometrial contractility is dependent upon an influx of calcium from intracellular stores in the sarcoplasmic reticulum as well as extracellular calcium.
5-7 Myometrial contraction 
amplitude diminishes in the setting of low extracellular calcium.5-7 Oxytocin’s efficacy in inducing myometrial 
contraction diminishes by 60- 75% in the setting of low or absent extracellular calcium levels in in vitro  studies 
with human uterine strips.7  
 
Clinical and epi[INVESTIGATOR_10296]: serum calcium levels  impact  myometrial function : In a large 
retrospective cohort study, low ionized calcium levels predicted severity of PPH in a dose -response relationship, 
with an odds ratio of 1.97 for each 0.1mmoL/L decrease in ionized calcium level8. A prospective observational 
study also linked serum calcium levels with spontaneous labor onset, finding higher serum calcium in laboring 
than matched non -laboring patients at the same gestational age10. Finally, calcium channel blockers are regularly 
utilized to prevent uterine contractility in the setting of preterm labor11.  
 
In one prior small RCT, Farber and colleagues examined the effect of low dose CaCl 2 administered during 
scheduled cesarean delivery in 60 patients upon hemodynamics (primary outcome). No differences in 
development of uterine atony (secondary outcome) were noted among the study groups who received 0, 200mg, 
or 400mg of CaCl 2; however, there were only [ADDRESS_9596] to this outcome11.  
 
Maternal hemorrhage and pharmacokinetic drug studies and maternal hemorrhage are National 
Institutes of Health (NIH) priorities: The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD ) 
specifically calls for investigations dedicated to “improv[ing] the prevention of and response to labor and delivery complications that lead to maternal morbidity and mortality and extend[ing] studies of key adverse events to the 
postpartum period (“the fourth trimester”) to include hemorrhage”
9. In addition, pregnant women are historically 
excluded from drug trials, and despi[INVESTIGATOR_10297], increased glomerular filtration rate, and bidirectional changes in hepatic enzyme function, PK/PD drug studies 
in this population are often lacking
13. The NICHD 2020 strategic plan includes themes centered upon funding 
PK/PD  studies in pregnant women and children and improving pregnancy outcomes9. The proposed work for 
this FAER award meets both of these NICHD strategic goals  by [CONTACT_10325]/PD.  
 
 
 
[ADDRESS_9597] oxytocin during cesarean delivery in parturients with heightened risk of uterine atony . In 
the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we demonstrated feasibility by [CONTACT_10326] 40 patients in a one- year timeframe 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a lack of dedicated funding or  research staff. The drug infusion was well -tolerated, with no  adverse 
hemodynamic consequences . An equal number of patients in the calcium and placebo groups reported 
possible drug side effects including flushing, nausea, or vomiting (30% in each arm ). Obtaining and measuring 
venous blood specimens for PK a nalysis also proved feasible.  
 
Although inferring intervention efficacy is not the aim of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251] , there were several trends noted within our 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_10298] 2 warrants  a larger, definitive study as a potential intervention for uterine atony 
(Table 1 ).  Only 20% of patients who received calcium had uterine atony, pre -defined as requirement for a 
second line uterotonic agent, placement of an intrauterine balloon for tamponade, or hemorrhage with blood loss 
>1000mL, compared to 50% of patients who received the saline placebo infusion (relative risk 0.38, P=0.07, 
95% CI 0.15 -1.07, NNT 3.3). Blood loss, uterine tone score, total oxytocin dose, and intraoperative fluid 
requirements all showed similar promising trends ( Table 1 ).  
 
As part of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_4265], we also gathered serial serum venous blood samples from a subset of  participants. 
This was done for two  main purposes: 1) 
to ensure a reliable but safe rise in ionized calcium from the 1- gram dose of CaCl
2, and 2) to generate  sample 
size calculations for a definitive study of CaCl 2 PK in a similar pregnant patient cohort.  Data  and a 1-compartment 
PK model  are shown in Figure  1. As anticipated, a rapid and reliable and safe- level peak in ionized calcium was 
obtained in subjects who received CaCl 2.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND METHODS  
SPECIFIC AIM 1 OVERVIEW : Based on our preliminary data, we propose a double- blind, placebo- controlled,  
120-patient RCT to assess the effect of prophylactic CaCl [ADDRESS_9598] of care oxytocin after fetal delivery. We will 
assess q uantitative blood loss and serial measurements of uterine tone.  
 
Study population: The study will enroll adult pregnant patients age 18 -45 years of age at >[ADDRESS_9599] received an exogenous oxytocin infusion for labor induction 
or augmentation, as these are known risk factors for uterine atony1,2. Exclusions include emergent surgery, 
known cardiac dysfunction,  renal dysfunction with serum Cr >1.0, hypertension necessitating intravenous 
hydralazine or labetalol during labor, and treatment with calcium channel blockers or digoxin.  
 
Subject enrollment: All laboring patients on the unit receive a brief informational handout about this study upon 
admission ( Appendix 1 ). Research staff visit all laboring patients twice daily  after permission to approach and 
introduction by [CONTACT_10327], once in the morning and once in the afternoon, to obtain informed consent 
from all willing laboring patients  if they require cesarean delivery.  Consent and study inclusions/exclusions are 
confirmed by [CONTACT_10328].  
 
Subject exposures:  Sequential subject study ID numbers  will be randomized in 1:[ADDRESS_9600] ID  # and “study drug”. The patient, anesthesiologist, obstetricians, and research staff will remain blinded 
to assignment. All study subjects will receive standard care with prophylactic oxytocin bolus and infusion, as well as second -line uterotonics on an as -needed basis per institutional protocol . (Appendix  2)  
• Ca
lcium:  1 gram CaCl 2 in total volume 60mL delivered over 10 minutes beginning 2 minutes after fetal delivery.  
• Placebo: 60mL sterile saline delivered over 10 minutes  beginning 2 minutes after fetal delivery  
 
Outcomes and Measurement : The primary outcome will be quantitative blood loss ( QBL) in mL, which is 
calculated by [CONTACT_10329] ( suction cannister contents after subtracting 
amnioti c fluid volume ) and gravimetric (weighing soiled surgical sponges, drapes, and pads ) assessment . 
Secondary outcomes will include the following: uterine tone assessments by [CONTACT_10330] a validated 10- point numerical rating scale
14 (NRS UT) at study drug initiation 2 minutes after fetal delivery  and 
reassessed every 5 minutes thereafter until fascial closure. Additionally, total oxytocin bolus and infusion doses, second line uterotonics, change in hematocrit from preoperative to postoperative day one values, total 
intravenous fluids, and a composite outcome indicating hemorrhage morbidity including transfusion during the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], hysterectomy, uterine artery embolization, intensive care admission, and death will be recorded.  
Please see Appendix 3 for forms to be filled out by [CONTACT_3647].   
 
Data Analysis:  Analyses will be conducted using R and supervised by a biostatistical consultant from the 
Stanford Quantitative Sciences unit. Continuous data will be represented using mean (± SD) or median 
(interquartile range) for variables not normally distributed and compared using parametric or non- parametric t-
tests as appropriate.  Categorical data will be presented using proportions and compared using a chi- square (or 
Fishers Exact) test. Two- sided p- values less than 0.05 will be considered statistic ally significant. 
 
Analysis of Primary Aim : The primary outcome of the study is the difference in quantitative blood loss between 
the two groups on an intention- to-treat basis. Patients who are found to have non- atonic reasons for blood loss 
including morbidly adherent placenta, hysterotomy extension, cervical, or vaginal lacerations will be included in 
primary outcome assessment. The trial is also powered for  planned subgroup analysis  excluding these cases . 
In addition, subgroup analyses based upon risk factors for atony including chorioamnionitis, total oxytocin exposure, indication for cesarean, magnesium infusion, and preeclampsia will be performed.  
 
6 
 
Sample size: Power analysis of the data from our pi[INVESTIGATOR_10300] a sample size of [ADDRESS_9601] 90% power to detect a difference of 200mL in quantitative blood loss between groups at the p<0.05 
significance level. The  sample size was increased to 60 patients per arm to allow sufficient power for the planned 
subgroup analysis excluding patients with non -atonic etiologies of blood loss  which may occur in up to 40% of 
cases . This same sample size will also generate 86% power to detect a rank test difference of [ADDRESS_9602] care.  
 
Patient safety: All potential side effects of calcium will be recorded as part of this study, including flushing, arm 
discomfort, nausea, vomiting, bradycardia, tachycardia, arrhythmia, and hypertension. A  single dose of dilute 
CaCl 2, infused slowly through an intravenous (IV) line in the sensate upper extremity of  an un -sedated patient, 
is unlikely to cause severe adverse effects. The major concern with CaCl [ADDRESS_9603] of data safety monitoring has been created for this trial. Any potential adverse events including patient hemodynamic compromise or concern for drug extravasation will be reviewed immediately ad hoc, and 
they will determine whether unblinding is required and when the study may resu me.  
 
Management of hypercalcemia:  Acute hypercalcemia may manifest as altered mental status, bradycardia, or 
hypotension. We do not anticipate clinical hypercalcemia given the patient population (young, healthy, renal 
dysfunction and digoxin use are contraindications), the dilute and slow  infusion, the single dose of calcium, and 
the excellent patient tolerance and peak ionized calcium levels obtained during our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. However, 
management of acute hypercalcemia would include immediately pausing the infusion if still running, 
administering a fluid bolus of 500mL to 1000mL isotonic fluid, and obtaining a serum calcium level at the 
discretion of the clinical anesthesia team. If necessary, the team could consider additional administration of 10 -
20mg intravenous  furosemide to lower serum calcium further if needed.  
 
Feasibility: Stanford Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10301] 4600-[ADDRESS_9604] the support and collaboration of an excellent obstetric division.  There are no concurrent competing studies in this study cohort.   
 
Potential difficulties : Given our successful pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], we believe this study will proceed smoothly but are ready for 
unanticipated problems.  We have received support from obstetricians , the quantitative sciences unit (statistics), 
and labor and delivery nursing for the study.  The greatest source of potential difficulties involves enrollment of 
[ADDRESS_9605] obtained a letter of commitment from 
a second site at Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10302] . 
 
Weaknesses: The primary outcome (QBL) and secondary outcome of NRS UT are surrogate outcomes for clinical 
endpoints of major morbidity or mortality  but allow for a more reasonable study sample size for a single center.   
  
7 
 
 
]SPECIFIC AIM 2 OVERVIE W: Serial venous blood sampling for ionized calcium level in willing study participants 
will allow us to also establish the PK/PD  of CaCl [ADDRESS_9606] of serum ionized calcium level upon uterine contractility . 
 
Venous blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis: 0.5 mL venous blood will be collected at up to 6 
timepoints for willing study participants  at each of the following time intervals  relative to study drug infusion : 
baseline (prior to fetal delivery) , 0-5 minutes, 5 -10 minutes, 10- 30 minutes, 30- 60 minutes, and 60 -240 minutes.  
Ionized calcium level and pH of blood specimens will immediately be analyzed using an iSTAT machine with a 
EG7+  cartridge (Abbott  Core Laboratory Systems, Lake Forest, IL) in an adjacent operating room by [CONTACT_10331]. Venous blood pH  and ionized 
calcium values will be recorded directly into the secure research database but not  entered into the patient’s 
medical record as this would compromise blinding. Blood specimens will not be stored.  
 
As a second peripheral IV is frequently placed in the opposite arm from the primary peripheral IV for patients 
undergoing intrapartum cesarean delivery as part of standard care in case of hemorrhage, this IV will be used 
for blood collection whenever possible. If not possible to draw blood or this IV is not placed, the patient will be asked for permission to obtain blood specimens using a 22g winged blood collection needle. If possible, these 
specimens will be collected from the lower extremity (saphenous vein or foot), as these veins are dilated and 
insensate in patients undergoing cesarean delivery under neuraxial anesthesia. Sterile technique will be utilized 
for all blood collections.  
 
 
Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis: We will assess the data with graphical validation to assure 
data validity. General analyses will be conducted with R statistical programming language (R Foundation for 
Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). PK  and PD models will be characterized using nonlinear mixed effects 
modeling with the program NONMEM 7.416. 
 
We anticipate  a two -compartment mammillary model with an effect site. Calcium is administered into the central 
compartment, also the site of drug sampling. Calcium is also eliminated from the plasma compartment. Calcium 
may distribute from the plasma compartment to one or more compartments. Drug effect is mediated by [CONTACT_10332] a hypothetical “effect site”, in this case the uterus
17. The effect site permits modeling of 
hysteresis between the time course of plasma calcium concentration increase and increase in uterine tone 
measured in Aim 1. PK  modeling will be done  in the volume and clearance domain  and include the influence (if 
any) of age, weight, gestational age, pH, starting heamtocrit, and blood loss . 
 
Equation [ADDRESS_9607] is the NRS UT is an ordinal measure, it will be 
dichotomized into 4 categories, 0- 3, 4-10, 7 -10, and 9- 10, and 
modeled as the probability of being in each category as shown in Figure  2. PD   models will be estimate p0, 
pMAX, Ce 50, and  γ (the baseline probability of uterine tone X, the 
maximum probability of  uterine tone X, the concentration associated 
with 50% of the change in probability, and the steepness of the concentration versus probability  relationship) . The effect of pH and uterotonics including oxytocin, 
methylergonovine, and carboprost on the PD  parameters will be explored.  
 Equation 1: Pharmacodynamic model for the 
probability of uterine NRS and calcium concentration  

[ADDRESS_9608] random effects (e.g., subject to subject differences) on model parameters will be estimated  and 
applied using additive, proportional, and exponential models as appropriate. Residual intrasubject variability 
(e.g., noise) will typi[INVESTIGATOR_10303]. The influence of covariates effects 
(e.g., age, weight, gestational age, pH, uterotonics including oxytocin, methylergonovine, and carboprost) on 
model parameters will be analyzed by [CONTACT_10333]/exclusion with significance determined by [CONTACT_10334] . Covariates on the PK and PD parameters deemed significant by [CONTACT_10335] -validation as described by [CONTACT_10336]17 and only included in the final model if validated.  
  
 
Table 2 shows the results of 1000 bootstrap replications of  data from the original 24 individuals in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_10304], resampled with N=60 (half of the proposed study population), and N=120 (the entire proposed study population)
18. As expected, the estimates are more precise with increasing study size. As seen in the table, the 
parameters estimated for the initial 24 subjects had considerable uncertainty for clearance and the volume of distribution. If the study gathers PK samples in half of the patients (N=60), V
1 will be estimated with in less than 
a 40% range (Table 2, numbers in red). This should be sufficient to predict the dose of calcium required to reach 
a target calcium concentration in parturients . Our study  will have greater power than predicted by [CONTACT_10337] 5 -6 samples per patient rather than the 2- 3 samples obtained in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] .

confidence intervals are shown for each parameter.

Rigor and Transparency: Prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed study is rigorous  as 
there is basic science and epi[INVESTIGATOR_10306]. Sample size and statistical power for 
both aims of this research proposal build upon our own pi[INVESTIGATOR_10307]. Weaknesses of the only prior 
clinical trial to investigate  calcium’s relationship to uterine atony included low calcium dose, small sample size, 
and a study population with a very low baseline incidence of uterine atony12. We have addressed all of these 
weaknesses with our clinical trial design by [CONTACT_2329] a higher dose of calcium that we have shown in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_10308] a measurable peak in ionized calcium levels shortly after infusion, a larger sample size based on 
rigorous estimation techniques, and a study population with very high baseline incidence of uterine atony. Our 
blinding and randomization should ensure a robust and unbiased approach. Finally, t he proposed study takes 
into account sex as a biological variable by [CONTACT_10338] a condition unique to pregnant women. It also promises to 
bridge gaps in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies in pregnant women.  
 
Implications: If CaCl [ADDRESS_9609] the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in pregnant women.  
 
Future Directions:  The likely next step  will include obtaining NIH funding to execute  a large r, multicenter RCT  
with expanded inclusion criteria.

Stanford OB Anesthesia Study Information Sheet for Patients  
Trial Investigating Calcium to Prevent Bleeding during Cesarean  
 
This information sheet is provided to laboring patients to provide some information in case you might 
later qualify for one of our studies. At some point, an anesthesiologist or research assistant might 
approach you about this study.  They would at that point go through a much more detailed 
explanation and consent with your permission.  However, you are welcome to ask questions any time!  
What is the study?  In this study, Stanford OB Anesthesiologists are investigating whether giving 
some extra calcium  through a patient’s IV after the baby [CONTACT_10339] a cesarean can help the 
uterus to contract and prevent blood loss.    
I am in labor, not having a Cesarean. Why am I receiving this information? Until babies are born, 
we never know for sure that cesarean delivery will not be required.  In this study, we are particularly trying to enroll patients who require cesarean delivery after laboring, as these patients have a higher 
risk of blood loss from poor uterine contraction after delivery. 
 
How would this study change my care? If you were to qualify and consent for this study, you would 
receive all of the same medications and doses that any other patient receives.  If you took part in this 
study, after your baby [CONTACT_10340], an anesthesiologist would ALSO give a dose of extra calcium or 
some plain saline (known as a placebo) through your IV.  Your anesthesiologist and you would not know whether you received calcium or the saline placebo. With your permission, the anesthesiologist 
may also collect several small blood samples from your IV during your cesarean to measure your 
calcium levels. You would still be welcome to participate without giving blood samples. 
 
Why calcium?  Why is this being studied?  Calcium is present in all of our bodies and is essential for 
normal functions like blood clotting, heart, bone, and muscle function.  Research shows that it is 
possible that extra calcium may also help the uterus muscle contract, which is important to help prevent bleeding after delivery.  We are investigating whether women who require Cesarean have less blood 
loss and better uterine contraction after delivery if they receive some extra calcium. This study will 
help us to answer that important question.

Appendix 2: Stanford Labor and Delivery protocol for intrapartum cesarean delivery  
 
Monitoring: All patients undergoing intrapartum cesarean delivery are monitored by [CONTACT_10341], 3- lead 
EKG, and noninvasive blood pressure oscillometry. Blood pressures are obtained every 1 minutes prior to fetal delivery. 
For clinically stable patients  at the discretion of the anesthesia team, blood pressure frequency may be decreased to 
every 2.5- 5 minutes after fetal delivery.  
 
Antibiotics: 
• Patients without antibiotic allergy or chorioamnionitis receive 2 grams intravenous cefazolin (3 grams if >120 kg) 
prior to incision and 500 mg of intravenous azithromycin over a one- hour infusion for endometritis prophylaxis.  
• Patients with a clinical diagnosis of chorioamnionitis instead receive intravenous ampi[INVESTIGATOR_10312] 2g, gentamycin 5 mg/kg over a one- hour infusion, and clindamycin 900 mg intravenously  
 
Neuraxial anesthesia:  
• Patients with a labor epi[INVESTIGATOR_10313]- up with divided doses of 2% lidocaine with epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 
1:200,000 to achieve a T4 dermatomal level to pi[INVESTIGATOR_10314] (generally 15- 25 mL total volume). [ADDRESS_9612]. All patients receive 3 mg epi[INVESTIGATOR_10315].  
• Patients without a labor epi[INVESTIGATOR_10316] a single- shot spi[INVESTIGATOR_10317]- epi[INVESTIGATOR_10318], with a 
standard intrathecal medication cocktail of 1.6 mL 0.75% hyperbaric bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], 15 mcg fentanyl, and 100 mcg 
morphine.  
 Uterine tone assessment and uterotonic medications: 
• At the time of fetal delivery, 2 units of intravenous oxytocin are administered, and an oxytocin infusion is initiated 
at 7.5 units/hr  
• 2 minutes after fetal delivery, the uterine tone is assessed by [CONTACT_10342] a scale 
from 0- 10, with 0 representing a completely atonic uterus and 10 representing a firm and completely contracted 
uterus. This score is recorded. For uterine tone score <8/10, an additional 2 units oxytocin are administered, and 
oxytocin infusion increases to 15 units per hour  
• 7 minutes after fetal delivery, uterine tone is again assessed by [CONTACT_10343]. For scores <8/10, 
oxytocin [ADDRESS_9613] time, oxytocin infusion increases to 30 units/hr, and the anesthesia and 
obstetric teams discuss whether a second line uterotonic may be warranted. If so, the anesthesia team begins preparation of the second line uterotonic agent. This agent is administered if uterine tone is still deemed inadequate at the discretion of the anesthesia and obstetric teams.  
• 12 minutes after delivery, uterine tone is again assessed by [CONTACT_10343]. For scores <8/10, the 
obstetric and anesthesia teams will discuss whether a second line uterotonic may be clinically indicated.  
• The uterotonic protocol outlined can be changed based on clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_10320].  
 Quantitative blood loss:  
Quantitative blood loss (QBL) is measured for all cesarean deliveries by a standardized protocol. The protocol follows 
nationally recommended methodology that combines gravimetric (measurement of suction cannister contents after subtraction of the amniotic  fluid volume) and volumetric (weighing all surgical sponge and drape and subtracting dry 
weights) QBL.
1,2 This process is performed by [CONTACT_10344], all of whom receive standardized 
training in performing the technique.

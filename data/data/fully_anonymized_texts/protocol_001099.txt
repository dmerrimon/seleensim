 Page 5 of 39   3.0 Background 
3.1 Provide the scientific or scholarly background, rationale, and significance 
of the research based on the existing literature and how it will contribute to 
existing knowledge.  Describe any gaps in current knowledge.  Include 
relevant preliminary findings or prior research by [CONTACT_093].  
Response: Mindfulness is a practice of “careful attention to mental and physical 
processes.” ("Glossary of Buddhist Terms," 2018)   Mindfulness is a component of 
various types of spi[INVESTIGATOR_447620], specifically, from 
Buddhist tradition.  While there are many types of meditative activities, Western 
medicine has begun to focus on practices most closely related to Vipassana 
Meditation, also known as, Insight Meditation.  Mindfulness can be considered a 
component of meditation practices, but can also be practiced and incorporated in 
to an individual’s daily activity. 
While meditation has long been a practice in several Eastern religions and 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_127035], it most notably came to Europe and North America in the early 
1960s.  By 1976, the Insight Meditation Society, one of the first retreat centers in 
the [LOCATION_002], was founded by [CONTACT_447633], Sharon Salzburg, and Jack 
Kornfield ("Celebrating 40 Years (1976-2016)," 2018) .  From this, developed the 
medical research around mindfulness of Jon Kabat-Zinn, Founder of the UMass 
Medical School Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) Program ("History 
of MBSR," 2017) . 
Mindfulness practice has gained popularity as a first line medical intervention for 
three main reasons.  Mindfulness practice is non-invasive, non-pharmacologic, 
and has no significant side effects (Cebolla, Demarzo, Martins, Soler, & Garcia-
Campayo, 2017) .  Since it is non-invasive, mindfulness on its own is rarely 
harmful, however, if used in the place of proven interventions can be dangerous.  
Those utilizing mindfulness practices and meditation must still be under the care 
of appropriate medical professionals.  As a non-pharmacologic intervention, it can 
be cost effective and not financially prohibitive or burdensome for patients.  
While the quality of instruction and subsequent practice should be further 
investigated, the practice itself has the potential to be available at little cost.  
Much like exercise, meditation and mindfulness practice can be subject to failure 
if a patient is not compliant to the regimen.  Since there is still much to know 
about the impacts of the types and qualities of meditation on an individual level, 
its potential benefits can greatly outweigh any risks. 
For the purposes of this study meditation and meditative activities will not be 
limited only to mindfulness, which can be one aspect of meditation.  Meditation 
can be categorized into three areas.  Focused attention (FA) or concentration 
meditation is a practice in which the practitioner focuses their attention on a 
singular idea or object (Rinpoche, 1980) as in breath awareness, metta or loving-
kindness meditation, or a repeated word or phrase as in transcendental 
meditation(Rinpoche, 1980).  This has typi[INVESTIGATOR_447621] a starting point for most 
novice practitioners.  Open-monitoring (OM) includes mindfulness practice, in 
which the practitioner seeks to become aware of physical and emotional states, Formatted:  Font: [ADDRESS_569277] two practices rarely are exclusive of each other, but 
rather, a practitioner’s session may include FA and OM. 
Previous study of meditation has demonstrated activations and changes in specific 
regions of the brain.  Findings from Manna et al., indicate  
that expert meditators control cognitive engagement in conscious 
processing of sensory-related, thought and emotion contents, by [CONTACT_447634]-regulation of fronto-parietal and insular areas in the left hemisphere, 
in a meditation state-dependent fashion.  We also found that anterior 
cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices play antagonist roles in the 
executive control of the attention setting in meditation tasks. …  Finally, 
our study suggests that a functional reorganization of brain activity 
patterns for focused attention and cognitive monitoring takes place with 
mental practice, and that meditation-related neuroplasticity is crucially 
associated to a functional reorganization of activity patterns in prefrontal 
cortex and in the insula. (2010) 
Others have confirmed through the use of fMRI that meditative methods of 
MBSR, Mindfulness Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (MCBT), and dispositional 
mindfulness – the present moment awareness in daily life – change functional and 
structural components of the prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, insula, 
hippocampus, and amygdala after an eight-week program. These findings indicate 
emotional and behavioral changes being related to those functional and structural 
changes (Gotink, Meijboom, Vernooij, Smits, & Hunink, 2016) .  These changes 
were found to be similar to those noted in experienced meditators.  
Others found changes in functional connectivity in the medial prefrontal cortex, 
right thalamus/parahippocampal gyrus, and bilateral anterior insula/putamen 
during meditation.  These findings were associated with top-down cognitive, 
emotion, and attention control in the practice of mental silence in Sahaja Yoga 
meditation (Hernandez, Barros-Loscertales, Xiao, Gonzalez-Mora, & Rubia, 
2018). 
A meta-analysis by [CONTACT_447635] 
“fibromyalgia, chronic pain, rheumatoid arthritis, type 2 diabetes, chronic fatigue 
syndrome, multiple chemical sensitivity, and cardiovascular diagnoses.”  This 
analysis also reported no negative outcomes between baseline and follow-up 
assessments (Merkes, 2010) . 
While it can be difficult to differentiate and locate the source of a patient’s 
tinnitus, it is thought to originate in any combination of three areas – namely 
peripherally from the auditory system, centrally, or from somatosensory input.  
Tinnitus is commonly associated with specific regions of the brain, particularly, 
the Dorsal Cochlear Nucleus, Central Auditory Pathway, and Auditory Cortex 
(Han, Lee, Kim, Lim, & Shin, 2009) .  Most recently, using residual inhibition, 
 Page [ADDRESS_569278] all of the auditory cortex and large portions of the temporal, parietal, 
sensorimotor, and limbic cortex (2015). 
Given tinnitus is believed to cause neuroplastic changes in several areas of the 
brain (Han et al., 2009)  and that meditation and mindfulness activities are shown 
to make restorative changes in those same areas while improving emotional 
responses, this study investigates the association between the amount of time 
spent and type of meditation and relief from tinnitus through reduction of bother. 
McKenna et al., have found significant reduction of bother in patients with 
chronic tinnitus through the use of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy 
(MBCT), a standardized approach to tinnitus management following an eight-
week MBCT program led by [CONTACT_447636].  They rightly point out that 
much of the current research in non-standardized approaches, like the one 
proposed in this study, has been limited by [CONTACT_25211] (2018).  This study 
looks to add to the body of research for non-standardized interventions and lead to 
the possibility of increased access to care for patients.

4.0 Study Design 
4.1 Describe and explain the study design (e.g. case-control, cross-sectional, 
ethnographic, experimental, interventional, longitudinal, observational). 
 Page 11 of 39   Response: This study is a non-randomized interventional study in which subjects 
with bothersome tinnitus will meditate to investigate how meditation effects the 
level of bother of their tinnitus.  
 
5.0 Local Number of Subjects 
5.1 Indicate the total number of subjects that will be enrolled or records that 
will be reviewed locally. 
Response: Target enrollment will be [ADDRESS_569279] to screen to reach your 
target sample (i.e. your screen failure rate).  
Response: It is not expected that there will be a significant number of failures 
during screening.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_569280] access to? What percentage of those potential subjects 
do you need to recruit? 
Response:  Subjects will be recruited from the University at Buffalo’s Tinnitus 
Support Group, which has 400 members, and the Speech-Language and Hearing 
Clinic.  Additionally, information will be sent to area ENT doctors and audiology 
clinics, ideally adding another 100 potential participants.  Online participants will 
be targeted through public announcements shared with various universities and 
clinics.  With a target of 30 participants, 6% of the potential pool will fulfill that 
goal.  
 
6.0 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria 
6.1 Describe the criteria that define who will be included in your final study 
sample.  
NOTE:  This may be done in bullet point fashion. 
Response:

than three months. 
 Have been evaluated by [CONTACT_447638]. 
 Those willing and able to utilize their own smart device or computer 
meeting the following requirements.   Commented [RJ5]: This information is more appropriate to 
integrate into section 10.1.  Section 4.1 should simply be a brief 
description of the study design.  
Commented [RJ7]: This section is meant to describe the 
feasibility of the study.  This appears to be a description of 
recruitment methods. 
Commented [BF6]: Too vague? 
Commented [BF8]: Revise to reflect the group size not the

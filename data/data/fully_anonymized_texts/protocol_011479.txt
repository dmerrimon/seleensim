1.1 SYNOPSIS  
Title:  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Real -Time Pain Management Intervention for 
Sickle Cell via Mobile Applications  (CaRISMA)  
Grant Number:    
Study Description:  We are conducting a comparative effectiveness trial among  adult patients with sickle 
cell disease (SCD) who report chronic pain (N = 350), randomized to receive either 
mobile phone -delivered computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT; n = 175) 
or digital education (m -Education; n = 175).  Both intervention groups will receive 
weekly (more frequent if requested or needed) follow -up with a health coach for at 
least 3 months to reinforce learned materials. Both groups will also use their mobile 
device to  track daily pain, mood,  and medication used . They will also be given access 
to a study -associated online support group page  where they can d iscuss with other 
patients, issues they faced and what skills were or could be used to address them.  
Participants will continue all routine care including opi[INVESTIGATOR_635467].  
Objectives:  Primary Objective:  Determine whether  cCBT will confer greater benefit on 
daily pain intensity and pain interference at 6 months, 
compared to m -Education  
Secondary Objectives:  Determine whether  cCBT  will confer greater benefit on 
depressive symptoms, health care utilization, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_635468] m -Education  
 
Endpoints:  Primary Endpoint:  Daily pain intensity, pain interference  
Secondary Endpoints:  Depressive symptoms,  health care utilization (opi[INVESTIGATOR_611779], acute care visits) and opi[INVESTIGATOR_635469] (Current Opi[INVESTIGATOR_85581] – COMM)  
 
Study Population:  Male and female p atients that are  18-[ADDRESS_849032] a diagnosis of SCD (any 
genotype) , report chronic pain (i.e., pain ≥ 4 days/ week and/or are prescribed long -
acting or daily opi[INVESTIGATOR_635470]  3 months  or longer ) and are able to 
access the study intervention

Description of Study 
Intervention/Experimental 
Manipulation:  The study interventions are both Internet -delivered, evidence -based tools that have 
been tailored specifically for the target population through a user -centered approach 
that has engaged stakeholders at each stage of the process.   
1. Computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT) for pain.  The cCBT 
program will teach users how to recognize negative thoughts and emotions, 
use cognitive skills and problem -solving, and apply copi[INVESTIGATOR_635471], activity scheduling, and relaxation. The  cCBT arm emphasizes 
skills acquisition and learning through practice; this intervention is 
consistent with the tailored behavioral services patients would receive 
individually or as a group when working with a psychologist or behavioral 
pain specialist .  
2. Mobile -delivered pain and sickle cell disease education (m -Education).  The 
m-Education program will teach users about chronic pain, healthy lifestyle 
tips (e.g., nutrition and exercise) , and facts about SCD. This program is 
consistent with the education patients and families would receive with a 
patient educator .

2 INTRODUCTION  
2.1 STUDY RATIONALE  
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Real -Time Pain Management Intervention for Sickle Cell via Mobile Application 
(CaRISMA) is a pragmatic comparative effectiveness trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of two evidence -
based, mobile -technology –delivered behavioral pain interventions for adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) in real -
time, routine practice conditions.  
  
Sickle cell disease affects millions of people worldwide and over 100,[ADDRESS_849034] common symptom among adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) ,[ADDRESS_849035], cognitive behavioral therapy (C BT) has not routinely been part of pain 
management in SCD care because of multiple barriers to providing quality CBT pain services, including lack of local 
availability or access, cost, and even the stigma associated with seeing a mental health specialist. Th is study aims 
to demonstrate tha t behavioral interventions can be an effective component of adult SCD care, and to identify 
which of the programs tested (cCBT or m -Education) work for which patients and when. If successful this study will 
determine whether the study interventions have a significant impact on daily pain and pain interference. We will 
also evaluate spi[INVESTIGATOR_635472]. Providers will have the necessary information to improve 
pain management in SCD care.  
 
Significance of Problem  
Behavioral approaches to managing chronic pain are effective and used routinely in other pain populations. 
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), in particular, is the gold standard of behavioral approaches to managing pain in 
the general population. However,  despi[INVESTIGATOR_635473], CBT is not used routinely as a treatment for pain in SCD and is rarely offered to SCD patients.  
  
There are two primary reasons why CBT is not part of routine SCD care. First, there is a lack of access to CBT due to 
the expense of providing face -to-face therapy in low -resource clinical settings and a shortage of available CBT -
trained therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], especially those with a sickle cell focus. Even if a CBT therapi[INVESTIGATOR_635474], therapy is time -
consuming and requires travel to a clinic, which is already challenging for patients with limited resources. Second, 
there are no large -scale studies testing wheth er CBT is more effective or preferred by [CONTACT_635525], families, and 
clinicians over other non -pharmacological strategies like pain education, which is already widely available to the 
 
 
SCD population through community -based organizations (CBOs) via the Internet and social media and may provide 
similar health benefits .8,9 
 
This study proposes to overcome barriers to routine use of behavioral treatments for pain in adult SCD care. 
Through the use of mobile technology, we are now able to provide high -quality, evidence -based behavioral pain 
treatment that can be scaled to reach patients in under -resourced settings. Computerized (Web - or mobile -based) 
cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT) is an effective alternative to traditional face -to-face CBT .10,[ADDRESS_849036], cCBT is 
now offered as part of routine care in the [LOCATION_006]12,13  and is offered by [CONTACT_635526]. We know 
cCBT is effective for pain14-17 but we don’t know what works best for whom and when. For example, cCBT has not 
been compared to pain education, which is readily available and accessible to the SCD community via our CBO 
partners. Thus, in a multisite pra gmatic trial, we will compare the effectiveness and patient preference of cCBT 
versus pain education in adults with SCD.  
 
 
Figure [ADDRESS_849037] of cognitive behavorial therapy (CBT) and education in sickle cell disease. 
Interventions implemented through internet forums, community -based organizations (CBOs), and outpatient clinics.  
AIM 1:  Compare the effectiveness of two mobile -phone –delivered programs —cCBT  versus pain and SCD education 
(m-Education) —for reducing SCD pain symptoms. In a multisite comparative effectiveness trial conducted at five 
comprehensive sickle cell centers and three CBOs, we will recruit [ADDRESS_849038] 12 weeks, one group will be asked to engage in a mobile cCBT 
program tailored for adults with SCD (cCBT). The second group will receive pain and SCD education on their mobile 
phones (m -Education). Both prog rams use identical mobile -technology platforms; only the content differs. All 
participants will have weekly check -ins with a health coach during the first 12 weeks and will track pain symptoms 
daily on the study mobile phone app .  
 
Our study hypotheses are : 
H1: cCBT will confer greater benefit on pain outcomes at 6 months, compared to m -Education. Outcomes of 
this trial will include change in average weekly pain intensity (primary) and pain interference (secondary) at 6 
months. As a secondary investigation, we will look at sustainability of the intervention effects out to 12 
months.  
H2: cCBT will confer greater benefit on depressive symptoms at 6 months, compared to m -Education.  
H3: cCBT will confer greater decreases in health care utilization (opi[INVESTIGATOR_75155], acute care visits) over 12 
months, compared to m -Education.  
  
AIM 2:  Assess whether baseline depression symptoms moderate the effect of interventions on pain outcomes. 
Evidence suggests CBT may be particularly helpful for patients with mental health comorbidities .[ADDRESS_849039] (HTE) by [CONTACT_635527]. Subgroup analysis will be conducted 
by [CONTACT_635528]. To further understand 

 
 
which intervention works best for whom and when, the lived experience of patients in the trial, and differences in 
perceptions between depression subgroups, we will do a series of qualitative interviews.  
 
Expected Outcomes.  
This study will (1) demonstrate the effectiveness of a low -cost, scalable, evidence -based behavioral approach for 
pain management that meets the needs of patients and providers, and (2) show that behavioral approaches can be 
readily implemented into routin e SCD care. This study will help define best practices for non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_635475] -income, racial minority populations, and low -resource care settings.  
2.2 BACKGROUND  
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder that affects 100,[ADDRESS_849040] 
majority of the people affected by [CONTACT_635529] ;[ADDRESS_849041] on patients’ daily functioning 
and quality of life .22,[ADDRESS_849042] been associated with more hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]/emergency 
room visits and with premature death .24-[ADDRESS_849043] 
important area of sickle cell care that needs to be addressed.  
  
Current standards for pain management in SCD are, overall, unsatisfactory .27,28 There is an overreliance on opi[INVESTIGATOR_635476], despi[INVESTIGATOR_635477] .2,3,29,30  Up to 87% of adults and up to 44% of children age < 6yrs old with SCD are 
prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]31 even though there are no data on their long -term efficacy. It is likely that side effects and 
hyper -analgesia contribute to increased pain32 and a lower overall quality of life .[ADDRESS_849044] care for 
pain management .34 Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is considered the gold standard of non -pharmacological 
treatment for chronic pain .[ADDRESS_849045] .36 Offering CBT via the 
Internet not only overcomes these barriers but can be as effective as face -to-face CBT .10,11 A recent meta -analysis 
found that using computerized CBT (cCBT) can help decrease pain intensity, interference/disability, and 
catastrophizing, and can have significant spi[INVESTIGATOR_635478] .15 cCBT can be particularly effective when 
accompanied by [CONTACT_635530] a health coach, an individual who can be available remotely by [CONTACT_635531], and well as encouragement and support .37 Given the effectiveness of 
cCBT, the [LOCATION_006]’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) made cCBT standard of care and available 
to all patients in the [LOCATION_006] .12,[ADDRESS_849046] add -on to routine care, and is now 
being offered by [CONTACT_635532].  
  
 
 
SIGNIFICANCE  The proposed study addresses the stress -pain cycle (Figure  3) and has the potential to demonstrate 
how the adoption of cCBT or m -Education into clinical practice can improve pain management and decrease opi[INVESTIGATOR_635479].  
  
Understanding pain in SCD using the 
biopsychosocial model .38-41 To determine the 
causes of pain in SCD, we interviewed 
stakeholders, conducted focus groups, reviewed 
the literature, analyzed discussions about SCD on 
social media forums, and consulted with experts 
in hematology, psychology, and pain. This work 
led to an  adapted version of the biopsychosocial 
model that we use here as a framework to 
understand the pain cycle in SCD and guide our 
research question. As described in Figure 3, the 
experience of unpredictable acute pain and 
daily,  unrelenting chronic pain ca n lead to 
deleterious negative thoughts and low self -
efficacy; self -efficacy is the degree to which one 
believes they can succeed in managing their 
disease. “There is nothing I can do about this 
pain,” said one young adult with SCD as he 
described the unpr edictable and unrelenting 
nature of his pain and the limited control he had 
over his health.  
This conceptual model shows how a pain event or 
external stressor such as losing a job can put patients into a vicious cycle of stress, negative emotions, hyper -
arousal, and pain  (Figure 3). This model aided us in: (1) defining the problem, (2) selecting behavior(s) to target, 
and (3) describing what needs to change in order to achieve less pain and disability.  
This research is focused on outcomes of interest to patients and their caregivers. Negative thoughts and lack of 
perceived self -efficacy contribute to adults with SCD feeling overwhelmed and helpless. Perceived stress leads to 
depression and anxiety, as well as increased physiological arousal, and can trigger a vaso -occlusive crisis. In 
addition to highlighting the negative impact stress has on pain, our stakeholders also provided examples of 
behavioral strategies they use to cope with emotional distress an d pain, such as distraction, relaxation, and 
positive thinking. Strengthening, expanding, promoting, and connecting these behavioral strategies with self -
efficacy will improve SCD care, and potentially reduce reliance on opi[INVESTIGATOR_635480].  
  
The primary outcome for this study is change in daily pain intensity . The University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109] (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_32887]) Sickle Cell 
Advocacy Team, a group of patient and caregiver partners, identified pain as the primary aspect of SCD that needs 
more awareness and attention. We also analyzed posts and comments made between Oct. [ADDRESS_849047] popular SCD Facebook groups, Sickle Cell Warriors and Sickle Cell Unite .42  Of 32,977 messages, 
22.5% (7,446) included the word “pain” or “crisis.” Sentiment analyses showed that messages with mentions of 
pain were associated with less social connection and more negativ e emotions such as anxiety. This study, 
therefore, seeks to address pain and the socio -emotional needs expressed by [CONTACT_635533].  
  
Figure 3  - Diagram presents the biopsychosocial model adapted to 
show the hypothesized mechanisms linking behavioral and social 
factors to physiological pain in SCD. The model suggests that external 
stressors can initiate negative thoughts and a cycle of stress an d pain.  
 
 
Mental health symptoms are a major issue that goes unaddressed. Mental health is rarely assessed or treated in 
SCD,43 although 22% to 57% of patients with SCD have clinically significant symptoms of depression, and 
potentially even more patients suffer from anxiety symptoms. The Sickle Cell Community Consortium (SCCC), led 
by [CONTACT_3252] -I Lakiea Bailey, has identified mental hea lth as a top priority and advocates for educating the community, 
and for routinely screening for mental health symptoms and providing treatment. This study aims to identify how 
we can fill this gap in SCD care.  
 
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT  
2.3.1 KNOWN POTENTIAL RISKS  
 
The anticipated risk to the research participants is minimal. The participants will perform routine psychological 
assessments and self -report questionnaires. There may be some emotional discomfort with engaging in the 
behavioral intervention and disclosing personal information, but this is expected to be minimal.  
 
Due to the depressive symptoms associated with SCD, this behavioral intervention study  may reveal pre -existing 
suicidal thoughts/behaviors. To safeguard against potential suicide attempts, the PHQ -9 administered at baseline, 
3-, 6-, and 12 -month time points will be used to screen participants for possible suicide risk factors. A positive 
response will initiate the Suicide Risk Management Protocol described in Section  2.3.3, Assessment of Potential 
Risks and Benefits.   
  
The social network component of the study also presents some risk. Upon consenting to the study, participants will 
be linked to a study -associated online support group page (Facebook group) that will be monitored by [CONTACT_635534], SC101. Though SC101 will monitor the page regularly, there is still a risk for 
negative or offensive comments to be posted and read by [CONTACT_635535]. User participation on the online support group and freq uency of access will not be recorded. The identity of 
participants will not be masked. Information shared by [CONTACT_635536].  
  
This study also involves the collection of data over the Internet using mobile devices. Although every reasonable 
effort will be taken, confidentiality during Internet communication procedures cannot be guaranteed and it is 
possible that additional information beyond that collected for research purposes may be captured and used by 
[CONTACT_370703].  
 2.3.[ADDRESS_849048] access to study data. Study reports will not contain any identifiable information and will present findings 
in aggregate (or by [CONTACT_1570]). De-identified data may  be shared with other researchers in the future.  
 
Suicide Risk Management Protocol (SRMP)  
The Suicide Risk Management Protocol (Figure 4 ) will be embedded within the online survey tool, which is 
administered at baseline  screening , and the 3-, 6-, and 12 -month follow -up time points. It will be triggered on the 
participant’s screen when he/she enters a positive response to the PHQ -9 question, “Over the last [ADDRESS_849049]?” A positive response also 
alerts the patient’s designated health coach.  
Upon SRMP initiation, the Scale for Suicide Ideation (SSI) will be activated on the participant’s screen  via our online 
survey tool in order to gauge severity of suicide risk. There are skip patterns programmed throughout the SSI so 
that participants need only complete subsequent parts if they score high enough. Each item is scored on a 3 -point 
scale ranging  from 0 to 3 and SSI results are dependent upon the answers submitted.  
Parts A and B assess the risk for self -harm. If scores for Part A and B are ≥2, the health coach asks about eight  
established risk factors (Part C). If participants report ≥2 risk factors, the health coach assesses duration and 
acuteness of self -harm ideation (Part D and E) . 
Following completion of the SSI assessment, the health coach will be notified about the participant’s automatically 
assigned risk level for self -harm, which ranges from None to Imminent. Specific actions to be executed by [CONTACT_635537]’s risk level.  
If the SSI risk determination is Moderate  or High  Suicide Risk, the health coach will enter in a “contract of safety” 
with the participant where they will agree upon a follow -up call within two hours. Immediately after hanging up  
 
 
with the participant, the health coach will contact [CONTACT_635538] . At the agreed upon time, the health coach will call the 
participant and execute those directives. Alerts will be sent to the designited clinical and research staff contacts at 
the participant’s local site.  The health coach will record all events in the SRMP Log.

Justification as to why the value of the information to be gained outweighs the risks of participation  
 
This research is necessary to understand the feasibility of a mobile -technology –based behavioral intervention for 
pain that predomina ntly targets a  minority population. In designing this study  we queried [ADDRESS_849052] frequently reported modifiable trigger for 
pain and 88% of respondents wanted to learn about alternatives to taking narcotics for pain.  Ultimately, our OBJECTIVES  ENDPOINTS  JUSTIFICATION FOR ENDPOINTS

our ability to deliver effective  pain treatment to this and other underserved populations.   
 
 
 
4 STUDY DESIGN  
4.1 OVERALL DESIGN  
CaRISMA is a randomized comparative effectiveness trial among adult patients with SCD who report chronic pain 
(N = 350) randomized to receive either cCBT (n = 175) or m -Education (n = 175).  For at least 12 weeks, one group 
will be asked to engage in a mobile cCBT program tailored for adults with SCD. The second group will receive pain 
and SCD education on their mobile phones (m -Education). Both programs use identical mobile -technology 
platfor ms; only the content differs. The cCBT program focuses on teaching  behavioral copi[INVESTIGATOR_635482]’ “seeing and doing” while the pain education arm focuses on improving self -management through 
participants’ “learning and knowing” more about pain and SCD. All participants will have weekly check -ins with a 
health coach during the first 12 weeks of the intervention and will track pain symptoms daily on the  app.  
 
AIM 1:  Compare the effectiveness of two mobile phone -delivered programs —cCBT versus pain and SCD education 
(m-Education) —for reducing SCD pain symptoms. In a multisite comparative effectiveness trial conducted at five 
comprehensive sickle cell centers and three CBOs, we will recruit [ADDRESS_849054] 12 weeks, one group will be asked to engage in a mobile cCBT 
program tailored for adults with SCD. The second group will receive pain an d SCD education on their mobile 
phones (m -Education). Both programs use identical mobile -technology platforms; only the content differs. All 
participants will have weekly check -ins with a health coach during the first 12 weeks and will track pain symptoms 
daily on the intervention . Our study hypotheses are:  
H1: cCBT will confer greater benefit on pain outcomes at 6 months, compared to m -Education. Outcomes of 
this trial will include change in average weekly pain intensity (primary) and pain interference (secondary) at 6 
months. As a secondary investigation, we will look at sustainability of the intervention effects at 12 months.  
H2: cCBT will confer greater benefit on depressive symptoms at 6 months, compared to m -Education.  
H3: cCBT will confer greater decreases in health care utilization (opi[INVESTIGATOR_75155], acute care visits) over 12 
months, compared to m -Education.  
  
AIM 2:  Assess whether baseline depression symptoms moderate the effect of interventions on pain outcomes. 
Evidence suggests CBT may be particularly helpful for patients with mental health comorbidities. Therefore, we will 
evaluate heterogeneity of treatment effe ct (HTE) by [CONTACT_635527]. Subgroup analysis will be conducted by 
[CONTACT_635528]. To further understand which 
intervention works best for whom and when, the lived experience of patients in the trial, and differences in 
perceptions between depression subgroups, we will do a series of qualitative interviews.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1 (repeat)  - CaRISMA study design with two interventions arms and [ADDRESS_849055] Arm in Study Design: Computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT) for pain . The cCBT program will teach 
users how to recognize negative thoughts and emotions, use cognitive skills and problem -solving, and apply copi[INVESTIGATOR_635483], activity scheduling, and relaxation. The cCBT arm emphasizes skills acquisition a nd 
learning through practice; thus, the program involves homework assignments and challenges, as well as continued 
check -ins with a health coach who helps reinforce the CBT skil ls and encourages practice and program 
engagement. The cCBT program also give users access to a study -associated Facebook page where they can discuss 
with other patients issues they faced and what skills were or could be used to address them. This interven tion is 
consistent with the tailored behavioral services patients would receive individually or as a group when working 
with a psychologist or behavioral pain specialist.

the chatbot, the patient is ran domized based on their 
study ID into one of two study arms (CBT or Education).  
The patient leaves the clinic and 
interacts with the virtual intervention 
at her own pace.  
Within [ADDRESS_849057] time, it will a utomatically randomize  each participant to either study arm: cCBT or 
m-Education. It will be 1:1 permuted block randomization to prevent imbalance. Because this is an "open -label" 
randomi zed controlled trial ( RCT), we will monitor randomization over time to make sure group allocation is 
similar. The participant will not know which arm they have been assigned to, and they will only have access to the 
materials included in their respective study arm.  Participants will receive a link to  our online survey tool where 
they will be asked to respond to six questionnaires  and the Painimation  app in order to pr ovide their baseline 
measures . The six  questionnaires are as follow s: Sickle Cell Self -Efficacy Scale  (SCSES ), Patient -Reported Outcomes 
Measurement information System ( PROMIS ) Pain Interference , Adult Sickle Cell Quality of Life Measurement 
Information System ( ASCQ -ME), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ -9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD -
7), and the Current Opi[INVESTIGATOR_85581] (COMM) . Painimation is an electronic pain assessment tool developed 
by [CONTACT_635541][INVESTIGATOR_635485] s (Figure 
5). 
 
In addition, our partners at  the Qualitative, Evaluation And Stakeholder Engagement (Qual EASE) Research Services 
will conduct a set of qualitative interviews to further understand which intervention works best for whom and 
when, the lived experience of patients in the trial, and differences in perceptions between depression subgroups. 
Qual  EASE will randomly select 48 participants (of the 350) to be interviewed. Attending the qualitative interviews 
is completely voluntary and participants may opt out at any time. However, if one of the 48  selected participants 
does opt out, Qual  EASE will invite another participant, of those not previously selected, as a replacement.  
 
Baseline . 
Participants will receive a link to our online survey tool where they will be asked to respond to a set of 
questionnaires and Painimation, a novel pain assessment tool. The questionnaires are as follows: Sickle Cell Self -
Efficacy Scale (SCSS), Patient -Repo rted Outcomes Measurement information System (PROMIS) Pain Interference, 
Adult Sickle Cell Quality of Life Measurement Information System (ASCQ -ME), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ -
9), Generalized Anxiety Disorders Scale (GAD -7), and the Current Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] M isuse Measure (COMM). For participants 
who are eligible to be randomized, in addition to baseline questionnaires, items from the Copi[INVESTIGATOR_635486] (CSQ) will be asked through the messaging app as participants progress through their respective  
program.   
 
The Painimation tool  is an electronic pain assessment tool developed by [CONTACT_635541][INVESTIGATOR_635487]. Patients are provided with a selection of animations 
that they use to describe the quality of their pa in. The animations can be increased or decreased in speed, color 
saturation, focus and size, to reflect the intensity of their pain.   
 
For intervention participants, in addition to the quantitative assessments, our partners at the Qualitative, 
Evaluation A nd Stakeholder Engagement (Qual EASE) Research Services will conduct a set of qualitative interviews 
to further understand which intervention works best for whom and when, the lived experience of patients in the 
trial, and differences in perceptions betwee n depression subgroups. Qual -EASE will randomly select 48 participants 
(of the 350) to be interviewed. Attending the qualitative interviews is completely voluntary and participants may 
opt out at any time. However, if one of the [ADDRESS_849058] three months of the study, intervention participants will complete all modules of their assigned study 
arm (cCBT or m -Education) at their own pace. The recommended progression is one module per week; this will 
give participants time to practic e the techniques taught in each module. Participants will be asked to complete a 
daily electronic diary to track their pain symptoms.  
 
Only intervention arm participants will receive follow up assessment. The convenience comparison group will not 
be follow ed with scheduled assessments.   
 
1st Follow -Up (T1) . At the end of month 3 (i.e., three months after enrollment, on the same date the participant 
began the study) participants will again receive a link to our online survey tool to complete the second iteration of 
Painimation, the SCSS, PROMIS, ASCQ -ME, PHQ -9, and GAD -7. If participants have questions while completing 
these questionnaires, they may contact [CONTACT_635542] h coach for guidance. Participants will also be asked to complete 
daily pain intensity entries in the electronic diary. If pa rticipants do not complete the questionnaires or the pain 
intensity entries, health coaches will contact [CONTACT_635543]. The [ADDRESS_849059] weekly check -ins with their health coach.

the COMM at T2. Though scheduled weekly check -ins w ith health coaches will have ceased, participants will still 
have the opportunity to contact [CONTACT_635544]. Participants will continue to complete daily pain 
intensity entries through the electronic diary.  
 
Between months [ADDRESS_849061] and final Follow -Up (T3) . In the final month of the study (T3), participants will receive a link to our online 
survey tool to complete Painimation, SCSES, PROMIS, ASCQ -ME, PHQ -9, GAD -7, and COMM for the final time.  
 
Primary Outcome.   
Aim 1 of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two mobile phone -delivered programs —cCBT  versus pain 
and SCD education (m -Education) —for reducing SCD pain symptoms (i.e. pain interference). The secondary 
outcome we expect to change in this study is daily pain intensity. As mentioned above, patients will track pain 
symptoms using an electronic  diary where they will be prompted to complete a symptoms survey once a day. 
Participants will be encouraged to enter their pain symptoms daily. They will receive reminders to keep entering 
daily data at each time point (T0, T1, T2, T3). Participants will have the option to snooze the prompt until a more 
convenient time. For the electronic diary, some format of the following will be administered:  
Daily  
• Using any number from [ADDRESS_849062] pain imaginable, what is your pain 
level today?  
• Did you take opi [INVESTIGATOR_635488]?  
• Which one of the following emojis best represents your mood today?  
Weekly  
• Using any number from [ADDRESS_849063] pain imaginable, what is your pain 
level today?  
• Did you take opi[INVESTIGATOR_635489]?  
• Compared to what you used yesterday, is the amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_635490], 
the same as yesterday, or more than yesterday?  
• Did you take non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_635489]?  
• This past week, how often have you been bothered by [CONTACT_635545]?  
• This past week, how often have you been bothered by [CONTACT_433626], depressed, or irritable?  
• This past week, how often have you been bothered by [CONTACT_635546], anxious, or on edge?  
• This past week, how often have you been bothered by [CONTACT_635547]?  
  
Secondary Outcome Measures.  Aim [ADDRESS_849064] of intervention on pain outcomes. To achieve this, patients will be asked to complete the PROMIS Pain 
Interference Scale44 at baseline,  3 months,  6 months, and 12 months ; PROMIS is  a validated quest ionnaire asking a 
patient how mo st day -to-day function is altered by [CONTACT_77368]. In addition, to assess changes in quality of life and 
emotional distress, participants will complete the following tests at baseline,  3 months,  6 months, and 12 months: 
Adult Sickle Cell Quality of Life Measurement Information  System (ASCQ -ME); Emotional Functioning and Social 
Impact scales ;45,46 the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9) ,47,48 a 9-item measure of depressive symptoms ; and 
the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD -7). Lastly, to assess changes in use of prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], participants 
will complete the Current Opi[INVESTIGATOR_85581] (COMM)49 at baseline  and 12 month follow -up. See Table 4 . 
 
Medical Outcomes (PCORnet).   
For patients recruited at one of the five clinical sites, we will evaluate objectively measured opi[INVESTIGATOR_635491]. We will be working in collaboration with 
PCORnet to collect data retrospectively (from the past 12 months) and prospectively (12 months from date of 
enrollment) from patient medical records. These data will allow us to track medications including opi[INVESTIGATOR_635492], and health care utilizat ion (i.e., emergency department visits and 
 
 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]), as well as lab values (e.g., hemoglobin level) and clinical outcomes (e.g., end -organ damage 
score). For the patients recruited from our community partner organizations or online who are not affiliated with a 
participating clinical cente r, we will only acquire or evaluate their medical records for the purpose of confirming 
their sickle cell diagnosis.   
 
Process evaluation measures.  For the intervention to be effective, patients must use the program and acquire 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_635493] (e.g., 
nutrition/exercise), emotional distress, and physiological response to str essors, all factors contributing to pain. As 
they progress through the intervention , participants will complete elements of the Copi[INVESTIGATOR_635494] (CSQ)50 and the Sickle Cell Self -Efficacy Scale (SCSES) shown in Figure 6 . 
 
Figure 6  - The nine -question Sickle Cell Self -Efficacy Scale ( SCSES ) 
 

 
 
Qualitative Interviews.  Lastly, to further understand which intervention works best for whom and when, the lived 
experience of patients in the trial, and differences in perceptions between depression subgroups, we will do a 
series of qualitative interviews with patients enrolled in both arms of the study, at three time points in the study —
at baseline, in order to assess prior patient experience with SCD and treatment for SCD, and their attitudes toward 
the intervention at the outset; at 3 months when the initial intervention concludes in order to assess their 
experi ence with and opi[INVESTIGATOR_121059]; and at [ADDRESS_849065] and interview 24 patients in each treatment group, stratified 
by [CONTACT_635548], for a total of 48 interviews (i.e., 12 cCBT patients with PHQ ≤10, 12 cCBT patients 
with PHQ >10, 12 m -Education patients with PHQ ≤10, 12 m -Education patients with PHQ >10).  This will allow us to 
qualitatively compare the experiences of patients with differing d epression levels, and to explore quantitative 
findings with regards to intervention efficacy in patients with differing levels of depression severity. Patient sample 
size has been selected to allow for high likelihood of our reaching thematic saturation re garding patient 
experience .[ADDRESS_849066] involving 48 youth 
(ages 11 -17 years) with a variety of pain conditions (e.g., headache, stomachache, musculoskeletal pain). 
Significant reductions in pain and disability were found for youth receiving Web -MAP compared to a wait -list 
control group .[ADDRESS_849067] of the Web -MAP cCBT program 
versus Web -ED, an Internet -delivered pain education program, among 273 youth (ages 10 -17 years) with chronic 
pain (and their parents) recruited from pain centers  around the US and Canada .53 This study found Web -MAP, 
compared to Web -ED, was associated with greater improvements in pain -related disability (p  = .03), sleep quality 
(p = .02), pain -related anxiety (p  < .05), and parent behavior (p  < .001) and distress (p  = .002) at [ADDRESS_849068]. 
Palermo then pi[INVESTIGATOR_635495] -MAP with 25 youth with SCD (median age = 14.2) and their parents. Treatment

iCanCope to our adult population in pi[INVESTIGATOR_48124]. iCanCope SCD serves as the core curriculum and functionality for 
the CBT and education programs being tested here, although we will rebrand and adapt it based on early 
stakeholder input. Some adaptations t hat have already been implemented and improved intervention delivery are 
described below.  
 
How our implementation of cCBT has already changed based on stakeholder input.  From our work testing cCBT 
programs with pediatric and adult patients with SCD we have learned through trial data and interviews that 
patients find cCBT programs helpful; however, there were several aspects of the cCBT programs that could be 
improved. We have continued to work with our community partners to update the technology and ensure the 
content is effective.  
 
Components stakeholders said were essential in a technology -delivered behavioral intervention:  
•Relatability and representativeness.  It was important to patients that they could relate with the content and that 
they saw other people living with sickle cell throughout the program. Our CBT and education videos are scripted 
and delivered by [CONTACT_635549].  
•Interactive content.  The users did not want static content but an interactive experience that was dynamic and 
personalized for their specific situation. “I thought Web -MAP was too simple or basic to help me. I want something 
more interactive that is a more real -world experien ce.” We have added an interactive,  artificial intelligence -based 
chatbot that provides live, 24/7 responses,  and evaluates and delivers what the user wants and needs to see next.  
•Social support group.  Having some connection with other patients or users of the program was a consistent 
theme across all our groups. It was also mentioned frequently as a method patients use to help cope with the 
stress of living with sickle cell. “We communicate almost every  day [on Facebook SCD group], and it really helps.” 
Interventions are directly linked to Facebook groups managed by [CONTACT_635550] (SC101 and 
SCWarriors).  
•Health coach . The presence of a coach has been expressed by [CONTACT_635551]. The coaches provide support to patients and maintain engagement. Our stakeholders like the idea of having 
a real person to contact. Health coaches will be available via text message and phone. We have an adult with SCD 
serving in this role when possible.  
•Status badges or awards.  Participants wanted some indicator of progress through the program. A review of 
mobile health apps showed that patients enjoyed receiving achievement awards and status for completion of 
goals .[ADDRESS_849070] been tailored specifically for the target population 
through a user -centered approach that has engaged stakeholders at each stage of the process.57 
Both interventions will be implemented using mobile phone -delivered programs  for reducing SCD pain 
symptoms —cCBT  versus pain and SCD education (m -Education).  
These comparators were selected because:  
• Both CBT and pain education have shown some effectiveness for improving pain outcomes in SCD .7,58 
• CBT and pain education are the most likely non -pharmacological interventions to be effective in this 
population given the barriers to pain management identified by [CONTACT_1962],  family members, and clinicians . 
 
 
• Our team has extensive experience with delivering these interventions, and we have leveraged the active 
online health -education programs from our community partners.  
• Both interventions can be delivered with the exact same mobile app platforms and associated health 
coach support.  
• Digital health interventions are efficacious and there is much interest among SCD patients to utilize these 
tools .59-64 
How sites were selected: Study clinical sites are comprehensive care centers that have a history of working with 
the study PIs, see 200+ adults with SCD a year, and are PCORnet sites. Our community partners have experience 
working with the research team an d are the most visible educational programs or community advocates in the SCD 
community.

5.5 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION  
The target sample size for this study is 350 participants and they will be recruited both in -person from five clinical 
sites ( Pi[INVESTIGATOR_32887], Duke, Hopkins , OSU, UIC) and online  through  our community partners (SC101 , SCCC  and Sickle Cell 
Warriors) . Vanderbilt University will also advertise the study. This strategy helps ensure that we recruit a 
representative spectrum of the population and that all patients, regardless of geography, can participate.  The 
study clinical sites are comprehensive care centers that have a history of working with the study PIs, see 200+ 
adults with SCD a year, and are PCOR net sites. Our community partners have experience working with the research 
team and are the most visible educational programs or community advocates in the SCD community. See Table 5  
for information about recruitment. The anticipated racial/ethnic and gender distribution of participants is outlined 
below in Table  6. The intervention content and presentation is specifically designed for adult s, thus, the age has 
been restricted to 18 -65 years.  
 
In-person recruitment at clinical sites:  
At Pi[INVESTIGATOR_32887], Duke, Hopkins , OSU, and UIC, a  tablet -administered screening tool and best practice alerts will be used to 
identify patients with SCD who have chronic pain as indicated by [CONTACT_6270] -report. Best practice alerts will flag patients 
with a chronic pain diagnosis or who have been prescribed chr onic opi[INVESTIGATOR_199628]. Each clinical site will 
screen ~[ADDRESS_849076] to approach and screen a sum total of 450 potential participants across  all five 
clinical sites.   
 
Online recruitment  through community partners :  
Our CB O partners have created an active community that reach es [ZIP_CODE]+ patients  with SCD . For this study SC101, 
SCWarriors, and SCCC will seek out p otential participants via message blasts on their CBO  websites, social media 
groups,  email listservs, and at patient/family meetings. SCW arriors  has a unique database of over [ADDRESS_849077] be able to read the study 
consent and correctly answer comprehension questions (our group is currently using and has published data using 
this electronic consent process in a clinical study65 and a large multisite trial of cCBT53). Cassandra Trimnell (co -I) 
will lead online recruitment  efforts through SC101. Tosin Ola, RN, will promote the study through SCWarriors,  and 
Lakiea  Bailey, PhD, will promote the study through the SCCC network of CBOs.  
 
Once  participant s finish the initial screener and are approved to be enrolled , they  will be complete consent 
procedures as outlined in the Consent Procedures and Documentation. After consenting, they  will be assigned a 
health coach , linked to the study -associated  Face book page, and will receive instructions on how to access the 
CaRISMA intervention  to begin the ir intervention  arm.

throughout the participant's 12 month participation in the study. At baseline, they will receive $[ADDRESS_849079] with their health coach. At each follow -up: 3 -month, 6 -month, a nd 12 -month time points, participants will 
receive $50 after completion of questionnaires for that follow -up assessment. An extra $[ADDRESS_849080] to

participant is enrolled in the data collection phase of the  study.  
 
Participants in the non -intervention comparison group will not receive payment.  
 
How barriers to recruitment  and retention will be overcome  
 It is well known that recruiting and retaining racial minority and low -income participants in clinical trials is 
challenging .66 SCD has historically been a particularly challenging population for conducting clinical trials, with 25% 
of SCD trials being terminated, most due to low enrollment .[ADDRESS_849081] involved our stakeholders in all aspects of study design and implementation  to tailor CaRISMA to their 
needs and to help achieve  optimal intervention engagement. Below is a description of stakeholder involvement:  
 
1. Patients and family members have helped us design the intervention content.  
o Real patients, not actors, are featured in the photos and videos presented in the interventions.  
o Our primary stakeholder partners are co -investigators on this project. [CONTACT_69331] will consult with 
[CONTACT_635587] on planning the patient engagement strategy. [CONTACT_635588] is leading the patient 
education arm of the study, has led the design of the conten t, and will ensure the effectiveness 
of the intervention education materials throughout the course of the study.  
o Our intervention content is co -developed and contributed by [CONTACT_1962], with [CONTACT_635589] -Moore, 
a patient -advocate, serving as a partner on the creative process and on camera talent during the 
 
 
intervention development . The interventions are heavily reliant on video interviews and 
statements by [CONTACT_1962]. We are making it possible for patients to enroll in this study online so 
patients from any geographic region can participate. This is in response to patients at a patie nt-
led meeting and on social media stating their frustration about not having access to clinical trials 
being held outside of their geographic location.  
2. [CONTACT_635587] will work closely with the CBO partners on patient engagement and recruitment strategy.  
o [CONTACT_635588] will lead the patient education arm of the study with consultation from the study 
team and community partners, and guide what content participants will see on the intervention. 
This will involve assessing the educational needs of the respectiv e populations and updating the 
educational materials in the first 6 months of the funding period before the trial begins.  
o [CONTACT_635588] will also help with selecting and training health coaches. We will target patients or 
family members who are qualified, to serve as the research assistants and health coaches. (Our 
patient stakeholders preferred being mentored or coached by [CONTACT_635552].) [CONTACT_635588] will aid in the selection and training of 
qualified research assistants and coaches.  During the study  health coaches will communicate 
regularly with participants and encour age engagement in the CaRISMA intervention . 
3. Local and State Policy Makers  
o Each year we will update our local P ennsylvania  representatives Ed Gainey and Jake Wheatley, 
who have been advocates for SCD, and approach policy makers in Harrisburg, PA, regarding this 
project and the opportunities to disseminate treatment.  
4.  The Sickle Cell Advocacy Team (SCAT) in Pi[INVESTIGATOR_635499] a patient -led group that was started to provide

6.1 STUDY INTERVENTION(S) OR EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION(S) ADMINISTRATION  
 
6.1.1 STUDY INTERVENTION OR EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION DESCRIPTION  
  
We followed the social -cognitive theory68 to inform our intervention selection and implementation strategy69 
(Table 7 ). Based on patient interviews (see  Table 8  for interview questions) and feedback from our pi[INVESTIGATOR_20732], we 
identified important barriers and facilitators to implementation that we needed  to address. Using a social -
cognitive theory framework, we categorized the barriers and matched each of them to a corresponding 
intervention. Elements of the capability, opportunity, motivation, and behavior (COM -B) model70 were also used to 
match behavioral targets to specific intervention functions.

and the respective intervention functions and behavior change techniques.  
 
  
 

 
 
 
 
 
Table 8  - Theoretical framework used to guide stakeholder interviews and engagement. We engaged stakeholders 
throughout our study design process to better understand stakeholder needs and the barriers to improved pain 
management among adults with SCD. This tables  shows how interview guides were developed using the Theoretical 
domains framework (TDF). An online survey sent to [CONTACT_635590]’s Sickle Cell Warriors group included six of 
these questions.  
 
 

 
 
Each of the 350 patients recruited will be asked to complete all modules in one of two programs within the 
Internet -delivered CaRISMA pain intervention: cCBT or m -Education. Participants will only have access to the 
content that is relevant to their assign ed program, which they will be randomized into when they open the 
CaRISMA intervention  for the first time. In addition to completing the modules, participants will also be asked to 
have weekly check -ins (via phone or text) with their assigned health coach during the first [ADDRESS_849083] accurate data to track each participant’s health outcomes while 
using the CaRISMA intervention .  
 
The two  arms of the study are described below:  
Computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT) for pain.  The cCBT program in the CaRISMA intervention  focuses 
on teaching behavioral copi[INVESTIGATOR_635500] “seeing and doing.”  cCBT modules will teach users how to recognize 
negative thoughts and emotions, use cognitive skills and problem -solving, and apply copi[INVESTIGATOR_635471], activity scheduling, and relaxation. The cCBT arm emphasizes skills acquisition and le arning through 
practice; thus, the program involves homework assignments and challenges, as well as continued check -ins with a 
health coach who will help reinforce the CBT skills and encourage practice and program engagement. The cCBT 
program will also give users access to a study -associated Facebook page where they can discuss with other 
patients, issues they faced and what skills were or could be used to address them. This program is  consistent with 
the tailored behavioral services patients would receive individually or as a group when working with a psychologist 
or behavioral pain specialist.  
Pain and sickle cell disease education (m -Education).  The m -Education program in the CaRISMA intervention 
focuses on improving self -management through “learning and knowing” more about pain and SCD.  The m -
Education program will teach users about chronic pain, healthy lifestyle tips (e.g., nutrition and exercise) and facts 
about SCD. The emphasis will be on knowledge acquisition and will give users an opportunity to apply what they 
have learned throug h brief quizzes and discussion with the health coach and t he social network. This program is 
consistent with the education patients and families would receive with a patient educator or what is currently 
provided through our community partners, Sickle Cell Warriors (SCWarriors) and Sickle Cell 101 (SC101), and SC CC 
via the Web, social media, and at community events.  
 
6.1.2 ADMINISTRATION AND/OR DOSING  
 
For at least [ADDRESS_849084]. The second group  will receive pain and SCD education on their mobile phones (m -Education). The 
CaRISM A intervention , which delivers both cCBT and m -Education programs, is accessed on a smartphone and is 
made up of  four  primary components:  
 
1) Chatbot and Health Coach Messaging. Using artificial intelligence (AI) similar to Alexa or Siri, we provide 
24/[ADDRESS_849085], our health coaches will 
send personalized messages via text message or through the chatbot platform.  
2) Toolbox and Badges. As users go through the lessons via the chatbot, they can view their progress and 
gain access to all the lessons and tools they have unlocked. This is where they can also view status badges 
they received for specific accomplishments.  
3) Pain Diary. Users will record their pain, mood, and medications used daily on the CaRISMA intervention . 
They can also view trends in their pain/mood data.  
4) Social. The intervention  encourages users to visit CBO social media groups and live meetups run by [CONTACT_635553]. Access to outside social support will not be monitored or recorded.  
 
Through interacting  with the chatbot, study participants will view video lessons and answer quiz questions to verify 
understanding of the material. If a quiz question is answered incorrectly, the chatbot will provide the correct 
answer to clear up any misunderstanding of the  material. The chatbot has been programmed by [CONTACT_635554]’s needs. Participants are asked personalized questions in between 
video lessons to aid in transferring the learned techniques to real -world application. Participants interested in 
learning more are also given the option to view extra, topic -specific content.  
  
In addition to completion of the cCBT or m -Education modules, all participants will track pain symptoms daily on 
the CaRISMA intervention , and  will have weekly check -ins with a health coach by [CONTACT_635555] 12 
weeks. At each follow -up assessment, they will complete a battery of questionnaires which can include 
Painimation,  the PROMIS Pain Interference Scale, as well as Adult Sickle Cell Quality of Life Measurement 
Information  System ( ASCQ -ME); Emotional Functioning and Social Impact scales; the Patient Health Questionnaire 
(PHQ9) ,  the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD -7), the Sickle Cell Self -Efficacy Scale (SCSES), and th e Current 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_85581] (COMM).  
  
The recommended progression  is one module per week ; however, participants will be  allowed to complete the 
modules at their own pace. In the study design, patients have been allotted 12 weeks to complete all modules in 
an attempt to increase adherence and prevent participants from feeling overburdened by [CONTACT_635556].  During 
weekly check -ins, health coaches will  encourage participants to continue engaging in the lessons and inputting 
their daily pain diary, even after completion of the modules.   
Engagement will be measured by [CONTACT_635557] , number of lessons completed, and 
number of interactions (text/phone) with health coaches over the first 12 weeks. Use of the CaRISMA Facebook 
page is not part of the intervention administration; it is simply a tool supported by [CONTACT_635558] t he 
SCD community.  
6.[ADDRESS_849086] TRAINING AND TRACKING  
 
To maintain intervention continuity and fidelity, before any new content is uploaded to the platform it will 
undergo a review. The Content Review Group is composed of Drs. Palermo, Stinson , and Lalloo, study Co-
Investigators, and will evaluate each added lesson to judge whether it is consistent with the core intervention 
functions, either cognitive behavioral therapy or pain and sickle cell disease education. No new content will be 
implemented without consensus of  this group.  Effectiveness of all digital content will be evaluated by [CONTACT_635559], “likes,” and activity subsequent to viewing the content. These metrics are also used in an algorithm to 
decide what content to push to the user next.  
  
The Data Coordinating Center (DCC) led by [CONTACT_15957] -PI [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Abebe  will develop the reporting plan. Reporting will follow 
the most updated C onsolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (C ONSORT )[ADDRESS_849087] period (Year 4), the DCC will develop 
and make available a codebook, relevant programming code, and study protocol. This will allow for replication of 
our findings by [CONTACT_635560].  
  
Monthly meetings with the study PI s, community partners , and co -investigators will help uncover study -related 
issues. These issues will be brought to quarterly  trial steering committee  (TSC) meetings , which will be responsible 
for overseeing the trial’s progress; receiving the Data Monitoring Committee’s recommendations regarding safety 
and benefit of continuing or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356]; ensuring the trial is operating in accordance with similar trials, 
information from which will be gathered and reviewed; dis seminating status and progress updates from the trial to 
sponsors, funders, and other groups; and making their own recommendations about how to present the results of 
the trial on a wider scale to a broader audience.  
  
How will decision s be reached? Wherever possible, the TSC will reach a consensus with all members (non -
independent and independent) on the preferred plan of action for addressing an issue. If consensus cannot be 
reached, the issue will be put up for a vote . Where there is a tie vote, [CONTACT_635591]’s vote will be outweighed by [CONTACT_635561] -independent  members. In preparation for each quarterly TSC meeting, [CONTACT_635591] will prepare a report 
similar to the following template based on Harman et al.:  
1. Summary of the data monitoring committee (DMC) recommendations, unless the TSC has decided to 
serve in the role as the DMC.  
2. Actual recruitment rate versus target rate (by [CONTACT_24473]/quarter).  
3. Acceptance rate as a proportion of the following : i) those invited to participate, and  ii) if known, all 
eligible participants . 
4. Percentage of participants proceeding through each trial stage to allow monitoring of the recruitment and 
retention, including missing outcome data. Not split by [CONTACT_3148]/intervention arms.  
5.  Quarterly forecasts of recruitment for the planned remainder of the trial.  
6.  Losses to follow -up as follows: i) as a proportion of those entered, and ii) per quarter.  
7.  Data management metrics: rate of returns, volume of queries, time to return, enhanced metrics via 
electronic data capture.  
8.  Number for whom follow -up has been completed successfully (or still being successfully followed).  
9.  Overall withdrawal rate and level of withdrawal summarizing those patients who have withdrawn from 
treatment but are still in follow -up and those who withdraw with no future contact.  
10. Summary of adherence to treatment/intervention. Not split by [CONTACT_3148]/intervention arms.  
11.  Summary of adverse events including type, for example, adverse events, serious adverse events , and 
suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions.  
12. Completeness of data collected.  
 
 
13. Any available results (pooled).  
14. Summary of protocol deviations overall and by [CONTACT_3725].  
15. Any organizational problems or other trial issues.  
16. Other issues or documents specific to this trial as requested by [CONTACT_579293].  
 
6.3 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS: RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING  
 
Randomization:  Participants will be randomized in an equal fashion (1:1) to both study arms. Random permuted 
block randomization will be used to create an allocation list that will integrated within our Web -based data entry 
system. Stratification will be based on recrui tment site (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_32887], Duke, Hopkins, OSU, UIC) or through one of the 
community partners (SC101, SCCC , and Sickle Cell Warriors).  
 
Reduce the potential for biases. The introduction to b oth interventio ns will look identical and participants will not 
be told what  type of training they are receiving. We will make every effort to mask the intervention type; however, 
as with all  behavioral interventions, completely blinding participants to the intervention is challenging . The 
investigative team will continue to maintain clinical equipoise regarding the comparative therapeutic merits of 
each treatment. Randomization will avoid selection bias as well as volunteer or referral bias. A dropout analysis 
will be carried out to d etermine the contribution of attrition bias. All outcomes measures will be collected 
electronically, without an interview, to avoid expectation bias. We have also found this mode of data collection to 
be superior to assessments  by [CONTACT_635562] -up. Finally, we will avoid participant recall or memory bias 
by [CONTACT_635563], fatigue, and other health outcomes via mobile device.  
 
To limit potential bias from investigators, we are implementing a dual PI [INVESTIGATOR_635501],  
monitoring, and analysis from the day -to-day implementation of the study interventions and engagements with  
community partners who can influence the outcomes of the trial. Broadly put, [CONTACT_635587] will be primarily  
responsible for stakeholder and community engagement and the scientific/clinical aspects of this trial, while [CONTACT_635592] will be responsible for the data and statistical analysis of the trial. In addition to limiting bias, we believe 
that due to the intens ive plan we have outlined for stakeholder and community engagement, the overall project 
benefits from having a PI ([CONTACT_635587]) who is dedicated  to this role and who has less responsibility for data 
oversight.  
 
6.4 STUDY INTERVENTION/EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION ADHERENCE  
 
The major assumption is that patients will complete the intervention program to which they are randomly 
assigned. Although we have implemented several methods to promote engagement and limit dropout (e.g., health 
coaches72), digital interventions often experience high attrition over time with few participants completing all 
assigned modules .73 We will track the reasons for noncompletion and seek patterns (e.g., moved away, died, 
started working and became too busy, people with higher cognitive level lost interest) that are amenable to 
statistical analysis of the missing data.  
   
 
 
We will have monthly study retention meetings led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Jonassaint and [CONTACT_635588] to discuss recruitment, 
retention, and engagement at all sites. The health  coaches will report to [CONTACT_635588] and the study PIs if they are 
having difficulty contact[CONTACT_635564]. [CONTACT_635588] will also visit the health coaches at the 
University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_635502]. She will occasionally visit with the health  coaches at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_635503].  
 
[CONTACT_635588] will train health coaches on how to keep track of each participant’s progress throughout the 
intervention. Each participant wi ll be required to complete all  modules, as well as weekly health coach check -ins 
during the first 12 weeks , and daily pain diaries throughout the 12 months  of the study . In addition, participants 
will also be required to complete Painimation, , the SCSES, PROMIS, ASCQ -ME, PHQ -9, and GAD -7 questionnaire s 
at baseline,  3-, 6-, and 12 -month time points , as well as the COMM at baseline and 12 -month follow -up. Failure to 
complete any of these will prompt health coaches to reach out via text message or phone to encourage 
participan ts to complete missing items. The qualitative interview delivered by [CONTACT_635565]. Since only 48  of the 350 participants will be selected for interview,  any participant that 
opts out will be replaced  by [CONTACT_85544], of those not previously selected.   
  
The principal investigators or study staff will review all data collection forms on a quarterly basis for 
data  completeness and accuracy as well as protocol compliance. Data on adherence to the treatment protocol will 
be collected twice weekly by [CONTACT_635566]. Adherence of the  research 
participants to the cCBT sessions and education modules will be evaluated by [CONTACT_635567]. If adherence falls below the suggested  rate of 50%, which 
might  inhibit the ability of the study to test its primary hypotheses, the PIs will suggest a conference call  for study 
investigators to discuss methods for improving adherence. The principal investigators, co -investigators, and  the 
research staff will meet on a monthly interval to re -evaluate study goals, subject recruitment, data coding 
and retention, documentation and identification of adverse events, complaints, and confidentiality of subjects. 
Progress of the research study will be evaluated, including assessments of data quality, timelines, 
participant  recruitment, accrual, and retention. If recruitment is below 50% within the first [ADDRESS_849088] of the study according  to 
the reporting criteria and timelines under the current IRB policies.

7 STUDY INTERVENTION/EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION DISCONTINUATION AND 
PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL  
7.1 DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION/EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  
Semi -annually , the DCC and Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) will review of collected data (including adverse 
events, unanticipated problems, and subject withdrawals), to determine whether there is a change to the 
anticipated benefit -to-risk assessment of study participation and whether the study should continue as orig inally 
designed, should be changed, or should be terminated.   
7.2 PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY  
 
A participant may be discontinued from study treatment at any time if the participant or the investigator feels that 
it is not in the participant’s best interest to continue.  The following is a list of possible reasons for study treatment 
discontinuation:  
 
• Participant withdrawal of consent (or assent)  
• Participant is not compliant with study procedures  
• Adverse event that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_635504]  
• Protocol violation requiring discontinuation of study treatment  
• Lost to follow -up 
 
If a participant is withdrawn from treatment due to an adverse event, the participant will be followed and treated 
by [CONTACT_635568].   
All participants who discontinue study treatment should come in for an early discontinuation visit as soon as 
possible and will be encouraged to complete all remaining scheduled assessments (Pain Interference measure will 
be prioritized) . 
All participants are free to withdraw from participation at any time, for any reason, specified or unspecified, and 
without prejudice.  
Reasonable attempts will be made by [CONTACT_635569] a reason for participant withdrawals. The 
reason for the participant’s withdrawal from the study will be specified in the participant’s source documents.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_849089] TO FOLLOW -UP 
Intervention engagement and health coach contacts.  Patients who stop reporting data in the intervention  will 
receive inquiry text messages or a phone call  (Health Coach Protocol) . Since participation in the study is completely 
voluntary , patients may choose to discontinue the intervention  at any time . During the first [ADDRESS_849090] enrollment in the study ; however , health coaches will reach out three times to solicit a text, 
email, or phone call response from participants.  
 
 
 
Follow -up assessments.  The study sites will take preventive measures to avoid a subject’s being lost to follow -up 
(e.g., document different ways of contact [CONTACT_461649], email address, etc.). At baseline, 3 -, 6-, and 
12-month time points participants will receive li nks to complete Painimation, the SCSES, PROMIS, ASCQ -ME, PHQ -
9, and GAD -7 on our online survey tool; COMM questionnaires will be sent at baseline and 12 months ( See Section 
4.1 Overall Design for schedule breakdown ). Completion of the  questionnaires is a required component of the 
study. Not completing questionnaires within [ADDRESS_849091] to follow -up (LTF). The site should document all attempts and LTF information in the trial 
database (see Table 9 ).

We will minimize missing data by [CONTACT_2363] a paperless data collection system and by [CONTACT_635571] a timely fashion. We will attempt to characterize the mechanism of missingness (missing 
completely at random, missing at random, or not missing at random) by [CONTACT_635572]/attrition 
between study arms. Additionally, we will compare baseline characteristics between participants with and without 
missing out come data. If we conclude that our missingness is rand om, then our likelihood -based approach for the 
primary analyses will address this. Otherwise, if the missingness can be characterized as non -ignorable (not missing 
at random), we will use approaches such as joint modeling or shared parameter models to prod uce unbiased 
estimates of treatment effects. All reasons for dropout or other missing values will be entered by [CONTACT_635573] (if encountering the patient using  community activities), tabulated and summarized , and results 
will be repor ted using the CONSORT diagram .  
 
 
 
 
[ADDRESS_849092] year of the study.  
 
1. Eligibility Screener: All patients interested in enrolling will be required to complete this online screener to 
confirm eligibility. It will be accessible at the five clinics  for those recruited in -person. A link will be 
distributed to those recruited online . 
2. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_100779] ( CSQ): Assesses  copi[INVESTIGATOR_635505] -level factor 
analysis.  Elements of the CSQ will be asked in the chatbot.  
3. Sickle Cell Self -Efficacy Scale (SCSES): Assesses the ability of sickle cell patients to function on a day -to-day 
basis and manage their SCD symptoms . 
4. Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System ( PROMIS ) Pain Interference Scale:  
Assesses patient -reported outcomes (physical, mental, and social health) in adults and children  
5. Adults Sickle Cell Quality of Life Measurement Information System ( ASCQ -ME): Measure patient reported 
outcomes in adults with sickle cell disease . 
6. Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ -9): Assesses the degree of depression severity . 
7. Generalized Anxiety Dieorder Scale (GAD -7): Assess the degree of anxiety.  
8. Daily pain diary: Participants will log a daily pain diary in the CaRISMA interventions for the entire year of 
the study.  
9. Current Opi[INVESTIGATOR_85581] (COMM): self -reported; monitors indicators of current aberrant drug -
related behaviors in patients with chronic pain on opi[INVESTIGATOR_2538]. This measure will only be completed at 
baseline and 12 months.  
10. Painimation:  an electronic pain assessment tool developed by [CONTACT_635541][INVESTIGATOR_635487]. Patients are provided with a selection of 
animations  that they use to describe the quality of their pain. The animations can be  adjusted  to reflect 
the intensity of their pain.  
 
8.2 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
 
The PHQ -9 administered at baseline, 3 -, 6-, and 12 -month time points will be used to assess suicide risk. A positive 
answer to a PHQ -9 question “Over the last [ADDRESS_849093]?” will trigger the Scale for Suicide Ideation questionnaire developed to determine the 
level of immediate suicide risk. Individuals who are n ot affiliated with one of the participating clinical sites and are 
completing the Web questionnaires will only r eceive the PHQ -8 and will not be assessed for suicidality.  
To read more about this risk management protocol, go to  Section  2.3.3. Assessment  of Potential Risks and 
Benefits . 
 
 
 
8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
The following definitions are taken directly from Rozental et al 2014 , which addresses Internet interventions , and 
Linden 2013 , which discusses the negative effects in face -to-face behavioral treatment.  
 
Deterioration   **detail here, only mentioned in passing in 5.13 osiris**  Items marked *** below  not in osiris  
Deterioration is defined as worsening of target symptoms and monitored by a validated outcome measure or 
behavioral measure, i.e., an increase of  symptom severity, or increased frequency of intrusive thoughts. In order to 
distinguish temporary from enduring deterioration, we will rely on consecutive measures and follow -up. Weekly 
check -ins by [CONTACT_635574], e.g. “Do you feel like  your pain or mood is worsening?”, 
administration of the PHQ -9 or the numerical pain scale. The health coaches will be trained to assess for 
negative/intrusive thoughts. T he PHQ and pain scale will be administered post -treatment at [ADDRESS_849094] alert 
threshold will be determined based on baseline distribution of stu dy data.  
 
Adverse events  
Adverse events (AEs) consist of negative events probably emerging from treatment and perceived as adverse by 
[CONTACT_102], causing deterioration of target symptoms and/or negative experiences that extend beyond the 
completion of treatment, e.g., increased anxiety during cogniti ve behavioral therapy training, or being 
embarrassed by [CONTACT_635575]. Adverse events could reveal 
negative effects that are directly attributable to treatment, providing our team and other researchers with 
information on possible mechanisms underlying negative effects. During treatment, the health coaches will 
routinely assess for increasing negative affect. Post -treatment, the GAD -7 will be administered at 3, 6 , and 12 
months to assess for increasing anxiety.  
 
** In Osiris 5.13 , also unexpected problems (UPs), medical monitor, timing of reporting .** 
  
Severe adverse events    
Severe adverse events (SAEs) are negative events that occur during treatment and result in deterioration of target 
symptoms and/or adverse reactions requiring some form of high -intensity treatment. In this study, we are 
primarily identifying severe adverse events as deliberate  self-harm, and  suicidal ideation  or attempts. Because of 
the risks involved, we will closely monitor, document, and report self -harm and suicide related behaviors (ideation 
or attempts) regardless if they are deemed related to treatment or not.  
 
**Next 4 topi[INVESTIGATOR_635506]**  
Novel symptoms  
Novel symptoms consist of the emergence of new psychological symptoms, unrelated to the symptoms targeted in 
treatment, which may or may not be associated with treatment, e.g., occurrence of insomnia during treatment of 
social anxiety, or decreased self -esteem during treatment of panic disorder. Similar to adverse events, novel 
symptoms could provide valuable information on negative effects that would otherwise go unnoticed, but differs 
from adverse events as novel symptoms should be unrelated to the sympto ms targeted in treatment.  
 
Dropout  
 
 
Dropout concerns the number of patients choosing to end treatment prematurely. Early termination can be 
related to deterioration of target symptoms, nonresponse, and/or experiencing adverse events, presumably 
related to treatment, e.g., increase in symptom  severity, or  demoralization. It may also be that dropout was 
related to a decrease in symptom severity, i.e., some patients might experience relief after a short period of time, 
perceiving more treatment as redundant. When feasible, we will make every eff ort to contact [CONTACT_635576]/or electronic survey to determine the reason for dropout or discontinuation of the intervention.  
 
Nonresponse  
Nonresponse is characterized by [CONTACT_96101] a predicted positive effect on target symptoms, possibly attributable 
to treatment, resulting in status quo, demoralization , and discouragement to seek help elsewhere, i.e., absence of 
any treatment effect. Nonresponse in the first 3 months will be assessed by [CONTACT_6288], e.g. “To what extent 
do you feel like your symptoms have improved over the past 4 weeks of this progr am?” In the context of 
nonresponse, the health coach will work with the participant to e xplore the reason for and characteristics of the 
nonresponse, i.e., some patients might have deteriorated without treatment, or external factors might be 
responsible for the nonresponse, e.g.,  bereavement, or other psychosocial stressors. Potential factors contributing 
to nonresponse will be recorded in health coach case report forms. Nonresponse will also be assessed on 
quantitative measures at the [ADDRESS_849095] with 
the health coach at this p oint, we will not make any effort to assess of the reason for and characteristics of 
nonresponse.  
 
Unwanted events  
Unwanted events are defined as all events experienced as negative by [CONTACT_542923], which may or 
may not be related to the interventions being used, and does not necessarily influence treatment outcome, e.g., 
issues related to the treatment content, increased anxiety during exposure in vivo, and frustration caused by 
[CONTACT_635577]. Anxiety will be measured at regular follow -up points (3, 6, 12 months). Reported technical 
difficulties and our response to those technical difficulties will be recorded.  
 
 
 
9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES  
State the formal and testable null and alternative hypotheses for primary and key secondary endpoints, 
specifying the type of analysis (e.g., feasibility/acceptability, efficacy, effectiveness, implementation) and 
time period for which each endpoint will be analyzed. Include this information for each hypothesis being 
tested, if multiple hypotheses are present. If the study is int ended as a feasibility or pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], please 
consider that a formal hypothesis may not be available at the time of protocol writing. If so, include a 
statement indicating that hypotheses will be generated or that descriptive statistics only will be calcul ated.  
• Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s): Pain interference  
H0: 6-month change in pain interference will not differ between the two intervention arms  
H1: 6-month change in pain interference will differ between the two intervention arms  
• Secondary Efficacy Endpoint(s): Pain intensity, depressive symptoms,  health care utilization (opi[INVESTIGATOR_611779], acute care visits) and opi[INVESTIGATOR_200624] (Current Opi[INVESTIGATOR_85581] – COMM)  
9.[ADDRESS_849096] of comparative effectiveness of cCBT vs. m -Education for the trial, the power 
calculation is based on the comparison of intervention groups for the main outcome of change in daily pain 
intensity; the effect size we are powered for al so applies to the key secondary outcomes: pain interference and 
depression (PHQ -9). Specifically, we have 80% power to detect a difference of 0.[ADDRESS_849097] deviations between 
study arms on 6 -month changes in the outcome. Additionally, we are accountin g for 15% attrition at 6 months.  
 
Aim 2.  For the tests of interactions, we will identify baseline depressive symptom subgroups with either low or 
high depression (PHQ ≤ 10 versus PHQ > 10). In order to detect small -moderated effect sizes (similar to the main 
effect in Aim 1) for the HTE, we woul d need approximately four times as many participants as we do for Aim 1 
(N=1400). Median trial size in SCD is 142; less than 50% of trials meet >90% of their recruitment target .67 Thus, 
achieving the required sample size would not be feasible; however, when combined with our qualitative data, the 
quantitative data from Aim [ADDRESS_849098] deviations for continuous variables, and sample proportions 
for categorical variables. Medi an and inter -quartile range values will accompany continuous variables that are non -
normal. Results will be presented for the entire sample and stratified by [CONTACT_105150]. We will assess between -
arm imbalance of baseline covariates by [CONTACT_635578]. For continuous variables, we 
will assess normality by [CONTACT_635579] a normal probability plot. Transformations 
will be implemented if required.  
9.4.2 ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT(S)  
 We will employ linear mixed models for the primary outcome of pain intensity and the secondary outcome of pain 
interference (Hypothesis 1) as a function of time, study arm (cCBT vs. m -Education), time -by-study arm interaction, 
study site, and baseline depr ession level (PHQ -9 ≤ 10 vs. PHQ -9 > 10). We will account for multiple observations for 
each participant by [INVESTIGATOR_3086] a random effect for subject. Additionally, baseline variables with large clinically 
meaningful between -arm differences will be included a s covariates. Contrasts will be estimated to assess the 
impact of cCBT and m -Education intervention on 6month improvements in pain. As a secondary investigation, we 
will use the same linear mixed models to address whether the 6 -month improvements are susta inable to 12 
months.  
 
We will answer Hypothesis 2 using a similar analytic strategy. Depression (PHQ -9) will be modeled as a function of 
time, study arm, time -by-study arm interaction, and study site. We will account for multiple observations for 
participant by [INVESTIGATOR_3086] a random effect for each subject.  
 
Healthcare utilization (Hypothesis 3) will be compared between study arms using generalized linear models to 
account for count data (i.e., Poisson regression) for each of the following: the number of opi[INVESTIGATOR_75155], 
number of ED visits, and number of  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149701] [ADDRESS_849099] study entry. Predictors will include study 
arm, study site, and baseline depression level. The corresponding health care utilization in 12 months prior to 
study entry will be entered as a covariate in each model. We wi ll offset each model by [CONTACT_3445]’s time on the 
study . 
9.4.3 ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S)  
 
Qualitative Analysis for Aim [ADDRESS_849100]. Megan Hamm and the Qualitative, Evaluation and Stakeholder 
Engagement Research Services (Qual  EASE) in the Data Center of the Center for Research on Health Care at Pi[INVESTIGATOR_32887]. [CONTACT_635593] will review interview scripts in conjunction with the rest of the study team to ensure that all relevant topi[INVESTIGATOR_284560], and Qual  EASE staff will conduct pi[INVESTIGATOR_635507]. Experienced Qual EASE interviewers will be 
trained in the scripts, and will conduct the telephonic interviews with [CONTACT_635594]’s supervision.  
 
Analysis of the interviews will combine thematic analysis and constant comparison method. Codes will be 
developed via open coding of the transcripts to determine topi[INVESTIGATOR_635508], but input on topi[INVESTIGATOR_635509] t the study team anticipates being relevant will also be solicited, 
 
 
resulting in simultaneously inductive and deductive development of the codebook. Once the codebook has been 
finaliz ed, two data analysts from Qual  EASE will be trained in the use of the codebook, following which both coders 
will independently code 25% of transcripts. Coding will then be compared for the purposes of calculating Cohen’s 
Kappa Inter -Coder Reliability scores. Any coding discrepancies ide ntified during this comparison will be adjudicated 
until full agreement is achieved. After satisfactory inter coder reliability (Cohen’s Kappa >0.6) is achieved, the 
primary coder will code the remaining transcripts. The completed coding will form the basis of a thematic analysis 
of the data, as well as a constant comparative analysis to compare the experience of patients by [CONTACT_635580]. 
Analyses will be conducted by [CONTACT_635581]. Hamm.  
 
9.4. 4 PLANNED INTERIM ANALYSES  
 N/A. Analysis will be conducted at the end of month 12 after the study is complete.  
 
9.4.5 ADDRESSING MISSING DATA  
 
Addressing missing data: We will minimize missing data by [CONTACT_2363] a paperless data collection system and by 
[CONTACT_635582] a timely fashion. We will attempt to characterize the 
mechanism of missingness (missing complete ly at random, missing at random, or not missing at random) by 
[CONTACT_635572]/attrition between study arms. Additionally, we will compare baseline 
characteristics between participants with and without missing outcome data. If we conclude tha t our missingness 
is random, then our likelihood -based approach for the primary analyses will address this. Otherwise, if the 
missingness can be characterized as non -ignorable (not missing at random), we will use approaches such as joint 
modeling or shared  parameter models to produce unbiased estimates of treatment effects. All reasons for dropout 
or other missing values will be entered by [CONTACT_635583] (if encountering the patient during 
community activities), tabulated and summarized,  and results will be reported using the Consolidated Standards of 
Reporting Trials (CONSORT) diagram. Patients who stop reporting data in the app will receive inquiry text messages 
or a phone call.  
 
9.4.[ADDRESS_849101] (HTE), is to determine whether the 
intervention works better for some than for others. We again pre -specify our analysis plan and will examine 
differences in main outcomes for patients wit h high (PHQ -9 > 10) versus low (PHQ -9 ≤ 10) depression. These 
subgroups are most relevant so that end results can meaningfully inform patients about what works best for 
whom, and in turn, better support individuals as they seek treatment for pain. Furtherm ore, in examining 
differential impact of the interventions, based on these subgroups, providers, payers, and other decision makers 
can target resources in a manner that best meets the needs of those in need of services, reduces variations in 
practice, and improves health outcomes. We will augment the primary analysis models for pain intensity with 
relevant main effects for baseline depression level, and [ADDRESS_849102] interaction (time -by-study arm -by-baseline depression level). 
If significant, we will present treatment effect estimates and measures of variability in the form of confidence 
intervals within each subgroup. Two -sided tests of level 0.[ADDRESS_849103] two -sided tests to be conservative. For all of the above 
described models, we will focus on the 6 -month outcome.  
9.4.9 EXPLORATORY ANALYSES  
  
Change in scores from baseline to 3  months and from baseline to 6  months, for copi[INVESTIGATOR_25196] -
efficacy, and program engagement/dose measures, will be tested as potential mediating variables. We 
will use the framework of Kraemer et al.  [ADDRESS_849104], evaluation, and documentation of this study, 
are designed to ensure that the investigator abide by [CONTACT_23663] (GCP) guidelines and under the guiding 
principles detailed in the Declaration of Helsinki.  The study will also be carried out in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_23577](s) and regulation(s).  
The CaRISMA trial will rely primarily on the review of the IRB, University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_380962], while establishing an agreement that all site -specific IRBs will review their informed consent documents to 
ensure local concerns are  adequately addressed.  
Documented approval from appropriate independent ethics committees (IEC)/IRBs will be obtained for all 
participating centers before start of the study, according to GCP, local laws, regulations, and organizations. When 
necessary, an extension, amendment, o r renewal of the IEC/IRB approval must be obtained and also forwarded to 
the Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC).  
Strict adherence to all specifications laid down in this protocol is required for all aspects of study conduct; the 
investigator may not modify or alter the procedures described in this protocol.  
Modifications to the study protocol will not be implemented by [CONTACT_635584].  However, the investigator may implement a deviation from, or a change of, the protocol to eliminate 
an immediate hazard(s) to the trial patients without prior IEC/IRB approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649].  As soon as possible, 
the implemented deviation or change, the reasons for it and if appropriate the proposed protocol change should 
be submitted to the IEC/IRB, to the CCC and through the CaRI SMA  data capture system.  Any deviations from the 
protocol must be explained and documented by [CONTACT_093].  
The co-principal investigators are  responsible for the conduct of the clinical trial at the site in accordance with Title 
21 of the Code of Federal Regulations and/or the Declaration of Helsinki.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_635510].  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_635511], including sub -investigators and other study staff members, adhere to the study protocol and all 
GCP guidelines regarding clinical trials both during and after  study completion.  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_635512].  
 
10.1.[ADDRESS_849105] provide informed 
consent. Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in the study 
and continues throughout t he individual’s study participation. The consent process will occur over the Internet and 
is self -guided. Potential participants can access the consent website via their own electronic device or in the 
clinical setting via a tablet computer  station  (kiosk ). A video presentation will explain the study to the potential 
participants in a language understandable to participants, providing all pertinent information (purpose, 
procedures, risks, benefits, alternatives to participation, etc.). Additionally, the mos t pertinent consent language 
will be presented on separate web pages where the user must click a button indicating acknowledgment and 
 
 
understanding of the content to advance to the next screen. Each segment of the consent is presented in concise, 
easy to understand and clear language. Finally, the full consent document will be presented in PDF form on screen 
for the potential participant  to read in its entirety. Note that potential participants are not expected to read the 
full consent document. All of the information contained in the consent document is explained via the video and 
website click -through process. The consent form and video  will be available in English only.  
In the clinical setting, staff will be available to potential participants to explain the study verbally, and to answer 
questions and clarify understanding of the study.  For potential participants that are accessing the consent website 
outside of the clinical setting, a method for contact[CONTACT_635585]. Upon reviewing all 
materials, the user will be given adequate opportunity to consider all options. Once the potential participant 
indicates they are interested in participating in the study, they will be asked a series of question to test 
comprehension and recall of the information presented . The qu estions presented will address important facts 
about study participation to confirm the potential participant’s understanding of the study procedures. Only if all 
questions are answered correctly will  the potential participant  be permitted to proceed to the consent process. 
Every effort will be made to ensure that participants have comprehended the study information prior to obtaining 
participant's voluntary agreement to participate.  
In addition, older potential participants whose competency to consent is in question will be tested for sufficient 
comprehension and recall of the information presented. Prospective participants who do not remember the 
important facts about participation i n the research study after repeated testing will not be included in the study.  
The informed consent document and explainer video will include the following General Data Protection Regulation 
(GDPR) -compliant consent information and language:  
• The identity of the Principal Investigator;  
• The purpose of data collection;  
• The types of data collected;  
• The right to withdraw from the research and the mechanism for withdrawal;  
• Who will have access to the data;  
• Information regarding automated processing of data for decision making about the individual;  
• Information regarding data security, including storage and transfer of data;  
• How long data will be stored;  
• Whether and under what conditions data may be used for future research.  
Before a signature [CONTACT_635586], the participant will be reminded that participation is 
completely voluntary and that they may withdraw at ANY time during the study time without any disadvantage 
and without having to provide any reasons for this decision. Participants will receive a copy of the informed 
consent form , electronically via email or text message, as a signed PDF document.  
Consent records, including time and date of consent, will be maintained for each subject. We will ensure that 
security measures are in place to protect information from unauthorized access and damage. We will implement 
technical and organizational security  measures to protect personal data, including encryption, redundancy, backup 
and security testing. There will also be breach notification requirements.  
During the course of the study, participants will be provided with any new information that arises ( e.g., new study 
procedure, change in risk/benefit profile) that may affect a participant's decision whether or not to continue 
participation in the study. Participants who have already signed consent will be presented with a revised consent 
 
 
form with the new study procedures and/or what has changed since they last provided consent. A copy of the 
revised consent will be given to the participants for their records.  
10.1.2 STUDY DISCONTINUATION AND CLOSURE  
If this study is prematurely terminated or temporarily suspended, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_635513], the IRB, and sponsor/funding agency and provide the reason(s) for the termination or temporary 
suspension. Section 7, Study Interventi on/Experimental Manipulation Discontinuation and Participant 
Discontinuation/Withdrawal, describes handling of consented/enrolled study participants in the event the study is 
prematurely terminated.

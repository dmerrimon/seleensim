5.  SUMMARIZE THE RESEARCH.  In LAY LANGUAGE , summarize the objectives and 
significance of the research.  
 
Rates of alcohol and illicit drug use (AIDU) among residents of distressed communities with 
concentrations of African Americans (DCAA - i.e., localities with high rates of poverty and crime) are 
similar to the general popu lation. Yet AIDU has significantly higher consequences for residents in 
DCAAs (e.g., higher incarceration and HIV/HCV infection rates), who also have considerably less access to effective treatment of substance use disorders. This project will continue to develop and test Community Wise , an innovative multi-level intervention created in partnership with service providers, 
residents of DCAAs and individuals with histories of substance use disorders and incarceration, to reduce health inequalities related to AIDU. We used community- based participatory research (CBPR) 
to develop and pi[INVESTIGATOR_665856], achieving 75% intervention completion rates, despi[INVESTIGATOR_665857] (such as homelessness, AIDU, and poverty). Note that substance use disor der 
intervention completion rates in the literature are much lower among populations with fewer challenges (often 30 to 40%). We believe that this success is due to the CBPR model used to develop an intervention that is relevant to participants’ needs.  
  
Community Wise  addresses social determinants of health (e.g., stigma, poverty, lack of treatment 
access, housing, and meaningful employment) and inequalities related to AIDU at the micro level (e.g., cognitive and behavioral processes), meso level (e.g., relationships with individuals and organizations) and macro level (e.g., political and cultural processes). Community Wise  builds on 
critical consciousness theory, which empowers individuals, organizations, and communities to address 
social determinants of health while changing individual behaviors (e.g., reducing AIDU). We propose

 to apply the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) - an innovative and rigorous framework that 
employs factorial designs - to optimize Community Wise. Specifically, using MOST w e will identify 
the most efficient, scalable, and sustainable components of Community Wise so that we can refine the 
intervention protocol by [CONTACT_665887]. The long -term 
goal of Community Wise  is to reduce health  inequalities related to AIDU between men with substance 
use disorders and a history of incarceration residing in DCAAs and the general population through an 
intervention that is congruent with DCAA world views and grounded in scientific and indigenous knowledge. Data from this study will culminate in an optimized Community Wise manual; enhanced 
methodological strategies to develop multi-component scalable interventions using MOST and CBPR; and a better understanding of the application of critical consciousness theory to the field of health inequalities related to AIDU.

To avoid possible violations of confidentiality, project staff are traine d to carefully follow detailed 
procedures designed to assure that no information about any participant (or others they may mention) 
will be given to law enforcement, other government agencies, or anyone but research staff.  Every member of the research team and all N ewark Community Collaborative B oard (NCCB)  members will 
be required to undergo human subject protection training and provide a certificate of completion to the IRB prior to any contact [CONTACT_80414]. Standards of confidentiality include the use of code numbers and code names for participants and other individuals they may mention. The only place participants’ names or other identifying information will appear is on informed consent forms and locator forms (used for follow- up interviews after the baseline). These forms will be kept 
electronically in box, in a folder separate from the data. Only full time, trained staff in the project 
including the outreach works, group facilitators, PD and PIs will have access to these files. Peer facilitator and licensed facilitator will not have access to data from the individuals that are randomized 
into their groups.

informatio n and available only to project staff. This helps to ensure that no identifying information 
will be disclosed in the unlikely event that computerized data are stolen or otherwise seen by [CONTACT_35532].) All identifying electronic data will be destro yed immediately after data 
analysis is completed. Signed consent forms will be kept for [ADDRESS_899321] 
recordings of their interview des troyed by [CONTACT_3379]/e -mailing one of the Principal Investigators at the

However, if we have reason to believe that any of these recordings contain information that can put any of our participants in danger of being hurt or being incarcerated, we will destroy the recording.   Our interviewers are trained to watch participants carefully and will stop questioning if an individual appears uneasy. At every interview, participants will be informed that they may ask the interviewer to stop if they are feeling uncomfortable. Referrals to counselors are available if participants wish and trained clinical counselors are available at NJCRI  in the event that s omeone may need immediate 
assistance, whether it is during data collection or during the intervention sessions.   [CONTACT_41214], [CONTACT_41215], and project director  will be available by [CONTACT_665889]. Any adverse event will be r eported to the IRB and funding agency within [ADDRESS_899322] excellent relationships with the community, including community members and agencies that we can mobilize in case the need arises (e.g., access to providers that provide detox and emergency services, legal support clinic at Rutgers University, Newark campus, community members who learned from participants about their engagement in the study may reach out to us for help in case they know one of our participants may be in trouble).  In addition to this extensive network, we will collect data during the baseline and follow-up assessments to monitor participant safety. For instance, we will conduct the MINI suicidality screen and if we find anyone at risk, we will have the appropriate group clinician reach out to the participant individually and make sure they are linked to the mental health services they need.  Finally, the research team and the clinical team will engage in weekly project meetings to discuss the 
progress of the study and identify, discuss, and address any potential issues.

IRB-1 04/08/[ADDRESS_899323] (NCCB). All 
NCCB members are also research participants because NCCB meetings are recorded and board 
members complete an anonymous annual survey, both to monitor the study for compliance with principles of community- based participatory research and satisfaction. No NCCB member will be a 
participant in the Community Wise  clinical trial. N o NCCB member except the project director and the 
principal investigators, will have access to any identifying information about participants.  
The NCCB is a diverse group of service providers, consumers of substance abuse treatment, individuals with a history of incarceration, researchers, and government employees who work together to improve health conditions in the City of Newark, NJ. The NCCB developed and pi[INVESTIGATOR_665858]. At this time we h ave a total of 
15 members. Anyone can apply to become a NCCB member at any time. Since the NCCB will oversee the research (e.g., recruitments, data collections, analysis, dissemination) all members are required to complete the CITI training prior to engaging in any study activities.  
 NCCB members bring a variety of skills to the table. Together, the NCCB is the overall directing 
body or the research, but outside of monthly meetings to get a big pi[INVESTIGATOR_665859], it will function through sub- committees. All activities are voluntary  (meaning no one is required to 
participate i n any given activity). Subcommittees are formed to conduct specific and time limited 
research tasks. Membership in subcommittees is based on individual members’ skills and interest in participating. For instance, clinical screening for the clinical trial requires that screeners have clinical training at the master level. Hence, only NCCB members who are clinicians are eligible to join the clinical scr eening sub- committee. In the event that NCCB clinicians are not interested in conducting 
clinical trial screens, we can hire and train outside clinicians to perform that task. Thus, NCCB members participate in all aspects of the research ; however, not ever y NCCB member participates in 
every task. This is done on a case by [CONTACT_665891].  
 
Our clinical trial participants will be recruited from various venues in the community and using a 
variety of approaches. We will post fliers at reentry, substance abuse, and HIV/HCV service agencies throughout the community (e.g., Integrity House; La Casa de Don Pedro; NJCR I). Individual service 
providers and Community Wise  alumni will be asked to help disseminate information about the study 
by [CONTACT_665892] . These agencies and 
Community Wise alumni will not engage in recruitment; they will simply distribute fliers about the study.   We will train the partner agency staff not to answer any questions that their clients may have 
about the study. We will provide them with the partner agency flier dissemination instructio n sheet so 
that they can help us avoid potential coercion. We will pay NCCB members $[ADDRESS_899324]

 potential study participants which will in clude conducting the phone screen, and scheduling the 
clinical screen, the orientation session, and the baseline.  
 
In addition, research staff will encourage potential participants to help distribute the study’s fliers in 
their neighborhoods, churches and other meeting places. Men interested in participating will call the study’s cell phone number to receive information about the study. A trained master’s level clinician  
will conduct a brief phone screening to obtain self- reported eligibility information including substance 
use disorder, date of last prison release, age and contact [CONTACT_3031]. Those meeting phone screening eligibility will be invited to complete the clinical screen. Those meeting the clinical screen eligibility criteria (see below) will be  consented into the study. In this process we will explain the randomization 
process, the study risks and benefits, what we will ask them to do and their rights as research participants. Those consenting will be randomized into one of the eight experimental conditions.  
 It is possible the NCCB members may know some of the potential clinical trial participants as these 
individuals live and work in Newark, NJ. Potential clinical trial participants may be clients, family 
members, or a friend of any NCCB member. The standard protocol for such situations is to ensure that 
any NCCB member or staff person who has a personal relationship with a potential participant does not recruit or interact with that person in an y capacity as part of the study. This is acknowledged in the 
NCCB informed consent which will be signed by [CONTACT_665893].  
 
NJCRI  will be the main recruitment and performance site where experimental groups will run and all 
data will be collected. NJCRI has been our partner for over 6 years and it has served as a site for the 
intervention during our pi[INVESTIGATOR_48124]. NJCRI is New Jersey’s largest and most comprehensive HIV/AIDS community -based organization.  NJCRI’s mission  is “to help people with HIV/AIDS and 
those at risk for HIV/AIDS.” NJCRI conducts state- wide HIV clinical trials, and HIV treatment, care 
and prevention services in the Greater Newark Area.  Populations served include youth and adults, men and women, men who have sex with men, people who acquire or who are at risk for HIV through injection drug use, and others. NJCRI also seeks to address the concerns and disparities of access to health care faced by [CONTACT_522509].  Some of the non- HIV related services offered include 
behavioral research, chronic illness management education, street out reach, substance abuse 
treatment, transportation, food pantry, and technical assistance to other community- based 
organizations.  Approximately 5,000 people avail themselves of NJCRI’s free and confidential services each year. NJCRI is located in a predominantly low- income African -American neighborhood 
in Newark, NJ. Another advantage of partnering with NJCRI is that they offer HIV/STDs counseling, testing and referrals services at no charge to people in the community. They house [ADDRESS_899325] access to information about who enrolled and who did not enroll unless 
the participant chooses to disclose this information themselves.

 Women represent only 6% of the populations being released f rom incarceration in Essex County , NJ. 
Therefore, unless we expanded the study to additional sites (which is unrealistic given the budgetary 
constraints), recruiting enough women would not be feasible. We discussed this challenge at our NCCB meeting and co llaboratively made the difficult decision to exclude women from the current 
study. Once the intervention is optimized using a male sample, we will be in a better position to design a larger, multi- site study where we will be able to adapt and test the inte rvention with women.   
 
 We do not anticipate that we will have enough power to conduct significant racial comparisons as we expect that approximately 80% of our sample will be African American. We will, however, conduct valid analysis and explore potential moderation effects on the AIDU outcome to inform planning of future studies that could adapt Community Wise  for use with other populations.  
 Women currently make up the majority of the NCCB. The NCCB is racially diverse with African Americans, Latinos, and Whites represented. The only female participants in the study will be 
members of the NCCB.  
 Participants in this study are not expected to be under custody, court order to attend the treatment, or 
any form of limited civil freedom; thus this is not part of the inclusion or exclusion criteria. No 
research will be conducted with any subject who becomes incarcerated after enrollment until a research amendment discussing the specific procedures of access to the facility is filed and 
approved by [CONTACT_1201].  
Master or doctoral level social workers or psychologists will conduct the clinical screens to assess 
participant eligibility. All recruitment will take place at Integrity House. Staff will be supervised by [CONTACT_349493]-investigator project director and the PI [CONTACT_41212].  Inclusion criteria for the factorial experiment participants in the study will include:  
• Men age 18 or older 
• Residence in Essex County , NJ 
• Willingness to be voice recorded  during group sessions 
• Ability to speak English

We will use a screening script and a signed consent form to obtain permission to conduct the 
screening and use the data as part of the study, regardless of establishment of final eligibility. Participants will be informed that the information will be confidential and they can choose to stop participating at any time and we will destroy their data upon receiving their request.  Note that voice 
recordings of Community Wise are exceptions as this will include data from entire groups of participants. We will only destroy voice recordings if there is reason to believe the recording has 
content that can put participants in danger of being hurt or re -incarcerated.

the participants (treatment groups and controls) will do and where the research activities will take place. Give approximate dates and durations for specific activities, including the total number of treatments, visits, or meetings required and the total time commitment.  
(For schools- based research where class time is used, describe in detail the activities planned for 
nonparticipants and explain where ( e.g., in a classroom, in a private area) both participants and 
nonparticipants will be located during the research activities. Include a concise description of procedures, locations, time commitments, and alternate activities on the relevant consent and assent forms. ) 
All research activities will take place at NJCRI . Drug screening will take place at baseline and 
follow-up assessments conducted by [CONTACT_665897] . 
Participants will be told by [CONTACT_665898] a right to refuse to complete the drug screen and that results will not be shared with staff at NJCRI . Results will be used to enhance the rigor of the 
study as an added source of information about drug use.  
 Intervention groups will be held at NJCRI. The research team is being hired through NJCRI and will have offices in the building. [CONTACT_666004] and [CONTACT_666005] will be the contact [CONTACT_665899]. NJCRI will provide the research team with an office space for each project full time employee (project director, outreach worker, and group facilitators) in addition to conference rooms where the research groups will take place.   The project  applies community based participatory research (CBPR) principles to the multiphase 
optimization strategy (MOST) framework in implementing a 2x2x2 factorial design in which 592 
men with substance use disorders and a history of incarceration residing in Essex County , NJ will be

This is designed to give participants tools to assess their own thinking and hence, their assumptions that may contribute to substance use; 
 
Critical Dialogue  consists of group conversations prompted by [CONTACT_665902]. It aims to help 
participants develop a deeper understanding of how marginalizing processes (e.g., systematic stigma; feelings of rage as victims of discrimination) impact their lives and behavio r;  
 
Quality -of-Life-Wheel  consists of individual and group exercises to develop individual goals. It 
aims to increase self -efficacy and help participants develop a vision for their future, breaking this 
vision down into small, feasible, measureable goals they can implement on a weekly basis (e.g. quitting smoking, improving relationships with family members, paying down debt);

Measures:  
 
Clinical Screen: Mini Mental State Exam, MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview 6 psychoticism and suicidality modules, and the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs- Substance 
Problem Scale (GAIN -SPS).  
 
Baseline and follow-ups: Timeline Follow Back to measure drug use, a urine  toxicology screen, the 
Crime and Violence Scale (part of the GAIN scale), the States of Engaged Awareness about Health Inequalities (SEAH I-unpublished and developed by [CONTACT_3019]- see baseline and follow -up packet) . The 
SEAHI will be administered through the computer along will all the other measures.  During the 
baseline assessment, we will ask participants permission to take a digital photograph of them during the baseline to assist with finding them during follow -ups.  The photo will be in the master file 
along with the name [CONTACT_420640], but not linked to any data. Photographs will be used by [CONTACT_665907] 5. Participants will have the option to refuse without penalty and they may ask us to destroy their photo at any time during the study.  
 Additional follow- up measures:  Use of Treatment Skills  measure to track participants’ use of 
specific tools learned; measures of participants’ perceptions of helpful intervention components, and the Treatment Service Review.  
 A trained research assistant (most likely a MSW student) will schedule the data collection with up to 
eight  participants at a time.  Participants will be asked to take a urine collection sterile cup when 
they are ready to use the restroom. The RA will ask them to collect ½ inch of urine privately in the 
restroom , close the container and hand it to the RA who will be working near the data collection 
room. The RA will use rubber gloves to handle the sample. A drug test will be inserted in the urine 
and the results can be read within 3 minutes. The RA will empty the cup in a toilet and dispose the cup and gloves in a dedicated trash bin in a private area. The results will be recorded directly into 
redcap using the participant’s codename. No identifying informat ion will be attached to the results 
or the discarded materials . The RA will pay the participant when they complete the survey and they 
will be free to go. While she is in collecting the drug test, she will tell participants still working on 
the computer to wait for her to return in case they finish or have questions. The urine drug test 
procedure takes [ADDRESS_899333]

complete d and group attendance. Facilitators will upload the checklists directly to a facilitator -
assigned folder in Box, the study’s secured server, where they will be reviewed by [CONTACT_665908]. 
 
Participants will use both codenames and code numbers, which will be connected  in the electronic 
key list, but not in the database . We use this strategy to facilitate (and humanize) participants as we 
talk about them in meetings (including clinical supervision, NCCB meetings, and in  Community 
Wise groups). Participants can request that we destroy their data (except group voice recordings) at 
any time until data collection is completed  by [CONTACT_665909] e- mail. After that 
we will destroy the electronic key  and we will be unable to determine what data belongs to whom. 
Note that voice recordings will be kept indefinitely.  
 The clinical screen will be an in -person interview conducted by [CONTACT_234356], the licensed 
facilitator, or the project director who will be properly trained by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Windsor.  Urine  screens will be collected in person by a trained staff person . Baseline and follow-up will be 
administered through Redcap  on the laptop during the small group sessions and administered by 
[CONTACT_665910] . The peer facilitator will only be allowed to collect data from participants in 
the licensed facilitator groups and vice versa.    
Focus groups will be facilitated in person by [CONTACT_24099] [INVESTIGATOR_665863] g interviewed .  
 NCCB members and project staff will recuse themselves from interacting with anyone they personally know as a part of study activities. We will have study interviewers review the name [CONTACT_665977]. If they do, we will find someone else to conduct the interview. If a NCCB member unexpectedly encounter s someone they know at a study related activity, they will recuse themselves 
and notify the project dir ector and the principal investigators. The project director will keep a list of 
participants that we identify as having a personal relationship with NCCB members  or staff  and we 
will make sure these individuals are not booked together for any study related activities.   
Due to randomization, we cannot schedule the group time and date before the participant enrolls in the study. Thus, it is likely that many participants will be randomized into a group that is being held during a time when they are no availab le. Thus, we will offer, as a courtesy, The opportunity for 
people who are enrolled in the study to participate in a  full intervention group after they complete their participation in the study. These groups will be provided by [CONTACT_665911] a part of the study. No data will be collected and this will be offered solely to give 
participants the option to engage in the intervention.

and other networked information, as applicable. 
Data will be generated and collected through face -to-face computer assisted interviews, computer 
assisted self -interviews, focus groups, and group session audio recordings . This will include brief 
telephone screenings, clinical screenings, baseline, five post baseline follow-ups, focus groups and intervention sessions.  Interested individuals will call the study’s confidential phone number and complete a brief telephone screen with a research assistant who will obtain self -reported identifying 
and eligibility information such as birth date, co mplete name, last incarceration date and place, 
gender, current AIDU, and whether they reside in Essex County, NJ. Before completing the phone screen, participants will be given a brief description of the study and they will be informed that the informatio n they release on the phone will be kept confidential and will be used only to verify 
eligibility (including verification of their last incarceration place and date based on public records).

about the study and the clinical screen. They will sign an informed consent to participate in the 
clinical screen which will include Mini Mental State Exam, MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview 6 psychoticism and suicidality modules, and the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs-Substance Problem Scale (GAIN -SPS).  Those found to be eligible will learn about the randomization 
process and the study procedures. The clinician will go through the informed consent and those who agree will be randomized into one of eight experimental conditions and we will schedule the baseline.

 Baseline and follow- up data will be collected at NJCRI  by [CONTACT_665912] . Community Wise  
group participants will be scheduled to complete the data collection on the same day and time. Each participant will work independently on a private tablet  using RedCap data collection management 
software . We will collect outcome, process, and safety monitoring measures (e.g. MINI suicidality) 
including AIDU, use of treatment skills measure, and their perceptions about helpful components. This electronic data will only contain the code numbers and codenames and it will be stored in a secured server at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. Data will be securely uploaded into the server immediately after data collection. Only authorized personnel will have access to it.  
 
During the baseline assessment, we will ask participants permission to take  a digital photograph of 
them during the baseline to assist with finding them during follow -ups.  The photo of those who 
consent will be  taken by [CONTACT_665913], but not linked to any data. Photographs will be used by [CONTACT_941] o utreach 
workers to recognize participants on the streets  and they will be destroyed as soon as the participant 
completes follow up 5. Participants will have the option to refuse without penalty and they may ask us to destroy their photo at any time during the study.   
No research will be conducted with any subject while they are incarcerated . 
 
Focus groups  
Sixteen  out of [ADDRESS_899338]. The focus groups will be conducted at NJCRI  by 
a trained RA , and will be audio-recorded and transcribed for analysis. Focus group sessions will be

intervention. If a participant starts to talk about personal issues, the RA will stop them and offer to 
refer them to talk to an Integrity House counselor if appropriate (see focus group script). Data will be 
uploaded into a password -secured server at the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign . Only 
code numbers will be included with the electronic data.

We will find out about participants being incarcerated in one of three ways: 1) someone tells us about it while we are attempting to contact [CONTACT_108443], 2) the person themselves find a way to notify us, 3) 
we run a public search for incarceration in state and federal websites. Once we find someone who was 
incarcerated, we will check to see if they granted authorization for us to pursue them. If authorization was given, we will find out who is the appropriate authority and we will call them to make a formal request to visit the participant. We will simply state that the person is a participant in a health research study and that we would like to schedule a time to collect the follow up data in the facility. We will explain that the data will be collected using the REDC ap and that once it is submitted by [CONTACT_665916] , it is encrypted.

 Facilitators will have contact [CONTACT_665918]/cancel meetings / data collection , and check in during the week if needed. This 
information will be kept in the facilitator’s password protected study cell phone and will include instructions on whether it is all right to leave a message and under what circumstance for each participant.   All de -identified electronic data, including NCCB videos and focus group and Community Wise 
session group voice recordings will be stored in a Box cloud contracted through the University of Illinois (see https://www.box.com/business/
).
 Folders for specific content will be created and 
permissions will be assigned accordingly to members of the NCCB who are assigned to work with specific data files. The PIs and the project director will have access to all files. Other team members will gain access based on the tasks they are  assigned and cleared to complete. All team 
members will receive training on each task the y are to  perform by [CONTACT_665919]. [CONTACT_41214] will be responsible for tracking who has access to what at any given time. This data will be kept indefinitely for the purposes of data analysis.  
 T
he University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has applied  for a single Certificate of Confidentiality , 
which will apply to all collaborating institutions.  With this Certificate, the researchers cannot be 
forced to disclose information that may identify a participant, even by a court subpoena, in any federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceedings. However, the Certificate cannot be used to resist a demand for information from [LOCATION_002] Government 
personnel that is used for auditing or evaluation of federally funded projects. Researchers may also disclose the identity of participants who report intentions to harm themselves or others or if researchers have knowledge those participants are abusing children or elderly persons.

 All members of the research team (including all members of the NCCB) will complete IRB 
certification training prior to starting to work on the project. Dr s. Windsor and Benoit will be 
responsible for training NCCB members on project specific tasks, and on human subjects protocol. 
Both [CONTACT_41214] and [CONTACT_41215] are experienced researchers who have worked with this population before and who have conducted several projects that were higher than minimal risk. [CONTACT_41214] served as a member of the IRB at Rutger s University for [ADDRESS_899343]. Benoit is currently a member 
of the IRB at National Development & Research Institute s, Inc.  project director  and [CONTACT_41214] will 
train clinicians on the delivery of the intervention on IRB protocol.  
 We recognize that peer facilitators will need enhanced training, supervision, and support. The NCCB is currently reviewing the literature on peer group facilitation and we have created a committee who will be responsible for developi[INVESTIGATOR_665867]. This will include an all-day training conducted by 
a member of the NCCB who is a licensed practitioner. The training will cover our safety and ethical protocols, training on group facilitation techniques, and role play where they will be able to practice these skills. Peer and  licensed facilitators will participate in weekly supervision with [CONTACT_41214] to 
discuss each group and address potential problems. We will hire and train four peer facilitators to ensure that if someone needs to be replaced, we will have a back up facilitator.    
No research will be conducted with any subject while they are  incarcerated . 
  
18E.  DATA RETENTION  How long will the data be kept? 
 
All paper forms will be kept for at least 3 years after study completion.  
 Electronic files containing identifying information and focus group voice recordings will be deleted at 
study completion (once analysis is complete).  Facilitators will have contac t information for the participants in their groups so that they can contact 
[CONTACT_598190]/cancel meetings  and check in during the week if needed. Once the group is 
completed, the information will be deleted by [CONTACT_287890].  
 All de -identified electr onic data, including NCCB videos and Community Wise session group voice 
recordings will be stored in a Box cloud contracted through the University of Illinois (see https://www.box.com/business/
). This data will be kept indefinitely for the purposes of data analysis. 
 An identity key along with participants photo in electronic form will be kept until data collection is completed. At that time, the electronic key will be destroyed. Participants will be able to request that their data be destroyed (with the exception of voice recordings) as long as the electronic ke y is stored 
by [CONTACT_52931]. Once the electronic key is destroyed at the conclusion of data collection, we will no longer be able to destroy any data because we will no longer be able to track what part of the data belongs to what participant.

 Research context, findings, and interpretation will be di sseminated to policymakers, clinicians, 
members of the community, and researchers through publication of study results in peer- reviewed 
journals, periodicals, professional presentations at conferences (e.g., CPDD, APHA, ASA, SSWR, 
Paulo Freire Institute), and the media. However, individuals may want to access the data directly, either for the purpose of replicating published findings or to use the data to explore new or related research questions. 
 UIUC and NDRI
 resea rchers are bound by [CONTACT_665920] s oversee n by [CONTACT_665921] w Board. The inve stigators  have historically  made data 
from  previous projects available to other resear chers,  including graduate students, and other early -
career  individuals. We will continue to make  every  effort  to comply with reasonable requests  for 
access.  The investigators in collaboration with members of the Newark Community Collaborative Board 
(NCCB) will develop a  plan for sharing  data and associated  documentation with outside researchers. 
Regardless of specifics,  will require  a data-  sharing  agreement  that provides for the following  
conditions at minimum: (1) a commitm ent to using the  data only for research  purposes and not to 
identify any individual  particip ant; (2) a commitm ent to securing  the data using appropriate tools and 
computer technology; and (3) a commitm ent to destroying  or returning the data after analyses  are 
completed.  
 All data will be stripped of personal i dentifiers  so as to be suitable  for use by [CONTACT_127761].
 Even  
though the datab ase will be stripped of identifiers  prior to any sharing, however,  we will make the data 
and associ ated documentation available to users only under a data- sharing  agreement  that provides for 
the above- stated  commitments. 
 
 
   
18G. PRIVACY Describe provisions to protect the privacy interests of subjects. 
Participation  is voluntary and participants may stop participation at any time. Our interviewers are 
trained to watch participants carefully and will stop questioning if an individual appears uneasy. At every interview, participants will be informed that they may ask the interviewer to stop if they are feeling uncomfortable. Referrals to counselors are available if participants wish and trained clinical counsel ors are available at  NJCRI in the event that someone may need immediate assistance, whether 
it is during data collection or during the intervention sessions.  
 It is possible the NCCB members or group facilitators may know some of the potential clinical trial 
participants as these individuals live and work in Newark, NJ. Potential clinical trial participants may 
be clients, family members, or friend s of any NCCB member. The standard protocol for such 
situations is to ensure that any NCCB member who has a personal relationship with a potential 
participant does not interact with that person as part of the study or does not have access to data that includes their family/friend/client. To further protect privacy, NCCB members will not have access to 
the session voice recordings. Before assigning facilitators to specific groups, we will make sure that 
the facilitator does not personally knows any of the group members. 
 
Session voice files  will be stored in the secured server and only the PIs, PD, and RAs at the University 
of Illinois  coding the files for analysis will have access to th em.

used by [CONTACT_53030].  Indicate the language understood by [CONTACT_665922].  If the research involves pregnant women, fetuses, or neonates, indicate whether consent will be obtained from the mother, father, or both. If the research involves children, indicate whether consent will be obtained from:  Both parents unless one parent is deceased, unknown, incompetent, or not reasonably available, or when only one parent has legal responsibility for the care and custody of the 
child; or from one parent regardless of the status of the other parent.  
We will obtain  4 separate  consents:  
1) NCCB members will be ask ed to sign a consent to participate in the study 
2) RTC participants will be asked to sign a consent to complete the clinical screen  
3) RTC participants will be asked to sign a consent to participate in the study (including focus groups) 
4) Half of RCT participants will be randomly selected and asked to sign a consent to participate 
in a focus group about the intervention  
Participants will be recruited by [CONTACT_665923]. We will post study fliers throughout the city including parks, health service agencies, and places that provide services to people with histories of incarceration and substance abuse treatment. NCCB members will promote the stud y in the community and help encourage 
potential pa rticipants to consider participating. We will also attend community events where we will 
distribute flyers and ask participants themselves to encourage others to participate. Those interested will be able to call or e -mail the study’s private phone or e- mail to complete the phone screen. All 
potential participants will be screened for eligibility and will provide written informed consent before answering any questions. Project staff will inform each research subject in detail about the nature of the study, its sponsors, sources of funding, objectives, and goals, duration of the study, and the extent of participation sought.  The purpose and sponsorship of the research will be thoroughly explained and procedures for confidentiality will be clearly understood by [CONTACT_665924].  
 
It will be stressed that participation is voluntary and that participants are able to withdraw their consent and participation at any time during study data collection without explanation or repercussion, 
that respondents will be eligible to receive payments for their participation, and that payment is not

(see Data and Safety Monitoring Plan below for more detail on handling clinical emergencies). Participants will sign informed  consent forms prior to engaging in any research activities.  
 Participants will be asked to grant permission for us to take a digital photograph of them during the baseline when they are enrolled in the study and sign the informed consent. Their photo will be stored in connection to the real names and separate from the data. Only the PIs, project director, and outreach worker will have access to the photos. These will be used to help project staff identify participants that lose contact [CONTACT_7056]. Participants can request that their photo be destroyed at any time and the project staff will destroy the photos with 24hours of the participant’s request. A separate request for the photo was added to the informed consent.   Participants will also be asked to  provide consent for us to contact [CONTACT_665926]-up in 
the event they are re-incarcerated. Those refusing to consent to this will not be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. Participants will be informed that if they provide consent for us to contact [CONTACT_665927]-incarcerated, we may disclose their participation in the study to prison officials in order to obtain permission to complete the follow -up. The exact procedures will depend upon the facility’s policies 
and will be cleared with the IRB prior to a ny data collection taking place. Data will be collected by 
[CONTACT_665928].  No research w ill be conducted with any subject who 
becomes incarcerated until a research amendment discussing the procedures  is filed and approved by 
[CONTACT_1201]. A new consent document will be used for re -consent for incarcerated subjects. A letter of 
permission from the relevant correctional facility (local, state, federal jail or prison) will also  be 
submitted prior to conducting research with incarcerated subjects.

 Potential risks of this study include 1) inadvertent violation of confidentiality, 2) emotional distress on 
the part of participants, 3) potential discord during group sessions, given the sensitive topi[INVESTIGATOR_665868]. The use of code names and numbers along with other procedures described below are intended to prevent violations of confidentiality. It is important to be aware that participants may be disturbed by [CONTACT_665929]. Questions and discu ssions regarding drug use, HIV risk behavior including sexual activity, HCV infection, social 
and family relationships, and discrimination may cause anxiety, anger, suspi[INVESTIGATOR_40179], or other emotions.  While this is a predominantly African American sample, ther e will be some White and Latino 
participants as well and talking about racism in the group will elicit strong emotions. We welcome homosexual participants and discuss sexuality in groups that may include members who are opposed to homosexuality. Each of these differences has the potential to harm or cause discomfort for the participant or revive psychological dynamics that could threaten to renew old conflicts. We designed Community Wise  very carefully so that these discussions happen in a safe way, where everyone is 
encouraged to challenge their own assumptions by [CONTACT_263647]. This starts with operational components where the intervention is clearly described so that people know what to expect , and ground rules are collaboratively created and 
enforced during group discussions. In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], there were many instances where the critical questions posed led to a heated dialogue where people were able to express their conflicting views while respecting each other and considering the possibility of changing their point of view. In half of the conditions, w e are using licensed facilitators who have a great deal of experience dealing with these 
sensitive topi[INVESTIGATOR_263620]. Th e other half will be facilitated by [CONTACT_665930]. We will carefully select peers that show a deep understanding about the challenges of managing a group discussion and we will carefully train them on how to handle potential conflict in the group. The hiring process will be conducted by [CONTACT_6283]. Benoit and Windsor, and project director . Facilitators 
will participate in weekly supervision meetings where we will process any challenges they may experience and sessions will be taped so that we can provide them with feedback on how to improve their performance. In the unlikely event a discussion escalates to the point that it may challenge the 
safety of the group, or if during a session something happens and the facilitator needs assistance, there are trained NJCRI s taff that include licensed clinicians  and security in place who can intervene and 
deflect potential violence.  Moreover, during the Community Wise  pi[INVESTIGATOR_665869] a result of study participatio n were observed.  
 
Another risk to confidentiality refers to the fact that participants who participate in Community Wise groups will learn information about other participants that are shared in the group.  Group participants 
will make a pledge in the first group meeting to maintain confidentiality.  While we hope that people 
will abide by [CONTACT_665931], it is possible that group members share information about you with other individuals. We disclosed this risk to participants in the informed consent noting 
this risk for 
Community Wise Groups and research focus groups. 
 It is possible the NCCB members and group facilitators may know some of the potential clinical trial 
participants as these individuals live and work in Newark, NJ. Potential clinical trial par ticipants may 
be clients, family members or friend s of any NCCB member. The standard protocol for such 
situations is to ensure that any NCCB member or group facilitator who has a personal relationship 
with a potential participant does not interact with tha t person as part of the study or does not have 
access to data that identifies  their family/friend/ client.  
 
Clinical trial participants will be randomized into the 16 conditions. It is possible that participants may not be randomized into their study condition of choice (e.g., some people prefer peer facilitators 
while others prefer a licensed clinician). We will clearly explain to participants at the orientation

We maintain role boundaries 
through subcommittees dedicated to performing specific research tasks. Roles  are selected for NCCB 
members based on their expertise, interest, availability and performance. Some roles automatically preclude others (e.g., group facilitators may not collect data from their groups ).  Finally,  each task 
assigned to the NCCB includes training specific to that task. The PIs and PD are responsible for developi[INVESTIGATOR_665870]- related training.  
 
 
20B.  RISK LEVEL:    No more than minimal risk  
(the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated for participation in the proposed research are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests).  
 
  More than  minimal risk  
 
20C. Data Monitoring Plan: If you checked that the research is more than minimal risk, describe the 
provisions for monitoring the data to ensure the safety of subjects (Who will periodically monitor harms 
and benefits experienced by [CONTACT_665935]? How often will monitoring occur? What analyses will be performed? If appropriate, what criteria will be used to stop the research based on monitoring of the results?)  
The DSMP was reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_665936] -Champaign IRB, who will continue to monitor the study as it progresses.  Data will be 
collected at NJCRI .  All data will be stored in password protected devices and/or locked in a filing 
cabinet in a locked office space where only authorized members of the research team have access.  A database will be set up at a password protected University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign server in such a way that all authoriz ed members of the research team will be able to access specific files 
remotely.  Each member will be assigned a password protected account that will allow them to access the database.  Immediately after data entry, all data will be filed at University of Illinois at Urbana -
Champaign for safekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  P roject director

 marginalized population and there is potential for harm. Thus, we developed a Data and Safety 
Monitoring Plan (DSMP) and will create a Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_665871].  The DSMP is as follows:  
 1.  The participants are fully informed of the study requirements throughout the evaluation and are allowed the opportunity to withdraw from participation, at no penalty to themselves or their ability to receive other treatment that we suggest at regular cost to them.  This is written in the consent form, which will be approved by [CONTACT_1026].  2. Risks of the study and steps taken to minimize risk and protect the participants as outlined in the consent form are as follows:  
a. Possible discomfort from answering personal questions.   If the pa rticipants experience such 
discomfort at any time, they are free to inform the interviewer or facilitator, and are free to withdraw from the program. Interviewers will be trained to observe signs of discomfort and check with participants if they want to co ntinue. Licensed facilitators and peer facilitators are trained to 
address discomfort during the sessions and participants are able to leave whenever they need.  b. Discomfort or risk of minor or major substance withdrawal symptoms. This will be carefully assessed at the Clinical Screen and throughout the intervention.  Monthly assessments will test levels of AIDU and suicidality. Staff at Integrity House, Inc. and NJCRI, as well as group 
facilitators are highly trained to recognize and recommend courses of action for current or potential withdrawal symptoms, and will consult with project director  at Integrity House, Inc. 
Integrity House, Inc. offers a variety of substance abuse treatment services and staff there are fully trained to recognize and address signs of withdrawal. [CONTACT_41214] will be available to consult with project director and the group facilitators via phone and e-mail, and she will provide on-going, remote clinical supervision and monitoring of each case.  In the event of acute 
withdrawal symptoms or high risk behaviors (i.e., suicidal or homicidal ideation, intent, or plan), the facilitator will refer the participant to the appropriate staff at NJCRI . for admission to 
inpatient or ambulatory detoxification.  [CONTACT_41214] and the project director will review each intake for risk of withdrawal symptoms, level of care needs, and appropriate action plan.  Members of the NCCB who are service providers will be available to provide consultation to any 
challenges that may arise with participants. Member service providers include social workers 
experienced in the field of substance abuse.  
 c. Clinical emergencies will be handled by [CONTACT_665937] , who will be available by [CONTACT_665938].  Appropriate assessments will be 
conducted; treatment options will be recommended and followed through as necessary.  NJCRI routinely provide services to individuals with substance use disorders and they are fully equipped to address any potential emergencies either themselves or via referrals.  NJCRI , project director , 
and the NCCB have longstanding relationships with all substance abuse treatment facilities in Newark, NJ. NJCRI  project director  or on- call service providers will be available [ADDRESS_899347]

 d. Non -Response to Intervention . Close monitoring during the intervention allows us to determine 
if a participant develops increased risk or withdrawal symptoms or need of a higher level of care.  
At any time during the course of the intervention, any acute medical issues, non-response to treatment, or reported or observed withdrawal symptoms will result in the facilitator’s consultation with project director  and/or [CONTACT_41214] regarding appropriate course of action using NJCRI  
guidelines.   
 e. Relapse and Referral for Further Treatment.  As the participant nears the end of the intervention, our intervention will include relapse prevention, and what to do in the event of relapse. Each participant therefore will leave the intervention with a plan for handling relapse during the follow-up period and beyond. If further treatment is indicated, we will provide the participant with several 
outpatient referrals.  After the intervention, should the participant request a referral for treatment, study personnel will refer the participant to NJCRI  where staff can provide appropriate care or 
referrals.   
 f. Deterioration. Clients who are deteriorating during treatment will be reviewed by [CONTACT_665939]. Windsor. Clients may be withdrawn from the study and/or referred to a higher 
level of care if they meet specific indicators of deterioration that will be discussed during clinical supervision (e.g., become suicidal, regularly arrives high to participate in group discussions, consistently displays disruptive behavior during group).   g. Potential harm done by [CONTACT_665940].  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_665872] a positive outcome. However, given the sensitive nature of the topi[INVESTIGATOR_665873], the diversity of the groups, and the innovative nature of the intervention, harm as a result of participation in Community Wise  is possible. The facilitators, project director, and [CONTACT_41214] 
will closely monitor the course of the intervention through ongoing data collection, observations, and weekly supervision and staff meetings to monitor and address any issues that may arise.   h. All cases will be monitored closely on a weekly basis by [CONTACT_665941] ([CONTACT_41214], project director, [CONTACT_41215], NCCB, research assistants) and the facilitators.  All participants will be supervised by [CONTACT_665942], at least one other clinical expert (including [CONTACT_41214]), and by [CONTACT_665943], ongoing data analysis, and weekly clinical and staff meetings.   
 
i. Any research staff member who learns of an adverse event is respon sible for reporting the event 
to the Principal Investigators ( PI), who are in turn responsible for discussing the event to make a 
joint decision about whether the event is serious or non-serious.  Events will be categorized as adverse or serious adverse according to NIH guidelines: “Adverse events (AEs) are defined as any untoward medical occurrence that may present itself during treatment or administration of an intervention, and which may or may not have a causal relationship with the treatment. Serious adverse events (SAEs) are defined as any medical occurrence that results in death; is life-
threatening; requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; creates persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defects.”  As such, adverse events (AEs) occurring during the course of the study will be collected, documented, and reported to the PIs or a designated co -investigator. The occurrence of AEs will be assessed during 
the intervention phase of the study at baseline and each group visit through clinical observation. Each week a study investigator will review the AE Forms from the previous week for events that were reported as new or continuing. The study investigators will follow all AEs to the point of a 
satisfactory resolution. A study participant may be withdrawn from the study if the responsible

participant. All AEs will be assessed to determine if they meet criteria for an SAE. If an AE meets 
criteria for serious adverse event (SAE), as defined by [CONTACT_1622], they will be systematically evaluated at each clinic visit and treated in a similar fashion as AEs with regards to monitoring and report ing. 
 Any SAE will be reported to each of the three IRB’s and to the assigned NIH Project Officer within 48 hours of the occurrence. The report of SAEs will include whether they were expected or unexpected, a rating of severity of the event, a brief narrative summary of the event, a determination of whether a causal relationship existed between the study procedures and the event, whether the informed consent should be changed as a result of the event and whether all enrolled participants should be notified of the event. Finally, as part of the annual progress report (noncompeting continuation application) to NIH, we would provide summary information on all SAEs that have occurred during that year.   j. Any actions taken by [CONTACT_665944].  k. The PIs and [CONTACT_84135] will closely monitor the validity and integrity of the data on an on- going 
basis. The DSMB with also conduct biannual monitoring of the data through spot checks and independe nt preliminary analysis of the data. For instance, the PIs and the Project Director will 
meet regularly with project interviewers to review assessments and coding of incoming data. The PIs will be responsible for ensuring that data are being coded, entered  and cleaned appropriately. 
The full research team will meet every week for 120 minutes to review all aspects of the research study.   l. Data collected from NCCB members is anonymous and does not include sensitive information. It will be reviewed by [CONTACT_941] I RB, but this data will not be included in the oversight of the DSMP  
 
  21.  BENEFITS  Describe the expected benefits of the research to the subjects and/or to society.  
 
The potential benefits to participants in this study and other members of the community are significant 
and long lasting if the proposed research results in a manual-based optimized intervention that is truly community-based, culturally congruent, effective, and scalable. In the near term, participants may experience increased feelings of empowerment, connection with their community, sense of purpose in life and self -esteem, all of which have been associated with reduced health -risk behaviors. The 
community itself is likely to benefit from the various capacity building projects that participants will implement during the intervention. In the near term, participation itself can be beneficial when individuals are able to share their lived experiences and conce rns about health needs and community 
problems in a secure and unthreatening environment. Community member participants will also be compensated materially for participating in interviews, focus groups and the pi[INVESTIGATOR_52393].  In addition, if participants express a need for professional assistance at any time, the project team and the NCCB are well equipped to either provide service or make appropriate referrals.  
 
Knowledge to be gained from this investigation is important for deepening our understanding of structural environmental challenges as contributors to racial and economic health inequalities between 
distressed communities with concentrations of African Americans (DCAA) and their wealthier and

IRB-1 04/08/[ADDRESS_899349] and differences between community culture and the theoretical frameworks 
of many evidence-based interventions. Knowledge produced by [CONTACT_29436]- based participatory 
research (CBPR) such as  that proposed here can address these challenges while building community 
capacity and empowerment. This is the first study to apply the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) under CBPR principles to optimize a multi-level intervention. This cutting edge research will help increase the number of rigorous methodologies available that can be used with CBPR principles to develop multi- level interventions targeting myriad health inequalities.  
 
 
  
22.  RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT  Weigh the risks with regard to the benefits. Provide evidence 
that benefits outweigh risks. 
The value of the knowledge to be gained far outweigh s the potential risks of participation described 
above, particularly when considering the precautions we have taken to minimize these risks. As explained earlier in this section, project staff will employ every effort to maintain confidentiality and to minimize any other potential risks; should a serious adverse event occur, it will be reported to the DSMB, Project Officer, funding agencies and the IRBs of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, NDRI, NJCRI, and Michigan University within [ADDRESS_899350].

23. Is this a multi- center study in which the UIUC investigator is the lead investigator of a multicenter 
study, or the UIUC is the lead site in a multi-center study.       Yes        No  
 
If yes, describe the management and communication of information obtained that might be relevant to the protection of subjects, such as: unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others, interim results and protocol modifications. 
 
To avoid possible violations of confidentiality, project staff are trained to carefully follow detailed 
procedures designed to assure that no information about any participant (or others they may mention) 
will be given to law enforcement, other government agencies, or anyone but research staff.  Every member of the research team and all NCCB members will be required to undergo human subject protection training and provide a certificate of completion to the IRB prior to any contact [CONTACT_80414]. Standards of confidentiality include the use of code numbers and code names for participants and other individuals they may mention. The only place participants’ names or other identifying information will appear is on informed consent forms and locator forms (used for follow-up interviews after the baseline). These forms will be kept in a locked filing cabinet at NJCRI , which will be kept 
separate from data. The Project Director, and [CONTACT_41215], a Principal Investigator, are the only people who will have access  to the filing cabinet.  
 
The electronic files generated through data collection will be identified by [CONTACT_41211]-protected devices/servers, separate from identifying information and available only to 
project staff. This helps to  ensure that no identifying information will be disclosed in the unlikely

 Our interviewers are trained to watch participants carefully and will stop questioning if an individual appears uneasy. At every interview, participants will be informed that they may ask the interviewer to stop if they are feeling uncomfortable. Referrals to counselors are available if participants wish and trained clinical counselors are available at NJCRI  in the event that someone may need immediate 
assistance, whether it is during data collection or during the intervention sessions.   [CONTACT_41214], [CONTACT_41215], and project director  will be available by [CONTACT_665889]. Any adverse event will be reported to the IRB and funding agency within [ADDRESS_899352] excellent relationships with the community, including community members and agencies that we can mobilize in case the need arises (e.g., access to providers that provide detox and emergency services, free legal support clinics, community members who learned from participants about their engagement in the study may reach out to us for help in case they know one of our participants may be in trouble).  In addition to this extensive network, we will collect data during the baseline and follow-up assessments to monitor participant safety. For instance, we will conduct the MINI suicidality screen and if we find anyone at risk, we will have the appropriate group clinician reach out to the participant individually and make sure they are linked to the mental health services they need.  
 Finally, the research team and the clinical team will engage in weekly project meetings to discuss the progress of the study and identify, discuss, and address any potential issues.

Script for terminating the Clinical Screen: 
If they do not qualify:  
I am sorry but the screen is showing you are not eligible. The intervention has some components that 
could be more harmful to some people. Since the program is still new, we are not taking any risks and 
making sure your safety comes first.   If ineligible due to MINI, let them know the screen captured a 
cognitive deficit and encourage them to contact [CONTACT_665955]. If the y ask what that 
means, say they do not seem to be processing information properly. This could be due to an injury, age, 
genetics, drug use, or other illnesses. Thus, they should follow up with a doctor. If they are ineligible due to their drug use level, tell them their level of substance use disqualified them but do not provide 
further information. Refer them appropriately  with the referral list . 
If they say they are seeking residential treatment, let them know they do not qualify for the study. If 
they sa y they tried to get into residential but were unable to, ask how long the waiting list is. If longer 
than 5 months, admit them. If not, let them know they are not eligible.  
 
If they qualify:  
Congratulations, you qualify for the study. The next step will b e to attend an orientation session where 
we will explain the study in detail to you. We will not pay you to attend but we will provide 
transportation tickets at the end. The orientation will last [ADDRESS_899398] includes all of the information. After the orientation, if you are still 
interested, you will be invited to complete another questionnaire on the computer and after that you 
will start the intervention. We plan on starting Community Wise groups in two weeks or so. [Give them 
one copy of the full informed consent letter and encourage them to read it and write down their questions to ask at orientation]. Do you have any questions? [if they ask about the study, tell them to 
read the consent and attend the orientation]. Ask them if they would like a copy of our referral list.

F LEAD RESEARCHER S:  [CONTACT_263689], MSW and [CONTACT_666007] 
RESE
ARCH STUDY: We invite you to participate in a research study that seeks to evaluate 
Community Wise, a new program seeking  to reduce substance use. W e want to develop the best 
program we can by [CONTACT_665956][INVESTIGATOR_665881]. 
To decide if you want to take part in this study, you need to know about its risks and benefits. I 
will go over this informed consent form with you. Once all your questions have been answered, I will ask you if you want to participate in the study. If you want to participate, you and I will sign this document.  You will get a copy of it.  
Th
is researc h is confidential. The research records will include some information about you but 
this information will be stored in such a manner that will keep  your identity separate from  your 
responses.   Some of the information collected about you will include your name, address and 
phone number. You will also be asked some personal questions and to share some of the personal experiences you’ve had. For example, questions and discussions may relate to mental health issues, substance use or experiences you’ve had in Es sex County since your release. 
Please note that we will limit access to the research data and keep it stored in a password secured 
online server . 
PURP
OSE:  The purpose of this research study is to refine  the Community Wise program so 
that it is as efficie nt as it can be. This study seeks to test if three different components of 
Community Wise reduce substance use. 
DURATI
ON:  If you agree to participate in this study you will complete up to 9 research 
interviews ( each lasting between 30 minutes and 90 minutes ) and attending up to 15 weekly 
group meetings (2 hours each). It will take approximately 5 months to complete the meetings and 
all of the interviews.  
PRO
CEDURES:  If you agree to participate, we will ask you to take part in up to 15 weekly 
group s essions (approximately 2 hours each) led either by a peer or a licensed facilitator where 
you will meet with other people in Essex County who have had similar experiences as you. The number of sessions you will be asked to attend will depend upon which version of the program you are randomly selected to join . Thus you will not be able to choose which group you will be 
joining. This means you could be randomized (pi[INVESTIGATOR_665882])  to join the “Core ” 
group that includes [ADDRESS_899466]
Approval Date: November 15, 2021 
IRB #[ADDRESS_899467] the privacy of 
the session, we hope everybody will abide by [CONTACT_665957]’t 
guarantee that some group members won’t reveal information about you to others after the session is over.  
 
In addition to attending these group sessions, your participation in this study will involve the following interviews :  a brief phone talk , an individual interview,  up to 6 monthly computer 
interviews , and possibly a focus group ( for a total of 9 research interviews). Each interview  will 
include a urine drug screen , meaning we will ask you for a sample of urine and will test it for 
certain substances.  In the baseline interview we will ask your permission to take a digital photo 
of you. You may refuse to take the photo without penalty. The information you give us, including results from saliva screens  and photo, will be kept private. There are no consequences 
to having positive or negative urine  drug  screen s and no one outside of this study, including 
parole officers or the providers at NJCRI , will be info rmed of the results. Your answers to any 
questions that will be asked throughout this study will be completely confidential. If, at any time, you do not want to answer a question or participate in a certain part of the study, you may refuse without penalty . You should know that some of the interviews include questions about suicide . If 
we find that you are thinking about killing yourself , your group facilitator will be notified and 
asked to  offer you assistance.
 
PARTICIPANTS:   592 men will be recruited from Essex County, NJ . All participants will be 
adults with a history of substance use disorder transitioning from incarceration into Essex County.  
 
RISKS/DISCOMFORTS: Discussing issues related to mental health, substance use, 
incarcera tion and other personal experiences can be painful and uncomfortable. You always have 
the right to stop participating in the research study and program at any  time without penalty. If 
you feel upset during any part of the study, for example, during the group sessions or during an interview, you may stop participating. At that time we can let you speak with our project manager or a trained counselor at NJCRI . If necessary, we will refer you to affordable services in 
the community that can help address emotional issues that may arise during your participation in this study.   While we will take several steps to protect your identity and the confidentiality of your responses (see details below), there is a small chance that confidentiality may be lost. For instance, data could be stolen while the researcher transports your consent form to the office.  We will take every precaution to prevent  this from happening, including the use of a locked file and password 
protected secured server to safeguard your information. The only instance where the

 researcher will reveal information you provide is if during the interview you tell us  about 
child abuse or about yourself o r someone else being in danger that is about to happen.  In 
these circumstances, the researcher will notify the appropriate authorities.  If you begin to 
reveal this information during the interview, the researcher will remind you that such information cannot be kept confidential or secret. 
 BENEFITS: We hope that the group sessions in this study will help you with issues you may be 
having with substance use and returning to the community from incarceration. However, we 
cannot guarantee that these sessions w ill have a positive effect or any effect at all. In 
participating, however, you are helpi[INVESTIGATOR_665883]. You may also find that the group discussions may help you think about some issues in new and more useful ways. You may feel empowered by [CONTACT_665958], relate to others and gain a voice that can be used to help your community.  ALTERNATIVES: Participating in this study is completely voluntary. It is your choice to participate in this study and all of its components. Choosing not to be part of the study will not involve any penalty or loss of benefits to you. Your participation or nonparticipation in this study will not h ave any effect on your parole, parole decisions, or  your relationship with providers in 
the community, the University of Illinois at Urbana -Champaign or NDRI. It will not have any 
effect on the services provided to you at NJCRI .    
 CONFIDENTIALITY:  To make sure that your privacy and confidentiality are protected, your name [CONTACT_665998]. We will ask you for contact [CONTACT_3031] (e.g., 
phone number, address) so that we can reach you to schedule follow-up interviews, but that 
information will be kept in a locked file cabinet in the project manager’s office. There will be a 
code number placed on all of the documents related to your interviews and the urine screens and 
you will use a code name [CONTACT_665999]. Only the project manager 
and [CONTACT_41215] will have access to the only document that links your name [CONTACT_666000]. 
Your comments will be kept confidential. Only researchers working on this study will have access to the information  you provide, and they will know only your code name [CONTACT_114040]. 
Faculty, students, and staff at the University of Illinois who may see your information will maintain confidentiality to the extent of laws and university policies. Things that you say throughout the study will be reported in ways that will protect your identity. If we use s pecific 
things you say, we will not refer to you by [CONTACT_263668]. For example, we might report that 
during one group session, "four people mentioned needing help finding housing."   Once the study is completed, other researchers may ask  to use the data. Sharing data is an 
important way to create opportunities for new discoveries. Thus we will make every effort to make the data available to others, but only if we believe your identity and privacy are protected. In order to share the data, we will require  an agre ement  that provides for the following 
conditions at minimum:  (1) a commi tment to use the
 data only for research  purposes and not to 
identify any individ ual particip ant; (2) a commitment to secur e the  data using appropriate tools 
and computer technology; and (3) a commi tment to destroy or return the  data after analyses are 
completed. We will remove all  personal  identifiers  from the data before we will allow it to be used

2) You should understand that a Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent you or a member of your family from voluntarily releasing information about yourself or your involvement in this research.  
3) If you give another person or organization your written permission to receive research information, then we  may not use the Certificate to withhold that information.  
4) Mandated reporting of ongoing child maltreatment or imminent danger.  All project staff will be trained in how to protect confidentiality and will sign a pledge of 
confidentiality. Utmost care will be taken when contact[CONTACT_665959].  Only s tudy staff will talk with  you directly unless you ask another a uthorized staff 
person to leave a message. In general, we will not tell anyone any information about you. When this research is discussed or published, no one will know that you were in the study.    You must also be warned that peers who participate in your Community Wise group will learn information about you that you choose to share in the group.  Group participants will make a pledge in the first group meeting to maintain confidentiality. While we hope that people will abide by [CONTACT_665931], it is possible that group members will share information about you with 
other individuals.  
 FINANCIAL COSTS/PAYMENTS TO THE PARTICIPANT: You will not receive payments for the week ly group discussions. However, you will receive compensation for each 
interview activity  you participate in, ranging from $10 for 30 minutes and $[ADDRESS_899469] the opportunity to receive a minimum of $ 157.50 to a maximum of  $187.50 if you are eligible and choose to particip ate in all 
possible research interviews over the period of 5 months.   RIGHT TO REFUSE OR WITHDRAW:  Your participation is voluntary. You may refuse to participate, or stop participating at any time, without any penalty or loss of benefits, and without any impact on past or future incarceration . You have the right to refuse to answer any question or 
participate in any aspect of the study. Additionally, we have the right to dismiss you from the study, including the group sessions, at any time. Finally, if you decide to stop participating, you 
may request that we destroy your data at any time during the study. At the end of the study we will destroy all identifying data and we will no longer be able to tell what data belongs to whom. We will keep group session voice recordings indefinitely and that is the only part of the data you may not request to be destroyed because it has data from other participants included in the sessions.

 RESEARCH STUDY: We invite you to participate in a research study that seeks to evaluate 
Community Wise, a new program seeking  to reduce substance use. W e want to develop the best 
program we can by [CONTACT_665956][INVESTIGATOR_665881]. 
To decide if you want to take part in this study, you need to know about its risks and benefits. I will go over this informed consent form with you. Once all your questions have been answered, I will ask you if you want to participate in the study. If you want to participate, you and I will sign this document.  You will get a copy of it.   This researc h is confidential. The research records will include some information about you but 
this information will be stored in such a manner that will keep  your identity separate from  your 
responses.   Some of the information collected about you will include your name, address and 
phone number. You will also be asked some personal questions and to share some of the personal experiences you’ve had. For example, questions and discussions may relate to mental health issues, substance use or experiences you’ve had in Es sex County since your release. 
Please note that we will limit access to the research data and keep it stored in a password secured 
online server . 
 PURPOSE:  The purpose of this research study is to refine  the Community Wise program so 
that it is as efficie nt as it can be. This study seeks to test if three different components of 
Community Wise reduce substance use. 
 
DURATION:   If you agree to participate in this study you will complete up to 9 research 
interviews ( each lasting between 30 minutes and 90 minutes ) and attending up to 15 weekly 
group meetings (2 hours each). It will take approximately 5 months to complete the meetings and 
all of the interviews.  
 
PROCEDURES:  If you agree to participate, we will ask you to take part in 15 weekly 
group s essions (approximately 2 hours each) led either by a trained  facilitator where you 
will meet with other people in Essex County  who have had similar experiences as you. Y our 
participation in the study will take  approximately  [ADDRESS_899481]

 please understand that we can’t guarantee that some group members won’t reveal 
information about you to others after the session is over.  
 
In addition to attending these group sessions, your participation in this study will involve the following interviews :  a brief phone talk , an individual interview,  up to 6 monthly computer 
interviews , and possibly a focus group ( for a total of 9 research interviews). Each interview  will 
include a urine drug screen , meaning we will ask you for a sample of urine and will test it for 
certain substances.  In the baseline interview we will ask your permission to take a digital photo 
of you. You may refuse to take the photo without penalty. The information you give us, including results from saliva screens  and photo, will be kept private. There are no consequences 
to having positive or negative urine  drug  screen s and no one outside of this study, including 
parole officers or the providers at NJCRI , will be info rmed of the results. Your answers to any 
questions that will be asked throughout this study will be completely confidential. If, at any time, you do not want to answer a question or participate in a certain part of the study, you may refuse without penalty . You should know that some of the interviews include questions about suicide . If 
we find that you are thinking about killing yourself , your group facilitator will be notified and 
asked to  offer you assistance.
 
PARTICIPANTS:   631 men will be recruited  from Essex County, NJ . All participants will be 
adults with a history of substance use disorder transitioning from incarceration into Essex County.  
 
RISKS/DISCOMFORTS: Discussing issues related to mental health, substance use, 
incarceration and other per sonal experiences can be painful and uncomfortable. You always have 
the right to stop participating in the research study and program at any  time without penalty. If 
you feel upset during any part of the study, for example, during the group sessions or during an interview, you may stop participating. At that time we can let you speak with our project manager or a trained counselor at NJCRI . If necessary, we will refer you to affordable services in 
the community that can help address emotional issues that may arise during your participation in this study.   
While we will take several steps to protect your identity and the confidentiality of your responses (see details below), there is a small chance that confidentiality may be lost. For instance, data could be stolen while the researcher transports your consent form to the office.  We will take every precaution to prevent  this from happening, including the use of a locked file and password 
protected secured server to safeguard your information. The only instance where the 
researcher will reveal information you provide is if during the interview you tell us  about 
child abuse or about yourself or someone else being in danger that is about to happen.  In 
these circumstances, the researcher will notify the appropriate authorities.  If you begin to 
reveal this information during the interview, the researcher will remind you that such information 
cannot be kept confidential or secret. 
 BENEFITS: We hope that the group sessions in this study will help you with issues you may be 
having with substance use and returning to the community from incarceration. However, we 
cannot guarantee that these sessions will have a positive effect or any effect at all. In participating, however, you are helpi[INVESTIGATOR_665883]. You may also find that the group discussions may help you think about some issues in new and more useful ways. You may feel

It is your choice to participate in this study and all of its components. Choosing not to be part of the study will not involve any penalty or loss of benefits to you. Your participation or nonparticipation in this study will not have any effect on your parole, parole decisions, or  your relationship with providers in 
the community, the University of Illinois at Urbana -Champaign or NDRI. It will not have any 
effect on the services provided to you at NJCRI .    
 CONFIDENTIALITY:  To make sure that your privacy and confidentiality are protected, your name [CONTACT_665998]. We will ask you for contact [CONTACT_3031] (e.g., 
phone number, address) so that we can reach you to schedule follow- up interviews, but that 
information will be kept in a locked file cabinet in the project manager’s office. There will be a 
code number placed on all of the documents related to your interviews and the urine screens and you will use a code name [CONTACT_665999]. Only the project manager 
and [CONTACT_41215] will have access to the only document that links your name [CONTACT_666000]. 
Your comments will be kept confidential. Only researchers working on this study will have access to the information  you provide, and they will know only your code name [CONTACT_114040]. 
Faculty, students, and staff at the University of Illinois who may see your information will maintain confidentiality to the extent of laws and university policies. Things that you say throughout the study will be reported in ways that will protect your identity. If we use s pecific 
things you say, we will not refer to you by [CONTACT_263668]. For example, we might report that 
during one group session, "four people mentioned needing help finding housing."   
Once the study is completed, other researchers may ask  to use the data. Sharing data is an 
important way to create opportunities for new discoveries. Thus we will make every effort to 
make the data available to others, but only if we believe your identity and privacy are protected. In order to share the data, we will require  an agre ement  that provides for the following 
conditions at minimum:  (1) a commi tment to use the
 data only for research  purposes and not to 
identify any individ ual particip ant; (2) a commitment to secur e the  data using appropriate tools 
and computer technology; and (3) a commi tment to destroy or return the  data after analyses are 
completed. We will remove all  personal  identifiers  from the data before we will allow it to be used  
by [CONTACT_29091] .  
 To help us protect your privacy, we obtained a Certificate of Confidentiality  from the National 
Institutes of Health. With this Certificate, researchers cannot be forced to disclose information that may identify you, even by a court subpoena, in any federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceedings. We will use the Certificate of Confidentiality to resist any demands for information that would identify you, with the following exceptions:

2) You should understand that a Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent you or a member of your family from voluntarily releasing information about yourself or your involvement in this research.  
3) If you give another person or organization your written permission to receive research information, then we  may not use the Certificate to withhold that information.

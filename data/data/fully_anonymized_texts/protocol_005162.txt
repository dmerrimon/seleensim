 1 BACKGROUND  
The purpose of this investigational  study is to assess the ability of Tympanoseal  
(sodium/calcium alginate ), an investigational  device , to act as a scaffold  during healing of 
the tympanic membrane.  Tympanoseal  is intended for use following removal or extrusion of 
indwelling tympanostomy tubes or traumatic injury of the tympanic membrane.    
 
 
Formulation of  Tympanoseal  
 
Tympanoseal is formulated from a hydrogel consisting of sodium and calcium mixed salt of 
alginic acid.  
 
Grace Medical, in cooperation with Cliff Megerian MD of Case Western Reserve University 
has developed Tympanoseal, a sodium/ calcium alginate tympanic membrane scaffolding 
device  to address the issues in existing state of the art technologies.  It will be available as 
one device that can be trimmed to four different sizes.  
 
Tympanoseal devices  were constructed using an injection molding 
technique which results in gels composed of  2.7% PronovaTM calcium 
alginate  and 1.8 % PronovaTM sodium alginate (Melvik et al.,  [LOCATION_002] 
Patent 7,790,600, September 7,2010 ). This gelling methodo logy is 
proprietary to NovaMatrix, AS of Drammen, NO , and is marketed as a self -
gelling alginate. Upon solidification the hydrogel appears very light, 
opaque beige.  
 
Different sizes as measured by [CONTACT_466302] -flange shaft will be available 
including 2mm, 3mm, 4mm and 5mm.  Tympanoseal will be  provided lyophilized in a special 
capsule made of medical -grade transparent Nylon [ADDRESS_597897] 
size and removed by [CONTACT_466303].

Ototoxicity testing of calcium alginate samples using Grace Medical’s proprietary method 
was performed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Hinrich Staecker and Jennifer Nelson Brantley of the University of 
Kansas Medical Center.   The Auditory & Vestibular Neuroscience Lab  tested the o totoxicity 
by [CONTACT_43119] - mouse model when exposed to Grace Medical’s a lginate formulation via 
surgical implantation.   
 
Conclusions:  “There was no evidence of any hearing loss either in the acute or late period 
after alginate placement. No evidence of b alance problems were seen on behavioral 
evaluation. Evaluation of animals after termination of experiment demonstrated that all the 
material had absorbed. ”

 1.2 Overview of Clinical Studies  
 
Adverse Events Associated with NovaMatrix Self Gelling Alginate  
 
Clinical trials of Algisyl (Lone Star Heart, Laguna Hills, CA) a cardiac repair gel made with 
NovaMatrix self gelling alginate have demonstrated adverse events in 21.4% of test 
subjects.  None of these events have been related to alginate itself but to development of 
infections or worsening of hear t conditions  No other occurrences of adverse events from 
use of NovaMatrix self gelling alginate have been found.  
 
 
2 STUDY RATIONALE  
 
This study will provide data on the  safety and the  ability of sodium/ calcium alginate gels to 
act as a scaffold  capable of occluding a tympanic membrane perforation over the duration 
of complete healing.   Tympanoseal  could be used in cases where cartilage or fat graft 
tympanoplasty would be indicated.  
 
 
2.1 Risk / Benefit Assessment  
 
Risk Versus Benefits to the S ubjects  
 
Risk levels are assessed on the severity level and the likelihood of occurrence.  Both 
severity and oc currence levels for the risks assessed were considered low in this study.  
 
 
Risk  Risk 
Level  Mitigation  
Bio-incompatible – adverse reaction to the

Version Date: 07/12/2017   Page 13 of 30 
 The anticipated benefits of Tympanoseal are as follows:  
 
1. Potential improvement in perforation repair rate indicated by [CONTACT_466307].  
 
2. Calcium alginate has been proven to increase fibroblast proliferation needed to produce 
collagen in the creation of a stable lamina propria layer.  No current perforation seal repair 
material enables regeneration of the natural lamina propria.  
 
3. Ease of application which will be similar to vent tube placement.  
 
4. Calcium ions in the seal will exchange for sodium ions in exudates of the tympanic 
membrane wound potentially enhancing hemostasis and allowing collagen deposition to 
establish a stable lamina propria.  
 
5. No risk of lateralization found in underlay techniques of tympanoplasty which may result 
in hearing loss and cholesteatoma . 
(Jung TT,  Park SK. Mediolateral graft tympanoplasty for anterior or subtotal tympanic 
membrane perforation.  Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg .  2005  Apr;132(4):532 -6). 
 
6. No need for Gelfoam to be placed under the seal to support it and eliminates the risk of 
fibrosis in the middle ear reported with Gelfoam .   
(Smith  J,  Gardner E ,  Dornhoffer JL .Hearing results with a hydroxylapatite/titanium bell 
partial ossicular replacement prosthesis.  Laryngoscope.  [ADDRESS_597903];112(10):1796 -9.) 
 
7. Supplying surgeons with an FDA approved device to act as scaffolding  for tympanic 
membrane perforation repair.   Currently all other products act as simple films and do not 
occlude  a perforation.  
 
The p otential benefits described outweigh the low l evel of risk.  
 
3 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
3.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective is to assess the safety of Tympanoseal when used as scaffolding  
during the healing process.   
 
3.2  Secondary Objectives  
The secondary objective is to determine ability / if any adverse events arise from 
implantation of Tympanoseal  such as colonization by [CONTACT_466308][INVESTIGATOR_466292].

8.2 Formulation of  Tympanoseal  
 
Tympanoseal  is formulated from a hydrogel consisting of sodium and calcium mixed salt of 
alginic acid.   The sodium/calcium alginate devices  were constructed using an injection 
molding technique which results in gels composed of  2.7% PronovaTM calcium alginate  and 
1.8% PronovaTM sodium alginate (Melvik et al ., [LOCATION_002] Patent 7,790,600, September 
7,2010).  This gelling methodology is pr oprietary to NovaMatrix, AS of Drammen, NO , and is 
marketed as a self -gelling alginate.  Additional information was provided in Sec tion 1.

 8.3 Packaging and Labeling  
Packaging:  
Tympanoseal  is provided sterile in a protective, transparent nylon capsule inside a 
transparent moisture barrier pouch.  
 
Labeling:   
Each package  of study device will be labeled with the required FDA warning statement, the 
catalog and lot numbers, the name [CONTACT_8152], and directions for patient use and 
storage.  Instructions for Use will also be included.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_597907] of appropriate size.  
 
The lyop hilized device is provided in a protective capsule with four sizes each attached to 
the other with progressively smaller flanges along its length.  The capsule is opened by 
[CONTACT_466309] s larger bottom portion with one hand while carefully  removing 
the smaller top portion  with the other hand .  The device can be easily extracted with 
forceps.  
 
The proper size for a given perforation is excised with surgical scissors or scalpel.  One 
flange will be of a larger diameter than the other; the sur geon will implant the device with 
the larger flange laterally.  Insertion of Tympanoseal  is similar to the placement of a 
tympanostomy  tube.  Immediately after insertion normal saline should be instilled in the 
external auditory canal to swell the device a nd completely occlude the perforation.  
 
After Tympanoseal is in place, wax earplugs should be in place during showers and 
swimming.

11 ADVERSE E VENT  REPORTING AND DOCUMENTATION  
11.1 Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation of  a 
medical device  and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment.  
An AE is therefore any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the administration of an 
investi gational product, whether or not related to that investigational product.   
The Investigator will determine with the subject, the occurrence of AEs during each subject 
visit and record the information in the site’s source documents.  Adverse events will be  
recorded in the patient CRF.  Adverse events will be described by [CONTACT_24109] (start and stop 
dates and times), severity, outcome, treatment and relation to study d evice , or if unrelated, 
the cause.    
 
AE Severity Grading  
The guidelines below  should be used to grade severity.  It should be pointed out that the 
term “severe” is a measure of intensity and that a severe AE is not necessarily serious.  (A 
‘severe’ headache may not be a ‘severe’ AE.)  
The collection period for all AEs will begin after device is impl anted and ends at Subject 
Exit. 
 
Protocol  2015.01 - Rev. B Tympanoseal Research Protocol, Grace Medical, Inc.  Confidential  
 
Version Date: 07/12/2017   Page 22 of 30 
 AE Severity Grading  
Severity  Description  
Mild (1)  Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention or therapy required. The subject may be aware of 
the sign or symptom but tolerates it reasonably well.  
Moderate (2)  Mild to moderate limitation in activity, no or minimal medical 
intervention/therapy required.  
Severe (3)  Marked limitation in activity, medical intervention/therapy 
required ,, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29125].  
Life-threatening (4)  The subject is at risk of death due to the adverse experience as 
it occurred. This does not refer to an experience that 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
 
AE Relationship to Study Device  
The relationship of an AE to the study d evice  should be assessed usi ng the following the 
guidelines.  
Relationship  
to Device  Comment  
Definitely  Previously known toxicity of agent; or an event that follows a reasonable 
temporal sequence from use of the device; that follows a known or expected 
response pattern  
Probably  An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from use of device; 
that follows a known or expected response pattern  and that is unlikely to be 
explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s clinical state or by 
[CONTACT_82978].  
Possibl y An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from use of the 
device; that follows a known or expected response; but that could readily 
have been produced by a number of other factors.  
Unrelated  An event that can be determined with certainty to h ave no relationship to the 
study device.  
11.2 Serious Adverse E vent (SAE)  
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring that results in any of the following outcomes:  
1.  Death 
2.  A life-threatening adverse experience  
3.  An inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
4.  A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
5.  A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
6.  Required Intervention to Prevent Permanent Impairment or Damage  
 
Protocol  2015.01 - Rev. B Tympanoseal Research Protocol, Grace Medical, Inc.  Confidential  
 
Version Date: 07/12/2017   Page 23 of 30 
 Emergency room visits that do not  result in admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_466298] (e.g., life -threatening; required intervention to prevent 
permanent impairment or damage; other serious medically important event).  
 
 
Other important medical eve nts may also be considered an SAE when, based on 
appropriate medical judgment, they jeopardize the subject or require intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed.  
11.3 Serious Adverse E vent Reporting  
Study sites will document all SAEs that occur (w hether or not related to study device).  The 
collection period for all SAEs will begin after device is implanted and ends at Subject Exit.  
In accordance with the standard operating procedures and policies of the local Institutional 
Review Board (IRB), the site investigator wi ll report SAEs to the IRB    within timeframe 
required.   Please notify Grace Medical within [ADDRESS_597918] submit to 
Grace Medical (within 3 business days) and reviewing IRB a report but within [ADDRESS_597919]’s best interest to continue.  The 
following is a partial list of possible reasons for study treatment discon tinuation:  
1.  Subject withdrawal of consent (or assent)  
2.  Lost to or refused follow -up 
3.  Adverse Event or Serious Adverse Event  if investigator feels that it is in the best interest 
of the patient.  
If a subject is withdrawn from treatment due to an adverse event, the subject will be 
followed and treated by [CONTACT_374638].   
All subjects who discontinue study treatment should come in  for an early discontinuation 
visit as soon as possible and then should be encouraged to complete all applicable 
remaining scheduled visits and procedures.  
All subjects are free to withdraw from participation at any time, for any reason, specified or 
unspe cified, and without prejudice.  
Reasonable attempts will be made by [CONTACT_29170] a reason for subject 
withdrawals.  The reason for the subject’s withdrawal from the study will be specified in the 
subject’s source documents.  
 
Protocol  2015.01 - Rev. B Tympanoseal Research Protocol, Grace Medical, Inc.  Confidential  
 
Version Date: 07/12/[ADDRESS_597920]’s best interest to continue.    
The reason for the subject’s withdrawal from the study will  be specified in the subject’s 
source docume nts as well as Study Exit Form

primary endpoint criteria.  Protocol deviations for this study include, but a re not limited to, 
the following:  
1.  Failure to Obtain Informed Consent  
2.  Failure to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria  (Eligibility)  
3.  Failure to maintain study evaluation time  frames for follow -up visits   
Failure to comply with Good Clinical Practice  (GCP) guidelines will also result in a protocol 
deviation.  The Sponsor will determine if a protocol deviation will result in withdrawal of a 
subject.  
When a protocol deviation occurs, it will be discussed with the investigator and a Protocol 
Deviation Fo rm detailing the deviation will be completed.  This form will be signed by a 
Sponsor representative and the Investigator.  A copy of the form will be filed in the site’s 
regulatory binder and in the Sponsor’s files.    
Protocol deviations should also be rep orted  as required  to the site’s IRB . 
 
14 STATISTICAL METHODS AND CONSIDERATIONS  
 
As this study is for safety and utilizing a small number of subjects, no statistical analysis will 
be completed.  Information will be presented to the FDA in tabular format.  
 
Adverse event rates will be coded by [CONTACT_466311], the rate of occurrence, and the severity and relationship to study 
device.    
14.1  Sample Size and Randomization  
Up to 30 subjects wi ll be enrolled in this non -randomized study.  The number of subjects 
was determined by [CONTACT_466312].

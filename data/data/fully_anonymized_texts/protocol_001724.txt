3. Introduction  
The Attain Stability ™ Quad  LV Lead  Clinical Study is a prospective, non -randomized, multi -site, global,  
Investigational Device Exemption (IDE), interventional clinical study. The purpose of this clinical study is  
to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Attain Stability Quad MRI SureScan LV Lead (Model 4798).  This 
study will not be considered investigational in geographies with CE Mark of the Attain Stability  Quad MRI 
SureScan LV  lead (Model 4798). However, data collected from all study subjects will be  represented in 
the PMA Supplement (PMA -S) and all clinical reports.  Subjects successfully implanted with the Attain 
Stability  Quad MRI SureScan LV Lead (Model 4798) will be followe d at implant, three months, six months 
and every six months thereafter until FDA approval is obtained or until study closure, whichever comes 
first. 
 
This Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) has been designed to document, before data is analyzed, the rationale  
for the study design, and the planned analyses related to the primary objective and secondary  objectives . 
Additional analysis of the study data beyond this plan may be conducted to provide evidence further 
supporting the market approval of the lead  and ad ditional publications . The statistical analyses conducted 
for publications and/or ad -hoc requests may not be limited to this document.  
 
The Attain StabilityTM Quad Clinical Study CIP Version 3.0, dated 20 March 2017  was used to create this 
SAP. 
4. Study Objectives  
4.1. Primary objective  
The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety and characterize the efficacy  of the Attain 
Stability Quad MRI SureScan LV Lead (Model 4798) . 
 
Primary Safety Objective: Lead complication -free rate at 6 months  
The Att ain Stability Quad MRI SureScan LV Lead (Model 4798) will be considered safe if the probability of  
subjects free of Model [ADDRESS_658313] -implant is greater than 87%.  
 
Primary Efficacy Objectives: Lead pacing capture thresh olds at 6 months  
To demonstrate the effectiveness of the Attain Stability Quad MRI SureScan LV Lead (Model 4798), the  
study will evaluate the likelihood that there are at least two programmable vectors for each patient post  

056-F286, Statistical Analysis Plan Templat e, Versio n 2.[ADDRESS_658314] be met simultaneously.  
 
Primary Efficacy Objective #1  
The Attain Stability Quad MRI SureScan LV Lead (Model 4798) will meet this objective if the   
proportion of subjects with at least one LV lead pacing vector having a pacing capture threshold  
less than or equal to 2.5 V at 0.5 ms pulse width (with absence of Phrenic Nerve Stimulation  
(PNS) at 5.0 V) at [ADDRESS_658315] -implant is greater than 80%.  
 
Primary Efficacy Objective #2  
The Attain Stability Quad MRI SureScan LV Lead (Model 4798) will meet this objective if the   
proportion of subjects with at least one additional (or second) LV lead pacing vector having a  
pacing capture thre shold less than or equal to 4.0 V at 0.5 ms pulse width (with absence of PNS  
at 5.0 V) at [ADDRESS_658316] -implant is greater than 80%.  
4.2. Secondary  Objectives  
The secondary objectives are descriptive in nature and are intended to provide additional information  
about the Attain Stability Quad MRI SureScan LV Lead (Model 4798). There will be no established  
performance requirements for these secondary objectives.  
o To summarize implant procedure related information: success rate, implant related times   
o To estimate 6 -month reliability: post implant lead failure modes (i.e. complication rate)  
o To estimate electrical measurement values (Pacing Capture Thresholds (PCTs) and Lead 
Impedance) at [ADDRESS_658317] -implant

Allocation : 
Since the Attain StabilityTM Quad Clinical Study  is not a randomized study, all study subjects that are 
enrolled are allo cated t o the intervention (i.e. implanted with Attain StabilityTM Quad Clinical Study ).   
Follow -up: 
All Model [ADDRESS_658321] exiting from the 
study  due, but not limited, to  the following reasons:  
• Study subject withdrawal of consent  
• Study subject death   
• Lost to follow -up 
• Investigator withdr aws subject from the study  
• Other reasons described by [CONTACT_509122]:  
Analys es of study objectives will  be completed for subjects  with valid data entries, e.g.  save-complete 
case report forms  and CEC fully adjudicated adverse events, etc.   If there is missing data that prevents 
the analysis  of a pre -specified objective  then those test subjects will be excluded  from that objective .  
Unless otherwise specified, t here will be no imputation for missing data.  Additional sensitivity analysis will 
be carried out to assess impact of missing data on study objectives.

7.1.2.  CIP Deviations  
Deviations from the CIP will be co llected on the Study Deviation CRF. Deviations will be summarized in 
the final report in a table by [CONTACT_509123]. Deviation codin g will be performed by [CONTACT_13735] . The 
number of deviations per category, and the number and percentage of subjects with a deviation in each 
category will be reported.  
7.1.3.  Analysis Sets  
There will be three analysis sets  used in this study:  
Analysis Set #1 : 
All subjects who undergo Model 4798 lead implant attempt procedure.  
 
Analysis Set #2 : 
All subjects who are successfully implanted with a Model [ADDRESS_658322] implant follow -up visit .  
 
Analysis Set #3 : 
All subj ects who are successfully implanted with a Model [ADDRESS_658323] experienced multiple Model 4798 lead implant proce dures ( e.g. a second lead was implanted 
due to  a system modification of the initialed implanted lead), only first experience will be included for the 
analysis. Multiple lead attempts during this same procedure will not be counted as multiple procedures.   
7.1.4.  Primary  Endpoints  
Primary Safety Endpoint  
The study primary safety endpoint is Attain Stability Quad MRI SureScan LV Lead (Model 4798) related  
complications through [ADDRESS_658324] implant. All reported system and procedure -related adverse events  
will be  reviewed by [CONTACT_509124] . 
 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint #1  
The Model 4798 LV lead has sixteen (16) programmable pacing vectors. The endpoint for the primary  
efficacy objective is whether there is at least one Model 479 8 LV lead pacing vector with pacing capture 
voltage thresholds less than or equal to 2.5V (with absence of PNS at 5.0 V). This endpoint will  be 
measured at the [ADDRESS_658325] implant follow -up visit.  
 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint #2  
The co -primary efficacy endp oint is whether a second Model 4798 lead configuration has a pacing  
capture threshold less than or equal to 4V (with absence of PNS at 5.0 V), excluding the pacing vector  
that is already counted to the primary efficacy endpoint #1. This endpoint will be me asured at [ADDRESS_658326] measured at pulse width ≤ 0.5 ms

Statistical Analysis Plan  
 7.1.5.  Secondary Endpoints  
To summarize implant procedure related information  
Implant procedure related endpoints will include implant success rate and procedure durations.  
 
To estimate 6 -month reliability  
The Model 4798 LV lead 6 -month reliability endpoint is Model 4798 lead related complications.   
 
To estimate electrical measurement values (PCTs and Lead  Impedance) at [ADDRESS_658327] -
implant  
The electrical measurements endpoints are pacing capture thresholds and  impedance values collected at  
each time point (i.e. Implant, 6 months, etc.).    
7.2. Center Pooling  
The Attain StabilityTM Quad Clinical  Study is expected to be conducted at up to 5 6 sites worldwide, with a 
total enrollment of 471 subjects across all study centers. Participating geographies are expected to 
include, but are not limited to: the [LOCATION_002]  (US), Canada, E MEA, Malaysia , and Hong Kong . Per the 
CIP, each center will enro ll between 0 and 50 subjects.  
The primary analysis for all study objectives will include valid d ata entries  from all study sites. In 
additional, sensitivity analysis will be conducted to assess in characteristics of each region and/or study 
site impact the overall study results. Specifically, t his analysis will investigate whether sites exhibit 
significant heterogeneity in event rates, and whether geography (a binary variable representing whether 
a site is located in the US or outside [LOCATION_002] (OUS) ) moderates any statistically significant 
heterogeneity that is observed. Models will be fit separately for each primary outcome; in the analysis of 
each, centers within the US having ≤5 subjects with complete data will be considered as coming from 
one center, here denoted as ‘US small’ . Similarly, `OUS small’ will be the collection of data from centers 
outside the US having ≤5 subjects with complete data . If a Cochran’s Q -test for heterogeneity shows 
p<0.05, it will be taken as evidence of significant hete rogeneity between sites. Evidence of between -site 
heterogeneity will not necessarily preclude pooling data; rather, it will prompt further investigation into 
the sources of the apparent differences in event rates between sites. At a minimum, findings of an alyses 
on heterogeneity between study sites and between all US and OUS sites will be shown in the final report 
in a table by [CONTACT_77433].  
In addition, s ummary statistics for baseline characteristics and primary endpoints by [CONTACT_509125] . See examples below (actual format may vary).

Unless otherwise specified, i f data is missing then there will be no imputation of the data.  Instead, 
subjects with missing data will be excluded.   Survival analyses will consider time to event censored at the 
last contact [CONTACT_92423] -up subjects.  
7.4. Adjustments for Multiple Comparisons  
No adjustments will be made for multiple comparisons.  
7.5. Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics

collected will include , but not limited to,  subject age, gender , body mass index (BMI), left ventricular 
ejection fraction (LVEF), intrinsic QRS duration, [LOCATION_001] Heart Association ( NYHA ) class and medical 
history . Tables and descriptive statistics will be used to summarize subject data with respect to these 
variables. For quantitative variables, the mean, standard deviation, median, first and third quartiles, 
minimum and maximum wil l be presented. For qualitative variables, counts and percentages will be given . 
 
Sensitivity analysis will also be carried out using a similar method as outlined in section 7.[ADDRESS_658330] gender affects overall study outcome.  
7.6. Treatment Characteristics  
Statistical s ummaries for  treatment characteristic variables (on the LV Lead Implant Procedure CRF ) will 
be reported. Continuous variables will be reported as mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, 
maximum, and quartiles . Categorical variables will be reported as number and percentage of subjects.  
The procedure variables to be summarized  will includ e, but not limited to , CRT implant timing, operative 
time, LV lead implant timing, number of LV lead implant attempts, reason for being unable to implant the 
LV lead, diameter of the cardiac vein at final LV lead tip position, final location of LV tip elec trode, final 
location of helix , final vector programmed for LV pacing configuration, reason for choosing final 
programmed vector .

 7.7. Interim Analyses  
The study protocol specified one non-formal interim analysis for secondary objective #2 (6 -month 
reliabili ty). See Section 7.8.4 for details.  No formal  interim analysis is planned for study primary 
objectives; or other secondary objectives.  
7.8. Evaluation of  Objectives  
7.8.1.  Primary Safety Objective  
The Attain StabilityTM Quad  MRI SureScan LV Lead (Model 4798) will be considered safe if the probability 
of subjects free of Model [ADDRESS_658331] -implant is greater than 87%  
(i.e., the lower bound of a one -sided 97.5% confidence interval must be greater than 87%).  
 
                                                          Hypothesis:  
H0: S(6-month) ≤ 87%  
H1: S(6-month) > 87%  
 
where S 6-month is the probability that a subject remains free from Model 4798 lead related complications  
through 6 months since implant.  
 
Analysis Dataset:  
Analysis set # 1 per section 7.1.3.   
Analysis Method:  
A standard  time to first event survival analysis type will be performed to investigate the hypothesis 
proposed in the primary safety objective. More specifically, t he Kapl an-Meier method will be used to 
estimate the probability of a subject surviving from any Model 4798 lead -related complication  as a 
function of time; the 1-sided 97.5% confidence limit lower bound for the survival probability at 6 months 
(183 days) will be calculated using the log -log survival function approach (Kalbfleisch and Prentice 
2002)2. For the purposes of this analysis, t ime [ADDRESS_658332] undergoes the implant 
procedure of the Attain Stability Quad MRI SureScan LV Lead (Model 479 8), which is independent of 
success status of this implant procedure. For the survival analysis, an event is defined as an Attain 
Stability Quad MRI SureScan LV Lead (Model 4798) related complication according to Clinical Events 
Committee (CEC) adjudicatio n. Event date  is the onset date of a subject’s first complication that is related 
to the Attain Stability Quad MRI SureScan LV Lead (Model 4798) . The definition of “complication” and “LV 
lead related” can be found on the study CIP.  Subjects who undergo an Attain Stability Quad MRI 
SureScan LV Lead (Model 4798) implant attempt and do not experience any LV lead related complications 
will have their time to event  censored at their last known time to exposure to the initial Attain Stability 
Quad MRI SureScan LV Lead (Model 4798). For any lost to follow -up subject, the last contact [CONTACT_509127].  
 
Additional Analysis:  
Sensitivity analyses  will be performed to assess the robustness of the results . In par ticular,

Statistical Analysis Plan  
 • In the event a site investigator disagrees with the CEC’s classification of an event, site 
investigator’s event classification will be disclosed, however only CEC final adjudication results will 
be used for the statistical analysis.  In the event when CEC final adjudication of relatedness of an 
event is “unknown”, the “worst -case” scenario analysis will be carried out where the event will be 
counted as a lead related event in addition to the primary analysis of this objective.  
 
• A tippi[INVESTIGATOR_509117] . In particular,  subjects having time to event 
censored before 6 months will be considered one -by-one (by [CONTACT_509128]) as observed events.  
Therefore,  the 6-month survival intervals will be calculated for all scenarios i n which a censored 
subject becomes an event.  
• A similar survival analysis will be performed , but considering the first [ADDRESS_658333] 200 subjects will be selected based on the date of implant. In case of a tie (for the 200th 
position) among subjects  who are implanted on the same day, the initial proc edure time 
(converted to U.S. central time) will be used to select the first 200 subjects.  
7.8.2.  Primary Efficacy  Objective  
To demonstrate the effectiveness of the Attain Stability Quad MRI SureScan LV Lead (Model 4798), the  
study will evaluate the likelihood that there are at least two programmable vectors for each patient post  
implant . The effectiveness of this lead will be evaluated based on two primary efficacy objectives. Both 
primary efficacy objectives must be met simultaneously.  
 
Primary Efficacy Objective #1  
The Attain Stability Quad MRI SureScan LV Lead (Model 4798) will meet t his objective if the  
proportion  of subjects with at least one LV lead pacing vector having a pacing capture threshold  
less than or equal to 2.5 V at 0.5 ms pulse width (with absence of Phrenic Nerve Stimulation  
(PNS) at 5.0 V) at [ADDRESS_658334] -implant is g reater than 80%.  
 
Hypothesis  
H0: P1 6-month ≤ 80%  
HA: P1 6-month > 80%  
 
where P1 6-month is the proportion  of subjects with pacing voltage thresholds ≤ 2.5V at 0.5ms (with  
absence of PNS at 5.0 V) at [ADDRESS_658335] one LV lead pacing 
vector.  
 
Primary Efficacy Objective #2  
The Attain Stability Quad MRI SureScan LV Lead (Model 4798) will meet this objective if the  
proportion of subjects having the two following condition s satisfied at the 6 -month follow -up visit 
is greater than 80%:  
 
o At least two  LV lead pacing vectors having PCT less than or equal to 4.[ADDRESS_658336] less than or equal to 2.5 V  at 0.5 ms pulse 
width  and absence of PNS at 5.0V  
 
 
Hypothesis  
H0: P2 6-month ≤ 80%  
HA: P2 6-month > 80%  
 
where P2 6-month is the proportion  of subjects  meeting  the two conditions above.

 Analysis Dataset:  
Analysis set # 2 per section 7.1.3.   
Analysis Method:  
The lower bound of the 1 -sided 97.5% Confidence Interval  for P16-month and P2 6-month will be calculated 
using the Clopper -Pearson method.  More specifically,  
• For th e primary efficacy objective #[ADDRESS_658337] one vector with pacing 
voltage thresholds ≤ 2.5V at 0.5ms and absence of PNS at 5.0 V.  
 
• For the primary efficacy objective #2, the number of successes observed is defined as the 
number of subjects who had a) at least two LV lead pacing vectors having PCT less than or equal 
to 4.0 V and absence of PNS at 5.0V b) At least one LV lead pacing vector having PCT l ess than 
or equal to 2.5 V at 0.5 ms and absence of PNS at 5.0 V . 
For both objectives, only Model 4798 lead successfully implanted subjects who had the 6 -month follow -up 
and performed the PNS testing will be considered.  
 
Additional Analysis:  
Sensitivity analyses will be performed to assess the robustness of the results . In particular,  
• A tippi[INVESTIGATOR_509118].  
 
• Repeat these analyses using  the first [ADDRESS_658338] implant follow -up visit. In case 
of a tie (for the 200th position) among subjects who are implanted on the same day, the ini tial 
procedure time (converted to U.S. central time) will be used to select the first 200 subjects.    
7.8.3.  Secondary  Objective # [ADDRESS_658339] secondary  objective is  to summarize implant proce dure information . 
Analysis Dataset:  
Analysis set #1  per section 7.1.3.   
Analysis Method:  
Descriptive statistics will be computed. The Attain Stability Quad LV lead implant success rate will be 
estimated as the number of subjec ts with Attain Stability Quad MRI SureScan LV Lead (Model 4798) 
successfully implanted divided by [CONTACT_509129] (Model 4798) implant attempt. A 2 -sided 95% Confidence Interval will be 
calculated using the Clopper -Pearson  method.   
Procedure times are collected via eCRF. Only subjects with the Attain Stability Quad MRI  
SureScan LV Lead (Model 4798) successfully implanted will be included in this calculation.  
 
• The total implant procedu re time is defined as time from initial incision to final skin closure.  
• Fluoroscopy time is defined as the total time the fluoroscope is imaging.  
• Cannulation time is defined as the time from insertion of the first CS cannulation catheter to the 
first successful CS cannulation.  
• Successful lead placement time is defined as the time from lead insertion of the successfully 
placed lead to the time when the lead is placed in its first acceptable pacing location.  If a subject

 experienced multiple implant attempts  during the same procedure, only the final successful 
attempt will be included in this analysis.  
 
Statistical summaries (e.g. mean, standard devia tion, min, max, median) will be compute for these 
procedure time s. 
7.8.4.  Secondary  Objective # [ADDRESS_658340] implant lead failure through 6 
months for each individual failure type (e.g. lead dislodgement , infection, device capturing issue).  
 
Analysis Dataset:  
To proactively address FDA reviewer’s potential questions a t the time of PMA -s submission,  two 
approaches will be considered : (a) standard frequentist approach and (b) Bayesian approach borrowing 
information from historical datasets. Per FDA requirement, the study reports will provide standard 
frequentist estimates as primary results. The analysis dataset will consist of all su bjects successfully 
implanted with the Attain Stability Quad MRI SureScan LV Lead (Model 4798) and who completed at least  
6-month follow -up or experienced  lead failure prior to 6 -months  (i.e. Analysis set #3  per section 7.1.3.).   
For the Bayesian approach, analysis will be performed using data from the first 360 subjects successfully 
implanted with the Attain Stability Quad MRI SureScan LV Lead (Mod el 4798) and who completed the 6 -
month follow -up. In addition, the Bayesian approach will use historical datasets from the Attain Stability 
and Attain Performa clinical studies, described in more detail below.  
 
Analysis Method:  
Standard Frequentist Approac h 
For each lead failure mode, the Attain Stability Quad LV lead failure rate will be estimated as the number 
of subjects with Attain Stability Quad MRI SureScan LV Lead (Model 4798) failure before 6 months (183 
days) divided by [CONTACT_509130] (Model 4798) successfully implanted and who completed  at least  the [ADDRESS_658341] -implant . A 2 -sided 95% Confidence Interval will be 
calculated using the Clopper -Pearson  method.  
 
Bayesian Approach  
The Bayesian analysis will be conducted as a virtual adaptive study.  The interim look dataset will be 
constructed as it would have been available after the 360th patient was enrolled, and the additional 
enrollment will be computed. The final analysis will be conducted using only the data from the interim 
and additional enrollment, along with the historical prior data, to simulate the results of an adaptive 
study.  
 
Methodology  
Historical data from the Attain Stability and Attain Performa Clinical studies will be incorporated using the 
power prior methodology with a discount function3. A maximum weight of 37 effective patients will be

 given to the historical data, eq ual to the number of subjects in the Attain Stability OUS study that had 
follow up data at six months or longer with an Attain Stability lead. Historical data will be scaled to create 
an effective weight of 37 patients in the case of the Attain Performa hi storical data because the actual 
study enrolled 401 patients.  
The Attain Stability data will be applied only to complications associated with lead fixation: dislodgement 
and perforation.  There were 0 events for 37 patients in the Attain Stability study. T he Attain Performa 
data will be applied to all other complications.  There were 10 non -fixation complications in the Attain 
Performance study, out of 401 patients.  
There are three steps in the methodology:  
1. Compare the historical and current data to creat e a measure of similarity, 𝑝 
2. Compute the effective sample size 𝑎0 of the historical data using a discount function based on 
the level of similarity  
3. Combine the historical data 𝑦0 and current data 𝑦 using the calculated weight 𝑎0 to get the 
combined da ta set 𝑦+𝑎0𝑦0 
These three steps are performed at the interim analysis and at the final analysis.  
Comparison  
Let y and y0 be the number of events that occur for the current data and historical data respectively and 
let n and n0 be the total number of su bjects for the current and historical studies that reach the [ADDRESS_658342] erior distribution of θ̃ and θ0 for the current data and historical data, 
respectively, both with minimally informative priors.  Calculate θ as: 
 
θ̃~𝑏𝑒𝑡𝑎 (y+1,n−y+1)        (1) 
𝜃0~𝑏𝑒𝑡𝑎 (𝑦0+1,𝑛0−𝑦0+1)      (2) 
 
We can stochastically compare the distribution of θ̃ to θ0 as follows : 
 
𝑝=𝑃(θ̃≤𝜃0|𝑦,𝑛,𝑦0,𝑛0) (3) 
 
Equation (3) can be calculated by [CONTACT_740] m samples of θ̃  and  𝜃ℎ  from (1) and (2) (i.e.  
 𝜃1̃ ,𝜃2̃… 𝜃𝑚̃ and θ01,θ02…θ0m  ) 
𝑝=𝑃(θ̃≤𝜃0)=1
𝑚∑𝐼{θ̃𝑖<𝜃0𝑖} 
 
The resulting p -value is then used to compute the discount  function.  
Compute the discount function  
The weight of the historical data will be computed with a discount function based on the measure of 
similarity 𝑝.  The historical data will be scaled f rom 0 to 37 effective patients as:

The discount function for the Attain Stability data set is given below:  
 
Figure 2: Loss function a0̂ =𝟏−𝒆−(𝒑∗𝟓)𝟐 
 
Combine the current and historical data  
Let 𝑦 and 𝑦0 be the number of event s that occur for the current data and historical data respectively and 
let 𝑛 and 𝑛0 be the total number of subjects for the current and historical studies that reach the 6 month 
time point or had an event.  Following the work of Ibrahim and Chen [1], the posterior probability  for 
event  rate 𝜃 using the power prior is given as:  
𝑃(𝜃|𝑦,𝑛,𝑦0,𝑛0,a0̂ )=𝑏𝑒𝑡𝑎 (𝛼,𝛽) 
                                                     where  
𝛼=𝑦+a0̂ 𝑦0+1 
𝛽=(𝑛−𝑦)+a0̂ (𝑛0−𝑦0)+[ADDRESS_658343] completed the 
full evaluation period. A longitudinal model will be employed to enable final observations to be imputed 
for those subjects with incomplete information.  
There are 3 types of subjects at a given interim analysis:  
1. Subjects that have complete data  
2. Subjects that have partial data (censored value at a particular time)  
3. Subjects that have no information (subjects that have not been enrolled)  
We will construct predictive probabilities for types [ADDRESS_658344] rate using closed form conjugacy. Therefore, the posterior is also a gamma distribution.   
We partition duration time into 3 int ervals  across six months (0 -2, 2-4, and 4 -6 months)  and assume the 
hazard is constant within each interval. The event times are therefore modeled as:

 Tevent ~ PE(1,2,3) 
where 1,2,[ADDRESS_658345] a high probability of  meeting the required effective sample size of 𝑛𝑒𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 =400 (after accounting 
for attrition). The effective sample size is the sum of enrolle d patients and effective historical patients at 
the final analysis. The interim analysis may result in as few as 363 patients enrolled.  This study follows 
methods from Berry, et.al.4  
Adaptive Bayesian sample size algorithm : 
1. If the predictive probability of 𝑛𝑒≥400 is larger than 80% then enrollment will stop.  
2. If the predictive probability of 𝑛𝑒≥400 is less than 80%, enroll sufficient additional 
patients to make the probability of 𝑛𝑒≥[ADDRESS_658346] 80%.   
Final Analysis  
The final analysis will be performed using the 6 -month data from the patients enrolled at the interim 
analysis time point, along with the 6 -month data from the number of additional patients resulting from 
the interim analysis.  The same three steps (Compare , Compute, Combine) will be performed to 
incorporate the historical data sources.  
The estimates for rates of lead failure modes will be presented as a point estimate and 95% credible 
intervals.  
7.8.5.  Secondary Objective #[ADDRESS_658347] secondary objective aims to estimate electrical measurement values (PCTs and Lead 
Impedance) at [ADDRESS_658348] -implant . 
Analysis Dataset:  
Analysis set #2 per section 7.1.3.   
Analysis Method:  
Mean, standard deviation, minimum, median and maximum for PCTs and lead pacing impedance at the  
6-month follow -up visit will be presented  for the final programmed LV lead pacing polarity . In addition, 
the frequency of each LV lead pacing polarity being used  at the final programmed configurations will be 
presented.  
Electrical values may be collected via eCFR and  Save-to-Media files (i.e. Save -to-Diskette and Carelink 
Transmissions). The statistical analysis will prioritize documented values from eCRF over sav e-to-media 
data. If discrepancies of over 1 volt is identified comparing values from two data sources, data queries 
may be initiated for resolution.

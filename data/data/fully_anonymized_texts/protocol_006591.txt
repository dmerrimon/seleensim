TITLE:  
A 6-Week, Randomized, Evaluator Blinded, in vivo  
within Subject Repeat Test to Evaluate the Irritation and Sensitization Potential of OmezaTM 
Collagen Matrix in Healthy Volunteers  
PROTOCOL NUMBER:  
OMZRIP1F  
OBJECTIVES:  
To assess th e sensi tization potential  of OmezaTM Collagen Matrix compared to that of a 
negative control (0.9% sodium chloride, NaCl) us ing [ADDRESS_98178] period, and a c hallenge  
phase of approximately 48 hours exposure with evaluations over 7 2 (+2) hours.  
The secondary objective is to assess the safet y of OmezaTM Collagen Matrix by m onitoring 
adverse events through out the study . 
POPULATION:  
A sufficient number of subjects  will be qualified for the  study to randomize approx imately 60 
subjects with th e intention that a minimum  of 50 subjects will comple te the challenge phase.   
STUDY DESIG N AND DURATION:  
The study de sign is based on a Modified Draize  Human Repeat Ins ult Patch Test. This is a  single 
site, evaluator -blind ed study us ing a within -subject randomized design. Each subject will 
receive  all inves tigational products at the  same t ime. The t rained skin evaluator and 
Investigator will be blinded to the identity of the test materials. The investigational products will 
be OmezaTM  Collagen Matrix an d a negative control (0.9 % aqueous so dium chloride). The  
study will inv olve repetit ive an d co ntinuo us patch applications of all investigational products 
to the same test sites on the back approximately [ADDRESS_98179] period of 10 – [ADDRESS_98180] to naïve  sites for a pproximately 48 hours. Eval uation s of the c hallenge 
sites will be made at  approximately 30 minutes, 24 ( +1), 48 ( +2), and 72  (+2) hours post 
removal. The study will require 1 5 visits to th e testing facility .  Total study duration after 
screening will be ap proximately 5 -6 week s for each subjec t.

DOSAGE FORMS AND ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION:  
• Investigational Product  : 
 Approximately 0.2 ml of OmezaTM Collagen  Matrix  – Batch no. PVP8  
• Control  Product : 
Approximately  0.2 ml of 0.9% aqueous NaCl  
The patc h system  will be  patc h pads made f rom Webril ® and affixed with an occ lusive 
hypoallergenic tape , unless the ski n condition becomes sufficiently  irritated to r equire a 
change to a semi -occlusive  tape or even an open dressing, at the discretion of the 
investigator.   Additio nal t ape may be us ed to ensure patches stay adhered to the test sites.    
EVALUATION OF IRRITATION AND SENSITIZATION:  
All subjects will be evalu ated using the Sk in Irritation Sc ale: 
Inflammatory Responses:  
0 = No visible reaction  
+ = Slight, confluent or p atchy  erythema  
1 = Mild erythema (pi[INVESTIGATOR_8745])  
2 = Moderate erythema (definite redness)  
3 = Strong erythema (very intense redness)  
Definition of letter  grades appended to a numerical grade:  
E     =  Edema - swelling, spongy feeling when p alpated  
P     =  Papu le - red, s olid, pi[INVESTIGATOR_89327] t elevation  
V     =  Vesicle - small elevat ion containing fluid  
B     =  Bulla reaction - fluid-filled lesion (blister)  
S     =  Spreading - evide nce o f the reaction beyond the Webril pad area  
W    =  Weepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] - resul t of a vesicular or bulla react ion - serous exudate  
I      =       Induration - solid, elevated, hardened, thickened skin  
Superficial Effects  
g     =  Glazing  
y     =  Peeling 
c     =  Scab , dried film of serous exudate of vesicular or bulla reaction  
d     =  Hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371] ( reddish -brow n discolorati on of test site)  
h     =  Hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371] (loss of visible pi[INVESTIGATOR_89328])  
f      =     Fissuring grooves in the su perficial layers of the skin  
All skin responses observed with the investigational pro ducts during the ind uction a nd 
challenge phase s will be reported.  Skin responses to eac h patch application will be 
examined and graded u nder light supplied by a [ADDRESS_98181] sites , but a qualified back -up 
individual will be available if need ed.   
Individual inves tigational products during the induction phase will be applied t o the assigned 
PRINCETON CONSUMER RESEA RCH: OMZRIP1F  [ADDRESS_98182] ions become so strong as to make it inadvi sable. If excessive 
irritation, (for example, a n umer ical score of 2 or greater) i s noted, that sit e wil l be 
discontinued from further patching  and a new site adjacent to the original site will  be used  for 
the rema inder of the required applications.  If excessive irritation occurs at the move  site, a 
second move  site may be used. Excess ive irritation at  the sec ond move site would require 
discontinuation of that investigational product . 
The challeng e pat ches  will be applied to naïve sites on the o pposite side of the back for 
approximately 48 hours. Challen ge sites will be evaluated  approximately  30 minute s, 24 (±1), 
48 (±2) and 72 (±2) hours after patch removal.  Evaluatio n of the test articles for t he po tential 
to se nsitize should include the  site scores as well as a narrative description of any reaction a nd 
an opi[INVESTIGATOR_89329] a contact 
[CONTACT_89346].  
Phot os will b e taken of any reactions of conce rn and will b e shared with the sponsor  but will 
not be part of the final report . 
SAFETY ASSESSMENTS:  
Safety will be as sessed by [CONTACT_89347].  
STATISTICAL ANALYSES:  
Data from the individual patch sites is pre sente d in tabular format.  No statistical an alysis of the 
data will be  performe d. 
SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION:  
Based on prior experience with contact s ensitization studies in humans approximately 60 
subjects will be randomized to ensur e 50 subjects completi ng th e study.   There is no statistical 
calculation of sample size for this study.  
SITES:  
This study will be conducted at 1 site located in the [LOCATION_002] .

discontinued from further patching  and a new site adj acent to  the original site will be used for 
the remainder of the required applications  (move site 1) .  If excessi ve irritation occurs at the 
move  site, a second move  site may be used. Excessive irritation at the second move site would 
require discontinuati on of th at pa tch.  Residue on the skin from any test patch  will be removed 
by [CONTACT_89355] (if observed)  by [CONTACT_89356][INVESTIGATOR_89334] a moistened gauze pa d.

4.5 Treatment Accountability and Compliance  
Since all tes t products are to be administered in -clinic,  100% compliance is anticipated. 
Subjec ts are required to attend all visits . 
4.6 Blinding and Unb linding Method  
Study products will be adminis tered in a singl e-blinded fashion, i.e., the treat ment assignment 
will not  be known to the skin evaluator.

6.6 Skin Assessments and Procedures  
All subjects will be evalua ted using the Skin Irritatio n Sca le: 
Inflammatory Responses:  
0 = No visible reaction  
+ = Sligh t, confluent or patchy erythema  
1 = Mild ery thema (pi[INVESTIGATOR_8745])  
2 = Moderate erythema (definite redness)  
3 = Strong erythema (very intense redness)  
Definition  of letter g rades appended to a numeric al gr ade:  
E     =  Edema - swelling, spongy feeling when palp ated  
P     =  Papu le - red, solid, pi[INVESTIGATOR_89335] 
V     =  Vesicle - small elevat ion containing fluid  
B     =  Bulla reaction - fluid-filled lesion (blister ) 
S     =  Spreading - evidence of the r eacti on beyond the Webril pad area  
W    =  Weepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] - result o f a vesicular or bulla reaction -  serous exudate  
I      =  Induration - solid, elevated, hardened, thickened skin  
Superficial Effects  
g     =  Glazing  
y     =  Peel ing 
c     =  Scab, dried film of s erous  exudate of vesicular or bulla reaction  
d     =  Hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371]  (reddish -brown disco loration of test si te) 
h     =  Hypopi [INVESTIGATOR_371] (loss of visible pi[INVESTIGATOR_89328])  
f      =     Fissuring groove s in the sup erficial layers of the skin  
 
All skin responses observed during the i nduction and challeng e phases will be reported.  Skin 
responses to each pa tch application will be exa mined an d graded unde r light supplied by  a 
100-watt incandescent blue bulb.  The e valuator and Investigator will be bli nded to treatment 
assignment and any  previous scores.  Th e same individual will conduct all sk in evaluations o f 
the test sites , but a qua lified b ack-up individ ual will be availab le if neede d.   
Individual investigationa l products during the induction phase  will be applied to t he assigned 
skin site unless the sit e reactions become so strong as to mak e it inadvisabl e. If excessive 
irritation,  (for ex ample, a numer ical score of 2 or greater  or any grade(even 0 ) if appen ded 
with a letter grade  of E, P, V or B ) is noted, that site will be discont inued from further patching  
and a new site adjacent to the o riginal site wi ll be used for the remainde r of the  required 
applications.  If excessive irrit ation occurs at the move  site, a second move  site may be used.  
Exces sive irritation at the second move site would require di scontinuation of that patch 
material.

 The challenge pa tches will be applied to na ïve site s on the opposite side of the back for 
appr oximately 48 hour s. Challenge sites will be evaluated appro ximately  30 mi nutes, 24 (±1 ), 
48 (± 2) and 72 ( ±2) hours after patch removal.  Evaluation of the test articles for the p otential 
to sensitize shou ld includ e a review of the induction site s cores as well as the challenge site 
scores and a narrative description of any  reac tion observed at chal lenge will be recorde d.

6.7 Randomization  and/or Treatment Assignment  
To elim inate any position bias, the assignment of the  test product  code  to the test sites will be 
randomized among th e sub jects so tha t each test product  code occupi[INVESTIGATOR_89337] h equal frequency.  
6.8 Assessment of Sensitization  
Subjects who  had all 9 i nduction patches and completed the challenge phase ( at least the 
24-hour po st ch allenge skin assessment) will be consid ered evalua ble subjects for the study. 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_89338] s.  The induction of d ermal  sensitization is 
determined by  [CONTACT_89359] t 
observed during Induction. Low grad e reactions observed during Induction,  but which are not  
observed at Challenge are considered to be irritant in  natu re. 
An erythematous and edematous reaction to the test article  (and none to the negative 
contr ol) during Challenge  is indicative of dermal s ensitization.   Usually  the skin irritation s core  
response is great er than  scores observed during induction  phase and often spreads outside of 
the pat ch site.   If sensitization is suspected , a full descr iption of the skin responses observed wi ll 
be document ed and reported in the final report . 
[ADDRESS_98204] code to each treatment site . 
7.2 Statistical Analysis  
Data from the individual pa tch site s will be  presented  tabular format.  No statistical analysis of 
the data will be  perfo rmed . 
 
8 ADVERSE  EVENT /EXPE RIENC E MONITORING  
8.1 Definition  
An Adverse Event/Experience  is any unexpected o r undesirable experience occurring  to a 
subject during a study, which may or may not be related to the test device. All adverse events 
will be recorded and reported acc ording to th e Sta ndard Operating Procedu res of Princeton 
Consumer R esearch . 
PRINCETON CONSUMER RESEARCH: OMZRIP1 F                   29 Octo ber 2019  
Final Protocol   Page 20 of 23 
 Events should be considered AEs if they:  
• resul t in discontinuation  from the study,  
• require treatment or any other therapeutic intervention,  
• require further dia gnostic evaluation (ex cluding  a repeti tion of the same procedure 
to confirm the abnormal ity), 
• are associated with clinical signs or symptoms ju dged by [CONTACT_89360] a 
significant clinical impact.  
An Adverse Event is not:  
• A surgical procedure  
• A situation where an unto ward ev ent did n ot occur, (e.g. a social hosp italization)  
• Baseline  conditions that have not worsened in severity or frequ ency  
Skin irritation  is expected and graded at Visits 3 – 23 and wil l not be reported as an adverse 
event unless it leads to withdrawal  from t he study.  
A Serious Adverse Event/Expe rience  is any adverse  experience occurring that results in any of 
the follow ing outcomes:  
* deat h; 
* a life -threatening adverse experience;  
* inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27588] ; 
* a persistent  or significant disability/in capacity;  
* a congeni tal anomaly/birth defect  
Important medical event/experi ences that may not r esult in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious a dverse experience when , based  upon 
appropriate medical judgment, th ey may jeopardize the  patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical  intervention to pre vent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
An Unexpected Adverse Event/Experience  is any adverse event/exp erience  not listed in the 
current labeling fo r the test device.  
8.[ADDRESS_98205]’s final 
visit, however, if an investigator lea rns of an SAE that is believe d to be p ossibly related to the 
study products, an SAE r eport form should be submitted.  
8.3 Notification  
The Sponsor w ill be notified of all adverse event/experiences. Any Serious or  Unexpected 
Adverse Event/Experience which occurs  during the study must  be rep orted pro mptly by [CONTACT_89361] r eviewing IRB, as applicable, within 24 hours of the 
information being repor ted to Princeton Consumer Research . 
PRINCETON CONSUMER RESEARCH: OMZRIP1 F                   [ADDRESS_98206] igator will evaluate the seve rity of each AE. Adve rse events will be graded as  
Mild:   Awareness of sympto ms but easily tolerat ed  
Moderate:   Discomfort enough to interfere with but not prevent daily activity  
Severe:   Unable to perform usual  activity  
8.5 Relationship  
The Investigator will judge the likelihood that the AE was related to the study products 
acco rding  to the following crite ria 
Not related:  There is no temporal or causal rela tionship to the study products.  
Relat ed:  There is a possib le temporal  or causal rela tionship to the stu dy products.  
8.6 Action T aken and Outcome  
The Action Taken with study products f or every AE will be repo rted as either: Dose Not 
Changed, Dose Interrupted, or Dose Withdrawn. Other actions take n can include none, 
medication re quire d, or other intervention docu mented on the AE. The Outcome of each AE 
will be entered as either: Recovere d/Resolved, Recovered/Re solved with Sequelae, Not 
Recovered/Not Resolved, Fatal, or Unknown.

BACKGROUND:  
 
Benign essential blepharospasm (BEB) is a foca l dystonia characterized by [CONTACT_143169].[ADDRESS_162813] on the quality of life.2 Due to repeated 
involuntary closure of eyes , in severe cases , patients become functionally blind despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a normal visual acuity. 
Chemodenervation with botulinum neurotoxin  (BoNT)  injections administered every [ADDRESS_162814] patients 
report ing benefits lasting only about 8-10 weeks.4, 5 We conducted a retrospective analysis of BEB  patients  at our 
movement disorders center that has followed over 250 patients (manuscript submitted ) and  found  that the average 
duration of benefit s from  BoNT injections  was about 9.[ADDRESS_162815]-line therapy for BEB  shows  suboptimal benefits in many patien ts. Therefore, there  
is a clear  merit in exploring  other options that can potentiate and possibly prolong the  effects of BoNT injections . 
 
 
rTMS refers to application of repetitious t ranscra nial magnetic stimulation (TMS)  pulses to a specific brain target 
at predefined stimulation parameters . We propose a novel approach  of combining  rTMS therapy  with BoNT 
injections  in BEB . The primary goal  of this study is to compare the standard treatment with BoNT versus BoNT 
combined with  a two week course of rTMS  therapy. The central hypothesis  is that rTMS therapy potentiates and 
prolongs the  effects of BoNT therapy  in BEB .  rTMS therapy has shown beneficial results in many neurological 
and psychiatric conditions.6,[ADDRESS_162816] the anterior cingulate 
cortex (ACC) as the target of stimulation . ACC  has been proposed by [CONTACT_143170] s of pathology 
in BEB . Anatomically  in monkey studies, the ACC has been shown to have clear projections to the upper facial 
muscles.[ADDRESS_162817] Hallett’s lab tested the effects of rTMS of the ACC in BEB. So far to date this is the only 
rTMS study  that is  available for review in literature. These investigators found that  a single session of low 
frequency rTMS delivered to the ACC had positive clinical benefits though lasting only  for about one hour .[ADDRESS_162818] several  weeks.  For example, in a 
recent double blind randomized controlled study, low frequency rTMS delivered over eight weeks to Parkinson’s 
disease patients showed  positive clinical benefits that lasted [ADDRESS_162819]  
BoNT  treatment, the peak -dose benefits are seen at about 4 -6 weeks after the administration of injections. We 
plan to introduce rTMS during  this peak -dose period ( about 6 weeks after BoNT or T1). We will examine the 
effects of combined therapy at about 10 week s after BoNT injections (T2) and at about 12 weeks after BoNT 
injections ( T3). We will also measure the physiological effects at these time points.  We will use the blink reflex 
recovery (BRR) curve  that reflects the brain stem excitability. An increased B RR indicates  that there is increased 
excitability of facial moto r neurons and bulbar interneurons.  BRR  has been shown to be increased in a significant 
proportion of patients with BEB.19,20 According to the animal model of blepharospasm, o ne of the underlying 
mechanisms for increased BRR is that a  loss of dopamine -containing neurons in the substantia n igra pars 
compacta causes  a decreased inhibition in the blink circui t.21 
 
In summary, BEB is a functionally disabling focal dystonia. BoNT therapy is suboptimal in many BEB patients. 
rTMS therapy is a promising noninvasive therapy and has shown positive benefits in BEB. rTMS  therapy can be 
 
 
Protocol Version 08/10/[ADDRESS_162820] pi[INVESTIGATOR_143166]. The specific aims for the proposal are:   
 
Aim 1: Clinical impact of rTMS therapy in BEB .  
We will  determine the clinical effects  of 0.2 Hz rTMS therapy  of the ACC  when combined with  BoNT  injections  
in BEB . Comparisons will be drawn between the T1, T2 ( about 10 weeks after BoNT) and T3 ( about 12 weeks 
after BoNT) assessments in the c linical scoring of BEB symptoms and patient rati ng of quality of life . We 
hypothesize that in comparison  to T1  assessment;  there will be an increased control of BEB symptoms and patient 
rating of quality of life  at T2 follow -up. These benefits will remain sustained at T3 follow -up though to a lesser 
extent.  
 
 
Aim 2: Physiological impact of rTMS therapy in BEB  
 
Aim 2a: We will  determine the physiological effects  of 0.[ADDRESS_162821] the time course of effects on BRR  at T1, T2 and T3 assessments . We 
hypothesize that in comparison to T1 assessment , BRR will be reduced and reach physiological levels at T2 
follow -up. BRR will continue to remain at physiological levels at T3 follow -up though to a lesser extent than at 
T2. 
 
Aim 2b: We will  determine if the effects  of 0.2 Hz rTMS therapy  on BRR will correlate with clinical scoring of 
BEB symptoms. We hypothesiz e that the change in BRR at T2 and T3  will show positive correla tion with the 
improvement in BEB  symptoms at these time points.

Protocol Version 08/10/2015  4 METHODS  
 
Study design : We propose a blinded control study of real and sham rTMS with a goal of enrolling about eight 
subjects  (age range 21–80 years)  in each treatment arm  and ten healthy control subjects for normative 
physiological data  (total 26 16). Subjects diagnosed with blepharospasm or cranio -cervical dystonia  who receive 
BoNT  therapy at our center  will be approached . The BoNT clinic at our center  follows more than [ADDRESS_162822] 
responded to BoNT and the duration of benefits perceived  with BoN T therapy. We will enroll only those subjects 
who report experiencing positive benefits with BoNT but lasting about 10 weeks or less . We will exclude subjects 
if they report  1) pregnancy; 2) active seizure disorder ; 3) significant cognitive impairment ; 4) exposure to 
neuroleptics ; and 5) presence  of a metallic body such as pacemaker, implants, prosthesis, artificial limb or joint, 
shunt, metal rods and hearing aid.[ADDRESS_162823] to real-TMS 
versus sham -TMS.   
 
Outcome measures:  The primary clinical outcome will be  the percentage change in physician rating of BEB 
symptoms. We will record  [ADDRESS_162824]  blink re flex recovery (BRR) as the  
physiological outcome of rTMS . We will determine the time course effects of rTMS on physiological outcome . 
We will also determine i f the physiological effects correlate  with the clinical outcome  measures.  
 
Clinical measures:  
 
Physician rating:  We will score the  eye blink rate, number of sustained blinks, and time of eye closure.   An eye 
blink w ill be  defined as any visible, bilateral, and synchronous contraction of the orbicularis oculi ( OO muscle ), 
causing eyelid drop. Blink rate will be  expressed as blinks per minute. Sustai ned spasms of the OO muscle will  
not be considered blinks and will be  counte d separately. The  time (seconds) of eye closure whenever blinks cause  
prolonged eye closure (eyes shut > 2 seconds)  will be recorded with a stopwatch .14  
 
Patient rating:  We will administer the Craniocervical  Dystonia Questionnaire Description for quality of life  
assessment . The Craniocervical Dystonia Questionnaire (CDQ -24) is a patient -rated health  related quality of life 
(HR-QoL) measure for craniocervical  dystonia.  It was developed  based on issues that are  relevant to patients  
with BEB . It has been  validated  for use in clinical  research.  The CDQ -[ADDRESS_162825] of C raniocervical  
 
 
Protocol Version 08/10/2015  5 Dystonia on 5 HR -QoL domains. It is composed  of 24 items, forming 5 subscales: stigma, emotional  well-
being, pain, activiti es of daily living, and social/  family life. Items are rated on a [ADDRESS_162826] two  weeks because of dystonia by [CONTACT_143171] . Subjects will also rate their symptoms before and  after stimulation using  a 7-point 
nomin al scale: 1) excellent, 2) very good, 3) good, 4) average, 5) sl ightly worse than usual, 6) bad or  7) very 
bad. 
 
Physiological Measure : 
 
Blink reflex recover:  We will record  surface EMG recordings for both eyes separately from the orbicularis oculi 
(OO) muscle using Ag -AgCl  surface electrodes. The EMG signals will be amplified using D360 amplifiers 
(Digitimer, Wel wyn, [LOCATION_006]), band pass filtered (5 –2,500 Hz), analog -to-digital -converted using a 1401 AD 
converter (CED, Cambridge, [LOCATION_006]) at a sample rate of 5,000 Hz, and will be coll ected on a computer. Electrical 
stimulation will be applied to the supraorbital nerve in the supraorbital notch with a bipolar stimulating electrode 
and a constant  current generator (Digitimer). Single and paired electrical stimuli (conditioning and test) will be 
delivered and EMG amplitudes will be recorded from the OO muscle. All stimuli will be 0.2 msec in duration 
and stimulus intensity will be set at 3 times the R2 threshold (lowest intensity that gives an R2 response in at least 
5 out of 10 trials). S ubjects will be studied at rest, with eyes gently closed. The blink reflex in response to paired 
stimulation will be assessed at multiple inter stimulus intervals of about 200 ms ec ([ADDRESS_162827] and paired 
stimulus each, pseudo randomized .). Pairs of s timuli will be separated by [CONTACT_143172] 20 –[ADDRESS_162828] will be rejected online. Data will be analyzed offline 
using Signal software (Cambridge Electronic Design, [LOCATION_006]). The raw blink re cordings will be DC -corrected, 
rectified, and averaged. The onset latency and duration of R1 and R2 responses will be determined by [CONTACT_143173]. Peak amplitude of R2 will be calculated within a window 
from [ADDRESS_162829] [R2T] by [CONTACT_143174] [R2C ]. 19 
 
rTMS  therapy:  
 
Real stimulation:  rTMS  will be delivered over each anterior cingulate cortex , using a figure -of-eight  coil 
connected to a Magstim  machi ne (Magstim Company, Dyfed, [LOCATION_006]). We will apply  rTMS with 0.2 Hz  frequency  
to the ACC . We will deliver  180 stimuli  (around 15 min) with a stimulator output of 100% active motor threshold 
(AMT). AMT will be  assessed at the tibialis anterior muscle with the figure -of-eight  coil. The A MT will be 
defined as the lowest stimulation intensity required to evoke a 150 μV potential in the  targe t muscle . To determine 
the stimulation site for ACC, the figure -of-eight /double cone  coil will be  placed over Fz and then moved over the 
midline of the brain in 0.5 -cm steps anteriorly, until the point of maximum motor evoked potential in the 
orbicularis o culi (OO) muscle (with a latency of 6 –8 msec) is reached (about 3.5 cm medi al and 5.5 cm anterior 
to motor cortex ).[ADDRESS_162830] associated  with the 
discharge of the stimulation coil.  
 
Sham Stimulation:  During sham rTMS, subjects  will undergo the same procedure for identifying stimulus 
location as used in patients receiving real rTMS. Sham  rTMS will be administered using the same Magstim coil 
as used in real stimulation. This coil will be placed on the patient’s head in an identical manner howeve r will not 
be connected to the M agstim device. Instead another coil will be  connected to provide stimulation sound . In each 
stimulation co ndition, the Magstim will be placed behind the patient and not visible to him or her.  Placebo sham  
coil which produce s discharge noise and vibration similar to a real coil without s timulating the cerebral cortex.  
During rTMS, all patients will  continue to wear ear plugs as instructed during the real stimulation sessio ns.

Safety of rTMS : Repetitive TMS can have undesired s ide effects.  Guidelines for the safe use of rTMS were 
formulated  at the 1st International Work shop on the Safety of TMS.[ADDRESS_162831]’s blephar ospasm symptoms. Risks 
include a neck ache or headache. The study procedure may also cause the nearby [CONTACT_143175].  
Although TMS has been used for over [ADDRESS_162832] will be pre-paid.  
 
Control subjects will be paid a flat rate of $20 or can be paid for mileage, whichever is greater.  If you are paid  
more than $[ADDRESS_162833] your social security number.  
 
SAMPLE SIZE, EXPECTED OUTCOME AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS :  With an expected difference 
of 30% in the primary outcome measure14 between before  (T0) and after rTMS therapy  (T1), a standard deviation 
of 20%, type I error of 5% and power of 80%, the necessary sample size for each group has been determined . In 
this one year pi[INVESTIGATOR_143167] a total of 16 BEB subjects  with eight  subjects  in each treatment arm  
and 16 healthy controls for normative physiological data . Descriptive statistics w ill be used for the demographic 
data. Data will be presented as mean (SD) unless otherwise indicated.  We will examine each of t he dependent 
measure separately. These include the eye blink rate, number of sustained blinks, the time of eye closure, patient 
rating of blepharospasm and the BRR cycle. For Aim [ADDRESS_162834] factors: treatment (2 levels: act ive vs sham) and time (3 levels: T1, T1, and T3).  If the interaction 
effects between stimulation arm and time are found as non-significant, they will be dropped. In case of significant 
main effects, post hoc pairwise comparisons will be corrected using Fi sher least significant difference procedure 
in accordance with the closed test principle; i.e.,  post hoc comparisons will be declared non -significant if the 
global p value of the main effect (testing equality of all 2 stimulation arms simultaneously) are n on-significant, 
but will be carried out without further correction in case of a significant global main effect. SPSS version 15.[ADDRESS_162835] to determine the relation between the change in BRR  and change in 
clinical scores  at T2 compared to T1 and at T3 compared to T1.  
 
 
POTENTIAL PROBLEMS  
 
 
 
Protocol Version 08/10/2015  7 1. Subjects may not meet the criteria, may not tolerate the rTMS therapy or drop out of the study. We will 
factor in these considerations during  recruitment. We propose a sample size of eight  subjects in each 
treatment arm  (total 16 ). We have an IRB approved database of patients followed at our center.  In order 
to meet our target sample , while conducting the  retrospective analysis we preemptive ly identified the BEB  
subjects  that receive suboptimal benefits ( 36 subjects ). 
2. Quality assurance (QA) on the Magstim machine will be constantly monitored.  
3. Quality  of EMG recordings: The EMG recordings (Delsys, Inc., [LOCATION_011], [LOCATION_005]) are reliable with 
high signal -to-noise ratio. We will reduce the noise of the EMG signals by [CONTACT_143176] g and lightly abrading 
the skin.

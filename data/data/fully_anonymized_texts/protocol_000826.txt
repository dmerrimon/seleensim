Statistical analyses   
Statistical analyses will be performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., North Carolina, 
[LOCATION_002]).  Difference scores from baseline to week  8 and from baseline to week  24 will be 
calculated for both hair density and caliber.  The PRP and sal ine groups will be compared on 
these difference scores using independent samples t -tests.  The difference scores will also be 
dichotomized based on whether the change over time was positive or negative.  The PRP and 
saline groups will be compared on these dichotomized scores using chi -square tests.  All given p -
values will be two tailed and a p -value of less than 0.05 will be regarded as indicating statistical 
significance.

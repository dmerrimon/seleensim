A. Study Objectives
Primary objective:
To determine the effect of prophylactic fentanyl sublingual spray (FSS, 15-25% and 
35-45% proportional doses) on the intensity of exercise-induced dyspnea (modified 
Borg scale) between the first and second shuttle walk tests. We aim to estimate the 
effect size for both FSS arms to inform a larger, adequately powered confirmatory 
randomized controlled trial.
Secondary objectives
A.2. To determine the effect of prophylactic FSS (15-25% and 35-45% proportional 
doses) on walk distance and adverse effects between the first and second shuttle 
walk tests. We hypothesize that FSS is superior to no FSS in increasing walk distance 
and has limited side effects in opi[INVESTIGATOR_496572].
A.3.To compare the intensity of exercise-induced breakthrough dyspnea between 
high (35-45% proportional dose) and low (15-25% proportional dose) doses of 
prophylactic FSS.  We hypothesize that higher doses of FSS is superior to lower doses 
FSS in reducing dyspnea at the end of the shuttle walk test.
B. Background
Dyspnea is a subjective awareness of difficulty breathing, which may be associated 
with the distressing sensation of suffocation. It is one of the most common and most 
feared symptoms among cancer patients, occurring in up to 70% of patients in the last 6 
weeks of life 1,2. Dyspnea is associated with fatigue, anxiety, decreased function and 
quality of life, and increased mortality 3,4.
In a study examining 70 patients with dyspnea, 43 (61%) reported breakthrough 
(epi[INVESTIGATOR_496573]) dyspnea only, 13 (19%) had constant dyspnea only, and 14 
(20%) experienced both constant and breakthrough dyspnea.  A substantial proportion 
of the patients with breakthrough dyspnea (18/57, 32%) presented with 5 or more 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_914], and the majority of epi[INVESTIGATOR_360470] <10 minutes 5. Breakthrough 
dyspnea is particularly challenging to treat because of its transient and epi[INVESTIGATOR_496574].
Exercise-induced dyspnea (or shortness of breath on exertion) is a subtype of 
breakthrough dyspnea. Breakthrough dyspnea has 4 major triggers: exertion, emotional 
changes, the environment (e.g. altitude, smog), and spontaneous/idiopathic. Because 
many cancer patients experience severe shortness of breath with activities (i.e. 
walking), they have to limit their function significantly. In a recent study conducted by 
[CONTACT_27156], we found that a vast majority of patients (81%) had breakthrough dyspnea. 
Specifically, dyspnea affects patients’ general activity, walking ability, normal work, 
sleep, mood, relations with others and enjoyment of life 5.
The current management of dyspnea involves treatment of any reversible causes and 
supportive measures to minimize the sensation of dyspnea, such as oxygen, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], 
bronchodilators, and corticosteroids 1,6,7. A majority of the studies on cancer-related 
dyspnea so far focused on patients with dyspnea at rest. In a cross-over randomized 
controlled trial, Bruera et al. compared subcutaneous morphine and placebo in 10 
2015-0137
Rev. 3/30/[ADDRESS_638501] of opi[INVESTIGATOR_496575] (p=0.0008), supporting the use of oral or parenteral 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_496576] 7,10. Several other 
systematic reviews have confirmed this finding 1,11.
Treatment options for breakthrough dyspnea. Although systemic opi[INVESTIGATOR_496577], there are currently no definitive 
evidence-based options for breakthrough dyspnea. In a case series, Bruera et al. 
reported the use of rescue morphine given subcutaneously for 312 epi[INVESTIGATOR_496578] 45 cancer patients.  After 30 minutes, 90% reported no to mild 
dyspnea 8. Based on this study, most clinicians use a dose similar to the rescue opi[INVESTIGATOR_496579] (i.e. 10-20% of total daily dose) to manage breakthrough 
dyspnea. However, a more recent double-blind randomized controlled trial comparing 
systemic hydromorphone (oral or subcutaneous (SC)), nebulized fentanyl, and 
nebulized saline for breakthrough dyspnea found no significant difference in dyspnea 
relief at 10 minutes between the treatment arms 12.  One of the reasons may be due to 
the short duration for the primary endpoint (10 minutes) and the fact that the 
investigators used mostly oral hydromorphone, which reaches peak concentration only 
45-60 minutes later. We recently completed a preliminary study examining the role of 
subcutaneous fentanyl for breakthrough dyspnea, and found a significant improvement 
in both dyspnea scores and walk distance before and after the study 13. To date, the 
evidence for opi[INVESTIGATOR_496580] 
(Table 1). A recent review on the role of opi[INVESTIGATOR_496581] a 
promising therapeutic effect in cancer and non-cancer settings 14. Further research is 
necessary to improve the management of this distressing and debilitating symptom.

The role of rapid onset opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. The epi[INVESTIGATOR_496584]. Administration of opi[INVESTIGATOR_496585], although many 
patients do not have access to these routes at home. Fentanyl is a highly lipophilic 
compound.  Over the past decade, there has been active development of fentanyl, 
including delivery by [CONTACT_496600] (oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate [OTFC], 
Actiq), buccal (Fentora), intranasal (Lazanda, Instanyl) and sublingual (Subsys, Abstral) 
formulations 18-20These fentanyl formulations have been successfully used to manage 
breakthrough pain 21-28, although their role in breakthrough dyspnea has only been 
reported in a handful of studies.   Two small retrospective case series reported on the 
use of transmucosal and intranasal fentanyl15,16and one prospective series examined 
the use of OTFC 17suggest significant improvement in breakthrough dyspnea with 
these agents. Randomized controlled trials are urgently needed to confirm these 
findings with rapid onset opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], which could potentially open up a new therapeutic 
indication for these medications.
Fentanyl sublingual spray (FSS) is a particularly attractive option for breakthrough 
dyspnea. It was approved by [CONTACT_496601] 2012 for “the 
management of breakthrough pain in adult cancer patients who are already receiving 
and who are tolerant to around-the-clock opi[INVESTIGATOR_496586]”, and represents an alternative delivery system for fentanyl that also utilizes 
a transmucosal route like OTFC. A pharmacokinetic study examining 5 different doses 
of FSS (100 mcg, 200 mcg, 400 mcg, 600 mcg, 800 mcg) in healthy volunteers 
demonstrated that fentanyl enters the systemic circulation rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], achieving 27%, 61%, 
87% and close to 100% of maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) within 5, 10, 20 and 
30 minutes, respectively 29. In a separate crossover study comparing FSS 400 mcg, 
OTFC 400 mcg and intravenous fentanyl 100 mcg in healthy volunteers, FSS had a 
greater bioavailability (76% vs. 51%) and achieved a higher Cmax than OTFC (0.81 
mg/ml vs. 0.61 ng/ml). Similar to the previous study, the mean plasma concentrations 
were 19% and 54% of Cmax within [ADDRESS_638503] 
common adverse effects included nausea (7%), hyperhidrosis (5%) and peripheral 
edema (5%).

Rev. 3/30/[ADDRESS_638504] a larger, multi-
institutional randomized controlled trial that is 
adequately powered. Further confirmation of 
FSS’s efficacy would pave the way for using 
this medication for a novel indication. The 
proposed study has the potential to greatly 
improve patients’ symptom burden, function 
and quality of life, and shift the paradigm for 
symptom research.
C. Experimental Approach
C.1. Overall Study design. This is an 
investigator-initiated study supported by 
[CONTACT_496602]. We propose a 2-arm, 
double-blind, parallel randomized controlled 
trial of FSS for cancer patients with 
breakthrough dyspnea (Figure 1).  The main 
goal of this study is to determine the effect size of FSS on dyspnea (at two different 
doses) to inform a larger, adequately powered confirmatory randomized controlled trial.  
After study consent, eligible patients will be asked to complete a number of surveys and 
a shuttle walk test at baseline, rest until they return to baseline dyspnea, and then do 
another shuttle walk test after they have been given FSS prophylactically.
Based on our experience conducting symptom control trials, this study will take each 
patient approximately 2 hours to complete in a single visit.  We believe this study design 
is feasible and would not add undue burden for patients. Patients will be compensated 
with a $[ADDRESS_638505] and a $[ADDRESS_638506] 
completed the study assessments.
C.2. Eligibility Criteria. The eligibility criteria are shown in Table 2.

* To minimize study burden for participation in this 2-hour study, extra bloodwork will not 
be drawn unless the patient already has the above lab abnormalities documented and 
need to be corrected. 
C.3. Study screening. A [ADDRESS_638507] (CTC) website (https://biostatistics.mdanderson.org/ClinicalTrialConduct),

modifying MRN within the specific patient’s stratum.  Then add a history of the changes 
made to the Notes section. Randomization will be 1:[ADDRESS_638512] 
at the time of enrollment (i.e. 0-3, 4-6).
C.5. Blinding. Both the patient and the research staff conducting the assessment will 
be blinded to the treatment assignment.  FSS will be dispensed by [CONTACT_496604].  Only research nurse administering the medication will be 
aware of the study dose, and will be instructed not to share that information with the 
patient and other research staff.  Further to that, we will check the blinding from patients 
and study staff at the end of study. 
C.6. Research staff. An orientation will be held with research staff involved in this study 
to introduce them with the study design and to standardize the provision of each 
intervention.
C.7. Study Interventions. The commercial supply of study medication will be provided 
by [CONTACT_496602].  We will use a one time prophylactic FSS dose equivalent to
either 15-25% or 35-45% of MEDD [ADDRESS_638513].  
FSS was FDA approved in 2012 for “For the management of breakthrough pain in adult
cancer patients who are already receiving and who are tolerant to around-the-clock 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_496587].”  
Immediately upon patient enrollment, the study physician will be notified and will 
determine the morphine equivalent daily dose (MEDD) in real time using standardized 
equianalgesic ratios.  Based on clinical practice and similarly to the dose used for 
breakthrough pain, we will use an FSS dose equivalent to 15-25% or 35-45% of MEDD 
(Table 3).  The study medication will be provided by [CONTACT_496605] [ADDRESS_638514].  We estimated the FSS
dose based on the following assumptions: 
A one time rescue dose 15-45% of the MEDD is safe and effective for relief of 
dyspnea
FSS has approximately 70% oral bioavailability 30

the speed of walking increased by 0.167 m/s (or 10 m/min). A change of speed to the 
next level will be indicated by a triple bleep from the tape recorder (Table 4).
To help the patient to establish the routine of the test and the first, very slow, speed of 
walking, the operator will walk alongside for the first minute. The patient will have 20

The explanation to the patient will be standardized (see appendix). Patients in previous 
studies found it easy to pace themselves and no difficulties were encountered in 
administering the test.
The end of the test will be determined by [CONTACT_5640] (a) the patient, when he or she was too 
breathless to maintain the required speed or (b) the operator, if the patient failed to 
complete a shuttle in the time allowed (that is, was more than 0.[ADDRESS_638520] from the cone 
when the bleep sounded).
We will be assessing the dyspnea level with modified Borg scale at baseline and then 
every minute during at the shuttle walk test as well as at the end.  We will also measure 
the heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], blood pressure, oxygen saturation before and immediate 
after the shuttle walk test.  The total walking time and distance will also be measured. 
We will also ask the reasons for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_496588] a standardized statement and question: “You had to stop, what was it that 
made you stop the test?” The patients’ comments were recorded verbatim. 
C.10. Variable rest period. After the first and second shuttle walk test, patients will be
asked to sit down and rest.  How long they rest would depend on when they return to 
baseline level of dyspnea + 1 or below (e.g. if baseline dyspnea = 4, they need to return 
to a level of 5 or less to qualify for next stage) and baseline level of fatigue +[ADDRESS_638521] period, patients will be assessed every 5 minutes to check their 
dyspnea and fatigue level.  If their dyspnea/fatigue level met criteria and they feel ready

C.14. Patient Safety, Monitoring, and Confidentiality. 
During the study, both a research nurse and a research coordinator will be 
available to perform study assessments and provide safety monitoring.  This 
study will be conducted right outside our Supportive Care Center, where we have 
additional support from multiple clinic nurses and doctors.  The cardiopulmonary 
center is also very close. If desaturation occurs, we will put patient on 
supplemental oxygen, and determine if the patient becomes non-hypoxemic after 
2015-0137
Rev. 3/30/[ADDRESS_638527] (>30 minutes), we will 
send the patient to ER for further assessment.  Based on our experience 
conducting similar studies on exertional dyspnea in which we routinely monitor 
their vitals, there is a minimal risk of significant saturation with exercise. A study 
physician will also be available by [CONTACT_496607], distress, or 
questions, and will attend to the patient as needed. See stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_496593].  
Regulatory monitoring will be provided by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_496594] (IRB). Patient confidentiality will be ensured by [CONTACT_496608],
secure storage of clinical data, and anonymous reporting.
Research-Related Injury 
Insys will be responsible for payment of the actual and reasonable medical expenses 
incurred in diagnosing and treating any injury, illness or adverse reaction of a study 
subject that results from the administration of Fentanyl Sublingual Spray. 
C.15 Serious Adverse Event Reporting (SAE) Reporting
Serious adverse events will be captured from the time of the first protocol-specific 
intervention, until [ADDRESS_638528] an 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.[ADDRESS_638529] before and after the treatment (i.e., 
between the first and second shuttle walk) using a two-sided paired t-test with a 
significance level of 0.05. 
D.2. Data Analysis. Summary descriptive statistics will be provided for demographics, 
outcomes, and other collected variables such as the change of exercise induced 
dyspnea, walk distance, neurocognitive function and various physiological parameters 
at the end of each walk and the difference of these changes between two walks, and 
will include proportions, medians, means, 95% confidence intervals, and other simple 
statistics as appropriate for the measure. Each endpoint will be evaluated repeatedly 
2015-0137
Rev. 3/30/[ADDRESS_638530] of treatment on the changes of these
measures will also be estimated in the same model when possible. Other statistical 
methods may be applied when appropriate.
E. Data Confidentiality Procedures
Health information will be protected and we will maintain the confidentiality of the data 
obtained from the patients’ charts.
Collection of identifiers : We will collect and securely store patients' identifiers 
(including name, medical record number, and demographic specifications).  Each 
patient will be assigned a study number that will be the only identifier to figure in the 
analytical file and personal data will not be disclosed in any form. The key linking these 
numbers will be retained in a securely locked file by [CONTACT_093].
Data Storage : Protection of electronic and paper records will be maintained to the best 
of our ability. All electronic records will be stored on password-protected institution 
computers behind the institution firewall.  Any paper records will be classified and stored 
in locked files inside a locked office.
Training of personnel : Only MDACC personnel trained in maintaining confidentiality, 
the principal investigator, co-investigators, collaborators, and research staff will have

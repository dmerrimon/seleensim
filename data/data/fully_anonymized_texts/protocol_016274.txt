bupi[INVESTIGATOR_715273]. Preservative free dexamethasone is a well -studied additive 
that has shown prolongation of the interscalene block (up to 22 hours) and has been well 
adopted as a very common clinical practice. Liposomal Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_715274]. The study that was used to grant its 
approval compared the liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_338303]. There has yet to be a study 
comparing the newly approved additive to a comparable additive. Unlike other studies that 
compared it to placebo or a plain local anesthetic, the goal of this study is to compare 
liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_110771] a long acting interscalene block with preservative free 
dexamethasone. Liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_715275] a single -shot alternative to 
catheters. There have been comparative studies with liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] i nfiltration with 
catheters but no comparison to additives such as dexamethasone.  
 
 Rebound pain is a known phenomenon that led clinicians to seek out blocks that 
would last longer. Williams et al1 demonstrated that by [CONTACT_715290] 48 
hours  for knee surgery, it mitigates the intense rebound pain we  witness with shorter acting 
blocks. Abdullah et al2 demonstrated in their meta -analysis that the interscalene block  
provides little benefit for shoulder surgery if the duration is less than 24 hou rs. There are 
several prospective studies,  and reviews supporting preservative -free dexamethasone 
perineural application to prolong the block3,4,5 
 
 Liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (Exparel) has been FDA approved for infiltration use. Just 
recently, it has been appr oved for  the interscalene nerve block. There is only one 
prospective study comparing liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_715276] a week6. It is unclear if the effect would be the same if the liposomal 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_715277]. However, the reason the 
authors added standard bupi[INVESTIGATOR_715278] a surgical anesthetic for the study. As the goal of the study was to 
observe  the analgesic effect of adding liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_715279], it 
would be a fairer comparison group  to measure it against a proven adjuvant like 
dexamethasone . This study will help elucidate liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]’s analgesic benefit in 
prolonging nerve blocks by [CONTACT_715291]. The study led to 
liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]’s FDA approval compared its analgesic properties to  placebo7.

 This study will aid in validating or invalidating the claim that liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_715282], up to [ADDRESS_974290] -effective 
alternative rather than to a placebo, the study will provide new knowledge to the literature.  If 
the study shows that exparel is non -inferior to dexamethasone over 72 hours, it will potential 
deter its costly use  
2.0 OBJECTIVE (S) OF CLINICAL STUDY   
 If liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_715283] 
(preservative -free dexamethasone bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]), it will discourage its costly use. Does the 
mixture of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_715284]?

hour time point [24, 48, 72 hours]).

roots. Patients will be randomized to two groups:  
 
1. Dexamethasone: 15mL of 0.5% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_72160] 4mg of preservative -free 
dexamethasone will be injected

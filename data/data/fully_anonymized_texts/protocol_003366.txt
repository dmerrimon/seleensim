1.0 Objectives  / Specific Aims  
• The objective of this study is to determine  whether the addition of lung protective 
strategies to existing enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS)  protocols for 
colorectal surgeries  and hepatobiliary  surgeries  will improve post -operative lung 
function.   
• The hypothesis is that prospective subject s undergoing  hepato biliary and colorectal 
surgeries that have lung protective strategies added to their base ERAS protocols will 
have improved lung function  as measured  by [CONTACT_447] -operative  PACU mean inspi[INVESTIGATOR_67041] , who had the base 
ERAS protocols without lung protective strategies uniformly applied.   
2.0 Background  
 
Enhanced recovery a fter surgery (ERAS) protoco ls are  evidence based care improvement 
process es for surgical subject s.  Implementation of ERAS programs for perioperative 
management after surgery has resulted in major improvements in clinical outcomes and 
costs, making ERAS an important example of value -based care applied to surgery.[ADDRESS_73235] shown improvement in peri operative surgical outcomes with the use of lung protective 
[ventilator] strategies.[ADDRESS_73236]-operative lung 
function as measured by [CONTACT_67052][INVESTIGATOR_67042] t o the controls.  
 
3.0 Intervention  to be studied (if applicable)  
• A select number of researched lung protective interventions  will be standardized and 
applied  to existing and ongoing MUSC ERAS protocols for colorectal and 
hepatobiliary surgeries.   
• The intervention  arm of the study will be subject s undergoing  colorectal and 
hepatobiliary surgeries who will h ave the standard ERAS protocol and  lung 
protective strategies applied . 
• The control arm of the study will be subject s going for colorectal and hepatobiliary surgeries 
who will have the standard ERAS protocol s but will not have  standardized lung protective 
strategies applied  
• The Lung Protective Interventions to be added include : 
1. Pressure control ventilation -volume guaranteed (PCV -VG) ventilation at 
approximately  7cc/kg of predicted body weight (derived from 
combination of sex and height)  
2. Positive end -expi[INVESTIGATOR_27111] (PEEP) 7cm H2O5 , PEEP will be 
titrated  based on clincal needs of participants.  
Version 2; Version Date 03.31.[ADDRESS_73237] intubation recruitment breath  (30cm water for 30 
seconds)  
4. Every 1 hour recruitment breath (30cm water for 30 seconds)  
5. 40% FIO2 initially – titrate up as necessary to maintain SPO2 >94%  
 
4.0 Study Endpoints (if applicable)  
• The end -point of the study will be  completion of the 3rd incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_67043] 2 hour mark, whether it be in PACU or on the in patient  floor  
• Study termination would include  need for post -operative mechanical ventilation, 
need for post -op BIPAP/CPAP, admission to ICU, or inability to adhe re to lung 
protective interventions due to subject  intolerance . 
 
5.0 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria / Study Population

6.0 Number of Subjects  
• This study will include  [ADDRESS_73238] a 20% difference in the 
anticipated decrease in incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_67045] s for the 
control and intervention groups.   
7.0 Setting  
• Ashley River Tower perioperative areas at MUSC . 
 
8.0 Recruitment Methods  
• Surgical schedules will  be screened by [CONTACT_67053] .  
Version 2; Version Date 03.31.21 
 Page 4 of 7  • An IRB approved, CITI trained, research team member that has been trained on the 
protocol will review the chart of potential participants to verify their eligibility .  
• A study team member will approach  the subject  about the research study to discuss 
their willingness to participate  in the holding room bay  prior to their surgery . 
9.0 Consent Process  
 
• The consent process will take place in the  subject’s  private bay in the pre-operative holding 
in Ashley River Tower of MUSC.  
• Potential subjects will be invited to participate in the study prior to their surgery.  They 
will be given time to ask questions and the study will be explained in detail to them. They  
will be given time to read the consent documents and ask any questions prior to signing 
consent.  
• If they agree to participate in the study they will be asked to prov ide written consent AND 
sign the consent and HIPAA documents . 
 
10.0 Study Design  / Methods  
• After obtaining informed consent, the subject s will be provided with an incentive 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_14007].  They will be educated in its use  and will then proceed to take three  
separate maximum exer tion inspi[INVESTIGATOR_67046].  All three  measurements 
will be reco rded and the subject s will then be randomized to the control or 
intervention group.   
• They will proceed to the operating room where the existing baseline ERAS protocol 
for colorectal or hepatobiliary surgery will be implemented during their surgery.  In 
addition to the existing protocols, the five  lung protective strategies listed above will 
also be implemented throughout the course of the surgery for the intervention group.   
• In the PACU, the subject s will be asked at the 30  minute, 1 hour, and 2 hour mark s 
(time zero will be arrival to PACU) to once more take three  separate maximum 
exerti on inspi[INVESTIGATOR_67047].   
• If the subject s are unable or unwilling to comply, this will be documented as well 
and re -attempted at the next scheduled study documentation milestone.   
• The information that will be pulled from the subject ’s medical record will include 
age, gender, weight, height, BMI, O2 saturation, average intra -op tidal volume, and 
the absence or presence of  supplemental O2 use.     
• The data collected for the intervention subject s who will have the standardized lung 
protective strategies applied will then be compared to the control subject s who 
underwent the same surgeries and had the same colorectal and hepa tobiliary 
protocols implemented, but without the use of standardized lung protective 
strategies.   
11.0 Data Management   
• The primary outcome of interest is the inspi[INVESTIGATOR_67048].  
• The secondary outcomes that will be observed are the numerical value for SPO2, SPO2 
trend, and use or lack thereof of supplemental O2 in PACU i n 15 minute intervals or up 
to two  hours after arrival there.    
Version 2; Version Date 03.31.21 
 Page 5 of 7  • Our primary hypothesis is that subject s that will have lung protective strategies 
employed on them will have 20% superior mean inspi[INVESTIGATOR_67049] -intervention controls.  
• Only IRB approved study team members will have access to data.  Each study subject  
will be given a study ID number  that will be used to identify them throughout the 
study .  All study staff will have their CITI certification and receive protocol training. 
All data will be kept on a pas sword protected MUSC server  and in a redcap database .  
All paper documents will be kept in a locked office, in a locked cabinet  that only IRB 
study team members have access to .  
• Our primary hypothesis is that use of lung protection protocol will result in smaller change in 
lung function, measured by [CONTACT_67054][INVESTIGATOR_038] (IS).  
 
H0: change in IS I ≠ change in IS C 
HA: change in IS I < change in IS C 
 
 
The primary analysis will be a two -sided test of mean change in IS after surgery compared to pre -surgery 
IS.  
Based on data from a study of 19 people undergoing lobectomy {Bastin, 1997 #[ZIP_CODE]}, we assume that 
the IS before surgery is 2642 mL (se=140; std=6 10). If the control group IS descreases by 40%, the mean 
change in the control group will be ~1000 mL  (std dev=308). Assuming the intervention group IS 
decreases by 30%, the mean change in the intervention group will be ~800 mL.  Assume shared std 
dev=350 .  
t tests - Means: Difference between two independent means (two groups)  
Analysis:  A priori: Compute required sample size  
Input:  Tail(s)  = Two 
 Effect size d  = 0.6666667  
 α err prob  = 0.05 
 Power (1 -β err prob)  = 0.8 
 Allocation ratio N2/N1  = 1 
Output:  Noncentrality parameter δ  = 2.8674419  
 Critical t  = 1.9934636  
 Df = 72 
 Sample size group 1  = 37 
 Sample size group 2  = 37 
 
Sample size was determined using G*Power version [IP_ADDRESS] software.  Using preliminary data, we 
estimate that we will need 37  subjects in each group (N=74) to have sufficient power (80%) at alpha=0.[ADDRESS_73239] the hypothesis of a difference in mean change in IS for the two groups. To account for attrition due 
to withdrawals, we intend to enroll 50 patients per group. In the event  that no withdrawals occur, 
enrolling 100 subjects (50 in each group) will give 91% power to distinguish between the two groups.

Baseline clinical and demographic factors for each group will be collected. Categorical data will be 
compared across the two groups with Chi -square tests of homogeneity and continuous data will be 
compared with t -tests for means. Covariables determined to be associated with IS measurement will be 
assessed for inclusion in a multivariate linear model.   
 
 
12.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects (if applicable)  
Data and safety monitoring will be performed by [CONTACT_67055] a n annual  basis.  The committee 
is comprised of several attending anesthesiologists,  an emeritus dean of medicine  and a 
biostatistician . Any adverse events will be reported to MUSC's IRB  per protocol and will 
be evaluated by [CONTACT_942].   
14.0 Withdrawal of Subjects  (if applicable)  
• Participants will be withdrawn from the study if they expi[INVESTIGATOR_67050], require 
post-op mechanical ventilation, require immediate ICU admission, require post -op 
BIPAP or CPAP use, or intra -operatively do not meet ventilation goals  within the 
prescribed ventilator guidelines (likely due to intrinsic pathology).

setting are being optimized as per protocol.  
• There is a risk of loss of confidentiality.  
16.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects  or Others  
 
• There is a potential  to improve post operative lung function in future subject s if 
these additional lung protective p rocedures prove to be beneficial.  
 
• There is a potential of improve d post operative lung function as measured by a smaller 
reduction in inspi[INVESTIGATOR_67051].   
 
17.0 Sharing of R esults with Subjects  
• Results will not be shared with participants or their families .

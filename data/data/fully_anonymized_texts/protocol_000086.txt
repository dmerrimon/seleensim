[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]   
[ADDRESS_262491]  insertion  methods which employ air or CO214, 15. These 
techniques are called water exchange (WE) and water immersion (WI).  In WI, water is 
used to distend the colon during insertion and is  removed largely  during withdrawal.  WI 
utilizes enough water during insertion to identi fy the luminal direction  but dirty water is 
removed primarily during withdrawal . WE is a slower insertion technique in which the  air 
valve is  turned  off and  clean wate r is infused and dirty water is suctioned during 
insertion and the instrument is not advanced until the lumen is clean. WE also involves 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_218528] . Both WE and WI use air or CO [ADDRESS_262492] to the other methods, TUC involves 
water exchange (WE) during  insertion followed by [CONTACT_218534] (rather 
than gas) on withdrawal in o rder to  distend the lumen for total underwater mucosal 
visualization.  
The use of w ater during colonoscopy  may improve adenoma detection through 
several possible mechanisms17. It may help to  further clear  the bowel of any residual 
stool . In addition, since w ater may allow for mucosal inspection withou t fully distend ing 
the lumen like air  does , water techniques  might increase the yield for flat lesions . Very 
flat lesions  may be less visible  with full disten tion of the lumen. Finally,  water has a 
magnifying effect, which may also increase  detection.  Thus , TUC, in which the entire 
procedure including withdrawal is performed unde rwater , could potentially improve 
polyp detection compared to gas insufflation.   
The goal of our study was to use TUC in tandem with  standard  CO [ADDRESS_262493].  
Study Population  
Eligib le subjects were adults 50 -80 years  who present ed for colonoscopy at White 
River Junction VAMC , Indianapolis VAMC,  and Indiana Univers ity. Exclusion criteria 
included a  co-morbid status of  American Society of Anesthesiologists  physical status 
classification system  ASA of III (severe systemic disease)  or higher, I nflammatory 
Bowel Disease  (IBD) , surgical resection of the large bowel , as well as the use of non-
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_218529].  Finally, potential subjects who d id not report a clear effluent in 
the most recent bowel movement at time of colonoscopy were excluded from the study . 
Randomization  
The participants were  randomized using a random number generator , stratified by 
[CONTACT_218535][INVESTIGATOR_541]/site. The results of the randomization were  opened prior to the initial 
insertion of the colonoscope , inform ing the endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_218530], CO [ADDRESS_262494] colonoscopy followed by [CONTACT_218536]. All exam ination s were  performed by [CONTACT_218537][INVESTIGATOR_11437]  
(JCA, CJK, DKR). Participant s were  sedated using propofol or moderate  sedation with 
midazolam/fentanyl and diphenhydramine. All colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_218531] . (Olympus  CF-HQ190L ; Olympus (Tokyo, Japan))

 The randomization envelope was opened prior to the initial  insertion. An assistant 
measure d the inspection time with a stopwatch from insertion of scope into the rectum 
until the cecum was reached , stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_218532]  (in CO 2 arm only ). For the arm 
where CO [ADDRESS_262495] attempted to intubate the terminal ileum. The  
mucosal inspection was then initiated during withdrawal when the distention with water 
or CO2 was adequat e for visualization.  Measurement of  withdrawal  and inspection 
times w as initiated at this point.  Inspection time was the withdrawal time minus the time 
for biopsy or polypectomy  or for time spent washing or suctioning  (in CO 2 arm only) . 
The assistant with a stopwatch announced the withdrawal time periodically with the goal 
to equalize  inspection times.  
When the withd rawal of the colonoscope reached  the rect um and after the retro -
flexion wa s performed, the en doscopi[INVESTIGATOR_218533]-insert ed the colonoscope using  the ot her 
technique. For the exams with TUC as the first method, water was suctioned out of the 
lumen as CO [ADDRESS_262496], 
CO 2 was suctioned out during the second colonoscopy as the scope wa s inserted with 
water infusion. As the scope was withdrawn, water was infused  with the air valve turned 
off. Inspection was not  started until  after cecal intubation and the lumen wa s filled with 
water allowing for adequate visualization of the mucosa through the infused water. 
Inspection time was measured as outlined above.  
Outcome s 
The primary outcome measure and study endpoint was the miss rate for polyps and 
adenomas in the two study groups  18. Miss rates were  also calculated for participant  
level for each technique. Adenoma -level miss rates were  calculated as the number of 
additional adenomas detected during the second examination  (for both insertion and 
withdrawal)  divided by [CONTACT_218538] 
[ADDRESS_262497] one adenoma in 
either examination. We also examine d proximal  (cecum, ascending colon, transverse 
colon and splenic flexure)  adenoma miss rates as a secondary outcome, which were  
calculated as above.  Finally, we also calculated serrated polyp (hyperplastic, sessile 
serrated polyp and traditional serrated adenoma)  
For each polyp, we estimated  size by [CONTACT_218539], and noted location, method of 
removal, whether polyps were  detected by [CONTACT_218540] 2 or 
TUC was used for mucosal inspection.  
We used the [LOCATION_011] Bowel preparation score to assess the quality of the preparation. 
We also used a scale of good (3), fair (2) and poor (1) to assess the clarity or turbidity of 
the water durin g TUC for 3 segments, right, transverse and left colons.  
Co-variates  
Data collected include d participant age and sex, exam indication, personal history of 
colorectal neoplasia, family history of CRC, time (total pro cedure, insertion and 
inspection),  volume of water infused  during insertion and withdrawal , quality of bowel 
preparation as measured by [CONTACT_218541].  
Statistical considerations  
In calculating  a sample size required to det ect a clinically important difference in 
miss rates between TUC and CO2 we used  the following assumptions: a 30% 
adenoma miss rate for regular colonoscopy19, 20; a 10% adenoma miss rate with TUC; 
50% of participant s would have at least one adenoma, and participant s with adenomas  
would have an average of two adenomas . We based this in part on a tandem study 
using cap since the cap had similar reported increase in adenoma detection to water 
exchange18. For the study to have 80% power to detect a [ADDRESS_262498] with a 5% signifi cance level, the study needed [ADDRESS_262499] 12 0 participants (6 0 at each site).  
[ADDRESS_262500]. The model was adjusted for participant age, sex, family history of CRC, exam 
indication, time  for inspection, insertion time and  volume of water infused/aspi[INVESTIGATOR_3831] . A 
generalized estimating equation was used to control for the effect of the endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_541].

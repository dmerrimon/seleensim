CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL AMENDMENT  
SUMMARY OF CHANGES AND RATIONALE  
UX003-CL203 Amendment 1  
05 October 2015  
 
Original Protocol UX003-CL203 (dated 09 January 2015) has been modified by 
[CONTACT_11827] 1 to expand the study size and to add or clarify certain procedures. The major protocol changes are summarized below:  
1. Overall Study Design and Plan: In Section 7.1 and re lated sections, the study size 
has been increased from up to 7 subjects to approximately  15 subjects including 
approximately 5 infants with hydrops fetalis. 
Rationale :  Increasing the sample size will provide a more robust assessment of safety 
and efficacy  in this patient population. 
2. Study Procedures and Assessments : Several updates have been made to clarify or 
add procedures in Section 7.5. Given the age of the study population and number of assessments,  if the maximum amount of blood has been taken based on Maximum 
Allowable Blood Volume Guidelines for any subject on any given study visit, some assessments will not be  required. A provision has been established in the study-
specific Laboratory Manual for details on prioritizing blood draws. Additional 
modifications to study procedures and assessments specified in the protocol text are 
summarized below. 
Urinary and serum GAG : Reference to the NRE as the primary method for 
measuring urinary and serum GAG has been removed from the protocol. Rationale: Multiple assays for measuring pathologic accumulation of GAG are 
available. The specific methodology used for evaluating the primary efficacy variable 
will be included in the study Statistical Analysis Plan.  
Functional Development : The protocol has  been updated to specif y the Bayley 
Scales of Infant and Toddler Development
® – Third Edition ( Bayley-III) will not be 
administered if the subject has achieved the highest raw score on the instrument, or if, based on the clinical judgment of the Investigator, valid and reliable administration is 
not possible at the specified visit.  
Rationale : The protocol previously specified the highest level of age-equivalence on 
the test as a criterion for omitting the Bayley -III assessment ; the change to raw score 
provides a more straightforward threshold. The option to withhold assessment based 
Protocol Number:  UX003- CL203  
Amendment 1:  [ADDRESS_599475].  
Motor Functioning :  A gross m otor milestone checklist has been added as an 
additional assessment of motor functioning as a tertiary efficacy variable .  
Rationale:  A gross motor milestone checklist was designed to allow for assessment of 
the functional status of the subject requiring limited language interaction and physical 
handling.  
Pulmonary Function Testing:   Pulmonary function assessments have been added to 
the Continuation Period; pulse oximetry measurements will be obtained at 12- week 
intervals. 
Rationale: Continued monitoring of pulmonary function will provide a potential 
measure of maintenance of efficac y. 
Biochemical Markers of Bone Turnover:  Assessment of serum markers of bone 
formation and bone resorption including procollagen type 1 N-propeptide (P1NP), carboxy-terminal cross -linked telopeptide of type I collagen ( CTX-I), bone-specific 
alkaline phosphatase (BALP) , and vitamin D will be conducted at Weeks 0 (baseline) 
and 2, then approximately every 8 weeks thereafter for the remainder of the  
Treatment Period  (i.e. Weeks 8 -48), and every 24 weeks during the Continuation 
Period. 
Rationale:  Skeletal abnor malities are characteristic of MPS 7. Measurement of 
biochemical markers of bone turnover may allow the effects of UX003 on skeletal tissue to be evaluated .  
Drug Concentration Measurements:  Specific time points for collection of PK 
samples have been provided. 
Vital Signs:  Procedures for the assessment of vital signs have been clarified.  
Rationale:  Vital sign assessments have been clarified to be specific for young 
pediatric subjects.  
3. Reporting and Follow- up of Adverse Drug Events: A new section (Section 8.5.5) 
has been added to provide direction on the reporting requirements for suspected 
unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) to appropriate Regulatory Authorities (including Competent Authorities in all Member States concerned), ECs, and Investigators as per local laws and regulations.

CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL AMENDMENT  
SUMMARY OF CHANGES AND RATIONALE  
UX003-CL203 Amendment 2  
07 April 2016 
 
Protocol Amendment 1 (dated 05 October 2015) has been modified by [CONTACT_11827] 2 to 
remove or clarify certain procedures and update information. The major protocol changes are summarized below:  
1. Overall Study Design and Plan:  
• The protocol has been updated to remove reference to availability of c ommercial 
drug in the subject’s territory as a reason for study termination. In addition “end of trial” has been defined in Section 7.5.[ADDRESS_599476] would define the end of the trial.  
Rationale : This change and additional clarification were made to align with 
current regulatory guidelines. 
• Revised protocol to allow for Mutation Analysis at any point of the study. 
Rationale : To further characterize the disease manifestations, severity and 
progression of MPS 7, the sponsor aims to determine the specific genetic mutation in each patient enrolled if consent is provided for such testing.   
• Clarify the h andling of spi[INVESTIGATOR_13377]. 
Rationale : Patients with MPS diseases are at risk for spi[INVESTIGATOR_467834]- related skeletal abnormalities including odontoid hypoplasia and 
vertebral subluxation.  Enzyme replacement therapy may result in increased joint flexibility with possible impact on the risk of spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828].  Additional te xt 
was added to the protocol to recommend appropriate monitoring and management of signs and symptoms of potential spi[INVESTIGATOR_13377].   
• Removal of serum GAG from the continuation period. 
Rationale: Based on clinical and nonclinical evidence, uGAG is a direct 
pathophysiological and readily measured marker of the MPS disease process and a reasonable predictor of treatment effect and  clinical benefit. Urine GAG is the 
Protocol Number:  UX003- CL203  
Amendment 2: 07 APR 2016  
 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential Page 3 
primary measure of ERT efficacy in MPS disorders and will continue to be 
followed during this continuation period. Multiple assays for measuring 
pathologic accumulation of GAG in urine are now available; supplementary assays may be performed. Removal of serum GAG assessments reduces the number of required blood draws.  
• Record Retention  has been updated to state that all study records must be retained 
for at least 25 years after the end of the clinical trial or in accordance with national law.  
Rationale: This admini strative change has been made to reflect upcoming changes 
to EU clinical trial regulations and current regulations by [CONTACT_11831].  
2. Study Procedures and Assessments :  
• Vital Signs:  Procedures for the assessment of vital signs have been clarified.  
Rationale:  Vital sign assessments have been clarified to be specific for young 
pediatric subjects.

2 SYNOPSIS  
TITLE OF STUDY:  
An Open-label Study of UX003 rhGUS Enzyme Replacement Therapy in MPS 7 Patients Less than 
5 Years Old 
PROTOCOL NUMBE R: 
UX003-CL203 
STUDY SITES: 
Multicenter; approximately 2-6 sites globally 
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT:  
Phase 2 
RATIONALE:  
Mucopolysaccharidosis type 7 (MPS 7, Sly syndrome) is an ultra- rare (< 100 cases currently identified 
worldwide), chronically debilitating, and life- threatening lysosomal storage disease.  It is characterized 
by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme beta-glucuronidase (GUS), required for degradation of two 
glycosaminoglycans (GAGs): dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate, the same substrate s accumulated 
in MPS 1  (Hurler syndrome) and MPS 2  (Hunter sy ndrome).  The GUS deficiency results in 
lysosomal accumulation of GAGs in multiple tissues and organs throughout the body and numerous clinical symptoms similar to those observed in MPS 1 and MPS 2.  Some MPS 7 patients present at 
birth with severe edema o r non-immune hydrops fetalis and usually die within  2-4 months. 
There are currently no approved treatments for MPS 7.  UX003 (recombinant human 
beta-glucuronidase, rhGUS) is intended as an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for the treatment of 
MPS 7.  A Phase 1/2 study has shown that treatment with UX003 can reduce lysosomal storage and 
urinary GAG (uGAG) and is expected to provide clinical benefit; a pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 study is ongoing.   
Patients with MPS 7 can present as newborns, infants or young children; this Phase [ADDRESS_599477] the same underlying etiology , the breadth and type of clinical problems can be different, 
including more frequent ascites/edem a, cardiac problems, and other severe manifestations.  This study 
will assess the relative safety , pharmacokinetics (PK), and efficacy of UX003 ERT in young patients 
with MPS 7 . 
OBJECTIVES:  
Primary Objective : 
The primary objective is to evaluate the effect of UX003 treatment in pediatric MPS 7 subjects less 
than 5 years of age on:  
• Safety and tolerability  
• Efficacy as determined by [CONTACT_467850] : 
The secondary objective is to evaluate the effect of UX003 on growth velocity  and 
hepatosplenomegaly . 
 
Protocol Number:  UX003- CL203  
Amendment 2: 07 APR 2016  
 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential Page 5 
Tertiary Objectives : 
Tertiary objectives are to assess PK and evaluate the effect of UX003 on  measures of lysosomal 
storage, overall clinical change, cardiac and pulmonary function, bone turnover  markers, and 
functional and motor development. 
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY:  
UX003-CL203 is an open- label, multicenter, Phase [ADDRESS_599478] s will 
receive UX003 via intravenous (IV) infusion at a dose of 4 mg/kg every other week (QOW) . Subjects 
who complete the 48-week study may choose to continue UX003 treatment in the Continuation Period 
up to [ADDRESS_599479] is discontinued from the study at 
the discretion of the Investigator or Ultragenyx, or the study is terminated . Figure 2.1 provides a 
schematic of the overall study design.  
Figure 2.1: UX003-CL203 Study Schema  
 
NUMBER OF SUBJECTS PLANNED: 
Approximately 15 subjects will be enrolled including  approximately 5 subjects with hydrops fetalis. 
Subjects under the age of 5 years at the time of informed consent with a confirmed diagnosis of MPS 7 
will be enrolled. Due to the extremely low prevalence of the disease, the sample size is not based on 
statistical considerations but rather the ability to find qualifying patients.  
Subjects who withdraw or are removed from the study after receiving study drug may be replaced on a 
case-by-case basis, at the discretion of Ultragenyx . 
DIAGNOSIS AND CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION:  
Individuals eligible to participate in this study must meet all of the following criteria:  
1. Confirmed diagnosis of MPS [ADDRESS_599480] glucuronidase enzyme assay, or 
genetic testing  
2. Under 5 years of age at the time of informed consent  
3. Written informed consent of Legally Authorized Representative after the nature of the study has 
been explained, and prior to any research-related procedures 
 

Protocol Number:  UX003- CL203  
Amendment 2: 07 APR 2016

Individuals who meet any of the following exclusion criteria will not be eligible to participate in the  
study: 
1. Undergone a successful bone marrow or stem cell transplant or has evidence of any degree of 
detectable chimaerism with donor cells  
2. Any known hypersensitivity to rhGUS  or its excipi[INVESTIGATOR_11792], in the judgment of the Investigator, 
places the subject at increased risk for adverse effects  
3. Use of any investigational product (drug or device or combination) other than UX003 within 
30 days prior to Screening, or requirement for any investigational agent prior to completion of all 
scheduled study assessments at any time during the study  
4. Has a condition of such severity and acuity, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], which may not 
allow safe study participation.  For patients with  hydrops fetalis, the ongoing interventions to 
manage fluid balance can be continued; if the addition of ERT is considered a fluid-overload risk, 
the individual should be excluded.  
5. Has a concurrent disease or condition that, in the view of the Investigator, places the subject at 
high risk of poor treatment compliance or of not completing the study, or would interfere with 
study participation or affect safety.  Since hydropic patients have a high rate of mortality, the risk 
of death prior to [ADDRESS_599481], DOSE AND MODE OF ADMINISTRATION:  
UX003 is a sterile liquid buffered saline formulation of rhGUS at a concentration of 2 mg/mL filled to allow withdrawal of a minimal of  5.0 mL deliverable volume and supplied in a 10 m L glass vial. 
UX003 will be administered at a dose of 4 mg/kg QOW  by [CONTACT_11835] 
4 hours.  Infusions will be administered on a rate schedule involving a slower infusion rate initially followed by [CONTACT_467851] ( IARs); the 
infusion rate may be slowed to manage or reduce IARs . 
REFERENCE THERAPY, DOSE AND MODE OF ADMINISTRATION:  
No reference  therapy will be administered in this study . 
DURATION OF TREATMENT:  
The planned duration of treatment in this study is [ADDRESS_599482] 48 weeks may continue treatment for up to 240 weeks (5 years) or until one of the following occurs: 
the patient withdraws consent, the patient is discontinued from the study at the discretion of the 
Investigator or Ultragenyx,  or the study is terminated . 
CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION:  
Safety Assessments:  
Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_467852] (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), including clinically significant changes from study baseline to scheduled time points in: 
• Physical examination findings  
• Vital signs and weight  
• Clinical laboratory evaluation s 
Protocol Number:  UX003- CL203  
Amendment 2: 07 APR 2016

• Concomitant medications  
• IgG antibodies to rhGUS 
• Complement C3, C4 and CH50 levels (as indicated) 
Management of Infusion Associated Reactions  
As has been observed in other MPS enzyme therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], some subjects may experience IARs associated 
with the administration of UX003. Consequently, appropriate measures have been incorporated into 
the study design in order to prevent, monitor and manage potential reactions. These measures include 
prophylactic premedication of subjects with antihistamine, and staged and controlled infusion rates to mitigate the potential for infusion reactions.  The protocol also incorporates measures to minimize 
pain and distress, including the optional use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_467835]- dwelling catheter.  
Primary Efficacy Variable: 
• Urinary GAG Excretion
:  First morning void urine will be evaluated for uGAG concentration and 
normalized to urinary creatinine concentration.  
Secondary Efficacy Variables:  
• Growth will be assessed by [CONTACT_467853] (length or 
sitting height as applicable) , head circumference,  and weight. Growth velocity will be calculated 
and compared with pre- treatment growth velocity when available  and published normative data 
for age and gender.  
• Hepatosplenomegaly :  The volume of the liver and spleen will be determined using ultrasound. If  
an ultrasound is not possible, the liver and spleen should be assessed by [CONTACT_117145]. 
The volume of liver and spleen will be compared to baseline and to normal values if available. 
Ascites will also be assessed.  
Tertiary Efficacy Variables:  
• Additional GAG measures  including serum GAG and supplementary uGAG assays  
• Clinical Global Impression Scale:  Physicians caring for each subject will provide a global 
assessment of change f rom baseline or change from identification of a new finding using a seven 
point scale ranging from -3 (severe worsening) to +3 (significant improvement).  The Clinical  
Global Impression (CGI) scale will be supported by [CONTACT_467854] a list of disease- specific 
abnormalities projected to respond to treatment.  
• Functional Development  will be assessed by [CONTACT_467855]® – Third Edition ( Bayley-III). 
• Motor Functioning will be assessed by a motor development milestone checklist. 
• Cardiac Ventricular Mass :  Ventricular mass will be assessed by [CONTACT_6751] (ECHO) and 
scored as a z -score relative to normal ventricular mass. Valvular and cardiac function may also be 
evaluated . 
• Pulmonary Function :  Pulse oximetry will be used to assess problems in adequate respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] ; 
resting O [ADDRESS_599483] is breathing room air.   
• Biochemical Markers of Bone Turnover (BTMs) : Levels of serum markers of bone formation and 
bone resorption will be measured including procollagen type 1 N-propeptide  (P1NP), carboxy-
terminal cross- linked telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX-I), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase 
(BALP), and vitamin D.

• Apparent volume of distribution at steady- state (V dss) 
STATISTICAL METHODS:  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the data. For continuous variables, the mean, the 
standard error, median, minimum, and maximum will be provided.  For categorical variables, the 
frequency and percent dist ributions will be provided.  Two-sided 95% confidence intervals will also 
be presented when appropriate.  
Analyses may be performed at any time during the study at the discretion of the Sponsor. There is no 
unblinding during analysis since it is an open-label study.  
Analysis Sets:  
The full analysis set will consist of all enrolled subjects who receive at least 1 dose of  UX003 during 
the study.  
Safety Analysis :   
The primary safety analysis will evaluate the safety of UX003 as measured by [CONTACT_11837], including clinically significant changes from baseline to scheduled time 
points in safety parameters.  
The incidence and frequency of AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_52140], relationship to study drug, and severity. No statistica l significance will be 
assessed. 
Clinical laboratory data will be summarized by [CONTACT_11876]. The frequency and percentage of subjects who experience abnormal clinical laboratory results (i.e. outside of reference 
ranges) and/or clinically significant abnormalities after study drug administration will be presented for 
each clinical laboratory measurement.  For each clinical laboratory measurement, descriptive statistics will be provided for baseline and all subsequent visits.  Changes from baseline to the post- treatment 
visits will also be provided.  Descriptive statistics of vital signs, imaging assessments, and concomitant medications will be provided in a similar manner.  
Changes in findings from baseline physical examinations will be tabulated and listed for each subject 
by [CONTACT_467856].  If there are examination findings that change in more than one subject, these 
will be tabulated in a separate table and expressed as the number of subject s with the change out of the 
total. 
Anti-drug antibody data will be tabulated  over the course of the study. The number of subjects 
converting to a positive antibody assay value defined as a titer increase of five-fold or more over baseline, and the time of  onset of a positive antibody response will be determined.  
Descriptive statistics on the titers achieved and the time of onset of the response will be provided 
(mean, standard deviation, median, range).

Efficacy Analyse s:   
The study is a small open- label study to obtain some clinical efficacy data from a small cohort  of these 
ultra-rare patients. A complete hypothesis testing statistical approach is not plausible in this setting, 
but a reasonable approach to assessing for the biologic efficacy of UX003 will be made.   
The primary efficacy analysis will evaluate the mean percent change in uGAG excretion from Week 0 
(Baseline)  to Week 48 using the generalized estimating equation ( GEE) analysis method .  
For subject(s) previously treated with UX003 under a n emergency  IND, perce nt change from initial 
baseline (prior to first dose of UX003) will be used, if the initial baseline data are available.  The null 
hypothesis of no change in mean uGAG excretion will be tested. An additional analysis will also be 
performed on the Week [ADDRESS_599484] treatment effects. Growth rate will be compared to historical data from medical records  and 
also compared to published norma tive data for age and gender  (if available) . Changes in findings from 
baseline for other efficacy variables will be tabulated for each subject.  Comparisons of certain efficacy 
variables with published normative data based on age and gender m ay also be conducted. 
A full description of the statistical evaluations will be provided in the Statist ical Analysis Plan .

5  INTRODUCTION 
Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are a group of inherited metabolic disor ders caused by 
[CONTACT_467857] (GAGs). Although many MPS characteristics are similar, each disease is 
a distinct entity arising from deficiency of a specific enzyme.  MPS 7 (Sly syndrome) is an 
ultra-rare, chronically debilitating, and life threatening lysosomal storage disease, and one of 
the rarest of the mucopolysaccharidoses. Varying in severity and progression rate, MPS 7 symptoms may include: abnormal coarsened facies, hepatosplenomegaly, pulmonary disease, cardiovascular complications, joint stiffness, short stature, and a skeletal disease known as dysostosis multiplex. Most MPS [ADDRESS_599502] decade of life due 
to compounding medical problems. So me MPS 7 patients present at birth with severe edema 
or non-immune hydrops fetalis and usually die within 2-4 months.   
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_467837] ( ERT) in MPS 7 models and the success of ERT in four other 
MPS disorders (MPS 1, MPS 2, MPS 4A and MPS 6), there is no  approved treatment 
available for MPS 7 . Development in this disease has not proceeded because the extreme 
rarity (less than 100 patients identified worldwide and an estimated incidence rate of less 
than 1 per 250,000 births ) and clinical heterogeneity has made it impractical to approach with 
traditional clinical study designs and endpoints.   
UX003 is a formulation of recombinant human beta- glucuronidase (rhGUS), intended as an 
ERT for MPS 7 . Ultragenyx has conducted multiple clinical studies to  support UX003 
development. Ongoing i nterventional studies include a Phase 1/2 study to assess safety, 
efficacy, and pharmacokinetics ( PK) of UX003 treatm ent, and a confirmatory randomized 
placebo-controlled Phase 3 study conducted in MPS 7 patients aged 5 – 35 years . 
Additionally , a Phase 3 long-term extension study to assess long- term safety and efficacy for 
patients who complete the phase 3 study or enrolled in other UX003 studies is on- going.  
This study is intended to assess the safety and efficacy of UX003 when administered to MPS 
7 patients less than  5 years of age.    
5.1 Overview of MPS 7 
MPS 7 (Sly syndrome) is an extremely rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder 
originally described by [CONTACT_11844] 1973 ( Sly et al. 1973). MPS [ADDRESS_599503] heterogeneous of the MPS disorders. MPS 7 is characterized by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme GUS, which is required for the degradation of two GAGs: dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate. This deficiency results in GAG accumulation in many tissues and organs, leading to numerous clinical symptoms similar to those observed for MPS 1 (Hurler Syndrome) and MPS 2 (Hunter Syndrome) ( Neufeld et al. 2001).

Amendment 2: 07 APR 2016

MPS 7 genotypes/phenotypes have been studied for many years (reviewed in ( Tomatsu et al. 
2009)). A total of 49 unique mutations were identified in a total of 103 mutant alleles found 
in 56 patients, with 9% of the alleles unidentified. Missense mutations account for 78.6% of 
total alleles; the remaining were nonsense mutations , deletions, or splice site mutations, all 
likely leading to a null genotype and severe phenotype. This is a much higher frequency of missense mutations than is normally found in other MPS diseases. For example, in MPS 1, nearly 70% of alleles are nonsense w ith two dominant stop mutations accounting for a large 
fraction of all mutations (Scott et al. 1995). 
The clinical course and disease progression of MPS [ADDRESS_599504] severe form of the disease can uniquely present at birth with hydrops fetalis, a severe neonatal condition in which the child retains an enormous amount of fluid throughout the body (Vervoort et al. 1996). Infants with hydrops fetalis rarely survive beyond a few 
weeks to a few m onths of age ( Neufeld et al. 2001 ).   
Patients with severe MPS 7, who are not born with hydrops fetalis, present as infants or young children with typi[INVESTIGATOR_467838] (MPS 1) -like features (Neufeld et al. 2001). Diagnosis of 
MPS 7 is often made through clinical examination and urine tests for excess glycosoaminoglycans excreted in the urine ( Sewell et al. 1982) . Due to the clinical 
heterogeneity of the disease, it is recommended that GUS activity in all suspected cases of lysosomal storage disease be evaluated through enzymatic analysis of leukocytes or fibroblasts ( Lee et al. 1985 ). Clinical features include hepatosplenomegaly, pulmonary 
infections,  cardiac problems, corneal clouding, hearing loss, hernias, joint stiffness, short stature and dysostosis multiplex.   
Many patients experience progressive pulmonary problems as a result of airway obstruction  (enlarged adenoids and tonsils, secretions, infections and tracheal abnormalities) leading to sleep apnea and pulmonary insufficiency, eventually requiring tracheostomy. Significant respi[INVESTIGATOR_467839] (Kakkis et 
al. 1996b);  (Neufeld et al. 2001) . Heart disease is also common in patients with severe MPS 
7, although it may not develop or manifest until later in life. Valvular insufficiency due to thickening and calcification of the valves, arterial lesions of the coronary arteries and obstruction of the thoracic aorta like that observed for Hurler syndrome, have been described (Kakkis et al. 1996b). In severely affected MPS 7 patients, GAG storage in the coronary 
vessels along with pulmonary insufficiency can lead to cardiomyopathy, cor pulmonale and/or death.   
MPS [ADDRESS_599505] a variety of the typi[INVESTIGATOR_467840]. This may include odontoid dysplasia with atalantoaxial instability as in other MPS disorders. Storage within the synovium and other joint tissues can lead to significant restriction of mobility in the hip, shoulder, elbow and knee joints as in other MPS disorders. All of these disease complications can result in severe pain or the inability to walk, often resulting in the use of a wheelchair. Additional symptoms include hearing loss, cataracts, and corneal clouding among others.

elosulfase alfa), and MPS 6 (Naglazym®, galsulfase).  At present, there are no approved 
treatments for MPS 7. Multiple clinical trials have been conducted to establish safety and efficacy of ERT in MPS diseases  ((Hendriksz et al. 2014) ; reviewed in (Valayannopoulos et 
al. 2011)). The treatment regimen for ERT involves weekly (QW) or every other week (QOW) intravenous (IV) infusions of the recombinant human enzyme.  Many patients treated 
with ERT experience infusion- associated reactions  (IARs).  Observed clinical benefits 
include improved walking ability, joint range of motion, improved lung function, decreased liver volume, and decreased (but not normalized) uGAG levels. Most MPS patients develop antibodies to the recombinant enzyme; in some severely affected MPS 1 patients, antibody titer was inversely related to the reduction in uGAG levels (Clarke et al. 2009 ).   
Clinical study data in the Phase [ADDRESS_599508] 4- 6 weeks of ERT treatment, then  reach a plateau  
(Wraith et al. 2004) , (Kakkis 2002) , (Harmatz et al. 2006) ; the clinical effect evolves over 
the next [ADDRESS_599509] tissue response.  In the clinical studies, changes in uGAG were able to differentiate between effective and less effective dose regimens, with reductions of >50% associated with substantial efficacy based on clinical measures ( Table 5.2.1). In all cases, uGAG reduction 
≥ 50% was associated with significant clinical benefit.  For idursulfase, the QOW regimen showed less than 50% reduction a nd less efficacy; this difference was detected and predicted 
by [CONTACT_11845] (Muenzer et al. 2006). For this reason, a measure of 
uGAG should be predictive of changes in lysosomal storage conducive to clinical improvement in  MPS patients.

5.3 Brief Overview of UX003 Development  
UX003 is intended as an IV ERT for the treatment of MPS 7. A brief overview of existing 
information on UX003 is provided below; a comprehensive review of available data is contained in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) provided by [CONTACT_467858]. (Ultragenyx ), which should be reviewed prior to initiating the study.   
5.3.1 Brief Description of UX003 
The active pharmaceutical ingredient in UX003, rhGUS, is produced in a genetically engineered Chinese hamster ovary cell line that expresses the normal full length human 
GUS protein. The rhGUS protein is synthesized as an 80 kDa monomer with 651 amino 
acids remaining after removal of the 22 amino acid signal peptide ( Oshima et al. 1987).  
After glycosylation at four N -linked glycosylation sites at asparagines 173, 272, [ADDRESS_599510] at the C-terminus after production, once delivered to the lysosome, proteolysis removes 18 amino acids from the C -terminal end to form a 78 kDa monomer  (Islam et al. 1993) . Biologically, 
purified rhGUS exists as a ~[ADDRESS_599511] chromatography methods and

[IP_ADDRESS] UX003 Mechanism of Action  in MPS7 
UX003 belongs to a class of ERTs that  includes approved products for MPS 1, MPS 2 , MPS 
4A, and MPS 6. The active pharmaceutical ingredient in UX003, rhGUS, is a member of the 
lysosomal hydrolase family of enzymes that catalyze breakdown of complex carbohydrates.  
Human GUS catalyzes the hydrolysis of β D- glucuronic acid residues from the non- reducing 
end of heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate ( Vervoort et al. 1996) . In vitro and in vivo, 
rhGUS is taken up by [CONTACT_467859] 6-phosphate receptor (CIM6PR) vi a the mannose 6 -phosphate recognition residues located on the 
enzyme’s N -linked oligosaccharides. Uptake by [CONTACT_11849]6PR occurs in a large number of 
tissues and is important for the maximal effectiveness of the enzyme. The enzyme can also be taken up by [CONTACT_11850] (MR) due to some terminal mannose residues located on high mannose N- linked oligosaccharides. Clearance by [CONTACT_467860]: the spleen, Kupffer cells in the liver, and circulating macrophages in the plasma. Together, these recognition signals are responsible for the rapid 
clearance and tissue distribution of infused lysosomal enzymes such as rhGUS from the circulation.  Both types of delivery can have therapeutic benefit as tissues with the MR also manifest substantial GAG storage in the MPS disorders, although the mannose 6-phosphate system is sufficient for uptake into all cell types . 
5.3.[ADDRESS_599512] been completed in MPS 7 mice  (including newborns). 
The nonclinical toxicology program includes five studies , including an 8- week 
biodistribution study in tolerant MPS 7 mice, a GLP acute toxicity study in Sprague 
Dawley rats, a 26-week chronic toxicity study in juvenile cynomolgus monkeys, and dose 
range-finding developmental toxicity studies  in rabbits and Sprague Dawley  rats. At dose 
levels up to 20 mg/kg QOW, no toxicologically -significant findings were related to the 
administration of UX003. These studies support a 5-fold safety factor relative to the 4 mg/kg  
dose planned in this clinical study. The no observed adverse- effect level (NOAEL) for sing le 
IV dose administration in these studies was 20 mg/kg. A large number of studies in MPS [ADDRESS_599513] shown that recombinant GUS 
distribute s to many tissues and significantly reduces or prevents lysosomal storage during 
treatment (O'Connor et al. 1998) , (Sands et al. 1994) , (Sands et al. 1997) , (Sands et al. 2001) , 
(Vogler et al. 1996), ( Vogler et al. 2005) . Biodistribution of rhGUS has been seen in many 
tissues affected by [CONTACT_11852] 7 including the brain, liver, spleen, heart, kidney, bone and lung (Vogler et al. 2005), ( Grubb et al. 2008), ( Sly et al. 2006).  The reduced lysosomal storage 
following ERT correlates with significant pathologic improvement and clinical benefit, with

prolonged effects including dramatic improvements in bone development, growth, cognitive 
ability, hearing, immune function, and survival ( Sands et al. 1997), ( Sands et al. 2001), 
(Vogler et al. 1996). Additionally, treatment of MPS 7 mice with high doses of rhGUS 
resulted in widespread delivery of enzyme as well as delivery across the blood- brain barrier 
with corresponding reductions in lysosomal storage in nearly all tissues, including the brain. 
The increased enzyme levels and accompanying reduction in lysosomal storage correlated with both dose and duration of treatment ( Vogler et al. 2005). Histopathologic evaluation of 
tissues from MPS [ADDRESS_599514] in -human use of UX003 was sponsored by  [CONTACT_467861]'s Medical Center of [LOCATION_001] under an emergency IND granted by [CONTACT_55257]. A  old patient with advanced multi- system MPS 7 including 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_467841] 2 mg/kg rhGUS  QOW; the case study and results 
following initial treatment were recently reported (Fox et al. 2014). Through 24 weeks of 
treatment, a decline in uGAG excretion (~ 65%) and a sustained reduction in the size of the 
enlarged liver and spleen have been observed. The data through 52 weeks also show improved pulmonary function, oral feeding, and increased activity level. No drug- related 
serious adverse events ( SAEs) or IARs have been reported (Fox et al . 2015). 
A second emergency IND was granted to treat a  old MPS 7 infant born with severe hydrops fetalis ( , [LOCATION_001] University School of Medicine). The patient has 
received infusions for 48 weeks ; uGAG was reduced by [CONTACT_3450] 70% after several 
infusions. No drug- related IAR s have occurred  in this Investigator sponsored trial.   
An open-label Phase 1/2 study in 3 subjects aged 5, 9, and 25 years is ongoing to assess the 
safety, efficacy, and dose of UX003 in MPS 7 subjects via IV administration QOW for 36 weeks with provisions for additional tr eatment during the Continuation Period

5.4 Summary of Overall Risks and Potential Benefits 
An initial Phase 1/2 study has shown that UX003 can reduce lysosomal storage and uG AG 
and is expected to provide clinical benefit. Data from nonclinical toxicology and safety 
pharmacology studies, along with published data from MPS 7 mouse model studies, provide guidance on potential benefits and risks of UX003 treatment. The nonclinical data support the safe use of  UX003 when dosed at 4 mg/kg (5- fold safety factor ). The risk for off- target 
effects is reduced by [CONTACT_467862]. The enzymati c activity of GUS has a pH 
optimum between 3.5 and 4.5 (data on file). At pH 7 near the pH of plasma, enzymatic activity is drastically reduced. Hence, the ability of GUS to degrade heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate outside of the lysosome is limited.  
In addition, an understanding of the benefits and risks associated with ERT for other closely related MPS disorders makes it possible to anticipate benefit-risk profile with UX003.  Clinical trial data and experience with marketed ERT products for the treatment of related 
MPS disorders (MPS 1, MPS 2 , MPS 4A, and MPS 6) supports the safety and efficacy of 
MPS ERT as a class. These therapi[INVESTIGATOR_467842] 
[ADDRESS_599516] also been conducted in MPS 1, MPS 2, MPS 4A, and MPS 6 patients less than 
5 years of age, showing benefit in reducing storage and improving some aspects of disease 
(Wraith et al. 2007) , (Giugliani et al. 2 014), (Haller et al. 2013) , (Lampe et al. 2014). 
Early treatment with ERT can provide important benefit s in improving growth, skeletal 
disease and overall clinical outcome (Laraway et al. 2013). 
The most common adverse effects of ERT relate to increased antibody titers and IARs.  
There have been no other consistent adverse effects across the different MPS disorders.  
Though IARs represent the most serious safety concern with ERTs, appropriate measures have been incorporated into the design of the current study to prevent, monitor and manage potential reactions.  These measures include prophylactic premedication of subj ects with 
antihistamine, and staged and controlled infusion rates.  The large fraction of MPS 7 patients 
with missense mutations are expected to  exhibit a reduced immune response to ERT due to 
the presence of residual protein, consistent with observations in the tolerant mouse ( Sly et al. 
2001) and MPS 1 patients  undergoing ERT ( Yogalingam et al. 2004).  
The clinical experience with UX003 in pediatric and adult patients with MPS 7 has 
demonstrated a sustained reduction in uGAG levels and clinical improvement. With no treatments currently available for this progressive, ultimately -fatal genetic ultra- rare disease, 
a clear medical need exists for a novel disease-modifying approach that holds the potential

Amendment 2: 07 APR 2016 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential Page 27 
for altering the clinical course of disease progressi on. Overall the safety and efficacy data 
from clinical and nonclinical studies in combination with an understanding of the risks 
associated with ERTs for other MPS disorders indicate the benefit -risk ratio of UX003 is 
sufficient to support treatment of ped iatric MPS 7 patients less than 5 years of age . 
5.5 Study Rationale 
MPS 7 is an ultra-rare (< 100 cases currently identified worldwide), chronically debilitating, 
and life-threatening lysosomal storage disease.  Some MPS 7 patients present at birth with severe edema or non -immune hydrops fetalis and usually die within 2-4 months. There are 
currently no approved treatments for MPS 7. UX003 is intended as an ERT for the treatment of MPS 7. A Phase 1/2 study has shown that treatment with UX003 can reduce lysosomal storage and uGAG and is expected to provide clinical benefit; a pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 study is ongoing.   
Patients with MPS 7 can present as newborns, infants or young children; this Phase [ADDRESS_599517] the same underlying etiology, the breadth and type of clinical problems can be different, including more frequent ascites/edema, cardiac problems, and other severe manifestations. This study will assess the relative safety, PK, and efficacy of UX003 ERT in young patients with MPS 7 .

7 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
UX003-CL203 is an open- label, multicenter, Phase 2 study to assess the safety and efficacy 
of UX003 in pediatric MPS 7 subjects. The study seeks to enroll approximately 15 subjects 
less than 5 years of age at the time of informed consent, and will attempt to include 
approximately 5 infants with hydrops fetalis if possible. Subjects with prior exposure to UX003 treatment under a n emergency  IND may also be enrolled at the discretion of the 
Sponsor. In the initial 48 weeks of treatment, subjects will receive UX003 via IV infusion at a dose of 4 mg/kg QOW. Subjects who complete the 48-week study may choose to continue UX003 treatment in the Continuation Period up to [ADDRESS_599518] is discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investig ator or 
Ultragenyx,  or the study is terminated . Figure 7.1.1 provides a schematic of the overall study 
design. 
Figure 7.1.1: UX003-CL203 Study Schema  
 
7.2 Discussion of Study Design, Including Choice of Control Group 
Given the history of ERT in the MPS field, this study is expected to show that UX003 (rhGUS) can reduce lysosomal storage and improve clinical function in MPS 7 patients less than 5 years of age with an acceptable benefit -risk ratio. The population of MPS 7 patients 
less than 5 years of age is very small and heterogeneous; therefore it is not feasible to 
conduct a parallel group or placebo -controlled study to assess safety and efficacy. 
To demonstrate the safety and efficacy of UX003, two interventional stu dies are being  
conducted in pediatric and adult MPS [ADDRESS_599519] has demonstrated acceptable long -term 
safety and efficacy following the initial 48 weeks of treatment, continuation of UX003

Amendment 2: [ADDRESS_599520] 5 infants with 
hydrops fetalis , if possible; subjects with prior exposure to UX003 treatment under an 
emergency  IND may also be enrolled at the discretion of the Sponsor. The inclusion criteria 
are structured to enroll subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of MPS 7. To enroll subjects 
most likely to benefit from treatment and demonstrate safety and effectiveness of UX003, MPS [ADDRESS_599521] meet all of the following criteria:  
1. Confirmed diagnosis of MPS [ADDRESS_599522] glucuronidase enzyme assay, or genetic testing  
2. Under 5 years of age at the time of informed consent 
3. Written informed consent of Legally Authorized Representative after the nature of the study has been explained, and prior to any research- related procedures  
7.3.2 Exclusion Criteria  
Individuals who meet any of the following exclusion criteria will not be eligible to participate in the study:  
1. Undergone a successful bone marrow or stem cell transplant or has evidence of any degree of detectable chimaerism with donor cells  
2. Any known hypersensitivity to rhGUS  or its excipi[INVESTIGATOR_11792], in the judgment of the 
Investigator, places the subject at increased risk for adverse effects

Amendment 2: [ADDRESS_599523] (drug or device or combination) other than UX003 
within 30 days prior to Screening, or requirement for any investigational agent prior to completion of all scheduled study assessments at any time during the study  
4. Has a condition of such severity and acuity, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], which may not allow safe study participation.  For patients with hydrops fetalis, the ongoing interventions to manage fluid balance can be continued; if the addition of ERT is considered a fluid-overload risk, the individual should be excluded.  
5. Has a concurrent disease or condition tha t, in the view of the Investigator, places the 
subject at high risk of poor treatment compliance or of not completing the study, or would interfere with study participation or affect safety.  Since hydropic patients have a high rate of mortality, the risk of death prior to [ADDRESS_599524] or Investigator due to poor enrollment or noncompliance, as applicable. 
Subjects may be removed from the study for the following reasons: 
• Occurrence of an unacceptable AE  
• An illness that, in the judgment of the Investigator or Ultragenyx, might place the subject 
at risk or invalidate the study  
• At the request of the subje ct (or legally authorized representative) , Investigator, or 
Ultragenyx, for administrative or other reasons 
• Protocol deviation or unreliable behavior 
If the reason for removal of a subject from the study is an AE, the AE and any related test or 
procedure results will be recorded in the source documents and transcribed onto the case report form (CRF ).  Each clinically significant abnormal laboratory value or other clinically 
meaningful abnormality should be followed until the abnormality resolves or until a decision is made that it is not likely to resolve.  If such abnormalities do not return to normal within

medical issues will be assessed as to whether t he subject will continue on the study.   
The Institutional Review Board ( IRB)/Ethics Committee ( EC) will be informed should 
unexpected and possibly, probably, or definitely study drug-related SAEs occur. A full

7.4 Treatments  
UX003 is a sterile liquid buffered saline formulation of rhGUS at a concentration of 
2 mg/mL filled to allow withdrawal of a 5.0 mL deliv erable volume and supplied in a 10 mL 
glass vial. UX003 will be administered at a dose of 4 mg/kg QOW by [CONTACT_467864] 4 hours. Infusions will be administered on a rate schedule involving a slower infusion rate initially followed by [CONTACT_467865]; the infusion rate may be slowed to manage or reduce IARs. Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for full details on study drug preparation and administration.   
7.4.[ADDRESS_599526] 
UX003 (recombinant human beta-glucuronidase, rhGUS) is a multimeric glycoprotein 
produced using a genetically engineered Chinese hamster ovary cell line to secrete the 
human lysosomal enzyme, beta-glucuronidase. The mature form of the enzyme consists of [ADDRESS_599527] is formulated at 2 mg/mL rhGUS in UX003 formulation 
buffer (refer to the Pharmacy Manual for buffer excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]) . UX003 is supplied as a sterile 
solution for IV administration packaged in single use 10 mL glass vials and is stored at 2 to 8°C. 
The study drug is manufactured, packaged, and labeled according to current Good 
Manufacturing Practice ( cGMP) regulations.

7.4.3 Study Drug Infusion Procedure  
Study drug (UX003) will be administered QOW by [CONTACT_11858] a period of 
approximately [ADDRESS_599528], until the planned maximum rate is reached.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Pre-Dose Medication  
The subject should fast for a minimum of [ADDRESS_599529] is tolerating the infusion, clear liquids or oral electrolyte solutions (e.g. Pedialyte) may be instituted. This requirement may be removed if after 12 weeks of 
treatment, the Investigator feels that the patient is fully tolerating infusions.  
Approximately 30 – [ADDRESS_599530] a history of IARs or other risk factors (e.g. history of 
allergies), a sedating antihistamine (e.g. diphenhydramine or chlorphe niramine) may be 
administered. IV antihistamine (diphenhydramine dihydrochloride) may be used for 
premedication if oral is not acceptable, but the doses should be one- half the usual dose when 
given IV due to a potential increased sensitivity to these agents in MPS patients ([CONTACT_467879], personal observations). Antipyretic medications such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen may be administered at the d iscretion of the Investigator. For subj ects with IARs, slowing the 
infusion rate is important but additional premedication with agents such as H
2 blockers, 
stronger anti- histamines,  or glucocorticoid s may be considered . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Infusion Procedure  
The amount of study drug (UX003) will be determined based on the most recent subject 
weight (in kg). The volume of study drug calculated to deliver the correct dose will be withdrawn from the vial and aseptically transferred to an infusion bag of normal saline for a final 2-[ADDRESS_599531] never be infused. 
PLEASE NOTE FOR PREPARATION OF INFUSION SOLUTIONS :  UX003 (rhGUS) 
is a recombinant protein and is therefore sensitive to bubbles and aggressive mixing that can lead to denaturatio n and loss of enzyme activity. When preparing diluted infusion solutions, 
the product should be withdrawn VERY SLOWLY through a sufficiently large needle (18 gauge) to minimize shear and turbulence. When adding study drug solution to an infusion 
bag, this must be done slowly, with liquid to liquid contact [CONTACT_11859]; the bags should be rocked gently for mixing. Shaking of vials or infusion bags or “volutrols” devices in which aggressive mixing and bubbles can occur are not acceptable.  
Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for complete instructions on calculating drug dosage and preparation.  
Protocol Number:  UX003- CL203  
Amendment 2: 07 APR 2016 
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential Page 34 
Study drug will be administered by [CONTACT_467866] 4 hours. 
Infusions will be administered on a rate -schedule involving a slower infusion rate initially 
followed by [CONTACT_467867]. Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for additional details on the infusion rate schedule. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_467843] (EMLA) cream or 
equivalent may be applied to the IV site prior to the infusion to ease the pain of placing an IV line. 
A second IV site on the opposite arm from the infusion will be used for the blood samples taken for PK analy sis. At the discretion of the Investigator, an in- dwelling IV catheter (such 
as a Port-a-Cath
® or other brand) may be inserted if there are difficulties in achieving IV 
access for the QOW infusions. If the second IV fails and PK samples cannot be collected  
from the second IV, the main IV line may be use for the post-infusion sampling after flushing the line thoroughly with saline. The samples taken through the same line as the infusion 
should be noted on the CRF as being drawn from the same line.  
Equipment necessary for resuscitation must be available during study drug infusion. 
7.4.4 Selection of Doses and Study Duration  
The planned UX003 dose of 4 mg/kg is based on data from clinical studies in pediatric and 
adult MPS 7 patients, and further supported by [CONTACT_467868] 7 mouse 
model and relevant species . The nonclinical data support chronic QOW administration of 
UX003 at dose levels up to 4 mg/kg, providing a 5-fold safety factor.   
The therapeutic ERT doses in prior successful programs for other MPS disorders (0.58, 0.5, 
2 and 1 mg/kg weekly for MPS 1, 2, 4A and 6, respectively) were based on comparable doses that exhibited efficacy in their respective animal models. PK data in MPS 1, MPS 2 , MPS 4A 
and MPS 6 subjects demonstrate that doses of 0.2 to 2 mg/kg are adequate to achieve enzyme concentrations of ~10-207 nM in the circulation.  These enzyme levels are 
approximately 10- to 30-fold the uptake constants (1-7 nM) for the mannose 6 phosphate receptor and are believed to saturate delivery of enzyme to the tissues (Kakkis et al. 1994) ; 
(Kakkis et al. 1996a ); (Kakkis et al. 2001) ; (Dvorak-Ewell et al. 2010). Similar uptake 
constants (1.2-2.6 nM) were obtained in studies with human MPS [ADDRESS_599532] cel ls in vitro 
(Ultragenyx data). Studies with rhGUS in MPS 7 mice at doses of 4 mg/kg show that serum 
GUS concentrations of >10-fold the uptake constant were readily achieved and demonstrated that enzym e was delivered to a variety of important tissues, implying that the efficacious 
dose should be within this range ( Grubb et al. 2008). 
The QOW dosing regimen is supported by [CONTACT_11862] -life and increased stability of 
rhGUS compared with other MPS enzymes. Data from the earliest MPS ERT studies showed 
that when human enzymes for MPS 1 or 2 were applied to deficient human fibroblasts, the half-life of the enzyme in the lysoso me was on the order of 2-5 days  (Kakkis et al. 1994);  
(Elaprase 2006)  leading to weekly dosing frequency as the optimal choice.  For rhGUS, this 
experiment showed a half -life of about 40 days, which is a substantial increase over MPS 1 
Protocol Number:  UX003- CL203  
Amendment 2: [ADDRESS_599533] 48 weeks may continue for up to 240 weeks (5 years), or until one of the following occurs: the subject  withdraws consent, the subject  is discontinued from the study at the 
discretion of the Investigator or Ultragenyx, or the study is terminated . 
7.4.5 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Eligible subjects will be enrolled in the study and sequentially assigned an identification 
number. All subjects will receive active treatment (UX003); there is only one treatment group in the study. 
7.4.6 Blinding 
The study drug will be administered open- label; no study participants will be blinded to study 
treatment . 
7.4.7 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
[IP_ADDRESS] Prohibited Medications  
Subjects may not be enrolled if they have used any investigational product other than UX003

Amendment 2: [ADDRESS_599535] be obtained prior to any Screening procedures. The Baseline 
(Week 0) visit must take place within 30 days of the Screeni ng visit. Screening assessments 
(physical exam and safety labs) performed within [ADDRESS_599536] dose of study drug  
may be used for Baseline  assessments. Subjects will be treated only after all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria have been confirmed. Baseline assessments must be completed 
within [ADDRESS_599537] be performed prior to the infusion.   
Subjects will return to the clinic at 2 -week intervals (± 3 days) throughout the 48- week 
Treatment Period  for study drug infusion and basic safety  measures . Major assessment 
visits (Weeks 12, 24, 36, and 48) are scheduled at 12-week intervals (± 7 days). 
All assessments scheduled for a treatment day must be completed prior to the infusion on that 
day. For subjects who discontinue prior to completing the study, every reasonable effort 
should be made to perform the Early Termination visit procedures within [ADDRESS_599538] dose of study drug .   
Following completion of the 48- week Treatment Period, subjects may participate in the 
Continuation Period for up to 240 weeks. Subjects will return to the clinic for UX003 
administration every 2 weeks; additional assessments will be conducted at 12, 24 or 48- week 
intervals (± 7 days).  
7.5.1 Schedule of Events  
The parameters to be assessed in Study UX003 -CL203, along with timing of assessments, are 
provided in the Schedule of Events ( Table 2.1 and Table 2.2). Refer to the Study Reference 
Manual for additional details on specific assessments.  For any given study visit, i f the 
maximum amount of blood has been taken based on Maximum Allowable Blood Volume Guidelines for any subject, some assessments are not required; see the Lab Manual for details on prioritizing blood draws.

performed within 30 days will not be repeated at the termination visit.   
7.5.2 Efficacy Measures  
The primary efficacy variable in this study, uGAG excretion, will provide a biochemical measure of t he biological action of UX003. The primary efficacy measure will be supported 
by [CONTACT_467869]003 efficacy in 
MPS 7 patients less than 5 years of age.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Efficacy Measure :  Urinary GAG Excretion  
Clinical evidence for the use of uGAG as a relevant primary endpoint is based on nonclinical research work over [ADDRESS_599541] within the therapeutic range of doses and verified the sustained long- term effects of the ERT. The overall summary 
of these data show that uGAG reductions above a threshold of >50% are associated with clinically meaningful changes in clinical parameters in all three MPS ERT programs.  
First morning void urine will be evaluated  for uGAG at the time points listed in the schedule 
of events ( Table 2.1).  Urine samples will be collected once during Screening Period and on 
two separate days during the Baseline Period  (Week 0). Urine samples must be collected 
from first morning voids to assure the urine is adequately concentrated . Samples will be 
evaluated for uGAG concentration  and normalized to uri nary creatinine concentration.  
Refer to the Laboratory Manual for details on sample collection and processing requirements. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Efficacy Measures  
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Growth 
Growth will be assessed as a secondary efficacy measure to assess changes in growth 
velocity and comparisons to normative data matched for age and gender. A nthropometric 
measurements include standing height ( recumbent length or sitting height as appropriate), 
head circumference,  and weight , and will be obtained at twelve-week intervals beginning at 
the Baseline visit (Week 0). Every effort should be ma de to collect standing height. If unable 
to collect standing height, sitting height or length should be collected for that subject.  
Growth velocity will be calculated and compared with pre-treatment growth velocity when available.  Anthropometric measure ments may also be compared to normative reference data 
matched for age and gender. Refer to the Study Reference Manual for additional details on 
anthropometric measurements.

[IP_ADDRESS].2 Hepatosplenomegaly 
The volume of the liver and spleen will be determined using ultrasound and compared with 
normal values for age and gender  if available ; ascites will also be assessed.  Ultrasounds will 
be conducted at the Baseline (Week 0) and Week 12, 24, and 48 (or Early Termination) study visits. During the Continuation Period, an ultrasound of the liver and spleen will be 
performed annually (every 48 weeks). If an ultrasound cannot be performed, liver and spleen 
size may be assessed qualitatively by [CONTACT_117145].  Ultrasound will not be performed at the 
ET visit if the assessment was conducted within 1 month of termination.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Tertiary Efficacy Measures  
The following tertiary  efficacy variables will also be evaluated in the study.  Refer to the 
Study Reference Manual for additional details. [IP_ADDRESS].1 Serum and Supplementary Urinary GAG Measures  
Abnormal (pathologic) GAG in the serum will be assessed . One serum sample should be 
collected prior to dosing at the Baseline, Weeks 12, 24, 36, and  48 visits during the 
Treatment Period . . Supplementary  assays for uGAG may be performed; samples will be 
collected as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Clinical Global Impression Scale 
The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale was developed for use in National Institute of 
Mental Health -sponsored clinical trials to provide a brief, stand-a lone assessment of the 
clinician's view of the patient's global functioning prior to and after initiating a study 
medication (Guy 1976). The CGI provides an overall clinician- determined  summary measure 
that takes into account all available information, including knowledge of the patient's history, psychosocial circumstances, symptoms, behavior, and the impact of the symptoms on the patient's ability to function . The Sponsor has developed an MPS disease- specific and 
age-appropriate version  of the CGI (also referred to as the Physician Global Impression of 
Change [PGI-C] in some studies) to be used in this study.  
Physicians caring for each subject will provide a global assessment of change using a seven point scale ranging from -3 (severe worsening) to +3 (significant improvement). The CGI 
score will be supported by [CONTACT_467870] a new 
finding based on a list of disease -specific abnormalities projected to respond to treatment.    
The CGI will be evaluated at the Baseline (Week 0) visit and  at 12-week intervals through out 
the Treatment  Period and Continuation Period.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Functional Development  
Functional Development will be assessed by [CONTACT_467871] – Third Edition ( Bayley-III). The instrument will be administer ed at Baseline 
(Week 0), and at the Week 24 and 48 (or Early Termination) study visits. During the

Proprietary and Confidential Page 39 
Continuation Period, the Bayley -III will be completed at 48-week intervals . Bayley-III will 
not be performed at the ET visit if the assessment was conducted within 1 month of 
termination.   
The Bayley-III (Bayley 2006 ) is a standard series of measurements developed to assess the 
motor (fine and gross), language (receptive and expressive), and cognitive development of infants and toddlers, aged [ADDRESS_599542], testing may be omitted at that visit.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_599543] will be assessed at Baseline (Week 0), and at the Week 24 and 48 (or Early Termination) study visits. During the Continuation Period, the gross motor milestone checklist will be completed at 48-week intervals . The checklist will not be completed  at the 
ET visit if conducted within 1 month of termination. 
[IP_ADDRESS].5 Cardiac Ventricular Mass  
Ventricular mass will be assessed by [CONTACT_6751] (ECHO) and scored as a z -score 
relative to normal ventricular mass. Valvular and cardia c function may also be evaluated .  
An ECHO performed within three months prior to the Baseline visit may be used for the 
study baseline ECHO provided cardiac ventricular mass can be calculated.  ECHO will be 
performed at the Baseline (Week 0) and Week 48 (or Early Termination) study visits.   
During the Continuation Period, ECHO will be assessed annually (every 48 weeks). [IP_ADDRESS].6 Pulmonary Function Testing  
In young patients, traditional pulmonary function testing (i.e. spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]) is difficult to 
perform, but measuri ng pulse oximetry can help assess basic problems in adequate

[IP_ADDRESS].7 Biochemical Markers of Bone Turnover  
Biochemical markers of bone turnover (BTMs) will be evaluated as an indicator of changes 
in bone metabolism in response to UX003 treatment. BTMs in serum include procollagen type 1 N-propeptide (P1NP), carboxy- terminal cross -linked telopeptide of type I collagen 
(CTX-I), bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP)  and vitamin D. Serum samples will be 
collected at the Baseline (Week 0) and Week 2, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40 and 48 visits (or Early 
Termination). Bone turnover markers will be assessed at 24 -week intervals during the 
Continuation Period. 
7.5.3 Drug Concentration Measurements  
The concentration of rhGUS in the blood will be measured to characterize the PK of UX003 
following a single dose and multiple doses. Blood samples for PK analysis will be obtained 
at Weeks 0 (Baseline), 24, and 48. PK s amples will be collected prior to the infusion (pre-
dose), [ADDRESS_599545] infusion. 
Samples may be obtained by [CONTACT_467872], indwelling catheters, peripherally 
inserted central catheter (PI[INVESTIGATOR_6875]) line or by [CONTACT_467873]. 
The indwelling or PI[INVESTIGATOR_467846]. Collection and processing instructions can be found in Laboratory Manual. The same IV line post-infusion end, may be used if the primary line fails, but extensive saline flushing of the line should occur before drawing PK.  
7.5.4 Safety Measures  & General Assessments 
General assessments include medical history , demographics and weight for study drug 
preparation ( Section [IP_ADDRESS]). Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_5205], frequency and 
severity of AEs and SAEs, including clinically significant changes from study baseline to 
scheduled time points in vital signs , weight, physical examination, clinical laboratory 
evaluations, and concomitant medications. To assess the immune response to UX003, 
the development of IgG antibodies to rhGUS will be evaluated  as indicated  in the Schedule 
of Events. Complement C3, C4, and CH50 levels will also be evaluated if a drug -related 
hypersensitivity reaction is suspected . Refer to the Study Reference Manual for additional 
details. 
To further characterize the disease manifestations, severity and progression of MPS 7, the sponsor aims to determine the specific genetic mutation in each patient enrolled if consent is provided for such testing. Th is optional assessment can be performed at week 1 6 
or at different time -point if total blood volume at week 16 may  exceed maximum allowable 
volume.

[IP_ADDRESS] Medical History  
A complete medical history will be obtained at the Screening visit. At the Baseline visit, any 
changes in medical history since Screening  will be recorded . General medical information 
includes subject demographics (date of birth, ethnicity, and sex) and a history of major medical illnesses, diagnoses, and surgeries. Growth history for height a nd weight will be 
collected. Pretreatment measurements of height and weight should be collected from the records if possible to assure a pre and post treatment growth rate can be assessed.  MPS7 
treatment history and relevant concomitant medications will be  recorded (start date, stop 
date, dose, dose regimen). Medications include prescription, over-the-counter, herbal and nutritional supplements. Any relevant concomitant therapy, including physical/occupational therapy will be recorded.    
[IP_ADDRESS] Weight 
During the i nitial 48-week Treatment Period, w eight will be obtained at each visit  to 
determine appropriate study drug volume for the subsequent visit, and for safety  (refer to 
Pharmacy Manual for instructions on calculating drug dosage). During the Continuation Period, weight will be obtained at 12-week intervals (in conjunction with anthropometric 
measurements). Weight will be measured in kilograms using a scale.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Physical Examination 
Complete physical examinations will be performed at the Screening, Baseline, Week 12, 24, 
36, and 48 study visits (or Early Termination Visit). During the Continuation Period, physical examinations will be conducted at 12- week intervals. Physical examinations will include 
assessments of general appearance; head , eyes, ears, nose, and throat; the cardiovascular, 
dermatologic, lymphatic, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gastrointestinal, genitourinary, neurological, and musculoskeletal systems . If the subject exhibits signs or symptoms of weakness or other new 
neurological findings, evaluate for cord compression (e.g. reflexes and motor strength).

blood samples taken for safety laboratory tests . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Antibodies to rhGUS 
Prior Phase [ADDRESS_599548] on enzyme distribution and efficacy ( Dickson et al. 2008).  
To determine the immunogenicity profile of UX003, testing for IgG antibodies directed 
against rhGUS will take place at Baseline (Week 0)  and the Week 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48 
(or Early Termination) visits.  During the Continuation Period, anti -drug antibody screening 
will occur at [ADDRESS_599549] be collected before 
infusion of study drug.  For subjects with a positive antibody and/or IAR response, further laboratory evaluation of the immune response to UX003 (i.e. antibodies and complement) may be conducted if warranted . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant medications will be reviewed and recorded in the subject’s CRF at each study visit, beginning at the S creening visit. Medications (investigational, prescription, 
over-the-counter, and herbal) and nutritional supplements taken during the 30 days prior to Screening will be reviewed and recorded. At each subsequent visit, change in medications since the previous visit will be recorded. A discussion of prohibited and permit ted 
medications is provided in Section  7.4.7.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Complement Levels  
Complement components will be assessed to characterize the immune response following a 
drug-related IAR. For subjects who experience an IAR  that is potentially a 
complement -mediated (anaphylactoid) hypersensitivity reaction, blood samples will be 
drawn pre- and immediately post-infusion during the subsequent infusion for measurement of the change in C3,  C4 and CH50 levels during an infusion. Refer to the Laboratory Manual 
for additional details on sample processing. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events  
All AEs will be recorded from the time the subject signs the informed consent until [ADDRESS_599550] dose of study drug . The determination, evaluation, reporting, and follow-up of 
AEs will be performed as outlined  in Section 8.5. At each visit subjects will be asked  about 
any new or ongoing  AEs since the previous visit. Assessments of AEs will occur at each 
study visit. 
Clinically significant changes from study baseline in physical examination findings, weight, 
vital signs, and clinical laboratory parameters , will be recorded as AEs or SAEs, if 
appropriate.

gastrointestinal, skeletal, and central nervous systems . In a multinational study of Laronidase 
in MPS I patients younger than 5 years, clinical responses in liver si ze and left ventric ular 
hypertrophy were observed ( Wraith et al. 2007). Pulse oximetry  will be conducted to assess 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798], an important component of disease progression and mortality in MPS 7 subjects.  ECHO, ultrasound, and anthropometrics are routine, non-invasive procedures inflicting minimal pain/distress for the subject, while providing relevant indicators of clinical disease phenotype and progression.   
The Bayley-III is useful for assessing the compounded impact of multisystem clinical 
manifestations on the cognitive, motor, and adaptive behavioral development of infants and 
toddlers. In MPS 7, development in these domains is likely to be affected by [CONTACT_42020]-morbidit ies present in these subjects  (McDonald et al. 2010). The  Bayley-III may not be 
reliably administered.to all subjects, therefore a m otor milestone checklist is also included as 
an assessment of gross motor functioning and development. The checklist developed for this 
trial requires limited language interaction o r physical handling and allows for a gross motor 
assessment across all subjects .  
Assessments of serum markers of bone formation and bone resorption were included to measure the biochemical markers of bone turnover, which may enable evaluation of the 
effects of UX003 on skeletal tissue. 
Measurements of UX00 [ADDRESS_599552] assessments such as recording of medical history, AEs and SAEs, physical examination, vital signs, serum chemistry  and hematology , urinalysis, concomitant medications, and other routine clini cal

C4 and CH50 levels (as indicated) will be determined as a measure of UX003 
immunogenicity . Since the study population is  comprised of pediatric subjects, 
age-appropriate safety and  efficacy measures have been incorporated into the study design.

The primary efficacy analysis will evaluate th e mean percent change in uGAG excretion 
from Week 0 (Baseline) to Week 48 using the generalized estimating equation (GEE) 
analysis method.  For subject(s) previously treated with UX003 under a n emergency  IND, 
percent change from initial baseline (prior to first dose of UX003) will be used, if the initial 
baseline data are available. The null hypothesis of no change in mean uGAG excretion will be tested. An additional analysis will also be performed on the Week [ADDRESS_599554] treatment effects.  Growth rate will be compared to historical data  
obtained from medical history and records (if available), and also compared to published normative data for age and gender. Changes in findings from Baseline for other efficacy 
variables will be tabulated for each subject. Comparisons of certain efficacy variables with published normative data based on age a nd gender may als o be conducted.

The following PK parameters will be calculated from the plasma concentrations of rhGUS measured in these blood samples: 
• Area under the plasma concentration -time curve (AUC) from time zero to infinity 
(AUC
0 -∞) 
• AUC from time zero to the time of last measurable concentration (AUC 0-last) 
• Maximum plasma concentration (C max) 
• Time to maximum plasma concentration (T max)

be unable to continue maintenance of subject files for the full [ADDRESS_599566] medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE  can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) products. 
A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the AE.  For the purposes of expedited safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” 
means there is  evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. 
Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug.  
Life-threatening AE or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction is an AE or suspected 
adverse reaction that, in the view of either the Investigator  or Ultragenyx , places the patient 
or subject at immediate risk of death.  It does not include an AE  or suspected adverse reaction 
that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
An SAE or serious suspected adverse reaction is an AE  or suspected adverse reaction that at 
any dose, in the view of either the Investigator  or Ultragenyx , results in any of the following 
outcomes:

• Death 
• A life-threatening AE 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Note that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_467848] (e.g. for elective surgeries) are 
not considered SAEs. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11819]- existing conditions that are 
scheduled after study enrollment are considered SAEs. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition.  
8.5.2 Severity of Adverse Events  
Wherever possible, t he severity of all AEs will be graded using the NCI  CTCAE (version 
4.0).  The  majority of AEs can be graded using this system. 
If an AE cannot be graded using the CTCAE criteria, it should be graded as mild, moderate, severe, life-threatening, or death using the following definitions.  
• Mild (Grade 1): Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated and of a minor 
irritant typ e, causing no loss of time from normal activities.  Symptoms do not require 
therapy or a medical evaluation; signs and symptoms are transient. 
• Moderate (Grade 2): Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the participant and may interfere  with daily activities, but are usually improved by [CONTACT_11884]; moderate experiences may cause some interference with 
functioning. 
• Severe (Grade 3): Events interrupt the participant’s normal daily activities and generally 
require systemic drug therapy or other treatment; they are usually incapacitating.  
• Life-threatening (Grade 4): Events that place the participant at immediate risk of death or 
are disabling.  
• Death (Grade 5): Events that result in death.  
To make sure there is no confusion or misunderstanding of the difference between the terms 
"serious" and "severe," which are not synonymous, the following note of clarification is provided.  The term "severe" is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may

be of relatively minor medical significa nce (such as severe headache). This is not the same as 
"serious" which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with 
events that pose a threat to a subject's life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
8.5.3 Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug  
The Investigator will assess the potential relatio nship of the AE to study drug using the 
following descriptions. Categories of attributions for “Unr elated” events:  
• Unrelated:  This category applies to an AE that is clearly not related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure, beyond a reasonable doubt. 
• Unlikely Related:  This category applied to an AE that is doubtfully related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure. 
Categories of attributions for “Related” events: 
• Possibly Related:  This category applies to an AE that may be related  to the 
investigational a gent/procedure. 
• Probably Related:  This category applies to an AE that is likely related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure.  
• Definitely Related:  This category applies to an AE that is clearly related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure. 
For the purposes of reporting to regulatory agencies, AEs  deemed as Definitely, Probably or 
Possibly Related will be considered Related and those deemed Unrelated  or Unlikely Related  
will be considered Unrelated.  
8.5.[ADDRESS_599567]'s treatment assignment or dosage. All initial SAE reports  
must be followed by [CONTACT_3896]. These should include copi[INVESTIGATOR_11821]. SAEs will be reported by [CONTACT_467877].  
Follow-up SAE information m ust be submitted in a timely manner as additional information 
becomes available. All SAEs regardless of relationship to study drug must be followed to 
resolution or stabilization if improvement is not expected.

8.5.5 Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting  
Ultragenyx or its designee will submit suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions 
(S[LOCATION_003]R) to appropriate Regulatory Authorities (including Competent Authorities in all Member States concerned), ECs, and Investigators as per local laws and regulations. Fatal and life-threatening S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be submitted no later than 7- calendar days of first 
knowledge of the event and follow-up information submitted within an additional eight (8) days. All other S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be submitted within [ADDRESS_599569] knowled ge of the 
event.  
Principal Investigators are required to report any urgent safety matters to Ultragenyx or 
designee within 24 hours. Ultragenyx or its designee will inform Regulatory Authorities, ECs, and Investigators of any events (e.g. change to the safety profile of UX003, major safety findings) that may occur during the clinical trial that do not fall within the definition of a S[LOCATION_003]R but may affect the safety of subjects participating in the clinical trials, as required, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The reporting period for urgent safety 
issues is the period from signing the ICF through [ADDRESS_599570] dose of study drug.  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_11822]/ECs of SAEs and urgent safety matters, in 
accordance with IRB/EC requirements and local laws and regulations. A copy of this notification must be provided to Ultragenyx or its designee.  
Non-S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be maintained in the Ultragenyx safety database and provided in annual 
and/or periodic reports as per local laws and regulations. Ultragenyx or its designee will 
prepare and submit annual safety reports and/or other aggregate periodic summary reports to Regulatory authorities and ECs, as per local laws and regulations.  
8.5.[ADDRESS_599571] the safety of subjects, and that the appropriate regulatory bodies should be notified according to their respective regulations. According to the European Union (EU) Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC, “…in the light of the circumstances, notably the occurrence of any new event relating to the conduct of the trial or the development of the 
investigational medicinal product where that new event is likely to affect the safety of the subjects, the Sponsor and the I nvestigator shall take appropriate urgent safety measures to 
protect the subjects  against any immediate hazar d. The Sponsor shall forthwith inform the 
competent authorities of those new events and the measures taken and shall ensure that the Ethics Committee  (EC) is notified at the same time.” The reporting period for urgent safety 
measures is the period from the signing of the ICF through [ADDRESS_599572]

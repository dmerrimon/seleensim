PLANNED  INTERIM  
ANALYSES   When approximately 50% of patients have been enrolled in the study, 
an interim analysis for safety will be conducted by [CONTACT_528037]. Serious adverse events will be 
monitored by [CONTACT_528038]. 
  
STATISTICS  
Primary Analysis Plan  For continuous variables including the primary endpoint  (volume of 
blood products transfused during the first 24 hours of admission) , the 
statistical method will depend on the distribution of the data.  If the 
data appears to follow a normal distribution, a t -test will be used, 
otherwise, a nonparametric Wilco xian rank sum test will be used.   
To analyze coagulopathy over time a mixed effects linear regression 
model will be used .  
A mixed effects linear regression model will also be used to adjust for 
confounding variables  such as sex, age, comorbidities, seve rity of 
injury, and physiologic parameters of shock including pH and 
temperature , and use of a rapid transfuser (which more effectively 
warms blood).   
Rationale for Number 
of Patients  A sample size of 49 whole blood  group (study drug) and 49 
component therapy group (control) patients (98 patients total) is 
estimated.  [ADDRESS_685519] 80% power to detect a significant difference 
in volume of transfusion in  24 hours. 1

Protocol Template Effective: [ADDRESS_685520] civilian trauma cente rs.  9 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_528008], it is 
apparent that transfusion of blood components is not equivalent to whole blood 
transfusion . 10-12  Transfusion of high plasma volumes may be associated with increased 
risk of allergic reaction, transfusion associated acute lung injury (TRALI), hypervolemic  
cardiac failure/transfusion -associated circulatory overload (TACO), and ARDS . [ADDRESS_685521] recently reintroduced fresh whole blood (FWB) for 
standard resuscitation of massive hemorrhage have found that FWB offers a survival 
advantage over component therapy, and that risk s of transfusion reactions are similar for 
FWB and component therapy with PRBCs . [ADDRESS_685522] in whole blood for t rauma resuscitation. The use of 
low-titer (anti-A/anti-B) group O -positive whole blood that is leukoreduced with a 
platelet-sparing filter was recently approved by [CONTACT_528039]  (Transfusion Committee)  for male trauma patients.  
 To provide effective treatment for traumatic hemorrhage, blood product 
transfusion must provide the oxygen -carrying capacity provided by [CONTACT_528040].  Whole blood offers the 
advantages of more precisely approximating shed blood; decreased volume of additives 
per transfusion epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]; and exposure to a decreased number of donors for a patient 
undergoing massive transfusion. As described below, the military experience, initial 
civilian studies, and preclinical studies indicate that whole blood may be superior to 
component therapy particularly with regard to hemostatic capacity, though i t remains to 
be seen whether this will translate into differences in coagulopathy, inflammation,  
transfusion requirements, and mortality.  Additional considerations include optimal 
storage conditions that maintain the function of red cells, platelets, and clotting factors; as 
well as careful consideration and mitigation of the risk of transfusion rea ction when the 
group O plasma in whole blood units is administered to non -group O recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Evidence 
of the safety of this product is provided in the following sections.

Protocol Template Effective: [ADDRESS_685523] 10 days  at 2-6°C, and likely longer.  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_528009] [ADDRESS_685524] specifically addressed platelet function 
in WB stored for 21 days or longer with similar findings.  Jobes et al demonstrated that in 
unfiltered WB stored at 1 -6°C, platelet counts decrease starting at day [ADDRESS_685525] a decline in 
response to collagen by [CONTACT_4475] 7 and ristocetin by [CONTACT_4475] 17. However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a gradual 
decline in plate let count and response to some agonists, global platelet function in the 
stored unit as measured by [CONTACT_184435] (TEG) was maintained within the 
normal range until day 14 of storage 16.  
 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_528010]. found similar results showing that refrigerated (1 -6°C) WB 
improved impedance platelet aggregation and TEG results compared to WB units stored 
at 22°C for 21 days.  In this study, prolongation of  prothrombin time  was also attenuated 
by [CONTACT_386267].  17 Functional clott ing capacity as measured by [CONTACT_528041] 21 days.  In studies performed at 
UCLA, we found similar results with TEG values maintained within the normal range for 
up to 35 days of storage at 1 -6°C in unfiltered WB (manuscript accepted, Journal of 
Trauma and Acute Care Surgery ).   
 Standard leukoreduction techniques for blood processing remove platelets as well 
as white blood cells. Our study proposes to use a platelet -sparing leukoreduction filter 
which has previously been evaluated for leukoreduction of whole blood (Imuflex WB -SP, 
Terumo). 18.  The filter works with a polyurethane membrane that permits passage of 
RBCs and pl atelets but impedes white blood cells.  Theoretically passage through the 
filter could activate RBCs and platelets and target them for destruction, but this was not 
the case based on in vivo recovery of radiolabeled red cells and platelets after autologous  
transfusion. PRBCs, platelets, and plasma produced by [CONTACT_528042], including leukoreduction standards. 18  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_528003] # 2 04/17/2017  Page 14 of 46 
Protocol Template Effective: 10 May 2016  Additionally, Strandenes et al. recently demonstrated that global platelet function as 
measured by [CONTACT_528043] 2 -6°C for up to [ADDRESS_685526] also been 
investigated.  Using the platelet -sparing filter, Yazer et al studied whether whole blood 
should be agitated to enhance platelet function, or whether this would damage the red 
cells. 20  In this study, whole blood was maintained between 20 -24°C  before 
leukoreduction occurred within 8 hours; blood was then immediately placed in a 1 -6°C 
refrigerator. Units then underwent infectious disease testing over 3 days, and were then 
delivered to the transfusion service.  This timeline and storage plan is the same as that 
used in the proposed study.  After processing, units were stored for 21 days under 
different rocking conditions.  Based on thromboelastography and markers of hemolysis, 
the recommended storage condition for cold stored whole blood is stationary for up to 10 
days. Importantly, platelet function did not appear to be affected by [CONTACT_528044].  
 Platelets were  routinely stored at 4 °C until the 1980s, and appeared to be safe 
during this time . These storage conditions were phased out because of the decreased 
circulation time of cold-stored platelets compared to platelets st ored at room temperature, 
in order to best serve patients requiring prophylactic transfusions. [ADDRESS_685527] evidence that whole blood may be superior to component therapy for 
trauma patients comes from military studies in Iraq and Afghanistan using fresh whole 
blood (FWB).  FWB was initially used as a source of platelets, in addition to PRBCs and 
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_528003] # 2 04/17/2017  Page 15 of 46 
Protocol Template Effective: [ADDRESS_685528] component therapy to component therapy 
with whole blood substituted for platelets found tha t when adjusted for confounding 
variables, patients who received FWB had a significant survival advantage. 23 Of note, a 
subgroup analysis of patients who received “universal -donor” group O FWB (49%) 
versus type-specific product found there was no difference in mortality between these 
groups, and that there were no transfusion reactions.  
 Similarly, a retrospective analysis of [ADDRESS_685529] component therapy. 24 hour and 30 day 
survival was significantly higher in the whole blood group.  
 On the civilian side, a recent randomized controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_528011] a non -platelet-sparing filter and stored for up to 5 days at 1 -6°C, 
supplemen ted with warm stored platelets, to regular component therapy in severely 
injured patients predicted to require large volume transfusion.  [ADDRESS_685530] be type -specific.  
However, as reviewed by [CONTACT_84899][INVESTIGATOR_528009] (7) and Be rseus et al 25, there is convincing 
evidence that the risk of a hemolytic transfusion reaction from transfusion of low titer 
group O WB is minimal. As these authors point o ut, the US Army used low titer group O 
WB as a universal donor blood in the Vietnam conflict. Per their report, there was only 
one reported hemolytic transfusion reaction from transfusion of group O WB where a 
group A patient incorrectly re ceived a unit th at was labeled high titer. There were no 
reported hemolytic transfusion reactions following transfusion of low titer group O WB 
to non-group O patients. Berseus et al have reviewed the known literature on hemolytic 
transfusion reactions after transfusion of group O products to non -group O recipi[INVESTIGATOR_528012] O products.  25 
The authors concluded that “there is an overwhelming experience, particularly from the 
transfusion of low titer universal group O whole blood in the military service, showing 
that the frequenc y of severe hemolytic transfusion reactions is nearly negligible”. [ADDRESS_685531] shown that it is safe to initiate resuscitation from hemorrhagic 
shock in m ale patients with low titer group O+ WB in a civilian trauma center.  In this 
study, patients were transfused up to 2 units uncrossmatched group O positive WB 
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_528003] # 2 04/17/2017  Page 16 of 46 
Protocol Template Effective: 10 May 2016  leukoreduced using a platelet -sparing filter and stored at 1 -6°C for up to 10 days for male 
trauma patients with hypotension due to hemorrhage.   Outcomes were compared to 
historical controls.  No adverse reactions and no laboratory evidence of increased 
hemolysis in the whole blood group was found.26 That institution has now increased their 
initial transfusion of low titer group O+ WB to 4 units with similar results (personal 
communication).  Our study seeks to build on this work by [CONTACT_528045] a platelet sparing filter. Only low anti -A, anti-B 
group O-positive whole blood will be used as a universal donor in the proposed study. 
Platelets, which are not typi[INVESTIGATOR_528013], have oc casionally resulted in hemolytic 
reactions after transfusion.  In the 25 publications reviewed, all but one reaction resulted 
from a unit with a titer of >1:100 (saline) or >1:400 (antiglobulin); often, titers were 
>1:1000. Our study proposes to use a cuto ff of <1:100.  
 There have been reports of hemolytic reactions when a patient initially transfused 
with unmatched group O whole blood later received type -specific transfusion .   A similar 
situation is encountered in current massive transfusion protocols and  hemolytic reactions 
are prevented using the following precautions. Currently when the patient’s blood type is 
unknown during a massive transfusion activation  at UCLA, sets of 6 group O PRBC 
units, 6 pre -thawed group A plasma units and 1 apheresis platelet  unit are provided.  
Once the blood type o f the patient is determined, the  blood bank switches to providing 
type-specific products unless the patient’s blood type is group B or AB (i.e. incompatible 
with the group A plasma); under this c ircumstance, the bl ood bank provides another set 
of [ADDRESS_685532] not identified any hemolytic transfusion reactions using this approach.  
We intend to follow this same practice with the transfusio n of low titer group O+ WB. If 
after receiving low titer group O+ WB the patient’s blood type is found to be a type other 
than group O, the blood bank will provide a set of group O PRBC units and compatible 
plasma units, before switching to type specific PRBC units.  
 Providing further evidence of the safety of this approach, our institution 
participated in a multi -center study evaluating the safety of the use of thawed group A 
plasma in trauma patients. 27 This study evaluated trauma patients that received group A 
plasma as part of the initial resuscitation (354 B and AB patients and 809 A patients). 
The two study groups were comparable in terms of age, gender, TRISS probability of 
survival, and total number of blood products transfused. The study found that the u se of 
group A thawed plasma during the initial resuscitation of injured patients of unknown 
ABO group was not associated with increased in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380],  early mortality or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_528014] B and AB patients compared to group A patien ts. 
Additionally, of the 17 participating centers, only 4 (24%) provide low -titer group A 
plasma; the other 13 centers do not perform titers of the plasma components. This 
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_528003] # 2 04/17/2017  Page 17 of 46 
Protocol Template Effective: 10 May 2016  experience indicates that transfusion of group A thawed plasma, regardless of anti -B titer, 
is safe. A manuscript reporting these findings was recently accepted by [CONTACT_528046] 
(accepted March 15, 2017 ).   
  
 
[ADDRESS_685533] in adult mal e civilian trauma patients 28; however, efficacy must 
be determined in a prospective civilian context.   
The advantage of cold -stored whole blood may be due to several factors, or a 
combination of factors, including superior platelet function, l ack of storage lesion, and 
decreased volume of preservative and anticoagulant additives.  These factors will be 
evaluated in our study.   
2.1 Risk / Benefit Assessment  
As described above  (See sections 1.1 and 1.2, Overview of Non -Clinical and Clinical 
Studies), low titer group O cold -stored whole blood stored for up to [ADDRESS_685534] 
compared to component therapy, and that it may reduce transfusion requirements, 
development of coagulopathy, and ultimately mortality. The risk-benefit profile of whole 
blood transfusion is therefore quite favorable.  The evidence for this analysis is described 
extensively in sections 1.1 and 1.2, Overview of Non -Clinical and Clinical Studies.

4 STUDY  DESIGN  
4.1 Study Overview  
This is a single center, prospective cohort study.  Enrollment of approximately 98 
patients is planned, 49 receiving whole blood and 49 receiving component therapy. This 
is an observational study planned during initiation of a change in practice at our 
institution  initially allowing up to 4  units of whole blood transfusion for adult male 
trauma patients.  If initial patients receiving whole blood show no evidence of h emolysis 
and thrombocytopenia compared to patients receiving component therapy, up to 6 units 
of whole blood transfusion will be allowed  (see below, and  section 5.2, Safety 
Evaluations) .  Patients in the whole blood , or index, group  are adult male trauma p atients 
presenting in hemorrhagic shock (systolic blood pressure < 100) requiring massive 
transfusion activation who receive whole blood for resuscitation.  Two control groups 
will be utilized.  The p rospective c ontrol group consists of adult male patients  who 
present during times when whole blood is not available, as well as adult female patients, 
presenting in hemorrhagic shock (systolic blood pressure <100) requiring massive 
transfusion  activation . Additionally, a second control group consisting of histo rical 
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_528003] # 2 04/17/2017  Page 19 of 46 
Protocol Template Effective: 10 May 2016  controls receiving component therapy will be analyzed  (see Section 6, Patient Selection, 
for details of index and control groups) . 
 All patients will have,  in addition to standard labs, additional labs drawn for 
thromboelastography, platelet function  determination, and coagulation factor levels  (see 
Section 9.1.6, Other Clinical Procedures, for details of specific lab tests and timing) .  
 Patients who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be 
enrolled into the study.  
 Total duration of patient participation will be approximately 1 year (365 days), or 
the duration of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], whichever is shorter.  This includes up to 5 days of 
laboratory testing during initial resuscitation and subsequent admission, and up to one  
year of follow up via chart review if the patient remains in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Total duration of 
the study including recruitment and follow up is expected to be 2 years.  
5 CRITERIA  FOR EVALUATION  
5.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary objective is to assess the  clinical efficacy of whole blood compared to 
component therapy for trauma patients requiring massive transfusion . Primary analysis 
will compare volume of blood transfusion within 24 hours of admission for patients 
without severe TBI ( defined as GCS ≤8 and imaging evidence of brain injury ) for 
patients who received WB versus component therapy for initial resuscitation . 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The secondary objective s will evaluate the effect on survival ; the development of 
multiple complications related to survival ; and wastage data . The full list of secondary 
endpoints is as follows:  
1. Volume of blood transfusion within 24 hours of admission for patients with 
severe TBI (GCS ≤8 and imaging evidence of brain injury ) and for ent ire cohort 
of patients . 
2. Thromboelastography parameters including maximum amplitude, reaction time, 
alpha angle, fibrinolysis, and platelet function at 3 and 6 hours of resuscitation, 
after every 6 units of whole blood equivalent (WB or PRBCs) given, at the time 
of completion of  resuscitation (time of last unit of blood product given),  and on 
ICU days 1, 3 and 5.  
3. 30-day mortality;  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_528003] # 2 04/17/2017  Page 20 of 46 
Protocol Template Effective: 10 May 2016  4. Duration of need for renal replacement therapy, mechanical ventilation, ICU 
admission, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408];  
5. Number of units of blood products transfus ed by [CONTACT_301899]/product during first 
24 hours of admission and total  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];  
6. Complications which include clinical coagulopathy, infection, venous 
thromboembolism, cerebrovascular accident, acute coronary syndrome, 
transfusion -related lung injury,  transfusion-associated cardiac overload during 
total hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];  
7. Hemolysis as measured by [CONTACT_528036], bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase , and 
direct antiglobulin  on ICU day 1;  
8. Wastage of blood units  
5.2 Safety Evaluations  
 Hemolysis will be measured by [CONTACT_528047], bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase , and 
direct antiglobulin  tests on ICU day 1.  Clinical surveillance for evidence of 
hemolysis will also be ongoing.   The Blood and Blood Derivatives committee will 
review data for the first [ADDRESS_685536] received whole blood under this 
protocol, the Committee will again evaluate for hemolysis and thrombocytopenia and 
increase to a maxim um of 6 units of whole blood if risks are found to be equivalent to 
component therapy.  
 
 Alternatively, should the safety of up to [ADDRESS_685537] 10 patients 
to receive whole blood under this protocol and if the risks of hemolysis and 
thrombocytopenia are judged by [CONTACT_528048], the Committee will 
allow up to 6 units of whole blood to be transfused.  
 
 The Blood and Blood Derivatives Committee at UCLA, also known as the 
Transfusion  Committee, is composed of  Transfusion Medicine faculty members.  The 
Committee performs routine monthly monitoring of all transfusion -related safety 
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_528003] # 2 04/17/2017  Page 21 of 46 
Protocol Template Effective: 10 May 2016  data, including evidence of hemolysis and other transfusion reactions. In addition, the 
Committee has agreed to perform a separate e valuation of the cohort of patients 
receiving whole blood and compare this to equivalent patients receiving component 
therapy (as defined in the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study), for the 
purposes of evaluating the safety of whole blood.  Dr s. Ziman and Ward, who are co -
investigators in this study, are  members of the Blood and Blood Derivatives 
Committee but will be recused from safety analysis related to this study to prevent 
conflict of interest.  No other member of the Committee has  a relationship to the 
study.  
 
 The incidence of adverse events will be evaluated including: death, clinical 
coagulopathy, hemolysis, infection, venous thromboembolism, cerebrovascular 
accident, acute coronary syndrome, transfusion -related lung injury, transfusion -
associated cardiac overload.  
 The occurrence of any whole blood transfusion given to patients other than adult male 
trauma patients will also be recorded  
 In addition to ongoing monitoring and final analysis, a n interim safety analysis when 
approximately 50 % of patients have been enrolled will determine if there is a 
difference in adverse events  as defined above  between groups.  
 The interim analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_392636].  The 
independent medical monitor, [CONTACT_528065], is a n emergency medicine 
physician with extensive experience in clinical investigation and has no relation to the 
study other than to monitor safety. The independent medical monitor has the authority 
to stop the study if sa fety concerns arise, including but not limited to evidence for the 
pre-specified stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418]  (see Section 12.5, Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_2121]) . [CONTACT_528066] is 
also independent of the Blood and Blood Derivatives Committee.   
 
6 PATIENT  SELECTION  
6.1 Study Population  
All trauma patients who present with SBP <[ADDRESS_685538] severe burns (>20% total body surface area) 
will be eligible for enrollment.  
Enrollment of male and female patients:  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_528003] # 2 04/17/2017  Page 22 of 46 
Protocol Template Effective: [ADDRESS_685539] of care for traumatic 
resuscitation for adult males is either:  
1) Low anti -A anti-B titer (<1:100) group O+ whole blood   
or, when whole blood is not available,  
2) Component therapy, consisting of group O+ PRBCs, group AB or A plasma, and 
untyped platelets  
The standard of care for adult females is component therapy, consisting of group O -
PRBCs, group AB  or A plasma, and untyped platelets. Group O - whole blood is not 
available at our institution at this time. During a critical traumatic resu scitation, it is often 
impossible to determine precise age and menopausal status before initiation of 
transfusion.  In order to avoid any possibility of alloimmunization of reproductive -age 
females, the UCLA Blood and Blood Derivatives Committee has approv ed group O+ 
whole blood only for use in males.   
The index and control groups in the study therefore consist of:  
1) Index group : male trauma patients present ing with SBP<[ADDRESS_685540] sev ere burns >20% TBSA  who 
receive whole blood;  
2) Prospective control group : Prospectively -identified cohort of patients who present 
during the study with SBP<[ADDRESS_685541] severe burns  >20% TBSA  but who are either not eligible or 
not able to receive whole blood.  This category consists of patients who are female (who 
are not eligible to receive whole blood) and male patients who present wh en whole blood 
is out of stock;   
3) Historical c ontrol group : male trauma patients  who presented with SBP<[ADDRESS_685542] severe burns  
>20% TBSA  who received component therapy for traumatic hemorrhage requiring 
massive transfusion prot ocol activation, during the [ADDRESS_685543] for confounding variables, 
including sex.  
Enrollment of patients of unknown precise age:  
Due to the emergent nature of a  critical code trauma activation, it is often not possible to 
determine exact age of patients prior to initiating treatment, including transfusion, for 
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_528003] # 2 04/17/2017  Page 23 of 46 
Protocol Template Effective: [ADDRESS_685544] 18 years old, while respecting the necessities of clinical care.  However, we 
acknowledge it is possible that there may be an instance where a patient is included who 
is not over age 18.   
 
6.2  Inclusion Criteria  
All trauma patients who present with SBP<[ADDRESS_685545] severe burns (>20% total body surface area) 
will be eligible for enrollment.  The study pl ans to include all such patients who present 
during the study period of approximately 2 years.  
Within this group of patients, all adult male patients who received or will receive whole 
blood are eligible for inclusion in the whole blood group.  All adult m ale patients who 
received or will receive component therapy initially are eligible for inclusion in the 
component therapy group.  All adult female patients are eligible for inclusion in the 
component therapy group.   
6.3 Exclusion Criteria  
1. Patients with burns over >20% total body surface area  
2. Patients who appear to be under age 18  
7 CONCURRENT  MEDICATIONS  
All patients should be maintained on the same medications throughout the entire study 
period, as medically feasible, with no introduction of new chronic therapi [INVESTIGATOR_528015]. 
7.1 Allowed Medications and Treatments  
There are no prohibited medications or treatments.  
8 STUDY  TREATMENTS  
8.1 Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups  
Treatment groups are not assigned  as this is an observational study.  Treatment is 
determined by [CONTACT_528049] (male or female) and the availability of whole 
blood when the patient presents. Adult male patients meeting eligibility who have

Protocol Template Effective: 10 May 2016  received or will receive whole b lood for traumatic resuscitation will be enrolled in the 
whole blood group. Enrollment of 49 patients receiving whole blood is planned.  Adult 
male patients meeting eligibility criteria who present when whole blood is not available 
will receive component t herapy and will be enrolled in the component therapy group. 
Enrollment of 49 control (component therapy group) patients is planned. Female patients 
meeting eligibility criteria will also be included in the component therapy group (see 
Section 6.1, Study Population, for rationale).  
8.[ADDRESS_685546]:   Low-antibody (anti -A/anti-B) titer ( <1:100) Group O+ banked whole 
blood stored at 1 -6 °C for up to [ADDRESS_685547]: Component therapy  manufactured according to standard practices,  
consisting of packed red b lood cells, thawed fresh frozen plasma and platelets in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_685548]. It is labeled with a large -print, brightly -colored label identifying it 
as whole blood.  
8.4 Supply of Study Drug at the Site  
The UCLA Blood & Platelet Center will identify repeat volunteer male whole blood 
donors to maintain a predetermined inventory of 12 units of low -titer (<1:100) O -positive 
whole blood .  These donors will be identified by [CONTACT_528050] a 
prior donation.  The study will be explained to potential donors as a recruitment tool.   
All donors of whole blood  units will be tested for transfusion -transmitted infectious 
diseases, identical to the AABB and FDA regulations for all blood donors.  Donor 
infectious disease testing is performed at CTS (Creative Testing Solutions) in Tempe, 
Arizona; the average tum -around time for completion of testing and blood availabili ty in 
inventory is 48 hours. Whole blood  units will undergo pre -storage leukoreduction with a 
platelet-sparing filter (Imuflex WB -SA, Terumo, To kyo, Japan) and then stored at 1 -6°C 
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_528003] # 2 04/17/2017  Page 25 of 46 
Protocol Template Effective: 10 May 2016  for 10 days. If not used by [CONTACT_4475] 10, units will be fractionated into P RBC units  to be 
released into general inventory for transfusion, and plasma which will be discarded.  
The goal is to maintain up to 12 units of low-titer type O -positive whole blood  weekly.  6 
units will be stored in the Trauma Bay blood refrigerator, and 6 units will be  stored in the 
blood bank.  
8.4.1 Dosage/Dosage Regimen  
Adult male patients may receive up to  4 units of whole blood if needed during initial 
traumatic resuscitation  in the initial phase of the study, and up to 6 units if deemed to be 
safe (see section 5.2, Safe ty Evaluations) .  
8.4.2 Dispensing  
The blood bank dispenses all blood products.  
8.4.3 Administration Instructions  
Blood products are transfused intravenously.  
8.4.4 Storage 
Whole blood will be stored by [CONTACT_48678] a refrigerator designated for the storage of 
blood products maintained at 1 -6ºC. If the temperature of study drug storage in the 
clinic/pharmacy exceeds or falls below or above this range, this will be reported to the 
Sponsor/Investigator or designee and captured as a deviation.

11 ADVERSE  EXPERIENCE  REPORTING  AND DOCUMENTATION  
11.1 Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation of a 
patient administered a pharmaceutical product and  that does not necessarily have a causal 
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_528003] # 2 04/17/2017  Page 32 of 46 
Protocol Template Effective: 10 May 2016  relationship with the treatment.  An AE is therefore any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated 
with the administration of an investigati onal product, whether or not related to that 
investigational product.   
The Investigator and Independent Medical Monitor will probe, via discussion with the 
patient’s clinical providers, for the occurrence of AEs during the patient visit and record 
the information in the site’s source documents.  Adverse events will be recorded in the 
patient CRF.  Adverse events will be described by [CONTACT_24109] (start and stop dates and 
times), severity, outcome, treatment and relation to study drug, or if unrelated, the caus e.  
AE Severity  
The National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) Version 3.0 will be used to assess and grade AE severity, including laboratory 
abnormalities judged to be clinically significant. The guidelines shown in  Table 1 below 
will be used to grade severity.  It should be pointed out that the term “severe” is a 
measure of intensity and that a severe AE is not necessarily serious.  
Table 1.  AE Severity Grading  
Severity (Toxicity Grade)  Description  
Mild (1) Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention or therapy required. The patient may be aware of the sign 
or symptom but tolerates it reasonably well.  
Moderate (2)  Mild to moderate limitation in activity, no or minimal med ical 
intervention/therapy required.  
Severe (3)  Marked limitation in activity, medical intervention/therapy required, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29125].  
Life-threatening (4)  The patient is at risk of death due to the adverse experience as it 
occurred. This does n ot refer to an experience that hypothetically 
might have caused death if it were more severe.  
 
AE Relationship to Study Drug  
The relationship of an AE to the study drug should be assessed using the following the 
guidelines in Table 2.  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_528003] # 2 04/17/2017  Page 33 of 46 
Protocol Template Effective: 10 May 2016  Table 2.  AE Relationship to Study Drug  
Relationship  
to Drug Comment  
Definitely Previously known toxicity of agent; or an event that follows a reasonable temporal 
sequence from administration of the drug; that follows a known or expected response 
pattern to the suspec ted drug; that is confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_528026]; and that is not explained by [CONTACT_41846].  
Probably An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected drug; that is 
confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_11125]; and that is unlikely to be 
explained by [CONTACT_11564]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_41847].  
Possibly An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to that suspected drug; but 
that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors.  
Unrelated An event that ca n be determined with certainty to have no relationship to the study 
drug. 
11.2 Serious Adverse Experiences (SAE)  
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
● death 
● a life-threatening adverse experience  
● inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
● a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
● a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Other important medical events may also be considered an SAE when, based on 
appropriate medical judgment, they jeopardize the patient or require intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed.

Protocol Template Effective: 10 May 2016  11.2.1 Serious Adverse Experience Reporting  
Study site will docu ment all SAEs that occur (whether or not related to study drug) per 
UCLA OHRPP Guidelines .  The collection period for all SAEs will begin after admission 
and end after discharge.  
In accordance with the standard operating procedures and policies of the Institutional 
Review Board, the site investigator will report SAEs to the IRB.   
11.3 Protocol Defined Important Medical Findings Requiring Real Time 
Reporting  
The following additional event is to be reported in real time to the IRB and FDA:  
Hemolytic transfusion reactions:  Defined as a clinical syndrome within 24 hours of  
blood transfusion including one or more symptoms (back pain, shortness of breath, 
hematuria, ch ills, dizziness, fever, urticaria) with clinical or laboratory evidence of 
hemolysis (hematuria, decreased haptoglobin, increased lactate dehydrogenase or 
bilirubin, or positive direct antigen test).  Requires immediate cessation of ongoing blood 
transfusion and reporting as SAE.  
11.4 Medical Monitoring  
The Sponsor/Investigator, as well as the Independent Medical Monitor, will monitor for 
adverse effects and should be contact[CONTACT_528055] s or questions 
regarding safety:   Medical monitor ([CONTACT_528065]) p hone: (310) 825 -2111 e-mail:

12 DISCONTINUATION  AND REPLACEMENT  OF PATIENTS  
12.1 Early Discontinuation of Study Drug  
A patient may be discontinued from study treatment at any time if the patient, or 
Sponsor/Investigator feels that it is not in the patient’s best interest to continue.  The 
following is a list of possible reasons for study treatment discontinuation:  
 Hemolytic transfusion reaction  
 Adverse event that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_72008]/I nvestigator would be in the best 
interest of the patient to discontinue study treatment  
 Protocol violation requiring discontinuation of study treatment  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_528003] # 2 04/17/2017  Page 35 of 46 
Protocol Template Effective: 10 May 2016  If a patient is withdrawn from treatment due to an adverse event, the patient will be  
followed and treated by [CONTACT_1034]/Investigator until the abnormal parameter or 
symptom has resolved or stabilized.   
12.3 Withdrawal of Patients from the Study  
A patient may be withdrawn from the study at any time if the patient or the 
Sponsor/Investigator feels that it is not in the pati ent’s best interest to continue.    
All patients are free to withdraw from participation at any time, for any reason, specified 
or unspecified, and without prejudice.  
Reasonable attempts will be made by [CONTACT_1034]/Investigator to provide a reason for 
patient withdrawals.   The reason for the patient’s withdrawal from the study will be 
specified in the patient’s source documents.     
12.4 Replacement of Patients  
 
Patients who withdraw from the study will be replaced.   
12.5 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_528027]-specified stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_528028]:  
1. Hemolytic transfusion reaction: Defined as a clinical syndrome within 24 hours of  
blood transfusion including one or more symptoms (back pain, shortness of breath, 
hematuria, chills, dizziness, fever, urticaria) with clinical or labo ratory evidence of 
hemolysis (hematuria, decreased haptoglobin, increased lactate dehydrogenase or 
bilirubin, or positive direct antigen test).  Requires immediate cessation of ongoing blood 
transfusion and reporting as SAE.  As this is an unexpected and s erious event, any 
hemolytic transfusion reaction following the administration of whole blood will prompt 
temporary cessation of the study while the event is evaluated.  If the event indeed 
occurred after administration of low titer group O -positive whole b lood, the study will be 
stopped.  
 
2. Additionally, interim analysis will seek evidence for increased inciden ce of clinical 
coagulopathy,  increased transfusion requirements, and increased incidence of 
complications as defined above in Secondary Endpoints, or increased mortality, all  of 
which will prompt stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_58615].

A protocol violation occurs when the patient or Sponsor/Investigator fails to adhere to 
significant protocol requirements affecting the inclusion, exclusion, patient safety and  
primary endpoint criteria.  Protocol violations for this study include, but are not limited 
to, the following:  
● Failure to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria  
● Switching from component therapy to whole blood  
Failure to comply with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines will also result in a 
protocol violation. The Sponsor/Investigator will determine if a protocol violation will  
result in withdrawal of a patient.  
When a protocol violation occurs, it will be di scussed with the Sponsor/Investigator and a 
Protocol Violation Form detailing the violation will be generated. This form will be 
signed by a Sponsor/Investigator or representative. A copy of the form will be filed in the 
site’s regulatory binder and in the  Sponsor/Investigator’s files.  
[ADDRESS_685558] William Mower.  The Sponsor/Investigator and Independent Medical Monitor will 
review clinical data and probe for evide nce of adverse events  via discussion with the 
patient’s clinical providers  as described above. An interim analysis for safety is planned 
when approximately 50% of patients have been enrolled.  The monitor will also ensure 
that records are maintained appropriately throughout the study.  
15 STATISTICAL  METHODS  AND CONSIDERATIONS  
Prior to the analysis of the final study data, a detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will 
be written describing all analyses that will be performed.  The SAP will contain any 
modifications to the analysis plan described in this protocol .   
15.[ADDRESS_685559] one unit of blood, 
and who und ergo TEG testing as described above , will be included in analysis.   
 
Data sets include:

Protocol Template Effective: [ADDRESS_685560] severe TBI  
2. Prospectively identified patients who received whole blood or component therapy and 
who had severe TBI ( GCS 8 or less  with evidence of brain injury on imaging ) 
3. Prospectively identified patients who received whole blood or component t herapy, all 
patients regardless of TBI status  
4. Prospectively identified male patients who received whole blood and who did not have 
severe TB I, compared to historical control male patients who received component 
therapy and who did not have severe TBI  
 
 
15.2 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
The following demographic variables will be summarized: age, sex, race, height and 
weight, comorbidities, and home medications.  
15.[ADDRESS_685561] 24 hours of 
admission in patients with out severe TBI (severe TBI is defined as GCS ≤8 and evidence 
of brain injury on imaging)  receiving whole blood versus component therapy  during 
initial resuscitation . 
For continuous variables including the primary endpoint, the statistical method will 
depend on the distribution of the data.  If the data appears to follow a normal di stribution, 
a t-test will be used, otherwise, a nonparametric Wilcoxian rank sum test will be used.   
15.4 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
Continuous variables and categorical variables will be analyzed as described above  
(section 15.3) . Mixed effects linear re gression models will be used to evaluate 
coagulopathy over time and to adjust for confounding variables.  
To analyze coagulopathy over time we will use a mixed effects linear regression model.  
A mixed effects linear regression model will also be used to a djust for confounding 
variables such as sex, age, comorbidities, severity of injury, and physiologic parameters 
of shock including pH and temperature, and use of a rapid transfuser (which more 
effectively warms blood).   
Quarterly safety monitoring will co mpare categorical variables including mortality and 
development of complications (duration  of need for renal replacement therapy,

infection, venous thromboembolism, cerebrovas cular accident, acute coronary syndrome, 
transfusion -related lung injury, transfusion -associated cardiac overload;  transfusion 
reactions including clinical transfusion reactions and rates of hemolysis as measured by  
[CONTACT_528036], bilirubin, lactate dehydro genase, and direct antiglobulin). Categorical 
variables will be compared using the chi -squared test.  
15.5 Interim Analysis  
When approximately 50% of patients have been enrolled in the study, an interim analysis 
for safety is planned to be conducted by [CONTACT_528056]. (See Section 
5.2, Safety Evaluations).  
 
Sample Size  
Number of patients to be enrolled was calcula ted using a Type I error rate of  0.05, and 
effect size based on reduction of PRBC and plasma transfusions described in the 
sensitivity analysis in a study by [CONTACT_528057]. 1  
 
As in the sensitivity analysis by [CONTACT_528057], patients with severe TBI (defined as TBI  on 
imaging with GCS of 8 or less) will be excluded from primary analysis.  Approximately 
35-40% of patients meeting inclusion criteria are expected to fulfill crite ria for severe 
TBI. It is not possible to identify patients with severe TBI prior to beginning resuscitation 
for hemorrhagic shock, so all patients meeting inclusion criteria will be enrolled. In the 
primary analysis, only patients without severe TBI will be compared.  Secondary 
analyses will compare 1) patients with severe TBI receiving WB versus component 
therapy and 2) the entire cohort of enrolled patients, with and without TBI, receiving WB 
versus component therapy.  Using this method, a total sample s ize of 49 whole blood  arm 
(study drug) and 49  component therapy arm (control) patients (98 patients total) is 
planned.  35-40% (approximately 18 of the total 49) of eligible patients are expected to 
have severe TBI and to be excluded from primary analysis based on typi[INVESTIGATOR_528029]. 49 total patients per group  will achieve a sample size of 
approximately 31 patients per arm without TBI to complete the primary analysis. The 
FDA will be notified in advance if sample size estimates change .

Protocol Template Effective: 10 May 2016  16 DATA COLLECTION,  RETENTION  AND MONITORING  
16.1 Data Collection Instruments  
The Sponsor/Investigator will prepare and maintain adequate and accurate source 
documents designed to record all observations and other pertinent data for each patient 
treated with the study drug.   
Study personnel will enter data from source documents cor responding to a patient’s visit 
into the protocol -specific electronic database containing the electronic Case Report Form 
(eCRF) when the information corresponding to that visit is available.  Patients will not be 
identified by [CONTACT_528058] o r on any study documents to be collected by [CONTACT_429]/Investigator (or designee), but will be identified by a patient number.  
If a correction is required for an eCRF, the time and date stamps track the person entering 
or updating eCRF data and creates an  electronic audit trail.   
The Sponsor/Investigator is responsible for all information collected on patients enrolled 
in this study.  All data collected during the course of this study must be reviewed and 
verified for completeness and accuracy by [CONTACT_1034]/Investigator.  A copy of the CRF 
will remain at the Sponsor/Investigator’s site at the completion of the study.

At critical junctures of the protocol (e.g., production of interim reports and final reports), 
data for analysis is locked and cleaned per established procedures.  
16.5 Availability and Retention of Investigational Records  
The Sponsor/Investigator must make study data accessible to the IRB, and Regulatory 
Agency (e.g., FDA) inspectors upon request. The Sponsor/Investigator must ensure the 
reliability and availability of source documents from which the information on the CRF 
was derived.  
16.6 Monitoring  
Monitoring will be conducted the Independent Medical Monitor, the Sponsor/Investigator 
and associated staff  according to the U.S. CFR Title 21 Parts 50, 56, and 312 and ICH 
Guidelines for GCP (E6).  
16.7 Patient Confidentiality  
In order to maintain patient confidentiality, only a patient number and date of birth will 
identify all study patients in the electronic database/eCRF  and other documentation.   
17 ADMINISTRATIVE,  ETHICAL,  REGULATORY  CONSIDERATIONS  
The study will be conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki, Protection of 
Human Volunteers  (21 CFR 50), Institutional Review Boards (21 CFR 56), and 
Obligations of Clinical Investigators (21 CFR 312).  
To maintain confidentiality, all study records will be kept in a secured database. Clinical 
information will not be released without written perm ission of the patient, except as 
necessary for monitoring by [CONTACT_1622].  The Sponsor/Investigator must also comply with 
all applicable privacy regulations (e.g., Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
Act of 1996, EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/ EC).  De-identified data will be made 
available to other investigators.  
17.1 Protocol Amendments  
Any amendment to the protocol will be written by [CONTACT_1034]/Investigator.  Protocol  
amendments cannot be implemented without prior written IRB approval except as 
necessary to eliminate immediate safety hazards to patients.  A protocol amendment

operating procedures and policies of the IRB, and the Sponsor/Investigator will keep the 
IRB informed as to the progress of the study.  The Sponsor/Investigator will obtain 
assurance of IRB compliance with regulations.  
Any documents that the IRB may need to fulfill its responsibilities (such as protocol, 
protocol amendments, payment or compensation procedures, or other pertinent 
information) have been submitted to the IRB.  The IRB’s written unconditional approval 
of the study protocol and waiver of the infor med consent form are confirmed to be in the 
possession of the Sponsor/Investigator prior to study initiation.  The IRB unconditional 
approval statement has been transmitted to the Sponsor/Investigator or designee prior to  
the shipment of study supplies to the site.  This approval refers to the study by [CONTACT_528060].  
Protocol and/or informed consent modifications or changes may not be initiated without 
prior written IRB/ approval  except when necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to the 
patients or when the change(s) involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the 
study.  Such modifications will be submitted to the IRB and written verification that the 
modification was  submitted and subsequently approved should be obtained.   
The IRB must be informed of revisions to other documents originally submitted for 
review; serious and/or unexpected adverse experiences occurring during the study in 
accordance with the standard op erating procedures and policies of the IRB; new 
information that may affect adversely the safety of the patients of the conduct of the 
study; an annual update and/or request for re -approval; and when the study has been 
completed.

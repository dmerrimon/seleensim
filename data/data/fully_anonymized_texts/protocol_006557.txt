Vital Signs: 
Vital signs, including supi[INVESTIGATOR_154528], temperature and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_154529]/time points: 
• Screening,  
• Day -1, 7, and 14 upon clinic check-in, 
• Day 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10, 15, 16, and [ADDRESS_178838] AM dosing. 
• Weight and height will be measured at Screening onl y. 
Electrocardiogram 
Twelve-lead ECG recording will be collected at Scre ening and EOS (Day 17). 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) Blood Sampling: 
Blood samples for the determination of plasma tolpe risone concentrations will be drawn prior 
to each AM dosing on Days 1-[ADDRESS_178839]  (15-[ADDRESS_178840]) on Days 
1 and 3.  
Statistical Plan and Methods:  
Doses of tolperisone will be considered non-inferio r (NI) to placebo if the upper 95% 
confidence limit on the difference in SDLP between that dose and placebo is less than 4.4 cm 
(the NI margin). Cyclobenzaprine comparisons to pla cebo are to assess assay sensitivity and 
no adjustment to alpha levels will be made for eith er the comparison of cyclobenzaprine to 
placebo or tolperisone, or for secondary endpoints or analyses. Formal statistical tests (where 
performed) will be two-sided and testing at the alp ha=0.05 level of significance.   
The sequence of testing to control for multiplicity  associated with comparisons of tolperisone 
to placebo (to assess NI) on multiple days is  Day 1 (single-dose), followed by [CONTACT_2006] 3 (steady-
state), followed by [CONTACT_2006] 2 (residual effect). Tolper isone will be considered NI to placebo if 
prior comparisons (at time points in the sequence p rovided, above) also indicate non-
inferiorty.    
In general, categorical variables will be summarize d by [CONTACT_86195] (N) and percentage of 
subjects (%). Continuous variables will be summariz ed by [CONTACT_154562]-missing 
observations (N), mean, standard deviation (SD), me dian, minimum, and maximum values. 
All study data will be displayed in the data listin gs. 
Safety: 
Safety measures will be summarized using descriptiv e statistics and listed for each subject.

Safety analysis will be based on all subjects enrol led who receive at least [ADDRESS_178841] results will be cate gorized relative to the normal ranges. The 
changes from baseline for each of these parameters from Screening to EOS will be presented.  
Complete listings and summary tables for all safety  information including AEs, laboratory 
safety data, ECG, vital signs and physical examinat ion will be included in the study report. 
Pharmacokinetics: 
The correlations between plasma drug concentrations  and key secondary end points will be 
evaluated. 
The decision as to which plasma samples collected w ill be assayed for evaluation of 
pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics will be determine d by [CONTACT_154563], Inc. 
The relationship between plasma drug levels and dri ving performance will be evaluated, data 
permitting. If indicated, these samples may also be  assayed and/or pooled for assay in an 
exploratory manner for metabolites and/or additiona l pharmacodynamic markers.  
Pharmacodynamics: 
The primary endpoint, SDLP, will be analyzed using a normal theory mixed effects model 
with fixed effects for sequence, period, and treatm ent, and a random effect for subject within 
sequence. An unstructured covariance structure and Kenward-Roger degrees of freedom will 
be used.   
Pair-wise comparisons (hypothesis tests) of differe nces in least squares means, and 95% 
confidence intervals on differences will be provide d for:

Summary statistics will be provided (mean, SD, medi an, minimum, maximum) for SDLP for 
each time point and treatment group. 
Additional details of analysis for secondary endpoi nts of VAS, SDC, KSS, and driving 
performance endpoints will be specificed in the Sta tistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
The relationship between tolperisone plasma drug le vels and driving performance (i.e., the 
primary endpoint of SDLP) will be assessed by [CONTACT_154564].   
All pharmacodynamic results will be summarized in t abular format, with summary statistics 
(number [n], mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum ) and change from baseline, as

6.1  Introduction 
Tolperisone hydrochloride (HCl), a centrally acting  muscle relaxant, is widely used in Europe, 
Asia, and South America for the treatment of abnorm ally increased muscle tone. NR100, an oral 
formulation of tolperisone HCl as film-coated table ts, is being developed by [CONTACT_154565], Inc. as a novel muscle relaxant fo r the treatment of acute and painful symptoms 
associated with muscle spasms resulting from occupa tional and sports-related injury or 
myofascial pain. Future development of NR100 will b e for the separate indication of treatment of 
spasticity associated with neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis and spi[INVESTIGATOR_105538].  
 
While the mode of action of tolperisone HCl is not fully characterized, the most prominent effect 
of tolperisone HCl is its inhibitory action on path ways of spi[INVESTIGATOR_154531]. It suppresses the mono 
and polysynaptic reflex transmission by [CONTACT_154566]-sy naptic and post-synaptic mechanisms. 
Tolperisone HCl has sodium (Na +) and, to a lesser extent, calcium (Ca2 +) channel blocking 
activity. It inhibits, in a relatively selective ma nner, voltage-gated Na + channels. However, even 
with high tolperisone HCl concentrations, channel b lockade remains incomplete and reversible. 
Tolperisone has been shown to have unique analgesic  effects and a lack of sedation effects. 
 
The centrally acting muscle relaxants reduce the in creased muscle tonus and are typi[INVESTIGATOR_154532]. The avoidance of drug-induced c entral depression, e.g., dizziness, 
drowsiness and excessive loss of muscle strength, i s important in the medical care of patients. 
 
The Study 115 will explore the sedative effects of tolperisone HCl after single and multiple 
doses of NR100 compared to placebo, and to a widely  prescribed agent for muscle relaxation 
used as  a positive control, cyclobenzaprine.

on Day 17 to assess for continued safety. 
6.3.2  Tolperisone Dose Level 
For the tolperisone treatment arm, tolperisone will  be administered three times per day, with 
1 tablet administered at 8:00 AM (AM dose), 2:00 PM  (PM dose), and 10:00 PM (HS dose) daily 
for 2 days and 1 tablet at 8:[ADDRESS_178856] at Visit 1, 2, o r 3. Each dose will be a 150 mg tablet of 
tolperisone, for a total daily dose of 450 mg on Da ys 1 and 2, and a total dose of 150 mg on 
Day 3.  
6.3.3  Positive Control Dose Level 
Cyclobenzaprine will serve as the positive control to demonstrate assay sensitivity. For the 
cyclobenzaprine treatment arm, cyclobenzaprine will  be administered three times per day, with 
1 tablet administered at 8:00 AM (AM dose), 2:00 PM  (PM dose), and 10:00 PM (HS dose) daily 
for 2 days and 1 tablet at 8:[ADDRESS_178857] at Visit 1, 2, or 3. Each dose will be a 10 mg tablet of 
cyclobenzaprine, for a total daily dose of 30 mg on  Days 1 and 2, and a total dose of 10 mg on 
Day 3. 
Protocol:  [ADDRESS_178858] of 150 mg TID tolperisone

CVDA Driving Scenario on the CRCDS-MiniSim 
The
 p
resent study employs the CVDA driving scenario, a 62.1 mile (100 km), monotonous, 
two-lane highway driving task that includes a secondary visual vigilance task (DA). The 
monotonous Country Vigilance scenario has been demonstrated to be sensitive to detect the 
effects of fatigue or sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_154535] 
[1]
. This scenario has been useful in 
measu
ring the effects of sleep deprivation, Obstructive Sleep Apnea, chronic primary insomnia, 
and is sensitive to central nervous system (CNS) depressants (e.g., alcohol and sedating 
antihistamines). Results obtained using this methodology are comparable to those obtained using 
over-the-road driving tests

Visual Analog Scales (VAS) to Assess Subject’s Motivation and Self-Appraisal 
After completing the driving simulation, subjects will assess their own performance and their 
level of motivation to perform at their best during the driving simulation. 
Subjects will respond to 2 questions: 
1.
 
How well you think you drove for the last 60 minutes? 
2.
 
How motivated did you feel to drive at your best during the last 60 minutes of driving? 
Subjects will record their response to each question by [CONTACT_740] a vertical line on a 100 mm 
horizontal, linear visual analog scale.  For the self-assessment of driving performance, one end of 
the line is marked “Not Satisfactory”  and the other end of the line is marked “Satisfactory”.  For 
the motivation item, one end of the line is marked “Not Motivated” and the other end is marked 
“Motivated”. Scores on the [ADDRESS_178890]’s scores will be recorded in the CRF.

11.14  Study Drug Preparation and Dispensing 
The Sponsor will supply Tolperisone 150 mg tablets and matching placebo in an unblinded 
fashion. The sites or CRO on behalf of the sites wi ll procure the cyclobenzaprine 10 mg tablets. 
To maintain the double-blind status of the study, t he following dispensing and dosing procedures 
will be followed. The site will identify a qualifie d unblinded dispenser and alternate(s) who will 
be responsible for dispensing and administering the  study treatment. Aside from dispensing and 
administering the study treatment, the qualified un blinded dispenser will not be otherwise 
involved in the study. Cognitive Research Corporati on will provide randomization codes directly 
to the individual identified by [CONTACT_3452]. The  randomization codes will be kept in a secured 
area with access limited to only the assigned unbli nded dispenser.  
The qualified unblinded dispenser will prepare stud y treatment for each subject in a designated 
dispensing room. Prior to administering the first d ose, the qualified unblinded dispenser will 
assign the next available randomization number. For  each dose administered, the unblinded 
dispenser will dispense the appropriate tablet into  a dispensing cup and complete the study 
treatment dispensing record. The study treatment di spensing record will remain in a secure 
locked area with access limited to the qualified un blinded dispenser and the alternate(s). No 
other study personnel will be present in the design ated dispensing room at the time of study 
treatment dispensing.  
11.15  Study Drug Administration 
To maintain the study blind for tolperisone 150 mg,  cyclobenzaprine 10 mg, and placebo, 
subjects will be blindfolded during dosing in each Period. Subjects will be given one tablet at 
approximately 8:00 AM, 2:00 PM, and 10:00 PM daily on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 and at 
8:00 AM on Days 3, 10, and 17. Dosing will be obser ved by a study staff member (qualified 
unblinded dispenser); no other study personnel will  be present at the time of dosing. 
The qualified unblinded dispenser will place the ta blet into a dispensing cup. The blindfolded 
subject will transfer the study treatment directly from the cup into their mouth. All study 
medications will be administered orally with 4-6 ou nces of room temperature water. The subjects 
Protocol:  115 Neurana Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

checks will be performed by [CONTACT_154572]. 
11.16  Concurrent Medication 
• Subjects are to abstain from using psychoactive pre scription or non-prescription 
medications, psychoactive nutritional supplements o r herbal preparations within 2 weeks 
or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) of Day 1.  
• Subjects are to abstain from using any other medica tion or dietary supplement to promote 
sleep, including over the counter sleep medications , during their participation in the study.

Page 41 of 69 12  EVALUATION AND REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
12.1  Adverse Event (AE) Definitions 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence  in a subject administered a medicinal 
product and which does not necessarily have to have  a causal relationship with this treatment. 
AEs occurring after the initiation of the treatment  are referred to as treatment emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs). An AE can therefore be any unfavora ble and unintended sign (for example, an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease t emporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal product, whether or not considered relate d to this medicinal product. 
A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which th ere is a reasonable possibility that the drug 
caused the AE. ‘Reasonable possibility’ means there  is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between the drug and the AE. A suspected adverse re action implies a lesser degree of certainty 
about causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug. 
An AE may be: 
• A new illness, 
• Worsening of a concomitant illness, 
• An effect of the study medication including compara tor; it could be an abnormal 
laboratory value as well as a significant shift fro m baseline within normal range which 
the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_154540]. 
Surgical procedures themselves are not AEs. They ar e therapeutic measures for conditions that 
required surgery. The condition for which the surge ry is required is an AE, if it occurs or is 
detected during the study period. Planned surgical measures permitted by [CONTACT_154575](s) leading to these mea sures are not AEs, if the condition(s) was 
(were) known before the start of study treatment. I n the latter case, the condition should be 
reported as medical history. 
A serious adverse event (SAE) or reaction is any un toward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death, 
• Is life-threatening, 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity (defined as a substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions), 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect, 
• Is an important medical event (including developmen t of drug dependence or drug abuse) 
that may jeopardize the subject or may require inte rvention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed above (according to medical judgmen t of the Principal Investigator). 
12.1.1  Severity Assessment  
All AEs will be graded as mild, moderate, or severe  according to the following definitions: 
Protocol:  115 Neurana Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
28 April 2017 Confidential 
Page 42 of 69 Mild: Causing no limitation of usual activities; th e subject may experience slight 
discomfort. 
Moderate: Causing some limitation of usual activiti es; the subject may experience annoying 
discomfort. 
Severe: Causing inability to carry out usual activi ties; the subject may experience 
intolerable discomfort or pain. 
Every effort will be made to obtain an adequate eva luation of the severity. 
12.1.2  Causality Assessment  
Investigators are required to assess the causal rel ationship (i.e., whether there is reasonable 
possibility that the study drug caused the event) u sing the following definitions: 
• Unrelated: another cause of the adverse event is mo re plausible; a temporal sequence 
cannot be established with the onset of the adverse  event and administration of the study 
agent; or a causal relationship is considered biolo gically implausible. 
 
• Possibly Related: There is a clinically plausible t ime sequence between onset of the 
adverse event and administration of the study agent , but the adverse event could also be 
attributed to concurrent or underlying disease, or the use of other drugs or procedures. 
Possible related should be used when the study agen t is one or several biologically 
plausible adverse event causes. 
 
• Definitely Related: The adverse event is clearly re lated to use of the study agent. 
12.[ADDRESS_178899], every effort will be made to 
determine the final outcome. 
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure s ubjects experiencing AEs receive appropriate 
follow-up, treatment where required, and that every  action is well documented. 
Subjects will be questioned on their health status at the beginning of the study period and before 
the departure from the clinical site. Open-ended qu estions will be asked. 
Classification will be performed by [CONTACT_154576] (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT) using 
the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (M edDRA), version 19.0 or higher. 
Protocol:  115 Neurana Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
28 April 2017 Confidential 
Page 43 of 69 In general, AEs occurring secondary to other events  (e.g., clinical sequelae or a cascade of 
events) should be identified by [CONTACT_5252] . For example, if severe vomiting is known to 
result in dehydration, it is sufficient to record o nly vomiting as SAE or AE in the CRF. However, 
medically significant AEs occurring secondary to an  initiating event that are separated in time 
should be recorded as independent events on the CRF . 
Pregnancy in a female subject on the study shall be  reported to the sponsor within [ADDRESS_178900] igator or designee (for pregnancies occurring 
during the course of the study or immediately follo wing the end of the study). Because of the 
possibility that the fetus/embryo could have been e xposed to the study drug through the parent 
and for the subject’s safety, the pregnancy will be  followed up to determine its outcome, 
including spontaneous or voluntary termination, det ails of birth, presence or absence of any birth 
defects, congenital anomalies, or maternal and/or n ewborn complications. 
The pregnancy will be recorded and reported by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_154541]. Pregnancy follow-up will also be properly recorded to ensure quality and completeness 
of the data belonging to the study drug and will in clude an assessment of the possible causal 
relation between the study drug and any pregnancy o utcome. Any SAE experienced during 
pregnancy will be reported on a SAE Report Form. 
12.[ADDRESS_178901](s). Information not available at the time o f the initial report (e.g., an end date for the AE,  
laboratory values received after the report, or hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_44458]) must be documented. 
All follow-up information must be reported as soon as the relevant info is available. 
The notification should be directed to the followin g sponsor representatives:

An SAE will be considered “unexpected” if the AE is  not listed in the investigator brochure or is 
not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an investigator brochure is 
not required or available, is not consistent with t he risk information described in the general 
investigational plan or elsewhere in the current ap plication. "Unexpected," as used in this 
definition, also refers to AEs that are mentioned i n the Investigator’s Brochure as occurring with 
a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmac ological properties of the drug, but are not 
specifically mentioned as occurring with the partic ular drug under investigation. 
Protocol:  [ADDRESS_178903] be reported in an expedited manner to the 
appropriate regulatory agencies. If so, the sponsor  will report the event to the appropriate 
regulatory agencies, and all participating investig ators. 
If reports of any new and unexpected AEs become ava ilable to the sponsor during the clinical 
portion of this study (related or not to the presen t study), the sponsor must advise the sites of 
those events.

effects. The following assumptions were made in the  sample size computation: (a) within-subject 
standard deviation for SDLP is approximately 6 cm; (b) the true difference between tolperisone 
doses and placebo is 0; and, (c) the non-inferiorit y (NI) margin is proposed to be 4.[ADDRESS_178905] seen with 0.05% of BAC with this driv ing simulator scenario. Under these 
assumptions, a sample of 30 subjects would provide in excess of 90% power to establish non-
inferiority of tolperisone compared to placebo on a ny given dosing day in terms of the primary 
end point, SDLP. This sample size is considered mor e than adequate to detect cyclobenzaprine 
differences from placebo, which are anticipated to exceed the NI margin. 
13.2  Analysis Populations 
• PK Population – All subjects with evaluable plasma concentration data will be included 
in the pharmacokinetic population.  
• Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population – The ITT Populati on includes all randomized subjects 
who receive at least 1 dose of study drug in a give n treatment period. This is the analysis 
population for efficacy analysis. Subjects will (in  general) be included in all analyses for 
which data are non-missing. 
• Safety Population – The Safety Population includes all subjects who received at least 1 
dose of study drug. 
13.3  Statistical Analysis – General Considerations 
This section describes the general approaches plann ed to analyze the data from this study.  
Additional details of the planned analyses outlined  here, will be further described in the SAP.   
Doses of tolperisone will be considered non-inferio r to placebo if the upper 95% confidence limit 
on the difference in SDLP between that dose and pla cebo is less than 4.4 cm (the NI margin).  
Cyclobenzaprine comparisons to placebo are to asses s assay sensitivity and no adjustment to 
Protocol:  115 Neurana Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
28 April 2017 Confidential 
Page 45 of 69 alpha levels will be made for either the comparison  of cyclobenzaprine to placebo or tolperisone, 
or for secondary endpoints or analyses.  Formal sta tistical tests (where performed) will be two-
sided and testing at the alpha=0.05 level of signif icance.   
The sequence of testing to control for multiplicity  associated with comparisons of tolperisone to 
placebo (to assess NI) on multiple days is  Day 1 ( single-dose) , followed by [CONTACT_2006] 3 (steady-
state), followed by [CONTACT_2006] 2 (residual effect).  Tolpe risone will be considered NI to placebo if prior 
comparisons ( at time points in the sequence provid ed, above) also indicate non-inferiorty.

taking part in a research study is entirely voluntary. 
 
Second, you need to know that 
there
 
are important differences between being cared for in a research study and being 
cared for by [CONTACT_154596] a research study.  Participating in a research study is 
not the same as getting regular medical care.  The purpose of regular medical care is to 
improve your health.  The purpose of a research study is to gather information.  Being in 
this study does not replace your regular medical care
.  
Therefore, 
it is 
important that you 
understand the difference between the regular care you get from your
 
doctor and what
 
is
 
involved in this research study.
 
 
This consent document gives you important information about the research study.    
Please read this information carefully before deciding to take part.  No one can make 
you take part and you can stop at
 
any time.  If you choose to take part in this research 
study, you will need to sign
 
and date
 
this consent document and you will receive a copy 
of this signed and dated document for your records.

The following sections describe the research study.
  
Before you decide to take 
part, please take as much time as you need to ask questions with 
the 
study team, 
with family and friends, or with your personal physician or other healthcare 
professional
s.
  
The study team will 
fully 
answer any questions you have before 
you make a decision.
   
 
1.
 
WHAT IS THE 
PURPOSE OF THE STUDY?
 
The purpose of this research study is to compare how certain drugs affect 
how 
you feel, 
how you perform on a simulated driving task, and your cognitive functioning after taking 
the drug. This research study will compare the effects of the following study drugs:  
tolperisone, cyclobenzaprine,
 
and placebo.
 
 
During the study, subjects will receive oral doses of 450 mg tolperisone (150 mg 
administered three times daily),
 
30 mg cyclobenzaprine (10 mg administered three times 
daily), and placebo. Subjects will receive each 
study treatment
 
for the [ADDRESS_178925]
 
day.
 
 
Tolperisone
 
is
 
marketed in multiple countries in Europe, 
and 
Asia, 
for
 
muscle spasticity 
(tightness or stiffness) and muscle spasms
.
 
It 
will be
 
studied in the [LOCATION_002] to 
determine its safety and efficacy (how well it works).
 
 
Cyclobenzaprine
 
has been 
approved 
by [CONTACT_154597]

It
 
is available by [CONTACT_154598]

The [ADDRESS_178926] dose typi[INVESTIGATOR_154552]
. 
 
Researchers use a placebo 
(sugar pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]) 
to see if the study drug works better or is safer 
than not taking any drug
. 
 
Because this is a research study, the study drugs will be given to you only during this 
study and not after the study is over.

You 
will 
need to visit the 
research 
site 
5 times
 
during the study, including 
3 visits with 3 overnight stays

WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY?
 
The purpose of this research study is to compare how certain drugs affect how you feel, 
how you perform on a simulated driving task, and your cognitive functioning after taking 
the drug. This research study will compare the effects of the following 
study d
rugs:  
tolperisone, cyclobenzaprine, and placebo.
 
 
During the study, subjects will receive oral doses of 450 mg tolperisone (150 mg 
administered three times daily), 30 mg cyclobenzaprine (10 mg administered three times 
daily), and placebo. Subjects will receive each 
study treatment
 
for the [ADDRESS_178945]
 
day.
 
 
Tolperisone
 
is
 
marketed in multiple countries in Europe, 
and 
Asia, 
for
 
muscle spasticity 
(tightness or stiffness) and muscle spasms.
 
It will be studied in the [LOCATION_002] to 
determine its safety and efficacy (how well it works).
 
 
Cyclobenzaprine 
has been 
approved 
by [CONTACT_154620]
®
. 
 
It
 
is available by [CONTACT_154621].  The [ADDRESS_178946] dose typi[INVESTIGATOR_154555].
 
 
Researchers use a placebo (sugar pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]) to see if the study drug works better or is safer 
than not taking any drug
. 
 
Because this is a research study, the study drugs will be given to you only during this 
study and not after the study is over.

HOW MANY OTHER PEOPLE WILL BE IN THE STUDY?
 
There will be about [ADDRESS_178947]?
 
If you decide to participate, y
ou will be in this 
study for at least 3 weeks but no longer 
than 7 weeks
. 
You will need to visit the research site 5 times during the study, including 
3 visits with 3 overnight stays.

After signing and dating this consent document, you will begin in the study with a 
screening visit.  The purpose of the screening visit is to find out if you meet all of the 
requirements to take part in this research study.  
 
 
During the screening visit, you will be asked to have the following tests and activities or 
assessments: 
 
 
 
♦
 
Provide a social and medical history;
 
♦
 
An electrocardiogram
 (
ECG
, a recording of the heart’s rhythm
) 
will be performed;
 
♦

asked about any medications and treatments you are currently 
taking.  It is important to tell the study site staff if you are taking any “over the 
counter” medications, herbal or natural remedies or dietary supplements;
 
♦
 
Physical examination
 
and vital signs
 
(includes an examination of major body 
systems, height, weight, blood pressure
 
while lying down and sta
nding,
 
pulse 
[heartrate], oral 
temperature, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] [breathing] rate);
 
♦
 Y
ou will provide a urine sample
 
and be given a breathalyzer test. The urine 
sample will be used for safety laboratory assessments (urinalysis)
 
and to detect 
drugs and alcohol that are not allowed in this study, including illegal drugs (such 
as: amphetamines, methamphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], cocaine, 
cannabinoids, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_858]).  Your urine sample must test negative for all of these 
drugs
, 
and your breathalyzer must
 
test negative for alcohol to participate
 
in the 
study;

Collection
 
of about [ADDRESS_178948] HIV (
Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus) or hepatitis (liver 
problem), and will also measure blood counts (hematology) and organ function 
(blood chemistry)
.
  
For females who could become pregnant, the sample will also 
be used to help confirm 
if
 
you are pregnant.
 
If the HIV
 
or hepatitis result is 
positive, the physician in charge of the study or designee will personally inform 
you and at that moment he or she will indicate the procedure to follow. Note that 
a positive result for HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C must be reported to the public 
health department as required by [CONTACT_2371].  If you have any questions about what 
information is required to be reported, please ask the Study Doctor or study staff.
 
All blood collections for this study will be taken by [CONTACT_154622].

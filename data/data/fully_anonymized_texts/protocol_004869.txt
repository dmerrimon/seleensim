1.0 Background  and Rationale  
 
1.1 Introduction:  
According to the USDA Economic Research Service Food Availability Data, beef consumption 
has been on a general decline for the past 40 years , with current per capi[INVESTIGATOR_612700] 35% lower in [ADDRESS_812292] -food chains such as Burger King and McDonalds, to offer 
vegetarian burgers  as healthy alternatives to the traditional beef burger. However, examination

 of the components of the macronutrient matrix of a typi[INVESTIGATOR_612701] a traditional beef patty -hamburger.  
 
1.2 Previous research on the topic : 
One of the principal nutritional benefits of dietary protein in a food source is the stimulation of 
muscle protein turnover and the net gain of body protein (the anabolic response) (1).  
Table 1  shows key aspects of the macronutrient matrix of the Impossible Burger and an 80/20 
percent beef patty, with particular emphasis on the protein/essential amino acid (EAA) content. 
The Impossible Burger was chosen as a representative vegetarian burger bec ause soy, which 
is the highest quality plant -based protein, is the principal protein source (2). Four -ounce 
servings of a beef patty and of an Impossible Burger each provide 19 g of protein. However, a 
closer inspection of the macronutrient matrix of the t wo food sources reveals that the 4 oz beef 
patty contains more than twice the amount of essential amino acids (EAAs) as compared to a 
4 oz Impossible Burger. We recently completed an NCBA -supported study in which the 
anabolic responses to seven different “ ounce equivalents” of protein food sources, as 
described by [CONTACT_612705], were quantified using stable isotope tracers. Rather than 
being metabolically equivalent, as implied by [CONTACT_612706] “ounce 
equivalent” protein food sources,  we found that there was a linear relation between the net 
gain in body protein and the EAA content of the protein food source ( Figure 1A ) (3). Moreover, 
the slope of the relation between EAA content and increase in net protein balance was 
approximately 1,  meaning that any difference in EAA content directly corresponded to an 
equivalent difference in net body protein gain ( Figure 1B ).

 These results support the notion that the EAA content of a protein food source is principally 
responsible for the magnitude of the anabolic r esponse. This fundamental concept is the basis 
for the scoring of protein quality by [CONTACT_612707] (DIAAS) 
(4). With relevance to the comparison of a beef patty and an Impossible Burger, we found that 
consumpt ion of 2 ounces of beef resulted in an anabolic response that was approximately 4 g 
net gain of protein greater than the response to consumption of 2 ounces tofu (Figure 1) (3). 
The difference in anabolic responses corresponds to the difference in the EAA content of the 
two protein food sources (Figure 1A). Muscle protein fractional synthesis rate was also greater 
in those consuming beef as opposed to tofu. Further, compi[INVESTIGATOR_612702] -house data set 
across various populations and food sources indicates t hat the EAA content of a protein food 
source explains 80.4% of the variance in the total amount of body protein gained (5). This 
large dataset has allowed us to develop a predictive equation that indicates the total amount of 
body protein gained will be 7. 6 g from 4.2 g of EAA (the Impossible Burger) and 16.5 g from 
8.9 g of EAA (beef patty). Stated differently, the greater EAA content of a [ADDRESS_812293] for protein quality is misleading and 
creates a false perception of equivalent nutritional benefit of the two pr otein food sources. In

 addition to the greater EAA content per gram protein, the profile of EAAs in beef protein more 
closely reflects the dietary requirements for individual EAAs, as reflected by a DIAAS 
approximately 40% greater than soy protein. In addi tion, the overall macronutrient matrix of a 
protein food source can potentially influence the anabolic response by [CONTACT_612708]. Both the peak concentration of EAAs after consumption as well as the time to 
reach the peak concentratio n affect the anabolic response (5). The Impossible Burger contains 
various binders and starches that could potentially interfere with the absorption of the EAA 
from the protein matrix, with a resultant slowing of the rate of absorption and blunting of the 
maximal concentrations of EAAs in the blood and the speed at which the peak concentrations 
are reached. These factors likely have a corresponding negative impact on the magnitude of 
the anabolic response. Since no such issues impede the digestibility of be ef protein, it is 
reasonable to propose that the plasma EAA levels will reach higher peak EAA concentrations, 
and achieve the peak concentrations more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], than ingestion of the same amount of EAAs 
in the matrix of the Impossible Burger. As a result of  both the advantageous profile of EAAs in 
beef protein and the more rapid absorption of EAAs, we propose that a beef patty will not only 
provide a greater anabolic response than an iso -nitrogenous amount of Impossible Burger, but 
that also consumption of [ADDRESS_812294] twice that of a beef patty when normalized for the 
amount of EAAs (Table 1). We therefore anticipate that differences in anabolic responses 
between a beef patty and Impossib le Burger will be amplified when normalized by [CONTACT_612709].

 concentrations, a greater balance between whole body protein synthesis and breakdown, and 
a greater increase in muscle protein fractional synthetic rate (FSR).  
2. Consumption of a 4 oz beef patty will result in a greater anabolic response than 
consumption of two 4 oz Impossible Burgers, including greater increases in plasma EAA 
concentrations, gr eater balance between whole body protein synthesis and breakdown, and 
greater increase in muscle protein FSR.  
 
3.0 Study  Design  and Procedures  
 
We will enroll up to 28 subjects with a goal to study up to 24 healthy male and females . We will 
use a 10-hour period to measure the protein metabolism in  response to the study food (one 
beef patty, one vegi -burger, or two vegi -burgers).   
 
3.1 Study Visits  
Visit 1: subjects will come to the UAMS TRI for informed consent discussion. Once consent is 
obtained, subsequent study procedures will be performed. A medical history  questionnaire 
including allergies  and list of current medications will be completed . Females of child bearing 
capacity will be aske d to provide a urine sample for pregnancy testing.  About 4mL of venous 
blood will be drawn to send for complete blood count for study criteria. Blood and u rine 
samples will be sent to LabCorp . 
Subjects will be asked to perform the following tests and measurements at visit 1:  
Standing height without shoes (in cm),  
Body weight without shoes (in kg),  
If subject meets the requirements  (fasted for at least [ADDRESS_812295] 24 hours)  to perform the DEXA 
scan and In Body scan on visit 1, these tests will be performed at that time. If they do not, 
these tests will be performed at Visit 2.  
Run-in meals will be discus sed with subjects to elicit food allergies or intolerances.

 Visit 2 : Subjects return to the UAMS TRI. If they will undergo the DEXA and InBody scans, the 
must  have fasted for at least [ADDRESS_812296] visit. The In Body , DEXA , ultrasound  scan s will be performed if these were not done 
at visit 1.  Two days’ of run -in meals will be dispensed with instructions on their preparation. 
Meals will be consumed for the two days immediately preceding Visit 3.  
 
Visit 3: Subjects return to the UAMS TRI having fasted overnight. Study staff will ask about 
advers e events since their last visit. Vital signs (heartrate, blood pressure and oral 
temperature) will be measured. The study nurse will insert an IV catheter into a vein o f one of 
the subjects’ arms  to use for periodic  blood sampling , warming the arm by [CONTACT_15276] a heating 
pad or a heated plastic box . A second IV catheter will be placed into a vein on of the subject ’s 
other arm to use for stable isotope infusion.  
After an i nitial blood sample is obtained, the priming dose of isotopes are given IV push, the 
constant infusions are begun, and a timer is started . Blood and muscle samples are obtained 
according to the schedule below.  
The study food is served after the 4: 00 blood/muscle sample are obtained. Subje cts are asked 
to consume the study food  within 10 minute s. 
At the conclusion of 10 hours elapsed time , the IV catheter s are removed and the site s 
dressed with a bandage. Vital signs (heartrate, blood pressure and oral temperature) will be 
measured.  A snack and beverage will be offered to the subject. Subject will then be free to 
leave.

 3.6 Randomization  
Subjects will be stratified by [CONTACT_612712] (one beef 
patty, one Impossi ble Burger, or two Impossible Burgers).  
 
3.7 Muscle Biopsy Procedure  
At Visit 3, qualified and credentialed study staff (M.D. ) will perform three  separate vastus 
lateralis muscle biops ies of the subject’s preferred outer thigh using 1% plain lidocaine for 
anesthesia. One incision will be used for all 3 biopsies. Approximately 100mg of muscle tissue  
per biopsy  will be obtained using a Bergstrom needle. The tissue will be rinsed with normal 
saline and flash frozen usin g liquid nitrogen. The sample will be transferred into a labelled cryo 
tube and frozen at < -60 degrees C in the PI’s lab.  Processing and analyses will take place in 
batches according to the procedures mentioned in 7.3 below.  
the incision will be closed wi th a medical glue, then dressed using a transparent adhesive 
bandage followed by a 6” wide elastic wrap that will protect the site from incidental contact [CONTACT_612713]. Subjects are provided verbal and written instructions for care of the 
biopsy site, along with the phone number of the study nurse should they have any questions or 
concerns once leaving the study site.

 5.3 Study foods : 
The run -in meals are comprised of frozen, ready -to-eat portions that are commercially 
available at most grocery stores (e.g. Stouffers) . The ‘test’ foods are:  
• one 4 ounce (cooked weight) patty of 80/20 beef (from Kroger e.g.)  
• one 4 ounce Impossible Burger  (https://impossiblefoods.com/products/burger ) 
• two [ADDRESS_812304] of 
foods and asked if any of them are intolerable.  
 
5.4 Stable Isotope In fusion: 
The primary  risks of in fusion  of the stable isotope s are fever, chills, infection (from 
contamination). A 0.2 micron in -line filter will be used during the infusion.  The isotopes will be 
purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories ( Tewksbury, MA , [LOCATION_003]) and sent to the 
Center for Translational Research in Aging and Longevity at [LOCATION_007] A&M University (College

Subjects will be COVID -19 negative and/or asymptomatic. Subjects will undergo the current 
screening procedures in place for UAMS patients at the time of their visits. Visitors will not be 
permitted unless UAMS policy changes permit them. Subjects will be required to wear a 
suitable facemask for th e entirety of their study visits except when ingesting their meals. Study 
staff will wear their mandated masks and use universal blood -borne precautions while handing 
blood samples. Study visit areas are disinfected after study visits as per protocol.  
 
5.9 Safety Monitoring Plan  
Study staff will monitor for adverse events and protocol deviations though the end of the study. 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_83619] (if necessary) will be notified of adverse events shortly after their 
discovery. If a subject has an adverse event while on site, st udy staff  will help get the care the 
subject need s. This may include first aid, emergency care, and/or follow -up care . 
Adverse events and protocol deviations will be recorded on an Excel spreadsheet that is filed 
with the IRB at specific intervals. Any “un expected problems involving risks to subjects or 
others” (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845]) will be reported to the IRB within 24 hours of discovery.

A group size of [ADDRESS_812307] to mean response of net protein 
synthesis after adjusting for baseline measures. With this sample size, the ANCOVA model 
has 80% power to detect effect sizes of f  = 0.484 or larger. This estimate assumes that the 
baseline covariate explains 50% of the variation in the response. A 5% α -level will be used to 
determine statistical significance.  
 
7.3 Sample Processing and Analyses  
Calculation of protein kinetics: The c alculation of whole -body protein kinetics (protein 
synthesis, protein breakdown, and net protein balance) is based on the determination of the 
rate of appearance (Ra) of phenylalanine (Phe) and of tyrosine (Tyr) into plasma and the 
fractional Ra of endogen ous tyrosine resulting from phenylalanine hydroxylation. A two -pool 
model has been previously described and discussed in detail (6). Briefly, an isotopic steady 
state will be established in the baseline/fasted period, and protein kinetics are calculated 
accordingly (6). For the 6 hours after ingestion of the patty, the area under the curve (AUC) of 
plasma enrichments of phenylalanine and tyrosine tracers will be calculated. Ra of Phe reflects 
protein breakdown in the fasted state; the total appearance of Ph e over the [ADDRESS_812308] pro tein, and the measured fraction of absorbed Phe hydroxylated

 to tyrosine (6). We have recently discussed in detail the validity of assumptions underlying this 
model of protein kinetics (6). Most importantly, this model does not introduce any systematic 
errors that might affect the comparison of the anabolic responses to the burgers (6). The rate 
of muscle protein synthesis will be calculated by [CONTACT_612717], taken to be th e intracellular free 
phenylalanine enrichment.  
Analytic methods: Plasma samples will be processed as previously described for determination 
of enrichment by [CONTACT_48577] -mass spectrometry (7). Plasma amino acid 
concentrations will be determined by [CONTACT_612718] -mass spectrometry using the 
internal standard method as described previously (3). Plasma insulin concentrations will be 
measured by [CONTACT_612719] (Alpco Diagnostics, Salem, MA).  
After all data has been a nalyzed and verified, samples for which permission was not granted 
for indefinite retention will be discarded into a biohazard trash bag and disposed in accordance 
with UAMS biohazardous waste policy.

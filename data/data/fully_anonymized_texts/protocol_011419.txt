Palbo T- DM1  - Protocol Version 5 & Date 01/25 /2021  Intervention  
 
T-DM1 is administered IV q21days at 3.6mg/Kg. This is available commercially . 
 Palbociclib is given orally at 125mg on days 5 -18 of 21 day cycle (supplied by [CONTACT_4618]) .  
 
    
Study Schema  
 
  
 
 
Statistical analysis 
 Sample size calculation  
 This is a prospective single arm phase II study to estimate progression free survival of 
combination T- DM1 + palbociclib . Expected PFS for T -DM1 based on the EMILIA trial is 9.[ADDRESS_1241151] a  PFS of 16. 3 months  (HR = 0.5 6) in the combination 
arm compared to the standard historical control arm, with 80% statistical power and a 0.[ADDRESS_1241152]  16 subjects complete 12 months of treatment or 
come off study  (whichever comes first)  to conduct a futility analysis.  If at least 8/[ADDRESS_1241153] PFS beyond 12 months then we declare the combination as promising for future studies. Our null hypothesis is 40% have PFS at 12mths (median survival of 9.1 
months) Alternative hypothesis is 60% survive 12 months.

Palbo T- DM1  - Protocol Version 5 & Date 01/25 /2021   
Primary Objective s 
 
1. Progression free survival of the combination of T-DM1 with p albociclib  will be estimated 
using the Kaplan- Meier  
 
Statistical considerations for secondary aims  
Secondary Objective s  
1. The overall response (CR + PR + stable disease) will be estimated using an exact binomial 
confidence interval  
2. Overall survival will be analyzed similarly as progression free survival . 
 Interim monitoring and interim analysis  
 We propose a futility analysis after  the first  16 patients complete either 12 months of treatment or 
come off study (which ever comes first). I f [ADDRESS_1241154] PFS beyond 12 months, we will continue accrual 
for a total of 46 evaluable patients  (30 additional patients) .  Enrollment will be held briefly only 
after the first 16 patients complete either 12 months of treatment or come off study (which ever 
comes first).  
 
Feasibility issues:  This is a multi- site single arm phase II trial (expected number of sites is 15 )  
01/2018- 08/2018- protocol finalizing, contracting with CRO, study sites startups, IN D preparation, 
study protocol to be reviewed by [CONTACT_887036] 
Q4 2018- accrual of first patient  (happened 12 /2018)   
Accrual estimates – approximately 2-3/month (anticipate accrual of total 46 patients ) 
Q42020- enrolled subjects into combination arm are 11 , timeline below is for additional 35 
subjects and anticipated total of 46  
Q4 2021- complete accrual  
Q4 2021- Q4 2022- monitor for study completion 
Q1 2023- complete final analysis  
Q1 2023- Q2 2023- ASCO presentation, complete manuscript and prepare for submission 
(JCO/CCR)  
Study duration:  5 years ( 36 months’ accrual and 24 months of follow up) from startup  and close 
out would be an additional 10 months .

Palbo T- DM1  - Protocol Version 5 & Date 01/25 /[ADDRESS_1241155] cancer  
Overexpression of the human epi[INVESTIGATOR_5169] 2 (HER2) oncogene is estimated to occur in 25- 30% 
of all human breast cancers.  This subset of breast cancer is classified as HER2- positive cancer, a subtype 
that is particularly aggressive and associated with greater risk for disease progression and death (Callahan 
and Hurvitz, 2011).  First line therapy for patients with metastatic HER2- positive breast tumors is combination 
of Taxane with dual HER2 targeted therapy - pertuzumab (perjeta) and trastuzumab (Herceptin), humanized 
monoclonal antibod ies targeting the HER2 extracellular domain (Baselga, 2012) .  However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_887012]2- positive breast 
cancer, still many patients develop disease progression Subsequent therapy for such patient s includes T -
DMI. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_887013] T -DM1 over the lapatinib- capecitabine regimen, and 
T-DM1 has attained FDA approval for the treatment of HER2- positive breast cancer as a second line treatment 
(Verma, 2012). However, even with T -DM1, the progression- free survival is only 9.6 mos. It is prudent to know 
that in EMILIA trial patients had prior exposure to trastuzumab only. The true PFS on T -DM1 after disease 
progression on combination treatment with pertuzumab  and trastuzumab is not well defined. After progression 
on T-DM1, lapatinib, a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets both HER2 and the epi[INVESTIGATOR_33927] -EGFR, is typi[INVESTIGATOR_292717] d in combination with capecitabine (Callahan and Hurvitz, 2011; 
Moreira and Kaklamani, 2010).  This therapy gain ed FDA approval based on increasing progression- free 
survival in a phase [ADDRESS_1241156] cancer, there is still significant need for novel targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_887014].  
 
2.2 Pre-clinical/clinical experience  
 
Mechanism of action, pre- clinical and clinical data for T -DM1  
T-DM1 is an antibody conjugate with the therapeutic antibody trastuzumab with derivatized lysine linked via 
maleimido bonds to the microtubule poison emtansine.  Preclinical studies demonstrated that T -DM1 is 
effective against HER2+ breast cancer models including cell lines and xenografts that are resistant to trastuzumab (Barok, 2011; Junttila, 2011).  These studies indicated that T -DM1 kills HER2 -positive breast 
cancer cells  both through the cytotoxic effects of emtansine including apoptosis and mitotic catastrophe, while 
also eliciting antibody mediated cellular toxicity.  
T-DM1 has been utilized in the treatment of greater than 500 patients with HER2- positive disease.  The 
phase 1 studies led to the current dosing schedule of 3.6mg/kg by [CONTACT_887037] a 3- week 
schedule (Krop, 2010).  The main dose limiting toxicity ( DLT) was thrombocytopenia.  The phase 2 and 3 
studies demonstrated efficacy relative to the FDA -appro ved regimens (Verma, 2012) for recurrent disease 
previously treated with HER2 antagonists (trastuzumab or lapatinib) with progression- free survival of 4.6- 9.6 
months reported (Krop, 2012; Verma, 2012; Burris, 2011).  
 
Mechanism of action, pre- clinical and c linical data for Palbociclib  
Palbociclib (or PD -0332991) is an orally available, pyridopyridimidine- derived, selective inhibitor of cyclin 
dependent kinase 4/6- CDK4/6 (Fry, 2004; Toogood, 2005).  Functionally, palbociclib is a potent and highly 
selective inhibitor of CDK4/6- cyclin D1 kinase activity, which ultimately results in the inhibition of 
retinoblastoma- Rb protein phosphorylation and cell cycle arrest.  
In vitro and in xenograft model, palbociclib  was observed to inhibit a panel of RB -positive, solid tumor cell 
lines (Fry, 2004; Finn, 2009; Dean, 2010; Thangavel, 2011).  In a genetically engineered syngeneic animal model, palbociclib  was effective at inhibiting the proliferation of mammary tumors in MMTV -HER2/Neu 
transgenic mice (Choi, 2012).  Combined, these data suggest that palbociclib  will likely be active in 
advanced breast cancer.  
A phase 1 clinical trial with palbociclib  in patients with Rb- positive advanced solid tumors demonstrated a 
therapeutic dose of 125 mg/d for 21d of a 28 d cycle, or 200mg/d for 14d of a 21 d cycle. The principal 
15 
Palbo T- DM1  - Protocol Version 5 & Date 01/25 /2021  dose- limiting toxicity -DLT was myelosuppression (Flaherty, 2011). A phase 2 study (PALOMA- 1) of 
palbociclib with letrozole demonstrated a marked delay in disease progression in patients with advanced 
ER-positive breast cancer (Finn, 2012) . Subsequently a randomized double- blind phase 3 trial (PALOMA-
2) conducted in postmenopausal women with ER+/HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer demonstrated 
significant im provement in PFS  (Finn et al, 2016) . Based on the data from PALOMA -1, US FDA granted 
accelerated approval for palbociclib.  Results of PALOMA -3 which was a randomized double- blind phase 3 
trial for women with HR+/HER2 negative who progressed on or after endocrine therapy in the adjuvant or metastatic setting demonstrated improved PFS for the combination arm (fulvestrant + palbociclib) versus 
single agent fulvestrant  (Turner et al 2015). Based on these results currently palbociclib is indicated for the 
treatment of HR+/HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer with an aromatase inhibitor as initial endocrine 
therapy in postmenopausal women or fulvestrant in women with disease progression following endocrine therapy.     
Rationale for treatment of HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer with palbociclib  
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_887015]2- positive breast cancer, immediate 
and acquired resistance to this targeted agent remains a significant clinical issue.  Furthermore, while drugs 
such as T -DM1 and lapatinib have demonstrated efficacy in trastuzumab- resistant patients, disease 
progression remains a challenge (Geyer, 2006; Blackwell, 2009; Blackwell, 2010).  Thus, there is still significant need for novel targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_887016]2- positive 
breast cancer. Preclinical studies have demonstrated palbociclib combined with microtubule poison prevented outgrowth of cell clones (McClendon et al., 2012). In addition, other preclinical studies with 
palbociclib have demonstrated efficacy in HER2- overexpressing cell lines and xenografts as well as mouse 
tumors in vivo ( Witkiewicz et al, 2014).  These pre -clinical findings suggest that palbociclib  can be 
particularly effective in delaying progression in HER2 positive breast cancer by [CONTACT_887038].  Thes e data are further supported by [CONTACT_887039] ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
While such preclinical data are suggestive of cooperation between the various components that constitute 
T-DM1, none of these studies can accurately model the complexity of human and tumor physiology or 
predict response.    
Rationale for combination of T -DM1 and palbociclib  : T-DM1 elicits cytotoxicity via emtansine and can 
induce ADCC. The CDK4/6 inhibition will be delivered to limit outgrowth of resistant clones and limit progression between the bolus delivery of T -DM1. Pre -clinical studies show that T -DM1 and CDK4/[ADDRESS_1241157] mechanisms of action, and could yield cooperative effects in terms of disease control. CDK 4/[ADDRESS_1241158] cancer models. (Witkiewicz et al, 2014)  
 
It may be a concern that palbociclib could interfere with the immunological effect of T -DM1.This concern 
is noted however there were several papers published recently that CDK4/6 inhibition (palbociclib) 
increases anti -tumor immune response eg of one such citation is below. Given this combination would be 
appropriate and deems further investigation. (Goel et al.2017)  
 
A phase I trial is currently ongoing to evaluate the safety of combination of T -DM1 with palbociclib .  In an 
effort to mitigate any potential toxicity and utilize each drug to its maximal effect, T -DM1 is being given on 
day 1 (of a 21 day cycle) to target rapi[INVESTIGATOR_887017]. The serum half -life of T -DM1 is about 
3.5 days (Krop, 2010).  Palbociclib  is given  on day 5 – day [ADDRESS_1241159] survived T -DM1 will be prevented from proliferation .  As palbociclib  serum half -
life is 24 hours (Schwartz, 2011) the drug is being discontinued four days before the next T -DM1 dose  (see 
section 2.2.4 for detailed study design).  
Clinical experience with combination for T -DM1 and palbociclib  
 
There is an ongoing phase I data evaluating the combination of T -DM1 with palbociclib in patients with 
metastatic HER2- positive breast cancer that have failed prior HER2- targeted therapy (including T -DM1 in 
16 
Palbo T- DM1  - Protocol Version 5 & Date 01/25 /2021  the second line)  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  The study is based on the preclinical data with T -DM1 and palbociclib .   
T-DM1 is delivered at the standard of care dose (IV q21days at 3.6mg/Kg).    Palbociclib  is administered 
orally at increasing dose levels  (100mg , 150mg  and 200 mg) on days 5- 18 (of a 21 day cycle)  (Figure 1) .  
The rationale of the study was to translate preclinical data investigating if using palbociclib  can prevent 
proliferation of resistant disease when the levels of T -DM1 are diminishing based on the pharmacokinetics 
of both agents.   Standard 3+ 3 phase 1 study design was used to guide dose escalation of palbociclib  at 
100mg, 150mg and 200mg. The trial accrued 9 patients with three at each dose level.  Table 1 lists patient 
characteristics on the trial.  Neutropenia was dose related and grade 3 neutropenia was observed in 1/3 
patients at 100mg dose level, 2/3 patients at 150mg and 3/3 patients at 200mg dose. The hematological 
toxicities were resolved with dose interruption.  Table 2 lists all the adverse events observed in the trial.  No 
grade 4 toxicities were observed. 4/9 patients had stable disease and 3/9 patients had partial response with an average of 193 days on study  (figure 2) .

The pre-clinical, clinical and toxicity data support  the need for a larger phase II trial with a 
modifiable dose of 125 mg of palbociclib  (which is  the approved dose currently , to limit the need 
for dose delay and allowing for the evaluation of efficacy).

7. Adverse Events (AEs)  
 
7.1 Adverse Events Definition 
 
AEs will be determined using the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) version 4.03 for Toxicity and Adverse Event reporting.  A copy of the CTCAE version 
4.03 can be downloaded from CTEP home page ( http://ctep.info.nih.gov ). 
 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding, 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug) in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have 
a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with 
the use of a medicinal product, whether or not  related to the medicinal product.   
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_129297] 
(e.g., surgical insertion of central line) need not be considered AEs and should not be recorded 
as an AE.  Disease progression should not be recorded as an AE, unless it is attributable by [CONTACT_760133].  
 
 
7.2 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) Definition  
 
An AE is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any  of 
the following outcomes : 
• Death;  
• Is life -threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as 
it occurred);  
29 
Palbo T- DM1  - Protocol Version 5 & Date 01/25 /2021  • Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (>24 hours) or prolongation of existing 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];*  
• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
• Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions; 
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in the definition.  For reporting purpos es, also consider the 
occurrences of pregnancy as an event which must be reported as an important medical event.  
 *Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_887019], central line insertion, metastasis interventional therapy, resection of primary tumor, or elective surgery, will not be considered serious adverse events.  
 Pregnancy that occurs during the study must also be reported as an SAE.  
 7.[ADDRESS_1241177] begin from day 1 of study treatment and continue through the 30 
day follow -up period after treatment is discontinued.   
 Collected information should be recorded in the Case Report Forms (CRF) for that patient. Documentation will include, but is not limited to:  
 
• Grade  
• Relationship to study drug (not related, unlikely, possible, probable, definitely)  
• Causality other than study drug (disease related, concomitant medication related, intercurrent illness, other)   
• Date of onset, date of resolution 
• Frequency of event (single, intermittent, continuous)  
• Event outcome (resolved, ongoing, death)  
• Action taken (none, held, dose reduced, discontinued, medication given)  
 
7.[ADDRESS_1241178] be r eported to Protocol PI [INVESTIGATOR_887020] 24 hours of learning of 
its occurrence.  Specifics will be noted in the SAE Reporting Guidelines.  A paper SAE report form might also be required.  
 
SAEs are to be reported to your IRB in accordance w ith IRB reporting policies.  
 
30 
Palbo T- DM1  - Protocol Version 5 & Date 01/25 /[ADDRESS_1241179] Charter.  
 All submitted serious adverse events will be processed by [CONTACT_887045]. The assigned QA/QC Monitor will review the SAE reporting process to confirm reporting requirements are met.  
 7.5  Pregnanc y 
 Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless of age or disease state) of a female subject occurring while the subject is on study, or within [ADDRESS_1241180]’s last dose of study should be recorded as SAEs.  The patient is to be discontinued 
immediately (within 24 hours) from the study and the female subject should be referred to an 
obstetrician- gynecologist, preferably one experienced in reproductive toxicity for fur ther 
evaluation and counseling. 
 
Pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test must be reported to the Criterium Project Manager & Protocol PI  [INVESTIGATOR_887021] a completed Pregnancy Report Form 
via email.  Specifics will be outlined i n the SAE reporting guidelines.  
 
The Investigator will follow the female subject until completion of the pregnancy, and must 
document the outcome of the pregnancy (either normal or abnormal outcome) and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to the Criterium Project Manager and Protocol PI  [INVESTIGATOR_887022].  If the pregnancy results in the birth of a child, additional follow -up information may be requested.  If the pregnancy results in spontaneous abortion or 
stillbirth, the event should be reported as an SAE.  If there are any abnormal outcomes that meet 
the serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE.   
 
Pregnancy outcomes must be collected for the female partners of any males who took study drug 
in this study. Consent to report information regarding these pregnancy outcomes should be 
obtained from the female partner. 
 7.6  Overdose  
 An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional ingestion or infusing of any dose of study 
treatment that exceeds the dose described in the protocol. Overdoses should be reported as a 
SAE using the SAE forms.  
 
7.7  FDA Expedited Reporting requirements for studies conducted under an IND:  
 
If an investigator deems that an event is a Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction 
(S[LOCATION_003]R),  de -identified supporting documentation defining the event and causality within [ADDRESS_1241181] Manager and Protocol PI.  
 The UACC study manager or designee will report all local and nonlocal events to the UACC IRB 
and DSMC.  It is the responsibility of UACC or designee to ensure that all participating sites are 
notified of the events and resulting action for events which may modify the risk of the protocol or 
which otherwise meet FDA requirements for expedited reporting.

 Follow -up visits/procedures will be conducted per schema in section 5 .   Data regarding further 
treatments and survival information will be captured for this study every 6 months until the final

 8.5 Early treatment termination  
 Subjects that terminate treatment early (for reasons other than disease progression or side 
effects) will have an end of treatment (time period i.e. within [ADDRESS_1241184] 
treatment). Subjects will the n follow  up with their treating physician per their standard of care.  
 
 
8.[ADDRESS_1241185] 1.1 guidelines ( Eisenhauer, 2009) will be used to determine response and 
progression.  
 
Patients with measurable or non-measurable ( evaluable) disease (according to RECIST 1.1) will 
be evaluated for response or progression. For the purposes of this study, patients will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_566171] 12 weeks ± 7 days . Whenever possible imaging  is done after every 
4 cycles prior to their next cycle of treatment (12 weeks ± 7 days)  however if there are any delays 
in treatment, the imaging should follow [ADDRESS_1241186] imaging schedule.   At baseline, tumor 
lesions/lymph nodes/bone lesions  will be categorized as measurable or non- measurable based 
on the definitions provided below.  
 
33 
Palbo T- DM1  - Protocol Version 5 & Date 01/25 /[ADDRESS_1241187] 1 dimension (longest diameter in the plane of measurement is to 
be recorded) with a minimum size of [ADDRESS_1241188] scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 
5 mm); when CT scans have slice thickness > [ADDRESS_1241189] be ≥ [ADDRESS_1241190] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be ≤ 5 mm).Only 
the short axis will be measured and followed at baseline and in follow -up (Schwartz, 2009).  
 
9.2 Non-Measurable Disease  
 All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm, or pathological lymph nodes 
≥ 10 mm and < 15 mm on the short axis) as well as truly non- measurable lesions, are considered 
non-measurable disease. Lesions considered truly non- measurable include ascites, pleural or 
pericardial effusion, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, or abdominal masses/ abdominal organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_117145] (PE) that is not measurable by [CONTACT_428914].  
 Bone lesions: Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue 
components, that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_12783] -sectional imaging techniques such as CT scan or  
MRI can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurable disease. Blastic bone lesions are considered nonmeasurable disease.  
 Cystic lesions: Lesions that meet the criteria to be radiographically defined as simple cysts  should 
not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) because they 
are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts. Cystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases can be  
considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurable disease. However, if 
non-cystic lesions are present in the same subject, these are preferred for selection as target 
lesions.  
 Lesions with prior local treatment: Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an 
area subjected to other loco- regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless  there 
has been demonstrated progression in the lesion. 
 
9.[ADDRESS_1241191] always be done 
rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but is/are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
 Clinical lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial  and 
are ≥ 10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules). When lesions can be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_51752], imaging evaluation must be undertaken, because it is more objective and may also be reviewed at the end of the study. 
 
34 
Palbo T- DM1  - Protocol Version 5 & Date 01/25 /[ADDRESS_1241192], MRI:  CT is the best currently -available and reproducible method for measuring lesions 
selected for response assessment. If a slice thickness > [ADDRESS_1241193] diameter for a target lesion will be twice the slice thickness .  
 Tumor markers: Tumor markers may be obtained per institutional guidelines; however, tumor 
markers cannot be used to assess objective tumor response or PD. Details on tumor markers will be captured in the database.  
 Cytology and histology: These techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in 
rare cases when the nature of a residual lesion is in question. The cytological confirmation of the 
neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment can be considered if the measurable tumor has met the criteria for response or stable disease (SD) in order to  
differentiate between response (or SD) and PD.  
 
9.4 Baseline Documentation of “Target” and Non- Target” lesions  
 To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate the overall tumor 
burden at baseline and use this estimate as a comparator for subsequent measurements.  
 
Any single lesion that meets the definition of measureable disease (Section 9. 1) may be identified 
as a “Target Lesion” and will be recorded and measured at baseline. When > 1 measurable lesion is present at baseline, all lesions up to a maximum of 5 total (and a maximum of 2 lesions per 
organ) that are representative of all involved organs will be identified as target lesions and w ill be 
recorded and measured at baseline. This means that in instances  where patients have only 1 or 
2 organ sites involved, a maximum of 2 and 4 lesions, respectively, will be recorded. Target lesions will be selected by [CONTACT_48995] (based on their longest diameter) and whether they lend 
themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. Occasionally, the largest lesion does not 
lend itself to reproducible measurement; in this circumstance, the next -largest lesion that can be 
measured reproducibly will be selected. Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or 
in an area subjected to other loco- regional therapy, are usually not considered measureable 
unless there has been demonstrated progression in the lesion.  
 
Pathological nodes that are defined as measurable may be identified as target lesions; however, only the short axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum. This means that when lymph 
nodes are included as target lesions, the sum of lesions may not be zero even if complete 
response criteria are met, because a normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis of < 10 
mm. For PR, SD, and PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be included in the 
sum of target lesions. All other pathological nodes will be considered non- target lesions.  
 While on study, all lesions (nodal and non- nodal) recorded at baseline will have their actual 
measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (e.g., 2 mm). However, if the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly seen but is too small to measure with 
any accuracy, a default value of 5 mm will be assigned.  
 A sum of the diameters (longest diameter for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for 
all target lesions will be calculated and will be reported as the baseline sum of diameters. The 
baseline sum of diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor 
regression in the measurable dimension of the disease. 
 
35 
Palbo T- DM1  - Protocol Version 5 & Date 01/25 /2021  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological  lymph nodes will be identified as “non-
target lesions” and will also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and these 
lesions will be followed as present, absent, unequivocal progression, or new lesions.  
  
9.5 Evaluation of target lesions  
 
Definitions of the criteria used to determine objective tumor response for target lesions are seen 
in table 4:  
 
Table 4: Criteria Definitions for Objective Tumor Response for Target Lesions  
 
Tumor response  Criteria definition  
Complete Response  Disappearance of all target lesions. Any 
pathological lymph nodes (whether  
target or non -target) must have reduction in 
short axis to < [ADDRESS_1241194] a 30% decrease in the sum of 
diameters of target lesions, taking as  
reference the baseline sum diameters.  
Progressive Disease  At least a 20% increase in the sum of 
diameters of target lesions, taking as  
reference the smallest sum on study (this 
includes the baseline sum if that is the  
smallest on study). In addition to the relative 
increase of 20%, the sum must  
also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Note: The appearance  
of [ADDRESS_1241195] sum 
of diameters while on study.  
 
9.6 Evaluation of non- target lesions  
Definitions of the criteria used to determine the tumor response for the group of non- target lesions 
are in Table 5. While some non- target lesions may actually be measurable, they need not be 
measured and instead will be assessed only qualitatively at the time points of radiographic 
assessments.  Table 5:  Criteria Definitions for Objective Tumor Response for Non -Target  
Lesions (RECIST  1.1) 
  
Tumor response  Criteria definition

Palbo T- DM1  - Protocol Version 5 & Date 01/25 /[ADDRESS_1241196] be non -
pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis).  
Non-CR/Non -PD Persistence of 1 or more non -target  lesion(s) 
and/or maintenance of tumor  
marker level above the normal limits.  
Progressive Disease  Unequivocal progression of existing non -
target lesions. (Note: The appearance  
of 1 or more new lesions is also considered 
progression).  
 
Disease progression in subjects with only non- measurable disease  
 For subjects with only non- measurable disease, disease progression is defined as development 
of new lesions or “unequivocal progression” of existing lesions. Because worsening in non- target  
disease cannot be easily quantified (by [CONTACT_108]: if all lesions are truly non- measurable), a useful 
test that can be applied when assessing subjects for unequivocal progression is to consider  if the 
increase in overall disease burden, based on the change in non -measurable disease, is  
comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required to declare PD for measurable  
disease, i.e., an increase in tumor burden representing an additional 73% increase in ‘volume’  
(which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in a measurable lesion). If ‘unequivocal  
progression’ is seen, the subject should be considered to have had overall PD at that point.  
 New lesions  
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; however, the finding of 
a new lesion should be unequivocal, i.e., not attributable to differences in scanning technique,  
change in imaging modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (eg,  some 
‘new’ bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre -existing lesions).  A lesion identified on a 
follow -up study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at  baseline is considered a new 
lesion and will indicate disease progression. If a new lesion is equivocal (eg, because of small size), continued therapy and follow -up 
evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans confirm there is definitely  
a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan.  
 9.[ADDRESS_1241197] response recorded from the start of the randomization until  
disease progression/recurrence per RECIST, taking as reference for PD the smallest  
measurements recorded since the treatment started. The patient’s best response assignment wi ll 
depend on the achievement of both measurement and RECIST criteria.  
 
Table 6 provides overall responses for all possible combinations of tumor responses in target and non-target lesions with and without the appearance of new lesions.

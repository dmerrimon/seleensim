Protocol Date:  2018- 10-01 1.0 Introduction 
 Severe sepsis is a life -threatening syndrome that affects more than 750,000 patients in 
the U.S. and is a leading cause of death worldw ide, with a case fatality rate as high as 30% -50% 
in developed countries.1, 2 Acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]  (ARF)  is a dominant determinant of 
outcomes for many with severe sepsis; over 70% of patients with severe sepsis, in fact, require 
mechanical ventilation (MV).[ADDRESS_943608] of these patients are formally diagnosed with a cute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS ) or  acute lung injury (ALI), whereas all of them have 
severe hypoxemic/gas exchange abnormalities.[ADDRESS_943609] for years after recovery of lung function.1, 2, 5-9 These adverse long-term 
outcomes, which levy significant costs to patients and society,5-9  are usually preceded by [CONTACT_695550] (ABI), manifested as delirium and coma, which occurs in 50% -70% of MV septic 
patients.10-[ADDRESS_943610] been only marginal improvements in survival; the dearth of promising new therapeutics for 
the near future is marked by [CONTACT_695551][INVESTIGATOR_695487] - and long- term outcomes.
14-23  Sedatives, for example, are nearly universally 
given to sept ic mechanically ventilated  patients. We now know that sedatives contribute to 
iatrogenic injury, prolonging ventilator time and inciting acute brain injury.12, 24-27  Compelling 
data now indicate that minimizing28-30 or altering patients’ exposure to specific sedative agents 
may be a new avenue for improving outcome s in severe sepsis with respi[INVESTIGATOR_695488].31-[ADDRESS_943611].54  In small clinical studies55, 56 and preclinical work,45 
dexmedetomidine appears to offer superior anti -inflammatory effects compared with 
GABAergic agents, including propofol.  Dexmedetomidine improves bacterial clearance, 
whereas propofol reduces it ;[ADDRESS_943612] of sepsis that is likely critical to the 
development of brain dysfunction in these vulnerable patients.34, 59, 60  Sedation with 
dexmedetomidine instead of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_695489] 2 0%-30%35, 36 and improves 
arousability,50 facilitating “wake -up” strategies.[ADDRESS_943613]—more akin to natural sleep —which may improve autonomic function, immunity, and 
insulin resistance. These factors converge to suggest that sedation with an alpha [ADDRESS_943614], rather 
than a GABAergic agent, may improve outcomes for septic mechanically ven tilated  patients, 
including brain function and survival.  We , therefore, propose to study the effects of 
sedatives —the alpha [ADDRESS_943615] dexmedetomidine and the GABAergic propofol —in severely 
septic patients with acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_695490] a multicenter randomized, double -blind, 
trial.   In this study, we plan to consent approximately 5 80 adult me dical or surgical intensive

Protocol Date:  2018- 10-01 care unit ( ICU) patients  with severe sepsis and on  MV.  Although, the study participants will 
span the adult age spectrum, we anticipate the majority of them will be elderly based on our 
ongoing BRAIN -ICU cohort demographics and those of the participating sites as well as  the 
fact that nearly two thirds  of all ICU admissions are >65 years old.64, 65   
Specific Aims  
Aim 1 : To determine whether sedation of mechanically ventilated severely septic patients with an alpha
[ADDRESS_943616] ( dexmedetomidine) rather than a GABAergic agent (propofol)  will 
(Aim 1A)  increase days alive without delirium or coma (delirium/coma -free days) and 
(Aim 1B) increase ventilator -free days.  
Aim 2 : To determine whether sedation of mechanically ventilated severely septic patients with 
an alpha [ADDRESS_943617] (dexmedetomidine) rather than a GABAergic agent (propofol)  will 
(Aim 2A)  improve 90 -day survival  and (Aim 2B)  decrease incidence and severity of 
long-term cognitive impairment.  
Aim 3 : To determine whether  sedation of mechanically  ventilated severely septic patients with 
an alpha [ADDRESS_943618] (dexmedetomidine) rather than a GABAergic agent (propofol)  will 
reduce pro- and anti -inflammatory cytokines (CRP, interleukin -1 [IL -1], IL -6, IL -10, 
sTNFR1, HMGB1) . 
 To test the hypothesis , we plan to randomize mechanically  ventilated , severely septic 
patients requiring sedation to targeted sedation with dexmedetomidine or propofol.  To reach 
this goal, w e plan to enroll and randomize [ADDRESS_943619] a difference of 1.5 delirium/coma -free days 
between the two groups and an absolute difference in mortali ty of 10%. Patients will be assessed 
daily for delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM -ICU);

 2.0 Background  
 “Septic shock is the rude unhinging of the machinery of life.” (Samuel Gross, 1862)  
 “For many aging people in good physical condition who succumb to an acute illness [e.g., sepsis, ARDS] cognitive decline [e.g., delirium followed by [CONTACT_695552] -ICU long -
term cognitive impairment] is the main threat to their ability to recover and en joy their 
favorite activities; for those whose physical activities were already limited, cognitive 
decline is a major additional threat to quality of life.”  National Research Council

sepsis with  ALI, ARDS  or ARF due to gas exchange abnormalities, and up to 50 -80% of these 
MV pa tients have acute brain dysfunction, manifesting as delirium and /or coma) .10-13, 60, 67, 68  
Although separate entities, sepsis and delirium  are closely linked in terms of pathophysiology 
and share many of the same inflammatory pathways and cellular interactions  resulting in  
widespread effects on other organs and tissues.60, 68-73 In the [LOCATION_002] , severe sepsis  alone 
accounts for an estimated 250,000 deaths,2 and exceeds the number of annual deaths from 
MENDS II Protocol Version: 1.12  Confidential  5 of 52 
Protocol Date:  2018- 10-01 myocardial infarctions, HIV/AIDS, breast cancer and asthma. Indeed, while mortality from 
severe sepsis is upwards of 30 -40% in developed countries,2, 74, [ADDRESS_943622] -elevation myocardial infarction is much less at 7% and on the 
decline.67 Furthermore, w ith the aging population, the number of cases  of severe sepsis is 
expected to increase by 50% by 2030 unless new therapeutic options are discovered.2 While the 
incidence and mortality associated w ith severe sepsis is staggering,  and sepsis results in 
longer times on MV and in ICUs, a major but often missed cause of increased morbidity in 
ventilated septic patients is delirium , and its complications .69-71, 76  
2.2 Delirium in ventilated sep tic patients is associated with mortality and poor 
cognitive function and functional status.  Delirium occurs in 50- 80% of MV  patients10-13 and 
carries enormous financi al77 and societal burdens due to its association with increased 
mortality ,37, 38, 78 prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] s,79 and its relationship to long -term 
neuropsychological deficits.80-82  Each additional day of delirium independently increas es risk 
of death by 10% ,37, 38 strongly supporting  Aim  1 of this MENDS II  study , aimed at reducing 
duration of delirium in patients with ARF and sepsis. It is estimated that ICU delirium is 
associated with $4-$[ADDRESS_943623] workdays, 
caregiver burden, or cognitive rehabilitation for the 50-66% of patients with dementia -like 
deficits years later8, 9, 80, 82-84 (supporting Aim 2 of MENDS II  aimed at reducing incidence 
of lon g-term brain dysfunction). Sepsis , too, has been shown to independently and 
significantly alter the trajectory of cognitive impairment with almost a [ADDRESS_943624] cases.14, 15   
Apart from these, key elements in the management  of severe sepsis remain  supportive  (e.g., 
goal-directed resuscitation , ventilation management , glucose  control , etc.).85-[ADDRESS_943625] traditionally been compared using surrogate markers such as time on the 
ventilator and ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577], our team has found that commonl y prescribed 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_695491],  such as lorazepam  and midazolam,  are independent (and 
iatrogenic) risk factor s for daily development  of delirium ( see section 3.0)  in three  separate 
cohorts .[ADDRESS_943626] common elements  with pathways involved in sepsis.60, 68

Protocol Date:  2018- 10-01 2.4 Sedative  medications  can dysregulate the body’s natural control of inflammation .  
To understand how sedation may play a role in dysregulating the body’s natural response to 
inflammation, w e need to first succinctly review the inflammatory response to infection. Sepsis 
is the systemic inflammatory response to infection and is characterized by [CONTACT_695553], a pathological state that causes tissue injury and consequentl y organ 
dysfunction and death.
60, [ADDRESS_943627] ion of pro -
inflammatory cytokines  such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukins (IL) such as IL -1, 
IL-6 etc., and late mediators such as high -mobility group protein B1 ( HMGB1), which 
perpetuate inflammatory response and lead to organ dysfunctions.  60   Anti -inflammatory  
cytokines such as soluble TNF receptor -1 (sTNFR -1), IL -1ra, IL-10 are released in an attempt 
to attenuate the pro -inflammatory response and reduce organ damage; f ailure or dysregulation 
of this compensatory anti -inflammatory response syndrome  (CARS)  further w orsens 
outcomes.60  The b rain, too, responds to systemic infections and injury with an inflammatory 
response of its own that includes the production of cytokines, cell infiltration, and tissue 
damage.97, 98  This local inflammatory response is thought to alter patterns of neuronal activity 
resulting in delirium. In addition to the inflammatory responses described above, the 
parasympathetic (cholinergic) anti -inflammatory pathway plays an important role in attenuation 
of pro -inflammatory cytokines from macrophages, without any effects on anti- inflammatory 
cytokines such as IL -10.99, 100   The body generally regulates  this balance between the pro 
and anti -inflammatory cytokin es; unfortunately , comm only prescribed GABAergic 
sedative agents have immunomodulatory properties that may alter this balance and 
contribu te to worse outcomes .

Protocol Date:  2018- 10-[ADDRESS_943630] profile. A comparison of these specific p roperties is 
provided below . 
[1] Propofol  is a 2-[ADDRESS_943631] 
that inhibits the release of norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (NE),[ADDRESS_943632] lorazepam in the MENDS13 double -blind 
randomized  controlled  trial and was f ound to be superior in reducing the duration 
and prevalence of brain dysfunction,13 and further time on MV  and mortality in the 
septic subgroup, without any differences in hemodynamic profiles or adverse events.
36 The SEDCOM study,35 compared  dexmedetomidine with midazolam,  and 
found that dexmedetomidine patients spent fewer days on MV,  experienced less 
delirium, and developed less tachycardia and hypertension.  
[2] As mentioned earlier, the dysregulated production of pro- inflammatory cytokines60, 
68 is associated with worse outcomes in sepsis. The body itself attempts to reign this 
pro-inflammatory cytokine cascade by [CONTACT_695554] —(2.a)  the production of 
anti-inflammatory cytokin es,60 and (2.b)  the paras ympathetic (cholinergic) reflex 
that attenuates inflammation.99, 100  Propofol shows favorable properties of reducing 
the pro- inflammatory cytokines in animal mod els;106, [ADDRESS_943633] been contradictory with an increase in the pro -inflammatory cytokine 
production. Additionally propofol has not been shown to influence the parasympathetic reflex. Dexmedetomidine, on the other ha nd, has consistently 
attenuated pro -inflammatory cytokines in animal and human studies, with 
corresponding improvements in outcomes including survival . Its vagomimetic action 
may also play a role in potentiating the parasympathetic reflex.  
50 
[3] Propofol , similar to the data on the other GABAergics  (benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]) presented 
in section 2.5, impairs bacterial clearance from the lung and spleen in rabbits 
injected with Escherichia (E.) coli in vivo , and E. coli  and Staphylococcus aureus  in 
vitro ,49, 109 through inhibition both of myeloid (in particular neutrophil) and 
lymphoid cell function.49, 110, 111 Dexmedetomidine , on the other hand, does not 
suppress neutrophil function and helps bacterial clearance (see s ection 3.5)112 
[4] Propofol has not been associated with beneficial effects on apoptosis, while 
dexmedetomidine  inhibits neuronal apoptosis and apoptosis in other vital organs.34, 
59, 60 
[5] Both propofol and dexmedetomidine  have been associated with improving 
restorative sleep .  Endogenous sleep pathways mediate the hypnotic response of both 
classes of drugs,61, [ADDRESS_943634] —
more akin to natural sleep—which may improve  autonomic funct ion and immunity .

Figure 1. GABA -ergic agents and delirium  [6] As eluded in point [ 1], benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_695493], but data 
on propofol are inconclusive. Dexmedetomidine, however, has been shown to reduce 
duration and prevalence of brain dysfunction in two  randomized controlled trial s 
compared to benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651].13;35, 36 A comparative trial (the PRODEX study, Orion 
Pharma press release) in low severity illness patients,  with approximately  25% septic 
patients, has shown equipoise between the two agents  in delirium outcomes . 
Dexmedetomidine , however, has been shown to be superior to propofol with regards 
to its effect on maintenance of cognition,51 and improve ment of  attention as 
compared to benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651].33 
[7] GABAergic  agents may promote infect ion,49, 110 and the intralipid formulation of 
propofol may play a role in this. Dexmedetomidine , on the other hand, has been 
associated with lower secondary infections and mortality in septic patients when 
compared with a benzo diazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050].35, 36

side effects s een with dexmedetomidine include bradycardia (including a reported 
cardiac arrest in which dexmedetomidine was part of the multifactorial causes for the 
event) and hypotension, though in studies in critically ill patients, including septic 
patients, there has not been a reported increase in vasopressor use.35, [ADDRESS_943636] effective and safe manner.  T he 
MENDS II trial will address this need.  
 
3.0 Preliminary Studies  
 
3.1 Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_695494].  Of the three 
components of patient comfort (pain, anxiety, and 
delirium) included in current guidelines for use of sedatives and analgesics in ICU patients,

Fig 3.  Probability of transitioning to delirium  hypothesis  that sedative and analgesic medications are independent risk factors for the 
development of delirium aft er adjusting for releva nt covariates. Every unit dose  of lorazepam in 
the previous  24 hours was associated with increased probability of development of delirium 
[O.R. 1.2 (95% C.I. 1.1 to 1.4), p =0.003] (Fig 1) , whereas propofol were associated with higher 
but not statistically  significant odds ratios.27 Using a simila r methodology midazolam was also 
shown as a  risk factor for delirium in surgical, trauma and burn ICU patients.12, 95 These data 
support Aim1A of MENDS II (reducing delirium by [CONTACT_695556] 2 agonists instead of 
GABAergic agents).  Data on opi[INVESTIGATOR_695495], with opi[INVESTIGATOR_695496], but not in trauma and burn patients where pain is significant and adequate 
treatment may offer benefit.27  
3.2 Delirium and Long -term Cognitive Impairment. This cohort study82 enrolled 126 
adult ventilated medical ICU survivors and followed them for 12 months. Mu ltiple linear 
regression was used to analyze the association between deli rium duration and 12- month 
cognitive performance, ad justing for covariates. Follow -up 
data were obtained for 80% of survivors. Duration of delirium (Fig 2)  independently predicted worse cognition at 
3 months  (P=0.02) and 12 months (P=0.03).
82 These data 
demonstrate our coordinating center’s success in achieving high long- term follow -up rates and add 
support for the idea that  an intervention to reduce 
delirium duration might produce improvements in long -
term cognitive function, justifying Aim 2B (cognitive function) in MENDS II.

versus 17% dexmedetomidine). Patients on dexmedetomidine had a 60% lower risk of devel opi[INVESTIGATOR_695497] ( Fig 3 ) versus

were admitted with sepsis and 40 (21 dexmedetomidine; 19 lorazepam) without sepsis. 
Compared with septic patients who received lorazepam, the septic patients receiving 
dexmedetomidine had 3.2 more delirium/coma -free days (DCFD) on average (95% CI for 
difference, 1.1 to 4.9), and 6 (0.3, 11.1) more ventilator -free days (VFD). Th e 
beneficial effects of dexmedetomidine were more pronounced in septic patients than in non-septic patients for both DCFDs and 
VFDs ( supporting Aim 1B ) (P-value for 
interaction = 0.09 and 0.02 respectively). Additionally, sedation with dexmedetomidine, com pared with 
lorazepam, reduced the daily risk of delirium [OR, CI 0.3 (0.1, 0.7)] in both septic and non- septic patients. Risk of 
dying at 28 days was reduced by 70% [hazard ratio 0.3 (0.1, 0.9)] in dexmedetomidine patients with sepsis (Fig 4) as compared t o the lorazepam patients; this reduction in death was not seen in non- septic 
patients ( supporting Aim 2A of MENDS II ). 
 
3.5 Alpha 2 agonists improve survival in animal models with infections compared to 
GABAergic agents.  In order to confirm a survival benefit conferred by [CONTACT_56576] 2 adrenoceptor 
agonists over GABAergic agents , diazepam 
versus  clonidine and propofol versus  
dexmedetomidine (drugs with similar half -lives)  
were compared in two infection paradigms. In the  
prolonged infection model, adult C57BL/6 mice infected with 50HA of  X31 influenza (intranasal) 
were administered diazepam, clonidine or placebo, 4 hours after influenza infection. Seven days later, both groups of animals were super infected with D39 (serotype 2) Streptococcus pneumoniae infection (1 x 10
6 colony forming 
units ml-1 intranasal). Median survival time in the 
placebo group was 72 hours from the time of bacterial superinfection.  Clonidine increased median survival time compared to diazepam (84 versus 42 hours) and reduced the hazard ratio of death (HR 0.06 [0.01 – 0.32]; p = 0.0008) (Fig 5) .  
In the  acute infection model, adult C57BL/6 mice 
infected with 5 x 10
4 colony forming units ml-1 Streptococcus pneumoniae intranasal had a 19% 
survival (3 out of 16 mice). In this model comparison of dexmedetomidine (n = 15) with propofol (n = 16) treatment started four hours after infection revealed that dexmedetomidine increased survival compared to propofol (33% versus 0%; p = 0.02). Thus our clinical ( 3.4) Fig. 5  
MENDS II Protocol Version: 1.12  Confidential  11 of 52 
Protocol Date:  2018- 10-01 and preclinical work (3.5) are supportive of Aim 2B of MENDS II where we hypothesize 
that survival may be better with alpha2 agonists over GABAergic agents. 
 
4.0 Study Objectives and Endpoints  
 4.1 Study Objectives . The primary objective of the MENDS II  study is to determine the 
efficacy and safety of dexmedetomidine vs. propofol in mechanically ventilated medical and surgical patients with severe sepsis.  
 
4.2 Efficacy Endpoints  
 
4.2.1 Primary Endpoint.   The trial’s primary endpoint (Aim 1A) will be delirium/coma -
free days (DCFDs) , defined as number of days alive and free of delirium and coma during the 
14-day Treatment  Period (from randomization, which will be Study Day 1,  until Study Day 14 ). 
Patients will be evaluated for delirium by [CONTACT_695557] -ICU,10, 11a 
validated instrument for diagnosing delirium , even in non- verbal ventilated patients , that takes 
on an average [ADDRESS_943640] personnel  (Fig 6). 
Delirium assessments will be performed twice daily while in the ICU and then once daily until 
conclusion of the combi ned Treatment/ Post Study Drug Period  (see section  7.2), hospi[INVESTIGATOR_695498] (whichever is first) . Patients who are unresponsive to voice are categorized 
as comatose; those responsive to voice and CAM -ICU positive are categorized as delirious; 
those who are CAM -ICU negative are called normal. The DCFD continuous  variable represents 
duration of time a patient is alive an d free of brain dysfunction (delirium and coma) and has 
been used in other  high -impact studies.13, [ADDRESS_943641] 3 days, then has delirium ( or CAM -ICU positive) the next [ADDRESS_943642] 7 =[14- (3+4)] delirium/coma -
free days. On the other hand, suppose a patient is comatose the first 3 days, then has delirium (or CAM -ICU po sitive) the next [ADDRESS_943643] 0 delirium/coma -free days, 
since there were no days that the patient was alive and free of delirium or coma.  
The MENDS II study will have tremendous implications for practice, based on the 
outcome of DCFD  results, even if the secondary outcome of mortality is neutral, given ours and 
others’ recent data that every additional day of brain dysfunction is independently associated 
with higher mortality and cognitive impairment in survivors.37-39, 82  We will also assess 
delirium days in survivors and daily prevalence of delirium after randomization as additional 
brain injury outcomes. Delirium days was not chosen as a primary end point because delirium

Protocol Date:  2018- 10-01 days can be curtailed by [CONTACT_308756]; similarly delirium- free days was not used because delirium -free 
days fails to account for coma; thus patients could artificially be considered to have more 
delirium- free days (thus a good outcome) when in fact the reason they were delirium -free was 
because of coma (an untoward outcome). The analysis of DCFDs and other s econdary outcomes 
will be conducted using Intention -to-Treat (ITT) population , defined as all patients who were 
randomized to study drug. We chose a [ADDRESS_943644] balance of gaining valuable clinical information, while maximizing resource utilization, given the average study drug infusion to be 7 days and maximum duration to be 14 days. Thus our follow -up period will cover 7 additional days of delirium monitoring after the 
study drug is stopped in the majority of our patients.

[6] Acute Respi[INVESTIGATOR_39053]. We will monitor a patient’s oxygenation status by [CONTACT_695558]
2/FiO 2 ratios.119 A SaO 2/FiO 2 ratio <235 correlates to a 
PaO 2/FiO 2 ratio of < 200, which is the oxygenation threshold for ARDS.[ADDRESS_943645] ARDS. Time to onset of 
ARDS and duration of ARDS will be tracked until conclusion of the combined 
Treatment/ Post Study Drug Period, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] , or death (whichever happens

Protocol Date:  2018- 10-01 brady), acidosis, and weekly  for triglyceridemia and adrenal insufficiency. Patients will be 
monitored for withdrawal for [ADDRESS_943646] laboratory measures of blood counts and 
chemistries will be collected daily, when ordered as part of usual clinical care.   
 
5.0 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
 
5.1 Inclusion Criteria . Consecutive patients will be eligible for inclusion in the MENDS II 
study  if they are : [1] adult patients (≥18 years old) [2] in a medical or surgical ICU and [3] on 
MV, requiring sedation and [4] have a suspected or known infection.  
 
5.2 Exclusion Criteria . Patients will be excluded (i.e., not consented) for any of the 
following reasons:  
[1] Rapi[INVESTIGATOR_695499], indicated by [CONTACT_695559], at time of screening  for s tudy enrollment  
[2] Pregnant or breastfeeding  
[3] Severe dementia or neurodegenerative disease, defined as either cognitive 
impairment that makes the patient incapable of living independently at baseline or IQCODE > 4.5,
123 measured using a patient’s qualified surrogate. This exclusion also 
pertains to mental illnesses  requiring long -term institutionaliz ation, acquired or 
congenital mental retardation, severe neuromuscular disorders, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease , Alzheimer’s and debilitating cerebrovascular disease . It also 
excludes patients in coma or with severe cognitive deficits due to st ructural brain 
diseases such as stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, cranial trauma, malignancy, anoxic brain injury, or cerebral edema . 
[4] Present h istory of 2nd or 3rd degree heart block , or persistent bradycardia < 50 
beats/minute  that requires interventio n (e.g., atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050], glycopyrrolate). If patient has 
a pacemaker for bradyarrythmias, then patient does not  meet this exclusion criterion 
and may be enrolled.  
[5] Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_695500]’s decision to institute a specific treatment plan involving benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]  
(either as continuous infusions or intermittent intravenous boluses ) for this 
dependency.  
[6] Active seizures  during this ICU admission  being treated with intrave nous 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] . 
[7] Expected death within 24 hours of enrollment or lack of commitment to aggressive treatment by [CONTACT_695560] (e.g., likely to withdraw life support 
measures within 24 hrs of screening) . 
[8] Inability to understand Engl ish or deafness that will preclude delirium evaluation. 
The inability to understand English (for example in Spanish -only or Mandarin- only 
speaking patients) will not result in exclusion at center s where the research staff is 
proficient and/or translation s ervices are actively available in that particular 
language ; these patients will not be followed in the long -term follow -up phase of the 
trial since the testing materials are primarily available only in English. Patients with laryngectomies and those with hearing deficits are  eligible for enrollment if their 
medical condition permits them to communicate with research staff .    
MENDS II Protocol Version: 1.12  Confidential  14 of 52 
Protocol Date:  2018- 10-01 [9] Inability to obtain informed consent from the patient or an authorized representative 
within 48 hours of meeting all inclusion cr iteria for the following reasons:  
(a)  Patient and/or surrogate refusal  
(b)  Patient unable to consent and no surrogate available  in the 48 hour window  
(c)  48-hour period of eligibility was exceeded prior to screen   
[10] Prisoners.  
[11] Medical team following patient unwilling to use the sedation regimens.  
[12] Documented allergy to propofol or dexmedetomidine . 
[13] Current enrollment in a study that does not allow co- enrollment or that uses delirium 
as a primary outcome.  
[14]  Patients who are on mus cle relaxant infusions at time of screening with plans to 
maintain paralysis > 48 hours  
[15] Greater than 96 hours on mechanical ventilation prior to meeting all inclusion criteria .  
 
6.0 Enrollment/Randomization    
 6.1. Screening and Obtaining Informed Consent .  Study personnel at each site will screen  
the ICU census .  When an eligible patient is identified  (i.e., inclusion criteria are met and no 
exclusion criteria  are present) , informed consent will be pursued. Surrogate consent will be 
required for mo st patients because during the initial phase of their illness they will often be 
comatose, sedated, on MV , or delirious. A consent/re- consent process will be used (surrogate 
consent at enrollment and re -consenting patients when competent), in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_695501]/or ICU patients.
124, 125  All patients consented via 
surrogate will be re -consented for participation in the trial once competent.  
Once informed consent is obtained, if not already confirmed , patients will b e assessed for 
advanced heart block, pregnancy (female patients of childbearing potential  only) , and dementia  
via the IQCODE . When a patient’s telemetry strip is negative for advanced heart block , 
IQCODE <4.[ADDRESS_943647], 
they will be randomized and advanced to the Interventional  Trial Phase of the study (see section 
7.2 & 7.3).  At this time the patient is assigned via randomization to one of the two treatment groups: dexmedetomidine or propofol.   
Randomization will be conducted using computer -generated, randomly chosen permuted 
block sizes of 6 and 8, stratified by [CONTACT_695561] (<65 vs >  65 years) .  We will 
randomize patients in a 1:1 ratio  to sedation with dexmedetomidine or propofol . The 
randomization scheme will be created by [CONTACT_1758]’s primary biostatistician and distributed directly to each site’s investigational pharmacy as a set of randomization lists stratified by [CONTACT_91308] (<65 vs >  65 years).  Once a conse nted patient has entered the Interventional  
Trial Phase, an order for blinded study drug is placed, and the investigational pharmacist will refer to the appropriate randomization list (determined by [CONTACT_4676]’s age)  to establish that 
patient’s treatment assi gnment.  The lists will only be accessible to investigational pharmacists 
so that t reatment assignment will be known only by [CONTACT_695562] .  
 6.2 Blinding .  The challenge of blinding propofol, a milky fat emulsion, and 
dexmedetomidine, a clear aqueous solution, is evident.  Nevertheless, a part from investigational 
pharmacists, all study per sonnel, patients, and physicians  will attempt to remain blinded to each 
patient’s treatment assignment throughout enrollment, follow -up, and data analys is. Study drug 
MENDS II Protocol Version: 1.12  Confidential  15 of 52 
Protocol Date:  2018- 10-01 will, therefore , be administered via intravenous infusion covered by [CONTACT_695563] . Study personnel are prohibited from entering a patient’s 
room during infusion bag or tubing changes to fur ther reduce risk of unblinding of study 
personnel by [CONTACT_695564].  E nd-points such as ventilator -free days , mortality , and 
long-term cognitive impairment are unlikely to be influenced , should unbl inding be suspected. 
Instances of unblinding  are anticipat ed and when known will be recorded in the study database. 
If an adverse event is considered study -drug related, unexpected and serious, the study drug will 
be immediately discontinued and the event will be reviewed via the usual process, whic h may 
involve unbli nded evaluation by [CONTACT_941] D ata S afety Monitoring B oard (DSMB)  Chair , as outlined 
in the Data Safety Monitoring Plan (see sections 9.2 &9.3).  
 
7.0 Study Procedures  
 7.1 Enrollment .  After informed consent is obtained, on the day of enrollment baseline data 
will be collected and the following procedures conducted:  
 [1] As part of a P re-Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_695502] A ssessment a  dementia assessment  via surrogate 
interview  will ascertain  the patient’s physical and cognitive abilitie s prior to the 
current hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  Rather than relying on a “label” of dementia in the medical record, we will use the surrogate- completed IQCODE.
126-128  Any patient with  severe 
dementia , based on an IQCODE > 4.5,123 will be excluded from further participation 
in the study, as described in the exclusion criteria (see section 5.2).  The P re-
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] F unction A ssessment  form will ascertain additional import ant information 
about the patient’s  pre-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53753], including history of depression and 
chronic pain as well as provide information regarding tobacco, alcohol and illicit substance use  
[2] A pregnancy tes t (beta- hCG) will be done in all females of childbearing potential 
unless a pregnancy test (urine or serum hCG) has been performed during the current hospi[INVESTIGATOR_695503].  
[3] All patients will be assessed for advanced heart block  using  a bedside telemetry  
strip.  Advanced heart block will be defined as second or third degree block on telemetry  per the MENDS II study.  
 
7.2 In-Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_177023] .  The In-Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_695504] 
(Study Days 1 -14), during which time study drug will be infused per the study drug 
administration rules (see section 7.2.1)  and the Post -Study Drug period (2 calendar days after 
discontinuation of study drug). I n most instances ( when study drug is administered for < 12 
days), the Post -Study Drug Period will fall within the treatment period. When study  drug  is 
required for >[ADDRESS_943648] until  Study Day 16.  
 Once it has been confirmed that the patient qualifies for randomization [ e.g. patient’s 
telemetry strip is negative  for advanced heart block, female patients of childbearing potential  
have a negative pregnancy test  (either serum or urine) , and IQ CODE  is less than 4.5]  they will 
advance to the Interventional  Trial  and enter the In -Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_695505].   Upon entering 
the Interventional  Trial  Phase,  each patient will be assigned, via randomization, to one of the 
two treatment groups, and study drug will be delivered in a double -blind manner per titration 
rules as outlined in section 7.2.1 when in the ICU on mec hanical ventilation, and needing 
MENDS II Protocol Version: 1.12  Confidential  16 of 52 
Protocol Date:  2018- 10-01 sedation per the managing clinical team,  until study drug withdrawal, death, or for a maximum 
of 14 days —the Treatment Period — (whichever occurs first).   
  
 The following data will be collected during the In -Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_177023]:  
[1] On enrollment t he patient’s medical records  will be used to collect demographics, 
preexisting conditions, admission severity of illness and organ failure.  If obtained as 
part of routine medical care, results of additional test results will also be collected and may include hematologic laboratory values and blood chemistries, [e.g. WBC, HCT, potass ium, sodium, BUN, creatinine, albumin, bilirubin, SGOT (AST), SGPT 
(ALT), lactate, ammonia, troponin, and glucose ]. 
 [2] Throughout the study , data reflecting current severity of illness, recent and ongoing  
treatments (including medications and mechanical ventilator status), vital signs  
(including daily worst SaO
2/FiO 2 ratios) , routine lab results, tracking of sepsis and 
ventilator management, and complications  (e.g., infections and device removals ), 
will be collected from the  patient’s  medical records . These data will be generated 
as part of routine clinical care and will not require study -related tests.   
[3] A direct patient assessment  will occur twice daily while in the ICU and once a day 
when on the wards to determine level of sedation using the RASS129, 130, assess for 
pain using the Critical- Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT), assess for delirium 
using the CAM -ICU, and assess for diaphoresis.10, 11, 131 
[4] A bedside checklist  will be used to collect data regarding adherence to the 
nonpharmacologic ABCDE protocol ( see section 7.2.2), which includes standardized 
components of ventilator weaning, sedation, and delirium management. Components 
of the ABCDE protocol will be document ed as complete or incomplete on a daily 
basis by [CONTACT_695565]/or study personnel  after they are implemented . 
[5] Co-administered psychoactive medications , including sedatives, analgesics, and 
antipsychotics, will be tracked daily in the study.  
[6] Blood s pecimens will be collected as outlined in section 7.2.3 on all consented 
patients.  
[7] Assessment for Catatonia: At select participating sites and in a convenience sample, patients will be screened up to twice daily while in the ICU and up to once 
daily when on the wards with the Bush Francis C atatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS), a 
bedside clinical tool used widely in psychiatric consultations to diagnose catatonia, 
and for motor symptoms with the Delirium Motor Subtype Scale (DMSS).  Together these assessments will take [ADDRESS_943649] time evaluate the prevalence of catatonia in critically ill patients, and prospectively explore the extent to which an overlap syndrome exists between delirium and  catatonia.  For those patients who receive  a catatonia assessment  - a 
telephone assessment identical to the 6 month neuropsychological battery will also be conducted 12 months after randomization.  These patients will also receive a 
depression inventory (B DI-II) and  a PTSD screening tool ( PCL-5) at both 6 and 12 
months. 
[8] At select participating sites, and in a convenience sample of patients, we will connect patients to the noninvasive Root
® patient monitoring and connectivity 
platform by [CONTACT_695566] 7 days. This enables the monitoring of several physiologic parameters, including electroencephalography (EEG), cerebral oximetry, 
MENDS II Protocol Version: 1.12  Confidential  17 of 52 
Protocol Date:  2018- 10-01 and capnography with one portable monitoring platform. W e will monitor the raw  
(EEG ) and spectral analysis patterns of patients randomized to dexmedetomidine and 
propofol, using  the portable SedLine Sedation Monitor through the Root® platform .  
The SedLine Sedation Monitor is a patient -connected, 4- channel process ed EEG 
monitor. It displays electrode status, EEG waveforms, Density Spectral Array 
(DSA), and Patient State Index (PSI).  It is intended to monitor the state of the brain 
by [CONTACT_5203] -time data acquisition and processing of EEG.  We will use the Masimo 
Rainbow SET® through the Root® platform to continuously measure additional 
blood constituents and physiologic parameter like the Oxygen Saturation (SpO 2) and 
the non invasive hemoglobin (Sphb). We will use the O3regional oximetry that uses near-infrared spect roscopy (NIRS) to continuously  measure cerebral tissue oxygen 
saturation(rSO2) on the Root
® platform. Finally, the Root® platform will allow the 
ISATM   CO2 module for capnography monitoring, end- tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) 
waveform   and measurements and trend of EtCO2, fractional concentration of 
inspi[INVESTIGATOR_695506]2 (FiCO2), and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (RR). The research team and 
medical team will be blinded to the raw EEG and spectral analysis  cerebral 
oximetry, and all other monitoring parameters  which will be downloaded directly 
from the monitor to a US B port and then stored in the database. These evaluations 
will for the first time evaluate the EEG patterns and spectral analysis of critically ill 
septic patients on dexmedetomidine and propofol and provide insi ghts into its 
relationship with sleep , delirium, coma, and long -term cognitive outcomes .  
 
7.2.[ADDRESS_943650] at each site will prepare and deliver study drug to the bedside nurse according to orders placed by [CONTACT_695567].  Study drug will be titrated by [CONTACT_3433] e bedside nurse in accordance with the 
weight -based titration table (Table 2) . 
[1]       Route and Concentration.  All study drug will be administered intravenously 
(IV) by [CONTACT_695568] 10 mg/mL propofol  or 5 mcg/mL 
dexmedetomidine.  Patients will only receive study drug while in the ICU  and on mechanical 
ventilation, and thus will be monitored with continuous telemetry as per usual ICU practice.  
[2] Dosing Range .  Study drug dose will be titrated in a double -blind manner 
according to clinical effect to achieve a “goal” or “target” Richmond Agitation -Sedation Score 
(Table 3) set by [CONTACT_695569] (see Titration  section below).  For sites that do not 
utilize the RASS scale, the VCC will provide titration instructions using their local sedation -
agitation scale.  For patients in the propofol group, dose will range from 5- 50 mcg/kg/min.  For 
patients in the dexmedetomidine group, dose will range from 0.15- 1.5 mcg/kg/hr .  For example, 
a 70 kg patient  would receive 10.5 mL of study drug per hour, which would provide either 25 
mcg/kg/min of propofol or 0.75 mcg/kg/hr of dexmedetomidine. These dose ranges have been selected after literature review and discussions with critical care practitioners, investigational 
pharmacists, and the MENDS II study steering committee.  
13, 35, 40, 132 Patient doses will be 
calculated based on each patient's enrollment weight, with no cap to the maximum 
weight.   Table 2 includes the infusion rates for patients weighing 40- 140kg; an additional 
titration table for patients >140 kg is available to sites from the VCC.  
MENDS II Protocol Version: 1.12  Confidential  18 of 52 
Protocol Date:  2018- 10-[ADDRESS_943651] ug concentration and weight -based titration table  for 40- 140kgs  
 
 
 
  
[3] Initiation .  No  bolus dose of study medication will be allowed.   Since most patients are 
already receiving sedation prior to enrollment this is often not required. The bedside nurse will 
initiate  this infusion based on patient weight in kg  starting at 5 -15 mcg/kg/min propofol and 
0.15- 0.45 mcg/kg/hr dexmedetomidine .  (see Table 2) starting at 5- 15 mcg/kg/min propofol and 
0.15- 0.45 mcg/kg/hr dexmedetomidine . 
[4] Titration .  Study drug dose will be titrated every 10 minutes by [CONTACT_695570]/hr according the weight -based titration table (see Table 2 ) to achieve th e RASS target  
(Table 3)  set by [CONTACT_695569].

MENDS II Protocol Version: 1.12  Confidential  19 of 52 
Protocol Date:  2018- 10-01 (a) Titrating Up ( undersedation: Patient RASS > Target RASS ). If a patient ’s 
RASS is 1 or more level s higher than the Target RASS (e.g. patient RASS +1 
& target RASS 0 or - 1), study drug volume will be increased according to 
weight -based titration table (see Table 2) every 10 minutes in increments of 5 
mcg/kg/min for propofol or 0.15 mcg/kg/hr for dexmede tomidine, until  the 
maximum dose is reached (1.5 m cg/kg/hr  dexmedetomidine or 50 
mcg/kg/min propofol) or the patient reaches the target RASS . 
(b) Titrating Down (oversedation: Patient RASS < Target RASS ).  If 
oversedated (i.e ., more than 1 RASS level deepe r than ICU team’s sedation 
target), study  drug  volume will be decreased every 30 minutes  per the 
weight -based titration table (see Table 2) in decrements of 5 mcg/kg/min for 
propofol or 0.15 mcg/kg/hr for dexmedetomidine until the patient is within [ADDRESS_943652] volume  (5 mcg/kg/min 
for propofol or 0.15 mcg/kg/) , and the patient remains oversedated  (i.e., more 
than 1 RASS level deeper than IC U team’s sedation target)  for >30 minutes . 
(c) Titrating  Study Drug during a Spontaneous Awakening Trial  (SAT) (see 
section 7.2.2) . Patients will be evaluated daily for readiness for a SAT  by 
[CONTACT_695571] a SAT  safety screen.  In patients  passing the 
safety screen, s tudy drug will be held  until  patients show signs of failing the 
SAT  indicating a need for sedation . Study drug that is held for the 
spontaneous awakening trial will be restarted, if need ed, to the lowest 
possible infusion rate that is needed to achieve target RASS (see section 7.2.2).  
(d) Restarting Study Drug  (with exception of restarting after SAT  as outlined in 
section 7.2.1[4] c above) .  Study drug will be discontinued if a patient is 
liberated from mechanical ventilation, o r if the managing clinical team 
determines the patient does not need ongoing sedation. If, however, at any 
time during the 14- day Treatment  Period  (startin g from enrollment day , 
which is Trial Day 1, through Trial D ay 14) a patient again requires sedative 
therapy  and is still on mechanical ventilation , the study drug will be restarted 
according to initiation rules (see Initiation section 7.2.1[ 3] above), as long as 
study drug was  not discontinued permanently for safety reasons (see 
Permanent Discontinuation section 7.2.1[6 ] below).  No study drug will be 
continued beyond Trial Day 14, irrespective of the duration of therapy within 
the 14-day Treatment Period .  
[5] Holding .  Throughout the treatment period , study drug may be temporarily held for 
the following reasons:  
(a)  Hypotension. If a patient’s systolic blood pressure is <80 mmHg and  if 
deemed necessary by [CONTACT_695569], study drug will be held until fluid and/or vasopressor/inotrope therapy can be initiated and systolic blood pressure has in creased to >80 mmHg.  Since this is a study in severely 
septic patients, hypotension may occur frequently and will be monitored as a safety outcome.   
(b)     New onset symptomatic bradycardia (< 50 beats/minute and systolic blood 
pressure <80 mm Hg) . Study drug  may be held if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_695572]: 1.12  Confidential  20 of 52 
Protocol Date:  2018- 10-01 managing clinical team until atropi[INVESTIGATOR_695507] >50 beats/min.  
(c).    Oversedation  despi[INVESTIGATOR_695508] . Study drug may be 
held if patient continues to be  oversedated  (i.e., more than 1 RASS level 
deeper than ICU team’s sedation target) , all other sedatives have been held 
and study has been titrated to lowest volume (5 mcg/kg/min for propofol or 0.15 mcg/kg/)  for >30 minutes , until patients RASS level is at target .  
(d) General anesthesia.  Study drug may be held if patient is receiving general 
anesthesia for a surgical operation.  Study drug may be held until the patient returns to the ICU setting and resumes sedation per ICU target sedation scale orders.   
[6] Permanent Discontinuation.  Study drug will be permanently discontinued at any time during the trial for any of the following safety reasons.  Management of these conditions is left to the discretion of the medical team.  
(a) Second epi[INVESTIGATOR_695509] (< 50 beats/minute  and systolic 
blood pressure <80 mm Hg) while on study drug.  As described above in 7.2.1[ 5]b, s tudy drug may be continued, titrated down or hel d during the first 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_695509], at the discretio n of the medical team. 
Medical team would manage the bradycardia and once it resolves, study drug should be restarted, if it had been stopped. Symptomatic bradycardia that reoccurs while back on study drug will result in permanent discontinuation.  
(b) New  onset  2nd or 3rd degree heart block . Degree of heart block should be 
confirmed with medical team or PI [INVESTIGATOR_695510].  
(c) Serious a llergic reactions  to study drug as determined by [CONTACT_695573] .  
(d) New onset coma due to a known structural brain disease  such as stroke, 
intracranial hemorrhage, cranial trauma, malignancy, anoxic brain injury, or cerebral edema.  
(e) Suspected Propofol Infusion Syndrome  (commonly presents as cardiac 
failure, rhabdomyoly sis, severe metabolic acidosis and renal failure) or 
acidosis that cannot be explained by [CONTACT_695574] . 
These are considered severe clin ical outcomes and tracked.  
(e) Any other study drug -related, life- threatening, serious adverse reaction s. 
(f) Withdrawal from study drug treatment  at the discretion of the principal 
investigator , the patient /family,  or the attending physician . 
In the event that study drug is permanently discontinued, the managing clinical team will be notified by [CONTACT_3462], and may then order sedative/analgesia management per standard ICU sedation protocol.  
7.2.2 Management Components .   
[1] Management of p ain, rescue sedation , and the chemically paralyzed patient .  
Patients will be monitored for pain using the Critical- Care Pain Observation Tool 
(CPOT), and intermittent boluses of 0.5- 1 mc g/kg of fentanyl  (or other standard of 
care opi[INVESTIGATOR_695511])  or continuous fentanyl infusions 
will be pe rmitted for analgesia as determined necessary by [CONTACT_695575]. In circumstances where sedation target is not met with maximum study drug 
infusion, additional intermittent opi[INVESTIGATOR_858] (IV opi[INVESTIGATOR_695512], morphine or 
MENDS II Protocol Version: 1.12  Confidential  21 of 52 
Protocol Date:  2018- 10-01 hydromorphone or po opi[INVESTIGATOR_858]) or continuous fentanyl may be used to help attain 
sedation target. Occasionally , despi[INVESTIGATOR_695513] (4-
5 mcg/kg/hr) continuous fentanyl, patients may still be undersedated; in these rare circumstances intermittent dos e midazolam will be permitted and tracked. In the rare 
instance, when sedation is required beyond the [ADDRESS_943653] -Study Drug Period (whichever is earlier) . Chemical 
paralysis is used in < 5% of patients in ICUs, and when needed, intermittent midazolam or continuous midazolam will be permitted and tracked, since dexmedetomidine  may not provide adequate amnesia. Study drug will be reduced to 
the lowest infusion rate for the patient’s weight according to the weight based titration table being used for the patient and maintained at this level during the time chemical paralysis is ongoing . Midazolam infusions that are started to provide 
amnesia during sustained chemical paralysis will be discontinued approximately one hour after discontinuation of chemical paralysis , while study drug will continue and 
management will be per titration rules . We expect our rescue protocol to minimize, 
and the randomization to balance the effects of  these medications.  Similarly 
intermittent midazolam or propofol will be permitted to provide amnesia when short -
term muscle relaxation is employed during procedures e.g. bronchosc opi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 
tracheostomies , etc.  
[2] Delirium  Protocol  (ABCDE Protocol) .
28, 133-136  During the Treatment Period , we 
will standardize  and/or track  components of ICU care that may influence delirium  
risk via an  evidence- based non- pharmacologic protocol  referred to as the ABCDE 
protocol . Study personnel will be well -trained with this protocol  during the MENDS 
II startup meeting and compliance will be emphasized  and tracked  throughout the 
study . Local ICU nursing staff at each study center will receive a standar dized 
educational packet  that focuses on delirium recognition, risk factors, and prevention. 
When knowledge gaps are identified or compliance drops below 80% , as measured 
by [CONTACT_695576], additional education will be provided. The ABCDE 
protocol has 3 components:  
(a)  ABCDE  (Awakening and B reathing C oordination) . Based on our  “Wake 
Up and Breathe”  protocol  proven to improve outcome s, including one -year 
survival ,28, 136 the ABC  component includes standardized SATs  (i.e., daily 
interruption of sedation) paired with spontaneous breathing trials  (SBTs) ,[ADDRESS_943654] possible infusion rate that is needed to achieve target RASS. All study 
centers use validated sedation scales to facilitate goal -directed sedation, a 
practice that will continue throughout the MENDS II study . Ventilator 
management will be standardized according to each institution’s approved protocols, including the use of low tidal volume ventilation for acute lung 
injury.
88 
(b)  AB CDE (Delirium monitoring and management) . The Delirium component 
of ABCDE will inclu de nonpharmacologic strategies, given that the majority of 
delirium in ICUs is the hypoactive subtype.138, [ADDRESS_943655] been shown to reduce delirium in non-
MENDS II Protocol Version: 1.12  Confidential  22 of 52 
Protocol Date:  2018- 10-01 ICU settings140-150  Study personnel will encourage members of the ICU team 
to perform the following tasks:  
• Reorient and cognitively stimulate  patients by [CONTACT_695577], date, 
place, and reason for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], updating whiteboards with caregiver 
names, requesting placement of a clock and calendar in the room, and 
discussing current events.140-143, 145, 146, 148, 151-153 
• Determine need for hearing aids and/or eye glasses  from the surrogate 
and request that the surrogate provi de these to the patient when 
appropriate.141-143, 145, 146, 148, 151, 152 
• Monitor and manage pain level  in all patients daily with the CPOT  or 
other assessments , in accordance with practice guidelines  and local I CU 
policies.93, 152, 154-157 
• Maintain sleep preservation using techniques  including noise reduction 
strategies (e.g., minimize noise outside the room, offer white noise or 
earplugs), normal izing  day-night variation in illumination, minimizing 
interruptions during normal sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_695514] “time out” strategy, maintaining ventilator synchrony, and promoting comfort and relaxation (e.g., back care, massa ge, oral care, washing face/hands, and daytime 
bath).
141, 143, 145, 146, 151, 158-163 
• Patients  with h yperactive (agitated) delirium (i.e. RASS +1 to +4 and 
CAM -ICU positive) will be permitted either per tube or intravenously  
haloperidol  starting between  0.5-5 mg . Patients with either an allergy to 
haloperidol or in patients where the treating clin ical team desires to use 
an oral atypi[INVESTIGATOR_67128], quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_695515] 
(prn) or scheduled with recommended starting doses of 25- 50 mg and 
titration per primary team.  All antipsychotic medication will be tracked in the database unt il the end of the combined Treatment/ Post Study Drug 
Period, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_449080]  (whichever is earlier) . 
(c)  ABCD E (Early mobility and E xercise) . The Exercise component of the 
ABCDE protocol will include strategies to promote mobility and exercise  in 
the earliest phases of critical illness.  Early physical/occupational therapy significantly reduced delirium duration for mechanically ventilated ICU patients in a recent randomized controlled trial.
133  Study personnel will 
encourage members of the ICU team, including the bedside nurses and  physical/occup ational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], to evaluate each patient’s readiness for 
mobility and exercise and coordinate the following activities: removal of restraints , active range of motion , sitting on the side of the bed, sitting in a 
chair, standing  in place,  and ambulation. 
133, 141, 145, 151-153, 164, 165 
(d) Barriers and Facilitators to the ABCDE bundle .  At sites  that would like to 
participate , critical care providers (i.e., nurses, respi[INVESTIGATOR_46175], 
pharmacists, physicians, occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]  [OT] , and/or physical 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]  [PT] ) will be asked to complete a voluntary electronic survey (i.e., 
the ABCDE Bundle Provider Survey) designed to identify barriers and facilitators to the use of the ABCDE bundle.  In addition, managers (e.g., nurse manager, respi[INVESTIGATOR_695516], and/or PT/OT manager) will be asked to provide details about key organizational structures and processe s that 
MENDS II Protocol Version: 1.12  Confidential  23 of 52 
Protocol Date:  2018- 10-01 may influence a provider’s ability to use the ABCDE bundle.  Lastly, units 
will be observed for accessibility of equipment useful for applying the ABCDE bundle and unit layout.  Both the manager evaluation and the unit 
observation will be accomplish ed utilizing the ABCDE Unit Observation and 
Manager Questionnaire . When barriers and facilitators are identified, this 
information will be provided to study personnel and/or managers at each site. 
 
[3] Sepsis and Mechanical Ventilation . Management of sepsi s and MV  will be 
directed by [CONTACT_695578].
15  The 
managing clinical team will dictate use of these guidelines according to patient need.  Study personnel will track important determinants of care including: choice of  
antibiotic, vasopressor and inotrope use, and blood glucose levels .
[ADDRESS_943656] ICU protocols for readiness 
for SATs, SBTs , and subsequently extubation.  
 
7.2.3 Monitoring .  The risks of propofol and dexmedetomidine include  oversedation, 
bradycardia, hypotension, acidosis, hypertriglyceridemia, hy perglycemia, adrenal insufficiency, 
and propofol infusion syndrome. Throughout the Interventional Trial Period, study personnel 
will carefully monitor all patients daily for evidence of these potential adverse effects, 
determine study drug efficacy and saf ety, and monitor other factors that may influence outcome.  
Should adverse effects occur, the above section (7.2.1) describes how study drug will be titrated, held , or permanently discontinued.  Additionally , patients will be monitored for two  full 
days fo llowing discontinuation of the study drug . This will be the Post -Study Drug Period and 
will be contained within the treatment period if study drug is discontinued prior to or on study day [ADDRESS_943657] -Study Drug Period will extend beyond the Treatment  period.  
[1] Efficacy .  In addition to delirium, coma , and ventilator -free days, t ime-to-event 
outcomes including ICU length of stay  and survival , will be assessed until the 
outcome in question or a censoring event occurs.  Twice daily , while in ICU and once 
thereafter until end of Post -Study Drug Period , hospi[INVESTIGATOR_449080] 
(whichever is first), study personnel will determine level of sedatio n using the 
RASS
129, 130 and assess for delirium using the CAM -ICU.10, 11, 131  
[2] Safety .  Patients will be monitored as part of routine ICU care  for adverse clinical 
outcomes  including but not limited to oversedation, bradycardia, hypotension, 
acidosis, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia, adrenal insufficiency, and propofol 
infusion syndrome .  Additionally, study personnel will specifically assess pa tients 
for the following safety outcomes : 
(a) Triglyceride s according to plasma level drawn on Trial Day s 7 (or earlier if 
planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_695517] 7)  and 14  (or earlier if planned 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_695517] 14) . 
(b) Cortisol  according to plasma level drawn on Trial Days 7(or earlier if 
planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_695517] 7) and 14  (or earlier if planned 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_695517] 14) .  
(c) Arrhythmia and/or Heart Block  according to telemetry or a12- Lead 
electrocard iogram while in the ICU until the end of the combined 
Treatment/ Post-Study Drug Period.  
MENDS II Protocol Version: 1.12  Confidential  24 of 52 
Protocol Date:  2018- 10-01 (d) Hyperactivity or agitation  according to daily RASS139 until the end of the 
combined Treatment/ Post-Study Drug Period  (see section 7.2.2 for rescue 
protocol) . 
(e) Development of new cases of ARDS based on criteria described in 4.2.2 until 
the end of the combined Treatment/ Post-Study Drug Period. All aspects of 
management of patient’s ARDS will be determined by [CONTACT_695579], 
including if deemed necessary, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_504490]. 
(f) Organ dysfunctions  will be tracked until conclusion of the combined 
Treatment/ Post-Study Drug Period using daily SOFA scores and continuous 
as well as established predefined cut offs for each organ failure : Kidney, Cr > 
2 mg/dL or urine < 400 cc/day; Lung, PaO 2/FiO 2 <300 or SaO 2/FiO 2 <315;119  
Liver, total bilirubin > 2 mg/dL; Coagulation, Platelet count < 100,000/mm3; 
and Hemodynamic, need for vasopressor,120, 121 consistent with definitions 
utilized in published studies of organ dysfunction in critically ill patients.122 
[3] Biological specimens .  Pla sma will be obtained on approximately Trial Days  1, 3, 5, 
7 and 14.  A  maximum of  30 mL of blood will be collected at each time point (150 
mL max during the study), processed , and stored at - 80º C prior to being shipped to 
the V anderbilt C oordinating C enter  biorepository  for storage and batched analyses of 
the following:  
(a) Genetic predictors of delirium duration , including , but not limited to , the 
apolipoprotein E4 polymorphism .166-168 
(b) Inflammatory/coagulopathic biomarkers , (e.g., IL -1, IL -6, IL -10, CRP, 
sTNFR1, and HMGB1) based on  their importance in sepsis and kinetic 
responses.169-171, 171, 172, 172, 173, 173, 174, 174-177  Furthermore , combination of 
pro- and anti -inflammatory  cytokine markers improves the  predictive quality 
of these biomarkers for mortality.178 
(c) Other biomarkers  to be determined by [CONTACT_695580].  
(d)  At select participating sites,  the Cholinesterase Activity and DeliriUm during 
Critical illness Study  (CADUCe uS) – a substudy within the MENDS II study 
will examine whole blood acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and 
butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) activities  as biomarkers for delirium during 
critical illness and for long -term cognitive impairment in survivors of critical 
illness. During the blood collection on study days 1, 3, 5, 7, & 14 AChE and 
BuChE activities in the collected blood will additionally be measured using ChE Check (LISA -CHE, Dr. F. Köhler Chemie [DFKC] Bensheim, 
[LOCATION_013]), a point -of-care device that reliably measures AChE and BuChE 
activities in whole blood within 4 minutes of specimen collection

[4] Delirium Experience and Baseline Chronic Pain Evaluation.
 After resolution of 
delirium and prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], patients will be asked to recall their memory 
and delirium experience using a modified Delirium Experience Questionnaire (DEQ) 
193. Additionally, patients will be asked about the presence of chronic pain prior to 
this hospi[INVESTIGATOR_695518]. 
 
[5] Other data .  The patient’s medical records  will be used during the In-Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_695519], recent and

Protocol Date:  2018- 10-01 ongoing treatments (including medications  and mechanical ventilator status), routine 
lab results, and complications  (e.g., infections and device removals) .  These data will 
be generated as part of routine care and will not require study -related tests.  
 
7.3 Long- term F ollow -up Phase .  We will evaluate long -term outcomes  among survivors 
(Aim 2B ), including  neuropsychological function and ADL/IADL s 6 months  after 
randomization.  Under the direction of the Vanderbilt Coordinating Center’s lead neuropsychologist, trained study personnel will assess patients using the following validated telephone assessments:  
[1] Delirium  will be evaluated  via the “phone” Confusion Assessment Method
179 
algorithm.  Patients diagnosed with delirium will not be assessed further at that time, but contact[CONTACT_695581]/when delirium resolves.  
[2] A neuropsychological phone battery
[ADDRESS_943658] cognitive tests and 
proven feasible  and valid  for phone use  in a study of  ICU survivors ( with similar 
characteristics to those targeted for enrollment in the MENDS II study ) will be used 
to assess memory, attention, re asoning, and executive functioning .  
[3] Activities of Daily Living (ADL)116 and Instrumental ADLs  (IADLs)117 
[4] Quality of Life  will be assessed using the EQ -5D, a short, easy to administer, well -
validated, and widely used instrument.180-182 
[5] Brief Pain Inventory Short Form ( BPI) [ADDRESS_943659] widely used measurement tools 
for assessing clinical pain  and consists of 9 questions, taking only a few minutes to 
complete . In addition to examining prevalence of chronic pain and chronic pain 
interference in ICU survivors, we will utilize the BPI [INVESTIGATOR_695520] (e.g., sedative and analgesic exposure in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) for chronic pain after critical illness.  
 
In addition to the battery described, data will be collected regarding intervening event s that 
happened since hospi[INVESTIGATOR_695521], but not limited to, death and re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. 
Vital status at 6 months after randomization and date of death (if applicable) will be determined 
via medical records or the Social Security Death Index  if not already known at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7954].

Study personnel  will be instructed to obtain as much contact [CONTACT_695582] (e.g. multiple phone numbers, mailing addresses, discharge destination , etc.) . The 
Neuropsychology Coordinator will perform the following interventions to maintain >85% Follow -Up assessment rates:  
[1] Following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] a letter will be sent to patients reminding them about the Follow -Up Period and introducing them to the  Follow -Up staff.  
[2] A periodic  phone call , letter , postcard, or email  will serve as an additional  reminder 
of study participation . 
MENDS II Protocol Version: 1.12  Confidential  26 of 52 
Protocol Date:  2018- 10-01 [3] Weekly  meetings will be conducted with study staff to evaluate the status of follow -

7.6 The Vanderbilt Coordinating Center (VCC) .  The VCC has extensive experience in 
the conduct of large, phase III clinical trials over the past decade .  The VCC will perform 
(among other functions) the following: communicate with the FDA using a schedule of 
reporting in accordance with IND policies, design the database and data collection tool , conduct 
startup meetings and site -training regarding protocol implementation  and delirium monitoring to 
standardize all research activities  during  the trial, monitor enrollment pace and quality to ensure 
patients meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria, maintain blinding, track adverse events and 
ensure safety reporting, ensure protocol compliance, store plasma, serum, and genetic samples for planned and future analyses, conduct follow -up phone testi ng of neuropsychological 
function and quality of life via neuropsychology technicians, and work with the study centers  
and local study personnel  using multiple proven patient retention techniques that have 
consistently achieved over 80%  follow -up during pr evious studies. 
 
 
8.0  Risks of Investigational Agents/Devices (side effects)  
 
8.1 Side Effects of Study Drug (Propofol and Dexmedetomidine).  The risks of the 
sedative medications include oversedation, hypotension, bradycardia, acidosis, triglyceridemia, 
propofol infusion syndrome , and adrenal insufficiency. S tudy personnel will carefully monitor 
all patients for evidence of potential adverse effects from the study drugs  until conclusion of the 
combined Treatment/ Post-Study Drug Period . These assessments a re described in section 7.2.3. 
Should any of these occur, adverse events will be reported to the coordinating center, with 
Adverse Events  reported within 24 hours (see section 9.0) . From an immediate clinical 
management perspective, section 7.2.[ADDRESS_943663] such catheters while in the ICU. Rarely th e AChE and BuChe

8.3 Risks from ECG and SedLine Sedation Monitoring . As mentioned above an ECG 
may be done to evaluate heart rhythms and heart block.  The ECG electrode pads may cause 
skin irritation.  While it is rare, ther e may also be l ocal allergic reactions and/or skin tears from 
the SedLine Sedation Monitor sensors. This study staff will monitor the skin condition daily 
when using the sensors.   
 
8.[ADDRESS_943665] of Study . The following are a 
highlighted “top ten” list of actions we have explicitly taken to minimize risk for the study 
population and to maximize the ultimate impact of this investigation on the field of medicine.187  
[1] Interventions included in the MENDS II study are supported by a well -grounded and 
clearly described rationale suggesting potential, though unproven, benefit for eligible 
patients.  
[2] All interventions are common and with established equipoise within the context of usual care and considered good or competent care in light of an absence of  clear 
proof in favor of one over the other.  
[3] Experts in the fields of critical care, neuropsychology, nursing, pharmacology, and clinical trial design have developed the interventions being studied.  
[4] The management of patients in both treatment groups will be guided by [CONTACT_695584], where appropriate, in clinical practice. This will also allow for the use of 
the “superior group” as a control in future trials.  
[5] The MENDS II protocol will adjust study drug dose to meet individual patient needs 
in the attempt to deliver safe and effective care to critically ill old and young er 
patients. This protocol is explicitly designed and drafted from landmark trials to meet p atients’ needs over time and provide individualized care.  
[6] The titration protocol for study drug and the management components for pain, 
rescue sedation, and  hyperactive delirium are designed to minimize risks in 
comparison to anticipated benefits.  
[7] Because most previous comparator trials of either dexmedetomidine or propofol 
versus benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_695524], no benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_695525], to safeguard patients from 
receiving sedative a gents whose use is on the decline.  
[8] An independent and qualified Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be established (see s ection 9.5.1, 9.5.2 and 9.5.3.)  to review the research protocol prior 
to the start of the study and conduct interim analyses f or safety and review data on 
serious adverse events as close to real -time as possible.  
[9] We will work very closely with the regulatory authorities including our IRB and the FDA to make certain that this proposal is safe and that they agree with our pla nned 
oversight and approach to due diligence in monitoring and reviewing all adverse events during the conduct of the trial. The FDA- IND f or this study  is #[ZIP_CODE]. 
[10] Rigorous monitoring and reporting of prospectively defined Adverse Events (AEs)  including Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) and unexpected problems (UPs) will be conducted as outlined in s ection 9.2 and 9.3, to 
comprehensively monitor safety during the trial.  
MENDS II Protocol Version: 1.12  Confidential  29 of 52 
Protocol Date:  2018- 10-01  
9.0 Reporting of Adverse Events or Unanticipated Problems involving Risk to 
Participants or Others  
 
A system has been established to report and track clinical outcomes, (AEs)  including S[LOCATION_003]Rs  
and UPs that increased risk .  Study personnel will monitor the safety of subjects and follow 
them until the event resolves or is explained.  9.1 Clinical Outcomes (not considered Adverse Events) .  In this study of critically ill 
patients who are at high risk for death or other adverse outcomes due to their underlying critical illness, clinical outcome s including death and organ dysfunction, will be systematically tracked 
(collected in the CRF) and will be included as part of the safety and efficacy analyses for this study. For the purposes of reporting, death and organ dysfunction will not be recorded a s 
adverse events unless the investigator believes the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_695585]  
(investigator’s discretion). This approach (considering death and organ dysfunction as outcomes 
rather than adverse events) is common in ICU trials because these outcomes occur commonly in 
the ICU and because it mandates that data regarding death , organ dysfunction, and expected 
safety outcomes  be tracked systematically for all pat ients and analyzed appropriately.  
All 
clinical outcomes (with the exception of death and duration of MV - see 9.1.1 and 9.1.2 below ) will 
be systemically tracked until conclusion of the combined Treatment/ Post-Study Drug Period , i.e., 
they will be tracked f rom randomization until Study Day 1 6 at a maximum , hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], or 
death, whichever comes earlier . Listed below are events that will be tracked as clinical outcomes 
and will not therefore be required to be reported as adverse events during this study (unless believed 
to be study -drug related and more severe or prolonged than expected given the underlying critical 
illness):   
[1] Death. All deaths occurring within the  Interventional Trial will be reported on the 
CRF in the death summary section. For de aths thought to be caused by [CONTACT_5349], 
an AE/S[LOCATION_003]R  will be reported along with the death summary  
[2] Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], including need for MV  (invasive or noninvasive) or epi[INVESTIGATOR_695526] . Duration of MV will be tracked for up to 28 days to evaluate VFDs  
[3] Circulatory  failure, including shock (whether requiring vasopressors or not) and 
cardiac arrhythmias, and hypo/ hypertension 
[4] Hepatic failure or injury leading to increased bilirubin, AST, or ALT  
[5] Renal failure or injury leading to a n increased creatinine or acute hemodialysis  
[6] Coagulation derangements (e.g., thrombocytopenia ) 
[7] Neuropsychological dysfunction that is believed to be newly acquired

9.2 Adverse Events (AEs), Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
(S[LOCATION_003]Rs) , and Unanticipated Problems (UPs)   
[1] Adverse Event (AE) is  defined as any untoward medical occurrence for a patient 
enrolled in the trial that is not tracked as a clinical outc ome (see s ection 9.1),  
regardless of whether the event is considered study drug- related or not. If a subject 
experiences an AE after informed consent is signed but before receiv ing study drug, 
the event will be reported as an “AE not study drug related.” Prior to enrollment, 
study site personnel will note the occurrence and nature of each subject’s medical condition(s). During the study, site personnel will note changes in these condition(s) and/or the occurrence and nature of any AEs. All AEs occurring after consent and until the end of combined Treatment/ Post-Study Drug Period, hospi [INVESTIGATOR_2345], or 
death  (whichever comes first)  will be recorded in the database. This period is the 
window of time during which study drug- related advers e reactions are expected 
based on the duration of the Treatment Period and the  Post -Study Drug Period.  An 
AE that later meets criteria for an UP or S[LOCATION_003]R between the start of study drug and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_695527]. If study drug is 
discontinued as a result of an AE, study personnel will document the circumstances leading to discontinuation of study drug. In cases where the investigator notes an unanticipated benefit to t he subject, study site personnel will enter “unanticipated 
benefit” with the actual event description (e.g., “unanticipated benefit -  sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_695528]”).   
  All AEs will be evaluated for the following three criteria: relatedness to study 
drug, expectedness, and seriousness.  An AE will be considered serious if it results in any of the criteria below (regardless of whether it is deemed study drug related) : 
(a) Life-threatening condition with immediate risk of death within the context of 
a patient’s event (i.e., a well -tolerated bradyarrhythmia is not an SAE, 
whereas the same rhythm resulting in cardiac arrest and CPR is an SAE)  
(b) Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
(c) Persistent or significant incapacitation or substantial dis ruption of the ability 
to conduct normal life func tions  
(d) Significant hazard, contraindication, or side effect according to the PI  
(e) Any breech in the confidentiality of patient’s data  
(f) Investigators will determine whether an AE is related to stu dy drug based on 
a temporal relationship to administration, as well as whether the event is unanticipated and unexplained given clinical course, previous conditions, and concomitant medications.  
[2] All AEs that are (1) suspected to be study drug related, (2) unexpected, and  (3) meet 
any of the following seriousness criteria must be reported as Suspected Unexpected 
Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) : 
MENDS II Protocol Version: 1.12  Confidential  31 of 52 
Protocol Date:  2018- 10-01 (a) Death  
(b) A life -threatening epi[INVESTIGATOR_695529] i mmediate intervention  
(c) An event resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_695530]  
(d) Events resulting in persistent or significant incapacitation or disability  
(e) An epi[INVESTIGATOR_548111]/or permanent 
impairment or damage  
[3] Unanticipated problems (UPs)  are defined as any incident, experience, or outcome 
that meets all of the following criteria:  unexpected , related or possibly related to 
participation in the research; and suggest that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm than was previously known or recognized. UPs may result in adverse events and they may not. Protocol noncompliance that results in harm to a patient would be both a UP and AE whereas protocol noncompliance that increased risk to a patient but did not result in harm would only be classified as a UP that increased risk.   
 
9.3 Communication and Reporting of Adverse Events  and Unexpected Problems with 
Coordinating Center and Regulatory Bodies. In order to ensure proper and timely reporting 
of all AEs and UPs , there will be a clear communication plan for all sites to follow. Sites will be 
responsible for reporting all AEs and UP s that increased risk to patients  to the VCC ; they will 
also follow their local IRB policies to determine when AEs and UPs  should be reported to the 
local IRB . The VCC will be responsible for reporting the events to the proper regulatory bodies 
(i.e., FDA, NIH, DSMB, and Coordinating Center IRB) in a timely manner and in 
communicating any responses from those bodies back to the sites. The  procedures for reporting 
the various events will be as follows:  
[1] S[LOCATION_003]Rs . In the event that a S[LOCATION_003]R occurs the study drug should be permanently 
discontinued immediately .  The event will be recorded in the patient’s study chart in 
the electronic database. All S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be reported to the VCC within 24 hours of 
occurrence by [CONTACT_65859]. As required , VCC will report the event within 48 hours 
to the DSMB Chair . The DSMB report will be due and sent to the Vanderbilt IRB 
and NIH within 7 days . When the DSMB Chair/DSMB  suspects an event is study -
drug related, they will have the opportunity to access unblinded data in order to conduct appropriate safety monitoring. There should be no need for the site investigators to be unblinded since the study drug should have been stopped at the time of event occurrence per titrating rules of the study protocol. The DSMB Cha ir 
will work in concert with the rest of the DSMB to determine if any necessary actions need to occur as result of the event in order to increase the safety of the protocol. If 
the Data Safety Monitor or the DSMB suspect an imbalance between the S[LOCATION_003]Rs in the study groups, they will have the right to convene a full DSMB meeting and have access to other supporting data to determine safety and ongoing conduct of the study, without having to wait for the set meetings annually  and N= 236 as discussed in 
9.5.3. 
[2] UPs. All suspected UPs that possibly increase the risk to patients will be recorded in 
the patient’s study chart in the electronic database, reported to the site IRB within 5 days of occurrence,  and reported to the VCC within 5 days of occurrence.  Any of 
these reports that the site IRB determines to meet the OHRP definition of UP and thus the requirement for reporting to the OHRP, will subsequently be reported by  
[CONTACT_695586]: 1.12  Confidential  32 of 52 
Protocol Date:  2018- 10-01 the VCC to the DSMB within 15 days of receipt of the site IRB notification and to 
the NIH  within 30 days of receipt  of the site IRB notification .  
[3] All remaining  AEs  (i.e., AEs that are not S[LOCATION_003]RS or UPs) will be recorded in the 
patient’s study chart in the electronic database and reported to the VCC within 5 
days of occurrence. As required , the VCC will provide a batched report of all study 
wide AEs annually to each regulatory body as part of the annual review process.  
9.4 Data Monitoring Plan . To ensure data is accurately and completely collected during 
the MENDS II study, the VCC will follow a specific Data Monitoring Plan modeled after the FDA’s guidelines for the monitoring of clinical investigations. Once each year, a VCC member will visit ea ch study site to assure that the facilities continue to be acceptable for the purpose of 
the study, the study protocol is being followed, changes to the protocol have been approved by [CONTACT_1036], and the site investigator is carrying out the agreed -upon activities and has not 
delegated them to other unspecified staff. Also, the monitor will review subject records to determine whether data collected is accurate, complete, and current. Per the FDA guidelines, the monitor will compare a representative numbe r of subject records and other supporting 
documents with the investigator’s reports. Specifically, site visits will include the following:  
[1] A Technical Review  will occur annually and will consist of a VCC research nurse 
examining the quality and accurac y of data, regulatory documents and drug 
accountability. Data quality and accuracy  will be reviewed through a CRF data and 
source document review. The monitor will randomly select three subjects (or 10% of the subjects enrolled since the last site visit, if more than 30 were enrolled in that time) to serve as a representative sample. Regulatory Document Review  will consist 
of a review of IRB approvals, informed consents, critical documents, and protocols/amendments.  
[2] A Scientific Review  will occur at th e discretion of the VCC as needed  and could 
consist of presentations by [CONTACT_695587], patient recruitment, and staff training, and quality control procedures. The site monitoring team will include a VCC research nurse as  well as the MENDS II Principal or Co -
Investigator (alternating).   
The s ite monitoring reports from these reviews will be submitted to the DSMB and other 
regulatory bodies (IRB, FDA and NIH) as requested and/or required. Data accuracy reports (including si te comparisons) as well as site monitoring updates will be presented to the VCC. 
This Monitoring Plan will serve as a method for identifying systematic problems and provide a means in which to institute resolution and follow -up and therefore increase data quality.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_943666] (DSMB)  
 
9.5.1 Membership . The DSMB will include 5 independent members (3 members will 
constitute a quorum) who are not study investigators and have no financial, scientific, or other 
conflict of interest with the trial; written documentation attesting to absence of conflict of interest will be required. P otential members will be chosen by [CONTACT_695588] [INVESTIGATOR_695531]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_695532]/representatives from the following fields as potential members of the DSMB: critical care medicine,  ethics , clinical trial methodology, and biostatistics . A 
chairperson will be selected  and will be responsible for overseeing meetings, developi[INVESTIGATOR_695533], and being the contact [CONTACT_100092]. 
 
MENDS II Protocol Version: 1.12  Confidential  33 of 52 
Protocol Date:  2018- 10-[ADDRESS_943667] recruitment begin. If, 
alternatively, modifications to the protocol or other study documents are needed, the DSMB will recommend such modifications and postpone its recommendation to begin recruitment. This initial meeting may occur via conference call or in person and will begin with an introduction by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_695534]- Investigator, then continue as a closed session, including 
only DSMB members and (if available) NHLBI program staff.  
 
9.5.3 Additional Meetings . The DSMB is responsible for identifying problems related to 
safety (including all AEs/S[LOCATION_003]Rs), requesting additional data relevant to safety (including all 
AEs/S[LOCATION_003]Rs), proposing analyses of safety endpoints as needed, and considering the rationale 
for continuation of the study in light of safety data, progress of randomization, retention, 
protocol adherence, and data management. After the initial meeting, the DSMB will meet at the 
end of each calendar year for annual safety reviews and  also at the specified interim analyses (at 
N=236, see section 11.4, for detailed description) . Reports of AEs and S[LOCATION_003]Rs for the interim 
look at the data will initially be provided to the DSMB in a blinded fashion (i.e., treatment 
group assignment will not be revealed), but the DSMB will retain the right to request an 
unblinded report. Only DSMB members will have access to unblinded data in order to preserve 
the integrity of data and minimize potential for bias while maintaining appropriate safety 
monitori ng. After each DSMB meeting, the chairperson will provide a written report to the 
VCC and the NHLBI program official. In addition, the VCC, in turn, will provide the reports to 
the Vanderbilt University IRB and to all sites for submission to their local IR Bs. 
 10.0 Study Withdrawal / Discontinuation.  Subjects may be withdrawn from study 
participation at the discretion of the investigator or if the patient/family or attending physician requests that the subject be withdrawn.  The reason and date of every wi thdrawal will be 
recorded.  
The Informed Consent Document will notify participants that their participation is 
voluntary, and they can tell the study staff at any time if they decide to stop participating. In 
addition, if they choose to withdraw their auth orization for study staff to access protected health 
information (PHI) in the medical record, they may do so by [CONTACT_188726] (the 
address is provided). If a participant chooses to no longer participate but does not notify study staff 
that they withdraw authorization for access to PHI, their medical record may be accessed to obtain 
outcomes and safety data. Follow -up will be performed for all discontinuations due to an SAE or 
other safety concern until resolution, until deemed chronic and stable, or as long as clinically 
appropriate. Data and specimen destruction will be over seen by [CONTACT_695589].   
 
11.0 Statistical Considerations  
 
11.1 Power analyses and sample size calculations for Aim 1A (DCFDs) . Based on the 
demographic data from our NIH -sponsored BRAIN -ICU cohort, we anticipate patients in the 
MENDS  II control group will have a mean±SD of 6.8±5.2 DCF Ds during the 14- day study 
period. The study has been repowered/resized due to concerns about the feasibility of 
completing study enrollment. With  approval from the DSMB, we will randomize at least 210 
MENDS II Protocol Version: 1.12  Confidential  34 of 52 
Protocol Date:  2018- 10-[ADDRESS_943668] 85% 
power to demonstrate a difference of 1.5 DCFDs between dexmedetomidine and propofol 
(primary outcome), which we believe has face validity as a clinically meaningful difference in 
the duration of acute br ain injury . Importantly, this sample size will also provide 80%  power 
to detect a 12% absolute improvement in 90 -day survival with dexmedetomidine , assuming 
the 90- day mortality  in patients receiving propofol to be 30% (which is conservative given the 
25% mortality at 28 days in the both the recent PROWESS -Shock control group and MENDS 
lorazepam group). The ability to detect a 12% improvement in 90- days mortality is also realistic 
given the  25% absolute reduction in mortality at [ADDRESS_943669] randomization. 
  
11.2 Power Analyses for Long- Term Cognitive Impairment (Aim 2B) . We expect to 
follow > 80% of survivors for evaluation of LTCI. Based on the expected mortality rates (see 
above), we expect an overall 25% m ortality across the two  groups and plan to test 252 
(=420x0 .75x0.80) patients for LTCI at [ADDRESS_943670] adequate—indeed abundant —ability to assess the independent 
effect of the intervention on cognitive impairment while controlling for confounders.  
 11.[ADDRESS_943671] (Wilcoxon rank -sum tests). 
For ICU LOS, and 90- day mortality, Kaplan -Meier curves and log -rank test will be used, while 
censoring patients at time of death. We will perform sensitivity analyses using multivariable regression to adjust for imbalances in baseline factors; linear regression will be used for DCFDs and Cox regression for time -to-event outcomes (ICU LOS, mortality). Proportionality 
assumptions for Cox regression will be assessed using partial re sidual plots. No adjustments 
will be made for multiple comparisons when examining secondary outcomes in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_695535]
188-[ADDRESS_943672] practice in analyzing multiple, prospectively 
defined outcomes i n a trial.  
 11.4 Interim Examination of Results by [CONTACT_32622] . In addition to the final analysis of 420 
randomized patients  who received study drug , we plan yearly safety reviews and t hen one 
interim analysis at 300 patients by [CONTACT_4318]. The yearly safety reviews will only review protocol compliance, collated adverse event reporting, selected outcomes (excluding the primary outcome) and quality control. At N= 236 patients (~ 118 patients per group), we will 
conduct data analysis for early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_695536]. U sing the O’Brien -Fleming method
191, 192 (adjusting for two  planned 
analyses at N=236 and 420) with a 2 -sided significance level at 5 %, t he study will be stopped 
early if test statistics reach a critical value (standardized Z score) of ± 2.76 (corresponding to p-
value of 0.006) at the interim analysis of 236 patients. Statistical significance at the final 
analysis will be referred by a critical level of 1.976 or 2- sided significance level of 0.044.  
 
11.5 Intention -to-Treat (ITT) Principle and Missing Data . For all primary analyses, we 
will employ intention -to-treat (ITT) ( see section 4. 2.1).  When data cannot be collected, we will

Protocol Date:  2018- 10-[ADDRESS_943673].  
 12.0 Privacy/Confidentiality Issues  
 
 At no time will we reveal subject identities in any manner, whether in presentation, 
description or publication of the research for scientific purposes.  All data obtained with subject 
or provider identifiers will be kept in locked file cabinets to ensure confidentiality, and all paper file contents will be shredded before disposal.  All subjects will be assigned a unique study number for use in the computer database, and all electronic data will be kept in password-protected computer files to ensure confid entiality.  All biological specimens (serum, plasma, 
and DNA samples), maintain for batched assay after trial completion, will be stored in a locked 
–80 °C freezer and labeled with date and study ID# only, without any patient identifiers.  These 
samples wi ll be accessible only to designated co -investigators.  Results of the specified 
laboratory tests will be maintained in a password -protected database to be accessed only by 
[CONTACT_695590] -investigators.  
 Most data will be collected from medical records or di rect assessments and entered 
directly into the study database via electronic case report forms (eCRFs). Paper CRFs will be 
used for baseline dementia, quality of life, and follow -up neuropsychological battery (some 
require copyrighted forms). Once collected on paper, data will be directly entered into the database. The study will utilize a centralized database located on Vanderbilt’s secure R EDCap 
database system.  
 Access to the database will be secured by [CONTACT_639368]:  First  the staff must 
acces s the trial based website and only then will they be able to access the link to the database 
via another password. Each study site will only have access to their local study patients’ data. 
Only the Coordinating Center will have access to all the patient d ata.   
 13.[ADDRESS_943674] -
protected web -based database.  
 13.2 Method for Indefinite Archival of Information .  Biological specimens will be stored 
for an indefinite period of time for use in future studies (as des cribed in the informed consent 
document).  Because genetic markers of risk for delirium and other study outcomes are not currently known, storage of specimens for later research use is required to advance this 
MENDS II Protocol Version: 1.12  Confidential  36 of 52 
Protocol Date:  2018- 10-01 knowledge of ICU delirium.  It is our hope tha t polymorphisms will eventually be identified that 
will help us better understand the pathogenesis of delirium and patients’ response (or lack 
thereof) to therapy.  When such information is available, it would be invaluable to have a bank of genetic samples available for testing that can be coupled with a comprehensive set of clinical data such as the database being co llected in this investigation.  
 
13.[ADDRESS_943675] 7 
years and recruit and randomize approximately 440 patients into the Interventional  Trial (i.e., 
clinical trial). We will begin with a 6 -month start -up, during which the VCC will continue to 
work diligently with each site through weekly calls, start -up meetings, and the ongoing 
processes with regulatory authorities (e.g., NIH, FDA, DSMB, and IRBs) to solidify infrastructure and begin enrollment. Recruitment will be completed over 60 -66 months with an 
additional 6 months of follow -up; each site is expected to consent and randomize approximately 
25 patients per year.  During recruitment and testing, VCC will diligently monitor data 
collection (see section 9.4),  conduct data cleaning, conference calls, in -person meetings with 
study personnel at all sites to ensure compliance , and overall efficiency of study 
implementation. We will also work regularly with our statisticians to execute the planned analyses. 
The final analyses will occur during the last [ADDRESS_943676].

Section C:  Background Information
     Cognitive impairment refers to when an individual struggles to learn, concentrate, remember , or make decisions. This can
be due to underlying neurological diseases (i.e. Alzheimer's disease, dementia, etc.), caused by [CONTACT_364727] (i.e. brain fog
experienced by [CONTACT_4113]-19 survivors) or physical trauma (i.e. concussion). Recent reports indicate that two out of three
Americans experience some amount of cognitive impairment in their lifetime.
There are a number of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_364724]. One of these is transcranial direct
current stimulation (tDCS), which delivers sustained direct current to to the head area via electrodes. A number of studies
have indicated that this form of therapy is safe and ef ficacious at inducing neuroplasticity and exciting neuronal activity .
These factors can help improve aspects of cognitive functioning such as working memory , learning, and task performance.
Thus we propose the use of tDCS (LIFT iD Neurostimulation, RPW Technology , LLC, NY , [LOCATION_003]) applied externally and
directed at the frontal lobes for a period of four weeks to address symptoms of cognitive impairment. Daily stimulation with
this device is intended to train the brain to maximize attention, focus, and alertness.
 
Section D:  Purpose and Objectives
     The purpose of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_364725] a wireless, transcranial
direct current stimulation for people with cognitive impairments. Sample size (n=10) is convenient and designed to explore
acceptability and feasibility . Participants who are enrolled will be provided a tDSC device to use for a period of four weeks.
They will have two study visits, baseline (BL) and the 4th week visit (V1). During each visit participants will answer various
questionnaires to assess patient-reported outcomes such as sleep quality , cognitive impairment, depression, anxiety ,
fatigue, and user acceptability .

Section F:  Design/Procedure
F1.  Design
Select one category that most adequately describes your research:
     c) Pi[INVESTIGATOR_53761]: probability of group assignment, potential for subject
to be randomized to placebo group, use of control subjects, etc.
     We will prospectively recruit 10 subjects with cognitive issues such as poor working memory , brain fog, or impairments due
to dementia, Alzheimer's, or concussions. This will be a single-arm study , providing all recruited subjects with the tDCS
treatment. All subjects will be followed and monitored for up to 4-weeks.
The patients will have two study visits where we will assess patient-reported outcomes through validated questionnaires.
These include: instrumental activity of daily living scale (IADL), daily living independence (KA TZ), depression (CES-D),
fatigue (F ACIT), cognitive assessment (MOCA), pain and mobility , global health (PROMIS), sleep (PSQI), frailty (TSFI,
FRIED FRAIL TY), anxiety (BAI), multi-dimensional assessment of fatigue (MAF), community engagement (Life-Space),
and user acceptability (T AM).
Inclusion Criteria:
     Adults (aged 18+) suf fering from poor working memory , brain fog, or cognitive impairments (such as dementia, Alzheimer's,
concussions, etc); ability to attend to the clinic for visits
Exclusion Criteria:
     Severe cognitive decline that reduces their ability to interact with the tDCS device; Major visual or hearing weakness
reduces the ability to interact with tDCS device; Major foot problems such as active lower extremity wounds, major foot
deformity (e.g., Charcot Foot), previous major amputations, and claudication; Demand-type cardiac pacemaker , implanted
defibrillator , implanted metal plate in the brain or head, or other implanted electronic devices; Epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] , seizures, brain
lesions, migraine or severe heart disease; Sensitive skin or rash, broken skin, or open wounds; Pregnancy; and any
conditions that may interfere with outcomes or increase the risk of the use tDCS based on the judgement of clinicians.
F2.  Procedure
     Please note that subjects will be consented before participating in any study-related activities. This study will not bring any
direct costs to the subject.
At the baseline visit (BL) patients will receive the tDCS device (LIFT iD Neurostimulation, RPW Technology , LLC, NY , [LOCATION_003])
and research staf f will provide instruction on how to use the device along with a user manual. Patients will be asked to use
the stimulation device for at maximum 20 minutes per day , for a period of 4-weeks. Finally , at the BL  visit patients will also
be asked to answer a number of questionnaires to assess patient-reported outcomes and cognition. These include:
instrumental activity of daily living scale (IADL), daily living independence (KA TZ), depression (CES-D), fatigue (F ACIT),
cognitive assessment (MOCA), attention(Number Span forward) working memory (Number Span backward ), processing
speed and executive functioning (T rail Making Test Part A and Part B ), and memory encoding, recall, and recognition (
Hopkins V erbal Learning Test), pain and mobility , global health (PROMIS), sleep (PSQI), frailty (TSFI, FRIED FRAIL TY),
anxiety (BAI), multi-dimensional assessment of fatigue (MAF), community engagement (Life-Space), and user acceptability
(TAM).
At the final visit (V1), patients will return to the clinic and return the neurostimulation device. To assess feasibility and
acceptability (Aim 1), patients will answer a technology acceptance model (T AM) questionnaire. This questionnaire will
assess their perceived ease of use, perceived benefit and technology anxiety . Furthermore, patients will answer the same
questionnaires assessed at baseline in order to address Aim 2. Both aims are listed below: - Aim 1: To examine feasibility
and acceptability of tDCS in patients with cognitive issues.
- Aim 2: To examine ef fectiveness of tDCS in patients with cognitive issues.
Device: LIFT iD neurostimulation uses transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) technology and was developed to help
improve the brain's potential through electrical stimulation. Patients will be given the LIFT iD device headband, 1 mirror , 1
plastic spoon, 6 white sponges, 1 USB cable and 1 plastic bottle in a packet at the BL  visit.
Preparation of device: 1. Patients must prepare a salt water solution in the plastic bottle provided using none iodized salt,
tap water , and the provided measuring spoon. 2. Two sponges should be dampened with tap water and then saturated with
the salt water solution made in step 1 on both sides. 3. Sponges should be placed in the electrodes in the LIFT iD
headband. 4. LIFT iD headband should be placed on the forehead, centered and straight across. 5. Once fit, patient should5/20/24, 12:00 PM Human Protocol Report
https://brain.bcm.edu/esp1/reports/Human/Protocol.asp?protocol=457647 4/9
use the on/of f button to begin stimulation. 6. Device automatically powers down after 20 minutes.
Stimulation frequency: maximum of 20 minutes daily . During the Stimulation the patient should perform an activity , such as
read, answer emails, homework, etc.
After the completion of the study the patient should return the LIFT iD device to the Research Coordinator .
All in-person visits will occur at Baylor College of Medicine McNair Campus. Research staf f may call patients in between
the two visits to assess compliance and answer questions. Patients will not be paid for in person visits or phone calls.
 
Section G:  Sample Size/Data Analysis

     Local: 10              W orldwide: 10
Please indicate why you chose the sample size proposed:
     Convenient and selected based on available resources to demonstrate feasibility and the proof of concept ef fectiveness of
tDCS therapy . We plan to recruit 10 eligible subjects.
G2.  Data Analysis
Provide a description of your plan for data analysis. State the types of comparisons you plan (e.g. comparison of means,
comparison of proportions, regressions, analysis of variance). Which is the PRIMAR Y comparison/analysis? How will the
analyses proposed relate to the primary purposes of your study?
     Independent t-test, U-test, or Chi-square (depends on type of variables) to compare between groups (AG, and PG for key
baseline descriptors including demographics and relevant clinical characteristics. Those descriptors which show statistical
significant dif ference, baseline value of the outcomes measured in the model, and other variables that are deemed to be
prognostic, will be considered as covariates for adjusting the results in the following assessments. Appropriate mixed
models (linear for continuous or Generalized Estimating Equations (GEEs) for non-continuous or non-parametric variables)
will be used to test the intervention ef fect for each of the outcomes. Results will be adjusted by [CONTACT_364728].
 
Section H:  Potential Risks/Discomforts
H1.  Potential Risks/Discomforts
Describe and assess any potential risks/discomforts; (physical, psychological, social, legal, or other) and assess the likelihood
and seriousness of such risks:
     The devices and technologies are completely non-invasive, safe, non-toxic and non-ionizing. The potential risks to subject
are minimal. However , like any battery powered systems, there is a minimum risk of sensor malfunctioning. In addition, the
study devices are not waterproof, and although they use a low powered battery (similar to a cellphone battery), in order to
avoid any risk of shock the monitor should not be submerged or saturated with fluids during operations or cleaning. It does
not emit any radiation to the human body , and does not of fer any significant risk to the subject.
Subjects may experience mild discomfort or irritation from the band or sponges on their forehead and mild headaches
during adaptation period after initiating therapy . We will inform the subject to please notify the investigators if the band or
sponges are uncomfortable.
All information we will collect about the subject will be stored in a secure location and coded in a way to maintain
confidentiality . Only study personnel will have access to their records. Data collected during the study may be published
and made publicly available. Data may also be shared with other research groups. However , data that could in any way
identify them will not be made public or shared.
H2.  Data and safety monitoring plan
     Do the study activities impart greater than minimal risk to subjects?

Section I:  Potential Benefits
Describe potential benefit(s) to be gained by [CONTACT_30435] a result of participating in the planned work.
     There is potential benefit of improvement of memory or cognitive functioning based on previous study of the use of tDCS.
The patients might find it easier to concentrate or focus on a task.
Describe potential benefit(s) to society of the planned work.
     As described above, this type of work may allow physicians to provide more personalized care for patients with cognitive
impairments.
Do anticipated benefits outweigh potential risks? Discuss the risk-to-benefit ratio.
     This study brings no more than minimal risk to subjects as it only involves a non-invasive device. There are some risks
associated with lack of comfort from tDCS, , risk associated with electrical malfunction of the tDCS device, and other
unknown risks. All devices will be checked before any use to minimize the risk associated with electrical malfunction.
Although there is no direct benefit for participating in the study , their participation may help the investigators better
understand the impact and functionality of tDCS.

Informed Consent Form signatures will be obtained according to standard Baylor IRB regulations. W e will of fer the subjects
the ability to consent by [CONTACT_17084]/or videoconference and send the consent form via the RedCap platform. Should the
subject agree to eConsenting, RedCap eConsent will be used to send a link to each participant. Once the participant has
opened the electronic copy of the eConsent, the PI/research staf f will review the study and consent document with the
participant, asking questions to gauge comprehension, and answering the subject's questions and concerns. This can be
done in-person, by [CONTACT_648], or videoconference. The subject will have the option to email the ICF to themselves. Once the
process is finished, the research staf f will receive a link via email and will be able to see the completed ICF in REDCap.
The ICF can be downloaded for additional signatures and/ or stored in REDCap. PI/PI [INVESTIGATOR_364726] f should document
the entire informed consent/assent process for each person in a visit checklist. Once received, the PI/research staf f that
explained the study should sign the appropriate signature [CONTACT_364730].
Should the subject not agree to eConsenting, the subject will receive a paper copy of the ICF to review . The PI/research
staff will review the study and consent document with the participant, asking questions to gauge comprehension, and
answering the subject's questions and concerns. The subject will be told to keep one form and returned the other to the
investigator by [CONTACT_2319], email, or fax. The Baylor Investigator/designee will sign the consent form when returned from the
subject. The signed consent form will be maintained in research records and uploaded to REDCap.
Regardless of the method of consenting, a physical copy of the signed consent form will be provided to the subject in
person. Should they request to have it emailed, we may also provide it to them via email.

Clinical Trial Protocol: PLN-[ZIP_CODE]-IPF-201, Version 6.[ADDRESS_1109231]-[ZIP_CODE]-000 (hereafter referred to as PLN-[ZIP_CODE]) 
for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), the most common interstitial lung disease. IPF is a condition that is usually observed in the elderly and that is characterized by [CONTACT_545180], with median survival of 3.8 years after diagnosis based on 2014 data in the [LOCATION_002]. The hallmark honeycomb appearance of IPF on high-resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) is the result of extensive fibrosis . 
Although not completely understood, IPF appears to be a response to alveolar epi[INVESTIGATOR_803477]. As has also been indicated to be the case 
v integrins is central to the control of 
v6 v1 in 
PLN-[ZIP_CODE]. 
PLN- v6 v1 integrins (50% 
inhibitory concentration [IC 50] 5.7 nM and 3.4 nM, respectively). PLN-[ZIP_CODE] reduced 
collagen synthesis in mice with bleomycin-induced lung injury, a commonly used 
experimental model for IPF . In ex vivo human IPF lung tissue 
(precision cut lung slices), treatment with PLN-[ZIP_CODE] significantly decreased collagen 
type 11 (COL1A1) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression levels after a 3-day 
incubation period, providing an indication of antifibrotic activity in IPF. Mice completely 
def v6 function live a normal lifespan  suggesting that even 
full inhibition of such integrins is well tolerated. 
Integrins v6 and v1 mediate the release of activated transforming growth factor beta 
(TGF-)1, leading to binding of TGF- 1 to its receptor (TGF R)I/II and induction of 
SMAD2 and SMAD3 phosphorylation  
. Measurement of SMAD phosphorylation in lung lysates and in 
cells from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) has, therefore, been proposed to serve as a 
pharmacodyn v6 integrin engagement  
PLN-[ADDRESS_1109232]-[ZIP_CODE] (a tool compound with similar 
potency/integrin selectivity to PLN-[ZIP_CODE]) was also shown to inhibit the phosphorylation of 
SMAD2 in BALF cells isolated from the lungs of healthy cynomolgus monkeys. In both mouse and non-human primate studies, t
v6v1 integrin 
inhibitors correlated with reduced SMAD phosphorylation levels, demonstrating a clear pharmacokinetic (PK)/PD relationship. 
The present positron-emission tomography (PET) study described here is designed to address 
a relevant clinical question in participants with IPF. The dose- and exposure-response 
interaction of PLN-[ADDRESS_1109233]-[ZIP_CODE]  Pliant Therapeutics Inc. 
Clinical Trial Protocol: PLN-[ZIP_CODE]-IPF-201, Version 6.0 Page 15
with a competitive v6-binding probe at or near the maximum observed drug concentration 
(Cmax) of PLN-[ZIP_CODE]. Evaluation of PLN-[ZIP_CODE] receptor occupancy of v6 will be analyzed 
v6-specific PET probe ([18F]FP-R 01-MG-F2; R 01), also known as the 
Knottin tracer. Previous work conducted in collaboration with Stanford Medical Center 
demonstrated the v6 
protein expression in the lung  The R 01 cystine knot peptide (FP-R 01-
MG-F2) is a 36-amino acid peptide which has been shown to bind selectively and 
specifically to v6, in vivo and in vitro, with nanomolar affinity  The 
18F radiotracer decays in the body with a short half-life of ~110 minutes (refer to the 
Radiology Manual for details about the Knottin tracer). Pliant has previously conducted 
studies in tissue and purified proteins demonstrating the ability of PLN-[ADDRESS_1109234]-[ZIP_CODE] in participants with IPF.

 Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent preexisting condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. 
 New conditions detected or diagnosed after study drug administration even though it may 
have been present prior to the start of the study. 
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.  
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study drug or a concomitant medication (overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/serious adverse event [SAE]). Events that do not meet the definition of an AE include: 
- Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE.  
- Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (e.g., social and/or convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  
- Anticipated day-to-day fluctuations of preexisting disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.  
 If there is evidence of an AE through report or observation, the Investigator or designee will evaluate further and record the following information:  
- Time of onset and resolution 
- Severity 
- Causality/relation to study treatment 
- Action taken regarding study drug 
- Outcome 
6.10.3 Severity of an Adverse Event 
Grading the severity of AEs will use the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) grading system (Version 5.0), as described below. The clinical significance of the AE is determined by [CONTACT_737]. The Investigator is encouraged to consult with the Medical Monitor.

6.10.4 Causal Relationship of an Adverse Event 
The Investigator will assess the relationship between study drug and the occurrence of each 
e relationship of each AE to study drug will be 
recorded in the source documents and the eCRF. Alternative causes, such as medical history, 
concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the study drug should be considered and investigated, if appropriate. The relationship or association of the AE to a study drug (PLN-[ZIP_CODE] or placebo) should be assessed using clinical judgment and the following considerations: 
No: Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiolog
y other than the study 
drug. For SAEs, an alternative causality must be provided (e.g., preexisting condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication). 
Yes: A temporal relationship exists between the AE onset and administration 
clinical state or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Furthermore, the AE appears with some degree of certainty to be related, based on the known therapeutic and pharmacologic actions or AE profile of the study drug. In case of cessation or reduction of the dose, the AE abates or resolves and reappears upon re-challenge.

Clinical Trial Protocol: PLN-[ZIP_CODE]-IPF-201, Version 6.0 Page 36
The relationship to study procedures (such as venipuncture) should be assessed using the 
following considerations: 
No: Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than the study 
procedure 
Yes: The AE occurred as a result of protocol-mandated procedures. 
6.10.5 Outcome  
The outcome of an AE will be recorded on the AE eCRF as follows:  
 Recovered / Resolved 
 Recovering / Resolving 
 Recovered / Resolved with Sequelae 
 Not Recovered / Not Resolving

6.10.[ADDRESS_1109268] be notified within 24 hours of the Investigator learning of the pregnancy.  The participant or the female partner of a male study participant will be followed through the outcome of the pregnancy. The Investigator is required to provide all the relevant information to the Sponsor using the Pregnancy Information Form to do so. 
6.10.7 Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events 
Abnormal laboratory findings (e.g., clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis) or other 
abnormal assessments  per se are not reported as AEs. However, those 
abnormal findings that are deemed clinically significant or that are associated with signs and/or symptoms must be recorded as AEs if they meet the definition of an AE (or recorded as an SAE if they meet the criteria of being serious), as described in Section 6.10.2. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other abnormal findings that are detected after consent or that are present at Baseline and worsen after consent are included as AEs (and SAEs if serious). 
The Investigator should exercise his/her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether 
an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically significant. Usually, the abnormality should be associated with a clinically evident sign or symptom, or

Clinical Trial Protocol: PLN-[ZIP_CODE]-IPF-201, Version 6.0 Page 37
be likely to result in an evident sign or symptom in the near term, to be considered clinically 
significant. A clinically significant laboratory abnormality in the absence of clinical symptoms may jeopardize the participant and may require intervention to prevent immediate consequences. For example, a markedly low serum glucose concentration may not be accompanied by [CONTACT_39597], yet be of a magnitude to require glucose administration to prevent such sequelae. 
6.10.8 Serious Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of Serious Adverse Events 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 Is life-threatening 
 Results in death 
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (i.e., admission, overnight stay) or prolongs existing 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_803484]/incapacity, or 
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
An AE is considered life-threatening if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_609987], its occurrence places the participant at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
Important medical events that are not one of the above may be considered to be SAEs by [CONTACT_13134], based upon appropriate medical judgement, they are considered to be clinically significant and may jeopardize the participant or when medical or surgical intervention may be required to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. (Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment at an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.) 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
In order to meet the requirements for expedited reporting of SAEs meeting specific 
requirements to applicable regulatory authorities and IRBs, all SAEs must be reported to the Sponsor within [ADDRESS_1109270]-[ZIP_CODE]  Pliant Therapeutics Inc. 
Clinical Trial Protocol: PLN-[ZIP_CODE]-IPF-201, Version 6.[ADDRESS_1109271] the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. The Investigator or Sponsor may withdraw a participant from the study or discontinue study drug for any of the following reasons: 
 Noncompliance with protocol procedures, including those relating to administration of study drug. 
 A serious or intolerable adverse event occurs. 
 A clinically significant change in a laboratory parameter occurs. 
 The Sponsor or Investigator terminates the study. 
 The participant requests to be discontinued from the study. 
If a participant is withdrawn from the study or discontinues study drug, he or she will 
undergo ET assessments (refer to the Schedule of Evaluations in Appendix 1).

7 STUDY ACTIVITIES 
The Schedule of Events with study activities is provided in Appendix 1. 
When multiple study procedures are scheduled at the same time point, the suggested order of 
procedures is as follows but may be adjusted by [CONTACT_803489]:  obtain vital signs, collect urine sample, and collect blood sample. When 
several assessments are required at the same time point, evaluations should be completed so that the PK sample is collected at the required time.  
 
 
 When samples 
for PK purposes are scheduled for collection around a PET procedure, the PK samples should be obtained as close as possible to the prescheduled timing while minimizing interference with the PET procedure, which has priority.

The contract research organization (CRO) will be responsible for the preparation of tables and listings and will assist in the preparation of figures, which may be done by [CONTACT_39601]. A statistical analysis plan (SAP), prepared and agreed before final database lock, will describe the analytic approach and methods in more detail. 
9.[ADDRESS_1109275]-[ZIP_CODE]). Pharmacodynamic, PK, and safety/tolerability evaluation of PLN-[ZIP_CODE] will be 
assessed in the target population. 
9.3 Analysis Populations 
Safety Population:  All participants who receive one dose of study drug will be included in 
the Safety Population. PET Population: All participants with at least a baseline PET will be included in the PET 
Population. 
PK Concentration Population:  All participants who receive one dose of study drug and 
have any measurable PLN-[ZIP_CODE] concentration data will be included in PK Concentration 
Population.  
PK Analysis Population:  All participants who have sufficient PLN-[ADDRESS_1109276]-[ZIP_CODE]-versus-time profiles (with plasma concentrations on both a log and linear scale) will be plotted for each participant.  
Non-compartmental analysis will be used to calculate the PK parameters T
max, Cmax, area 
under the drug concentration-time curve from time zero to the time of the last measurable 
concentration (AUC last), AUC from time zero to 4 hours (AUC (0-4)) and from time zero to 
24 hours (AUC (0-24)) after dosing, and average drug concentration (C avg), if applicable.

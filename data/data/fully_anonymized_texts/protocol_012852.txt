Transfusion s 
 
Purpose of the Study  – The long-term goal  of reducing morbidity and increasing 
treatment intervals for chronically transfused patients, the objective of this study  is to test 
the feasibility of the novel application of red blood cell (RBC) rejuvenation to chronic 
transfusion in sickle cell disease  (SCD) and the potential benefit in terms of RBC 
longevity, prothrombotic microparticle (MP)  formation, and oxygen (O2) delivery 
capacity of transfused RBCs.  
 
The purpose of this study is to :  
1.  To demonstrate that Rejuvenation improves in vivo RBC survival.  
We hypothesize that the loss of HbA over a transfusion interval will be reduced after a 
transfusion treatment with rejuvenated compared to standard RBCs.  
This will allow prolonging transfusion intervals to maintain the same %HbA target.  
 
2.  To dete rmine whether Rejuvenation reduces in vivo , RBC microparticles.  
We hypothesize that in vivo RBC -MP counts and RBC/RBC -MP-mediated thrombin  
generation before transfusion therapy will be lower after a prior treatment with  
rejuvenated compared to standard RBCs (“trough level”). Similarly, RBC -MP counts and 
RBC/RBC -MP-mediated thrombin generation will be lower immediately after transfusion 
therapy with rejuvenated compared to standard RBCs (“peak level”). This will minimize 
the contribution of transfusion therapy to the pre -exisiting, prothrombotic MP burden.  
 
3.  To demonstrate optimal in vivo O2 delivery capacity after Rejuvenation  
We hypothesize that, compared to standard RBCs, transfusion of rejuvenated blood will 
not reduce the p50 of patients’ blood. A high p50 is a compensatory mechanism to 
maintain tissue O2 delivery in SCD, since standard RBCs have a low p50 from 2,3 -DPG 
loss. 
 
Background & Significance  –SCD is a group of inherited RBC disorders that affects 
approximately 100,[ADDRESS_1156098] syndrome, priapi[INVESTIGATOR_8801], or persistent chroni c pain. While beneficial, 
transfusion is also associated with potential risks and adverse effects, including  immune 
hemolysis, RBC alloimmunization, iron overload, transfusion reactions, and infection  
with bacteria, viruses, and parasites are all potential  risks of transfusion ; therefore 
maximizing  the benefit and minimizing the risk of each transfusion is necessary.  
RBC transfusion was approved on the basis of short -term qua ntitative parameters, 
including <1% hemolysis in the unit at time of infusion and a n in vivo recovery >75% of

been explored. We postulate that RBC rejuvenation  increases the in vivo survival of 
transfused RBCs, decreases pathogenic RBC -M formation in vivo, and can improve in 
vivo tissue oxygenation via normalization of p50.  
 
Our proposed, pi[INVESTIGATOR_279922] -over, single -blind study seeks to demon strate the feasibility that 
RBC rejuvenation can improve the longevity and quality of transfused RBCs in 
chronically  transfused  SCD patients. Power analysis ([CONTACT_103529] -Ju Li, Duke University) was 
performed based on the  2015 %HbA results from the monthly transfusion records of 15 
UNC SCD patients. Persistence  of HbA during the transfusion interval represents 
survival of tra nsfused RBCs. From these data,  the mean (±SD) decrement of %HbA per 
day (total %HbA decrement per transfusion interval in  days) was 0.76% (±0.16). 
Therefore, the average %HbA decrement of 22.5% over 30 days can  
be considered a “standard decrement”. In orde r to increase the interval by 7 days, while  
maintaining a “standard decrement”, we must reduce the % HbA decrement/day from 
0.76% to 0.62% per day (a 19% reduction). This could decrease transfusions visits from 
[ADDRESS_1156100] savin g of $10,000 per year per patient. Our null 
hypothesis is that the  equivalence limit of mean differences of %HbA decrement per day 
between two treatments  (standard versus rejuvenated) is ±19%.  
This study  offers to benefit both SCD patients and potentially other massively transfused 
populations,  such as trauma patients. The use of an FDA -approved process permits 
immediate  application from bench to bedside upon completion of the research.  
RBC -ST and RBC -XT, as detailed in the study timeline. This has the potential to  
revolutionize RBC therapy and benefit millions of SCD patients worldwide.  
 
We additionally are interested in exploring the effectiveness of rejuvenation at 
reversing the deleterious biochemical changes that occur in stored RBCs, and h ave 
discussed the possibility of collaboration with [CONTACT_503334] D’Alessandro at the

experience analyzing the metabolic changes that occur during RBC storage34,35, and is 
interested in  identifying the biochemical differences between RBCs of sickle -cell 
patients receiving rejuvenated transfusions compared to standard transfusions. As such, 
we propose an external specimen repository, to be stored securely at UC -Denver under 
the supervisio n of Dr. D’Alessandro, which will be used to conduct future research that 
is unspecified at this time but will generally involve metabolomic analyses of subject 
RBCs. Investigators at Duke will contribute only leftover blood samples to this 
repository, and  subjects will be given the option to opt -in or opt -out of this repository. 
Subjects will not receive additional needlesticks for this repository and no additional 
blood will be drawn. All biological samples will be de -identified and no personnel 
outside o f DUHS will be provided with information that can be used to identify subject 
samples. All sample transfer will occur within the context of a pending materials 
transfer agreement, and Dr. D’Alessandro will obtain IRB approval or waiver from his 
institution  for this repository.  
 
Design & Procedures – This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. In this prospective, single blind, cross -over 
clinical trial, patients with sickle cell disease will receive either rejuvenated (R) or 
standard (S) RBCs with each treatment over a 6 -treatment  period as follows to maximize 
detection of any signal: SRR|RSS . Each patient will receive [ADDRESS_1156101] RBC’s (in all units) Treatment 2 and treatment 3 the patient will receive the 
RBCs treated with Rejuvesol  (in the last 4 units) .  The patient then crosses over to the 
RSS arm. Treatment 4 the patient receives Rejuvesol treated RBCs (in the last 4 units). 
Treatments [ADDRESS_1156102] RBCs (in all units) . For patients 
receiving RBC -XT, only the final [ADDRESS_1156103] in circulation following treatment completion.  
The Duke site ([CONTACT_30616]) will enroll [ADDRESS_1156104]

enrollment  at Duke  is expected to be [ADDRESS_1156105] ABO, D(Rh), C, E , and Kell antigens. For sessions in 
which standard units are used, no additional manipulations will be performed. For 
sessions in which  rejuvenated units are needed, rejuvenation will be performed with

Study specific laboratory data  
With no additional blood draw time points or venipunctures, an additional [ADDRESS_1156108] -transfusion. This means 
the total monthly volume of study blood is 36ml.  
Specific procedures to accomp lish each objective  
1.  Hb A/S determinations.  Samples will be whole blood in EDTA. Bio-Rad Variant II  
HPLC system with Variant II β -Thalassemia Short Program Reorder Pack (Bio -Rad 
Laboratories, Inc.; Hercules, CA) will be used per manufacturer’s instructi ons. Briefly, 
samples  will be mixed, diluted with specific hemolyzing/wash buffer, and injected into an 
analytic  cartridge. Absorbance will be measured at 415 nm. Background noise will be 
reduced with use  of a second wavelength at 690 nm. Raw data will be integrated by 
[CONTACT_4657]’s software, and  a chromatogram will be generated. Integrated peaks will be  
 
assigned to manufacturer -defined  windows derived from retention time of the peaks. The 
%Hb will be calculated by [CONTACT_832741] a peak as a fra ction of the total area of 
all Hb peaks on the HP LC chromatogram.  
 2: RBC -MP determinations.  Samples will be whole blood in citrate. The first blood 
tube will be discarded to avoid contamination during venipuncture. Blood will be 
centrifuged at  1,500g for 10 min at 4 C. The supernatant will be carefully removed into 
microcentrifuge tubes,  taking care not to disturb the buffy coat layer. A second 
centrifugation will be performed at  2,000g for 5 min to obtain platelet free plasma (PFP) 
to be frozen at -80 C. PFP aliquots (30 μL)  will be stained with the following 
markers/antibodies: 10 μL FITC -labeled AnnexinV mixed 1:1  with Annexin binding 
buffer (10 mM HEPES, 140 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2 ) and 2 μL PE -labeled anti-
CD235a. All markers/antibodies will be centrifug ed at  20,000g x 20 min prior to 
use.RBCMs will be defined as Annexin+/CD235+ events. Calcium -free samples and

PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_832736], MD  
Research Summary Version -2- 26-2017 6 single -stained MP-free plasma samples (supernatant from normal, healthy donor PFP 
spun at 100,000g x 60 min and stored at -80 C until use) will be used as negative controls. 
BD CompBeads® wil l be run as compensation controls per manufacturer’s instructions. 
Stained samples will be  incubated in the dark for 20 min and then further diluted with 
500 μL of Annexin binding buffer or phosphate buffered sal ine prior to analysis. All 
buffers will be filtere d through a 0.1 μm filter prior to use. CytoCount® beads will be 
added to each sample in equal volume as PFP (30 μL)  immediately prior to analysis to 
enable MP enumeration. The concentration of MPs in each  sample will be calculated as 
follows: (MPs counted x concentration of beads) / number of beads  counted. All samples 
will be analyzed on a Stratedigm S1000Ex (Stratedigm; San Jose, CA,  [LOCATION_003]) high -
sensitivity flow cytometer equipped with a forward scatter pho tomultiplier tube (FSC  
PMT) using a side scatter (SSC) trigger and 0.1 μm filtered sheath fluid. MP size gate for  
analysis will be set between 200 and 1000 nm utilizing Megamix Plus FSC/SSC® beads,  
which  are a mixture of 900, 500, 300, 240, 200, 160 and 1 00 nm fluorescent beads. Event 
rates will be  <8000 events/sec for all samples to minimize coincident events.  
RBC -mediated thrombin generation determinations.  Phosphatidylserine (PS) has 
been  found to directly correlate with rate of production of meizothrom bin-antithrombin 
(mTAT)  complexes and thrombin generation on RBCs. Whole blood samples will be 
collected in EDTA.  For positive controls, washed RBCs will be diluted to 20% 
hematocrit in RBC wash buffer and  incubated with 10mM N -ethylmaleimide (NEM) at 
37 C  for 30 min. NEM -treated cells will then  be washed 3 times before incubation with a 
4μM concentration of the calcium ionophore  A23187 at 37 C for 30 min. Ionophore -
treated cells will be washed 3 times and diluted to  2x106 cells/mL in RBC wash buffer. 
Simil ar to controls, samples will be incubated and washed  but without NEM or ionophore 
treatment. RBCs will be detected using PE -anti-glycophorin A  (CD235a). RBC PS will 
be measured via binding of FITC -labeled Annexin V on a FACS Canto II flow cytometry 
(BD Bio sciences Franklin Lakes, NJ).  
RBC -MP-mediated thrombin generation determinations . Whole blood samples will 
be collected in citrate. PFP will be prepared as described above and frozen at -80 C. The 
Zymuphen ELISA (Aniara Inc., West Chester, OH) is a functional assay that measures 
the procoagulant activity of MPs in PFP. A microtiter plate is pre -coated with annexin V -
streptavidin.  PS+ MPs bind to the plate and expose their phospholipid surface, allowing  
 
pro-thrombinase  complex to cleave prothrombin into thrombin. Phospholipid in the 
sample is the limiting factor,  so there is a direct relationship between MP phospholipid 
concentration and thrombin  generation. Thrombin generation will be measured by a 
specific chromogenic substrate.  Thawed PFP samples and kit controls will be diluted 
1:20 in the kit sample diluent and  supplemented with calcium, Factor Xa (FXa), and 
thrombin. A calibrator curve, diluted controls  and diluted samples will be added to the 
ELISA plate and incubated for 1 hr at 37 C. The plat e will be washed five times, then 100 
μl of Reagent 1 (FXa –FVa) and 50 μl Reagent 2  (prothrombin) will be added and 
incubated for 10 min at 37 C, then 50 μl of Reagent 3 (thrombin  substrate) will be added, 
and incubated for 3 min at 37 C. Finally, 50 μl of  stop solution will be  added and 
absorbance read at 405 nm. Results will be calculated from the calibrator curve.

RBC  suspension will be placed in a specially designed, temperature - and humidity 
controlled rotating  tonometer. RBCs will be progressively exposed to varying gas 
mixtures in order to produce  fixed solution O2%, typi[INVESTIGATOR_721015] 2%, 5%, 8%,  and 
20%. After 10 min of gas mixture at  each pO2% sample will be removed from the 
tonometer for blood gas measurement. An Abbott  i-Stat (Abbott Laboratories; Abbott 
Park, IL) will be used to measure pO2 and directly measures  including Hb O2 saturation. 
The Hb O2 saturation versus pO2 curve will be constructed and p50  extrapolated for each 
sample. p50 results will be generated and O2 -binding curves displayed graphically.

Data Analysis & Statistical Considerations  –Routine clinical  measurements will be 
compared with repeated measures analysis of variance.  As this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_832737], the only relevant changes to analyze will be pre - and post -procedure. 
Statistical data obtaine d (noted and described in the Design and Procedures section)  will 
be used for future planning of a larger comparison study.  
No interim analysis is planned but adverse events will be reported to the IRB as required.    
1: To demonstrate that Rejuvenation improves in vivo RBC survival. We 
hypothesize that the loss of  HbA over a transfusion interval will be reduced after a 
transfusion treatment with rejuvenated compared to standard RBCs. HbA/S 
determination is routinely performed pre - and post - treatments. The %HbA decrement is 
the current pre -treatment HbA – previous post treatment HbA in %. Our primary outcome 
variable  will be HbA decrement per day to account for minor variability. A generalized 
linear model will be applied to determine whether the mean difference in HbA exceeds 
+/-19%. Secondary outcomes will evaluat e actual HbA decrement (g/dl) with and without 
indexing to calculated circulating blood volume. If %HbA decrement with rejuvenated 
units exceeds -19% we will reject the null hypothesis and conclude that rejuvenation will 
permit prolonging transfusion inter vals by a week to maintain the same %HbA target. 
Whether or not we reject the null hypothesis, these data will inform treatment effect size 
and prospective collection of %HbA variability can validate preliminary data 
strengthening future sample size estima te calculations . 
2: To determine whether Rejuvenation reduces in vivo , RBC microparticles. We 
hypothesize that in vivo RBC -MP counts and RBC/RBC -MP-mediated thrombin  
generation before transfusion therapy will be lower after a prior treatment with  
rejuvenated compared to standard RBCs (“trough level”). Similarly, RBC -MP 
counts and RBC/RBC -MP-mediated thrombin generation will be lower immediately 
after transfusion therapy with rejuvenated compared to standard RBCs (“peak 
level”). These secondary outc omes will inform on effect size of rejuvenation on the 
immediate changes in RBC -MP counts after treatment. If reduction in RBC -MPs is 
augmented by [CONTACT_832743], better efficacy of treatment could be postulated and 
subsequently tested, as this will minimize  the contribution of transfusion therapy to the  
 
preexisiting, prothrombotic MP burden. Phosphatidylserine (PS) has been found to 
directly correlate with rate of production of meizothrombin -antithrombin (mTAT) 
complexes and thrombin generation on RBCs. The capacity of RBCs and RBC -MPs to 
generate thrombin could inform evaluation of future anticoagulation needs and targets. 
Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests will be used to compare RBC -MP counts and thrombin 
generation.

this phenomenon by  [CONTACT_832744] -dose RBC -ST to high -dose RBC -XT. 
Determinations of O2 -binding curves and,  therefore, accurate p50 measurements will

In the future , if the study team wishes to share any data with UNC or any other external 
researchers an amendment will be submitted.  
 
Data & Safety Monitoring –  
Rejuvesol is a blood product additive that is washed out of the unit prior to 
administration per AABB and FDA standards,  it is not given as an iv drug. The effect of 
Rejuvesol is to increase/normalize the p50 of the RBCs to a le vel that is seen in normal 
and anemic individuals. Rejuvenation is a AABB standardized and FDA approved 
procedure and as such we believe a DSMB is not indicated. AEs and SAEs will be 
reported to the IRB, per policy,   
 
Specific, product related  adverse effe ct would include  be to further decrease SaO2 in 
hypoxic individuals, especially if the p50 was markedly increased. For this reason the 
exclusion criterion (per package insert) include  not using on units stored for < 10 days 
(2,3, DPG and p50 would  be supra normal) and not enrolling patients with a pO2 
<40mmHg or a room air SaO2 <92%.  
 
Data  and safety monitoring will be ongoing  as part of the standard of care protocol .  
There are no additional  procedures or interventions as part of this study.  Transfusion 
SOC  monitoring will be done according to guidelines and should there be any type of 
reaction the transfusion will be stopped and the appropriate actions taken.  
Any adverse events will be reported to the IRB as required.  
 
Privacy, Data Storage & Confidentiality – Study records that identify subjects will be

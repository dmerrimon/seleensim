2Synopsis
Purpose
The purpose of this work is to investigate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of an 
enhanced opi[INVESTIGATOR_207689], tailored to the needs of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_207690], incorporating real-time guidance from an addiction 
medicine and pain-trained physician/pharmacist team, using a pi[INVESTIGATOR_207691]. Findings from this research may improve pain management and decrease risk 
of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-related adverse events among patients with chronic pain.
Primary Objective
The primary objective of this study is to determine whether an enhanced opi[INVESTIGATOR_207692], tailored to the needs of patients with chronic pain, is feasible to 
implement in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885].
Secondary Objective
One secondary objective is to determine whether an enhanced opi[INVESTIGATOR_207693]-based opi[INVESTIGATOR_207694].  The other secondary objective of 
this study is to determine whether an enhanced opi[INVESTIGATOR_207695], intensity, and interference and decreases the risk for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-related adverse 
events among adult patients with chronic pain hospi[INVESTIGATOR_207696]-New

Study Design
We propose a pi[INVESTIGATOR_110307] [ADDRESS_248199] at one site: Yale New Haven Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (YSC and SRC).
Primary Outcome Variables
The primary outcomes for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_207697].  For recruitment, we will describe the number of patients screened vs. the 
number of patients eligible; the number of patients eligible vs. the number enrolled; and 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_207698] (in relation to the admission and discharge dates). For 
retention, we will describe the number of participants in the intervention group for whom

3we are able to deliver the full enhanced opi[INVESTIGATOR_207699], as well as the 
number in intervention and control groups who complete the peri-discharge evaluation. 
Secondary and Exploratory Outcome Variables (if applicable)
A secondary outcome for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_207700] a count of guideline-based care 
elements considered to be “best practices” for opi[INVESTIGATOR_207701]. These include ordering of alternative pain relief medications (e.g., acetaminophen), 
ordering of a bowel regimen, ordering of medication to treat opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427], order of 
urine toxicology screen, ordering of ECG for patients prescribed methadone, avoidance of 
co-prescriptions of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], and other associate “best care” practices. These 
metrics will be abstracted from the medical record.
Other secondary outcomes will include pain frequency, intensity, and interference, 
assessed using a modified Brief Pain Inventory.[ADDRESS_248200].
Study Population
The study population will be comprised of adult patients (>=18 years) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_207702]. Eligible patients 
can be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_207703] (i.e., admission diagnoses do not need to be 
related to chronic pain). Patients will be identified by a pre-specified case identification 
tool (i.e., Epic report). 
Number of Participants
We will enroll 100 participants for this feasibility study.
Study Schedule
The total number of visits as part of this intervention will include (1) screening and 
consent, (2) baseline interview (may be combined with consent visit, per participant’s 
preference), and (3) a peri-discharge interview (within 48 hours of anticipated discharge). 
The total number of study visits is expected to be three per participant, with the potential 
for greater frequency of interaction via phone. Each visit will last approximately 30 
minutes or less.

1.1 Background
Many patients with CP who receive long term opi[INVESTIGATOR_207706]-related harms, including opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] (OUD),. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_207707]3 and 
are an important opportunity to optimize the use of medications for CP and OUD, when 
indicated. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_207708], as opi[INVESTIGATOR_207709].4 
Administration of opi[INVESTIGATOR_207710]-term opi[INVESTIGATOR_207711]. Notably, there has been increased recognition of the “stress of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],” 
including sleep deprivation, immobility, and uncertainty about care plans.[ADDRESS_248201] 
practices for patients with CP and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561], with or without OUD. While addiction 
consult services are growing, they are not always involved in the care of patients with CP 
and are limited to a small number of academic medical centers. 
Recently “opi[INVESTIGATOR_207712]” programs, modelled after “antibiotic stewardship” 
programs that manage the adverse individual and public health effects of antibiotic 
prescribing that does not adhere to guidelines, have been created by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_207713].4,9 These programs, endorsed by [CONTACT_207792] (the entity that accredits hospi[INVESTIGATOR_207714]), bring focused expertise to 
promote the appropriate use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_207715]. They are consistent 
with the Joint Commission’s mandate in 2018 for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_207716]. However, a  2020 
survey of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_207717] 14% prospectively identified patients in need of 
stewardship services – the model we propose.4 Prospective opi[INVESTIGATOR_207718]-medication treatments balancing opi[INVESTIGATOR_207719], often assessed 
as milligram morphine equivalents (MMEs), and benefits, often assessed using measures of 
pain and pain interference. 
While there is growing use of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-based opi[INVESTIGATOR_207720], they have 
not been tailored to the needs of patients with CP and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561], with or without 
OUD. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_207721], and the clinicians who care for 
them, face a range of key decisions regarding each condition. For instance, the 
management of methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone for patients with OUD involves 
clinical considerations including important patient preferences. Additionally, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_207722], surgery 
or medical procedures as well as exacerbations of CP during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_207723]. Clinical decisions about which medication and non-medication-based 
pain treatments to deploy involve weighing risks and benefits, including the impact of 
treatments on OUD and comorbid anxiety and depression. These decisions, especially those 
related to medications, may have important consequences with respect to CP, opi[INVESTIGATOR_207724], anxiety, depression and health care utilization. There are 
few published studies to inform stakeholders regarding the efficacy of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-based opi[INVESTIGATOR_207725], especially in patients with CP and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561].

9individual and public health effects of antibiotic prescribing, to improve opi[INVESTIGATOR_207727].4 This program, endorsed by [CONTACT_60545], brings focused 
expertise to promote the appropriate use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_207728] “best practice” recommendations regarding opi[INVESTIGATOR_172293]. However, the YNHHS Opi[INVESTIGATOR_207729], as the only patient-specific intervention implemented is the 
delivery of automated “best practice alerts” (i.e., “pop-ups”) through the electronic medical 
record of clinicians.
The purpose of the proposed study is to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary 
efficacy of an opi[INVESTIGATOR_207730]-time interaction and guidance 
from an addiction medicine and pain-trained physician/pharmacist team, focusing on 
implementing and tailoring best practices for use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_207731]. We propose to evaluate the implementation and assess preliminary 
efficacy of the intervention.
1.2 Prior Experience (if applicable) 
Drs. Weimer, Fiellin, and Becker have extensive experience using electronic medical record 
data to identify patients with chronic pain.8,10-[ADDRESS_248202] to identify patients receiving opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], automatic “best practice” prompts in the 
electronic medical record to avoid opi[INVESTIGATOR_207732] 24 hours, and automatic “best practice” prompts to prescribe naloxone at discharge 
for patients who are prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_207733] a certain dose. The study proposed will 
leverage existing YNHH clinical pharmacy staff and opi[INVESTIGATOR_207734]. [CONTACT_207800] has also developed landmark hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-based Addiction Medicine Consult Programs 
and developed nationally recognized pain and OUD treatment education for clinicians.30-[ADDRESS_248203]. Ackerman has led innovations to address hospi[INVESTIGATOR_207735].35 Relevance: The 
investigators have experience using electronic medical records to identify patients with 
chronic pain and OUD and in conducting hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-based intervention studies. The proposed 
work will evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of an enhanced version of an existing opi[INVESTIGATOR_207736]. Rationale/Significance

10There are a range of key decisions regarding hospi[INVESTIGATOR_207739]. For instance, the management of methadone, 
buprenorphine and naltrexone for patients with OUD involves clinical considerations 
including important patient preferences. Additionally, tailored treatment may be necessary 
for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_207740], surgery or medical procedures as well as exacerbations of CP during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Clinical decisions about which medication and non-medication-based pain 
treatments to deploy involve weighing risks and benefits, including the impact of treatments 
on OUD and comorbid anxiety and depression. These decisions, especially those related to 
medications, may have important consequences with respect to CP, as well as opi[INVESTIGATOR_207724], anxiety, depression and health care utilization.
Interventions that maximize benefits and minimize risks of opi[INVESTIGATOR_207741]. Currently, the YNHHS Opi[INVESTIGATOR_207742], modelled after “antibiotic stewardship” programs that manage the adverse 
individual and public health effects of antibiotic prescribing, aims to improve opi[INVESTIGATOR_207743]-specific intervention implemented is the delivery of automated 
“best practice alerts” (i.e., “pop-ups”) through the electronic medical record. The proposed 
study intervention will build on to current Opi[INVESTIGATOR_207744]-time 
interaction and guidance from an addiction medicine and pain-trained physician/pharmacist 
team, focusing on implementing and tailoring best practices for use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_207745].
1.4 Purpose of Study/Potential Impact 
The purpose of this work is to investigate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of an 
enhanced opi[INVESTIGATOR_207689], tailored to the needs of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_207690], incorporating real-time guidance from an addiction 
medicine and pain-trained physician/pharmacist team, using a pi[INVESTIGATOR_207746]. Findings from this research may improve pain management and decrease risk of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-related adverse events among patients with chronic pain.
1.5 Potential Risks and Benefits
1.5.1 Potential Risks 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_207747]:  The goal of the enhanced opi[INVESTIGATOR_207748]/risky opi[INVESTIGATOR_207749]. We anticipate no significant adverse effects from 
participating in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_207699]. It is important to note that the 
intervention team will not have a direct impact on patient care; all guidance related to 
appropriate pain management and adjuvant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_207750] a participant’s 
clinical team, who will be ultimately responsible to decide whether to apply such guidance to 
their patient’s care. Nonetheless, there is a small chance that efforts to manage pain in the 
context of best practices for opi[INVESTIGATOR_207751] 5/4/2022

11participants. Distress may include temporary increases in pain or physical or mental 
discomfort from opi[INVESTIGATOR_9801]. All patients will receive best practice treatment 
for their withdrawal symptoms and treatment of OUD, if present, as part of usual clinical 
care.
Rating scales and questionnaires: Rating scales and questionnaires are all non-invasive, 
however, some questions may be distressing to participants.
Confidentiality: There is a small risk of a breach of data or private information associated 
with participation in this study. 
1.5.[ADDRESS_248206] may potentially derive certain benefits, although none are 
guaranteed. Immediate potential benefits include improved pain management, including 
decreased severity or frequency of pain, and reduced interference from pain in going about 
daily activities. Another immediate potential benefit would be reduced risk of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-related 
adverse events during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], including over-sedation, gastrointestinal side effects, 
as well as identification of an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427], leading to treatment consistent with usual 
care (which would be recommended by [CONTACT_207793]). Potential long-term benefits 
include decreased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_207752], and 
better pain management and quality of life. These benefits would apply primarily to the 
intervention group. The control group will be treated with usual hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-based care.

will finish upon completion of all study activities for [ADDRESS_248209] will relate to feasibility of recruitment and retention.  
For recruitment, we will describe the number of patients screened vs. the number of patients 
eligible; the number of patients eligible vs. the number enrolled; and the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_207755] (in relation to the admission and discharge dates). For retention, we will describe 
the number of participants in the intervention group for whom we are able to deliver the full 
enhanced opi[INVESTIGATOR_207699], as well as the number in intervention and control 
groups who complete the peri-discharge evaluation.

3.3 Study Population
The study population will be comprised of adult patients (>=18 years) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_207702]. Eligible patients can 
be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_207703] (i.e., admission diagnoses do not need to be 
related to chronic pain). Patients will be identified by a pre-specified case identification tool 
(i.e., Epic report). 
3.3.1 Number of Participants
We anticipate 10-50 records will be returned in the Epic report each day that will be 
screened for eligibility. We aim to recruit 100 participants who meet all inclusion and 
exclusion criteria for the trial, for a total of approximately 50 each in the intervention and 
control arms. Screening and enrollment will continue until the target sample size has been 
reached, with a goal of recruiting 5-10 patients per week.
Eligibility Criteria/Vulnerable Populations
In order to be eligible for inclusion in the study, an individual must meet all of the following 
criteria:
adults (age ≥18 years);
admitted at YNHH (YSC and SRC) on medical units; 
identified as having chronic pain and prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. 
Have opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561] (evidenced by [CONTACT_207794][INVESTIGATOR_16447], meeting DSM-5 
criteria for OUD, or clinical history)
Any individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in 
this study:
 active cancer

baseline. Patients will then be randomized on a 1:1 ratio to either the enhanced opi[INVESTIGATOR_207756] a control (i.e., usual care) arm. Patients who are randomized to 
the intervention arm will have their medical record reviewed by [CONTACT_17588] a pharmacist and a 
physician trained in pain and addiction medicine. The pharmacist and physician will provide 
best practice guidance via an Epic note to the primary care teams to consider, versus 
continuation with their usual care plan. All guidance will be voluntary for clinical teams to 
follow. All participants will be tracked daily in Epic for discharge status, and when discharge 
within [ADDRESS_248212] relevant characteristics of each participant’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], use of guideline-based 
best practices for pain management and opi[INVESTIGATOR_207757], and incidence of 
readmissions and ED visits within [ADDRESS_248213]-protected and HIPAA compliant data entry and 
management software, Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap). Potential participants 
will be given unique study IDs at the outset of recruitment that will be used throughout the 
study to minimize use of identifiers. Only authorized study personnel will have access to files 
that link study IDs to identifiable data. 
3.4.[ADDRESS_248214] to pain management and opi[INVESTIGATOR_207758] a given participant’s medical team, we anticipate that the risk for adverse 
events that are attributable to participation in the clinical trial will be minimal. We will monitor 
all participants during their participation in the trial for (1) death, (2) development of an 
adverse reaction to a recommended intervention (e.g., new medication) requiring medical 
care, and (3) increases in pain assessed via the numeric rating scale (standard hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8385]) requiring a change in medical care. We will notify the Yale HIC of these adverse 
events, and any other anticipated adverse events, immediately upon notification of the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_207759] 5 days.
3.5 Study Schedule
The total number of visits as part of this intervention will include (1) screening and consent, 
(2) baseline interview (may be combined with consent visit, per participant’s preference), and 
(3) a peri-discharge interview (within 48 hours of anticipated discharge). The total number of 
study visits is expected to be three per participant, with the potential for greater frequency of 
interaction via phone. Each visit will last approximately 30 minutes or less.

16The RA will provide an overall description of the study and gauge the patient’s interest. If the 
patient is potentially interested in participating, the RA will begin the informed consent 
process- this will include providing details about the structure and format of study 
participation, the disclosure of potential benefits and risks, and confirmation that study 
participation is completely voluntary and will not in any way affect the care the patient 
receives at YNHSS or elsewhere. The patient will be provided with a paper consent form to 
review with the RA and will be given ample time to review independently or with family 
members. The patient will then be provided an opportunity to ask questions about the study. 
Once the RA has answered all questions, the participant will be asked to sign the informed 
consent form, indicating their understanding and willingness to participate in the study. The 
consent form will be scanned into REDCap for record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. A copy of the form will be 
given to the participant to keep. Study participation will commence after the signing of the

4.1 Ethical Considerations: Informed Consent/Assent and HIPAA Authorization
Consent forms will be Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved and the participant will be 
asked to read and review the document. The Research Associate will explain the research 
study to the participant and answer any questions that may arise. This conversation will take 
place in a private room. The Research Associate will also provide the name [CONTACT_3669] 
[CONTACT_116193], who the prospective participant can contact [CONTACT_207797]. 
Participants will have the opportunity to carefully review the written consent form and ask 
questions prior to signing. The participants should have the opportunity to discuss the study 
with their family or surrogates, or think about it prior to agreeing to participate. The 
participant will sign the informed consent document prior to any procedures being done 
specifically for the study. Participants will be informed that participation is voluntary and that

consent document will be given to the participant for their records
4.[ADDRESS_248223] (IRB) Review
The protocol will be submitted to the IRB for review and approval. Approval of the protocol 
must be obtained before initiating any research activity. Any change to the protocol or study 
team will require an approved IRB amendment before implementation. The IRB will 
determine whether informed consent and HIPAA authorization are required.
A study closure report will be submitted to the IRB after all research activities have been 
completed.

their staff, and the sponsor(s) and their interventions. Therefore, the study protocol, 
documentation, data, and all other information generated will be held in strict confidence. No 
information concerning the study or the data will be released to any unauthorized third party 
without prior written approval of the sponsor.
All research activities will be conducted in as private a setting as possible.
The study monitor, representatives of the Institutional Review Board (IRB), or regulatory 
agencies may inspect all documents and records required to be maintained by [CONTACT_1275], including but not limited to, medical records (office, clinic, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) for the 
participants in this study. The clinical study site will permit access to such records.
The study participant's contact [CONTACT_207798]-protected 
server internal use during the study. At the end of the study, all records will continue to be 
kept in a secure location for as long a period as dictated by [CONTACT_3488], Institutional 
policies, or, if applicable, sponsor requirements.
Study participant research data, which is for purposes of statistical analysis and scientific 
reporting, will be transmitted to and stored in REDCap. This will not include the participant's 
contact [CONTACT_1290]. Rather, individual participants and their research data will 
be identified by a unique study ID. The study data entry and study management systems 
used will be secured and password protected. At the end of the study, all study databases 
will be de-identified and archived at the Yale REDCap archiving system.
4.4 Deviations/Unanticipated Problems

investigator(s), or study staff, to the Yale IRB within 5 days of becoming aware of the 
deviation. Deviations will be tracked in study source documents (i.e., a central tracking 
sheet) and reported to the study sponsor. 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_199779] (UPs), defined as problems that are unexpected in 
terms of nature, severity, or frequency given the research procedures described in the study 
protocol and associated documents and result in a greater risk of harm than was previously 
recognized, to the Yale IRB and to the study sponsor. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_207769]/or sponsor to determine whether the UP is related or possibly related to participation in

19• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI's name, and the IRB project 
number;
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or 
outcome represents an UP;
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been 
taken or are proposed in response to the UP.
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported using the following 
timeline:
• UPs that are serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported to the IRB and study 
sponsor, if applicable within five days of the investigator becoming aware of the event.
• Any other UP will be reported to the IRB and study sponsor within five daysof the 
investigator becoming aware of the problem.
• All UPs should be reported to appropriate institutional officials (as required by [CONTACT_8706]'s written reporting procedures), the supporting agency head (or designee), and 
the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) within five days of the IRB's receipt 
of the report of the problem from the investigator.
The protocol and consent forms will be updated to reflect new knowledge of potential risks 
within 30 days. Inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as information regarding 
management of any newly discovered study-related risks, will be included in protocol and 
consent form modifications, and will be submitted to the Yale IRB in a timely manner. 
4.5 Data Quality Assurance
Data quality will be monitored via automated quality checks in REDCap and frequent review 
of data by [CONTACT_20685]. All members of the investigative team will be trained in 
accurate data collection and reporting processes prior to the start of data collection. 
Automated elements to be integrated into REDCap data collection forms include “response 
required” settings for critical data, out-of-range alerts for quantitative data, and “completion 
status” confirmation questions for all data collection forms. All data entry and modification 
will be tracked using automated audit trails. Data will be reviewed on a weekly basis by [CONTACT_207799]-of-range/extreme 
values.
4.6 Study Records
Documents to be considered study records include: screening forms; enrollment forms; 
signed informed consent forms; baseline interview; final interview; guideline-based care 
notes from addiction medicine physician/pharmacist team; and post-discharge and 30-day 
medical record abstraction forms.

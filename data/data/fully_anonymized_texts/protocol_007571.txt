NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY    
 
 
Provide a non-technical summary of the proposed research project that can be understood by 
[CONTACT_352020], including non-scientists and community 
members.  The summary should include a brief statement of the purpose of the research  and 
related theory/data supporting  the intent of the study as well as a brief description of the 
procedure(s) involving human subjects .  This summary should not exceed ½ page.   
  
 
 Painful Bladder Syndrome (previously known as Interstitial Cystitis) is a long-lasting condition 
with symptoms of bladder pain (particularly when th e bladder is full) and other bladder symptoms, such 
as frequent urination.  No one knows the exact cause of painful bladder syndrome, but there are many theories and there are likely multiple factors that can lead to the same symptoms.  Unfortunately, no cure for painful bladder syndrome has been found and mo st current treatments simply focus on improving 
symptoms.    The American Urological Association represents  urologists who treat bladder conditions, and 
this society has published guidelines for doctors w ho treat Painful Bladder Syndrome.  The guidelines 
suggest sacral neuromodulation as a 4
th line treatment; sacral neuromodulation involves a two stage 
surgical procedure and the implantation of a perman ent electrode and battery.  Although the guidelines 
note that we do not know exactly why sacral neuromodulation improves the symptoms of Painful Bladder Syndrome, it is thought to affect the way pain signals from the bladder are sent to the brain. 
 Percutanteous posterior tibial nerve stimulati on (PTNS) has more recently been approved for 
neuromodulation aimed at the same targets as sacral neuromodulation, without the need to have surgery 
or a permanently implanted device.  The purpose of our research is to determine if PTNS is potentially 
helpful in the treatment of Painful Bladder syndrome.   If this study suggests that PTNS is effective in 
treating symptoms, we believe additional research in this area will be worthwhile. 
 Our study will involve enrolling patients with Painful Bladder Syndrome and urinary frequency 
or urgency symptoms to treatment with 12 weekly treatments of PTNS.  Each PTNS session involves placing a small needle (like an acupuncture needle) be hind the inside of the ankle and connecting it to a 
mild electrical stimulation for 30 minutes.  We w ill assess symptoms and bladder function before and 
after the treatments.  At the end of the trial, patie nts will be asked to enroll (if they want to) in a 
continuation of the study to find out the durati on of symptom improvement, if any is found. 
 PTNS is an FDA-approved treatment, and this study will involve only using PTNS for approved indications.  The patients who participate in the stud y would be eligible to receive PTNS therapy as part 
of routine care.  The study will involve the collection of additional information (in the form of questionnaires and voiding diary) on the subset of  Painful Bladder Syndrome patients to learn how 
PTNS treatment affects their symptoms.

1- Purpose of the research:  The objective of this prospective, pi[INVESTIGATOR_352007], 
frequency and bladder pain also known as inters titial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS) 
respond to percutaneous tibial ne rve stimulation (PTNS) like patients with urinary frequency and 
urgency without pain. The specific aim is to evaluate how patients with IC/PBS respond to PTNS with regards to the reduction of symptoms in subjects with this disorder.  Pre and post treatment questionnaires will be used to assess this endpoint.  The hypothesis is that subjects who receive PTNS will demonstrate a response to treatment 
through a reduction in symptoms similar to what has been described has been demonstrated in the 
literature with sacral neuromodulation (SNM) for IC/PBC.  Though there is no uniform outcome 
measure for SNM studies, the majority use pain or symptom scales and have reported 55-80% response 
rates.
[ADDRESS_437868] 
found that PTNS may be helpful in chronic pelvic pa in conditions but there are still many gaps in our 
knowledge regarding when and how e ffective this modality is.  There are very few studies specifically 
examining PTNS in subjects with IC/PBS.  Given ho w persistent and debilitating IC/PBS can be, even 
with the most thorough and advanced treatments, th e potential to add another treatment modality with 
minimal morbidity to the treatment algorithm is significant.  
2- Relevant background information: 
 IC/PBS is a chronic condition which is “cha racterized by [CONTACT_352021] (pain, 
pressure, discomfort) perceived to be related to the urinary bladder, associated with lower urinary tract 
symptoms of more than six weeks duration, in th e absence of infection or other identifiable causes.”
[ADDRESS_437869] symptom is urinary frequency, often consequent to pain associated with bladder filling.  Treatment for IC/PBS is  often multimodal with behavioral modifications 
recommended first, followed by [CONTACT_352022].  As a chronic pain condition, patients often require trials of multiple treatment modalities to manage symptoms or require chronic pain medication.  Given that the etiology of IC/PBS is unknown, treatment currently 
focuses on managing symptoms, predominantly the compla ints of pain and urinary frequency.  Current 
treatment for refractory IC is often surgical/pro cedural and associated with significant cost and 
morbidity.  Considerable benefit could be derived from contributing an additional treatment modality to 
the algorithm for IC/PBS.  Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) is fourth line treatment as outlined in the algorithm in the 
guidelines for diagnosis and treatment published by [CONTACT_352023] 2011
2.  
The majority of the evidence supporting SNM in the treatment of PBS/IC comes from small case series 
of patients with refractory IC/PBS.1  PTNS (under the brand name [CONTACT_352047] ™ System) is an FDA-
UCI IRB Approved: 07-05-2017 | MOD# [ZIP_CODE] | HS# 2015-2010
2 of 24
   approved device for the treatment of urinary urgency, urinary frequency and urge incontinence.  It is 
often described as a peripheral form of neurom odulation (as opposed to SNM which is central 
neuromodulation at the level of the nerve root).  PTNS involves 12 weeks of weekly 30 minute office-
based treatment sessions with a small electrode placed s lightly above the ankle in order to stimulate the 
S2-4 nerve roots.   If benefits are obtained, 12 weeks of treatment is followed by [CONTACT_352024].  In comparison, sacral neuromodulation (SNM) involves a two stage procedure, with both stages mo st often being performed under conscious sedation in 
the operating suite and leading to the implantation of  a permanent device with consequent expense and 
risks.  Because PTNS and SNM share some of the same mechanisms of action and are approved for 
treatment of some of the same indications, there has been interest in the utility of PTNS in the treatment 
algorithm of IC/PBS.  Given that PTNS has FDA approval for the indication of urinary frequency, one of the most common complaints in IC/PBS, the majority of IC/PBS patients already qualify for PTNS.  It is the objective of our trial to systematically study the utility of PTNS in IC/PBS.  Prior studies have examined PTNS for the treatment of a variety of pain syndromes.  These studies have either been performed as single arm st udies or with a comparison arm of routine care for 
IC/PBS.
3  During literature search, we found only a single study that examined PTNS for treatment of 
IC/PBS and it only evaluated a highly refractory population with  longstanding disease.[ADDRESS_437870] future research.  
3- Outcomes: 
 The primary outcome variable will be the per centage of subjects to report that they are 
moderately improved or markedly improved in ove rall symptoms compared to baseline on a 7-point 
global response assessment (GRA) scale.  The GRA scale involves asking the question, “As compared to when you started the current study, how would you rate your overall symptoms now?”.  There are 7 
possible responses: markedly worse, moderately wor se, slightly worse, the same, slightly improved, 
moderately improved and markedly improved.  This scale is the current standard for outcome in studies 
that are evaluating treatments and interventions for IC/PBS.  There will be a number of secondary outcome va riables including: changes in a 24 hour voiding 
diary during the course of the interventions, ratings  for bladder pain, urinary urgency and urinary 
frequency on standardized scales, the score on O'Lear y-Sant IC Symptom and Problem Index, scores 
validated questionnaires for pelvic floor, sexual dysfunction and general health and any reports of adverse events.  The study will also examine demographic data and information on the course of the disease in subjects.  
4- Existing Knowledge: 
 There are few published studies looking at PTNS and IC/PBS. Literature review identified six 
studies that evaluated the effect of PTNS on pain syndromes.  Four of these studies looked at chronic 
pelvic pain 
5,6,7,8, one study evaluated chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain in men9 and only a single 
study examined PTNS in patients with IC/PBS10.  However, in the study of IC/PBS, there was a 
nonstandard treatment course (10 instead of 12 session s of PTNS), the subjects had severely refractory 
IC/PBS with multiple prior treatments attempted in all cases and often long-standing disease (up to 22 
years).  By [CONTACT_352025], the potential benefit of a minimally invasive intervention early in the disease process may have been missed. 
 The current literature leaves many questions a bout the potential utility of PTNS in patients with 
IC/PBS.  With one, uncontrolled study in refractory patients examining the topic, it is still unclear if 
PTNS could be useful in reducing IC/PBS symptoms and if so, which symptoms in which patients and by [CONTACT_42621]. The goal of this study is to begin to answer these questions.  If PTNS is not found to be 
effective in the treatment of IC/PBS, it provides a dditional information about the pathophysiology of 
IC/PBS and allows for focus of future research elsewhere.

screening, intervention/interaction/data collection, and follow-up) and procedures .  
a. Include an explanation of the study design (e.g., randomized placebo-controlled, cross-
over, cross-sectional, longitudinal, etc.) and, if appropriate, describe stratification, 
randomization, and blinding scheme.  
b. Provide precise definitions of the study endpoints and criteria for evaluation; if the 
primary outcomes are derived from several measurements (i.e., composite variables) 
or if endpoints are based on composite variables, describe precisely how the 
composite variables are derived. 
c. Indicate how much time will be required of the subjects , per visit and in total for the 
study.  
d. Indicate the setting where each procedure will take place /be administered (e.g. via

place at off-campus locations (e.g., educational institutions, businesses, organizations, 
etc.) Letters of Permission are required.  
e. If a procedure will be completed more than once (e.g., multiple visits, pre and post 
survey), indicate how many times and the time span  between administrations. 
2. For studies that involve routine (standard of care) medical procedures:  
Make clear whether procedures are being done for clinical reasons or for study purposes, 
including whether the procedures are being done more often because of the study. Use the 
following guidelines to determine the extent to which standard procedures and their 
associated risks need to be described in protocol:  
a. If the standard procedure is not explicitly required by [CONTACT_4690], the protocol 
need not describe that procedure or its risks.  
b. If the standard procedure is a main focus of the study (e.g., one or more arms of a 
randomized study is standard) or is explicitly required by [CONTACT_4690], the protocol 
must include a full description of the procedure and its risks.] 
3. It is strongly recommended  that you include a table of visits, tests and procedures. Tables 
are easier to understand and may help to shorten long repeated paragraphs throughout the

4. If study procedures include collecting photographs, or audio/video recording , specify 
whether any subject identifiable information will be collected and describe which identifiers 
will be collected, if any.  
5. Describe how the subject’s privacy will be protected  during the research procedures. 
Note : This is not the same as confidentiality (see the Privacy and Confidentiality web 
page). 
6. Be sure to submit data collection instruments for review with your e-IRB Application 
(e.g., measures, questionnaires, interview questions, observational tool, etc.).   
 
 
1. Chronological description of all study activities and procedures 
This is a single-arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_352011] (PTNS) decreases the symptoms of inte rstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS). 
 
The chronological description of study activities is as follows:  Recruitment : This will be a routine visit to the UCI urogynecology division that the patient has 
scheduled to initiate or continue routine care for their complaints.  If the provider identifies the patient as a candidate for PTNS the patient will be given informa tion regarding the study and a consent to review.  
If desired, the patient will be provided with an informational handout about the study.  Patients will have ample time to review the consent form and ask questions. If the patient elects to proceed and a consent is si gned, then the patient will proceed to screening. 
 Screening: Once consents have been signed, the patient s will be assessed by [CONTACT_352026].   The screening will take approximately 20 minutes, not including routine care.  
Pre-treatment (Visit 0): This visit will follow the screening visit.  The following materials will be given 
and tests will be administered:  
a) demographic and history survey b) 24 hour voiding diary c) visual analog scale (VAS) for bladder pain d) Pelvic Pain and Urgency/Frequency Patient Symptom Scale (PUF Questionnaire) 
e) O'Leary-Sant IC Symptom and Problem Index 
f) urine pregnancy test (for all premenopausal subjects) Questionnaires will be provided and will take 20 minutes to complete.  The 24 hour  voiding diary will be 
sent home with the patient and will require appr oximately 20 minutes spread throughout 1 day. 
 
Treatment (Visits 1-5): Prior to the start of first treatment vi sit, the subject will return the above 
forms/questionnaires.  These visits will be conducted in the UCI urogynecology clinic.  PTNS will be 
administered by a clinical nurse under physician supervision. This is standard of care in clinical practice.  
These treatments will occur weekly for [ADDRESS_437872] complete a VAS. 
Each treatment takes approximately 30 minutes. 
 Treatment (Visits 6): This treatment visit will be administered in the same fashion and with the same 
requirements at as all other treatment visits.  Following  this visit, the subject will be provided with the 
following forms/questionnaires to complete prior to the subsequent visit: 
a) 7-point global response assessment (GRA) scale 
b) 24 hour voiding diary c) visual analog scale (VAS) for bladder pain d) Pelvic Pain and Urgency/Frequency Patient Symptom Scale (PUF Questionnaire) 
UCI IRB Approved: 07-05-2017 | MOD# [ZIP_CODE] | HS# 2015-2010
6 of 24
   e) O'Leary-Sant IC Symptom and Problem Index 
The time required for the treatment session and completion of the forms is 45 minutes.  Treatment (Visits 7-11): Prior to the start of seventh treatment visit, the subject will return the 
additional forms/questionnaires.  These visits will c ontinue to be conducted in the UCI urogynecology 
clinic.  PTNS will be administered by a clinical nur se under physician supervision. This is standard of 
care in clinical practice. Treatments will be administ ered per standard protocol.  At all visits, the nurse 
will inquire regarding any noted adverse reactions to  treatment and will have the subject complete a 
VAS. Each treatment takes approximately 30 minutes. 
 
Final Treatment (Visit 12): This visit will be conducted per the rou tine protocol in visits 1-11, with any 
adverse reactions noted and a VAS collected.  After co mpletion of the visit, the patient will be given the 
following materials for completion within the subsequent two weeks. a) 7-point global response assessment (GRA) scale b) 24 hour voiding diary 
c) visual analog scale (VAS) for bladder pain 
d) Pelvic Pain and Urgency/Frequency Patient Symptom Scale (PUF Questionnaire) e) O'Leary-Sant IC Symptom and Problem Index The time required for the treatment session and completion of the forms is 45 minutes.  
Follow-up (Visit 13):  This visit will consist of a follow -up clinic visit with the subjects’  provider per 
routine care.  If not returned previously, the patient  will submit the materials completed after Visit 12.  
The subject and her provider will review her current symptoms and complaints and create an 
individualized management plan.  At this time, de pending on their current symptoms and response to the 
treatment, the subjects will be offered to continue  with PTNS treatments at a standard maintenance 
interval (typi[INVESTIGATOR_116511] 4-6 weeks) or to pursue alternative care outside of the study protocol if no 
benefit was obtained from treatment.  Any additiona l treatments (PTNS or otherwise) after the [ADDRESS_437873]-study Follow-Up (Visit 14) - optional: This visit will occur 12-[ADDRESS_437874] she prefers.   The following materials will be administered: 
a) 7-point global response assessment (GRA) scale 
b) 24 hour voiding diary 
c) visual analog scale (VAS) for bladder pain d) Pelvic Pain and Urgency/Freuqency Patient Symptom Scale (PUF Questionnaire) e) O'Leary-Sant IC Symptom and Problem Index f) Post-study follow-up survey 
The forms will take 20 minutes to complete and the 24 hour voiding diary will require approximately 20 
minutes spread throughout 1 day. 
 Study design- This a single-arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. 
 
Study endpoints- The end point for initial evaluation of data is follo wing 12 treatment weekly treatment sessions of PTNS 
and completion of a 24 hour voiding diary and repeat surveys.  At this time, depending on their current symptoms and response to the treatment, the subjects will be offered to continue with PTNS at maintenance intervals or pursue care outside of the study protocol.  We will offer patients to enroll in

2. Routine medical procedures: This study involves a standard of care medical proce dure/intervention that will be administered in the 
standard fashion and frequency as they are performed  in non-research settings.  The device will not be 
used concurrently with other medical monitoring equipment and that it will not be used in or around water. 
 
PTNS involves the placement of a thin needle (sim ilar to an acupuncture n eedle) inserted near the 
posterior ankle. The needle is then connected to an electrode stimulator and the stimulation is adjusted until appropriate response (toe flex or fan) is obtained without patient discomfort.  When at the appropriate level, the electrode is stimulated for [ADDRESS_437876] frequent 
adverse reaction to PTNS is a small, temporary local r eaction (inflammation or pain) at or near the site of 
needle insertion.  (See image below for location of needle insertion; arrow is pointing to device.)  
 
  
 An important point that will be thoroughly explained to subjects during the consent process is that PTNS has been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of urinary urgency and urinary frequency 
(inclusion criteria for this study) but has not been st udied in the context of the global complaints related 
to IC/PBS. This investigation is not aimed at providing a new FDA indication for PTNS. It is designed to assess if the subset of patients with urinary urgency, frequency and bladde r pain benefit from PTNS 
therapy.  No photographs, video or audio recordings w ill be collected as part of this study. 
 
During the consent process prior to pa rticipation in this research study, we will inform the subject of all 
planned contact [CONTACT_14198][INVESTIGATOR_1841].  We will also request from the subject the preferred method by [CONTACT_352027][INVESTIGATOR_352012].  The timing of the contact [CONTACT_14198][INVESTIGATOR_1841] (i.e. appointment times for treatment and follow up) 
will be at their discretion, within the constraints of the study personnel a nd the clinic scheduling. 
 The subjects’ privacy will be protected during PTNS tr eatment sessions through a dherence to the routine 
protocol of the urogynecology division.  PTNS is ad ministered in private treatment rooms by [CONTACT_352028].

B. Statistical Considerations  
 
1. Statistical Analysis Plan: Describe the statistical method(s) for the stated specific aims 
and hypotheses described in Section 1 . Note: Required for scientific review.  
2. Explain how the overall target sample size was determined (Provide power / sample 
size justification for the study).  
 
If a statistical analysis plan is not appropriate for your study design, please describe a 
plan for assessing your study results . 
 
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_352013] e the proportion of patient s experiencing moderate 
or marked improvement in overall symptom score as measured by [CONTACT_28501] a 7-point global 
response assessment scale collected after the inte rvention period.  Responders  will be defined as 
those reporting a moderate or marked improvement in symptoms in global response score.  We 
will estimate the proportion of responders with 95% confidence limits, as defined by a response of 
moderate or marked improvement on the GRA scale collected at follow-up. Pain response will be measured using the Pelvic Pain and Urgency/Fre quency Patient Symptom Scale (score total range: 
0-35).  We will estimate mean (plus standard devi ations and 95% CI) for pain score at baseline 
and follow-up and change in response to therapy,  testing for change over time using a paired t-
test.  Other secondary outcomes that we will be reviewing are: change in frequency of urinary collected in 24 hour voiding diaries, change in visual analog scale, and cha nge in O'Leary-Sant IC Symptom 
and Problem Index. These data consist of continuo us variables to be described using means, SDs 
and confidence intervals at baseline and follow-up.  Change over time will also be estimated and 
tested for difference from zero using a paired t-test.  
 
 SECTION 4: SUBJECTS (PERSONS/CHARTS/RECORDS/SPECIMENS) 
 
A. Number of Subjects (Charts/Records/Biospecimens) 
 
1. Indicate the maximum number of subjects to be recruited/consented  on this UCI 
protocol. This is the number of potential subjects you may need to recruit to obtain your 
target sample size. This number should include projected screen failures and early 
withdrawals .  Note: The IRB considers individuals who sign the consent form to be 
“enrolled” in the research. 
2. For Mail/Internet surveys include the number of people directly solicited. 
3. If the study involves use of existing charts, records, biospecimens, specify the maximum 
number that will be reviewed/tested to compi[INVESTIGATOR_352014]. 
 
 
32  
 
4. Of the maximum number of subjects listed above, indicate the target sample size  for the 
study. This is the number of subjects expected to complete the study or the number 
necessary to address the research question. 
UCI IRB Approved: 07-05-2017 | MOD# [ZIP_CODE] | HS# 2015-2010
10 of 24
   5. For social/behavioral research , the maximum sample size is often similar to the target 
sample size.  If the maximum sample size  is significantly greater (i.e., ≥ 1.5x) than the 
target sample size  provide a justification. 
6. For studies where multiple groups of subjects will be evaluated, provide a breakdown per 
group (e.g. controls vs. experimental subjects; children vs. adults; by [CONTACT_551]).  
 
 
24  
 
 
7. For multi-center research , indicate the overall sample size for the entire study (across all 
sites).  
 
 [ X ] Not applicable - This study is not a multi-center research study.  
 
8. Demonstrate that the target sample size will be sufficient  to achieve the study goal and 
should coincide with the statistical approach described in Section 3B .  Note: Required for 
scientific review. 
9. Sources and information  of assumed group effects and variability should be supplied (e.g., 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299]; data from related literature).  Note: Required for scientific review.  
 
 
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_48505] a primary aim to estimat e the proportion of patients experiencing moderate or 
marked improvement in overall symptom score.  With a target sample size of 24 patients, 95% confidence 
limits will extend ±0.2 from the estimate. If the estimated  improvement rate is 60%, the 95% CI will extend 
from 40% to 80%, indicating that there is a 95% probability that the true percent experiencing moderate or marked improvement is ≥40%. This response rate would be  of clinical importance.  
 The maximum number of subjects to be recruited was determined at 32, assuming a 33.3% rate of 
exclusion or withdrawal by [CONTACT_352029].
 
 
B. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
 
1. Describe the characteristics and provide justification  for inclusion of the proposed 
subject population. At a minimum include information about the age and gender of the 
study population.  
2. Describe different subject groups (e.g., students and teachers; control group and 
treatment group(s), children and adults) separately. 
 
 
University of [LOCATION_004]-Irvine urogynecology patients,  who are exclusively female.  In addition IC/PBS 
disproportionately affects women.  The study popul ation will be women [ADDRESS_437879]

4. If exclusion  is based on age, gender, pregnancy/childbearing potential, social/ethnic group, 
or language spoken (e.g., Non-English Speakers), provide a scientific rationale .  
 
 
We will be including only women over 18 years of age in our study for the practical reason that subjects 
will be recruited from the UCIMC urogynecology clinic .  We are excluding women who are pregnant or 
attempting pregnancy based on manufacturer recommendations for the PTNS device.  We will be excluding non-English speaking patients given that ou r survey and validated questionnaires are only in 
English.

protected. Note: This is not the same as confidentiality (see the Privacy and 
Confidentiality web page).  
 
 
Subjects will be recruited during routine patie nt care by [CONTACT_352036].  If a patient in clinic is thought to be 
eligible for PTNS and the study, they will be asked if they are interested in learning more about the study, if they would like to discuss it then or at a later time and how they would like to be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  
The review of the consent form with the subject will take place in a private patient area within the urogynecology clinic in order to mainta in privacy of all potential subjects.   
 
Additionally, one of the approved study investigators will pre-screen the physician clinic schedules for the 
Division of Urogynecology in the Department of Ob/Gyn and identify patients with Interstitial 
Cystitis/Painful Bladder syndrome who may qualify for th e study.  The treating physician will be alerted 
that she has a potential subject on her schedule and will re view to see if she feels the patient qualifies.  If 
yes, then the physician will ask the patient if they might be interested in the study and if so, an IRB 
approved researcher will review the study and consent with them to appropriately enroll the patient.

SECTION 7: RISK ASSESSMENT AND POSSIBLE BENEFITS 
Note: Review of the instructions for this section is strongly recommended.  
 A. Risk Assessment 
 
Place an “ X” in the bracket [   ] next to the level of review (based upon the investigator’s risk 
assessment). 
 
 
[   ] This study involves greater than minimal risk to subjects and requires Full Committee 
review. 
 [ X ] This study involves no more than minimal risk and qualifies as Expedited research.  
Provide justification below for the level of review and for the applicable Expedited 
Category(ies) that you have chosen:   
 
 Category 9 – Continuing review of research, not  conducted under an investigational new drug 
application or investigational device exemption wher e Expedited review categories two through eight do 
not apply but the IRB has determined and documented at a convened meeting (during the initial review) 
that the research involves no greater than minimal ri sk and no additional risks have been identified. 
 
 
B. Risks and Discomforts  
 
1. Describe the risks/potential discomforts  (e.g., physical, psychological, social, economic) 
associated with each intervention or research procedure.   
2. Describe the expected frequency (i.e., probability ) of a given side effect or harm and its 
severity (e.g., mild, moderate, severe).   
3. If subjects are restricted from receiving standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_352015], describe the 
risks of those restrictions. 
4. If collecting identifiable private information, address the risk of a potential breach of 
confidentiality . 
 
PTNS is typi[INVESTIGATOR_352016] l side effects.  The more common physical risks 
associated with PTNS treatment are low.  The most common side-effects include:  
- transient mild pain or discomfort at or near the stimulation site 
- skin inflammation at or near the stimulation site.   
In the experience of our clinic, the probability of this  kind of mild reaction is low (<10% of the time).  
Subjects must be positioned before each treatment so as to minimize positional discomfort during the 30 
minute treatment session.  
 
Rare, but potentially serious risks as stated by [CONTACT_352038], include 
- bleeding or hematoma at the needle site 
- numbness of the toes 
- stomach ache  
Additional risks to be included  in the consent form are:  
Unknown risks: There may be risks related to the resear ch that we don't know about yet.  The subjects will 
UCI IRB Approved: 07-05-2017 | MOD# [ZIP_CODE] | HS# 2015-2010
16 of 24
   be informed of any additional risks to which they mi ght be exposed, and any changes that are made to the 
study, as a result of any newly identified risks.   
Reproductive Risks:  Subjects will be informed that they  should not get pregnant while in this study. The 
PTNS therapy used in this study has not been evaluated in pregnant women and while no specific risks are 
anticipated, it is not recommended to become pregnant  while receiving PTNS therapy. It will be suggested 
that subjects check with the research ers about what types of birth control, or pregnancy prevention, to use 
while in this study. 
While subjects will be restricted from receiving new a dditional standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_352017], there is very limited risk associated with this because they will only be restricted during the course 
of the study protocol.  Patients will be permitted to c ontinue standard of care oral medical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (such 
as pyridium, Elmiron, or other medications considered second line in the AUA guidelines for treatment of IC/PBS) if they had been receiving this medication prio r to enrollment in the trial protocol.  If they so 
choose, they will be able to receive any other a dditional indicated treatments immediately following 
conclusion of the trial prot ocol.  If they choose to withdraw from the study in order to receive another 
indicated (standard) therapy that will be noted and included in our results.  Any subject who withdraws will 
be offered an appointment with her physician.
 
PHI will be collected as part of this study. Breach of confidentiality is a theoretical risk. 
 
 
5. Discuss what steps have been taken and/or will be taken to prevent and minimize  any 
risks/ potential discomforts to subjects (address physical risks as well as other risks such as 
the potential for a breach of confidentiality).  Examples include: designing the study to make 
use of procedures involving less risk when appropriate; minimizing study procedures by 
[CONTACT_352039]; mitigating risks by 
[CONTACT_352040]. 
 
All subjects will be carefully monitored throughout th e study protocol.  They will have weekly visits 
with a trained, urogyneology practitioner who will be administering the PTNS treatments.  This provider 
is qualified to assess and triage complaints rela ted to the PTNS procedure and will contact [CONTACT_352041].  The practitioner administering the 
PTNS treatments will work with the subject, in the sta ndard fashion for PTNS, to minimize any transient 
discomfort during the treatments.  Subjects may return to UCIMC urogynecology clinic for additional visits outside of  the study protocol at 
their own discretion, if there are any complaints they  feel need to be assessed by a physician.  We will 
work to minimize inconvenience associated with study participation by [CONTACT_352042], within clinic scheduling ability.  We will prevent any possible risks to the subjects from breach of confidentiality through the methods 
outlined in Section 12. 
 
 
C. Potential Benefits  
 
1. Discuss the potential benefits that may accrue directly to subjects.   Note: Compensation 
is not a benefit. Do not include it in this section.  
 
 
[   ] There is no direct benefit anticipated for the subjects. 
       OR 
 
UCI IRB Approved: 07-05-2017 | MOD# [ZIP_CODE] | HS# 2015-[ADDRESS_437883] may experience an 
improvement in her IC/PBS symptoms because of the treatment intervention with PTNS.  If the subject 
does experience improvement in symptoms, they may derive direct benefit by [CONTACT_352043], more 
invasive interventions for the treatment of this condition. 
 
If the subject completes 12 treatment visits and returns the subsequent 24 hour voiding diary and 
questionnaires, they will receive a $50 check as a stipend.  
 
2. Describe the potential societal/scientific benefit(s) that may be expected from this study.   
 
 Information obtained from this study will benefit the urogynecologic, urologic and medical communities 
in determining if additional studies investigating the use of PTNS for the treatment of symptoms related 
to IC/PBS is useful.  If the study intervention is found to be efficacious, this could be a significant 
contribution to the management of this chronic di sease.  If the study intervention is not found to reduce 
symptoms, additional information about the pathophy siology of the disease and the mechanism of action 
of both PTNS and SNM may be obtained.  This will also  allow for future research to be better directed 
elsewhere. 
 
 D. Risk/Benefit Assessment
 
 
Explain why the study risks are reasonable in relation to the potential benefits to subjects and 
society. 
 
 This study has the potential to evaluate if a minimally  invasive, rapid, outpatient treatment may be useful 
in the treatment of the complex disease of IC/PBS.  There are few risks associated with the study. 
Procedure associated risks as outlined in section 7.B. ar e rare and typi[INVESTIGATOR_352018].  These are 
the same possible treatment risks if the patient elect ed to undergo treatment with PTNS as standard of 
care for their symptoms.  Study specific risks are minimal and related to possible breach of 
confidentiality.  Given that few procedure and stud y risks (and very few serious risks) have been 
reported in studies examining our treatment interventi on (PTNS) for other indications, the potential to 
add a new treatment to the armamentarium with which to approach IC/PBS has significant value to contribute to society while exposing the subjects to minimal risk.   PTNS is a proven (and FDA-
approved) treatment for the symptoms of urinary ur gency and frequency, both of which are hallmarks of 
IC/PBS.  Patients with urinary urgency or frequency a nd IC/PBS may benefit from the targeted treatment 
of such symptoms with PTNS.  If PTNS is ultimately effective in treating these and other symptoms of 
IC/PBS, the subjects in the study will have benef ited from receiving this intervention and society will 
benefit from added information to the scien tific literature to guide future research. 
 
 
 
SECTION 8: ALTERNATIVES TO PARTICIPATION 
 
 
1. Describe the standard or usual care  activities at UCI (or study site) that are available to 
prospective subjects who do not enroll in this study, as applicable.   
2. Describe other appropriate alternative procedures  to study participation that are 
available to prospective subjects. 
3. If no alternatives exist, indicate that the only alternative is non-participation 
 
UCI IRB Approved: 07-05-2017 | MOD# [ZIP_CODE] | HS# 2015-2010
18 of 24
    
[   ] No alternatives exist. The only alternative to s ubjects is not to participate in the study. 
 
      OR 
 
Subjects will be informed that it is not necessary for subj ects to participate in this study in order to treat 
their IC/PBS. Subjects will also be informed that th ere are other treatments available in the community 
including physical therapy techniques and pharmacothe rapi[INVESTIGATOR_352019], better or worse than what the subject may experience in this study. This will be discussed 
prior to enrollment into the study.  If patients choose not to enroll in this study but have symptoms for 
which PTNS is indicated, they may still receive this as a possible therapy. 
 
 
 SECTION 9: ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING/MANA GEMENT AND COMPENSATION FOR INJURY   
 
A. Adverse Events and Unanticipated Problems  
 
1. Indicate that you are familiar with UCI’s Adverse Events/Unanticipated Problems reporting 
policy and procedures.  See http://www.research.uci.edu/compliance/human-research-
protections/researchers/reporting-of- adverse-events-unanticipated-problems-and-
violations.html  for details. 
 
 
[   ] Although this study involves no interaction/intervention with research subjects  (i.e., 
involves the use of records, charts, biospecimens) an unanticipated problem may still occur (e.g., a breach in confidentiality),  the researchers are aware of UCI’s Unanticipated 
Problems involving Risk to Participants or Others reporting policy and procedures and will 
comply with this policy.  
 [ X ] This study involves interaction/intervention with research subjects. The researchers 
are aware of UCI’s Unanticipated Problems involving Risk to Participants or Others 
reporting policy and procedures and will comply with this policy. 
 
 
2. If this study involves interaction/intervention with research subjects, explain how the 
research team will manage adverse events and unanticipated problems that may occur 
during the study or after completion of the study (i.e., provide a plan).   
 
 
[   ] Not applicable - This study involves no interaction/intervention  with research subjects 
(i.e., involves the use of records, charts, and/or biospecimens). 
 
OR 
 If an adverse event occurs during the study, the steps are as follows: 
1) Subject informs the physician, clinic nurse or anot her research team member of the possible adverse 
event.
 
2) Study physician determines if it is, in fact, an a dverse event that is related to the study protocol.  
3) Physician decides an appropriate medical respon se within a reasonable timeframe.  This includes 
coordinating urgent care if indicated.  
4) The adverse even is reported appropriately within  the timeframe noted below depending on the nature 
of the adverse event.  
UCI IRB Approved: 07-05-2017 | MOD# [ZIP_CODE] | HS# 2015-[ADDRESS_437884] learns of the event,  followed by [CONTACT_352044]-up reports as applicable.  
 All adverse events will be followed to appropriate resolution. Where appropriate, medical tests and examinations are performed to document resolution of event(s).  
 
 
B. Compensation for Injury  
 
For Full Committee protocols , explain how costs of treatment for research related injury will 
be covered.  
  
 
[   ]  Not applicable - This study involves no more than minimum risk and qualifies as 
Expedited research.  
 
[ X ]  Researchers are familiar with and will follow UC policy regarding treatment and 
compensation for injury. If subjects are injured as a result of being in the study, UCI will 
provide necessary medical treatment. The costs of the treatment may be covered by [CONTACT_352045], the study sponsor, or billed to subject or the subject’s insurer just 
like other medical costs, depending on a number of factors. The University and the study 
sponsor do not normally provide any other form of compensation for injury.  
 [   ]  Other:  <Type here> 
  
SECTION 10: PARTICIPANT COSTS
  
 
 
1. If subjects or their insurers will be charged for study procedures, identify and describe 
those costs.   
2. Explain why it is appropriate to charge those cost  to the subjects or their insurers.  
Provide supporting documentation as applicable (e.g., FDA Device letter supporting 
charges). 
 
 
[   ] Not applicable - This study involves no interaction/intervention with research subjects (i.e., 
involves the use of records, charts, biospecimens). 
 
[   ] There are no costs to subjects/insurers. 
      
 OR  
 PTNS is an FDA approved device for the treatment of  “urinary urgency, urinary frequency and urge 
incontinence.”   It is typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a covered benefit of health  insurance as a second line treatment for these 
complaints and all subjects will be required to qualify for PTNS based on the FDA approved indications 
of urinary frequency and urgency.

audio/video tapes, biospecimens, etc.  
 
Note: If the research data includes subject identifiable private information and/or Protected 
Health Information, the storage devices or the electronic research files must be encrypted.    
 
 
Electronic Data (check all that apply): 
[ X ]  Coded data; code key is kept separate from data in secure location. 
[   ]  Data includes subject identifiable information.  Note: Encryption software is     
       required. (Provide rationale for maintaining subject identifiable info) : <Type here>  
[ X ]  Data will be stored on secure network server.  
[   ]  Data will be stored on stand alone desktop computer (not connected to  
       network/internet) 
[   ] Other (specify here): <Type here>  
 
Hardcopy Data, Recordings and Biospecimens (check all that apply): 
[   ] Coded data; code key is kept separate from data in secure location. 
[   ] Data includes subject identifiable information (Provide rationale for maintaining subject 
identifiable info) : <Type here>  
[ X ] Data will be stored in locked file cabinet or locked room at UCI/UCIMC.  
[   ] Data will be stored locked lab/refrigerator/freezer at UCI/UCIMC. 
[   ] Other (specify here): <Type here>  
 
 
Data on Portable Devices:  
4. Describe the portable device(s) to be used  (e.g. laptop, PDA, iPod, portable hard drive 
including flash drives).  
5. Specify whether subject identifiable data  will be stored on the device. If so, justify why  it is 
necessary to store subject identifiers on the device.  
 
Note: Only the “minimum data necessary” should be stored on portable devices  as these 
devices are particularly susceptible to loss or theft. If there is a necessity to use portable devices 
for initial collection of identifiable private information, the portable storage devices or the 
research files MUST BE ENCRYPTED , and subject identifiers transferred to a secure system as 
soon as possible.

where the data will be published and/or presented  and address how the study team will 
obtain permission from subjects. 
 
Note:  Authorized UCI personnel such as the research team and the IRB, the study sponsor (if 
applicable), and regulatory entities such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the 
Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP), may have access to study records to protect 
subject safety and welfare.  Any study data that identifies the subjects should not be voluntarily 
released or disclosed without the subjects’ separate consent, except as specifically required by 
[CONTACT_2371].  Publications and/or presentations that result from this study should not include subject 
identifiable information; unless the subject’s separate consent has been obtained. 
 
 
[   ] Not applicable – No subject identifiers will be collected.

Data Retention:  
9. Explain how long subject identifiable research data  will be retained. The data may 
include a code with a separate code key or the data may include subject identifiers.   
 
Notes:   
 If more than one of the options below is applicable  [e.g., the study involves children], 
records should be kept for the longer period . 
 Research documentation involving Protected Health Information (PHI) should be retained for 
six years (e.g., IRB documentation, consent/assent forms – NOT  the actual PHI).  Investigators 
must destroy PHI at the earliest opportunity, consistent with the conduct of this study, unless 
there is an appropriate justification for retaining the identifiers or as required by [CONTACT_2371].

2.0 Background 
2.1 Significance of Research Question/Purpose  
New Ulm at HOME (NU- HOME) is a unique research collaboration between leaders in a 
rural community and academic obesity researchers. The proposed partnerships include the 
University of Minnesota (UMN), New Ulm local health care system (Allina Health), 
Minneapolis Heart Institute Foundation (MHIF), Brown County Public Health, local elementary schools, UMN extension service, local colleges and several existing community stakeholder groups. Our long -term goal is to establish a sustainable, effective intervention 
to prevent excess weight gain in children in rural communities. The objective of the proposed research is to test the effecti veness of the NU -HOME program, a family meals -
focused health promotion intervention to prevent excess weight gain among 7- 10 year old 
children (n=120) in the New Ulm rural community.  
 
2.2 Preliminary Data  
PROTOCOL TITLE:  New Ulm at HOME (NU- HOME)  
VERSION DATE: 4/22/ 19 
 
Our research team has completed extensive preliminary studies to support the proposed 
research, including a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2269] (RCT) (NIH R21 -DK0072997), a full -
scale urban RCT (NIH R01- DK084000), a survey of rural parents and several adult -focused 
rural health promotion programs (HONU).  
 
Healt hy Home Offerings via the Mealtime Environment (HOME) pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]. The HOME pi[INVESTIGATOR_517549] (Fulkerson et al., 2011)  and a two- arm RCT to 
prevent childhood obesity  (Fulkerson et al.,  2010) . We successfully met feasibility and 
acceptability aims for recruitment (n=44), retention (100%) and implementation (5 -
sessions). The intervention included interactive family nutrition education activities, child 
cooking skills development, t aste-testing, parent  groups (meal planning and preparation 
support), and hands -on meal preparation with the entire family.  Satisfaction and attendance 
were high; 86% of families attended at least four of five sessions. Significant  intervention 
effects were found at post -intervention for increased child food preparation skills (M=17.5 
vs. 15.2,  p<.01) and parental report of children helpi[INVESTIGATOR_517550] (M=1.9 vs. 1.6, 
p<.01). Intervention versus  control homes showed trends of higher fruit and vegetable 
availability (M=23.7 vs. 21.7, p=.12) and lower  availability of quick, high -fat microwaveable 
foods (M=2.3 vs. 3.0, p=.11). Trends of higher intakes of fruits and vegetables (M=3.5 vs. 
2.6 servings, p=.08) and lower intakes of sweetened beverages (M=0.4 vs. 0.7 servings,  
p=.09) among intervention compared to control children were also apparent. As expected in 
this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we did not see significant BMI change differences by [CONTACT_517558]-intervention.  
 
HOME Plus full -scale trial. The recently completed full -scale HOME Plus study RCT 
(interventi on and  attention- only control) with 160 families (8- 12 year -old child and 
parent/guardian) was conducted in urban  communities using a staggered cohort design 
(two cohorts)  (Fulkerson et al., 2014) . Eligibility included child BMI>50th percentile;  English 
literacy; no plans to move within 6 months; and no severe medical conditions prohibiting 
study  participation. Recruitment and baseline assessments occurred in summers of 2011 
(Cohort 1) and 2012 (Cohort 2), followed by [CONTACT_17628] (n=81 intervention famili es, 
n=79 control families). Participants were representative of the larger county; 71% white 
(child), 44% overweight/obese (child), 35% household received economic assistance, with 
full representation of the economic range; however, HOME Plus parents were more  likely to 
have a college degree (61%). Data collection was very successful with 100% compliance at 
baseline,  93% retention at post -intervention and 89% at follow -up (21- months post 
randomization). Each assessment  included psychosocial surveys and anthropometry 
(parent and child), puberty assessment (child), three 24- hour dietary recalls (child), home 
food inventory (parent), and a family meal inventory of 7 dinners (parent).  
Families randomized to the intervention attended 10 monthly sessions deliv ered by [CONTACT_517559] (approximately 5- 10 families) in community 
settings. Other family members also attended sessions or childcare (75% of families 
brought additional family members). The intervention focused  on experi ential activities and 
included parent discussion groups, hands -on nutrition activities, taste- testing, and family 
meal preparation. Participation was high with 68% of families attending at least 7 of 10 in-
person sessions and 84% completing at least [ADDRESS_671144] -hoc stratification analyses  
were conducted to assess effects on BMI -z-scores by [CONTACT_517560]; findings indicated a 
statistically  significant pubertal onset -by-treatment group interaction at both post -

VERSION DATE: 4/22/ 19 
 
intervention (p=0.01) and follow -up (p=0.02). Sub -group analyses indicated a main effect of 
treatment among prepubescent children only, at both post-intervention (p=0.03) and follow -
up (p=0.001). These findings su ggest family meals -focused programming may be 
efficacious to prevent children’s excess weight gain prior to pubertal onset. Thus, the 
proposed study is justified in using BMI -z-score as the primary outcome and recruiting [ADDRESS_671145] 2014 to gather information from 
rural parents (n=174) about their  family meal behaviors and interest in attending a progr am, 
such as the one proposed. Parents were eligible if  1) s/he was the family’s primary meal 
preparer; 2) had a child between the ages of 8- [ADDRESS_671146] 50% of the 
time; and 3) had a rural zip code. Rural was defined using ZIP Rural -Urba n Commuting 
Area  Codes (RUCA)  (unpublished data) . Using RUCA codes allowed rural participants to 
be divided into groups from isolated, small  rural, and large rural communities. Results 
indicated 80% of rural families eat family meals 4 or more days per  week, comparable to 
the national (78.4%) rate (http://mchb.hrsa.gov/nsch/2011- 12/health/index.html). Nearly  
three quarters of participants (73%) said they would be interested in attending in- person 
community -based family sessions focused on cooking and healthy eating. Of those 
interested, the majority (70%) was also interested in an online component; most parents 
(91%) reported ready access to the internet. Families  reported driving long distances for 
everyday routine activities (e.g., traveling an average of 11 -15 miles to work,  for healthcare 
or to purchase groceries) and were willing to travel an average of [ADDRESS_671147] aimed at reducing adult myocardial infarctions 
and modifiable heart disease risk factors in the rural community of New Ulm  (Boucher 
2008) (VanWormer et al., 2012) . New Ulm is located about [ADDRESS_671148] of the Twin 
Cities metropolitan area in an agricultural region of the state. Healthcare is provided 
primarily by [CONTACT_517561]  (Allina Health) that operates in New Ulm as New Ulm Medical 
Center (NUMC), the only clinic and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (35 beds) located in the community. The 
HONU Project is a collaborative partnership of Allina,  the Minneapolis  Heart Institute 
Foundation (MHIF), NUMC and the community. The MHIF leads design and 
implementation of  the project through partnership with NUMC and the community. The 
project has primaril y been funded through grants to MHIF from Allina, CDC, USDA and 
foundations. The community is represented by a 12- member  steering committee that 
includes representation from NUMC, New Ulm city officials, Chamber of Commerce,  school 
district and local colle ges, Brown County Public Health, community organizations and the 
general public  (including parents). The committee provides input on strategies to ensure 
interventions are tailored to New Ulm  community audiences and helps promote community 
engagement. Research and evaluation work is  coordinated by [CONTACT_517562].  For evaluation purposes, the target population of HONU 
interventions is adults ages 40- 79 residing in the  [ZIP_CODE] zip code (13,290 adults; includes 
New Ulm). Base line assessments (2009) of dietary intake and  obesity showed only 17% of 
New Ulm adults ate 5+ servings/day of fruits and vegetables, well below  guidelines, and 
35% of adults were overweight and 41% were obese (Van Wormer  et al.,  2012) . These 
health indicators along with lower median household income indicate these adults are at 
risk for continued poor health. Building on lessons  learned, HONU approaches improving 
population health through adult - focused interventions integrated into healthcare, worksites, 
and the larger community by [CONTACT_517563]. A recent evaluation found

VERSION DATE: 4/22/ [ADDRESS_671149] programs was  associated with 
significantly higher odds of blood pressure control two years later among thos e with  
uncontrolled blood pressure at baseline (Sillah et al., 2014) . With national trends for 
hypertension remaining stable for the last  decade, this decrease is exciting. In 2011 -2012, 
approximately 500 residents registered for a holiday weight  management program. Seventy 
percent of those retained (280 -300), either maintained (18%) or lost (52%)  weight, with 
mean weight loss of 4.[ADDRESS_671150] primarily focused on 
environmental reengineering to increase  availability of healthful options in restaurants, 
grocery stores and convenience stores  (Pereira et al., 2014) ; community -wide health 
marketing campaigns; adult nutrition education and weight management; and school -based 
initiatives to  improve food at concessions.  
 
2.3 Existing Literature  
Childhood obesity is a serious public health problem  (Ogden et al., 2014 ; NIH, 2011) . 
Although previous environmental approaches to obesity prevention show some promise, 
few studies significantly engage parents or focus on the home environment, which is 
essential to promote healthful behaviors at home. Parents are primary role models for 
healthful eating (Draxten et al., 2014)  and activity  (Trost et al., 2011)  and gatekeepers for 
food and beverage availability and degree of inactivity at home. Moreover, for children, the 
home setting is where most calories and energy dense foods are consumed (Briefel et al., 
2009)  and where most sedentary behavior occurs, particularly screen time (Rideout et al., 
2010)  (e.g., television). Children in rural communities are particularly vulnerable regarding 
increased risk for obesity and diabetes  (USDHHS, 2011 ; Singh et al., 2010 ; Lutfiyya et al., 
2007; Rockeymoore et al., 2014; NAC on Rural Health , 2011) ; owing in part to poverty  
(Lutifiyya et al., 2007)  and lower access to healthful foods and physical activity 
opportunities  (Yousefian  et al.,   2011; Seguin et al., 2014) . Thus, effective programs that 
engage families in rural communities to prevent excess  weight gain among children are 
critically needed.  
 
3.0 Study Endpoints/Events/Outcomes  
3.1 Primary Endpoints/Events/Outcomes  
Primary aim: To test the effectiveness of the NU -HOME program, a family -based health 
promotion intervention to prevent excess weight gain among [ADDRESS_671151] significantly lower body 
mass index z -scores (BMIz), relative to children in the control group at post -intervention (7 
months), after adjustment for baseline values.  
 3.2 Secondary Endpoints/Events/Outcomes  
Secondary aims: To examine intervention effects on the following family - and chil d-level 
outcomes:  
1) Home availability of healthful foods and beverages and quality of those served at family meals and snacks.  
2) Children’s dietary intake (e.g., calories, fruits and vegetables, sugar -sweetened 
beverages).  
3) Children’s minutes of modera te-to-vigorous physical activity and sedentary behavior per 
week, particularly screen time.  
 
4.0 Study Interventions /Interactions  
4.1 Description  
PROTOCOL TITLE:  New Ulm at HOME (NU- HOME)  
VERSION DATE: 4/22/ 19 
 
The research design includes qualitative research and a randomized controlled trial. We 
will be conducting the researc h in several stages.  
 
Stage 1: Planning and adaptation (months 1- 12). Stage 1 will focus on establishing a  
Steering Committee  (larger community group) and an Action Team (specific team of 
community partners to put decisions into action) . These groups will use a Community -
Based Participatory Research (CBPR) approach to adapt the HOME Plus program (shown to be effective in an urban community) for a rural community. Members of the Action  Team  
will meet monthly for the first year to determine how to adapt the HOME Plus program for 
rural families. During committee meetings, community assets will be mapped to facilitate 
buy-in and ensure inclusion of necessary partners, and assess and finalize our  strategies. 
A logic model of the relationships between program resources, activities, outputs and 
outcomes will be created using a graphical depi[INVESTIGATOR_517551].  
 
An ongoing evaluat ion of the extent to which CBPR principles are followed will be 
conducted. Thus, we will develop guidelines to describe the academic/community partnership and how decisions were made. Committee members will complete a CBPR 
survey  that assesses decision- making processes for: 1) participant involvement, 2) shapi[INVESTIGATOR_517552]/scope of research, 3) research implementation and context, and 4) nature of 
research outcomes. (Change in protocol to submit survey items and Action Team Consent 
Form approved 10/12/16 .) Committees will also use a RE -AIM framework to assess Reach, 
Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance to address real world contexts of research translation.        
Stage 2: Randomized controlled trial (Years 2 -5). Planning will be followed by a  
randomized controlled trial (RCT) in rural New Ulm. Participants will include 120 7 -10 year - 
old children and their primary meal -preparing parent/guardian.  
 
Study participants will be recruited using multiple methods. Recruitment will be conducted  
by [CONTACT_517564], including area schools, Allina Health, New Ulm 
Medical Center physicians, UMN Extension Service, Brown County Public Health and 
community organizations. We will use direct mailing, flyers, presentations and other publi c 
announcement delivery channels. At some events, families will be given a small trinket to 
increase interest in learning about the program.  Trinkets will be of minimal monetary value 
($1.00 or less) and will include items such as fruit and vegetable stres s balls, pens, note 
pads, jump ropes and indoor Frisbees. Current study participants will also be contact[CONTACT_517565].  All recruitment materials will direct interested families to contact [CONTACT_517566]. Study staff will also be available to screen 
interested families in person at recruitment events.  An o pen access website page will 
house study information for potential participants and control group families  to facilitate 
recruitment for the RCT. As part of our recruitment strategy, we will use  personal health 
records available to a study Co- Investigator ([CONTACT_517582], a  community partner 
from Allina Health who was awarded a subcontract) to identify potentially eligible 
participants for a recruitment mailing. The UMN academic researchers on the team will not 
have access to PHI. Dr . Abbey Sidebottom  will access medical rec ords at the New Ulm 
Medical Center to identify parent names and addresses of children who are eligible to 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  New Ulm at HOME (NU- HOME)  
VERSION DATE: 4/22/ 19 
 
participate in the NU -HOME study (i.e., they will be 7 -10 years old). This information will 
only be used to send an introduction letter (from Allina Health) about the study and invite 
the parent to participate. [CONTACT_517583] will not send PHI to the UMN  researchers and it 
will not be retained as research data.  
 
Participants will complete measurements at three time points: baseline (before  
randomization), at post intervention (8 -10 months after randomization) and at follow -up (14-  
[ADDRESS_671152] randomization). At  baseline, adult participants will provide written consent  
for participation and children will provide written assent. Data collection will be conducted in  
a quasi -group format (individual families working with individual staff) in convenient  
community locations,  simultaneously. Based on our previous work, baseline assessments  
should take 1.5 -2 hours, with shorter subse quent assessments. Trained study -staff will  
measure the height  and weight of the adult and child participants. Online surveys will be  
completed on an electronic device (laptop, ipad, phone)  by [CONTACT_517567] (e.g., home food availability, family meal frequency and environment, nutritional quality of foods served at meals and snacks) and individual -level data (physical  
activity, usual fruit and vegetables intake). The parent and child will also participate in two  
interviews about the food the child ate  in the past 24- hours. ( Change in protocol f rom  
child interview to parent and child interview and from three to two interviews  was approved  
4/24/17 .) The child will also wear an accelerometer to assess their physical activity. The  
child participant will also complete surveys to assess individual level data (e.g., fruit and  
vegetable preferences ). Children will also complete two additional midpoi nt measurements.    
 
During the two additional short data collection visit s, child participant’s height and weight  
will be measured  and they will  answer questions about physical activity , particularly at  
school,  and healthy eating.  (Change in protocol for additional child measurement  was  
approved 4/24/17 .) Children will be me asured after school, removed briefly from class 
during school or measured at their home.  Principals have provided support for measuring 
students at school and parents will be notified in advance of the measurements by [CONTACT_3649], 
email, or letter (depending on t heir preferred method of communication).  
 
Following baseline data collection, families will be randomized to the intervention program 
(NU- HOME; n=60 families) or a delayed intervention (n=60 families) in a staggered cohort 
design (two cohorts). The 7- month NU -HOME program aims to prevent childhood obesity 
by [CONTACT_517568]/guardians to prepare regular, nutritionally -sound 
and appropriately -portioned snacks and meals eaten together and by [CONTACT_517569], particularly screen time. The NU -HOME intervention program will promote 
physical activity through the existing programs of our community partners and resources in 
the community as well as through the study website. The 7- month intervention will be 
delivered to multiple family groups in convenient community setting s. Intervention families 
will participate in seven monthly, two- hour sessions. All household members will be invited 
to participate in the sessions, as the inclusion of the entire family will facilitate comprehensive support for increasing the healthfulnes s of the home environment. Sessions 
will include an introduction and food preparation with all family members, separate adult and child sessions, and end with concluding statements, home activity assignments and enjoyment of a large group “family meal.” T he Research Team will develop a website for 
intervention participants. (Change in protocol to provide UMN accounts for intervention 
participants on secure UMN website developed specifically for the NU -HOME study was 
approved 10/2/17 .) Intervention families will be allowed access with a secure, password 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  New Ulm at HOME (NU- HOME)  
VERSION DATE: 4/22/ [ADDRESS_671153] access to sessions that will be augmented online and will 
cover session content, video demonstrations and session materials (e.g., recipes) for both 
parents and children. The Re search Team will coordinate with Heart of New Ulm (HONU) 
webmasters to link the  NU-HOME  website to the HONU main webpage after the research 
is complete . Intervention staff will establish and maintain rapport with families in sessions 
and will support famil ies by [CONTACT_517570]. Calls will use 
established protocols to employ motivational interviewing techniques such as reflective listening, agenda setting, and eliciting change talk to set goals and support behavior change and self -monitoring.  All data collected as part of these calls will be entered in a 
secure REDCap database.  
 Stage 3 (Year 5): Delayed intervention. Our program design includes a wait -list control 
group and a “train the trainers” model to facilitate good will, stakeholder satisfaction and 
sustainability. Wait -list control group families will be able to receive the NU -HOME program 
after follow -up data collection.  
 
Stage 4 (Year 5): Dissemination. The dissemination phase will begin with meetings 
between the Steering C ommittee , Action Team and Research Team  to decide on timing of 
and venues for dissemination. We expect venues will include traditional academic journals, 
research conferences, technical and lay reports (to parents, health care professionals, 
stakeholders),  local non- research conferences at schools, community events, and media.  
 
5.0 Procedures Involved  
5.1 Study Design 
The research design includes both a Community -Based Participatory Research design in 
the initial phases to adapt the existing program for use in a rural community as well as a 
Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) to test the modified program with [ADDRESS_671154] es to adapt the existing program for use with rural families. During committee 
meetings, community assets will be mapped to facilitate buy -in and ensure inclusion of 
necessary partners, and assess and finalize our strategies. A logic model of the 
relationships between program resources, activities, outputs and outcomes will be created 
using a graphical depi[INVESTIGATOR_517553] . An ongoing evaluation of the extent to which CBPR principles  
are followed will be conducted through CBPR surveys.  (Change in protocol to submit 
survey items and Action Team Consent Form was approved 10/12/16 .)     
 
During the RCT, 120 7- 10 year -old chil dren and their primary meal -preparing 
parent/guardian will complete measurements at three time points: baseline (before 
randomization), at post intervention (8 -10 months after randomization) and at follow -up (14-
[ADDRESS_671155] randomization). At the baseli ne visit, adult participants will provide written 
consent for participation and children will provide written assent. Trained study -staff will 
measure the height and weight of the adult and child participants. Online surveys will be

VERSION DATE: 4/22/ 19 
 
completed on an electro nic device ( laptop, ipad, phone)  by [CONTACT_517571] (e.g., home food availability, family meal frequency and environment, 
nutritional quality of foods served at meals and snacks) and individual -level data (physical 
activity, usual fruit and vegetables intake). The parent and child will also participate in two 
interviews about the food the child had to eat in the past 24- hours. ( Change in protocol for 
child interview to parent and child interview and from three to two interviews approved 
4/24/17 .) The child will also wear an accelerometer to assess their physical activity. The 
child participant will also complete surveys to assess individual level data (e.g., fruit and vegetable preferences).

5.4 Individually Identifiable Health Information  
In ou r initial application, we completed appendix H and were awarded a waiver of HIPAA 
authorization requirement. As part of our recruitment strategy, we proposed using personal 
health records available to a study Co- Investigator ([CONTACT_517582], a community 
partner from Allina Health who was awarded a subcontract) t o identify potentially eligi ble 
participants for a recruitment mailing. The UMN academic researchers on the team will not 
have access to PHI. Dr . Abbey Sidebottom  will access medical records at the New Ulm 
Medical Center to identify parent names and addresses of children who are eligible to participate in the NU -HOME study (i.e., they will be 7 -10 years old). This information will 
only be used to send an introduction letter (from Allina Health) about the study and invite 
the parent to participate. [CONTACT_517583] will not send PHI to the UMN  researchers and it 
will not be retained as research data. As enrollment begins, Dr . Sidebottom will compare 
names of enrolled parent s to her list of those included in the mailing so we can assess the 
effectiveness of this recruitment method; she will only share the aggregate information.  
 
As part of the research, the NU -HOME team w ill be collecting personal identifiable 
information in cluding full names, birthdays, telephone numbers, email addresses, and 
mailing addresses  of enrolled participants . Direct identifiers will be maintained so we can 
contact [CONTACT_4317] (by [CONTACT_2319], email, or telephone) to schedule their data collection visits,  
inform them of their randomization status, remind them of intervention session dates and conduct goal -setting phone calls.  We will contact [CONTACT_517572].  We will also ask both c hild and adult 
participants a separate question on the consent form asking for permission to take their 
photographs. Photos will be taken at intervention sessions to share with families and in 
presentations but will not be used as data. Participants are f ree to say YES or NO to the 
item on photographs  while continuing to participate in other research activities with the 
study . In all cases, the privacy of measurements for each child and parent will be 
maintained, and all measurements will be carried out in a sensitive, nonjudgmental and 
positive atmosphere.

After data entry, cleaning and linkage, a de -identified data set will be created which, along 
with associated  documentation, will be made available to users after analyses related to t he 
major aims of the study have been reported and only under a data- sharing agreement as 
suggested by [CONTACT_517573]: (1) a commitment to using the data only for 
research purposes and not to identify any individual participant; (2) a commitment to 
securing the data using appropriate  computer technology; and (3) a commitment to 
destroying or returning the data after analyses  are completed.  Any request for data will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_34355].  
 
7.0 Sharing of Results with Participants  
7.1 Describe Whether Results W ill Be Shared and H ow 
As part of the CBPR work with the Action Team  in stage 4 (Year 5) , decisions will be made 
as a group about when to share data wi th participants and the community, what data to 
share and how the data will be shared. Expected venues for sharing study results will include traditional academic journals, research conferences, technical and lay reports (to 
parents, health care professionals, and stakeholders), local non -research conferences at 
schools, community events, and media.  The Research Team has experience writing about 
main study findings in lay reports and disseminating to participants.

major towns included in Cohort 2 as well as a Spanish version of the flyer).   Families will be 
offered small trink ets to increase interest in learning about the research study.  Trinkets will 
be of minimal monetary value ($1.00 or less) and will include items such as fruit and 
vegetable stress balls, pens, note pads, jump ropes and indoor Frisbees.   
 12.5 Payment  
At each data collection visit, families will receive a $[ADDRESS_671167] for height and weight 
measurement and for completing surveys  that day. Over the following two weeks, they will 
receive an additional $[ADDRESS_671168] $[ADDRESS_671169] for completing the snack and evening 
meal screener surveys. Thus, if a family completes all of the planned data collection at 
each data collection period, they will receive $75 each time (total of $225 in gift cards per 
family if they complete all data collection at each of the 3 data collection time points) . 
(Change in protocol to break up the $75 payment into three separate $25 allotments was 
approved 4/26/17 .) Cohort 2 families who complete the interim child height and weight 
measurement will receive a $[ADDRESS_671170] compensation for attendance at intervention 
sessions (primary or delayed intervention); however, as a ttendance at each session is 
logged, participating families will receive a $[ADDRESS_671171] to compensate them for gas while

families may receive take- home groceries of the featured monthly fruit/vegetable. Families 
may also add their names for drawings for door prizes (e.g., kitchen equipment, pass to 
local physical activity facility) and a chance to win the opportunity to have a home visit by a 
chef. Participants will be notified that this is a drawing and not everyone will receive this 
incentive.  
 
13.0 Withdrawal of Participants 
13.1 Withdrawal Circumstances 
We do not anticipate  situation s where a participant would be withdrawn without their 
consent.  
 13.2 Withdrawal Procedures  
 
13.3 Termination Procedures 
As we do not anticipate terminating participants , if this situation arises, we will submit a 
change in protocol and receive approval before doing so.  
 
14.0 Risk to Participants  
14.1 Foreseeable Risks  
The study has minimal risks. Participants may feel uncomfortable answering questions 
about their own or their family's eating habits but they are told they can skip any survey 
questions they do not wish to answer.  Participants may also feel uncomfortable completing 
measurements as part of data collection in  a group setting; however, we provide partiti ons 
for pri vacy when measuring height and weight, do not indicate their height or weight 
verbally and provide separate tables between families for completion of surveys.  
Participants may have some conflict about changing the food offerings or television limits in 
their home; however, families will choose from several behavioral goals provided.

17.0 Data Management  
17.1 Data Analysis Plan  
Analysis plan. The analysis plan integrates our theoretical framework for behavior change 
and our temporal design. The analysis plan includes descriptive analyses, assessment of 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  New Ulm at HOME (NU- HOME)  
VERSION DATE: 4/22/ [ADDRESS_671174] controls will be assessed using chi -square tests for categorical data or two-
sample t -tests for compari sons of continuous data. Descriptive statistics of all outcome 
measures will be calculated at each assessment period. Inter -item correlations and internal 
consistency measures (i.e., Cronbach’s alpha) will also be calculated.  
 Primary outcome analyses. Fo r the analysis of the primary outcome of child BMI, a two-
step approach will be used. First, two- sample t -tests will be used to assess potential 
changes in age - and gender -adjusted child BMI z -scores from baseline to post -intervention 
(i.e., immediate chan ge). Second, baseline- adjusted analysis of covariance while adjusting 
for child age, gender, race and economic assistance will be performed. Analyses of 
associations with overweight status will be conducted with multivariate logistic regression 
while adjus ting for baseline BMI z -scores or BMI z -squared to allow for curvature. 
Sustained program effects will be assessed using a similar approach with follow -up BMI z -
scores.  
 
Intent -to-treat principle. All comparisons will be performed under the intent -to-treat principle 
(i.e., all randomized participants will be included and analyzed according to group 
assignment, regardless of compliance). A 5% two- sided type I error rate will be used to 
determine statistical significance. SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Instit ute Inc., Cary, NC, 
[LOCATION_003]) will be used for statistical analyses. Because the intervention is delivered in multiple 
family groups, we anticipate group facilitation effects (i.e., participants have greater benefits 
than if the intervention were delivered indi vidually). Thus, we will investigate intraclass 
correlations (ICCs) in the test for intervention effectiveness.  
 
Secondary outcome analyses . Secondary outcomes will be analyzed using the same 
approach as with the primary outcome. In addition, to compare st udy groups over time, 
linear mixed models with baseline measures, group, and time (baseline, post -intervention 
and follow -up) as fixed covariates will be fitted. Group by [CONTACT_517578]. Transformation will be considered to ensur e data normality. Other potential 
covariates (i.e., gender, age, education level, rural code) will be entered in models, if necessary. These models will assess between- group effects following randomization, 
within -group changes, and whether changes in the outcomes from baseline to post -
intervention or to follow -up differed between the groups (group x time interaction). Based 
on preliminary studies, we expect that intervention families will have changes in food 
availability and intake, physical activity and sedentary behaviors after receipt of the NU -
HOME program that will remain consistent  at follow -up. 
 
17.2 Power Analysis  
Power calculations are based on two assessment time points, correlation over time, and 
variability of age-  and gender -adjusted BMI z -scores. We propose to recruit 120 families 
(one eligible child and one parent per family) to allow for a 15% attrition rate with a final 
effective sample of about 100 families in the study by [CONTACT_129746] -up. Using child (<11 
years old) data from the HOME Plus trial, we estimated a within- child correlation (ρ) 
between the primary outcome measurements over time of 0.9. Utilizing a baseline- adjusted 
analysis approach, with a sample size of 96 (48 per group), we will be able to detect an 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  New Ulm at HOME (NU- HOME)  
VERSION DATE: 4/22/ [ADDRESS_671175] size (ES) of 0.25 for age-  and gender -adjusted BMI z -scores at 80% power. This 
effect size corresponds to approximately 1.4 kg decrease in average weight gain between 
intervention and control groups. This corresponding decrease was estimated using 
BMIi=M(1+LSzi)1/L formula with age- and gender -specific L,M,S parameters and average 
weight and height values for 8 -10 year old boys and girls [at 50th or higher percentile for 
weight].

Behavioral and HIPAA trainings. A copy of the consent forms will not be placed in the participants medical, educational or employment records.  
 
19.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Participants  
19.1 Date Safety Monitoring  
The intervention and measurement protocols pose minimal risk to participants. Because of 
this low risk status, the Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) for this trial focuses on close 
monitoring by [CONTACT_458] (PI) in conjunction with a safety officer  ([CONTACT_517584], a Professor with the School of Nursing at the University of Minnesota, Director of 
the Center for Adolescent Nursing, and Director of the Healthy Youth Development -
Prevention Research Center ). Safety reports will be sent to the PI, and the safety officer. 
The Evaluation Director will be responsible for assembling the data and producing these reports, as well as assuring that all parties obtain copi[INVESTIGATOR_96462]. We plan to collect 
injury data from the treatment and control (wait -list) group monthly during the 7- month 
intervention. We do not expect many injuries as a result of participating in the proposed 
intervention program. However, there is a possibility of injuries (e.g., minor burns, cuts) during the cooking component of the intervention. It is anticipated that mos t injuries related 
to cooking activities in a healthy child/parent population would be mild in nature and allow a 
complete return to the same activities after a brief recovery period. If necessary, alternative 
meal preparation activities (e.g., mixing, was hing) will be substituted during the brief 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  New Ulm at HOME (NU- HOME)  
VERSION DATE: 4/22/ 19 
 
recovery period. An A dverse Event Form will be used by [CONTACT_517579] a result of the intervention, particularly the cooking 
component. The safety officer will review, collate, and evaluate adverse events in real -time. 
Any serious adverse events reported to the University of Minnesota IRB will also be reported to the NIH funding institute. All adverse events will be evaluated by [CONTACT_517580] 72 hours and reported to the UMN IRB; serious 
adverse events within 24 hours. Any study -related serious adverse event will be reported to 
the NIH funding institute within 2 weeks; all others will be included in the annual report  to 
NIH funding institute.   The frequency of data review for this study differs according to the 
type of data and can be summarized in the following table:  
Data type  Frequency of review  
• Subject accrual rate (adherence 
to protocol regarding 
demographics, inclusion/exclusion) 
and retention rate  •  Bi-monthly during the trial recruitment period  for 
cohorts 1 and 2  
•  At the completion of each of the three measurement 
periods  for cohorts 1 and 2  
• Adverse event rates (injuries)  • 24-72 hours  
• Compliance with intervention 
program  • At completion of  sessions 3, 6, and 10 of the  
intervention program  
• Safety report  • Every [ADDRESS_671178]. Linde (Co- I), Intervention 
Director or other data collection staff lead with IRB approval to do so . In all cases, the 
privacy of measurements for each child and parent will be maintained, and all 
measurements will be carried out in a sensitive, nonjudgmental and positive atmosphere. 
Children and parents will be told that they can stop the activity at any time or not answer 
specific questions. They will also be assured of the confidentiality of their responses and 
that their names will not be kept with any data they provide. All parent/guardian and child 
participants will be informed they are free to withdraw from the study at any time without 
penalty. While several families may be at one location at the same time for measurements, 
the room will be arranged so each family has their own area with as much privacy as 
possible. All height and weight measurements will be taken behind a privacy screen and 
staff member s will not verbally announce the values.

advance and formulate questions. Drs. Fulkerson and Linde, [CONTACT_517586] and [CONTACT_517589]  
will answer all questions that potential participants have regarding the study and will inquire 
whether the potential participant would like to participate in the study. If the potential 
participant would like more time to think about it or is uninterested in participating, s/he will 
be allowed to keep the materials describing the study in case s/he changes his/her mind.

23.2 Community Based Participatory Research 
Allina Health and the Minneapolis Heart Foundation currently partner to gether to  deliver a 
program for New Ulm adults to reduce myocardial infarctions; Hearts Beat Back The Heart 
of New Ulm Project (HONU). The current NU- HOME project retains that partnership but 
extends it to include the University of Minnesota with an additional focus on child and family 
health in the New Ulm community. HONU has an existing Executive Committee whose 
members will be invited to join the NU -HOME Steering Committee  and Action Team . 
Additionally, other community partners will be invited to joing the NU -HOM E Steering 
Committee including New Ulm Medical Center physicians, UMN Extension Service, Brown 
County Public Health and other community organizations.   
 
The PI, research team and community partners will meet regularly through the Steering Committee  and Action Team  to reduce potential risks and maximize benefits for research 
participants and the community. The NU -HOME study will use CBPR strategies with the 
Action Team  as we  adapt the materials during year [ADDRESS_671183]  recruitment during years 
2 and 3. We will use CBPR methodology to engage stakeholders in each phase of the 
research, listen to concerns and develop protocols to reduce risk. We will only use methods deemed acceptable by [CONTACT_104977]. In regards to sharing results, our research plan for  
study dissemination of findings includes providing information to all participants and the 
community in addition to scientific audiences. We will consult with the Steering Committee 
and Action Team on appropriate outlets for lay audiences.  
 
Community members participating in the Action Team  will sign consent forms to complete 
CBPR surveys and be allowed to withdraw their participation at any time.   (Change in

Education data of the New U lm [ZIP_CODE] zip code indicates there are approximately 725 7 -10 
year old children. Thus, we would need to recruit about 16% of children in New Ulm to meet 
our goal of 120. Although we do not anticipate difficulty with recruitment given the high 
participation rate of adults in HONU programs (70% of targeted adults), if it appears that 
recruitment will be difficult, we will also recruit from the neighboring community of 
Springfield with whom our community partners have an established relationship. Extending 
our reach beyond New Ulm to include Springfield will increase our pool of eligible children.  
 
As outlined below, the study is funded for 5 years with time allocated to adapting the 
program (year 1), recruiting participants (year 2 for cohort 1 and 3 for cohort  2), competing 
baseline, post intervention (8 -10 months after randomization) and follow -up (14 -16 months 
after randomization) data collection (years 2- 4), delivering the seven month intervention 
program (year 2 for cohort 1 and year 3 for cohort 4), delivering the delayed intervention,

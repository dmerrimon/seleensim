SPECIFIC AIMS  
 
Vestibular migraine (VM), also known as migrainous vertigo or migraine- associated vertigo, is characterized by 
[CONTACT_432309] .  It is a prevalent presenting complaint 
to physicians in primary care, otolaryngology, and neurology.  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_432277] 
1% of the general population and 10% of patients seeking treatment for recurrent attacks of vertigo. Yet, the 
clinical spectrum of VM and its underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain unclear, with much debate 
about  the causal relationship of vestibular symptoms and headache , no evidence- based guidelines for clinical 
management, limited characterization of its disease burden, and no information about its negative impact on 
health- related quality of life.  Currently there is no proven therapy for VM.  Vestibular suppressants such as 
meclizine and dimenhydrinate are often used for symptomatic relief, but they do not prevent attacks and may 
have sedating side effects. Uncontrolled case reports suggest that mi graine abortive and prophylactic 
medications are effective for treating VM. Triptans, in particular, hold promise for aborting vestibular attacks in 
patients with VM based on the results of several uncontrolled studies and one underpowered controlled trial .  
However, substantial placebo response rates are well documented in controlled treatment trials for migraine, 
making it impossible to know if patients in these studies of VM responded to specific pharmacologic effects of 
study medications or non -specific  elements of treatment.  
 
The primary Specific Aim of this study is to conduct the first successful Phase II clinical trial of any medication for aborting vestibular attacks in subjects with VM, specifically to carry out a two- site, double blind,  parallel 
arms, placebo controlled trial of rizatriptan.  We hypothesize that rizatriptan will be superior to placebo in:   
1a. Reducing the severity and duration of vestibular attacks in patients with VM,  
1b. Reducing the severity of symptoms commonly associated with vestibular attacks in patients with VM 
(e.g., nausea, vomiting, motion sensitivity, gait disturbance, headache, photophobia, and phonophobia), 
and 
1c. Improving treatment satisfaction and health -related quality of life in patients with VM, and that  
1d. Rizatriptan will be well tolerated by [CONTACT_432310].  
 
These efficacy and safety data will inform decisions about the feasibility of a Phase III clinical trial of rizatriptan 
for VM, but additional  information will be needed to fully design such a trial. The  sample siz e and duration of a 
Phase III  trial will depend on the natural history of vestibular attacks in patients with VM . Subject selection 
criteria will depend on prevalence and confounding effects  of comorbid conditions and use of co -existing 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] .  Therefore, the secondary Specific Aim of this study is to collect  data that will be crucial for preparing 
detailed Manuals of Operating Procedures for future Phase III trials.  We hypothesize that needed  data will 
include:  
2a. The natural range of frequency and severity of vestibular attacks in treatment -seeking patients with VM , 
2b. The type and severity of medical and psychiatric conditions that commonly coexist with VM , and  
2c. The types, doses, and frequency of use of prescription and non- prescription medications for VM,  
including data on the effects of these variables on the efficacy of rizatriptan for treating vertigo attacks  in VM . 
 
To accomplish these Specific Aims, we propose to enroll [ADDRESS_547465] .  During the Observation P eriod we will prospectively characterize the frequency 
and severity of vestibular attacks and associated symptoms  in VM , the prevalence and severity of comorbid 
conditions, and the use of abortive and prophylactic medications and non -prescription treatments in patients 
receiving usual clinical care. We will train patients to recognize vestibular spells appropriate for study treatment  
and stabilize potentially confounding comorbid conditions . We will measure subjects’ satisfaction with usual 
care and their health -related quality of life.  Approximately 120 persistently symptomatic subjects will be 
randomly assigned to treatment with either rizatri ptan or placebo in a ratio of 2: 1. We will measure the effects  
of study treatment on reducing or resolving vestibular and associated symptoms, reducing the need for 
additional symptomatic treatments, and improving treatment satisfaction and health related quality of life over the [ADDRESS_547466] directions for future mechanistic investigations.  
 
RESEARCH STRATEGY 
 
I. SIGNIFICANCE  
 A. What is ves tibular migraine (VM)?  
The observation that migraine and dizziness often occur together dates back to the nineteenth century when 
Livening noted their connection in his classic book On Megrim: Sick Headaches and Som e Allied Health 
Disorders .
[ADDRESS_547467] vestibular symptoms been recognized as part of the migraine 
syndrome . Vestibular migraine (VM), also known as migrainous vertigo and migraine- associated vertigo, 
affects about 1% of the general population and 10% of patients seen in dizziness and headache clinics.17  
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_432278] 25% of unselected migraine patients.[ADDRESS_547468] a marked 
female preponderance (2- 3:1).
[ADDRESS_547469] 
that migraine abortive and prophylactic agents, including triptans, may be effective for treating VM .1-4 
 
Neurotologic conditions such as Meniere’s disease and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) share 
some symptoms with VM.6,31,32 Meniere’s disease may start with r ecurrent vertigo without  ear symptoms; 
however, with Meniere’s disease, tinnitus and hearing loss invariably occur withi n a year of onset.32,[ADDRESS_547470] with Meniere’s disease,21 BPPV, chronic subjective dizziness  (CSD) ,34 anxiety, depression,5 and other 
conditions that may alter its clinical presentation and morbidity. Recent advances in our understanding of the 
pathophysiologic mechanisms of migraine provide new hope for elucidating the link between periodic 
headaches and vestibular symptoms .35 The proposed study may increase  our knowledge of these factors , too. 
 
The current (2nd) edition of International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD -II)[ADDRESS_547471] edition does.14 VM is defined the appendix of ICHD- 3 (Table 
1), which is the first step toward full recognition in the official nomenclaure.14 These criteria define the types  of 
vestibular symptoms; minimum number, severity, and duration of vestibular attacks; association of vestibular 
and migrainous symptoms; requirement for a migraine diagnosis; and absence of other causes of symptoms.  
 
Table 1.  Diagnostic c riteria for vestibular migraine ( as included in the appendix of ICHD- 3, beta version)[ADDRESS_547472] 50% of epi[INVESTIGATOR_432279]:  
1. Headache with at least two of: a) unilateral location, b) pulsating quality, c) moderate or severe 
intensity , d) aggravation by [CONTACT_238960]  
2. Photophobia and phonophobia 
3. Visual aura  
a. Vestibular symptoms qualifying for a diagnosis of vestibular migraine include: 1) spontaneous vertigo –  false 
sensation of self motion or that the visual surround is spi[INVESTIGATOR_432280]; 2) positional vertigo –  vertigo occurring after 
a change in head position; 3) visually -induced vertigo – vertigo triggered by a complex or  large moving visual 
stimulus; 4 ) head- motion induced vertigo –  vertigo occurring during head motion; 5) head motion- induced non-
vertiginous dizziness with nausea, characterized by a sensation of disturbed spatial orientation.  
b. Moderate, interferes with but does not prohibit daily activities; severe, prevents daily activities.  
B. What is the public health burden of VM?  
Neuhauser et  al.20 found a 1% prevalence of VM in the general population of [LOCATION_013] and concluded that VM 
is underdiagnosed, causing considerable personal and health- care burden. At a rate of 10%, VM is the third 
most common diagnosis in specialty neurotology centers.[ADDRESS_547473] missed significant work, school, or home obligations.  
 
C. How is VM treated?   Why investigate an abortive versus a prophylactic therapy?  
Currently there is no proven therapy for VM . Vestibular suppressants such as meclizine and dimenhydrinate 
are frequently used for symptomatic relief of vestibular symptoms, but these medications do not prevent 
vestibular attacks and often have sedating side effects.[ADDRESS_547474] 
that commonly used migraine abortive and prophylactic drugs may be effective for treating vestibular attacks in 
patients with V M, but high placebo effects are well documented in controlled treatment trials for migraine 
headaches. A single placebo- controlled study suggested benefit for a triptan in VM, but the study failed to 
reach statistical significance for several important reasons (see “Prior Controlled Study” below).[ADDRESS_547475] -ever phase II treatment trial of VM include: 1) 
adequate phase I data exist to design a  triptan  trial for VM, 2 ) the target symptoms (discrete attacks) and 
primary outcome measure (response vs. no response) are straightforward,  3) patients prefer taking medication 
just at the time that symptoms occur , rather than daily medication, 4) potential confounds can be  managed 
more easily  in an abortive study than in a prophylactic trail,  and 5) we will learn more about the clinical c ourse 
and pathophysiology of VM (secondary Specific Aim), whether or not the abortive agent  is effective.  
 
D. What is the scientific basis for treating VM with triptans?  
The serotonin system has long been implicated in the pathogenesis of migraine.[ADDRESS_547476] pain- producing intracranial extracerebral blood vessels, reduce trigeminal 
sensory nerve activity, and inhibit vasoactive neuropeptide release,
39 possibly via their strong affinity for 5HT 1B 
and 5HT 1D receptors,39,40 which are heavily expressed in the peripheral trigeminal system. These  receptors are 
also present in vestibular ganglion cells and inner ear cells in rats and monkeys.41 Parallel expression of 5HT 1B 
and 5HT 1D receptors in the peripheral vestibular and trigeminal systems suggests that similar mechanism s may 
be at work to produce vertigo and headaches. Triptans could, therefore, be effective for treating both vertigo 
and headaches.41 Serotonin agonists decrease emesis in animal models of motion sickness.42-44 In three small 
placebo controlled studies, ri zatriptan protected patients with migraine/VM  from developi[INVESTIGATOR_432281] (N=10, N= 25),9,11 but not visual motion stimulation (N=10) .10 In controlled 
studies for non-vestibular migraine headaches, rizatriptan significantly decreased the severity of nausea.45  
 E. What are the risks of taking triptans?  
Triptans are well tolerated with minimal side effects, the most common being somnolence.
[ADDRESS_547477] 
minimal vasoconstrictor effects on coronary or peripheral arteries in normal human subjects.47-49 In an 
uncontrolled case series of three women with VM, triptan treatment resolved vertigo attacks but induced or 
aggravated headaches.2 This has not been reported in any other cases of VM patients treated with triptans, but 
it illustrates the importance of conducting a well controlled treatment trial measuring all VM symptoms.  
 
F. What are the pharmacokinetics and costs of rizatriptan ver sus other triptans?  
Rizatriptan is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_432282] (~90%) from the gastrointestinal tract following 
administration of the oral tablet. Absolute bioavailability is 47% owing to moderate first -pass metabolism.50 The 
mean time to maximum plasma concentration (t max) following a single rizatriptan 10 -mg tablet in healthy 
volunteers is about 1 hour,50,51 which is shorter than that of other triptans.46 Rizatriptan has a relatively short 
plasm a half -life of approximately 2– 2.5 hours.50,51 Healthy males showed no unexpected accumulation of 
rizatriptan following administration of multiple 10 mg doses.52 Rizatriptan is also available in a wafer form that 
dissolves in the mouth but it is absorbed a t a slower rate than the oral tablets (mean t max 1.6–2.5 hours).   
 
Rizatriptan is eliminated primarily via oxidative deamination catalyzed by [CONTACT_40021] A and renal 
elimination which together account for 76% of total plasma clearance.[ADDRESS_547478] -effective option for future clinical care. If oral rizatriptan is effective for treating vertigo attacks  
in VM , then other routes of administration can be assessed in later studies.  
 
G. Summary of Significance 
One percent of the general population and up to 10%  of treatment -seeking patients with recurrent vestibular 
attacks suffer s from VM.  Little is known about its clinical course or the prevalence and severity of comorbid 
conditions, leading to diagnostic confusion and inadvertently misguided therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  In the absence of proven treatments , current clinical practice relies  on anecdote and uncontrolled studies , several of which suggest good 
response to triptans.
1-[ADDRESS_547479] evidence base for any abortive or 
prophylactic therapy for VM  (Specific Aim #1) .  It also will lay the foundation for a definitive Phase III t rial of 
rizatriptan for treating vestibular attacks and associated symptoms in patients with VM . Data on the key clinical 
features of VM and its comorbid conditions  will provide the detailed information needed to write Manuals of 
Operating Procedures for f uture trials including guidance on subject selection and methods of handling 
potential confounds  (Specific Aim #2).   More immediately, it will provide clinically useful information to improve 
diagnostic clarity of VM.  It also may provide insights into the pathophysiology of the condition.  
 
II. INNOVATION  
A. Prior Controlled Study of Triptans for Vestibular Migraine  
Neuhauser et al.8 conducted a placebo- controlled trial of oral zolmitriptan for aborting VM attacks, but the study 
did not reach statistical significance due to inadequate power.  Criteria for entry into that study included age 
between 18 and 65 years and a diagnosis of VM  according to the investigators’  original 2001 definition.20 That 
definition differed from the recently published ICHD -3 diagnos is (Table 1)[ADDRESS_547480] two, not five, attacks of vestibular symptoms.  Randomization to  treatment required demonstration of 
active illness as defined by [CONTACT_432311] 12 months preceding 
study entry.  Of 73 subjects initially enrolled,  only 19 (26%) were randomized to crossover treatment. Most 
subjects (N=32 or 44% of initial sample) who were not randomized failed to meet requirements for frequency 
and severity of acute attacks.  Another 14 subjects (19%) could not be randomized because they lived too far 
from the study location. Among those who were randomized, 10/19 (53%) subjects treated a total of 17 attacks 
(8 with zolmitriptan, 9 with placebo). The others had no attacks after randomization or dropped out  of the study . 
Response rates were 3/8 (38%) for zolmitriptan and 2/9 (22%) for placebo, numbers too small to make any 
conclusions with regard to treatment response. Five lessons can be learned from this failed trial . First, 
investigator s must enroll patients who have more frequent and severe attacks. The natural waxing and waning 
course of illness prevented nearly half of subjects in the zolmitriptan trial from being randomized. This problem 
is related to one of the fundamental questions  about VM. How many attacks are needed to diagnose the 
condition with reasonable sensitivity and specificity? The new diagnostic criteria for VM , included in the  
appendix of ICHD -3, require five, rather than two, lifetime vestibular attacks in patients who meet other criteria 
for migraine headache.[ADDRESS_547481] a  few subjects because 
generalizabi lity could suffer; however, it is reasonable to gather more data from each carefully enrolled subject 
than Neuhauser and coll eagues did in their failed trial.[ADDRESS_547482] been incorporated into the present proposal.  
 
B. Preliminary Studies: Clinical and Research Experience with VM at UCLA and Mayo Clinic  
Investigators at UCLA and Mayo Clinic have had extensive experience in research and clinical management of 
patients with VM.5,6,19,21,22,24,27,28,31,34,[ADDRESS_547483] cross -sectional diagnostic studies 
of migraine and vestibular symptoms reported to date.5,19 The group at UCLA recently reviewed the clinical 
features of 208 patients who presented to the neurotology clinic over a two- year period with idiopathic 
recurrent spontaneous attacks of vestibular symptoms without associated auditory symptoms.19 Of these 208 
patients, 180 (87%) met ICHD -II criteria for migraine (112 with aura and 68 without aura). A mong the patients 
with recurrent vertigo and ICHD -II migraine, 70% experienced headache, aura, photophobia, or phonophobia 
with some or all of their vestibular attacks, meeting the ICHD- [ADDRESS_547484] one comorbid condition such as Meniere’s disease, BPPV, CSD, 
anxiety, or depression .5,6 Comorbidity affected subjects’ clinical presentations, but the characteristic features of 
VM could still be identified by [CONTACT_432312].[ADDRESS_547485] through a 
double- blind, parallel group comparison trial of verapamil vs.  sertraline for patients with co -existing VM/CSD. 
This pharmacologic dissection (not efficacy, hence no placebo) study was designed to identify which epi[INVESTIGATOR_432283] a medication effective for migraine (verapamil) 
versus one useful for C SD (sertraline). The interim analysis identified several factors that strongly reinforced 
our decision to proceed with an abortive, not prophylactic, trial in this Phase II proposal. Fully two -thirds of 
potentially eligible subjects were excluded from the VM/CSD study  because they had active medical conditions 
or were taking medications that would confound migraine prophylaxis. That problem would apply to any other 
prophylactic medication trial for VM. Until more data on the nature and prevalence of these c onfounds emerge 
from the VM/CSD trial and other studies, a Phase II trial of a ny prophylactic medication for VM will be 
impossible to design properly and doomed to failure if attempted.  These confounds are much  less likely to 
affect an abortive trial as they  would  cause  far fewer problems with comorbidity and drug -drug interactions. 
The VM/CSD interim analysis also demonstrated that we have sufficient  patient volumes to support the present  
proposal (>100 patient s with VM annually) and great success  enroll ing subjects ( 75% of eligible individuals ).   
 C. Considerations for Improved Subject Selection for the Current Proposal  
In our clinical and research experience vestibular  attacks  can be reliably identified and should be the easiest of 
all VM symptoms to target for  treatment.  The most frequent duration of vestibular attacks with VM  is hours  to a 
few days . Focusing on patients with this duration of attacks is logical to maximize recruitment and ensure that 
enrolled subjects have attacks of sufficient duration to assess response to treatment. Therefore, our cohort of interest will be patients with a lifetime histories  of five or more vestibular attacks lasting [ADDRESS_547486] five 
spontaneous epi[INVESTIGATOR_432284] a year will effectively exclude early cases of 
Meniere’s syndrome. Patients with previousl y established Meniere’s disease will be excluded from this study 
because their acute vertiginous symptoms overlap considerably with those of VM. Vertigo attacks caused by [CONTACT_432313] (<2 minutes), making them easy to distinguish from the hou rs-long attacks of VM in 
our cohort of interest. CSD  causes chronic non -vertiginous symptoms, not epi[INVESTIGATOR_318172]. Therefore, 
patients with coexisting BPPV or CSD will not be excluded if they have vestibular attacks  and meet all other 
inclusion and exclusion criteria. Coexisting anxiety or depressive disorders will be managed during the 
observation period and will not be exclusionary, if they can be stabilized within three months.  These 
considerations balance the needs for successful subject recruitment,  subject safety, and focus on the target 
symptoms of interest ( i.e., recurrent, spontaneous vestibular attacks  in patients with VM ), while retaining 
generalizability to real world clinical settings  and gathering critical information about potentially confounding 
variables for future Phase III trials , all informed by [CONTACT_432314].  
 
D. Summary of Innovation  
Two important improvements over previous work have been incorporated into this proposal.  The first innovation is a practical one in terms of study design. We carefully considered shortcomings in the previously 
published zolmitriptan trial
[ADDRESS_547487] selection criteria, a prospective observation period, and specific strategies for addressing the 
common problem of comorbidity in VM (essentially ignored in previous studies). If we are successful, then 
these elements will in form the design of future therapeutic investigations for patients with VM, including not 
only Phase III studies of rizatriptan, but also clinical trials of other abortive and prophylactic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
The second innovation concerns the fundamental definition of VM.  We will use the recently published ICHD -[ADDRESS_547488] hypotheses 1a -1d that rizatriptan will be:  
1a. Superior to placebo in reducing the severity and duration of vestibular attacks as measured by:  
(1) Proportion of treated attacks in which subjects experience a reduction in severity rating from Grade 3/2 
to Grade 1/0 at one hour after taking study medication (see below for rating description). This is the 
main outcome measure; 1a(2) -1d(2) are secondary outcome measures.  
(2) Proportion of treated attacks in which subjects achieve sustained reli ef (i.e., vestibular symptom 
severity rating of Grade 1/0) for 24 hours after taking study medication, without use of non -study 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
(3) Proportion of treated attacks in which subjects experience freedom from vestibular symptoms (i.e., severity rating of  Grade 0) at one hour after taking study medication.  
(4) Use of fewer non- study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_432285].  
 
1b. Superior to placebo in reducing severity of symptoms associated with vestibular attacks as measured by:  
(1) Proportion of treated attacks in which subjects experience relief (reduction to Grade 1/0) from 
VM-associated symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, motion sensitivity, gait disturbance, headache, 
photophobia, and phonophobia) at one hour after taking study medication.  
(2) Proportion of treated attacks in which subjects achieve sustained relief from VM -associated 
symptoms for 24 hours after taking study medication without use of non -study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
1c. Superior to placebo on treatment satisfaction and health- related quality o f life as measured by:  
(1) Scores on the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM)
57 at 48 hours after each 
attack treated with study medication  
(2) Scores on the Short Form 12  (SF-12)58 at 48 hours after each attack treated with study medication  
 1d. Tolerated as well as placebo by [CONTACT_432315]:  
(1) No greater rate of treatment -emergent serious adverse events reported on the NCI Common Toxicity 
Criteria Scale 4.0
59 obtained 48 hours after each attack treated with study medication.  
(2) No greater rate of treatment discontinuation for adverse events of any type or severity.  
 Our secondary  Specific Aim is to gather data that will be needed to establish rigorous inclusion and excl usion 
criteria, determine sample sizes, and prepare Manuals of Operating Procedures for future Phase III treatment trials of rizatriptan and other abortive and prophylactic medications for VM.  We intend to gather the following 
specific information during the Observation Phase of this study , which will last up to 12 months : 
 2a. The natural range of frequency and severity of vestibular attacks in treatment -seeking patients with VM . 
Our goal is to identify the mean, median, and range of naturally occurring vestibular attacks in patients with 
VM, allowing future investigators to accurately estimate the sample sizes and study durations needed for 
abortive and prophylactic medication trials.  
 
2b. The type and severity of medical and psychiatric conditions that commonly coexist with VM . 
Our goal is to identify the prevalence and severity of common comorbidities of VM, allowing fu ture investigators 
to make informed decisions about the inherent compromise between exc luding subjects with potential 
confounds versus including subjects with manageable comorbidities to maintain real world generalizability.  
 2c. The types, doses, and frequency of use of prescription and non- prescripti on medications for VM .  
Our goal is to create a compendium of usual clinical care and self -treatment of VM, giving fu ture investigators 
naturalistic data to (1) guide selection of allowable co- treatments in future studies of prophylactic and abortive 
medic ations for VM and (2) determine which usual care treatments may be worthy of future controlled trials . 
 We also intend to collect the data described in 2a -c through the treatment phase of the study.  Our goal is to 
conduct  exploratory analyses of the influence of these variables on the efficacy  of rizatriptan for VM , further 
enhancing the design of future Phase III trials and providing possible insight s into the pathophysiology of VM  
 
A. Resources and Research Facilities  
UCLA and Mayo Clinic are well -established tertiary neurotology centers with strong referral bases regionally 
and nationally. Both centers see large volumes of patients with VM annually and maintain large databases of 
patients previously diagnosed with VM. Me mbers of the study teams at both sites have been involved in 
neurotology research and clinical practice for many years and have recently published investigations of VM as 
detailed in Preliminary Results. Facilities needed to carry out study procedures already exist at both sites. The 
Research Pharmacy at Mayo Clinic will support both sites.  
 B. Subject Selection and Recruitment  
New patients referred to UCLA or Mayo Clinic for recurrent vestibular symptoms during the time of the study 
will undergo diagnostic evaluations per usual clinical practice at each site.  Patients who meet the selection 
criteria below will be invited to participate in the study. Existing databases will be screened for potentially 
eligible subjects. Individuals who appear to m eet selection criteria will be sent a postal invitation to contact [CONTACT_432316]. Those who are interested will be scheduled for clinical re- evaluation and to review the study 
procedures and verify eligibility. New patients and individuals identified t hrough existing databases who agree 
to participate will be enrolled after giving written informed consent. Others will be offered usual clinical care.  
 
C. Study Plan  
The study will be conducted in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice and will be approved by [CONTACT_432317]. All subjects will give written informed consent 
before undergoing any study procedures.  We have received a letter from the FDA indicating that our proposal 
meets the requi rements for exemption from IND registration (appendix).  
 
1. Inclusion Criteria  
a) Age ≥18 years and ≤ 65 years  (the FDA -approved age range for rizatriptan therapy  in adults ). 
b) History that fulfills all criteria for VM as defined in Table 1, except that attacks must last at least 2 hours. 
(Shorter attacks will not last long enough to judge treatment response.)  
c) Epi[INVESTIGATOR_432286] a spontaneous onset and resolution without associated hearing loss or interictal 
neurotologic deficits. (Patients with uncomplic ated presby[CONTACT_432318].)  
d) Other causes of vestibular symptoms ruled out by [CONTACT_432319].  
e) Current medication list compatible with Concomitant Medications below.  
f) Able to maintain a Vestibular Symptom Diary and complete all other study procedures.  
 
2. Exclusion Criteria  
a) Ménière’s disease by [CONTACT_317489] -HNS criteria60  
b) Migraine with b rainstem aura (formerly basilar -type migraine) by [CONTACT_25420] -3 criteria.14  
c) Ischemic heart disease, coronary artery vasospasm, uncontrolled hypertension. (Potential subjects with 
uncomplicated mild hypertension may be enrolled if they are willing to bring their blood pressure under 
control within the first three months of study participation and maintain treatment throughout.)  
d) History of stroke or transient ischemic attack.  
e) History of using rizatriptan specifically to treat vestibular attacks.  
f) History of adverse response to triptans . 
g) Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. (Women of childbearing age must be willing to use medically 
acceptable methods of birth control throug hout the study.)  
h) Unable or unwilling to comply with study requirements for any reason.  
 
D. Study Visits and Phases 
1. Visit 1 . Prior to study entry, potential subjects will be evaluated clinically, including neurotologic history, 
examination, and laboratory testing per usual practice at each site. These steps will be part of routine clinical care, not study procedures. Study per sonnel will identify potential subjects (i.e., those diagnosed with VM) by 
[CONTACT_432320]. Interested patients will be invited to Visit [ADDRESS_547489] data about all vestibular attacks that they experience during this period in their Vestibular Symptom 
Diaries (see description below). Subjects will be permitted to treat their sy mptoms according to usual clinical 
care. They will record all interventions in their Vestibular Symptom Diaries. Study personnel will review this 
information with subjects by [CONTACT_72856] a monthly basis and will inquire about interval changes in subjects’  
health and medications. This process will build rapport with subjects, ensure that they continue to meet 
inclusion/exclusion criteria,  and identify comorbid conditions that could affect their safety or subsequent study 
treatment. Study personnel also will  use these data to train subjects to reliably recognize attacks that will be 
appropriate for treatment with study medication when they enter the T reatment Phase of the investigation.  
Treatable comorbidities (e.g., mild hypertension, anxiety disorders) will be managed in coordination with 
subjects’ primary care clinicians or relevant specialists. P atients whose comorbidities cannot be managed and 
patients who do not have two qualifying epi[INVESTIGATOR_11645] [ADDRESS_547490] to confirm they are not pregnant.  
 
4. Treatment Phase . Subjects who qualify for randomization will enter the Treatment Phase. They will be 
randomly assigned to parallel study arms in a 2:[ADDRESS_547491] with Grade 3/2 vestibular symptoms . 
Associated symptoms, including headache, need not be present and may be of lesser severity. Headaches 
without vestibular symptoms are not eligible for study treatment , but may be treated in the subjects’ usual 
manner . Subjects will be instructed to ingest  one study capsule as soon as possible after onset of Grade 3/[ADDRESS_547492] 48 hours before 
treating a subsequent vestibular attack with study medication. The relatively short plasma half -life of rizatriptan 
(2-2.5 hours) justifies the 48- hour wash out period.  Subjects  may use other medications to treat residual 
symptoms (see Concomitant Medications) but must wait at least [ADDRESS_547493] telephone assessments on a mont hly basis as they did during the Observation Phase. Extra visits to 
study clinics will be arranged as needed to re -evaluate subjects’ health and treat problematic symptoms.

12,13 
1. Vestibular Symptom Diary . During Observation and Treatment Phases of the study, subjects will track   the 
frequency of their headaches vestibular symptoms  (unsteadiness/dizziness) , and sensitivity to potential  
triggers of attacks (head/body motion, environmental stimuli, specific  positions).   
2. Common Toxicity Criteria Scale 4.0 (National Cancer Institute).59 A clinician -rated, comprehensive 
measure of toxicity from study medications in all body systems .   
3. Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication  (TSQM).57 A validated self -report measure of 
treatment satisfaction in four domains: effectiveness, side effects, convenience, and global satisfaction.  
Subjects will be asked whether they think they received rizatriptan or placebo after each dosing 
4. Short Form 12 (SF-12).58 A 12-item self-report measure of health- related quality of life in six domains.  
5. Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI).61 A 25-item self -report of vertigo, dizziness, functional impairment, 
and emotional symptoms associated with vestibular symptoms.  
6. Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD -7).62 A 7-item self -report rating scale for anxiety, a common 
comorbidity of VM . The GAD -7 has cut -offs for clinically significant levels of anxiety symptoms.  
7. Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ -9).63 A 9 item self -report rating scale for depression, another common 
comorbidity of VM. The PHQ -9 has cut -offs for clinically significant levels of depressive symptoms.  
8. NEO -PI-3 Personality Inventory  (NEO -PI-3).78 A 240- item qu estionnaire that assesses  traits of  the Five 
Factor Model of personality (neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, conscientiousness).  
 
F. Handling of Study Drug.  The Mayo Clinic Research Pharmacy will support both study sites. The research 
pharmacists will purchase rizatriptan [ADDRESS_547496] be stabilized during the Observation Phase and remain 
unchanged for the entire Treatment Phase. Those who take triptans for migraine headaches can continue to 
use them but not within 48 hours of taking study medication for vertigo attacks during the Treatment Phase. 
Subjects may use symptomatic medications for relief of vertigo attacks during the Observation Phase and for 
relief of symptoms that remain after taking study medication during the Treatment Phase (starting 1 hour after 
taking the study medication so that the primary outcome measure is not affected). Subjects must discontinue 
monoamine oxidase inhibitors at least [ADDRESS_547497] not been observed in investigations of concomitant medication use.64-67 
These antidepressants will not be excluded, but subjects will be advised of potential adverse interactions.  
 
H. Safety Procedures.  Study personnel will be available during working hours  and 24-hour emergency 
coverage will be provided at each site. Subjects who develop serious adverse events or medical conditions 
incompatible with safe use of rizatriptan will be withdrawn from the study.  See Human Subjects for additional 
details.  
 
I. Data Management . All data entry, data quality checking, data management, and statistical analyses will be 
conducted at the Data & Statistical Coordinating Center (DSCC) at UCLA under the direction of [CONTACT_432337], who has extensive experience running DSCCs for clinical trials. The PI, Co- PI, and co- investigators will 
work with [CONTACT_32830] to program questionnaires and data input forms (paper and electronic) as needed for the 
study. All members of the study staff will be trained in data collection and entry techniques prior to the start of 
the study. Strict rules and regulat ions for patient security and confidentiality will be implemented by [CONTACT_432321]. 
All data transferred from each of the sites will be carefully checked and maintained, and the DSCC will ensure 
that both sites follow the data security procedures. These procedures will be incorporated into data handling 
protocols, and auditing principles and periodically checking will be used to ensure compliance.  
 
We will use a reliable and secure system for data transfer.  All survey and abstraction data will be transferred 
from each data sources to the DSCC through secured mechanisms (e.g., secured website, FTP or password 
protected files).  All data sets will be stored in password protected folders on network server or password 
protected computers designated for use by [CONTACT_432321]. We will monitor the data through serial evaluation of the 
databases and analytic products throughout the process. Any discrepancy and/or inconsistency in the data will 
be evaluated and corrected in a timely manner.  
 
An analytical ID generated through a scramble function will be created for each individual patient to protect 
patient confidentiality. Data analyses conducted at the DSCC will use analytical files that contain only the 
encrypted analytical IDs; no other patient identifying information will be available. Standard labels and format 
libraries will be created to facilitate analysis. A codebook that contains the information about the  standard 
variable names and coding system will be created.  
 
J. Statistical Methods  
1. Power Analysis .  The primary goal of this Phase II study is to demonstrate sufficient superiority of 
rizatriptan over placebo in the main outcome measure, 1a(1), to warr ant a future Phase III trial. In the previous 
triptan study for VM8 (see Prior Controlled Study of Triptans for VM), the response rate for active drug was 3/8 
(38%) versus 2/9 (22%) for placebo. If the  small sample from that failed trial reflected a true response, then the 
odds ratio favoring the triptan for VM would be [ADDRESS_547498] rizatriptan for conventional migraine.
12,13 Those studies had response rates of 74% and 77 % for rizatriptan 
versus 28% and 37% for placebo giving odds ratios of 7.[ADDRESS_547499] -case scenario for our sample size calculation.  Focusing on the main outcome 
measure, 1a(1), in this double- blind, randomized trial, w ith PASS 68 simple randomization design69 and using a 
type I error of 0.05, type II error of 0.2 (equivalent to power of 80%), two- sided tests, then treating 120 subjects 
(with 2:1 ratio for treatment and placebo) will allow us to detect an odds ratio as s mall as 3.2. Thus, the plan to 
enroll [ADDRESS_547500] 120 for the Treatment Phase will be sufficient, even if 
the response of VM to rizatriptan proves to be only half that of conventional migraine.  Phase II trials typi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y 
gather data on secondary outcomes (e.g., 1a(2) -1d(2)) and other variables (2a -c) to inform the design of Phase 
III trials, but sample sizes need not be planned to demonstrate significant differences in these variables.  
 
2. Randomization.  A randomization scheme will be developed to assign the 120 patients expected to be 
included in the T reatment Phase  to parallel treatment arms in a 2:1 ratio of active drug:placebo.     
 
3. Statistical Analysis and Modeling.  We will use SAS and R70 statistical software, creating ad  hoc 
algorithms and macro procedures to solve analytical questions for which no marketed algorithms exist.  
1.  As a first step to understanding the nature of our data, we will conduct univariate analysis of demographics, 
primary and secondary outcome measures, illness -related variables (e.g., frequency, severity, and duration of 
vertigo attacks), associated symptoms, comorbid conditions, and self -report rating scales. The marginal 
distribution of each measure will be calculated at each time point and across time.  The time trends of outcome 
measures will be evaluated by [CONTACT_432322]. For example, parallel plots for each of the outcome 
measures will be created to examine the patterns of change over time.  
 
2.  We will t est the four hypotheses of Specific Aim #[ADDRESS_547501], 
we will analyze differences between rizatriptan and placebo on all outcome measures at each time point using chi-squares to cross -tabulate categorical vari ables, and t -tests, analyses of variance (ANOVAs), or marginal 
regressions to compare continuous variables.  
 
3.  After testing bivariate differences, we will use repeated measures mixed effects models
71,72  to compare 
outcome measures between rizatriptan and placebo over time, and examine the effects of covariates on 
treatment response.  As an example, for the special case of binary outcome vertigo severity (Grade 3/2 versus 
Grade 1/0) and the more general case of ordinal outcome vertigo severity (Grade 3, 2, 1, 0), we will use SAS 
PROC GLIMMIX73 to model the logits of cumulative probabilities including vectors for study drug, illness related 
variables, associated symptoms, rating scales, random effects, and time. The estimates on the linear scale will 
represent log cumulative odds. The cumulative logits are formed as  log {Pr(ϒi≤ j) / Pr(ϒi > j)} = Χ iα + ΖiγI + εI  for 
i=1, …, n,  where ϒi is the n i x 1 vector of the outcome measure for the ith patient, j=0,1,2,3, n i is the number of 
measurements for the  ith subject in the period, Χ i is ni x p known predictors (indicator signifying rizatriptan and 
placebo, and time variable.) The fixed effects parameter vector of  α is p x 1. Ζi is ni x k known predictors, which 
are associated with the random part of the model, including time- varying and time factors. γ I is the k x [ADDRESS_547502] parameter vector and γ I  ~ Ν(0,D),  εI is ni x 1  and εI ~ Ν(0,σ2Ι), which is independent of  γI . Let 
Σi(θ) = Ζi DΖiT + σ2Ι  with θ being the parameter of covariance vector. Integrating out γ I in the above random 
effect model, we can write ϒi ~ Ν(Χiα , Σi(θ) ).  
  
4.  We will use this [ADDRESS_547503] all outcome measures for hypotheses 1a- 1d. However, 
the principal result of the study will be determined by [CONTACT_432323], 1.a.(1), plus favorable findings on tolerability measures, 1d(1) -1d(2). 
We will inc lude all subjects who treat at least one vertigo attack with study drug (i.e., intent -to-treat analysis). A 
statistically significant result favoring rizatriptan over placebo on 1a(1) and absence of statistically significant 
differences on 1d(1) -1d(2) will support development of a Phase III clinical trial of rizatriptan for treating 
vestibular attacks  in patients with VM . The design of future trials w ill also  be informed by [CONTACT_432324] 1a(2) -1c(2).  We did not hypothesize equal  tolerability for rizatriptan and placebo,  but 
rather  an absence of significantly higher rates of serious adverse effects and drug -related treatment 
discontinuation, so our statistical analyses of measures 1d(1) -1d(2) will not include equivalence tests.  
 
5.  Analyses of Specific Aim #2 (a-c) will be descriptive and exploratory . As a Phase II trial, this proposed study 
is not power ed for a thorough examination of covariates  and confounds .  We will start by  [CONTACT_432325] O bservation Phase of the study to identify results that will be critical for 
designing  future Phase II I trials.  First , we will examine the distribution of VM attack frequency and severity (2a) 
to determine if these variables have normal,  skewed, bimodal, or other distributions.  Thi s will allow future 
investigators  to estimate recruitment patterns for  Phase III  studies.  Second,  we will establish a rank order o f 
comorbid conditions (2b) by [CONTACT_432326].  This 
will allow future Phase III investigators to understand trade- offs between strictness of subject selection criteria 
and generalizability of results . Third, we will establish a rank order of usual care and self -medication therapi[INVESTIGATOR_432287] (2c).  This will allow future investigators to establish criter ia for allowable  co-treatments in Phase III  
trials.  Finally, we will repeat the multivariate modeling of step [ADDRESS_547504] s on rizatriptan versus placebo treatment will mark  design considerations for Phase III trials and 
potentially generate hypotheses for epi[INVESTIGATOR_50123], mechanistic, or other lines of investigation of VM.  
 
6.  Missing Data: We do not antici pate a maj or problem with missing data from subjects who complete this 
study . Furthermore,  repeated measures mixed effects models allow unbalanced data (e.g., missing follow -up 
data).  Nevertheless, we will use the following approach to missing data.  We will calculate the frequency and 
pattern of missingness of each measure as missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR) 
or missing not at random (MNAR) .
74,75 Based on the nature of missingness, we will determine  which imputation 
approach would be appropriate. For complex situations, we will use EM algorithm, fully Bayesian, maximum  
likelihood procedures, and para metric multiple imputation (MI) methods, which are appropriate under general 
MAR conditions. ML and MI tend to yield similar results when implemented in comparable ways. Nonrandom 
dropout may be a problem  because subjects having the most severe attacks may object to taking placebo pi[INVESTIGATOR_432288]. Subject demographics and illness characteristics can be used  to test the MAR 
assumption. To reduce the possible impact of non- random dropout or MNAR missingness, subject 
characteristics variables will be used in the missing data model with MI/ML, which can reduce estimation bias 
due to MN AR missingness, and partially restore lost power due to missingness .76,[ADDRESS_547505] ( treated attacks in which subjects experience a reduction in severity 
rating) and the auxiliary variable, and apply joint modeling and MI methods to utilize the auxiliary information 
(e.g., subject characteristics). We will apply MNAR methods (e.g., selection models, pattern mixture models, 
and shared parameter models) to perform sensitivity analysis to evaluate model robustness .75 
 
7. Interim analysis: We will conduct an interim analysis at study midpoint without breaking the blind to assess 
(1) recruitment, (2) safety, and (3) efficacy. Plans for  shortfalls in recruitment are noted below. We will 
terminate the study for insufficient safety if there is a  statistically significant difference between arms in adverse 
events of greater than minor severity , or for lack of efficacy if response rates are <25% in both arms, i.e., no 
better than placebo rates in previous triptan trials . We will continue the study if  the primary outcome , 1(a)1, is 
>25% in at least one arm, but not statistically different between arms . If the primary outcome is statistically 
different , then we will terminate the study because the primary aim will be met.  We will break the blind and 
identify the results as positive (rizatriptan superior to placebo) or negative (rizatriptan inferior to placebo).  
 
K. Timeline  of Study  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During the first three months of the study, we expect to finalize  data entry methods and train study personnel.  
Then we will begin recruitment into the Observation Phase.  Patients will remain in the O bservational Phase 
until they have two qualifying attacks or for a maximum of 12 months . These phases will continue for a total of 
four years.  Subjects who are active in the Treatment Phase at month 57 will be scheduled for a Final Visit 
(Visit 3) regardless of how many attacks they have treated.  We will conduct reviews eve ry [ADDRESS_547506] 26% of enrolled subjects 
were randomized to treatment because they did not continue to have active verstibular attacks. We believe that 
we will substantially increase that randomization rate by [CONTACT_432327], as 
described in “Considerations for Improved Subject Selection for the Current Proposal.” The previous 
investigators excluded 12% of subjects for coexisting medical problems. We expect to stabilize coexisting 
medical problems such as uncontrolled hypertension or anxiety disorders during our 12 month Observation 
Phase, allowing us to retain a higher percentage of enrolled subjects.  Neuhauser, et al.,8 also excluded 14% 
of subjects from randomization because they lived too far from the study center. Geographic barriers are much less of a problem for medical care in [ADDRESS_547507] expanded the 
reach of patient care through electronic communications and other secure technologies, eliminating the need for a geographic exclusion. These factors and the improvements in study design based on the five -point 
examination of shortcomings in the zolmitriptan trial (see “Prior Controlled Study of Triptans for Migraine-Associated Vertigo”) should allow us to successfully randomize 50% of enrolled subjects into the Treatment 
Phase of this study. Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_432289] -case scenario ( 100 
subjects for the Treatment Phase), then we will have to recruit a maximum of [ADDRESS_547508] to examine 400 potential subjects during the 4 years of active enrollment. Study success 
would require us to recruit 50% of those patients. The Mayo Clinic team  has enrolled 79.3 % of eligible patients 
into a currently active trial of sertraline versus verapamil for patients with VM/CSD, which demonstrates our 
ability to achieve needed enrollment.  Subjects entering the current Mayo study have almost no experience 
with triptans.  Most have been prescribed vestibular suppressants (e.g., meclizine) for acute attacks, meaning 
that we will lose almost no subjects due to prior rizatriptan treatment. (N.B. – The current Mayo study will not 
compete with this proposal. Its inclusion criteria target chronic, not acute, symptoms).

M. Plans to Address Limitations  
The patient flow just reviewed suggests that we will be able to meet study recruitment and retention targets. 
However, we intend to examine rates of enrollment into the Observation Phase and randomization into the 
Treatment Phase every quarter . If we fall short of targets for enrollment or  randomization at any point, we will  
take three steps, as needed. (1)  Contact [CONTACT_432328]. 
Both centers maintain databases of patients who participated in previous diagnostic studies (N>400), many of whom expressed interest in treatment trials. (2)  The Mayo Clinic site will expand recruitment to the Mayo Clinic 
Health System of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_432290] a three- state area of the upper Midwest, and UCLA will expand 
recruitment to affiliated hospi[INVESTIGATOR_432291]. (3)  Both sites will advertise selectively 
to regional and local professional organizations, patient advocacy groups, and the general public.  
 
A negative treatment result (i.e., finding that rizatriptan is not superior to placebo) will not be a study failure. 
Rather, it will be evidence that rizatriptan lacks the efficacy needed to pursue a Phase III trial in patients with 
VM. A negative result will prompt a search for other abortive and prophylactic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] f or VM and might 
nudge researchers to re- evaluate the concept of VM as a migrainous phenomenon. Data collected for Specific 
Aim #[ADDRESS_547509] at both i nstitutions to track the compliance of investigators with these 
programs. All key personnel will maintain current training certificates throughout the duration of this study. 
Certificates of training completion will be kept on file at both sites.   
The study protocol will be submitted to the Institutional Review Boards (IRB) at each site for full review. This study is a randomized clinical trial that meets the federal definition of moderate risk. Subject enrollment will 
not begin until IRB approval is obtai ned.  Written consent will be obtained from all subjects using IRB 
approved consent forms.  All patient recruitment materials and announcements will be approved by [CONTACT_1026].   
A. Involvement of human subjects  
1. Number of subjects -  We plan to recruit 240 subjects during the 5- year grant period, equally divided 
between the two study sites.  
2. Inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
Patients who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria listed in the “Study Plan” and agree to take part in the study will be enrolled after providing written informed consent.  Adults  >[ADDRESS_547510] en <[ADDRESS_547511] be mentally and physically capable 
of participating in all aspects of the study. Based on our prior experience and the known demographics of 
vestibular migraine (VM), we expect to enroll more women than men. The majority of subjects will be non-
Hispanic white, but we will actively recruit patients from diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds.   
Determination of eligibility.   The PIs and Co- investigators will make final determinations of potential subject 
eligibility after reviewing clinical history, physical examination and test results, and final clinical diagnoses.  
Special inclusion or exclusion criteria.  None.  
3. Vulnerable subjects.  
We will exclude children (<18 years of age) from this study .  We also will exclude  older adults (>65 years of 
age) from this study (See IV.A.2) .  No members of other vulnerable groups will be targeted for recruitment.  
B. Procedures  
Study procedures are summarized Table [ADDRESS_547512] two vesti bular attacks of moderate or greater severity during the Observation Phase and 
demonstrate acceptable adherence with data gathering and reporting procedures will be randomized to treat 
three subsequent vestibular attacks with either rizatriptan or placebo (ratio 2:1) in randomized and double- blind 
fashion. Subjects will rate treatment response and adverse effects. They will contact [CONTACT_432329] [ADDRESS_547513] 3 treatable attacks before the end of the 
study. Subjects will return to the study site for an End Point Visi t (visit 3) as soon as possible after treating 
three attacks or  sooner if they will be withdrawn from the study for any reason. The End Point Visit is expected 
to last [ADDRESS_547514] who consent will be enrolled and begin study procedures.  No study 
procedures will be performed before written informed consent is obtained.  Potential subjects who decline to 
participate will be offered routine clinical care.  
D. Potential Risks  
1. Adverse Effects of Medication: The primary risk to subjects will be the potent ial for adverse effects of 
study medication. There is a wealth of data documenting the safety and efficacy of rizatriptan in treating 
patients with migraine.  In this randomized trial, we will use a dose of rizatriptan that is generally well tolerated 
by [CONTACT_432330] (10 mg). Common adverse events include: drowsiness (4- 10%), dizziness (4- 10%), 
nausea (4 -8%), fatigue (1- 7%), tingling or numb feeling (4%), dry mouth (3%), muscle pain or cramps (2%), 
and tightness in the neck or jaw (2%), tremors, c hills, and flushing (feeling of warmth). Serious adverse events 
include chest pain (3%), hypertension, coronary artery spasm, myocardial infarction, peripheral ischemia, 
ventricular arrhythmia, ischemic colitis, anaphylaxis, angioedema, analgesic overuse headache, 
cerebrovascular accident, and serotonin syndrome.   
2. Loss of Confidentiality:  There is also a risk of loss of confidentiality if identifying information and data from 
medical records or study forms are inadvertently released.  
3. Time Demands:  This study places demands on subjects’ time for completion of the Vertigo Symptom Diary 
and self -report instruments as well as monthly telephone appointments with investigators or research 
coordinators. The Vertigo Symptom Diary will have to be completed during and after each attack.  Subjects will 
track vertigo, headache, and associated symptoms in their diaries.  They will rate each symptom using a single 
number from 0- 3 at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 12, 24, and 48 hours after the onset of each vertigo attack, which is expected 
to take 10 -20 seconds at each time point or less than 3 minutes total per attack.  Over the course of the study, 
subjects also will be required to complete 20 rating scales ranging in length from 7 to 36 questions. Each of 
these will take 1 -5 minutes to complete for a total of about 80 minutes over the entire study.  Telephone 
appointments are expected to be less than 30 minutes long on a monthly basis. During study Visit 1 only, 
subjects will complete a personality questionnaire that will take 30- 40 minutes.  
 4. Special circumstances involving studies assessing depression:   This investigation is not designed 
specifically to treat depression, but depression is  more common in patients with vestibular disorders  than in the 
general population.  For that reason, all patients at Mayo Clinic in [COMPANY_002]ster are screened for depression as 
part of clinical testing in the Vestibular Laboratory.  Those who screen positive are examined by a Mayo Clinic 
psychiatrist or psychologist familiar with mood symptoms in patients wi th vestibular disorders. This has been  
part of routine clinical practice for 6 years .  The presence of depression, per se, will not disqualify potential 
participants from study entry.  Only those whose depression is judged unlik ely to be brought under control 
within 3 months of study entry (e.g., treatment resistant depression, depression with suicidality or psychosis) 
will be ineligible to enroll.  For others, treatment  of depression will be part of the overall plan to manage 
common VM comorbidities during the Observation Phase, as described above (Section III.D.2) .   
 Depression may affect the clinical course and treatment of VM.  Therefore, depressive symptoms will be 
measured in all subjects at Visits 1, 2, and [ADDRESS_547515] clinically significant depression (PHQ -9 >9) or suicidal thoughts (PHQ -9 
ques tion 9 >0) will be examined by a study physician at the time of the visit to ensure that treatment for 
depression is initiated or updated and that the level of depressive symptoms is compatible with continued study participation.  Patients judged ineligible will be disenrolled and provided or referred for appropriate treatment.  
 
E. Risk M inimization  
1. Adverse Effects of Medication: Subjects with ischemic heart disease, uncontrolled hypertension, or 
coronary artery vasospasm will be excluded from the study because of the known cardiac complications of 
triptans. Those who are allergic or unable to tolerate triptans in the past will also be excluded from the study. 
(See “Exclusion Criteria”).  
Subjects will be closely monitored.  The research coordinator will inquire about adverse events and changes in health status during monthly telephone interviews.  Subjects will be instructed to contact a member of the 
research staff regarding adverse events at any time during the study.  They will be instructed to report cardiac 
symptoms or allergic reactions immediately.  Subjects who develop treatment -related serious adverse events 
or new onset exclusionary medical conditions will be withdrawn immediately from the study.  
2. Loss of Confidentiality:  Confidentiality will maintained to the extent legally permissible by [CONTACT_432331]. Data obtained from source documents, interviews and 
questionnaires will be captured on research forms, entered online, and stored at DSCC. The information will 
be kept confidential in a secure electronic database with restricted and monitored access. A unique subject 
ID number will be used for each subject’s research case report forms and all communications, in accordance 
with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. No identifying information will be entered into the 
database.  
3. Time Demands:  The Clinical Trials Subcommittee of the International Headache Society published 
guidelines for data collection during clinical trials of migraine treatments.
15  The data col lection instruments 
selected for this proposed study – a symptom diary and validated measures of functional impairment and 
quality of life –  follow those recommendations.  The specific diary method for rating symptoms during and 
after attacks was adopted f rom two major registration trials for rizatriptan,12,[ADDRESS_547516] been used 
by [CONTACT_432332].  Specific scales 
were chosen to achieve the goals of the study, while keepi[INVESTIGATOR_432292]’ time to a minimum.  
F. Risk/Benefit Analysis: A potential benefit to subjects who participate in this study will be the possibility of a 
reduction in vestibular attack duration and/or severity and interference with daily activities as well as possibly 
improved quality of life. It is also possible that  there would be no benefit to the study participants. A benefit to 
society may be greater understanding of treatment options for vestibular attacks in patients with VM.  
 
G. Gender/minority recruitment: Men and women of all racial and ethnic backgrounds wi ll have an 
opportunity to participate in this study.  White women have been heavily over -represented in large pre-
registration and post -marketing trials of rizatriptan, with most studies including about 90% white patients and 
90% women.  Our published research in VM included a 2:1 female:male ratio, in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_432293].  We anticipate a similar sex ratio for subjects in this study.  We project that 20% of our 
sample will be from minority groups.   
 
V. STUDY OVERSIGHT  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_7706]-PI [INVESTIGATOR_432294]. A Data Safety Monitoring 
Board (DSMB) with oversight responsibility will be appointed by [CONTACT_381721]. The DSMB will review subject accrual, frequencies and patterns of all adverse ev ents, and protocol compliance on a quarterly basis and will make 
recommendations to the NIH regarding the continuation status of the protocol.  Co -Investigator [CONTACT_32830] will 
compi[INVESTIGATOR_432295].    
The Principal Inv estigator, Co- PI [INVESTIGATOR_432296] (co -investigators, research nurses, research 
coordinators, and others) will be responsible for identifying adverse events. Aggregate reports detailed by 
[CONTACT_926], attribution (expected or unexpected), and relations hip to the study drug/study procedures will be 
made available by [CONTACT_432333]. A separate report detailing protocol compliance will also be available from the DSCC for site review monthly.  The research team will review these reports monthly and 
determine whether the protocol or informed consent document requires revision based on the reports.  
A. Definitions/Standards  
An adverse event  is defined as an unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom or disease associated with a 
participant’s participation in the current study.  
Serious adverse events  include those events that result in death, are life -threatening, require inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], create persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or cause a congenital anomaly or birth defects.    
An unexpected adverse event  is defined as any adverse experience, the specificity or severity of which is not 
consistent with the risks or information described in the protocol. Expected adverse events  are those that are 
identified in the research protocol as having been previously associated with or having the potential to arise 
as a consequence of par ticipation in the study.  
All reported adverse events will be classified using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE), version 4, developed and maintained by [CONTACT_5042].  
B. Study Intervention and Procedures: Defi nition of Expected Adverse Events  
Treatment Study Drug –  Rizatriptan (10mg within a 48- hour period).  Common adverse events include 
drowsiness (410%), dizziness (4 -10%), nausea (4 -8%), fatigue (1 -7%), tingling or numb feeling (4%), dry 
mouth (3%), muscle pain or cramps (2%), tightness in the neck or jaw (2%), tremors, chills, and flushing 
(feeling of warmth).  Allergic reactions include rash or redness, swelling, or itching of the eyelids, face, or lips.  
Serious adverse events include chest pain (3%), hy pertension, coronary artery spasm, myocardial infarction, 
peripheral ischemia, ventricular arrhythmia, ischemic colitis, anaphylaxis, angioedema, analgesic overuse 
headache, cerebrovascular accident, and serotonin syndrome.

Local i nstitutional reporting requirements to IRBs and DSMB remain the responsibility of the treating physician 
and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_7706]- PI.  
1. Investigators must report any Serious Adverse Event (SAE) that is considered life- threatening/disabling or 
results in death of s ubject or is unexpected or unanticipated, within [ADDRESS_547517] report all other suspected AEs within 20 working days of the notification of the event or 
of becoming aware of the event.  
4. All serious adverse events (SAEs) must be reported to the FDA.  
 
a) Fatal or life- threatening AEs, regardless of caus al relationship to study medication, must be reported to 
FDA on a MedWatch Form within 7 days of the event.   
b) Serious, but not fatal or life threatening events, which are related and unexpected, must be reported to 
FDA on a MedWatch Form within 15 days of the event.  
c) Other suspected AEs will be reported to FDA every quarter after the start of the study.  
 
D. Adverse Event Data Management System (AEDAMS)  
Upon entry of a serious or unexpected adverse event, the DSCC created Adverse Event Data 
Management Syst em (AEDAMS) will immediately notify the PI [INVESTIGATOR_7706]- PI [INVESTIGATOR_432297].   
Serious adverse events : Causality (definitely not related, probably not related, possibly related, probably 
related, definitely related) of the adverse event will be determined by a thorough review. A determination of the 
causal relationship of all AEs will be made based upon the package insert (Sections 6.1 and 6.2)22
. The 
Adverse Event Data Management System (AEDAMS) maintains audit trails and stores data (and data updated) 
and communication related to any adverse event in the study.   
Non-serious expected adverse events : Except those listed above as immediately reportable, non- serious 
expected adverse events that are reported to or observed by [CONTACT_1720] a member of his research 
team will be submitted to the DSCC in a timely fashion (within 20 working days). Loc al site investigators 
are also required to fulfill all reporting requirements of their local institutions.  
E. Study Discontinuation  
NIH and local IRBs have the authority to stop or suspend this trial at any time. This study may be suspended or 
closed if:   
• Accrual has been met  
• The study objectives have been met  
• The PI [INVESTIGATOR_12749] -PI [INVESTIGATOR_432298]  
• The DSMB recommends to the NIDCD and it suspends or closes the trial  
• The FDA suspends or closes the trial  
 
F. Subject Discontinuation  
An intent to treat approach will be used. All data acquired prior to termination for the reasons outlined below 
will be included in the primary analysis unless the subject withdraws consent. Every effort will be made to 
conduct a final study visit w ith subject upon withdrawal and subjects will be followed clinically until, if 
applicable, all adverse events resolve. The following events will result in subject discontinuation:  
• Withdrawal of consent  
• Withdrawal by [CONTACT_2299]  
• Withdrawal by [CONTACT_74169]  Intercurrent illness or event that precludes further visits to the study site or 
ability to evaluate disease  
 
G. Clinical Trials.gov  
 
[CONTACT_432338] will register the trial on ClinicalTrials.gov as soon as IRB approvals are obtained.

BACKGROUND  
Vestibular migraine (VM) was defined by [CONTACT_432334] Bárány Society as a disorder 
producing recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_432308] 50% of the time by [CONTACT_432335].  This randomized controlled trial tested the efficacy of rizatriptan 
as an abortive treatment for attacks of VM.  
METHODS  
Patients with VM (N=225) were observed prospectively to confirm the diagnosis.  Those who experienced two 
verified VM attacks within 12 months (N=114) were randomized 2:1 to treat up to three subsequent attacks with rizatriptan 10 mg or placebo orally.  The primary outcome was the proportion of attacks with vestibular symptoms (vertigo or unsteadiness/dizziness) reduced from moderat e/severe to none/mild at 1 hour after 
administration of study drug.  Secondary outcomes were: (1) proportion of attacks with symptoms resolved at 1 hour, (2) proportion of attacks with symptoms reduced from moderate/severe to none/mild at 24 hours, (3) treatment satisfaction at 48 hours, (4) quality of life at 48 hours, and (5) rates of adverse effects.  
RESULTS  
Of 308 treated attacks, 245(79.5%) with moderate/severe vestibular symptoms were used to test study outcomes.  On the primary outcome, rizatriptan did not differ from placebo in reducing vertigo [ 73/153(47.7%) 
vs. 53/92(57.6%) attacks , p<0.28] or unsteadiness/dizziness [ 29/153 (18.9%) vs. 11/92 (12%) attacks , p<0.24].  
On secondary outcomes, rizatriptan was superior to placebo in reducing unsteadiness/dizziness [ 120/149 
(80.5%) vs. 52/88 (59.1%) attacks , p<0. 008] at 24 hours and in treatment satisfaction [regression estimate 
11.92, 95% CI (2.33, 21.62) , p<0.016] and physical well -being [regression estimate  4.55, 95% CI (1.14, 7.97) , 
p<0.009] at 48 hours.  Rizatriptan caused more mild/moderate fatigue and drowsiness than placebo but otherwise did not differ in side effect burden.  
CONCLUSIONS  
Rizatriptan was tolerated well but provided limited benefits for attacks of VM. (Funded by [CONTACT_432336] I nstitute of 
Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, DC13256.)

Concept Synopsis and Study Schema  
The desired impact of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) is to reduce the burden of patient sickled red cells with the goal of reducing stroke risk and reducing the burden of frequent vaso- occlusive pain events 
that is otherwise refractory to other treatment modalities. However, controversy exists over transfusions with blood banked for short vs. long storage intervals. Pre- clinical 
animal studies and observational human models suggest that increased phosphatidylserine exposure (PS), seen often from red cells units with longer storage 
intervals, may lead to downstream immune effects that have detrimental consequences, such as increased clinical infections. No randomized prospective human study has attempted to correlate age of transfused RBCs with PS -exposure, and then evaluate 
how this exposure modulates patient immune systems and subsequent clinical outcomes.  
 Primary Hypothesis:  
There is a clinically significant difference between the effect of PS -high RBCs vs. PS -
low RBCs on patient macrophages.   Study Schema:  
 Trial design: A
 dults  and adolescents (post puberty)   with SCD who are treated with 
outpatient  red cell transfusions will be randomized in blocks of 5 (S. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_249321], 2010) to receive ≥ 30 day or ≤ 10 day old units for 3 months  (3 
consecutive transfusion events) . The study statistician  will provide the blood bank with 
the schema who will then be responsible for providing the units for these subjects . 
Participants and all other investigators will be blinded to treatment assignment.  
 T
wo baseline venous blood samples will be obtained to be used as a baseline 
measurement of the patients underlying inflammatory status. The first will be drawn about 1- week prior to the first randomized transfusion, and the second sample just prior to the 
first randomized transfusion. Subjects will be asked to hold their iron chelation [ADDRESS_303253] -transfusion ( Table 1 ). Participants will 
complete standardized diaries daily to document symptoms of infection, SCD pain, medications and emergency department ( ED) or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29399]. Diaries will be collected 
and participants will be assessed with each transfusion encounter, up to [ADDRESS_303254] Recruitment and Anticipated Numbers : W e intend to recruit and enroll 40 
subjects. Participants will be recruited from the Adult SCD Clinic at UNC and 
Emory/ Grady Health System . We expect that UNC will recruit between 5- 10 subjects over 
the next 2 years ([ADDRESS_303255] already been enrolled at Medical College of Wisconsin), and Emory will recruit between 10- [ADDRESS_303256] Inclusion/exclusion criteria:  
  
 Inclusion criteria :  
1) Ages 16 to 60 years  old 
2) Subject must have sickle cell anemia
 confirmed by [CONTACT_249362]  
3) Must be receiving red cell transfusion therapy  
4) Must be outpatient at the time of study transfusion s  
 Exclusion criteria:  1) History of severe reactions to transfusion therapy  
2) Receive red cell transfusions that are crossmatch incompatible  
3) Current participation in another therapeutic trial for sickle cell disease  
4) Current pregnancy  
5) History of HIV infection  
6) Having an uncontrolled inter -current illness, or psychiatric illness/social situations that 
would limit compliance with study requirements  as determined by [CONTACT_1961].  
 Study procedures : 
  
 Red cell unit preparation:  R
 ed cell units for transfusion will be crossmatch- compatible, 
sickle- negative, and phenotype- matched for D, C, E, and K  red cell antigens per current 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53769]. Red cell unit age will be documented by [CONTACT_249363]. Study transfusions will take place only  in the outpatient infusion clinic.  
 Pain and infection diary:  T
 he diary is adapted from a model widely used in SCD studies. 
Daily, participants will rate pain on a numeric ordinal pain rating scale (0- 10), indicate 
whether the pain was consistent with a “crisis,” indicate whether they utilized a healthcare facility, and record the amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_27251]. Infection symptoms will also be documented daily along with the type, duration, and dose of antibiotic s, if applicable .  
 Physical exam:  A
  basic, focused, physical exam will be performed on each subject by 
[CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_249322]. The physical exam will assess a general review of systems, a review of the pre-transfusion vital signs, and a basic evaluation of patient general status, heart, lung, 
5 
 and neurological organ systems. We will also document if the patient has an indwelling 
catheter.  
 Blood measurements:  
  
Unit samples: Red cell characteristics:  2 ml blood from each red cell unit will be obtained 
from 6 sterile unit links pre- transfusion. RBC PE and PS surface exposure, and plasma 
microparticles  will be quantified by [CONTACT_249364]2- green, and all flow 
analyses will be recorded using FACSDiVa software. The plasma fraction from each unit sample will be diverted to EPR (Bruker Elexys X- band system, Billerica, MA, [LOCATION_003]), a Bio-
Plex cytokine assay kit (Bio -Rad Laboratories), and a fluorescent immunoassay (DxFerr 
kit) to measure concentrations of free heme/hemoglobin, cytokines (IL- 1, IL-6, IL-8, MCP -
1), and NTBI, respectively.  A small sample will also be frozen for future me tabolomic 
analysis.   P
atient Samples: 10 -30 ml per lab draw of whole blood will be obtained for each blood 
draw  as defined in Table 1 , and will be stored per tube storage requirements. . Blood will 
be obtained by [CONTACT_249365]. Patient w hite cells will be isolated 
with established Ficoll separation techniques .. White cells will be tested by [CONTACT_249366] (macrophages: CD64,  CD62L,  CD80, CD86 , Tim1, 
neutrophils: The plasma fraction from each sample will be diverted to  EPR (Bruker Elexys 
X-band system, Billerica, MA, [LOCATION_003]), a Bio- Plex cytokine assay kit (Bio -Rad Laboratories), 
and a fluorescent immunoassay (DxFerr kit) to measure concentrations of free 
heme/hemoglobin, cytokines (IL- 1, IL-6, IL-8, MCP -1), and NTBI, respectively. Clinical 
measurements obtained from patients will also include: CBC (4ml EDTA) , reticulocyte 
count  (4ml EDTA) , HbS%  (3ml EDTA) , haptoglobin (1ml red top) , chemistry labs (ferritin  
(0.5ml red top) , iron saturation (1ml red top), lactate dehydrogenase (1ml red top) , high 
sensitivity CRP (HS -CRP, 1ml red top) ), urinalysis (12 ml) and blood culture (8-
10ml/bottle) . These clinical labs will be measured at intervals specifically defined in Table 
1. Individual human samples of plasma and RBC will also be frozen and sent to Angelo 
D’Alessandro at  the University of Colorado Denver to measure lipid metabolites and 
metabolomic profiles pre vs. post transfusion  as an additional exploratory goal of this trial . 
The laboratory of [CONTACT_249391][INVESTIGATOR_249323] 30- 200 
individual samples of plasma and RBCs for this purpose.  All samples will be de -identified.

 1. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
 
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an autosomal recessive disorder that affects [ADDRESS_303257] critical therapy to treat and 
prevent complications of SCD.1 
 Adults with SCD depend on red cell transfusion to prevent stroke and critical 
illness. Red cell transfusion corrects anemia, decreases sickle hemoglobin (HbS) 
percent, suppresses HbS synthesis, and reduces red cell hemolysis.
1,44,[ADDRESS_303258] syndrome and multi -organ failure.
1,44-55 
When administered on a chronic basis, typi[INVESTIGATOR_249324], transfusion decreases rate of cerebral infarcts by [CONTACT_8622] 45%
51 and vaso- occlusive events by [CONTACT_8622] 50%.53-57 Other than 
transfusion, hydroxyurea is the only medication available for SCD.1,58 Although 
hydroxyurea decreases rate of vaso- occlusion and prolongs life, the drug is not indicated 
for stroke prevention and is ineffective in 50% of patients.59-[ADDRESS_303259] units possible is critical.  
 Changes occur in the physiology of red cell units with prolonged storage 
that may trigger a cascade of deleterious events in the transfusion recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]: macrophage activation, inflammation and release of toxic iron species (Figure 1).  
Red cells preserved with Adsol solution can be stored up to 42 days,
65 a recommendation 
based on integrity, not red cell efficacy or safety. Significant oxidative and metabolic changes occur with storage: hemolysis with release of cell -free hemoglobin, heme, and 
non-transferrin  bound iron (NTBI), as well as alterations to the lipid composition of the red 
cell membrane.
6-15 Surface exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS), a phospholipid normally 
found on the inner leaflet of the red cell membrane but which becomes externally exposed with storage, may be the most important of these changes.
23-27 Macrophages recognize 
PS as an “eat me” signal via specific receptors (Tim1, Tim4, and Stabilin- 2) and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_249325].66-71 In pre- clinical studies, phagocytosis of old red cells 
results in activation and secretion of pro- inflammatory cytokines, such as IL- 1, IL-6, IL-8, 
CXCL -1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP -1).19,28 Phagocytosis of a bolus 
of old red cells also overwhelm the macrophage’s metabolic capacity, leading them to release cell -free hemoglobin, heme and NTBI with downstream effects.
21,22,29- [ADDRESS_303260],32-34,78 and heme activates endothelial cells via TLR4 receptors.35,36 Prior to 
penicillin prophylaxis, infection was the primary cause of death in patients with SCD due to splenic dysfunction.
79-81 The cumulative result of SCD’s pathology is an adult who is 
prone to infections, chronically inflamed and susceptible to the pathology of PS -high, 
older red cells, and the consequent increased levels of cell -free hemoglobin, heme and 
NTBI in circulation. In fact, on sickle erythrocytes (not transfused cells) PS exposure is well-known to cause adhesion to the endothelium and thrombin generation, both of which 
worsen the pathology of vaso-occlusion.
82,83 Since older red cell units with increased PS 
exposure can promote a similar physiology as SCD, they may exacerbate the illness of these vulnerable patients.  
 No prospective study has evaluated the effects of an older unit with high PS 
exposure in an adult with SCD.  There has only been one recently published prospective 
study in patients with SCD to examine the effects of age of blood.
84 This was a 
randomized trial, conducted in Africa, of young children with either SCD or malaria transfused with > 25 day -old units versus <  10 day -old units to treat severe anemia (mean 
Hgb 3.7g/dl) with evidence of lactic acidosis. Although the trial found no difference 
between the two arms in the primary outcome measure, blood lactate levels, the results do not address the question of the current proposal: do PS -high, older units trigger  a 
pathobiology in chronically transfused adults with SCD that leads to infection? Differences in unit physiology, patient inflammation, infection rates, and pain were not examined in the prior study, which is why the current study needs to be conducted. Other than that one prospective study, the only data about the effects  of older units in SCD comes from 
three observational cohort studies, all of which showed an adverse outcome (increased red cell alloimmunization and decreased vascular dilatation) associated with older units.
85-[ADDRESS_303261] that no evaluation was performed of the unit’s 
[ADDRESS_303262] time, a prospective, randomized study to elucidate the immunological and clinical effects of an older 
unit with high PS exposure on adults with SCD.  
 Preliminary Studies  
 In Milwaukee, 1/3 of units transfused to adults with SCD are >[ADDRESS_303263] the transfusion of older units. Four hundred adults 
receive care in the Adult Sickle Cell Clinic at UNC  in Chapel Hill, 47 of who receive chronic 
outpatient transfusions for chronic pain or stroke prophylaxis. Transfusions are administered to adults regardless of storage age. In a 3- year retrospective review of 
transfusions administered to adults with SCD, 896 units were transfused over 407 simple transf usion encounters. Median storage age was 23 days (range: 2- 42 days); 32% of 
units provided were ≥  30 days -old (Karafin et al., 2015) .
41 To evaluate the opi[INVESTIGATOR_249326], we conducted a nation -wide survey (n=90). While only 23% of 
respondents had a storage age restriction policy for patients with SCD, 31% thought that older units were not as effective as younger units, and 65% believed that evidence- based 
policies were needed (Karafin et al., 2015) .
[ADDRESS_303264] deviation of 10 days (range: 5 days - 39 days).  
 Transfusion of older units to adults with SCD stimulates expansion and 
activation of macrophages. Adults with SCD may be susceptible to the effects of an older unit’s physiology because they are prone to infection, chronically inflamed, and poorly equipped to handle excess iron. In a cohort of 40 steady -state adults with SCD, 
we specifically measured m arkers of inflammation and iron excess. High sensitivity C -
reactive protein, a marker of global inflammation, was found to be markedly elevated (median 5.6 mg/L, range 0.4 -60 mg/L; reference range <1.0 mg/L), as was ferritin, a 
marker of iron stores (median 2,969 ng/ml, range 20- 12,300 ng/ml; reference range 13-
400 ng/ml) (Karafin et al., 2015) .
93 
 To characterize whether older units would exacerbate the adult’s pro- inflammatory 
physiology, we next examined activation of macrophages, neutrophils, B and T cells in the peripheral blood of 8 adults with SCD before and after transfusion and 8 adults with SCD who do not  receive transfusion (ages 19- 35). All transfused units were greater than 
14 days old (range, 14 -36 days). In support of our hypothesis, we identified that absolute 
macrophage and neutrophil numbers were higher post -transfusion compared to pre 
transfusion in 5/8 (63%) and 6/8 (75%) subjects, respectively. There was also evidence of macrophage activation post -transfusion ( Figure 2 ). Among transfused subjects, 
9 
 macrophages increased in size in 7/8 (88%) subjects, and showed greater expression of 
CD64+ (12% increase) and CD62L (34% increase) as measured by [CONTACT_249367] (MFI) [ADDRESS_303265]’s contribution to repeat encounters, was used to define the association between infection and storage age. This model revealed that a 
mean unit age > 25 days old was associated with a significant increase in ED or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_249327] (p=0.03). After receipt of older units, adults developed 
pneumonia (n=6), urinary tract/kidney infections (n=2), gynecologic infections (n=2), an ear infection (n=1), a wound infection (n=1), and sepsis (n=1). Eight (62%) of these infections contributed to a subsequent inpatient admission (Karafin et al., submitted for 
publication) . 
 Our
 preliminary data demonstrates the need for a prospective, randomized trial to 
characterize the effects of an older unit’s physiology on adults with SCD. Because little 
data exist, blood bank directors across the country have varied policies about the provision of older units to adults with SCD. At our institution, adults are frequently transfused with older units, which we have shown activate macrophages and, ultimately, promote infection.  
 Summary:  Finding ways to maximize the safety and efficacy of red cell transfusion 
therapy for patients with SCD is  desperately needed. Our group has data suggesting that 
older units of stored red cells contribute to immune activation and the increased risk of infection. If found to be effective, restricting transfusions to PS -low, younger units of blood 
in this population has the potential to improve patient outcomes and significantly alter the field of transfusion medicine.  
 2. OBJECTIVES  
 2.1: Primary Aims  
 Note: T his randomized clinical study should be considered a feasibility  study to determine 
the ability to design and run a protocol of this nature.  Each Aim was specifically selected 
Figure 2:  CD64 macrophage activation at 
time 0 and 24 hours in adults with SCD not 
transfused (A), transfused (B)  and a 
comparison between not transfused and transfused (C). Macrophages were identified by 
[CONTACT_398]14 expression (rectangles on scatter plots in (A) and (B)), and further analyzed for activation by [CONTACT_398]64 expression (histograms gray=time 0, red=24 hours). There is a trend suggesting transfused subjects have a greater increase in 
CD64 + macrophages  [ADDRESS_303266] transfusion.

 to maximize the possibility  that novel information could be  obtained from this trial. 
However, power calculations and associated precision estimates should be considered 
preliminary, as the data derived from this study will inform the calculations necessary to 
design a larger, more definitive study.   
 Aim 1:  
To characterize the physiologic differences between > 3
 0 vs < 10 day -old units. As part of 
the randomized study, we will measure PS exposure on donor red cells, as well as PE, microparticles, plasma free hemoglobin, heme, and NTBI.  We hypothesize that >[ADDRESS_303267] significantly more biochemically  old units  (see section 10  for the 
definition ) than <10 day -old units.   With a total sample size of 40 patients (20 in each 
group), we will have at least 80% power (α=0.05) to detect a difference of at least 47% between the two randomized groups for biochemically old red cell units (close to a 100% difference is expected).  
 A
im 2:  
To qu antify  whether physiologic differences between >30 day-old units  versus <10 day -
old units promote immune cell activation in transfused adults with SCD. We will perform flow cytometry to measure the activation of monocytes  and neutrophils , as well as 
measure cell -free hemoglobin, heme and NTBI on blood samples before, 2, and 24 hours 
after transfusion. We hypothesize that those administered > 30 day -old (biochemically old) 
units will have a greater increase in the number of CD62L + activated monocytes at [ADDRESS_303268] -transfusion compared to those administered < [ADDRESS_303269] 80% power (α=0.05) to detect a change in MFI ratio of 
1.35.  
 A
im 3:  
To explore whether the physiology of > 30 day-ol d units  versus  <10 day -old units is 
associated with adverse clinical outcomes in transfused adults with SCD. We will perform a systematic evaluation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614], pain scores, medications, and clinical symptoms prior to each transfusion and at the end of the study period ( Table 1 ). We 
hypothesize that reports of infection will be greater in subjects randomized to receive > 30 
day-old  older units.

2 Secondary Aims  
 Aim 1:   
To explore whether: > [ADDRESS_303270] significantly greater  mean 1) 
phosphatidylethanolamine expression, 2) cell free hemoglobin concentration, 3) cell free heme expression, and/ or 4) NTBI expression in comparison to < 10 day -old units.  
      
11 
 Aim 2 :  
To explore whether:  
 
1) Those administered >[ADDRESS_303271] -transfusion compared to those administered < 10 day units.  
 2) Those administered >[ADDRESS_303272] a greater increase in the 
concentration of NTBI, cell free hemoglobin, and free heme, compared to those administered <[ADDRESS_303273] transfusion.  
3) Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_249328], PE, and microparticle expression will increase more between 2 and 24 hours after receiving > 30 day -old units than after receiving <10 day  units.  
 Aim 3:  
To explore whether t ho
 se administered >[ADDRESS_303274] a more rapid increase 
in the concentration of HbS% and a more rapid decrease in hemoglobin over time compared to those administered < 10 day -old units.  
 Aim 4:  
To explore whether those administered > [ADDRESS_303275] transfusion than those provided < 10 day -
old units.   
 Ai
m 5: 
We will address aspects of study feasibility, such as subject drop- out, rates of missing 
data, and the confidence intervals/precision of our recorded variables, including PS, PE, 
microparticles, CD62L, and the other recorded clinical variables.

4. TRIAL ENROLLMENT  
 4.1 Screening/Recruitment  
 Patients ≥ 16 years of age undergoing outpatient red cell  transfusion therapy will be 
identified through either the adult outpatient sickle cell clinic at UNC, the Infusion C linic 
at UNC and at  Emory/ Grady Health System. Emory/ Grady Health System will only 
enroll subjects who are ≥ 18 years of age. Basic features of patient medical and surgical 
histories (i.e. age, gender, reason for receiving chronic transfusion therapy) will be recorded.  
 Potentially eligible patients, as described in the previous paragraph, will be approached for study consent prior to their transfusion. Individual center scheduling practices will influence how this contact [CONTACT_249368]. Subjects who consent to the study wi ll be 
assigned a study ID number and have their eligibility status evaluated. If the subject is eligible for the study based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria (section 3.1 and 3.2), they will be enrolled in the study and will be randomiz ed. The availability of suitable products 
(see sections 4.2 and 5.1)  will determined when the study will start for that individual . 
 If a subject is enrolled and receives a red cell transfusion prior to randomization, that subject will still be randomiz ed, and will start the study at their next outpatient red cell 
transfusion appointment, pending the availability of the appropriately aged units . 
 4.2 Stratification and Randomization  Subjects will be randomized to receive RBCs stored either ≤ 10 days at time of transfusion or ≥ [ADDRESS_303276] the institution’s transfusion service to determine whether the transfusion service has enough suitable units stored ≤ 10 days and ≥ [ADDRESS_303277] ’s study 
participation will be postponed, and unit availability will be assessed again prior to their 
next outpatient transfusion.  
 Once the subject has received their first study transfusion, the remaining [ADDRESS_303278]’s eligibility status and ABO/Rh type will be entered into the  data management system. If eligible, the subject will be randomized at the time of 
consent, but no later than 2-[ADDRESS_303279]’s participation in the trial, collecting data, and reporting the data 
into  the data management system  will not have access to the treatment arm 
assignment or information about the age of the RBC products transfused.  
 No alteration will be made to the labels on the RBC units. The expi[INVESTIGATOR_320], collection date, and any processing dates (e.g. irradiation dates) will not be obscured. Medical infusion clinic personnel physically providing the RBC transfusions will verify product and patient identity according to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -specific procedures. These personnel will be 
instructed to not divulge the patients’ randomization assignments. Other infusion clinic staff ( other than those actually infusing RBCs), will be instructed not to seek to identify 
the age of the products the patients are receiving. The subjects themselves will not be informed of their randomization assignment and will also be instructed not to seek to identify the age of the products they are receiving. However , as the key components of 
this study are objective, inadvertent unblinding of the randomization assignment will not 
compromise the validity of the study.  
 5. INTERVENTIONS  
 5.1 Preparation  
  
In Section 5 of this protocol, the term “study RBC units” includes all RBC units provided to a randomized subject, beginning at the time of the first study transfusion  and 
continuing through the end of study . Transfusions will always be ordered based on 
patient need, following all institutional policies and practices. The decision to order (or not order) an RBC transfusion is not dictated in any way by [CONTACT_4690]  
[ADDRESS_303280].  
7. No study RBC unit should be deglycerolized.  
8. No study RBC unit should be irradiated.  
 5.1.2 Preparation of RBC units for subjects randomized to receive units stored ≤ 10 days  
  
All study RBC units released from the blood bank for subjects randomized to receive units stored ≤[ADDRESS_303281] been stored ≤10 days at the time of transfusion.  
 If there are not enough suitable units stored ≤10 days at the time a study RBC t
ransfusion is needed, the blood bank should release suitable units with the minimum 
available storage time. The transfusion itself should not be cancelled or postponed 
because there are not enough suitable units stored ≤ [ADDRESS_303282].  
 5.1.3 Preparation of RBC units for subjects randomized to receive units stored ≥ 30 days  
  
All study RBC units released from the blood bank for subjects randomized to receive units stored ≥ [ADDRESS_303283] been stored ≥ 30 days at the time of transfusion.  
 If there are not enough suitable units stored ≥ 30 days at the time a study RBC t
ransfusion is needed, the blood bank should release suitable units with the maximum 
available storage time. The transfusion should not be cancelled or postponed because 
there are not enough suitable units stored ≥ [ADDRESS_303284].  
 6. SCHEDULE OF MEASUREMENTS  
 6.1 Red Cell Unit Sample Collection:   2 ml blood from each donor unit will be obtained from 6 sterile unit links/segments on the day of the 3 randomized outpatient transfusion events. PE and PS exposure , and 
microparticles,  will be measured  by [CONTACT_249364]2- green, and all flow 
analyses will be recorded using FACSDiVa software. The plasma fraction from each red cell unit will be diverted to  EPR (Bruker Elexys X- band system, Billerica, MA, [LOCATION_003]), a 
Bio-Plex cytokine assay kit (Bio -Rad Laboratories), and a fluorescent immunoassay 
(DxFerr kit) to quantify  concentrations of free heme/hemoglobin, cytokines (IL- 1, IL-6, 
IL-8, MCP -1), and NTBI, respectively.  
 6.2 Patient Sample Collection  (Table 1) : 
  A. One - four weeks prior to the first transfusion:  
-  15ml whole blood for flow cytometry and EPR measurements  
 B. Immediately prior to each  red cell transfusion:  
 - 15ml whole blood for flow cytometry and EPR measurements  
 - 15ml to McLendon Labs  
- blood culture to McLendon Labs (8- 10ml blood/culture bottle)  
- urine to McLendon Labs  (12 ml urine)  
 
C. Two hours after each red cell transfusion  (1 ½- 3 hours)  
 -15ml whole blood for flow  cytometry and EPR measurements  
 - 15ml to McLendon Labs  
 D. 1 day  after each red cell transfusion  (about 21 -27 hours after)

urinalysis (12 ml) and blood culture (8-10ml/bottle) . These clinical labs will be measured 
at intervals specifically defined in Table 1. Individual human samples of plasma and RBC 
will also be sent to Angelo D’Alessandro at the University of Colorado Denver to measure 
lipid metabolites and met abolomic profiles pre vs. post transfusion as an additional 
exploratory goal of this trial . The laboratory of [CONTACT_249391][INVESTIGATOR_249331] 30- 200 individual samples of plasma and RBCs for this purpose. All 
samples will be de- identified.  
 6.3 Patient Clinical Outcomes:  
 A daily pain diary will be used and subjects  will rate their pain on a ordinal numeric pain 
rating scale (0- 10), indicate whether the pain was consistent with a “crisis,” indicate 
whether they utilized a healthcare facility, and record the amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_27251]. Infection symptoms will also be documented daily along with the type, duration, and dose of any antibiotics  taken if applicable. Subject ED and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48193] , and etiologies 
(see definitions in 6.7),  will be recorded at regular intervals by [CONTACT_249371].  Of note, diary 
completeness will be assessed at each face- to-face visit.  
 6.4 Patient Physical Exam:  
 Prior to each randomized transfusion, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_249332] a basic assessment of the patient. This exam will include a basic interval history (including review of any ED or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042]), a focused review of systems, and a focused physical exam.

 8. ADVERSE EVENT CRITERIA AND REPORTING  
 This study will be using the descriptive terminology developed by [CONTACT_249377]: Common Toxicology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, dated May 28 , 2009. The CTCAE includes a grading 
(severity) scale for each adverse event term. Grades were developed using the following guidelines:  
 Grade 1:  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.   Grade 2:  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated  
 Grade 3:  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life- threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self care ADL.  
 Grade 4:  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
 Grade 5:  Death related to AE.  
 
20 
 In general adverse events  will be reported  as diseases or syndromes whenever 
possible, instead of reporting individual component symptoms, signs, laboratory 
abnormalities or sequelae.    8.1 Definitions  
 Adverse Event (AE) – F
 or this study, it shall be defined as any untoward or unfavorable 
medical occurrence in a human subject  requiring medical intervention (grade 2 or 
above) and outside of standard treatment for their underlying illness (i.e. sickle cell disease) , including any symptom, or disease state , temporally associated with the 
subject’s participation in the research, whether or not considered related to the subject’s participation in the research  
 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) – A
 ny adverse event temporally associated with the 
subject’s participation in research that meets any of the following criteria:  
• r esults in death;  
• is life -threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as 
it occurs);  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] (not 
including usual sickle cell disease pain crises) ;  
• results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
• any other adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition  
 Unexpected Adverse E
 vent – Any adverse event occurring in one or more subjects in  
a research protocol, the nature, severity, or frequency of which is not consistent with  
either:  
• the known or foreseeable risk of adverse events associated with the procedures involved in the research that are described in (a) the protocol –related documents, 
such as the IRB -approved research protocol or the current IRB -approved 
informed consent document, and (b) other relevant sources of information, such as product labeling and package inserts; or  
• the expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, or condition of the subject(s) experiencing the adverse event and the subject’s predisposing risk factor profile for the adverse event.  
 Unanticipated problem involving risks to subjects or others (UP):  A
 ny incident, 
experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
• unex pected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the 
IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the 
characteristics of the subject population being studied;  
• related or possibly related to a subject’s participation in the research; and  
21 
 • suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) related to the research than was previously known or recognized.  
 Attribution  
 – the determination of whether an adverse event is related to a transfusion 
procedure.  
 A
ttribution categories:  
1. N ot Related - Event clearly related to other factors (e.g., clinical state, other 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; concomitant drugs)

 8.3. Timeline for Reporting of Adverse Events  Study staff  must fill out an Adverse Event Checklist form within [ADDRESS_303288] (DSMB) is an independent board appointed by [CONTACT_978]. The principal role of the DSMB is to regularly monitor the data from the clinical trial, review and assess the performance of its operations, and make recommendations, as appropriate, to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_32397].  
 The PI [INVESTIGATOR_133203] 24 hours of learning of an event when a serious adverse 
event possibly, probably or definitely related to red cell transfusion or an event resulting in death (regardless of attribution) is reported. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_249338]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_249339]’s treatment arm assignment. Following the review, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_877] a log summarizing the event .  
 The DSMB chairperson will receive information on all serious adverse events possibly, 
probably, or definitely related to red cell transfusion and all events resulting in death 
(regardless of attribution). The DSMB chair  has expertise in benign hematology and 
transfusion medicine, will review the serious adverse event materials, and determine if 
the information is complete.  
 The DSMB members will meet annually  via teleconference. All adverse events will be 
reviewed during the call, and the group will vote if additional DSMB review is required, 
and make recommendations  about the study . 
 8.5. Reporting Events to Local Institutional Review Boards  
  
The investigator will notify the local Institutional Review Board (IRB) of all adverse events in accordance with institutional policy.

 8.6. Annual DSMB Reports  
 
The DSMB will meet once  a year, either in- person or via teleconference.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_249340] :  
• Accrual totals entered into Velos  
• Adverse event log reports  for each study subject entered into the electronic data 
system 
• Serious adverse event reports for each study subject entered into the electronic data collection system   
• Study compliance issues  if applicable  
• The DSMB will also be provided each subject’s study arm assignment by [CONTACT_249378], [CONTACT_9688][INVESTIGATOR_249341].  
 
The DSMB will define: 
• All-cause mortality, with p- value to compare.  
• Number, type, and severity of serious adverse events, overall and by [CONTACT_2939]. No formal stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_249342].  
• Number of  subjects in each treatment arm with at least one clinically documented 
infection leading to an ED or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_124028] p -value. No formal stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_249343].

complete. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_249346], serious infection and pain crisis requiring ED or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. For these two outcomes, yearly looks at the data will take place. Therefore, three  looks at the data (including the final look) are 
anticipated.  
 In designing the study, a serious infection difference of 20% between the [ADDRESS_303289] an infection rate  difference of 47- 56% between the two arms. Any 
statistically significant difference in serious infection or pain admissions between the two arms will be considered as evidence for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_4557].  
    
[ADDRESS_303290] 40 total individuals aged 16- 60 years who are managed with chronic 
transfusions at UNC or Emory and will meet the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
This study will not attempt to stratify the study population for age or gender.   
 10.2. Analysis Plan  
  
The analysis will be an intent to treat (ITT) with all those randomized being included in the study. For all aims, the distribution of, and relationship between, variables will be explored with summaries, plots, and tree analysis.  All statistical estimates of population 
parameters will be tabulated along with corresponding confidence intervals (CIs). A ll 
hypothesis tests yielding large p- value (e.g., p > α) will be reported as being inconclusive.  
[CONTACT_9688][INVESTIGATOR_249341], the lead biostatistician,  or her designee,  will perform these analyses. 
Where necessary for parametric assumptions, appropriate transformations will be employed with justification for their use; otherwise, non- parametric tests will be used. P-
values will be reported without dichotomization wherever applicable. Data obtained from transfusion events where units of the appropriate age could not be obtained (study deviation) will be excluded from a subanalysis of the dataset, and the same distribution of, and relat ionship between, variables will be explored with similar summaries, plots, and 
tree analysis  as in the ITT analysis.  All subjects, regardless of age and gender , will be 
analyzed together as one cohort.  Statistical software used in this study will be Cytel, 
StatXact and LogXact, SAS version 9. 4, and Salford systems CART (Classification and 
Regression Trees). To adjust for multiple comparisons, we will use the false discovery rate approach which is less conservative than the Bonferroni approach. Missing data: Logistic regression will be used to investigate the possible causes for missing data and to investigate if data are missing at random (MAR). Reasons for missing data will be documented in the study database. We do not anticipate any missing data or drop- outs, 
but we will monitor these events . Assuming data are MAR, multiple imputations will be 
used for items, and for repeated measures, a random effects models will be used; the structure for the variance covariance matrix will be explored under the constraints of sample size. A sensitivity analysis will also be performed to evaluate the 
robustness/fragility of the study’s main results to reasonable perturbations of the statistical methods and assumptions used.  Results of the sensitivity analyses will only be 
used to guide trust in the main results.  
 10.2.[ADDRESS_303291] : 
PS – Measured as a p ercent of RBC positive  
PE – Measured as a p ercent of RBC positive  
25 
 Microparticles – Measured by [CONTACT_249379]62L – Measured as percent of monocytes positive  
Plasma free hemoglobin – M easured as mg/dL  
Non-transferrin bound iron – Measured as mg/dL  
Rate of clinical infections – Measured as number per days on study  
 
Aim 1:  
The primary outcome measure i s the proportion of biochemically old red cell units. 
Previous studies and our own work have suggested that PS, PE, and microparticles 
increase in a sigmoidal fashion over time .7,10 For this study, the cut -off for a biologically 
old unit would be the point at which the sigmoidal curve enters its log phase, which for PE, PS, and microparticles will be the mean value at day 21, or 8%, 3%, and 3/μl respectively  based on these preliminary studies . This cutoff is biologically meaningful 
and is supported temporally by [CONTACT_249380].
119 Consequently, biochemically old units will be defined as having either a 
surface PE, surface PS, or a microparticle concentrations ≥ the a priori -defined cutoff. 
We will compare the transfusions provided to the two groups (the proportion of biochemically old units when stored ≥30 days compared to when stored ≤10 days) using a Fisher exact test at an alpha of 0.05. Power : With a total sample size of 40 patients 
(20 in each group), we will have at least 80% power (α=0.05) to detect a difference of at 
least 47% between the two randomized groups for biochemically old red cell units (close 
to a 100% difference is expected).  
 Exploratory: We will calculate  the mean, minimum, and maximum levels of PS, PE, and 
microparticles for each study group, and w e will compare the secondary outcome 
measures of  plasma free hemoglobin, heme, and NTBI and also PS, PE, and 
microparticle  concentrations using a two sided two sample t -test at an alpha of 0.05. We 
will also plan for auxiliary analyses that characterize the relationship between the PS level and the age (days) of the RBC units.  This  analysis will focus on estimation of the 
mean PS, PE, and microparticle level as a function of age (days), visualization of the 
data values, estimation of correlation coefficients, and evaluation of how well age (days) predicts PS, PE, and microparticle levels. 
 
Aim 2:  
The primary outcome measure i
 s the change in CD62L (activated) circulating 
monocyte/macrophage MFI at [ADDRESS_303292] pre-
transfusion. We will compare the two groups (≥30 day -old compared to ≤10 day -old unit 
exposure) using a two sample two- sided t -test of the log at an alpha of 0.05. Power: We 
will have at least 80% power to detect a change in the ratio of 1.[ADDRESS_303293] -transfusion if 
the variability is similar to that seen in our preliminary data.   
 Exploratory: W e will use a general(ized) linear model to include biochemically old units 
transfused (Aim 1 outcome), regardless of unit age, as a covariate in our analysis. Other 
co-variates in this model will include free heme, cell free hemoglobin, and NTBI. We will 
similarly compare other obtained activation measures  as outcomes : activation markers 
for monocytes, neutrophils (as listed in section 6 ) and measured plasma cytokine 
26 
 concentrations  (section 6) . We will also plan for auxiliary analyses of the outcome 
variables in which the explanatory variable is the age (days) of the RBC units  --to 
characterize the degree to which age (days) can accurately predict the clinical and physiologic outcome measures  defined. Lastly, as an exploratory aim, we will evaluate 
the in vivo change in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_249347]/PS positivity at [ADDRESS_303294] 
transfusion.  
 Aim 3:  
The primary outcome variable is the rate of post -transfusion infections in the patient.  
The primary estimand is the treatment effect defined as the difference between the regimen- specific proportions of patients in the target populations that would experience 
post-transfusion infections.  This population parameter will be estimated as a function of 
the proportions observed in the sample of patients st udied.  The point estimate will be 
reported along with the corresponding 95% confidence interval estimate.  The presence 
of an indwelling catheter will be used as a key co- variate in this analysis. Power: A 
difference of 20% will be of clinical interest. We do not expect to have adequate power 
for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_249348] 0.[ADDRESS_303295] a difference of 47% between the proportions.  
 Exploratory: We will explore the relationship of blood age and transfusion of 
biochemically old red cell units on the change in Hb and HbS% over time, daily pain scores (0-10 as an ordinal scale), opi[INVESTIGATOR_249349], ED and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103103], 
infection symptoms, new alloantibody formation, and antibiotic use during the 3- month 
study period. We will compare groups using a Fisher exact test.  We will also plan for 
auxiliary analyses of the outcome variables in which the explanatory variable is the age (days) of the RBC units  --to characterize the degree to which age (days) can accurately 
predict the clinical and physiologic outcome measures  defined.   
 AIM 4: We will calculate the mean, median, minimum, and maximum levels of each metabolic compound analyzed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Alessandro in his laboratory at the University of Colorado. Analysis tools and methods will be determined by [CONTACT_249381], and will focus on changes in the patient and the unit pre and post transfusion.  
 AIM 5:  Feasibility Analysis: We will assess important variables necessary to develop a future 
larger clinical trial on this subject.  Areas that we will investigate during the course of this trial will include frequency and content of missing data, subject drop out rates, and estimates  of outcome measure precision. For this study, we will evaluate the number of 
males, females, and adolescents that enroll in the study to inform  future studies. We do 
not expect there to be differences in the key outcomes based on th ese variables,  and 
plan to analyze all [ADDRESS_303296] anding edits, 
generated upon completion of data entry, will enable continuous cleaning of data.

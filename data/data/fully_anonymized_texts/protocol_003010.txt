We determined prior to enrollment (but after initial approval) that  our sample size needed to be extended to [ADDRESS_52222] a 20% difference in total pushing time.
Justification for the Modification
After initial study approval by [CONTACT_1201], but prior to actually beginning enrollment, our team re-calculated our power
 analysis because we realized we did not account for the fact that the duration of the second stage of labor is not a
 normally distribute variable. For this reason, at the onset we recalculated the sample size. In order to be powered
 to detect a 20% reduction in pushing time, we need a total of 348 patients enrolled (174 patients per arm). We are
 requesting approval to enroll for a total of [ADDRESS_52223]

When the application is complete, it will be sent to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_49792], obstetric practices now allow for prolonged second stage of labor
 to accomplish vaginal delivery. However, this practice is not without risks and may lead to either operative delivery
 (vacuum or forceps assisted delivery) or cesarean section with significant maternal/neonatal morbidity. While the use
 of a dental support device in labor is not yet standard of care, limited evidence suggests that using such a device
 while pushing may improve maternal valsava and lead to a shortened second stage of labor by [CONTACT_49799]. Previous studies have been underpowered to find statistically significant results.
At our institution, we have a unique and heterogeneous inner-city population of laboring mothers with marked rates
 of maternal obesity. Our objective is to conduct a randomized controlled trial in which nulliparous patients are asked
 to use a dental support device throughout the entirety of the second stage of labor (while pushing with contractions).
 Our primary outcome is the duration of the second stage. Secondary outcomes will include cesarean section and
 operative delivery rates, as well as combined maternal and neonatal morbidity (Rates of post-partum hemorrhage,
 chorioamnionitis, perineal trauma, fetal weight, neonatal apgars etc…).
In this study we will use the dental support device, Laboraide, produced by [CONTACT_49800]. The device has Class 1 FDA
 approval, under the classification of non-fluid filled teething-ring device. Premarket review by [CONTACT_49801]: Office of Device Evaluation (ODE), Division of Anesthesiology, General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],
 Infection Control, and Dental Devices (DAGRID) and Dental Devices Branch (DEDB). The device is marketed
 to laboring patients in the US and Europe to potentially help reduce pain and more efficiently produce a valsalva
 while pushing in labor. Finally, the device is not currently in use at MSSM. It will be purchased through OB/GYN
 departmental research funds and it is only being purchased for use in this study.

Page [ADDRESS_52224] several decades the rate of cesarean section has risen significantly in the [LOCATION_002] to
 approximately 33% in 2013. This is particularly alarming given the increased risk for major maternal morbidity
 including abnormal placentation and hemorrhage associated with multiple repeat cesarean sections. In an effort to
 reduce the rate of cesarean section, obstetric practices now allow for prolonged second stage of labor to accomplish
 vaginal delivery. However, this practice is not without risks and may lead to either operative vaginal delivery (vacuum
 or forceps assisted delivery) or cesarean section. Maternal complications associated with these outcomes include
 higher rates of postpartum hemorrhage, febrile morbidity and perineal trauma. Furthermore, a prolonged second
 stage increases the risk for NICU admission, neonatal sepsis and asphyxia as well as lower Apgar scores.[1] 
Techniques to increase the effectiveness of pushing may lead to a shortened second stage.
Dental support devices may improve maternal valsava through several mechanisms. These include increased muscle
 strength in different muscle groups[2-5], increased isometric endurance during the pushing phase[6], increased
 maintenance of physical activity[7], and optimization of head and neck posture, causing increased cervical muscle
 strength and enhancing the valsalva maneuver, which increases the intrauterine pressure[8, 9] Matsuo et al. [9]
 conducted a pi[INVESTIGATOR_49793] a dental support device during the second
 stage and found a reduction in the duration of pushing. Because it was a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], it was not powered to find
 statistically significant results. This was followed by a randomized controlled study by [CONTACT_49803]. [10] in which
 nulliparous Israeli women selected at random were asked to use the device while pushing in labor. They found
 a reduction in the rate of obstetric interventions (cesarean section and operative vaginal delivery) performed for
 prolonged second stage, however no difference was found in the overall duration of the second stage between
 groups. A major limitation was the requirement that experimental subjects only push with the device for a total of [ADDRESS_52225] been no further studies to investigate the role of dental support devices in the second stage of labor. The
 existing evidence suggests that women who are actively pushing in labor may benefit from improvements in strength,
 endurance and posture which may be attained using a dental support device.[9, 10] At our institution, we have a
 unique and heterogeneous inner-city population of laboring mothers with marked rates of maternal obesity. In line
 with national trends, our cesarean section rate has risen over the last several decades. We welcome any intervention
 which may reduce the duration of the second stage and thereby [CONTACT_49804]. 
Our objective is to conduct a randomized controlled trial in which nulliparous patients are asked to use a dental
 support device throughout the second stage of labor. Our primary outcome is the duration of the second stage.
 Secondary outcomes will include cesarean section and operative delivery rates, as well as combined maternal and
 neonatal morbidity (Rates of post-partum hemorrhage, chorioamnionitis, perineal trauma, fetal weight, apgars etc…)

Other Aspects that Could Increase Subjects Vulnerability
The risks to subjects are inherent to the labor process itself outside of the study. The only difference in care is the use
 of a dental support device during the second stage. This may potentially shorten the duration of active pushing and
 perhaps reduce the number of cesarean sections performed for arrest of descent. There is no inherent risk to using
 the device in labor as has been evidenced by [CONTACT_49808] ([1] Aviram et al., [2] Matsuo et al.)
The patients in our study are all laboring nulliparous women in the second stage of labor.  All women in this study
 will have access to labor analgesia as requested by [CONTACT_102].  In addition, enrollment in this study will not alter the
 current strategies regarding labor analgesia or induction protocols.

Safeguards to protect Subjects rights and welfare
There is always the risk of loss of confidentiality; however, there are procedures in place to minimize this risk. To
 ensure confidentiality, the following system will be adhered to: When subjects are enrolled in this study, they will
 be assigned a unique identification code.  Corresponding medical record numbers for each code (keycode) will be
 stored in a password locked document on the MFM server that can be accessed only by [CONTACT_49809]. At the conclusion of the data extraction, the outcome variable will be assessed and the key codes to the
 medical record numbers will no longer be necessary and that information will be permanently erased from the
 keycode file. Electronic data with identifiers will be encrypted according to Data Security Standards.

Eligible participants will be asked by [CONTACT_49811] a study aimed at decreasing
 the duration of the second stage of labor. Subjects who are interested will meet with study personnel. All aspects
 of the study will be explained. Those subjects who are interested will undergo the informed consent process. After
 informed consent, patients will be randomly assigned to one of the 2 arms of the study; to use of a dental support
 device in the second stage (intervention arm) or labor without a dental support device (control group). 
How Participants Will Be Identified
Participants will be identified after they are admitted to labor and delivery. If the patient is expected to delivery
 vaginally (i.e. the patient does not intend to delivery by [CONTACT_49812]), the admitting provider will ask the patient
 if they are interested in learning more about our study. This conversation will occur immediately at the time of
 admission. The patient will then be approached by [CONTACT_49813]. Patients will be given a unique
 study ID for identification purposes.

11. Procedures - Narrative
Description of the Study Design
This study is considering how the use of a dental support device may reduce the overall time to vaginal delivery in the
 second stage of labor. We will also assess other maternal and neonatal outcomes including rate of cesarean section,
 risk of infection (i.e. chorioamnionitis), bleeding, uterine atony, cesarean delivery and use of regional analgesia.
Description of Procedures Being Performed
At the time of randomization, patients in the intervention group will receive a new dental support device. The device
 is similar in appearance to a traditional athletic mouth guard but is designed to be comfortable and much less bulky.
 It is made of durable BPA free cushioned material which is easily placed in the mouth and fits between the patient's
 molars with a connecting bridge that fits in front of the patient's incisors. Patients will be asked to wear the device
 while pushing in the second stage and will be directly observed during the second stage by [CONTACT_49814]. In between pushes the patient may either remove the device or leave it in place.
 We believe there is minimal risk associated with the use of a dental support device in the second stage of labor. 
 Use of such a device has been well described in the Obstetric literature as safe with minimal risks. ([1] Aviram et al.,
 [2] Matsuo et al.) Patients randomized to the control group will not receive a Laboraide device and will push in the
 second stage of labor without the use of a dental support device.

Description of the Source Records that Will Be Used to Collect Data About Subjects 
Data will be collected from documentation in the electronic medical record (EPIC).
Providers (either nurse or physician) caring for the patient in the second stage of labor will also be given a Second
 Stage Data Collection Sheet to be completed immediately after delivery in order to ensure accurate documentation
 of full dilation and time spent pushing in labor.
Finally, data will be collected from surveys that are completed after delivery by [CONTACT_49815] a
 device.
Description of Data that Will Be Collected Including Long-Term Follow-Up
Data collected will include demographic variables such as age, parity, BMI, , as well as gestational age, bishop
 score, indication for induction, mode of delivery, time to full dilation, time to delivery, epi[INVESTIGATOR_14001], and length of
 ruptured membranes. Neonatal outcomes including birthweight, apgars, NICU admissions will be assessed, as well
 as maternal outcomes including EBL, chorioamnionitis, and tachysystole.
Data will be analyzed on an intention to treat basis. Statistical analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_49816] X [ADDRESS_52229] (categorical variables) and student t-test or Mann-Whitney U test (continuous variables). Statistical
 significance will be set at p<0.05.

Where and When Consent Will Be Obtained
All research-related discussions will be held in the patient's private room. Any questions will be answered and fully
 discussed to maximize patient comfort.  If they chose to participate they will be randomized and receive care within
 the accepted standards. 
Waiting Period for Obtaining Consent
The consent process will take place after admission to the labor floor and before the onset of the second stage of
 labor. It is not feasible to consent patients prior to the onset of labor as the majority of patients who deliver at Mount
 Sinai receive their prenatal care in locations a various private offices in [LOCATION_001] City. Their first presentation to the
 Mount Sinai labor floor is generally either for a planned induction of labor or because they are already experiencing
 contractions in the early/first stage of labor.

Justification for Not Enrolling Non-English Speaking Participants
The patient will be consented after admission to the labor floor and informed consent will be obtained in the patient's
 private room. All study participants must be English speaking. Due to limited funding for individual fellow projects,
 the majority of available resources will be directed to acquiring devices for our study and we will not have the
 resources to translate the consent into other languages. Furthermore, the Laboraide device only supplies product
 documentation in English and Hebrew. We will be following SOP HRP-[ADDRESS_52231] will include demographic variables such as age, parity, BMI, as

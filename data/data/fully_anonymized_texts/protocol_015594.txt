PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
Study Title  An Evaluation of Virtual Psychiatric Transition of Care (VPTC) Offered in 
Behavioral Health Settings  
Study 
Design  A stepped -wedge trial assessing 30-day acute care utilization  
Study 
Objectives  The primary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of a post inpatient discharge 
virtual psychiatric care team  compared to standard  care, to reduc e 30-day all cause 
non-elective acute care utilization (ED, observation, and inpatient encounters).  
 
Secon dary objectives  of the evaluation include:  
• Compare the effectiveness of the VPTC program compared to standard care, 
on 60 -day all cause non-elective acute care utilization (ED visits, 
observation, and inpatient encounters).  
• Compare the effectiveness of the  VPTC program compared to standard care, 
on 30 -day behavioral health acute care utilization (ED visits, observation, 
and inpatient encounters).  
• Examine the percent of patients that had a behavioral health  office visit 
within [ADDRESS_965092]  of care  
• Examine the count of all cause avoidable ED visits within 30 days of 
discharge  
Exploratory  analys es: 
• Count of patients: Identified, Refused, Enrolled, Graduated, Did not graduate 
and reason  
• Characterize: demographics and Charlson comorbidity score  
• Assess symptom improvement  
o Suicidal ideation:  
▪ Percent of patients with a PHQ -9, Question 9=0 upon 
graduation among patients with an initial Q9>0 
o Depression reduction:  
▪ Percent of patients with a 5 point reduction of their PHQ -9 
score who had an initial PHQ -9 score ≥ 10  
▪ Show the distribution of PHQ -9 score reduction among 
participants  
o Depression remission: Percent of patients with a PHQ -9 score <5 
upon graduation who had an initial PHQ -9 score ≥ 5  
Inclusion  
Criteria  Inclusion  criteria: 
• Residency or shelter in North Carolina  
• 18 years of age or older on the day of discharge  
Version Number: 1. 1 
Version Date: 10-08-21 
  
4 • Access virtual care (phone/video)  
• Discharged from a behavioral health hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6879] a behavioral health unit  
Exclusion criteria: None  
Study 
Procedures  The V PTC program has a focus on removing obstacles and social determinants that 
often impede patients from engaging in post hospi[INVESTIGATOR_709756].  This program 
would support vulnerable patients, engaging them in virtual services to assist their 
transition to appr opriate and patient centered outpatient care.  
 
This study is comprised of a pi[INVESTIGATOR_17371] a pragmatic trial.  
 
For the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], the Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation (CORE) team will 
lead a qualitative evaluation of the psychiatric virtual transition of care (VPTC) 
program’s implementation. The study team will gather first -hand accounts from 
patients and clinicians regarding their program experiences and program utilization. 
Changes to the program can be made as needed to optimize enrollment  and 
implementation. The qualitative evaluation will assess the strengths and weaknesses 
of the VPTC program so modifications can be implemented . The pi[INVESTIGATOR_709757] a part of the trial.  
 
For the trial, the VPTC program will be compared to standard care through a cluster 
randomized by [CONTACT_3725], stepped -wedge design. Behavioral Health facility or units that 
have discharged patients meeting inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned as 
either an intervention or standard care site. Intervention s ites will be those using the 
VPTC program. This evaluation design will integrate into current workflows for the 
measurement of outcomes. Prior to discharge, patients may be referred to the VPTC 
program if they report residency or shelter in North Carolina,  are 18 years of age or 
older on the day of discharge and can access virtual care (phone/video).  
The VPTC program  is defined by [CONTACT_368872] :  
• Introduction to the patient follow -up process  
• Psychiatric consultation  
• Medication management services w ith pharmacological consultation  
• following of Health Coaching participation  (Movement, Nutrition, Sleep 
Hygiene, Stress Management, Pain Management, Perinatal/Postpartum 
Mood Disorders, Substance abuse) and provide treatment 
recommendations  
• Tracking of beh avioral health symptoms (Depression, Anxiety, Suicidal 
ideation) and provide treatment recommendations  
• Health coaching; Psychoeducational support  
• Treatment and safety planning  
• Appointment reminders  
• Coordination for financial assistance  
• Assistance connectin g with an outpatient care provider  
• Placement into an appropriate case management program, if needed

9 2. BACKGROUND  
The successful transition to outpatient care after behavioral health inpatient services or discharge from an 
emergency department (ED) is critical to reducing suicide risk and deterioration of mental health due to 
disease. Social determinants, limited netw ork of outpatient care providers and disease progression often 
impede patients from accessing outpatient care after discharge. 2018 data from The National Committee for 
Quality Assurance demonstrated that 27.5% of Medicare patients Health Care attended the ir outpatient 
follow up appointment after discharge from inpatient psychiatric care. The percent for Medicaid patients 
was slightly higher at 35.8% and privately insured patients had a show rate of 46.6%. After interviewing 
patients who were readmitted to Atrium Health Behavioral Health (AH BH) inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], it was 
determined that additional support in that critical period after discharge is needed to assist patients in 
successfully transitioning to outpatient care.  
 
The Virtual Psychiatric Transiti on of Care (VPTC) program offers support and services to patients in the 
immediate post discharge period to minimize suicide risk, decrease avoidable ED and inpatient care, while 
helpi[INVESTIGATOR_709760]. The V PTC program provides a robust virtual care delivery system for patients as they 
transition from inpatient to outpatient care by [CONTACT_6406][INVESTIGATOR_709761] -risk 
transition periods.  
 
3. RATIONALE  
The foundational idea for the VPTC program came from the Atrium Health Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_709762]. A behavioral health care 
team comprised of licensed clinicians (Behav ioral Health Professionals) , health coaches , a consulting  
psychiatric pharmacist and psychiatric providers  follow patients for 45 days  or more depending on patient 
need after their acute care encounter . Patient enrolled in the VPTC program will receive the following core 
components:  Introduction to the patient follow -up process, psychosocial assessment, tracking and treatment 
recommendations for (residential movement, nutrition, sleep hygiene, stress management, pain 
management, perinatal/postpar tum mood disorders, substance abuse), tracking and treatment 
recommendations for behavioral health symptoms (depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, etc.), placement 
into an appropriate case management program if needed, navigation to additional psychiatri c or substance 
use services if needed, and motivational interviewing and brief therapeutic recommendations if needed.  
 
For patients that have attempted suicide, they will begin the VPTC program following the zero suicide 
pathway. The Atrium Health Behavio ral Health Service Line created the ‘Zero Suicide pathway’, in 2019 
for those patients identified as “high risk” for suicide when leaving inpatient units. Zero Suicide is a 
national movement sponsored by [CONTACT_941] 2012 National Strategy for Suicide Prevention, N ational Alliance for 
Suicide Prevention, Suicide Prevention Resource Center and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Services Administration (SAMHSA). It is a programmatic approach to keep patients from falling through 
the cracks in a fragmented and disco nnected healthcare system and is based on the belief that suicide is 
preventable, and suicide deaths are not fated. Since  access to mental health services is constrained in our 
community, patients often fall through the cracks when transitioning between po ints of care.   
 
Version Number: 1. 1 
Version Date: 10-08-[ADDRESS_965096], we are not enrolling t owards a targeted patient accrual. We 
will enroll patients during a pre -determined data collection period, See Section 5. 
4.2. Accrual  – Subjects  
 
Patients [ADDRESS_965097], and discharged from a behavioral health hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6879] a behavioral 
health unit  will be considered exposed to the intervention,  whereas patients seen at locations  not 
utilizing the VPTC  program will be considered exposed to usual care. Patients who are in the 
intervention arm will be treated by [CONTACT_368885] (licensed clinicians , health coaches , 
a psychiatric pharmacist , and psychiatric  providers ). Virtual visits are co nducted telephonically.  Each 
week  a list of discharged patients will be  received by [CONTACT_368881].  
 
Patients included in the analysis of this  study  must  meet the inclusion \exclusion criteria . Patients will 
begin accruing based on the time the location  goes live according to the role out schedule. The VPTC  
program  is available to any  behavioral health patient,  but the evaluation is centered on the cohort of 
patients meeting the inclusion criteri a. 
 
4.3. Participating sites  
 
The program has been pi[INVESTIGATOR_709763]. AH Stanly  will not be included in the 
quantitative assessment.  As part of the research design and rollout of this project, randomization will 
occur at the site level. CORE will randomize the facility participation order in advance of project 
kickoff. Site enrollment will begin with [ADDRESS_965098].

5.2. Trial Design  
5.2.1.  Justification for stepped wedge cluster randomized control trial  
The primary aim is to assess the effectiveness of a structured multidisciplinary care plan 
(intervention), compared with usual care (control) on 30 -day all cause non-elective acute care 
utilization (ED visits, observation, and inpatient encounters). The VPTC program  will be 
delivered at the level of location  or cluster, thus minimizing contamination and the risk of 
selection bias, if subjects were randomized at the individual level. Therefore, the unit of 
randomization and analysis for this study will be the cluster. Considering logistical constraints 
and design rigor, the intervention will be rolled out sequentially instead of at the same time.  
Moreover, substantial and differential cluster -effects may exist because of distinct volume and 
characteristics  of patients in each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Thus, the stepped wedge design is advantageous 
compared with other alternative designs.  
 
The stepped wedge design implies a baseline period, in which no clusters are exposed to the 
intervention. Then, at the chosen time inter val of three  months, one location  will be randomized 
to cross from the control to intervention (Figure 1). This process continues until all seven  
locations  have crossed over to the intervention. The order of this cross over process will be 
randomized. We w ill use randomization to assign location order so that if a high or low volume 
location is assigned cluster 1, a high or low volume location is assigned cluster 7. The single ED 
location will be assigned to cluster 4. SAS Enterprise Guide version 8.[ADDRESS_965100]

[IP_ADDRESS].  Zero Suicide Pathway  
Depending on the patient’s  reason for admission , patients may start the VPTC program in the  
zero suicide  pathway . Patients that meet criteria for this higher level of care will  have attempted 
suicide . Patients are identified from t he C-SSRS screening tool along with referrals from the 
treatment team and treating psychiatrist. Identified patients are enrolled a day or two prior to 
discharge and then contact[CONTACT_11252] [ADDRESS_965101] . VPTC clinicians will continue to outreach with the patient for the remaining time in the 
VPTC program.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  VPTC  Pathway  
If a patient has not attempted suicide as the reason for admission , VPTC clinicians  will begin 
outreach with the patient within the first [ADDRESS_965102] outreach with the 
patient will be completed by a licensed clinician who will complete a brief psychosocial 
assessment with the patient. After  the initial outreach is completed a health coach will then reach 
out to the patient to set a weekly schedule . The weekly outreac hes with the VPTC health coach 
will be patient centered and patient specific. These outreaches will help support patients through 
goal setting/treatment plans, medication support, linkage and support to community resources, 
and safety planning. These outre aches will also help patients identify any barriers they may have 
in attending their follow up care with their outpatient community providers. Throughout the 
outreaches at any point and time if a patient has a question or concern about their medication the  
VPTC licensed practicing nurse can contact [CONTACT_709771]. At each 
outreach patient’s safety is also assessed. At any point in the outreach if a patient endorses any 
safety concerns that patient will be assessed by a licensed qualified clinician to identify those 
safety concerns and create a safety plan with the patient.  
 
If the patient is scheduled with a VPTC psychiatric provider for a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_274376] -up 
appointment , an LPN (Licensed Practical Nurse) will outreach to  the patient before that visit to 
complete the nursing intake. The patient will then have their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_709764], or the VPTC psychiatric provider. The VPTC psychiatric provider will 
review  medications that the patient started on the inpatient unit or emergency department and 
provide any further education , adjustments , and support. The provider is able to  order the 
medications. The VPTC program will also have support from a psychiatric provider through 
weekly tre atment team huddles to help support patients and identify any barriers they may be 
facing.  
 
Version Number: 1. 1 
Version Date: 10-08-[ADDRESS_965103] completed the program . For example, if a 
patient has Medicaid through a local management entity, a managed care organization providing 
local behavioral health care,  and meets certain criteria , the patient will not require services from 
the VPTC team as they would be duplicative.  
5.3. Patient Graduation  from the VPTC  Program  
• Reached max benefit as deemed by [CONTACT_368885]  
• Unable to connect: 4 calls attemp ted over 12 days  
• Transition to lower level of care  
o Patients who transition to a primary care clinic  
• Transition to higher level of care  
o Psychiatry/Treatment Program  
o Readmission to an Inpatient Facility  
• Declined or no longer interested in services  
• Death  
 
5.4. Continuation of the I ntervention  
Patients may continue enrolling in the VPTC  program  after the study period has ended.   
 
6. QUALITATIVE REVIEW  
A qualitative evaluation will be conducted among the care team and patients at the pi[INVESTIGATOR_709765] . This 
evaluation a ims to evaluate the implementation of the psychiatric virtual transition of care program  and the 
nature of the targeted patient  population . The qualitative data collection for this study will be guided by [CONTACT_709772] (CFIR). The CFIR incorporates several established 
implementation theories into a common framework. Composed of a menu of 39 constructs t hat fall into 5 
domains (intervention characteristics, outer setting, inner setting, characteristics of individual, and process), 
the CFIR is used to design, guide, and evaluate health care delivery interventions by [CONTACT_709773] (Damschroder et al. 2009). Through the aggregation of 
corroborated constructs, the CFIR promotes a systematic and consistent use of implementation measures, 
which help render study findings intelligible and generalizab le. The framework is well -suited to projects 
like the VPTC program as it allows for complex theory -building and cross -study comparisons using a 
common set of constructs while obviating the need to use multiple implementation frameworks.   
     
Semi -structu red CFIR -guided interviews will be conducted with 12 VPTC patients /care takers  and [ADDRESS_965104]’s narrow study aim (Malterud 
et al., 2016). Clinician  interviews will include a diversity  of frontline staff, including, but not limited to, 
nurses, health coaches, psychiatrists , and discharge planners.        
 
Version Number: 1. 1 
Version Date: 10-08-[ADDRESS_965105] been enrolled in the  VPTC program and be targeted  using a convenience 
sample, a non -probability sampli ng strategy commonly used for studying reclusive and reluctant 
populations (Bernard, 2017; Guest et al., 2006).  A VPTC team member will reach out to the patient and ask  
if contact [CONTACT_709774].  A researcher  will call to follow -up 
with and schedule an interview with the patient . During recruitment calls, potential patient -interviewees will 
be assured that their receiving of care is not in any way contingent on consenting to an interview. This 
assertion will be reaffirmed by [CONTACT_709775]. Patients that complete an 
interview will be compensated for their time with a $[ADDRESS_965106].     
 
Clinician -interviewees will be recruited through snowball sampling: The VPTC coordinator  will identify 
and refer clinicians and other relevant staff for interviews, these interviewees will in turn be asked to 
identify other potential respondents. A researcher will send up to two weekly emails to introduce clinicians  
to the qualitative review  and en courage them to contact [CONTACT_709776].  A researchers  will 
schedule an appointment with those who reply to the email and are interested.  All interviews will be 
conducted via telephone and will be audio recorded.  
         
The recorded interviews will be de -identified and then parsed and analyzed using ATLAS.ti 9. The 
analytical approach will be inductive —building theory on patterns found in the data —as such analyses are 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_356983] -suited for exploratory examinations of novel or unde r-studied social phenomena. Coding will 
begin at the question -level, allowing the qualitative team to compare all interviewee answers to a specific 
question. Next. a vertical analysis across interviews will be conducted using the constant comparative 
metho d, a “scrutiny -based technique” (Ryan and Bernard, 2003: 101) foundational to grounded theory, an 
approach in which theory building is based in empi[INVESTIGATOR_709766]. Using this 
comparative method, codes will be produced induct ively and iteratively, as early codes often have a 
contingent and provisional quality and must be delineated and refined through a continual comparison with 
preceding and subsequent data (Boeije, 2002).  During these vertical readings, codes will be used t o 
paraphrase and summarize passages.       
Themes will be developed using the constant comparative method, which provides a framework to 
understand the commonalities and differences within and among interviews, as the method is also a method 
of identifying contrasts. (Bradley, Curry & Devers 2007 ). Themes will be inferred from particular, 
reoccurring instances —through the repeated parsing and partitioned of interview data according to CFIR 
constructs and the relevance to our research questions. Once barriers  and facilitators of implementation have 
been identified using the CFIR framework, recommendation will be drafted to optimize implementation  of 
the VPTC program .  
 
The most immediate risk of the aforementioned data collection procedures to interviewees is the potential 
for embarrassment, should their unredacted interview data be shared. Several measures will be put in place 
to protect the identity and confidentiality of interviewees: recordings of the interviews will be stored on a 
password -protected comput er accessible only to pertinent project staff; transcriptions of the interviews will 
be de -identified, i.e. the names of interviewees, employers, and care providers will be redacted; and 
interview quotes used in subsequent presentations, reports, and publi cations will be anonymized.  
 
7. DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING  
Patient demographics, Charlson comorbidity score , and utilization will be obtained from the electronic 
medical record and billing systems. Data from the initial assessment and follow -up contacts will be stored 
in HealtheCare , a care management platform in Cerner . Data will be retrieved by [CONTACT_368886] h team.  Data may be retrieved retrospective to a patient’s completion of the intervention or

7.1. Sample Size  Analysis  
Calculations of sample size were based on primary analysis  of 30-day non -elective acute care utilization  
on a binary group . Our preliminary data shows that  average unique patients in each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  (cluster 
size) per three months rang ed from 159 to 300, we expected an enrollment rate of 40%. Thus, the 
average effective cluster size is [ADDRESS_965107] an  average cluster size  of 81. With the assumption of detecting a chang e from 20% in the control 
period to 14% in the intervention period for 30-day non -elective acute care utilization, a mean cluster 
size of 81 with seven clusters and seven steps (8 time periods inclusive of a control period) would 
achieve a power of 0.8 9 if intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC)=0. 20 and two -side α=0.05. Holding 
other parameters constant, the larger ICC is, the higher the power we will obtain. The coefficient of 
variation (CV) of sample size is approximately 0. 15. To account for this varying clus ter size, we inflated 
the number of patients by 10% resulting in an average cluster size of 89 patients per three months , 
resulting in a sample size of 2,495 patients among the intervention group and 4,990 patients overall 
inclusive of our control population. In this pragmatic trial, those assigned to the intervention but did not 
enroll in  VPTC during the intervention period  (around 60%)  would also be counted in the intervention 
arm. It is within our expecta tion that intervention arm eventually has smaller reduction in 30-day non -
elective acute care utilization  (i.e. 0.4*0.14 + 0.6*0.20 =17.6% , difference= 2.4% ). However, we still 
ensure a power above 0.80 as long as over 2,495 patients  actually received VPTC.  The power was 
calculated by [CONTACT_325786] 1 5. 
 
7.2. Statistical analysis  
Distributions of baseline characteristics for locations  and patients will be compared between the 
intervention or control periods to assess effectiveness of the randomization, and s tatistical or clinical 
differences will be adjusted in sensitivity analyses. All analyses for treatment and control periods 
comparisons will use an intention -to-treat approach and results will be reported used the CONSORT 
extension to cluster randomized tr ials.  
 
The primary outcome for this study is 30-day all cause non-elective acute care utilization. 
Characteristics of the locations  and individuals will be summarized by [CONTACT_709777], 
locations,  and individuals. The count, rates and 95% c onfidence intervals of 30-day non -elective acute 
Version Number: 1. 1 
Version Date: 10-08-21 
  
17 care utilization in the control period will be presented and compared with that in the treatment period. 
The primary analysis will be conducted using generalized linear mixed models with fixed effects for 
intervention, and intervention multiply by [CONTACT_29623] , accounting for the cluster randomized trial design 
with a random cluster (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]) or time (steps)  effect. We will estimate and report the intra class 
correlation coefficients for all outcome measures to assess assumptions for sample size analyses and for 
future investigations using similar designs and outcomes. The primary analyses will follow the 
intention to treat principle with an additional per protocol analysis including those who actually used 
VPTC . The secondary analyses will include within clus ter comparisons of intervention and control 
periods (not adjusting for any confounding effect of time), as well as comparisons of a series of 
(unbalanced) quasi -parallel cluster trials between those enrolled and unenrolled clusters at each 
intervention enr ollment period. The same analyses plan will also be applied to secondary outcomes.  
 
7.3. Missing Data  
All the related available electronic data will be pulled without missing any subjects. Thus, the missing 
of outcome variables are less likely to occur. However , the missing information on covariables is 
unavoidable. Sensitivity analyses are recommended for trials with missing data. We will compare 
baseline characteristics such as age  and gender between patients with complete follow -up data to those 
with missing data by [CONTACT_709778]. We will conduct sensitivity analyses for the primary and secondary outcomes using several 
methods which have different missing data assumptions: (1) comple te case analyses which assumes 
missing completely at random; (2) multiple imputation using M=10 imputations, which assumes 
missing at random; and (3) assigning poor scores and good scores for missing values differentially by 
[CONTACT_1570], which aligns w ith non -ignorable missingness (the data missingness is related to the 
actual value).  
 
7.4. Training  
Beginning two to three weeks prior to first patient enrolment at the respective location , the VPTC 
program coordinator and those responsible for discharge will begin training on the materials supporting 
the program . This will include communication touchpoints between the coordinator  and discharge 
facilitator.  
 
7.5. Data Collection Dates  
The implementation of the VPTC  program  is expected to  begin in November  [ADDRESS_965108] enrollment 
in July 2023 .

10. SAFETY RISK S AND REPORTING  
The data collection  and intervention for  this project presents no more than minimal risk to patients.  This 
study is evaluat ing the VPTC  program among discharged patients. The program itself is similar to existing 
virtual programs managed by [CONTACT_709780].  The implementation  of the VPTC  program and its components  complement  ongoing patient care 
through virtual patient navigation  within Atrium Health . The addition of an evaluation design that align s 
with existing patient care expansion  thus confers minimal  additional risk to patients.  
Other potential risks of participation in this project include  the risk of health information disclosure. There 
is always the risk of disclosure of a patient’s private health information  (PHI) or medical information. 
However, the processes identified in this protocol to enable the execution of this project,  do not increase 
inherent risk of disclosure. Atrium H ealth  utilizes several  hard and soft safety controls in the protection of 
patient information and medical records. Security controls include, but are not limited to, multiple system 
firewalls, access restrictions to patient records and information, locked offices and bui ldings housing 
research and  patient data, and multiple layers of username [CONTACT_278955].  Statistical tools and programs that are developed are stored on secure restricted access file shares.  
Programs have  versioning controls turned on and access to the file shares are restricted . Access is granted 
through a request process that requires multiple authorizations and is controlled centrally by [CONTACT_368892] .  
The CORE  projec t team will ensure that appropriate handling of patient PHI follows standard Atrium 
Health  procedure. Confidentiality will be maintained according to ICH E6; 4.8.10, part 0: “Records 
identifying the subject will be kept confidential and, to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_29695]/or 
Version Number: 1. 1 
Version Date: 10-08-21 
  
20 regulations, will not be made publicly available. If the results of the study trial are published, the patient’s 
identity will rem ain confidential.’ In the event of PHI disclosure, the appropriate internal departments will 
be informed and processed per legislation and privacy regulations.  
10.1. Data Quality Assurance  
This study will be organized, performed, and reported in compliance with the study protocol, 
standard operating procedures (SOPs) of the CORE  and Atrium Health , and other applicable 
regulations and guidelines (e.g. GCP).  
 
10.2. Safety Reporting to the IRB  
All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the definiti on of a  reportable 
safety event per the IRB guidelines, will be reported to the IRB within  [ADDRESS_965109] operating procedures set forth by [CONTACT_278953] . The Principal Investigator s, statistician, and other team members will meet as 
needed to review  enrollment and retention, study progress , and validity/integrity of the data. 
Documentation of these meetings will be kept with study records.  
11. RESEARCH COMPLETION  
The Principal Investigator s have the right to close the project  at any site at any time.  
For any closure, the following applies:  
• Closure should occur only after consultation between involved parties.  
• In case of a partial study or location  closure, patients still participating in the  VPTC  program , or 
those who are considered in follow -up, must be taken care of in an ethical manner.  
 
The study will be considered complete when one or more of the following conditions is met:  
• The enrollment period has ended, and the data collection period is complete.  
• All subjects have dropped out or discontinued from the study after the enrollment period is 
completed, but prior to data collection cutoff.  
• The IRB  or Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_272849].  
• The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_272850] -off date.  
Version Number: 1. 1

Objective #1. To describe the proportion of children with cutaneous reactions to targeted BRAF, 
MEK, and Pan-RAF inhibitor therapi[INVESTIGATOR_1309] a cohort receiving a daily preventative skin care 
regimen (PSCR) including sun protection, gentle skin care and every other day dilute bleach 
baths at 6 and 12 weeks.
Objective #2. To describe the number of different cutaneous reactions to targeted BRAF, MEK, 
and Pan-RAF inhibitor therapi[INVESTIGATOR_197999], gentle skin care and every other day dilute bleach baths at 6 and 12 weeks.
Objective #3. To describe the severity of cutaneous reactions to targeted BRAF, MEK, and Pan- 
RAF inhibitor therapi[INVESTIGATOR_198000], gentle skin care 
and every other day dilute bleach baths at 6 and 12 weeks. using the following severity scales: 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Overall Dry Skin Score (ODS), 
Hand-Foot Skin Reaction and Quality of Life Score (HFS-14), Pediatric Quality of Life 
Inventory (PedsQL), and Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI).
1.1 Study Design
This prospective, single-arm phase 2 clinical trial will be performed at Dana-Farber 
Cancer Institute/[LOCATION_011] Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]***. Additional external sites will conduct the same 
study concurrently. Data from all sites will be pooled at the end of the study and a meta-analysis 
of all aggregated data will be performed. IRB approval will be obtained prior to initiation of the 
study. This study will include patients receiving MEK inhibitor, BRAF inhibitor or pan-RAF 
inhibitor therapi[INVESTIGATOR_198001]. At this time, we do not have the personnel or 
funding required to coordinate with multiple departments to identify all patients receiving these 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
Baseline data will be obtained from each participant via medical record review, if 
applicable. Baseline data includes, but is not limited to the following: general demographic data 
(age at tumor diagnosis, gender, race), type of primary tumor, type of therapy regimen (targeted 
therapy agents/dose/duration, chemotherapy agents/dose/duration, radiation field 
location/size/dose), past and current immunosuppressive medications, secondary malignancies 
including melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer, and family history of skin diseases.
All patients will undergo skin examinations at the initial study visit, mid-study visit (6 
weeks (+/- 2 weeks)), and at 12 weeks after treatment initiation. Weight-based dosing of MEK, 
BRAF, or Pan-RAF inhibitor therapi[INVESTIGATOR_198002]. If any skin findings are 
present, patients and families will be asked about the timing, frequency, location and severity of 
these skin findings.
Patients will undergo a full mucocutaneous physical examination including skin, mucous 
membranes, hair, and nails during their dermatology visit. Abnormalities will be carefully 
documented, including degree of involvement (% body surface area, number of nails, % of 
scalp).
DF/HCC Protocol #: 19-579 
Protocol Version 3.0 Date: July 24, 2023
Page 7Patients receiving targeted therapy will be evaluated specifically for the following skin 
reactions, previously reported in the literature: follicular skin rash, acneiform skin eruption, 
cheilitis, xerosis, hand foot syndrome, eruptive nevi (defined as > 5 new nevi over a 3 month 
period), keratoacanthoma, squamous cell carcinoma, photosensitivity. Undefined skin reactions 
will also be recorded.
No biopsies will be performed for research purposes. Patients who do not have a 
scheduled Dermatology visit, but have concerning findings on skin exam, will be scheduled for a 
complete dermatology evaluation, where any biopsies would be conducted as clinically indicated 
as part of routine dermatologic care.
2. BACKGROUND
2.1 Study Disease(s)
A recent study by [CONTACT_198019]. shows that cutaneous reactions are common in children receiving 
targeted anti-cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_198003].5 Anti-cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_198004] (dabrafenib, vemurafenib, encorafenib) and MEK inhibitors 
(refametinib, trametinib, selunetinib, comibetinib). Cutaneous reactions occurred in 96% of the 
[ADDRESS_235323] reactions 
are not life threatening, cancer therapy is frequently discontinued due to factors including 
intolerable discomfort (pain, itching) and/or concern regarding one’s appearance.[ADDRESS_235324] 
common reactions are a result of dry skin and sun exposure; thus it is plausible that a simple 
preventative skin care regimen that addresses gentle skin care and sun protection would be 
beneficial. In addition, follicular reactions and paronychia may be ameliorated by [CONTACT_198020], which have been shown to decrease severity of atopic dermatitis in children 
and to decrease inflammation by [CONTACT_100276]-regulating the NF-kappaB pathway.7-9
Compelling in vitro and in vivo data suggests that topi[INVESTIGATOR_198005]B signaling.9 Furthermore, Leung et al demonstrated that topi[INVESTIGATOR_198006]B-dependent genes, and decreased incidence and severity of cutaneous 
reactions to anti-cancer therapy in a mouse model.9 The concentrations of hypochlorite used 
therein mirrored those determined to be safe and efficacious in dilute bleach baths used in the 
treatment of atopic dermatitis in children.10 Emerging literature in atopic dermatitis suggests that 
the mechanism by [CONTACT_198021],11 but 
rather, anti-inflammatory.
Bleach is an inexpensive and widely available topi[INVESTIGATOR_168842]; its use in swimming pools, medical 
clinics and commercially available cleansers speak to minimal toxicity (in dilute concentrations)
DF/HCC Protocol #: 19-579 
Protocol Version 3.0 Date: July 24, [ADDRESS_235325] decade, our knowledge of the molecular composition of pediatric CNS tumors has 
increased dramatically.12 In turn, tumor specific “targeted” therapi[INVESTIGATOR_198007]. Given the shared neuroectodermal origin of the brain and skin, the 
advent of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_198008], including the 
development of nevi and skin cancer during active treatment. Other associated skin reactions 
include xerosis, hand foot syndrome, follicular skin eruptions, and scalp pruritus or burning.
These reactions can be severe enough to require discontinuation or modification of therapy. 
There is also evidence in adults receiving targeted cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_198009] a good prognostic sign.
A recent study was performed by [CONTACT_198019]. at [LOCATION_011] Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_198010] 
# 15-5415. In this cross-sectional study, patients younger than 21 years of age receiving BRAF, 
MEK, and mTOR inhibitor monotherapy for a CNS tumor were enrolled over a one-year period. 
Full body skin examination, photographs of dermatologic findings, and initial treatment 
recommendations were included at the initial visit, and follow-up skin examinations were 
recommended every three months. Twenty-two patients were enrolled in the study. Ninety-six 
percent (21/22) of all patients had at least one skin reaction. The most common reactions across 
treatment groups included follicular/acneiform eruptions and xerosis. Two patients on MEK 
inhibitors and one patient on a BRAF inhibitor required therapy cessation due to severe 
cutaneous reactions5.
Severity Scores
In order to assess the severity of cutaneous reactions to BRAF, MEK and pan-RAF therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], we 
will use the following scores: the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), 
severity of xerosis measured by [CONTACT_198022] (ODS), severity of hand foot 
syndrome measured by [CONTACT_198023]-Foot Skin Reaction and Quality of Life Score (HFS-14), 
Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory General Well-Being Scale (PedsQL), and the Children’s 
Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI).
The Overall Dry Skin Score (ODS) is a clinical assessment of the presence and severity of skin 
dryness using a five- point scale. A score of '0' indicates no skin dryness, whereas a score of '4' 
indicates advanced skin roughness, large scales, inflammation and cracks. This score has been 
used in studies assessing skin dryness in nursing homes and pharmacies.13 The Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) has a standardized grading system for 
adverse events including cutaneous reactions to anti-cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_198011]14. Higher grades of cutaneous reactions have significant impact on quality of 
life and can lead to interruptions in cancer treatment.
The Hand-Foot Skin Reaction and Quality of Life Score (HFS-14) is a scale that has been
DF/HCC Protocol #: 19-579 
Protocol Version 3.0 Date: July 24, 2023
Page 9specifically developed and tested for patients with Hand-Foot Syndrome, which has been 
reported as a symptom of targeted cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The HFS-14 questionnaire was developed 
using standardized methodology for QoL questionnaire development, which consisted of the 
following steps: gathering patient input, generating an exhaustive list of items, reducing the list 
of items, allocating items to domains, pi[INVESTIGATOR_48124], calculation of scores, and validation. A 
working group of experts including oncologists, a dermatologist, a public health physician, and 
health professionals having a good knowledge of HFS and day-to-day experience in the 
management of this condition was constructed for the development of this questionnaire.15 The 
PedsQL is based on a modular approach to measuring HRQOL and consists of a 15-item core 
measure of global HRQOL and eight supplemental modules assessing specific symptom or 
treatment domains. The PedsQL was empi[INVESTIGATOR_198012] 291 pediatric 
cancer patients and their parents at various stages of treatment.16 The Children's Dermatology 
Life Quality Index (CDLQI) is the most widely used instrument for measuring the impact of skin 
disease on quality of life (QoL) in children.17 (Olsen, 2016).
Gaps in care
While cutaneous reactions to targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_198013], no guidelines surrounding management of these reactions currently exists. It is 
imperative for pediatric dermatologists to be involved in not only managing individual patients 
with these reactions, but also in developi[INVESTIGATOR_198014] a whole.
In a recent retrospective study of [ADDRESS_235326] investigated the 
efficacy of therapeutic or preventative measures.
The current skin care guidelines according to the National Cancer Institute are vague and not 
specific for different types of cancer or pediatric versus adult patients. The guidelines 
recommend using mild soaps and lotions, avoiding heating pads and ice packs, shaving less 
often, and using sunscreen and sun-protective clothing. For dry, itchy skin in reaction to cancer 
treatments, these guidelines recommend the following: “Avoid products with alcohol or perfume, 
which can dry or irritate your skin. Take short showers or baths in lukewarm, not hot, water. Put 
on lotion after drying off from a shower, while your skin is still slightly damp. Keep your home 
cool and humid. Eat a healthy diet and drink plenty of fluids to help keep your skin moist and 
healthy. Applying a cool washcloth or ice to the affected area may also help. Acupuncture also 
helps some people.”[ADDRESS_235327] quality of life for these patients.20 Because of the high incidence of cutaneous reactions to

one month, the participant’s registration on the study must be canceled. Registration 
cancellations must be made in OnCore as soon as possible.
4.2 Registration Process for DF/HCC*** Institutions
Applicable DF/HCC*** Policy REGIST-[ADDRESS_235330] be followed.
5. TREATMENT PLAN
This study aims to enroll 8 patients who will all receive in-person and written counseling for a 
daily preventative skin care regimen (PSCR) including instructions for daily safe sun protection, 
daily gentle skin care, nail care and every other day dilute bleach baths before the initiation of 
anti-cancer therapy. Patients will be recruited by [CONTACT_177421]-oncology team.
The preventative skin care regimen (PSCR) is detailed below. Patients will not have to purchase 
the following materials: sunscreen, gentle cleansers, moisturizers, emollients, bleach. These 
materials will be given to patients as the first study visit.
Safe sun protection will include instructions for:
Use of SPF 30+ sunscreen with physical blockers (zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide) 
whenever going outside
Sunscreen to be reapplied every two hours (more often as needed)
Sun-protective clothing including long sleeve, pants, wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses.
Gentle skin care will include:
Daily short, lukewarm showers and water baths
Gentle unscented cleansers (Dove, Cetaphil, Cerave, Vanicream) during bathing
Thick and unscented moisturizing creams (Cerave cream, Vanicream, Cetaphil Cream, 
Dove), and emollients (Aquaphor, Vaseline) immediately following baths or showers 
every day.
Nail care will include:
Trimming nails after bathing (fingernails once a week; toenails once a month)
Keep the fingernails trimmed with a slight curve, but the toenail straight across, to 
prevent hangnails from forming.
Do not pi[INVESTIGATOR_198015].
Cut them off neatly with a clean, sharp pair of scissors or a nail clipper.
Avoid biting nails and trimming cuticles
Patients will also receive in-person and written counseling for every other day, 10-15 minutes 
dilute bleach baths.
Bleach baths will include:

Protocol Version 3.0 Date: July 24, 2023
Page 12Mixing ¼ cup over-the-counter household bleach with ½ full tub of lukewarm water.
Soak for 10-15 minutes
Gently pat dry
Apply gently moisturizers or emollients immediately following bathing
In the case that patients do not have access to a tub and will make bleach bath 
compresses, or if a small infant tub is used, mix [ADDRESS_235331], as we would do clinically.
Products mentioned above to be utilized in the preventative skin care regimen will be paid for by 
[CONTACT_198024]***. External sites will supply their

13.1 Study Design/Endpoints
The primary outcome measure is cutaneous reaction to targeted BRAF, MEK, or Pan-RAF 
inhibitor therapy. Secondary outcome measures include number of different cutaneous reactions 
experienced by [CONTACT_6904], severity of cutaneous reactions measured by [CONTACT_161462] (CTCAE), severity of xerosis measured by [CONTACT_198027] (ODS), severity of hand foot syndrome measured by [CONTACT_198023]-Foot Skin 
Reaction and Quality of Life Score (HFS-14), Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), and 
the Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI).
13.2 Sample Size, Accrual Rate and Study Duration
Sample Size: 22 participants from three sites (DFCI [8], Toronto Sick Kids [7], Lurie Children’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] [7])
Accrual Rate: 6 participants / 1 year
Study duration: ~3 years (3 years of accrual + [ADDRESS_235340] patient 
enrolled)
This sample size is limited due to the rare nature of these cancers, but a total of 22 will be 
sufficient for descriptive analyses. The study team believes that accrual of more than 8 patients 
in a one year period at DFCI/BCH*** is not feasible.

13.5 Analysis of Primary Endpoints
In the overall cohort, the proportion of patients with one or more cutaneous reactions will be 
calculated, and a 95% exact confidence interval will be placed on this proportion.
13.6 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints
In the overall cohort, the minimum, maximum, and quartiles of the number of cutaneous 
reactions per patient will be calculated.
In the overall cohort: To describe the severity of cutaneous reactions, the proportion of patients 
at each CTCAE grade of toxicity, and for each grade of the Overall Dry Skin Score (ODS), will 
be calculated. For each of the following severity scales, the minimum, maximum, and quartiles 
of the scores will be calculated: Hand-Foot Skin Reaction and Quality of Life Score (HFS-14), 
Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), and Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index 
(CDLQI).

2011;16(10):1469-1478.DOI: 10.1634/theoncologist.2011-0033
Scoring:
Each item is scored on a three-point Likert scale: 0, “no, never”; 1, “yes, from time to time”; 2, 
“yes, always.” Two separate questions include one to measure limb involvement (type of limb 
affected by [CONTACT_198029], one or both) and one to measure pain. The limb involvement item is scored 
either 1 if only the hands or feet were affected or 3 if both the hands and feet were affected. The 
pain item is scored on a three-point scale: 1, not painful; 2, moderately painful; 3, very painful. 
The total HFS-14 score is calculated by [CONTACT_198030], with the higher the 
score, the greater the QoL impairment.

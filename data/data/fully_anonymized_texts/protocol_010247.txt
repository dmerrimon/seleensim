[ADDRESS_31397] of the condition on the health of individuals and populations. (Criterion 1)  
A.1. Prevalence and Impact of Chronic Pain and Disparities in  Health Outcomes.   Chronic pain is pain that has 
outlasted the healing of an acute injury by [CONTACT_32205], continues or recurs frequently for three months, or is associated 
with a lesion that is not expected to resolve (1). Chronic pain  disrupts the lives of millions of people worldwide. M inority 
populations  in particular  experience greater  prevale nce of chronic pain and worse outcomes . Estimates of t he prevalence 
of chronic pain in the general U.S. population range  from 10 -40% in recent large surveys (2-7). Patients  often do not bring 
such pain  to the attention of physicians (8). Living with chronic pain is associated with  impairment of physical and 
psychological functioning (3, 9, 10), lost productivity (11), and lower socioeconomic status (7). Established treatment 
guidelines for chronic pain are often not followed  by [CONTACT_15098] (12-15). Under treatment is understood to be 
multifactorial , with causes that include limitations in the health care system, negative attitudes or lack of skil l in 
clinicians, and specific attributes of the patient (16). Patient -level attributes often involve racial and ethnic differences (12, 
14) as well as variation i n attitudes, beliefs, and concerns, such as medical mistrust, culturally different expressions of 
pain symptoms and related behavior s, and culturally -based beliefs regarding the nature of illness and healing.  
The prevalence and outcomes of chronic pain  differ across groups of patients . Access to care is one key component in 
these differences. Hispanics (70%) are significantly less likely to have consulted a primary care practitioner for pain 
compared with Caucasians (84%) or African Americans (85%). Less fr equent t reatment  seeking for pain is also associated 
with speaking Spanish, having limited education, and being unemployed. Hispanic ethnicity in particular appears to 
predict limited access. Others have examined the difference in treatment of pain in mino rity vs. non -minority populations 
and found similar disparities. For example, in a series of studies examining emergency room care for skeletal fractures 
Todd et al. found that Hispanics (17) and African -Americans (18) received appropriate analgesic treatment for fractures 
significantly less often than non -Hispanic whites. Others have reported similar rates of und er-treatment of minority 
populations with post -operative and cancer pain (19). 
 
A.2. Effectiveness of Acupuncture Therapy in Treatment of Chronic Pain.  Extensive  evidence now supports t he use 
of acupuncture therapy in the treatment of chronic pain conditions (20-27), particularly in three common causes of chronic 
pain: osteoarthritis (28-32) neck pain (33, 34) and low back pain (35-38). 
Osteoarthritis. Berman et al (28) examined the impact of acupuncture (23 sessions over 26 weeks) on pain and function in 
patients with osteoar thritis of the knee compared to sham acupuncture or education, and found significantly greater 
improvement at 26 weeks in both pain function and patient global assessment for acupuncture compared to the sham 
group. Witt et al (29) compared acupuncture (12 sessions over 8 weeks) vs. minimal acupuncture vs. no acup uncture in a 
randomized trial of patients with osteoarthritis of the knee ; subjects in the acupuncture group showed significant 
improvement in pain and function compared to both minimal acupuncture and no acupuncture. Scharf et al (39) found that 
true acupuncture and sham acupuncture (10 treatments over 6 weeks) were effective for osteoarthritis of the knee  
(successful for 53.1% in the true acupuncture group, 51.0% for sham, and 29.1% for standard care).  
Back and neck pain . A recent m eta-analysis on treatment of low back pain with acupuncture showed it was significantly 
more effective than sham treatment (40). Other recent randomized trials of acupuncture for low back pain have found both 
real and sham acupuncture were significantly more effective than waitlist control (41, 42); investigators have found similar 
positive results for neck pain (34). Most studies demonstrate improvements in both pain and disability. Because effective 
interventions for chronic pain have utilized 10 or m ore acupuncture treatments weekly or more frequently, we will offer 
12 treatments over 12 weeks.

3 A.3. Previous Experience: Effectiveness of acupuncture in an ethnically diverse and medically underserved 
primary care patient population.  Our previous NCCAM -funded acupuncture trial , ADDOPT (Acupuncture to Decrease 
Disparities in Outcomes of Pain Treatment) demonstrated the acceptability and effectiveness of acupuncture treatment for 
chronic pain in an ethnically diverse and medically underserved populat ion at high risk for health disparities.  The 
ADDOPT study, conducted in the urban primary care  health centers of the NYC RING practice -based research network 
(PBRN), completed data collection in November [ADDRESS_31398] now been published  (43,44 ). In this pragmatic 
effectiveness study, primary care physicians (PCPs) referred patients with chronic pain due to osteoarthritis, neck,  or back 
pain to on -site acupuncture provided in weekly sessions staffed by [CONTACT_32206]/faculty teams from the Acupuncture programs 
of Pacific College of Oriental Medicine and Swedish Institute (New 
York, NY). ADDOPT employed a quasi -experimental design, compa ring 
primary outcomes of pain, pain free days, and quality of life for patients 
during a pre -acupuncture phase (during which patients receiv ed usual 
care only)  to the period after acupuncture was provided. Repeated 
measures of pain (at two week intervals) were utilized to account for 
variability in patients’ pain experience.   
Participants.  Back pain was the most common enrolled diagnosis 
(n=135; 59.5%), followed by [CONTACT_32207] (n=37; 16.3%) ; many had 
multiple conditions (n=36, 15.9%). Participants were older (mean 54.3 
years); low income (40.6% had household incomes less than $20,000) 
and 59% were on Medicaid. Over half were Hispanic (53.6%) and 27.1% 
primar ily Spanish speaking. About a third (39.1%) were disabled. Table 
1 describes the striking baseline  characteristic s, which indicate 
substantial disability, poorly controlled pain, and poor overall functional 
status of referred patients.   
Feasibility.  ADDOPT demonstrated  the feasibility of integrating an 
acupuncture trial in the urban primary care setting, particularly regarding 1) success in referral (495 patients were referre d 
over 2 years, with a large percentage of PCPs at each practice making referrals); 2) recruitme nt (47% initiated treatment - 
the most common reason for not initiating was schedule conflict /wait list ); and 3) retention in care - of patients initiating 
treatment, 71% participated in >5 treatments [mean overall is 8.0 (SD 4.7)] (43).   
Outcomes.  Repeated measures ANOVAs indicate that mean pain severity (BPI) and physical health scores (SF12) 
changed significantly over time during the course of the study. Pain 
severity improved from  baseline (6.8 vs 5.7 at 12 wks and 5.8 at 24 
wks) as did physical well -being (31.8 vs 35.4 at 12 wks and 35.2 at 24 
wks). Using HLM methods, reduction in pain severity between baseline 
and treatment phase was significant (p <.001). Improvements in physica l 
well being were significant at [ADDRESS_31399] -baseline (p <.001). 
Almost one -third (32.4%) experienced a 30% or greater improvement in 
pain. (61) Although this is slightly below the 40 -50% response rate seen in 
many studies, given the constraints of the ADDOPT trial in delivering 
acupuncture using unpaid student acupuncturists —which could have easily 
led to decreased effectiveness –we feel this is strong evidence that a 
sizeable proportion will respond well to acupuncture. The ADDOPT trial confirm ed the feasibility of an acupuncture trial 
in this primary care population and indicates that many patients will experience what is typi[INVESTIGATOR_32158] a 
clinically meaningful reduction in pain ( >30%) with individual acupuncture.   
 
A.4. Evidence Gap . There is abundant evidence that individual acupuncture is effective for chronic pain and now 
evidence as well that it is feasible and effective specifica lly in an underserved and diverse population at risk for health

[ADDRESS_31401]  (including that most insurance plans do not cover acupuncture)  and access to individual 
acupuncture treatment pose major barrier s to widespread implementation in this  patient population. To reduce cost, 
increase supply, and meet patient demand, a novel approach of group acupuncture  is now being offered in  some settings  
across the U.S. In the group approach, [ADDRESS_31402] over a 60 -90 
minute period. In this approach patients are typi[INVESTIGATOR_32159] a large room in comfortable chairs while receiving 
treatment; the acupuncturist takes a history and then treats each patient in turn, leaving the needles in place while movin g 
on to treat the next person. Needles typi[INVESTIGATOR_32160] [ADDRESS_31403] the potential added benefit of social interaction during the treatment session. Group acupuncture  is 
now being offered in  many settings, but little or no evidence exists that acupuncture delivered in the group setting is as 
effective as individual acupuncture for chronic pain.  Between 2007 and 2010, membership in the Community 
Acupuncture Network tripled from 40 pa rticipating clinics in the U.S. to 120  (45).  Qualitative studies to date show that 
treatment in the group setting  is highly acceptable  to patients  (46,47) and that the group setting, community -based 
locations, and low cost of this model help eliminate some  of the barriers to access to acupuncture (48). In terms of 
effectiveness , a recent study of patients (n=144) with osteoarthritis of the knee found significant improvements in pain 
and function after one month with benefits maintained up to two years in pa tients continuing trea tment (49).  A current 
NIH-funded study is evaluating the effectiveness of group acupuncture for painful diabetic neuropathy in an underserved 
population in [LOCATION_004]  (50).  
 Controversy exists in the acupuncture and medical communit ies as to whether group acupuncture is as effective as 
individual treatment  (51). In group acupuncture, since patients are typi[INVESTIGATOR_32161], there is a greater emphasis on distal acupuncture points on the arms, legs , head and neck; some acupuncturists 
feel this decreases the effectiveness of the treatment. Because acupuncture therapy typi[INVESTIGATOR_32162], a question of decreased effectiveness with distal treatment only rema ins unresolved.  This 
important question needs to be addressed.  
We propose the “Acupuncture Approaches to Decrease Disparities in Outcomes of Pain Treatment - A Two 
Arm Comparative Effectiveness Trial” (AADDOPT -2) to close this gap in the evidence , specifically to answer the 
important question of whether acupuncture for chronic pain delivered in a group setting is as effective as 
individual acupuncture in an underserved and ethnically diverse patient population at high risk for health 
disparities.  
 
Part B. Significance  
B.1. Potential for the study to improve healthcare and outcomes . (Criterion 2)  
As discussed above, acupuncture is both safe and extremely effective in the management of chronic pain. 
Acupuncture is slowly being integrated into pain management in some  conv entional health care settings, yet c ost 
and reimbursement are major obstacle s to ac cess. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_32163] (we had 495 patients referred in ADDOPT 
and could only enroll half) , and the demonstrated effectiveness, acupuncture is still rarely available to our patient s. Group 
acupuncture can be offered for 17-33%  of the cost of individ ual acupuncture  (52, 53). Thus t he primary aim of 
AADDOPT -[ADDRESS_31404] of delivery in primary care and other pain 
management settings.  The experience in our second aim will allow us to disseminate a model for acupuncture delivery in 
a community setting for underserved pati ent populations that specifically incorporates the patient voice.  
B.2. Patient -centeredness . (Criterion 4)  
The symptom of chronic pain and its impact on function are  outcomes of critical importance to patients. Patients need

5 more information regarding the range of treatment options available to them for management of chronic pain 
and the potential benefits and harms of those treatments.  Safe and accessible treatment options for chronic pain are 
especially important  now given the growing awareness among both patients and health care practitioners of the 
risks of side effects, dependence and addiction associated with many of the medications used to treat chronic pain .  
The availability of affordable acupuncture in an underserved community could help address not only the 
problem of pain treatment in that community but the problem of addi ction and substance use as well. The main 
outcomes of this study (pain, pain -related disability, and quality of life) reflect outcomes of primary importance 
to individuals living with chronic pain.  
We will incorporate patients’ voices throughout this project, from design, through implementation, 
interpretation of findings, and dissemination. The first step in this ongoing process started  during the previous 
ADDOPT study. We carried out 37 in -depth interviews with ADDOPT participants. Although our analysis of 
this data is not yet published , this effort to understand patients’ experiences has provide d a wealth of 
information regarding such topi[INVESTIGATOR_32164], logistical challenges, the nature 
and importance of patients’ relationship with the acupuncture practitioners, and patients’ opi[INVESTIGATOR_32165] -being. To further obtain input in the design of this 
study, w e have recruited three former ADDOPT participants to serve as “Patient Partners”  for this study . These 
patients participated in a preliminary advisory group meeting that further informed our app roach, and will play 
a critical role throughout the study as Key Personnel on the project. Stakeholder engagement throughout the 
planned study is described in Section G.  
 
Part C. Study Design and Approac h 
Demonstrate the study's technical merit. (Criterion 3)    
C.1. Overview of Research Strategy . Our project, Acupuncture Approaches to 
Decrease Disparities in Outcomes of Pain Treatment: A Two Arm Comparative 
Effectiveness Study (AADDOPT -2), will be a random ized, comparative 
effectiveness trial evaluating acupuncture for treatment of chronic pain 
delivered either in individual or group visits in urban primary care health 
centers . After recruitment and baseline  survey to assess  pain and functional 
status , pati ents will be randomized to individual or  group treatment . 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_32208], to ensure equal 
representation of neck pain, back pain, and osteoarthritis in each treatment 
group . After randomization, participants will be  treated in weekly sessions for  
12 weeks . Patient -centered outcomes of pain and quality of life will be assessed 
at 6, 12 and 24 weeks.  Group and individual acupuncture sessions will be of 
similar duration and will be delivered by [CONTACT_32209]. Research associates gathering outcome data will be blinded to 
group assignment. We will carry out within -group and between group 
comparisons of  pain and function outcomes.  
 In a patient -centered process to better understand participants’ experience of the intervention, a subgroup of [ADDRESS_31405] with t his process; findings will then be reviewed by [CONTACT_32210] 1) ongoing intervention delivery in this trial, and 2) dissemination efforts for future acupuncture 
delivery.

primary care patients with chronic pain from an ethnically diverse, medically underserved population ; and

patient centeredness of the  intervention  and dissemination efforts.   
C.3. Setting . The AADDOPT -[ADDRESS_31406] in the health centers of the [LOCATION_001] City 
Research and Improvement  Networking Group 
(NYC RING), a practice -based research network 
dedicated to decreasing  health disparities through 
primary care research in the urban safety net 
setting. Participating practices  (listed in Table 2)  
are located in the Bronx, NY, a county comprised 
of a large proportion (85.5%) of ethnic minority 
residents of whom more than half (56.7%) are 
Hispanic. Nearly a third of the population lives below poverty level. These practices provide comprehensive primary care 
to patients  with a variety of insurance coverage; FQHC sites see patients regardless of insurance status. Each practice has 
a clinical champi[INVESTIGATOR_32166] -site acupuncture, and suitable sessions each week in which space is available. (See 
letter s of support from Jo n Swartz, MD  and Don Raum, MD,  Regional Medical Director s of Montefiore Medical Group ).  
C.[ADDRESS_31407] a qualifying 
diagnosis of chronic  (lasting 3 months or more)  joint pain related to a diagnosis of osteoarthritis, or chronic neck or back 
pain related to non-cancer diagnoses.  Participants  will reflect typi[INVESTIGATOR_32167], including many with multiple 
chronic diseases. To participate, they must be fluent in English or Spanish, able to provide home or cell phone numbers, 
and available for up to [ADDRESS_31408] brief educational sessions  for practitioners and staff in the participating health 
centers, modeled afte r the module utilized for ADDOPT, to briefly introduce the philosophy of Chinese medicine and 
acupuncture therapy, safety and adverse effects and recent clinical evidence for effectiveness of acupuncture in chronic 
pain. The session will feature an acupunc ture demonstration, since lack of personal experience with an “unconventional” 
modality can be a barrier to referral and utilization in practice.  
Recruitment.  All Primary Care Providers (PCPs) in each participating practice will be encouraged to refer appr opriate 
adult s (aged 21 and older) for acupuncture therapy.  Employing procedures that worked well in ADDOPT, recruitment will 
be initiated when PCPs make referrals to the study team. At the clinician’s discretion, acupuncture will be discussed as 
part of t reatment planning during patient visits. For patients who meet eligibility criteria, PCPs will complete a study 
specific referral form. PCPs will obtain permission for a member of the study  team to contact [CONTACT_102], and obtain at 
least two current phone  numbers to facilitate contact. Consent to participate in research will not be sought at this point. 
Clinicians will send referral forms to the practice’s referral coordinator (as they would any other request for specialty 
consultation). The S tudy Coordina tor will collect referrals, then contact [CONTACT_32211], describe the 
study, and explain study procedures, including randomization  (see Human Subjects for details of consent process).  
We plan to enroll 700 patients over a 25 month  year period, to allow us to reach our sample size target of 280 participants 
per arm assuming a 20% dropout rate.  
We are confident in our team’s ability to enroll the number of participants needed for this trial  for several reasons.  
First, in our ADDOPT trial we recruited 495 patients in 18 months , from only four sites and with much more limited 
scheduling flexibility because we were using student acupuncturists. The two primary reasons roughly half did not receive 
acupuncture were the limitations of our acupuncture delivery capacity  (which resulted in a long wait list)  and scheduling

[ADDRESS_31409]  three capacity -expanding strategies will enable us to enroll a much higher proportion of 
referred  patients : 1) staff acupuncturists rather th an students will del iver acupuncture; this improves  treatment time 
efficiency and therefore capacity ; 2) evening and weekend hours will be available at an expanded number of sites , which 
enhances scheduling flexibility and 3) half of our participants will receive acupuncture in groups.

Plan to ensure representativeness of participants.  Our approach involves recruiting directly from practices that serve 
the urban underserved. Participants are limited to those who already receiv e their primary care in the participating health 
centers (demographics provided in Table 2, pg 5 of the proposal). Our referral approach in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_32168] a 
sample of patients with a high level of disability, multiple chronic diseases, and low  SES reflecting the primary care 
population of interest. We are employing the same approach, including research staff who are bilingual in English and 
Spanish to ensure inclusion of primary Spanish speaking patients. We anticipate that using the same appro ach used in our 
first study will result in a similarly representative population in AADDOPT -2. To ensure this is the case, at three -month 
intervals we will carry out a systematic assessment of our study participants and our recruitment efforts to ensure th at the 
procedures we followed in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_32169] -[ADDRESS_31410] ices at our participating sites. If such deviations from the 
planned practices are detected, we will prepare and implement a process of remediation for the referring medical staff at 
the site(s) in question. Based on our experience in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_32170] a major problem with this issue.  
Plans to address population -unique issues for participant identification, recruitment, and retention . Our sample will 
include primarily individuals who have been historically underrepresented in health care research, including patients with 
multiple chronic diseases, low literacy, low SES, as well as racial and ethnic minority groups. As described above, many 
of the challenges of identifying such a population are minimized by [CONTACT_32212] e practices that 
serve this population, and offering the acupuncture interventions at the primary care practice. The task of identifying 
appropriate subjects will mainly reside with the medical and nursing staff at the community centers, who are already 
intimately involved in assessment and management of their patients’ chronic pain. In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we received almost 
[ADDRESS_31411] patients by 
[CONTACT_32213] -up and study retention. If we see specific patterns of loss to follow -up or problems in 
retention at certain sites, we will work with our stakeholders and with clinic staff  to identify and address the site -specific 
issues.

medicine. We will use a  pragmatic , real -world ap proach  that allow s for individualizing treatment from a pre -determined 
set of options (54), one to be used in the individual arm and one for the group arm. Acupuncturists will all use a common 
set of acupuncture points for either neck or back pain, and select from a set of additional optional points that address each  
individual’s condition . Two nationally recognized acupuncturis ts, [CONTACT_32242]  (Director of Acupuncture Services at Beth 
Israel)  and [CONTACT_32243] (Academic Dean and Research Director of Pacific College of Oriental Medicine, see 
biosketches), will develop the protocols for this trial  based on the current literature, on  our experience in the ADDOPT 
trial, and on their own extensive clinical experience . Two licensed acupuncturists with at least five years of practice 
experience will provide treatment once weekly for 12 weeks for each patient. We refer to our intervention as “acupuncture 
therapy” because the acupuncturists will be permitted to practice a range of different styles inclusive of both Traditional 
Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Classical Chinese Medicine. Patients will be evaluated based on their medical history, as  
well as on traditional Chinese Medicine physical examination including examination of the tongue (tongue diagnosis) and 
pulse (pulse diagnosis), and palpation of the channels . Based on this evaluation a diagnosis and treatment plan will be 
formulated. Individual s’ progress will be evaluated and treatment adjusted as necessary. Acupuncture therapy will consist 
of needling body points with option of application of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_32172]: use 
of heat lamps, moxibustion,  electrical stimulation of acupuncture points, needling auricular acupuncture points, adhesive 
application of ear seeds, and manual or instrument assisted stimulation of surface areas by [CONTACT_23302], massage (tui na) 
and/or Gua sha. All treatments will adher e to appropriate guidelines for safety and correct methodology (55). For needled 
points, treatment will consist of needle insertion and rotation to ‘de qi’ status (a sensory component felt by [CONTACT_102], 
perceived by [CONTACT_32214] ‘needle grasp’) (56). Once ‘de qi’ has been felt, needles may be left in place to rest for a 
period of 10 -30 minutes, or depending on the site, removed. The study coor dinator (SC) will coordinate scheduling and 
make reminder calls to decrease missed visits.  
Individual Treatment Arm . As in the ADDOPT trial, t reatment in AADDOPT -2 will be offered once weekly for  the 
individual acupuncture arm and delivered at the primary care health center. The average length of treatment will be 
approximately 45 minutes. We will take advantage of evening and Saturday hours where possible to enhance convenience 
for patients and exam room space availability.  
Group Treatment Arm . Participants randomized to the group arm will receive their acupuncture treatment simultaneously 
in a group of 6 -8 partic ipants.  Participants will be seated in comfortable chairs in a large room rather than in individual 
exam rooms. The length of time for treatment will be approximately 45 minutes, as in the individual arm, although the 
length of the entire group session will be longer (75 -90 minutes) to allow adequate time for everyone to be treated. Based 
on feedback from our Patient Partners regarding pa tient privacy, each participant in the group arm will meet for a brief 
discussion in a private space with the acupuncturist prior to starting treatment.  
Process and fidelity assessment:  All acupuncturists will undergo training  to become familiar with the study procedures, 
and for consistency in application of acupuncture and acupuncture therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (as described above), and in interpersonal 
approach. Regarding th is interpersonal dimension, which we seek to make as uniform as possible, this training will 
include video observation and feedback to standardize as much as possible the “non -specific” practitioner factors 
(empathy, communication style, etc), which might influence treatment outcomes. Acupuncturists will document 
treatments on standardized forms devel oped for the trial. To assess fidelity, on a monthly basis, [CONTACT_32242] will examine 
all documentation of treatments in the context of the study protocol options . We will videotape 3 -6 encounters (in 
acupuncture and attention control arms) for each acupunc turist and evaluate consistency in the interpersonal dimension. 
Feedback will be provided with retraining and reassessment when indicated.

9 C.6. Quantitative Data Collection and Management  (Aim 1) : An overview of t iming and approach of data c ollection is 
depi[INVESTIGATOR_28071] [ADDRESS_31413] ate of the art,  
web-based data collection system available through the Einstein Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR) 
Research Informatics Core (RIC). Employing tablet computers, study staff will enter data directly via this platform 
whether by [CONTACT_32215]’s health centers.  The initial research interview will take place after 
consent to participate in the trial has been obtained but before randomization , in most cases, within 1 -2 weeks of referral. 
Evening and weekend hours will facil itate reaching working adults. Data at 6, 12, and 24 weeks will be collected by  
[CONTACT_32216]  a research assistant (RA) who will be blind to study group assignment.  Participants will not receive an incentive 
to attend  acupuncture treatments, but will receive mo dest incentives to complete the research interviews (see the Human 
Subjects section for 
details).  
Data will be entered and 
managed using the 
customized, secure, web-
based platform, Research 
Electronic Data Capture, 
(REDCap).  The system 
will generate de -
identified study IDs and 
confirm consent before 
creating participant records. Automated measures of quality control such as ou t-of range and inconsistent data  checks will 
be implemented to ensure data integrity and version control features will provide an audit trail that will track all data 
changes. This system will be supported by [CONTACT_32217], and  will provide study staff with an automated 
screening, recruitment and tracking component to record all contacts with participants, implement a scheduling system, 
generate reminder emails and  highlight all outstanding or upcoming follow up visits. A Quality Assurance Protocol  will 
be developed and documented for each phase, to flag deviations  from protocol, highlight inconsistent or missing data and  
track data collection activities . 
REDCap  will generate status reports and basic descriptive analyses to spot anomalies in data ov er time. All reports will be 
reviewed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Fletcher, who will work directly with RIC staff to develop the study specific database, including tracking, 
reporting, and data checking functions. Reports will be reviewed at regular meetings of the Executive C ommittee.  
C.6.1. Primary Outcome Measures.  All instruments are established measures with good reliability ; all have been 
validated for use in Spanish speaking populations. We will assess pain, pain interference with function, health status and 
pain-related  disability at baseline, and then at 6, 12, and 24 weeks. Data may be collected from participants within a -4 
and +6 week time interval for the 24-week data collection.  Pain also will be assessed during four weekly telephone 
contacts during the four week run-in period prior to initiation of treatment.  
Brief Pain Inventory: Short Form (BPI ). The BPI (57) will serve as the primary outcome measure. It includes 4 pain 
scales, measuring “pain on average” during the past week, “pain at its worst” during the past week, “pain at its least” 
during the past week, and “pain right now”. The primary outcome variable will be defined as a 30% or greater 
improvement on the BPI [INVESTIGATOR_32173] 12. The  BPI [INVESTIGATOR_32174] a validated 7 -item scale 
measuring the extent to which pain interferes with function, including activity, mood, sleep, work and life enjoyment. For 
the weekly assessments, BPI [INVESTIGATOR_32175] “pain on  average” and “pain at its worst” will be used.  
C.6.2. Secondary Outcome Measures .  
PROMIS Quality of Life . The 10 -item global Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information Systems 
(PROMIS ) quality of life measure will be used as a secondary outcome measure. This scale is now being widely used to 
evaluate QOL and functional status outcomes in chronic pain as well as other conditions. It includes global ratings of the Table 3 :  Overview of Data Collection

of general health that cut across domains (59), ( http://www.nihpromis.org/software/assessmen tcenter ). 
Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC).  Post intervention, patients will complete a short validated measure of 
global impression of change. The PGIC is a single question 7 -point categorical scale. (58).  
Medication use . We will track use of medications (opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], non -steroidal anti -inflammatories [NSAIDS], and 
adjuvants) using two methods. Patients will be asked to report use of pain medications using a single question adapted 
from the Aberdeen Back Pain scale (“on the wo rst day in the past two weeks, how many painkilling tablets did you take”), 
assessed each time the BPI [INVESTIGATOR_32176] ( 60). In addition, we will extract prescriptions written and refilled directly 
from the electronic medical record (EMR) using Clinical Lo oking Glass, a user interface to query Montefiore’s electronic 
record that can be accessed for all participants with appropriate HIPAA consent.  
C.6.3 Methods to Ensure Unbiased and Systematic Data Collection  
Minimizing bias in data collection : We will kee p all post -randomization data collection blind to study assignment. The 
RA will be blind to study assignment and will be solely responsible for post -randomization data collection. (The SC will 
know study assignment). The RA and SC will be trained by [CONTACT_978] s to conduct the interviews in as neutral a manner as 
possible. We will observe at least 5 interviews by [CONTACT_32218]. Our RA and SC 
will be bilingual in Spanish and English which should eliminate any potential f or bias in data collection based on language 
issues. All data collection will be conducted as interviewer -directed, rather than self administered surveys, to facilitate 
involvement of patients with lower literacy.  
Systematic data collection : Working with our NIH -funded Institute for Clinical and Translation Research (ICTR) 
Informatics Core, we will develop a robust study management database that includes reminders and reporting to alert 
study staff that a participant is due for data collection. The team wi ll review reports that summarize data quality and 
missing data at weekly meetings and revise study procedures or provide additional training as needed.  
C.6.[ADDRESS_31414] data to document 
the reason(s).                         
C.6.[ADDRESS_31415] 
include:  1) primary survey data collected during run -in, at baseline and at follow -up; 2) interview material from patients 
participating in the qualit ative interviews exploring the patient experience of receiving acupuncture in either the individual 
or group setting; and 3) prescribed medication use, obtained from the participants’ electronic health record and self -report.  
We are employing validated pat ient-centered measures to assess the primary outcome of pain and secondary outcome of 
functional status. An additional secondary outcome, medication use, will be determined using a combination of self report 
and electronic health record (EHR). The design o f this study is a randomized  trial with an expected sample size of 350 
subjects per group. To ensure equal representation of patients with different sources of pain (neck pain, back pain and 
osteoarthritis) in both treatment arms, randomization will be str atified by [CONTACT_32219]. Given that a large number of 
subjects will be randomized to the two intervention arms of interest, we anticipate that any baseline patient characteristics  
that may be potential confounders will balance across the treatment grou ps. Baseline characteristics that will be evaluated

11 include level of disability, age, gender, marital status, socioeconomic status, and race/ethnicity among others. In the event  
that specific baseline variables are significantly different across groups by [CONTACT_3364], we will adjust for these factors in the 
analysis using regression approaches.  
C. 7 Quali tative Data Collection and Management  (Aim 2)  
Beginning in Year [ADDRESS_31416] qualitative interviews with a subset of participants in both arms (n=40) 
who will serve as a “Patient Feedback Panel”. These interviews will explore the patients’ experience of receiving 
acupuncture in both the group and the individual setting. Workin g together with our three Patient Partners, we will 
develop a guide for semi -structured interviews to be used in this process and will recruit consecutive patients from  those 
who are willing to be interviewed  until we reach our desired sample size (anticip ated at 20 per arm, depending on data 
saturation). The interview guide will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_32177]. Participants 
will be offered an additional $50 incentive for completing the qualitative interview. Our Pati ent Partners will undergo 
training in qualitative interviewing (led by [CONTACT_3252] -PI [INVESTIGATOR_124]. McKee, who has considerable experience teaching qualitative 
methods, including to staff of community -based organizations); the interviews will then be conducted by [CONTACT_32220]. Interviews will be conducted in either English or Spanish depending on patient 
preference, and can be done either in -person or by [CONTACT_648]. Interviews will be audio -taped and transcribed verbatim prior to 
analysis. During the transcription, patient names will be removed to protect privacy and on the transcripts patients will be 
identified only by [CONTACT_32221].  
 
C.8. Quantitative Data Analysis Plan (Aim 1 ) 
This study will evaluate whether group acupuncture is non-inferior  to individual acupuncture in reducing pain and 
improving function in patients with chronic pain from an ethnically diverse, medically underserved population. All data 
analyses will be performed according to the intent -to-treat approach and will be precede d by [CONTACT_32222], inconsistencies, and out -of-range values.   
C.8.1. Primary Outcome . The primary outcome will be response to treatment, as defined by a 30% or greater 
improvement on the BPI [INVESTIGATOR_32178] 12 weeks . The difference in response rates between the two 
acupuncture groups will be estimated alo ng with corresponding two -sided 95% confidence intervals. Non -inferiority of 
the group approach rela tive to the individual approach will be declared if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval 
for the true difference in response rates (individual therapy rate – group  therapy rate ) is less than δ, the margin of non -
inferiority  (defined to be δ = 10% ).   
Mean and median levels of other patient characteristics and outcomes measured at specific visits which are continuous 
variables, such as quality of life composite scores, pain  scores , and pain -free days , will be estimated and compared 
between treatmen t groups using the two -sample T -test or Wilcoxon rank sum test depending on the distribution of the 
data. The chi -square or Fisher’s exact test will be used to evaluate bivariate associations between categorical variables and 
treatment groups. General line ar mixed models (GLMM) will also be fit to the data to analyze the repeated measures of 
pain and other outcome variables obtained during follow -up. This is a flexible statistical procedure that can easily 
accommodate missing values, irregular visit schedul es, and within -subject correlation in the repeated measures. The 
model will include fixed effects for treatment arm ( group versus individual acupuncture ) and time, and a random subject 
effect to take into account the within -subject correlation between repe ated measurements.  Suitable transformations will 
be applied if data are non -normally distributed and an unstructured correlation matrix will be assumed for the within -
subject correlation. Primary analyses will not be adjusted for covariates. To account fo r potential confounders, the 
relevant covariates will be included in the GLMM model.  The Bonferroni approach will be used to adjust for the inflation 
in the Type I error rate due to the evaluation of multiple outcomes . 
C.8.2. Heterogeneity of Treatment Effects . Additional analyses will be conducted to evaluate whether the treatment 
effect varies by [CONTACT_32223] (neck, back, OA), baseline level of disability (2 levels)  and treatment compliance (3 levels). 
Initially, subgroups will be defined based on  the above factors and estimates of treatment effect will be obtained 
separately in each subgroup using the methods described above. These analyses will be viewed as exploratory since

PCORI Research Plan Template                                                                                                                                                
 
[ADDRESS_31417] varies by [CONTACT_32223] (neck, back, OA), baseline level of disability (2 levels) and treatment compliance (3 levels)  
for a total of [ADDRESS_31418] for the significance of any 
heterogeneous treatment effects across these factors by [CONTACT_32224]. Since sample sizes and power may 
be limited for these analyses, they will be viewed as exploratory; formal multiple testing procedures will not be applie d.  
C.8.4. Missing data.  In any clinical trial, some subjects will be lost to follow up or will miss study visits. Primary 
analysis will be based on available data at each time point. The advantage of the GLMM approach is that it can handle 
data which are missing at random and mea surement times which are not evenly spaced. However, when the missingness 
mechanism depends on unobserved information, i.e., non -ignorable, parameter estimates and resulting tests on hypotheses 
will be biased without further adjustment. Different approache s for handling missing data will be performed in this study. 
Data will be stratified according to their missing pattern (e.g., early termination, late termination, and follow -up 
completers) and then variables based on these groups will be used as model cov ariates. Additionally, multiple imputation 
will be applied if missing data rates are observed to differ across observed covariates. Regardless of the technique, 
characteristics of patients who are lost to follow -up will be compared to those that remain in the study to assess the degree 
of any selection bias, and sensitivity analyses will be performed to evaluate robustness of conclusions to the different 
missing data approaches.  
C.8.5. Sample size justification.  The power of this non -inferiority trial was evaluated based on the primary outcome of 
response status, defined as a 30% or greater improvement on the BPI [INVESTIGATOR_32178] 12 weeks.  In 
addition, we define the margin of non -inferiority to be a difference in response rates (individual  therapy  rate  – group 
therapy  rate) of δ = 10%.  With a sample size of [ADDRESS_31419] 80% power with a Type I 
error rate of 5% to conclude that group therapy is non -inferior to individual therapy under the alternative hypothes is that 
the true response rate in both groups is 35%. In this trial, we anticipate a slightly higher response rate than the 30% rate 
observed in the ADDOPT trial since we will be using experienced acupuncturists rather than students to administer the 
thera py. Moreover, the typi[INVESTIGATOR_32179] 40 -50% range ( 40). 
Assuming a drop -out rate of 20%, we will enroll approximately 3 50 patients per group ( 700 total).  
C.8.6.  Sensitivity Analyses.  Sensitiv ity analyses will be performed to evaluate whether the study results differ according 
to 1) varying assumptions about the correlation structure in the generalized linear mixed modeling approach (e.g. 
compound symmetry, auto -regressive, unstructured); 2) di fferent transformations for non -normally distributed data (e.g. 
rank transform, log transform); 3) different approaches to modeling time in the repeated measures analysis (linear, 
categorical, polynomial); 4) unadjusted versus covariate adjusted estimates of treatment effects; 5) intent -to-treat versus 
per-protocol analysis; and 6) complete case analysis versus multiple imputation for handling missing data.

13 These standards allow for consistency in reporting of acupuncture study interventions and for greater potential to allow 
future investigators to replicate a specific type of intervention approach.  
 
C.9. Qualitative Data Analysis Plan (Aim 2).  We believe it is critical to have the patient voice represented in analyzing 
the data on patient experience of acupuncture. Our Patient P artners will participate as members of the qualitative analysis 
team. The level at which each of our partners engages will vary based on their educational background, their level of 
commitment, and their interest in this part of the project. Analysis of in terview data will begin with development of a 
simple descriptive coding scheme, using standard iterative approaches (61). The qualitative team (Kligler, McKee, the 
Study Coordinator , Patient Partners ) will read through a selection of interviews and identify potential coding categories. 
These will be discussed in the group and then added to the code list and re -applied to new sub -sets of data. Coding 
differences are reconciled through discussion; the revised coding scheme will then be applied using standard it erative 
procedures. Once the coding scheme is determined to be sufficiently comprehensive and specific, it will be applied to the 
entire data set. Coded data will be uploaded into NVIVOtm, a qualitative data analysis program that facilitates the rapid 
organization and retrieval of qualitative data. In a second step, we will examine themes in the interviews across the 
sample, and characterize participants’ attitudes, and experiences regarding their experiences of acupuncture in the study. 
In a third confirma tory step, we will present our summary of themes describing the experience of acupuncture back to a 
subset of our Patient Feedback Panel to see if we have adequately captured our participants’ voices. Following this step, a 
summary of the findings from thi s process will be provided to the study acupuncture team and Stakeholders by [CONTACT_32225] a way that reflects the feedback from the participants.  
 
Part D. Project Milestones and Timeline  
To assure timely completion of our objectives , we have assembled an experienced multidisciplinary team and will 
engage a diverse group of stakeholders including patients, primary care physicians, acupuncture therapy 
providers, health care insurance payors and  methodologists throughout the project. In order to effectively manage 
these activities, we will organize the following groups : 1) The Executive Committee (Drs. McKee and Kligler as 
co-PIs, [CONTACT_32244], [CONTACT_32245] cher, and the Study Coordinator) who will mee t weekly to oversee all aspects of study 
implementation ; 2) The A ADDOPT -[ADDRESS_31421] Team  (including  the Executive Committee, plus the Study 
Coordinator , the acupun cturists, [CONTACT_32243], [CONTACT_32246], and the Patient Partners ), which  will meet monthly 
throughout the study to provide interdisciplinary input on all aspects of the study design, implementation and 
analysis ; and 3) the Stakeholder Advisory Panel, which will include all stakeholders and the Executive 
Committee , and will meet quarterly.

15 Research Environment.  The [LOCATION_001] City Research, Improvement and 
Networking Group (NYC RING) is a practice -based research network of 
practices that provid e comprehensive primary care to large numbers of urban 
minority patients. NYC  RING’s mission is to conduct high quality urban 
primary care research with the goal of improving services and outcomes for 
disadvantaged populations. Dr. McKee (co -PI [INVESTIGATOR_32180] ) is the 
director of NYC RING. The network consists of 35 communi ty-based 
primary care practices affiliated with the Albert Einstein College of Medicine 
in the Bronx, lower Westchester County and Manhattan. NYC RING is one 
of only a few PBRNs in the US focused exclusively on the urban 
underserved.  The network is founded  on the premise that actively involving 
primary care providers in all phases of the research process will enhance the 
relevance of the questions, improve implementation of protocols,  and 
significantly improve the translation of results into practice. A ful l time 
network  coordinator ([CONTACT_32247]) provides support for PBRN initiatives, 
and feedback of research results to practices. An aggregate profile of the 
NYC RING practices confirms that the patient population served reflects the 
communities in which the offices are located. A bout half of patients are 
Hispanic, about a third are Black, and Whites and Other comprise relatively 
equal proportions. Overall, 90% of patients are minorities. These practices 
also have substantial proportions of uninsured patients.  Eight  sites are 
federally -funded community health centers.  
Research Team . The leadership team for this project has extensive 
experience collaborating over the past five years on the ADDOPT study as well as a number of other educational and 
research effor ts. Key team members are listed below.  
Co-Principal Investigator, M. Diane McKee, MD, MS . is Associate Professor of Family and Social Medicine, Co -
Director of the Department of Family and Social Medicine Division of Research and the Director of the NYC RIN G 
practice -based research network. Dr. McKee is an experienced health services researcher who has led multiple primary 
care interventions. Most recently, she was PI [INVESTIGATOR_32181], on which she worked closely with the other members 
of the team propose d for AADDOPT -2. As the Einstein -based co -PI, Dr. McKee will have primary responsibility for 
administrative and financial oversight and management of the project. Dr. McKee and [CONTACT_32248] will share responsibility 
for hiring, training, and supervising the  Study Coordinator and Research Assistant, and for project implementation, report 
writing, evaluation and analysis. Dr. McKee  will lead weekly Executive Team meetings and monthly meetings with the 
entire Project Team with [CONTACT_32248]. She will also share with [CONTACT_32248] responsibility for ensuring the ongoing 
involvement of the stakeholder panel in feedback and decision -making regarding the project. Dr. McKee will contribute

[ADDRESS_31428] an 
Plan to engage patients and stakeholders meaningfully in the various phases of the proposed research. (Criterion 5) 
G.1. Overview of Patient and Stakeholder Involvement .  We are proposing three levels at which patients and other 
stakeholders will be actively involved with us in carrying out the A ADDOPT -[ADDRESS_31429] is a group of three 
“Patient Partners”  who will play an integral role on the investigator team  (see biosketches for details).  The role of these 
Patient Partners is described in deta il below. The second is a larger group of 40 patients (“Patient Feedback Group”)  
enrolled in the study during Year 1, who will choose to participate in our qualitative evaluation of the acupuncture 
intervention, giving feedback on the patient experience wh ich will then be incorporated into the intervention going 
forward. The third is our Stakeholder Advisory Panel,  which includes our Patient Partners but also several other 
members representing stakeholder interests relevant to our project. This larger panel  will meet once in person at the start 
of the project and then quarterly by [CONTACT_32227]. The specific involvement, roles and responsibilities of each of 
these groups are outlined below.  
 
G.2. Stakeholder Involvement in Formulating the Research Q uestions and Study Design . We are very fortunate in 
that our engagement with patients  in our community  on the issue of acupuncture for pain began almost five years ago with 
the launch of the ADDOPT study, a rare example of NIH -funded community -based resear ch in that the funder  required 
that the research take place in a PBRN. As part of the ADDOPT study, we conducted in -depth qualitative interviews with 
37 patients from our four participating health centers. Interviews were conducted in both English and Span ish and focused 
on understanding patients’ experience of acupuncture treatment as well as their feelings about facilitators and obstacles to 
that treatment. A strong patient consensus emerged from that data that our patients want ongoing access to acupunct ure 
treatment for their pain but that barriers of access and payment at this point made that impossible. From this patient voice 
arose the idea to try to examine a model of acupuncture delivery that could be more sustainable in our treatment 
environment, a nd the specific research question of whether group acupuncture would be as effective and acceptable to 
patients as our individual model in ADDOPT.  
 Our research question and study design have also been informed by [CONTACT_32228]: acupu ncture 
practitioners  and educators , as represented by [CONTACT_6283]. Nielsen and Anderson on the study team. This group of stakeholders 
will ultimately be deeply involved if the model of group acupuncture for underserved communities proves to be an 
effective option.  Drs. Nielsen and Anderson have collaborated in developi[INVESTIGATOR_32185], and are specifically 
responsible for the description of the acupuncture interventions and how they will be delivered.  
 
G.3. Role/Involvement of Patient Partners  
Formulating the Study  Design.  We recruited three patient advisors (see letters of support ) who participated in the 
ADDOPT study to help us create the intervention for AADDOPT -2, and identify our goals and outcomes . This group met 
and reviewed our study proposal prior to submis sion, and contributed several substantive changes to our strategy for 
delivering the group intervention. These three Patient  Partners  will continue to play key role s throughout the project, 
serving on our Steering Committee and fully in decision -making as we proceed. They will also be compensated 
financially as Key Personnel  for their assistance.  
Participating in and Monitoring the Conduct of the Project.  Our Patient Partners will participate in project team monthly 
calls from the inception to the end of th e study period. This regular contact [CONTACT_32229]. Our Patient Partners will participate in the quarterly Stakeholder 
Advisory Panel meetings throughout the stu dy. In addition to these regular in person and phone meetings, our Patient 
Partners will be involved in numerous aspects of the process as the study evolves, many of which will take place outside 
of these regular calls. These roles will span planning the f inal details of the intervention, recruitment and data collection, 
and evaluation activities, as well as input into Stakeholder Advisory Panel meeting agendas.  
  
 
 
McKee, M. Diane; Kligler, Benjamin E.  
 
  
PCORI Research Plan Template                                                                                                                                                
 
[ADDRESS_31430] , Patient Partners will work w ith our acupuncture team (Drs. Anderson and 
Nielsen) to develop details of the group acupuncture experience, such as how the intervention will be described to 
participants, how the rooms will be set up for group treatment to address modesty issues, and how  to facilitate 
comfortable interaction between participants in the group arm. Patients will also share their experiences in the 
ADDOPT study with the acupuncture team to help inform study treatment protocol development, and then , at month 
three, participat e in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] “group treatment” at one health center to generate additional feedback for the team.  The 
present proposal already incorporates feedback from our Patient Partners on the issue of patient privacy based on our 
work with them prior to submission. Also, based on their input, we are opting for mixed -gender rather than single -
gender groups, as they felt there was no need to offer single gender groups despi[INVESTIGATOR_32186].  
2. Patient Partners will assist with developi[INVESTIGATOR_32187] (both English and Spanish versions).  
3. Patients will work with Drs. McKee and Kligler to develop the interview guide for the qualitative c omponent, helpi[INVESTIGATOR_32188].  
Recruitment and Data Collection . 
1. Patient Partners will complete  Human Subjects Training during the first three months of the project so as to be able to 
participate fully in all study -related activities.  
2. They will be involved in developi[INVESTIGATOR_32189].  
3. Patient Partners will assist in recruiting for the study from their own communities connected with the health centers 
and through other networks.  
4. Interested Patient Partners will be trained in the qualitative interviewing process and will carry out interv iews with 
study participants regarding their experience of acupuncture.  
Data Analysis . 
1. In the latter half of Year 1, interested Patient Partners  will be offered a basic training in evaluating qualitative data and 
will then participate with Drs. McKee and Kligler in discussing results and extracting themes describing the study 
participants’ experience.  
2. Once these themes have been described and the qualitative team has had the opportunity to evaluate the material, they 
will discuss and comment on the conclusions drawn regarding the material.  
3. In an engaged Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) model, patient partners will participate in developi[INVESTIGATOR_32190].  
Evaluation Activities . 
 The monthly phone calls with the project team will provide an opportunity for Drs. McKee and Kligler to “check -in” 
regularly with  the Patient Partners to be sure that they are satisfied with their level of involvement in the study and that 
they feel their involvement is making an important contribution to the research. The project leaders will use this regular 
feedback to adjust the  engagement as needed to ensure a real and meaningful partnership . In a similar process, other 
research team members will be invited on a regular basis to give feedback to the entire team regarding the patient 
involvement. To help ensure and promote open a nd honest communication even if there are disagreements, we will invite 
an outside facilitator to join the project team calls every third month to help with discussion of any sensitive or difficult  
issues that are confronting the project team.  
 
G.4. Role/I nvolvement of Patient Feedback Group  
 In addition to the Patient Partners discussed above, we will engage a larger group of patients from our community who 
are actively participating in the study to give us feedback that will  help us deliver the study intervention in the most 
patient -centered fashion possible. Twenty  patients will be recruited from each arm of the study during Year 1 to be 
interviewed about their experience. These interviews will be conducted both by [CONTACT_32230], M. Diane; Kligler, Benjamin E.  
 
  
PCORI Research Plan Template                                                                                                                                                
 
19 Coordinator, depending on availability, in either English or Spanish as needed. Participants in this Patient Feedback 
Group will receive an additional honorarium of $50 for their participation in this 30 -60 minute interview.  
 After the study team, including the Patient Partners, has reviewed and summarized the qualitative material, the 
members of the Patient Feedback Group will be asked to review a summary of the team ’s conclusions to check for 
accuracy and to be sure that th e team is making the correct recommendations regarding how the intervention should be 
adjusted. As many of the members of the feedback group as are available will be invited to participate in a focus group to 
review the teams summary and recommendations; a  Spanish translator will be present at this focus group and patients 
participating will receive an additional $50 honorarium for that participation.  
 Following this “confirmation” step, the Patient Partners and any of the feedback group who are interested in 
participating will meet with the study acupuncturists and the project leaders to discuss the feedback results and what 
specific changes should be made based on the patients’ experience. As an example, there is some suggestion from the 
literature that sa me-sex groups may be more acceptable to patients than mixed groups; we will specifically explore this 
question with patients , along with other issues that may influence their experience.  
 
G.5. Role/Involvement of Stakeholder Advisory Panel .  
The stakeholder panel is meant to represent the interests of patients as well as those of other communities who may be 
interested in the outcomes of this project.  The panel will meet once in person at the start of the project and then every 
three months by [CONTACT_32231]. Stakeholders ’ 
specific roles on the project will 
vary depending on their 
backgrounds; some will be 
involved more with intervention  
development , and others with 
dissemination. Although t his is 
not all -inclusive, we have chosen 
to have the following groups 
represented on our stakeholder 
panel (number of members in 
parentheses, with a full list 
provided in Table 5): 1) patients 
from our community, as 
described in our “Patient 
Partners” role  (3), 2) patients 
from the larger U.S. community, as represented by [CONTACT_32232] (1) , 3) the acupuncture community at 
large, and specifically acupuncturists currently practicing in the group setting (2) , 4) the interdisciplinary pain 
treatment c ommunity, at the intersection of conventional and CAM approaches, represented by [CONTACT_32233] (1) and the Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine (1) , 5) 
payors/insurers (1) , and 6) the primary care communi ty (1) . 
G.5.1. Stakeholder Role in Planning Dissemination of the Study’s Results . Stakeholders will have various roles in 
dissemination of the study results depending on the community they represent. Patient Partners will be involved in 
outreach to the local community both through the health centers and through their other community connections to make 
other patients in the community with chronic pain aware of the study findi ngs and potential benefits of acupuncture. 
Patient Partners will also be invited to co -author articles describing the study findings for publication both in scholarly 
journals and in local press outlets. Stakeholder partners from national groups (AAPM, CAH CIM) will help with Table 5. Stake holder Advisory Panel

[ADDRESS_31431] in concentric circles involving our stakeholder groups . 
1. Dissemination/Implementation in our local community : Patient Partners will be involved in outreach to the local 
community both through the health centers and through their other community connections to make other patients in the 
community with chronic pain aware of the potential benefits of acupuncture. P atient Partners will also be invited to co -
author articles describing the study findings for publication in local press outlets. We also have a commitment from our 
department and from our medical group to explore the possib ility of  ongoing delivery of grou p acupuncture in our 
network if the treatment proves to be effective. The active implementation of individual acupuncture services in the NYC -
RING clinics has been difficult due to cost issues, and our administration has expressed an interest in exploring group 
acupuncture further as a strategy to increase access.  
2. Dissemination in the larger patient community: Through our stakeholder representative from the national patient 
advocacy perspective,  we will pursue dissemination of our results to the communit y of pain patients across the country. 
This will be done through newsletters, web -site postings, and other meetings. Rapid dissemination to the patient advocacy 
network nationally will hopefully lead to pressure from patients on health systems and payors t o provide group 
acupuncture in their communities , should it prove an effective approach.  
3. Dissemination in the larger acupuncture community: Through [CONTACT_32250], a nationally active member  in the 
accreditation of acupuncture colleges, and through Dr. A nderson, the curren t Academic Dean at the largest acupuncture 
training program in the country (PCOM), we have excellent avenues  for dissemination and implementation of our study 
findings in the larger acupuncture community. For example, [CONTACT_32243] is com mitted to developi[INVESTIGATOR_32191]. The qualitative input from patients and lessons learned about implement ation of  acupuncture can 
also be easily translated into the treatment settings at PCOM and other training institu tions . 
4. Dissemination in the national pain treatment community : Stakeholder partners from national groups (AAPM, 
CAHCIM) will help with disse mination of the findings to their membership through newsletters, website postings, and 
presentations at meetings. The Clinical Working Group of CAHCIM , of which [CONTACT_32251] is former Chair, holds monthly 
webinars on clinical innovations attended by [CONTACT_32234]; this would be an ideal venue for 
dissemination of study results and discussion of strategies for implementation in other settings. The AAPM recently 
published  a strong statement  regarding the need for more education and clin ical options for physicians in pain treatment 
and, thus, is primed to help disseminate the results of this project , as well as part of their training effort.  
5. Dissemination in the research community: [CONTACT_32248] is a member of the Executive Committee of BraveNet, a 
14-center practice -based research network. All of the centers in this network offer acupuncture. If the group acupuncture 
intervention is effective, many of the BraveNet centers will be very open to follow -up studies further defining how and fo r 
whom this intervention can be helpful. Our involvement with BraveNet provides an open avenue to a group of 
experienced researchers ready and willing to replicate and further elaborate on our approach in this project.  We will , of 
course , also submit our findings for presentation at relevant meetings in the pain medicine, acupuncture, and integrative 
medicine communities, and publish our findings in the relevant journals. Finally, we will provide the outcomes data for 
peer review and then post it as a shar ed resource. Upon acceptance, we will post the data library and data set (HIPPA 
compliant for patient protection) to peer reviewed journals and include links to social media and our website.

[ADDRESS_31432] from the fee -for-service model and towards the Accountable Care Organization (ACO) model will work in our 
favor. If group acupuncture proves to be effective, an ACO should be quite able and willing to offer this service to 
patients as a low -cost strategy for pain management, especially as it can potentially reduce costs in other areas. Since the 
ACO model is concerned with overall cost -containment and quality of care, rather  than fees for specific services, it would 
seem that the group acupuncture approach could be very attractive to payors. Second, as mentioned above, Drs. Nielsen 
and Kligler have been working over the past year with the Joint Commission on the Accreditation  of Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_32192] (JCAHO) on a classification of its directives on non -pharmacological options for pain treatment. It is quite 
clear --partially in response to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_32193] -prescribing of addictive narcotic medications for pain -- that JCAHO is  
moving toward a higher -level expectation that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_32194] -pharmacological options for pain treatment in 
the future. In fact, acupuncture is now specifically mentioned in the revised standards as one of these options. This 
movement on the pa rt of the major hospi[INVESTIGATOR_32195] U.S. is certain to create additional pressure 
on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_32196]. Here again, group acupuncture, if shown to be effective, 
will be a very attractive o ption from a cost perspective. Thus, although there will be barriers to implementation, we are 
optimistic that there are also significant forces at play which will allow us to overcome those barriers easily.

population; primary and secondary hypotheses tested; sources and methods of measuring exposures, 
outcomes, and all covariates used in analyses, including data definitions, coding instructions, and the 
analysis plan. The IRB -approved protocol, along with the first 12 -month progress report, will be mad e 
available within three months of the end of the each funding period.  Descriptions of our study datasets, 
including code books, meta -data related to the datasets, and documented programming code used for 
creating the final study population, for creating variables, and for conducting all outcomes analyses will be 
provided within three months of the end of the final funding year. We agree to PCORI’s right to share these 
materials with appropriate researchers, in consultation with the principal investigators  of the study, Dr. M. 
Diane McKee and [CONTACT_32252].  
  
B.  Describe how you will make a complete, cleaned, de -identified  copy of the final dataset used in conducting 
the final analyses available within nine months of the end of the final year of funding, or your data sharing 
plan, including the method by [CONTACT_32235] u will make this dataset available, if requested.  
The Research Informatics Core of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Institute for Clinical and 
Translational Research (ICTR) will store and secure our data. A copy of the complete, cleaned, de -identif ied 
final data set, code book, and the accompanying analytic methods will be available within nine months of 
the end of the final year of funding, or earlier by [CONTACT_32236], to PCORI and other relevant parties. Data may be 
shared electronically or via hard -data file transfer, and will be provided in the form of raw data excel 
spreadsheets for quantitative data, and original transcriptions for qualitative data obtained through 
interviews and focus groups.  SPSS or equivalent syntax from the associated analyses c an be made available 
as well.   
 
C. Propose a budget to cover costs of your data sharing plan, if requested.   
The budget for data sharing would depend on what data sharing entails. For our own proactive efforts to share 
data, no budget is requested . We also considered costs involved if we are approached by [CONTACT_32237]. If an investigator wants to work peripherally with us to reanalyze our data, 
costs would be similar to routine consulting ($500/hr for aca demic collaborator; $1500/hr for pharmaceutical). If 
the collaboration is more intensive, requiring on -going involvement from Drs. McKee, Kligler, or Kim,  or other 
academic team members, it would likely involve % FTE of academic salary. If data sharing inv olves further hands 
on data - reduction or analysis on our end, additional staff time would need to be included. We would also 
welcome outside junior faculty, post -docs, and other students interested in conducting thesis research or other 
projects using the se data. There would be no charge for trainee and student projects, as long as one of the study 
investigators is able to serve as a (co -)mentor or committee member.

1.c. Potential Risks  
This study presents minor risks to participants. The primary risks are: 1) possible discomfort discussing topi[INVESTIGATOR_32197] ; 2) breach of confidentiality of health information; 3) discomfort or bruising from acupuncture ; 4) 
transient increase in pain during or after acupuncture; and 5) fear that refusal to participate in any part of the study might 
jeopardiz e their medical treatment at the health center. Special consideration and safeguards are integrated into the study 
methodology that we believe effectively limit these risks.  These procedures are described below . 
 
2. Adequacy of Protection Against Risks  
2.a. Recruitment and Informed Consent  
Procedures for recruitment, informed consent, and participant incentives are described below. Patients will be informed of 
their right to participate or discontinue participation at any time without jeopardizing the me dical treatment they receive or 
any treatment they might request in the future. Incentives have been chosen based on prior experience demonstrating that 
the amounts are well received, and generous enough to demonstrate the teams’ appreciation but not enoug h to be coercive.  
 
Recruitment.  All Primary Care Providers (PCPs) in each participating practice will be encouraged to refer appropriate 
adult (aged 21 and older) patients for acupuncture therapy. At the clinician’s discretion, acupuncture will be discuss ed as 
part of treatment planning during patient visits. For patients who meet eligibility criteria, PCPs will complete a study 
specific referral form. PCPs will obtain permission for a member of the study team to contact [CONTACT_102], and obtain at 
least tw o current phone numbers to facilitate contact. Consent to participate in research will not be sought at this point. 
Clinicians will send referral forms to the practice’s referral coordinator (as would any other request for specialty 
consultation). The Stud y Coordinator will collect referrals, then contact [CONTACT_32211], describe the 
study, and explain study procedures, including randomization. A subgroup of 20 patients from the each arm will be 
recruited after 24- week outcome data  is collected  to participate in qualitative interviews, and will sign a separate consent 
form for that process.  After contact[CONTACT_32238].  
 
Informed Consent.  In a private location at the  health center , study procedures will be explained in detail (in English or 
Spanish as preferred by [CONTACT_102]). Patients will be given opportunities to ask questions at any time during the 
enrollment and study, and informed that they can decline to participate or drop out of the study at any time. Patient will be  
asked to provide signed informed con sent.  
 
Incentives . Participants will not receive an incentive to attend acupuncture treatments, but will receive modest incentives 
to complete the research interviews. These incentives will be $5 for each of the baseline pain measurements, $25 for the 
pre-intervention baseline data collection, $10 for the 6 -week follow -up assessment, $25 dollars for the 12 -week 
assessment, and $30 for the 24 -week assessment.  Participants will be offered an additional $[ADDRESS_31437] follow -up (i.e., phone numbers) or to link data 
to subjects . No identifying information will be disclosed in reports, p ublications, or presentations. Patient interviews will 
be conducted in venues that allow the utmost privacy. Participants will be informed that they may refuse to talk about 
sensitive issues that may be upsetting to them, and that they can skip questions w henever they choose, or withdraw their 
participation in the study at any time.  
All study personnel will complete required training in ethical procedures for the conduct of research .

Data Protection  
All electronic data (including all databases) will be protected using File Warden or equivalent encryption software. 
Electronic data will be anonymized by [CONTACT_32239]. Sensitive data can only be accessed via the 
encryption code , (the “key”) which is stored in a locked cabinet accessible only to the PIs and [CONTACT_32253].  File Warden 
meets all HIPAA standards regarding privacy of health information. All electronic data will be stored on password 
protected PCs in the Division of Re search. The information from the study will be used only in scientific papers and 
reports that will not contain individual names or identifying information.  
 
HIPAA Compliance  
Procedures described are in compliance with HIPAA requirements for maintaining t he privacy and security of patient 
health information. The investigators have extensive experience conducting HIPAA -concordant research and are regularly 
trained in the most current HIPAA regulations and procedures.  
 
Potential Benefits of the Proposed Rese arch to the Subjects and Others  
Subjects may experience the altruistic benefit of participating in a study that contributes to better health care services fo r 
patients with chronic pain. Subjects may experience an improvement in their pain and quality of l ife as a consequence of 
acupuncture treatment. If the study is positive, it may help improve access to acupuncture treatment for patients with pain 
by [CONTACT_1541] a strategy for delivering this treatment at a lower cost.  
 
Importance of the Knowledge to be Ga ined 
The new knowledge generated by [CONTACT_32240].  While existing data from clinical trials suggests the 
efficacy of acupuncture for a variety of conditions, low income and minority patients rarely have access to complementary 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. We hope to demonstrate the effectiveness of a new strategy to delive r acupuncture in the urban health center 
setting, and to further demonstrate that patient outcomes are improved.  
 
Data Safety and Monitoring Plan   
Serious adverse events are very unlikely given the known safety of acupuncture. Nevertheless we will track serious 
adverse events (deaths, illnesses leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) and more likely given the nature of the intervention, minor 
adverse events asso ciated with acupuncture treatment occurring in the study participants. We will review these totals 
monthly.  We anticipate that only zero, one, or two serious events will occur during the course of this small study. The 
number of minor adverse events may b e slightly higher. [CONTACT_32254] (Professor of Epi[INVESTIGATOR_32198] ) has agreed to be the Data Safety Monitor for the study. All such events will be reported to him and to 
the Albert Einstein College of Medicine’s Committee on Clinical Investigations (IRB). Should the numbers be 
unexpectedly high, the investigators will convene to discuss the nature of these events, and their distribution and decide 
whether the study should continue.

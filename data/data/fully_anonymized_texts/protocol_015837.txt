 2.1 Objectives:  
This prospective, randomized,  non-blinded,  crossover  controlled clinical trial will enroll 
subjects with a BMI ≥ 35 who are undergoing elective  surgical procedures . Subjects will 
be randomized to receive mask ventilation after general induction of anesthesia in either 
a neutral head position (practice standard position) or a head rotation position (45 
degree angle) to determine : 
 
Primary Endpoint:  
1. Maximal and average  expi[INVESTIGATOR_289939] v olume during mask ventilation  
 
Secondary Endpoints:  
1. Maximal and average  inspi[INVESTIGATOR_289940]  
2. Maximal and average end -tidal CO 2 (ETCO 2) during mask ventilation  
3. Maximal and ave rage airway flow L/min  during mask ventilation  
4. Lowest and delta O2 saturation drop on SpO [ADDRESS_353636] and delta O 2 saturation drop on SpO 2 during intubation  
 
2.2 Clinical Hypotheses:  
Primary Hypothesis:  
We hypothesize  that a 45 degree head rotation during mask ventilation  will: 
1. Increase the efficacy of mask ventilation  measured by [CONTACT_289943] v olumes  
 
Exploratory  Hypotheses : 
We hypothesize that a 45 degree head rotation during mask ventilation  will: 
1. Decrease  upper airway obstruction measured by [CONTACT_289944]  
2. Improve  oxygenation measured by [CONTACT_7535] 2 during  mask ventilation  
3. Improve oxygenation measured by [CONTACT_7535] 2 during intubation

 3.1 Background  & Rationale : 
Mask ventilation is a foundation of airway management after the initial induction of 
anesthesia.  It allows for adequate oxygenation of the patient to  buy enough time for 
intubation , during which the patient is not ventilated.   However, in some patients mask 
ventilation may be difficult – older than 55  years , heavier ( BMI > 26 kg/m2), with no  
teeth, having a beard  or sleep apnea .1,2,3  Inadequate ventilation, if  not corrected, can 
result in decreasing oxygen saturation to dangerous levels – which could lead to 
devastating complications.  As a result,  the efficacy of mask ventilation is of critical 
importance to patient safety  after the induction of anesthesia .  
 
A recent study proposed that mask ventilation could be improved simply by [CONTACT_289945] a 
patient’s head.   The study showed  that rotating a patient’s head to a 45 degree angle 
significantly improved mask ventilation when compared with the he ad placed in a neutral 
position.4   However, this study was done i n patients with a BMI less than  35.  As such , 
the effects of head rotation on the efficacy of mask ventilation has not been studied in 
patients with a BMI of 35  and greater . 
 
Obesity (BMI ≥ 30  kg/m2) affects almost 40% of US adults  and is one of the most 
prevalent health concerns in our society.[ADDRESS_353637] 
patency, and decreased lung volumes such as functional residual capacity (FRC) .[ADDRESS_353638] to improve the efficacy of mask ventilation  for patients 
with a BMI of 35 and above .4 
 
4.1 Study Design : 
This will be a prospective,  randomized,  crossover , non-blinded , controlled clinical trial 
performed at a single academic hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].

 4.2 Study Design : 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.3 Study Procedures:

requiring general anesthesia  with intubation of the trachea .   
 
II. Inclusion Criteria : 
a. Age ≥ 18 years  
b. ASA I -III 
c. BMI ≥ 35  kg/m2

 IV. Randomization: On the day of surgery,  before the induction of anesthesia  subject s 
will be randomized into either Group A or Group B .  Randomization will be 
accomplished by [CONTACT_289946] . The two groups will 
be stratified so that obe se subject s with a BMI ≥ 35 and ≤ 44 and those with a 
BMI ≥ 45  are equa lly distributed between both groups. Groups will be additionally 
stratified by [CONTACT_289947] (OSA).  
 
V. Blinding: Group assignment will not be known by [CONTACT_289948]. No blinding will occur during the clinical portion of the study or during  
data analysis.  
 
VI. Preoperative Data Collection and Measurements : Before the subject is taken into the 
operating ro om, we will record and measure a ge, BMI, sex, ASA status, preop 
diagnoses,  OSA,  procedure being done, Mal lampati  score , mouth opening, thyro -
mental distance, neck circumference, neck range of motion, lack of teeth , 
presence of beard,  and history of snoring .  
 
VII. Anesthetic Management  
a. Monitoring  
1. All subject s will be monitored with standard  perioperative  monitors : ECG, 
non-invasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry, esophageal temperature, 
and capnography.  
 
b. Anesthetic Technique  
1. All subject s will receive a standardized general anesthetic technique and 
all anesthetic medications  will be dosed on the ideal body wei ght rather 
than actual body weight .  
2. Preoxygenation  – 100% oxygen  delivered via face mask  for a minimum of 
3 minutes  
6 
 3. Induction – intravenous delivery of propofol, 1.5-2.0 mg/kg , fentanyl, 1 
µg/kg, and rocuronium , 0.6 mg/kg . Additional propofol or fentanyl may be 
administered at the discretion of the anesthesia provider . 
4. Mask Ventilation – start when subject loses consciousness. Ventilation 
settings will be pressure controlled ventilation 20 cmH 2O. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_289941] 1 6. Group A will receive 1 minute of neutral head position 
followed by 1 minute of 45 degree head rotation to the right and then 1 
minute of neutral  head position.  Group B will be the opposite.  If mask 
ventilation is difficult  or SpO2 saturation drops below 90%  the subject will 
be excluded from the study. Immediately after exclusion the standard of 
care ventilation will be resumed.  
5. Intubation – will be in the standard of ca re fashion after the [ADDRESS_353639] of care. 
 
4.4 Costs : 
The cost of the Medline Top Valve Anesthesia Mask  used in this study will be billed to 
subjects’ insurance as normal standard of care  at University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] . Face masks are 
used on surgical  patients as standard of care following  University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_289942] . They are necessary for 
[ADDRESS_353640] to subjects.  
 
4.5 Study Duration:  
Study will start  in September [ADDRESS_353641] one year.  
 
5.1 Statistical Analysis and Sample Size Justification:  
A power analysis u sing a predicted tidal volume of [ADDRESS_353642] s per group  
would be needed  to achieve a power of 80% with an alpha  error  of 5%.

Protocol Number:  1042 -0900  Phase of Development: 2a 
Title of Protocol : A 26 week Multicenter, Open -Label Proof -of-Concept Trial of 
Ganaxolone in Children with PCDH19 Female Pediatric Epi[INVESTIGATOR_798318] a 52 Week Open Label Treatment  
Primary Objectives:  To evaluate the efficacy of open -label ganaxolone as adjunctive 
therapy  for uncontrolled seizures in children with genetic epi[INVESTIGATOR_31629] . These  includ e, but 
are not limited to children with protocadherin19 ( PCDH19 ) mutation , cyclin -dependent 
kinase like 5 ( CDKL5 ) Disorder , Dravet Syndrome  and other epi[INVESTIGATOR_798320] -Gastaut syndrome  (LGS) , Continuous Spi[INVESTIGATOR_798321] (CSWS) and other  potential genetic or clinical conditions  with or 
without corresponding genetic condition  (referred  to as genetic epi[INVESTIGATOR_31629]) in an open -
label proof -of-concept study . 
Secondary Objectives:  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of open -label 
ganaxolone as adjunctive therapy for uncontrolled seizures in children with genetic 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_31629].  
Study Design and Methodology:  After establishing baseline seizure frequency, 
qualifying subjects will ent er the study and be treated with ganaxolone oral suspension 
or ganaxolone capsules at doses up to 63 mg/kg but not more than 1800 mg/day for up 
to six months.  
Study Population and Main Criteria for Inclusion/Exclusion : Subjects  between 2 
and 1 8 years of age with a confirmed PCDH19 mutation , or a confirmed CDKL5 
mutation or Dravet syndrome  with a confirmed SCN1A mutation  or LGS , or CSWS or 
potential other  genetic or clinical  conditions with or without corresponding genetic 
condition  and consent o f a parent or guardian may be eligible to enter the study.  
Seizure criteria as follows:  
a. Have uncontrolled cluster seizures (3 or more seizures over the course 
of 12 hours) every [ADDRESS_1101102]  uncontrolled non -clustered seizures (focal dyscognitive, focal 
convulsive, atypi[INVESTIGATOR_353012], hemiclonic seizures, spasms, or tonic -
spasm seizures) with a frequency [ADDRESS_1101103] ≥4 generalized convulsive (tonic -clonic, tonic, clonic, atonic 
seizures) per [ADDRESS_1101104]  subclinical CSWS syndrome with or without clinical events on 
electroencephalogram  (EEG ). 
 
Subjects should be on a stable regimen of AED  medication , and generally in good 
health without active central nervous system (CNS) infection  or progressive disease or 
clinically unstable psychiatric disorder  likely to require new treatment during the study  
Subjects who have completed all scheduled clinical study visits and have shown a 
minimum 35% improvement in mean seizure frequency per 28 days vs. baseline may 
be enrolled in the 52 week open label extension . 
Number of Subjects : Approximately ten  (10) subjects with PCDH19, [ADDRESS_1101105], Dose and Mode of Admin istration : Ganaxolone oral suspension  50 
mg/mL dosed TID, or ganaxolone 200 mg or 225  mg capsules  administered in BID. 
Oral suspension or capsules to be administered  up to a total of  63 mg/kg/day but not 
more than 1800 mg/day.  
Duration of Treatment:  After establishi ng baseline seizure type and frequency for  a 
minimum of 4 weeks and  up to 12 weeks, s ubjects entering the study will be treated 
with ganaxolone for 26 weeks , in the main portion of the study, and up to an additional 
52 weeks if clinical response is establi shed plus additional time to down -titrate (1 to 4 
weeks).  
Reference Therapy, Dose and Mode of Administration: Not applicable  
 
Criteria for Evaluation:   
Primary Efficacy:  Primary efficacy will be percent change in seizure frequency  (focal 
dyscognitive or focal convulsive ) per 28 days relative to the baseline . 
 
Secondary Efficacy : Secondary efficacy assessments include evaluation of inter-
cluster interval, time to reach baseline number of seizure s, seizure -free interval , 50% 
responder propor tion, proportion with 50% increase in inter -cluster interval , CGI -I. 
Safety:  Neurological and physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, 
electrocardiogram (ECG),  vital signs, EEG and spontaneously reported adverse events 
(AEs) . 
Serum Levels:  Blood samples will be drawn at  baseline , 2 weeks, 8 weeks, 26 weeks  
and at each visit in the open labeled extension  and at unscheduled visits as needed for 
evaluation of blood chemistry and hematology, and  to measure levels of ganaxolone, 
concomitant AED medications, allopregnanolone, and related endogenous CNS -active 
steroids.   
Statistical Methods:   
The primary and  secondary efficacy variables will be summarized and using 
descriptive statistics  for the populations of all subjects and completers . Individual 
subject data will also be presented.

 7. INTRODUCTION  
Patients with rare epi[INVESTIGATOR_798326]19  Female Pediatric Epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] , CDKL5 
Disorder , and Dravet Syndrome  as well as many other refractory genetic epi[INVESTIGATOR_798327].    These may overlap idiopathic Lennox -Gastaut syndrome ( LGS ) patients or other 
genetically based conditions with intractable epi[INVESTIGATOR_798328].  This 
population has been, at times, treated with and responsive to classes of corticosteroids like 
prednisone or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).  Another epi[INVESTIGATOR_798329] ( CSWS ) or Epi[INVESTIGATOR_798330] 
(ESES) may also respond to steroid medications and be refractive to standard antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_343380].  The mechanism by [CONTACT_798371] s contributes to the development 
of epi[INVESTIGATOR_798331] . No one anticonvulsant has been found to be uniformly 
effective, and often multiple anticonvulsants are needed.   Even then, patients still become 
treatment resistant. Therefore the need for novel treatments to address seizu re control is 
critical for patients living with these conditions.  
This study will test ganaxolone as an experimental drug with a new and disti nct mechanism 
of action.  Ganaxo lone is the 3-methylated synthetic analog of allopregnenolone , an 
endogenous allosteric modulator of GABA A receptors  in the CNS. Ganaxolone has potency 
and efficacy comparable to allopregnanolone11 in activating synaptic and extrasynaptic 
GABA A receptor s at a site distinct from the benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_73589].  Ganaxolone has  
protective activity in diverse rodent seizure models . 12, 13, [ADDRESS_1101113] demonstrated ganaxolone has anticonvulsant efficacy with an 
acceptable safety and tolerability profile in the dose range of 900 -1800 mg in adults and 
children, the present study is planned to investigate whether ganaxolone provides efficacy 
for children with uncontrolled seizures and  PCDH19 Female -Pediatric Epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] , and other 
genetic epi[INVESTIGATOR_31629].

 BACKGROUND ON PCDH19  
Protocadherin (PCDH)19 - female -pediatric  epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] (F PE), also known as PCDH19 
female -limited epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] (FLE) or epi[INVESTIGATOR_798332] (EFMR),  is 
a serious epi[INVESTIGATOR_798333] -onset cluster seizures, cognitive and 
sensory impairment of varying degrees, and behavioral  disturbances  in some individuals .1 
This disorder is associated with a mutation of the PCDH19 gene, the gene that encodes for 
protocadherin19 on the X chromosome.2,3  The mechanism by [CONTACT_798372][INVESTIGATOR_798334], however protocadherin19 is a transmembrane protein of calcium -dependent 
cell-cell adhesion molecules that is strongly expressed in neural tissue (e.g., hippocampus, 
cerebral cortex, thalamus, amygdale), and which appears to be related to synaptic 
transmission and formation of synaptic conne ctions during brain developmen t.[ADDRESS_1101114], generally normal head circumference and other gro wth 
parameters and relative absence of autonomic dysfunction. 19

 Other symptoms of a CDKL5 disorder often include:  
Low muscle tone , hand wringing movements or mouthing of the hands , marked 
developmental delay , limited or absent speech , lack of eye contact [CONTACT_798373] , 
gastroesophageal reflux , constipation , small, cold feet , breathing irregularities such as 
hyperventilation , grinding of the teeth , epi[INVESTIGATOR_798335] , 
low/Poor muscle tone , very limited hand skills , some autistic -like tendencies , scoliosis ,

as epi[INVESTIGATOR_798336], polymorphic epi[INVESTIGATOR_261445] (PMEI) or severe 
myoclonic epi[INVESTIGATOR_261445] (SMEI). The disease begins in infancy but is lifelong.  17,18 
 
About 80% of people with this syndrome have a gene mutation (SCN1A is the most 
frequent) that causes problems in the way that ion channels in the brain work. 
Approximately 95% of patients with Dravet syndrome have de novo he terozygous 
mutations, which explains the unaffected status of many sib lings  and parents . 17,[ADDRESS_1101116] normal development at the 
time the seizures begin , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) and electroencephalogram 
(EEG ) tests are also normal in infancy.  17,18 
 
Myoclonic seizures appear between 1 and 5 years in 85% of children with Dravet 
syndrome.  Seizures early in life are often prolonged (lasting more than 2 minutes) or 
repetitive and ca n result in status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]. Children with Dravet syndrome can develop

years from se izure onset.  Males (62%) show preponderance and up to 1/[ADDRESS_1101120] abnormal mental  state. The c linical manifestations  include t hree stages of evolution:  
• First stage before CSWS: infrequent nocturnal motor focal seizures, often 
hemiclonic status  epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397], absences, atonic, complex focal seizures, and 
generalized tonic -clonic seizures occur.  
• Second stage with CSWS: seizures more frequent and complicated with typi[INVESTIGATOR_798340], myoclonic absences, absence status epi[INVESTIGATOR_428564], 
rarely atonic or clonic seizures, and  focal simple or partial complex dyscognitive 
seizures, usually nocturnally during CSWS condition on EEG and some secondary 
or primary  generalized tonic -clonic seizures. Tonic seizures do not occur .  Eminent 
psycho motor decline and behavioral abnormalities , and a Wernicke ’s type or global 
language regression occurs with localization of perisylvian cortex on EEG and 
magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) studies.  
• Third stage (after months to usually 2 to 10 years) with remission of CSWS  and 
seizures and general improvement , normalization of CSWS pattern, and residual 
language or other learning difficulties.  
• New genetic overlap to autism genetics and epi[INVESTIGATOR_798341], 
mainly Grin2A or Grin2B among others. Many may be idiopathic to testing.  
 
BACKGROUND ON GANAXO LONE  
More than  1,[ADDRESS_1101121] received treatment with ganaxolone in 
clinical trials, ranging in durati on from one day to more than two years using doses from 
50 to 2000 mg/day. In the Phase [ADDRESS_1101122] placebo -controlled study (N=147) 
of ganaxolone in epi [INVESTIGATOR_798342] 10 -week, double -blind Study 1042 -0600 followed by [CONTACT_798374] -label extension  of up to two years duration . Study 1042 -0600  showed ganaxolone 
(500 mg tid ) adjunctive therapy significantly reduced partial onset seizures, with or without 
secondary generalizations, compared to placebo (p= 0.014). Ganaxolone -treated subjects 
experienced a median decrease of 26% (17.6% mean) compared to a 10.2% median 
decrease in placebo (2.0% mean  increase for the placebo arm ). 
Ganaxolone has been studied in 5 studies of pediatric seizure disorders in children aged 4 
months through 15 years.  Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_798343]. Four  open -
label studies tested ga naxolone oral suspension at doses up to 36 mg/kg/day  in subjects 
with history or current infantile spasms plus other seizure types  including focal and 
generalized tonic -clonic , resistant to available medications. Across the four studies, 
approximately  two thirds of subjects experienced some improvements in seizures and one 
third of subjects in these open -label investigations experienced improvements of 50% or 
greater from baseline seizure frequency. A double -blind, placebo controlled partial 
crossover trial of ganaxolone in infants (N=57) with infantile spasms did not show a 
statistically significant reduction in spasms between treatment groups  over the 8-10 day 
treatment period, though only 18 subjects were exposed to placebo. Fifty -four subjects 
entered th e long term open -label extension study, where 25% were recorded as seizure -free 
on the video EEG at study endpoint.   
Most of the adverse events reported in the clinical development program were mild or 
moderate in severity, dose -related, resolved upon tre atment discontinuation , and expected 
based on ganaxolone pharmacology . The most common adverse events across clinical trials 
are dizziness, fatigue and somnolence.  The adverse event profile of ganaxolone in pediatric 
studies is similar to that seen in adu lts, without evidence of unique, clinically meaningful 
adverse events specific to the pediatric population.  Adult and pediatric subjects in open 
label extension studies to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_798344] > 2  years 
(a few children as  long as 4 years) with no new adverse events reported as compared to the 
controlled trials.  Three deaths have been reported in the program, none related to 
ganaxolone.

signs, or physical or neurological examinations have been noted in the clinical studies, and 
no mean changes from baseline in clinical labs have been identified. Transient i ncreases in 
LFTs (>3xULN) have been noted in less than 1% of  subjects treated with ganaxolone. 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) reported in the ganaxolone epi[INVESTIGATOR_798345] a Scientific Advisory Board to be usual for the population without an y pattern 
attributable to ganaxolone  (References 13 -16 and Marinus, data on file) .  
Preclinical safety pharmacology and toxicology testing  with ganaxolone has not revealed 
any end organ toxicity nor potential for ganaxolone to cause cellular mutations or 
carcinogenicity in studies to date.   In reproductive toxicology  testing, ganaxolone did not 
cause any malformations of the embryo or fetus in rats or mice and did not significantly 
affect the development of offspring. Ganaxolone is primarily metabolized by [CONTACT_2750]3A 
family of liver enzymes, but interactions based on hepatic metabolism are limited to those 
caused by [CONTACT_299542]3A4/[ADDRESS_1101123] demonstrated ganaxolone has anticonvulsant efficacy with an acceptable 
safety and tolerability profile in the dose range of 900 -1800 mg in adults and children, t he 
present study is planned to i nvestigate whether ganaxolone provides anticonvulsant 
efficacy for female children with uncontrolled seizures and PCDH19 mutation.

 9. INVESTIGATION PLAN  
9.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
The purpose of this proof -of-concept study is to evaluate ganaxolone as adjunctive 
therapy for uncontrolled seizures in female children with PCDH19 mutations , CDKL5 
mutation and SCN1A mutation ( Dravet syndrome ) and other epi[INVESTIGATOR_798347] , CSWS and other  potential genetic or clinical conditions  with or without 
corresponding genetic condition  (refer red to as genetic epi[INVESTIGATOR_31629]) in an op en-label proo f-
of-concept study.  After establishing baseline seizure frequency, qualifying subjects will 
enter the study and be treated with open -label ganaxolone oral suspension or ganaxolone 
capsules at doses up to  a maximum of  1800 mg/day for up to six months. Maxi mum 
study participation will be  94 weeks :  a screening period  to establish baseline seizure 
frequency, [ADDRESS_1101124] article as adjunctive therapy to background 
antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_006] ( AEDs ) provides standard -of-care therapy in addition to any benefit 
that study medication might provide.  
9.[ADDRESS_1101125] prior history of steroid or ACTH response can also be 
entered if documentation confirms specific genetic defects are not found and prior 
steroid response clinically occurred.  
4. Seizure criteria:  
a. Have uncontrolled cluster seizures (3 or more seizures over the course of 12 
hours) every [ADDRESS_1101126]  uncontrolled non -clustered seizures (focal dyscognitive, focal 
convulsive, atypi[INVESTIGATOR_353012], hemiclonic seizures, spasms, or tonic -spasm 
seizures) with a frequency [ADDRESS_1101127]  ≥4 generalized convulsive (tonic -clonic, tonic, clonic, atonic seizures) 
per [ADDRESS_1101128] be  administered with food.  
8. Sexually active women of child bearing potential (WCBP) must be using a 
medically acceptable method of birth control and have a negative urine sample at 
the baseline visit. A woman of childbearing potential is defined as a female w ho is 
biologically capable of becoming pregnant. A medically acceptable method of 
birth control includes intrauterine devices in place for at least 3 months, surgical 
sterilization, or adequate barrier methods (e.g., diaphragm and foam). An oral 
contracept ive alone is not considered adequate for the purpose of this study. Use 
of oral contraceptives in combination with another method (e.g., a spermicidal 
cream) is acceptable. In subjects who are not sexually active, abstinence is an 
acceptable form of birth control and urine will be tested per protocol . 
 
9. Subject must be approved to participate by [CONTACT_733705] 
[INVESTIGATOR_798348], Inc.   Page [ADDRESS_1101129] shown a minimum 35% improvement in 
mean seizure frequency per [ADDRESS_1101130] a combination of PCDH19 and SCN1A genetic 
mutation . 
4. Exposure to any investigational drug or device < 90 days prior to screening , or 
plans to participate in another drug or device trial  at any time during the study . 
5. Seizures secondary to illicit drug or alcohol use, infection, neoplasm, 
demyelinating disease , degenerative neurological disease, or central nervous 
system ( CNS ) disease deemed progressive, metabolic illness, or progressive 
degenerative disease.  
6. Concurrent use of vigabatrin , tiagabine, ezogabine  or finasteride  is not permitted , 
nor use of moderate or severe inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 /5/7. Individuals 
with prior use of  vigabatrin must have had stable visual fields tested twice over 
the [ADDRESS_1101131] of CYP3A4 /5/7 inhibitors 
and inducers is include d in the Appendix.  For Dravet Syndrome subjects the 
following are also excluded: phenytoin, fosphenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
oxcarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050],  lamotrigine , rufinamide  and stiripentol (Italy specific) .

control. The patient will  need to meet criteria for current entry seizure 
frequency for ganaxolone study.  
7. Have any medical condition that, in the investigator's judgment, is considered to 
be clinically significant and could potentially affect subject safety or study 
outcome, including but not limited to: clinically significant cardiac, renal, 
pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hematologic or hepati c conditions; or a condition that 
affects the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of drugs.  
8. Have active suicidal plan/intent , or have had active suicidal thoughts in the past

levels > 3 times upper limits of normal (ULN) , or total bilirubin >1.[ADDRESS_1101134] at 
the baseline visit . 
10. Are planning to follow a ketogenic diet . If on ketogenic diet for more than 6 
months with stabl e lab oratory  values and seizure control then enrollment will be 
made on a case by [CONTACT_413].  
11. Is sexually active or pregnant.  
12. Unwilling to forgo  grapefruit and grapefruit juice from diet during the entire 
clinical trial .  
 
9.3.4 Removal of Subjects from  the Study  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Investigator -initiated withdrawal of a subject  
All subjects have  the right to withdraw from the clinical study  at any time , as stated in the  
informed consent form  (ICF).  The Investigator may discontinue s ubjects from the 
clinical study  if the subject's condition changes such that the Investigator feels it is not in 
her best interest to continue, or if she develops a concomitant illness that nec essitates 
treatment which might affect the outcome of the investigation, or if the subject is non -
compliant.  
Discontinuation decisions will be made at each participating site by [CONTACT_737] .  If 
feasible, the process of discontinuation  should be discu ssed with the Study Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_75534] .

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Early Termination  Procedures  
Subjects who are terminated from the study will be asked to return to the study center for 
a final safety assessment, initiate a down -titration, and to return unused study medication 
and to deliver remaining seizure calendars.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Consequences of Early Termination  
The protocol suggests  dose de -escalation of study medication over one  to four week s 
depending upon dose and duration of treatment. This recommendation is  based on 
cumulative evidence from various classes of CNS drugs that slow taper is benefici al. It is 
possible that abrupt cessation of the drug might cause discontinuation symptoms.  Every 
effort will be made to ensure implementation of the down -titration .   
9.4 Treatments   
9.4.1 Treatments administered  
Study medication will be provided as either oral sus pension or capsules.  Ganaxolone oral 
suspension should  be administered through an oral dosing syringe three times daily (TID)  
by a parent or guardian , following the morning, midday , and evening meal  or snack . Each 
dose should be separated by a minimum of 4 hours and a maximum of 8 hours. A missed 
dose of ganaxolone suspension  may be taken up to 4 hours before the next scheduled 
dose, otherwise, the missed dose should not be given . 
Ganaxolone capsules will be administered two times daily (BID),  following  the morning  
and evening meal  or snack . A missed dose of ganaxolone capsules may be taken up to 8  
hours before the next scheduled dose, otherwise, the missed dose should not be given .

completion of each study visit. Study medication (oral suspension and capsules) should 
be store d at room temperatu re 15°C to 25 °C (59°F to 86°F).  
9.4.[ADDRESS_1101135] number (e.g., 001) assigned by [CONTACT_8702].  
The clinical site is responsible for maintaining a current log of subj ect number 
assignments and bottle numbers  of the investigational product administered to each 
subject .  The subject’s initials (first/middle/last) and unique subject number are required 
to be entered on all clinical investigation docu mentation (i.e., CRFs , labeling of clinical 
materials and sampl es containers, drug accountability logs, etc.)  
9.4.4 Study Dosing and Dosage Adjustments  
For subjects >[ADDRESS_1101136]'s history, baseline seizure 
data and inclusion/exclusion criteria and determined a subject to be eligible for the study, 
ganaxolone treatment will be initiated  at a dose of 900 mg/day in divided doses . The dose 
will be increased by [CONTACT_3450] 20 to 50% (e.g., an increase from 900 mg/day to 1200 
mg/day is a 33% increase) a t intervals of not less than 3 days and not more than 2  weeks  
provided current dose is reasonably tolerated , until desired efficacy is achieved or a 
maximally tolerated dose (MTD) level is reached.  Subsequent dose adjustments should 
Marinus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Page 26 
Protocol 1042 -0900 , Version 6.0  08 April  2016  
 
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  
 be made in increments o f approximately 20 to 50% with a minimum of three days 
between dose changes, unless required for safety.  Any and each dose escalation above 
1500 mg/day requires a clinic visit scheduled 4 -6 days after the dose increase to assess 
safety and tolerability.  The maximum allowable dose is 1800 mg/day.   
For subjects ≤30 kg  
 
For children weighing 30 kg (66 lbs) or less , dosing should start at 18 mg/kg/day and be 
increased in ~20-50% increments at intervals of not less than 3 days and not more than 2 
weeks provide d current dose is reasonably tolerated, until desired efficacy is achieved or a 
maximally tolerated dose (MTD) level is reached. Subsequent dose adjustments should be 
made in increments of ~20-50% with a minimum of three days between dose changes, 
unless r equired for safety.  Any and each dose escalation above 54 mg/kg/day requires a 
clinic visit scheduled 4 -6 days after the dose increase to assess safety and tolerability.  The 
maximum allowable dose is 63 mg/kg/day. (see Appendix 4 for suggested dose escal ation 
schedule .) 
 
DOWN TITRATION  
 
At the conclusion of the study, or upon discontinuation if the subject is terminated from 
the study prior to Week 26, a period of down -titration from [ADDRESS_1101137]'s age, weight, dose and duration on study 
medication.  
9.4.5 Dose Administration  
Study medication will be provided as either oral suspension or capsules. Ganaxolone 
should be taken with a meal or snack , whether oral suspension or capsules. 
Ganaxolone capsules should be administered with a glass of water or other liquid. Note 
that grape fruit and grapefruit juice are prohibited during the study.  
 Ganaxolone oral suspension  will be administered through an oral dosing syringe 
administered or supervised by [CONTACT_3654]/guardians three times daily (TID) , following the 
morning, noon, and evening me al or snack . Each dose should be separated by a minimum 
of 4 hours and a maximum of 8 hours . A missed dose of study medication may be taken 
Marinus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Page 27 
Protocol 1042 -0900 , Version 6.0  08 April  2016  
 
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  
 up to 4 hours before the next scheduled dose, otherwise, the missed dose should not be 
given.  
Ganaxolone capsules  will be administered two times daily (BID),  following  the morning  
and evening meal  or snack . Each dose should be separated by a minimum of [ADDRESS_1101138] mental alertness.  They will also be cautioned that non -adherence to the 
dosing instructions (e.g. increasing the dose, taking th e study medication doses too close 
together ) could produce side effects .   
9.4.6 Missing a Dose  
Ganaxolone oral suspension : A missed dose of study medication may be taken up to 4 
hours before the next scheduled dose, otherwise, the missed dose should not be given.  
Ganaxolone capsules : A missed dose of medication may be taken up to 8 hours before 
the next dose, otherwise it should not be given.  
Subjects and their parent or legal guardian should be instructed that if s/he misses two 
days in a row or more, the s ite should be contact[CONTACT_798375].  
9.4.7 Background AED medication:  
Marketed medications indicated for the treatment of seizures ar e acceptable with the 
exception of vigabatrin , tiagabine , and ezogabine .  Felbamate  has restricted use. 
Chronic and rescue benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_798350].  Note:  
Vigabatrin : Current use of vigabatrin (Sabril) is not permitted for the duration of the 
study due to its  ophthalmologic toxicity, as well as prior use of vigabatrin without stable 
visual fields tested twice over the [ADDRESS_1101139] dose of vigabatrin.  
Marinus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Page 28 
Protocol 1042 -0900 , Version 6.0  08 April  2016  
 
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  
 Felbamate : Felbamate (Felbatol) is permitted as a concomitant medication only if the 
subject has be en on felbamate for at least [ADDRESS_1101140]/ALTs and 
hematology laboratory tests  and is expected to remain constant throughout the study . 
9.4.[ADDRESS_1101141] of medications that are inducers or inhibitors of CYP 3A4/[ADDRESS_1101142]’s ability to comply with protocol 
requirements . Concomitant medications prescribed by a physician other than the 
Investigator should be comm unicated to the Investigator promptly. The Investigator must 
make the decision to authorize the use of such a medication only after considera tion of 
the clinical situation, the potential for masking symptoms of a more significant 
underlying event, and whether the use of the medication will compromise the outcome or 
validity of the clinical investigation. The Sponsor and the study Principal Inve stigator  
may be consulted for additional input.  If medication is required, the name, strength, 
frequency, and reason for use will be recorded in so urce documents and the case report 
form ( CRF ). 
9.4.9 Treatment Compliance  
Subjects who are not compliant with stud y visits, study medications and seizure calenda rs 
may be removed from the study at the discretion of the Investigator or Sponsor.  
 
9.5 Efficacy and Safety Variables  
 
9.5.1 Calculation of Baseline  
Baseline will be calculated from  a maximum of  12 weeks' of seizure calendar data  with a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_1101143] 
Seizure Calendars that will be used for the primary analysis of efficacy.  
The primary outcome measure is the percent age change  in seizure ( focal dyscognitive or 
focal convulsive ) frequency per 28 days relative to baseline .  
Secondary  efficacy outcome measures include  evalu ation of inter -cluster interval;  time to 
reach baseline number of seizures (per 28 days); seizure -free intervals ; proportion  of 
subjects with 50% improvement in number of seizures compared with baseline:  and 
proportion of subjects whose inter -cluster interval increases by 50% or more. Additional 
measures may be added.  Data will be analyzed for the ITT and Per Protocol populations 
if they differ.  
The Clinical Global Impression of Improvement: Clinician (CGII -C) and Clinical Global 
Impression of Improvement: Patient/Caregiver (CGII -P) are secondary efficacy 
assessments.  
 
9.5.3 Safety Assessments  
Planned safety assessments include:  
 
Neurological and physic al examinations  
Clinical laboratory tests  
12-lead ECG  
EEG  
Vital signs including temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate, and weight  
AE monitoring :  frequency, severity, duration, causality, outcome  
Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS)  
 
Clinical l abs, vitals , EEG  and ECG measurements may be repeated if needed to 
corroborate or refute abnormal findings.  Both the original and replicate assessm ents 
should be recorded in the CRF.

10.3 Study Discontinuation  
The Sponsor has the right to terminate this study at any time.  Reasons for terminating the 
study may include  but are not limited to  the following:  
1. Identification of new safety risk(s) or a change in the incidence or severity of  
known risk(s) of ganaxolone that  indicates a potential health hazard to subjects.  
2. Subject enrollment is unsatisfactory.  
3. Data recording is inaccurate or incomplete , adversely a ffecting the ability to 
interpret results from the study . 
10.[ADDRESS_1101152]’s legal guardian must be presented with the ICF, given an opportunity to ask 
questions, and must sign the ICF before the subject may participate  in any study -related 
procedures or activities .  The consent process should be doc umented in the subject’s 
medical record. A signed copy of the ICF must be provided to the subject or the subject’s 
legal guardian.  When applicable, it will be provided in a certified translation of the local 
language.  
Signed consent forms must remain in e ach subject’s study file and must be available for 
verification by [CONTACT_9534].  
10.[ADDRESS_1101153] throughout 
the study for possible adverse events.  All necessary information about an AE (onset, 
duration, severity, seriousness, causality to study drug, action taken, and outcome ) should 
be documented in the case report form and the AEs sho uld be followed until either 
completely resolved or until a stable chronic outcome is determined by [CONTACT_798382], Inc.   Page [ADDRESS_1101154] medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug 
in humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including a  clinically significant  abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom  or disease temporally associated with the use of a n investigational 
product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product.  Any worsening 
of a preexisting condition  (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency 
and/or i ntensity)  which is temporally associated with the use of the investigational  
product, is also an adverse event.  
A serious adverse event  (SAE ) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose 
(including overdose) that  meets one or more of the following c riteria : 
• Is fatal , as a direct outcome of the AE 
• Is life threatening  
This serious criterion applies if the subject, in the view of the Investigator, is at 
substantial risk of dying from the AE as it occurs.  It does not apply if an AE 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_62981] 
(in the US) or  a minimum 24-hour inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  (outside US)  or, if in  the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], prolongs an existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_528074] , a routinely scheduled treatment  or a social admission  is not an 
SAE . 
• Results in permanent or significant disability/incapacity  
This seriou s criterion applies if the “disability” caused by [CONTACT_243077] a 
substantial disruption of the subject’s ability to carry out normal life functions.  
• Results in  a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
This serious criterion applies if a subject expo sed to the investigational product gives 
birth to a child with congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
Important medical events that do not meet any of the criteria above may be considered 
serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopard ize the subject 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in 
this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dy scrasias or convulsions 
Marinus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.   Page [ADDRESS_1101155], will be recorded in the appropriate section of the CRF and evaluated by 
[CONTACT_737].  
Minimum information required for each AE includes type o f event, duration (start and 
end dates), severity, seriousness, causality to study drug, action taken, and outcome.  
Severity of AEs will be graded by [CONTACT_192326]:  
1.  Mild:  Nuisance, barely noticeable.  
2.  Mo derate:  Uncomfortable, troublesome symptoms not significantly 
interfering with daily activities or sleep.  
3.  Severe:  Symptoms significantly interfere with daily activities or sleep.  
 
The relationship of the AE to the study drug should be specified by [CONTACT_737], using 
the following definitions:  
1.  Not Related:  Concomitant illness, accident or event with no reasonable 
association with study drug . 
2.  Unlikely  Related : The event  has little or no temporal sequence from administration 
of the study drug,  and/or a more likely alternative etiology exists.  
3.  Possibly Related:  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of study drug but which could also be explained 
by [CONTACT_798383]  
4.  Probably  Related:  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of study drug, unlikely to be attributed 
to concurrent disease or other factors or medications. A clinically 
reasonable response may be observed if the study drug is 
withdrawn o r dose reduced.  
5.  Definitely Related:  the event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of study drug and is definitive 
pharmacologically;  cannot to be attributed to  concurrent disease 
or other factors or medications. A clinically reas onable response

 should be observed if the study drug is withdrawn or dose 
reduced.  
 
When applicable, a syndrome ("flu syndrome") that describes a constellation of AEs 
should be recorded in the CRF in place of the individual AE terms (fever, sore throat, 
rhinitis).

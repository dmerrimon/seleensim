Protocol v7.0 dated 16Dec2022  9 of 613.0 OBJECTIVES & HYPOTHESES
3.1 Primary Objectives & Hypotheses
Objective: Part A: To estimate the safety of delivering 2 cycles APVD to patients with previously 
untreated cHL. Part B: To estimate the 1-year event free survival (EFS) for advanced stage patients 
treated with APVD. An event will be defined as progression, biopsy proven recurrence, initiation 
of next line of chemotherapy, or death.
Hypothesis: We hypothesize that a combination of pembrolizumab with AVD 
chemotherapy (Doxorubicin, Vinblastine and Dacarbazine) for use in the front line setting 
for chemotherapy naïve patients with cHL will be safe and potentially efficacious.
3.2 Secondary Objective & Hypotheses
Objective :  To estimate the FDG-PET2 negative (Deauville score 1-3) after 2 cycles of APVD.
3.3 Exploratory Objective
Objective: Overall survival, association of biomarkers with early CR. Predictive capacity of 
PET2 after APVD. To evaluate the impact of APVD on T-cell repertoire and diversity. To 
evaluate the ability of this regimen to attain minimal residual disease as measured by [CONTACT_077]. 
3.4 Background
Efficacy and limitations of ABVD
ABVD (Doxorubicin, Bleomycin, Vinblastine, and Dacarbazine) is a component of a standard 
regimen in North America for treatment of classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma (cHL) regardless of 
disease stage. It was originally developed in 1970, showed similar efficacy compared with MOPP 
regimen (Mechlorethamine, Vincristine, Procarbazine, and Prednisone) and more importantly had 
an improved tolerability and toxicity profile1. In the advanced cHL setting, ABVD use offers up 
to 70% long term tumor control rate2. However, up to 25% of patients do not respond completely 
to ABVD3. Additionally, of the initial responders relapse occurs in a significant proportion of 
patients who then require salvage chemotherapy, high dose chemotherapy, autologous stem cell 
transplant, brentuximab-vedotin, nivolumab or pembrolizumab4. Nevertheless, ABVD is still 
considered a standard frontline regimen for classical cHL despi[INVESTIGATOR_131866]-third of 
patients will not be cured with this approach.
Toxicity of Bleomycin
ABVD use is associated with toxicities, both acute and long term. Bleomycin is most commonly 
implicated for causing severe toxicity, specifically, acute pulmonary toxicity - dyspnea on 
exertion, cough with dyspnea and decline in pulmonary function tests 5,6. These can be potentiated 
Fred Hutch IRB
Approved 
10/18/[ADDRESS_148938] been seen with checkpoint blockade 
based cancer immunotherapy in cHL. Tumors evade the T cell anti-tumor activity by [CONTACT_123481]-1/PD-L1/PD-L2 pathway. In cHL overexpression of PD-1 ligands in the RS cells10 and the 
tumor associated macrophages11 is seen. These cells engage the PD-1 receptor on the T cells, thus 
inducing immune tolerance. This allows tumor to evade the immune surveillance10. 
Pembrolizumab is a humanized IgG4 anti-PD-1 antibodies which blocks T cell inhibition, thereby 
[CONTACT_104094]-tumor T cell activity12. Pembrolizumab and the anti-PD-1 are both FDA approved 
for treatment of relapsed/refractory cHL patients based on 4 studies13, though pembrolizumab has 
a broader label of approval. Pembrolizumab demonstrated a 65% overall response rate 
(KETNOTE 13) in the first trial at a dose of 10mg/kg every 2 weeks and an overall response rate 
of 69% in the KEYNOTE-87 trial at a dose of 200mg every 3 weeks 14, 15. The patients in these 
studies were heavily pre-treated with chemotherapy, autologous stem cell transplant and novel 
antibody drug conjugate, Brentuximab-Vedotin. Pembrolizumab was overall well tolerated, no 
grade 4-5 drug related toxicities were noted in ≥5% of the patients. 
Front Line Use and Combinations of anti-PD1 and chemotherapy:
Both Pembrolizumab and Nivolumab have been successfully used as part of intial therapy and 
combined with chemotherapy further improve the response rates 15, 16, 17, 18. It is postulated that 
chemotherapy causes release of tumor antigens and in this setting the immune response can be 
further potentiated by [CONTACT_131876]. In a phase I study the safety and efficacy of 
Nivolumab combined with platinum based doublet chemotherapy for first line treatment of 
advanced NSLC was reported. Among the [ADDRESS_148939] 6 weeks of therapy. 45% patients reported grade [ADDRESS_148940] been observed using pembrolizumab as part of initial therapy 20-22. For 
example, the large KEYNOTE-21 showed no higher rates of AEs ≥ grade 3 in the chemo alone or 
chemo+pembrolizumab groups22.  In further support of this approach in patients with lymphoma 
we are currently carrying out a phase II trial of pembrolizumab + R-CHOP in patients with 
untreated DLBCL with no apparent increase in toxicity over R-CHOP alone (Smith et al- 
unpublished data). 
Pembrolizumab is a potent humanized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody 
(mAb) with high specificity of binding to the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor, 
thus inhibiting its interaction with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and

Protocol v7.0 dated 16Dec2022  11 of 61programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD-L2).  Based on preclinical in vitro data, 
pembrolizumab has high affinity and potent receptor blocking activity for PD-1.  
Pembrolizumab has an acceptable preclinical safety profile and is in clinical development 
as an intravenous (IV) immunotherapy for advanced malignancies.  Keytruda® 
(pembrolizumab) is indicated for the treatment of patients across a number of indications 
because of its mechanism of action to bind the PD-[ADDRESS_148941] immune surveillance function in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic 
transformations has been known for decades1.  Accumulating evidence shows a correlation 
between tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in various 
malignancies.  In particular, the presence of CD8+ T-cells and the ratio of CD8+ effector 
T-cells/FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells (T-regs) correlates with improved prognosis and long-term 
survival in solid malignancies, such as ovarian, colorectal, and pancreatic cancer; 
hepatocellular carcinoma; malignant melanoma; and renal cell carcinoma.  Tumor-infiltrating 
lymphocytes can be expanded ex vivo and reinfused, inducing durable objective tumor 
responses in cancers such as melanoma [Dudley et al., 2005; Hunder et al., 2008].
The PD-[ADDRESS_148942] hijacked by [CONTACT_55548].  The normal function of PD-1, expressed on the cell surface of activated 
T-cells under healthy conditions, is to down-modulate unwanted or excessive immune 
responses, including autoimmune reactions. PD-1 (encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1) is an 
immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily member related to cluster of differentiation 28 (CD28) and 
cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) that has been shown to negatively 
regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD-L1 and/or PD-L2) 
[Greenwald et al., 2005; Okazaki et al., 2001].
The structure of murine PD-1 has been resolved [Zhang et al., 2004].  PD-1 and its family 
members are type I transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig-variable–type (IgV-type) 
domain responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail responsible for the binding of 
signaling molecules.  The cytoplasmic tail of PD-1 contains 2 tyrosine-based signaling motifs, 
an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif, and an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based 
switch motif.  Following T-cell stimulation, PD-1 recruits the tyrosine phosphatases, SHP-
1 and SHP-2, to the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif within its cytoplasmic tail, 
leading to the dephosphorylation of effector molecules such as CD3 zeta (CD3ζ), protein 
kinase C-theta (PKCθ), and zeta-chain-associated protein kinase (ZAP70), which are involved 
in the CD3 T-cell signaling cascade [Okazaki et al., 2001; Chemnitz et al., 2004; Sheppard et 
al., 2004; and Riley, 2009].  The mechanism by [CONTACT_13209]-[ADDRESS_148943] from, that of CTLA-4, because both molecules regulate an 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_77971] [Parry et al., 2005; Francisco, 2010].  As a consequence, 
the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in [disease under 
study].

3.5 Rationale
3.5.1 Rationale for the Trial and Selected Population
The selected patient population is patients with untreated Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma.  
Pembrolizumab can be safely combined with a variety of chemotherapeutic agents in the front 
line setting, has a >60% response rate as a single agent in patients with highly-refractory cHL 
and a toxicity profile that is non-overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_131867]. Though not compared in 
a head-to head fashion, the clinical activity of pembrolizumab appears superior to what one 
would expect with single agent bleomycin and potentially brentuximab-vedotin. Recent data also 
suggest that omitting bleomycin in responding patients is safe and retains efficacy and is a 
standard of care in select patients. We hypothesize that the proposed APVD regimen may offer 
better efficacy and better tolerability in the front line setting for treatment of classical cHL. This 
study will address the safety of a minimum of [ADDRESS_148944] been enrolled (unpublished data). We noted a CR rate of 65% 
on interim PET (slightly lower than previously presented in standard ABVD2). [ADDRESS_148945] had a positive PET at end of treatment, but only one patient so far has had 
evidence of progressive CHL. 80% (4/5) of patients with FDG uptake post treatment 
never progressed at 8, 9, 18, and 19 months. These patients were either followed with 
serial imaging with resolution or underwent a biopsy.
These findings raise concerns that traditional methods of PET response assessment may 
be prone to false positives in patients treated with checkpoint inhibitor combinations. For 
this reason, we will plan to treat an additional 20 advanced stage patients with this 
regimen in order to better assess the activity of this regimen using a 1-year EFS endpoint.
3.5.2 Dosing Justification for Dose 
The planned dose of pembrolizumab for this study is 200 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W).  Based on the 
totality of data generated in the Keytruda development program, 200 mg Q3W is the appropriate dose 
of pembrolizumab for adults across all indications and regardless of tumor type.  As outlined below, 
this dose is justified by:
Clinical data from 8 randomized studies demonstrating flat dose- and exposure-efficacy 
relationships from 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W), 
Fred Hutch IRB
Approved 
10/18/2023
Protocol v7.0 dated 16Dec2022  13 of 61Clinical data showing meaningful improvement in benefit-risk including overall survival 
at 200 mg Q3W across multiple indications, and
Pharmacology data showing full target saturation in both systemic circulation (inferred 
from pharmacokinetic [PK] data) and tumor (inferred from physiologically-based PK 
[PBPK] analysis) at 200 mg Q3W
Among the 8 randomized dose-comparison studies, a total of 2262 participants were enrolled with 
melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), covering different disease settings (treatment naïve, 
previously treated, PD-L1 enriched, and all-comers) and different treatment settings (monotherapy and in 
combination with chemotherapy).  Five studies compared 2 mg/kg Q3W versus 10 mg/kg Q2W (KN001 
Cohort B2, KN001 Cohort D, KN002, KN010, and KN021), and 3 studies compared 10 mg/kg Q3W 
versus 10 mg/kg Q2W (KN001 Cohort B3, KN001 Cohort F2 and KN006).  All of these studies 
demonstrated flat dose- and exposure-response relationships across the doses studied representing an 
approximate 5- to 7.5-fold difference in exposure.  The 2 mg/kg (or 200 mg fixed-dose) Q3W provided 
similar responses to the highest doses studied.  Subsequently, flat dose-exposure-response relationships 
were also observed in other tumor types including head and neck cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer 
and classical Hodgkin Lymphoma, confirming [ADDRESS_148946], PK data in KN001 
evaluating target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) conclusively demonstrated saturation of PD-[ADDRESS_148947] tumor PD-1 saturation over a wide range of tumor penetration and PD-1 expression.  This 
evaluation concluded that pembrolizumab at 200 mg Q3W achieves full PD-1 saturation in both blood 
and tumor.
Finally, population PK analysis of pembrolizumab, which characterized the influence of body weight and 
other participant covariates on exposure, has shown that the fixed-dosing provides similar control of PK 
variability as weight based dosing, with considerable overlap in the distribution of exposures from the 
200 mg Q3W fixed dose and 2 mg/kg Q3W dose.  Supported by [CONTACT_131877], and given that 
fixed-dose has advantages of reduced dosing complexity and reduced potential of dosing errors, the 200 
mg Q3W fixed-dose was selected for evaluation across all pembrolizumab protocols.
3.5.3 Rationale for Endpoints
Definitions of Disease, Criteria for Evaluation and Endpoint Definitions – response will be defined by 
[CONTACT_131878] (Lugano 2014) for lymphoid malignancies.
Primary endpoint (Part A): The primary objective of this study is to estimate the safety of 2 cycles of 
APVD. Historical data regarding the tolerability of 2 cycles of ABVD are limited. In a recent trial of 
AVD+ brentuximab vedotin, 4 of 26 (~15%) patients were reported to be unable to complete treatment. 
We will be more conservatively scoring treatment delay due to toxicity rather than inability to complete 
the entire treatment course. Thus, we will deem this regimen safe if >85% of patients are able to complete 
Fred Hutch IRB
Approved 
10/18/2023
Protocol v7.0 dated 16Dec2022  14 of 612 cycles of APVD without a dose delay of >3 weeks. This will be employed as a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_131868].
Part B: We plan to estimate the efficacy of this regimen using advanced stage patients (who are at higher 
risk of recurrence) with a projection that 1-year EFS will be at least as good as the 85% demonstrated in 
the ECHELON-1 study between the two arms3. See statistical section for detail.
3.5.4 Efficacy Endpoints
Secondary and Exploratory endpoints will examine the efficacy of this regimen. Our secondary 
endpoint is to estimate the proportion of FDG-PET2 negative (Deauville score 1-3) patients after 2 
cycles of APVD. Exploratory endpoints will estimate overall and progression free survival.
3.5.5 Biomarker Research
Correlative studies may be conducted whenever possible and may include PD1/PLDL1/PDL2 
expression, MRD (e.g. Adaptive Clonoseq or similar) and cytokine monitoring.  Tissue-based 
assays for tumor and immune infiltrate may be conducted when archival tissue is available.

Trial treatment should begin on the day of enrollment or as close as possible to the date on which 
treatment is allocated/assigned.
4.2.1 Timing of Dose Administration
Trial treatment of doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine should be administered on Day 1 and 15 of 
each cycle after all procedures/assessments have been completed as detailed on the Trial Flow Chart 
(Section 5.0).  Pembrolizumab 200 mg will be administered as a 30 minute IV infusion every 3 weeks 
starting on cycle 1 day 1.  Sites should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 
minutes as possible.  However, given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window of -5 
minutes and +10 minutes is permitted (i.e., infusion time is 30 minutes: -5 min/+10 min).
Each cycle of therapy is given every 28 days. Two cycles should be given per protocol. Administration 
may be +/-[ADDRESS_148961], followed by [CONTACT_131881], Vinblastine and Dacarbazine.

4.2.2 Dose Modification and toxicity management for immune-related AEs associated 
with pembrolizumab
AEs associated with pembrolizumab exposure may represent an immunologic etiology. These immune-
related AEs (irAEs) may occur shortly after the first dose or several months after the last dose of 
pembrolizumab treatment and may affect more than one body system simultaneously. Therefore, early 
recognition and initiation of treatment is critical to reduce complications.  Based on existing clinical study 
data, most irAEs were reversible and could be managed with interruptions of pembrolizumab, 
administration of corticosteroids and/or other supportive care. For suspected irAEs, ensure adequate 
evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Additional procedures or tests such as 
bronchoscopy, endoscopy, skin biopsy may be included as part of the evaluation. Based on the severity of 
irAEs, withhold or permanently discontinue pembrolizumab and administer corticosteroids. Dose 
modification and toxicity management guidelines for irAEs associated with pembrolizumab are provided 
in Table 3.

General instructions:
1.Severe and life-threatening irAEs should be treated with IV corticosteroids followed by [CONTACT_13215]. Other immunosuppressive treatment should 
begin if the irAEs are not controlled by [CONTACT_13216].
2.Study intervention must be permanently discontinued if the irAE does not resolve or the corticosteroid dose is not ≤10 mg/day within [ADDRESS_148963] study intervention treatment. 
3.The corticosteroid taper should begin when the irAE is ≤ Grade [ADDRESS_148964] 4 weeks.
4.If study intervention has been withheld, study intervention may resume after the irAE decreased to ≤ Grade 1 after corticosteroid taper.

Participants should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_124133].  Suggested supportive care measures for the management of AEs with potential 
immunologic etiology are outlined along with the dose modification guidelines in Section 4.2.2, 
[Table 3].  Where appropriate, these guidelines include the use of oral or IV treatment with 
corticosteroids, as well as additional anti-inflammatory agents if symptoms do not improve with 
administration of corticosteroids.  Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as 
symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased.  For each disorder, attempts should be 
made to rule out other causes such as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, which might 
require additional supportive care.  The treatment guidelines are intended to be applied when the 
Investigator determines the events to be related to pembrolizumab. 
Note: If after the evaluation of the event, it is determined not to be related to pembrolizumab, the 
Investigator does not need to follow the treatment guidance.  Refer to [Table 3] in Section 5.2.[ADDRESS_148974] any dose modifications (no change in dose or schedule) of pembrolizumab 
in this study.

6.3 Overdose and Reporting Requirements
For purposes of this study, an overdose of pembrolizumab will be defined as any dose of 1,000 mg or 
greater (≥5 times the indicated dose).  No specific information is available on the treatment of 
overdose of pembrolizumab. In the event of overdose, the participant should be observed closely for 
signs of toxicity.  Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated.
If an adverse event(s) is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of a [COMPANY_006] product, the adverse 
event(s) is reported as a serious adverse event, even if no other seriousness criteria are met.
If a dose of [COMPANY_006]’s product meeting the protocol definition of overdose is taken without any 
associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is reported as a non-serious 
Event of Clinical Interest (ECI), using the terminology “accidental or intentional overdose without 
adverse effect.”
All reports of overdose with and without an adverse event must be reported within 24 hours to the 
Sponsor and within 2 working days hours to [COMPANY_006] Global Safety. (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety;

7.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN
7.1 Statistical Analysis Plan
Part A:
The primary objective of this study is to estimate the safety of 2 cycles of APVD. Historical data 
regarding the tolerability of 2 cycles of ABVD are limited. In a recent trial of AVD+ brentuximab 
vedotin, 4 of 26 (~15%) patients were reported to be unable to complete treatment [Connors et al. 
2017]. treatment18. We will be more conservatively scoring treatment delay due to toxicity rather 
than inability to complete the entire treatment course. Thus, we will deem this regimen safe if 
>85% of patients are able to complete 2 cycles of APVD without a dose delay of >3 weeks. This 
will be employed as a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_131871]. 
Operationally, the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_131872] 95% confidence interval 
of toxicity crosses 15%. Thus, the trial would stop if 4/10, 7/20, 8/25, or 9 of 30 had a dose delay 
of >3 weeks due to toxicity. 
If the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_131873] (e.g., older, more comorbidities) or by [CONTACT_131893]. A report will be drafted for IRB review to either close the trial, modify 
and continue the trial, or continue the trial in an unmodified fashion. Since the study is not 
statistically powered for efficacy evaluation, the sample size justification is based on clinical 
evaluation on safety. If we use the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_131874] 30% patients were unable to complete treatment, 
then the 95% confidence interval for the assumed toxicity rate with 30 patients are 17% to 48%, 
which excluded 15% assumed rate. With smaller sample size, the width of the 95% CI will be 
larger, e.g. 15% to 52% for 20 patients, 16% to 50% for 25 patients, etc. The larger sample size 
will also lead to stable point estimation, so it will increase the chance for a more accurate 
observation. We anticipate that 30 patients will be required to reasonably estimate the safety of 
this regimen as defined above. Furthermore, assume the incidence rate of toxicity is around 15%, 
with sample size N=30, we will have more than 85% chance of observing more than two patients 
not finishing the trial and 99% chance of observing at least one such patient (see table 1)

In unpublished data, [ADDRESS_148998] completed 2 cycles of APVD, and there were no delays in 
treatments of greater than 21 days in any of these patients. Therefore, even without information on 
the final 2 patients, it can be determined that the primary endpoint for part A of the study has been 
met.
Part B:
Based on the rationale outlined in the background section, we plan to enroll 20 additional patients 
in part B (for a total of 50 between part A and B). We will only accrue advanced stage patients 
(stage 3 or 4) for this portion of the study.
In part A, we have enrolled [ADDRESS_148999] 39 
total advanced stage patients that are evaluable for efficacy data.
Given our concerns with PET-based assessments, we will analyze the 39 advanced patients for 
efficacy by [CONTACT_131894] 1-year EFS. An event will be defined as progression, biopsy proven 
recurrence, initiation of next line of chemotherapy, or death. The benchmark to deem this regimen 
as potentially efficacious will be 1-year EFS of 85% for this population3 (intermediate between 
the more commonly used ABVD and the more toxic but less commonly used brentuximab vedotin 
+ AVD). Towards this end, we shall consider an observed 1-year EFS among the [ADDRESS_149000] 0.85 (33 or more of 39) to be potentially efficacious and warrant further study of the current 
regimen (note that this will not necessarily imply a statistically significant improvement on this 
benchmark). The decision will also take into consideration secondary endpoints. The table below 
summarizes the probability of observing a 1-year EFS of at least 85% under a variety of assumed-
true 1-year EFS values.

escalation is investigated, it may be preferable to consider a score of 3 as inadequate 
response (to avoid undertreatment). Measured dominant lesions: Up to six of the largest 
dominant nodes, nodal masses, and extranodal lesions selected to be clearly measurable in 
two diameters. Nodes should preferably be from disparate regions of the body and should 
include, where applicable, mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas. Non-nodal lesions include 
those in solid organs (eg, liver, spleen, kidneys, lungs), GI involvement, cutaneous lesions, 
or those noted on palpation. Nonmeasured lesions: Any disease not selected as measured, 
dominant disease and truly assessable disease should be considered not measured. These 
sites include any nodes, nodal masses, and extranodal sites not selected as dominant or 
measurable or that do not meet the requirements for measurability but are still considered 
abnormal, as well as truly assessable disease, which is any site of suspected disease that 
would be difficult to follow quantitatively with measurement, including pleural effusions,

Protocol v7.0 dated 16Dec2022   59 of 61Appendix 4: Contraceptive Guidance and Pregnancy Testing
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless 
permanently sterile (see below) 
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP:
● Premenarchal
● Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:
○Documented hysterectomy
○Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]
○Documented bilateral oophorectomy
Note:  Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s medical records, 
medical examination, or medical history interview.
● Postmenopausal female
○A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical 
cause. 
▪A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to 
confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal 
replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, 
confirmation with two FSH measurements in the postmenopausal range is required. 
○Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the non-
hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the 
study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status 
before study enrollment.
Contraception Requirements
Male Participants:
Male participants with female partners of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they agree to 
one of the following during protocol treatment and for [ADDRESS_149017] dose: 
●Be abstinent from penile-vaginal intercourse as their usual and preferred lifestyle (abstinent on a long 
term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent
●Use a male condom plus partner use of a contraceptive method with a failure rate of <1% per year as 
described in Table 9 when having penile-vaginal intercourse with a woman of childbearing potential 
who is not currently pregnant.
○Note: Men with a pregnant or breastfeeding partner must agree to remain abstinent from penile-
vaginal intercourse or use a male condom during each epi[INVESTIGATOR_117492].
Fred Hutch IRB
Approved 
10/18/2023
60
Protocol v7.0 dated 16Dec2022   60 of 61Female Participants:
Female participants of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they agree to use two forms of 
birth control consistently and correctly during the protocol treatment and for [ADDRESS_149018] Low User Dependency 
Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly.
●Progestogen- only contraceptive implant a, b
●Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS) b
●Intrauterine device (IUD)
● Bilateral tubal occlusion
●Vasectomized partner 
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner is the 
sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an 
additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. 
●Sexual abstinence 
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment. The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the 
preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. 
Notes:
Use should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for 
participants of clinical studies.
a) If locally required, in accordance with Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) guidelines, 
acceptable contraceptive implants are limited to those which inhibit ovulation.
b) If hormonal contraception efficacy is potentially decreased due to interaction with study 
treatment, condoms must be used in addition to the hormonal contraception during the treatment 
period and for at least [120 days, corresponding to time needed to eliminate study treatment plus 30 
days for study treatments with genotoxic potential] after the last dose of study treatment.

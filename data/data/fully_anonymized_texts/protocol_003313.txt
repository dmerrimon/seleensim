Study Title:  Vitamin D Levels in Su bjects with Vitamin D Deficiency 
Following Topi[INVESTIGATOR_336781] D Gel – A Proof of 
Concept Study  
Protocol Number:  VITD -001 
Development Phase:  Phase 1   
Indication:  Subjects with known vitamin D deficiency   
(<20 μg/L Total 25 -OH Vitamin D)  
Study Drugs : 
(Including test, 
comparator, dosage 
form, dosing regimen 
and route)  A novel v itamin D 3 (cholecalciferol)  is provided as a topi[INVESTIGATOR_336782]/NF and/or designated in the 
list of Inactive Ingredients in FDA  Approved Drugs.  The ingredients in 
the topi[INVESTIGATOR_336783].  A single applicator  contains 0. 75g of gel, containing 
150,00 0 international units of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) to be 
applied to the upper arm.  One dose consists of two applicator s, one 
applied to each upper arm, for a total of 300,000 international units per 
dose.  
Subjects with known vitamin D deficiency of  ≤20 ng/ml  total 25 -OH 
Vitamin D  (50 nmol/liter ) will be consented and  enrolled . They  will 
have a blood draw prior to dosing on Day 1 (to obtain a baseline 
vitamin D , calcium, albumin, and parathyroid hormone level ) and will 
receive 300,000 units of topi[INVESTIGATOR_223952] D 3.  On Day 7, subjects will 
return to the clinic for a blood draw  to assess Vitamin D  level and to 
check for any signs of skin rash and/or reaction.   If a subject has a skin 
rash and/or reaction prior to Day 7, he/she will be advised to return to 
the clinic for assessment  as soon as possible . Any rash and/or skin 
reaction may be photographed and diagnosed.  A second dose of

for safety until Study Day [ADDRESS_416125] 4  
months to enroll and com plete dosin g and assessment of 20  patients.  
 
Objectives of the 
Study:  The primary objective of the study is to determine the change in 
vitamin D blood levels following 3 doses of  topi[INVESTIGATOR_26445] D3 
treatment.  The secondary objective is to assess the safety (based o n 
skin rash and/or other reaction , as well as calcium and parathyroid 
hormone levels ) following the application of 3 doses of vitamin D 3 gel. 
Study Endpoints:  
(Primary and 
Secondary)  The primary endpoint is to establish the average change in vitamin D 
blood levels following [ADDRESS_416126] any skin 
rash and/or other skin reaction following treatment with the vitamin D 
gel. 
Study Design:  The study is a pre vs. post open-label trial to assess the change in 
vitamin D blood levels following treatment with [ADDRESS_416127] a blo od draw prior to dosing on 
Day 0  (to obtai n a baseline vitamin D level) and will receive topi[INVESTIGATOR_336784] D [ADDRESS_416128] -dose blood draw and to be assessed for 
any signs of skin rash and/or reaction.  If a subject has a sk in rash

Protocol VITD -[ADDRESS_416134] that 19% of the U.S. population is  at risk for vitamin D inadequacy  1, although this 
may underest imate  the number of people at risk from  suboptimal vitamin D levels2. More 
than 40% of U.S. and European elderly men and women living in the community are 
deficient in Vitamin D3, and m ore than 50% of postmenopausal women taking medication for 
osteoporosis4. Diverse population subgroups are deficient in Vitamin D including Arab 
women and lactose intolerant individuals who consume less vitamin D from fortified 
products5.  In a [LOCATION_011] hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 25% of healthy students, physicians, and residents were 
found to be vitamin D –deficient, despi[INVESTIGATOR_336786] a glass of milk and taking a multivitamin 
daily and eating salmon at least once a week6. By [CONTACT_336815], it has been estimated 
that 42% of [ADDRESS_416135]  25-
hydroxyvitamin D levels below 20 ng per milliliter.  The implications of this are far -reaching .  
In addition to well -known impacts on bone health, vitamin D status is thought to potentially 
influence  a number of common diseases, including cancers, autoi mmune disorders, and 
cardiovascular disease. Vitamin D deficiency may increase  the risk of injury from falls as 
people  age7, while early in life Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with increased risk 
of Type 1 diabetes8,9.  Other patient p opulations at increased risk for vitamin D insufficiency 
include individuals with fat malabsorption, chronic kidney disease , or obesity10,11,12 .  
  
The Endocrine Society defines v itamin D deficiency as a 25(OH)D of 20 ng/ml (50 
nmol/liter)  or below , and vitamin D insuf ficiency as a 25(OH)D of 21 –29 ng/ml (525 –725 
nmol/liter)13.  They recommend measuring vitamin D using  the serum circulating 25 -
hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D).  The Institute  of Medicine  reports that persons are potentially 
at risk for inadequacy at serum 25OHD  levels between 12 and 20 ng/mL (30 and 50 
nmol/L)14. In sun -rich environments, normal levels have been estimated to be  54-90 ng /ml15. 
Although it is not known what the safe upper value for 25(O H)D is for avoiding 
hypercalce mia, most studies in children and adults have suggested that the blood levels need 
to be above 150 ng/ml before any concern  arises16. 
 
Of all of the forms of vitamin D, cholecalciferol ( Vitamin D3 ) has been viewed as having the 
best overall combination of safety and efficacy, assuming norma l kidney and liver function.  
In the US, cholecalciferol has primarily been available as an oral supplement at fairly low 
doses (most commonly 1000 – 2000 IU).   In otherwise healthy patients , a common US 
standard of care for treatment of low serum vitamin  D  is to give 50,00 0 IU Vitamin D orally 
per week for four weeks ( total dose 200,000 IU) until levels are brought up into the adequate 
University of Minnesota  
Protocol VITD -[ADDRESS_416136] been documented18. Recently Vieth’s 
team condu cted a study with oral cholecalciferol in 48 elderly women (81 ± 8 years)19.  The 
study tested oral cholecalciferol  (D3)  up to 45,000 IU once every 28 days.  The study showed 
that a single oral dose of 45,000 IU  dissolved in alcohol generally produced a r ise in serum 
vitamin D of about 10 ng/ml.  A second oral dose 28 days later further increased the serum 
vitamin D level by [CONTACT_336816] 10 ng/ml.  Thus, the total increase after two oral doses 
(90,000 IU) was about 20 ng/ml.   Although f ollowing oral dosing , rises in serum Vit D can 
be seen up to one month following administration, Vieth’s study  demonstrate d that most of 
the rise (>60%) in Vitamin D  occurs within 7 days . (Figure 1) . No one receiving oral 
monthly dosing of 45,[ADDRESS_416137] Development

5.2 Study  Rationale and Selection of Dose  
5.2.1 Rationale for Study  
The purpose of this in vestigation is to demonstrate that a novel topi[INVESTIGATOR_26445] D3 
(cholecalciferol) gel is bioavailable to the systemic circulation and in sufficient quantities to 
treat hypov itaminosis D. In Phase Ia , healthy volunteers will be dosed with a topi[INVESTIGATOR_336789] [ADDRESS_416138] vi tamin D levels of  ≥ 10 ng/m l and <20 ng/ml is three 
doses of 100,000 IU of Vitamin D3 given intramuscularly one week apart20. For values ≤ 
10ng/ml four doses of 100,000 IU are administered.  An observational study of this common  
French  protocol by [CONTACT_336817] 204 pati ents receiving 3-4 doses of 100,000 IU 
Vitamin D3 weekly for vitamin deficiency (Groups 1 and 2)21.  Rouillon found t he protocol 
to be safe with no epi[INVESTIGATOR_336790] . Two patients from the total of 257 studied 
developed Vitamin D levels over 90 ng/m l (one 92 mg/ml and one 94 ng/ml) , with both 
resolving within one month.   .  
     
The proposed study  will use a topi[INVESTIGATOR_336791] D which is unlikely to be as 
completely absorbed as intramuscular injection.  Furthermore, topi[INVESTIGATOR_336791] 
D provides important additional physiologic mechanisms that reduce the potential for 
possible hypervitaminosis . Upon exposure to UVB radiation, previtamin D3 is synthesized 
from 7 -DHC in the stratum basale and stratum spi[INVESTIGATOR_336792]. Previtamin 
D3 thermoisomerizes to vitamin D3  with heat or sunlight exposure at the ultraviolet region  of 
the solar spectrum around 316-330 nm  22.  Vitamin D3  is then available for binding with a 
vitamin D binding protein (DBP) and transported into the  circulation23. In the skin, the  DBP 
acts as a regulatory mechanism preventing over absorption of Vitamin D into the circulation  
by [CONTACT_1541]  a threshold when  the binding protein has been  fully occupi[INVESTIGATOR_530].  Upon exposure 
to sunlight, vitamin D3 itself is rapi [INVESTIGATOR_336793], including 5,6 -trans -
vitamin D3, suprasterol I, and suprasterol II  24.  Although winter sunlight is not strong 
enough to  produce vitamin D3 in the skin , it is strong enough to promote the 
photodestruction of existing vita min D  24.  Neither binding with  DBP  nor other serum 
components prevent photodestruction .).  
 
In the process of normal physiologic production, p revitamin D3 can isomerize in a reversible 
reaction to form the photoproducts, tachysterol -3 or lumisterol -3.  These isomers do not 
enhance intestinal calcium absorption  and do not significantly enter the circulation .  The 
inactive m etabolic products  are sloughed off when skin cells are naturally shed.  Removal of 
previtamin D3 provides  a mechanism to prevent vitamin D toxic ity from prolonged sun

Protocol VITD -001  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_237949] D in Vitamin D Deficiency  
exposure25, and may further  increase the potential safety of topi[INVESTIGATOR_237949] D3  
administration .  The Mayo Clinic reports that Vitamin D is ‘likely’ safe when applied to the 
skin12.

subjects with diabetes to more closely monitor glucose values during the course of the study.  
 
Parathyroid hormone will be measured at baseline and on Day 21 to determine if vitamin D 
correction changes the level of this metaboli c calcium regulatory hormone.    
 
 
13.2 Reporting of Safety Information  
13.2.1  Definition of an Adverse Event (AE)  
Any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject, temporarily associated 
with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considere d related to the medicinal 
product.  
Examples of an AE include:  
 Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition  
 A new condition detected or diagnosed after investig ational product administration 
even though it may have been present prior to the start of the study  
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction  
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either 
investigati onal product or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be 
reported as an AE/SAE)  
Examples of an AE do not include:  
 Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE  
 Situations whe re an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], such as for PK sampling convenience)  
In this study, AEs may include pre - or post -treatment events that occur as a result of 
protocol -mandated procedures (i.e. , invasive procedures, modification of a subject ’s previous 
therapeutic regimen).  
13.2.2  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
University of Minnesota  
Protocol VITD -001  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_237949] D in Vitamin D Deficiency  
a. results in death  
b. is life -threatening  
Note: The term ‘life -threatening ’ in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event in which 
the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event, 
which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
c. requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_336801]: In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_336802] (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12332]/or treatment that would not have been a ppropriate in the physician’s office or out -
subject setting.  Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_336803].  If a 
complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_336804], the event is 
serious.  When in doubt as to whether ‘h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_18543]’ occurred or was necessary, the 
AE should be considered serious.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_336805] a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE.  
d. results in disability/incapacity  
Note: The term di sability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively 
minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea , 
influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent 
everyday life functions, but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
e. is a congen ital abnormality / birth defect  
f. any event deemed by [CONTACT_336825] a signific ant medical event.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18543], bu t may jeopardi ze the subject or may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
above definition.  These should also be considered serious.  Examples of such events are 
invasive or malignant cancers, intensiv e treatment in an emergency room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18543], 
or development of drug dependency or abuse.    
13.2.3  Recording of AEs and SAEs  
When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsib ility of the Investigator  to review all 
documentation (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory, and diagnostic reports) relative to 
the event. The Investigator  will then record all relevant information regarding an AE/SAE 
into the CRF.   
For each AE, sta rt and stop dates, action taken, outcome, intensity (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) and 
relationship to study product (causality) (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) must be documented.  I f an 
AE changes in frequency or intensity during a study, a new entry of the event must be made 
in the CRF.  
University of Minnesota  
Protocol VITD -001  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_237949] D in Vitamin D Deficiency  
The Investigator  will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, 
and/or other clinical information.  In the absence of a diagnosis, the individual 
signs/symptoms should be documented.  
All details of any treatments initiated because of the AE should be recorded in the subject’s 
notes and the CRF.  
All AEs and SAEs will be followed until resolution, until the condition stabil izes, until the 
event is otherwise explained, or until the subject is lost to follow -up.  Once resolved, the 
appropriate AE/SAE CRF page(s) will be updated.  The Investigator will ensure that follow -
up includes any supplemental investigations as may be ind icated to elucidate the nature 
and/or causality of the AE or SAE.  This may include additional laboratory tests or 
investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care 
professionals.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Intensity  
The Investigat or will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during 
the study.  The assessment will be based on the Investigator’s clinical judgment.  Adverse 
events from the first dose of topi[INVESTIGATOR_26445] D gel will be assesed  based on this general  
guideline:  
 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated  
 Moderate; minimal, local or non -invasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental activities of daily  
 Severe or med ically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12342]; disabling; limiting self care activities of 
daily living  
 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
 Death related to AE   
Severity should not be confused with an SAE.  Severity is a category utili zed for rating the 
intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.  An event is defined 
as “serious” when it meets one of the pre -defined outcomes as descri bed in Section 13.2.2  
“Definition of an SAE.”  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Causality  
The Investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between investigational product and 
the occurrence of each AE/SAE.  The Investigator  will use clinical judgment to determine the 
relationship.  Alternative causes, such as natural history of the underlying diseases, 
concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the 
investigational product will be c onsidered and investigated.   
The causal relationship to the study product assessed by [CONTACT_737] (or medically 
qualified delegate) should be assessed using the following classifications:  
Not Related  In the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], there is not a caus al relationship between the 
study product and the AE.  
University of Minnesota  
Protocol VITD -[ADDRESS_416165]’s clinical state or the 
study product.  
Probable  The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of study 
product administration, abates upon discontinuation of the study product and 
cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_336826]’s clinical state.  
Definitely  The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of study 
product administration or reappears when study product is reintroduced.  
The causality assessment is one of the criteria u sed when determining regulatory reporting 
requirements.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Expectedness  
Expected  An adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is consistent with the 
applicable product information (e.g., Investigators’ Brochure for an  
unapproved medicina l product).  
Unexpected  An adverse reaction, the nature or sever ity of which is not consistent with 
information in the relevant source document (e.g., Investigators’  Brochure for 
an unapproved medicinal product).  
13.2.[ADDRESS_416166], 
he/she will assess the event and determine if it meets regulatory reporting requirements.  The 
Investigator must also notify the reviewing Investigational Review Board (IRB)  and site 
governance of fice (if required) of any SAEs acco rding the guidelines of the IRB.

14. DATA ANALYSIS AND STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
Data for this study will be entered into a REDCap database, which uses a MySQL database 
via a secure web interface with data checks used during  data entry to ensure data quality. 
REDCap includes a complete suite of features to support HIPAA compliance, including a full 
audit trail, user -based privileges, and integration with the institutional LDAP server. The 
MySQL database and the web server wil l both be housed on secure servers operated by [CONTACT_146092]’s Information Systems group (AHC -IS). 
The servers are in a physically secure location on campus and are backed up nightly, with the 
backups stored in accordan ce with the AHC -IS retention schedule of daily, weekly, and 
monthly tapes retained for 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months, respectively. Weekly backup 
tapes are stored offsite. The AHC -IS servers provide a stable, secure, well -maintained, and 
high-capacity da ta storage environment, and both REDCap and MySQL are widely -used, 
powerful, reliable, well -supported systems. Access to the study's data in REDCap will be 
restricted to the members of the study team by [CONTACT_125698].  
The general analytical approac h for all endpoints will be descriptive in nature. No formal 
statistical hypothesis testing will be conducted. No p -values will be presented due to the 
small sample size of this study. Data analyses wil l be provided  for all study subjects 
combined wherever  appropriate.   
For continuous variables, summary statistics will include number of subjects, mean, median, 
standard deviation, minimum, and maximum.  For categorical variables, descriptive statistics 
will include number of subjects  and percentages.  
In regards to handling of missing data, there will be no imputation of missing values.  
14.1 Analysis  Populations  
Safety Population :  all subjects who receive at least [ADDRESS_416167] -dosing safety evaluation.  All safety endpoints , baseline characteristics, and 
demographic data will be summarized using the Safety Population.  
Efficacy Evaluable Population :  all subjects who receive all [ADDRESS_416168] any skin rash and/or other skin reaction following 
treatment with the vitamin D gel. 
University of Minnesota  
Protocol VITD -[ADDRESS_416169] Disposition  
The number and percentage of subjects entering and discontinuing the clin ical study will be 
presented .  The reasons for discontinuation will also be summarized.  
14.3.2  Demography and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline chara cteristics will be descript ively summarized  using the Safety 
Population.  Quantitative and/or categorical summaries will  be presented for demographics 
and other basel ine characteristics.

dose received per cycle) .  The reason(s) for dose(s) missed  will also be summarized.  
14.3.[ADDRESS_416171] descriptive statistics.   
Adverse event terms will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) and will be summarized by [CONTACT_2715].  Incidence of AEs occurring during the study 
will be summar ized by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term.  Adverse events will 
also be summarized by [CONTACT_336827].  Serious adverse events and AEs leading to 
discontinuation of study treatment will be listed separately.   
Additional analyses will be perf ormed if warranted upon review of the data.  
14.3.5  Analysis of Efficacy  
The primary outcome will be the change in total Vitamin D following the topi[INVESTIGATOR_336806] 100,000IU Vitamin D3 weekly for three weeks.    
14.4 Determination of Sample Size  
A change from basel ine of 10 µg/L in total [ADDRESS_416172] measures of total 25 -OH Vitamin D is 4 μg/L, then the standard 
deviation of the difference is 5.6  μg/L  so [ADDRESS_416173] 
size of 6.4  μg/L with alpha of .05 and a power of 90%.  However the standard deviation of 
the second measure is unknown since absorption may vary by [CONTACT_29569].  Assu ming  the 
standard deviation of the second measure increases to 12, then [ADDRESS_416174] size of 10  μg/L.  In order to be most conservative, [ADDRESS_416175] in Human Research ( 2007 ) and the Notes for Guidance on 
Good Clinical Practice as adopted by [CONTACT_336828]

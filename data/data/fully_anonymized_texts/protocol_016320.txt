Study Title 
Multi-arm Optimization of Stroke Thrombolysis (MOST) Stroke Trial 
Objectives 
The primary efficacy objective of the MOST trial is to determine if argatroban (100µg/kg bolus followed by 
3µg/kg per minute for 12 hours) or eptifibatide (135µg/kg bolus followed by 0.75µg/kg/min infusion for two 
hours) results in improved 90-day modified Rankin scores (mRS) as compared with placebo in acute ischemic 
stroke (AIS) patients treated with standard of care thrombolysis (0.9mg/kg IV rt-PA or 0.25mg/kg IV 
tenecteplase or TNK) within three hours of symptom onset. Patients may also receive endovascular 
thrombectomy (ET) per usual care. Time of onset is defined as the last time the patient was last known to be 
well. 
The primary safety objective of the MOST trial is to determine the safety of argatroban and eptifibatide in 
combination with IV rt-PA or TNK with or without ET per usual care, where safety is measured by 
[CONTACT_470968] (sICH) within [ADDRESS_603449] 150 subjects will be randomized 1:1:1. From 150-500 patients, 
response adaptive randomization (RAR) will favor the treatment arm showing the greatest benefit based on 
accrued data. After [ADDRESS_603450]- 
is sICH. Secondary outcomes include a comparison between treatment groups of: the proportion of 
-hour NIHSS; proportion with 90-day mRS 
0 or 1 and 0- 2; 90-day ordinal analysis of the mRS; 90-day EQ-5D; the proportion of participants who have 
thrombectomy; the proportion of participants with parenchymal hemorrhage types 1 (PH-1) and 2 (PH-2); any 
ICH on brain imaging within 36 hours of randomization; major hemorrhage (defined as requiring >2 units 
packed red blood cells) other than intracranial hemorrhage within 7 days; 90-day all-cause mortality; 
evaluation of treatment effect in rt-PA and TNK subjects; evaluation of treatment effect in ET and non-ET 
subjects; and, evaluation of race/ethnicity and gender differences in treatment effect. 
Interventions and Duration 
After thrombolysis is started in eligible ischemic stroke patients, the patient or legally authorized representative 
(LAR) will be approached for participation in the study and consent obtained in eligible patients. Placebo, 
argatroban or eptifibatide will be started as soon as possible after consent is obtained. Participants should 
receive assigned study drug within 60 minutes of initiation of IV thrombolysis, but administration is allowed up 
to 75 minutes. A repeat NIH stroke scale will be performed at 24 (+/- 12) hours after initiation of thrombolysis. 
The primary safety outcome will be measured by [CONTACT_470969] [ADDRESS_603451]. Functional outcome at 90 days, 
the primary efficacy outcome, will be assessed by [CONTACT_470970]/or LAR. 
Sample size and Power 
With a maximum N=1200, the design provides at least 80% power to detect the specified treatment effect (0.4 
utilities) when only one active arm is effective. If both treatment arms are equally effective, power is 89%. 
MOST Stroke Trial Protocol 
                                      [ADDRESS_603452] trial is to determine if argatroban (100µg/kg bolus followed by 
3µg/kg per minute for 12 hours) or eptifibatide (135µg/kg bolus followed by 0.75µg/kg/min infusion for two 
hours) results in improved 90-day modified Rankin scores (mRS) as compared with placebo in acute ischemic 
stroke (AIS) patients treated with standard of care 0.9mg/kg IV rt-PA or 0.25mg/kg IV TNK within three hours of 
symptom onset. Patients may also receive endovascular thrombectomy (ET) per usual care. 
 
The primary safety objective of the MOST trial is to determine the safety of argatroban and eptifibatide in 
combination with IV thrombolysis with or without ET per usual care, where safety is measured by 
[CONTACT_470968] (sICH) within 36 hours from randomization. 
 
1.2 Secondary Objective 
Secondary objectives include a comparison between treatment groups of: the proportion of participants with 
-hour NIHSS; proportion with 90-day mRS 0 or 1 and 0-2; 
90-day ordinal analysis of the mRS; 90-day EuroQol (EQ-5D), a self-administered questionnaire that is widely 
used to obtain utility values to derive quality-adjusted life years (QALY) for a given intervention; the proportion 
of participants who have thrombectomy; the proportion of participants with parenchymal hemorrhage types 1 
(PH-1) and 2 (PH-2); any ICH on brain imaging within 36 hours of randomization; major hemorrhage (defined as 
requiring >2 units packed red blood cells) other than intracranial hemorrhage within 7 days; 90-day all-cause 
mortality; evaluation of treatment effect in rt-PA and TNK subjects; evaluation of treatment effect in ET and non-
ET subjects; and, evaluation of race/ethnicity and gender differences in treatment effect. 
 
2 BACKGROUND 
 
2.1 Rationale 
Intravenous (IV) thrombolysis is the only proven effective medication for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke 
(AIS). The aim of thrombolysis is recanalization and this occurs in ~50% of occluded arteries one hour after 
treatment. Arterial reocclusion occurs in 14-34% of thrombolysis treated patients within two hours and is 
associated with worse outcome. Overall, 50% of thrombolysis treated AIS patients are disabled at three months, 
likely owing to poor recanalization, reocclusion, or permanent neurological injury occurring before 
recanalization.1-7 
 
Addition of endovascular thrombectomy (ET) to thrombolysis is a recent major advance for AIS patients with 
large vessel occlusions (LVO), further supporting the impact of recanalization on outcome.8-12 However, only 46% 
of ET treated patients in published trials achieved functional independence (mRS 0-2) at 90 days13,14; 31% did 
not achieve good recanalization13,14; 25% had persistent occlusion at 24 hours8; and, only 7% of [LOCATION_002] 
(US) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_470948].15 Thus, there is an unmet clinical need for adjunctive IV medications that could be 
administered at all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] (small and large) that treat patients with IV thrombolysis to augment thrombolysis 
andreperfusion. 
 
Thrombus formation and propagation are complex processes initiated by [CONTACT_470971]/or tissue factor at 
the site of vascular injury. Recruitment and activation of platelets, platelet aggregation and cross- linking with 
fibrin(ogen) mediated by [CONTACT_470972] (GP) 2b/3a receptor ensue, generating thrombin and fibrin. Thrombin 
further propagates platelet activation and aggregation in a positive feedback loop.[ADDRESS_603453] thrombin inhibition with argatroban and 
inhibition of the GP2b/3a receptor with eptifibatide. 
 
Direct Thrombin Inhibition with Argatroban Augments Thrombolysis 
Argatroban is a derivative of arginine that competitively binds to the active site of thrombin thereby [CONTACT_470973] 
                                      [ADDRESS_603454] after IV 
administration which is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_470949].19 In murine models of middle cerebral 
artery (MCA) occlusion, argatroban reduced the formation of microthrombi, reduced lesion volume, and, when 
combined with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), reduced fibrin deposition and extended the time-
window for rt-PA.20,21 A randomized controlled trial of single agent IV argatroban within 48 hours of stroke symptom 
onset at 60mg/day for two days and 10mg twice a day for five days resulted in improved symptoms and daily 
activities in the argatroban group.22 A randomized placebo controlled safety study in 171 AIS patients found that 
high dose (100µg/kg bolus followed by 3µg/kg/minute, n=59) and low dose (100µg/kg bolus followed by 
1µg/kg/minute, n=58) argatroban were safe when started within 12 hours of symptom onset and did not increase 
sICH rates (high- dose argatroban 5.1%; low-dose argatroban 3.4%; placebo 0%).23 Based on these data, we 
conducted the Argatroban t-PA Stroke Study (ARTSS), ARTSS-[ADDRESS_603455] with no safety concerns of argatroban plus rt-PA for AIS. 
 
Inhibition of the GP 2b/3a Receptor with Eptifibatide Augments Thrombolysis 
The final step of platelet aggregation is mediated via the GP2b/3a receptor.[ADDRESS_603456] investigated several GP2b/3a inhibitors combined with rt-PA and found that addition of GP2b/3a 
inhibitors to rt-PA prevented microvascular platelet aggregation, increased recanalization rates compared to rt- 
PA alone (50% vs. 20%) and reduced infarct volume by 25%.24-26 Eptifibatide was specifically developed to 
ensure rapid inhibition of platelet aggregation (within 15 minutes), a short half-life (~2 hours) and rapid 
dissociation from platelets with 50% restoration of platelet function within 2-4 hours of discontinuation.17 In 
myocardial infarction, addition of eptifibatide to rt-PA increased TIMI grade 3 flow (66% vs. 39%, P=.006)27 and 
reduced coronary events without increasing the rates of bleeding complications compared to rt-PA alone.28,29 
Based on these data, we conducted the Combined Approach to Lysis Utilizing Eptifibatide and rt-PA in Acute 
Ischemic Stroke (CLEAR), CLEAR-Enhanced Regimen (CLEAR-ER) and CLEAR-Full Dose Regimen (CLEAR- 
FDR) trials which found a favorable direction of effect with no safety concerns.

The ARTSS Trial  Low Dose Argatroban + Standard rt-PA is Safe and Promising 
This single arm study of [ADDRESS_603458] dose rt-PA with 100µg/kg bolus of argatroban followed 
by a 48-hour infusion targeting a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 1.75 x baseline. The mean ± SD age for 
ARTSS patients was 63 ± 14 years and the median (range) NIH stroke scale score (NIHSS) was 13 (3-25). 
The endpoints were sICH and recanalization rates. sICH rate was 4.6% and 78% achieved partial or complete 
recanalization at [ADDRESS_603459] rt-PA was measured using validated and 
centrally adjudicated transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound waveforms.[ADDRESS_603460] study18 that 
included a control arm (rt-PA alone) to allow comparison of 2-hour recanalization. Complete recanalization at 2 
hours occurred in 30% of argatroban + rt-PA patients compared to 13% rt-PA alone. 
 
The ARTSS-2 Trial  Higher Dose Argatroban + Standard IV rt-PA is Safe and Promising 
This Phase 2 randomized controlled clinical trial was designed to estimate overall treatment benefit among 
stroke patients treated with rt-PA who are randomized to either low dose argatroban (100µg/kg bolus, followed

([LOCATION_006]) centers. Characteristics of enrolled patients are shown in Table 2. More argatroban patients reached mRS 
of 0-1 at 90 days as shown in Figure 1a and a trend in favor of improved outcomes in the high dose argatroban 
arm is shown in Figure 1b along with similar sICH.31Relative risks were adjusted for clinical site, terminal ICA 
occlusion, and Hemorrhage After Thrombolysis (HAT) score37which includes NIHSS, glucose and CT 
hypodensity. The equivalent difference in the utility score in favor of the high dose argatroban combination arm 
would be 1.0 (-0.9, 2.8).

The ARTSS-IA Trial rt-PA + Argatroban + ET is Safe
This proof-of-concept, single-arm, feasibility and safety study (ARTSS-IA; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) assessed the MOST 
high dose argatroban regimen in AIS patients who receive IV rt-PA and ET. Ten patients were enrolled.
Median age was 68 years (range 52-92) and median NIHSS was 19.5. All 10 patients received 12 hours of 
argatroban infusion and none suffered sICH or procedural complications. Study procedures did not prolong ET 
time metrics (i.e., imaging to groin-puncture) compared with non-ARTSS-IA ET cases.32
The CLEAR Trial Half Dose rt-PA + Eptifibatide is Safe
This randomized dose escalation study showed that eptifibatide (75µg/kg bolus followed by 0.75µg/kg/min 
infusion for 2 hours) could be safely combined with 0.3mg/kg or 0.45mg/kg of rt-PA administered within three 
hours of symptom onset in AIS. sICH rate was 1% with no signal of efficacy as compared to IV rt-PA alone.33
The CLEAR-ER Trial 0.6mg/kg rt-PA + Eptifibatide is Safe and Promising
CLEAR-ER randomized 126 AIS patients treated with rt-PA within three hours to 0.6mg/kg rt-PA plus 
eptifibatide (135µg/kg bolus and a 2-hour infusion at 0.75µg/kg/min) (n=101) vs standard rt-PA (0.9mg/kg) 
(n=25). Combination arm patients were non-significantly younger (72 vs 76 year, P=0.63), had lower NIHSS (12 
vs 17, P=0.11) and had shorter times to IV rt-PA (113 vs 129 minutes, P=0.69). The age, NIHSS and time- to-IV 
rt-PA adjusted odds ratio was 1.38 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.51-3.76; P=0.52) in favor of rt-PA
+eptifibatide.34The sICH rate was 2%.34
Due to imbalances in the treatment and controlarms of CLEAR-      
ER, we also matched 85 CLEAR-ER to169 contemporaneous IMS
III/ALIAS rt-PA only subjects using a propensityscore matching approach.38                
The primary outcome was 90-day severity-adjustedmRS
dichotomization based on baseline NIHSS.39Medianagein CLEAR-ER
and control subjects was 68 years; median NIHSSin the CLEAR-ER
subjects was 11 and in control subjects 12. At 90 days,45% of CLEAR-ER

                                      5  v6.3 2023-03-06 subjects had favorable outcomes vs 36% in controls (unadjusted RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.91-1.69, p=0.18) (Figure 2). 
Secondary outcomes were 52% vs 34% excellent outcomes (mRS 0-1) (RR 1.51, 1.13-2.02, p=0.007); 60% 
vs 53% favorable outcome (mRS 0-2) (RR 1.13, 0.90-1.41, p=0.31); and ordinal Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel 
p=0.10.38 The equivalent difference in the utility score in favor of the eptifibatide combination would be 0.43 (- 
0.37, 1.24). 
 
The CLEAR-FDR Trial  Standard rt-PA + Eptifibatide is Safe and Promising 
This was a single arm safety study of standard dose (0.9mg/kg) rt-PA plus eptifibatide. The primary goal was to 
ensure with high probability (defined as 80%) that the rate of sICH does not exceed 8%, the expected sICH 
rate based on patients from the NINDS trial who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria for the CLEAR trials. The 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_470950]-FDR trial was [ADDRESS_603461] 19 patients enrolled or 4 out of 29 
patients enrolled. With a sample size of 30, a two-sided 95% confidence interval for a rate of 8% would be 0% 
to 18%. Twenty seven AIS patients were enrolled. Median age was 73 years (range 34-85) and median NIHSS 
was 12 (range 6-26). One sICH (3.7%, 95%CI 0.7%-18%) occurred.[ADDRESS_603462] subjects had a 
nonsignificant greater proportion of patients with a favorable primary outcome (61% versus 38%; RR 1.59; 
95% CI 0.96-2.63; P=0.10). Secondary outcomes also favored CLEAR FDR subjects: mRS 0-1 67% versus 
38% (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.08-2.79; P=0.04); mRS 0-2 67% versus 58% (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.77-1.73; P=0.50); 
and ordinal Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel, P=0.13. The equivalent difference in the utility score in favor of the 
eptifibatide combination would be 1.14 (-0.55, 2.83). 
 
2.[ADDRESS_603463] of Care Intravenous Thrombolysis  rt-PA or TNK 
Treatment with IV rt-PA is an FDA approved medication for AIS. Emerging data on tenecteplase (TNK) 
has led to its adoption as standard practice globally and in the [LOCATION_002]. rt-PA is administered as a 
bolus followed by [CONTACT_470974], a variant of rt-PA, is a single bolus. rt-PA is cleared from 
the plasma with an initial half-life of 5 minutes, while the terminal half-life is 72 minutes. TNK is cleared 
from plasma with an initial half-life of 20 to 24 minutes, while the terminal half-life is 90 to 130 minutes.40 
 
A meta-analysis of five randomized trials involving 1,585 patients demonstrated non-inferiority of TNK to 
rt-PA.41 The American Stroke Association treatment guidelines indicate it may be reasonable to use TNK 
0.25mg/kg as an alternative to alteplase in cases of patients with large vessel occlusion and more severe 
strokes undergoing thrombectomy (AHA Class 2b, Level of Evidence B-R).[ADDRESS_603464] of care instead of rt-PA in all AIS 
patients.43 Additionally, the Canadian Alteplase compared to Tenecteplase (AcT) trial involving [ADDRESS_603465] trial, 0.25mg/kg TNK or 
0.9mg/kg rt-PA within three hours of AIS symptom onset will be allowed as standard of care thrombolysis 
per local practice at performance sites. 
 
TNK is Non-inferior with Similar Safety as rt-PA in AIS 
Forest plots from the meta-analysis by [CONTACT_470975]41 below indicate non-inferiority/no difference in 
functional outcomes, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage or mortality between rt-PA and TNK.

Safety of Combining TNK with Argatroban or Eptifibatide in AIS 
The existing preliminary data and Phase II trials support safety of the combination of rt-PA with the study 
interventions. Given the similarity in the safety profile of TNK and rt-PA in AIS, we do not expect safety 
concerns by [CONTACT_470977]. However, there is limited data available. The 
safety plan for MOST allows controlled monitoring of subjects after every 30 enrollments. Specifically, 
within the TNK and rt-TPA subgroups, sICH rates by [CONTACT_470978]. The 
probability that observed sICH rates are higher than the expected 3% in any given combination arm will 
be estimated and DSMB recommendations will be followed. A 95% probability that the rate in an 
intervention arm or subgroup exceeds an expected rate triggers DSMB review. After review of data from 
every [ADDRESS_603469] trial is a multi-arm, adaptive, single blinded, randomized controlled Phase 3 clinical trial conducted 
at up to 110 sites to determine whether argatroban and/or eptifibatide is superior to placebo in improving 90-
day modified Rankin scores (mRS) in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients treated with IV rt-PA (0.9mg/kg) or 
TNK (0.25mg/kg) within three hours of symptom onset. We will also assess the safety of the combination 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. A schematic of study activities is illustrated below.

has been shown to have good agreement with face-to-face mRS (weighted kappa 0.82, 95% CI 0.77-0.88).52,53 
The Day 90 mRS should be conducted by [CONTACT_470979]-to-face interviews. If this is not possible, a 
recorded remote assessment by [CONTACT_470980]. The Day 30 and Day 90 mRS score will be 
assigned by [CONTACT_470981]. A blinded central assessor will assign Day 90 mRS from video recordings 
performed by [CONTACT_470982]. The central mRS assignment will be used for the primary outcome assessment. 
Central mRS assessments will be recorded on videos which will be uploaded to a secure server where they will 
be checked, stored and distributed for independent scoring by [CONTACT_470983], with committee discussion as 
appropriate. 
 
3.3 Imaging Acquisition and Analysis 
Imaging protocols: Heterogeneity of varying scanner capabilities and changing scanners at the participating 
sites is expected in multicenter imaging trials. Hence, absolute standardization is difficult. The imaging obtained 
will be standard of care and require that the imaging protocols at the enrolling sites are based on the Stroke 
Imaging Research (STIR) consortium recommendations, which have been designed to accommodate different 
makes of scanners.54 This will increase the homogeneity of the imaging studies obtained at the different sites, 
and the central review will further ensure that the imaging biomarkers used in this study are comparable from 
site to site. 
 
Imaging analysis: To protect confidentiality and prevent bias, all imaging data will be transmitted via a secure 
platform to the study neuroradiologist for central interpretation of: (1) Baseline non-contrast CT- Acute ischemia 
defined by [CONTACT_470984], (2) Baseline vascular imaging CTA/MRA- LVO (defined as intracranial ICA, MCA-
M1 or basilar occlusion) and (3) 12-[ADDRESS_603478] score for all randomized subjects, the presence of LVO (yes or no) 
at baseline for patients undergoing ET, and presence of ICH, PH-1, and PH-[ADDRESS_603479] is the proportion of PH-2 ICH as this is used to define the primary safety outcome which will 
be adjusted for by [CONTACT_470985]. At the end of the trial, the proportion of subjects with any ICH 
and the proportion who develop PH-1 and PH2 will be reported by [CONTACT_1570]. Other imaging data (e.g., M2 
occlusions or collateral scores) will be noted and included in exploratory analyses separate from the aims of the 
present proposal. 
 
3.4 Manual of Procedures 
The Manual of Procedures will be a document containing detailed instructions on the recruitment process, 
study procedures and data collection. The document should be used by [CONTACT_470986]. Revisions to the manual will be made as necessary.

evaluates the treatment arm distribution and generates a randomization number based on the randomization 
scheme. The randomization number corresponds to one of the study drug kits in inventory at the clinical site. A 
web-based central randomization system will be developed by [CONTACT_470987] 
 
 
A screen failure log will be maintained by [CONTACT_470988]. 
 
4.[ADDRESS_603486] will be comprised of up to 110 enrolling sites in the [LOCATION_002] and Canada. 
 
5 STUDY INTERVENTIONS 
 
5.1 Interventions, Administration and Duration 
The study intervention will be one time administration of argatroban (100µg/kg bolus followed by 3µg/kg per 
minute for 12 hours) or eptifibatide (135µg/kg bolus followed by 0.75µg/kg/min infusion for two hours) or 
placebo. We anticipate subjects will be treated in the emergency department (ED) after presentation with AIS. 
Argatroban, eptifibatide, or placebo will be administered within [ADDRESS_603487] be stopped at 12 hours from the initial bolus of study medication regardless of interruptions to 
the infusion. Participants will be monitored closely in the intensive care unit (ICU) and monitored for neurological 
deterioration secondary to sICH. In-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_470954], including indications for ET, will be per American 
Stroke Association (ASA) or Canadian Stroke Best Practice Recommendations (CSBPR) treatment 
guidelines.55,[ADDRESS_603488] into study drug kits and ship to Clinical 
Performing Sites in the [LOCATION_002] for study use.  
The Research Pharmacy at the University of Calgary will assemble commercially available argatroban and 
eptifibatide into study drug kits and ship to Clinical Performing Sites in Canada for study use.  
 
5.2.1 Blinding 
Argatroban and placebo subjects will initially receive a bolus followed by a 12-hour infusion. Eptifibatide arm 
subjects will receive a bolus followed by a 2-hour infusion. A 10-hour saline infusion will be administered after 
the 2-hour eptifibatide infusion to maintain the single blind. Investigators are unblinded to treatment arms, but 
subjects and LARs are blinded throughout the duration of the trial.  
The two primary concerns of lack of blinding are: 1) knowledge of the treatment arm could bias endpoint 
assessments of safety (sICH) or efficacy (mRS at 90 days); and, 2) knowledge of an active treatment could 
influence the decision of investigators to proceed with ET in some participants, although we believe this is  
unlikely. Centralized blinded adjudication of sICH, and centralized blinded 90-day mRS assessments will mitigate 
the first concern, and requiring a clinical decision regarding a plan to proceed to ET prior to randomization will 
mitigate the second concern. A schematic of the blinding process for MOST is shown in Figure 7.  
 
 
 
Once a patient is randomized, the study team member will retrieve the study drug kit from site inventory 
labeled with the randomization number assigned by [CONTACT_470989]. The study kit will contain saline placebo, 
argatroban or eptifibatide sufficient for administration to the maximum dosing weight of 100kg.

Screening 
A history, physical examination, and NIH stroke scale will be performed by [CONTACT_470990], and 
intravenous thrombolysis will be started per usual care in eligible patients. Thrombolysis is to be started as 
soon as possible in the ED, and delays in initiating therapy are to be avoided. For patients eligible for ET, 
rapid transport to ET should be initiated and facilitated prior to engaging in discussions regarding the study.

Best Practice Recommendations (CSBPR) guidelines.55,57,[ADDRESS_603496] likely reasons for discontinuing the intervention after enrollment are acute neurological deterioration 
possibly secondary to sICH during the infusion, and refractory hypertension (blood pressure cannot be 
maintained below 180/105mmHg despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a continuous infusion medication). In both cases, the rt-PA and/or 
study drug are to be stopped immediately. The subject should continue to be followed and data collected per 
the study protocol.

Reversal of intracranial hemorrhage is key for all treatment arms since IV thrombolysis will be administered to 
all enrolled subjects. However, the overall goal of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_470955] (see below). 
 
Management of intracranial hemorrhage 
Intracranial hemorrhage should be suspected if there is any acute neurological deterioration (new headache, 
acute hypertension, seizure, or nausea and vomiting) or acute increase in BP. 
 
If ICH is suspected: 
 Discontinue rt-PA and/or study drug infusion until ICH is ruled out 
 Immediately perform CT scan 
 Draw coagulation tests that may include INR, PT, aPTT, platelet count, fibrinogen, thromboelastography 
(TEG) and type and screen 
 If ICH is not present, re-start the rt-PA and/or study drug infusion at the discretion of the investigator

9.1 Definition of Safety Outcomes 
The following are safety outcomes of the study: 
 sICH within 36 hours from randomization 
 Proportion of participants with parenchymal hemorrhage types 1 (PH-1) and 2 (PH-2) within 36 hours of 
randomization 
 Any ICH on brain imaging within 36 hours of randomization 
 Major hemorrhage (requiring >2 units of packed red cells) other than intracranial hemorrhage within 
seven days of randomization  
 All-cause mortality within 90 days of randomization

by [CONTACT_53020]. 
 
9.2 Reporting of Adverse Events 
All adverse events (AEs), all Serious AEs, and all safety outcomes will be reported from randomization 
through Day [ADDRESS_603498]. After Day 3/Discharge, all serious AEs and all safety 
outcomes will be reported. For each reportable AE, an AE case report form (CRF) will be submitted in 
WebDCUTM capturing the details of the event including date of onset, severity, duration, and relationship to the 
treatment. For serious AEs, additional information, including narrative summaries will be submitted.  
Non-serious events are reported in WebDCUTM within 5 days of the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_470956], and serious adverse events are reported within 24 hours of the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_470957] (e.g., date of resolution, action taken). All serious AEs must be followed 
for the duration of the study follow-up or until resolution, whichever comes first. Upon completion of the study 
protocol by [CONTACT_470991], if not done earlier. 
 
If an event is determined to be unexpected (not previously observed), related to trial participation (study drug) 
and meets FDA and/or Health Canada criteria as a serious event, an expedited safety report will be submitted 
to the FDA in accordance with CFR 312.32 and to Health Canada in accordance with C.05.014.

10 STATISTICALCONSIDERATIONS
This section is an overview of the statistical considerations. Complete details can be found in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP). The general overview of the design is provided in section 3.1.
10.1 Sample Size and Accrual
The minimum clinically significant difference was defined as 0.4 points on the utility scale primary outcome, 
which corresponds to ~45% of the effect for IV rt-PA over placebo in the NINDS study (Table 4).59With a 
maximum N=1200, this design provides at least 80% power to detect a treatment effect when the overall true 
utility benefit is 0.4 for one active arm in non-ET subjects (Table 7). If both treatment arms are equally effective 
at 0.4 utility above the control arm, power is 89%. The properties of the study design have been investigated 
through a series of simulations that assumed 30% of patients receive ET, and the treatment effect for ET 
patients is 50% of the effect in non-ET patients, corresponding to 25% of the treatment effect of rt-PA over
placebo. The impact of ET on treatment effect is unknown but we assumed the worst scenario, i.e., marked 
attenuation of effect. Table 7 shows power when only one treatment arm is effective. Power increases if <30% 
of patients receive ET.
Table [ADDRESS_603499] Overall
(70% non-ET and 30% ET subjects)0.[ADDRESS_603500] for ET subjects
(50% of non-ET effect)0.15 0.20 0.25
Pr{Effective arm wins} 0.52 0.80 0.95
Pr{Other arm wins} 0.011 0.008 0.014
Numbers in gray are the utilities (difference in the expected treatment minus control).
Numbers in white are the power under 3 different scenarios (determined by [CONTACT_167889]).
Given the non-inferiority of TNK and similarity in efficacy and safety between TNK and rt-PA,41we do not 
anticipate treatment effect to be different between subjects treated with rt-PA versus TNK as standard of care 
thrombolysis. Further, our simulations included treatment effect as low as 0.[ADDRESS_603501] by [CONTACT_470992]. 
10.2 Data Analysis
10.2.1 Primary Efficacy Analysis
The primary analysis will be conducted on the intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis population, defined as all subjects 
randomized regardless of the treatment actually received. The primary analysis will be a two-sample 
comparison of each active arm compared to placebo mRS utility scores adjusting for severity (baseline 
NIHSS). If both active arms reach the end of the trial, they will each be compared to control independently.
The final analysis is Bayesian and includes a flexible normal dynamic linear model (NDLM) to account for 
different expected outcomes as a function of initial NIHSS. This is a flexible spline-like model that will capture 
that the average weighted mRS score in the control group as a (possibly non-linear) function of initial NIHSS. 
Meanwhile for a given treatment , , is the difference in the expected utility for the active treatment minus 
control. For each active arm, the hypothesis testis

The treatment effect2). Particularly, the prior probability that a drugis
beneficial is the same as the prior probability that it is harmful. If there is a high posterior probability that the 
treatment effect is positive, the treatment is declared efficacious. The posterior probability is conditional on 
the final results for all enrolled subjects. If two active arms remained in the trial all the way to the end, this 
posterior probability is computedfor each, and potentially both arms canbedeclared to be successful.
The primary output of the final analysis is the posterior probability that , for any 
trial. If this probability is at least 0.985, the trial is considered a success. The threshold for defining significance 
is chosen so that the Type I error is no larger than 0.025. Criteria for success (critical value for posterior 
probability of a positive benefit) was inflated from 0.975 to 0.985 to account for the two study drugs and the 
repeated interim looks (e.g. thetrialcan be stopped when data look favorable enough that success is likely).
10.2.2 InterimAnalyses
The interim evaluations of the primary efficacy outcome data are described in the Statistical Analysis Plan. A 
brief description is provided under section 3.1.
The primary safety outcome (sICH) proportion for each treatment group (overall and by [CONTACT_35754]/non-ET subgroups
and thrombolysis approach, i.e., TNK versus rt-PA) will be compared to the expected rate of 3%. The 
probability that the safety outcomes in an intervention arm exceeds the expected rate will be provided in each 
DSMB report. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_470958]-binding and are to be used as a guideline by [CONTACT_470993].
10.2.3 Secondary and ExploratoryAnalyses
The primary outcome of mRS utility values will be reanalyzed in a multiple linear regression adjusting for 
baseline NIHSS, age, time to IV thrombolysis, thrombolytic agent (rt-PA or TNK), location of LVO and time 
from onset to groin puncture in subjects undergoing ET. All secondary analyses will be tested at a significance 
level of two- -
dinal outcomes each active treatment arm will be compared to control 
in a Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test and ordinal logistic regression. For continuous outcomes, each active treatment 
arm will be compared to control in a two-sample t-test. Kaplan Meier curves and log rank tests will be used to 
compare time to 90-day mortality by [CONTACT_1570].
Exploratory analyses of the secondary outcomes will use either logistic regression (for binary outcomes), 
ordinal logistic regression (for categorical outcomes) or multiple linear regression (for continuous 
outcomes) to compare treatment groups after adjusting for age, baseline NIHSS, time to IV thrombolysis, 
thrombolytic agent, location of LVO and time to groin puncture in ET subjects.
10.2.4 Subgroup Analysis: Gender, Race, Ethnicity
Although we do not anticipate differential treatment effects based on gender, race, or ethnicity, our analyses 
will explore clinically important differences due to race/ethnicity. The mRS utility values will be reanalyzed in a 
multiple linear regression adjusting for baseline NIHSS including indicator variables of sex, racial group, and 
ethnic group and interaction terms with treatment group.

Coordinating Center, and the clinical sites (StrokeNet and non-StrokeNet). In addition to the study database, 
the NDMC will provide the clinical site staff access (via password) to a standard set of web-enabled tools, 
including subject visit calendar, subject accrual status, case report form completion status, and outstanding 
data queries pertaining to their respective clinical sites. 
 
11.3 Quality Assurance and Quality Control 
Data quality assurance processes at the NDMC include: 
 Logic and rule checks built into the study database; 
 Real-time, central monitoring by [CONTACT_470997]; and 
 Remote and on-site risk-based source verification monitoring by [CONTACT_470998]. 
Quality control (QC) procedures will be implemented beginning with the data entry system, and data QC 
checks that will be run on the database will be generated. Any missing data or data anomalies will be 
communicated to the site(s) for clarification/resolution. 
Following written procedures as detailed in the monitoring plan, the monitors will verify that the clinical trial is 
conducted and data are generated, documented (recorded), and reported in compliance with the protocol, 
GCP, and the applicable regulatory requirements (e.g., Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), Good Manufacturing 
Practices (GMP). 
The investigational site will provide direct access to all trial-related sites, source data/documents, and reports 
for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by [CONTACT_456], and inspection by [CONTACT_3482]. 
 
MOST Stroke Trial Protocol 
                                      [ADDRESS_603502] (IRB)/Research Ethics Board (REB) and Informed 
Consent 
[LOCATION_002] 
The University of Cincinnati Institutional Review Board will serve as the National Central Institutional Review 
Board for participating sites in the [LOCATION_002]. The Central Institutional Review Board (CIRB)  for 
multicenter protocols is the single IRB of record for those sites. It has regulatory responsibility for assuring 
the protection of the rights and welfare of research participants in accordance with Standard Operating 
Procedure ADM 12; Central Institutional Review Board Reporting. The National Institute of Neurological 
Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) selected the University of Cincinnati Institutional Review Board (IRB) to serve 
as the CIRB for the NIH StrokeNet (StrokeNet) for sites in the [LOCATION_002]. 
Canada 
Each site in Canada will utilize a REB to review research involving humans to ensure the protocol is 
conducted according to the Canada Tri-Council Policy Statement: Ethical Conduct for Research Involving 
Humans (2018) and international standards for Good Clinical Practice. Applicable government regulations 
and site institution research policies and procedures will also be followed. The REB will be responsible for 
reviewing the protocol and the informed consent documentation. 
Article 3.8 in the TCPS-2 outlines when REBs may grant deferral of consent/waiver of consent.[ADDRESS_603503]:

Further, upper age limits in other stroke clinical trials may contribute to a bias towards enrolling more men than 
women since women tend to be older than men at the time of a first stroke. Thus, the absence of an upper age 
limit in MOST will allow us to avoid this bias by [CONTACT_470999] [ADDRESS_603504]. In our analysis of 
discharged ischemic stroke patients in the Medicare Provider and Analysis Review (MEDPAR) administrative 
dataset, StrokeNet hospi[INVESTIGATOR_470960] a lower proportion of white patients compared with non-StrokeNet 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] (76.5% versus 82.8%) (Adeoye International Stroke Conference 2015). Thus, the stroke patients that 
will be available within StrokeNet for MOST are up to 23.5% non-white/minority. Particularly, StrokeNet 
centers such as University of [LOCATION_007], Houston (city population is 24% Black or African American and 44%

                                      21  v6.3 2023-03-06 Hispanic or Latino), Emory University (city population is 54% Black or African American), University of Miami 
(city population is 66% Hispanic or Latino), among others should facilitate adequate representation of 
minorities enrolled. In addition, we have solicited participation from non-StrokeNet sites with diverse patient 
populations.  
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_470961], available literature suggests barriers persist in the 
participation of minorities in clinical trials. Thus, we will take the following additional steps to ensure 
representative enrollment of minorities: 
 
1. Emphasize the goal of recruiting a diverse population of stroke patients to participating sites. 
 
2. Make clear to potential participants that patients of all races and ethnicities are being recruited. 
 
3. Make consent form documents available in Spanish. 
 
4. Review blinded aggregate information on demographic characteristics of enrolled patients after each 
100 enrollments, and consider refocusing recruitment efforts towards sites with larger proportions of 
minorities as warranted. 
 
Finally, while we do not anticipate differential treatment effects based on race or ethnicity, our analyses will 
explore clinically important differences due to race/ethnicity.

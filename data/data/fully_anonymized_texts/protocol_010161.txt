Regimen -Specific A ppendix  D 
For pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325] 45 mg oral capsule administered twice daily (BID)  or its matching  placebo . 
 
Rationale and RSA Design  
The proposed study is based on cumulative preclinical and clinical studies that demonstrate that 
pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_617551] a Sigma -1 Receptor (S1R) agonist and demonstrates 
neuroprotective properties mediated by S1R. The purpose of this study is to eva luate the effect of 
pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325] [ADDRESS_820155] be screened under the Master Protocol before they are randomized to a  
regimen .   
 As soon as pre -defined criteria for futility for the regimen  are met, or the target number of 
randomized participants has been reached, enrollment will stop in the regimen .   
 
Number of Planned Participants and Treatment Groups  
The number of planned participants for this regimen is approximately 160.   
 There are 2  treatment groups for this regimen, active and placebo. P articipants will be 
randomized in a 3:1 ratio to active treatment or placebo  (i.e., 120 active: 4 0 placebo) .   
 
Planned Number of Sites  
Research participants will be enrolled from approximately [ADDRESS_820156] the option to receive pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_617552] (OLE) period of 
the study.   In the OLE, pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_617553], until the primary results of the 24 week double -blind portion of the study are available, or they terminate development of 
pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_617554].   
 
Total Planned Trial Duration  
For participants completing the placebo- controlled t reatment  period of the s tudy, the planned 
amount of time for a participant in the trial is up to 34 weeks, or about 8 months.  This duration assumes a 6- week screening window, a 24- week placebo -controlled treatment period, and a 4 -

placebo -controlled portion of their follow -up (generally the Week 24 V isit, as indicated). If at that time the participant is alive, his or her vital status should be determined again at 
the time of the last participant’s  last visit (LPLV) of the placebo -controlled portion of a given regimen. We may also ascertain vital status at later t ime points by [CONTACT_617635] 8.15 of the Master Protocol.  
13 If the CSF collection is unable to be performed for logistical reasons, such as scheduling, at the Week 16 Visit, it may be performed at the Week 24 Visit.  
14 If a participa nt’s visit occurs in the morning, the participant should be instructed that  the morning dose of study medication should not be taken, and the morning dose  should be 
administered in -clinic [ADDRESS_820162] -DOSE  ECG. If a participant ’s visit occur s in the afternoon, the participant should be instructed to take the morning dose  
immediately upon waking in the morning, and the second dose should be administered in-clinic [ADDRESS_820163] -DOSE  ECG.  
15 At the regimen -specific Screening visit  (and Week 24 for participants enrolling in OLE) , QTcF will be determined by [CONTACT_617636] , 10-second recording s of a 12-Lead 
ECG (performed at least 1 minute a part)  BEFORE IP administration . For participants on Nuedexta, the Nuedexta dose should be taken within 6 hours BEFORE the ECG , refer 
to the MOP for additional guidelines.

[ADDRESS_820166] 1 hour prior to the ECG .  
22 If participant’s visit occurs in the morning, the participant should be instructed not to take the morning dose at home but r ather in -clinic after the PRE -DOSE  ECG.  
If visit occurs in the afternoon, morning dose should be taken immediately upon waki ng in the morning and the second dose after the PRE -DOSE  ECG.  
23 Two smartphone apps should be installed on the participant’s phone, once to collect the voice recordings and o ne to collect home spi[INVESTIGATOR_038].  
24  Drug accountability will not be done at phone visits. A drug compliance check in should be held during phone visits to ensure participant is taking drug per dose regimen and to 
note any report of missed doses.

1.1 Pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_617556] a Sigma -1 Receptor (S1R) 
agonist  (Johnston, e t al. 2019; Sahlholm et al. 2013) . The S1R is a highly conserved 
transmembrane protein located at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and specifically enriched in 
the sub- regions contact[CONTACT_617637] (Mitochondria Associated Membranes, MAM). It acts 
as a ligand- activated chaperone that modulates diverse cellular processes, including calcium 
signaling, ion channel signaling and  the ER stress response  (Hayashi and Su 2005; Su et al. 
2010) . Importantly, S1R activation exerts neuroprotective effects, acting to stimulate brain repair 
and plasticity, by [CONTACT_617638]  (Francardo 
et al. 2014; Hyrskyluoto et al. 2013; Luedtke et al. 2012; Vagnerova et al. 2006) . Loss of the 
S1R exacerbates disease onset and progression in preclinical models of ALS  (Ma vlyutov et al, 
2010; Watanabe et al, 2016) . Importantly, mutations leading to complete loss -of-function (LOF) in 
the S1R gene are associated with juvenile onset  of ALS . However, missense mutations that impair the 
S1R protein, but still retain  some normal function, are associated with an adult form of ALS, showing a 
dose response between function of the S1R and age of onset of ALS. (Al-Saif, Al- Mohanna, and Bohlega 
2011; Izumi et al. 2018; Watanabe et al. 2016) .  
 Pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_617557] S1R in several in vivo and in vitro models  of neurodegeneration, including models of ALS. In ALS SOD1
G93A motor neurons 
(MNs), pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_617558], improves axonal transport, and restores neuromuscular junction (NMJ) synaptic activity. Th ese effects are exquisitely  mediated by [CONTACT_941] S1R , as a genetic 
deletion of the S1R gene abolishes  the protective effects of pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325]. In-vivo, pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_617559]1
G93A mice reduces toxic protein aggregates , enhances MN innervation, and 
ameliorates muscle fiber wasting  (Ionescu et al. 2019) .  
 In Huntington Disease ( HD) models, pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_617560]  a robust and dose -dependent 
neuroprotective effect against mutant huntingtin- (mHTT) -induced cell death in human HD 
induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and mouse HD cortical neurons (Eddings et al. 2019) . 
Furthermore, pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_617561] l function, spi[INVESTIGATOR_252187], and aberrant calcium 
signalling (Ryskamp et al. 2017) , all known features of neurodegenerative disorders .

 Toxicology  
 
The non- clinical  safety profile of pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_617581] a battery of non- clinical  
studies, including safety pharmacology, genotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, and repeat -dose 
toxicity  studies of up to [ADDRESS_820173] battery of genotoxicity studies, including an in -vitro 
bacterial reverse mutation assay  (Ames test), an in -vitro mouse lymphoma  assay, and an in- vivo 
micronucleus assay  in mice.  
 The principal adverse effects of pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325] , observed at high doses  in animals , were clinical 
signs of  CNS toxicity  including convulsions, tremors, recumbency, and hypo- activity.  
In animal studies, there appear s to be a relationship between exposure and convulsions. The 
maximum concentration in plasma (C max) exposure causing convulsions started at about 
6000 ng/mL in both rats and dogs, while no convulsions were observed at exposures below these  
levels in all studies.  C
max exposure of 6000 ng/mL is ~ 9.7-fold higher than the anticipated mean 
peak plasma concentrations at 45 mg BID  (618 ng/mL) , the proposed dose for the ALS clinical 
trial.

 1.1.2. Overview o f the Clinical Development Program  
 
To date, 1,[ADDRESS_820174] one dose of pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_617583] l trials. Of these 1,334 participant s, the  large majority (74%, 987 participants) w ere 
exposed to a daily pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_617584] [ADDRESS_820175] been conducted investigating the pharmacokinetics of pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325] . 
Seven studies were used for the development of the population pharmacokinetic model (PPK) , 
including phase 1 s tudies: ACR16C012, ACR16C013, ACR16C016, and ACR16C018; phase 2 
studies: ACR16C009 (HART) and TV7820- CNS -[ZIP_CODE] (PRIDE -HD); and a phase 3 s tudy 
ACR16C008 (MermaiHD). Pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_617585]- state pharmacokinetics are described by a 2-
compartment linear model with first- order absorption. Of the covariates  studied, only weight and 
participan t CYP2D6 metabolizer status influenced apparent clearance.  
 
Pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_617564] a relatively fast and almost complete absorption after oral administration , with 
individual Cmax occurring between 0.5 and 4 hours after dosing (the median time to maximum concentration in plasma [ Tmax] is 1.25 to 2 hours). Food intake has no impact on the extent of 
absorption of pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325].  After absorption, pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_617586] (primarily via the CYP2D6 pathway), with a mean half -life 
(t½) of approximately 10 hours at steady- state. In extensive metabolizers (EMs), pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_617587] b y CYP2D6 to 1 main metabolite (TV -[ZIP_CODE]). Conversely, poor metabolizers 
(PMs) depend on renal excretion as their main elimination pathway. 
 Prior to reaching steady- state pharmacokinetics, pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_617588]2D6 to one 
main inactive metabolite (TV -[ZIP_CODE]). However, since CYP2D6 undergoes auto- inhibition; the 
fraction of pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_617589]2D6 decreases with multiple doses , renal 
elimination becomes a more important elimination pathway, and the fraction excreted unchanged increases. Steady  state  is reached after approximately 10 days.  
 
Mild renal impairment (defined as glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 60 -89 mL/min/1.73 m
2) 
did not affect the steady- state pharmacokinetics of 45 mg of pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_617590] (QD ). 
Participant s with moderate renal impairment (defined as GFR of 30- 59 mL/min/1.73 m2) had 
1.68- fold higher AUC and 1.26- fold higher Cmax val ues than matching healthy participan ts at 
steady  state . 
 
Studies in participant s with hepatic impairment have not been performed, but PMs are expected 
to represent a worst -case scenario for hepatic impairment with minimal increase in pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_617591] (Cmax or AUC). In the PRIDE -HD study, no dose adjustment was implemented for 
PM participant s, and this population was administered up to 112.[ADDRESS_820176] a narrow therapeutic index and/or have a concern related

All AEs across all clinical studies (22 studies) were combined into an integrated safety database. 
Since the majority of participants expos ed to pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_617592] 45 mg BID  
dosage regimen (74% of participants , 84% of the cumulative parti cipant -years of exposure), AEs 
are presented for the following two groups :  
(1) Pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325] [ADDRESS_820177] one time  but did not receive a dose higher than 45 mg BID  
(2) Placebo -  all participants  in pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_617593] w ho did not  receiv e a 
single dose of pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_617594] -years  (PY) of exposure between  the 
groups , an analysis of AE reporting rates corrected for participant -years of exposur e was 
performed  in addition to AE incidence.  
 The incidence and rate (events/participant years)  of AEs  in the pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325] 45 mg BID  group 
(n=981, participant  years= 1091)  and placebo group (n=338, participant  years=148.8) was 
evaluated across the integrated safety analysis of the 22 trials . 
 The integrated analysis of safety data from the 22 pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_617593] , primarily 
conducted in Huntington Disease (HD) participants, indicate d that the adverse ev ents (AE) 
profile of the [ADDRESS_820178] 1 AE was similar 
between the placebo group (rate=2.35 events/participant year) and the pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325] 45 mg BID group (rate =1.81 events/participant year). Most AEs for participants in both the placebo and pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325] 45 mg BID groups were reported as mild or moderate in severity. Severe AEs occurred with a similar frequency across treatment groups.  Serious adverse events (SAEs) were observed across both active and placebo groups. There was a slight increase in the number of participan ts with SAEs  in the active groups compared with the 
placebo group, but no dose -dependence was observed (detailed in the IB safety section) . 
 AEs indicating Proarrhythmic Potential  
 Across the integrated safety database (22 trials) , the rate (events/participant year)  of AEs of QT  
prolongation was higher in the placebo group ( rate=0.013 events/participant year ) compared to 
the pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325] 45 mg BID  group ( rate=0.005 events/participant year ) (Table 1 ).  
 
The 52-week placebo -controlled PRIDE -HD study included 5 treatment arms : placebo , 
pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325] 45 mg BID , pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325] 67.5 mg BID , pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325] 90 mg BID,  and pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325] 
112.5 mg BID . The AE data from this trial provides a more sensitive analysis of dose -
dependency and is thus analyzed separately. The number of participant -years  of exposure was 
similar in  each of the treatment groups in this study; therefore, only tables of AE incidence  were 
generated.

In the PRIDE -HD trial , there was a higher overall incidence of AE -reports of QT prolongation 
(unrelated to any other proarrhythmic event) in pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325] -treated participant s compared to 
placebo -treated participants:1.5% in pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325] -treated participant s vs 0 % in placebo -treated 
participant s. However, there was no evidence of dose- response ( Table 2 ).  
 
In accordance with the ICH E14 Guideline, Clinical Evaluation of QT/QTc Interval Prolongation 
and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non- Antiarrhythmic Drugs, the safe ty database was analyzed for 
rates of clinical events indicating a proarrhythmic potential, and the rates observed in treated and control participants  were compared . An analysis of the full safety database that includes all 
participan ts treated with at least one dose of pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_617595] 112.5 mg BID . One case of mild 
ventricular arrhythmia was reported.  
 Exposure -response analysis of QT Prolongation  
 The PRIDE -HD trial incorporated extensive electrocardiogram ( ECG ) monitoring and a 
pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling schedule that captured peak plasma concentrations over  52 
weeks . 
 ECGs and PK data from the PRIDE -HD study resulted in a comprehensive exposure -response 
analysis, including data from >400 HD pa rticipant s, treated with 5 doses of pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325] 
(including placebo), for up to [ADDRESS_820179] of pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_617596] a slope 
of 0.012 ms per ng/m L (90% CI: 0.0109 to 0.0127 ms per ng/mL) . 
At the proposed dose of [ADDRESS_820180] (∆∆QTcF) in participants with HD 
was 6.6 ms (with an upper bound of the 90%  confidence interval of  8 ms) , which is not clinically 
meaningful.   In summary, in the PRIDE -HD study, QT prolongation was found to be an adverse drug reaction 
associated with the use of pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325] . At 45 mg BID, the dose to be tested in the ALS trial, there 
is no clinical significance of QT prolongation.

CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 22 of 68 Target engagement in humans  and prior evidence of clinical efficacy  
The proposed dose for the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial Regimen D  is 45 mg BID. At this dose, 
pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_617598] S1R in human brains (>90% S1R 
occupancy) with negligible (~3%) binding to the D2/D3Rs, suggesting its dominant 
pharmacological effect at this dosage is mediated via the S1R.   
The S1R regulates cellular signaling pathways that are commonly impaired in various 
neurodegenerative disorders, such as calcium signaling, mitochondrial  function, and spi[INVESTIGATOR_458956]. 
Loss of function (LOF) mutations in S1Rs are associated with juvenile ALS  and missense 
mutations with adult- onset ALS.  LOF mutations are also associated with distal hereditary motor 
neuronopathies (dHMN). Pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325], via activation of the S1R, exerts neuroprotective properties in numerous preclinical models including ALS, HD, PD and AD and may, therefore, have therapeutic effects in ALS.  
The PRIDE -HD study was a [ADDRESS_820183]-hoc analysis of data from PRIDE -HD demonstrated 
pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325] 45 mg BID significantly maintained total functional capacity (TFC) in early HD 
participant s at 52 weeks. (Reilmann, Olanow, et al. 2019)   
TFC is the most widely accepted and validated tool for assessing disease stage and correlates with advancing pathology and disease progression (Shoulson and Fahn 1979; Marder et al. 2000) . Decline 
in TFC parallels the decline in other measures, including motor, cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and functional assessments  (Tabrizi et al. 2013; 2012; Dorsey et al. 2013) . It has been used as an endpoint 
in more than ten other clinical tr ials of drugs seeking to demonstrate impact on HD progression, none 
of which were positive.  
 Pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325] 45 mg BID also demonstrates a good safety profile. An integrated analysis of 
adverse events (AEs) was performed using a large safety database (over 1 ,300 participants) 
generated from [ADDRESS_820184] that there is no 
increased risk of psychiatric symptoms or cardi ac toxicity with pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325] 45 mg BID .  
Taken together, compelling preclinical data and clinical data demonstrat e that pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325] 45 mg 
BID has:  
(1) Robust and selective human in- vivo S1R target engagement (PET imaging)  
(2) Neuroprotecti ve effects  in numerous preclinical models  of neurodegeneration, 
including ALS, HD, PD and AD  
(3) Significant effect on maintaining total functional capacity  at 52 weeks in early HD 
participant s in comparison to placebo in a double -blind study, and  
(4) A favorable safety and tolerability profile   
These , and the genetic link between the S1R and ALS, justify a study to test the clinical benefits of 
pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_617599] . 
 Dosing Regimen  
 
The proposed dose to be tested in the planned study is 45 mg twice daily ( BID), taken in the 
morning and in the early afternoon ( approximately 7 to 10 hours after the morning dose).

This study is a multi- center, randomized, placebo- controlled trial, testing active dose of 
pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325] (45mg BID), given orally daily versus placebo. Participants will be randomized 3:1 active: placebo.  
 
The study will consist of  a screening/baseline visit, a  2-week double -blind, placebo -controlled 
up-titration period, a 22- week double -blind, full -dose, placebo -controlled treatment period, and a 
28-day safety follow -up period (after the last dose of IP) for those participants who do not enter 
the Open Label Extension (OLE) period of the study.  
 After signing informed consent, pa rticipants  will undergo screening assessments to determine 
eligibility  and eligible participant s will be randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to 1 of 2 study 
intervention groups:  
• Treatment Arm 1 (active): pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325] 45 mg ora lly (PO), BID (total daily dose of 90 mg 
after two week up -titration period at 45mg PO , QD ) 
• Treatment Arm 2 (control): matching placebo, PO BID  
 
During the 2 week up- titration period (starting on Day 1), all pa rticipants  will self -administer 
1 capsule of study intervention PO once daily (QD) in the morning. In the full -dose treatment 
period (starting on Day 14) study intervention will be taken BID, in the morning and in the afternoon ( approximately 7- 10 hours apart). Participants who complete all scheduled visits  will 
have the option of participating in the OLE period  of the  study.  
 Throughout the study, participant s will be assessed through on- site clinic visits and telephone 
calls, as specified in the Schedule of Activities (SoA)  table . 
 For pa rticipants
 who complete all scheduled visits, their final visit will be the  Follow -Up 
Safety Call  (28 days after the Week 24  clinic visit) , unless participants continue on in the 
OLE. Participants  who discontinue study intervention  early  will be encouraged to complete 
all other visits as scheduled for the full course of the study  per ITT . For participants who 
withdraw early from the placebo- controlled period , an in- person Early Termination Visit and a 
Follow -up Safety Call should be conducted. At the Early Termination Visit the same procedures 
as described for the Week 24 visit should be conducted. At the Follow -up Safety Call, 
information on clinical status should be collected.  
 
Participants  who complete the full study regimen  (24 weeks) will have the option to enroll into 
the OLE  period of the  study and receive pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325] 45 mg orally BID (total daily dose of 90

monitoring with  stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_617606]:  
 
QT Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]:  
 QTcF > 500 ms  or 
 QTcF > 480 ms AND Δ QTcF > 60 ms from regimen baseline value  (pre-dose)   
o The regimen baseline QTcF value is the average of  triplicate ECGs collected 
pre-dose  during the regimen S creening V isit.  
o For all subsequent visits the  ΔQTcF  is calculated  using the regimen baseline 
QTcF value ( pre-dose), as described  above  (average triplicate screening QTcF ).  
 For Baseline post dose  visit only, Δ QTcF  is calculated from the initial 
printout, as the ERT Overread will not be available at the time of the Baseline Visit.  
 For all other ECGs  (i.e.Week 4 and Week 24 ), ΔQTcF  should be  
calculated using the  baseline QTcF pre-dose (average triplicate 
screening QTcF ) from  the ERT Overrea d.   
o For participants who  transition into the OLE, the new baseline QTcF is the 
average triplicate QTcF collected pre- dose  during the Week 24 visit.  
 If a participant meets either of the above stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], IP  must be held  and the 
participant will be asked to return to the clinic after 3- 14 days for a follow up ECG.  
 If the local ECG reading results at the site match either of the above stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], the 
IP will be held  until the ERT overread  report is received. If the ERT overread  does not 
confirm a participant meet s the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_617607], then the participant can restart the 
study drug.  
 If a participant meets either of the above stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004] , confirmed by [CONTACT_617640] , IP must be discontinued and the participant will  be asked to  return to the 
clinic after 3 -14 days for a foll ow up ECG.    
 
QT Monitoring Rule:  
 QTcF > 480 ms OR Δ QTcF > 60 ms from regimen baseline value  (pre-dose)   
o The regimen baseline QTcF value is the average of  triplicate ECGs collected 
pre-dose  during the regimen Screening Visit.  
o For all subsequent visits the Δ QTcF  is calculated  using the regimen baseline 
QTcF value (pre- dose) , as described  above  (average triplicate screening QTcF).   
 For Baseline post dose visit only, 
ΔQTcF  is calculated from the initial 
printout, as the ERT Overread will not be available at the time of the Baseline Visit.

 5.5      Study M edication/Intervention , Administration, Escalation, and Duration  
 
Participants  will take 45 mg capsule s of active IP/placebo  BID (1 capsule in the morning and 1 
capsule in the afternoon, approximately 7 to 10 hours after the mor ning dose); total daily dose 
(TDD) of 90  mg. Capsules should be swallowed whole with a drink of water (or other liquid) or 
swallowed whole with substances of other consistencies as appropriate (e.g. applesauce), and can 
be taken irrespective of meals. For delivery via gastro stomy tube, the capsule can be opened and 
the contents diluted in 20- 30mL of water and mixed. The prepared solution  should be used 
immediately. Flushing with water is recommended to minimize clogging of the gastro stomy 
tubing after administration.  
All pa rticip ants receiving study intervention are intended to receive the same fixed- dose 
regimen, in terms of dose and daily (BID) frequency, according to the study schedule. There will be a titration period leading up to the proposed dose whereby [CONTACT_617646][INVESTIGATOR_5325] /placebo  at 45  mg QD and then increase to 45 mg BID after 2 weeks.   
  5.6     Justification for Dose   
 
The dos age of pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325] (45 mg BID) was selected on the basis of three  large HD clinical 
studies (HART, MermaiHD, and PRIDE -HD) and has been shown to be safe and well -tolerated 
in >[ADDRESS_820200] s in the 
PRIDE -HD study, including potential sustainable effe cts based on the long -term open -label 
study, and is therefore anticipated to provide efficacy with low safety and tolerability  risks . In

Page 36 of 68 documented and summarized by a drug -dispensing log for each participant. During phone visits, 
drug compliance check -in will be held to ensure participant is taking drug per dose regimen and 
to note any report of missed doses.Participants  will be counseled on the importance of taking the 
IP as directed at all study visits. If poor compliance continues, (i.e., multiple missed doses 
resulting in less than 80% overall compliance), discontinuation of the participant from the trial 
should be considered and discussed with the Medical Monitor.  
  
5.9 Overdose  
 Certain safety events  that occur in association with IP  may require reporting. These safety events  
include, but are not limited to, the following:  
• Overdose of the IP, where ‘overdose’ is def ined as a participant ingesting more than 3 times 
the intended dose  
• Suspected abuse/misuse of the IP 
• Inadvertent or accidental exposure  to the IP 
• Medication error involving IP  (with or without participant exposure to the  IP, e.g., name 
[CONTACT_2976])  
 
These safety events  should be reported to the Coordination Center  whether they result  in an 
AE/SAE or not. Safety events  associated with an AE/SAE should also be reported in the EDC . 
In the event of overdose , study staff should monitor the participant and provide supportive care 
as needed. The SI should also contact [CONTACT_27909] 24 hours of the SI’s awareness.

QT prolongation:  
In the PRIDE -HD trial of 408 participants, the cardiac effects of pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_617616] 112.5 mg BID for 52 weeks. Although low, there was a higher overall incidence of AE -reports of QT prolongati on in pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325] -treated participan ts com pared 
to placebo -treated participant s: 1.5% in pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325] -treated participan ts vs 0% in placebo- treated 
participan ts. However, there was no evidence of a dose response in QT -related AEs (QT 
prolongation AEs: 0 in placebo, 2 in 45 mg BID , 0 in 67.5 mg BID , 1 in 90 mg BID  and 2 in 
112.5 mg BID ; total 5/327=1.5%) . Using the PRIDE -HD da ta, a cardiac exposure -response 
model was developed utilizing ECG data paired with PK samples collected for up to a year. Only ECGs that were paired with PK samples (n=3071) were used to develop the cardiac exposure -
response model, which was based on [ADDRESS_820203] of pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_617617], 
with a slope of 0.012 ms per ng/mL (90% CI: 0.0109 to 0.0127 ms per ng/mL).  
 At [ADDRESS_820204] (∆∆QTcF) in participants with HD was 6.6 ms (with an 
upper bound of the 90% CI 8 ms) , which is not clinically meaningful. Pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325] [ADDRESS_820205] , as there is no prior experience with pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_617618], we plan to include additional  safety monitoring and risk mitig ation measures . 
 
5.11.2 Potential Benefits  
 
Loss of function mutations in S1R cause neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS (Al-Saif, Al -
Mohanna, and Bohlega 2011; Watanabe et al., n.d.; Izumi et al. 2018)  and distal hereditary motor 
neurop athies ( dHMN)  (Gregianin et al. 2016; Li et al. 2015 ), suggesting restoration of S1R function 
could be beneficial in these motor neuron diseases.  Denervation at the neuromuscular junction 
(NMJ ) is considered one of the earliest events in ALS disease progression (Fischer et al. 2004) . 
Using in vitro  ALS models, pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_617619] (percent of

 Participants may be required to reconsent to the regimen if new procedures or information are/ is 
added in the future. Should a participant need to reconsent, this should occur during the 
participant’s next in -person visit. If the participant’s next in- clinic visit is conducted remotely, 
reconsent may also be completed remotely using the following procedures:  
 
1. The site staff sends copy of the informed consent form to the participant.  
2. The participant reads through the consent form but does not sign.  
3. The Site  Investigator, or other study staff member approved and delegated to obtain informed 
consent, c ontacts  the participant and reviews the informed consent form with the participant.  
4. The participant signs the informed consent form and returns  the original signed consent form 
back to the site.  
5. Once received at the site, the individual who consented the participant signs the informed 
consent form.

morning dose at home , and the morning dose should be administered in -clinic [ADDRESS_820208] -dose ECG. If a participant’s visit occurs in the afternoon, the participant should be 
instructed to take the morning dose immediately upon waking in the morning, and the second 
dose should be administered in -clinic [ADDRESS_820209] on Day 28 ± 7.  The following procedures will be performed for the regimen schedule:  
 
• Administer single ECG 1 -2 hours AFTER  IP is administered  
o Note: if the participant is taking Nuedexta, the Nuedexta dose should be taken 
within 6 hours prior to the ECG . If participant has taken Nuedexta outside of this 
window , the ECG should still be completed and a protocol deviation recorded. 
Refer to the MOP for additional guidance.  
• Plasma collection  AFTER ECG

For all assessments listed below, please refer to the Manual of Procedures for detailed 
instructions. 
 
7.1 Voice Analysis  
 In addition to the scheduled in clinic voice recordings, voice samples will be collected twice per 
week  and at each in person visit , using an app installed on either an android or iOS -based 
smartphone.  The app characterizes  ambient noise, then asks participants to perform a set of 
speaking tasks: reading sentences -- 5 fixed and 5 chosen at random from a large sentence bank-- 
repeating a consonant -vowel sequence, producing a sustained phonation, and counting on a 
single breath. Voice signals are uploaded to a HIPAA -compliant web server, where an AI -based 
analysis identifies relevant vocal attributes. Quality control (QC) of individual samples will 
occur by [CONTACT_191956].  The voice analysis app is only available in English, therefore participants who do not speak 
English should not complete the voice recording. Caregivers cannot provide language assistance 
when the participant is completing the voice recording.  
 7.2 ALSAQ -40 
 
The Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Assessment Questi onnaire -40 (ALSAQ -40) is a participan t 
self-report health status patient- reported outcome. The ALSAQ -40 consists of forty  questions 
that are specifically used to measure the subjective well- being of participant s with ALS  and 
motor neuron disease. Higher scores indicate a decrease in quality of life.  
 
Participants will be handed the questionnaire and asked to write their answers themselves.  
Caregivers can also help, if needed.  
 
7.3 Center for Neurologic Study Bulbar Function Scale  
 The Center for Neurologic Study B ulbar Function Scale (CNS -BFS) is a pa rticipant self -report 
scale that has been developed for use as an endpoint in clinical trials and as a clinical measure for evaluating and following ALS patients  (Smith et al, 2018) . The CN S-BFS consists of three 
domains (swallowing, speech, and salivation), which are assessed with a 21 -question, self -report 
questionnaire. Higher scores indicate greater bulbar dysfunction.  
 
Participants will be handed the questionnaire and asked to write the ir answers themselves.  
Caregivers can also help, if needed.  
 Instructions on administering the questionnaire during a phone or telemedicine visit will be included in the MOP.

The Center for Neurologic Study Lability  Scale (CNS -LS) is a participant self -report scale that 
has been developed for use as an endpoint in clinical trials and as a clinical measure for evaluating emotional lability . The CNS -LS is a short (seven -question) , self -report  questionnaire, 
designed to be completed by [CONTACT_617647] t, that provides a quantitative measure of the 
perceived frequency of PBA epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. Higher scores indicate greater emotional lability. A CNS -
LS score of [ADDRESS_820233] data for this scale.  
 7.5 Home Spi[INVESTIGATOR_617624]/home -based forced vital capacity will be measured with the MIR Spi[INVESTIGATOR_617625] . Instructions for use will be provided to the participant .  The participant will perform 
the vital capacity  maneuver with real  time video coaching (or phone coaching, if video is not 
available) by [CONTACT_191957].  Three to five  vital capacity  maneuvers will be performed, consistent 
with the manner vital capacity  is obtained in clinic.

characteristics are available in Appendix I to the master protocol.   
  9.3  Sharing of Controls from other Regimens  
 The primary analysis of this regimen will include sharing of all controls from the other regimens.  This i s justified by [CONTACT_191958]/exclusion criteria of the RSA, such that 
there are no expected systematic differences in the primary endpoint between the controls across regimens.   
  9.4 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
 
If the primary anal ysis demonstrates significant slowing of decline in ALSFRS -R among 
participants randomized to pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325], then the following secondary hypotheses will be tested in the specified sequence with overall type I error rate controlled using a sequential closed -testing 
procedure:  
1. Rate of change in ALSFRS- R bulbar subdomain (Q1- Q3) score among participants with 
bulbar dysfunction at baseline, 
2. Rate of change in ALSFRS- R bulbar subdomain (Q1- Q3) score among all randomized 
participants,  
3. Rate of change in the speech sub- score of the ALSFRS -R (Q1) among all randomized 
participants  
4. Rate of change in SVC maximum percent of predicted among all randomized participants,  
5. Rate of change in ALSFRS- R bulbar subdomain (Q1- Q3) score among participants with 
pre-baseline slo pe ≥0.75 points/month,  
6. Time to onset of bulbar symptoms among participants free of bulbar dysfunction at baseline,  
7. Rate of change in HHD percent change from baseline among all randomized participants,  
8. Time to death or death equivalent  
 
Analyses for each secondary hypothesis will use an ITT analysis sample that includes placebo participants from concurrently enrolling regimens. Analyses of ALSFRS -R bulbar subdomain,

include random intercepts and slopes by [CONTACT_617648]. Given low expected event rates, time to bulbar onset and time to death or death 
equivalent will use log -rank tests. Per protocol analyses will also be performed to evaluate the 
effects of pridopi[INVESTIGATOR_617626]. Details of endpoint 
measures, analysis samples, statistical models, and the closed -testing procedure will be described 
in the regimen -specific statistical analysis plan.

MC1685 6 Addendum 8 
Version: 17Jun2021  1.0 Background  
1.1 Overview of non -Hodgkin  lymphoma 
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is the seventh most common type of cancer in both men 
and women  In 2014, there were an estimated 71,[ADDRESS_317006] common NHL in the US – diffuse large B -cell lymphoma 
(DLBCL) (Habermann, Weller et al. 2006). Unfortunately, 40% of patients relapse or do 
not respond to first- line treatment with RCHOP and require further treatment. Some are 
salvaged with high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell support but many die of disease. 
There is an unmet need for novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_260702] (Ansell and Armitage 2005). 
Low grade NHL accounts for approximately one third of all cases of NHL. Follicular 
lymphoma (FL) is the second most common NHL. First line treatment option at the time 
of initial diagnosis can range among watchful waiting, localized radiation, immune -
therapy and systemic chemoimmunotherapy depending on disease burden and patient symptoms. While this disease can be very responsive to chemoimmunotherapy initially, for example with 90% overall response to bendamustine and rituximab or RCHOP 
(Rummel, Niederle et al. 2013) , it can become progressively refractory to treatments with 
subsequent relapses. There is no consensus regarding the choice of salvage, second and subsequent chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_260703]. Ultimately it remains an 
incurable disease. As such, quality of life is an equally important consideration in selecting effective treatment while minimizing toxicity, making immunotherapy a 
potentially attractive candidate to delay chemotherapy. 
1.[ADDRESS_317007] been correlated with survival in NHL patients (Habermann, Wang et al. 
2008). The Mayo group has also demonstrated that patients who are immune-
compromised, as measured by [CONTACT_260732] (ALC) or high absolute monocyte count (AMC) have a poorer treatment response compared to those with normal 
ALC or AMC (Siddiqui, Ristow et al. 2006, Behl, Ristow et al. 2007, Porrata, Ristow et 
al. 2007, Wilcox, Ristow et al. 2011, Wilcox, Ristow et al. 2012). Immunologic 
reconstitution such as the rate of lymphocyte reconstitution (Kim, Sohn et al. 2004, 
Porrata and Markovic 2004)  and presence of lymphocytes, natural killer cells and 
dendritic cells (DC) in transplanted grafts (Porrata, Gastineau et al. 2003, Gazitt, Akay et 
al. 2006, Porrata, Inwards et al. 2015) have also been associated with improved outcome 
in NHL patients who have received autologous stem cell transplants. These studies 
underline the importance of the patient’s immune competence in determining outcome 
and provide rationale for immune -augmen tation in therapy.  
  

MC1685 7 Addendum 8 
Version: 17Jun2021  1.[ADDRESS_317008] hijacked by [CONTACT_70710].  The normal function of PD- 1, expressed on the cell 
surface of activated T -cells under healthy conditions, is to down-modulate 
excessive immune responses, including autoimmune reactions. PD -1 (encoded by 
[CONTACT_13228]1) is an Ig superfamily member related to CD28 and CTLA-4 that 
has been shown to negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling upon 
engagement of its ligands (PD-L1 and/or PD- L2) (Zhang, Schwartz et al. 2004, 
Francisco, Sage et al. 2010) . PD-1 and family members are type I transmembrane 
glycoproteins containing an Ig Variable- type (V -type) domain responsible for 
ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail which is responsible for the binding of 
signaling molecules. The cytoplasmic tail of PD-1 contains 2 tyrosine-based 
signaling motifs, an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based inhibition motif (ITIM) and 
an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif (ITSM). Following T- cell 
stimulation, PD -1 recruits the tyrosine phosphatases SHP -1 and SHP-2 to the 
ITSM motif within its cytoplasmic tail, leading to the dephosphorylation of effector molecules such as CD3ζ, PKCθ and ZAP70 which are involved in the CD3 T -cell signaling cascade (Galon, Costes et al. 2006, Talmadge, Donkor et al. 
2007) . The mechanism by [CONTACT_13209] -[ADDRESS_317009] from that of CTLA -4 as both molecules regulate an 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_77971]. PD -1 was shown to be expressed on 
activated lymphocytes including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T- cells, B - cells, T 
regs and Natural Killer cells (Kloor 2009) , as well as subsets of macrophages and 
dendritic cells (Hillen, Baeten et al. 2008). The ligands for PD -1 (PD -L1 and PD-
L2) are constitutively expressed or can be induced in a variety of cell types, 
including non- hematopoietic tissues as well as in various tumors (Hiraoka 2010). 
Both ligands are type I transmembrane receptors containing both IgV- and IgC-like domains in the extracellular region and contain short cytoplasmic regions 
with no known signaling motifs. Binding of either PD-[ADDRESS_317010] notably on vascular 
endothelium, whereas PD-L2 protein is only detectably expressed on antigen- 
presenting cells found in lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory environments.  
PD-L2 is thought to control immune T-cell activation in lymphoid organs, 
whereas PD -L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T-cell function in peripheral 
tissues (Hiraoka 2010). Although healthy organs express little (if any) PD-L1, a 
variety of cancers were demonstrated to express abundant levels of this T -cell 
inhibitor. This suggests that the PD- 1/PD -L1 pathway plays a critical role in 
tumor immune evasion and should be considered as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. 
1.[ADDRESS_317011] shown that PD -1 expression is detected in FL T cells and its diffuse 
pattern of staining is associated with worse survival (Smeltzer, Jones et al. 2014). 
PD-1 expression in FL T cells is increased when FL transformed into DLBCL. In 
FL T cells, dim PD -1 surface expression represents an exhausted T cell 
phenotype and is associated with worse progression free survival (Yang, Grote et al. 2015) . PD-[ADDRESS_317012] all types of 
NHL (Xerri, Chetaille et al. 2008, Muenst, Hoeller et al. 2010) and is likely a 
MC1685 8 Addendum 8 
Version: 17Jun2021  marker of exhaustion in other types of NHL. 
1.33 Expression of PD-1 ligands in lymph node and bone marrow in NHL  
In addition to the evidence of PD -1 expression in NHL, expressions of PD-1 
ligands are detected in lymphoma tumors. PD -L1 expression is increased in 
tumor B cells in FL lymph nodes compared to its counterpart in reactive nodes 
(Andorsky, Yamada et al. 2011, Myklebust, Irish et al. 2013). Additionally, soluble PD-L1 levels in the peripheral blood in diffuse large B cell lymphoma is 
associated with decreased overall survival (Rossille, Gressier et al. 2014). 
1.[ADDRESS_317013] mechanism of action and cells targeted by [CONTACT_4002]-1 blockade is unknown. 
Intriguingly while PD -L1 expression is seen in both Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) 
and NHL, the overall response rate is vastly different between the two diseases, 
87% and 28% respectively (Ansell, Lesokhin et al. 2015) ; (Lesokhin, Ansell et 
al. ASH Annual Meeting, Blood Abstract #291). In addition to the role of PD-1/PD -L1 signaling in T cell exhaustion, we have also found that activated DC can 
have increased PD -L1 expression , which interfere s with CD8 T cell priming and 
limits differentiation of effector T cell response (Pulko, Liu et al. 2009, Gibbons, 
Liu et al. 2014). Blockade of PD- 1/PD -L1 signaling enhanced CD8 T cell 
response and cleared tumors in an animal model (Pulko, Liu et al. 2009, Gibbons, 
Liu et al. 2014) . We have found that monocytes and dendritic cells response are 
significantly inhibited in NHL (Wilcox, Wada et al. 2009, Lin, Gustafson et al. 
2011) . We hypothesize that PD -1 blockade could increase the anti- tumor efficacy 
of dendritic cell vaccines by [CONTACT_14377] T cell priming.  
1.35 Preliminary clinical activity of PD -1 blockade in NHL  
PD-1 blockade as a single agent in relapsed/refractory NHL is approximately 
28% (Lesokhin, Ansell et al. ASH Annual Meeting, Blood Abstract #291). In relapsed DLBCL, PD -1 blockade after autologous stem cell transplant achieved 
~50% overall response rate in patients who had residual disease after transplant 
(Armand, Nagler et al. 2013). In relapsed FL, 66% ORR and 50% CR were 
observed with the combination therapy of rituximab and anti- PD-1 antibody 
(Westin, Chu et al. 2014). In this study, we will examine the tolerability and efficacy of PD -1 blockade with dendritic cell vaccine in NHL. 
1.36 Clinical Trial Data  
Pembrolizumab  (MK -3475 , previously known as SCH 900475) is a potent and 
highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the IgG4/kappa 
isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD -[ADDRESS_317014] been treated with Pembrolizumab  at 
several dose schedules, including 10 mg/kg every [ADDRESS_317015] human clinical trial (PN001). Less than 1% of patients thus far assayed had confirmed positive anti- drug antibody (ADA) 
samples and among these, no or no clear impact on exposure has been observed. There is no contraindication to further clinical investigation with Pembrolizumab . 
Pharmacokinetics were as expected, based on Pembrolizumab  being an IgG mAb 
MC1685 9 Addendum 8 
Version: 17Jun2021  and based on preclinical data, which support dosing once every 2 or 3 weeks. 
Pembrolizumab  monotherapy induces an ORR of 25%/27% in patients with 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_260704]/investigator assessed irRC, respectively. Pembrolizumab  monotherapy 
induces an ORR of 39%/43% in patients with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -naive melanoma by 
[CONTACT_260733]/investigator assessed irRC, respectively. These responses are remarkably durable.  
The preliminary 1-year survival rate for patients, many of whom have had multiple therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], who receive Pembrolizumab  is 81%. 
Pembrolizumab  monotherapy induces an ORR of 21%/24% in patients with 
previously- treated NSCLC by [CONTACT_260734]/investigator assessed irRC, respectively, with these responses also remarkably durable. Preliminary 
data suggest higher levels of PD -L1 expression in tumors of NSCLC are 
associated with increased activity (ORR 67% by [CONTACT_260735]/57% by [CONTACT_260734]); additional data are required to define the 
optimal PD -L1 cut point. The most commonly reported treatment emergent AEs 
experienced are fatigue (43.8%), nausea (26.7%), cough (25.3%), pruritus (24.6%), diarrhoea (22.3%) and rash (21.5%). Immune- related adverse events 
were reported in 21.4% of melanoma patients; most of these events (15.8%) were 
considered drug-related by [CONTACT_093]. The most commonly reported, 
immune -related adverse events across the dose- schedules are rash (3.2%), 
pruritus (2.9%), vitiligo (2.9%), hypothyroidism (2.7%), arthralgia (2.2%), diarrhea (2.2%), and pneumonitis (1.9%). Review of the overall benefit:risk ratio of Pembrolizumab  favors enrollment of eligible patients into clinical trials of 
MK-3475. The preliminary data suggest that a dose of Pembrolizumab  at 2 
mg/kg Q3W is appropriate for patients with melanoma. 
1.37 Rationale for Dose Selection/Regimen/Modification  
The dose regimen of 200 mg Q3W of Pembrolizumab  is planned for all urothelial 
cancer trials. Available PK results in subjects with melanoma, NSCLC, and other 
solid tumor types support a lack of meaningful difference in PK exposures 
obtained at a given dose among tumor types. An open-label Phase 1 trial (PN001) 
in melanoma subjects is being conducted to evaluate the safety and clinical 
activity of single agent Pembrolizumab . The dose escalation portion of this trial 
evaluated three dose levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, administered every 
2 weeks (Q2W) in subjects with advanced solid tumors. All three dose levels 
were well tolerated and no dose -limiting toxicities were observed. This first in 
human study of Pembrolizumab  showed evidence of target engagement and 
objective evidence of tumor size reduction at all dose levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Q2W). No maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been identified. 
In KEYNOTE -001, two randomized cohort evaluations of melanoma subjects 
receiving Pembrolizumab  at a dose of 2 mg/kg versus 10 mg/kg Q3W have been 
completed. The clinical efficacy and safety data demonstrate a lack of clinically 
important differences in efficacy response or safety profile at these doses. For 
example, in Cohort B2, advanced melanoma subjects who had received prior 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_260705] 2 mg/kg versus 10 mg/kg Q3W. The overall response rate (ORR) was 26 % (21/81) in the 
2mg/kg group and 26% (25/79) in the 10 mg/kg group (full analysis set (FAS)). The proportion of subjects with drug-related adverse events (AEs), grade 3-5 
drug- related AEs, serious drug-related AEs, death or discontinuation due to an 
MC1685 10 Addendum 8 
Version: 17Jun2021  AE was comparable between groups or lower in the 10 mg/kg group. 
Available pharmacokinetic results in subjects with melanoma, NSCLC, and other 
solid tumor types support a lack of meaningful difference in pharmacokinetic 
exposures obtained at a given dose among tumor types. Population PK analysis 
has been performed and has confirmed the expectation that intrinsic factors do 
not affect exposure to pembrolizumab  to a clinically meaningful extent. Taken 
together, these data support the use of lower doses (with similar exposure to 2 
mg/kg Q3W) in all solid tumor indications. 2 mg/kg Q3W is being evaluated in 
NSCLC in PN001, Cohort F30 and PN010, and 200 mg Q3W is being evaluated 
in head and neck cancer in PN012, which are expected to provide additional data 
supporting the dose selection. 
Selection of 200 mg as the appropriate dose for a switch to fixed dosing is based 
on simulation results indicating that 200 mg will provide exposures that are 
reasonably consistent with those obtained with 2 mg/kg dose and importantly 
will maintain individual patient exposures within the exposure range established 
in melanoma as associated with maximal clinical response. A population PK 
model, which characterized the influence of body weight and other patient 
covariates on exposure, has been developed using available data from 476 subjects from PN001. The distribution of exposures from the 200 mg fixed dose 
are predicted to considerably overlap those obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose, with 
some tendency for individual values to range slightly higher with the 200 mg 
fixed dose. The slight increase in PK variability predicted for the fixed dose 
relative to weight -based dosing is not expected to be clinically important given 
that the range of individual exposures is well contained within the range of 
exposures shown in the melanoma studies of 2 and 10 mg/kg to provide similar 
efficacy and safety. The population PK evaluation revealed that there was no 
significant impact of tumor burden on exposure. In addition, exposure was 
similar between the NSCLC and melanoma indications. Therefore, there are no anticipated changes in exposure between different tumor types and indication 
settings.  
1.4 Rationale for autologous dendritic cell vaccine therapy 
1.41  Evidence for dendritic cell vaccine in cancer  
Dendritic cells are the professional antigen -presenting cells that induce and 
regulate both adaptive and innate immune responses (Steinman 1991, 
Boczkowski, Nair et al. 1996, Steinman 2003). DC have been used in the past by 
[CONTACT_260736] , and then returning 
antigen loaded DC to the patient to stimulate anti- tumor immunity. Clinical trials 
of DC immunotherapy have suggested this approach can result in significant stimulation of the immune response against many different forms of cancer.  
The presence of DC within the graft and an associated graft -versus- lymphoma 
response in transplant patients has suggested a role for dendritic cell -based 
vaccines in treating NHL (Hsu, Benike et al. 1996, Dean, Masci et al. 2005, Inoges, Rodriguez-Calvillo et al. 2006, Di Nicola, Zappasodi et al. 2009) . DC 
immunotherapy consists of exposing dendritic cells to tumor antigen and using the antigen- loaded DC as a vaccine to stimulate anti- tumor response.  
1.[ADDRESS_317016] many different forms of cancer 
MC1685 11 Addendum 8 
Version: 17Jun2021  have been encouraging in animal models but have had mixed results in clinical 
trials (Rosenberg, Yang et al. 2004) . These trials have been difficult to interpret 
as the methods of DC preparation and the resulting quality of DC used in the trials have varied significantly. Available evidence suggests that the quality of 
the DC preparation used in a vaccination protocol has a substantial impact on the 
immune response elicited (Finkelman, Lees et al. 1996, Steinman 2003, 
Steinman, Hawiger et al. 2003, Yamazaki, Iyoda et al. 2003) . Specifically, the 
functional status of DCs depends on their state of activation at the time they are delivered. Completely activated DC (mature DC or mDC) are able to migrate to 
lymph nodes and initiate stimulation of the immune system in vivo, while 
immature DC can inhibit effector T cell function and induce tolerance (Dhodapkar, Steinman et al. 2001) . Unfortunately, many clinical trials were 
initiated before this distinction came to light and patients received immature DC; inhibiting the immune response instead of stimulating it. Thus, the lack of potent 
immune stimulation and unsatisfactory clinical response demonstrated in earlier 
trials of DC immunotherapy may at least in part be attributable to the functional 
state of the DC employed.  
Many published trials in NHL have utilized immature, potentially tolerizing DC 
(see Table 1). This is likely because lymphoma patients have a largely 
unrecognized yet profound deficiency in the ability to generate mature DC using 
conventional DC generation protocols (Lin, Gustafson et al. 2011, Laborde, Lin 
et al. 2014). We have developed a method that consistently generated highly 
pure, mature DC from NHL patients ex vivo . This culture method is serum -free 
and easily adaptable to scale-up GMP practice. This significant improvement in 
DC vaccines assures the potency and purity of the DC preparation. Thus, we by-
pass the immune suppressive qualities we have identified in lymphoma patients 
by [CONTACT_260737], culturing them to generate potent immune 
stimulatory DC, and injecting these cells back into the patient. This DC manufacturing method was used in LS1081 clinical trial to treat patients with 
newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory indolent B -cell NHL (Table 1). We were 
able to make adequate vaccines to complete treatments for all 15 patients in the study. 
1.43 In situ  DC tumor antigen loading for vaccine therapy  
Differences in loading of DC with antigen in vitro may induce immune tolerance 
rather than stimulation (Steinman 2003, Yamazaki, Iyoda et al. 2003, Marigo, 
Dolcetti et al. 2008). The optimal method for preparation of antigen and antigen 
loading to DC remains to be identified. Animal studies and small clinical trials 
have used whole lymphoma cells, exosomes from heat -shocked lymphoma cells, 
idiotype proteins, and proteoliposomes from tumor cells as antigens (Hsu, Benike 
et al. 1996, Timmerman, Czerwinski et al. 2002, Chen, Wang et al. 2006, Inoges, Rodriguez-Calvillo et al. 2006, Neelapu, Gause et al. 2007, Di Nicola, Zappasodi 
et al. 2009). While idiotype containing unique determinants of variable regions of 
the clonal tumor immunoglobulin molecule offer specific, definitive targets for 
immune monitoring of treatment, immune stimulation against tumor may also be 
limited. The production of idiotype protein with recombinant DNA is also labor and time intensive and likely not practical for widespread clinical use. Whole 
tumor cells or liposome preparations from the tumor cells are easier to generate 
and contain a wider range of epi[INVESTIGATOR_322], but are limited by [CONTACT_260738]. 
MC1685 12 Addendum 8 
Version: 17Jun2021  Route of DC delivery also critically impacts efficacy of DC to stimulate an anti-
tumor response. Inconsistent generation of systemic anti- tumor immune 
responses with intravenous and subcutaneous administration has prompted evaluation of novel delivery approach (Mody, Dubey et al. 2015). Intratumor DC 
delivery was shown to generate anti -tumor immunity and tumor regression in 
animal models (Kim, Sohn et al. 2004, Song and Levy 2005, Lee, Cho et al. 
2006). Clinical trials to date have shown this approach to be safe with promising 
response (Table 1; LS1081 preliminary results) (Kolstad, Kumari et al. 2015) . 
Antigen can be generated in vivo using conventional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_260706], radiation or even cryoablation (Sabel, Arora et al. 2006, Fagnoni, 
Zerbini et al. 2008, Sabel 2009, Kolstad, Kumari et al. 2015) . Recently Kolstad et 
al reported promising results in FL patients treated with radiation, and intra-tumor injection of rituximab and DC ( (Kolstad, Kumari et al. 2015); Table 1). 
Cryoablation is an acceptable clinical option for the targeted destruction of lymphoma masses. It provides an opportunity for generation of tumor antigen in 
vivo, but currently relies on local ability to generate an active immune response. 
In arm A of our phase I clinical trial LS1081, we used cryoablation as a novel 
approach to in situ  lymphoma tumor antigen loading. Patients underwent 
cryoablation of a lymphoma tumor and subsequently received up to eight doses 
of intra -tumor injections of autologous DC over the course of [ADDRESS_317017] 
injection in vivo offers two advantages: delivery of mature DCs into a milieu of 
dying tumor cells, resulting in maximum exposure of tumor cell antigens; and 
avoidance of the suppressive effects of blood monocytes. Systemic response in non-cryoablated tumors was assessed. This combined approach was found to be 
feasible and safe. We will now examine combining this approach with 
pembrolizumab  to enhance clinical efficacy.  
1.[ADDRESS_317018] thus far demonstrated no 
significant adverse events or autoimmunity (Table 1). DC immunotherapy has 
been used for many different tumors types where adverse events (such as induced 
autoimmunity) were monitored. Importantly, very few significant adverse effects of DC vaccination have been reported and DC immunotherapy clinical trials 
performed to date have shown no evidence of resultant generation of auto-immunity. To date, [ADDRESS_317019] common adverse event was injection site pain, more 
often with cryoablation, that usually resolved wit hin 2 days of treatments 
(Table  2).

1.5 Rationale for pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) therapy  
We have found that, compared to healthy donors, NHL patients have significantly 
decreased number of lymphocytes, particularly CD4+ cells (Lin, Gustafson et al. 2011) . 
This combined with the in vitro suppressed immune function argue for T cell stimulation 
to augment immune response with DC vaccine. PCV (Prevnar®) is approved by [CONTACT_260740] T cells to interact with B cells for antibody 
production (Pletz, Maus et al. 2008) . Pneumococcal vaccination has been shown to be 
safe and recommended for cancer patients that will or have undergone chemotherapy (Melcher 2005) . Thus, the use of pneumococcal vaccines presents little if any additional 
risk to the patient. The use of these vaccines does allow determination of the state of the 
immune system and its response to the DC based vaccines. Prevnar has been used in two 
clinical trials for multiple myeloma patients in this manner. These trials included one 
with adoptive T cell transfer after stem cell transplant (Rapoport, Stadtmauer et al. 2005) 
and another with lenalidomide (Noonan et al. ASH Annual Meeting 2008, Blood abstract 
2772). Both trials reported minimal toxicity. In addition there may be a by[CONTACT_260741]- tumor antigens (Mitchell, Batich et al. 2015). 
Preliminary study in our lab showed that Prevnar enhanced mature DC stimulated CD4 T cell proliferation by [CONTACT_3450] 1.75 fold compared to mature DC stimulation alone 
(Figure 1). Importantly, a review of the results of DC therapy in melanoma suggest that 
addition of adjuvant capable of T cell help, significantly improved overall clinical response (Engell-Noerregaard, Hansen et al. 2009, Mitchell, Batich et al. 2015) . We are 
including this vaccine to enable us to monitor the immune response prior to and after our intervention. The vaccine will also allow us to quantify any potential in vivo by[CONTACT_260742]. In the LS1081 study, no 
adverse events were seen with Prevnar administrations.  
 
 
Figure 1. CD4+ T cell proliferation is stimulated with mature dendritic cells pulsed with Prevnar. Monocyte-depleted PBMNC from healthy donors were labeled with 
CFSE and cultured for 7 days without stimulation or with Prevnar, autologous mature 
dendritic cells (mDC), or autologous mDC pulsed with Prevnar. At the end of culture, 
cells were stained with [ADDRESS_317020] in co- culture with Prevnar -pulsed mDC. 
 
1.51 Safety considerations for the use of 13 -valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 
(PCV) therapy  
PCV (Prevnar
®) is approved by [CONTACT_260743] T cells to interact with B cells for antibody production (Pletz, Maus et al. 

MC1685 15 Addendum 8 
Version: 17Jun2021  2008) . Pneumococcal vaccination is considered safe for cancer patients 
undergoing chemotherapy with mild side effects including soreness, low-grade 
fever and induration at the site of vaccination lasting 1-3 days (Melcher 2005) . It 
has been used in two clinical trials for multiple myeloma patients, one with adoptive T cell transfer after stem cell transplant (Rapoport, Stadtmauer et al. 
2005) and another with lenalidomide (Noonan et al. ASH Annual Meeting 2008, 
Blood Abstract #2772). Both trials reported minimal toxicity and some evidence 
of improved immune response. As in Rapoport et al, we will use this 
pneumococcal vaccine to evaluate and monitor the developi[INVESTIGATOR_260707]. 
The proposed Prevnar13 (Prevnar) dosing schedule in this study is similar to the 
Prevnar schedule in LS1081 study. No significant toxicities were observed in 15 patients who received Prevnar along with their DC vaccines. We will use the 
dose administration and timing as approved for use (Prevnar product insert; 
 
 
1.6 
Cryoablation therapy 
1.61   Cryoablation background  
Percutaneous cryoablation systems are currently available from two 
manufacturers including Endocare, Incorporated (Irvine, CA) and Galil Medical 
(St. Paul, MN), each are FDA 510K cleared for treatment of soft -tissue tumors. 
Since 2003, investigators in this study have used cryoablation for the treatment of 
renal, lung, soft tissue, and bone tumors, including treatment of patients enrolled 
in the LS1081 study. Probes may be placed either percutaneously or 
intraoperatively using US or CT image guidance. 
The mechanism of cryoablation is based on delivery of argon gas through a 
segmentally insulated probe with outer diameter ranging from 1.7 – 2.4 mm, with 
expansion of the gas within the probe lumen, resulting in rapid cooling (via Joule Thompson effect). With expansion of the argon gas within the probe, rapid and 
extreme temperature drops are produced along the distal, uninsulated probe shaft 
reaching –[ADDRESS_317021], rapid freezing immediately 
adjacent to the probe results in intracellular ice formation, organelle disruption, 
and subsequent cell destruction. At a further distance from the probe, relative 
gradual cooling causes osmotic differences across the cell membrane with 
secondary cellular dehydration and death. Subsequently, further cell death occurs due to thrombosis of affected blood vessels and resultant ischemic necrosis.  
The size of the iceball varies depending on the length of uninsulated tip, with commonly used cryoprobes generating an iceball of about 3 cm in diameter and 5 
cm in longitudinal length along the probe shaft. The growth and size of the 
iceball can be controlled by [CONTACT_260744]. Given relative cellular tolerance to freezing 
temperatures, cell death occurs within about 3- 5 mm internal to the iceball 
margin (Campbell, Krishnamurthi et al. 1998; Chosy, Nakada et al. 1998). A target lesion is typi[INVESTIGATOR_260708] 10 minutes each, separated by a 5- minute thaw period (Figure 2).

Figure 2. Example of lymphoma tumor cryoablation. Low grade follicular lymphoma 
lesion involving the left kidney (left panel yellow circle) can be seen before and during 
the course of cryoablation (middle panel). The probe used for cryoablation is indicated by 
[CONTACT_260745]. The size and 
predictability of the growth of the ice ball is independent of the tumor source. Right panel 
shows resolution of the lesion after treatment. 
1.62 Safety considerations for cryoablation  
Outside of the liver, complications due to cryoablation are primarily related to 
inadvertent tissue injury at the ablation site. A large experience exists regarding 
percutaneous cryoablation of renal tumors, showing a major complication rate of 
5-8% (Silverman, Tuncali et al. 2005, Littrup, Ahmed et al. 2007, Atwell, Farrell et al. 2008, Atwell, Carter et al. 2012). Similar to RFA, the majority of 
complications are related to local tissue trauma, including hemorrhage in about 
3% of patients. Allowing for a more limited published experience, complications 
following bone and soft tissue ablation are even more infrequent, ranging from 0-
2% (Beland, Dupuy et al. 2005, Ullrick, Hebert et al. 2008, Callstrom, Dupuy et al. 2013) . Unique to cryoablation, compared to RFA, is the ability to visualize the 
cytotoxic ice develop using CT imaging, allow the user to precisely control the volume of tissue treated and minimize adjacent tissue injury (Figure 2). 
Of particular note, a systemic phenomenon called “cryoshock” has been observed 
primarily in the cryoablation of liver tumors. Cryoshock is clinically manifested by [CONTACT_260746], disseminated intravascular coagulation, and multiorgan 
failure, possibly related to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome. This 
syndrome has been seen in about 1% of cases of hepatic cryotherapy and only 
0.04% of prostate cryoablations (Seifert and Morris 1999) . We have used clinical 
cryoablation alone to treat a limited number of patients with lymphomatous tumor masses with no serious safety issues identified. In the LS1081 study, no 
cryoshock or ≥ Grade 3 adverse events were observed with cryoablation 
treatments (Table 1).  
1.7 This Study and Research Hypothesis  
This study is a phase I/II design where the phase I portion will confirm the starting dose 
and regimen of the phase II portion (which is expected to be dose level 1 ) and the phase 
II portion will receive the same regimen as determined by [CONTACT_16646] I portion.  The 
patient population in the phase II portion is  patients with Non -Hodgkin lymphoma.

7.115 Cellular vaccines (DC)  
For DC manufacturing, patients will undergo leukapheresis 
from which monocytes will be collected by [CONTACT_260754].  
Autologous mature dendritic cells (DC) will be prepared for 
administration into cryoablated tumor. DC, the generated mature DC, will be frozen and stored until ready for use. A minimum of 30x10

Version: 17Jun2021  7.[ADDRESS_317072].  
Our general cryoablation technique has been previously 
described (Atwell, Farrell et al. 2008). Due to the extended length of the procedure, requiring the patient to lie still (expected 
duration 45 minutes), sedation will be managed by [CONTACT_260755]. Using ultrasound and/or CT 
guidance, a cryoprobe will be placed in the index lymphoma 
node. The node will be treated using a conventional freeze-thaw-freeze cycle with the endpoint being the generation of an iceball 
that measures no more than 75% of the diameter of the index 
tumor. Specifically, incomplete treatment of the lymphoma 
treatment lesion will significantly minimize the risk of thermal 
injury to adjacent structures, yet still achieve the desired 
cytotoxic cell injury.  
Following the freezing procedure, the cryoprobe will be actively 
warmed and then withdrawn. After the node has thawed, a [ADDRESS_317073]-guidance into the 
ablated portion of the node. The DC will be administered 
through this needle in 10 – 15 divided injections over different areas of the cryoablated region and then flushed with 1ml of sterile saline. Prevnar will be injected into the immediately 
adjacent soft tissues of the cryoablated lesion. The patient will be 
transferred to the radiology recovery area and observed until 
discharge criteria are met prior to dismissal from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]

adjacent to the previously cryoablated lesion. 
Patients will be monitored for 2 hours following cryoablation 
and DC injections or 30 minutes following only DC injections 
for acute toxicity. Known potential toxicity of DC injection 
includes dermatitis, anaphylaxis, allergic reactions such as 
bronchospasm or generalized urticaria, autoimmune reactions, 
bone pain, myalgia/arthralgia, reaction at the site of injection and renal dysfunction.

7.15  Duration of treatment 
MC1685 38 Addendum 8 
Version: 17Jun2021  Duration of treatment is a maximum of 12 months from start of Cycle 1. 
If a patient remains on cycles with a length of 21 days without treatment 
delays, this will be 18 cycles total. If the cycle length is increased due to 
dosing frequency changes or dose delays, the number of cycles will be 
reduced to not exceed 12 months of treatment total. If a patient is 
continuing to benefit from treatment after 12 months, he or she may continue to receive pembrolizumab  every 3 weeks for up to 24 months 
total from start of cycle 1 at the investigator/sponsor discretion. If a patient achieved CR before Cycle 5, the patient will continue through 
Cycle 6 and could stop at the discretion of the treating provider and 
investigator. If a patient achieved CR at or after Cycle 5, the patient could continue treatment for 2 more cycles at the dis cretion of treating 
provider. 
7.16 Dose Limiting Criteria ( DLT ) 
For this protocol, DLT will be defined as an adverse event attributed (definitely, probably, or possibly) to the study treatment during the first 
two cycles of treatment AND meeting the following criteria.

Criteria for Adverse Events  
Note: any adverse event that leads to a permanent discontinuation of the study agent is 
considered a DLT.  
7.17 Dose levels  
The dose level of p embrolizumab  is fixed at 200 mg IV on Day 1 of 
every 21 days. The DLT criteria will be used to determine the 
timing of the subsequent administration of pembrolizumab , not for 
adjustment of the dose level. The dose interval may be increased by 7 days each time, the maximum dosing interval allowed is 8 weeks.  
MC1685 39 Addendum 8 
Version: 17Jun2021  The study involves DC injection at only one dose level, but has 
potentially multiple injections over time. The DLT criteria will be 
used to determine timing of the subsequent administration of DC, 
and not for adjustment of DC dose level. 
Note: This study will not allow dose reduction, only dose 
interval changes.  
7.[ADDRESS_317075] the Study Chair as soon as any DLT occurs . Patients 
who experience DLT will go to observation.   
7.3 Continued p embrolizumab treatment  
Patients may continue on p embrolizumab treatment for 1 year after initial 
treatment is terminated  (please check with Study Chair).  
7.4 Retreatment  
Patients who qualify for retreatment (see Section 13.0 ) will not change dose 
levels and will follow the  original treatment schedule starting at cycle 2. When 
retreating, new baseline disease measurement will be established. The new baseline disease measurement will be the disease measurement at the end of the 
cycle prior to the retreatment.   Patients may receive all DC according to 
schedule as long as they do not have continued progression of disease, develop 
major adverse events, and have  DC available.   
Patients will not undergo any additional leukapheresis for the purpose of manufacturing additional DC .  
7.5 Phase II  
Treatment schedule for phase II will be defined as the treatment regimen from 
the MTD dose schedule in phase I.  
NOTE: Phase II’s  dose schedule will follow  Phase I Dose Level I (See Section 
7.1) 
8.0 Dosage Modification Based on Adverse Events 
8.1 Treatment schedule modifications in patients based on adverse events  
8.11  Patients will be evaluated by [CONTACT_260757].  Determination will be made if the adverse event 
is treatmen t related (possible, probable or definite), i.e. a toxicity  (see 
Section 10; Adverse event monitoring and reporting) . If any adverse 
event has occurred, then the treatment schedule will be modified as in 
8.12, 8.13, or 8.2. For cycles involving only p embrolizumab treatments 
(Cycles 1 and 6-18 for dose level  1 and Cycles 1 and 8-18 for  dose level  
-1), refer to Section 8.2. 
8.12  For G rade 1/2  adverse event during cycles with DC injections ( Cycles 2

newly diagnosed or concurrent medical conditions. All blood products and 
concomitant medications such as antidiarrheals, analgesics, and/or antiemetics received from within [ADDRESS_317087] non -prescription doses. 
9.13 Blood Products and Growth Factors 
Blood products and growth factors should be utilized as clinically warranted 
and following institutional policies and recommendations. The use of growth 
factors should follow published guidelines of the American Society of Clinical 
Oncology; Update of Recommendations for the Use of Hematopoietic 
Colony- Stimulating Factors: Evidence - Based, Clinical Practice Guidelines. J 
Clin Oncol 24(19): 3187-3205, 2006. 
9.2 Suggested supportive care measures for the management of adverse events 
with potential immunologic etiology  
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed 
necessary by [CONTACT_12707].  Suggested supportive care measures for the management of adverse events with potential immunologic etiology are 
outlined below. Where appropriate, these guidelines include the use of oral or 
intravenous treatment with corticosteroids as well as additional anti -
inflammatory agents if symptoms do not improve with administration of corticosteroids. Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased. For each disorder, 
attempts should be made to rule out other causes such as metastatic disease or 
bacterial or viral infection, which might require additional supportive care. The 
treatment guidelines are intended to be applied when the investigator determines 
the events to be related to pembrolizumab.  
Note: if after the evaluation the event is determined not to be related, the 
investigator does not need to follow the treatment guidance (as outlined below). 
Refer to Section 8.0 for dose modification.  
It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, 
endoscopy, or skin photography as part of evaluation of the event.  
• Pneumonitis :  
MC1685 45 Addendum 8 
Version: 17Jun2021  o For Grade 2 events, treat with systemic corticosteroids. When symptoms 
improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over 
no less than 4 weeks. 
o For Grade 3 -4 events , immediately treat with intravenous steroids.  
Administer additional anti- inflammatory measures, as needed.  
o Add prophylactic antibiotics for opportunistic infections in the case of 
prolonged steroid administration.  
• Diarrhea/Colitis :  
Subjects should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with 
or without fever) and of bowel perforation (such as peritoneal signs and 
ileus).   
o All subjects who experience diarrhea/colitis should be advised to drink 
liberal quantities of clear fluids.  If sufficient oral fluid intake is not 
feasible, fluid and electrolytes should be substituted via IV infusion.  For 
Grade 2 or higher diarrhea, consider GI consultation and endoscopy to 
confirm or rule out colitis.  
o For Grade 2 diarrhea/colitis, administer  oral corticosteroids.  
o For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea/colitis,  treat with intravenous steroids 
followed by [CONTACT_78018].   
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. 
• Type 1 diabetes mellitus (if new onset, including diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA]) or ≥Grade 3 Hyperglycemia, if associated with ketosis (ketonuria) or metabolic acidosis (DKA)  
o For T1DM  or Grade 3 -4 Hyperglycemia 
 Insulin replacement therapy is recommended for Type I diabetes mellitus and for Grade 3 -4 hyperglycemia associated with metabolic 
acidosis or ketonuria.  
 Evaluate patients with serum glucose and a metabolic panel, urine ketones, glycosylated hemoglobin, and C-peptide.  
• Hypophysitis : 
o For Grade 2  events, treat with corticosteroids. When symptoms improve 
to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no 
less than 4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate hormones may be 
required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
o For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroids 
followed by [CONTACT_78019]. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 
weeks. Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the 
steroid dose is tapered. 
• Hyperthyroidism or Hypothyroidism :  
Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment. Monitor patients 
for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during 
treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs 
MC1685 46 Addendum 8 
Version: 17Jun2021  and symptoms of thyroid disorders. 
o Grade 2  hyperthyroidism events (and Grade 2 -4 hypothyroidism):  
 In hyperthyroidism, non- selective beta-blockers (e.g. propranolol) 
are suggested as initial therapy.  
 In hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone replacement therapy, with 
levothyroxine or liothyronine, is indicated per standard of care. 
o Grade 3 -4 hyperthyroidism  
 Treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroid followed by [CONTACT_78019]. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid 
taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. 
Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
• Hepatic : 
o For Grade 2  events, monitor liver function tests more frequently until 
returned to baseline values (consider weekly). 
 Treat with IV or oral corticosteroids 
o For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with intravenous corticosteroids for 24 to 48 
hours.  
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, a steroid taper should be 
started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. 
• Renal Failure or Nephritis : 
o For Grade 2  events, treat with corticosteroids.  
o For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with systemic corticosteroids.  
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be 
started and continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
• Management of Infusion Reactions :  
Signs and symptoms usually develop during or shortly after drug infusion 
and generally resolve completely within 24 hours of completion of infusion.  
Table 9.51 below  shows treatment guidelines for subjects who experience an 
infusion reaction associated with administration of pembrolizumab.

vasectomy or due to an underlying medical conditi on). 
Female subjects will be considered of non -reproductive potential if they 
are either:  
(1) postmenopausal (defined as at least 12 months with no menses 
without an alternative medical cause; in women < 45 years of age a 
high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal 
range may be used to confirm a post- menopausal state in women not 
using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. In the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement 
is insufficient.);  
OR  
(2) have had a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_139595]/occlusion, at least 6 weeks 
prior to screening;  
OR  
(3) has a congenital or acquired condition that prevents childbearing. 
Female and male subjects of reproductive potential must agree to avoid becoming pregnant or impregnating a partner, respectively, while 
receiving study drug and for [ADDRESS_317090] dose of study drug by 
[CONTACT_260759]: 
(1) practice abstinence
† from heterosexual activity;  
OR  
(2) use (or have their partner use) acceptable contraception  during 
heterosexual activity. 
Acceptable methods of contraception are‡: 
Single method (one of the following is acceptable): 
• intrauterine device (IUD) 
• vasectomy of a female subject’s male partner  
• contraceptive rod implanted into the skin 
 
Combination method (requires use of two of the following):  
• diaphragm with spermicide (cannot be used in conjunction with 
cervical cap/spermicide)  
• cervical cap with spermicide (nulliparous women only)   
• contraceptive sponge (nulliparous women only)  
• male condom or female condom (cannot be used together) 
• hormonal contraceptive: oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]

Version: 17Jun2021  contraceptive injection  
†Abstinence (relative to heterosexual activity) can be used as the sole 
method of contraception if it is consistently employed as the subject’s 
preferred and usual lifestyle and if considered acceptable by [CONTACT_260760]/IRBs. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, 
ovulation, sympto- thermal, post -ovulation methods, etc.) and withdrawal 
are not acceptable methods of contraception.  
‡If a contraceptive method listed above is restricted by [CONTACT_13125]/guidelines, then it does not qualify as an acceptable method 
of contraception for subjects participating at sites in this country/region. 
Subjects should be informed that taking the study medication may 
involve unknown risks to the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy w ere to 
occur during the study. In order to participate in the study subjects of 
childbearing potential must adhere to the contraception requirement 
(described above) from the day of study medication initiation (or 14 days 
prior to the initiation of study medication for oral contraception) 
throughout the study period up to [ADDRESS_317091]’s status until the pregnancy has been completed or terminated.  
The outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to the Sponsor and to 
[COMPANY_006] without delay and within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 
working days to [COMPANY_006] if the outcome is a serious adverse experience (e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life-
threatening complicat ion to the mother or newborn). 
The study investigator will make every effort to obtain permission to follow the outcome of the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus 
or newborn to the Sponsor. If a male subject impregnates his female partner the study personnel at the site must be informed immediately and 
the pregnancy reported to the Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006] and followed as described above.

CTCAE term (AE description) and grade: The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) version 4.[ADDRESS_317094] access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0. A copy of the 
CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site: 
 
a. Identify the grade and severity of the event using the CTCAE version 4.0. 
b.
 Determine whether the event is expected or unexpected (see Section 10.2). 
c. Determine if the adverse event is related to the study intervention (agent, 
treatment or procedure) (see Section 10.3). 
d. Determine whether the event must be reported as an expedited report. If yes, determine the timeframe/mechanism (see Section 10.4).  
e. Determine if other reporting is required (see Section 10.5). 
f. Note: All AEs reported via expedited mechanisms must also be reported via the routine data reporting mechanisms defined by [CONTACT_760] (see Sections 10.6 and 18.0).  
NOTE: A severe AE is NOT the same as a serious AE, which is defined in 
Section 10.4. 
10.2 Expected vs. Unexpected Events  
Expected events - are those described within the Section 15.0 of the protocol, the 
study specific consent form, package insert (if applicable), and/or the investigator 
brochure, (if an investigator brochure is not required, otherwise described in the 
general investigational plan).  
Unexpected adverse events or suspected adverse reactions are those not listed in 
Section 15.0 of the protocol, the study specific consent form, package insert (if 
applicable), or in the investigator brochure (or are not listed at the specificity or 
severity that has been observed); if an investigator brochure is not required or 

MC1685 52 Addendum 8 
Version: 17Jun2021  available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general 
investigational plan.  
Unexpected  also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are 
mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs but 
have not been observed with the drug under investigation. 
An investigational agent/intervention might exacerbate the expected AEs associated with a commercial agent. Therefore, if an expected AE (for the 
commercial agent) occurs with a higher degree of severity or specificity, 
expedited reporting is required. 
NOTE: *The consent form may contain study specific information  at the 
discretion of the Principal Investigator; it is possible that this information may 
NOT be included in the protocol or the investigator brochure. Refer to protocol 
or IB for reporting needs.  
10.3 Attribution to agent(s) or procedure  
When assessing whether an adverse event (AE) is related to a medical agent(s) 
medical or procedure, the following attribution categories are utilized:  
Definite - The AE is clearly related to the agent(s)/procedure.  
Probable - The AE is likely related to the agent(s)/procedure.  
Possible - The AE may be related to the agent(s)/procedure. 
Unlikely - The AE is doubtfully related to the agent(s)/procedure.  
Unrelated - The AE is clearly NOT related to the agent(s)/procedure.  
10.31 EXPECTED Serious Adverse Events: Protocol Specific Exceptions to Expedited Reporting 
For this protocol only, the following Adverse Events/Grades are 
expected to occur within this population and do not require Expedited 
Reporting. These events must still be reported via Routine Reporting (see 
Section 10.6).* 
*Report any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious 
suspected adverse reaction (at your study site) over that which is listed in 
the protocol or investigator brochure as an expedited event.  
*Report an expected event that is greater in severity or specificity than 
expected as an expedited event.

10.5 Other Required Reporting  
10.51  Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others 
(UPI[INVESTIGATOR_15885])  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others 
(UPI[INVESTIGATOR_15885]) in general, include any incident, experience, or outcome 
that meets all  of the following criteria: 

MC1685 55 Addendum 8 
Version: 17Jun2021  1. Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the 
research procedures that are described in the protocol -related 
documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol and 
informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject 
population being studied;  
2. Related or possibly related to participation in the research (in this 
guidance document, possibly related means there is a reasonable 
possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and  
3. Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk 
of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social 
harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
Some unanticipated problems involve social or economic harm instead of 
the physical or psychological harm associated with adverse events. In 
other cases, unanticipated problems place subjects or others at increased risk of harm, but no harm occurs.  
Note: If there is no language in the protocol indicating that pregnancy is 
not considered an adverse experience for this trial, and if the consent form does not indicate that subjects should not get pregnant/impregnate 
others, then any pregnancy in a subject/patient or a male patient’s partner 
(spontaneously reported) which occurs during the study or within 120 
days of completing the study should be reported as a UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845]. 
Mayo Clinic Cancer Center (MCCC) Institutions:  
If the event meets the criteria for IRB submission as a Reportable 
Event/UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845], provide the Reportable Event coversheet and 
appropriate documentation to  
The Mayo Regulatory Affairs Office will review and process the 
subm
ission to the Mayo Clinic IRB. 
10.52 Death  
N
ote: A death on study requires both routine and expedited 
reporting regardless of causality, unless as noted below. Attribution to treatment or other cause must be provided.  
Any death occurring within [ADDRESS_317101] dose, regardless of 
attribution to an agent/intervention under an IND/IDE requires expedited 
reporting within 24-hours. 
Any death occurring greater than 30 days with an attribution of possible, probable, or definite to an agent/intervention under an IND/IDE requires 
expedited reporting within 24-hours. 
Reportable categories of Death   
• Death attributable to a CTCAE term.  
• Death Neonatal: A disorder characterized by [CONTACT_260764] 28 days of life.  
• Death NOS: A cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE term associated with Grade 5.  

MC1685 56 Addendum 8 
Version: 17Jun2021  • Sudden death NOS: A sudden (defined as instant or within one hour 
of the onset of symptoms) or an unobserved cessation of life that 
cannot be attributed to a CTCAE term associated with Grade 5.  
• Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 
“Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts 
and polyps) – Other (Progressive Disease)” under the system 
organ class (SOC) of the same name. Evidence that the death was a manifestation of underlying disease (e.g., radiological changes suggesting tumor growth or progression: clinical deterioration 
associated with a disease process) should be submitted.  
Per NIH OBA Appendix M, should a patient die during the study or 
study follow -up, no matter what the cause, the study doctor will ask the 
patient’s family for permission to perform an autopsy. If permission is 
granted, a copy of the autopsy report will be sent to the sponsor after all 
identifying information has been removed. An autopsy will help the 
researchers learn more about the safety and efficacy of the treatment. 
Patients should advise their families about their wishes regarding 
autopsy. 
10.53 Secondary Malignancy  
• A secondary malignancy  is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a 
previous malignancy (e.g., treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary 
malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm.  
• All secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an 
agent under an IND/IDE will be reported. Three options are available 
to describe the event: 
o Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., Acute 
Myeloctyic Leukemia [AML])  
o Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
o Treatment -related secondary malignancy 
• Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol.  
10.54 Second Malignancy  
A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy). 
Second malignancies require ONLY routine reporting unless otherwise 
specified . 
10.[ADDRESS_317102] (or female partner of a male subject) taking investigational product becomes pregnant, the subject taking should 
notify the Investigator, and the pregnant female should be advised to call 
her healthcare provider immediately. The patient should have appropriate follow-up as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_140711]. If the baby [CONTACT_170727] 
a birth defect or anomaly, a second expedited report is required.  
Prior to obtaining private information about a pregnant woman and her 
MC1685 57 Addendum 8 
Version: 17Jun2021  infant, the investigator must obtain consent from the pregnant woman 
and the newborn infant’s parent or legal guardian before any data 
collection can occur. A consent form will need to be submitted to the 
IRB for these subjects if a pregnancy occurs. If informed consent is not 
obtained, no information may be collected. 
In cases of fetal death, miscarriage or abortion, the mother is the patient. 
In cases where the child/fetus experiences a serious adverse event other 
than fetal death, the child/fetus is the patient.  
NOTE: When submitting Mayo Expedited Adverse Event Report reports for “Pregnancy”, “Pregnancy loss”, or “Neonatal loss”, the potential risk 
of exposure of the fetus to the investigational agent(s) or chemotherapy agent(s) should be documented in the “Description of Event” section. 
Include any available medical documentation. Include this form: 
 
10.551
 Pregnancy 
P
regnancy should be reported in an expedited manner as 
Grade 3 “Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions 
- Other (pregnancy)”  under the Pregnancy, puerperium and 
perinatal conditions SOC. Pregnancy should be followed until the outcome is known. 
10.552 Fetal Death  
Fetal death is defined in CTCAE as “A disorder characterized by [CONTACT_260765]; failure of the product of conception to show 
evidence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], heartbeat, or definite movement of a 
voluntary muscle after expulsion from the uterus, without 
possibility of resuscitation.” 
Any fetal death should be reported expeditiously, as Grade 4 
“Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions - Other 
(pregnancy loss)” under the Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions SOC. 
10.553 Death Neonatal  
Neonatal death, defined in CTCAE as “A disorder characterized by [CONTACT_52372] 28 
days of life” that is felt by [CONTACT_166124]/intervention, should 
be reported expeditiously.  
A neonatal death should be reported expeditiously as Grade 4 
“General disorders and administration - Other (neonatal 
loss)”  under the General disorders and administration SOC.

MC1685 59 Addendum 8 
Version: 17Jun2021  10.8 [COMPANY_006] Additional Event Reporting Instructions  
For the time period beginning when the consent form is signed until treatment 
allocation, any serious adverse event, or follow up to a serious adverse event, 
including death due to any cause other than progression of the cancer under study 
(reference Section 10.10.1 for additional details) that occurs to any subject must be reported within [ADDRESS_317103] initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier, any serious adverse event, 
or follow up to a serious adverse event, including death due to any cause other 
than progression of the cancer under study (reference Section 10.10.1 for 
additional details), whether or not related to the [COMPANY_006] product, must be reported 
within [ADDRESS_317104] be followed up for outcome. 
10.81 Definition of an Overdose for This Protocol and Reporting of Overdose 
to the Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006] 
For purposes of this trial, an overdose of p embrolizumab will be defined 
as any dose of 1,000 mg or greater (≥5 times the indicated dose). No 
specific information is available on the treatment of overdose of 
pembrolizumab. Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if 
clinically indicated. In the event of overdose, the subject should be 
observed closely for signs of toxicity. Appropriate supportive treatment 
should be provided if clinically indicated. 
If an adverse event(s) is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of 
a [COMPANY_006] product, the adverse event(s) is reported as a serious adverse 
event, even if no other seriousness criteria are met.  
If a dose of [COMPANY_006]’s product meeting the protocol definition of overdose is taken without any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal 
laboratory results, the overdose is reported as a non- serious Event of 
Clinical Interest (ECI), using the terminology “accidental or intentional 
overdose without adverse effect.” 
All reports of overdose with and without an adverse event must be 
reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days hours 
to [COMPANY_006] Global Safety.  
 
10.82 Reporting of Pregnancy and Lactation to the Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006]  

MC1685 60 Addendum 8 
Version: 17Jun2021  Although pregnancy and lactation are not considered adverse events, it is 
the responsibility of investigators or their designees to report any 
pregnancy or lactation in a subject (spontaneously reported to them), 
including the pregnancy of a male subject's female partner that occurs 
during the trial or within [ADDRESS_317105] be followed to the 
completion/termination of the pregnancy. Pregnancy outcomes of 
spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, benign hydatidiform mole, 
blighted ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, miscarriage and stillbirth must be reported as serious events (Important Medical Events). If the 
pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health of infant) must also be 
reported. 
Such events must be reported within [ADDRESS_317106] (ECI) and must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to [COMPANY_006] Global Safety.  
 
For the time period beginning when the consent form is signed until treatment allocation/randomization, any ECI, or follow up to an ECI, that 
occurs to any subject must be reported within [ADDRESS_317107] 
to be excluded from the trial, or is the result of a protocol -specified 
intervention, including but not limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure.  
For the time period beginning at treatment allocation/randomization 
through [ADDRESS_317108] for this trial include:  
1. an overdose of [COMPANY_006] product, as defined in Section 10.[ADDRESS_317109] of protocol-specified laboratory testing or unscheduled laboratory testing.* 
*Note:   These criteria are based upon available regulatory guidance 
documents. The purpose of the criteria is to specify a threshold of 

MC1685 61 Addendum 8 
Version: 17Jun2021  abnormal hepatic tests that may require an additional evaluation for an 
underlying etiology.  
10.84 Protocol- Specific Exceptions to Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
Efficacy endpoints as outlined in this section will not be reported to 
[COMPANY_006] as described in Section 10.1.- Immediate Reporting of Adverse 
Events to the Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006], unless there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the drug and the event. Any such event will 
be submitted to the Sponsor within 24 hours and to [COMPANY_006] Global Safety within 2 working days either by [CONTACT_131008]. 
Specifically, the suspected/actual events covered in this exception 
include any event that is disease progression of the cancer under study.  
The Sponsor will monitor unblinded aggregated efficacy endpoint events and safety data to ensure the safety of the subjects in the trial. Any 
suspected endpoint which upon review is not progression of the cancer 
under study will be forwarded to [COMPANY_006] Global Safety as a SAE within 2 
working days of determination that the event is not progression of the 
cancer under study  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77989] (e.g. transportation issues etc.) 
will not be considered a SAE. 
10.85 Sponsor Responsibility for Reporting Adverse Events 
All Adverse Events will be reported to regulatory authorities, IRB/IECs 
and investigators in accordance with all applicable global laws and 
regulations.  
10.[ADDRESS_317110] malfunction is defined as a failure of the device to meet its 
performance specifications, essential function or otherwise perform as intended. Performance specifications include all claims made in the 
labelling for the device. The essential function of a device refers not only 
to the device's labelled use, but for any use widely prescribed within the 
practice of medicine.  
10.92 Reporting of Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events and Device

MC1685 63 Addendum 8 
Version: 17Jun2021  11.0 Treatment Evaluation 
NOTE:  For assessment of  index ( target) and non -target lesions on whole body scan 
performed after completion of DC treatment, the baseline whole body scan will 
be used to assess overall treatment response of index (target) and non -target 
lesions. Include up to 6  index (target) lesion s as measurable disease when 
assessing overall clinical response. The treatment lesion(s) is the lesion(s) that is 
cryoablated. This treatment lesion will be measured only at baseline and will not be included in assessment of overall clinical response, and will not be 
followed or measured . 
NOTE:  Subject(s) with progressive disease on anti -PD-1 monoclonal antibody alone 
prior to receiving cryoablation and intra-tumor injection of autologous DC will 
be continued on treatment to assess clinical response with the addition of these 
therapy as long as the provider and the investigator deemed clinically safe and reasonable.  
11.1 Response Considerations  
Schedule of Evaluations:  PET/CT or whole body CT scans are required at baseline for 
all patients. For the purposes of this study, patients should be reevaluated for disease 
progression at the end of each cycle. In addition to a baseline PET/CT scan, confirmatory 
scans should also be obtained at Day 1 of C ycles 4, 8, 12 and 18 (Section 4).  During 
observation, CT scan should be obtained every [ADDRESS_317111] year to evaluate for disease progression. 
Definitions for clinical response for patients with lymphoma are from the recently revised 
Cheson’s et al criteria published in 2014 (Cheson, Fisher et al. 2014) , derived from the 
original criteria published in 2007 (Cheson 2007). Lymph node measurements should be 
taken from the CT portion of the PET/CT, or other dedicated CT scans where applicable.  
Measurement of lymphadenopathy for purposes of assessing for PR will be determined by [CONTACT_260767] (SPD).  The [COMPANY_003] of a single node is sufficient to evaluate for PD (see Table 11.2).  
Measurable extranodal disease should be assessed in a manner
 similar to that for nodal 
disease. For these recommendations, the spleen is considered nodal disease. Disease that 
is only assessable (eg, pleural effusions, bone lesions) will be recorded as present or 
absent only, unless, while an abnormality is still noted by [CONTACT_260768], it is found to be histologically and pathologically negative. 
Response is based on PET/CT based on the revised 2014 Lugano Classification (Cheson, 
Fisher et al. 2014).

preferable to consider a score of 3 as inadequate response (to avoid undertreatment). Measured dominant 
lesions: Up to six of the largest dominant nodes, nodal masses, and extranodal lesions selected to be

palpation. Nonmeasured lesions: Any disease not selected as measured, dominant disease and truly 
assessable disease should be considered not measured. These sites include any nodes, nodal masses, and 
extranodal sites not selected as dominant or measurable or that do not meet the requirements fo r

be confirmed  and followed  by [CONTACT_9661]. In Waldeyer’s ring or in extranodal sites (eg, GI tract, liver, 
bone marrow), FDG uptake may be greater than in the mediastinum with  complete metabolic response, 
but  should be no higher than surrounding normal physiologic uptake (eg, with  marrow  activation as a 
result  of  chemotherapy or myeloid growth factors).

new areas of uptake unlikely to be related to lymphoma.  
Note: Transformation to a more aggressive histology that requires a change in active treatment will be 
considered progressive disease.  
 
11.21 Complete Response (CR).  
The designation of CR requires all of the following: 
11.[ADDRESS_317117] to normal 
size (≤1.[ADDRESS_317118] transverse diameter for nodes >1.5 cm before therapy). Previously involved nodes that were 1.[ADDRESS_317119] decreased to ≤1.0 cm in their short axis after treatment.  
 11.213 The spleen and/or liver, if considered enlarged before therapy on the 
basis of a physical examination or CT scan, should not be palpable on 
physical examination and should be considered normal size by [CONTACT_99307], and nodules related to lymphoma should disappear. However, 
determination of splenic involvement is not always reliable because a spleen considered normal in size may still contain lymphoma, whereas 
an enlarged spleen may reflect variations in anatomy, blood volume, the 
use of hematopoietic growth factors, or causes other than lymphoma. 
Similarly, other organs considered to be enlarged before therapy due to 
involvement by [CONTACT_56927], such as liver and kidneys, must have decreased in size.  
 
 
MC1685 67 Addendum 8 
Version: 17Jun2021  11.[ADDRESS_317120] be adequate (with a 
goal of >20 mm unilateral core). If the sample is indeterminate by [CONTACT_5293], it should be negative by [CONTACT_9064]. A sample 
that is negative by [CONTACT_248288] a small population of clonal lymphocytes by [CONTACT_127891] a 
CR until data become available demonstrating a clear difference in 
patient outcome.  
11.22 Criteria for Partial Response (PR)  
The designation of PR requires all of the following: 
11.[ADDRESS_317121] a 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) 
of up to six of the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. These 
nodes or masses should be selected according to all of the following:  
• they should be clearly measurable in at least 2 perpendicular dimensions 
• if possible they should be from disparate regions of the body  
• they should include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever these sites are involved  
11.[ADDRESS_317122] regress by ≥50% in their SPD or, for single nodules, in the greatest transverse diameter.  
11.224 With the exception of splenic and hepatic nodules, involvement of 
other organs is usually assessable and no measurable disease should be 
present. 
11.225 Bone marrow assessment is irrelevant for determination of a PR if the sample was positive before treatment. However, if positive, the cell type should be specified (eg, large- cell lymphoma or small neoplastic 
B cells). Patients who achieve a CR by [CONTACT_86950], but who have persistent morphologic bone marrow involvement will be considered 
partial responders.  
When the bone marrow was involved before therapy and a clinical CR 
was achieved, but with no bone marrow assessment after treatment, 
patients should be considered partial responders. 
11.[ADDRESS_317123] criteria should be used. 
 
11.23 Criteria for Stable Disease (STAB)

MC1685 68 Addendum 8 
Version: 17Jun2021  11.24 Relapsed Disease (after CR)/Progressive Disease (after PR, SD)  
Lymph nodes should be considered abnormal if the long axis is more than 1.5 cm 
regardless of the short axis. If a lymph node has a long axis of 1.1 to 1.5 cm, it 
should only be considered abnormal if its short axis is more than 1.0. Lymph 
nodes ≤1.0 x ≤1.[ADDRESS_317126] a 50% increase from nadir in the SPD of any previously involved nodes, or in a single involved node, or the size of other 
lesions (eg, splenic or hepatic nodules). To be considered progressive 
disease, a lymph node with a diameter of the short axis of les s than 1.[ADDRESS_317127] increase by  50% and to a size of 1.[ADDRESS_317128] a 50% increase in the longest diameter of any single previously 
identified node more than 1 cm in its short axis. 
11.244 Transformation to a more aggressive histology that requires a change 
in active treatment will be considered progressive disease.  
11.3 Other Response Criteria:  
11.31 Cutaneous Response Criteria:  
Lesions will be measured by [CONTACT_260769]. Photographs of the skin lesions, marked with a ruler, will be 
saved/uploaded in QREADS for comparison purposes.    
If all target lesions are cutaneous, then the following modified Lugano criteria 
will be utilized. However, if at least one target lesion is not cutaneous, then the 
cutaneous measurements will be grouped with the target nodal/extranodal lesions 
when calculating the SPD and the response criteria per section 11.2 will be utilized with reference to the table below for cutaneous definitions whenever 
applicable.

11.4  Patient Reported Outcomes: Quality of Life  
11.[ADDRESS_317129] any treatment related decisions.  
11.42  Patients will complete the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – 
Lymphoma (FACT -Lym). This assessment consists of the FACT -General 
(FACT -G) and the 15- item Lymphoma specific subscale.  
The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – General (FACT -G) was 
developed to measure quality of life in cancer patients receiving therapy.  It was 
initially validated using classical test theory (CTT) methodology in a 
heterogeneous sample of 545 patients with cancer, 8% of whom had either leukemia or lymphoma.  The FACT- G is comprised of four subscales: physical 
well-being (PWB; 7- items, score range 0 -28), social/family well- being (SWB; 7-
items, score range 0 -28), emotional well -being (EWB; 6- items, score range 0 -
24), and functional well-being (FWB; 7-items, score range 0-28).  Users of the FACT -G are able to generate an overall score and four subscale scores with 
ranges and distributions that are sample- specific.   All questions in the FACT- G 
use a 5 -point rating scale (0 = Not at all; 1 = A little bit; 2 = Somewhat; 3 = Quite 
a bit; and 4 = Very much).  Provided more than 50% of the items comprising a 
subscale are answered, a subscale score is computed as the prorated sum of the 
item responses for that subscale.   Prorating, which replaces missing values with 
the mean of the completed items for that subscale, has been shown to be an 
acceptable method of imputing missing data in the FACT instruments when more 
than 50% of the items are answered.  The FACT- G total score is computed as the 
sum of the four subscale scores, provided the overall item response is at least 80% (i.e., at least 22 of the 27 items were answered) and has a possible range of 0-108 points.  Negatively worded items are reverse scored prior to summing so 
that higher subscale and total scores indicate better Quality of Life (Cella, Tulsky 
et al. 1993). 
The FACT-Lym adds a lymphoma- specific subscale to the FACT -G.  The 
content in the lymphoma subscale (e.g., “I have night sweats” and “I am bothered 
by [CONTACT_192993]”) is targeted towards patients on active treatment (Hlubocky, Webster 
et al. 2013).

stimulate peripheral blood collected as per the test schedule and assay for anti -
tumor response via proliferation, ELIspot, or intracellular cytokine expression. A change above two times baseline control or more than 30% from assay prior to

Version: 17Jun2021  15.0 Drug Information  
15.1 Pembrolizumab (MK -3475, SCH 900475, Keytruda®) 
15.11 Background 
Pembrolizumab is a potent humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody with high 
specificity of binding to the PD- 1 receptor, thus inhibiting its interaction with 
PD-L1 and PD-L2. Based on preclinical  in vitro  data, p embrolizumab has high 
affinity and potent receptor blocking activity for PD -1. 
15.12 Formulation 
Pembrolizumab is available as a liquid 25 mg/mL, 100 mg/vial.  
15.13 Preparation and storage :  
Vials should be stored in the refrigerator at temperatures between 2-8°C.   
Drug concentrate is further diluted with normal saline (or 5% dextrose) in the 
concentration range of 1 to 10 mg/mL . The infusion solution in the IV bag should 
be immediately administered.  Diluted pembrolizumab solutions may be stored at 
room temperature for a cumulative period of up to [ADDRESS_317139] can also be stored under refrigeration at 2°C to 8°C for no 
more than [ADDRESS_317140] be between 1 and 10 
mg/mL. Maximum rate of infusion should not exceed 6.7 mL/minute through a 
peripheral or indwelling catheter. Flush the line with 0.9% NaCL following the 
completion of the infusion.  
15.15 Pharmacokinetic information:  
a)  Absorption – Because pembrolizumab is administered intravenously, it is immediately and completely bioavailable.  Steady -state concentrations 
of pembrolizumab are reached by 16 weeks of repeated dosing with a Q3W regimen and the systemic accumulation is 2.1-fold.  The peak 
concentration, trough concentration, and area under the plasma concentration versus time curve at steady state of pembrolizumab 
increased dose proportionally in the dose range of 2 to 10 mg/kg Q3W. 
b)  Distribution – Pembrolizumab has a limited volume of distribution.  
c)  Excretion – CL is approximately 23% lower after achieving maximal change at steady state compared with the first dose. The terminal elimination half -life (t½) is estimated to be 22 days at steady state.  
d)  Metabolism - Pembrolizumab is catabolized through non- specific 
pathways; metabolism does not contribute to its CL .

15.2 Dendritic Cells  
15.21 Background: The DC  used in this study is patient’s autologous dendritic cells 
(DC). Dendritic cells are cells manufactured in lab from monocytes removed 
from patients’ blood by [CONTACT_74886]. The dendritic cells need to acquire 
tumor antigens in order to stimulate anti- tumor immunity. Patients will be 
treated with DC placed into a tumor killed using cryoablation where tumor 
MC1685 80 Addendum 8 
Version: 17Jun2021  antigen exposure will occur in vivo .  
15.22.  Formulation: DC  is supplied as recently thawed cells prepared from patient 
material. Cells are manufactured and released by [CONTACT_260772], Mayo Clinic [COMPANY_002]ster. Before released for use, cells will undergo testing 
for sterility and potency.  
15.23  Preparation and storage : DC  will be prepared and stored at the Human Cellular 
Therapy Lab, Mayo Clinic [COMPANY_002]ster according to approved SOPs included in the IND. The drug will be supplied to the appropriate administration area by 
[CONTACT_260773]. 
15.24  Administration: Each patient will undergo percutaneous cryoablation of the lymphoma tumor lesion to a cryoablated size of less than or equal to 2 cm in diameter  equal to 50 – 75% of the index lymphoma lesion. Incomplete treatment 
of the index lymphoma tumor lesion will significantly minimize risk of thermal injury to adjacent structures, yet result in desired cytotoxic cell injury. Our 
general cryoablation technique has been previously described (Atwell, Farrell et 
al. 2008). Patients will be treated at on the 3W CT scanner. Due to the extended 
length of the procedure, requiring the patient to lie still (expected duration 45 
minutes), sedation will be managed by [CONTACT_142258]. Using ultrasound guidance, a cryoprobe will be placed in the index lymphoma node. 
The node will be treated using a conventional freeze- thaw -freeze cycle with each 
freeze stage lasting 10 minutes or until the iceball reaches within 3mm of the outer node margin (as determined by [CONTACT_260774] 2 minute intervals).
 
Following the freezing procedure, the cryoprobe will be actively warmed and 
then withdrawn. After the node has thawed, a 22 G needle will be placed under 
ultrasound-guidance into the ablated portion of the node. The DC  will be 
administered through this needle in 10 – 15 divided injections over different areas of the cryoablated region and then flushed with 1 ml of sterile saline.  
15.25  Pharmacokinetic information : NOTE: this drug is a biologic made up of cells 
from the patient. Classical drug pharmokinetics do not apply. 
15.26  Potential Drug Interactions: Unknown. 
15.27  Known potential toxicities : Unknown.

15.3 Pneumococcal 13 -valent Conjugate Vaccine (Prevnar13)  
15.31  Background: Pneumococcal 13-valent Conjugate Vaccine (Diphtheria CRM
197 
Protein), is a sterile solution of saccharides of the capsular antigens of 
Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 
19F and 23F individually linked to non- toxic diphtheria CRM 197 protein. Each 
serotype is grown in soy peptone broth.  
Potency of the formulated vaccine is determined by [CONTACT_260775], and by [CONTACT_260776]. 
15.32  Formulation: Supplied as ready- to-use prefilled syringes (10 x 0.5- mL prefilled 
syringes per package). Pneumococcal 13- valent Conjugate Vaccine is 
manufactured as a liquid preparation for intramuscular injection. Each 0.5 mL 

MC1685 81 Addendum 8 
Version: 17Jun2021  dose of the vaccine is formulated to contain approximately 2.2 μg of each of 
Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 
23F saccharides, 4.4 μg of 6B saccharides, 34 μg CRM 197 carrier protein, 100 μg 
polysorbate 80, 295 μg succinate buffer and 125 μg aluminum as aluminum phosphate adjuvant.  
15.33  Preparation and storage : Pneumococcal 13 -valent Conjugate Vaccine is stored at 
refrigerated temperatures of 2ºC to 8ºC (36ºF to 46ºF) away from freezer 
compartment. DO NOT FREEZE. Discard if frozen.  
15.34 Administration: Shake vigorously immediately prior to use to obtain a uniform 
suspension in the vaccine container. The vaccine should not be used if it cannot 
be resuspended. After shaking, the vaccine is a homogeneous, white suspension. 
Do not mix the vaccine with other products in the same syringe. 
The dose is 0.[ADDRESS_317145] intravenously , 
intradermally or subcutaneously. The vaccine should not be injected in the 
gluteal area or areas where there may be a major nerve trunk and/or blood vessel. 
Before injection, the skin at the injection site should be cleansed and prepared 
with a suitable germicide. After insertion of the needle, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_260721], which will help avoid inadvertent injection into a blood vessel. If blood appears, withdraw the needle and prepare for a new injection at another site.  
15.35 Potential Drug Interactions: Patients receiving therapy with immunosuppressive 
agents (large amounts of corticosteroids, antimetabolites, alkylating agents, cytotoxic agents) may not respond optimally to active immunization.  
As with other intramuscular injections, Pneumococcal 13-valent Conjugate 
Vaccine should be given with caution to patients on anticoagulant therapy. 
See complete prescribing information for information regarding co- 
administration of Pneumococcal 13- valent Conjugate Vaccine with other

population. Please see Prevnar13® prescribing information for comprehensive 
toxicity data. 
The following systemic events were noted within 2- 3 days of the Pneumococcal 
13-valent Conjugate Vaccine injection in pediatric patients: fever, irritability, 
drowsiness, restless sleep, decreased appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, and urticaria-
like rash. The following local reactions occurred within 3 days of immunization pediatric patients: erythema, induration, tenderness and interference with limb 
movement.  
15.37  Drug procurement: Prevnar13 will be purchased with study funds and provided free of charge to patients.  
15.38 Nursing Guidelines: 
15.381 Monitor for injection site reaction. Local reaction is usually seen within 3 
days of vaccination, including erythema, induration and tenderness. Treat 
symptomatically and monitor for signs on infection.

MC1685 83 Addendum 8 
Version: 17Jun2021  16.0 Statistical Considerations and Methodology  
16.1 Overview:  
This is a phase I/II study of dendritic cell therapy and Pembrolizumab  for patients with 
non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. The Phase I portion utilizes a 3+3 design with dose de-
escalation only to identify the MTD of this treatment regimen. In this study, MTD means 
the maximum tolerated dose level/ schedule. The Phase II portion is designed as an open-
label study of patients  having non-Hodgkin lymphoma. 
16.11 Primary Endpoint:  
The primary endpoint of the phase I portion of this trial is to assess DLT to 
determine the maximum tolerated dose level/schedule (MTD). For the phase II 
portion of this trial the pembrolizumab  primary endpoint is the clinical response 
of combination therapy with pembrolizumab, cryoablation and intra -tumor 
injection of autologous DC at MTD dose schedule. 
A success will be defined as a confirmed response: PR or CR. Throughout 
Section 16.0, PR or CR will be considered synonymous with “success” in the 
phase II portion, unless specified otherwise.  
16.12  Sample Size  
The phase I portion of this study is expected to require a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 12 evaluable patients. The 3 or 6 patients treated at the MTD in the 
phase I portion will also be included in the phase II portion.  
A maximum of 28 additional evaluable patients will be accrued at the MTD dose 
level for a maximum of 34 evaluable patients in the phase II portion of this study. 
We anticipate accruing up to 4 additional patients (1 phase I, 3 phase II) to account for ineligibility, cancellation, major treatment violation, or other reasons. 
Therefore, a maximum of [ADDRESS_317146] 12 months.  
16.2 Phase I Portion  
16.21  Study Design 
The phase I study is designed to determine MTD and toxicity profile of dendritic 
cell therapy and pembrolizumab for patients with non- Hodgkin l ymphoma using 
a 3+3 design with dose de-escalation only. Three patients will be treated at dose level 1 and observed for a minimum of six weeks (i.e. two full cycles and 
completion of C ycle 2 with pembrolizumab , cryoablation, and intra- tumor DC 
injection) before new patients are treated. Doses will not be escalated in any 
individual patient.  
MC1685 84 Addendum 8 
Version: 17Jun2021  16.[ADDRESS_317147] 
of patients ( 1 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients). A total of [ADDRESS_317148] 25% will be observed with a probability of 
at least 82% (1 -(1-0.25) 6). Refer to Section 7.[ADDRESS_317149] cohort of three patients will be treated at dose 
level 1 and observed for 1 cycle of combination of Pembrolizumab , cryoablation, 
and intra- tumor DC injection (completion of Cycle 2) to assess toxicity. 
Decisions on when and how to dose de- escalate are described below.  
16.231  If DLT (see Section 7.6) is not observed in any of the [ADDRESS_317150] one additional DLT is observed in the new cohort of patients treated at dose level  1, then the next 3 patients will be treated at dose 
level -1. 
i) If DLT is not observed in any of the 3 patients treated at dose level  
-1, then dose level -1 will be considered the MTD.  
ii)  If DLT is observed in 1 of 3 patients treated at dose level -1, then 
3 additional patients will be treated at this dose level . If no 
additional DLT is observed in the new cohort of patients treated at dose level -1, then dose level -1 will be considered the MTD.  
iii) If DLTs are observed in [ADDRESS_317151] been exceeded. 
16.233  If DLT is observed in more than one of the 3 patients treated at dose level 1, then the next 3 patients will be treated at dose level -1. Decision 
rules for the 3 patients treated at dose schedule 2 follow 16.232 i) – iii) 
as described above.   
16.[ADDRESS_317152] cycle of treatment for reasons other than toxicity, the patient will be regarded as inevaluable and will be 
replaced.  
16.24 Analysis Plans  
All the relevant results pertaining to toxicity, MTD, response, timed endpoints and laboratory correlates will be examined in an exploratory and hypothesis-
generating fashion. The small sample size and the heterogeneous patient 
population associated with phase I studies restricts the generalizability of the 
results. Any notable statistical result should only be viewed as preliminary 
evidence for the Phase II component rather than a definitive finding in and of 
itself.  
MC1685 85 Addendum 8 
Version: 17Jun2021  16.241  Adverse Events / Toxicity Profile (Goal 2.1.11)  
The primary endpoint of the phase I portion is the incidence of dose-
limiting toxicity. A dose-limiting toxicity is defined in section 7.61. 
Toxicities will be assessed using the CTEP Active Version of the 
CTCAE. Non -hematologic toxicities will be evaluated via the ordinal 
CTC standard toxicity grading. Hematologic toxicity measures of 
thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and leukopenia will be assessed using 
continuous variables as the outcome measures (primarily nadir) as well 
as categorization via CTC standard toxicity grading.  
These data will be assessed in evaluating the tolerability of the regimen 
for future studies. All patients meeting the eligibility criteria who have signed a consent form and have begun treatment will be considered 
evaluable for dose-limiting toxicity. Incidence of DLT will be estimated 
by [CONTACT_260777]. No more than three patients will receive the first cycle 
of combination immunotherapy ( Pembrolizumab  and cryoablation and 
DC injections, i.e. Cycle 2 of the overall treatment plan) at any time 
during Phase I of the study. 
For a comprehensive pi[INVESTIGATOR_260722], we will also summarize 
the incidence of other significant toxicities as defined in Section 8 or as a 
Grade 3 or higher adverse event otherwise not described in Section 8, 
that is possibly, probably, or definitely related to treatment. The number 
and severity of all adverse events (overall and by [CONTACT_15994]) will be tabulated and summarized in this patient population. The Grade 3+ 
adverse events will also be described and summarized in a similar 
fashion. This will provide an indication of the level of tolerance for this 
treatment combination in this patient group.  Frequency distributions, 
graphical techniques and other descriptive measures will for m the basis 
of these analyses. Further longitudinal analysis techniques will be 
employed to explore the adverse event profile over time.  
16.242 Feasibility (Goal 2.1.21)  
The feasibility of the regimen will be estimated by [CONTACT_260778].  Patient accrual 
rate and study completion rates will also be evaluated using summary 
statistics to determine if further studies of this regimen will be feasible.  
16.243 Quality of Life (Goal 2.1.22) 
Quality of life as measured using the FACT -Lym will be utilized.  The 
assessment will be scored according the scoring algorithm. Changes from 
baseline will be calculated at each assessment time points. Mean change 
scores at each time point will be calculated to determine if quality of life 
is reduced  over the course of treatment. Longitudinal techniques will be 
employed to describe changes over time.  
16.3 Phase II Portion  
16.31 Decision Rule  
Pembrolizumab  monotherapy induces an ORR of 39% in patients with 
MC1685 86 Addendum 8 
Version: 17Jun2021  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -naïve melanoma by [CONTACT_260779]. The 
potential activity of this agent in non -Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) has not been 
tested. Similar check -point inhibitor Nivolumab (BMS) has reported ORR of 
28% in B -cell NHL (ASH 2014). We estimate that Pembrolizumab  may have 
similar single agent activities in NHL. Therefore we hypothesize that an ORR of 
53% with this combination immunotherapy approach will be worthy of further testing in this disease population. We will explore if there is a difference in 
histologies enrolled in this study.  Any specific NHL type with a clinical response defined as PR or CR in [ADDRESS_317153] ORR where the proposed treatment regimen would be 
considered ineffective in this population is 30 %, and the smallest ORR that 
would warrant subsequent studies with the proposed regimen in this patient population is 53%. The following one- stage design requires 28 evaluable patients 
([ADDRESS_317154] follicular lymphoma) to test the null hypothesis that the true 
ORR in this patient population is at most 30. 
16.311 Interim Analysis: No interim analysis was planned for this study due to 
the following reasons: i) patients will be treated and evaluated for 
response up to two years from enrollment. ii) the total expected accrual 
time for this phase is only 18 – [ADDRESS_317155] reached the primary 
endpoint for analysis.  
16.312  Final Decision Rule: If 12  or fewer of 28 patients achieve overall 
response, then the proposed treatment is considered ineffective; and if 
13 or more patients achieve overall response, then the treatment is conserved promising and warrants further study.  
16.313 Over Accrual: If more than the target number of patients are accrued, the additional patients will not be used to evaluate the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_212240].  If more than the target number 
of patients are accrued, the additional patients will not be used to evaluate the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_15901]; 
however, they will be included in final endpoint estimates and confidence intervals.  
16.314  Power and Significance Level: the power calculation is based solely on 
Phase I I. We plan to accrue a total of 28 evaluable patients (including 
follicular lymphoma patients from the MTD cohort in phase I) for Phase II of the trial. This sample size provides 8 1% power at a one -
sided type I error of 0.05 to conclude that the ORR is higher than 30 % 
if the true ORR is 53%. Secondary analysis will be performed in which 
Bayesian hierarchical models (Thall et al. 2003)
 will be used to 
estimate subtype- specific ORRs for the purposes of examining 
differences in response and guiding future plans for subtype- specific 
expansion studies.  
16.315 Other considerations: Adverse events, quality/duration of response, and 
patterns of treatment failure observed in this study, as well as scientific 
MC1685 87 Addendum 8 
Version: 17Jun2021  discoveries or changes in standard care will be taken into account in 
any decision to terminate the study.  
16.32  Analysis Plan  
16.321  Primary Outcome Analyses: 
16.3211  Definition: The primary endpoint of this trial is the proportion of 
complete responses of combination therapy with pembrolizumab , cryoablation and intra- tumor injection of 
autologous DC at MTD dose schedule. A success is defined as a PR or CR as the objective status during therapy. All patients 
meeting the eligibility criteria who have signed a consent form 
and have begun treatment will be evaluable for response.  
16.3212  Estimation: The proportion of successes will be estimated by [CONTACT_260780]. Confidence intervals for the true success proportion will 
be calculated .  
16.322  Secondary Outcome Analyses:  
These analyses will include all patients meeting the eligibility criteria 
who have signed a consent form and have begun treatment. Analyses will include all patients enrolled in the Phase II portion of the study and 
analysis of each cohort separately.  
16.323  Complete response (Goal 2.2.21): The response rate will be calculated, as above, in each individual cohort as supplementary to the primary 
analysis.  
16. 324  Progression free survival, treatment free survival, and duration of 
response (Goal 2.2.22):  
Survival time is defined as the time from registration to death due to any 
cause. The distribution of survival time will be estimated using the 
method of Kaplan-Meier (Kaplan E 1958). In addition, the overall survival rate at [ADDRESS_317156] achieved a PR or CR as the date at which the patient’s objective status is 
first noted to be a response to the earliest date progression is 
documented. The distribution of duration of complete response will be estimated using the method of Kaplan- Meier.  
16.325 Adverse Events (Goal 2.2.23): All eligible patients that have initiated 
treatment will be considered evaluable for assessing adverse event 
rate(s). The maximum grade for each type of adverse event at each 
evaluation will be recorded for each patient, and frequency tables will be 
reviewed to determine patterns. Additionally, the relationship of the 
adverse event(s) to the study treatment will be taken into consideration.  
Longitudinal analysis techniques will be utilized to determine the effect 
MC1685 88 Addendum 8 
Version: 17Jun2021  of time on treatment adverse events.  
16.326  Quality of Life (Goal 2.2.24): 
Quality of life as measured using the FACT -Lym will be utilized.  The 
assessment will be scored according to the scoring algorithm.  Changes 
from baseline will be calculated at each assessment time points.  Mean 
change scores at each time point will be calculated to determine if quality of life is reduced over the course of treatment.  Longitudinal techniques 
will be employed to describe changes over time. 
16.4 Analysis of other endpoint 
16.41 Definitions and Analyses of Radiologic Endpoints 
Measurements of index lesion(s) (non-cryoablated lesion) will be evaluated over 
time for each patient as a marker of systemic immune and treatment response to 
Pembrolizumab  and localized treatment with cryoablation and DC . The index 
lesion(s) will be selected by [CONTACT_1963]/investigator and are non-cryoablated node. The percent change from baseline in index lesion 
measurements will be assessed over time. Differences in values over time will be 
summarized descriptively and graphically. In addition, patients will be classified 
into one of the following categories based on the best response seen in the index lesion(s):  
● Complete response: disappearance of the node  
● Partial response:  ≥50% of decrease in measured dimension  
● Stable: between 50% decrease to ≤25% increase in dimension  
● Progression: >25% increase in measured dimension 
While the evaluation of index lesion(s) may be part of the assessment of overall 
response, it is not the sole criteria for time to progression. The whole body CT or 
PET/CT will be used to assess overall clinical response and time to progression using the standard Cheson criteria, as detailed in Section 11. 
16.42  Correlative Endpoints  
Change in immunologic correlates before and after vaccination treatment will be evaluated and summarized both quantitatively and graphically. Each of the 
correlative endpoints will be summarized individually, but will also be evaluated 
in terms of their relationships to one another; i.e., we will use Spearman rank 
correlation coefficient to assess the correlations between baseline levels as well as between changes before and after treatment in these immunologic markers. In 
addition, these immunologic markers will be correlated with cancer and 
treatment - related outcomes (e.g. response, toxicities). Relationships will also be 
explored graphically using scatter plots. Given the limited sample size, these analyses will be considered exploratory.  
 
16.5 Data & Safety Monitoring: 
16.51 Routine monitoring of accrual and adverse events will be completed by [CONTACT_260781] a weekly basis to assess patient safety.  
16.52 Formal monitoring of accrual, adverse event, and any endpoint problems that 
might be developi[INVESTIGATOR_260723] (MCCC) Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).  The DSMB is responsible for reviewing accrual and safety data for this trial at least twice a year, based on 
MC1685 89 Addendum 8

the conduct of the trial and in consideration of newly acquired information regarding the adverse event profile of the treatment(s) under investigation. The 
study team may choose to suspend accrual because of unexpected adverse event 
profiles that have not crossed the specified rule below.  
Accrual will be temporarily suspended to this study if at any time we observe 
events considered at least possibly related to study treatment (i.e. an adverse 
event with attribute specified as “possible”, “probable”, or “definite”) that satisfy 
either of the following:  
• Phase I portion:  
• Every 3 patients in the phase I portion of the trial will be monitored 
according to the criteria in Section 7.0 and Section 16.23. 
• Death (other than death related to progressive disease) that occurs within 
30 days of the DC cell infusion. 
• Phase II portion: 
• If [ADDRESS_317157] possibly related to treatment excluding infections.  
•  If after the first [ADDRESS_317158] been treated, 30% of all patients experience a grade [ADDRESS_317159] 
possibly related to treatment excluding infections  
• Death (other than death related to progressive disease) that occurs within 30 days of the DC cell infusion. 
We note that we will review grade 4 and 5 adverse events deemed “unrelated” or 
“unlikely to be related”, to verify their attribution and to monitor the emergence 
of a previously unrecognized treatment- related adverse event.

Ann Arbor Staging for Lymphoma:  
NOTE: The staging does not take into account the grade (growth rate) of the tumor tissue, or prognostic 
factors, such as bulky disease, LDH, age, symptomatic.  See FLIPI  
[INVESTIGATOR_260729]- called extranodal  involvement is not unexpected for lymphoma 
can be reversed with treatment.  
  
 Stage I - disease in single lymph node or lymph node region.  
 Stage II  - disease in two or more lymph node regions on same   
side of diaphragm.   
 
Note: Stage II contiguous  means two or more lymph nodes in close proximity (side by [CONTACT_10167]). 
 Stage III - disease in lymph node regions on both sides of the   
diaphragm are affected.   
 Stage IV  - disease is wide spread, including multiple involvement at   
one or more extranodal (beyond the lymph node) sites, such as the  
bone marrow (which is involved commonly), liver, pleura (thin lining of the lungs).

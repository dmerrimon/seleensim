43.  GENERAL INFORMATION
Objective The objective of the current study is to prospectively evaluate 3-
month clinical outcomes from LASIK performed using the 
Phorcides surgical planning software with Contoura topography-
guided ablation in both eyes of subjects with myopia and myopic 
astigmatism seeking refractive surgery for distance correction.  
Data will be compared to published results for wavefront 
optimized LASIK and LASIK performed with Contoura using 
other refractive algorithms.  
The hypothesis is that use of the Phorcides planning software will
result in a higher percentage of eyes with residual refractive 
cylinder ≤ 0.25D than will be achieved with wavefront-optimized
(WFO) LASIK.  It is also expected that unaided postoperative 
visual acuity and visual symptoms will be improved.

cylinder determined by [CONTACT_263171]-derived 
cylinder.   This has caused some surgeons to abandon the Contoura procedure.  The 
Phorcides Analytical Engine (Phorcides) refractive surgical planning software has 
demonstrated efficacy in addressing this issue.1,2  Use of the Phorcides software is 
expected to simplify surgical planning and improve overall outcomes with topography-
guided ablations; as a result, it may increase use of Contoura in clinical practice.
It is expected that clinical refractive outcomes with Phorcides will be superior to those 
obtained with wavefront-optimized refractive surgery using the same laser that have been
reported in the literature.  It is also expected that results with Phorcides will be superior 
to, and more consistent than, Contoura results reported in the literature that were based on
alternative algorithms.
6.  OBJECTIVE
The objective of the study is to prospectively compare 3-month clinical outcomes of 
LASIK performed using the Phorcides surgical planning software with Contoura 
topography-guided ablation to wavefront-optimized (WFO) LASIK results and Contoura 
results based on other algorithms reported in the literature. 
7.  SUBJECTS

8.  STUDY DESIGN
The study is a prospective, single-arm open clinical trial to evaluate residual refractive 
error and distance visual acuity after excimer laser treatment for the correction of 
refractive error to produce good uncorrected distance vision.  All eyes enrolled will have 
surgery planned with Phorcides and treated using the Contoura topography-guided 
surgery algorithm.
Subjects will be assessed pre-operatively and at [ADDRESS_319968]-
operatively. 
Clinical evaluations at 1 month and 3 months will include measurement of uncorrected 
distance visual acuity (UCDVA), manifest refraction, and corrected distance visual acuity
(CDVA).  At 3 months, corneal aberrations will be measured, and subjects will complete 
a questionnaire evaluating satisfaction with their visual outcome, quality of vision, and 
visual symptoms (light sensitivity, difficulty driving at night, reading difficulty, 
fluctuation in vision, glare, halos, and starbursts).
The primary outcome measure will be the residual refractive cylinder. 
Secondary outcome measures will be the following:
Phorcides Prospective Study Protocol Page 11 of 23
Protocol ML-2020-01 7/15/2020
11●Uncorrected distance visual acuity
●Residual sphere
●Corneal aberrations
●Ocular aberrations, at sites with the appropriate equipment to measure such.
●Satisfaction with the visual outcome, quality of vision, and visual symptoms (light
sensitivity, difficulty driving at night, reading difficulty, fluctuation in vision, 
glare, halos, and starbursts).
Safety measures will be
●Change in corrected distance visual acuity
●Satisfaction with the visual outcome, quality of vision, and visual symptoms (light
sensitivity, difficulty driving at night, reading difficulty, fluctuation in vision, 
glare, halos, and starbursts).
8.2. Methods Used to Minimize Bias 
This is a single-arm study with both eyes of any subject enrolled.  Patients will not be pre
-selected for study inclusion.  Any eligible patient presenting for, and eligible for, 
binocular Contoura treatment may be invited to participate.
The measurement of the postoperative refraction and visual acuity will be conducted in a 
systematic fashion to minimize bias.  Individuals conducting visual acuity measures will 
be refracted with the methodology used in the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy 
Study, with the same level of encouragement to subjects.  Subjective questions will be 
asked in a similar manner to all patients.  Alternatively, at the discretion of the 
investigator, patients may be asked to complete the questionnaire themselves. 
9.  STUDY PROCEDURE
9.1. Informed Consent / Subject enrollment 
No subject will be enrolled into the study who does not meet the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria and does not sign the current approved informed consent document.  Informed 
consent will be obtained prior to collecting any data for the study.  The original signed 
documents will be maintained by [CONTACT_1694] a permanent part of the subject's 
medical records.  A signed copy will be provided to the subject. 
Phorcides Prospective Study Protocol Page 12 of 23
Protocol ML-2020-01 7/15/2020
12Subjects will each receive a rebate of their refractive surgery payment when they 
complete the 3-month visit. This rebate will amount to $250 per eye, so subjects will 
receive a $500 rebate in total.
 9.2. Surgery Procedures
Following a complete ophthalmic examination (history, visual acuity, refraction, slit-
lamp exam, fundus exam, topography), patients who meet inclusion criteria and choose to
participate in the study after informed consent will be brought to the operating room 
where bilateral LASIK will be performed using the techniques routinely used by [CONTACT_263173].  
9.3. Visits and Examinations 
Subjects will participate in five study visits.  Visits will include a preoperative/enrollment
visit (Visit 1), one operative visit (Visit 2), and 3 postoperative visits (Visit numbers 3, 4, 
and 5).  The preoperative visit and operative visit may occur on the same day if a fundus 
exam has been performed within the previous 6 months and the findings are available at 
the time of the preoperative/operative visit.  The visit schedule, visit windows, and 
associated Case Report Forms (CRFs) , are displayed in Table 9.3-1.   Details of each 
study visit, including testing to be conducted, are provided in Table 9.3-4 and below.

No protected health information (PHI) will be included on any CRF, but a separate record
of patient names and study identifying numbers will be maintained at each investigational
site.  
9.3.1. Preoperative 
Subjects who meet inclusion criteria and provide informed consent will undergo 
the following procedures.
▪Medical history
▪Testing as shown in Table 9.3-2 as described in Section 9.4 below
▪Site-specific, routine preoperative procedures and measurements
9.3.2. Operative (Surgery)
Preoperative examination and testing procedures (with the exception of the fundus
examination) may be performed or repeated on the operative day at the discretion 
if the investigator.  A brief slit lamp examination will be performed.  The patient 
will then be brought into the operating room, where bilateral LASIK surgery 
(planned using the Phorcides analytical engine) will be performed with routine 
procedures specific for each site.  
Surgical findings will be recorded and any adverse events/serious adverse events 
(AEs/ SAEs) occurring during surgery will be noted at this visit.  Any other 
problems encountered during surgery and comments regarding surgery will be 
documented. 
Any complications preventing successful completion of surgery will be 
documented, and any subject whose surgery is not completed successfully will be 
excluded from further participation in the study and followed according to 
procedures that are standard for each individual study site. 
Postoperatively, patients will be managed according to standard procedures for 
each individual study site.

study exit.  If no premature exit from the study occurs, the Exit CRF should be 
completed at the end of Visit 5 (3 Months Postoperative). 
9.4. Study Methods and Measurements
All routine testing and basic eye examinations (the usual standard of care for the practice)
should be carried out at each study visit.  Abnormalities should be recorded in the CRF 
“Comment” section.  Specific study examination procedures are outlined below. 
9.4.1. Manifest refraction
Perform a manifest refraction with a high contrast logMAR ETDRS chart under 
photopic lighting conditions (>85 cd/m2).  Document refraction results with 
sphere, cylinder and axis readings using the ETDRS protocol.  If uncorrected 
visual acuity is not improved by [CONTACT_263175], use zero for sphere and 
cylinder and draw a line through the blank for the axis.  All visual acuities should 
be recorded as letters read on the ETDRS chart.
9.4.2. Visual acuity (VA)
Measure uncorrected and corrected distance visual acuity using the MR according
to the ETDRS protocol using 100% contrast letters.  Record visual acuities as 
number of letters read on the ETDRS chart.
9.4.3. Corneal aberrations
Measure the corneal topographic aberrations with the Pentacam analyzer.
9.4.4  Ocular high order aberrations
Measure ocular HOA at sites appropriately equipped to do so.  The device used to
measure HOA’s should be indicated, and a [ADDRESS_319971] complete the subjective questionnaire.

Protocol ML-2020-01 7/15/2020
15Note: Avoid interpreting survey questions for subjects.  That is, avoid re-phrasing 
questions if subjects ask, “What does this mean?”
9.5.  Unscheduled Visits
Unscheduled exams may be conducted at the discretion of the investigator with all 
relevant information from the exam recorded in the source documents and on the 
Unscheduled Visit pages within the CRF booklet.
9.6.  Discontinued Subjects
Discontinued subjects are those who do not have an exit visit or who come into the office
to be exited prior to the scheduled final study visit.  Subjects may be discontinued from 
the study at any time if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], their continued participation in 
the study poses a risk to their health.  The reasons for discontinuation include:
a.Adverse event;
b.Lost to follow-up;
c.Subject decision unrelated to an adverse event;
d.Protocol violation;
e.Treatment failure;
f.Fear of exposure to infectious disease
g.Other.
To ensure the safety of all subjects who discontinue prior to Visit 5, investigators should 
assess each subject and, if necessary, advise them of any therapi[INVESTIGATOR_13265]/or medical 
procedures that might be needed to maintain their health.  Any changes in medical health 
and/or use of concomitant medications should also be captured.
10.  ANALYSIS PLAN
10.1. Analysis Data Sets
All subjects who are enrolled in the study will be evaluated for safety.  Efficacy analyses 
will be performed based on data from those eyes for which uncomplicated LASIK was 
completed.
10.2. Statistical Methodology
All data will be collected by [CONTACT_263176] a spreadsheet.  Subjects will be 
assigned an ID number.  Data analysis will be performed without patient identification.  
Statistical analysis will be performed using standard descriptive statistics and other tests 
as deemed appropriate based on the characteristics of the data to be analyzed.  All 
statistical tests will be two-sided and interpreted at a 5% significance level.  
10.3. General Statistical Considerations
The statistical analyses will be performed using Statistica, version 12 or higher. Any 
statistical tests of hypotheses will employ a level of significance of alpha=0.05.
Phorcides Prospective Study Protocol Page 16 of 23
Protocol ML-2020-01 7/15/2020
1611.  SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIFICATION
The sample size has been chosen to be similar to that for comparable Contoura, WFO, 
WFG and ray tracing LASIK studies published in the peer-reviewed literature.  Each of 
four sites will enroll up to 50 eyes, for a total potential study population of 140 eyes. 
With an expected 10% dropout rate before the 3M visit, 126 eyes would be available for 
analysis.
12. CONFIDENTIALITY/PUBLICATION OF THE STUDY
The existence of this study is confidential and should not be discussed with persons who 
are not involved with the study.  Results will be submitted for publication and 
presentation at national and/or international meetings.  A manuscript will be submitted to 
peer-review journals for publication but there is no guarantee of acceptance.  Presentation
or publication of data from individual sites or a subset of sites involved in the study is 
prohibited.  The company funding this study may review manuscript(s) prior to 
publication, but it may not control their content or the interpretation of the results of the 
study.
All study data will be collected on appropriate Case Report Forms (CRFs).  No protected 
health information will be included on the forms.  CRFs will be retained in the patient’s

13.  QUALITY COMPLAINTS AND ADVERSE EVENTS
All subjects will be monitored for adverse events over the course of the study.  A place to
record any adverse event is included on each case report form.
13.1. General Information
Phorcides Prospective Study Protocol Page 17 of 23
Protocol ML-2020-01 7/15/2020
17An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject who is 
administered. a study treatment regardless of whether the event seems to have a causal 
relationship with the treatment.  An AE, therefore, can be any unfavorable or unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the study treatment, whether or not it is related to the treatment.  In 
clinical studies, an AE can include an untoward medical occurrence occurring at any time
after the informed consent document is signed, including run-in or washout periods, even 
if no study treatment has been administered.
13.2. Monitoring for Adverse Events
At each visit, after the subject has had the opportunity to spontaneously mention any 
problems, the Investigator should inquire about AEs by [CONTACT_263178]. 
13.3. Procedures for Recording and Reporting AEs and SAEs
Subsequent to signing an informed consent form, all untoward medical occurrences that 
occur during the course of the study must be documented on an Adverse Event Form 
(AEF).  A separate AEF must be filled out for each event.  When possible, signs and 
symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology should be documented as one 
comprehensive event.  For each recorded event, the AE documentation must include the 
onset date, outcome, resolution date (if event is resolved), intensity (ie. , severity), any 
action with study treatment taken as a result of the event, and an assessment of the 
adverse event’s relationship to the study treatment.
Nonserious Adverse Events
A nonserious AE is defined as any untoward change in a subject's medical health that 
does not meet serious criteria noted below (e.g., is not life-threatening, does not require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], does not prolong a current hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], is not disabling, etc.).  All 
adverse events must be reported regardless of whether they are related to the study 
treatment or not.
For nonserious adverse events, an AEF containing all available information will be 
collected on a routine basis and submitted to the Medical Monitor before the close of the 
study. 
Serious Adverse Events
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any adverse experience that meets any of the
following criteria:
•Results in death.
•Is life-threatening.
NOTE: Life-threatening means that the subject was at immediate risk of death 
from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction which 
hypothetically might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form.
•Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].
NOTE: In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_263168]/or treatment (usually involving 
Phorcides Prospective Study Protocol Page 18 of 23
Protocol ML-2020-01 7/15/2020
18an overnight stay) that would not have been appropriate in the physician's office 
or an out-patient setting.  Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23918].  If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_40030], the event is serious.  When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” 
occurred, the event should be considered serious.
•Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  Disability is defined as a 
substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.
NOTE: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include 
experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated 
headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, or accidental trauma (e.g., 
sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not 
constitute a substantial disruption.
•Is an important medical event.  An important medical event is an event that may not 
result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_244088], based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the 
subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in the definitions for SAEs.  Examples of such medical events include
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or 
the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
All available information on a serious adverse event(s) and any other associated AE, 
if applicable, must be forwarded to the study coordinator for forwarding to the 
Medical Monitor immediately (i.e., within one working day of the Investigator’s or 
site’s knowledge of the event) as follows:
oIn studies utilizing EDC (electronic data capture), all available information for
the SAE and any associated AE(s) must be entered immediately into the EDC 
system. 
oAdditional information for any applicable event is to be reported as soon as it 
becomes available.
In addition to the reporting of serious adverse events to the study Medical Monitor, the 
SAE must be reported to the IRB/IEC according to their requirements.
The investigator must document all adverse device events (serious and nonserious but 
related) and all serious adverse events (related and unrelated) on the Adverse Device 
Effect and Serious Adverse Event Form. Any device quality complaints will also be 
documented. 
●Both the Quality Complaint Form and the Adverse Device Effect and Serious
Adverse Event Form must be e-mailed immediately to the principal

Further, depending upon the nature of the adverse event (serious or nonserious) or quality
complaint being reported, the study sponsor may request copi[INVESTIGATOR_263170]’s medical records.  The investigator must also report all adverse events and 
quality complaints according to the relevant IRB requirements.
13.3.[ADDRESS_319973] assess the 
causality as Related or Not Related to the medical device under investigation.  An
assessment of causality will also be performed by [CONTACT_263180], as shown below:
Causality
Related An adverse event or quality complaint classified as related may be 
either definitely related or possibly related where a direct cause 
and effect relationship with the medical device has not been 
demonstrated, but there is a reasonable possibility that the adverse 
event or quality complaint was caused by [CONTACT_140289].
Not Related An adverse event or quality complaint classified as not related may
either be definitely unrelated or simply unlikely to be related (i.e., 
there are other more likely causes for the adverse event or quality 
complaint).
Where appropriate, the investigator must assess the intensity (severity) of the 
adverse event as mild, moderate, or severe based on medical judgment with 
consideration of any subjective symptom(s), as defined below: 
Intensity (Severity)
Mild An adverse event is mild if the subject is aware of but can easily 
tolerate the sign or symptom.
Phorcides Prospective Study Protocol Page 20 of 23
Protocol ML-2020-01 7/15/[ADDRESS_319974]’s usual activities.
Severe An adverse event is severe if the sign or symptom is incapacitating 
and results in the subject’s inability to work or engage in their 
usual activities.
The investigator must document any action taken (i.e., medication, intervention, 
or treatment plan) and outcome of the adverse event or quality complaint when 
applicable.
13.4. Follow-Up of Adverse Events and Quality Complaints
The investigator is responsible for providing adequate and safe medical care to subjects 
during the study and for ensuring that appropriate medical care and relevant follow-up 
procedures are maintained after the study.  Any additional data from these follow-up 
procedures must be documented and available to the study coordinator who, with the 
Medical Monitor, will determine when the data need to be documented on the CRFs. 
13.5. Safety Analyses
The type, severity, duration and frequency of reported ocular adverse events will be 
tabulated.  Adverse events will also be summarized for events that were considered 
treatment-related.  
14. GCP, ICH and ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
This study will be conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practices (GCPs), 
including International Harmonization (ICH) Guidelines, and in a manner consistent with
the [ADDRESS_319975] regulations. 
The investigator will obtain appropriate IRB/ethics committee approval prior to initiating 
the study.
The study will be registered with clinicaltrials.gov.

16. CONFIDENTIALITY
No protected health information (PHI), including the patient’s name [CONTACT_18131], 
will be collected for study purposes; to ensure this, no PHI is permitted to be entered on 
any of the Case Report Forms (CRFs).  Subjects will only be identified by [CONTACT_263181], 
and identities will be removed at the initial visit so that there is no further need to protect 
or destroy the information.  Collected information will be used for purposes of this study.
No information will be sold to third parties, though the de-identified data collected may 
be used for additional research. 
17. FINANCIAL AND INSURANCE INFORMATION/STUDY RELATED 
INJURIES
Every effort to prevent study-related injury will be taken by [CONTACT_140291]. 
In the event that a patient is injured as a direct result of the study while following the 
Study Doctor’s instructions and the study requirements, the patient will be instructed to 
contact [CONTACT_140292].  The Study Doctor is to treat the injured subject as 
needed for those injuries caused directly by [CONTACT_98139].  In the event of injury or 
illness caused by [CONTACT_140293] a subject’s participation in this research study, all 
charges for medical care provided to the subject will be billed to his or her insurance 
company.  Neither the Study Doctor nor the Sponsor offer to cover the medical care costs
for injuries or illnesses that are not caused directly by [CONTACT_67300].  The Sponsor

of the study in the consent form.
18. STUDY ENDPOINT CRITERIA
18.1. Patient Completion of Study 
If a study patient has completed the final visit (Visit 5) of the study, he/she is considered 
to have completed the study. 
 18.2. Patient Discontinuation 
Each study patient may voluntarily discontinue the study at any time he/she chooses.  
Study patients who cannot complete the study for administrative reasons (e.g., non-
compliance, failure to meet visit schedule, etc.) will be discontinued from the study.  
Study patients discontinued during the enrollment phase (prior to surgery) of the study 
will be replaced. 
 18.3. Patient Termination 
A study patient will be terminated if the study patient develops any severe adverse event 
that may be related to the study.  A study patient will receive appropriate treatment at the 
discretion of the investigator.  Notification of termination will be clearly documented.  
These study patients are considered to have completed the study and will not be replaced.
18.4. Study Termination
The investigator with appropriate notification may terminate the study.  If, after clinical 
observations, the investigator feels that it may be unwise to continue the study, he may 
stop the study.  
18.5. Study Completion 
The study will be complete when all enrolled patients have completed Visit [ADDRESS_319979] 
been terminated from the study. 
 
19. SUMMARY OF RISKS AND BENEFITS
19.1. Summary of risks
The risks for LASIK surgery in this study (topography-guided or wavefront-optimized) 
are not different from the standard risks.  The excimer laser system used in the study has 
been approved for topography-guided and wavefront-optimized refractive surgery. 
The most common side effects of laser refractive surgery are glare and halos, dry eye and
residual refractive error. 
19.2. Summary of benefits
Phorcides Prospective Study Protocol Page 23 of 23
Protocol ML-2020-01 7/15/[ADDRESS_319980] results as 
good or better than can be achieved with wavefront-optimized LASIK, and Contoura 
results based on other algorithms.1,2

The above events are based on the categories provided in the ISO [ZIP_CODE] and the US FDA

Device Deficiencies  
 
A device deficiency is inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, 
durability, reliability, safety, or performance. A device deficiency may or may not be associated 
with patient harm (i .e., ADE or SADE); however, not all ADEs or SADEs are due to a de vice 
deficiency. The investigator should determine the applicable category listed in the Device

Approved Date: 06 Sep 2023  Page 58 of 81 
 
Alcon – Business Use Only  Deficiency eCRF for the identified or suspect device deficiency and report any patient harm 
separately. Examples of device deficiencies include the following:  
• Failure to meet product specifications (e .g., incorrect lens power/diameter/base 
curve/color)  
• Lens/solution cloudy  
• Lens surface/edge defect  
• Torn lens during handling/in pack  
• Packaging deficit (e .g., mislabeled product, tampered seal, leaking bottle/conta iner)  
• Suspect product contamination  
11.[ADDRESS_960193] questions shown 
below and rep ort as applicable:  
• “Have you had any health problems since your last study visit? ” 
• “Have there been any changes in the medicines you take since your last study visit? ” 
In addition, changes in any protocol -specific parameters and/or questionnaires evaluated  
during the study are to be reviewed by [CONTACT_093]. Any untoward (unfavorable and 
unintended) change in a protocol -specific parameter or questionnaire response  that is 
clinically relevant, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], is to be reported as an A E. These 
clinically relevant changes will be reported regardless of causality.  
11.3 Procedures for Recording and Reporting  
AEs are collected from the time of informed consent . Any preexisting medical conditions or 
signs/symptoms present in a subject prior to t he start of the study (i.e., before informed 
consent is signed) are not considered AEs in the study and should be recorded in the Medical 
History section of the eCRF.  
In addition, temporary lens awareness or visual changes during the fitting process are no t 
considered AEs if the investigator assesses that the symptom(s) can reasonably resolve within 
the anticipated adaptation period.  
For each recorded event, the ADEs and SAEs documentation must include date of 
occurrence, severity, treatment (if applicable ), outcome, and assessments of the seriousness

V-CLN -0040694  Status: Approved , Version: 3.0

Alcon – Business Use Only  and causality. In addition, the investigator must document all device deficiencies reported or 
observed with test and comparator products on the Device Deficiency eCRF. The site must 
submit all available infor mation on ADEs, SAEs, and device deficiencies to the study sponsor 
immediately as follows:  
• ADEs or SAEs  are documented on the Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Device 
Effect eCRF within 24 hours of the investigator ’s or site ’s awareness . 
• Device deficiencies are documented on the Device Deficiency eCRF within 24 hours 
of the investigator ’s or site ’s awareness . Additional relevant information after initial 
reporting must be entered into the eCRF as soon as the data become available.  
• Document  any changes to concomitant medications on the appropriate eCRFs.  
• Document all relevant information from Discharge Summary, Autopsy Report, 
Certificate of Death, etc., if applicable, in narrative section of the Adverse Device 
Effect (for related AEs) and Serious Adverse Event  eCRF.  
Note:  Should the EDC system become nonoperational, the site must complete the appropriate 
paper Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Device Effect and/or Device Deficiency Form. The 
completed form is emailed to the study sponsor at [EMAIL_225] , for US , according 
to the timelines outlined above; however, the reported information must be entered into the 
EDC system once it becomes operational.  
Study sponsor representatives may be contact[CONTACT_529113] -related question and their 
contact [CONTACT_706785].  
Further, depending upon the nature of the AE or device deficiency being reported, the study 
sponsor may request copi[INVESTIGATOR_706753]’s medical records. The 
investigator must also report all AEs and device deficiencies that could have led to a SADE 
according to the requirements of regulatory authorities or IRB/IEC.  
Intensity and Causality Assessments  
Where appropriate, the investigato r must assess the intensity (severity) of the AE based on 
medical judgment with consideration of any subjective symptom(s), as defined below:  
Intensity (Severity)  
Mild  An AE is mild if the subject is aware of but can easily tolerate the sign or 
symptom.  
Document ID:  
V-CLN -0040694  Status: Approved , Version: 3.0 
Approved Date: 06 Sep 2023  Page 60 of 81 
 
Alcon – Business Use Only  Moderate  An AE is moderate if the sign or symptom results in discomfort significant 
enough to cause interference with the subject ’s usual activities.  
Severe  An AE is severe if the sign or symptom is incapacitating and results in the 
subject ’s inability to  work or engage in their usual activities.  
For every AE in the study, the investigator must assess the causality ( related or not related to 
the medical device or study procedure). An assessment of causality will also be performed by 
[CONTACT_706786], as shown below:  
Causality  
Related  An AE classified as related may be either definitely related or possibly related 
where a direct cause and effect relationship with the medical device or study 
procedure has not been demonstrated, but  there is a reasonable possibility that 
the AE was caused by [CONTACT_443411].  
Not Related  An AE classified as not related may either be definitely unrelated or simply 
unlikely to be related (i.e., there are other more likely causes f or the AE).  
The study sponsor will assess the AEs and may upgrade the investigator ’s assessment of 
seriousness and/or causality. The study sponsor will notify the investigator of any AE that is 
upgraded from nonserious to serious or from unrelated to relat ed. 
11.[ADDRESS_960194] information are provided in the MOP that 
accompanies this protocol.  
Alcon products associated with device deficiencies and/or product related AEs should be

and of the c ircumstances involved. Additionally, the study sponsor may be required to 
unmask the information in order to fulfill expedited regulatory reporting requirements.  
11.6 Follow -Up of Subjects with Adverse Events  
The investigator is responsible for adequate and saf e medical care of subjects during the 
study and for ensuring that appropriate medical care and relevant follow -up procedures are 
maintained after the study.  
The investigator should provide the study sponsor with any new safety information (which 
includes new AEs and changes to previously reported AEs) that may affect the safety 
evaluation of the device. For AEs that are unresolved /ongoing at time of subject exit from 
study, any additional information received at follow -up should be documented in the eCRFs 
up to study completion (i.e., database lock).  
All complaints received after this time period will be considered and processed as 
spontaneous (following the post market vigilance procedures) and should be communicated 
to the medical device ’s manufacturer a s per local requirements.  
The investigator should also report complaints on non -Alcon products (i.e., ACUVUE 
OASYS for ASTIGMATISM with HYDRACLEAR PLUS ) directly to the manufacturer as 
per the manufacturer ’s instructions or local regulatory requirements.  
11.7 Pregnancy in the Clinical Study  
Women of childbearing potential or women who are pregnant at the time of study entry are 
not excluded from participation. Pregnancy should be included in the Pregnancy eCRF when 
a pregnant woman enters the study or if a woman  becomes pregnant during the study. 
Pregnancy is not reportable as an AE; however, complications may be reportable and will be

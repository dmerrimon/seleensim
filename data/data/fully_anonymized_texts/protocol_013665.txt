Methodology:  
This is a multi-center, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study to evaluate 
the safety and efficacy of TVB-2640 in subjects with NASH. Male and female subjects aged 
≥18 years with either biopsy-proven NASH within 2 years before randomization and MRI-PDFF ≥8% 
or, if prior liver biopsy was not performed or results are not available, magnetic resonance 
elastography (MRE) ≥2.5 kpa and MRI-PDFF ≥8% during screening are planned to be enrolled. 
Approximately [ADDRESS_339957] 90 subjects 
enrolled in the US and approximately 27 evaluable subjects (18 active, 9 placebo) enrolled in China. 
In the US, subjects will be enrolled and randomized to achieve 90 evaluable subjects (30 active and 
15 placebo in each of 2 dose cohorts). The 50 mg cohort will enroll and randomize approximately 
27 additional subjects from China. The US-only 75 mg cohort will enroll approximately 12 subjects 
(in order to ensure 10 active, evaluable subjects) who may have previously received placebo in the [ADDRESS_339958] 
meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria to participate in the study. Subjects 
who are determined to be eligible for the study, based on screening assessments, are to be randomized 
into the study within 24 hours before baseline (Day 1, the first day of study drug administration). 
Subjects who are randomized are considered to be enrolled in the study. Initially, 2 TVB-2640 dose 
levels are planned to be evaluated in a sequential fashion:  25 mg and, if study suspension criteria are 
not met at the 25 mg dose level (see Section 7.2 ), 50 mg. At each of the 2 initial dose levels, subjects 
will be randomly assigned to TVB-2640 or placebo at a 2:1 ratio, with randomization stratified by 
[CONTACT_24975] 2 diabetes mellitus status. The 50 mg dose level will also be stratified by [CONTACT_1606]:  
 Cohort 1, 25 mg dose level:  TVB-2640 (Planned N=30) and Placebo (Planned N=15) 
 Cohort 2, 50 mg dose level:  US: TVB-2640 (Planned N=30) and Placebo (Planned N=15); 
China: TVB-2640 (Planned N=18) and Placebo (Planned N=9); Total: TVB-2640 (Planned 
N=48) and Placebo (Planned N=24) 
Subjects will receive TVB-[ADDRESS_339959] complete the 12-week treatment period at the 25 mg dose level, with review of all 
safety data and written approval by [CONTACT_278315] 50 mg dose level may 
commence.

Version 7.0 (Amendment 6; US Only), 17 March 2021 After completion of Cohorts 1 and 2, and again if no stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_278295] (SRC), subjects assigned to placebo in either cohort are 
eligible to crossover to receive TVB-2640 75 mg in Open-label Cohort 3 (planned N=12 in order to 
obtain 10 evaluable subjects). Cohort [ADDRESS_339960] sites in the US only. 
The Sponsor notes that the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may impact the conduct 
of the 50 mg and 75 mg cohorts, with challenges potentially arising from quarantines and travel 
limitations affecting study subjects as well as clinic and imaging facility closures. Accordingly, safety 
assessments scheduled for the Week 12 and 16 visits, as identified in Table 2, including sample 
collection for clinical laboratory tests, physical examinations, and documentation of adverse events 
(AEs), may be performed at an alternate study center or by [CONTACT_278316]. Furthermore, if the 
subject is unable to attend the Week [ADDRESS_339961] continue 
to receive study drug until the final scan is performed; however, study drug is not to be continued for

treatment for 12 or 16 weeks. 
In Cohorts 1 and 2 study drug will be dispensed to subjects in a single-blinded fashion. All other 
study personnel, with the exception of personnel conducting/interpreting imaging studies (see 
Section 11.1 ) at each study center, will be unblinded to the subject’s treatment assignment. In 
Cohort 3, study drug will be dispensed in an open-label fashion. 
In Cohorts 1 and 2, subjects will undergo MRI-PDFF prior to the start of treatment (pre-dose), at the 
end of the initial 12 week Treatment Period (between 11 and 12 weeks after the start of treatment), 
and at Week 16. In accordance with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance for the 
conduct of clinical trials of medicinal products during the COVID-[ADDRESS_339963] continue to 
receive study drug until the final scan is performed. However, study drug is not to be continued for 
>16 weeks. In Cohort 3, subjects will undergo MRI-PDFF prior to the start of treatment (pre-dose) 
and at the end of the initial 12 week Treatment Period (between 11 and 12 weeks after the start of 
treatment). 
During the study, safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_18651] (oral temperature, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and 
blood pressure), 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), physical examination, including ophthalmologic 
examination, and clinical laboratory testing (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis). Subjects will be 
evaluated for AEs and concomitant medication use throughout the study.  
Efficacy variables include MRI-PDFF as well as measurement of liver aminotransferases, lipid 
parameters, and markers of NASH and liver fibrosis. The primary efficacy endpoint is percent change 
from baseline in liver fat at Week 12, as determined by [CONTACT_9268]-PDFF. The percentage of subjects with 
at least a 30% reduction in the primary efficacy endpoint is a key secondary efficacy endpoint.

Protocol No. 3V2640-CLIN-005 
 
Version 7.0 (Amendment 6; US Only), 17 March 2021 Sample size: 
The sample size is based on a fixed-sequence strategy which tests for a treatment difference in the 
primary endpoint (percent change from baseline in liver fat at Week 12, as determined by [CONTACT_9268]-
PDFF) between each randomized TVB-2640 dose group (25 mg and 50 mg) versus placebo. The 
fixed-sequence strategy will start with the highest dose group comparison. If the high dose 
comparison is statistically significant, then testing will proceed to the low dose group comparison. 
Each randomized TVB-[ADDRESS_339969] from an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with fixed effects for diabetes status, 
treatment group, and baseline MRI-PDFF value as a covariate. The non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-
sum test is conservatively used, instead of the F-test, for power calculations. 
The sample size is based on a conservative assumption that the primary analysis is going to be 
performed in the US population only, resulting in 30 evaluable subjects in the placebo group, and 
30 evaluable subjects in each of the randomized TVB-2640 dose levels. Based on Patel ( 2016), it is 
conservatively assumed that the primary endpoint has a standard deviation of 30. Power calculations 
assume the primary endpoint is lognormally distributed with a standard deviation of 30, there are at 
least [ADDRESS_339970] 80% overall 
power to detect both treatment differences (i.e., both high dose [50 mg] versus placebo and low dose 
[25 mg] versus placebo), if each mean treatment difference is at least 24. If the study does not proceed 
to the high-dose level, (i.e., there are 30 evaluable subjects treated with 25 mg TVB-2640 and only 
15 with placebo), then the study has at least 77% power to detect a mean treatment difference of at 
least 24. The study will have more power if the subjects from China are included in the primary 
analysis and the same assumptions of treatment difference and variability hold. 
Statistical methods: 
The modified intent-to-treat population (mITT) is defined as all subjects who are randomized, receive 
study drug for at least [ADDRESS_339971]-baseline MRI-PDFF 
assessment on or after Week 8. The mITT is the primary population for analysis of MRI-PDFF 
assessments. The intent-to-treat population (ITT) is defined as all subjects who are randomized and 
received at least [ADDRESS_339972] to the primary efficacy endpoint, percent 
change from baseline in hepatic fat fraction at Week 12, as determined by [CONTACT_9268]-PDFF, will be 
performed in the 50 mg cohort. An ANCOVA model with fixed effects for the stratification factor 
(diabetes presence/absence), country (US/China), treatment group (TVB-2640 50 mg and pooled 
placebo), and country-by-treatment interaction and with the baseline MRI-PDFF value as a covariate 
including all subjects from US and China will be performed. If there is no interaction detected 
(p≥0.05), the primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed using an ANCOVA model with fixed effects 
for the stratification factor (diabetes presence/absence) and treatment group (i.e., randomized 
TVB-2640 dose groups and pooled placebo) and with the baseline MRI-PDFF value as a covariate 
including all subjects from US and China. If the country-by-treatment interaction is significant 
(p<0.05) then the primary analysis will be conducted on US subjects and will maintain sufficient 
power with the 90 evaluable subjects in the US (30 active in each cohort and 30 combined placebo). 
A separate analysis would be performed on subjects from China in the [ADDRESS_339973] a significant difference but would be supportive/descriptive in nature to 
evaluate trends. 
The primary efficacy analyses will be based on an F-test from the ANCOVA model in the mITT to 
compare ea ch randomized TVB -2640 dose group individually with the placebo group. The fixed -

Protocol No. 3V2640-CLIN-005 
 
Version 7.0 (Amendment 6; US Only), [ADDRESS_339974] squares means (and the associated 95% confidence interval and p-value) for each randomized 
TVB-2640 dose group to pooled placebo comparison. 
Differences between each randomized TVB-2640 dose group (25 mg, 50 mg) and pooled placebo for 
the key secondary efficacy endpoint, the percentage of subjects achieving a 30% or greater reduction 
of liver fat as determined by [CONTACT_66268] (i.e., a response), will be analyzed using Cochran-Mantel-
Haenszel (CMH) methods. The key secondary efficacy analyses will be based on a CMH test in the 
mITT to compare each randomized TVB-2640 dose group with placebo, adjusting for the 
stratification factor (diabetes presence/absence). If a country-by-treatment interaction is found in the 
primary efficacy endpoint, the subjects enrolled in the US and in China in the 50 mg cohort may be 
analyzed separately for the key secondary efficacy endpoint and analysis of the subjects from China 
will be viewed as supportive/descriptive. The estimated response rates and the corresponding exact 
95% confidence interval based on a binomial distribution will be calculated for each treatment group. 
The exact 95% confidence limit for the CMH estimate of the common risk difference will also be 
obtained. 
The primary and key secondary efficacy analyses will be tested using a fixed-sequence strategy to 
maintain the overall Type I error rate at 0.05. Each test in the fixed-sequence, uses a 2-sided test at the 
0.[ADDRESS_339975] randomized dose-group (50 mg) to placebo and if statistically 
significant, testing will proceed to the low dose group comparison. If both comparisons of the primary 
efficacy endpoint are significant, then testing will proceed to the key secondary efficacy endpoint. 
The key secondary efficacy analyses similarly start with a comparison of the highest dose-group with 
placebo and if statistically significant, testing will proceed to the low dose group comparison. 
Missing Week [ADDRESS_339976]-baseline observation on or after Week 8 in the mITT. Secondary and sensitivity 
analyses using other methods for missing data and in different analysis populations will be described 
in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). For other continuous secondary efficacy endpoints measured at 
multiple post-baseline visits, the changes at 12 weeks will be summarized for each treatment group 
and compared between each randomized TVB-2640 dose group and pooled placebo using a linear 
mixed-effects model for repeated measures in the ITT. The model will include the stratification factor 
(diabetes presence/absence), treatment group, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as the fixed 
effects, and baseline value as a covariate. The point estimates for the least-squares mean of the 
pairwise difference for each randomized TVB-2640 dose group and pooled placebo comparison at 
each visit and the corresponding 95% confidence interval and 2-sided p-value will be summarized. 
Additional details for handling of data from subjects enrolled in the US and in China will be 
described in the SAP. 
Similarly, a generalized linear mixed-effects model for repeated measures based on a logit link 
function will be used for comparing other categorical efficacy endpoints or derived categorical 
response rates for continuous endpoints at 12 weeks between each randomized TVB-2640 dose group 
and pooled placebo group in the ITT. 
No formal statistical testing will be conducted for the safety analyses. 
Data from Cohort 3 will be summarized descriptively. Further details will be provided in the SAP.

 Version 7.0 (Amendment 6; US Only), 17 March 2021 5. INTRODUCTION 
Fatty acid synthase (FASN) is a key enzyme in the de novo lipogenesis (DNL) pathway and 
catalyzes the biosynthesis of palmitate from acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) and malonyl-CoA 
substrates, which can then undergo further modifications into other fatty acids and complex lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]. 
Because FASN catalyzes the last step in the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway, it is believed to be a 
determinant of the maximal liver capacity to synthesize fatty acids by [CONTACT_278323] ( Postic, 2008 ). 
Dysregulation of FASN activity is found in a number of different disease states including cancer 
(Buckley, 2017 ) and metabolic diseases. 
Metabolic diseases spanning the continuum of metabolic syndrome, non-alcoholic fatty liver 
disease (NAFLD) and the more advanced disease of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) can 
progress to significant liver diseases, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In 
addition, NAFLD is associated with increased comorbidities, including cardiovascular diseases 
(Widya et al. 2016 ; Targher, Day, and Bonora 2010 ) and type 2 diabetes ( Cusi 2016 ). Obesity 
and the metabolic syndrome are two key risk factors for NAFLD, which are characterized as an 
imbalance in energy utilization and storage ( Grundy, 2005 ). This imbalance may lead to 
dysregulated metabolic pathways and inflammatory responses that drive further changes leading 
to liver damage and comorbid conditions. Over the next [ADDRESS_339997] prevalent liver disease in the [LOCATION_002] (US). 
Normal responses to feeding carbohydrate in meals include a transient increase in hepatic DNL, 
a FASN-dependent pathway, followed by a return to baseline levels upon fasting. In subjects 
with NAFLD, however, hepatic DNL is increased ( Donnelly et al. 2005 ; Lambert et al. 2014 ), 
and FASN gene expression has been shown to be elevated in liver biopsies from NAFLD 
patients (Kohijimi, 2007 ; Mitsuyoshi, 2009 ), contributing to elevated liver stores of triglycerides 
(TG) and saturated fatty acid species, which in turn may contribute to liver inflammation ( Wei 
2006), tissue damage, and fibrosis. 
There are currently no drugs licensed for the treatment of NASH. Inhibiting lipogenesis, with an 
FASN inhibitor for example, may be a viable clinical strategy to address NASH. 
Pharmacological inhibition of FASN with TVB-3664, a chemical surrogate of TVB-2640, 
improved hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis in a diet-induced mouse model of NASH 
(Duke 2017 ). Moreover, studies in NASH subjects have shown that inhibition of DNL with 
acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) inhibitor GS-0976 ( Stiede, 2017 ) results in a significant 
reduction of intrahepatic fat and surrogate markers of fibrosis and cell death ( Loomba, 2017 ). 
Also, pi[INVESTIGATOR_278302] ( Musso, 2017 ), 
which may be associated with a reduction in DNL ( Beysen, 2008 ). Further studies are needed, 
however, to evaluate the full spectrum of treatment effects elicited by [CONTACT_278324]-effects. 
Sagimet Biosciences (formerly 3-V Biosciences) has developed an oral, once-daily (QD) FASN 
inhibitor, TVB-2640. This drug has been evaluated in approximately160 humans to date 
including patients with solid tumors and healthy adults, some of whom had characteristics of 
metabolic syndrome. The safety, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters 
of TVB-[ADDRESS_339998] been measured. Preliminary results demonstrated that once-daily, oral 
administration of TVB-2640 for 10 days decreased hepatic DNL in a dose-dependent manner 
and improved other markers of metabolic dysfunction in otherwise healthy subjects with

 Version 7.0 (Amendment 6; US Only), 17 March 2021 characteristics of the metabolic syndrome ( Study 2006432, Syed-Abdul, 2019 ). These 
observations form the basis for evaluating the TVB-2640 as a novel therapy for subjects with 
NASH. 
5.1. TVB-2640 
The clinical safety profile to date for TVB-2640 is based primarily on one completed 
uncontrolled open-label Phase 1 study in humans (Study 3V2640-CLIN-002) in 136 patients 
with solid tumors, 76 treated with monotherapy (at doses ranging from 60 mg/m2 to a dose of 
240 mg/m2 (i.e., up to 600 mg) and 60 treated with TVB-2640 in combination with a taxane 
(paclitaxel or docetaxel).  
Overall, TVB-[ADDRESS_339999] treatment-emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs) were Grade [ADDRESS_340000] skin events 
were Grade 1 or 2 in intensity, and all were non-serious. 
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TVB-2640 monotherapy in patients with solid tumors 
was determined to be 100 mg/m2. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) associated with TVB-2640 
monotherapy were skin and ocular events, including corneal edema, keratitis, and palmar-plantar 
erythrodysesthesia (PPE) syndrome. 
As monotherapy, the most common individual TEAEs were alopecia (61%), PPE syndrome 
(46%), fatigue (37%), decreased appetite (26%), and dry skin (22%).  
When TVB-2640 was administered in combination with a taxane (paclitaxel or docetaxel), skin 
and ocular effects also were common. Most skin events were Grade 1 or 2 in intensity, and all 
but 1 skin event were non-serious. 
As was the case with monotherapy, the MTD of TVB-2640 in combination with paclitaxel was 
determined to be 100 mg/m2. DLTs associated with TVB-[ADDRESS_340001] common TEAEs with TVB-2640 in combination with paclitaxel 
were fatigue (53%), alopecia (46%), PPE syndrome (46%), nausea (40%), and peripheral 
neuropathy (36%). Peripheral neuropathy is known to be associated with paclitaxel. 
When TVB-2640 was administered in combination with paclitaxel, 6 epi[INVESTIGATOR_278303] 5 patients, with all assessed by [CONTACT_278325]-2640 and paclitaxel. (No cases of pneumonitis were reported among monotherapy

and non-serious and none led to study drug discontinuation. The only TEAEs reported for 
>1 subjects were alopecia and PPE syndrome (each 2 subjects). In this study, QD PO 
administration of TVB-2640 for 10 days was shown to decrease hepatic DNL in a dose-
dependent manner and improved other markers of metabolic dysfunction in this population of 
otherwise healthy subjects with characteristics of the metabolic syndrome. These observations 
form the basis for evaluating the TVB-2640 as a novel therapy for subjects with NASH.

7.1. Overall Study Design 
This is a multi-center, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of TVB-2640 in subjects with NASH. Male and female subjects 
aged ≥18 years with either biopsy-proven NASH within 2 years before randomization and MRI-
PDFF ≥8% or, if prior liver biopsy was not performed or results are not available, magnetic 
resonance elastography (MRE) ≥2.5 kpa (Cohorts 1 and 2 only) and MRI-PDFF ≥8% during 
screening are planned to be enrolled. Approximately [ADDRESS_340006] 90 subjects enrolled in the US and approximately 27 evaluable subjects 
enrolled in China (18 active and 9 placebo). In the US, subjects will be enrolled and randomized 
to achieve 90 evaluable subjects (30 active and 15 placebo in each of 2 dose cohorts). The [ADDRESS_340007] meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria to participate in the 
study. Note that subjects who initially fail to meet all entrance criteria based on screening 
assessments (i.e., screen failures) may be submitted for re-screening once (see Section 8.5  for 
details).  
Subjects who are determined to be eligible for the study, based on screening assessments, are to 
be randomized into the study within 24 hours before baseline (Day 1, the first day of study drug 
administration). Subjects who are randomized are considered to be enrolled in the study. 
Initially, 2 TVB-2640 dose levels are planned to be evaluated in a sequential fashion:  25 mg 
and, if study suspension criteria are not met at the 25 mg dose level (see Section 7.2 ), 50 mg. At 
each of the 2 initial dose levels, subjects will be randomly assigned to TVB-2640 or placebo at a 
2:1 ratio, with randomization stratified by [CONTACT_24975] 2 diabetes mellitus status. The 50 mg dose level 
will also be stratified by [CONTACT_1606]:  
 25 mg dose level:  TVB-2640 (Planned N=30) and Placebo (Planned N=15) 
 50 mg dose level:  US: TVB-2640 (Planned N=30) and Placebo (Planned N=15); 
China: TVB-2640 (Planned N=18) and Placebo (Planned N=9); Total: TVB-2640

 Version 7.0 (Amendment 6; US Only), 17 March 2021 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before enrollment and treatment of subjects at the 50 mg 
dose level may commence.  
After completion of Cohorts 1 and 2, and again if no stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_278305], subjects assigned to placebo in either cohort are eligible to crossover to 
receive TVB-2640 75 mg in Open-label Cohort 3 (planned N=12 in order to obtain 10 evaluable 
subjects). Cohort [ADDRESS_340009] sites only. 
The Sponsor notes that the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may impact the 
conduct of the 50 mg and 75 mg cohorts, with challenges potentially arising from quarantines 
and travel limitations affecting study subjects as well as clinic and imaging facility closures. 
Accordingly, safety assessments scheduled for the Week 12 and 16 visits, as identified in 
Table 2, including sample collection for clinical laboratory tests, physical examinations, and 
documentation of adverse events (AEs), may be performed at an alternate study center or by 
[CONTACT_278316]. Furthermore, if the subject is unable to attend the Week [ADDRESS_340010] continue to receive study drug until the final 
scan is performed; however, study drug is not to be continued for >[ADDRESS_340011]

In Cohorts 1 and 2, study drug will be dispensed to subjects in a single-blinded fashion. All other 
study personnel, with the exception of personnel conducting/interpreting imaging studies (see 
Section 11.1 ) at each study center, will be unblinded to the subject’s treatment assignment. In 
Cohort 3, study drug will be dispensed in an open-label fashion. 
Efficacy variables include MRI-PDFF as well as measurement of liver aminotransferases, lipid 
parameters, and markers of NASH and liver fibrosis. The primary endpoint is percent change 
from baseline in liver fat from baseline at Week 12, as determined by [CONTACT_9268]-PDFF. The 
percentage of subjects with at least a 30% reduction in the primary endpoint is a key secondary 
efficacy endpoint.  
In Cohorts 1 and 2, subjects will undergo MRI-PDFF prior to the start of treatment (pre-dose), at 
the end of the initial 12-week Treatment Period (between 11 and 12 weeks after the start of 
treatment), and at Week 16. Due to the COVID-[ADDRESS_340012] continue to receive study drug until the

MRI-PDFF will undergo MRI-PDFF prior to the start of treatment (pre-dose) and at the end of 
the initial 12 week Treatment Period (between 11 and 12 weeks after the start of treatment). 
During the study, safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_18651] (oral temperature, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], 
and seated blood pressure), 12-lead ECG, physical examination, including ophthalmologic 
examination, and clinical laboratory testing (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis). Subjects 
will be evaluated for AEs and concomitant medication use throughout the study.

8.5. Subject Identification and Randomization 
Subjects who are candidates for enrollment into the study will be assigned a sequential and 
unique subject number by [CONTACT_278331]. Once a subject number has been assigned, it cannot be reused. 
Subjects who have provided written informed consent will be evaluated for eligibility by [CONTACT_278332] (see Section 8.2  and Section 8.3 ) have been satisfied 
and that the subjects is eligible for participation in this clinical study.  
Note that subjects who initially fail to meet all entrance criteria based on screening assessments 
(i.e., screen failures) may be submitted for re-screening once, with each case handled on an 
individual subject basis. The subject must be submitted for review via electronic mail and only 
entered into the electronic data capture (EDC) system as a screening candidate with written 
approval from the medical monitor. Subjects who initially fail screening because of clinical 
laboratory tests may have laboratory tests repeated during screening, at the Investigator’s 
discretion, without being re-submitted for screening.  
Three TVB-2640 dose levels are planned to be evaluated in a sequential fashion:  25 mg and, if 
study suspension criteria are not met at the 25 mg dose level (see Section 7.2 ), 50 mg, and then, 
in an open-label fashion, 75 mg.  
At the 25 and 50 mg dose levels, subjects will be randomly assigned to TVB-2640 or placebo at 
a 2:1 ratio, with randomization stratified by [CONTACT_24975] 2 diabetes mellitus status. The 50 mg dose level 
will also be stratified by [CONTACT_1606]:  
 Cohort 1:  25 mg dose level:  TVB-2640 (Planned N=30) and Placebo (Planned N=15) 
 Cohort 2:  50 mg dose level:  US: TVB-2640 (Planned N=30) and Placebo (Planned 
N=15); China: TVB-2640 (Planned N=18) and Placebo (Planned N=9); Total: TVB-2640 
(Planned N=48) and Placebo (Planned N=24) 
Subjects are to receive their first study drug dose on Day 1 within 24 hours after randomization. 
At both dose levels, subjects will receive TVB-2640 or placebo QD PO for 12 weeks, or until the 
time of the final on-treatment MRI-PDFF if after Week 12, but for no longer than 16 weeks. 
After completion of Cohorts 1 and 2, subjects assigned to placebo in either cohort are eligible to 
crossover to receive TVB-2640 75 mg in Open-label Cohort 3 (Planned N=12 in order to obtain 
10 evaluable subjects). 
8.6. Subject Withdrawal Criteria 
Subjects will be informed that they have the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any 
reason, without prejudice to their medical care. Study drug must be permanently discontinued

managed as indicated: 
 Palmar-plantar Erythrodysesthesia (PPE) :  For mild to moderate symptoms of PPE 
(e.g., redness, pain, or scaling of hands or feet), study drug should be interrupted and 
symptomatic measures, including hand cream such as “Udder Cream”, instituted 
immediately. Study drug may be resumed after resolution of symptoms. Study drug 
should be permanently discontinued at the first sign of significant/severe, redness, pain, 
or scaling of hands or feet, and symptomatic measures instituted immediately.  
 Dyspnea or suspected pneumonitis :  Study drug should be permanently discontinued 
for subjects with shortness of breath or other respi[INVESTIGATOR_278307]. The subject is to be carefully monitored for improvement. In the event that 
symptoms worsen or present as more than mild intensity, immediate referral to a 
qualified pulmonologist for definitive diagnosis and treatment should be undertaken. 
 Visual symptoms (including keratitis) :  Study drug should be permanently discontinued 
at the first sign of significant, redness, pain, or dryness of the eyes. Symptomatic 
measures, including moisturizing eye drops should be instituted. In the event that 
symptoms worsen or present as more than mild, immediate referral to a qualified 
ophthalmologist should be undertaken. 
 Evidence of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) ; Study drug should be permanently 
discontinued for subjects with evidence of DILI; see Appendix A  for details. 
Refer to the Study Manual for additional details regarding the assessment and management of 
these events. 
Furthermore, the Investigator also has the right to withdraw subjects from the study for any of 
the following reasons: 
 Progression of underlying disease that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], precludes 
further study treatment.  
 Occurrence of any other unacceptable AE. 
 Study drug interruption for any reason for >7 days. 
 Subject requires use of a prohibited concomitant medication or therapy. 
 General or specific changes in the subject’s condition unacceptable for further 
treatment within the study parameters, in the judgment of the Investigator. 
 Non-compliance. 
 Lost to follow-up. 
 Subject withdrawal of consent. 
 Sponsor request. 
At the time of withdrawal, all study procedures outlined for the Early Termination visit should be 
completed. The primary reason for a subject’s withdrawal from the study is to be recorded in the

9.4. Study Drug Accountability 
The US FDA, Chinese Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) and other applicable regulatory 
authorities require accounting of all investigational drug received by [CONTACT_180443]. Records 
of drug disposition required include the date received by [CONTACT_16018], date administered, quantity 
administered, and the subject to whom study drug was administered. The Investigator is 
responsible for the accountability of all used and unused study drug containers and unused study 
drug.  
Each study center is to use a study drug accountability log to document study drug disposition. 
All items on this form are to be completed in full. The Sponsor’s clinical research associate 
(CRA) is to approve the area where study drug is to be stored and accountability records are to 
be maintained. 
The investigator identification number and subject initials (as allowed by [CONTACT_427]) and

 Version 7.0 (Amendment 6; US Only), [ADDRESS_340028] dose 
administered on Day 1. 
Each QD dose of study drug is to be taken at the same time of day with food; the study drug dose 
is to be taken in the morning on Days 1 to 8 and then in the evening on each day thereafter, with 
each dose separated by 24 hours (±4 hours). (The Day 8 and 9 doses will be separated by 
36 hours.) Subjects will receive one of the following each day, based on their cohort and 
treatment assignment: 
 Placebo:  1 placebo tablet 
 TVB-2640 25 mg:  1 25-mg TVB-2640 tablet 
 TVB-2640 50 mg:  1 50-mg TVB-2640 tablet 
 TVB-2640 75 mg:  1 50-mg TVB-2640 tablet and 1 25-mg TVB-2640 tablet 
9.6. Dose Reductions 
Dose reductions for the management of other study drug-related toxicities are permissible for 
subjects assigned to TVB-2640 50 mg or 75 mg with the approval of the Medical Monitor.  
 Subjects assigned to [ADDRESS_340029] the dose reduced to 25 mg. In such cases, subjects 
will receive 1 25-mg tablet. 
 Subjects assigned to [ADDRESS_340030] been selected for this study:  25 mg, 50 mg, and 75 mg, 
delivered in QD PO tablet(s) of strengths 25 mg and 50 mg.  
These doses are expected to span a range of effects on the primary endpoint, percentage of 
subjects achieving a 30% or greater reduction of liver fat determined by [CONTACT_9268]-PDFF, as well as 
overall reduction of liver fat. This range also is expected to enable determination of minimal 
effective dose for future studies. In addition, the AE profile of the doses will be collected and 
used to assess dose optimization for future studies. 
In a Phase 1 study of 12 otherwise healthy men with characteristics of the metabolic syndrome 
(Study 2006432 ), [ADDRESS_340031] dose 
tested. This 50 mg dose reduced hepatic lipogenesis by [CONTACT_5554] 24% (95% confidence 
interval -4%, -39%, p=0.02) and reduction was observed in 100% of the 6 subjects. These data,

The safety of the 50 mg and 75 mg doses is supported by [CONTACT_278333] 
(GLP) toxicology studies and prior human experience.  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
Additionally, none of the 6 men with metabolic syndrome who 
received 50 mg of TVB-2640 experienced a TEAE. 
In Study 3V2640-CLIN-002, cancer patients received daily doses of 100 mg or greater of 
TVB-2640 and the blood exposure was reported to be linearly proportional to the oral dose. PK 
data from the Phase 1 study of 12 men with metabolic syndrome are consistent with this 
relationship.  
 
 
. 
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for a summary of safety data with TVB-2640. 
The existing nonclinical and clinical studies of TVB-2640 support the safety of the doses 
selected as well as the potential to differentiate the activity of the drug on the percent of subjects 
achieving a 30% or greater reduction of liver fat and an overall reduction of liver fat. These data 
will enable guidance of a minimal effective dose for future studies. 
Due to the COVID-[ADDRESS_340033] continue to receive study drug until 
the final scan is performed. However, study drug is not to be continued for >16 weeks.  
Nonclinical and clinical data obtained to date support daily dosing with TVB-2640 for 16 weeks, 
as follows:   
 Complete safety data from 30 subjects who received TVB-2640 25 mg for 12 weeks 
and available safety data from 30 subjects who received TVB-2640 50 mg for 4 to 
12 weeks (ongoing cohort) as reviewed by [CONTACT_12217], support continued dosing beyond 
Week 12 and up to and including Week 16. Safety and PK data from these 2 doses 
demonstrate a proportional and expected plasma exposure of TVB-2640 in subjects, 
further providing confidence in continued dosing.

12.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events 
12.2.1. Definition of Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events (AE) 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product, and which does not necessarily have to have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including abnormal laboratory findings), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of an investigational product, whether or not related to the investigational product. 
An unexpected AE is any event for which the nature or severity is not consistent with the 
information in the current Investigator’s Brochure. 
All AEs that occur from screening (i.e., after the ICF is signed) through [ADDRESS_340050] 
dose of study drug, whether or not they are related to the study drug, are to be reported in the 
eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it: 
 Results in death. 
 Is life-threatening. Life-threatening means that the subject was at immediate risk of 
death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction which 
hypothetically might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form. 
 Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6930]/or surgical operations scheduled to occur during the 
study period, but planned prior to study entry are not considered AEs if the illness or 
disease existed before the subject was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not 
deteriorate in an unexpected manner during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier 
than planned). Additional exclusions to SAE reporting include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315]: 
 Elective procedures. 
 Social/administrative reasons in the absence of an AE. 
 Expected deterioration caused by [CONTACT_278339]. 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Disability is defined as a 
substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
Sagimet Biosciences Confidential 57 of 74 
Protocol No. 3V2640-CLIN-005 
 
 Version 7.0 (Amendment 6; US Only), 17 March 2021  Is an important medical event. An important medical event is an event that may not 
result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_244088], based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the 
subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in the definitions for SAEs. Examples of such medical events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
All SAEs that occur after any subject has been enrolled, before treatment, during treatment, or 
within [ADDRESS_340051] be recorded on forms provided by [CONTACT_278340], or designee.  
12.2.2. Adverse Event Assessment 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Intensity 
The intensity of each AE is to be assessed by [CONTACT_278341] (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 5.0 (see 
https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocoldevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/CTCAE_v5_Quick_R
eference_5x7.pdf). If the AE is not included in the NCI CTCAE, then the Investigator is to 
determine the intensity of the AE according to the following criteria: 
Mild (Grade 1):  AE that disappears or is easily tolerated on continuation of study 
drug. 
Moderate (Grade 2):  AE sufficiently discomforting to cause interference with usual 
work activities. 
Severe (Grade 3):  AE that is incapacitating, with inability to work or perform daily 
activities. 
Life-Threatening (Grade 4):  AE that is potentially  life-threatening.1 
Death (Grade 5):  Death related to AE. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Relationship to Study Drug 
The causal relationship of each AE to study drug will be determined by [CONTACT_278342], as follows: 
Definitely related : This category applies when, after careful medical consideration, 
there is almost no consideration of other causation. 
Probably related : There is a clinically plausible time sequence between onset of the 
AE and study drug administration. The AE is unlikely to be 
caused by a concurrent and/or underlying illness, other drugs, or 
 
1. If a life-threatening (Grade 4) adverse event is immediately  life-threatening, the event is, by 
[CONTACT_108], serious and is to be reported as described in Section 12.2.4 . 
Sagimet Biosciences Confidential 58 of 74 
Protocol No. 3V2640-CLIN-005 
 
 Version 7.0 (Amendment 6; US Only), 17 March 2021 procedures. If applicable, the AE follows a clinically consistent 
resolution pattern upon withdrawal of study drug. 
Possibly related : There is a clinically plausible time sequence between onset of the 
AE and study drug administration, but the AE could also have 
been caused by [CONTACT_95330]/underlying illness, other drugs, or 
procedures. Information regarding study drug withdrawal may be 
lacking or unclear. “Possible” should be used when study drug 
administration is one of several biologically plausible causes of 
the AE. 
Unlikely related : The AE is most likely due to a non-study drug-related cause. 
However, association with the study drug cannot be completely 
ruled out. 
Unrelated : Another cause of the AE is most plausible and a clinically 
plausible temporal sequence is inconsistent with the onset of the 
AE and study drug administration and/or a causal relationship is 
considered biologically implausible. 
If the relationship between the AE/SAE and study drug is determined to be “possible”, 
“probable”, or “definite”, the event will be considered to be treatment-related for the purposes of 
expedited regulatory reporting and safety analyses. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Seriousness 
AEs that meet the criteria specified in Section [IP_ADDRESS]  are to be considered serious. 
12.2.3. Recording Adverse Events 
Each subject must be carefully monitored for the development of any AEs. This information 
should be obtained in the form of non-leading questions (e.g., “How are you feeling?”) and from 
signs and symptoms detected during each examination, observations of study personnel, and 
spontaneous reports from subjects.  
All AEs (serious and non-serious) spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_3184]/or in response to an 
open question from study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination, or other 
diagnostic procedures will be documented in the subject’s source documents and recorded in the 
eCRF. Any clinically relevant (as determined by [CONTACT_737]) deterioration in laboratory 
assessments or other clinical findings is considered an AE and must be recorded in the subject’s 
source documents and in the eCRF.  
Information about AEs will be collected from screening (i.e., after the ICF is signed) through 
[ADDRESS_340052] medical 
terminology when possible. Also when possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common 
underlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event. For each AE, the investigator 
will evaluate and report the onset date, resolution date, intensity, causality, action taken, serious

Protocol No. 3V2640-CLIN-005 
 
 Version 7.0 (Amendment 6; US Only), 17 March 2021 12.2.4. Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
All SAEs (related and unrelated) occurring from screening through [ADDRESS_340053] report all SAEs within 24 hours of discovery via the EDC system, which 
will trigger email notifications to the ProSciento, Inc., Medical Monitor/Safety team. (In the 
event the EDC system is not available, then SAE reports must be emailed to 
[EMAIL_5418] .) 
The Investigator must complete and electronically sign and date the SAE pages of the eCRF and 
verify the accuracy of the information recorded on the SAE pages with the corresponding source 
documents.  
Additional follow-up information, if required or available, should be submitted within the EDC 
system within one business day of receipt and this should be completed on a follow-up SAE 
form and placed with the original SAE information and kept with the appropriate section of the 
eCRF and/or study file. 
Sagimet Biosciences is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of certain 
events. It is the Investigator’s responsibility to notify the IRB of all SAEs that occur at his or her 
study center. Investigators will also be notified of all unexpected, serious, drug-related events 
(7/15 Day Safety Reports) that occur during the clinical study. Each study center is responsible 
for notifying its IRB of these additional SAEs.  
12.2.5. Follow-Up of Adverse Events 
The Investigator must continue to follow all treatment-emergent SAEs and non-serious AEs 
considered to be at least possibly related to study drug either until resolution or the event is 
clearly determined to be stable or due to a subject’s stable or chronic condition or inter-current 
illness(es). This follow-up may extend after the end of the study. 
12.2.6. Pregnancy 
Pregnancies occurring in the subject or subject’s partner while the subject is receiving study drug 
or within [ADDRESS_340054]’s last dose of study drug will not be considered serious, but 
are to be reported using the same procedures as for SAEs described in Section 12.2.[ADDRESS_340055] should be referred to an obstetrician/gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity 
for further evaluation and counseling. 
The Investigator will follow the subject / subject’s partner until completion of the pregnancy, and 
must notify the Medical Monitor of the outcome within 5 days. The Investigator will provide this 
information as a follow-up to the initial report. 
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (i.e., 
spontaneous abortion [any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be documented], 
stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), then the Investigator should report it as such.

suspects is related to the in utero exposure to the study drug should also be reported. 
12.2.7. Overdose 
Signs and symptoms of an overdose should be reported as AEs. Overdoses will not be considered 
SAEs unless the outcome of the overdose meets seriousness criteria (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
12.2.8. Protocol Deviations Due to an Emergency or Adverse Event 
Departures from the protocol will be determined as allowable on a case-by-case basis and only in 
the event of an emergency. The Investigator or other physician in attendance in such an 
emergency must contact [CONTACT_278343]. 
The Medical Monitor, in conjunction with the Investigator, will decide whether the subject 
should continue to participate in the study. All protocol deviations and reasons for such 
deviations must be documented in the subject’s source records.

Protocol No. 3V2640-CLIN-005 
 
 Version 7.0 (Amendment 6; US Only), 17 March 2021 13. STATISTICS 
13.1. Determination of Sample Size 
The sample size is based on a fixed-sequence strategy which tests for a treatment difference in 
the primary endpoint (percent change at Week 12 in liver fat from baseline as determined by 
[CONTACT_9268]-PDFF) between each randomized TVB-2640 dose group (25 and 50 mg) versus placebo. 
The fixed-sequence strategy will start with the highest dose group comparison. If statistically 
significant, then testing will proceed to the low dose group comparison. Each TVB-[ADDRESS_340057] from an analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) model with fixed effects for the stratification factor (diabetes 
presence/absence) and treatment group (i.e., TVB-2640 dose groups and pooled placebo) and 
with the baseline MRI-PDFF value as a covariate. Since the primary efficacy endpoint may not 
be normally distributed, the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test is conservatively used, 
instead of the F-test, for power calculations. 
The sample size is based on a conservative assumption that the primary analysis is going to be 
performed in the US population only, resulting in 30 evaluable subjects in the placebo group, and 
30 evaluable subjects in each of the randomized TVB-2640 dose levels. Based on Patel ( 2016), it 
is conservatively assumed that the primary endpoint has a standard deviation of 30. Power 
calculations assume the primary endpoint is lognormally distributed with a standard deviation of 
30, there are at least [ADDRESS_340058] 80% overall power to detect both treatment differences (i.e., both high dose 
[50 mg] versus placebo and low dose [25 mg] versus placebo), if each mean treatment difference 
is at least 24. If the study does not proceed to the high-dose level, (i.e., there are 30 evaluable 
subjects treated with 25 mg TVB-2640 and only 15 with placebo), then the study has at least 
77% power to detect a mean treatment difference of at least 24. The study will have more power 
if the subjects from China are included in the primary analysis and the same assumptions of 
treatment difference and variability hold. 
Power calculations for the key secondary endpoint (percentage of subjects with at least a 30% 
reduction in the primary endpoint) are based on pairwise comparisons with the placebo group 
using Fisher’s two-sided exact test [equivalent to Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) without 
stratification] at the 0.05 significance level. Based on Loomba ( 2018), it is expected there will be 
less than 5 responses out of 30 evaluable subjects in the placebo group (i.e., less than 16.7%). 
With [ADDRESS_340059] 80% power to detect at least 
a 36.7% increase in the response rate (TVB-2640 treatment group minus placebo) when the 
placebo response rate is at most 16.7%. If the study does not proceed to the high-dose level, (i.e., 
30 evaluable subjects treated with 25 mg TVB-2640 and only 15 with placebo), then the study 
has at least 63% power to detect at least a 36.7% increase in the response rate (25 mg TVB-2640 
treatment group minus placebo) when the placebo response rate is at most 2 out of 15 evaluable 
subjects (i.e., 13.34%).With [ADDRESS_340060] a 95% 
probability of detecting at least 1 AE when the AE rate is 10% or more in the underlying 
population. The open label 75mg cohort is being assessed for safety only.

 Version 7.0 (Amendment 6; US Only), 17 March 2021 13.2. Statistical Analyses 
13.2.1. Analysis Populations 
The modified intent-to-treat population (mITT) is defined as all subjects who are randomized, 
receive study drug for at least [ADDRESS_340061]-baseline MRI-
PDFF assessment on or after Week 8. The mITT is the primary population for analysis of MRI-
PDFF assessments and subjects will be analyzed according to the randomized treatment 
assignment. 
The intent-to-treat population (ITT) is defined as all subjects who are randomized and received at 
least 1 dose of study drug. The ITT will be used for analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints and 
supportive and sensitivity analyses of MRI-PDFF assessments. Subjects will be analyzed 
according to the randomized treatment assignment. Details will be provided in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP). 
The safety population is defined as all subjects who are randomized and received at least [ADDRESS_340062] to the primary efficacy endpoint, percent 
change from baseline in hepatic fat fraction at Week 12, as determined by [CONTACT_9268]-PDFF, will be 
performed in the 50 mg cohort. An ANCOVA model with fixed effects for the stratification 
factor (diabetes presence/absence), country (US/China), treatment group (TVB-2640 50 mg and 
pooled placebo), and country-by-treatment interaction and with the baseline MRI-PDFF value as 
a covariate including all subjects from US and China will be performed. If there is no interaction 
detected (p≥0.05), the primary efficacy endpoint, percent change from baseline in hepatic fat 
fraction at Week 12, as determined by [CONTACT_66268], will be analyzed using an analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) model with fixed effects for the stratification factor (diabetes 
presence/absence) and treatment group (i.e., randomized TVB-2640 dose groups and pooled 
placebo) and with the baseline MRI-PDFF value as a covariate including all subjects from US 
and China. If the country-by-treatment interaction is significant (p<0.05) then the primary 
analysis will be conducted on subjects enrolled in the US and will maintain sufficient power with 
the 90 evaluable subjects in the US (30 active in each cohort and 30 combined placebo). A 
separate analysis would be performed on subjects enrolled in China in the [ADDRESS_340063] a significant difference but would be supportive/descriptive in 
nature to evaluate trends. 
The primary efficacy analyses will be based on a F-test from the ANCOVA model in the mITT 
to compare each randomized TVB-2640 dose group individually with the placebo group. The 
fixed-sequence method, as described below, will be used to maintain an overall 0.05 Type I error 
rate. Data normality will be assessed and the appropriate data transformation will be applied to 
fulfill the underlying assumption of the ANCOVA model; if a suitable transformation cannot be 
determined the corresponding rank ANCOVA will become the primary analysis for this 
endpoint. Treatment interaction will be evaluated among the treatment groups, and if needed it

 Version 7.0 (Amendment 6; US Only), [ADDRESS_340064] squares means (and the associated 
95% confidence interval and p-value) for each randomized TVB-2640 dose group to pooled 
placebo comparison. 
Differences between each randomized TVB-2640 dose group (25 mg, 50 mg) and pooled 
placebo for the key secondary efficacy endpoint, the percentage of subjects achieving a 30% or 
greater reduction of liver fat, as determined by [CONTACT_9268]-PDFF (i.e., a response), will be analyzed 
using CMH methods. The key secondary efficacy analyses will be based on a CMH test in the 
mITT to compare each randomized TVB-2640 dose group with placebo, adjusting for the 
stratification factor (diabetes presence/absence). If a country-by-treatment interaction is found in 
the primary efficacy endpoint, the subjects from the US and China in the 50 mg cohort may be 
analyzed separately for the key secondary efficacy endpoint and analysis of the subjects from 
China will be viewed as supportive/descriptive. To check for other possible interactions, i.e., 
diabetes strata-dependent treatment effects, the Breslow-Day test will be performed; if the p-
value of the Breslow-Day test is ≥0.05, the treatment-by-strata interaction is deemed not 
significant. However, if the interaction effect is statistically significant (i.e., p-value <0.05), then 
the Gail and Simon test will be used to test for the qualitative interaction at a significance level 
of 0.[ADDRESS_340065] 95% confidence interval based on a binomial distribution will 
be calculated for each treatment group. The exact 95% confidence limit for the CMH estimate of 
the common risk difference will also be obtained; a Wald asymptotic approximation with 
continuity correction is an acceptable substitute for the exact limits in the event of computational 
difficulties. Response level definitions other than 30% may be explored in additional supportive 
analyses. 
The primary and key secondary efficacy analyses will be conducted using a fixed-sequence 
strategy to maintain the overall Type I error rate at 0.05. The primary efficacy analyses will 
compare the primary efficacy endpoint between each randomized TVB-[ADDRESS_340066]-baseline visits, the 
changes at 12 weeks will be summarized for each treatment group and compared between each 
randomized TVB-2640 dose group and pooled placebo using a linear mixed-effects model for 
repeated measures in the ITT. The model will include the stratification factor (diabetes

Protocol No. 3V2640-CLIN-005 
 
 Version 7.0 (Amendment 6; US Only), 17 March 2021 presence/absence), treatment group, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as the fixed effects, 
and baseline value as a covariate using an unstructured variance-covariance matrix. The point 
estimates for the least-squares mean of the pairwise difference for each randomized TVB-2640 
dose group and pooled placebo comparison at each visit and the corresponding 95% confidence 
interval and two-sided p-value will be summarized. Other variance-covariance structures may be 
substituted if convergence problems arise. 
Similarly, a generalized linear mixed-effects model for repeated measures based on a logit link 
function will be used for comparing other categorical efficacy endpoints at Week 12 between 
each randomized TVB-2640 dose group and pooled placebo in the ITT. The model will include 
the stratification factor (diabetes presence/absence), treatment group, visit, treatment-by-visit 
interaction as fixed effects and, depending on the nature of the data, the baseline result as fixed 
effect or covariate with an unstructured variance-covariance matrix. The point estimates for the 
least-squares mean of the pairwise difference for each randomized TVB-2640 dose group and 
pooled placebo comparison at each visit and the corresponding 95% confidence interval and two-
sided p-value will be summarized. Other variance-covariance structure may be substituted if 
convergence problems arise.  
Subset analyses will be performed on all efficacy endpoints for subjects enrolled in China to 
evaluate the consistency of results between subjects enrolled in each country.  
Efficacy data will be summarized descriptively for Cohort 3. 
Details for handling of data from the US and Chinese subjects will be described in the SAP. 
Additional details of analysis of other secondary efficacy endpoints and the analysis of 
exploratory and safety endpoints and pharmacokinetics will be described in the SAP. 
13.2.3. Safety Analysis 
No formal statistical testing will be conducted for the safety analyses. Analysis of safety will be 
detailed in the SAP. Subset analyses will be performed on all safety endpoints for subjects 
enrolled in China to evaluate the consistency of results between subjects enrolled in each 
country.

 Version 7.0 (Amendment 6; US Only), 17 March 2021 Appendix A: Algorithm for Evaluating Subjects for a Potential Drug-induced Liver Injury 
(DILI) 
The mean of at least [ADDRESS_340075] 4 to 12 weeks apart during 
screening should be used to establish baseline values; the first measurement may be a historical 
measurement.  
During the study, aminotransferase elevations are to be managed as follows: 
1. Isolated aminotransferase elevation (i.e., total bilirubin - normal): 
ALT or AST Event during the study Action 
Baseline ALT and AST within 
normal range Increase ≥5 × ULN Repeat liver profile (AST, ALT, 
bilirubin and PT/INR) within 
[ADDRESS_340076] 
as per “close observation” 
definition* in the DILI guidance. ALT or AST above normal 
range at baseline increase ≥3 × baseline levels and 
no liver related symptoms 
ALT or AST above normal 
range at baseline increase ≥3x baseline + subject 
experiences liver related 
symptoms (nausea, vomiting, 
right upper quadrant pain) Interrupt study drug. Initiate 
potential DILI evaluation for 
alternative etiologies and repeat 
liver profile and PT/INR within 
48-[ADDRESS_340077]. 
*Close observation as defined in the FDA DILI guidance i.e., laboratory testing and physical examination 
2-3 times per week. Study drug is to be restarted only if a firm alternative etiology is “identified” and the 
liver tests return to baseline. 
2. Elevation of aminotransferase and total bilirubin or cholestatic markers: 
Analyte Event during the study Action 
TB + AST or ALT ↑ TB >2 mg/dL 
and 
↑ ALT or ALT ≥3x baseline or 
5x ULN (whichever comes first) Interrupt study drug. 
Initiate potential DILI evaluation 
for alternative etiologies.  
Repeat liver profile and PT/INR 
within 48-[ADDRESS_340078] under “close 
observation” as defined in the 
DILI guidance. 
Study drug can be restarted only 
if a firm competing etiology is 
identified and the liver tests 
return to baseline. TB, ALP, or GGT  ↑ TB >2 mg/dL  
and 
ALP or GGT ↑ >2X ULN

 Version 7.0 (Amendment 6; US Only), 17 March 2021 Analyte Event during the study Action 
TB OR INR + symptoms 
(regardless of any magnitude 
AST/ALT elevation) Elevation ↑ TB >2 mg/dL 
OR 
INR ≥1.5  
and  
Indicators of immunological 
reaction (i.e., rash or >5% 
eosinophilia), or appearance of 
nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain (symptoms 
consistent with clinical hepatitis) Permanently discontinue study 
drug.  
Initiate potential DILI evaluation 
for alternative etiologies.  
Repeat liver profile and PT/INR 
within 48-[ADDRESS_340079] under “close 
observation” as defined in the 
DILI guidance. 
 
Note the following: 
1. If a subject lives in a remote area, they can be tested locally, with the results 
communicated to the Investigator promptly. 
2. For subjects with Gilbert’s syndrome, a doubling of direct bilirubin instead of total 
bilirubin should be used for close monitoring and TVB-[ADDRESS_340080] be 
followed until the clinical and laboratory abnormalities stabilize or normalize: 
 If close monitoring of a subject is not possible. 
 In the presence of total bilirubin elevation (>2 × ULN or >1.5 × baseline); with any 
degree of aminotransferase elevation; AND if there is appearance of symptoms i.e., 
fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or 
eosinophilia (>5%).  
 If any degree of total bilirubin, ALT, or AST elevation recurs following re-challenge 
with study drug.

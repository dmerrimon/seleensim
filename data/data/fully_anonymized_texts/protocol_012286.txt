Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential  1. INTRODUCTION 
The use of local anesthetics within a surgical wound, i.e., “wound infiltration,” has found 
extensive use in a vast number of patients ( Renck 1994).  Medical opi[INVESTIGATOR_196402] s that such 
infiltration with local anesthetics may be a relatively simple and safe means to reduce post -
operative pain ( Moiniche, Mikkelsen et al. 1998).  The major limitation of the current local 
anesthetics used for infiltration is the limited duration of effect (6 –12 hours) that is observed 
following surgery ( Kehlet and Andersen 2011).  In recent years there has been a dramatic 
increase in day -case surgery.  In this patient population it is estimated that 30 to 40% of the 
patients suffer from moderate to severe pain during the first 24 to 48 hours.  The development of 
a long- acting local anesthetic formulation for this patient population would be of clinical 
significance ( Rawal 2001 ). 
While non- steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have long been used in the treatment of 
post- operative pain ( Moote 1992), there is early evidence that there may be a synergistic 
interact ion between local anesthetics and non- steroidal anti- inflammatory compounds when 
locally administered ( Ortiz, Castañeda- Hernández et al. 2011).  The Sponsor has identified a 
combination of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_196403] a sustained release formulation (HTX -
011), intended for the management of post -operative pain via wound infiltration that has 
demonstrated positive results in a non- clinical model of post -surgical pain  and in an initial study 
in healthy volunteers with its first formulation HTX -011-19.  HTX -[ADDRESS_233277] been composed for clinical evaluation: 
• HTX-011-19: t he vehicle formulation is tri[ethylene gly col] based poly[orthoester]  
polymer with N- methyl -2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and maleic acid.  
• HTX-011-49 t he vehicle formulation is tri[eth ylene glycol] based poly[orthoester]  
polymer with dimethyl sulfoxide  (DMSO) , glycerol triacetate, and maleic acid. 
• HTX-011- 56: the vehicle formulation is tri[ethylene glycol] based poly[orthoester] 
polymer with DMSO, glycerol triacetate, and maleic acid . 
The three formulations differ from each other solely on the basis of either the percentage content of the active ingredients (bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39881]) and or the percentage content of excipi[INVESTIGATOR_196404].  The two  newer formulations , HTX-011-49 and 
HTX-011-56, were developed and incorporate two new excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]:  these formulation s improve 
the ease of delivery while maintaining the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of HTX-011-19. 
The Sponsor has also developed 2 formulation s, HTX-002 and HTX -009, which  are similar  in 
pharmaceutical composition to HTX-011-56 except  that they contain  only bupi[INVESTIGATOR_196405], respectively , as the active pharmaceutical ingredient ( API).  Exploratory studies 
evaluating the antinociceptive effect in a post- operative pain model in domestic pi[INVESTIGATOR_196406] -over PK studies in the beagle dogs demonstrate that the primary pharmacodynamics and 
PK characteristics for HTX -002 are similar to that of HTX -011-56.  B oth the active ingredient s 
(bupi[INVESTIGATOR_39881] ) and the identical biochronomer polymer vehicle have been studied 
in humans.

Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential  2. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The primary objective for Part A is to evaluate the efficacy and duration of analgesia following 
administration of  one of two doses of HTX-011- 19 by [CONTACT_196458]. 
The primary objective of Part s B through G will be to evaluate the efficacy and duration of 
analgesia following administration of HTX -011-49, HTX -011-56, HTX-002, HTX-009, 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (Marcaine) , or normal saline . 
The secondary objectives  to be evaluated in Parts A  through G are as follows : 
• To determine in Part A the optimal administration techniqu e of study drug  
• To determine the safety a nd tolerability of HTX -011, HTX -002, and HTX -009 as 
evaluated throug h physical examination, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, ECGs, and 
incidence of adverse events (AEs) and s erious AEs (SAEs)  
• To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_23183]/or meloxicam in  
HTX-011, HTX -002, and HTX-009 over 120 hours  
• To evaluate the analgesic effects of HTX-011, HTX-002, and HTX -009 over various 
intervals using a series of secondary efficacy endpoints for pain intensity (such as the 
patient’ s global assessment of pain control, time to administration of first dose of rescue 
analgesia, and total and average daily rescue consumption ) 
• To assess the effects of HTX-011, HTX -002, and HTX-[ADDRESS_233278]- treatment  
• To evaluate nausea at 6, 24, 48, and [ADDRESS_233279]- treatment  
• To evaluate the percentage of subjects pain free over time  
Protocol HTX -011-C2015- 202, Version [ADDRESS_233280] s, drug and alcohol 
screen,  12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG), pregnancy testing, vital sign measurements, and  they 
will undergo pain and placebo assessment  training during the screening visit.  
On the day of surgery (Day 0),  after having been reassessed for eligibility,  subject s will undergo 
a unilateral  open inguinal herniorrhaphy  under general anesthesia.  No epi[INVESTIGATOR_196407], nor will any local anesthetic infiltration, other than the administration 
of the  investigational product  (IP), be permitted.  No prophylactic antiemetic , local anesthetics,

HTX-002, HTX-009, Marcaine, or saline, according to a randomization schedule) will be 
administered.   Start and stop time of dosing will be recorded.  Dosing stop time will be 
considered T ime 0. 
Following the completion of surgery and immediate postoperative recovery stay, subject s will be 
transferred to the unit.  Staff members at the unit will be blinded to study treatment.  Subject s 
will stay at the unit for approximately [ADDRESS_233281] s will be scheduled to return on Day 10 for additional efficacy 
and safety assessments and Day 28 for an assessment of wound healing  and collection of AEs 
and concomitant medicati ons.  Part A of the study will determine the optimal technique of 
administrati on of study drug .  Efficacy assessments will include pain intensity scoring, use of 
rescue medication,  Patient Global Assessment (PGA) of pain control , and assessments of nausea , 
and use of analgesia rescue medicine .  Safety assessments will include monitoring of AEs, 
physical examinations, vital sign measurements, clinical laboratory tests, ECGs, and wound healing assessments  and photographs of the surgical site.  Blood samples will be obtained to 
assess meloxicam and bupi[INVESTIGATOR_196408].  Subjects will also receive a phone call 
from the study site on Day [ADDRESS_233282] follow -up information on postoperative pain and pain 
medications.  
3.2. Rationale for Study Design and Control Groups  
This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of three  formulation s of the combination of a 
known local anesthetic, bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] , and a known anti -inflammatory drug, meloxicam 
(HTX-011), via different administration techniques (injection into the  surgical wound and/or 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_196384]).

4.4. Lifestyle Guidelines  
4.4.1. Confinement  
Prior to the surgical procedure ( Day 0 ), subject s will arrive at the study clinic in sufficient time 
to prepare for the procedure and confirm eligibility to participate in the study.  In Part  A of the 
study, appropriate ly qualified  subject s will be assigned randomly  to one of 5 treatment cohorts of 
HTX-011- 19 or  to saline during the unilateral open inguinal herniorrhaphy procedure.  In Part B, 
subjects will be assigned randomly to one of 4 treatment groups of either HTX -011- 49 or HTX -
011-56 or to saline , via the technique that was determined to be  optimal in Part A.  In Part C, 
subjects will be assigned randomly to one of the 9 treatment groups of HTX -002 or HTX -011, 
Marcaine, or to saline .  In Part  D, subjects will be assigned randomly to one of the 3 treatment 
groups of HTX -011-56 with or without  fentanyl administration at the conclusion of the case  and 
before study drug administration .  In Part E, subjects will be assigned randomly to one of the 2 
treatment groups of HTX -009 or normal saline.  In Part F, subjects will be assigned randomly to 
one of the 2 treatment groups of HTX -011- 56 or normal saline with fentanyl administration at

assigned randomly to one of the 3 treatment groups of HTX -011- 56, Marcaine, or normal saline 
with fentanyl administration at the conclusion of the case and before study drug administration.  
(See Section  4.6 for more info rmation on treatment cohorts for each part of the study.)  Subject s 
will be discharged from the study clinic on Day 3, about 72 hours after receiving study medication.  They will be scheduled to return to the study clinic 24 hours later, i.e., approximatel y 96 hours, and at 120 hours aft er receiving study medication.  
Bathroom privileges will be restricted during the postoperative confinement period.  Following completion of the surgery, subjects will be restricted to use of a bedpan, bedside commode, or bathroom privileges via wheelchair  through completion of 12- hour assessments;  bathroom 
privileges may be loosened  at any time at the discretion of the investigator.   While confined at 
the study clinic following surgery, subject s will be required to remain resting in bed at least [ADDRESS_233291] postoperative care instructions. 
4.5. Surgical Procedure  
On the day of surgery (Day 0), subject s will undergo unilateral open inguinal hernia with tension 
free technique using implanted mesh .  Surgeries should be scheduled so as to allow for all 
surgical procedures to be completed by [CONTACT_3450] 5:00 pm on the day of surgery.

Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential  4.5.1. Anesthesia Protocol and Administration of Study Medication 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Anesthesia  
The anesthetic protocol below is a guide that should be followed to minimize inter -subject  
variability to the greatest extent possible.  However, it is understood that hemodynamic 
fluctuations and other intraoperative events may necessitate some deviation from the standard regimen.  
The surgery will be performed under general anesthesia  according to local practices ; for 
example,  inducing s edation with up to 2 mg midazolam is permitted , or induction with propofol 
(and lidocaine to decrease injection pain from propofol is permitted) , and  fentanyl should be 
limited to no more than [ADDRESS_233292] 
(LMA ) placement is preferred over intubation.  Succinylcholine is not permitted.  Volatile 
anesthetics are to be used for maintenance of anesthesia, and nitrous oxide is not permitted.  No epi[INVESTIGATOR_196409], nor will any local anesthetic infiltration, other than 
the administration of the IP , be permitted.  No prophylactic antiemetic s, local anesthetics , or 
analgesic medications are allowed at any time.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Study Drug Administration (Parts A , B, C , F, and G ) 
Once the hernia repair is completed , study medication will be administered by [CONTACT_196469] 
(“injection”), instillation (“topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]”) , or both, depending on the study group assignment. 
Wound Infiltration  
For subjects receiving wound infiltration of study drug only: 
• Approximately 1/[ADDRESS_233293] above the level of the fascia,  
• Approximately 1/3 is placed immediately underneath the aponeurosis of the external 
oblique above the inguinal canal (taking care to avoid the nerves), and  
• Approximately 1/[ADDRESS_233294] two steps, it is expected that a number of intrusions of the needle will be necessary 
to cover the area.  
Instillation  
For subjects receiving the topi[INVESTIGATOR_196410], the s tudy drug is prepared in the 
syringe and then evenly applied throughout the surgical wound prior to closure at both the level 
below a nd the level above the fascia.  
Protocol HTX -011-C2015- 202, Version 12  Page 30 of 83 
 
 
Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential  Both  
For subjects receiving both wound infiltration and instillation, both of the above steps are to be 
followed. 
In all cases, start and stop time of dosing will be recorded; dosing stop time  will then be 
considered Time 0 (T0).  Details of an administration will be recorded on a worksheet which will 
be used in the dictation of the surgical notes and will become part of the source document. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Study Drug Administration (Parts D and E) 
Once the he rnia repair is completed , study drug will be administered by [CONTACT_196470] a “combination” technique comprising both wound infiltration 
(“injection”) and instillation (“topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]”).  
Use approximately  ½ the study drug for wound infiltration . This portion of study drug 
should be administered as follows: 
• Approximately 1/[ADDRESS_233295]  above the 
level of the fascia. 
• Approximately 1/3 is placed immediately underneath the aponeuros is of the external 
oblique above the inguinal canal (taking care to avoid the nerves). 
• Approximately 1/[ADDRESS_233296] two steps, it is expected that a number of intrusions of the needle will b e necessary 
to cover the area.  
Use the remaining amount of study drug  for instillation : 
The s tudy drug is prepared in the syringe and then evenly applied throughout the surgical wound 
prior to closure at both the level below a nd the level above the fascia.  
In all cases, start and stop time of dosing will be recorded; dosing stop time will then be considered Time 0 (T0).  Details of an administration will be recorded on a worksheet , which 
will be used in the dictation of the surgical notes and will becom e part of the source document.

4.8. Blinding and Unblinding of Study Medications  
Since HTX-011, HTX -002, and HTX -009 formulations are colored and viscous solutions 
whereas  saline and Marcaine are  not, and the volume administered varies with dose, this renders 
obsolete any double- blinded study drug administration.  Therefore, the site’s surgical and 
pharmacy staff will not be blinded to the study medication administered .  However , the conduct 
of the  study will be observer blind.  Once  surgery is completed and subject s have been 
transferred to the clinical unit, all site staff in the clinical unit involved in the assessment of safety and efficacy will be blinded to the treatment assignment, and (s)he will remain masked to treatment assignments throughout the conduct of this study.  The study blind may be broken only if the safety of a subject  is at risk and the treatment plan for that subject  depends on which study 
medication he or she received.  If knowledge of the treatment assignment is absol utely necessary 
for the management of a subject ’s safety,  the investigator must contact [CONTACT_196473].  If a subject ’s data are unblinded without the prior knowledge of the 
sponsor, the investigator must notify the sponsor as soon as possible and no later than the next business morning.  All circumstances surrounding a premature unblinding must be clearly documented. 
4.9. Treatment Compliance  
Since study medication is being administered  as a component of  the surgical procedure , a lack of 
treatment compliance is not expected .  The exact date, time, and dose of study medication

administered and that the syringes are emptied.  
4.10. Drug Accountability  
The investigator (or designee) will sign for the study medications when they are received.  The 
study medication must be handled and stored as described in the pharmacy manual and dispensed only to those subject s formally entered into the study. 
At the completion of the study and after reconciliation of all delivery and usage records, any unused study medication supplied by [CONTACT_137572] (or designee) or

symptoms.  
5.5. Appropriateness of  Assessments  
The efficacy measures utilized in this study are commonly used in clinical studies performed in 
acute postoperative pain populations.  The timing of assessments is intended to evaluate the time to onset of analgesia, duration of effect, and magnitude of benefit. 
Safety measures used in this study are standard for clinical trials of investigational medications.  
Protocol HTX -011-C2015- 202, Version [ADDRESS_233331] medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related. 
An AE may be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study medication, whether or not considered causally associated with the use of the study medication.  Any abnormal laboratory 
value deemed clinically significant by [CONTACT_093], regardless of causal relationship, must be reported as an AE.  
Examples of an AE include the following: 
• significant or unexpected worsening or ex acerbation of the condition or indication under 
study 
• exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent preexisting condition, including either an 
increase in frequency or intensity of the condition (e.g., abnormal physical examination 
finding) 
• signs, symptoms, or clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction  
• signs, symptoms, or clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of the study medication or 
a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be reported as an AE or SAE, unless 
nonserious or serious sequelae oc cur) 
The following examples are not considered AEs: 
• medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy), although the condition 
that leads to the procedure is an AE 
• anticipated day to day fluctuations of preexisting disease(s) or condition(s) (including 
laboratory values) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen  
• the disease or disorder being studied, or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the disease or disorder being studied, unless they become more severe or occur  with a greater 
frequency than expected for the subject’s condition 
• transient paresthesia that are considered to be clinically normal (would be expected to occur as a long -acting local anesthetic wears off)  
All AEs, whether volunteered, elicited, or noted on physical examination and regardless of 
causality or seriousness, will be assessed and recorded in the eCRF beginning after administration of study medication through the Day 10 study visit.

Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential  6.2. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is defined as any event that meets the following criteria:  
• It results in death or is life -threatening (i.e., presents an immediate risk of death from the 
event as it occurred).  (This criterion is not intended to include an AE that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, mi ght have caused death.) 
• It results in persistent or substantial disability or incapacitation.  (This criterion is not 
intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as 
uncomplicated headache, diarrhea, or sprained ankle.) 
• It results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• It results in prolongation of an existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
• It is a congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
• It requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the above outcomes. 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in determining whether an AE is serious when considering important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_196439].  Examples of such medical events that may also be considered serious include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a preexisting condition that did not worsen from baseline does not meet the definition of an SAE. 
Social or convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_137541] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_196440].  
6.2.1. Serious Adverse Events That Occur Before Administration of Study Medication  
Before administration of study medication, only SAEs assessed by [CONTACT_196479] (e.g., related to study procedures or a change in existing therapy) will be transcribed onto the SAE reporting form and reported to the sponsor. 
6.2.2. Serious Adverse Events That Occur After Study Completion  
If an investi gator becomes aware of an SAE or death that occurs in a subject  more than [ADDRESS_233332] ’s last study visit and that investigator considers the event to be related to the study 
medication, the investigator is obligated to report the SAE to the sponsor as outlined in 
Section  6.7. 
6.3. Definition of a Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A suspected adverse reaction is defined as any adverse event for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the adverse event was caused by [CONTACT_5257].  For the pur poses of IND safety 
reporting, “reasonable possibility”  means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
Protocol HTX -011-C2015- 202, Version 12  Page 50 of 83 
 
 
Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential  between the drug and the adverse event.  A su spected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of 
certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.  
6.4. Definition of a Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A serious s uspected adverse reaction is any s uspected adverse reaction that is determined to be 
serious, based on the outcomes of a SAE described in Section  6.2; i.e. death, life -threatening, 
causes or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], causes a persistent of significant incapacity or 
substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital abnormality/birth defect.  
6.5. Recording and Evaluating Adverse Events and Serious Adver se Events  
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event on the basis of signs, symptoms, or other clinical information.  In such cases, the diagnosis, not the individual signs or symptoms, should be documented as the AE or SAE. 
6.5.1. Assess ment of Intensity  
The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the 
study, using his or her clinical judgment.  The intensity of each AE and SAE recorded in the eCRF should be assigned to one of the following cat egories:  
• mild: an event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423] , causes minimal discomfort, and does 
not interfere with everyday activities  
• moderate: an event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday 
activities  
• severe: an event that prevents normal everyday activities  
An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE.  Severity is a term used to describe the intensity of a specific event, and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.  The event itself, howeve r, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a severe 
headache).  This is not the same as serious, which is based on the subject’s or event’s outcome or on action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s l ife or 
functioning (see Section  6.2). 
6.5.2. Assessment of Causality  
The investigator is obligated to use his or her clinical judgment to assess the relations hip 
between the study medication and the occurrence of each AE or SAE.  For this study, adverse 
events that are considered by [CONTACT_95334] a Possible, Probable, or Definite relationship to the investigational product are considered to be “related” to the investigational product; unlikely and unrelated are considered to be “not related” to the investigational product.  Sponsor assessment of causality may differ from Investigator assessment in accordance with FDA guidance, Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE studies. 
The investigator will assess the relationship to the study medication by [CONTACT_196480]:  
Protocol HTX -011-C2015- 202, Version 12  Page 51 of 83 
 
 
Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential  • Definitely Related: An AE has a strong temporal relationship to the study drug.  The AE 
is most likely explained by [CONTACT_196481].  Dechallenge and rechallenge (if possible) are 
positive.  The AE is consistent with a known response to the study drug.  Another 
etiology is unlikely or significantly less likely.  
• Probably Related: An AE has a strong temporal relationship to the study drug.  The AE is 
more likely explained by [CONTACT_137581].  Dechallenge (if performed) 
is positive.  
• Possibly Related: An AE has a reasonable temporal relationship to study drug.  The AE 
could have been due to another equally likely ca use.  Dechallenge is positive.  
• Not Related: The subject did not receive the study drug OR the AE has no temporal 
relationship to study drug OR the AE has a much more likely alternate etiology OR the AE is due to an underlying or concurrent illness or effect of another drug. 
Even in situations in which minimal information is available for the initial SAE report, it is important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before transmitting the SAE reporting form and completing the AE eCRF page(s).  The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements.  The investigator may change his or her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242] -up information and 
amend the SAE reporting form and AE eCRF page(s) accordingly. 
6.5.3. Assessment of Outcome  
All SAEs must be followed until they are resolved, the condition stabilizes, the events are 
otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up.  The investigator will assess the outcome 
of the event by [CONTACT_137582]:  
• Resolved: The event resolved or the subject recovered without sequelae.  An event (either 
serious or nonserious) occurred and had an endpoint, and the subject experienced no restrictions.  Examples include stent placemen t for coronary artery disease (a device 
implanted is not a sequela), an appendectomy (a scar is not a sequela), a postoperative wound infection, or an upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092]. 
• Resolved with sequelae: The event has at least one secondary outcome t hat may result in 
permanent disability, functional limitation, or both.  Such sequelae are usually limited to SAEs.  Examples include hip replacement resulting in foot drop (foot drop is not the intended outcome but is a risk of surgery), stroke resulting in paralysis, or emboli formation after a bacterial infection resulting in a renal infarct and loss of renal function. 
• Not resolved: At the end of the study, a nonserious event either has not changed in 
intensity or may not have recovered to baseline values, and the outcome is unknown.  
Examples include headache, low- grade fever, or nausea.  
• Unknown: The subject has withdrawn from the study p rematurely or is lost to follow -up, 
and the status of the event is unknown. 
• Death  
6.5.4. Assessment of Expectedness  
For the purposes of IND safety reporting, adverse events and suspected adverse events should be assessed as being expected or unexpected.  An AE or s uspected adverse r eaction is considered 
Protocol HTX -011-C2015- 202, Version 12  Page 52 of 83 
 
 
Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential  unexpected if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or 
severity that has been observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application . 
6.6. Follow- up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Nonserious AEs will be followed after the last scheduled study visit until an appropriate resolution can be documented. 
After the occurrence of an AE or SAE, the investigator is required to follow ea ch subject 
proactively and provide further information on the subject’s condition.  All AEs and SAEs 
documented at a previous visit or contact [CONTACT_196482]. 
SAEs will be followed until the event resolves, the condition stabilizes, the event is otherwise 
explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up.  The investigator will ensure that follow -up 
information provided to the sponsor includes results of any additional laboratory tests or investi gations, histopathologic examinations, or consultations with other healthcare professionals 
that serve to clarify the nature of the event, the cause of the event, or both. 
New or updated information will be recorded on the originally completed SAE reporting form 
and entered into the eCRF pages, with all changes signed and dated by [CONTACT_093].  The updated SAE reporting form should be resubmitted to the sponsor within the time frames outlined in Section  6.7. 
6.7. Prompt Reporting of Serious Adverse Events to the Sponsor  
Once the investigator determines that an event meets the protocol definition of an SAE, he or she must notify the sponsor within [ADDRESS_233333] BE REPORTED TO THE SPONSOR IMMEDIATELY (within 24 hours).

E-mail transmission is the preferred method to transmit SAE information.  In rare circumstances 
and in the absence of e -mail capacity, notification by [CONTACT_39984], with a copy 
of the SAE reporting form sent by [CONTACT_9338].  Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to complete the SAE reporting form and eCRF pages within the time frames outlined.  
If the investigator does not have all information regarding an SAE, he or she must not wait to receive additional information before notifying the sponsor of the event.  The form must be updated when additional information is received.  Follow -up information received on all SAEs 
must be forwarded to the sponsor by [CONTACT_196484].  
6.8. Regulatory Reporting Requirements 
The investigator must promptly report all SAEs to the sponsor in accordance with the  procedures 
detailed in Section  6.7, “Prompt Reporting of Serious Adverse Events to the Sponsor.”  The 
sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify, as appropriate, both the local regulatory authority and 
other regulatory agencies about the safety of a product under clinical investigation.  Prompt notification of SAEs by [CONTACT_196485] s uspected adverse r eaction that are either unexpected or observed with 
increasing occurrence be reported and legal obligations and ethical responsibilities regarding the safety of other subjects ar e met.  
Investigator letters are prepared according to sponsor policy and are forwarded to the investigators as necessary.  An investigator letter is prepared for any s uspected adverse r eaction 
that is attributable to study medication, serious, and unexpected.  The purpose of the investigator letter is to fulfill specific regulatory and GCP requirements regarding the product under investigation.  
The investigator, or responsible person according to local requirements, must comply with requirements related to the reporting of SAEs to the IRB or IEC. 
6.9. Precautions  
Any subject  who becomes pregnant during the study must be discontinued immediately but 
should be followed through delivery or termination of the pregnancy.  A subject  should also 
notify the investigator if she becomes pregnant within [ADDRESS_233336] be notified of all pregnancies reported t o the investigator (see Section  6.[ADDRESS_233337] information).

7.3. General Considerations for Statistical Analysis 
7.3.1. Analysis Datasets  
Intent- to-Treat (ITT) Analysis Set: The ITT set will include all subject s who are randomize d to 
receive study medication.  
Efficacy Set: The efficacy analysis set will include all subject s who are randomized to receive 
study medication an d have recorded at least one post dosing PI [INVESTIGATOR_103835].  This analysis set is noted 
as the modified Intend- to-Treat (mITT) set.  
Safety Set: The safety set will include all treated subjects and will be used for safety  and 
tolerability assessments.  
7.3.2. Test Hypothes is and P Value Justification 
The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between  each comparison (pairwise or pooled 
group comparison) .  The alternative hypothesis is  there is a difference for the comparison . 
Each pairwise or pooled group comparison will be evaluated via [ADDRESS_233343] at the 
0.05 level of significance.  Nominal p value will be reported without adjustment for multiplicity.  
7.3.3. Procedures for Handling Missing Data  
Unless indicated otherwise (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  and [IP_ADDRESS]), no imputation will be done for 
missing data . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. PI [INVESTIGATOR_196441] s are expected to assess their postoperative pain intensity according to the pain 
intensity schedule; those PI [INVESTIGATOR_196442].  Subject s who 
require rescue analgesia are expected to report their pain intensity immediately before taking the 
rescue medication; this PI [INVESTIGATOR_196443]- rescue PI.  The duration of analgesic effect 
will be determined for the rescue medication (e.g., the anal gesic window for one oxycodone 10 
mg tablet is 6 hours); this analgesic duration is referenced as the analgesic window of this rescue 
medication.  When the assessment of a scheduled PI [INVESTIGATOR_196444] (inclu sive) of the rescue medication, the scheduled PI [INVESTIGATOR_196445]- rescue PI [INVESTIGATOR_196446].  This method is 
referenced as the Windowed Last Observation Carried Forward (WLOCF).  The original scheduled PI [INVESTIGATOR_196447] “imputed” PI [INVESTIGATOR_32005].  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Other Missing PI [CONTACT_134698](s)

missing PI [INVESTIGATOR_32005].  All imputed PI [INVESTIGATOR_196450].  
Additional missing data imputation methods may be used to as sess the robustness of the efficacy 
data.  The details will be discussed in the statistic al analysis plan for the study.  
7.3.4. Derived Variables  
Prior to data base lock, a complete statistical analysis plan will be developed which will describe in detail the calculation of all efficacy variables . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Study Population Summaries  
Population summaries will be provided for the safety analysis set included in this study. 
7.3.5. Disposition  
The summary tables will provide frequency counts for subject disposition (all treated subject s, 
subject s who completed the study, subject s who discontinued from the study, and reason for 
discontinuation) by [CONTACT_137590]. 
Disposition in terms of number of subject s excluded from each analysis sets (mITT, safety) will 
also be provided by [CONTACT_137591].

The demographic summary will include descriptive statistics for age, sex, race, weight, height, 
and BMI for the overall and by [CONTACT_1570].  
7.3.7. Protocol Violations 
All protocol violations and deviations will be identified.  Tabulation may  be provided if data  is 
warranted . 
7.3.8. Treatment Compliance  
Since study medication is administered intra -operatively, no formal summary of treatment 
compliance will be produced. 7.3.9. Prior and Concomitant Medications  
All prior and concomitant medications will be tabulated for the overall study population.  Prior 
and concomitant medications will be coded to the therapeutic drug classes and generic drug names using the World Health Organization (WHO) drug classifications  version 1Q2013 or 
higher. 
Protocol HTX -011-C2015- 202, Version [ADDRESS_233345] dose of rescue medication will be presented in the 
Statistical A nalysis P lan. 
7.4.3. Patient Global Assessment (PGA) of Pain Control 
Number and percent of subjects in each global pain control category (0- poor, 1- fair, 2 -good, 3-
very good, or 4- excellent) will be tabulated by [CONTACT_1570].  The difference between the 
groups in global pain control will be evaluated based on proportion of subjects rated their pain control as good, very good, or excell ent using Fisher’s exact test.  
7.4.4. Proportion of Subject s Requir ing Rescue Medication  
The analysis will evaluate the relative risk ( each HTX-011 formulation vs. saline, each HTX -011 
formulation vs. Marcaine , HTX-011- 56 vs. HTX-002, and HTX-009 vs. saline ) to require rescue 
medications during the treatment phase of the  study.  Proportion of subjects that used rescue 
medications at least once will be tabulated by [CONTACT_22058] t group; treatment group difference s will 
be assessed as described in  the S tatistical A nalysis P lan.

Resting vital sign values at each time point collected will be summarized by [CONTACT_196489].  
7.5.4. Electrocardiograms  
The number and proportion of subjects with abnormal ECG findings at each time point collected will be tabulated by [CONTACT_1570].  A data listing will be provided for subjects with changes from normal at baseline to abnormal and clinically significant after baseline by [CONTACT_3148].  
7.5.5. Subgroup Analyses for Safety Endpoints  
No subgroup analysis is planned for safety endpoints. 
7.6. Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
The PK parameters for bupi[INVESTIGATOR_23183] /or meloxic am will be calculated using 
non-compartmental analysis and sum marized for formulations of HTX -011, HTX-002, HTX-
009, and for Marcaine. 7.7. Interim Evaluation 
An evaluation of the data in Part A will be used to determine  the optimal technique of 
administration of study drug for Part B  and Part C .  An evaluation of the dat a in Part B is also 
planned to determine which formulation/dose to be used for Part C.

The ethical standards defined within GCP are intended to ensure the followi ng: 
• Human subjects are provided with an adequate understanding of the possible risks of 
their participation in the study, and they have a free choice to participate or not. 
• The study is conducted with diligence and in conformance with the protocol in such a 
way as to ensure the integrity of the findings. 
• The potential benefits of the research justify the risks. 
Heron Therapeutics, Inc. is the sponsor of study HTX -011-C2015-202.  The sponsor (or its 
designee) is responsible for all of the following: 
• selectin g qualified investigators  
• providing investigators with the information they need to conduct the investigation properly 
• ensuring proper monitoring of the investigation 
• ensuring that appropriate regulatory agencies and all participating investigators are properly informed of significant new information regarding AEs or risks associated with 
HTX-011, HTX -002, or HTX-009. 
8.1.3. Informed Consent  
The sponsor (or its designee) will provide investigators with a multicenter informed consent 
form for this study.  Investigators may adapt the information to suit the needs of their institution, if necessary (although it must reflect the required elements of informed consent specified in 21 CFR Part 50.25).  The final informed consent form must be accepted by [CONTACT_196491].  Investigators must provide the sponsor with an unsigned copy of 
the final informed consent form before and after it is approved by [CONTACT_4186].  If any new information becomes available that might affect subject s’ willingness to participate in the study, 
or if any amendments to the protocol require changes to the informed consent form, the sponsor will provide investigators with a revised informed consent form.  The IRB or IEC must provide written approval of any revisions to the informed consent form in advance of its use. 
Investigators must provide subject s with all the information necessary to make an informed 
decision about their participation in the study, including the nature and intended purpose of the 
study, possible benefits, and possible risks. 
All information in the informed consent form should be provided in a language (whether written 
or spoken) that is as nontechnical as practical and that is understandable to the subject s. 
Before written informed consent is obtaine d, the subject  should be given ample time and 
opportunity to inquire about the details of the study.  All questions must be answered to the satisfaction of the subject (or his or her legally authorized representative). 
Protocol HTX -011-C2015- 202, Version [ADDRESS_233348]  (or his or her legally authorized representative) and any other 
signatories as required by [CONTACT_4186]. 
If a subject (or legally authorized representative) cann ot read, a short form approved by [CONTACT_196492].  Only the short form itself is to be signed by [CONTACT_196493].  However, the witness shall sign both the short form and a copy of the summary, and the person actually obtaining the consent shall sign the copy of the summary in accordance with 21 CFR 50.27 (b2). 
After all required signatures have been obtained, a copy of the informed consent form should be 
provided to the subject , and the original must be kept on file at the sit e and made available for 
review by [CONTACT_456].  Documentation of the informed consent discussion must be noted in the subject’s case history.  
8.1.4. Investigator Reporting Requirements  
The investigator is responsible for completing and maintaining adequate and a ccurate eCRFs and 
source documentation.  Source documentation constitutes original records (first point of entry, either hard copy or electronic), which may include progress notes, medication administration records, operation reports, laboratory reports, discharge summaries, and so on. 
8.2. Study Monitoring  
The sponsor (or its designee) is responsible for ensuring the proper conduct of the study with 
regard to subject  protection, ethics, protocol adherence, site procedures, and integrity of the data.  
At regular  intervals during the study, the sponsor’s study monitors will contact [CONTACT_196494], telephone calls, and letters in order to review study progress and eCRF completion and to address any concerns or questions regarding the study conduct.  During monitoring visits, the following aspects of study conduct will be carefully reviewed: subjects’ informed consent documents, subject  recruitment procedures, subject s’ compliance with the 
study procedures, source -data verification, drug accoun tability, use of concomitant therapy by 
[CONTACT_1766], AE and SAE documentation and reporting, and quality of data. 
8.3. Quality Assurance 
The sponsor, a regulatory authority, or an IRB representative may visit the study site at any time 
during the study or after completion of the study to perform audits or inspections.  The purpose of a sponsor audit or regulatory inspection is to examine systematically and independently all study related activities and documents to determine whether these activities were conducted according to the protocol, GCP, ICH guidelines, and any other applicable regulatory requirements.  Investigators should contact [CONTACT_167449] a regulatory agency about an inspection at their site. 
8.4. Study and Site Closure  
If the s ponsor, investigator, or officials from regulatory agencies discover conditions arising 
during the study that indicate that the study should be halted or that the study site should be

Heron Therapeutics, Inc. Confidential  closed, this action may be taken after appropriate consultation between the sponsor and 
investigator.  Conditions that may warrant termination of the study include, but are not limited to, the following: 
• discovery of an unexpected, serious, or unacceptable risk to the subject s enrolled in the 
study 
• submission of knowingly false information from the research facility to the sponsor, 
study monitor, or regulatory agencies 
• failure of the investigator to comply with GCP (e.g., ICH guidelines, regulatory agency guidelines) 
• insufficient adherence to protocol requirements or an unacceptably high rate of missing, 
erroneous, or improperly collected data 
• evidence from the blinded data of sufficient technical problems with the study that one 
could believe with a high degree of certainty that subject s are being exposed to the 
investigational drug without a realistic expectation of evaluable data  
• a decision on the part of the sponsor to suspend or discontinue testing evaluation or development of the product 
• failure of the investigator to enroll subjects into the study at an acceptable rate  
8.5. Records Retention

Body Mass Index Calculations 
 
Body Mass Index =  Weight in kilograms  / (height in meters)2 
Meters  = inches  × 0.0254 
Kilograms  = pounds × 0.45 
 Example : 
For a man who weighs 165 pounds and is 71 inches tall: 165 lbs. × 0.45 = 74.25 kg  
71 in. × 0.0254 = 1.8 m 74.25 / (1.8 × 1.8) = 22.92 kg/m

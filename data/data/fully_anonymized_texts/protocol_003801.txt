PROTOCOL  TITLE  
The Feasibility & Effectiveness of Virtual Reality in Reducing Pain for Older Adults with Knee 
Osteoarthritis   
FUNDING  
• None  
VERSION DATE  
[ADDRESS_1286772] is to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of VR as a 
treatment option for older adults with chronic osteoarthritic knee pain. 
2. Aim 1: Implement a pi[INVESTIGATOR_915145]. 
3. Aim 2: Analyze the feasibility of VR for this population, including looking at simulation sickness factors and drop out reasons/rates, and its impact on chronic pain immediately prior to and immediately post intervention, as well as a few days post intervention. 
4. Sub-study Aim 1: The aim of this sub- study is to compare the effectiveness of a virtual 
reality meditation session and a non-immersive meditation session for improving pain, affect, and physiological vital stats in adults with fibromyalgia.  
5. Sub- study Aim 2: We hypothesize that the VR meditation session will facilitate greater 
improvements in pain, affect, and physiological vital stats as compared to the non-immersive meditation intervention.  
 
BACKGROUND
 AND  SIGNIFICANCE  
Thirty percent of older adults in the [LOCATION_002] report experiencing chronic pain, with 
41% of this subset of the population experiencing chronic joint pain (NIH Pain Consortium, n.d.). Knee osteoarthritis (OA) affects 37% of individuals aged 60 years or older who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination (Sharma, 2021). This condition typi[INVESTIGATOR_915146], stiffness, reduced joint motion and muscle weakness, and chronic pain that can have profound effects on physical function, psychological parameters, and overall quality of life. P ast studies at the PMC have looked 
at the physiological mechanisms involved with chronic knee OA and the older adult population, the site has had limited funding to research nonpharmacological treatments such as virtual reality. Virtual reality has been shown to be feasible for a variety of populations, including young people with autism experiencing specific phobia , pediatric

 burn patients, and young adults (Maskey et al., 2019; Hoffman et al., 2014, Sakhare et al., 
2019). However, there is limited evidence on the feasibility of VR for treating pain for the older adult population. This study aims to study they effectiveness of VR for chronic 
pain for older adults and is necessary to determine best methods to feasibly integrate VR into clinical practice.  
Sub- study:  
Fibromyalgia (FM)  is a debilitating rheumatological syndrome which affects millions of 
adults in the [LOCATION_002]. The condition presents with widespread chronic muscular 
pain and reduced pain thresholds (CDC, 2020). Additional symptoms that often accompany FM include fat igue, insomnia, and negative affect. As with knee OA, the 
chronic pain that is caused by [CONTACT_915150], psychological parameters, and overall quality of life. Just as VR distraction may be a useful tool for clients experiencing chronic knee OA, the same principles apply for pain management for those with FM. Previous research has demonstrated that affect was improved for clients with FM who participated in a 10- minute VR mindfulness session 
(Botella, e t al, 2013). Such findings highlight the potential benefits of VR and 
mindfulness meditation for clients with FM. There is a great deal that remains unknown about the effectiveness of these pain management techniques. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_915147].

Study Design:  
Potential subjects that are interested in the study will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], research staff will 
describe the study and go through a phone screen to make sure the subject is eligible to participate.  The day before the visit the subject will be contact[CONTACT_915151] -19 Screening Questionnaire. If  they answer “Yes” to any 
questions between 2- [ADDRESS_1286774] 
experience with VR, the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS),Survey of Pain Attitudes (SOPA), the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS), the PROMIS Emotional Distress Short Form, and the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form. Answering the surveys will take [ADDRESS_1286775]’s VR experience, the User Engagement Scale, the Igroup Presence 
Questionnaire, the Simulator Sickness Symptoms, the Meditation Experience 
Questionnaire, 2 Numeric Rating Scale for pain , the PANAS,  and the Patient Global 
Impression of Change (PGIC). Then, we will ask a short set of open-ended questions 
related to overal l experience with the VR and meditation, feedback about the session, and 
willingness to utilize this intervention again.  We will audio tape the responses.  
Follow-Up Questionnaires 
Prior to ending the session we will determine if the subject prefers to complete the follow -
up questions by [CONTACT_915152].  Within a few days after the intervention, we will contact [CONTACT_915153].  These surveys include, the BPI -SF, the PGIC, the PANAS, the PROMIS 
Emotional Distress Short Forms for anxiety, depression and anger, the PCS. If we have not heard from subject within [ADDRESS_1286776] them with completing follow -up questionnaires. These 
surveys will take about 10-20 minutes to complete. 
Sub- study Design:  
Potential subjects that are interested in the study will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], research staff will describe the study and go through a phone screen to make sure the subject is eligible to participate.  The day before the visit the subject will be contact[CONTACT_915154] l be read the 
Research Participant COVID -19 Screening Questionnaire. If they answer “Yes” to any 
questions between 2- [ADDRESS_1286777] research staff and reschedule their session 
time 
Pre-intervention Tasks 
Upon completing the informed consent portion, vitals will be collected. Heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) will be measured. Participant will complete the following surveys, A pain numerical rating scale (NRS) and the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) will all be used to evaluate the participants’ pain levels and their perceptions of pain. The Brief Pain Inventory- Short Form and the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire both assess the 
influences pain has on their lives. Psychosocial factors will be measured using the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) and the PROMIS Emotional Distress Short Form for 
anxiety, depression, and anger. 
Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST): 
QST measurements will include pressure pain sensitivity assessed using an analog 
algometer with a 1 -cm2 rubber probe (FPK20, Wagner Instruments, Greenwich, CT, [LOCATION_003]) 
 Page 5 of 8 
 to quantify pressure pain thresholds (PPT) on the bilateral trapezius muscles and temporal 
summation in triplicate using a 40 g Neuropen Neurotip (Owen Mumford, Oxfordshire, [LOCATION_008]) a train of 10 identical stimuli (1 Hz) using a metronome for timing.  
Virtual Task  
Participants will engage and follow along with a 10- [ADDRESS_1286778]-Intervention Surveys 
Immediately following completion of the meditation sessions, vital signs will be taken for 
a second time (HR and BP). QST will then be performed for a second time. Three surveys will relate to the VR or non- immersive meditation experiences, the User 
Engagement Scale (UES), the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ), and the Meditation Experience Questionnaire (MEQ). The participant will conclude by [CONTACT_915155]-intervention ones. Those are the pain num erical rating scale (NRS) and the PANAS.  
  
FORESEEABLE
 RISKS  AND  DISCOMFORTS  
Risks from VR:  
Contact [CONTACT_915156]:  Participants’ vision is occluded by [CONTACT_915157] (VR) 
headset.  In general, they will perform the VR sitting, but the program may prompt them 
to move their arms and/or legs during the session.  
Simulator Sickness: Some participants experience simulator sickness while in the 
VR experience particularly after prolonged exposure. Simulator sickness symptoms can include fatigue, headache, eye strain, difficulty focusing, increased saliva in mouth, sweating, or nausea. This risk is moderate.  We have 3 methods to reduce this risk. 1) 
Dosage of VR for this study is between 10-20 minutes which has been reported as typi[INVESTIGATOR_915148], so risk for motion sickness is reduced. 2) Participants wi ll 
complete the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire after each experience to monitor for motion sickness. 3) Participants can halt any VR at any time for any reason. 
Seizures: Some people may experience severe dizziness, seizures, eye or muscle 
twitching or blackouts triggered by [CONTACT_915158].  This risk is quite small.  We have 2 ways to reduce this risk: 1) People with a known risk for seiz ures 
 Page 6 of 8 
 will be excluded from this study. 2) If a subject experiences any of these symptoms we 
will immediately stop the VR.  We will provide any indicated immediate supportive care, we will recommend that they see a doctor, and they will be discontinued from the study. 
VR headset may be uncomfortable: Some people may find wearing the headset 
uncomfortable.  This risk is small.  We have 2 methods to reduce this risk:  1) we will work with the participant to adjust the headset to be as comfortable as possible. 2) participa nts can stop the VR experience at any time for any reason.  
Contamination:  The VR headset is tightfitting and in close contact [CONTACT_915159].  It is possible that participants may cross contaminate contagious skin or eye disorders.  This risk is small.  We have 2 methods to reduce this risk:  1) We will exclude people  who have active, contagious skin or eye infections.  2) We will use a washable 
face protector for each visit.  Each device will be wiped with antibacterial cleaners after each use.  
Exposure to trigger in a VR experience: VR experiences can seem very real, and a 
participant may be exposed to an item or situation (e.g. heights) that can trigger an adverse reaction.  This risk is small.  We have 2 methods to reduce this risk.  1) There 
will be a variety of VR meditation experiences that participants can choose from so 
participants can pi[INVESTIGATOR_915149]. 2) Participants can halt any VR experience at any time for any reason. 
 
Risk of confidentiality:   
Loss of confidentiality is another risk associated with this study, although this risk will be 
minimized by [CONTACT_2224] a unique study number and password protected and encrypted databases. Data extracted for analysis will also be de- identified and personal  identifiers 
will only be available to study staff.  
EXPECTED  BENEFITS  
Participants have the potential to experience reduced pain symptoms during and after the VR experience. This result is very probable.  Previous experiences suggest that the magnitude of this effect is, on average, large, and that the duration will be during the Virtual Reality experience and possibly up to a few hours or days afterwards.

life.  Pelvic Floor Muscle Exercises, also known as Kegel’s, are the first -line conservative 
treatment for pelvic floor disorders and specifically for urinary incontinence. Studies have 
shown that performing pelvic floor muscle exerci ses and/or pelvic floor physical therapy is 
the most effective non -invasive treatment for urinary incontinence. Pelvic Floor Muscle 
Therapy is advocated as the first -line of treatment for urinary incontinence by [CONTACT_117594], the American Urogynecological Society, the Agency 
for Healthcare Research and Quality.  
 
Pelvic Floor Muscle Exercises was first described by [CONTACT_117595] [ADDRESS_131230] real -time visual verification that the exercises are performed 
correctly and consistently. leva Incontinence SystemTM also meas ures and records the 
results of every session performed while using the device thus assuring patient compliance. 
In the proposed study we aim to clinically show improvement of incontinence symptoms with 
use of leva Incontinence SystemTM for performing Pelv ic Floor Muscle Exercises.  
The association between urinary incontinence and female sexual dysfunction has been 
described in the literature. The relationship is reported by [CONTACT_117596] (2004) however, 
overall there is a paucity of research in this area. W e will evaluate  if women who show 
improvement in incontinence symptoms with the use of the leva Incontinence SystemTM and 
who complete the optional FSFI and PI[INVESTIGATOR_45220] -IR surveys have changes in their responses to the 
survey questions and will then determine if further research is warranted.

May 5 , 2017  8 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
8.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
An open -label  study  in adult women with  urinary incontinence .  
Screening of subjects will occur in one to two visits to determine study  eligibility.  
Up to 25  subjects meeting i nclusion/exclusion criteria at s creening will participate in 6 (up to 
8 weeks) of twice daily training sessions using the leva device . Subjects will be allowed up 
to [ADDRESS_131234].  
Changes  in urinary incontinence will be assessed by [CONTACT_117598],  leva angle 
measurements and patient’s and clinician’s assessment of global improv ement over the 
study period.   
All subjects enrolled in the study will be asked to complete the FSFI and PI[INVESTIGATOR_45220] -IR survey s 
upon enrollment and at study end. Completion of the FSFI  and PI[INVESTIGATOR_45220] -IR is optional, and 
completed surveys will be returned in a sealed envelope and reviewed following study 
completion.  
All subjects who complete this study will be invited to participate in an optional interview with 
the Study Director and a marketing professi onal to better understand their experiences 
using the device. The interview will last up to one hour at the final visit.  
 
8.1.[ADDRESS_131235] about 15 minutes. 
See Study Ev ents Flow Chart ( Section  4).  
For each visit, the subjects will report to the clinic at the time indicated by [CONTACT_117599] (CRU) and r emain confined until completion of the training/testing with the 
female leva Trainer  who is a licensed healthcare professional . 
At the discretion of study staff, a female leva Trainer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_117586] a subject’s 
home for training/testing. There wi ll be no additional charge for an at -home visit.  
There are no overnight stays required for this study. At all times, a subject may be required 
to remain at the CRU for longer at the discretion of the Principal Investigator (PI) . 
8.2 Risks and/or Benefits to Su bjects  
leva Incontinence System TM is an FDA -approved Class II medical device. As such it has 
been tested and found to conform with the requirements of IEC [ZIP_CODE] -1:2005 (3RD Edition), 
Medical Electrical Equipment -Part 1:  General requirements for basic safety and essential 
performance; IEC [ZIP_CODE] -1-2:2007, Medical electrical equipment -Part1 -2:General

sensitization and irritation or intra -cutaneous standards. leva poses little to no risk to the 
patient if used as instructed.  
The risks of use of the leva device are minimal to none however, there may be some 
unknown or infrequen t or unforeseeable risks associated with the use of the device.  The 
potential risks may include embarrassment with use of the intravaginal device; however the 
use of this should not conceptually differ from use of a tampon. Risks of course will be 
monitor ed throughout the entirety of the study.

8.3.3  Removal of Subjects from the Study  
Subjects are free to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason.  
In addition, subjects may be withdrawn from the study by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_117587]:  
• Subject is unable to use the  leva device ; 
• Subject experiences a SAE; 
• Protocol violation.  
The clinical report will include reasons for subject withdrawals . 
8.3.4  Prohibitions and Concomitant Therapy  
There are no prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], activities or medications except as described in the 
exclusion criteria. All medications taken by [CONTACT_117600].  
8.3.5  Meals  
Due to the short duration of confinement for each study per iod, subjects will not be provided  
with a meal.  
8.3.6  Activity  
The subjects will be required to remain standing while performing training and in weekly 
tests using the leva device.  The subjects are allowed to be ambulatory (i.e., no restrictions 
for standing, w alking, sitting, or lying down) at all other times.

8.4.1  Treatment  Administered  
Subjects will train twice daily for 6 (up to 8 weeks) using the leva device. The female leva 
Trainer will assist the subject five days a week with the training session by  [CONTACT_4205][INVESTIGATOR_117588].

when the subject trains at home or when a session is missed the female leva Trainer will be 
able aware of the data and can counsel the subject if no session data is recorded due to a 
missed session.

9.1.1  Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Monitoring  
Subjects will be monitored at each study visit  for adverse events . A specific enquiry will be 
made at the time of each check -in. The subjects will be queried with an open -ended 
question such as “How are you feeling?” or “How have you been feeling since your last 
visit?”  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious Adverse Event  
Any SAE will be reported to the Sponsor and the Institut ional Review Board (IRB) , as 
required . All SAEs will be reported to the Sponsor via fax or e -mail within one working day of 
becoming aware of the event, whether or not the serious events are deemed study 
treatment -related and within 5  working days to the I RB (24 hours of discovery if the event 
involves a death) , as required . 
An SAE is any AE or suspected adverse reaction that in the view of either the PI [INVESTIGATOR_27362], 
results in any of the following outcomes:   Death, a life -threatening adverse event, inpatien t 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant 
incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not res ult in death, be 
life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in  the above definition.  
Life-threatening is defined as an AE or suspected adverse reaction that in the view of the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_27362], its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. It does 
not include an adverse event or suspected adv erse reaction that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death.  
leva device  Page [ADDRESS_131250] No.:  NESCA -Renovia -[ADDRESS_131251](s) and/or examination(s) will  be 
performed to document resolution of event(s). Outcome may be classified as resolved, 
improved, unchanged, worse, fatal, or unknown (lost to follow -up). 
If a SAE occurs to a subject on this study, contact [CONTACT_1034]’s Representative listed in 
Section  2.

At Week 36, End of Treatment (EOT) and exit procedures will be  performed  including the 
NASH activity, defined from change in standardized scoring of liver biopsies at baseline and 
after 36 weeks of treatment will be assessed.  
 
At Week 38, Follow -up procedure will include  review of adverse events, PGI -S (Appendix  
H), PGI-C (Appendix  I) questionnaires, Urinalysis and blood samples for clinical 
laboratory tests including testosterone assay, hormones and related markers (see SOA).

5  INTRODUCTION 
 Study R ationale   
 Nonalcoholic F atty L iver D isease ( NAFLD) and Nonalcoholic S teatohepatitis (NASH)  
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the [LOCATION_002] (US) and its prevalence and clinical importance is in creasing worldwide.
i,ii Recent studies 
estimate that between 30 and 40% of the population in the US, 80- 100 million Americans, is affected by 
[CONTACT_384111].iii,iv,v The number of people at risk for NAFLD is even greater given the increasing prevalence 
of obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a frequently progressive subset of NAFLD that can be complicated by [CONTACT_384112], cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
vi,vii  There are no FDA approved drugs for NASH. 
 Histology, Epi[INVESTIGATOR_384072]-alcoholic fatty liver disease is characterized by [CONTACT_384113], without a history of excessive 
alcohol use, in the absence of other known liver disease.i NAFLD can be broadly classified into two 
subtypes; nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL), which is generally considered to be benign with negligible 
risk of progression to advanced fibrosis and liver -related mortality, and NASH, which is generally 
considered to be progressive with substantial risk of progression to advanced fibrosis, and liver -related 
mortality.viii NAFL and NASH have traditionally been considered two separate clinical entities, rat her 
than two points on a disease continuum.ix Recent studies evaluating sequential liver biopsies are 
challenging this notion.x,xi,xii  Based upon evidence derived from systematic review and meta -analysis of 
paired liver biopsy studies, both patients with NAFL  and NASH may develop progressive liver fibrosis. 
The annual fibrosis progression rate (FPR) in patients with NAFL versus NASH, with baseline stage 0 
fibrosis, was 0.07 stages versus 0.14 stages, respectively, corresponding to an average progression by 1 
stage over 14.3 versus 7.1 years, respectively.xiii Patients with NAFL and mild lobular inflammation, 
without ballooning or fibrosis (and thus not qualifying as NASH), had increased risk of disease progression compared to those without infla mmation. 
xiii Another retrospective study evaluated serial 
liver biopsies in 108 patients and found no significant difference in the proportion of fibrosis progressi on between patients with NAFL and NASH at index biopsy (37%  vs. 43%, p = 0.65).
xi  
Similarly, a recent study analyzing paired liver biopsies over  time showed that even patients with bland 
steatosis can progress to NASH, especially in the setting of metabolic risk factors.xiv 
In the western world, NAFLD is most commonly associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome and diabetes.
xv As with other metabolic conditions, NAFLD appears to have a strong genetic component. 
Both family history of diabetes and Hispanic ethnicity have been identified as risk factors. xv Metabolic 
syndrome, diabetes and advanced age have all been shown to increase the risk of liver disease progression in NAFLD patients.

Protocol LPCN 1144- 18-002 7 January 2020  
 Confidential  Page 23 of 93 It is estimated that NASH occurs in 20% of patients with NAFLD (3 –12% of the US population).xviii, xix  
Approximately 30–40% of patients with NASH will develop fibrosis.xx,xxi,xxii,xiii  Although fibrosis 
regresses in some patients,xxiii, viii,xxiv others progress to advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. viii,
xxvii
xxviiixxv  In fact, 
NASH is the third leading cause of cirrhosis in the US, and the third most common indication for liver 
transplant.xxvi,   In addition to cirrhosis, and the complications that accompa ny it, NASH places 
patients at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).   
 Current Treatment Options  
There are no approved treatment options for NAFLD or NASH. Numerous clinical trials are underway with multiple products in development for the treatment of NAFLD, NASH, NASH fibrosis and NASH cirrhosis.  
 Clinical Trial Rationale  
Numerous literature reports support  a role for T therapy in management and / or treatment of NASH and 
liver cirrhosis.  The current study is planned as a preliminary proof of concept s tudy evaluating efficacy 
and tolerability of oral LPCN [ADDRESS_480609] will be conducted.  
LPCN 1 144, also referred to as “Oral T”, is an oral capsule product containing an ester prodrug of T, 
TU.  Testosterone undecanoate is an esterified T derivative that is orally bioavailable, unlike T which 
undergoes extensive first pass metabolism.  After oral a dministration, TU  is absorbed into systemic 
circulation primarily via the lymphatic system following incorporation into chylomicrons.
1 Once within 
systemic circulation TU  is de -esterified by [CONTACT_384114] T and becomes available to systemic 
target tissues.  Additionally, dihydrotestosterone undecanoate  (DHTU) , formed from TU  and 
transported into systemic circulation via lymphatic absorption, also becomes de -esterified in plasma to 
dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Based on a receptor binding study, TU  and DHTU had negligible binding 
and therefore, TU  and DHTU can be thought of as “inactive transport forms” that provide systemically 
active T and DHT.

A growing body of evidence from  nonclinical and clinical studies reported in the literature support that 
T should be evaluated a potential treatment for NASH and NASH cirrhosis :   
 
Nonclinical studies reported in the literature  
• Two nonclinical studies have investigated the effects of T on the pathogenesis of hepatic 
steatosis in intact and castrated rats fed a high -fat diet.  
o A study by [CONTACT_384115]. showed that T deficiency may contribute to the severity of 
hepatic steatosis, and that T may play a protective role in hepatic steatosis and 
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease development wi thout insulin resistance 
o A study by [CONTACT_384116]. showed that T suppressed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, inhibited the formation of macrovesicular lipid droplets, promoted lipid export, and ameliorated steatohepatitis induced by [CONTACT_384117].  
• A survival study by [CONTACT_384118]. found that rats treated with testosterone enanthate prior to a 90% hepatectomy had a striking difference in post -procedure survival compared to an untreated 
control, with 100% of the untreated control dying before Hour 40, while 80 % of the testosterone enanthate treated rats. survived beyond Hour 40, and of the 80% alive at Hour 40, 50% survived for a normal life span.  Additionally, liver weight was significantly higher in the testosterone enanthate treated  group, as early as [ADDRESS_480613] -hepatectomy.  
 Proof of Concept Liver Fat Evaluation using MRI -PDFF  
 
Study LPCN 1021- 18-001, included an assessment of liver fat via 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging -Proton 
Density Fat Fraction (MRI -PDFF) on a cohort of Oral  T treated hypogonadal male subjects at baseline 
(MRI- 1), at interim (MRI -2: 2 months), and at end of study (MRI -3: 4 months).  The cohort included [ADDRESS_480614] -baseline MRI -PDFF visit.  Of 
these subjects, 62% had non- alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), defined as baseline liver fat of at 
least 5%. The study showed a 5% and 20% decrease in mean percent liver fat from b aseline to MRI -2 
and to MRI -3 respectively  in all subjects, 14% and 33% decrease in mean percent liver fat in subjects 
with MRI -PDFF measurement of >5% at baseline, and 38% and 40% decrease in mean percent liver fat 
in subjects with MRI -PDFF measurements o f >10% at baseline.   
  
Clinical studies in the literature  
• A retrospective observational cross -sectional study by [CONTACT_137219]. found that patient s with serum 
T levels in the lowest quintile had an odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval (CI)) of 5.12 (2.43–10.77) for NAFLD ( P value, 0.0004).

bone mineral density (BMD), body composition and gynecomastia in hypogonadal men with liver cirrhosis found that T replacemen t improves muscle strength, ameliorates gynecomastia, 
alters body fat distribution and causes upper body adiposity in hypogonadal men with cirrhosis. 
• A [ADDRESS_480616] level (NOAEL) was identified 
as 240 mg/kg/day, translating to a dose of about 7,776 mg in an average adult male.  This level is 
approximately 17 times proposed daily human dose in the current study and therefore provides adequate support for a proof of con cept study being proposed.  
The comorbid conditions that are normally seen in the NAFLD/NASH population are consistent with the comorbid conditions of hypogonadism. Clinical evidence summarized in the Investigator  Brochure  
suggest  beneficial trends in liver -related biomarkers at a daily dose of [ADDRESS_480617] s. 
 Receptor Pharmacology  
Testosterone undecanoate is a bio -reversible ester prodrug of testosterone. An androgen receptor 
binding study was conducted to investigate the pharmacological activity of TU  relative to T in the in 
vitro human androgen receptor (AR) binding assay. This study showed that binding of TU  is negligible 
compared to T ( TU inhibitory concentration 50% (IC50) binding affinit y was in the order of 1.0E -04 
lower compared to testosterone) and can be considered to be inactive transport entities for delivery of testosterone.  
 Non-Clinical Toxicology  
Numerous non- clinical studies were conducted in rats, and dogs .  Repeat dose toxicity and toxicology 
studies were conducted at various dos es with the longest studies being 26 weeks in rats and the 
previously reference 90- day toxicology study in dogs, with results described below in greater detail.  
In dogs, doses of up to 1000 mg/ kg were evaluated (equivalent human dose of 35,100 mg, 
approximately 78X human daily dose). The NOAEL for non- reproductive effects was 240 mg/kg/day 
corresponding to 7,776 mg human dose (approximately 17 times proposed human dose). Hepatocellular

periportal acute/subacute inflammation and minimal bile duct hyperplasia with correlating elevations in 
ALT, AST and ALP  at the 1000 mg/kg dose, corresponding to 78X the proposed human daily dose.  
Bile duct hyperplasia was also seen in 1 animal at 240 mg/kg/ day but  was not considered to be adverse 
since the severity was minimal.   
Based on the 90 days dog toxicology study, doses of 450 mg  TU/day in human for a duration of 36 
weeks  is well justified as a starting dose.  
 
 Clinical Safety  
[IP_ADDRESS] Prior H uman Experience - Ex-US 
In the [LOCATION_006], TU  is approved as an intramuscular injection (Nebido: 1000 mg TU  every 10 to 14 weeks) 
and oral (Restandol: 40 mg TU  capsule 3 to 4 times daily) dosage forms.  A post marketing cohort study 
was conducted using the [LOCATION_006] -based General Practice Research Database (GPRD) to explore the risk of 
idiopathic liver disease in association with use of T products. The study provides data on ~8400 patients 
accounting for ~ [ZIP_CODE] patient years of T use over 19 years, of which oral T use accounted for ~ 1800 
patients over 19 years (~1945 person years).  Based on the findings of li ver disease or liver adenoma (or 
liver adenocarcinoma) occurrence in T users, the upper 95 % CI for event rate in users of TU  was 
0.0537 per 10,000 person -days (0 cases in 686,791 person- days) . Based on the findings of rates of 
various adverse outcomes among users of oral T was comparable or lower to other routes that are 
commercially used in the US . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Prior Experience  with LPCN 1144: US Clinical Studies  
Sponsor conducted numerous clinical studies with LPCN 1144 (Oral T) , a total of [ADDRESS_480618] adverse events that occurred were mild or moderate in  severity.  No severe cardiac or hepatic disorders occurred during 
any clinical studies  and n o deaths were reported.  
In the 52 -week clinical study, 210 subjects received LPCN 1144 treatment at a  dose with 300 mg to 600 
mg TU  daily, and 105 received T gel.   In the LPCN 1144 arm, a  total of 16  treatment -emergent serio us 
adverse events ( SAEs ) were reported for 12 LPCN 1144- treated subjects ( 5.7%)  in the clinical  study. 
The SAEs were varied in nature and n one were considered  by [CONTACT_384120] t o study 
drug. 
Overall, k ey laboratory parameters and other biomarkers were mostly within reference ranges and/or 
were consistent with levels observed for other approved T replacement  products. I ncreased hematocrit is 
a known androgenic effect of T  administration and mean increases  observed were minor.   
Liver and renal function tests did not reveal any safety concerns with respect to LPCN 1144, and an 
evaluation of ALT and bilirubin showed no Hy’s law ca ses in the LPCN 1144 clinical database.  
Therefore, drug induced liver injury is not expected with LPCN 1144.

respectively) as compared to the T gel active contro l (4.8% and 1.9%, respectively).   
In summary, the overall  safety results demonstrate that LPCN 1144 ha s an acceptable safety profile.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Prior Experience with Testosterone in Men with NASH and Liver Cirrhosis  
There is a large body of evidence supporting the role of T in NAFLD / NASH / liver cirrhosis. Prior 
clinical studies as discussed have evaluated role of administering T in both hypogonadal and eugonadal men with liver cirrhosis, and / or liver injury, as d iscussed in section 4.2.  
 Inclusion of D-alpha -Tocopher ol Acetate in LPCN 1144 Formulation  
Vitamin E ( d-alpha tocopherol acetate) i s included in one of the LPCN 1144 formulations.  I n previous 
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) trials , d-alpha tocopherol  has been evaluated  as a potential 
treatment.  Sanyal et al. showed that d- alpha tocopherol  therapy (800 mg IU per day), as compared with 
placebo, was associated with a significantly higher rate of improvement in NASH (43% vs. 19%, 
p=0.001).xxix Therefore,  d-alpha -tocopher ol acetate ( at a dose of 800 mg IU day) was included in one of 
the LPCN 1144 formulations  in proof  of concept  LPCN 1144- 18-002 Study to  evaluate if a higher  rate of 
improvement  in NASH  is observed when  LPCN  1144 (Oral T) is used in combination  with  d-alpha 
tocopherol .  The  amount  of d-alpha tocopherol included in the LPCN  [ADDRESS_480619] s will be randomized in 1:1:1 ratio to receive one of the following treatments:  
• Treatment A: Oral LPCN 1144 total daily dose of 450 mg TU administered as BID   
• Treatment B: Oral LPCN 1144 d- alpha tocopherol formulation, total daily dose of 450 mg 
TU administered as BID   
• Treatment C : Oral matching placebo administered as BID   
 
Subject s will undergo a screening period to determine study eligibility. As a part of sc reening, liver 
biopsies will be performed for subject s who have not had a liver biopsy within [ADDRESS_480620] s will be randomized to one of the three treatment arms.  The treatment phase will be for 
a duration of 36- weeks  (without including screening and follow up periods)  with assessments of liver 
biopsies, hepat ic fat fraction, liver enzymes, lipid levels and other safety parameters. Safety and 
tolerability will be assessed throughout the study.  A follow -up visit will be performed to a ssess adverse 
events, complete patient reported questionnaire s including PGI -C (Appendix I ), a urinalysis and to 
obtain blood samples for clinical laboratory tests including, lipid panel, hematology panel, metabolic and renal function panel, hepatic panel, Testosterone, and hormones and related markers.

9 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
 Visit Schedule Overview  
There are four  phases of study:  
• Screening Phase for Subject req uiring testosterone/androgen washout up to 12 weeks  
  (12 weeks following intramuscular androgen injections; 4 weeks following topi[INVESTIGATOR_351128]; 3 weeks following oral androgens).  
• Screening P hase for eligibility assessments (maximum 8 weeks  prior to randomization)  
• Randomization Phase (one visit)  
• Treatment Phase ( eight visits)  
• Follow -up (one visit)  
The visits are described in the following sections.  Note that given that all the procedures note d for a 
visit may not be available at a given clinic, visit procedures may take place over several days, at different sites.

Subjects who are on medications that require washout for eligi bility prior to screening will complete the 
following procedures:  
• Obtain informed consent.  
• Baseline medical history and chart review to determine basic eligibility based on history.  
• Review current and past medication history to determine eligibility or req uire discontinuation. 
 
 Screening V isits and Baseline D ata C ollection  
Investigators will review subject  charts for their eligibility and complete standard of care tests and 
procedures for NASH and invite to undergo screening. All screening related activities will be conducted 
after subject  reads and signs study specific informed consent.  
Screening and baseline data collection procedures will include questionnaires, physical examination, 
determination  of the subject ’s hypogonadal status  based on T  levels below the normal range , 
measurement of serum glucose, routine liver tests, and urine an alysis. Prior therapy for NASH, lipid 
lowering, diabetes , hypertension medication will be reviewed, and subject s will be asked to stop any 
specific or contraindicated / prohibited treatments , if medically acceptable.  Subject s taking diabetic, 
lipid lowering, hypertensive medication will be reviewed and only enrolled if they are on stable 
medication for at least [ADDRESS_480633] s who are currently taking an androgen (wash out period described earlier) or vitamin E  > 100 
IU/day  (at least 4 weeks washout period prior to randomization during screening)  will be washed out.

  Data and Safety  Monitoring Board (DSMB)  
An independent  Data  and Safety  Monitoring Board  (DSMB),  appointed  by [CONTACT_2728], is responsible  for 
monitoring  the accumulated  interim data as the trial progresses  to ensure  subject  safety  and to review  
efficacy.  The DSMB  is a multidisciplinary  group with a written  charge provided by [CONTACT_2728]. The 
DSMB will include three or more members, at least one of whom is a hepatologist.  After  the trial 
commences,  the DSMB  will establish a charter and meet to  review  data, evaluate emerging safety 
information, or other  issues.   
 Interim data on safety  measures  requested  by [CONTACT_384125].  
Serious  adverse events  will be reviewed  by [CONTACT_384126] a teleconference 
discussion if any DSMB  member  so requests.  
 
 Procedure Overview  
 Subject  Questionnaires  
Standardized questionnaires will be administered to subject s participating in the trial at baseline (prior to 
randomization) and during follow -up at specified intervals . The purpose of the questionnaires is to 
obtain important information r egarding alcohol intake  to assess eligibility , functional activity, health-
related quality of life, and Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire (CLDQ)  
LPCN 1144 (Testosterone Undecanoate for NASH)  Version 3.0 
Protocol LPCN 1144- 18-002 7 January 2020  
 Confidential  Page 40 of 93 Alcohol questionnaires : Subject s enrolled in the treatment protocol will complete AUDIT  (Appendix  
D) and Skinner  (Appendix  D) (lifetime drinking history) questionnaires during screening, and AUDIT -
C (Appendix  D) questionnaire at interim follow -up visits . The purpose of these questionnaires is to 
ascertain that there is no significant alcohol consumption at enrollment.  
Functional A ctivity: The NHANES III Activity Questionnaire will be administered  during screening 
and after 36 weeks of treatment . The scores can be converted to METS; then the activity of NASH  
subject s can be compared to U.S. population, and the activity of NASH subject s can be compared to  
other liver disease subject s. (Appendix  E) 
I-PSS:   A questionnaire used for men who are having problems that are likely to be related to an 
enlarged prostate. ( Appendix  F) 
Health -Related Q uality of L ife (HR -QOL) : The SF -36 questionnaire will be administered during 
screening and after 36 weeks of treatment . (Appendix  G) 
Patient G lobal I mpression of S everity (PGI -S) Scale:  The Patient Global Impression of Severity 
(PGI- S) is a global index that may be used to rate the severity of a specific condition (a single -state 
scale).  It is a simple, direct, easy to use scale that is intuitively understandable to clinicians.  (Appendix  
H) 
Patient G lobal I mpression of C hange (PGI -C) Scale: This scale evaluates all aspects of subject s' 
health and assesses if there has been an improvement or decline in clinical status . (Appendix  I) 
Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire (CLDQ) : A questionnaire on liver symptoms developed by [CONTACT_384127] a dministered at screening and after 36 weeks of treatment.  (Appendix  J) 
Sexual D esire and Distress Questionnaire : A questionnaire used to assess level of a subject ’s distress 
due to low sexual desire. (Appendix  K) 
Alcohol questionnaires (AUDIT and Skinner; Appendix D ) and I -PSS questionnaire ( Appendix F ) are 
primarily used for eligibility assessment, therefore they need to be completed during the Screening visits 
(prior to biopsy).  
 Liver MRI -PDFF 
Sites  will schedule  subject s to have their hepatic fat fraction measured via MRI -PDFF at a local  MRI 
facility. A  local MRI facility capable of  performing the  MRI -PDFF test  will be  pre-identified by 
[CONTACT_2728]/CRO  within the geographic location of  the site. Alternatively, if  the site has  a preferred  MRI 
facility, the  site can  use their preferred facility following confirmation by [CONTACT_1034]/CRO.  The MRI -
PDFF details are as follows:  
• MRI -PDFF scan will be conducted at baseline, Week 12, and Week 36. All subject s capable of 
undergoing MRI will be scheduled  to undergo an MRI scan of the liver. In case if a subject is 
unable to undergo MRI -PDFF imaging due to health condition (e.g. claustrophobia, difficulty 
holding breath during the procedure, etc.), the missing MRI -PDFF will be treated as missing 
data, and the subject will be allowed to proceed to randomization or continue the therapy upon investigator and medical monitor approval.  
• Individual subjects should have MRI -PDFF scans performed on the same MRI machine 
throughout screening and the study. 
• A central reader will assess the MRI -PDFF scans to determine the liver fat fraction.  
• All imaging sites will be provided with the 
LPCN 1144- 18-002 Manual to help with the imaging. 
• Further, all imaging sites are qualified to ensure the scan obtained is centrally readable and 
meets the criteria for a valid imaging.

Protocol LPCN 1144- 18-002 7 January 2020  
 Confidential  Page 41 of 93 • MRI -PDFF should be performed prior to randomization but not need to be performed prior to 
biopsy, if one is required.  
 
 Fibroscan (transient elastography)  
For all sc reening and on -treatment Fibroscans, subjects must not eat food and must avoid drinking large 
volumes of water (>  400 mL, 13.5 oz) for at least [ADDRESS_480639]  liver fibrosis and (if available) Controlled Attenuation Parameter (CAP) using 
Fibroscan devices.  The Fibroscan device works by [CONTACT_279595]. A 50- MHz wave is 
passed into the liver from a small transducer on the end of an ultrasound probe. The probe als o has a 
transducer that can measure the velocity of the shear wave (in meters per second) as this wave passes 
through the liver. The shear wave velocity can then be converted into liver stiffness, which is expressed 
in kilopascals.  
 Gait Speed  
Gait speed may be assessed for some subjects at select sites. Standing start, usual pace, over ground gait 
speed was assessed.  Time to complete the 10- meter  walk will be  measured using a stopwatch, and the 
tester will start the time when the participant step  over the starting line and will stop  when the 
participant completely crosses the end line . 
 Hand  Grip Strength Test  
Hand Grip Strength test may be assessed for some subjects at select sites.  
Supplies  
• Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer  
 
Definition and Purpose  
Handgri p strength is a simple and commonly used test of a person’s general strength level.  
 
Measurement  
1. Have subject sit comfortably with the shoulder adducted and neutrally rotated, with the elbow towards/against the body and flexed at [ADDRESS_480640] the hand dynamometer in the participant’s hand, and gently support the base to prevent accidental droppi[INVESTIGATOR_384092]. 
3. Let the participant arrange the instrument so that it fits comfortably in the hand.  Adjust the handle , if necessary , for a comfortable grip.  Make sure that the handle clip is located at the 
lower (furthest) post from the gauge .  If the handle is not in the correct position, results will be 
inaccurate.  
4. Reset the indication needle by [CONTACT_384128].  
5. Request th at the subject squeeze with maximum strength.  The needle will automatically record 
the highest force exerted.  Grip force should be applied smoothly, without rapid wrenching or jerking motion.  Minimal wrist extension (30 degrees or less) is permissible as maximum grip is achieved.  Wr ist extension greater than [ADDRESS_480641] the handgrip strength measurement (in pounds)  for each  
measurement .  Reset the indicator needle before each and every effort.

 Liver Biopsy 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Baseline liver biopsy:   
Subject s who have  not had a liver biopsy within  [ADDRESS_480642]  of care,  the NASH CRN  study physician  should 
check  if tissue  blocks  and/or  additional  slides  can be obtained from  the original  biopsy. If the liver 
biopsy is completed  as part of screening  for this trial, the liver tissue  will be prepared  for light 
microscopy and stains  will include  hematoxylin  and eosin, Masson’s trichrome  and iron stain; 
additionally, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_384093] -[ADDRESS_480643]  has two liver biopsies with 4 months of Screening , and both are of sufficient 
quality, the higher biopsy scoring will be used for baseline.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Follow -up Liver B iopsy:  
A follow -up liver biopsy will be obtained at the Week 36 Visit. Guidelines for obtaining the biopsy 
specimen are provided in the LPCN 1144- 18-002 Liver Biopsy Procedure and NAFLD/NASH 
Histology Scoring System Manual; a 16- gauge  needle is  preferred,  and the specimen should be at least 
1.5 cm in length. The slides should be of adequate size ( preferably 1.5 cm or more) and adequate quality 
for interpretation. The follow -up liver biopsy should be taken from the same lobe of the liver as the 
baseline/historical biopsy. The liver tissue will be  prepared for light microscopy and stains will include 
hematoxylin and eosin, Masson’s  trichrome and iron s tain; additionally, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_384094] - 70 degrees C and set aside for banking.

The following paragraphs discuss the important potential adverse effects and the proposed safeguards to minimize the risks involved.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Issues Related to LPCN 1144 
 LPCN 1144 was extensively studied in non- clinical and  clinical studies. In clinical studies a twice daily 
dose 225 mg of TU  (450 mg total daily dose) was exposed in multiple studies for up to one -year 
duration.  In clinical studies, t he most frequently occurring adverse events in LPCN 1144 treated 
subjects were headache ( 4.0%  of subjects ), upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (3.0% of subjects ), weight

 Safety  Issues Related  to Liver Biopsy  
Subject s will have  up to two liver biopsies  for research  purposes  during their participation  in this 
protocol. About  20% of people  who have  a liver biopsy have  some  degree of pain over the liver that 
may last a few minutes  up to several  hours. This occasionally  requires  pain medication  and usually  
disappears  completely  within  a day or two. A rare complication  of liver biopsy is severe bleeding such 
that a blood transfusion or even  radiological/surgical interventions  are required  to stop the bleeding (less 
than 1 in 1,000). Very  rarely  (less than 1 in 10,000 reported  cases)  death  has occurred  from  bleeding  
after a biopsy. We intend  to minimize  the risks  associated  with liver biopsy (a) by [CONTACT_384131],  (b) by [CONTACT_384132] s with cirrhosis or  subject s with coagulopathy, 
and assuring that subject s do no develop coagulopathy during the course of the trial, (c) by [CONTACT_384133], (d) by [CONTACT_384134] a physician trainee  is performing  the procedure, and (e) by [CONTACT_163297] a 
trans jugular  liver biopsy in morbidly obese  subject s in whom  a percutaneous, mid-axillary  approach  may 
not be feasible.  
 Safety Issues Related to Specimen Repository  
It is anticipated that serum, plasma, DNA, and liver tissue from the participants will be stored for future 
studies related to NASH and  possibly other liver/metabolic diseases. These samples will be stored in a 
central repository.  
 Adverse Events and Serious A dverse E vents  
The investigator will monitor each subject  for clinical and laboratory evidence of AEs on a routine basis 
throughout the study. The investigator will assess and record any AE in detail including the date of onset, event diagnosis (if known) or sign/symptom, severity, time course, duration, outcome, relationship of the AE to study drug, and any action(s) taken. For serious AEs not considered "related" to study drug, the investigator will provide an “Other” cause of the event. For AEs to be considered intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and severity. Adverse events, whether in response to a query, observed by [CONTACT_8786], or reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_88236]. All AEs 
will be followed to a satisfactory resolution.

Protocol LPCN 1144- 18-002 7 January 2020  
 Confidential  Page 47 of 93 
 Definition of Adverse Events (AE)  
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an intervent ion in 
humans, whether or not considered intervention- related (21 CFR 312.32 (a)).  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product. 
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as well as from 
accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal. Any worsening of a pre- existing 
condition or illness is considered an AE. Worsening in severity of a reported AE will be reported as a new AE. Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be AEs only if they result in discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, and/or if the investigator considers them to be AEs. 
 Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
If an AE meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to the Sponsor /PI [INVESTIGATOR_384097] 24 
hours of the site being made aware of the SAE:  
Event  Description of Event  
Death of Subject   An event that results in the death of a subject . 
Life-Threatening  An event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would  have resulted in 
immediate fatality if medical intervention  had not been taken. This does 
not include an event that  would have been fatal if it had occurred in a 
more severe form.  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_384098] 's hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]. This does not include an 
emergency room visit or  admission to an outpatient facility.  
 
Congenital Anomaly  An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that  results in fetal 
loss in the female partner of a study subject . 
 
Persistent or 
Significant  
Disability/Incapacity  An event that results in a condition that substantially  interferes with the 
activities of daily living of a study  subject . Disabi lity is not intended to 
include experiences  of relatively minor medical significance such as 
headache,  nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental  trauma 
(e.g., sprained ankle).  
 
Important Medical 
Event Requiring Medical or Surgical Intervention to Prevent Serious 
Outcome  An important medical event that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but based on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject  and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed a bove (i.e., 
death of subject , life-threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongation of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital anomaly, or persistent or significant

bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment i n an emergency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
For SAEs with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be recorded on the appropriate 
eCRF.  
 Classification of an Adverse E vent 
[IP_ADDRESS] Severity of Event  
For adverse events ( AEs) not included in the protocol defined grading CTCAE system, the following 
guidelines will be used to describe severity.  
• Mild – Events require minimal or no tre atment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily 
activities.   
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt  a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or 
incapacitating.  Of note, the term  “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”.]  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Relationship to Study Intervention  
All adverse events ( AEs) must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_384135]/her clinical 
judgment. The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. In a 
clinical trial, the study product must always be suspect.  
• Related  – The AE is known to occur with the study intervention, there is a reasonable possibility 
that the study interventi on caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study 
intervention and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study intervention and the AE.  
• Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study 
intervention caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study intervention and event onset, or an alternate etiology has been established.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Expectedness  
The investigator will be responsible for determining whether an adverse event ( AE) is expected or 
unexpected.  An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously des cribed for the study intervention. 
 Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow -Up 
All AEs in the subject  and pregnancies that occur in subject ’s partner reported from the time of 
informed consent until completion of the last visit after the last dose of study drug will be collected, whether solicited or spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_423] .

study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study participant presenting for medical care, or 
upon review by a study monitor. 
All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the 
appropriate  case report form  (CRF ). Information to be collected includes event description, time of 
onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_21218] a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  
Any medical condition that is pres ent at the time that the participant is screened will be considered as 
baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event 
at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
Site staff will record all reportable event s with start dates occurring any time after informed consent is 
obtained until the last follow up visit. If the site becomes aware of a related SAE at any time after completion of the study, it must be reported.  Events will be followed for outcome informa tion until 
resolution or stabilization.

 Reporting of Pregnancy  
The study only enrolls male participants who will be required to use adequate contraception throughout 
the duration of the study.  
However, if the subject ’s partner becomes pregnant while the subject  is in the study, it must  be reported

hours.  
10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   
A formal  Statistical Analysis Plan  (SAP) will be completed and incorporated prior to database lock and 
unblinding of the study data. The SAP will govern the statistical analysis for the study. The following 
sections only outlines key statistical points.  
 Outcomes 
Primary Outcome Measure:  
Change in hepatic fat fraction based on MRI -PDFF measurements  in LPCN [ADDRESS_480656] s after 
12 weeks of treatment . 
 Key Secondary  Outcome Measures:  
Change in NASH activity or change in fibrosis.  Changes in NASH activity will be evaluated  via a 
standardized scoring of liver biopsies at bas eline and after [ADDRESS_480657] s, while changes in fibrosis will be evaluated via NASH CRN fibrosis score  of liver biopsies at 
baseline and after 36 weeks of treatment . 
Change in NASH activity is derived  from changes  from  baseline to the end of treatment  in NAS.  The 
NAS  ranges  from  0 to 8 (highest  activity)  and is calculated  as the sum of three
 components  of the 
standardized  histologic  feature scoring system  for liver biopsies:  
NAS   =  Steatosis  score (0-3) + 
Lobular  inflammation  score  (0-3) +  
Hepatocyte ballooning score  (0-2) 
 The analysis of the Key S econdary O utcome M easure will include both improvement in NAS  and 
fibrosis , and numerical change in NAS  and fibrosis .  The analysis for improvement of NAS will only 
include subjects with a baseline hepatocyte ballooning score of 1 or 2. The definition  of improvement  of 
NAS after treatment as the key secondary  outcome  measure requires  the following three conditions:  
• No worsening of the NASH CRN scoring system . 
• Improvement  by [CONTACT_2669] 1 point  in the hepatocyte  ballooning feature  score.  
LPCN 1144 (Testosterone Undecanoate for NASH)  Version 3.0 
Protocol LPCN 1144- 18-002 7 January 2020  
 Confidential  Page 51 of 93 • Either:     
1. Improvement  in NAS  by [ADDRESS_480658]-treatment  NAS  is 3 points  or less. 
Similarly, improvement in fibrosis will be defined as improvement in liver fibrosis greater than or equal 
to one stage using the NASH CRN fibrosis score  with n o worsening of ballooning, inflammation, or 
steatosis.  
 
Other Secondary Outcome Measures:  
• Relati ve change in hepatic fat fraction based on MRI -PDFF measurements in LPCN 1144 treated 
subjects after 12 weeks of treatment.   
• Change in hepatic fat fraction based on MRI -PDFF measurements in LPCN 1144 treated subjects 
after 36 weeks of treatment.   
• Relativ e change in hepatic fat fraction based on MRI -PDFF measurements in LPCN 1144 treated 
subjects after 36 weeks of treatment.   
• NAFDL resolution of subjects who at baseline is at least 5% of hepatic fat fraction with a decrease 
to less than 5% at end of study.  
• Resolution of NASH on overall histopathological reading.  Resolution of NASH is defined as NAS 
score of 0 –1 for inflammation, 0 for ballooning, and any value for steatosis. 
• Change in individual NAS component scores (inflammation, ballooning, steatosis) in LPCN 1144 
treated subjects after 36 weeks of treatment.  
• Resolution of NASH on overall histopathological reading and no worsening of liver fibrosis on 
NASH CRN fibrosis score.  
• Improvement in liver fibrosis greater than or equal to one stage (NASH CRN fibrosis score).  
• Change in anthropometric measurements (weight, body mass index (BMI ), waist  to hip ratio, waist 
circumference, triceps skin fold thickness, upper arm circumference ,) in LPCN [ADDRESS_480659] s. 
• Change in insulin resistance (assessed by [CONTACT_14785])  in LPCN [ADDRESS_480660] s. 
• Changes in liver enzymes ( AST, ALT, A LP, GGT, TB and CK ) in LPCN [ADDRESS_480661] s. 
• Changes in non- invasive markers of fibrosis and steatosis including cytokines, leptin, fibrosis 
markers, and lipid profile  in LPCN [ADDRESS_480662] s. 
• Changes in lipid parameters (triglycerides, VLDL -C, HDL -C, LDL -C, and free fatty acids)  in LPCN 
[ADDRESS_480663] s. 
• Changes in Functional Activity ( Appendix  E), HR -QOL as measured by [CONTACT_41574] -36 (Appendix  
G), PGI -S (Appendix H), PGI -C (Appendix  I), and Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire (CLDQ)  
(Appendix  J) and Sexual desire and distress ( Appendix  K) questionnaires  in LPCN [ADDRESS_480664] s. 
• Changes in laboratory parameters (clinical chemistry, hematology and urinalysis ) in LPCN [ADDRESS_480665] s. 
 
 Sample Size  Determination  
This is a proof of concept  Phase 2 study aimed at evaluating the LPCN 1144 as potenti al therapeutic 
agent in the treatment and / or management of NASH. The sample size for the study was not based on 
any statistical considerations but based on similar Phase 2 studies in this therapeutic area.

 Populations for Analyses 
The study populations that will be used in various analysis are defined as:  
• Intention- to-Treat (ITT) Analysis Dataset (i.e., all randomized participant s) 
• Modified Intention- to-Treat  (mITT)  Analysis Dataset (e.g., participant s who took at least one 
dose of study intervention and/or have some particular amount of on- treatment data)  
• Safety Analysis Dataset: defines the subset of participant s for whom safety analyses will be 
conducted (e.g., participants who took at least one dos e of study intervention ) 
• Per-Protocol  (PP)  Analysis Dataset: defines a subset of the participant s in the full analysis (ITT) 
set who complied with the protocol sufficiently to ensure that these data would be likely to 
represent the effects of study interve ntion according to the underlying scientific model (e.g., 
participant s who took at least 80% of study intervention for 80% of the days within the 
maintenance period) . 
 
 Statistical Analyses  
 General Approach  
A p-value of 0.05 will be considered significant.  N o adjustments  for the additional  analysis or multiple  
comparisons  will be applied ; however, any significant  findings  must  be interpreted  taking into account  
the strength of the finding and its biologic  plausibility.  
Continuous data will be summarized using count, mean, median, standard deviation (SD), minimum, 
and maximum.  For continuous data specified to be analyzed using parametric procedures, non -
parametric procedures will be used if the parametric procedure is felt to be inappropriate.  
Potential treatment- by-site interactions in terms of the baseline data and the primary efficacy and safety 
endpoints will be investigated by [CONTACT_384138]. Visual evidence of extreme 
imbalance by [CONTACT_384139] a term in the model.  
Summary tables, listings, and figures, and statistical analyses will be done using SAS version 9.[ADDRESS_480666], the analysis will begin with the full model. If a potential confounder is not statistically significant in the full model, it will be dropped, and the analysis repeated using a reduced 
model. 
 Procedures for Missing Data  
Missing data will be reported as such. Raw data will be subjected  to a statistical screen for outliers using 
commonly accepted procedures.

 Efficacy Analyses  
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Efficacy Analyses  
The primary outcome measure will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with 
treatment group as a factor and baseline hepatic fat fraction (%) based on MRI -PDFF measurements as a 
covariate. The LPCN 1144 dose groups will be compared to each other and compared to placebo independently using linear contrasts. 
The analysis of the primary outcome measure will be performed using the ITT population. The mITT 
and PP populations will be used as sensitivity analyses.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Key Secondary Efficacy Anal yses 
Change from baseline in key secondary outcome measure s will be analyzed both as a binary outcome  
(improved  vs. not improved)  and also
 in terms  of the numerical  change  in the outcome s.  For the key 
secondary outcome s, improvement will be assessed based  on the criteria provided in section 10.1.  
Comparative analyses  for the key secondary outcome measure w ill be analyzed both as a binary outcome  
(improved  vs. not improved)  and also in terms  of the numerical  change  in the outcome. Binary  outcomes  
will be compared  using Fisher’s exact test . Numerical  changes  will be analyzed  by [CONTACT_384140] -treatment  group differences  in mean  and median  changes;  P-values  will be 
derived  from  Wilcoxon rank sum tests for comparison of the distribution of changes  in each group. If 
concerns  about  confounding arise,  logistic  regression  models  for improvement  outcomes  and linear  
regression  models  for numerical  change  outcomes  will be used to correct  for the confounding. Analyses  
for outcome measures  will generally  involve  three separate analyses,  one for each treatment  group  
comparison .  
[IP_ADDRESS] Other Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
Other secondary efficacy outcome measures will be conducted in the similar methods of the primary and 
secondary efficacy analyses . The details of other secondary efficacy analyses will be provided in the 
SAP.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Subgroup Analyses  
The analyses of the primary o utcome measure will be performed for the following subgroups:  
1. Subjects with baseline liver fat ≥ 5%  
2. Subjects with baseline liver fat ≥ 8%  
3. Subjects with baseline liver fat ≥ 10%  
 
The details of the subgroup analyses will be provided in the SAP. 
 Safety Analyses  
An AE that starts during a unique treatment or that already exists before the start of that unique treatment but worsens during the treatment will be considered as treatment emergent for that unique treatment.  
LPCN 1144 (Testosterone Undecanoate for NASH)  Version 3.[ADDRESS_480667] ing to the following 
rule; if a subject  suffered the same AE more than once, the event will be assigned the worst severity, the 
closest relationship to the study drug, and the earliest onset date.  Only treatment -emergent events will 
be reported.  For each  unique treatment, treatment- emergent AEs will be summarized per primary 
System Organ Class (SOC) and per Preferred Term (PT) using the MedDRA classification system.  All 
AEs, serious AEs and deaths, Serious AEs that are considered treatment -related, and A Es leading to 
premature discontinuation from the study will also be provided in data listings. 
 Cardiovascular  Risk Evaluation 
Each subject  will be evaluated for cardiovascular risk using the following algorithms.  
• Framingham Coronary Heart Disease Risk Scor e. 
• Framingham Risk Score for cardiovascular disease  
• Reynolds Risk Score.  
 A subgroup analysis will be performed showing the central tendency towards increased blood pressure  
in subjects who have a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus at baseline, in subjects who do not have a diagnosis with hypertension and are normotensive at baseline, and in subjects who have a diagnosis of 
hypertension at baseline and are controlled with medical  management.
 
 
 Other A ssessments or Analysis 
Demographics and other baseline characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_53816].  Medical history will 
be summarized.  Major protocol deviations will be listed.  Abnormal physical examination assessments will be summarized for the Safety population. Medication use will be summarized for the Safety 
population.  Prior (prior to the start of treatment) medication use and concomitant (after the start of treatment) medication use will be summarized separately.  If the end date of a prior medication occurs after treatment starts, then the medication will be reported in both the prior and concomitant listings.  Concomitant medication use will be summarized per treatment group.  These listings will present the number and percentage of subject s for each medication.

Within 72 hours, perform a complete history, physical, and liver biochemistries, including:  
New or worsening signs and symptoms of clinical hepatitis such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right 
upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, or eosinophilia.  
Concomitant medications, including acetaminophen, dietary supplements, herbal remedies, over -the-
counter medications, recreational drug use, and special diets:  
• Alcohol consumption 
• Exposure to environmental chemical agents  
• Past medical history  
• Complete review of systems  
• Obtain liver biochemi stries including ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, and INR.   
Evaluate subjects two or three times a week for signs and symptoms of clinical hepatitis and liver 
biochemistries until biochemistries stabilize.  
If biochemistries stabilize and the subject is asymptomatic, monitor liver biochemistries once a week until they return to baseline.  
Subjects who liver far from study sites can be evaluated locally for history, physical exam, and 
laboratories, if the resu lts are communicated promptly to the site investigator.

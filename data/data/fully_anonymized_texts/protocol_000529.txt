patients with lung cancer are not cured and the overall 5 -year survival rate is a 
disappointing 16%. More than 80% of lung cancer patients have non -small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC) and the mainstay of curative treatment for these patients is 
surgical resection, but only 25% to 30% of patients with NSCLC have resectable 
disease (Stage I or II) at diagnosis. Patients with Stage III lung cancer are treated 
with chemoradiotherapy with  curative intent with long term survivals for a 
minority of patients. Survival for localized or locally advanced disease range from 
25-70% at five years depending on stage. For most patients, however, diagnosis is 
made too late for curative therapy. Chemot herapy is the mainstay of palliative 
treatment and produces survivals in the 12 month range for patients with good 
performance status {Scagliotti, 2008 #24}. For small cell lung cancer, surgery is 
not a standard part of treatment for any stage and chemorad iotherapy cures about 
25% of patients with localized cancer and a few of those with more advanced 
extensive stage cancer. In both cases, relapse is frequent and standard treatment 
options are few.  
 
1.11 Palliative treatment (radiation and/or chemotherapy with supportive 
symptom management) is the main option for most patients with stage IV 
NSCLC. Response rates in the 20 -30% range are expected with standard 
chemotherapy. Optimal therapy consists of a platinum doublet for good PS 
patients. Selected patients may benefit from treatment with targeted agents 
such as erlotinib or crizotinib in addition to or instead of  chemotherapy  
{Sandler, 2007 #37}.  
 
1.12 Until recently, it was felt that all commonly used chemotherapy regimens 
were equivalent in efficacy. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
(ECOG) tested four common chemotherapy regimens for Stage IIIB and 
IV NSCLC {Schiller, 2002 #40}. These regimens (2 4-hour 
paclitaxel/cisplatin; 3 -hour paclitaxel/carboplatin; gemcitabine/cisplatin 
and docetaxel/cisplatin) yielded response rates (15 – 21%) and median 
survival rates (7.4 – 8.2 months) that were not statistically different. The 
poor outlook for patients w ith advanced lung cancer despi[INVESTIGATOR_890789] a search for new treatment options. ECOG 
tested carboplatin and paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab and showed 
that addition of the VEGF inhibitor improved overall survival in good  PS 
patients with adenocarcinomas despi[INVESTIGATOR_890790] {Sandler,  2006  
#37}. Patients with squamous cancers were not enrolled due to excess 
bleeding risk discovered in earlier trials. Post hoc subset analysis 
suggested the majority of benefit in males and younger patients. The  
MC1125  6 MCCC Amendment 10 
 
 
subsequent AvAIL trial with cisplatin gemcitabine plus or minus 
bevacizumab produced superior response and survival in the control arm 
than the paclitaxel carboplatin backbone used in E4599 and did not show a 
survival benefit in any subset for addition of bevacizumab to 
chemotherapy {Reck, 2009 #43}. Scagliotti et al studied pemetrexed or 
gemcitabine with cisplatin in good PS patients with previously untreated 
advanced NSCLC. While the regimens were equivalent overall , a small 
but significant survival advan tage was seen for pemetrexed in patients 
with adenocarcinomas and large cell cancers while gemcitabine had a 
similar advantage  in patients with squamous cancers. {Scagliotti,  2008  
#24} Analyses of previous trials with pemetrexed confirms the superior 
outcomes in non -squamous NSCLC {Scagliotti, 2009 #8} Histology must 
now be considered in choice of chemotherapy regimens for patients with 
stage IV NSCLC.  
 
Maintenance:  
Recent studies have shown a small but reproducible survival benefit to 
maintenance or early second line therapy with pemetrexed or erlotinib in 
NSCLC. These two agents have expected benefit primarily for non - 
squamous lung cancers ({Ciuleanu, 2009 #44}, Cappuzzo et al 2009).  
Agents with expected efficacy in squamous cancers are under active 
investigation but no standard maintenance is in common use for patients 
with squamous NSCLC although erlotinib is sometimes prescribed.  
 
Small cell lung cancer:  
Chemotherapy with etoposide and a platinum is standard for both limited 
and extensive stage with addition of radiation to the chest and/or 
prophylactic brain radiation recommended in the appropriate clinical 
circumstances. While topotecan or combination cy clophosphamide, 
doxorubicin and vincristine have been given in the second line setting, 
responses are modest and short lived. There is no standard maintenance or 
third line therapy for small cell patients.  
 
1.2 Protein Kinase C  is a Novel Target  
 
1.21 Protein Kinase C  is an oncogene that can mediate K -ras induced lung 
carcinogenesis. The protein kinase C (PKC) family of serine/threonine 
kinases has been implicated in many forms of cancer, including lung 
cancer, and is therefore a potential therapeutic target for cancer  treatment.  
 
We recently demonstrated that the atypi[INVESTIGATOR_332493] C, PKCι, is an 
oncogene in non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) {Regala, 2005 #50}. 
PKCι is overexpressed in NSCLC and SCLC tumors and tumor PKCι 
expression is predictive of poor clinical outcome inde pendent of tumor 
stage {Regala, 2005 #50 & personal communication, [CONTACT_890866]}. 
The PKCι gene is a target of frequent, tumor -specific alteration by [CONTACT_890836]1125  7 MCCC Amendment 10 
 
 
amplification in a significant subset of NSCLCs {Stallings -Mann, 2006  
#49}. Genetic disruption of PKCι signaling blocks the transformed growth 
of NSCLC cells in vitro and in vivo {Regala, 2005 #51}. Oncogenic PKCι 
signaling requires the N -terminal PB1 domain on PKCι {Stallings -Mann, 
2006 #49}.  
 
Using a high throughput screen, we identified the anti -arthritic gold salt 
aurothiomalate (ATM) and subsequently a similarly acting oral agent, 
Auranofin (Ridaura), as potent inhibitors of oncogenic PKCι signaling. 
ATM and auranofin both inhibit transforme d growth of NSCLC cells by 
[CONTACT_890837]1 domain of PKCι, and blocking the interaction between 
PKCι and downstream adaptor molecules {Erdogan, 2006 #52}.  
 
These agents exhibit potent anti -tumor activity against NSCLC in vitro 
and in vivo. We have demonstrated a correlation between the sensitivity of 
NSCLC cells to the anti -tumor effects of ATM, and the level of expression 
of PKCι. NSCLC cells that express hi gh levels of PKCι are more sensitive 
to ATM than those with relatively low levels of PKCι expression.  A 
phase I clinical trial conducted at our institution demonstrated feasibility 
of the approach. Because of drug shortages, we were unable to obtain 
ATM f or the clinical trial described here. We therefore tested the oral, 
similarly acting agent auranofin in the laboratory. This drug is FDA 
approved for arthritis with the same indications as ATM. In vitro, its 
activity is at least equal to that of ATM at con centrations mirroring those 
found in human serum with standard clinical use. We hypothesize that 
auranofin will be an effective therapy for the treatment of NSCLC, 
especially those subsets of NSCLC exhibiting PKCι  over-expression.  
 
1.22 Gold  compounds  
The use of gold compounds for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 
was pi[INVESTIGATOR_890791] 1929. Gold has also been used in some patients with 
psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis with polyarthritis, and juvenile 
rheumatoid arthritis. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_890792], the mechanism of action of gold 
compounds is poorly defined. The use of gold has declined since [ADDRESS_1247100] are administered only by [CONTACT_80626], however in 
this study an oral drug will be used: auranafin (Ridaura).  
 
 
1.23 Pharmacokinetics of  Gold  
After intramuscular injection, gold salts are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_890793] {Forestier, 1935 #53}. Gold levels 
gradually rise with treatment until a plateau is reached after six to eight  
MC1125  8 MCCC Amendment 10 
 
 
weeks. The serum gold concentration correlates with the dose of gold 
administered; maintenance doses of 50 mg every four weeks result in a 
serum concentration ranging from 75 to 125 μg/dL. Intramuscular gold is 
retained in the body to a greater degree than  oral gold. Approximately 40 
percent of the dose of intramuscular gold is eliminated, either in the urine 
(70 percent) or in the feces (30 percent). As an example, about [ADDRESS_1247101] gold concentrations. Intracellularly, gold attaches to organelle 
membranes in the nuclear, mitochondri al, and lysosomal fractions.  
 
Auranofin is less bioavailable than injectable gold salts with about 15 -25% 
absorbed and with less whole body retention at six months. The serum half -lives 
are similar and the total body half - life or auranofin is about 69 days, while it is 
three times lon ger for injectable ATM. Auranofin is excreted primarily by [CONTACT_890838] {Furst, Dromgoole, 1984}. Oral administration is well tolerated and 
produces serum levels in the effective range based on both arthritis treatment and 
on our preclinical assessments  of PKCiota inhibition.  
 
Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR)  
mTOR is a member of a family of protein kinases called phosphoinositide 
3-kinase (PI3 -K)-related kinases, which is involved in the regulation of 
many intracellular functions such as the control of G1 cell cycle protein 
synthesis. The main upstream regulato r of mTOR is the 
phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI3K) /protein kinase B (Akt) (PI3K/Akt), 
which activates mTOR in response to growth factor stimuli. PI3K seems 
to play a central role in cellular proliferation and is clearly upregulated in 
cancer cells. Pho sphorylation of mTOR, in response to the activation of a 
growth receptor by [CONTACT_890839], leads to the modulation of 2 different 
pathways: the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein -1 (4E -BP1) 
and the 40S ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70s6k) {Sabati ni, 2006 #55}. 
4E-BP1 inhibits the initiation of translation through its binding with eIF - 
4E, the mRNA cap -binding sub -unit of the eukaryotic initiation factor -4 
(eIF-4F) complex. The phosphorylated form of 4E -BP1 induced by  [CONTACT_890840] a lower affinity for eIF-4E, which increases its availability and 
promotes the translation initiation of mRNA 5’ cap in the G1 phase. The 
second downstream target modulated by [CONTACT_890841] p70s6k. The major 
function of this protein is the phosphorylation of 40S ribosomal protein 
S6, which finally leads to the translation of  mRNA.

1.24 Sirolimus  
Rapamycin is a macrolide fungicide isolated from the bacteria 
Streptomyces hygroscopi[INVESTIGATOR_890794] a potent antimicrobial, 
immunosuppressant and anti -tumor agent {Huang, 2003 #81}. After 
binding intracellularly the immunophilin FK506 binding protein 12 
(FKBP1 2), rapamycin is capable of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_890795] {Rao, 2004 #78}. This antiproliferative activity has been 
confirmed in preclinical experiments. mTOR inhibition has enh anced the 
efficacy of chemotherapy and radiation in preclinical models and early 
clinical trials in a variety of solid malignancies including NSCLC 
(reviewed in Pal S, et al Clinical Lung Cancer, Vol. 9, No. 6, 340 -345, 
2008) . 
 
Clinical trials of oral and IV inhibitors of mTOR have suggested an 
efficacy signal in lung cancers but have been disappointing as single 
agents with response endpoints. Their effects on relevant molecular 
pathways are clear from preclinical and animal mod els and their efficacy 
is likely to be more apparent to maintain responses initiated by [CONTACT_890842]. A phase I study of everolimus suggested 
activity with disease stabilization in four of 14 heavily pretreated NSCLC 
pts treated  with RAD001 {O’Donnell, 2003 #85}. A phase II study 
presented at ASCO in [ADDRESS_1247102] line settings with thi s 
agent {Soria, 2009 #86}. Most studies show stabilization of disease with 
mTOR inhibitors rather than measurable response, hence our interest in 
utilizing the drugs in studies in the maintenance or early second line 
setting as discussed below.  
 
Sirolimus, a structural analog of rapamycin, is converted in vivo to 
rapamycin and has antiproliferative effects in cell culture and animal 
models as well as having antitumor effects in several solid tumors 
including NSCLC. Some data suggest that sirolimus may reduce the risk 
of cancer in renal transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Additionally, phase I studies of the 
drug in cancer patien ts have not shown significant  immunosuppression.  
Sirolimus eluting stents have been used to reduce endothelial proliferation 
contributing to restenosis after angioplasty. Sirolimus has been combined 
safely with chemotherapy and radiation in a phase I trial in NSCLC 
patients with no evidence of immunosuppressive effects and with serum 
levels compatible with mTOR pathway inhibition ( Sarkaria J et al, JTO 
2:751 -7, 2007 ). 
 
Sirolimus is FDA approved for organ transplants to mediate rejection.  
MC1125  10 MCCC Amendment 10 
 
 
1.25 Rationale for the Clinical Trial  
 
PKC  is required for cellular transformation mediated by [CONTACT_890843], 
which is expressed in approximately 40% of all NSCLC, and up to 70% of 
NSCLC in smokers. PKCι is overexpressed in NSCLC and tumor PKC  
expression is predictive of poor clinical outcome independent of tumor 
stage. The PKC  gene is a target of frequent, tumor -specific alteration by 
[CONTACT_890844] a significant subset of NSCLCs {Regala, 2009 #45}. 
Genetic disruption of PKC  signaling blocks the transformed growth of 
NSCLC cells in v itro and in vivo {Stallings -Mann, 2006 #49}. Gold salts 
are potent inhibitors of oncogenic PKC  signaling inhibiting transformed 
growth of NSCLC cells by [CONTACT_890837]1 domain of PKC , and 
blocking the interaction between PKC  and downstream adaptor 
molecules {Regala, 2008 #46} {Erdogan, 2006 #52}. We have 
demonstrated a correlation between the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to the 
anti-tumor effects of ATM and auranofin and the level of expression of 
PKC . We hypothesize that auranofin will be an effective  therapy for the 
treatment of NSCLC, especially those exhibiting elevated PKC  
expression by [CONTACT_890845]ι gene amplification. We conducted a phase I 
trial of ATM in patients with advanced NSCLC and ovarian and 
pancreatic cancers, both of which also express high PKC  levels. The 
results of this trial demonstrated the safety of ATM and established a 
phase II dose of [ADDRESS_1247103]  chemotherapy:  
We were unable to obtain ATM for this study due to drug shortages. We 
have replicated the most important background data with ATM referenced 
above with auranofin in the laboratory and have demonstrated that 
auranofin shows highly synergistic anti -tumor activity with the mTOR 
inhibitor rapamycin in pre -clinical NSCLC models in vitro and in vivo as 
described in the translational research background below. S irolimus is 
converted to rapamycin in vivo and is used clinically in transplant patients 
to manage organ rejection with overall good tolerance. Based on these 
data, we are pursuing a phase I/II trial to assess the efficacy of combined 
chemotherapy using au ranofin and the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus in  
MC1125  [ADDRESS_1247104] chemotherapy.  
 
Brief summary of scientific rationale:  
 
 Molecular targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_890796] 
5 years. Bevacizumab, an anti -angiogenesis monoclonal antibody that 
targets VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), is  approved in 
combination with front -line therapy using paclitaxel and carboplatin in 
patients with non -squamous NSCLC, based on results of E4599 
(Sandler et al 2006). Inhibition of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_890797] (Cappuzzo et al ASCO 2009  Abs).  
 More recently, the combination of pemetrexed with a platinum agent 
as first -line treatment for NSCLC has been compared with 
gemcitabine in combination with a platinum agent (Scagliotti et al 
2008). Pre -planned subset analysis in the phase III study reporte d by 
[CONTACT_890846]. suggested better survival with pemetrexed combination 
in patients with adenocarcinoma and in large cell histology and with 
gemcitabine for squamous  NSCLC.  
 Currently, there exists an apparent preponderance of novel agents that 
seem to provide benefit favoring the non -squamous subset of  NSCLC.  
 Patients with Ras mutated non -squamous NSCLC have worse 
prognosis and respond less well to chemotherapy than those with wild 
type Ras and present treatment challenges as a  result.  
• Patients with Ras mutated non -squamous NSCLC frequently exhibit  
PKC  gene and protein  overexpression.  
 Patients with squamous histology and Ras mutated adenocarcinoma 
comprise approximately 40 -45% of NSCLC in the [LOCATION_002] and 
have similar treatment outcomes. While to this date there are no novel 
therapeutic combinations that clearly demonstrate improved outcomes 
over existing standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_890798], emerging 
data suggest potential target ed therapeutic options that merit further 
investigation.  
• PKC  is of particular relevance in squamous NSCLC as it is expressed 
strongly in this population. Auranofin inhibits PKC  activity and slows 
the growth of squamous NSCLC in vitro and in vivo in animal  models.  
 Preclinical results with Ras mutant non -squamous NSCLC and small 
cell lung cancer (SCLC) are similar to those for the squamous NSCLC 
cells.  
 Small cell lung cancer responds to first line therapy most of the time 
but relapses quickly and responds poorly to second line  treatment.  
MC1125  12 MCCC Amendment 10 
 
 
 
• Small cell lung cancer overexpresses PKC  and in the laboratory 
responds to auranofin with PKC  inhibition and antiproliferative 
effects.  
• Synergy between inhibition of the PKC  and mTOR pathways has 
been shown in recent laboratory studies in our and other laboratories.  
 A phase I clinical trial has demonstrated the safety of PKCiota 
inhibition with gold salts (ATM) in patients with pretreated advanced 
NSCLC.  
 A phase II study of mTOR inhibition in the second and third line 
setting in non -selected NSCLC showed a suggestion of activity, 
primarily stabilization of  disease.  
 
Based on the above, we wish to test the hypothesis that the 
auranofin/sirolimus combination will be effective and well -tolerated in 
patients with NSCLC of squamous histology, Ras mutated lung cancer and 
relapsed small cell lung cancer with no standard trea tment options.  
 
1.3 Translational Research  
 
1.31 Background:  
 
We have demonstrated that the atypi[INVESTIGATOR_890799] (PKC ) is an oncogene in 
lung cancer (Regala et al. , 2005a; Regala et al. , 2005b). PKC  is 
overexpressed in a majority of non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 
small cell lung cancer (SCLC) tumors. PKC  expression is driven in a 
significant subset of NSCLC tumors as a result of tumor -specific 
amplification of the PKC  gene, which is part of the 3q26 amplicon. PKC  
gene amplification is most prominent in lung squamous cell carcinoma 
(LSCC) tumors, where it is prese nt in ~70% of tumors (Regala et al. , 
2005b). Functionally, PKC  is required for NSCLC cell transformed 
growth and invasion in vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo (Regala et al. , 
2005a). PKC  drives transformed growth through activation of a PKC - 
Rac1 -Pak-Mek-Erk proliferative signaling pathway. PKC  activates this 
pathway by [CONTACT_890847]6, 
which serves to couple PKC  to Rac1 (Frederick et al. , 2008). The PKC - 
Par6 complex is required for oncogenic PKC  signaling. Using a high 
throughput screen, we identified ATM and other gold salts such as 
auranofin as a potent and selective small molecule inhibitors of the PKC - 
Par6 interaction (Stallings -Mann et al. , 2006). ATM inhibits the PKC - 
Par6 interaction in a dose dependent fashion, and exhibits potent anti - 
tumor activity against NSCLC cell proliferation in vitro and 
tumorigenicity in vivo (Erdogan et al. , 2006; Stallings -Mann et al. , 2006). 
Biochemical studies have demonstrated that the mechanism of action for 
the ant i-tumor activity of ATM is to bind to a specific region of PKC  
MC1125  13 MCCC Amendment 10 
 
causing disruption of Par6 binding to PKC  (Erdogan et al. , 2006). ATM 
is currently unavailable due to drug shortages in the [LOCATION_002].  
Auranofin (Ridaura) is FDA -approved for the treatment of rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA). A phase I dose escalation study of ATM in advanced 
NSCLC has established a well -tolerated dosing regimen for ATM in the 
treatment of NSCLC patients. Auranafin also shows hi ghly synergistic 
anti-tumor activity with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin in pre -clinical 
NSCLC models.  
 
Auranofin is an FDA -approved anti -rheumatoid drug in the same  
chemical class as aurothiomalate (ATM) and aurothioglucose  
 
The original protocol proposed a phase I/II clinical trial of aurothiomalate 
(ATM) in combination with mTOR inhibitor rapamycin in the 
maintenance therapy of advanced lung cancer patients. Recent drug 
shortages of ATM have prompted us to assess the efficac y of auranofin, 
another gold compound in the same chemical class as ATM as a substitute 
for the proposed clinical trial. Auranofin (Ridaura) is FDA -approved for 
treatment of RA and has been in clinical testing for treatment of acute 
lymphocytic leukemia. T he drug has not been a subject of drug shortages 
and is accessible for the trial. Figure 1 shows the chemical structure of the 
gold compounds ATM, ATG and auranofin. Note that all compounds 
belong to the same chemical class with the active pharmacophore being a 
gold thiolate moiety ( Figure  1).

Figure 1: Structures of the major anti -rheumatoid gold compounds in 
clinical use . Note the presence of the same gold thiolate pharmacophore 
in each  compound.  
 
In order to determine whether, like ATM, auranofin exhibits anti -tumor 
activity against NSCLC cell growth, we conducted a dose response 
experiment to assess the effect of auranofin on the growth of H1703 lung 
squamous cell carcinoma cell growth. As can be seen, auranofin exhibits 
good dose -dependent inhibition of the transformed growth of these cells 
with an apparent IC50 of ~0.3 < M ( Figure 2 ). This IC50 is actually better 
than that of ATM against this cell line (~ 1< M). Therefore, these data 
indicate tha t auranofin is a suitable substitute for ATM in the proposed 
clinical trial.

We also demonstrated that ATM exhibits synergistic anti -tumor activity in 
vitro (Figure 3A) and in vivo (Figure 3B) when combined with the mTOR 
inhibitor rapamycin. Auranofin exhibits similar synergy when combined 
with rapamycin, indicating that these agen ts act similarly (Figure 3C).  
Based on these data and on existing safety data sirolimus and other mTOR 
inhibitors in human use, we propose this phase II trial to assess the 
efficacy of combined therapy with auranofin and the sirolimus in 
advanced stage NSCLC patients in the adjuvant se tting.

Associated Laboratory Studies:  
 
Genetic and Molecular Markers of ATM Sensitivity:  
 
Our recent studies have demonstrated that the level of PKC
  expression 
in NSCLC tumor cells correlates with response to the anti -tumor effects of 
ATM in vitro and in vivo (Regala et al. , 2008). Furthermore, we 
demonstrated that tumor -specific PKC
  gene amplification is a major 
mechanism driving PKC
  expression in primary tumors (Regala et al. , 
2005b). These preclinical data suggest that assessment of PKC
  
expression and PKC
  gene amplification in a patient’s tumor may be 
predictive of response to ATM or auranofin therapy. Therefore, we wish to 
assess whether there is a similar correlation between tumor PKC
  
expression and auranofin response clinically. For this purpose, we propose 
to obtain pre - treatment biopsies of patients’ tumors prior to enrollment on 
the clinical trial. These biopsy samples will be used to extract genomic 
DNA for analysis of PKC
  gene copy number (PKC
  gene 
amplification) which is a major mechanism driving the overexpression of 
PKC
  in NSCLC tumors, and for immunohistochemical analysis of tumor 
tissue for elevated PKC
  protein expression within the tumor. In addition, 
we propose to assess whether levels of markers of PKC
  and mTOR 
signaling activity correlate with subsequent response. The techniques for 
this analysis are well established in our laboratory.

found in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) version 4.[ADDRESS_1247130] access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0. A copy  of the 
CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/forms/default.htm ). 
 
10.[ADDRESS_1247131], identify and grade the severity of the event using 
the CTCAE v4.0. Next, determine whether the event is expected or 
unexpected (refer to Sections 10.12 and 15.0) and if the adverse event 
is related to the medical treatment or procedure (see Section 10.13). 
With this information, determine whether an adverse event should be 
reported to the NCI as an expedited report (see Section 10.2) or as part 
of the routinely reporte d clinical data.  Important : All AEs reported  via 
  
 
 
expedited mechanisms must also be reported via the routine data 
reporting mechanisms defined by [CONTACT_760] (see Section 10.3 and 
18.0).  
 
Expedited and/or routine reports are to be completed within the 
timeframes and via the mechanisms specified in Sections 10.[ADDRESS_1247132] (IRB) according to local IRB’s policies and procedures.  
 
10.12  Expected vs. Unexpected  
• The determination of whether an AE is expected is based on agent - 
specific adverse event information provided in Section 15.0 of the 
protocol.  
• Unexpected AEs are those not listed in the agent -specific adverse 
event information provided in Section 15.0 of the  protocol.  
 
10.13  Assessment of  Attribution  
 
When assessing whether an adverse event is related to a medical 
treatment or procedure, the following attribution categories are utilized:  
 
Definite - The adverse event is clearly related to the investigational agent(s).  
Probable - The adverse event is likely related to the investigational 
agent(s).  
Possible - The adverse event may be related to the investigational 
agent(s).  
Unlikely - The adverse event is doubtfully related to the investigational 
agent(s).  
Unrelated - The adverse event is clearly NOT related to the investigational 
agent(s)

11.[ADDRESS_1247134]  Guideline  
 
NOTE: This study uses protocol RECIST v1.1 template dated 2/16/2011. See the 
footnote for the table regarding measureable disease in Section 11.44, as it pertains to 
data collection and analysis.  
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international 
criteria proposed by [CONTACT_459] (RECIST) 
guidelines (version 1.1) Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement ) 
of the tumor lesions and the short axis measurements in the case of lymph nodes are used 
in the RECIST guideline . 
 
11.1 Schedule of Evaluations: For the purposes of this study, patients should be 
reevaluated every [ADDRESS_1247135] x -ray, or as ≥1.[ADDRESS_1247136] component of a PET/CT, or  MRI.  
Tumor lesions in a previously irradiated area are considered 
measurable disease under the following conditions:  
a. The radiation completion date is ≥ [ADDRESS_1247137] diameter 
is ≥ 1.0 cm in diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g. skin 
nodules) or imaging. In the case of skin lesions, documentation by 
[CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the 
lesion, is  recommended.  
  
 
 
 
11.213  A malignant lymph node is considered measurable if its short axis 
is >1.[ADDRESS_1247138] scan (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be no greater than 5  mm).  
 
11.214  Clinical Lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered 
measurable when they are superficial (e.g. skin nodules and 
palpable lymph nodes) and >1.0 cm diameter as assessed using 
calipers (e.g. skin nodules). In the case of skin lesions, 
documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate 
the size of the lesion, is  recommended.  
 
11.22  Non-Measurable Disease  
 
11.221 All other lesions (or sites of disease) are considered non -measurable 
disease, including pathological nodes (those with a short axis ≥1.0 
to <1.5 cm). Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/p ulmonis, 
inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed 
by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non -measurable as  well.  
 
Note: ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be 
considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of 
measurability described above. However, if non -cystic lesions are present 
in the same patient, these are preferred for sel ection as target lesions. In 
addition, lymph nodes that have a short axis <1.0 cm are considered non - 
pathological (i.e., normal) and should not be recorded or followed.  
 
11.3 Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 
11.31  Measurement  Methods:  
 
 All measurements should be recorded in metric notation (i.e., decimal 
fractions of centimeters) using a ruler or  calipers.  
 
 The same method of assessment and the same technique must be used 
to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and 
during follow -up. For patients having only lesions measuring at least [ADDRESS_1247139] of a  treatment.  
  
 
 
 
11.32  Acceptable Modalities for Measurable Disease:  
 
 Conventional CT and MRI:  This guideline has defined measurability 
of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness 
is [ADDRESS_1247140]: If the site can document that the CT performed as part of a 
PET-CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV 
and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for 
RECIST measurements and can be used interchangea bly with 
conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over  time.  
 
 Physical Examination: For superficial non -nodal lesions, physical 
examination is acceptable, but imaging is preferable, if both can be 
done. In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], 
including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesi on, is  recommended.  
 
 FDG -PET: FDG -PET scanning is allowed to complement CT scanning 
in assessment of progressive disease [PD] and particularly possible 
'new' disease. A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scanned lesion is defined as one 
which is FDG avid with an update greater than twice that  of the 
surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image; otherwise, an 
FDG -PET scanned lesion is considered ‘negative.’ New lesions on the 
basis of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the following 
algorithm:  
 
a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline with a positive FDG -PET at follow - 
up is a sign of PD based on a new lesion.  
 
b. No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at  follow -up: 
 
i. If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site 
of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is  PD. 
  
 
 
ii. If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new 
site of disease on CT at the same evaluation, additional follow - 
up CT scans (i.e., additional follow -up scans at least 4 weeks 
later) are needed to determine if there is truly progression 
occurring at that site. In this situation, the date of PD will be the 
date of the initial abnormal PD G-PET scan.  
 
iii If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre - 
existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the 
basis of the anatomic images, it is not classified as PD.  
 
11.33  Measurement at Follow -up Evaluation:  
 
 In the case of stable disease (SD), follow -up measurements must have 
met the SD criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval 
of 8 weeks (see Section  11.44).  
 
 The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion 
that appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor 
has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to 
differentiate between response or stable disease (an ef fusion may be a 
side effect of the treatment) and progressive  disease.  
 
 Cytologic and histologic techniques can be used to differentiate 
between PR and CR in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types 
such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can 
remain.)  
 
 
11.[ADDRESS_1247141]  
 
11.41  Target Lesions & Target Lymph  Nodes  
 
 All measurable lesions (as defined in Section 11.21 -11.22) up to a 
maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, representative of 
all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded 
and measured at baseline. If the protocol speci fied studies are 
performed, and there are fewer than 5 lesions identified (as there often 
will be), there is no reason to perform additional studies beyond those 
specified in the protocol to discover new lesions.  
  
 
 
 
 Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with 
the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in 
addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated 
measurements. It may be the case that,  on occasion, the largest lesion 
does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance 
the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be 
selected.  
 
Baseline Sum of Diameters (BSD): A sum of the diameters [longest 
for non -nodal target lesions (see Section 11.211), short axis for target 
lymph nodes see Section 11.212)] for all target lesions will be 
calculated and reported as the baseline sum of diamete rs. The BSD 
will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor 
response in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
 
 Post-Baseline Sum of the Diameters (PBSD): A sum of the diameters 
[longest for non -nodal target lesions (see Section 11.211), short axis for 
target lymph noted (see Section 11.212)] for all target lesions will be 
calculated and reported as the post -baseline sum of diameters. If the 
radiologist is able to provide an actual measure for the target lesion, that 
should be recorded, even if it is below 0.[ADDRESS_1247142] that the lesion has likely disappeared, the measurement 
should be recorded as 0  cm. 
 
 The minimum sum of the diameters (MSD) is the minimum of  the 
BSD and the  PBSD.  
 
11.42  Non-Target Lesions & Non -Target Lymph  Nodes  
 
Non-measurable sites of disease (Section 11.22) are classified as non - 
target lesions or non -target lymph nodes and should also be recorded at 
baseline. These lesions and lymph nodes should be followed in accord 
with 11.433.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_1247143]/MRI/PET -CT/physical examination must be measured on re - 
evaluation at evaluation times specified in Section 11.1. 
Specifically, a change in objective status to either a PR or CR 
cannot be done  without re -measuring target lesions and target 
lymph nodes.  
  
 
 
Note: Non-target lesions and non -target lymph nodes should be 
evaluated at each assessment, especially in the case of first 
response or confirmation of response. In selected circumstances, 
certain non -target organs may be evaluated less frequently. For 
example, bone scans may need to be repeated only when complete 
response is identified in target  disease or when progression in bone 
is suspected.  
 
11.432 Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
• Complete Response (CR):   All of the following must be  true: 
 
a. Disappearance of all target lesions.  
 
b. Each target lymph node must have 
reduction in short axis to <1.0  cm. 
 
• Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in PBSD (sum  
of the longest diameter for all target 
lesions plus the sum of the short axis 
of all the target lymph nodes at current 
evaluation) taking as reference the 
BSD ( see Section 11.41).  
 
• Progression (PD):  At least one of the following must  be 
true: 
 
a. At least one new malignant lesion, 
which also includes any lymph 
node that was normal at baseline  (< 
1.0 cm short axis) and increased to  
≥ 1.[ADDRESS_1247144] a 20% increase in PBSD 
(sum of the longest diameter for all 
target lesions plus the sum of the 
short axis of all the target lymph 
nodes at current evaluation) taking 
as reference the MSD (Section 
11.41).  In addition, the PBSD 
must also demonstrate an absolute 
increase of at least 0.5 cm from the 
MSD.  
  
 
 
c. See Section 11.32 for details in 
regards to the requirements for PD 
via FDG -PET imaging.  
 
• Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to  qualify  
for PR, nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD taking as reference the 
MSD.  
 
11.433 Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions & Non -target Lymph Nodes  
 
• Complete Response (CR):  All of the following must be  true: 
 
a. Disappearance of all non -target 
lesions.  
 
b. Each non -target lymph node must 
have a reduction in short axis to  
<1.0 cm.  
 
• Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more  non-target  
lesions or non -target lymph nodes.  
 
• Progression (PD):  At least one of the following must  be 
true: 
 
a. At least one new malignant 
lesion, which also includes  
any lymph node  that was normal 
at baseline (< 1.0 cm  short axis) and 
increased to ≥ 1.0 cm short axis 
during   follow -up. 
 
b. Unequivocal progression of 
existing non -target lesions and 
non-target lymph nodes. (NOTE: 
Unequivocal progression should 
not normally trump target lesion 
and target lymph node status. It 
must be representative of overall 
disease status change.)  
 
c. See Section 11.32 for details in 
regards to the requirements for PD 
via FDG -PET imaging.  
  
 
 
11.44  Overall Objective Status

11.45  Symptomatic Deterioration: Patients with global deterioration of health 
status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of 
disease progression at that time, and not either related to study treatment 
or other medical conditions, should be reported as PD due to 
“symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document 
the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment due to 
symptomatic deterioration. A patient is classified as having PD due to 
“symptomatic deterioration” if any of the following occur that are not 
either related  to study treatment or other medical  conditions:  
 Weight loss >10% of body  weight.  
 Worsening of tumor -related  symptoms.  
 Decline in performance status of >1 level on ECOG  scale.  
 
12.0 Descriptive Factors  
 
12.1 Brain metastasis at on -study:  Yes vs.  no. 
 
12.2 Prior palliative radiation:  Yes vs. no.  
 
12.3 Phase I dose level:  0 vs. 1  
 
13.0 Treatment/Follow –up Decision at Evaluation of  Patient  
 
13.1 Patients who are CR, PR, or SD will continue treatment per  protocol.  
 
13.2 Patients who develop PD while receiving therapy will go to the event -monitoring 
phase.  
 
13.3 Patients who go off protocol treatment for reasons other than PD will go to the 
event -monitoring phase per Section  18.0.  
  
 
 
 
13.4 Patients who develop PD in the CNS only should receive resection and/or brain 
radiation and continue treatment on study after completion of CNS treatment . 
 
13.5 Patients who develop non -CNS PD at any time should go to event monitoring. 
These patients should be treated with alternative chemotherapy if their clinical 
status is good enough to allow further therapy.  
 
13.6 A patient is deemed ineligible if after registration, it is determined that at the 
time of registration, the patient did not satisfy each and every eligibility criteria 
for study entry. The patient may continue treatment off -protocol at the discretion 
of the physician as long as there are no safety concerns, and the patient was 
properly registered. The patient will go directly to the event -monitoring phase of 
the study (or off study, if applicable).  
• If the patient received treatment, all data up until the point of confirmation of 
ineligibility must be submitted.  Event monitoring will be required per  
Section  
18.0 of the protocol.  
• If the patient never received treatment, on -study material must be 
submitted. Event monitoring will be required per Section 18.[ADDRESS_1247146] be submitted. The patien t will go directly to the event - 
monitoring phase of the study. The patient may continue treatment off -protocol at 
the discretion of the physician as long as there are no safety concerns, and the 
patient was properly registered.  Event monitoring will be r equired per  Section  
18.0 of the protocol.  
 
13. 8  A patient is deemed a cancel if he/she is removed from the study for  any 
reason before any study treatment is given. On -study material and the End of 
Active Treatment/Cancel Notification Form must be submitted. No further 
data submission is  necessary.  
 
 
14.0 Body Fluid Biospecimens:  None  
 
 
15.0 Drug  Information  
 
15.1 Auranofin for Oral Administration (Ridaura®)  
 
15.11  Background : Auranofin is a gold compound which has anti -
inflammatory effects. Gold compounds can alter the immune response 
and have been shown to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis.  
 
15.12  Formulation : Commercially available for oral administration 
as: Capsules: 3 mg [gold  29%]  
  
 
15.13  Preparation, storage, and stability : Refer to package insert for 
complete preparation and dispensing instructions. Store oral 
tablets at room temperature. Dispense in a tight, light -resistant  
container.  
 
15.14  Administration: Refer to the treatment section for specific 
administration  instructions.  
 
15.15  Pharmacokinetic  information : 
Absorption: ~25% of the gold in a dose of Auranofin is absorbed 
from the gastrointestinal tract  
Protein binding: Moderate. In blood, approximately 60% of the 
gold is bound to plasma proteins; the remainder is present in red 
blood cells  
Metabolism: Rapi[INVESTIGATOR_78081] (the intact molecule has not been 
detected in blood)  
 
Half -life elimination: Blood: 21 – 31 days. Tissue: 42 -128 days 
Excretion : 60% of the absorbed gold (15% of the administered 
dose) is excreted in the urine; the remainder of the dose is excreted 
in the feces  
 
15.16  Potential Drug Interactions : 
In a single patient -report, there is the suggestion that concurrent 
administration of Auranofin and phenytoin may have increased 
phenytoin blood levels.  
 
15.17  Known potential adverse events: Consult the package insert for 
the most current and complete information. Auranofin is 
contraindicated in patients with a history of any gold -induced 
disorders: anaphylactic reactions, necrotizing enterocolitis, 
pulmonary fibrosis, exfoliative dermatitis, bone marrow aplasia 
or other severe hematologic  disorders.  
 
Common known potential toxicities, > 10% : 
Dermatologic: Dermatitis (aggravated by [CONTACT_225342]), pruritus, actinic 
rash, hair loss, urticaria  
Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, 
loose stools, constipation, dysgeusia, stomatitis, glossitis 
Hematologic: Anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, Eosinophilia 
Hepatic: Elevated liver enzymes

15.18  Drug procurement:  
Commercial supplies. Pharmacies or clinics shall obtain 
supplies from normal commercial supply chain or wholesaler.  
 
15.19  Nursing Guidelines:  
15.191  Auranofin is contraindicated in patients with history of gold - 
induced disorders (see section 15.17). Assess patients for any 
of these conditions, hold drug and notify study  team.  
15.[ADDRESS_1247147] 
patients to avoid prolonged sun exposure without protection 
(i.e sunscreen SPF 30+ and covering up with clothing).  
15.193  Patients may experience hair loss. Warn patients of this  possibility.  
15.194  Gastrointestinal side effects are common (diarrhea, 
constipation, nausea, vomiting, etc.) Treat symptomatically and 
assess for effectiveness.  
15.195  Monitor LFT’s as elevated liver enzymes have been seen. 
Report elevations to study physician.  
 
15.196  Cytopenias can be seen. Rarely these can be serious. Monitor 
CBC w/differential. Instruct patients to report any excessive 
bruising or bleeding and/or signs/symptoms of infection to study  
team.  
 
15.[ADDRESS_1247148] patients to report any cough, shortness of 
breath, and/or chest pain to the study team  immediately.  
 
 
15.2 Sirolimus for Oral Administration (Rapamune®)  
 
15.21  Background : Sirolimus inhibits T -lymphocyte activation and proliferation in 
response to antigenic and cytokine stimulation and inhibits antibody production. 
Its mechanism differs from other immunosuppressants. Sirolimus binds to  FKBP - 
12, an intracellular protein, to form an immunosuppressive complex which 
inhibits the regulatory kinase, mTOR (mammalian target of Sirolimus). This 
inhibition suppresses cytokine mediated T -cell proliferation, halting progression 
from the G1 to the S  phase of the cell cycle. I t inhibits acute rejection of 
allografts and prolongs graft survival.  
 
15.22  Formulation : Commercially available for oral administration as: 
Solution, oral: 1 mg/mL (60  mL) 
  
Tablet: 1 mg, 2mg  
 
15.23  Preparation, storage, and stability : Refer to package insert for complete 
preparation and dispensing instructions. Store oral solution under 
refrigeration and protect from light. Store tablets at room temperature and 
protect from  light.  
 
15.24  Administration: Refer to the treatment section for specific administration 
instructions.  
Tablet: Do not crush, split or chew.  
Solution: Mix with at least 2 ounces of water or orange juice. No other liquids 
should be used for dilution. Patient should drink diluted solution immediately. 
The cup should then be refilled with an additional 4 ounces of water or orange 
juice, stirred vigorously, and the patient should drink the contents at once.  
 
15.25  Pharmacokinetic information : (Note: Sirolimus tablets and oral solution 
are not bioequivalent, due to differences in absorption)  
Absorption: Rapid  
Distribution: 12 L/kg (range: 4 -20 L/kg)  
Protein binding: 92%, primarily to albumin 
Bioavailability: Oral solution: 14%; Oral tablet: 18% 
Time to peak, serum: 1-2 hours  
Metabolism: Extensively hepatic via CYP3A4; to 7 major metabolites 
Half -life elimination: 62 hours (range: 46 -78 hours); extended in hepatic 
impairment (Child -Pugh class A or B) to 113 hours  
Excretion : Feces (91% due to P -glycoprotein -mediated efflux into gut 
lumen); urine (2%)  
 
15.26  Potential Drug Interactions : 
Cytochrome P450 Effect: Substrate of CYP3A4 (major), P -glycoprotein;  
Inhibits CYP3A4 (weak)  
Increased Effect/Toxicity: Cyclosporine may increase Sirolimus 
concentrations during concurrent therapy; Sirolimus should be taken 4 hours 
after cyclosporine oral solution (modified) and/or cyclosporine capsules 
(modified). CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase the levels/effects of Sirolimus. 
Refer to package insert for a list of CYP3A4 inhibitors.  
Concurrent use of ACE inhibitors may increase the risk of angioedema. 
Concurrent live organism vaccines may increase the adverse/toxic effect of the 
vaccine; vaccinial infections are possible (avoid concurrent use).  
Voriconazole may decrease the metabolism (via CYP isoenzymes) of 
Sirolimus (avoid concurrent use). Concurrent therapy with calcineurin 
inhibitors (cyclosporine, tacrolimus) may increase the risk of 
HUS/TTP/TMA.  
 
Decreased Effect: CYP3A4 inducers may decrease the levels/effects of 
Sirolimus. Vaccination (dead organisms) may be less effective with 
concurrent sirolimus (monitor).  
 
Ethanol/Nutrition/Herb Interactions : 
Food: Do not administer with grapefruit juice; may decrease clearance of 
sirolimus. Ingestion with high -fat meals decreases peak concentrations but 
  
increases AUC by 23% to 35%. Sirolimus should be taken consistently either 
with or without food to minimize variability.

16.0 Statistical Considerations and Methodology  
 
16.1 Overview: This protocol will assess the efficacy of maintenance auranofin plus 
sirolimus after at least one line of platinum based chemotherapy for lung cancer 
(squamous, Ras -mutated adenocarcinoma, or small cell lung cancer) patients with 
no acceptable st andard treatment options , using a one -stage phase II study 
design. A run -in phase I study (described in Section 7.0) will be conducted to 
determine the MTD for the phase II  portion.  
 
16.[ADDRESS_1247151] to be 
considered evaluable for dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) the subject must 
have received at least one dose of each drug in Cycle 1. If a subject 
withdraws from the study within the first cycle of treatment for reasons 
other th an adverse events, the subject will be replaced; and only DLTs 
occurring in Cycle 1 will be used for establishing safety during the run -in 
phase I study. However, all adverse event data will be summarized in the 
final analysis. For this run -in phase I stud y, DLT the study design is 
defined in Section 7.0. The patients treated at the MTD within the phase I 
will be included in the phase II efficacy analysis. Safety for all patients 
(including the patients in the run -in phase I study) will continue to be 
monit ored via the Adverse Event Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10020].  
 
16.12  Sample Size: Phase I:  The study may involve a maximum of 12 patients 
(6 for each of 2 dose levels).  Phase II:  This study will accrue an 
additional [ADDRESS_1247152] a total of 41 patients accrued to the efficacy 
portion of this study (6 patients at the MTD in the phase I portion plus 35 
patients accrued during the phase II portion). This includes 10% 
overaccrua l of patients during the phase II portion to allow for 
cancellation, ineligibility, and major treatment violations (i.e., accrual of 
[ADDRESS_1247153] 37 evaluable patients as required in 16.41). Overall:  
Therefore, overall, the study will accrue a maximum of 47  patients . 
 
16.13  Accrual Time and Study Duration: The anticipated accrual rate is 
approximately 2 patients per month, based on physician estimate. This 
corresponds to a requirement of approximately 17 weeks to enroll (12 
weeks), treat (4 weeks), and evaluate (1 week to sub mit data) 6 patients. 
Therefore, the accrual time for the phase I portion will be a maximum of 
34 weeks. The overall study duration will be 34 weeks (phase I 
component) + 70 weeks (accrual of an additional 35 patients) + 16 weeks 
(4 months to evaluate the primary endpoint) = 120 weeks (about 28 
months). The final analysis can begin approximately [ADDRESS_1247154] been  submitted.  
  
 
 
 
16.14  Operating Characteristics: The following table gives the probability of 
dose escalation at a single dose level as a function of the true probability 
of DLT at that level using the cohorts of 3 design described in Section 
7.0.

40 0.31 
50 0.17 
 
16.2 Phase I Analysis Plans: All the relevant phase I results pertaining to adverse 
events, MTD, clinical endpoints, and laboratory correlates will be examined in 
an exploratory and hypothesis generating fashion.  
 
16.21  Adverse Events Profile  
 
The number and severity of all adverse events (overall and by [CONTACT_15994]) 
will be tabulated and summarized.  
 
16.22  Clinical Endpoints  
 
Overall survival, progression -free survival, and response will be 
summarized descriptively (overall and by [CONTACT_15994]).  
 
16.3 Phase II Design and Analysis  
 
16.31 Primary Endpoint: The primary endpoint of this trial is the 4 -month 
progression -free survival rate. Throughout Section 16.0, “4 -month 
progression -free survivor” will be considered synonymous with 
“success”, unless otherwise specified. A patient is co nsidered to be a 4 -
month progression -free survivor if the patient is 4 months from 
registration without a documentation of disease progression (note, the 
patient need not be on study treatment at 4 months to be considered a 
success).  All patients meeting the eligibility criteria who have signed a 
consent form and have initiated treatment will be evaluable for the 
primary  endpoint.  
 
16.4 Statistical Design  
16.41  Decision Rule:  The largest success proportion where the proposed 
treatment regimen would be considered ineffective in this population is 
35%, and the smallest success proportion that would warrant subsequent 
studies with the proposed regimen in this patient population is 55%. The 
following one -stage design based on properties of the binomial 
distribution uses [ADDRESS_1247155]  35%.  
The null 4 -month progression -free survival rate of 35% is based on Figure 
  
2 of Scagliotti et al (2008). In the subgroup of patients with squamous cell 
carcinoma on the cisplatin / gemcitabine arm, approximately 65% of 
patients were progression -free 4 months after randomization (i.e., at or 
near completion of first -line therapy).  Four months subsequent to this time 
point, the PFS rate was approximately 25%. Thus, among those who were 
progression -free at or near completion of first -line therapy, the  subsequent  
4-month PFS rate for patients receiving no maintenance therapy 
following first -line cisplatin / gemcitabine is approximately 35% 
(≈0.25/0.65).  
Enter [ADDRESS_1247156] 37 
evaluable patients, we may  recommend further testing of this regimen in 
subsequent studies in this population.  
 
16.411 Over Accrual: If more than the target number of patients are 
accrued, the additional patients will not be used to evaluate the 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_349639]. Analyses 
involving over accrued patients is discussed in Section 16. 34. 
 
16.42  Power and Significance Level: Assuming that the number of successes 
is binomially distributed, the significance level is ≤0.12 and the 
probability of declaring that this regimen warrants further studies (i.e., 
statistical power) under various success propo rtions can be tabulated as 
a function of the true success proportion as shown in the following 
table.  
 
If the true success proportion is . . . . . .  0.35 0.40 0.45 0.50 0.55 
then the probability of declaring that the 
regimen warrants further studies is . . . . . .  0.11 0.28 0.52 0.74 0.90 
 
16.43  Other Considerations: Adverse events, quality/duration of response, 
and patterns of treatment failure observed in this study, as well as 
scientific discoveries or changes in standard care will be taken into 
account in any decision to terminate the  study.  
 
16.5 Analysis Plan: The analysis for this trial will commence at planned timepoints 
and at the time the patients have become evaluable for the primary endpoint. 
Such a decision will be made by [CONTACT_31957], in 
accordance with Mayo Clinic Can cer Center (MCCC) Standard Operating 
Proceedures, availability of data for secondary endpoints (e.g., laboratory 
correlates), and the level of data  maturity.  
 
16.51  Primary  Endpoint  
 
16.511 Definition: The primary endpoint of this trial is the proportion of 
4-month progression -free survivors as defined in Section 16.31.  
 
16.512 Estimation: The proportion of successes will be estimated by [CONTACT_890850]. Confidence intervals for the true success proportion will 
  
be calculated using the properties of the binomial distribution. 
Additionally, if some patients are lost to follow -up not having been 
observed for at least 4 months, an estimate and confidence interval 
for the 4 -month progression -free survival rate incorpo rating 
censoring will be computed using the method of Kaplan -Meier 
(1958).  
 
16.52  Definitions and Analyses of Secondary, Exploratory, and 
Correlative Endpoints  
 
 Survival time is defined as the time from registration to death due to any cause. 
The distribution of survival time will be estimated using the method of Kaplan -
Meier  (1958).  
 Progression -free survival time is defined as the time from registration to the 
earliest date of documentation of disease progression. If a patient dies without a 
documentation of disease progression the patient will be considered to have had 
disease progre ssion at the time of their death. In the case of a patient starting 
treatment and then never returning for any evaluations, the patient will be 
censored for progression [ADDRESS_1247157] imated using the method of Kaplan -Meier  (1958).  
 
 A response is defined to be either a CR or PR noted as the objective status. As 
response rate is a secondary endpoint, confirmation is no longer required per 
RECIST v1.1. The overall response rate will be estimated in the subset of 
patients with measureabl e disease by [CONTACT_890851]. The appropriate confidence interval will be 
calculated based on the binomial distribution.  
 
 Duration of response is defined for all evaluable patients with measurable 
disease who have achieved a response as the date at which the patient’s earliest 
best objective status is first noted to be either a CR or PR to the earliest date 
progression is doc umented. If a patient dies subsequent to the response without a 
documentation of disease progression, the patient will be considered to have had 
disease progression at the time of their death. In the case of a patient failing to 
return for evaluations befo re a documentation of disease progression, the patient 
will be censored for progression on day [ADDRESS_1247158] 
evaluation (whichever one occurs later).  The distribution of  
duration of response will be estimated using the method of Kaplan - 
Meier (1958).  
 
 Translational analyses: Given the small sample size, all translational analyses 
are considered exploratory and no adjustment for multiplicity will be employed.  
One-sided  p-values  
≤0.10 are considered statistically significant throughout. Results 
will be used to design subsequent confirmatory studies (likely as 
translational components within the subsequent phase III study 
should this phase II study support the use of this combination in a 
phase III study).  
 
We consider the analysis of baseline PKCι gene amplification to 
be the primary analysis (though still exploratory) among the 
  
various translational anlayses. PKCι gene amplification will be 
evaluated at baseline using the baseline tissue specimen and 
explored in relation to [ADDRESS_1247159] tables and 
analyzed using Fisher’s exact tests. To estimate power for this 
primary analysis, we assume that 90% of patients (N=33) will 
provide a usable sample (i.e., will have gene amplification status 
for this tissue study). We also assume that 70% of patients (N=23) 
will have PKCι gene amplification (Regala et al., 2005b) and that 
55% of patients overall will have 4 -month PFS.  The proportion  of 
patients with 4 -month PFS will be compared between patients with 
tumors with PKCι  gene amplification to patients with tumors 
without PKCι gene amplification using a 1 -sided α=0.10 Fisher’s 
exact test. We have 86% power to detect a 50% difference in the 
4-month PFS rates (70% vs 20%) between gene amplified and 
gene not amplified groups (calculated using nQuery Advisor 6.01 
with the following parameters: α=0.10 1 -sided, π1=0.70, π2=0.20, 
n1=23, n2=10).  
 
PKCι protein expression (using the baseline tissue specimen) will 
be evaluated at baseline and explored in relation to clinical 
outcomes such as [ADDRESS_1247160] tables and 
box plo ts and analyzed using Fisher’s exact tests or logistic 
regression methods, as appropriate. Further, the relationship 
among PKCι gene amplification and PKCι protein expression will 
be investigated using box plots and scatter plots and analyzed 
using Wilcoxo n rank sum tests and Spearman correlation 
coefficients, as appropriate.  
 
 Adverse Events: All eligible patients that have initiated treatment will be 
considered evaluable for assessing adverse event rate(s). The maximum grade for 
each type of adverse event will be recorded for each patient, and frequency tables 
will be reviewed to determine patterns. Additionally, the relationship of the 
adverse event(s) to the study treatment will be taken into  consideration.  
 
16.53  Data & Safety Monitoring  
 
16.531 The principal investigator(s) and the study statistician will review 
the study at least twice a year to identify accrual, adverse event, 
and any endpoint problems that might be developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. The Mayo 
Clinic Cancer Center (MCCC) Data Safety Monitoring Board 
(DSMB) is responsible for reviewing accrual and safety data for 
this trial at least twice a year, based on reports provided by [CONTACT_890852].  
 
16.532 Adverse Event Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10020] (PHASE II ONLY): The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_890804]. We note that the Adverse Event Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_890805] (1) the study re -opening to 
accrual or (2) at any time during the conduct of the trial and in 
  
consideration of newly acquired information regarding the adverse 
event profile of the treatment(s) under investigation. The study 
team may choose to suspend accrual because of unexpected  
  
 
 
adverse event profiles that have not crossed the specified rule 
below.  
 
Accrual will be temporarily suspended to this study if at any time 
we observe events considered at least possibly related to study 
treatment (ie, an adverse event with attribute specified as 
“possible”, “probable”, or “definite”) that satisfy the following:  
 
• if [ADDRESS_1247161] 20 treated patients (or 10% 
after [ADDRESS_1247162] been accrued) experience a Grade 4 
or higher non -hematologic adverse  event.  
 
We note that we will review Grade 4 and 5 adverse events deemed 
“unrelated” or “unlikely to be related”, to verify their attribution 
and to monitor the emergence of a previously unrecognized 
treatment -related adverse event.  
 
16.6 Results Reporting on ClinicalTrials.gov: At study activation, this study will have 
been registered within the “ClincialTrails.gov” website. The Primary and 
Secondary Endpoints (i.e., “Outcome Measures”) along with other required 
information for this study will be reported on ClinicalTrials.gov. For purposes of 
timing of the Results Reporting, the initial estimated completion date for the 
Primary Endpoint of this study is 32 months after the study opens to accrual. The 
definition of “Primary Endpoint Complet ion Date” (PECD) for this study is at the 
time the last patient registered has been followed for at least [ADDRESS_1247163]

For quality assurance purposes, biopsy tissues will be fixed immediately in 10% 
phosphate -buffered formalin and fixed tissues will be embedded in paraffin.  
Tissue processing will occur at the BAP/PRC Laboratory , which is a College  of 
American Pathologists (CAP) certified  
This laboratory follows the NCI guidelines (National Cancer Institute Best 
Practices for Biospecimen Resources, 2007) and develops customized Quality 
Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) policies and procedures for each study. In  
  
 
 
this particular study, the quality of biopsy tissues will be assessed by [CONTACT_475660] ([CONTACT_890867]) on an H&E slide. For patients who have 
previously undergone biopsy, existing biopsy tissue may be used.  
 
Samples upon arrival will be accessioned into the biorepository through the 
Research Laboratory Information Management System (RLIMS), samples are 
to be forwarded to [CONTACT_890866] laboratory in Griffin Building in MCF.  
 
17.3 Background  
 
Genomic DNA will be extracted from 5 -3μm sections from the biopsy and 
subjected to PRKCI gene copy number analysis as described previously. Sections 
(3μm) from the biopsy will be processed for IHC using established protocols as 
described previously.  
Tissue sections will be stained with antibodies specific to PKCι, phospho -Ser298 - 
Mek, phospho -Thr202/Tyr204 -Erk, phospho -Ser473 -Akt, phospho -Thr70 -4E- 
BP1 and phospho -Ser240/244 -S6 (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.) as previously 
described.  
Expression of these markers will be evaluated as described below for correlation 
with response to Auranofin/Sirolimus therapy with the primary clinical endpoint 
being progression free survival.  
 
Standardization of IHC scoring: A drawback of IHC staining for detection and 
quantification of biomarkers is the inherent variability in IHC staining from 
analysis to analysis and from sample to sample. We will minimize this variability 
by [CONTACT_2164] a “standard curve” of staining inte nsity on a scale from 0 to +[ADDRESS_1247166] curve TMA 
for PKCι as follows: First, we performed  immunohistochemical analysis for  PKCι 
on 4 tissue microarrays (TMAs) containing ~100 well -characterized archived 
primary NSCLC cases. Each of the 100 samples were scored on a 0 to+[ADDRESS_1247167]. 
Andras Khoor. A 0 score corresponds to tumor PKC staining equivalent to the 
surrounding stroma, and scores of +1, +2 and +[ADDRESS_1247168] a new TMA. This “standard curve” 
TMA contains 4 NSCLC cases that exhibit a gradient of PKCι staining 
representative of the full range  of staining intensity across the original 100 
samples ( Figure 1 ). The standard curve will be validated by a second pathologist 
([CONTACT_890868]). For our proposed analysis, tissue sections from each 
enrolled patient will be subjected to IHC for PKCι i n parallel with a section from 
this “standard curve” TMA. The sections will be analyzed at the same time using 
the same reagents and protocol to ensure uniformity of scoring across samples.  
Each experimental sample will be assigned a score, based on the standard curve 
on a 0 to +3 scale, by [CONTACT_890853]. Additionally, image analysis will be 
performed using ImageScope and associated image quantification software.  
  
 
 
 
A similar approach will be used to generate “standard curve” TMAs for each of 
the potential predictors of response, phospho -Ser 298 -Mek, phospho - 
Thr202/Tyr204 -Erk, phospho -Ser473 -Akt, phospho -Thr70 -4E-BP1 and phospho - 
Ser240/244 -S6. IHC scoring criteria a nd interpretation will be guided by 
[CONTACT_890854], and will take into 
account, as appropriate, not only staining intensity, but also percent of tumor cells 
stained positively and nuclear versus cytoplasmic distri bution of phospho - 
antigens. Phospho -Erk scoring will follow the criteria established by [CONTACT_890855]. Specifically, sections will be scored on the following scale: 0=no tumor cells 
stain positively; +1= more than 10% of the tumor cells stained weakly; + 2= more 
than 10% of the tumor cells stained moderately; and +3=more than 10% of the 
tumor cells stained strongly. Phospho -Akt staining will be evaluated based on the 
criteria established by [CONTACT_890856]. Scoring will be on the following scale: 0=no 
staining  in tumor cells; +1=slightly elevated staining in cytoplasm and/or nucleus 
as compared with stromal elements; +2=moderate staining in tumor cell 
cytoplasm and/or nucleus; and +3=dark staining in tumor cells completely 
obscuring cytoplasm and/or  nucleus.  
 
Phospho -S6 staining will be scored using the criteria established by [CONTACT_890857]. 
Specifically, samples will be scored for staining intensity as follows: 0=no tumor 
staining; +1=weak cytoplasmic staining; +2=moderate cytoplasmic staining; and  
+3=strong cytoplasmic staining. Extent of staining will also be scored according 
to the percentage of tumor cells that stain positively for antigen as follows: 0=0% 
of cells staining; +1=≤50% staining; +2=51 -75% cells staining; +3=76 -85% cells 
staining; an d +4=>85% cells staining. The sum of the intensity and extent of 
scoring will be used as the final staining score (0 -7). In their study, Conde et al. 
considered tumors with a final score of ≥5 as being positive or high -intensity, 
whereas those with a final  score of <[ADDRESS_1247169] 
cancer tumors. We will establish such interpretation criteria based on the staining 
patterns exhibited by [CONTACT_890858] r 100 archival 
NSCLC cases. Staining intensity, percent positive cells, staining relative to 
surrounding stroma and nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution will be considered as 
potential criteria in devising standard curve TMAs and scoring paradigms for 
these an tigens. Data from IHC scoring will be analyzed for correlation with 
clinical response using standard statistical treatments by [CONTACT_890859].  
Specifically, the association of the endpoint of PFS at 4 months with the predictor 
variables PRKCI gene copy number (presence of ≥1 extra copy of the gene) and 
IHC scoring for the given marker will be evaluated using logistic regression 
models, where an odds ratio and 95% confidence interval will be estimated. A 
separate logistic regression model will b e utilized for each predictor variable. For 
each marker, IHC scores will be considered as a numerical variable to assess  
  
 
 
evidence of a linear association, and also  as a binary categorical variable based on 
the sample median IHC score for the given marker. Given availability of 
information regarding PFS beyond the time point of interest of 4 months, in 
exploratory analyses, associations of the aforementioned predicto r variables with 
PFS at any time point will be evaluated using the Kaplan -Meier method and Cox 
proportional hazards models (censoring at the date of last follow -up), which will 
account for the varying lengths of follow -up between patients. Diagnostic Slide s

Handbook 12TH ed. Hudson, OH; LexiComp Inc. 2004: 1619 -1631.)  
 
 
Potential  Drug Interactions:  
In vitro data indicate that sirolimus is an inhibitor for CYP2C9, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, 
CYP2C8,  CYP2C19,  CYP2D6,  CYP2El,  and CYP3A4.  In animal  studies,  there  were  no 
GW786034 -related effects on the activities ofCYPlA, CYP2B, CYP2E, CYP3A, and 
CYP4A.  
 
In vitro,  the most  potent  inhibition  was seen for the isoenzyme  CYP2C9.  Accordingly,  the 
following medications which are substrates for CYP2C9 are PROHIBITED in subjects 
receiving sirolimus (the washout period is at the discretion of the clinician based on the 
pharmacokinetic  properties  of each  individual  agent):  
 
• Anticoagulants: warfarin  (therapeutic doses  only)  
• Oral hypoglycemics: glipi[INVESTIGATOR_7130],  glyburide, tolbutamide,  glimepi[INVESTIGATOR_14956],  nateglinide  
• Ergot derivatives:  dihydroergotamine, ergonovine, ergotamine,  methylergonovine  
• Neuroleptic:  pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924]  
• Erectile dysfunction  agents: sildenafil, tadalafil,  vardenafil  
• Antiarrhythmics: bepridil, flecainide, lidocaine, mexilitine, amiodarone, quinidine, 
propafenone  
• Immune modulators:  cyclosporine,  tacrolimus,  sirolimus  
• Miscellaneous: theophylline,  quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050],  risperidone, tacrine, cloazapi[INVESTIGATOR_050],  atomoxetine  
 
Certain medications should be used with CAUTION due to the potential for alterations in the 
pharmacologic  effects or increased  adverse events secondary to the inhibition  of multiple 
CYP enzymes by [CONTACT_738609]. These medications  include (but are not limit ed to):  
 
• Antidepressants: amitriptyline, buproprion,  fluoxetine,  fluvoxamine,  imipramine  
66 MC102A   
 
• HMG co -reductase  inhibitors: atorvastatin,  fluvastatin, lovastatin,  simvastatin  
• Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]: alprazolam,  midazolam, triazolam, clorazepate, diazepam,  flurazepam  
• Calcium channel blockers: diltiazem, felodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], nicardipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], nimodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
nitrendipi[INVESTIGATOR_050],  verapamil, amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050],  nisoldipi[INVESTIGATOR_050],  isradipi[INVESTIGATOR_050]  
• Angiotensin II blockers: losartan,  irbesartan  
• Beta blockers: carvedilol,  metoprolol,  propanolol,  timolol  
• Anticonvulsants:  phenobarbital, phenytoin,  primadone,  carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]  
• Miscellaneous: codeine, methadone, mifepristone, estrogens and progestins (including 
oral contraceptives)  
• Oral  hypoglycemics: pi[INVESTIGATOR_051],  rosigitazone  
 
In vitro data also suggest that sirolimus is a substrate for CYP3A4. Therefore, substances that 
induce or inhibit CYP3A4  may alter the pharmacologic  effects of sirolimus and should  be 
used with CAUTION. These medications  include (but are not limited  to):  
 
Inhibitors of CYP3A4:  
• Antibiotics:  clarithromycin, erythromycin,  troleandomycin  
• HIV: anti -retrovirals (delaviridine), protease inhibitors (ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, 
nelfinavir, amprenavir,  lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054])  
• Antifungals:  itraconazole, ketoconazole,  voriconazole,  fluconazole  
• Antidepressants: nefazodone,  fluvoxaine  
• Calcium channel blockers: verapamil,  diltiazem  
• GI: cimetidine,  aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053]  
• Miscellaneous: grapefruit  or its juice  
 
Inducers  of CYP3A4:  
• Glucocorticoids:  cortisone  (> 50 mg),  hydrocortisone  (> 40 mg),  prednisone  (>10 mg), 
methylprednisolone  (> 8 mg),  dexamethasone  (> 1.5 mg)Anticonvulsants:  phenytoin, 
carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050],  Phenobarbital,  oxcarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]  
• HIV: efavirenz,  nevirapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]  
• Antibiotics: rifampin, rifabutin,  rifapentine  
• Miscellaneous:  St. John's  wort,  modafinil

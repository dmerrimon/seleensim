Name [CONTACT_3261]:   Upadacitinib 
(ABT-494)Date of Protocol Synopsis:   31 July 2020
Protocol Title:  A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Induction Study to 
Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Upadacitinib (ABT-494) in Subjects with Moderately to Severely 
Active Ulcerative Colitis.
Objective:  The primary objective of Study M14-675 (Phase 3 induction) is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib 45 mg once daily (QD) compared to placebo in inducing clinical remission (per Adapted Mayo score) in subjects with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC).
At the time of this amendment, the study has closed screening.
Investigators:   Multicenter
Study Sites:   Approximately 400 sites worldwide.
Study Population:   Males and females between 18 and 75 years of age with a diagnosis of moderately 
to severely active UC. Adolescent males and females 16 and 17 years of age with body weight ≥ 40 kg 
and meet the definition of Tanner Stage 5 will be enrolled if approved by [CONTACT_355252]/health authority. If these approvals have not been granted, only subjects ≥ [ADDRESS_442219] of a mixed population:  biologic-inadequate responders (bio-IR) and non-biologic-inadequate responders (non-bio-IR).   
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   A total of approximately [ADDRESS_442220] 25% and not exceed 50% of the total number of subjects enrolled.
Methodology:
Study M14-675 is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed 
to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral administration of upadacitinib 45 mg QD compared to placebo as induction therapy for up to 16 weeks in subjects with moderately to severely active UC.
At the end of either Week 8 (Part 1) or Week 16 (Part 2), if subjects are eligible, they will be offered an 
opportunity to participate in Study M14-[ADDRESS_442221] 2016-000642-62
10
Methodology (Continued):
Subjects who consent and meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be 
enrolled into Study M14-675, which consists of two parts:  (Part 1) a randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled 8-week induction study; and (Part 2) an 8-week Extended Treatment Period for clinical non-
responders from Part 1.
Part 1
In Part 1, approximately 462 subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to double-blind upadacitinib 
45 mg QD or matching placebo for 8 weeks.  The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_68790]-IR status (bio-IR vs non-bio-IR), corticosteroid use (yes or no) and Adapted Mayo score ( ≤ 7 or > 7) at Baseline.  
Within bio-IR, the randomization will be further stratified by [CONTACT_355253] ( ≤ 1 or 
> 1).  Within non-bio-IR, the randomization will be further stratified by [CONTACT_355254] (yes or 
no).
Treatment groups for Part 1 include:
!Group 1:  Upadacitinib 45 mg QD (blinded, n = 308)
!Group 2:  Placebo QD (blinded, n = 154)
At Week 8, subjects achieving clinical response, defined as a decrease from Baseline in the Adapted 
Mayo score ≥ 2 points and ≥  30% from Baseline, PLUS a decrease in rectal bleeding subscore (RBS) ≥ 1 
or an absolute RBS ≤  1 may be eligible to enter the 52-week, double-blind, maintenance portion of 
Study M14-234 (Substudy 3). 
All subjects who do not achieve clinical response at Week 8 will be eligible to participate in Part 2 
(Extended Treatment Period) to receive open-label upadacitinib 45 mg QD for an additional 8 weeks.
Part 2
Part 2 is an open-label, 8-week Extended Treatment Period for subjects who do not achieve clinical 
response at Week 8 in Part 1.  The objectives of Part 2 are to offer upadacitinib induction treatment to 
placebo clinical non-responders from Part 1 and to evaluate delayed clinical response of upadacitinib in 
subjects who do not initially respond during Part 1.  The blind from Part 1 will not be broken for the 
duration of the study as subjects will be assessed as clinical non-responders at the 8 Week Visit of Part 1 
and will be moved to Part 2 for further treatment in the study without identifying their initial treatment assignment.  All eligible subjects entering Part 2 will receive open-label treatment with upadacitinib 
45 mg QD for 8 additional weeks (until Week 16).  At Week 16, an endoscopy will be performed to evaluate the treatment effect.  A flexible rectosigmoidoscopy is recommended.  However, the use of 
flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy is at the investigators' discretion based on local practice. 
During Part 2, subject with persistent symptoms or worsening UC may be discontinued at any time.  At 
Week 16, subjects who achieve clinical response may be eligible to enter Study M14-234 (Substudy 3) 
for further blinded treatment.  Subjects who do not achieve clinical response at Week 16 will be discontinued from the study and will not be eligible to enroll in Study M14-533 (long term extension).

Methodology (Continued):
Part 2 (Continued)
All subjects will be provided with a Subject Diary (eDiary) at Screening in Study M14- [ADDRESS_442223]'s diary from the most 
recent consecutive 3-day period prior to each study visit.  If diary entries from the [ADDRESS_442224] diaries will be measured at the same time period as the stool frequency and rectal 
bleeding subscores.  Proportion of subjects who report no abdominal pain and proportion of subjects 
who report no bowel urgency in the 3 days will be estimated.  
At each study visit, a routine physical examination including evaluation of vital signs, evaluation of 
extra-intestinal manifestations (EIMs), diary review, monitoring for adverse events (AEs), review of 
concomitant medications, and completion of laboratory assessments will be performed.  A full physical 
examination will be performed at Screening, Baseline, Week 8 and Week 16/Premature Discontinuation 
(PD) (for subjects who enter the Extended Treatment Period) and must include an evaluation of extra-
intestinal manifestations.  Symptom based physical examinations will be performed at all other visits at a 
minimum, but evaluation of EIMs will still be completed at every study visit.
Subjects will undergo a full colonoscopy with biopsy for histologic assessment during Screening with 
local investigator assessment for Mayo endoscopic subscore for initial eligibility assessment, confirmed by a central reader prior to randomization.  At end of treatment (Week 8 in Part 1) a full colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy, depending on the extent of disease at Screening, will be performed.  
For subjects in Part 2, an endoscopy will be performed at Week 16/PD.  A flexible rectosigmoidoscopy 
is recommended at Week 16/PD, however, the use of flexible rectosigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy will be based on the investigator's discretion per local practice. 
The endoscopic subscore result from the central reader during the screening period will be used to 
evaluate the eligibility of a subject to enroll in the study and for all efficacy assessments at Week 8 of Part 1.  However, for re randomization into Substudy 3, the endoscopic subscore at Week 8 (Study M14-675 Part 1) or Week 16 (Study M14-675 Part 2) based on the local reader's assessment will be used to determine clinical response status compared to the Baseline assessment of the central reader for enrollment into Study M14-234 Substudy 3.
In addition to the Mayo endoscopic subscore, the central reader will assess the endoscopy findings using the Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS) scoring system for additional exploratory analyses.  Blood samples will be collected for high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), upadacitinib 
plasma concentrations and other biomarker analyses.  In addition, stool samples for fecal calprotectin will be collected.  The stool samples should be taken before starting bowel preparations for scheduled endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
Subjects will be asked to fill out the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ), Work 
Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI), European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L), Short Form 36 Item (SF-36), and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F), Ulcerative Colitis Symptoms Questionnaire (UC-SQ), and Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGIS; only in select sites) during the study at Baseline, Week 2, and Week 8/PD for Part 1.  These same questionnaires will be completed at Week 16/PD for Part 2.

Methodology (Continued):
Subjects will be asked to fill out the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) during the study at 
Week 2, and Week 8/PD for Part 1.  This same questionnaire will be completed at Week 16/PD for Part 2.  During each study visit subjects will also be asked to report UC-related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_355207] a part of the supplemental Health Care Resource Utilization (HCRU) form of Adverse Event collection in electronic data capture. 
Subjects will be discontinued from the study if they withdraw consent or if they are deemed unsuitable 
to continue for any reason by [CONTACT_093].
Washout Period:
Subjects, who have been taking exclusionary medications prior to screening must complete medication 
washout.  The duration is based on the excluded medication as described in the protocol.  However, for subjects who have discontinued infliximab, certolizumab, adalimumab, golimumab, vedolizumab, natalizumab, ustekinumab, if there is proper documentation of an undetectable drug level measured by a commercially available assay for any of the approved biologics above, there is no minimum washout prior to Baseline.  Protocol-related adverse events should be reviewed and subjects must complete the washout prior to the Baseline Visit. 
Concomitant UC-Related Medications (Oral Corticosteroids, Antibiotics, Aminosalicylates, and/or 
Methotrexate):
Parts 1 and 2
All UC-related concomitant medications should be kept on stable doses in Parts 1 and 2. All subjects 
receiving stable dose of UC-related antibiotics (those subjects who did not discontinue), aminosalicylates, or MTX at Week 0 will maintain their concomitant treatments and respective doses through the end of the study.  Dose may be decreased or terminated in the event of moderate to severe treatment related toxicity (e.g., leukopenia or elevated liver enzymes) in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871].

Primary Endpoint:  
The primary endpoint for Study M14-675 is the proportion of subjects who achieve clinical remission 
per Adapted Mayo score (defined as stool frequency subscore [SFS] ≤ 1 and not greater than baseline, 
RBS of 0, and endoscopic subscore ≤ 1) at Week 8.  Note:  evidence of friability during endoscopy in 
subjects with otherwise "mild" endoscopy activity will confer an endoscopic subscore of 2.
Ranked Secondary Endpoints: 
1. Proportion of subjects with endoscopic improvement at Week 82. Proportion of subjects with endoscopic remission at Week 83. Proportion of subjects achieving clinical response per Adapted Mayo Score at Week 8
4. Proportion of subjects achieving clinical response per Partial Adapted Mayo score (defined as 
decrease from Baseline ≥ 1 points and ≥  30% from Baseline, PLUS a decrease in RBS ≥ 1 or an 
absolute RBS ≤  1) at Week 2
5. Proportion of subjects achieving histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement at Week 8
6. Proportion of subjects who reported no bowel urgency at Week 8
7. Proportion of subjects who reported no abdominal pain at Week 8
8. Proportion of subjects who achieved histologic improvement at Week 8 9. Change from Baseline in IBDQ total score at Week 8
10. Proportion of subjects with mucosal healing at Week 8
11. Change from Baseline in FACIT-F score at Week 8.
Pharmacokinetic:   Blood samples will be collected for measurement of upadacitinib plasma 
concentration at Week 2, Week 6, and Week 8/PD in Part 1.
Safety:   Safety analyses will be performed on all subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug.  
Incidence of AEs, changes in vital signs, electrocardiogram, physical examination results, and clinical 
laboratory data will be assessed.
Exploratory Research Variables and Validation Studies (Optional):
Prognostic, predictive and pharmacodynamics biomarkers signatures may be investigated.  Samples for 
different applications, including pharmacogenetic, epi[INVESTIGATOR_18193], transcriptomic, proteomic and targeted investigations will be collected at various time points.  Assessments will include but may not be limited to nucleic acids, proteins, metabolites or lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805].

Statistical Methods:
Efficacy:
For Study M14-675, the efficacy analysis will be based on intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis set.  The ITT 
analysis set includes all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study drug from Study M14-675.  The ITT analysis set that includes all subjects in Part 1 who received blinded upadacitinib 45 mg QD or matching placebo is denoted as ITT1 population.  The ITT analysis set that includes all subjects in Part 2 who received open label upadacitinib 45 mg QD dose is denoted as ITT2 population.  ITT1 is the primary analysis set of Study M14-675.  The comparisons between upadacitinib and placebo treatment groups in the ITT1 population for the primary efficacy and key ranked secondary endpoints will be performed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test and will be stratified by [CONTACT_68790]-IR status (bio-IR vs non-bio-IR), corticosteroid use (yes or no), and Adapted Mayo score ( ≤ 7 or > 7) 
at Baseline.  Non-responder imputation (NRI) method, where subjects with missing data at scheduled assessment visits will be considered as "not achieved" for the clinical remission, will be used for primary analysis.  Primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints will be summarized descriptively for ITT2 population.
Pharmacokinetic:
Individual plasma concentrations of upadacitinib will be tabulated and summarized.  A non-linear 
mixed-effects modeling approach will be used to estimate the population central values and the empi[INVESTIGATOR_355209] (CL/F) and volume of distribution (V/F).  Additional parameters may be estimated if useful in the interpretation of the data.
Safety:
The safety analysis set consists of all subjects who received at least one dose of study medication.  For 
the safety analysis, subjects are assigned to a treatment group based on the treatment actually received, regardless the treatment randomized.  Incidence of AEs, changes in vital signs, physical examination results, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and clinical laboratory values will be analyzed.  Treatment-emergent adverse events will be tabulated by [CONTACT_355256] (MedDRA) preferred term for each treatment group for each Substudy and over the entire study.  Mean change from Baseline for laboratory and vital signs data will be summarized.

3.0 Introduction
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is one of the two primary forms of idiopathic inflammatory bowel 
disease (IBD).  It is postulated that UC is caused by [CONTACT_355257].
[ADDRESS_442254], and 19.2 per 100,000 person-years in North America, with a prevalence of 505 cases per 100,000 persons in Europe and 249 cases per 100,000 persons in North America.
2  The 
burden of UC on the healthcare system is profound, accounting for nearly 500,000 physician visits and more than 46,000 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_355210] (US) alone.
[ADDRESS_442255] severe intestinal manifestations of UC are toxic megacolon and perforation.  Extraintestinal complications include arthritis (peripheral or axial involvement), dermatological conditions (erythema nodosum, aphthous stomatitis, and pyoderma gangrenosum), inflammation of the eye (uveitis), and liver dysfunction (primary sclerosing cholangitis).  Patients with UC are at an increased risk for colon cancer, and the risk increases with the duration of disease as well as extent of colon affected by [CONTACT_90050].
[ADDRESS_442256] chronic steroid treatment.
7  Patients with moderate to severe 
symptoms may derive some benefits from immunomodulatory agents (azathioprine [AZA], 6-mercaptopurine [6-MP], or methotrexate [MTX]); however, the use of these agents is limited as induction treatment due to a slow onset of action (3 to 6 months) and as maintenance therapy due to adverse events (AEs), including bone marrow suppression, infections, hepatotoxicity, pancreatitis, and malignancies.
7,8  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_353750], 
approximately 15% of UC patients experience a severe clinical course, and 30% of these patients require removal of the colon/rectum, to eliminate the source of the inflammatory process, although accompanied by [CONTACT_355258].

Rationale for Development of a JAK Inhibitor in UC
The Janus kinases or JAKs are a family of intracellular tyrosine kinases that function as 
dimers in the signaling process of many cytokine receptors.  The JAKs play a critical role in both innate and adaptive immunity, making them attractive targets for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.  Targeting the Janus activated kinase (JAK) signaling pathway for autoimmune diseases, is supported by [CONTACT_110976]-inflammatory cytokines that signal via JAK pathways in the pathogenesis of these immune-related disorders.  The activation of JAK signaling initiates expression of survival factors, cytokines, chemokines, and other molecules that facilitate leukocyte cellular trafficking and cell proliferation, which contribute to inflammatory and autoimmune disorders.
[ADDRESS_442259] been associated with infections, including herpes zoster reactivation, malignancies, and asymptomatic, mild and reversible changes in levels of hemoglobin, lymphocyte counts, white blood cell counts, serum creatinine, total cholesterol, high density liporprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and liver transaminases (alanine transaminase [ALT], aspartate transaminase [AST]) and creatine phosphokinase (CPK).
18,19
Upadacitinib is a novel selective Janus kinase (JAK) 1 inhibitor.  JAK1 inhibition blocks the signaling of many important pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-7, and IL-15, which are known contributors to inflammatory disorders.  Through modulation of these proinflammatory cytokine pathways, upadacitinib offers the potential for effective treatment of inflammatory or autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), giant cell arteritis (GCA), Takayasu arteritis, polyarticular course juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pcJIA), Crohn's disease (CD), UC and atopic dermatitis (AD).  The clinical hypothesis is that, 
Upadacitinib
M14-[ADDRESS_442260] 2016-000642-62
31
based on the differentiated selectivity profile for JAK inhibition, upadacitinib could 
demonstrate an improved benefit/risk profile compared to other less selective JAK inhibitors or other therapeutic strategies for patients with inflammatory diseases. 
To date, upadacitinib has been investigated in 22 Phase 1 studies with healthy volunteers 
(one of which also employed a substudy in subjects with mild to moderate RA), and multiple Phase 2 or Phase 3 studies for indications of RA, CD, AD, PsA and UC.  Upadacitinib has been shown to be effective in the treatment of the indicated medical conditions based on the data available from the various studies.  Safety results across the studies showed that upadacitinib was well tolerated and the types and frequencies of AEs were consistent with subjects with the medical conditions receiving immunomodulatory therapy.  Many of the safety findings are expected for the class products with JAK inhibition, such as infections, increase in LDL-C and HDL-C, and asymptomatic and transient CPK elevation.   
Upadacitinib has been evaluated in Phase 2b dose ranging placebo-controlled study in 
subjects with moderately to severely active UC with a history of inadequate response to or intolerant to immunosuppressants, corticosteroids or biologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (Study M14-234 Substudy 1).  At the time of this protocol development, Phase 2b interim results from Study M14-[ADDRESS_442261] rates observed in 45 mg once daily (QD) treatment group for both clinical and endoscopic endpoints.  Upadacitinib was generally safe and well tolerated.  No new safety concerns were identified compared to what has been observed in studies of upadacitinib in other disease indications.
A detailed discussion of the preclinical toxicology, metabolism, pharmacology and safety 
experience with upadacitinib can be found in the current Investigator's Brochure.
[ADDRESS_442262] not failed biologic therapy.
Clinical efficacy of JAK inhibition has been demonstrated in the treatment of UC.  
Tofacitinib is recently approved for the treatment of UC.
21  However, the non-selectivity 
of tofacitinib targeting JAK1, JAK2 and JAK3 has been associated with a number of safety issues.
17-19,22,23
Upadacitinib is a novel JAK1 selective inhibitor with minimal inhibitory effects on JAK2 and JAK3, which could potentially minimize some of the reported safety concerns with non-selective JAK inhibition which are thought to be mediated by [CONTACT_110978]2 and JAK3 signaling pathways.  
The available long-term safety data from the Phase 3 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) studies 
with upadacitinib did not show any new significant safety concerns compared to the marketed JAK inhibitors. The findings of an increased risk of infections, herpes zoster, and abnormal laboratory changes have been observed (e.g., elevations of serum transaminases, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], creatine phosphokinase, and reductions in hemoglobin and white blood cells) with upadacitinib. The incidence rates of other clinically important adverse events such as cardiovascular events, malignancies and mortality reported during the RA studies were within the expected range for the general population or for a population of patients with moderately to severely active RA. Events of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) 
Upadacitinib
M14-[ADDRESS_442263] 2016-000642-62
33
and pulmonary embolism (PE) have been reported in patients receiving JAK inhibitors 
including upadacitinib.
The results of genetic toxicology testing indicate that upadacitinib is not genotoxic; 
however, upadacitinib is teratogenic based on animal studies, which necessitates avoidance of pregnancy in females of childbearing potential. Based on the calculated safety margins for human fetal exposure with seminal fluid transfer, there is judged to be no risk to the pregnancy of female partners of male subjects who are treated with upadacitinib. Male trial participants are therefore not required to use contraception when participating in upadacitinib clinical trials.
We propose to initiate a Phase 3 study in UC subjects based on the following supportive 
findings:  1) demonstrated improved potency of upadacitinib versus tofacitinib in preclinical models of inflammation; 2) confirmed JAK1 selectivity of upadacitinib in both preclinical and clinical settings; 3) acceptable preclinical toxicological findings in chronic toxicity studies in two species; 4) acceptable safety and tolerability profile of upadacitinib in single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose studies in healthy volunteers; 5) evidence that JAK inhibition in inflammatory bowel disease results in clinical and endoscopic improvement; and 6) evidence of efficacy and safety in a different inflammatory disease (rheumatoid arthritis).  The current Phase [ADDRESS_442264] had an inadequate response or intolerance to oral aminosalicylates, immunosuppressants, corticosteroids, and/or biologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
As presented above, the completed Phase [ADDRESS_442265] 2016-000642-62
34
In view of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the benefit:risk profile of various 
immunomodulatory therapi[INVESTIGATOR_82624]-19 is being evaluated.  At this time, the effects of upadacitinib on the course of COVID-19 are not well defined.
3.3 Safety Evaluations
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_320113], physical examination, vital signs, ECG, 
imaging and clinical laboratory testing during the study.  Laboratory assessments will include hematologic parameters, chemistry, liver function tests, and lipid parameters.
4.0 Study Objective
The primary objective of Study M14-675 (Phase 3 induction) is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib 45 mg once daily (QD) compared to placebo in inducing clinical remission (per Adapted Mayo score) in subjects with moderately to severely active UC who have demonstrated inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance to oral aminosalicylates, immunosuppressants, corticosteroids, and/or biologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the efficacy of upadacitinib 45 mg 
QD comparing with placebo in ranked secondary endpoints of achieving endoscopic improvement, endoscopic remission, clinical response per Adapted Mayo Score, clinical response per Partial Adapted Mayo score, histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement, no bowel urgency, no abdominal pain, histologic improvement, mucosal healing, and change in IBDQ total score and FACIT-F score.
The study will allow enrollment of up to 30% of enrolled bio-IR subjects who have failed 
[ADDRESS_442266] discontinued for reasons other than inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance (e.g., change of insurance/reimbursement, well-controlled disease, etc.) may be enrolled but must meet other criteria for inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance to aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressants as defined in the protocol.  The study will allow for enrollment of up to 20% enrolled non-bio-IR subjects who could also have previous use of a biologic therapy but discontinued based on reasons 
Upadacitinib
M14-[ADDRESS_442267] 2016-000642-62
35
other than inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance.  The study will also 
evaluate the efficacy of an additional 8-week upadacitinib 45 mg QD treatment in subjects who did not achieve clinical response in the initial 8-week induction phase.
5.0 Investigational Plan
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description
At the time of this amendment, screening for the study has closed.
This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study 
designed to evaluate the ef ficacy, safety, a nd pharmacokinetics of upadacitinib as 
induction therapy in subjects with moderately to severely active UC who have been inadequate responders or intolerant to oral aminosalicylates, immunosuppressants, corticosteroids, and/or biologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  The number of enrolled non-biologic-inadequate responders (non-bio-IR) subjects will be at least 25% and not exceed 50%. 
Study M14-675 will allow enrollment of up to 30% of enrolled bio-IR subjects who have 
failed [ADDRESS_442268] discontinued for reasons other than inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance (e.g., change of insurance/reimbursement, well-controlled disease, etc.) may be enrolled but must meet other criteria for inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance to aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressants as defined in the protocol.  The study will allow for enrollment of up to 20% enrolled non-bio-IR subjects who could also have previous use of biologic therapy but discontinued based on reasons other than inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance.  
The study is designed to enroll approximately [ADDRESS_442269] 2016-000642-62
36
The study duration could be up to 25 weeks (excluding a possible washout period), 
including a Screening Period of up to 5 weeks, an 8-week double-blind Induction Period, an 8-week Open Label Extended Treatment Period (for eligible subjects), and a 30-day Follow-Up Period, if the subject does not meet eligibility to proceed to Study M14-234 Substudy 3.
Study visits may be impacted due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  This may include changes 
such as phone or virtual visits, visits at alternative locations, or changes in the visit frequency and timing of study procedures, among others.  Additional details are provided in the subsequent section.  Every effort should be made to ensure the safety of subjects and site staff, while maintaining the integrity of the study.  If visits cannot be conducted onsite due to travel restrictions or other pandemic-related reasons, follow the updates below on how to proceed.  These measures will only be implemented under the protocol in countries that are affected by [CONTACT_25963]-19 pandemic.
Subjects (n = 462) who consent and meet all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion 
criteria as defined in Section 5.2.1 and Section 5.2.2 will be enrolled into Study M14-675, 
which consists of two parts:  (Part 1) a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
8-week induction study; (Part 2) an 8-week open-label Extended Treatment Period for clinical non-responders from Part 1.  The number of non-bio-IR subjects will be at least 25% and not exceeding 50%.
In Part 1, approximately 462 subjects will be enrolled.  Eligible subjects will be 
randomized in a 2:1 ratio to one of the two treatment groups (double-blind upadacitinib 45 mg QD or matching placebo) for 8 weeks.  
The following are the treatment groups for Part 1 of Study M14-675:
●Group 1:  Upadacitinib 45 mg QD (blinded, n = 308)
●Group 2:  Placebo QD (blinded, n = 154)
Upadacitinib
M14-[ADDRESS_442270] 2016-000642-62

Part 2 is an open-label, 8-week Extended Treatment Period for subjects who did not 
achieve clinical response at Week 8 in Part 1.  The objectives of Part 2 are to offer upadacitinib induction treatment to placebo clinical non-responders (defined by [CONTACT_355259]) from Part 1, and to evaluate delayed clinical response to upadacitinib in subjects who do not initially respond to upadacitinib during Part 1.
During COVID-[ADDRESS_442271] effort to perform the 
endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_355214]. For subjects with missing endoscopy at Week 8/16when endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_355215]-[ADDRESS_442272] is a clinical responder at Week 8/16, the subject may enter Study M14-533Cohort 1.  If the subject is a clinical non-responder at Week 8, the subject may enter Part 2.  If the subject is a clinical non-responder at Week [ADDRESS_442273].
The blind from Part 1 will be maintained as these subjects will be assessed simply as non-
responders and moved to Part 2 for further treatment in the study.  All eligible subjects entering Part 2 will receive open-label treatment with upadacitinib 45 mg QD for 8 additional weeks (until Week 16). 
Subjects who achieve clinical response defined by [CONTACT_355260] 8 or 
Week 16 and do not meet any study discontinuation criteria will be eligible to enroll into Study M14-234 Substudy 3 following written informed consent. They do not need to meet the listed inclusion and exclusion criteria in the Study M14-234 protocol prior to this transfer to Substudy 3.  Subjects with missing Week 8 or/and Week [ADDRESS_442274] 2016-000642-62

The data collected from subjects in Part 2 will not be part of the primary efficacy analysis 
for the induction study; descriptive statistics will be used, and the results will be reported separately in the clinical study report.
Subjects are not eligible to enter into Part [ADDRESS_442275] to Part 2 will be based on the local reader scoring.  Visits will occur at Week 10, 12, 14, and 16, and an endoscopy will be performed at Week 16. A flexible sigmoidoscopy is recommended, however the use of colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy is at the investigator's discretion based on local practice.
Figure [ADDRESS_442276] been met.
An electronic diary (e-diary) will be dispensed and training will be provided to the subject 
at the Screening Visit in Study M14-675 (see Section 10.3 details).
With the exception of the QuantiFERON TB-Gold Plus and [COMPANY_003] tests (requirements outlined in Section 5.3.1 [Clinical Laboratory Tests]), exclusionary laboratory values can 
be re-tested once during the Screening Period. If the re-tested lab value(s) remain(s) exclusionary, the subject will be considered a screen failure. Redrawing samples if previous samples were unable to be analyzed would not count as a retest since previous result was never obtained.
Subjects who have been taking exclusionary medications prior to screening or Baseline 
must complete medication washout.  The duration is based on the excluded medication as described in the protocol.  During Screening, biologic drug levels may be optionally assessed at the investigator's discretion as an alternative to completing the required washout period: (1) infliximab and natalizumab:  may be tested approximately [ADDRESS_442277] dose; (2) adalimumab, certolizumab, golimumab, or vedolizumab: may be tested approximately [ADDRESS_442278] dose; (3) ustekinumab:  may be tested approximately [ADDRESS_442279] not been fulfilled.
8-Week Induction Period – Part 1
This period will begin at the Baseline Visit (Week 0) and will end at the Week 8 Visit.  At 
the Baseline Visit, subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria described in Section 5.2.1 and Section 5.2.2 will be enrolled into the study and 
randomized to the double-blind induction period.  During this period of the study, subjects will visit the study site at Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8.  A ± 3-day window is permitted around scheduled study visits.  The last dose of study drug during this period is recommended to be taken the day prior to the Week 8 Visit when possible.
NOTE: All Baseline Visit procedures must be performed onsite.
8-Week Extended Treatment Period - Part 2
The period will begin after the Week 8 endoscopy in Part 1 and will end at the Week 16 
Visit. 
At Week 8, subjects in Part 1 who did not achieve clinical response (defined by [CONTACT_355261]) will be enrolled into Part 2 and receive open label upadacitinib 45 mg QD for an additional 8 weeks.  Clinical response is defined as decrease from baseline in the Adapted Mayo score ≥ 2 points and ≥ 30% from baseline, PLUS a decrease in rectal 
bleeding score (RBS) ≥ 1 or an absolute RBS ≤ 1.

VaccinesVaccines recommended by [CONTACT_110985].  If the investigator 
chooses to administer a vaccine, this should be completed before first dose of study drug with appropriate precautions and time interval.  It is recommended that subjects be up to date for recommended inactivated, toxoid or biosynthetic vaccines, such as injectable flu vaccine, pneumococcal, and pertussis (Tdap). 
If the subject and investigator choose to receive/administer live vaccines, these 
vaccinations must be completed (per local label) at least 30 days (8 weeks for subjects in Japan) before first dose of study drug.  Live vaccinations are prohibited during study participation including at least 30 days (or longer if required locally) after the last dose of study drug. 
If the live herpes zoster vaccine is to be administered and there is no known history of 
primary varicella (chicken pox), preexisting immunity to varicella should be confirmed with antibody testing at or prior to Screening and prior to administration of the herpes zoster vaccine.  If screening varicella antibody testing is negative, the live herpes zoster vaccine should not be administered.

5.3.1 Efficacy and Safety Measurements Assessed and Flow 
Chart
Study procedures described are listed in the following section of this protocol and are 
summarized in tabular format in Appendix C .
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Procedures
The study procedures outlined in the Study Activities in Appendix C and Appendix D are 
discussed in detail in this section, with the exception of exploratory research and 
validation studies (discussed in Section [IP_ADDRESS]), drug concentration measurements 
(discussed in Section 5.3.2), the collection of prior and concomitant medication 
information (discussed in Section 5.2.3), and the collection of AE information (discussed 
in Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  All study data will be recorded in source documents and on the 
appropriate eCRFs.
Informed Consent
At the Screening Visit, the subject will sign and date a study specific, Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC)/Independent Review Board (IRB) approved, Informed Consent Form (ICF) before any study procedures are perfor med or any medications are withheld from 
the subject in order to participate in this study.  A separate informed consent will be required for each subject in order to participate in the optional exploratory research and validation studies.  Clinical responders at either Week 8 or Week 16 will provide consent for participation in Substudy 3 of Study M14-234; a separate informed consent will be required for each subject in order to participate in the Study M14-[ADDRESS_442327] in accordance with local regulations.
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
Subjects will be evaluated to ensure they meet all inclusion criteria and have none of the 
exclusion criteria at both Screening and Baseline Visits.
Medical and Surgical History
A complete medical and surgical history, including UC-onset date, history of UC 
medication use, and history of alcohol and tobacco use will be obtained from each subject at the Screening Visit.  History of herpes zoster, herpes zoster vaccination, and hepatitis B vaccination status will be recorded as part of the medical history.  An updated medical history will be obtained prior to study drug administration at Baseline, to ensure the subject is still eligible for enrollment, and updated as necessary.
Prior corticosteroid, aminosalicylate, azathioprine, 6-MP and MTX use will be asked.  In 
addition, for subjects in Japan and Taiwan, prior tacrolimus use will be asked.  If subjects have/had ever been treated with these medications, the duration of therapy, maximum dose, reason for use and reason(s) for termination of treatment will be recorded in subjects' source document and in the appropriate eCRF.  The details of dates of administration and dosages within the past 90 days will also be recorded.
A detailed biologic therapy history (e.g., anti-TNF, anti-adhesion therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) will be 
recorded, this includes names of biologic therapy used, duration of therapy, doses,
reason(s) for use and reason(s) for termination of treatment with these products must be documented in the subjects' source documents and in the appropriate eCRF.

intolerance to aminosalicylates, immuno-modulators, corticosteroids and/or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_355223]' source documents.  A detailed medical history with respect to TB exposure will be documented.  This information will include Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination, cohabitation with individuals who have had TB, and residence or work in TB endemic locations.
Physical Examination
A full physical examination will be required to be performed at Screening, Baseline and 
Week 8 and Premature Discontinuation Visit (Part 1) Week 16 and Premature Discontinuation Visit (Part 2) and must include an assessment of extra-intestinal manifestations (EIMs).  
For subjects aged 16 or 17 a Tanner Stage assessment will be completed at the screening 
visit to confirm eligibility.  This may be completed by [CONTACT_355266]-assessment (completed by [CONTACT_423]/legally authorized representative) per local requirements. If completed by [CONTACT_6270]-assessment, study site is responsible for training the 
subject/legally authorized representative appropriately.
The physical examination at the Baseline Visit will serve as the Baseline physical 
examination for the entire study.  Abnormalities noted after the Baseline Visit and first dose of study drug will be evaluated and documented by [CONTACT_355267].  All findings whether related to an adverse event or part of each subject's medical history will be captured on the appropriate eCRF page.
A symptom-directed physical examination will be performed at all other visits when 
necessary.  If a subject reports any symptoms that requires additional physical examination besides the extra-intestinal manifestation (EIM), a symptom-based physical examination will be performed.  The assessment of EIMs must be completed at all study visits.  Please refer to Appendix C .

Height and Weight
For Subjects ≥18 years of age, height (with shoes off) will be measured at the Screening 
Visit.  For subjects 16 or 17 years of age, height (with shoes off) will be measured at the 
Screening Visit, Week [ADDRESS_442330] or caregiver as needed.
Vital Signs
Vital sign determinations of systolic and diastolic blood pressure in sitting position, pulse 
rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and body temperature will be obtained at each visit.  Blood pressure (BP), pulse rate and respi[INVESTIGATOR_176383].  
COVID-[ADDRESS_442331] X-Ray (CXR)
A CXR (posterior-anterior and lateral views) is required for all subjects at Screening to 
rule out the presence of TB or other clinically relevant findings (In Japan, a computed tomagraphy (CT) scan of the chest may be performed in lieu of a CXR, at investigator's discretion).
The CXR will not be required if the subject had a previous normal CXR (posterior-
anterior and lateral views) (or normal CT Scan of the chest for subjects in Japan) within 
Upadacitinib
M14-[ADDRESS_442332]'s medical history to warrant a repeat test.  The investigator may obtain a Baseline CXR if clinically indicated for a specific subject.
Subjects can have a repeat CXR anytime during the study as warranted based on the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_871].
A radiologist (or pulmonologist) must perform an assessment of the CXR (or CT Scan of 
the chest for subjects in Japan).  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_355224].  In the assessment of the CXR (or CT Scan of the chest for subjects in Japan) for the presence of TB, the radiologist (or pulmonologist for subjects in Japan) and/or Principal Investigator (or designee) must indicate the presence or absence of (1) calcified granulomas, (2) pleural scarring/thickening, and (3) signs of active TB.  In case of any abnormality indicative of active TB, the subject should not be enrolled into the study.  If the chest x-ray demonstrates changes suggestive or previous TB (e.g., calcified nodule, fibrotic scar, api[INVESTIGATOR_110962]) or other findings that are clinically significant, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_110963]. 
COVID-[ADDRESS_442333] may continue in the study after discussion with TA MD.  CXR should be performed as soon as restrictions allow at study site or local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/facility.
12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG)
For all subjects, a resting 12-lead ECG will be performed at Screening and 
Week 8/Premature Discontinuation Visit and Week [ADDRESS_442334]'s source documents onsite.
For subjects with a normal ECG taken within [ADDRESS_442335]'s medical history to warrant a repeat test.
ECG should always be performed prior to obtaining blood samples. Subjects can have a 
repeat ECG at any time during the study as warranted based on the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871].
COVID-[ADDRESS_442336].
TB Testing/TB Prophylaxis
Screening
All subjects must be evaluated for TB at screening and annually, unless the subject is 
considered to be TB test positive prior to screening. The TB screening tests are diagnostic test results to be interpreted in the context of the subject's epi[INVESTIGATOR_623], history, exam findings, etc. and it is the responsibility of the investigator to determine if a subject has active or latent tuberculosis.  Expert consultation for the evaluation and/or management of TB may be considered per Investigator discretion.
For all subjects, evidence of increased risk for TB will be assessed by a questionnaire 
(Appendix G ) and tested for TB infection by [CONTACT_82736]-TB Gold Plus test.  The site 
Upadacitinib
M14-[ADDRESS_442337] 2016-000642-62
66
staff will complete the TB risk assessment form in its entirety (Part 1 and Part 2) and enter 
the data into the appropriate eCRF.  The TB risk assessment form will be completed annually (Part 1 only) for all subjects, regardless of TB test results.  One or more "yes" response on the TB risk assessment form indicates increased risk of TB.
If a subject has a QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus test within [ADDRESS_442338]'s medical history to warrant a repeat test. If a subject only had a negative [COMPANY_003] test within [ADDRESS_442339] (also known as a TB Skin Test or Mantoux Test) does not need to be repeated, provided nothing has changed in the subject's medical history to warrant a repeat test.  These cases may be discussed with the [COMPANY_013] TA MD.  The results of the TB test(s) will be retained at the site as the original source documentation.
Subjects with a negative TB test and chest x-ray (CXR) not suggestive of active TB may 
be enrolled. Subjects with history of active TB may be enrolled if it has been adequately treated with no evidence of current active TB; subjects with inadequate documentation of treatment should be cleared by a TB specialist prior to enrollment.
Subjects with a positive TB test must be assessed for evidence of active TB versus latent 
TB, including signs and symptoms and CXR.  Subjects with no signs or symptoms and a CXR not suggestive of active TB may be enrolled after initiation of TB prophylaxis (see below).  Subjects with evidence of active TB must not be enrolled.
For subjects with a negative TB test result at Screening or the most recent evaluation, an 
annual TB follow-up test will be performed. 
If an annual TB test is newly positive (seroconversion), a chest x-ray (CXR) needs to be 
performed as soon as possible to aid in distinguishing active versus latent TB, and 
Upadacitinib
M14-[ADDRESS_442340] after the 
patient has started the study should be reported as an AE of latent TB or active TB (as applicable).
If the subject is experiencing signs or symptoms suspi[INVESTIGATOR_176367]'s medical history to warrant investigation and a repeat test before the next scheduled annual TB retest, the case (including the TB test results) should be discussed with the [COMPANY_013] TA MD.
TB TestingThe QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus test (or equivalent) should be performed at Screening 
on all subjects.  The [COMPANY_003] skin test should be utilized when the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus test (or equivalent) is not possible or if both tests are required per local guidelines:
●Subjects with documentation of prior positive result of QuantiFERON-TB 
Gold Plus Test and/or [COMPANY_003] Skin Test and/or history of latent or active TB.  It 
is not required to repeat either test at Screening or during the study and should be considered positive.
●For regions that require both [COMPANY_003] and QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus testing, both will be performed.  If either [COMPANY_003] or QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus is positive, the TB test is considered positive.  
●If TB testing is done at Screening for subjects with a prior positive TB test and a positive result is reported, the subject is considered TB test positive.
If TB testing is done for subjects with a prior positive TB test at the annual 
evaluation, repeated TB prophylaxis in not required for a positive result unless 
indicated by [CONTACT_423]'s medical history.  The [COMPANY_003] Skin Test should be utilized only when a QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus Test is not possible for any 
reason (unless both tests are required per local guidelines).
●If only a [COMPANY_003] is placed at screening, then the TB test to be used for the 
remainder of the study for that subject is the [COMPANY_003].  Similarly, if a subject 
enters the study with a QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus test alone, then the 
Upadacitinib
M14-[ADDRESS_442341].
●If the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus Test is NOT possible (or if both the 
QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus Test and the [COMPANY_003] are required per local 
guidelines) the [COMPANY_003] will be performed.  The [COMPANY_003] should be read by a licensed 
healthcare professional between [ADDRESS_442342].  The reaction will be measured in millimeters (mm) of 
induration and induration ≥ 5 mm is considered a positive reaction.  The 
absence of induration will be recorded as "0 mm" not "negative."  
●Subjects who have an ulcerating reaction to [COMPANY_003] in the past should not be re-exposed and the [COMPANY_003] should be considered positive. 
●If the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus test is indeterminate, then the investigator 
should perform a local QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus test (or through the 
central laboratory if not locally available) to rule out a positive test result.  If testing remains indeterminate or is positive, then the subject is considered to 
be positive for the purpose of this study.  If the testing result is negative, then 
the patient is considered to be negative. 
●Interpretation of a positive TB test in low risk subjects:  In cases where the 
QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus test by [CONTACT_355268] (i.e., no risk factors identified using the T Part I and Part II questions of the TB risk assessment 
questionnaire at Screening or Part I questionnaire annually) and has no clinical 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_110958], the investigator may perform a local QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus test (or repeat testing through the central laboratory if not locally 
available) to confirm the positive test result.  If the repeat testing result is 
negative, the investigator may consider the test to be negative based on his/her clinical judgment; if the repeat testing result is positive or indeterminate, the 
test is considered positive.
●An alternative Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) (such as T-SPOT TB 
test) may be substituted for the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus.
Upadacitinib
M14-[ADDRESS_442343] or [COMPANY_003] should be performed as soon as restrictions allow at study site or local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/facility.
TB prophylaxisAt screening, if the subject has evidence of latent TB infection (no symptoms, positive TB 
test and the subject has a chest x-ray not suggestive of activ e TB), prophy lactic treatment 
must be initiated at least 2 weeks prior to administration of the study drug (or per local guidelines, whichever is longer).  At least 6 months of prophylaxis need to be completed; however, the full course of prophylaxis does not need to be completed prior to the first dose of study drug.  If the investigator deems that it is necessary, consultation with a TB expert can be considered.  
In Ireland, the full course of prophylaxis treatment must be completed prior to the first 
dose of the study drug.
Note:  Rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_355225].Subjects with a prior history of latent TB that have documented completion of a full 
course of anti-TB therapy will be allowed to enter the study provided nothing has changedin the subject's medical history warrant repeat treatment. 
For subjects with completion of a full course of anti-TB therapy but insufficient 
documentation the investigator should consult with the [COMPANY_013] TA MD prior to enrolling the subject.
Newly initiated prophylactic treatment should be captured in the eCRF and in the source 
documents.  Prior therapy should be captured in the eCRF.
Upadacitinib
M14-[ADDRESS_442344] 6 months of prophylaxis.  Study drug (s) should not be withheld.  Two to four weeks later, the subject should be re-evaluated (unscheduled visit) for signs and symptoms as well as laboratory assessment of toxicity to TB prophylaxis.
If the subject is experiencing signs of symptoms suspi[INVESTIGATOR_355226]'s medical history to warrant a repeat test, the case (including the TB test results) must be discussed with the [COMPANY_013] TA MD prior to enrolling the subject.
Pregnancy Tests
A serum pregnancy test will be performed by [CONTACT_355269].  If the serum pregnancy test is positive the subject is considered a screen failure.  If the serum pregnancy test is borderline, it should be repeated ≥ [ADDRESS_442345] is:
●Positive, the subject is considered a screen failure;
●Negative, the subject can be enrolled into the trial;
●Still borderline ≥  [ADDRESS_442346] enrolment.
●For subjects in Ireland and Argentina, a repeat serum pregnancy test ≥ 3 days 
later that is still borderline will result in screen failure.  (A borderline serum pregnancy test may be repeated more than once during the screening period.)
Women of childbearing potential includes all women who are not surgically sterile (both 
ovaries and or both fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_355227]) or post-menopausal (defined as at least [ADDRESS_442347] one year, without an alternate medical reason for amenorrhea and a FSH level 
> 40 IU/L).
Women of childbearing potential will have a urine pregnancy test performed locally by 
[CONTACT_355270].
Women of childbearing potential will also have a urine pregnancy test performed at home

Hepatitis B
Subjects will be tested for the presence of HBV at screening using the following tests:
●HBs Ag (Hepatitis B surface antigen)
●HBc Ab/anti-HBc (Hepatitis B core antibody)
●HBs Ab/anti-HBs (Hepatitis B surface antibody)
HBV serologic test results will be interpreted and managed as shown in Figure 2.
●A positive result for HBs Ag will be exclusionary.
●A negative result for HBs Ag will trigger automatic reflex testing for core 
antibodies (HBc Ab) and surface antibodies (HBs Ab).
●For a subject who has had an HBV vaccination (should document in the 
medical history), a positive test result for HBs Ab is expected, the HBV DNA 
PCR qualitative testing is notrequired and the subject may be enrolled 
(Scenario B). 
●A negative test result for HBc Ab does notrequire HBV DNA PCR qualitative 
testing and the subject may be enrolled (Scenarios A and B).  
●A positive test result for HBc Ab requires HBV DNA PCR testing (automatic 
reflex testing) (Scenarios C and D).
●A positive result for HBV DNA or a result that exceeds detection sensitivity 
will be exclusionary.
●A subject with a negative result for HBV DNA may be enrolled.

M14-[ADDRESS_442349] Results
* A positive test result for HBs Ab is expected for subjects who have had a HBV vaccination.  For subjects without a 
history of HBV vaccination (and for subjects in Japan) a positive result for HBs Ab/anti-HBs requires HBV DNA 
PCR testing.
** Where mandated by [CONTACT_5277]; subjects with HBs Ab+ and/or HBc Ab+ and negative HBV DNA at 
Screening should have HBV DNA PCR testing performed approximately every [ADDRESS_442350] has a history of HBV vaccine and HBs Ab+ and HBc Ab–. If 
necessary, HBV DNA PCR may be tested at unscheduled visits.

HIV
Subjects with HIV infection (positive HIV test) are excluded from study participation.  An 
anti-HIV antibody (Ab) test will be performed at Screening, unless prohibited by [CONTACT_427].  The investigator must discuss any local reporting requirements to local health agencies with the subject.  The site will report confirmed positive results to their health agency per local regulations, if necessary.  If a subject has a confirmed positive result, the investigator must discuss with the subject the potential implications to the subject's health and subject should receive or be referred for clinical care promptly.  [COMPANY_013] will not 
receive results from the testing and will not be made aware of any positive result.
Clinical Laboratory Tests
Blood samples will be obtained for the laboratory tests listed in Table 1.  Tests should 
always be performed only after all clinical assessments, questionnaires (Inflammatory 
Bowel Disease Questionnaire [IBDQ], etc.) and vital sign determinations are obtained during a visit.
A certified central laboratory will be utilized to process and provide results for the clinical 
laboratory tests.  All abnormal laboratory tests that are considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_111002] a satisfactory resolution.
The central laboratory chosen for this study will provide instructions regarding the 
collection, processing and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_110965].
The blood samples for serum chemistry tests should be collected following a minimum 
8-hour fast, when possible.  If a subject is not able to fast when necessary, due to unforeseen circumstances, the non-fasting status will be recorded in study source documentation.  The fasting status will be recorded in the laboratory request, source document and eCRF.

Urinalysis
Urine samples will be obtained and sent to the central laboratory for the tests listed in 
Table 1.  Microscopic urinalysis will only be performed by [CONTACT_355271], where abnormal is defined as leukocytes, nitrite, ketone, protein, blood or glucose value of greater than a trace.  Sites will not be provided with urinalysis dipsticks.
Other Laboratory Assessments
High Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein
Blood samples for high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) will be obtained.  Blood 
draws should be performed after all clinical assessments, questionnaires (IBDQ, etc.), and vital sign determinations are obtained.  The hs-CRP test will be performed by [CONTACT_355272] C and Appendix D .  The results will be 
blinded to the sponsor, investigator, study site personnel, and the subject.  Local laboratory or site testing for CRP is not allowed after Baseline with the exception when the subject has a medical condition in which CRP level is deemed to be necessary for the diagnosis and treatment in Investigator's discretion and after consulting with the [COMPANY_013] 
TA MD.  For future data assessments, it may be required to unblind the CRP data in an interim interval.
Lymphocyte Subsets (TBNK)
Blood samples will be collected at Baseline, Week 8 and Premature Discontinuation in 
Part 1 or at Week 16/Premature Discontinuation, as applicable, of the Extended Treatment Period of Part 2 to assess the effects of upadacitinib inhibition on lymphocyte subsets:  T (CD4+ and CD8+) cells, B (CD19+) cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and natural killer T (NKT) cells.  These tests will be performed by [CONTACT_265277].

3. No longer than [ADDRESS_442361] safety lab tests.
Stool Samples Collected
Fecal Calprotectin
Fecal calprotectin will be performed for all subjects as indicated in Appendix C and 
Appendix D .  Subjects will be asked to provide a stool sample, subjects will be sent home 
with instructions and stool sample supplies (supplies will be provided).
The fecal calprotectin results will remain blinded to the sponsor, investigator, study site 
personnel and the subject throughout the study.  Local laboratory or site testing for fecal calprotectin is not allowed after Baseline. 
All stool samples should be collected before any bowel preparation for endoscopy is 
started.  The central laboratory will be utilized to process and provide results for these laboratory tests.  For future data assessments, it may be required to unblind the CRP data in an interim interval.

Subjects who are positive for C. difficile toxin should be screen-failed; these subjects may 
be re-screened after completing the appropriate treatment.  For subjects who are 
borderline for C. difficile toxin, the investigator may send another sample for a test. If the 
result is negative, the investigator may consider the test to be negative based on his/her judgment. If the result is positive or borderline, the test is considered positive and subject should be screen failed. For those subjects with two borderline results, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_355229] C. difficile treatment is needed based on his/her clinical judgment; these subjects may 
be re-screened with or without C. difficile treatment.

M14-[ADDRESS_442365] Diary
Subjects will be dispensed an electronic diary (eDiary) at Screening and the site staff will 
enter the NORMAL baseline number of stools in a 24-hour period when the subject's UC is notactive to allow for scores to be calculated.
Subjects will be trained on how to complete the diary by [CONTACT_355275].  All subjects should complete their subject diary on a daily basis throughout the entire study.  The diary will be reviewed by [CONTACT_355276]/PD Visit.  If subjects require re-training during the study, the site staff will accommodate this requirement.
In case of missing diary information, or when discrepancies are discovered, site personnel 
should discuss with the subject and document changes in site records, if applicable.  Completion will be reinforced during study visits as necessary as the diary data required to be entered by [CONTACT_423](s) cannot be changed or altered in any way.
Study Drug Dispensing/Administration
Study drug will be dispensed to subjects at the time points indicated in Appendix C and 
Appendix D . 
Study drug will be taken orally once daily beginning at the Baseline Visit and should be taken at approximately the same time each day.  At scheduled visits, study drug should be 
administered after all assessments and examinations scheduled for that day have been completed if the visit occurs at the time the subject is taking study drug each day.  If study drug is being taken earlier then when the visit is set to occur, the time of the last two doses will be documented in the eCRF and pharmacokinetic (PK) samples drawn at the visit.

○[COMPANY_013] will not receive subject identifying information related to these 
shipments, as the site will work directly with the courier.
The study site is responsible for meeting IRB/IEC reporting requirements related to DTP 
shipments of study drug, and for obtaining consent to provide delivery information to the courier and documenting this consent in source documents.
DTP study drug shipment will be allowed on the study for the duration of the COVID-19 
pandemic and will be removed once the pandemic is considered to be resolved.
Mayo Score/Partial Mayo Score
Data from the subject diaries will be collected in order to calculate Mayo Score/Partial 
Mayo Score at the time points indicated in Appendix C and Appendix D .
Whenever possible, the same physician (investigator or sub-investigator) should determine the Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) subscore for an individual subject through the duration for the study.  The directions for capturing the stool frequency subscore (SFS), rectal bleeding subscore (RBS), and PGA subscores of the Mayo score are described in Appendix F . 
Diary entries from the most recent [ADDRESS_442370] is randomized as the central reader review of the endoscopy video is required for study entry (central reading can take up to 3 business days).  For other scheduled visits, the endoscopy may not occur after the visit, only on the day of or in advance of the scheduled visit.  This window may be extended as necessary after consultation with the [COMPANY_013] TA MD in case of external, not subject-related circumstances (e.g., scheduling conflict).
Endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_355232] a primary central reader who is blinded to the subject's 
clinical data, the site's endoscopy assessment and the subject's therapy.  If, in the assessment of the endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_355233], the Screening endoscopy shows a normal colonic mucosa, the subject should be screen-failed and the video should not be sent for central reading.  The endoscopy will be used for calculation of the endoscopy subscore of the Mayo Score.  The endoscopy subscore will be documented by [CONTACT_66923][INVESTIGATOR_355234]'s source documents.  In addition to endoscopic evaluation using Mayo endoscopic sub-score, the endoscopy findings using the Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS) scoring system will be used for additional exploratory analyses.  During all endoscopy procedures, the endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_355235] a clear demarcation between normal and inflamed mucosa and document the distance from the anal verge (in centimeters) in the eCRF.
Screening Endoscopy:   A full colonoscopy will be performed at Screening.  The 
endoscopy subscore result from the central reader will be entered into the eCRF by [CONTACT_355279] a subject at Baseline for the study.  The central reader's assessment will be used in the Mayo score calculations for all efficacy endpoint assessments.
Week 8 (Part 1), Week 16 (Part 2 – Extended Treatment Period) Endoscopy:   The 
Week 8 endoscopy may be either a full colonoscopy or a flexible sigmoidoscopy 
depending on the extent of the disease at Screening.  The endoscopy should be performed up to the segment where a clear demarcation of inflammation is observed.  For subjects that entered Part 2 (Extended Treatment Period), an endoscopy will be performed at 
Upadacitinib
M14-[ADDRESS_442371] 2016-000642-62
85
Week 16.  A flexible sigmoidoscopy is recommended at Week 16; however, the use of a 
flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy will be based on the investigator's discretion per local practice.  The site's endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_355236]-randomization into Substudy 3.  For the Week 8 or Week 16 re-randomization, the local reading will be compared with the baseline central reading in order to determine clinical response status.  The central reader's assessment will be used for the Mayo scores used in all efficacy endpoint assessments.  
The same endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_355237], where possible, perform all endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_355238].  In addition, where possible, the investigator or subinvestigator should be the endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_355239].  The endoscopy subscores by [CONTACT_355280]'s source documents and in the database but the central reader's endoscopy subscore will be used for the efficacy analyses.
COVID-19 Pandemic-Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications
If an Endoscopy required at Week 8 and Week 16 is not able to be scheduled at the study 
site in the required protocol window due to COVID-19, then this may be performed ± 7 days from the planned visit and can be completed at a different Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/facility.
If the endoscopy cannot be performed during this extended window at the site or another 
location, please refer to the guidance for subjects outlined in Section 5.1.
Biopsy During Endoscopy
Appropriate documentation of biopsy results consistent with the diagnosis of UC, in the assessment of the investigator, must be available in order to confirm the subject's eligibility for the study.  If this documentation is not available a diagnostic biopsy from the most affected observed area of the colon must be performed during the Screening endoscopy and read by a qualified local pathologist and the results reviewed by [CONTACT_093], the central laboratory will not provide a pathology report during the screening endoscopy to document UC diagnosis.  Biopsies to rule out dysplasia and colon

cancer may be taken per the investigator's discretion during any endoscopy performed
during this study and evaluated by [CONTACT_165495].
Biopsies sent to the central laboratory will not be returned to sites and will be retained for 
study use only.
Obtainment of biopsy samples should also be recorded on the video.The signed pathology report will be monitored by [CONTACT_355281]'s source documents onsite.  Subjects should not be enrolled if high grade colonic dysplasia or colon cancer is discovered at the Screening endoscopy.  Subjects may be enrolled if low grade colonic dysplasia is discovered during endoscopy and is completely removed.  If a diagnosis of high grade colonic dysplasia or colon cancer is discovered during any subsequent endoscopic evaluation during the course of the study, the findings should be recorded as an AE and the subject should be discontinued from the study.  If low grade colonic dysplasia is discovered during any subsequent endoscopic evaluation during the course of the study, the findings should be entered as an AE and the subject can continue in the study if the lesion has been completely removed.
During all endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_154371] 3 sets of biopsies are to be collected; one mandatory set of 
biopsies and, if consented for, two optional sets of biopsies. Each set of biopsies should consist of 2 samples each obtained from the rectosigmoid colon (approximately 15 –30 cm from the anal verge) for histologic assessment. For each set of [ADDRESS_442373] inflammation (if the area is ulcerated, the sample should be obtained from the edge of the ulcer), and one from an area that is representative of the general degree of mucosal inflammation present in that segment.  For all histology biopsies, the location of the biopsy specimen (distance from the anal margin) should be recorded.
For China only:  only a single biopsy at each endoscopy from the most inflamed area 
(HistoMOST) will be required per local requirements.  The single, required biopsy will be 
Upadacitinib
M14-[ADDRESS_442374] inflammation (if the area is ulcerated, the sample should be 
obtained from the edge of the ulcer) for histologic assessment at each required timepoint as per Appendix C .
For follow-up endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014], in the absence of any visible lesions or areas of general inflammation characteristic of UC, up to 3 sets of biopsies should be collected from normal mucosa in the same segments as noted above.
Biopsy Sample Collection, Storage and Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]:
Biopsies performed to confirm the diagnosis of UC or to rule out current 
dysplasia/malignancy should be processed and read locally per site standards.
Biopsy specimens per subject should be obtained by [CONTACT_355282] C and Appendix D .  Using routine forceps for 
tissue collection, obtain the required number of biopsy specimens and process the specimens following the instructions in the study-specific laboratory manual.
Intestinal Tissue Analysis
The following analyses will be sent to the central laboratory and performed on tissue 
samples: 
●Qualitative UC histological assessment using Geboes histologic activity 
score,
25and other histologic scoring systems.  These samples may not be read 
in real time, however if unexpected findings, such as dysplasia, are noted on 
the histology biopsies, the central laboratory will contact [CONTACT_355283]/her about the unexpected finding.  Subjects who are found to have 
high grade colonic dysplasia on the submitted biopsy will be terminated from the trial at the time the dysplasia is discovered.  Unexpected findings should be 
recorded as an adverse event.  
●Subjects will have the option to provide tissue biopsies (per local 
requirements) for future exploratory research and/or validation studies.  For 
more information, please refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS].

Appendix D as soon as possible after the last dose of study drug and preferably prior to 
the administration of any new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
Unscheduled Visits
An Unscheduled Visit should be performed when the subject comes in for a medical visit 
for evaluation and assessment.  During Unscheduled Visits, blood and urine samples will be obtained for the laboratory tests listed in Table 1, or for other tests at the investigator's 
discretion.
Visits for dispensing new study drug in case of temperature excursion, loss or damage are 
not considered an Unscheduled Visit.  In addition, visits to only retest a lab will not be considered an Unscheduled Visit.

[IP_ADDRESS] Collection of Samples for Analysis
Blood samples for assay of upadacitinib and possibly other concomitant medications will 
be collected at the following times:
●Part 1:  Week 2, Week 6 and Week 8/PD 
On visits where the blood samples for assay of upadacitinib are being collected as noted, samples should be collected prior to dosing and the subjects should take the study drug dose at the clinic after collecting the PK blood sample, when possible.  However, if the subject normally takes the study drug dose at a time that is much earlier or after the time of the scheduled study visit, the subject should follow the regular dosing schedule and the PK sample will be collected at any time during the visit.
The date and accurate time of the PK sample collection and the last two study drug doses 
will be recorded on the applicable requisition forms and in the eCRF to the nearest minute.
Refer to the study specific laboratory manual for detailed instructions on sample

●Serious infections (e.g., sepsis) which cannot be adequately controlled by [CONTACT_14181]-
infective treatment or would put the subject at risk for continuation of the 
study drug.
●Malignancy, except for localized NMSC or carcinoma in-situ of the cervix
●Subject develops a gastrointestinal perforation (other than appendicitis or mechanical injury)
●Confirmed diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus or non-
cardiac, non-neurologic arterial thrombosis
In order to minimize missing data for efficacy and safety assessments, subjects who 
prematurely discontinue study drug treatment should continue to be followed for all regularly scheduled visits, as outline in the Activity Schedule, unless they have decided to discontinue the study participation entirely (withdrawal of informed consent).  Subjects should be advised on the continued scientific importance of their data even if they discontinue treatment with study drug early.
If a subject prematurely discontinues study participation (withdrawal of informed 
consent), the procedures outlined for the Premature Discontinuation Visit must be completed as soon as possible, preferably within [ADDRESS_442392] dose 
of study medication to determine the status of any ongoing AEs/serious AEs (SAEs) or the occurrence of any new AEs/SAEs.
All attempts must be made to determine the date of the last study drug dose and the 
primary reason for premature discontinuation or study participation.  The information will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page.  However, these procedures should not interfere with the initiation of any new treatments or therapeutic modalities that the investigator feels are necessary to treat the subject's condition.  Following discontinuation

M14-[ADDRESS_442393] will be treated in accordance with the investigator's best 
clinical judgment, irrespective of whether the subject decides to continue participation in the study.
For subjects that are considered lost to follow-up, reasonable attempts must be made to 
obtain information on the final status of the subject.  At a minimum, two phone calls must be attempted and one certified letter must be sent and documented in the subject's source documentation. 
Subjects who discontinue the study prematurely will not be replaced.

For subjects who are asymptomatic and had primary exposure to COVID-19 (e.g., family 
member tests positive) or have concerns about taking upadacitinib with ongoing COVID-19 transmission.  The investigator can decide to continue or interrupt study drug on a case-by-case basis taking into account the risk:benefit of continuing study drug. The 
investigator can temporarily interrupt study drug at any time for a safety issue, or for any reason if they feel that the risk outweighs the benefit of study treatment.
5.4.2 Discontinuation of Entire Study
The study will be discontinued or terminated in case of an unacceptable risk, any relevant 
toxicity, or a negative change in the risk/benefit assessment.  This might include the occurrence of AEs with a character, severity or frequency that is new in comparison to the existing risk profile.  In addition, any data deriving from other clinical trials or toxicological studies which negatively influence the risk/benefit assessment might cause discontinuation or termination of the study.
[COMPANY_013] may terminate this study prematurely, either in its entirety or at any study site, for 
reasonable cause provided that written notice is submitted in advance of the intended termination.  The investigator may also terminate the study at his/her site for reasonable cause, after providing written notice to [COMPANY_013] in advance of the intended termination.  Advance notice is not required by [CONTACT_26257].  If [COMPANY_013] terminates the study for safety reasons, [COMPANY_013] will immediately notify the investigator by [CONTACT_26258].

5.5.1 Treatments Administered
Subjects will be randomized into a 2:1 ratio to double-blind upadacitnib 45 mg QD or 
matching placebo for 8 weeks.  The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_68790]-IR status (bio-IR vs non-bio-IR), corticosteroid use (yes or no) and Adapted Mayo score ( ≤ 7 or > 7) at 
Baseline.  Within bio-IR, the randomization will be further stratified by [CONTACT_355253] ( ≤ 1 or > 1).  Within non-bio-IR, the randomization will be further 
stratified by [CONTACT_355254] (yes or no). 
Subjects that do not achieve clinical response after induction will be offered open-label 
upadacitinib 45 mg QD for an additional 8 weeks (until Week 16 in the Extended Treatment Period). 
If a subject is unable to come to the study site to pi[INVESTIGATOR_355242]-19, a direct-to-patient (DTP) study drug shipment can be made from the study site to the subject if allowed by [CONTACT_427]. [COMPANY_013] will submit any required notifications to the regulatory authority as applicable. Refer to see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for 
details on DTP shipment of study drug.
DTP study drug shipment will be allowed for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic 
and will be removed once the pandemic is considered to be resolved.

to accommodate study design.  Each kit label will contain a unique kit number.  This kit number is assigned to a subject via Interactive Response Technology (IRT) and encodes the appropriate study drug to be dispensed at the subject's corresponding study visit.  Each kit will be labeled as required per country requirements.  Labels must remain affixed to the kits.  All blank spaces, if applicable, on the label will be completed by [CONTACT_176434].
[IP_ADDRESS] Storage and Disposition of Study Drug
The study drug must be stored at controlled room temperature (15° to 25°C/59° to 77°F).  
The controlled storage area should have a temperature recording device.  A storage temperature log is to be maintained to document proper storage conditions.  Malfunctions or temperature excursions must be reported to the sponsor immediately.  In case of a temperature excursion, study medication should be quarantined and not dispensed until [COMPANY_013] Clinical Drug Supply Management (CDSM) or [COMPANY_013] Temperature Excursion Management System (ATEMS) deems the medication as acceptable.  The investigational products are for investigational use only and are to be used only within the context of this study.  The study drug supplied for this study must be maintained under adequate security and stored under the conditions specified on the label until dispensed for subject use or destroyed on site according to local procedures or regulations or returned to the

5.5.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups
All subjects will be centrally randomized using a web based Interactive Response 
Technology (IRT).
All subjects will be assigned a unique identification number by [CONTACT_51044].  In Part 1, 462 subjects who meet all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria defined in Section 5.2.1 and Section 5.2.2 will be centrally randomized in a 2:1 ratio to 
receive one of two treatment groups at Baseline (Week 0) in a double-blind manner (upadacitinib 45 mg QD, or placebo QD).  The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_68790]-IR status (bio-IR vs non-bio-IR), corticosteroid use (yes or no) and Adapted Mayo score (≤7 or > 7) at Baseline.  Within bio-IR, the randomization will be further stratified by 
[CONTACT_355253] ( ≤ 1 or > 1).  Within non-bio-IR, the randomization 
will be further stratified by [CONTACT_355254] (yes or no).
The IRT will assign a randomization number that will encode the subject's treatment 
group assignment according to the randomization schedule generated by [CONTACT_355290] 5.1definitions.
IRT will provide the appropriate medication kit number(s) to dispense to each subject as per Section 5.1.  Study drug will be administered at the study visits as summarized in Section 5.1.  Returned study medication should not be re-dispensed to any subject.
All subjects will keep the same unique subject identification number throughout the study and program.

The study consists of two parts, in Part 1, upadacitinib 45 mg QD is compared with 
placebo as induction therapy for 8 weeks.  Part 2 consists of open-label upadacitinib 45 mg QD in an Extended Treatment Period for an additional 8 weeks to provide treatment for those who were treated with placebo or who did not respond to the initial 8-week upadacitinib treatment.
A comparative study utilizing a placebo control design provides an unbiased assessment 
of the efficacy and safety profile of upadacitinib.  In order to provide a potentially efficacious regimen to all participating subjects, subjects in Study M14-675 who do not achieve clinical response after completion of the 8-week induction treatment will be received oral upadacitinib therapy for an additional 8 weeks. 
Rationale of placebo use in this study
A placebo controlled study is necessary for new medication registrational purposes.  
Based on the guidance provided in the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Tripartite Guideline, Topic E10 "Choice of Control Group in Clinical Trials,"
34a placebo-
controlled trial design, using randomization and blinding has been implemented in the study in order to minimize subject and investigator bias, and support an objective assessment of all study endpoints.  Current EMA guidelines on the development of new 
Upadacitinib
M14-[ADDRESS_442406] 2016-000642-62

medicinal products for the treatment of Ulcerative Colitis (UC)35state that "unless the 
study is aiming at demonstrating superiority against an existing treatment, it is critical that 
assay sensitivity can be demonstrated, ideally by [CONTACT_1583] a placebo arm."  A placebo control is the most objective comparator and a prerequisite for confirmation of clinical benefit in a Phase 3 trial.
In order to minimize the exposure to placebo during the studies, in the induction phase,
subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive upadacitinib or placebo for 8 weeks. If subjects do not respond at Week 8, an open label treatment of upadacitnib 45 mg QD will be provided for an additional 8 weeks.
It should also be noted that in this program, if the subjects are at stable and permitted dose
of aminosalicylates, corticosteroids and/or methotrexate at Baseline, the treatment can be continued in the study.  Also, at any time of the study, subjects may discontinue from the study for any reason, including lack of response.
5.6.[ADDRESS_442407] Population
Male and female subjects, including adults and adolescents (16 or 17 years old) when 
locally permissible, with moderately to severely active UC who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria are eligible for enrollment in this study.  The specific population chosen was based on the unmet medical need of those subjects with a history of inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance to oral aminosalicylates, immunosuppressants, corticosteroids, and/or biologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].

5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
The results from the Substudy 1 of Study M14-234 in subjects with UC show that all 
evaluated doses using the extended release (ER) tablet formulation (7.5 mg QD to 45 mg QD) were generally well tolerated and without unexpected safety concerns consistent with the observations in Phase 2b studies in CD (Study M13-740; up to 24 mg twice daily using the immediate-release [IR] capsule formulation [exposures equivalent to 60 mg ER QD]), AD (Study M14-680; up to 30 mg ER QD), two Phase 2 studies in RA (Studies M13-537 and M13-550; up to 18 mg IR twice daily [BID] [exposures equivalent to 45 mg ER QD]) and three Phase 3 studies in RA (Studies M13-549, M13-542 and M15-555; 15 and 30 mg ER QD).
Results from the Phase 2b Induction Study M14-234 (Substudy 1) showed that 
upadacitinib plasma exposures associated with the [ADDRESS_442409] on laboratory parameters consistent with previous indications.
Preliminary exposure-response analyses for the Phase 2b Study M14-234 (Substudy 1) 
show that at Week 8, the percentage of subjects achieving clinical remission based on the Adapted Mayo Score (primary endpoint for Phase 3), clinical response, and the endoscopic endpoints (improvement and remission) increased with increasing upadacitinib plasma exposures.  With the exception of endoscopic remission, the plateau 
of key efficacy endpoints (clinical remission, clinical response, and endoscopic improvement) was established at Week 8 within the range of exposures evaluated in this study.  Simulations using exposure-response models indicate that the upadacitinib 45 mg QD regimen is predicted to maximize efficacy across efficacy endpoints and across bio-IR and non-bio-IR sub-populations after 8 weeks of induction treatment in subjects with UC. 
The selection of the induction dose in subjects with UC is also supported by [CONTACT_355296] 2 study in subjects with CD (Study M13-740), wherein the two highest upadacitinib doses evaluated were 12 mg IR BID and 24 mg IR BID (equivalent of 30 mg ER QD and 60 mg ER QD).  Simulations using the exposure 
Upadacitinib
M14-[ADDRESS_442410] 2016-000642-62
110
response models indicated that a dose higher than 45 mg ER QD (60 mg ER QD) would 
result in only a 1% to 2% incremental efficacy in terms of clinical response and remission endpoints, and 3% to 4% higher proportions for endoscopic response and remission, while simultaneously resulting in greater decreases in NK cells and increases in CPK.  Thus, the [ADDRESS_442411] no additional benefit for Adapted Mayo based clinical remission (primary endpoint) but can have incremental negative impact on laboratory parameters (e.g., NK cells).  A dose lower than 45 mg QD is predicted to provide lower efficacy across endpoints (~2% to 10% relative to 45 mg QD).

For adverse events to be considered intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and severity.  Adverse events, whether in response to a query, observed by [CONTACT_8786], or reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_41614].
All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
6.1.1 Definitions
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  Any worsening of a pre-existing condition or illness including UC is considered an adverse event.  Worsening in severity of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse event.  Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be adverse events only if they result in discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, [meets protocol specific criteria (see Section 6.1.7 regarding toxicity 
management)] and/or if the investigator considers them to be adverse events.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an 
adverse event if the surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre-existing condition and the surgery/procedure has been pre-planned prior to study entry.  However, if the 
Upadacitinib
M14-[ADDRESS_442415] 2016-000642-62
112
pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly during the study (e.g., surgery performed 
earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an adverse event.
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to [COMPANY_013] as a 
serious adverse event (SAE) within [ADDRESS_442416]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  This does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in fetal loss.
Persistent or Significant Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject.  Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively 
minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g.,sprained ankle).

require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life-threatening, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital 
anomaly, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity).  Additionally, any elective or spontaneous abortion or 
stillbirth is considered an important medical event.  Examples 
of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events of Special Interest
The following AEs of special interest will be monitored during the study (see detailed 
toxicity management in Section 6.1.7):
●Serious infections,
●Opportunistic infections;
●Herpes zoster;
●Active TB;
●Malignancy (all types);
●Adjudicated gastrointestinal perforations;
●Adjudicated cardiovascular events (e.g., major adverse cardiovascular event

●Renal dysfunction;
●Hepatic disorders;
●Elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK);
●Adjudicated embolic and thrombotic events (non-cardiac, non-central nervous

6.1.2 Adverse Event Severity
When criteria are available, events should be graded as described in the National Cancer 
Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03,
26which can be accessed at: 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm#ctc_40
If no grading criteria are provided for the reported event, then the event should be graded 
as mild, moderate, or severe per the investigator's judgment. 
Mild (Grade 1) Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.
Moderate (Grade 2) Minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) (instrumental ADL refers to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money, etc.).
Severe (Grade 3 - 5)
Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self-care ADL (self-care ADL refers to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden).
Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.
Grade 5 Death related to AE.
6.1.3 Relationship to Study Drug
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of study drug:
Upadacitinib
M14-[ADDRESS_442419] a causal relationship between the study drug and the adverse event.
For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being 
related to the study drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug will be considered "not associated."  In addition, when the investigator has not reported causality or deemed it not assessable, [COMPANY_013] will consider the event associated.

Information regarding a pregnancy occurrence in a study subject and the outcome of the pregnancy will be collected.
Pregnancy in a study subject is not considered an adverse event.  The medical outcome for 
either mother or infant, meeting any serious criteria including an elective or spontaneous abortion, is considered a serious adverse event and must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within [ADDRESS_442424] consists of safety 
monitoring (review of AEs on an ongoing basis, and periodic/ad hoc review of safety issues by [CONTACT_23275]), and if applicable interruption of study drug dosing with appropriate clinical management and/or discontinuation of the subjects from study drug.  The management of specific AEs and laboratory parameters is described below.
For subjects who discontinue study drug but continue study participation and are on 
standard of care therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], these toxicity management requirements do not apply (including alerts from the central laboratory) and any intolerability to standard of care therapi[INVESTIGATOR_355243].
Serious Infections:   Subjects should be closely monitored for the development of signs 
and symptoms of infection during and after treatment with study drug.  Study drug should 
be interrupted if a subject develops a serious infection.  A subject who develops a new infection during treatment with study drug should undergo prompt diagnostic testing appropriate for an immunocompromised subject.  As appropriate, antimicrobial therapy

drug (refer to "TB Testing/TB Prophylaxis" under Section [IP_ADDRESS]).
Herpes zoster: If a subject develops herpes zoster, consider temporarily interrupting 
study drug until the epi[INVESTIGATOR_176378].
Gastrointestinal Perforation:   Subjects presenting with the onset of signs or symptoms 
of a gastrointestinal perforation should be evaluated promptly for early diagnosis and 
treatment.  If the diagnosis of spontaneous gastrointestinal perforation is confirmed (other than appendicitis or mechanical injury), the subject must be permanently discontinued from study drug.
Cardiovascular Events:   Subjects presenting with potential cardiovascular events 
including non-cardiac, non-CNS thrombotic and embolic events should be carefully 
monitored.  These events will be reviewed and adjudicated by [CONTACT_176447] a blinded manner.
Malignancy and Gastrointestinal (GI) Dysplasia:   Subjects who develop malignancy 
other than nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) or carcinoma in situ of the cervix should be 
discontinued.  Subjects who develop high grade colonic dysplasia, should be discontinued.  Information including histopathological results should be queried for the confirmation of the diagnosis.  Periodic skin examination is recommended for subjects who are at increased risk for skin cancer. 
Thrombosis Events:  Subjects who develop symptoms of thrombosis should be promptly 
evaluated and treated appropriately.  If the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus or non-cardiac, non-neurologic arterial thrombosis is confirmed, the subject must be discontinued from study drug.

ECG Abnormality:   Subjects must be permanently discontinued from study drug for an 
ECG change considered clinically significant and with reasonable possibility of 
relationship to study drug.
Management of Select Laboratory Abnormalities:   For any given laboratory 
abnormality, the investigator should assess the subject, apply the standard of care for 
medical evaluation and treatment and follow any local guidelines.  Specific toxicity management guidelines for abnormal laboratory values are described in Table [ADDRESS_442427] 2016-000642-62

Hemoglobin !If hemoglobin < 8.0 g/dL interrupt study drug dosing and confirm by 
[CONTACT_111003].
!If hemoglobin decreases from Baseline ≥ 3.0 g/dL without an 
alternative etiology, interrupt study drug dosing and confirm by [CONTACT_111003].
!If hemoglobin decreases ≥ 3.0 g/dL from Baseline and an alternative 
etiology is known or the hemoglobin value remains in the normal reference range, the subject may remain on study drug at the investigator's discretion.
!If confirmed, continue to withhold study drug until hemoglobin value returns to normal reference range or its Baseline value.
Absolute neutrophil count (ANC)!If confirmed < 1000 cells/ μL by [CONTACT_111003], 
interrupt study drug dosing until ANC value returns to normal reference range or its Baseline value. 
!Interrupt study drug if confirmed < 500/μ L by [CONTACT_355297]. If value returns to normal reference range or its Baseline value, restarting study drug is allowed if there is an alternative etiology identified; documentation should include reason that rechallenge is expected to be safe for the subject. Study drug should be discontinued if no alternative etiology can be found.
Absolute lymphocyte count (ALC)!If confirmed < 500 cells/ μL by [CONTACT_111003], 
interrupt study drug dosing until ALC returns to normal reference range or its Baseline value.

!A positive result for HBV DNA PCR testing in these subjects will require immediate interruption of study drug (unless not acceptable by [CONTACT_111008]) and a hepatologist consultation should occur within one week for recommendation regarding subsequent treatment.
Subjects who meet any of the above criteria should be evaluated for an alternative etiology of the ALT or AST elevation and managed as medically appropriate.  If applicable, the alternative etiology should be documented in the eCRF.  If ALT or AST values return to the normal reference range or its Baseline value, study drug may be restarted.  If restarting study drug, documentation should include reason that rechallenge is expected to be safe.  If after clinically appropriate evaluation, no alternative etiology for ALT or AST elevation is found or the ALT or AST elevation has not resolved or is not trending down toward normal, the subject should be discontinued from study drug

An independent, external committee of physician experts in cardiac adjudication will be 
utilized to assess cardiovascular, embolic and thrombotic adverse events in a blinded manner as defined by [CONTACT_111011].
6.1.9 Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)
An external independent safety Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) comprised of persons 
independent of [COMPANY_013] and with relevant expertise in their field will review unblinded safety and if necessary, efficacy data from the ongoing studies.  The DMC members consist of two clinicians and one biostatistician, with one clinician being an expert in the 
Upadacitinib
M14-[ADDRESS_442431] of the study.  
Data for DMC review will be prepared by [CONTACT_26282] (for blinded data) and an independent 
CRO (Axio Research for unblinded data to DMC).  The DMC will review safety data at a minimum of 6-month intervals throughout the course of the study.  The DMC will determine if more frequent DMC meetings are required based on review of the accumulating safety data.  In addition, ad-hoc DMC meetings will be scheduled in the event of any significant safety concerns.  Based on these reviews, the DMC will make recommendations, as appropriate, regarding the conduct and management of the study.  DMC recommendations will be triaged by [CONTACT_355299] ([COMPANY_013] Study Management Team or Internal Review Committee).
Communications from the DMC to the Study Teams will not contain information that 
could potentially unblind the team to subject treatment assignments.

Complete, specific details of the statistical analyses will be described and fully 
documented in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  The SAP will be finalized prior to the database lock.
8.1.1 Datasets for Analysis 
[IP_ADDRESS] Intent-to-Treat Analysis Sets
The intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis set includes all randomized subjects who received at 
least one dose of double-blinded study drug from Part 1 (denoted as ITT1). The ITT analysis set that includes all subjects who received the open label upadacitinib induction of 45 mg QD in the Extended Treatment Period is denoted as ITT2.
For the ITT analysis sets, subjects are assigned to a treatment group based on the 
randomization schedule, regardless of the treatment actually received.  The efficacy analysis will be based on the corresponding ITT analysis set.
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Analysis Set
The safety analysis set consists of all subjects who received at least one dose of study 
medication in each part of the study, respectively.  For the safety analysis sets, subjects are assigned to a treatment group based on the treatment actually received, regardless the treatment randomized.  Safety analyses of the entire study will be carried out using the union of all safety analysis sets for all treated subjects.
8.1.[ADDRESS_442439] 
one dose of study drug, the number of subjects who completed the study, and the number of subjects who prematurely discontinued will be calculated overall and for each investigational site by [CONTACT_1570].
8.1.3 Definition of Missing Data Imputation
Missing data will be imputed using one or more of the following methods:
Upadacitinib
M14-[ADDRESS_442440] 2016-000642-62
129
Non-Responder Imputation (NRI):  In NRI analyses, subjects who prematurely 
discontinue the study prior to efficacy assessment at Week 8/Week [ADDRESS_442441] to the efficacy endpoint.
Observed Cases (OC):  The OC analysis will not impute values for missing evaluations, 
and thus a subject who does not have an evaluation on a scheduled visit will be excluded from the OC analysis for that visit.
Depending on the magnitude of missing data due to COVID-19, additional appropriate 
analysis of missing data may be performed with details included in the SAP.
The SFS and RBS at an assessment visit will be calculated as an average of the entries 
recorded into the subject's diary from the most recent consecutive 3-day period prior to each study visit.  If diary entries from the [ADDRESS_442442] diaries will be measured at the same time period as the SFS and RBS.
Subjects in whom UC-related corticosteroids are initiated during treatment (not taken at 
Baseline) or who have dosages of these medications increased to greater than the dose taken at Baseline will be considered a failure for categorical efficacy endpoints and will have the last values carried forward for non-categorical assessments from that time point through the end of the study.

[IP_ADDRESS] Baseline Characteristics
Summary statistics for continuous variables will include the number of observations, 
mean, standard deviation, median, and range for each treatment group.  For other categorical or discrete variables, frequencies and percentages will be computed in each category for each treatment group, as well as for all subjects combined.
[IP_ADDRESS] Medical Histories
Frequencies and relative frequencies (percentages) will also be computed for each 
treatment group for general medical history items.
[IP_ADDRESS] Prior Therapy and Medications
Prior therapy and medications will include all therapi[INVESTIGATOR_355245].  Prior therapy and medication will be summarized for the ITT analysis set.  No statistical test will be performed.
[IP_ADDRESS] Concomitant Medications
Concomitant drugs will be summarized for the ITT analysis set.  Concomitant drugs will 
be summarized using the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary with frequencies and percentages for each treatment group.  All medications administered between the date of the first dose of study drug and the date of the last dose of study drug, inclusive, (i.e., all medications starting or ongoing during the time interval) will be included.  Thus, all medications with an end date prior to the first study drug dose will be excluded from the summary table.  No statistical test will be performed.
A subject who reports two or more uses of the same concomitant medication will be 
counted only once within each generic name.  A subject with concomitant medications with more than one generic name [CONTACT_355320].

M14-[ADDRESS_442444] Disposition and Study Drug Exposure
[IP_ADDRESS] Subject Disposition
The number and percentage of subjects who are enrolled, randomized and received at 
least one dose of study drug, and the number of subjects who prematurely discontinued and the reason for early termination will be summarized by [CONTACT_355300].  Premature discontinuation of study drug will be summarized for each treatment group, as well as for all subjects combined, with frequencies and percentages overall and by [CONTACT_355301].  Subjects may have multiple reasons for prematurely discontinuing study drug but will be counted no more than once for the total ("Any Reason").
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Drug Exposure
Exposure to study drug will be summarized for all subjects who have received at least 
one dose of study drug for each part and over the entire study.  The duration (days) of study drug treatment will be summarized with the mean, standard deviation, median and range for each treatment group.  The duration of treatment is defined as the difference between the dates of the first and last doses of the treatment plus 1 day.  Study drug compliance will be summarized for each treatment group.  Compliance is defined as the number of tablets taken (i.e., the difference between the number of tablets dispensed and the number of tablets returned) divided by [CONTACT_310795] a subject is supposed to take each day times the length of time that the subject was in the Treatment Phase of the study (i.e., Final/Discontinuation Visit date during Treatment Phase – Day 1 [Baseline] Visit date + 1).  Subjects with missing data for the number of tablets returned will be excluded from the summary.

rate at significance level alpha = 0.05 (2-sided).  The details of the testing procedure will 
be specified and documented in the SAP.
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Efficacy Variables
The primary endpoint is the proportion of subjects who achieve clinical remission per 
Adapted Mayo score (defined as SFS ≤ 1 and not greater than baseline, RBS of 0, and 
endoscopic subscore ≤ 1.  Note:  evidence of friability during endoscopy in subjects with 
otherwise "mild" endoscopic activity will confer an endoscopic subscore of 2) at Week 8.
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Analysis of Primary Endpoint
The primary analysis will compare the subjects in upadacitinib treatment group and 
placebo group in the ITT1 analysis set.  The difference between the treatment groups in the primary efficacy endpoint will be assessed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test and will be stratified by [CONTACT_355302], baseline Adapted Mayo score (≤ 7 or > 7), and bio-IR status (yes or no).  The NRI method, where subjects with 
missing data at scheduled assessment visits will be considered as "not achieved" for the clinical remission, will be used for primary analysis.
Primary efficacy endpoint w ill be summarized descriptively for the ITT2 population. 
Subgroup (characterized by [CONTACT_355303]) analysis for the 
primary endpoint, clinical remission per Adapted Mayo Score, will be conducted.
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Efficacy Variables
All secondary efficacy variables are listed in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  
In general, continuous secondary efficacy variables with repeated measurements will be 
analyzed using a Mixed Effect Repeated Measure (MMRM) model.  Continuous secondary efficacy variables which are collected at only one post-baseline visit (such as Mayo score) will be analyzed using an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model.  Categorical secondary efficacy variables will be analyzed using the CMH test controlling 
Upadacitinib
M14-[ADDRESS_442446] 2016-000642-62

8.1.8 Safety Analysis
[IP_ADDRESS] General Considerations
Safety analyses will be carried out using the safety analysis sets, which includes all 
subjects who receive at least one dose of study medication in each part of the study.  Incidence of adverse events, including those related to study drug, changes in vital signs, physical examination results, ECGs, and clinical laboratory values will be analyzed.
Treatment-emergent adverse events will be tabulated by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and by 
[CONTACT_67503] (MedDRA) preferred term for each treatment group.  Mean change from Baseline for laboratory and vital signs data will be summarized.
Missing safety data will not be imputed.
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Adverse Events
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events
Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) dictionary.  Treatment-emergent adverse events, defined as AEs that began or worsened in severity after initiation of study drug in each period of the study, will be tabulated by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and MedDRA preferred term for each treatment group.
Adverse events starting more than [ADDRESS_442448] will be counted in the severity/relationship category of "unknown" even if the subject has a second occurrence of the same event with a severity/relationship present.  The only exception is if the subject has a second occurrence of the same event with the most extreme severity (i.e., "severe") or a relationship 
Upadacitinib
M14-[ADDRESS_442449] 2016-000642-62
135
categories of "reasonable possibility."  In this case, the subject will be counted under these 
most extreme severity/relationship categories.
Subjects reporting more than one AE for a given MedDRA preferred term will be counted 
only once for that term using the most severe incident in each study period.  Subjects reporting more than one type of event within an SOC will be counted only once for that SOC.
Frequencies and percentages of subjects with treatment-emergent AEs will be 
summarized for each treatment group as follows:
●Any event
●By [CONTACT_9313], and preferred term
●By [CONTACT_9313], preferred term and maximum relationship
●By [CONTACT_9313], preferred term and maximum severity
●Any event and by [CONTACT_355304]
●Any event and by [CONTACT_112796]
●Any event and by [CONTACT_112797]
●Any event and by [CONTACT_355305] a relationship of "reasonable possibility"
●Any event and by [CONTACT_355306] (serious infection, opportunistic infection, gastrointestinal 
perforations, malignancies, cardiovascular events [adjudicated events], drug-
related hepatic disorders, increased serum creatinine and renal dysfunction, and increased CPK)
All AEs leading to early termination of study drug will be presented in listing format.

All treatment-emergent serious adverse events, adverse events leading to death, and 
adverse events leading to discontinuation will also be presented in listing format.  In addition, SAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_355309].
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Laboratory and Vital Sign Data
Changes from Baseline to minimum value, maximum value and final values in continuous 
laboratory and vital sign parameters will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  Treatment group differences for mean changes from Baseline will be analyzed using ANOVA.
Vital signs and laboratory data will be described by [CONTACT_355310].  Frequencies and percentages of subjects with laboratory shifts from Baseline to the final values using normal ranges to define categories (low, normal, high, and missing) will be summarized by [CONTACT_355311].  Values beyond the normal values will be listed.  Low or high laboratory values will also be flagged in the data listings.  Analysis details will be specified in the SAP.

Data from this study may be combined with data from other studies for the population PK 
and exposure-response analyses.  Population PK and exposure-response analyses of only data from this study may not be conducted.  The following general methodology will be used for the population PK and exposure-response analyses.
Population PK analyses will be performed using the actual sampling time relative to 
dosing.  PK models will be built using a non-linear mixed-effects modeling approach with NONMEM software (Version 7, or a higher version).  The structure of the starting PK model will be based on the PK analysis of data from previous studies.  The CL/F and V/F of upadacitinib will be the PK parameters of major interest in the analyses.  If necessary, other parameters, including the parameters describing absorption characteristics, may be fixed if useful in the analysis.
The evaluation criteria described below will be used to examine the performance of 
different models.
●The objective function of the best model is significantly smaller than the 
alternative model(s).
●The observed and predicted concentrations from the preferred model are more 
randomly distributed across the line of unity (a straight line with zero intercept 
and a slope of one) than the alternative model(s).
●Visual inspection of model fits, standard errors of model parameters, and 
change in inter-subject and intra-subject error.
Once an appropriate base PK model (including inter- and intra-subject error structure) is 
developed, empi[INVESTIGATOR_355246]-linear mixed-effects modeling.  The relationship between these conditional estimates CL/F and V/F values with only potentially physiologically relevant or clinically meaningful covariates (such as subject age, sex, body weight, concomitant medications, laboratory markers of hepatic of renal function, etc.) will be explored using stepwise forward selection method, or another suitable regression/smoothing method at a significance level of 0.05.  After 
Upadacitinib
M14-[ADDRESS_442452] elimination of covariates 
from the full model will be employed to evaluate the significance (at P< 0.005, 
corresponding to a decrease in objective function > 7.88 for one degree of freedom) of each covariate in the full model.
Linear or non-linear relationships of primary PK parameters with various covariates will 
be explored.
Relationships between upadacitinib exposure and clinical observations (primary efficacy 
variable) will be explored.  Exposure-response relationships for secondary efficacy variables and/or some safety measures of interest may also be explored.  The relationship between exposure (e.g., population PK model predicted average concentrations, area under the curve, trough concentrations, the individual model-predicted PK profiles, or some other appropriate measure of exposure) and drug effect will be explored.  Several classes of models (e.g., linear, log-linear, exponential, E
max, sigmoid E max, etc.) will be 
evaluated to characterize the exposure-response relationship based on observed data.  Results of the PK and exposure-response analyses may be summarized in a separate report prior to regulatory filing of upadacitinib for the treatment of UC, rather than in the CSR.
Additional analyses will be performed if useful and appropriate.
8.2 Determination of Sample Size
For Study M14-675 (Part 1), a total of 462 subjects will be allocated to upadacitinib 
treatment group or placebo in a randomization ratio of 2:1.  The sample size for this study is based on the expected proportion of subjects who achieve clinical remission per Adapted Mayo score at Week 8.  Assuming clinical remission rate of 5% in the placebo arm and 18% of the upadacitinib QD treatment arms at Week 8, a sample size of [ADDRESS_442453] > 95% power to detect the 13% treatment difference in the primary endpoint between an upadacitinib 45 mg QD and placebo using two-sided Fisher's exact test at a 0.[ADDRESS_442454] 2016-000642-62

Information regarding incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions for 
treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the study can be found in the informed consent form.
Samples for exploratory research/validation studies will only be collected if the subject 
has voluntarily signed and dated the consent for exploratory research/validation studies, approved by [CONTACT_2717]/IEC, after the nature of the testing has been explained and the subject has had an opportunity to ask questions.  The written consent must be signed before the exploratory research/validation studies samples are collected and testing is performed.  If the subject does not consent to the exploratory research/validation studies, it will not impact the subject's participation in the study.
For adolescent subjects, the investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of 
the study and optional exploratory research samples to the subject and the subject's parent/legal guardian and answer all questions regarding this study. Adolescent subjects will be included in all discussions in order to obtain verbal or written assent. Prior to any study-related screening procedures being performed on the subject, the informed consent statement will be reviewed and signed and dated by [CONTACT_423]'s parent/legal guardian, the person who administered the informed consent, and any other signatories according to local requirements. Additionally, in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_355247]'s IRB/IEC requirements, an informed assent form may also be obtained by [CONTACT_355312]-related procedures being performed. If a subject becomes of legal age during the course of the study, that subject will need to be re-consented. A copy of the informed consent form and the assent form will be given to the subject and the subject's parent/legal guardian and the original will be placed in the subject's medical record. An entry must also be made in the subject's dated source documents to confirm that informed consent was obtained prior to any study-related procedures and that the subject received a signed copy.
In the event a subject withdraws from the main study, optional exploratory 
research/validation studies samples will continue to be stored and analyzed unless the subject specifically withdraws consent for research involving these optional samples.  If 
Upadacitinib
M14-[ADDRESS_442460] withdraws his/her consent and the samples have already been tested, those results will still remain as part of the overall research data.
Due to the COVID-[ADDRESS_442461]'s consent to participate in the study with the cooperation of the sponsor and will revise these documents as required.  The prepared or revised consent forms and explanatory material will be submitted to the sponsor.  Approval of the IRB will be obtained prior to use in the study.
9.3.[ADDRESS_442462]'s consent becomes 
available, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_94469].  The investigator will provide the information, without delay, to each subject already participating in the study, and will confirm the intention of each subject to continue the study or not.  The investigator shall also provide a further explanation using the revised form and explanatory material and shall obtain written consent from each subject of their own free will to continue participating in the study.

10.1 Source Documents
Source documents are defined as original documents, data and records.  This may include 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory data/information, subjects' diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing and other records, recorded data from automated instruments, microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, and/or x-rays.  Data collected during this study must be recorded to the appropriate source document.  The Investigator Awareness Date (SAE CRF) may serve as the source for this data point.  This adverse event data point required for eCRF completion can be entered directly in the eCRF.
The investigator(s)/institution(s) will permit study-related monitoring, audits, IEC/IRB 
review, and regulatory inspection(s), providing direct access to source data documents.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, remote monitoring of data may be employed if allowed 
by [CONTACT_17196], IRB/IEC, and the study site.
10.2 Case Report Forms
Case report forms (CRF) must be completed for each subject screened/enrolled in this 
study.  These forms will be used to transmit information collected during the study to [COMPANY_013] and regulatory authorities, as applicable.  The CRF data for this study are being collected with an electronic data capture (EDC) system called RAVE
®provided by [CONTACT_26298], NY, [LOCATION_003].  The EDC system and the study-specific electronic case report forms (eCRFs) will comply with Title [ADDRESS_442464] data in his/her own subject files.  These subject 
files will serve as source data for the study.  All eCRF data required by [CONTACT_355313]

144
be recorded by [CONTACT_355314].  All data entered into the 
eCRF will be supported by [CONTACT_26300].
The investigator or an authorized member of the investigator's staff will make any 
necessary corrections to the eCRF.  All change information, including the date and person performing the corrections, will be available via the audit trail, which is part of the EDC system.  For any correction, a reason for the alteration will be provided.  The eCRFs will be reviewed periodically for completeness, legibility, and acceptability by [CONTACT_26301] (or their representatives).  [COMPANY_013] (or their representatives) will also be allowed access to all source documents pertinent to the study in order to verify eCRF entries.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_26186].
Medidata will provide access to the EDC system for the duration of the trial through a 
password-protected method of internet access.  Such access will be removed from investigator sites at the end of the site's participation in the study.  Data from the EDC system will be archived on appropriate data media (CD-ROM, etc.) and provided to the investigator at that time as a durable record of the site's eCRF data.  It will be possible for the investigator to make paper printouts from that media.
10.3 Electronic Patient Reported Outcomes (ePRO)
Patient reported data must be completed for each subject screened/enrolled in this study.  
Some of these data are being collected with an Electronic Patient Reported Outcome (ePRO) system called Trialmax, provided by [CONTACT_51071], PA, [LOCATION_003].  The ePRO system is in compliance with Title [ADDRESS_442466] will be entering the data on an electronic device; these data will be uploaded 
to a server.  The data on the server will be considered source and maintained and managed by [CONTACT_51070].
Internet access to the ePRO data will be provided by [CONTACT_176469].  This access will be available for the duration of the trial to the site investigator, as well as delegated personnel.  Such access will be removed from investigator sites following the receipt of the study archive.  Data from the ePRO system will be archived on appropriate data media (CD-ROM, etc.) and provided to the investigator at that time as a durable record of the site's ePRO data.  It will be possible for the investigator to make paper print-outs from that media. 
The ePRO data (IBDQ, Short Form 36 (SF-36), PGIC, PGIS, FACIT-F, WPAI, 
EQ-5D-5L, UC-SQ) will be collected electronically via an onsite device at visits specified in Appendix C and Appendix E.  Stool information, abdominal pain, bowel urgency, use 
of anti-diarrheals and endoscopy prep will be collected electronically via a handheld device provided to the subject.  The electronic device will be programmed to allow data entry once per day.  All data entered on the device will be immediately stored to the device itself and manually/automatically uploaded to a central server administrated by [CONTACT_51070].  The investigator and delegated staff, will be able to access all uploaded patient entered data via a password protected website, up until the generation, receipt and confirmation of the study archive.

M14-[ADDRESS_442479] dose of study drug, the allowable visit window is dependent upon what phase of the study the subjec t was at when discontinuing study drug. During 
Part 1 and 2 of the induction period a + 3 day window ([ADDRESS_442480] study drug date) is allowed.
f. Update inclusion/exclusion, medical/surgical history information, and prior and concomitant therapy to assure subject eligibi lity.
g. In Part 1, Physical examinations performed at Screening, Baseline, Week 8/PD and Part 2 at Week 16/PD Visits are full physica l examinations which must include an 
assessment of extra-intestinal manifestations (EIMs).  Physical exams at all other visits are symptom-based as necessary.  Asse ssment of EIMs are required at every visit.  For 
subjects 16 or 17 years of age a Tanner Stage check is to be completed during the physical examination at the screening visit, this may be completed by [CONTACT_355315]-assessment (completed by [CONTACT_423]/legally authorized representative) per local requirements.
h. Height (with shoes off) will be measured at Screening only for subjects ≥ 18 years of age.  For Subjects 16 or 17 years of age, where locally permitted, height (with shoes off) 
will be measured at screening, Week 8 and Week 16.
i. Subjects will undergo a full colonoscopy with biopsy for histologic assessment during Screening, and a full colonoscopy or fl exible sigmoidoscopy, depending on the extent 
of disease at Screening, at Week 8.  For subjects in Part 2 (Extended Treatment Period), an endoscopy will be performed at Week  16, for this a flexible sigmoidoscopy is 
recommended, however the use of flexible rectosigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy will be based on the investigator's discretion per l ocal practice.  
j. Appropriate documentation of biopsy results consistent with the diagnosis of UC, in the assessment of the investigator, must be available in order to confirm the subject's 
eligibility for the study.  If this documentation is not available a diagnostic biopsy from the most affected observed area of the colon must be performed during the Screening 
endoscopy and evaluated by a qualified local pathologist and the results reviewed by [CONTACT_093].  Biopsies to rule out current dysplasia and colon cancer may be taken 
during any study endoscopy per the investigator's discretion and evaluated by [CONTACT_165495].  During all endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014], up  to 3 sets of biopsies will be taken (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] for details about biopsy sampling).
k. Subjects with normal ECG within 90 days of Screening will not require a repeat ECG, if documentation is available.  The Week 8 ECG will serve as the Baseline ECG for 
Part 2 (Extended Treatment Period), as applicable or for Baseline of Study M14-234 Substudy 3.  For subjects who enter Part 2 ( Extended Treatment Period), Week [ADDRESS_442481] x-ray includes posterior-anterior [PA] and lateral views.  Subjects with normal chest x-ray within [ADDRESS_442482] may be performed in lieu of a CXR, at investigator's discretion.
m. If a subject had a negative QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus test within [ADDRESS_442483]'s medical history to warrant a repeat test.  [COMPANY_003] skin test is only to be used if th e site is unable to perform the QuantiFERON-TB 
Gold Plus testing and is to be read [ADDRESS_442484] 2016-000642-62

o. During screening, biologic drug levels may be optionally assessed at the investigator's discretion as an alternative to comple ting the required washout period:  (1) infliximib 
and natalizumab:  may be tested approximately [ADDRESS_442485] dose; (2) adalimumab, certolizumab, golimumab, or vedolizumb:  may be tested approximately 
[ADDRESS_442486] does; (3) ustekinumab:  may be tested approximately [ADDRESS_442487] dose.
p. The Central Laboratory will perform the urinalysis macro and micro (if applicable).  A microscopic analysis will be performed  by [CONTACT_2237], in the event the 
dipstick results show leukocytes, nitrite, ketone, protein, blood, or glucose value of greater than a trace.  Sites will not be  provided with urinalysis dipsticks.
q. A serum pregnancy test will be performed on all women of childbearing potential at Screening.  In Part 1, a urine pregnancy t est will be performed at the site at Baseline and 
at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8 and PD Visits.  In Part 2 (Extended Treatment Period), a urine pregnancy test it will be done at Weeks 10, 12, [ADDRESS_442488] be reported to [COMPANY_013] as outlined in Sec tion 6.1.6 .
r. Subjects will be tested for the presence of the hepatitis B and C virus (HBV and HCV) at Screening.  A positive result for th e hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs Ag) or 
hepatitis C (HCV RNA detectable for any subject with positive anti-HCV AB) will be exclusionary.  For subjects who are negative for HBsAg but positive for core antibody 
(HBcAb), HBV DNA PCR will be performed and any result that meets or exceeds detection sensitivity will be exclusionary.  HBV te sting is done every 12 weeks where 
required.
s. For Japan subjects only:  Subjects with positive HBs Ab and/or positive HBc Ab results at Screening should have HBV-DNA PCR t est performed at Week 8 in the induction 
period; in cases where recurrence of HBV-DNA is observed, the subject should be discontinued from the study.  This measure is n ot necessary in patients with history of 
HBV vaccination and positive HBs Ab result.
t. Stool sample will be collected at each time point indicated.  For the visit that an endoscopy will be conducted, stool sample  should be collected prior to the endoscopy.  If a 
sample cannot be obtained during the site visit, the site will give instructions and a stool sample supply kit (supplies will be  provided at the time-points indicated).  All stool 
samples should be collected before any bowel preparation for endoscopy is started and should be returned to the site within 3 d ays of collection.  Stool sample supply kit to be 
provided at Week 8 visit for subjects entering into the extended treatment program.
u. Reference Section [IP_ADDRESS] regarding PK sample collection.  The PK sample at Week [ADDRESS_442489] discontinues before the Week 8 visit, it is not relevant for su bjects discontinuing during Part 2.
v. Blood samples will be collected at the visits indicated and will be utilized to assess effects of upadacitinib inhibition on c ertain lymphocyte subsets, including T (CD4+ and 
CD8+) cells, B (CD19+) cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and natural killer-T (NKT) cells.

Appendix E. Patient Reported Outcomes Descriptions in Upadacitinib
(ABT-494) UC Programs 
IBDQ – Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire
The IBDQ is a disease-specific instrument composed of 32 Likert-scaled items.  The total 
score ranges from 32 to 224 using the 7-point response options, with higher scores indicating better health-related quality of life.  The IBDQ scale contains 4 component subscales:  bowel symptoms, systemic symptoms, emotional function, and social function.  Each subscale can be computed with total scores ranging from 10 to 70, 5 to 35, 12 to 84, and 5 to 35, respectively.
27,28
SF-36 – Short Form 36
The SF-36 questionnaire is a self-administered multi-domain scale with 36 items.  
Eight subscales cover a range of functioning:  physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health.  The scoring yields a physical component score, a mental component summary score, and subscale scores.  Higher scores represent better outcomes.  The concepts measured by [CONTACT_20763]-36 are not specific to any age, disease, or treatment group, allowing comparison of relative burden of different diseases and the benefit of different treatments.
29,30
EQ-5D-5L – European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 5 Levels
The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized non-disease specific instrument for describing and 
valuing health-related quality of life.  The EQ-5D-5L consists of 5 dimensions:  mobility, 
self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression.  Each dimension has 5 levels:  no problem, slight problem, moderate problem, severe problem or unable to do the activity.  It also contains a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).  Subjects are asked to indicate the level that describes their current level of function or experience for each dimension.  As a measure of health status, it provides a descriptive profile and can be used to generate a single index value for health status, where full health is equal to [ADDRESS_442494]'s assessment of his/her own health along a vertical [ADDRESS_442495] 2016-000642-62
168
PGIC – Patient Global Impression of Change
The PGIC is a self-administered instrument that assesses change in the overall symptoms 
due to ulcerative colitis.  The PGIC is one item in which subjects are asked to rate overall improvement since start of the treatment.  Subjects rate their change as "Very much improved," "Much improved," "Minimally improve d," "No change," "Minimally worse," 
"Much worse" and "Very much worse."
PGIS - Patient Global Impression of Severity
The PGIS is a self-administered instrument that assesses the severity of the overall 
symptoms due to ulcerative colitis.  The PGIS is one item in which subjects are asked to rate overall severity of symptoms over the past week.  Subjects rate their change as "Absent," "Minimal," "Mild," "Moderate," "Moderately severe," "Severe" and "Very severe."
FACIT-F – Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue
The FACIT system is a collection of quality of life (QOL) questionnaires targeted to the 
management of cancer and other chronic illnesses.  The FACIT fatigue (FACIT-F) questionnaire was developed to assess fatigue associated with anemia.  It consists of 13 fatigue-related questions. The responses to the 13 items on the FACIT fatigue 
questionnaire are each measured on a 4-point Likert scale. The responses to the answers are the following: (i) not at all: 0 points; (ii) a little bit: 1 point; (iii) somewhat:  2 points; (iv) quite a bit:  3 points; (v) very much:  4 points.  Thus, the total score ranges from 0 to 52.  High scores represent less fatigue.
32
WPAI – Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire Ulcerative 
Colitis
The Work Productivity and Activity Index assesses the impact of the condition on work 
productivity losses and impairment in daily activity.  WPAI has six items covering four domains:  (1) Absenteeism (work time missed), measured as the number of hours missed from work in the past [ADDRESS_442496] 2016-000642-62
169
expressed as impairment percentages, adjusting for hours actually worked according to 
the WPAI scoring algorithm; (2) Presenteeism (impairment at work/reduced on-the-job effectiveness), measured as the impact of the condition on productivity while at work (i.e., reduced amount or kind of work, or not as focused as usual).  Responses are recorded on a 0 – 10 Likert scale (where, 0 = no effect of UC on work and 10 = severe impact of UC while at work); (3) Productivity loss (overall work impairment), measured as the sum of hours missed due to condition i.e., absenteeism and number of hours worked with impairment i.e., product of number of hours worked and presenteeism; and (4) Activity impairment (i.e., activities other than paid work like work around house, cleaning, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007], traveling, studying), recorded and scored in the same way as presenteeism.  Higher numbers indicate greater impairment and less productivity.
33
UC-SQ – Ulcerative Colitis Symptoms Questionnaire
The Ulcerative Colitis Symptoms Questionnaire (UC-SQ) is a UC-specific instrument 
composed of 17 items.  UC-SQ was developed to assess UC related gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., frequent bowel movements, abdominal pain, crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) and non-gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., joint pain and sleep difficulties).  Each symptom item 1 -9 can be responded on Likert-type of options such as (i) Not at all:  0 points; (ii) A little bit:  1 point; (iii) Somewhat:  2 points; (iv) Quite a bit:  3 points; (v) Very much:  4 points.  Each symptom item 10 - 17 can be responded on Likert-type of options such as (i) Never:  0 points; (ii) Rarely:  1 point; (iii) Sometimes:  2 points; (iv) Often:  3 points; (v) Always:  4 points.  Overall symptom scores are calculated by [CONTACT_355316], with higher scores indicating greater severity.

Appendix F. Mayo Scoring System for Assessment of Ulcerative Colitis Activity
The Mayo Scores range from 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating more severe disease.  
It consists of 4 subscores.  Each sub-score ranges from 0 to 3.  The 4 components of the Mayo Score are:  
Stool Frequency: 
0 = Normal number of stools for this subject 
1 = 1 – 2 stools more than normal 
2 = 3 – 4 stools more than normal 3 = 5 or more stools more than normal 
Rectal Bleeding:
0 = No blood seen 
1 = Streaks of blood with stool less than half the time 
2 = Obvious blood with stool most of the time 3 = Blood alone passed 
Findings on Endoscopy:0 = Normal or inactive disease 1 = Mild disease (erythema, decreased vascular pattern) 
2 = Moderate disease (marked erythema, lack of vascular pattern, any friability, erosions) 
3 = Severe disease (spontaneous bleeding, ulceration)
Physician's Global Assessment:0 = Normal1 = Mild disease
2 = Moderate disease 
3  = Severe disease
Note: In Study M14-675, evidence of friability during endoscopy in subjects with otherwise "mild" endoscopic 
activity will confer an endoscopic subscore of 2.

of disease at Screening, at Week 8.  For subjects in Part 2 (Extended Treatment Period), an endoscopy will be performed at Week  16, for this a flexible sigmoidoscopy is 
recommended, however the use of flexible rectosigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy will be based on the investigator's discretion per l ocal practice.  
j. Appropriate documentation of biopsy results consistent with the diagnosis of UC, in the assessment of the investigator, must be available in order to confirm the subject's 
eligibility for the study.  If this documentation is not available a diagnostic biopsy from the most affected observed area of the colon must be performed during the Screening 
endoscopy and evaluated by a qualified local pathologist and the results reviewed by [CONTACT_093].  Biopsies to rule out cu rrent dysplasia and colon cancer may be taken 
during any study endoscopy per the investigator's discretion and evaluated by [CONTACT_165495].  During all endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014], u p to 3 sets of biopsies will be taken (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] for details about biopsy sampling).

hepatitis C (HCV RNA detectable for any subject with positive anti-HCV AB) will be exclusionary.  For subjects who are negative for HBsAg but positive for core antibody 
(HBcAb), HBV DNA PCR will be performed and any result that meets or exceeds detection sensitivity will be exclusionary.  HBV te sting is done every 12 weeks where 
required.
s. For Japan subjects only:  Subjects with positive HBs Ab and/or positive HBc Ab results at Screening should have HBV-DNA PCR t est performed at Week 8 in the induction 
period; in cases where recurrence of HBV-DNA is observed, the subject should be discontinued from the study.  This measure is not necessary in patients with history of 
HBV vaccination and positive HBs Ab result.
t. Stool sample will be collected at each time point indicated.  For the visit that an endoscopy will be conducted, stool sample  should be collected prior to the endoscopy.  If a 
sample cannot be obtained during the site visit, the site will give instructions and a stool sample supply kit (supplies will be  provided at the time-points indicated).  All stool 
samples should be collected before any bowel preparation for endoscopy is started and should be returned to the site within 3 days of collection.  Stool sample supply kit to be 
provided at Week 8 visit for subjects entering into the extended treatment program.
u. Reference Section [IP_ADDRESS] regarding PK sample collection.  The PK sample at Week [ADDRESS_442554] discontinues before the Week 8 visit, it is not relevant for su bjects discontinuing during Part 2.

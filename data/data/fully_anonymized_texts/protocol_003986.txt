1. Abstract  
a. Provide no more than a one page  research abstract brief ly stating the problem, the 
research hypothesis, and the importance of the research.  
 
Title: Evaluation of a novel absorbable radiopaque hydrogel in patients undergoing image -
guided radiotherapy for borderline resectable and locally advanced pancreatic ade nocarcinoma  
 
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is now the third leading cause of cancer -related death, with a 
devastating 5 -year overall survival (OS) rate of nearly 8%, despi[INVESTIGATOR_44568] 12th most 
common incidence of all malignancies in the [LOCATION_002] [1]. One -third of patients will 
present with borderline resectable or unresectable, locally advanced pancreatic cancer 
(BR/LAPC ) [2-5]. In the cases of LAPC, chemotherapy  with or without radiation may be 
recommended to improve the  quality  of life by [CONTACT_44576] [6-
11]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_44569], the median survival remains between 9 and 
15 m onths [12,13] . 
 
Current guidelines for the management of BR/LAPC patients include single - or multi -agent 
chemotherapy or chemoradiation (CRT) in sequence with chemotherapy [14]. Results of studies 
comparing chemotherapy alone to CRT for patients with BR/LAPC are mixed [6,9,12,15] .  The 
importance of local control or delaying local progression on improving morbidity and possibly 
mortality in patien ts with pancreatic cancer is supported by [CONTACT_44577] 
30% of patients die of locally destructive disease [16]. It follows that in the cases of LAPC, 
advanced radiation therapy techniques using dose -escalation with intensity modulated 
radiotherapy (IMRT) and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) are potential strategies to 
improv e local control.  
 
A consistent challenge to dose -escalation with IMRT or SBRT is the sensitivity of the 
surrounding gastrointestinal organs, particularly the small bowel which is directly adjacent to 
the head of the pancreas (HOP). For BR/LAPC patients tr eated with CRT, advances in image 
guidance have provided the opportunity to safely deliver higher biologically effective doses of 
radiation therapy using IMRT of >70 Gy (57.25 Gy in 25 fractions, BED 70.36 Gy) compared

[ADDRESS_46844] fractionation regimens (5 0.40 Gy in 28 fractions or 50 Gy in 25 fractions, BED 
59.47 Gy and 60 Gy, respectively) [17].  Those patients who underwent dose -escalated CRT 
with BED>[ADDRESS_46845] a superior OS compared to those receiving BED<70 Gy, supporting 
the utility of dose -escalation in improving long -term outcomes. SBRT involves a short course of 
radiation therapy, five fractions or less, and has demonstrated higher rates of local co ntrol 
compared to CRT in other disease sites [18]. Early studies evaluating SBRT for pancreatic 
cancer utilized single fractions of 25 Gy, resulti ng in local control rates of 100% at 1 year but 
unacceptably high rates of gastrointestinal toxicity [19-22]. More recently, hypofractionated  
SBRT (33 Gy total, 6.6 Gy daily fractions) has been  evaluated and utilized by [CONTACT_44578], with results demonstrating nearly 80% rate of freedom 
from local progression at one year and an acceptable 11% long -term gastrointestinal toxicity 
[23]. Outcomes with SBRT are thus promising; however, higher local control rates with dose -
escalation may be achievable, but current practice is limited due  to risks of toxicity.  
 
The goal of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_44570] (EUS) guided 
injection of TraceIT to  mark the interface between the pancreas and duodenum  in patients with 
a pathologically  confirmed diagnosis of BR/LAPC pancreatic adenocarcinoma for whom a 
course of SBRT is indicated . TraceIT is already an FDA approved absorbable tissue marker , 
however , it has not yet been injected into the region between the pancreas and duodenum in 
humans . As this is the first in -human experience to attempt to use the hydrogel tissue marker to 
localize this important boundary, a clinical trial is warranted to investigate the success of this 
procedure.  This study will thus set the stage for a planned futur e investigation using the 
TraceIT Tissue Marker as an organ spacing material (AGX -17-001-US) by [CONTACT_44579] a larger 
volume of the hydrogel to displace the duodenum away from the pancreas to reduce risk of 
duodenum toxicity give the increased distance betwee n the target and the duodenum and with 
the use of imaging localization ..  
 
 
2. Objectives (include all primary and secondary objectives)  
 
Primary Objective:   
To evaluate the success of marking the interface between the pancreas and duodenum with 
TraceIT Tissu e Marker  via EUS  in patients undergoing image -guided radiotherapy for BR/LAPC 
pancreatic adenocarcinoma.  
 
Secondary Objectives:  
 
1) To assess the visibility of TraceIT on daily cone beam CT acquired as standard of care 
for image -guided radiation therapy.  
 
 
2) To examine the hydrogel injection sites for implant location and presence of local 
inflammatory reactions as a result of TraceIT placement in patients who proceed to 
surgical resection.

3. Background (briefly describe pre -clinical and clinical data, current experience with 
procedures, drug or device, and any other relevant information to justify the research)  
 
Pre-clinical: Our preclinical study on human cadavers was done in September 2016.  Using three 
human cadaveric specimens, TraceIT Tissue Marker  was injected between the HOP and 
duodenum via open laparotomy in one case and endoscopic -ultrasound (EUS) guidance in two 
cases. Cadavers were subsequently imaged using CT and dissected for histologic confirmation of 
hydrogel placement. Compared to pre -injection scans, post -injection axial CT demonstrated 
successful injection of the radiopaque hydrogel as a contrast -enhancing region between the HOP 
and duodenum. After injection, a pancreatic surgeon dissected each cadaveric specimen by 
[CONTACT_44580] -bloc resection of the pancreas and the duodenum, preserving the injection site 
for histologic examination. The tissue was serially sectioned to grossly visualize the injection 
cavity and sections were then formalin -fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) and stained with 
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for microscopic examination of gel placement. Microscopic 
examination of the FFPE sections following H&E staining revealed a complete  separation of the 
full duodenal mucosa from the pancreatic tissue in most regions without  injection into the 
muscularis  propia  (Rao et al., IJROBP, 2017) .  
 
We have also conducted two distinct preclinical studies on swine animals. The first study 
assessed for toxicities of direct injection of TraceIT into the pancreas or wall of the duodenum. 
These studies did not reveal any incidence of pancreatitis or evidence of necrosis of the 
duodenum by [CONTACT_44581] “worse -case” mis -injections of TraceIT when targeting 
this interface between the HOP and duodenum. In a second porcine study, we were able to 
demonstrate successful placement of TraceIT via EUS in [ADDRESS_46846] (CBCT) demonstrated adequate visibility of the injected 
TraceIT  highlighting the potential utility of TraceIT injection to facilitate visualizing this HOP -
duodenum interface on daily image guidance with CBCT.  
 
Clinical: TraceIT Tissue Marker has several publications for marking purposes demonstrating its 
stability in  the esophagus [24], bladder [25], and cervix [26]. Given the unique enzymatic and 
mobile enviro nment in the peripancreatic region, distinct investigation of the injection in the 
pancreas -duodenum space is necessary.

image -guidance using cone beam CT technology for alignment and will be monitored for 
radiation toxicity . There will be no additional radiation exposure to the patient to evaluate 
TraceIT. Following completion of SBRT, patients will proceed with routine standard of care 
follow -up.  
 
If a patient on study undergoes successful surgical resection, the hydrogel in jection sites between 
pancreas and duodenum will be examined for implant location and to identify a ny local 
inflammatory reactions.   
 
b. Study duration and number of study visits required of research participants.  
 
The TraceIT injection will be performed dur ing the endoscopic fiducial placement which is the 
standard of care. Therefore, there will be no additional study visits needed by [CONTACT_44583].  
 
c. Blinding, including justification for blinding  or not blinding the trial, if applicabl e.

c. Justification and safety information if non -FDA approved drugs without an IND will 
be administered.  
 
N/a 
 
3. Study Statistics  
a. Primary outcome variable:  
The success of injecting TraceIT using EUS  for guidance will be assessed on post -
injection simulation CT scan and determined as successful if TraceIT hydrogel is 
visible between the pancreatic tumor and duodenum on axial CT.  
 
b. Secondary outcome variables:  
1) Visibility of TraceIT on daily cone beam CT acquired as standard of care for 
image -guided radiation therapy, defined as no visibility, poor visibility, or 
acceptable visibility by [CONTACT_44585].

analyzed grossly and on histopathologic specimen sections for TraceIT 
placement location and inflammation surrounding placement site.  
 
c. Statistical plan including sample size justification and interim data  analysis.   
 
No formal hypothesis or sample size estimation has been established since this is an early 
feasibility study with an intent to collect information concerning the procedural 
characteristics and safety for TraceIT administration within the peri -duodenal space. Six 
(6) subjects should provide sufficient experience to assess the success of the procedure to 
result in injecting of the hydrogel marker in the desired location.

Potential Risk Associated with the TraceIT Hydrogel Material  (RESEARCH)  
There may be side effects and discomforts that are not yet known.  
 
b. Steps taken  to minimize the risks:  
 
The risks associated with EUS procedures and fiducial marker/TraceIT administrat ion will be 
minimized via selection of experienced investigators who are skilled in EUS/transduodenal 
fiducial placement procedures.  Additionally, participating gastroenterologist has prior 
experience with placement of the TraceIT hydrogel in human cadave rs. Subjects will be selected 
and enrolled using clearly defined inclusion and exclusion criteria to ensure the best possible 
treatment outcome.  Additionally, subjects will receive full and careful follow -up.  
 
The TraceIT hydrogel,  is FDA cleared for use  as a Tissue Marker and is specifically indicated 
for use to radiographically mark soft tissue during a surgical procedure or for future surgical 
procedures.  The risks associated with the TraceIT hydrogel have been minimized by [CONTACT_44587] a long history of safe use in implantable medical 
devices.  The study sponsor conducted Biocompatibility testing in compliance with FDA’s Good 
Laboratory Practices regulation and in accordance with ISO [ZIP_CODE] – Biological Evaluatio n of 
Medical Devices.  Tests were selected and performed according to the type of device, intended 
use, and degree and duration of tissue contact.  The response to TraceIT hydrogel was evaluated 
in healthy tissues including subcutaneous and intramuscular i mplant locations.  All 
biocompatibility testing results are consistent with a biocompatible material.  
 
Preclinical studies were also done to evaluate the response to TraceIT hydrogel when placed in 
the pancreatic parenchyma and duodenal wall.  No adverse h istologic change or safety concerns 
were noted.   Likely  N/A 
Less Likely   Minor bleeding  
 Pain 
Unlikely   Infection of the blood or other organs  Clogging nearby [CONTACT_44588]  
 Inflammation of the pancreas or surrounding organs causing 
pain or discomfort  
 Dislodgement of the TraceIT resulting in tracking to another 
site 
 Improper placement of TraceIT into neighboring structures  
(e.g., duodenal wall)  
 Foreign body reaction to TraceIT  
 Delay in starting radiation therapy or surgery  
Rare but serious   Potential to worsen  local progression of the cancer due to 
undiagnosed/microscopic invasion into the duodenum

[ADDRESS_46854] medical practices will be used in the event of 
medical complications.  
 
c. Plan for reporting unanticipat ed problems or study deviations:  
 
The principal  investigator [INVESTIGATOR_44573]. These include the 
Johns Hopkins Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Committee, and the Johns 
Hopkins M edical Institutional Review Board (JHM -IRB) of The Johns Hopkins Medical 
Institutions. The required reporting time period is 3 days for fatal events, and 10 days for all 
other events.  
  
d. Legal risks such as the risks that would be associated with breach of confidentiality:  
 
While data will be stored data in securely  locked files (computer files will be password 
protected and any paper records will be stored in the research office at Johns Hopkins under 
lock and key) in which only the research team has acces s, there is always the risk that 
confidentiality will be lost.  
 
e. Financial risks to the participants: None  
 
5. Benefits  
a. Description of the probable benefits for the participant and for society:  
 
The tissue interface between pancreas and duodenum can be potent ially marked using this 
radiopaque hydrogel. There is no benefit to the patient from participation in the study.  Potential 
benefits to society include those to future patients undergoing SBRT treatments, who may 
receive improved treatment as a direct resu lt of the research performed in this study. If this 
procedure is determined to be feasible in this study, future investigations will be planned to use 
the hydrogel to increase the distance between the pancreas and duodenum in the region of the 
pancreatic t umor to serve as a physical spacer so that the duodenum can be displaced away from 
the higher dose region.  
 
6. Payment and Remuneration  
a. Detail compensation for participants including possible total compensation, proposed 
bonus, and any proposed reductions or penalties for not completing the protocol:  
 
There will be no compensation for participants.  
 
7. Costs  
a. Detail costs of study procedure(s ) or drug (s) or substance(s) to participants and identify 
who will pay for them:  
Augmenix will provide the device (TraceIT Tissue Marker) and a separate FNA needle 
for injecting TraceIT.

 Page 5 of 46 Revis ed: July 12, [ADDRESS_1206912] of Acthar® on recovery from cognitive 
relapses in multiple sclerosis (MS).  Cognitive relapses are acute clinical 
declines in concentration, memory, working memory or increased 
fatigue .Cognitive relapses may also be detected by [CONTACT_865284]. We will use 
well-validated, objective metrics to evaluate cognitive change s following 
treatment with a 5 -day course of Acthar®over three months in patients 
showing cognitive r elapses in MS. To account for the possible practice 
effects of cognitive testing over a three -month period, we will compare the 
results to a matched sample of MS patients who are clinically stable.     
1.2 State the hypotheses to be tested.  
The primary hypothe sis of the study is that due to enhanced melanocortin 
response , Acthar will facilitate  recovery from cognitive changes occurring 
during cognitively focused relapse , and that patients treated with Acthar 
will return to baseline following treatment.  
2.0 Backgrou nd 
2.1 Describe the relevant prior experience and gaps in current 
knowledge.  
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an auto -immune disease causing inflammatory and 
neurodegenerative processes within the central nervous system (CNS).  
Supratentorial CNS damage has been sho wn to relate to cognitive impairment.1, [ADDRESS_1206913] common courses of MS (relapsing -remitting [RR] & secondary -
progressive [SP]) typi[INVESTIGATOR_865277] a series of acute exacerbations or ‘relapses’ 
wherein signifi cant demyelination contributes to lesion activity and clinical 
changes, including cognitive deterioration.3  While the rate o f relapse is likely to 
decline over time in patients with secondary -progressive MS, 
relapses/exacerbations are not uncommon in this population.   
 
Cognitiveimpairment  constitutes a relevant clinical aspect of multiple sclerosis  
(MS). Depending on the disea se phase and type, 40 -65% of MS patients develop 
various degrees of cognitive  dysfunction. These changes may begin very early in 
the disease process.4, [ADDRESS_1206914] ( UBIRB)

Quantitative measurement of cognitive impairment in MS is frequently through 
neuropsychological evaluation (NP).  These evaluations are conducted by [CONTACT_865285] , using a variety of psychometrically robust  measures.12, [ADDRESS_1206916] (SDMT),[ADDRESS_1206917] - Revised (BVMT -R),[ADDRESS_1206918] (PASAT).[ADDRESS_1206919] been made to study acute relapses with 
primarily cognitive sequelae (i.e., cognitive relapses).3, 11 This is due to the 
considerable methodological difficulties involved in studying the phenomenon.   
 
 
2.2 Describe any relevant preliminary data.  
A current study from our group, nearing completion, has demonstrated  a 
substantial change in neuropsychological (NP) measures in MS patients with 
cognitive relapse s (Benedict, et al. In Press) following treatment with high dose 
IV corticosteroids.  Corticosteroids have been shown to promote stabilization or 
improvement in randomized clinical trials following acute exacerbations19 by 
[CONTACT_865286] -myelination, though evidence 
for this is still being sought.20, 21Though infusion administered corticosteroids are 
now accepted as the standard of care in the treatment of MS exacerbations, they 
are not without side effects and many patients find the infusion route of 
administration intolerable.  Alternate treatments, part icularly those demonstrated 
to enhance recovery in functional domains, are vitally important.  
 
ACTH has been used for decades to treat MS exacerbations.  Recent data provides 
evidence that the beneficial effect of ACTH in other diseases (i.e. nephrotic 
syndrome, opsoclonus -myoclonus and infantile spasms ) may be related not only 
to its direct induction of corticosteroid production, but also to a corticosteroid -
independent melanocortin path.22Melanocortins have anti -inflammatory and 
possible neuroprotective effects and have been shown to improve attention, 
memory and learning.  ACTH binding to central and peripheral melanocortin 
receptors downregulatesimmunocyte activity, an effect superimposed onto its

better known glucoc orticoid -mediated actions.  In addition, ACTH potentiates 
parasympathetic and SNS activity. Both lessen immune responsiveness,22 and 
possibly provide neuroprotective effects.   
 
In addition to its effectiveness in treat ing cognitive relapses and the 
neuroprotective factors tentatively associated with its administration, ACTH may 
not only enhance initial recovery, but it may also slow the long -term progression 
of cognitive impairment.  Therefore, w e propose to study the i nfluence of Acthar  
on recovery from cognitive relapses in MS , and compare this to the influence of 
corticosteroid administration , as well as to stable MS patients.   
2.3 Provide the scientific or scholarly background  for, rational e for, and 
significanceof the research  based on the existing literatureand how 
will it add to existing knowledge.  
Response: The relative frequency of cognitive relapses is unknown at this time, 
though the current study and past studies along the same lines are the first to work 
towards  this identification.  The measures mentioned abov e will be those used in 
identification of cognitive relapses when this topic is explored.  There is limited 
evidence that certain neuropsychological deficits detected during an acute relapse 
may be reversib le, particularly in patients who initially have mild cognitive 
impairment, with improvement being in part correlated with the reduction in acute 
lesion load.3 
 
Both corticosteroids and adenocorticotropic hormone (Acthar) have been shown 
to promote stabilization or improvement in randomized clinical trials followin g 
acute exacerbations19 by [CONTACT_865287], though evidence for this is still being sought.20, [ADDRESS_1206921] of ACTH in other diseases (i.e. nephrotic 
syndrome, opsoclonus -myoclonus and infantile spasms ) may be related not only 
to its direct induction of corticosteroid production, but also to a corticosteroid -
indepe ndent melanocortin path.22Melanocortins have anti -inflammatory and 
possible neuroprotective effects and have been shown to improve attention, 
memory and learning.  ACTH binding to central and peripheral melanocortin 
receptors downregulatesimmunocyte activity, an effect superimposed onto its

In addition to its effectiveness in treating cognitive relapses and the 
neuroprotective factors tentatively associated with its administration, 
ACTH may not only enhance initial recovery, but it may also s low the 
long-term progression of cognitive impairment.  Therefore, w e propose to

MS,and to compare this to the influence of corticosteroid administration, 
as well as to  stable MS patients .

8.0 Study Endpoints  
8.1 Describe the primary and secondary study endpoints.  
Primary measures will include: Symbol Digit Modalities Test,[ADDRESS_1206949],16and 
the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC).23These tests are some of 
the strongest indicators of clinically relevant cognitive change available in MS.  
 
The Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) will be used to measure visual 
processing speed.  This test presents a stimulus key of numbers paired with 
abstract symbols at the top of a page.  Participants scan the page below the key 
which has rows of symbols wi thout the paired numbers.  The task is to generate 
the associated numbers orally as fast as possible.  We will employ the Rao oral 
adaptation [ADDRESS_1206950] ( UBIRB)

 Page 16 of 46 Revis ed: July 12, [ADDRESS_1206952] (PASAT)[ADDRESS_1206953]’s task is to respond with the 
sum of the last two digits presented.  As each n ew number is presented, the 
subject must recall the previous digit, add them together , and respond before the 
next number is presented.   
 
The Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC)[ADDRESS_1206954], and PASAT 3 -sec (d escribed above) are normalized 
based on an established normative sample and an overall composite z - score is 
then determined.  This composite is frequently used as a primary outcome in 
clinical trials as it covers three major domains of function potentiall y impaired in 
MS. 
 
The Brief Visuospatial Memory Test  Revised (BVMTR)26, [ADDRESS_1206955] (NAART) is a measure of verbal ability. 
Patients ar e asked to read a list of words aloud.  
 
Secondary measures will include: self and informant ratings of cognitive 
problems using the Multiple Sclerosis Neuropsychological Question naire,[ADDRESS_1206956] Scale, the Beck 
Depression Inventory – Fast Screen, and subscales from the Sickness Impact 
Profile30 (an assessment of health related quality of life and  activities of daily 
living).  Incidence of adverse events and concurrent medications will also be 
recorded as potential covariates.

Risks  
There are no risks associated with the neurological examination.  
The risks associated with the tests and questionnaires are minima l; there is 
the possibility that subjects mayexperience some fatigue or frustration.  
The examiner s will do their best to minimize them.  
The side effects that may occur with Acthar® are related primarily to its 
steroid -like effects similar to IV Solumedrol.  There may  be increased 
susceptibility to new infection and increased risk of reactivation of latent 
infections , hence the strict eligibility criteria.  
Acthar® may cause various side effects such as:  
• Dizziness  
• Nausea  
• Anaphylactic or hypersensitivity reactions  
• Hypertension (high blood pressure)  
• Congestive heart failure  
• Thin, fragile skin  
• Erythema (redness of the skin)  
• Increased sweating  
• Increased requirements for insulin or oral hypoglycemic (low 
blood sugar) agents in diabetics  
• Elevated blood sugar  
• Cushing’s syndrome  
• Gastrointestinal perforation and bleeding or peptic ulcer  
• Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)  
• Abdominal distension (enlargement)  
• Water retention  
• Peripheral edema (swelling of the extremities)  
• Headache  
• Impair ed wound healing

NCI Version Date: 9/24/2018  Update  #[ADDRESS_341772] troublesome symptoms for primary 
brain tumor patients throughout the disease trajectory (1, 2). This condition has long been under -recognized, under -diagnosed, and undertreated (3 -6).  
Cancer Related Fatigue (CRF) is a concerning issue in patients with cancer due to its high 
prevalence and negative effects on quality of life. Fatigue is a subjective experience.  
Sufferers may exhibit symptoms that are physical (physical weakness or tiredness), 
emotional (depression ), motivational (lack of initiative or motivation), cognitive 
(impairment of cognitive function), and social (reduced ability to sustain social 
relationships) (7). In a survey evaluating Health -Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) in a 
variety of primary brain tumor patients at various times in the trajectory of their illness, 
42% reported “quite a bit low” or “very low” energy levels (8,9).   
Radiation therapy is the most common treatment modality for all brain tumor grades, and 
has been the treatment evaluated  in the glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patient population 
in relation to fatigue.  Lovely and colleagues reported that over 80% of primary brain tumor patients report fatigue during radiation therapy (10).  Fatigue has been reported to occur as 
early as within [ADDRESS_341773] radiation treatment and tends to increase with the number 
of radiation fractions (11).  Fatigue which occurs during radiation therapy may continue into the post radiation period.  Faithfull and Brada reported on the occurrence of a 
somnolence syndrome in the immediate post -radiation period (12).  This syndrome 
included fatigue, excessive drowsiness, feeling clumsy, and an inability to concentrate.  In this study, patients were followed during radiation and the immediate post -radiatio n period.  
Following completion of radiation therapy, the reported symptoms had a cyclical pattern, 
with increased severity between day 1 -21 and then day 30 -35 after treatment. Frequently, 
patients report that fatigue begins with treatment, continues during the course of treatment, and declines somewhat but persists at a higher -than- baseline rate after treatment is 
completed, sometimes lasting for months or even years (13 -18).   
Besides treatment factors, fatigue is often due to the tumor itself.  The mechanism of direct tumor related fatigue is poorly understood and presumed to be a combination of the tumor 
biology itself, surrounding edema, and location.  A prospective trial assessing quality of 
life in high -grade glioma patients found one third of patient s had clinically significant 
fatigue at baseline before initiation of radiotherapy.  In addition this study found fatigue to 
be an independent predictor of overall survival (19).   
Clinically, a variety of other factors may contribute to the frequency and intensity of 
fatigue.  These include concomitant medications such as chemotherapy, anticonvulsants, corticosteroids, metabolic disturbances, and psychosocial issues such as depression and 
anxiety. Most patients require corticosteroids to treat cerebral edema and anticonvulsants 
for seizure management. These medications have been reported to have a negative impact 
on fatigue in this patient population (11, 20). Recently, poor performance status, female 
gender, and active disease status were found to be associated with moderate to severe fatigue in patients with primary brain tumors (21).  For males, antidepressants and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], 
in addition to performance status predicted fatigue severity (22).  For women, variables 
that were most highly associated with fatigu e severity were low -grade tumor diagnosis, 
steroids and active disease status (21).   
Alliance A221101 
NCI Version Date: 9/24/2018  Update  #[ADDRESS_341774] eight years from completion of tumor therapy (22).  In this study, 39% 
of patients with a mean disease duration of 15 years, reported severe fatigue. 
Characteristics that differentiated those who were severely fatigued versus not severely fatigue included older age and anticonvulsant use (22).   
There are limited studies to date exploring the occurrence and correlates of fatigue in 
patients with primary brain tumors. In patients with other solid tumors, fatigue is often the 
most common and severe symptom associated with the disease and treatment (22, 23).  
Fatigue has been demonstrated to cluster with other symptoms, including pain, distress, insomnia, and depression and influence outcomes such as perceived health and functional status (24-28).  In the limited studies to date in patients with primary brain tumors, fatigue 
has been identified as a common symptom occurring in patients with both low and high grade tumors, to persist in long term survivors of low grade brain tumors, to be as sociated 
with both radiation and a variety of chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_280025].  
1.1.[ADDRESS_341775] of  a complex interplay among multiple 
elements including attention span, learning and memory, visuospatial ability, mental flexibility, psychomotor activity and manual dexterity. The cholinergic neurotransmitter 
system is central for regulation of memory and  learning, while the hippocampus is the 
primary region of the brain mediating cognitive function, primarily memory and attention. The basal forebrain is the major source of cholinergic innervation to the hippocampus. Derangement in any of these cognitive elements leads to a variety of cognitive and/or 
psychomotor problems which can range from hard- to-detect selective deficits to global 
impairments (28, 29).  
The effects of cancer treatments on cognitive function have commanded increasing 
attention from rese archers in the past decade (28 -32).  Cognitive deficits identified by 
[CONTACT_280054] a range of difficulties including memory and concentration 
problems that can emerge during cancer treatment and/or months after completion (29). 
Cognitive def icits that occur as a result of cancer or its treatment vary widely and may be 
subtle or dramatic, temporary or permanent, and stable or progressive (33- 36). Pathological 
evidence supports adverse effects of radiation on white matter tracts and cerebral vasculature of the brain secondary to damaged oligodendrocytes resulting in axonal 
demyelination, and, disruption of vascular endothelial cells contributing to coagulative necrosis, vessel wall thickening, and focal mineralization. Chronic radiation toxicity  is also 
believed to involve alterations in neurogenesis as well as metabolic abnormalities and 
inflammatory responses (37 -40).   
Subtle cognitive changes pose unique challenges to detection and management. First, the cause of subtle changes in cognitive f unction may not be readily apparent, and the 
impairments may not be evaluable with standard, objective neuropsychological measures. Second, subtle changes in cognitive function may also be confused with or confounded by 
[CONTACT_280055] w ith cancer and its treatment, such as depression, 
anxiety, and fatigue.  
Although the phenomenon is not understood completely, cognitive deficits in cancer patients are assuming greater significance as cancer survival improves. Advances in basic, 
imaging, and clinical sciences are beginning to unravel pathophysiologic mechanisms and

defic it/hyperactivity disorder and neurodegenerative diseases.  
1.2 Evidence -Based Interventions  
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) has published clinical practice guidelines that encourage early identification and management of CRF during and after treatment (5).  
Physical activity is first -line therapy for CRF. However, an exercise pro gram should be initiated 
cautiously in patients who have neurologic deficits, are deconditioned or experiencing 
comorbidities such as bone metastases, myelosuppression, fever, or treatment -related 
complications (5). Structured exercise training has been associated with significant improvement 
in quality of life and improved fatigue across numerous cancer populations, however have not 
studied the effect of exercise among cancer patients with neurologic and/or cognitive deficits or 
those with glioblastoma (41 ). Jones and colleagues found that the six minute walking test was 
well correlated with KPS and QOL in patients with glioma.  Their results then lead to the 
suggestion that interventions geared towards increasing their [ADDRESS_341776] may cause 
considerable improvements in quality of life and fatigue in the recurrent glioblastoma patient 
population (42).   
A lack of sufficient evidence precludes the routine use of pharmacologic therapy in patients with 
moderate- to-severe fatigue. However, the NCCN does list pharmacologic intervention with 
psychostimulants as an option in cases in which other causes of fatigue have been ruled out (5). 
1.2.1 Clinical trials using methylphenidate for treatment of fatigue  
Methylphenidate is a central nervous system stim ulant similar to amphetamine with a short 
plasma half -life of 2 hours, a rapid onset of action, and duration of action of 3 to 6 hours 
(43). The baseline dose is usually 5 mg in the morning and at noon with titration as needed with a maximum dosing of 1 mg /kg/d. The most frequent side effects are tachycardia, 
nervousness, insomnia, and anorexia, especially at higher doses. Open- label studies 
suggest an improvement in fatigue (44, 45). 
In a randomized controlled trial, 112 patients were assigned to 5 mg of methylphenidate or 
placebo and able to repeat dosing every 2 hours as needed to a maximum of 20 mg daily. At 7 days, significant improvement in fatigue compared to baseline was noted in both 
groups (46). The authors suggested that the observed benefits might be due to daily contact [CONTACT_280056] a major symptomatic or placebo effect.  
A more recent study conducted by [CONTACT_280057], reports the results of a randomized, 
controlled trial comparing methylphenidate versus a placebo in a group of heterogeneous 
group of patients with CRF (47). Adults who were eligible for this trial had to have a history of CRF as defined by a score of 4 or more on a subjective fatigue level screening scale that ranged from zero (none) to 10 (as bad as it can be), for at least 1 month before registration. 
The authors found no significant differences in usual fatigue, current fatigue or worse 
fatigue during the course of the 4 week study. The primary end point of prorated Area 
Under the Curve for the usual fatigue question of the BFI did not show a statistically 
significant difference between the methylphenidate and placebo arms (P=.32). The methylphenidate treatment arm demonstrated a 3.2% better fatigue score on average, which 
was16%  the standard deviation of the fatigue scores (a small effect size) and not 
significantly different than that in the placebo arm. The authors did observe however, that patients with more advanced disease showed a significant response to methylphenidate as 
well as a trend for more improvement in usual fatigue for those who reported more severe fatigue at baseline with methylphenidate as opposed to placebo.  This study excluded 
Alliance A221101 
NCI Version Date: 9/24/2018  Update  #[ADDRESS_341777] also been reported by 
[CONTACT_280058] (48). They conclude that higher levels of fatigue were predictors of 
response to methylphenidate in patients with advanced cancer in a randomized clinical trial 
conducted at MD Anderson. 
In terms of fatigue prevention, a phase III randomized, double blind  study evaluating d -
THREO- methylphenidate HCL (MPH) in patients with brain tumors receiving radiation 
therapy was not able to show a benefit for the MPH in preventing fatigue. At the end of 
brain RT, there was no significant difference between groups takin g MPH or placebo on 
the mean fatigue subscale score of the FACIT -F (49). The adjusted least squares estimate 
of the Mean Fatigue Subscale Score was 33.7 for the d- MPH and 35.6 for the placebo arm 
(p = 0.64).   
Methylphenidate has also been evaluated with respect to treating cognitive deficits in 
patients with brain tumors.  The first report was published in 1995 (50), in the treatment of 
neurobehavioral slowing associated with cancer and cancer treatment. Weitzner and 
colleagues described the effects of the  psychostimulant methylphenidate on three patients 
who had cognitive deficits that had been caused by [CONTACT_280059]. Methylphenidate was expected to act as an indirect agonist, causing release 
of catecholamines that would control attention and memory. Arousal, attention, initiation 
speed of tasks, and mood were all improved.  
Subsequently, Meyers and colleagues evaluated methylphenidate in patients who had 
primary brain tumors and abnormal neuropsychological test scores. Mean test scores in 
several cognitive domains were significantly improved in the group of 26 patients, despi[INVESTIGATOR_280027]. There were also improvements in 
subjective cognitive functioning and mood (51).  
Based on it s mechanism of action, methylphenidate is associated with a variety of adverse 
effects. Nervousness is among the most common adverse effects noted with general 
methylphenidate use (52, 53), while appetite loss and abdominal pain have been noted in 
many con trolled clinical studies using this drug (54). This was noted in the study conducted 
by [CONTACT_280057] (47), where patients in the methylphenidate group reported adverse 
effects, including nervousness and appetite loss, compared with those in the placebo ar m. 
Decreased libido and shakiness have also been noted as adverse effects in a small percentage of participants in placebo -controlled methylphenidate studies. Because of the 
adverse effect profile seen, future evaluations of methylphenidate should take into account the risk -benefit ratio from the patient’s perspective. 
Due to the poor side effect profile, the lack of positive data, and the potential for abuse, 
making this agent a Schedule II controlled substance, we do not wish to pursue 
methylphenidate as an agent for fatigue improvement in our brain tumor population.  
1.2.[ADDRESS_341778] was given single oral doses of methylphenidate (45 mg or 90 mg), modafinil (200 mg, 400 mg or 800 mg) and placebo. Measures of subjective, behavioral, and physiological responses 
were evaluated at fixed intervals during 72h after each dosing occasion. Subjects 
Alliance A221101 
NCI Version Date: 9/24/2018  Update  #7 
11 discriminated both modafinil and methylphenidate from placebo. Subjects liked the effects 
of both drugs. Howev er, modafinil differed from methylphenidate in its lack of a significant 
response on the Amphetamine Scale of the Addiction Research Center Inventory. The profile of physiological effects for modafinil differed from methylphenidate in that it 
showed greater inhibition of observed and reported sleep, less facilitation of orthostatic 
tachycardia and less reduction of caloric intake. These findings are consistent with preclinical pharmacological data suggesting that modafinil is not an amphetamine -like 
agent ( 55).  
In an open- label trial conducted to evaluate the benefit of modafinil in managing CRF, 
patients who had completed treatment for breast cancer (chemotherapy, chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy), received modafinil 200 mg daily for 1 month (56). Upon completion of treatment with modafinil, mean fatigue severity decreased from 6.9 to 3.7 
(0-10 scale: 0 = fatigue not present and 10 = fatigue as bad as you can imagine). The mean 
rating on the patient -reported global effectiveness measured after therapy was 5.0 (with 1 
= no benefit and 7 = great improvement). This benefit rating supports the finding that 
participants perceived an improvement in fatigue with the use of open label modafinil. 
Furthermore, 51% of the patients reported improvement in sleep and 51% reported less 
daytime drowsiness. Additional benefits reported by a majority of patients (>60%) 
included improvements in general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work ability, 
relations with other people, and enjoyment of life. Four patients withdrew from the study: 1 due to pregnancy and 3 due to "agitation" that developed after 1 week of treatment.  
Morrow et al (57) conducted a second open- label trial of modafinil, with the same purpose 
as the previous trial, in women with breast cancer who e xperienced fatigue levels of 2 or 
more on the Brief Fatigue Inventory (0- 10 scale, 0 = no fatigue and 10 = fatigue as bad as 
it can be) at least 1 month following completion of radiation therapy. Patients received 
modafinil 200 mg once daily for 1 month. Of the 82 women enrolled, 76 completed the 
study. Reasons for discontinuation were pregnancy (n = 1), anxiety (n = 2), headache (n = 
2), and nausea (n = 1). Ninety percent of the women experienced an improvement in 
fatigue.  
One of the limitations of these studies is the design (56, 57). As open- label trials, they are 
subject to bias from a lack of randomization, lack of blinding, and lack of a control arm. 
Furthermore, with availability of only the published abstracts that contain an abbreviated 
methods sec tion, it is unclear what the full inclusion/exclusion criteria were. Likewise, the 
authors did not indicate whether patients were assessed and treated for other causes of CRF, 
and it is unknown whether patients received prior or concurrent treatment for th is 
condition. Patients who had received multiple prior treatments or concurrent therapy, including exercise, may have suffered from a more severe form of CRF. Therefore, 
observing a benefit from modafinil in these patients would strengthen the support that  the 
drug provides a positive effect.  
Jean-Pi[INVESTIGATOR_280028] a multi -center phase [ADDRESS_341779] of modafinil on CRF among 631 patients 
receiving chemotherapy (58). Patients who reported fatigue were randomly assigned to 
receive either 200 mg of oral modafinil daily or a matching placebo. Treatment began on 
Day 5 of Cycle 2 and ended after Day 7 of Cycle 4. Fatigue and depression were assessed 
during Cycles 2 to 4 by [CONTACT_280060]. Group differences 
(treatment vs. control) in the worst level of fatigue during the previous week at Cycle 4 
were examined by [CONTACT_280061] (ANCOVA) adjusting for baseline 
fatigue (Cycle 2). Patients reporting more severe fatigue (level >6 on a 10 -point scale) at 
cycle 2 experienced greater improvement than patients reporting moderate or mild levels 
Alliance A221101 
NCI Version Date: 9/24/2018  Update  #7 
12 (p = 0.017). Of the patients studied, [ADDRESS_341780] type.  
The authors conclude modafinil may be useful in controlling cancer -related fatigue in 
patients who present with severe fatig ue but is not useful in patients with mild or moderate 
fatigue.   
More directly related to the needs of patients with brain tumors,  a randomized, dose -
controlled trial was conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of modafinil in 30 patients 
with cerebr al tumors suffering from neurobehavioral dysfunction and/or fatigue post -
treatment (59), 8 (27%) with glioblastoma multiforme and 10 (33%) with anaplastic glioma. Unfortunately, to our knowledge the results of this study have not been published to date and therefore, besides the information reported in the abstract, we are unable to 
provide details on how large a study was conducted , whether it was blinded, used a placebo or how large the differences were between the active and control groups .  Fatigue levels 
were reported at baseline, week 8, and week 12 using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS; 
score range 1 -7, lower score indicates less fatigue), Visual Analog Fatigue Scale (VAFS; 
score range 0 -10, higher score indicates less fatigue), and the Modified Fat igue Impact 
Scale (MFIS; score 0 -84, lower score indicates less fatigue). At baseline, 43% of patients 
were suffering from marked attention/memory impairment and/or fatigue, while 47% were 
identified as having severe illness by [CONTACT_280062], which 
rates the severity of illness as normal, borderline, mild, moderate, marked, severe, or 
extreme. Patients had been previously treated with neurosurgical resection (93%), radiation 
(87%), and/or chemotherapy (70%). Improvements wer e seen in fatigue outcome 
measures, with the greatest improvements noted [ADDRESS_341781] that modafinil (Provigil®) may have some cognitive enhancement capabilities as well.  To our knowledge, the first study to address the effect of 
modafinil on cognition in patients with cancer was done by [CONTACT_280063], NY.  They found that [ADDRESS_341782] cancer, helped improve patient accuracy and speed of retention.  Patients treated with modafinil had improved verbal and visual memory storage, retrieval, and 
retention (60).  
The efficacy of modafinil in treating cognitive dysfunction in patients receiving t reatment 
for glioblastoma is unknown.      
1.3 Mechanisms of Newer Psychostimulants and Rationale for Armodafinil (Nuvigil) 
Modafinil is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant approved by [CONTACT_280064][INVESTIGATOR_156140], shift work 
sleep disorder, and obstructive sleep apnea (61, 62). Modafinil is theorized to cause neuronal 
activation in areas of the hypothalamus associated with normal wakefulness. This mechanism is 
unique from that of  other centrally acting agents such as amphetamines, which cause widespread 
activation of the CNS. In comparison with other stimulants, modafinil has a low potential for abuse due to a lack of activity on dopamine receptors (6, 63). Important proposed diff erences 
between methylphenidate and modafinil are the primary effects on the cortical versus subcortical 
areas and the decrease in GABA, accompanied by [CONTACT_280065]; an increase in 
serotonin and histamine. Modafinil is generally well tolerated. Preliminary data demonstrate 
Alliance A221101 
NCI Version Date: 9/24/2018  Update  #[ADDRESS_341783] frequent 
adverse events (5%) are headache, nausea, nervousness, rhinitis, diarrhea, back pain, anxiety, insomnia, dizziness, and dyspepsia (61).  
Armodafinil is the R -enantiomer of modafinil which is a mixture of the R - and S -enantiomers.  
Concentration- time profiles of the two enantiomers show the p ure R -enantiomer to be  the longer 
lasting of the two enantiomers (10 -14 hrs vs, 3- 4 hrs), with a longer elimination half -life than 
modafinil.  The two medications are virtually identical clinically when adjusted for the [ADDRESS_341784] mechanism of action is unknown. Armodafinil 
belongs to a class of drugs known as eugeroics, which are stimulants that provide long -lasting 
mental arousal. Pharmacologically, armodafinil does not bind to or inhibit several receptors and 
enzymes potentially relevant for sleep/wake regulation. Armodafinil is not a direct - or indirect -
acting dopamine receptor agonist. However, in vitro, both armodafinil and modafinil bind to the dopamine transporter and inhibit dopamine reuptake. The side effec t profile of the two 
medications appears to be similar and a slight difference noted on the package inserts generally 
favor armodafinil.  
While no studies to date have examined the benefits of armodafinil in reducing CRF, 
pharmacokinetic evidence suggests it will be at least the equivalent of modafinil in doing so.  The 
precise mechanism(s) through which armodafinil (R -enantiomer) or modafinil (mixture of R - and 
S-enantiomers) promote wakefulness is unknown.  Both armodafinil and modafinil have shown 
virtua lly identical pharmacological properties in nonclinical animal and in vitro studies (64)  Data 
held at Cephalon Inc. and reported on by [CONTACT_280066] (65) shows that the S - and R -
isomers of modafinil exhibited similar inhibition of binding and functional activity at dopamine, norepi[INVESTIGATOR_280029].  They also reported that while the two isomers of 
modafinil have approximately equipotent pharmacological activity, the S -isomer is eliminated 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], having a half -life of 4 -5 hours , whereas the R -isomer has a half -life of approximately 15 
hours.  Essentially, modafinil is the S -isomer and armodafinil is the R-isomer.   
A pharmacokinetic comparison of modafinil and armodafinil found that at steady state, 
armodafinil produces consistently higher plasma drug concentrations late in the day than 
modafinil when compared on a milligram to milligram basis (65).  The different ph armacokinetic 
profile of armodafinil may result in improved usefulness throughout the day in patients compared with modafinil (66). In other words, due to the longer acting R -isomer, armodafinil may result in 
better control of fatigue for a longer time thr oughout the day.  
Armodafinil is a novel psychostimulant that has shown promise as a cognitive enhancer in normal adults and patient populations, including schizophrenia and attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder (67- 70).  Commonly prescribed to treat MS -related fatigue (67), armodafinil is also an 
alertness- promoting agent that reduces lapses of attention and vigilance that are caused by [CONTACT_280067] (71- 73).  Indeed, it has been suggested that the nootropic 
effects of armodafinil may be magnified among people with pronounced fatigue and pre -existing 
cognitive difficulties (74, 75).  As cancer patients frequently suffer from significant fatigue and neuropsychological deficits, armodafinil has strong potential as a highly efficacious cognitive 
enhancer in this population.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], no published studies have examined the use of armodafinil to treat fatigue or cognitive impairment in cancer patients.  
Both armodafinil and modafinil have been well tolerated in patients with sig nificant fatigue 
complaints.  The adverse event profiles are similar between the two agents in head to head 
studies.  At the highest dosage, headache was the greatest adverse event noted with use of 
armodafinil compared to modafinil followed by [CONTACT_280068] (76).  
Alliance A221101 
NCI Version Date: 9/24/2018  Update  #[ADDRESS_341785] symp toms of fatigue and 
cognitive impairment, as well as preliminary data with modafinil in patients with brain tumors (59), provides the impetus to study the newer psychostimulants in patients with high grade 
glioma. Although large RCT’s with modafinil and methylphenidate have not shown a significant impact on fatigue (47, 58), these trials did not focus on, and often did not include, patients with 
brain tumors, specifically glioblastoma.  These studies do provide data to hypothesize that 
patients with more severe fatigue (48, 58) may benefit from these agents.  Although data to date 
do not support using methylphenidate during radiation treatment (49), newer psychostimulants 
with broader CNS effects still need to be evaluated for effects on fatigue during and after radiation therapy, specifically in brain tumor populations. There are two clinical trials currently 
actively recruiting patients that involve armodafinil.  Both are using heterogeneous populations of people with brain tumors and both are using armodafinil during radiation therapy (77, 78).   
We conducted an extensive literature search and could find no published data on the effects of 
250mg of armodafinil in treating fatigue in brain tumor patients. Given the trend toward positivity 
of the studies ongoing with 150 mg dose (77,78) further investigation is needed to decipher if 
further benefit from a higher dose is plausible.  The 250 mg dose of armodafinil has been proven safe and efficacious in a study that showed positive results in patients with narco lepsy (109). In 
addition, there are ongoing trials listed on clinicaltrials.gov using 250mg of armodafinil in patients with results pending. Our proposed three -arm study complements both of those trials and 
other ongoing studies (110) by [CONTACT_280069] a more homogeneous population, specifically high grade glioma, and evaluating armodafinil for its effects on severe fatigue once radiation therapy has been completed. Given that fatigue is prevalent at the completion of 
radiation therapy, this seems the best endpoint to evaluate. Cognitive difficulties are one of the 
elements of fatigue and hence, these two problems are sometimes difficult to tease apart.  Fatigue 
measurement is more advanced than cognitive measurement, due to problems with practice  
effects for neuropsychiatric measures and the lack of understanding of how fatigue, sleep and 
mood impact cognition.  Therefore, we believe that evaluating fatigue as the primary endpoint 
and cognition as a secondary endpoint is well justified.

6.3.1 IRB Approval:   
Each investigator or group of investigators at a clinical site must obtain IRB approval for 
this protocol and submit IRB approval and supporting documentation to the CTSU Regulatory Office before they can be approved to enroll patients.  Assignment of site 
registration status in the CTSU Regulatory Suppo rt System (RSS) uses extensive data to 
make a determination of whether a site has fulfilled all regulatory criteria including but not limited to the following: 
• An active Federal Wide Assurance (FWA) number  
• An active roster affiliation with the Lead Network or a participating organization 
• A valid IRB approval 
• Compliance with all protocol specific requirements. 
In addition, the site- protocol Principal Investigator (PI) must meet the following criteria:  
• Active registration status  

Alliance A221101 
NCI Version Date: 9/24/2018  Update  #7 
24 • The IRB number of the site IRB of record listed on their Form FDA 1572 
• An active status on a participating roster at the registering site.  
Sites participating on the NCI CIRB initiative that are approved by [CONTACT_280080] t o the CTSU Regulatory Office. 
For sites using the CIRB, IRB approval information is received from the CIRB and applied 
to the RSS in an automated process. Signatory Institutions  must submit a Study Specific 
Worksheet for Local Context (SSW) to the CIRB via IRB Manager to indicate their intent 
to open the study locally.  The CIRB’s approval of the SSW is then communicated to the 
CTSU Regulatory Office.  In order for the SSW approval to be processed, the Signatory Institution must inform the CTSU which CIRB -approved institutions aligned with the 
Signatory Institution are participating in the study.

NCILLARY TREATMENT /SUPPORTIVE CARE 
Patients who begin using any other pharmacologic agents or nonpharmacologic interventions after 
registration to specifically treat fatigue including psychostimulants, antidepressants, acupuncture,  etc. 
will be taken off study. 
Note:  Antidepressants used to treat items other than fatigue (such as hot flashes or depression) are 
allowed if the patient has been on a stable dose for ≥ 28 days and plans to continue for the duration 
of the trial. Erythrop oietin agents to treat anemia are allowed.  
10.0 A DVERSE EVENT (AE)  REPORTING AND MONITORING  
The prompt reporting of adverse events is the responsibility of each investigator engaged in clinical research, as required by [CONTACT_280087]. Adverse events must be described and graded using the 
terminology and grading categories defined in the NCI’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0.  However, CTCAE v5.[ADDRESS_341806] schedule in Section 4.0. For this trial, the Adverse Events forms are 
used for routine AE reporting (see Section 18.2 for adverse event form submission details).

• Use the NCI protocol number and the protocol -specific patient ID provided during trial 
registration on all reports . 
Additional Instructions or Exclusions:  
• All adverse events reported via CTEP -AERS (i.e., serious adverse events) should also be 
forwarded to your local IRB. 
• Grade 3/[ADDRESS_341811] be reported 
via CTEP -AERS.  
• Treatment expected adverse events include those listed in Section 15.0 and in the package 
inser t 
• Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 “Disease progression” in 
the system organ class (SOC) “General disorders and administration site conditions.” Evidence that the death was a manifestatio n of underlying disease (e.g., radiological changes 
suggesting tumor growth or progression: clinical deterioration associated with a disease 
process) should be submitted. 
• Any death occurring within [ADDRESS_341812] dose, regardless of attribution to the  
investigational agent/intervention requires expedited reporting within 24 hours. 
• Any death occurring greater than [ADDRESS_341813] dose of the investigational agent/intervention requires expedited reporting within 24 hours only if it is possibly, probably, or definitely related to the investigational agent/intervention. 
• All new malignancies must be reported through CTEP -AERS whether or not they are 
thought to be related to either previous or current treatment. All new malignancies should 
be reported, i.e., solid tumors (including non- melanoma skin malignancies), hematologic 
malignancies, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and 
in situ tumors.  
Secondary Malignancy:  
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_22058] t for a previous malignancy (e.g., 
treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary 
malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm.  
CTEP requires all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent 
under an NCI IND/IDE be reported via CTEP -AERS. Three options are available to describe 
the event:  
• Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., acute myelocytic leukemia [AML])  
• Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
• Treatment -related secondary malignancy  
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol.  
Alliance A221101 
NCI Version Date: 9/24/2018  Update  #7 
33 Second Malignancy:  
A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a 
metastasis from the initial malignancy).  Second malignancies require ONLY routine 
reporting unless otherwise specified. 
Whenever possible, the CTEP -AERS reports for new malignancies should include tum or 
pathology, history or prior tumors, prior treatment/current treatment including duration, any 
associated risk factors or evidence regarding how long the new malignancy may have been 
present, when and how it was detected, molecular characterization or cytogenetics of the 
original tumor (if available) and of any new tumor, and new malignancy treatment and 
outcome, if available.  
• Pregnancy loss  
• Pregnancy loss is defined in CTCAE as “Death in utero.” 
• Any Pregnancy loss should be reported expeditiously, as Gr ade 4 “Pregnancy loss” 
under the Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions SOC.  
• A Pregnancy loss should NOT be reported as a Grade 5 event under the Pregnancy, 
puerperium and perinatal conditions SOC, as currently CTEPAERS recognizes this 
event as a patient death. 
• A neonatal death should be reported expeditiously as Grade 4, “Death neonatal” under the General disorders and administration SOC. 
• The reporting of adverse events described above is in addition to, and does not supplant, 
the reporting of adverse events as part of the reporting of the results of the clinical trial,

REATMENT EVALUATION  
11.1 Patient Self- Report Measures  
The Patient self -report measures will be given three times, baseline and after weeks 4 and 8 of 
treatment. These items together take approximately 20 - 25 minutes to complete. 
Fatigue is measured by [CONTACT_280090] a complete 
description of the type of fatigue experienced throughout treatment by [CONTACT_280091] (reliability, validity, responsiveness) the alternative methods impart in measuring fatigue. 
11.1.1 Brief Fatigue I nventory (BFI)  
The BFI is a 9 -item instrument that allows for the rapid assessment of fatigue level in 
cancer patients and identifies those patients with severe fatigue.  Three items ask patients 
to rate their fatigue for “now,” and fatigue at its “worst” and “usual” for the last 24 hours.  
The 11- point scales are bounded by 0 = “no fatigue” and 10 = “fatigue as bad as you can 
imagine.”  Using the same type of scales, the remaining questions ask patients to rate how their fatigue interferes with several quality of life domains including general activity, 
walking, mood, work, and relations with others.  These scales are bounded by 0 = “does 
not interfere” and 10 = interferes completely.”  The reliability and validity of the BFI were demonstrated in a study of  305 cancer patients and 290 community- dwelling adults. An 
internal consistency coefficient (Cronbach’s alpha) = 0.96 was demonstrated when the BFI was administered to 305 patients with cancer (80). The BFI has been demonstrated as 
viable primary endpoints  for numerous cancer clinical trials and has been translated into 
22 different languages (81).  
Single -question assessment is the most commonly used and the most useful methodology. 
A score of 1 –3 indicates the presence of mild fatigue that does not requir e clinical 
intervention, and scores of 4–6 and 7 –10 indicate moderate and severe fatigue, 
respectively, which require further evaluation and clinical intervention (82).

(91). It was recently endorsed by [CONTACT_280092] -
sponsored cancer control trials. It produces a single summative score for the purposes of 
analysis.  
The PROMIS measure will be used mostly as an exploratory secondary measure.  We will 
look at its psychometric properties with the population in this study and also look at 
concurrent validity using the BFI as a gold standard.  There are two domains represented 
by [CONTACT_941] 7 items in the PROMIS fatigue short form; impact and experience.  In an exploratory 
manner, these will be evaluated as subscales but also the scale will be evaluated as a unidimensional measure.  Since the fatigue items have not been, to our knowledge, 
psychometrically validated in cancer populations, we do see the use of PROMIS fatigue as an exploration.  Since there is a desire to use a core set of measures in fatigue studies going 
forward and PROMIS has been cit ed as being a logical set of measures to use in this regard, 
we felt it was important to include these and begin generating some psychometric data, 
particularly in this, more rare population of high grade glioma patients. 
11.1.3 PRO -CTCAE  
PRO -CTCAE Sympto matic adverse events (AE) in cancer trials are reported by [CONTACT_280093]'s (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE). To integrate the patient perspective into AE reporting, NCI contracted 
(HHSN261201000043C) to create a patient- reported outcomes companion tool (PRO -
CTCAE). The validity and reliability of PRO -CTCAE’s [ADDRESS_341817]. The items being created and validated are intended to be complementary to existing symptom items in the NCI’s Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). The CTCAE is an existing lexicon of 
clinician -reported adverse event items required for use in all NCI -sponsored trials. The 
goal of developi[INVESTIGATOR_280037] E symptom items is to improve the accuracy 
and precision of adverse symptom assessment in cancer trials, and to bring the CTCAE into harmony with other areas of clinical research in which the gold standard for symptom 
evaluation is patient self -reporting. Information gathered through the PRO -CTCAE is 
intended to provide clinicians with more comprehensive information about the patient experience with treatment when trials are completed and reported. We are including six items from the PRO -CTCAE in this study  for fatigue and cognitive function to provide 
further evidence of their reliability and validity and compare the PRO -CTCAE items to the

Linear Analogue Self -Assessment (LASA) items have been validated as general measures 
of global QOL dimensional constructs in numerous settings (83- 88). A series of five LASA 
items have been constructed and validated at Mayo for use in cancer patients (89). The [ADDRESS_341818] -used assessment in all NCI -sponsored cancer control studies (90).  As a result of 
recent research, this study includes LASA measures for global QOL and fatigue and will include these mea sures in all future phase II and phase III clinical trials as an independent 
prognostic factor independent of performance status.

NCI Version Date: 9/24/2018  Update  #[ADDRESS_341819] -Cog (Secondary Cognitive Endpoint) 
Patients in this study will self -report their perceived cognitive functioning using the FACT -
Cog version 3 (92). For many cancer -related symptoms, given their subjective nature, self -
report is the only way an assessment can be conducted. The FACT -Cog is a useful measure 
of perceived cognitive deficits and related quality of life for adults undergoing 
chemotherapy, and is the first patient -reported outcomes measure to be developed and 
validated with a sample of cancer patients. The scale measures the frequency of positive 
and negative cognitive functioning events over the past seven da ys, based on self -report. 
The measure utilizes a five- point Likert -type scale (ranging from 0 = never to 4 = several 
times a day) to assess several different aspects of cognitive function. Lower scores are 
indicative of poorer perception of functioning. The FACT -Cog assesses a broad range of 
cognitive domains (not just those specifically related to work) and provides a 
multidimensional view of the cognitive deficits often experienced by [CONTACT_90383].  
11.1.6 Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ).  
The amount of leisure time spent in physical activity will be assessed using the Godin 
Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ) (103). The GLTEQ consists of two 
questions designed to assess the frequency within a typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] [ADDRESS_341820] 15 minutes during a participant’s free time.  The measure is easily administered and brief, with a retest coefficient of .62, a 
concurrent coefficient of .32 and an objective validity coefficient of .56 compared with 
CALTRAC accelerometry, estimated VO2 max and body composition (via hydrostatic 
weight).18  The GLTEQ has also been used successfully in populations of adult cancer patients (104-108).   
11.2 Objective Cognitive Measures (Primar y Cognitive Endpoint)  
The neuropsychological battery proposed for this study overlaps with batteries used in numerous North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) multi -center trials for studies in patients with 
CNS tumors without any problems or complicat ions. 
Clinicians and researchers must balance the often conflicting goals of obtaining valid PRO data 
while not burdening patients or interfering with the provision of care in a busy clinical setting. When surveyed about the preferred properties for an assessment battery for neurological and 
behavioral function, 191 experts in clinical and epi[INVESTIGATOR_280038], precise, and easy to administer, score, and interpret (93). 
The Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT; Smith, 1982) is a measure of attention, visual 
tracking, and psychomotor speed.  The task consists of a brief practice, followed by a [ADDRESS_341821] digit under each symbol, without skippi[INVESTIGATOR_19263], as quickly as 
possible for 90 seconds.  This task has been found to be a particularly sensitive indicator  of brain 
dysfunction (95).

15.1 Armodafinil (Nuvigil®) or placebo  
15.1.1 Background 
Armodafinil indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea 
(OSA) and to improve wakefulness in patients with narcolepsy and shift work disorder 
(SWD).  Armodafinil is the R -enantiomer of modafinil, which is a mixture of the R - and 
S-enanti omers.  The precise mechanisms through which armodafinil and modafinil 
promote wakefulness are unknown.  Both agents have shown similar pharmacologic properties in nonclinical animal and in vitro studies. 
• At pharmacologically relevant concentrations, arm odafinil does not bind to or inhibit 
several receptors and enzymes potentially relevant for sleep/wake regulation.  
Armodafinil is not a direct- or indirect -acting dopamine receptor agonist.  Armodafinil 
has wake- promoting actions similar to sympathomimetic agents, but the 
pharmacologic profile is not identical to that of the sympathomimetic amines.  
• Armodafinil has been classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance.  Investigators who prescribe this agent must have an up -to-date Controlled Substance Registration 
Certificate.  The agent must be stored in compliance with state and federal regulations  
related to Schedule IV controlled substances.    
15.1.2 Formulation 
Alliance A221101 
NCI Version Date: 9/24/2018  Update  #7 
38 Commercial armodafinil (Nuvigil®) tablets contain 50, 150 or 250 mg of armodafinil and 
the following inactive ingredients: croscarmellose sodium, lactose monohydrate, 
magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, povidone, and pregelatinized starch.  
15.1.3 Preparation and storage:  
Armodafinil (Nuvigil®) tablets are stored at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F) 
15.1.4 Administration:   
Armodafinil will be taken as a single dose in the morning.  Food delays absorption, but this 
has minimal effects on bioavailability.  Armodafinil may therefore be taken w ithout regard 
to food intake. If the patient misses a dose, the tablet  can be taken that day as long as it is 
atleast 12 hours before the next dose.   
15.1.5 Pharmacokinetic information:  
a) Absorption – Readily absorbed.  
b) Distribution –Vd: 42L.  Approximately 60% protein bound, primarily to albumin 
(based on modafinil) 
c) Metabolism –Hepatic, via multiple pathways, including CYP3A4/5.  Metabolites 
include R -modafinil acid and modafinil sulfone.  Clearance is 33 mL/minute, mainly 
via hepatic metabolism.  Half- life elimination is 15 hours.  Steady state is reached at 
approximately 7 days.  The time to peak concentration (fasting) is 2 hours.  
d) Excretion – Urinary (80%, predominantly as metabolites); < 10% as unchanged drug. 
15.1.6 Potential Drug Interactions:  
Armodafinil is a major substrate of CYP3A4.  Dosage adjustment should be considered for concomitant medications that are substrates for CYP3A4/5, such as steroidal 
contraceptives, triazolam, and cyclosporine.  Armodafinil is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C19.  Drugs that are largely eliminated via CYP2C19 metabolism, such as diazepam, 
propranolol, and phenytoin may have prolonged elimination upon coadministration with 
armodafinil, and may require dosage reduction and monitoring for toxicity.

developed mitral valve prolapse syndrome with previous CNS stimulant use.  
Angioedema and hypersensitivity (with rash, dysphagia, and bronchospasm) have been observed with armodafinil. Small average increases in mean systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure were seen in patients with narcolepsy taking armodafinil when compared to 
placebo.  
Serious and life -threatening rashes including Stevens -Johnson syndrome, toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_7387], and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms have been reported 
with modafinil, the racemate of armodafinil.  Most cases have been reported within the 
first 5 weeks of therapy.  
In pre -approval narcolepsy, OSA and SWD controlled trials of armodafinil, anxiety, 
agitation, nervousness, irritability, and de pression were reasons for treatment

39 discontinuation more often than for placebo. Cases of suicide ideation were also observed 
in clinical trials.  
The use of armodafinil may impair the ability to engage in potentially hazardous activities.  
The agent should be administered at a reduced dose for patients with severe hepatic 
impairment.  There is inadequate information to determine the safety and efficacy of dosing 
patients with severe renal impairment.  Elimination of the agent and its metabolites may be reduc ed in elderly patients.  Consideration should be given to the use of lower doses in this 
population. 
Headaches are dose related and reported in > 10% of patients.  Adverse reactions reported 
in 4 to 10% of patients include nausea (dose related), dizziness, insomnia (dose related), 
anxiety, and diarrhea. Adverse events reported in < 4% of patients include: depression 
(dose related), dyspepsia, fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], rash (dose related), upper abdominal pain, 
agitation, anorexia, constipation, contact [CONTACT_8748], decreased appetite, depressed mood,

testing upon the basis of promising information in the proposed trial. 
The three arm randomized trial will accrue a maximum of 330 patients to randomize a 100 
evaluable patients per arm based on a binary endpoint to armodafinil or placebo.   
Bayesian adaptive “shadow” design: Bayes clinical trial designs are becomingly increasingly 
more popular as alternatives to classic Fisherian designs, especially in the phase I context (110). They have not, however, been applied to c ancer control cooperative group clinical trials. As a 
feasibility exercise, we will use the results of this trial to “shadow” what would have happened if the Bayes design would have been used. This will provide us insights into the relative utility 
of the Bayes design within the context of cooperative group cancer control clinical trials. The 
potential advantage of the Bayes approach is that the study likelihood of efficacy is constantly 
monitored allowing for the possibility of early study completion and t herefore a smaller number 
of patients put at risk (see MD Anderson Cancer Center Technical Report UTMDABTR -002-06 
(98). There are a number of logistical and statistical issues that were raised in the review of the 
concept (which initially proposed a Bayes design) that we decided it would be more prudent to 
use a classic Fisherian design to run the trial and use a shadow design to obtain preliminary data 
for planning future cancer control clinical trials using a Bayes approach. The details for the Bayes 
design are attached as Appendix X. 
16.2 Sample Size  
On average, we recruit six patients per month for GBM treatment trials.  For symptom control 
studies with heterogeneous populations, such as N05C7 (Concerta), we were able to average [ADDRESS_341827] rapid accrual.  Therefore, for this study, a reasonable conservative estimate for this more homogeneous population would be 8 patients a month. With 330 patients, accrual 
would be completed in 41 months. 
The randomized design to be utilized is described below.  Based on our previous work, we 
estimate that the response rate for the placebo arm will be 10%.  We design the study with 100 
patients per arm so that the Fisher’s exact test will have 80% power to detect a response rate of 
25% with a two -tailed alternative and a 5% Type I error rate for each treatment comparison to 
the placebo. Again, we are not using a conservative multiple contrasts approach because we want 
to err on the side of accepting a modest armodafinil effect. We plan to accrue an additional 30 
patients to account for patient cancellations, ineligibility, or major treatment violations.  
Therefore, there will be a maximum of 330 patients accrued to this study unless undue adverse events are encountered.  
16.3 Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint of this trial is the response rate in terms of a clinically meaningful 
improvement in patient -reported fatigue at 8 weeks.  A response is defined as an improvement 
of 2 points on the 0-10 scale of the usual fatigue on the BFI.  
Alliance A221101 
NCI Version Date: 9/24/2018  Update  #[ADDRESS_341828] cycle of treatment will be 
evaluable for the primary endpoint.  Patients will be analyzed according to the arm in which they 
were randomized. 
Comparison of the primary endpoint between arms will be based on a binomial point estimate 
computed for each arm and a Fisher’s exact test will be the inferential hypothesis test.  
16.4 Secondary Endpoints  
16.4.1  Other time points:  The same analyses carried out using the 8 week assessment data will 
be used for analysis of data from the other time point assessments.  
16.4.2 Other fatigue measures:  The other fatigue items (“usual”, “usual” and “now”) as well as 
the impact of fatigue items from the BFI, the PRO -CTCAE, and the summated score from 
the PROMIS fatigue measure will be analyzed separately in turn comparing the average of these variables for each treatment using Kruskal -Wallis testing for change from baseline 
to four weeks, AUC over the entire treatment period, and repeated measures ANOVA using all treatments and all time points.  
16.4.3 Cognitive function:  The same analyses outlined for the other fatigue measures will be 
carried out for each of the cognitive function tests.   
16.4.4 Quality of life: The same analytical approaches will be used to compare the three 
treatments in terms of QOL as was outlined for the other fatigue measures.  
16.4.5 Safety and tolerability of armodafinil:  Comparison of the proportion of patients 
reporting adverse events via the CTCAE items will be compared across treatment arms using a Fisher’s exact test.  
16.4.6 Area under the curve  (AUC) and summary statistics:  For the continuous measures 
mentioned above, AUC summary statistics will be generated for each patient to represent 
the overall experience reported by [CONTACT_280096] (e.g. fatigue) by [CONTACT_280097], weeks 4, and 8 assessment points. The average of these AUC 
variables will be compared between the two treatment arms using two -sample t -tests. 
Further summary statistics will be constructed for the categorical variables to indicate 
whether the patient ever responded over the entire treatment period. These categorical 
variables will be compared between treatment groups via Fisher’s exact tests.  
16.4.7 Repeated measures analysis: The overall experimental layout will be examined via the 
construction of a  repeated measures model using data from all assessment time points 
involving the continuous variables described above. Tests for time by [CONTACT_280098]. Covariates such as age, 
gende r and other clinical variables may be included to test their impact on the initial 
efficacy tests of the primary and secondary analyses described above.  Use of the Optune® 
device will also be included as a descriptive factor.  
16.4.8 Logistic regression an alysis: The overall experimental layout will be examined via the 
construction of a logistic regression model using the categorical response variables described above. This will allow for the characterization of the demographic and clinical variables’ impact on the identification of a patient as a responder per the above definition.

randomize a maximum of 330 e valuable patients to one of three treatment arms.   
Efficacy stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]:  This study will be monitored by [CONTACT_280100] (DSMB) every 6 months for safely and efficacy. If at any time prior to full accrual the p -
value for the Fisher’s exact test that an arm is superior to the other arm given all available data 
falls below 0.[ADDRESS_341830] of the trial and in consideration of 
newly acquired information  regarding the adverse event profile of the treatment(s) under 
investigation.  The study team may choose to suspend accrual because of unexpected adverse 
event profiles that have not crossed the specified rule below.  
Accrual will be temporarily suspended to this study if at any time we observe grade [ADDRESS_341831] possibly related to study treatment (i.e. an adverse event with attribute 
specified as  “possible”, “probable”, or “definite”) that satisfy the following:  
• If [ADDRESS_341832] 20 treated patients (or 10% of all patients after 20 are 
accrued) experience a Grade 4 or higher non- hematologic adverse event and the adverse 
event rate is higher on either armodafinil arm than the placebo. 
We note that we will review Grade 4 and 5 adverse events deemed “unrelated” or “unlikely to be 
related”, to verify their attribution and to monitor the emergence of a previously unrecognized 
treatment -related adverse event.  
16.7 Study Monitoring  
This study will be monitored by [CONTACT_941] C linical Data Update System (CDUS) version 3.0.  
Cumulative CDUS data will be submitted quarterly to CTEP by [CONTACT_10075].  Reports are 
due January 31, April 30, July 31, and October 31.  Instructions for submitting data using the CDUS can be found on t he CTEP web site  
The principal investigator(s) and the study statistician will review the study at least twice a year 
to identify accrual, adverse event, and any endpoint problems that might be developi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  This 
study will be monitored by [CONTACT_280101] (DSMB), an NCI -
approved functioning body.  Reports containing efficacy, adverse event, and administrative 
information will be provided to the DSMB every six months as per NCI guidelines. 
16.7.1 We will further carry out a single interim analysis when 30 patients per treatment arm are 
evaluable for the primary endpoint. We will use this interim analysis to verify that the 250 
mg. dose arm is worthy of further accrual. If the cond itional probability is less than 1% that 
the effect size is at least of moderate size given, the results (effect size) at that point, the [ADDRESS_341833] approaches.  Multiple approaches are used 
so that the sensitivity of results to alteration in imputational assumptions may be assessed. The

A Phase III Randomized, Double -Blind Placebo Controlled Study of 
Armodafinil (Nuvigil®) To Reduce Cancer -Related Fatigue in Patients with 
High Grade Glioma 
 
This is an important form.  Please read it carefully.  It tells you what you need to know about this 
research study.  If you agree to take part in this study, you need to sign this form.  Your signature 
[CONTACT_280114].  Your signature [CONTACT_280115].  
This is a clinical trial, a type of research study.  Your study doctor will explain the clinical trial to you.   Clinical trials include only people who choose to take part. Please take your time to make your decision about taking part.  You may discuss your decision with your friends and family.  You can also discuss it with your health care team.  If you have any questions, you can ask your study doctor for more explanation.  
You are being asked to take part in this study because you are experiencing fatigue that is related 
to your cancer. Cancer related fatigue is a very common symptom in people with cancer.   
 
Why is this study being done?  
The purpose of this study is to:   
• See if taking the study agent, armodafinil, at a dose of 150mg or 250mg, will improve 
problems with fatigue in patients who have been diagnosed with cancer and are experiencing 
fatigue.  
• See the effects (good and bad) of taking Armodafinil compared to placebo (an inactive agent) 
on cancer related fatigue.  
In this study, you will take either the study agent, armodafinil, or the placebo (inactive agent).  You will not take both.   
Armodafinil (Nuvigil®) is a medicine that is currently FDA approved to promote wakefulness in 
people who have sleep disorders.  However, it is not been studied in people with cancer related fatigue.   
 
How many people will take part in the study?  
About 330 people will take part in this study.

54 What will happen if I take part in this research study?   
Before you begin the study…  
You will need to have the following exams, tests or procedures to find out if you can be in the 
study.  These exams, tests or procedures are part of regular cancer care and may be done even if you do not join the study.  If you have had some of them recently, they may not need to be repeated.  This will be up to your study doctor. 
• Medical history (questions about your health and any medications you are taking), including 
weight and rating of how well you perform activities of daily living.  
• General neurological examination  
• Pregnancy test, if you have not already had one done and your doctor thinks this is needed  
(if you are a female and able to become pregnant)  
 
During the study…  
You will have already had radiation therapy or surgery for your cancer.   
Before you start taking the study agent, armodafinil or placebo, you will complete a booklet of 
questionnaires.  This booklet contains [ADDRESS_341845] (memory and concentration skills test).  This 
will be done three times; once before you start taking the study agent, once at [ADDRESS_341846], you will be asked some questions about your memory and concentration by [CONTACT_280104].  This testing will be done at your doctor’s office, and will take about 20-30 minutes to complete.   
You will be "randomized" into one of the study groups described below. Randomization means that you are put into a group by [CONTACT_3364]. A computer program will place you in one of the study groups.  Neither you nor your doctor can choose the group you will be in.  You will have a one in three chance of being placed in any group.  
If you are in group 1, you will take a dose of the armodafinil (150 mg) by [CONTACT_1966], every day in the morning.  You will take this every day for 8 weeks.   
If you are in group 2, you will take a dose of the placebo pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] (inactive ingredient) by 
[CONTACT_1966], every day in the morning.  You will take this every day for 8 weeks.   
If you are in group 3, you will take a dose of the armodafinil (250 mg) by [CONTACT_1966], every

How long will I be in the study?

It is important to tell the study doctor if you are thinking about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_280046], armodafinil, can be evaluated by [CONTACT_4904].  Another reason to tell your doctor that you are thinking about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_60769]-up care and testing could be most helpful for you. 
The study doctor may stop you from taking part in this study at any time if he/she believes it is in 
your best interest; if you do not follow the study rules; or if the study is stopped. 
 
What side effects or risks can I expect from being in the study?  
You may have side effects while on the study.  Everyone taking part in the study will be watched 
carefully for any side effects.  However, doctors don’t know all the side effects that may happen.  Side effects may be mild or very serious. Your health care team may give you medicines to help 
lessen side effects. Many side effects go away soon after you stop taking the study agent.  In some cases, side effects can be serious, long lasting, or may never go away.  
You should talk to your study doctor about any side effects that you have while taking part in the study.

81 “You will have a minute for each letter. The first letter is ‘___’ (see scoring sheet).  
 
**Allow exactly one minute for each letter**  
 • If the patient discontinues before the end of the time period, encourage him/her to try to think of 
more words.  
• If he/she is silent for 15 seconds, repeat the basic instruction and the letter (e.g., “Tell me all the 
words you can think of that begin with a “c”). 
• No extension on the time limit is made in the event that instructions are repeated.  
• Continue the evaluation with the remaining two letters, allowing one minute for each.  
 
Recording and Scoring:  
•  The COWA provides lines on which the patient’s responses can be entered (e.g.,write in the word that is said by [CONTACT_102]). If his/her speed of word productio n is too fast to 
permit verbatim recording, a “+” should be entered to indicate a correct response.  
•  Incorrect responses either should not be recorded or, if recorded, should be struck through 
with a line.  
•  If the patient provides more responses than there are lines on the record sheet, place check 
marks in the boxes to indicate correct responses only.  
•  Count all the correct responses. The number of correct words should be indicated below each column.  
 Comments on scoring:  
•  Note: It can be helpful for the first several patients and for patients known to be fast with 
their word production to tape record the session for transcription at a later time.  
•  The instructions include a specific prohibition against giving proper names or different forms of th e same word. Therefore, inflections of the same word (e.g., eat -eating; mouse -
mice; loose-loosely; ran- run-runs) are not considered correct responses.  
•  Patients often give both a verb and a word derived from the verb or adjective (e.g., fun -
funny; sad- sadness). These are not considered correct responses. On the other hand, if the 
word refers to a specific object (e.g., foot -footstool; hang- hanger), it would be counted as a 
correct answer.  
•  Many words have two or more meanings (e.g., foot; can; catch; hand). A repetition of the 
word is acceptable IF the patient definitely indicates the alternative meaning to you.  
•  Slang terms are OK if they are in general use.        
•  Foreign words (for example, pasta; passé; lasagna) can be counted as correct if they can be 
considered part of the lexicon of the relevant language, the criterion being their listing in a 
standard dictionary of that language. All incorrect and repeated responses MUST be crossed out with one single line, initialed and dated. Additionally, a ll duplicate entries that 
have been verified to have different meanings must be marked “ok”, initialed and dated. Refer to the descriptions above for guidelines for acceptability. Add the total number of 
correct responses in each column and input the totals where indicated on the COWA 
worksheet.  
•  If the test is discontinued or omitted, please mark this on the bottom of the test form.

Part A – Sample:   
 The Sample for Part A must be completed/attempted by [CONTACT_280107]. 
Place the Sample A worksheet flat on the table, directly in front of the patient (the bottom 
of the worksheet should be approximately six inches from the edge of the table). Give the 
patient a black pen and say:  
  Examiner: “On this page (point) are some numbers. Begin at number 1 (point to 1) and draw a line 
from 1 to 2 (point to 2), 2 to 3 (point to 3), 3 to 4 (point to 4), and so on, in order, until you reach  the end (point to the circle marked END). Draw the lines as fast as you can. Ready, 
begin.”  
  If the patient completes Sample A correctly and in a manner demonstrating that s/he 
understands what to do, proceed immediately to Test A. If the patient makes a  mistake on 
Sample A, point out the error and explain it.  
 
 The following explanations of mistakes serve as illustrations:  
  • “This is where you start (point to number 1)” 
  • “You skipped this circle (point to the circle omitted)”  
  • “You should go from  number [ADDRESS_341868] 
 marked END”  
 
 If it is clear that the patient intended to touch a circle but missed it, do not count it as an omission.  Remind the patient, however, to be sure to touch the circles. If the patient still 
cannot complete Sample A, take his/her hand and guide him/her through the trail using the opposite end of the pen, lightly touching the worksheet to avoid making marks on the 
copy. Then say: 
 Examiner: “Remember, begin at number 1 (point to 1 ) and draw a line from 1 to 2 (point 
to 2), 2 to 3 (point to 3), 3 to 4 (point to 4) and so on, in order, until you reach the circle marked END (point). Do not skip around, but go from one number to the next in proper 
order. Remember to work as fast as you  can. Ready, begin.” 
  If the patient does not succeed, or it becomes evident that s/he cannot do the task, DISCONTINUE testing and indicate the corresponding reason on the Trail Making A & B 
Scoring (TMABS) sheet. If the patient completes Sample A correct ly and appears to 
understand what to do, proceed immediately to Part A.  
 
Part A – Test:   
 After the patient has completed Sample A, place the Part A test worksheet directly in front of the patient and say:  
 Examiner: “Good! Let’s try the next one. On this page are numbers from [ADDRESS_341869]. Begin at number 1 (point) and draw a line from 1 to 2 (point to 2), 2 to 3 
(point to 3), 3 to 4 (point to 4) and so on, in order, until you reach the circle marked END 
(point). Do not skip around, but go from one number to the next in proper order.  
 Remember to work as fast as you can. Ready, begin.”

•  Start timing as soon as the instruction is given to “begin.”  
•  Watch closely in order to catch any errors as soon as they are made. If t he patient makes 
an error, call it to his/her attention immediately and have him/her proceed from the point 
the mistake occurred  (In other words, have them go back to the last correct circle ). 
•  The patient must complete the test in 3 minutes or less  
•  DO NOT STOP TIMING UNTIL HE/SHE REACHES THE CIRCLE MARKED “END.”  
•  If the patient does not complete the test within [ADDRESS_341870] can 
also be discontinued if the patient is extremely confused and is unable to perform the task. 
Complete the Trail Making A & B Scoring (TMABS) sheet indicating the reason the test 
was terminated  and the last correct number reached on the test.  
•  If the patient successfully completes the test, record the time to completion on the Trail 
Making A & B Scoring (TMABS) sheet in minutes and seconds. Then say, “That’s fine. 
Now we’ll try another one.” 
 
Part B – Sample:  
 The Sample for Part B must be completed/attempted by [CONTACT_280107]. 
Place the Sample B worksheet flat on the table, directly in front of the patient (the bottom of the worksheet should be approximately six inches from the edge of the table) and say:  
 Examiner: “On this page (point) are some numbers and letters. Begin at number 1 (point to 1) and draw a line from 1 to A (point), A to 2 (point to 2), 2 to B (point to B), B to 3 
(point to 3), 3 to C (point to C) and so on, in order, until you reach the end (point to the 
circle marked END). Remember, first you have a number (point to 1), then a letter (point to A), then a numbe r (point to 2), then a letter (point to B), and so on. Draw the lines as fast 
as you can. Ready, begin.” 
 
 If the patient completes Sample B correctly, and in a manner demonstrating that s/he 
understands what to do, proceed immediately to Part B. If the patient makes a mistake on Sample B, point out the error and explain it.  
 The following explanations of mistakes serve as illustrations:  
• “You started with the wrong circle. This is where you start (point to number 1)”  
• “You skipped this circle (point to t he circle omitted)”  
• “You should go from number 1 (point) to A (point), A to 2 (point to 2), 2 to B (point to B), B to 3

86 APPENDIX X:  BAYES SHADOW STATISTICAL DESIGN  
Bayes Shadow Statistical Design 
 
The primary endpoint for the trial is the response rate in terms of a clinically meaningful 
improvement in patient-reported fatigue, defined as at least a two -point improvement in fatigue as 
measured by [CONTACT_280108] 8 weeks, and the design proposed for this study will randomize a minimum of 30 evaluable patients and a maximum of 120 evaluable patients to one of three treatment arms The Bayesian adaptive randomization design  (98) 
will work as follows The first 30 patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 fashion to the three treatment arms (block size of 30 will be used to guarantee an equal number of patient s are 
randomized to each treatment arm).  After the [ADDRESS_341872] on the trial results.  
 
Adaptive randomization:  We assume that the fatigue response outcome, denoted Xi,j, of patient i 
on treatment j derives from a Binomial(π j) distribution ( j=1 for placebo; j=2 for armodafinil 150 
mg).  We assume that π j derives from a Beta ( αj, βj) distribution.  Given limited historical data, we 
use a uniform non -informative prior for each arm (α 1=α2=1; β1=β2=1). We repeat this calculation 
for the comparison of the placebo versus the armodafinil [ADDRESS_341873] 
between the two treatments (where p
j = probability that treatment j is better than the other treatment) 
and assigns th e patient to arm j with probability pj (i.e., λ=1 in the notation of Cook [100]).  This 
procedure uses all observed fatigue response data at the time of the patient’s randomization to 
unbalance the randomization probabilities in favor of the treatment arm having comparatively 
superior symptom response outcomes. 
 
Efficacy stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]:  If at any time prior to full accrual the probability that an arm is superior 
to the other arm given all available data falls below 0.05 (P L in the notation of the Adaptive 
Randomization software used below), that arm is suspended (though it potentially could reopen 
should the results on the other arm substantially worsen).  If at any time prior to full accrual the 
probability that an arm is superior to the other arm given all available data rises above 0.95 (P U in 
the notation of the Adaptive Randomization software used below), that arm is declared the winner and the trial is stopped early.  
 
Decision rule:  If the trial runs through completion without early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_280049] 0.80 (P U* in the notation of the Adaptive Randomization software used below), then that 
treatment is declared the winner of the trial.

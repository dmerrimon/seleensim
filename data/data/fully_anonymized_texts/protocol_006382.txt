Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_128261], MD 
Funding Source:  TIGERS Grant – University of Missouri School of Medicine 
 
Clinical Trial Phase:  Phase IV 
Clinicaltrials.gov Number:  MCT04644796 
Study Drug/Study Device: Liposomal Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (Exparel) 
 
 
 
 
1. Primary Objective:  
a. Establish a relationship between liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_128262]. 
2. Secondary Objectives: 
a. How does self-reported pain (11 point visual analog pain scale) differ in patients 
given liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_128263]? 
b. Is there a difference in length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_128264]. 
3. Background: 
a. Lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_128265] a posterior approach are major surgeries that 
generally entail a significant amount dissection, even with minimally invasive 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_128266]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_128267], most patients will still require some form of opi[INVESTIGATOR_128268] a period of time.  
b. Multiple studies have shown that people who are taking opi[INVESTIGATOR_128269] a greater likelihood of long-term opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]. Furthermore, the greater the 
initial opi[INVESTIGATOR_5437], the greater the risk of long-term use, abuse, and overdose. 
Studies have shown that patients who are given doses of opi[INVESTIGATOR_128270] [ADDRESS_144734] been made to reduce postop pain and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], including 
developments in incisional site injections of local anesthetics, continuous 
incisional site anesthetic pain pumps, as well as multimodal comprehensive pain 
management, yet patients undergoing lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_128271].  
d. Liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (LB) is a novel formulation of long-acting bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], 
lasting for up to 72 hours following injection. LB has been shown to be I. Research Objectives /Background  
Page [ADDRESS_144735] 5 years, one of our spi[INVESTIGATOR_128272], targeting the paraspi[INVESTIGATOR_6845]. 
Retrospective data was collected in a historic chart review between 2014 – [ADDRESS_144736] 72 hours postop. 
f. Given our promising results from an observational study, it is our goal to advance 
our study to a double blind, randomized trial to determine the efficacy of 
liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_128273].  
 
 
 
 
1. Liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (Exparel) 266mg/20mL, Intramuscular, single dose 
intraoperatively. 
2. Liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_14072] a long-acting local anesthetic, lasting for up to [ADDRESS_144737] for this study because it has the benefit of providing long-acting 
analgesia, which especially beneficial in studying the immediate postoperative period for 
pain relief. 266mg/20mL is considered to be the maximum safe dose administered IM, 
without diluting the solution with saline.  
3. The standard reference therapy will be a saline placebo. There is currently no local 
anesthetic utilized upon surgical site closure as a standard of care for lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_128274]. For this reason, we want to determine if the use of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_128275]-op compared to no liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]. 
4. Include justification and safety information. 
5. Liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_128276]. In order to 
blind the surgeons from treatment vs control, the syringes containing the medication or 
saline will be sheathed by [CONTACT_128312].  
 
 
 
1. Patients will be recruited from The Missouri Orthopedic Institute  (MOI) during routine 
outpatient clinic evaluations for lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_128277]. Surgical procedures will be 
performed either at MOI or University of Missouri Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
2. Both male and female patients will be considered for this study. Any patient over the age 
of [ADDRESS_144738] safety precautions according to University of Missouri Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_128278]. These precautions include wearing appropriate 
PPE (approved masks and eyewear) and social distancing 6 feet apart whenever possible. 
4. All patients will be screened for COVID-19 prior to surgery within 14 days of the day of 
surgery, in accordance with University of Missouri Guidelines. 
 III. Recruitment Process  
IV. Consent Process  II. Drugs/Biologics/Devices 
Page 3 of 8  
 
1. Patients will be given a short survey to determine eligibility for the study. 
2. For patients who are eligible to be enrolled in the study, consent will be obtained from 
the authorized clinical research staff.  
3. Recruitment is completely voluntary, and it is the patient’s right to revoke consent at any 
point in time during the study if they no longer wish to participate.

1. Using data taken from Tomov et al 2018, a power analysis was conducted to test 
differences in mean total opi[INVESTIGATOR_128284] [ADDRESS_144739] framework.  Using a treatment mean 
total opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] (in morphine equivalent mg) of 231.4mg and control mean of 273.9mg, 
with pooled standard deviation of 40.0mg, at least 15 subjects per treatment group are 
required (30 total).  As follow-up for this study is shortly after surgery (and all during 
LOS), an adjustments were made for study attrition to allow for enrollment up to [ADDRESS_144740]-op.

Page 4 of 8  
 
1. Randomization of study group vs control group will be done independently by 
[CONTACT_128313]. Vials of the medication vs sterile saline will be 
blinded with labels that are able to be scanned into the system so that only investigational 
drug study personnel know which patients belong to each arm. In order to blind the 
surgeon, the syringes will be shielded due to the ability to visually differentiate the two 
treatments.  
2. All patients will be screened for COVID-19 per University of Missouri Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_128285]’s protocol (<14 days from day of surgery). 
3. All patients will undergo a standard induction and maintenance of general anesthesia 
balanced according to institutional protocols based on ASA guidelines: 
a. Anesthesia protocol (standard of care)  – All surgery will be performed 
with standard general anesthesia. Induction will be achieved, and general 
anesthesia maintained based on the following protocol (Doses vary based 
on patient specifics such as age, weight and comorbid disease): 
i. Lidocaine 50 – 100mg 
ii. Fentanyl 50 – 100mcg 
iii. Propofol 100 – 200 mg 
iv. Rocuronium 50 – 100mg 
b. Intraoperative (standard of care) 
i. Sevoflurane 1 – 2% or desflurane 4 – 6% 
ii. Fentanyl, hydromorphone, ketorolac and / or ketamine IV as 
needed on suspi[INVESTIGATOR_128286]. 
iii. antibiotics were given intravenously 2g of cefazolin or 900mg of 
clindamycin. 
4. All patients will receive the standard of care for indicated lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_128277]. 
5. Patients in the study group will receive liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_128287] 
(following fascial closure, but prior to superficial closure). LB should be injected slowly 
and deeply, infusing ~1-2 mL according to manufacture guidelines for infiltration. 
According to these guidelines, injection should utilize a moving needle technique (ie, 
inject while withdrawing the needle) at multiple locations surrounding the incision(s) to 
achieve maximal effect. Care will be taken to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_128288].  
6. Patients in the control group will utilize the same technique of injecting as the study 
group, however, with normal saline.  
7. If necessary, patients will be given additional pain medications to facilitate extubating 
following surgery. 
8. All patients will receive a standardized inpatient pain protocol based on ASA guidelines 
for acute pain management in the post-op period.  
a. MILD PAIN (score 1-4) 
i. Acetaminophen 1000mg PO q6hr PRN

9. Data collection: 
a. Inpatient opi[INVESTIGATOR_128289]. Outpatient opi[INVESTIGATOR_128290]. Patients who are discharged will be contact[CONTACT_128314]-up and compliance to 
study protocol. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_128291]-op day and converted to 
standard morphine milliequivalents (MME) for comparison.  
b. Visual analog pain scales will be collected from inpatients every hour for 
the first [ADDRESS_144741]-op. Patients who 
are discharged will be contact[CONTACT_128315]-up and compliance to study protocol. 
d. Patient length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_128292].  
e. Additionally, data for time in the operating room, time spent in the PACU,  
intraoperative complications (fracture, vascular injury, and anesthesia-
related), acute postoperative complications (medical, nerve injury, 
dislocation, hematoma, and wound complications), opi[INVESTIGATOR_40497] 
(nausea, hypoxia, increased O2 requirement, post-op ileus), and cost of 
local infiltrates will be collected from patient charts. 
10. Data analysis: 
a. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_9357], pain scores, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_128293]. The study and control 
groups will then be subdivided based on the type of procedure (single-
level lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_128294], single-level lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_128295], 
multi-level lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_128294], multi-level lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_128296] 6 of 8 fusion). Study and control patients will be analyzed using either unpaired 
t-test or Mann-Whitney U test depending on the data normality. 
b. Categorical data will be compared using chi-square test or Fisher’s Exact 
test.  
c. Data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_128316].  
d. Primary outcome: Opi[INVESTIGATOR_128297] 
e. Secondary outcomes: Visual analog pain score and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577] 
11. Patient removal criteria will include: 
a. Need to convert surgery to involve intradural space. 
b. Unintentional breach of intradural space.  
c. Patients with neurologic impairment following surgery, of which was not 
present prior to operation. 
d. Patient fails to comply with post-op instructions and limitations. 
12. The study will be ended prematurely if an obvious superiority of treatment group over 
control submerges during data analysis.  
 
 
 
1. Risks for surgery in both groups are no different from patients who are not enrolled in the 
study.  
2. General risks for lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_128298], infection, wound 
dehiscence, injury to surrounding structures, and lower extremity paresthesia or paralysis.  
3. Foreseeable discomfort will be no different from patients undergoing the same procedure 
who are not enrolled in the study. There will be foreseeable discomfort in perioperative 
pain, which will be minimized based on techniques outlined in the study procedures. 
4. Risk to patients given liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_128299], vomiting, constipation, 
unintentional intravascular injection which could result in dysrhythmias and depressed 
cardiac conductivity, in rare cases leading to death. Great care is taken during injection of 
the medication to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_128300]. 
Methemoglobinemia has been reported with use of local anesthetic. It’s important to note, 
however, that these rare, yet potentially life-threatening, complications are not unique to 
liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], rather these are risks associated with the drug class as a whole. 
5. If serious complications occur (cardiac, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], neurologic, hypoxemias, or other 
unanticipated serious complications), that are suspected by [CONTACT_128317][INVESTIGATOR_10319], these events will be reported to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_874] 24 hours 
of the event occurrence. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_128301] 5 
days of becoming aware of the event.  
 
 
 
1. Anticipated benefits to the patient will be potentially: 
a. less or equivalent post-operative pain  
b. Less need for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2454], decreasing individual risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_128302], chronic need for opi[INVESTIGATOR_22388], and risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_128303].  VIII. Potential Risks/Adverse Events  
IX. Anticipated Benefits  
Page 7 of 8 2. Anticipated benefit to society: 
a. Providing a long-acting postoperative pain modality to potentially reduce patient 
need for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. 
b. Less need for providers to prescribe opi[INVESTIGATOR_128304] a societal level. 
c. Less post-operative pain leads to earlier time to ambulation and shorter hospi[INVESTIGATOR_67550], ultimately moving lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_128305]-day outpatient procedures.

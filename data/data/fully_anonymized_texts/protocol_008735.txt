 a. Beyond this point, any potential SARS -CoV-2 particles in the saliva can be considered 
inactivated and could be handled without the plexiglass s hield or outside of a BSC.  
 
4) While saliva samples are being heat inactivated, prepar e the appropriate volume of the following 
Master Mix for the colorimetric RT-LAMP reactions:

5) Aliquot 17 ul of colorimetric RT-LAMP reaction mix in to a fresh set(s) of PCR strip-cap tubes. Prepare 
samples in duplicate for each saliva sample. Hold these LAMP reaction tubes in a cooler prior to adding 
heat-inactivated saliva samples. 
 
6) Add 3ul of heat -inactivated saliva (that is already diluted 1:1 in 1X P B) or add 1.5 ul of heat-inactivated 
saliva and 1.5ul of 1x PB S to the LAMP reaction.  The final four positions in each batch of LAMP 
reaction strip-cap tubes should be reserved for two neg ative and two positive controls, respectively.   
- The negative control  reactions should contain 3 ul water/PBS. 
 
- The positive contr ol reactions should include 1000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_270789]- CoV-2 virus that has 
been inactivated by [CONTACT_270793]. The vRNA i s prepared in a 50:50 mix of water 
and 1X PBS to a concentration of 333 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ul so that w e can add [ADDRESS_330191] saliva containing a concentration of 10^6 copi[INVESTIGATOR_270789]- CoV-2 per ml.  
 
7) Take a pi[INVESTIGATOR_270790] e RT-LAMP reaction. 
 
8) Incubate the colorimetric RT-LAMP reactions in a therm omixer or dry bath at 65℃ for 30 minutes while 
shaking if needed. 
  
9) Document any color changes at a 30-minute timepoint by [CONTACT_270794]-LAMP reactions 
against a prelabeled template on a white background. C olor change from pi[INVESTIGATOR_270791] a sample with SARS-CoV-2 RNA present. If the color change to yellow is only 
clear in one of two replicate saliva samples, the sample  will be scored as a potential finding of clinical 
significance. 
 
10) Once a session of RT-LAMP testing is completed, disinfect  all lab equipment with 10% bleach wipes 
followed by 70% EtOH spray. Collect all used pi[INVESTIGATOR_270792],  plasticware, wipes, PPE, etc. in a biohazard

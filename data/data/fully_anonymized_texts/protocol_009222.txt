6.3.1  Administration  Regimens  
 
This study will include 2 cohorts each consisting of 7 participants for a total of 14 
study participants.  The second  cohort will receive an escalated or reduced dose 
of the  continuous study medication until a target peak goal citrulline 
concentration of 100 µmol/L is achieved.  Each cohort will receive a single IV 
dose of L -citrulline administered as a single bolus infusion  over a 5 minute period  
and then a continuous infusion for 23  hours. 
 
Cohort 1 will receive 20 mg/kg of study medication  and then a continuous rate of 
7 mg/ kg/hour for 23  hours .   After pharmacokinetic data and safety profile  
(toxicity)  is analyzed for cohort 1, the dosage for cohort 2 will change as follows:  
 
1. Higher continuous dose: IV citrulline 20 mg/kg bolus infusion followed by 9 
mg/kg/hour for 23 hours OR  
 
2. Lower continuous dose: IV citrulline 20 mg/kg bolus infusion followed by 5 
mg/kg/hour for [ADDRESS_849652] Updated: 01/10/[ADDRESS_849653] req uirements. L -citrulline will be supplied from th e 
pharmacy as open label vials, and  administered as a 50 mg/mL (5%) isotonic 
solution, wit h distilled water as a suspending agent.

(trough levels) , 10 minutes after the bolus  (peak level) , and then 30 minutes, 1 hour, 
2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours , 6 hours , 8 hours, 12 hours   and 24 hours after the bolus  
infusion.   
 
 
7.3 Collection and Processing of Blood Samples  
 
Ten ml of venous blood will be collected in collection tubes containing citrate or 
EDTA. Samples will be kept on ice and processed within 3 hours after collection. 
Specimens will be centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min and plasm a collected and 
stored at –80ºC. Samples will be sh ipped by [CONTACT_635821], Center for Genetic Medicine Research at the Children’s National Medical 
Center  for amino acid testing, and Paresh Ray, PhD at Jackson State University for 
nitric oxide testing.  
 
 
8.[ADDRESS_849655] Updated: 01/10/2019   
Briefly, deproteinated  plasma samples will be subjected to cation exchange 
chromatography using a 4 -component pH and ionic strength graded lithium citrate 
buffer system on a Beckmann 7300 amino acid analyzer (Beckmann, Palo Alto, 
CA).  Arginine and citrulline  will be the main f ocus  as measurable products of urea 
cycle function , but will measure all urea cycle intermediates. In addition, the level of 
total essential amino acids (TEEA) to control for overall nutrition and metabolic stat e 
will be calculated. Analysis of amino acids  will be complete d as previously 
described . 
 
8.4 Nitric Oxide Assay  
 
NO will be measured by [CONTACT_635822] a Sievers 280 nitric oxide 
analyzer (NOA). Samples are mixed one part sample with two parts of cold ethanol 
at 00C for 30 minutes. Following centrifugation at [ZIP_CODE] RPM for 5 min, samples 
are injected into the NOA. This method relies on catalytic reduction of NOx by 
[CONTACT_635823]. Liberated NO is driven by [CONTACT_635824].  Light released by [CONTACT_288725]/O3 - interaction is captured by a 
photomultiplier tube and relayed to an analytical software program. A standard 
curve using sodium nitrite is required.  
 
8.5 Pharmacokinetic analysis  
 
Data obtained for each patient will be fit to a single -compartment pharmacokinetic 
model.   The appearance of citrulline in plasma is described by a zero -order process 
(rate of citrulline appearance, R app) to account for endogenous production, whereas 
the removal of citrulline is determined by a first -order process (constant of citrulline 
removal, k rem). It is assumed that the values of all parameters will remain constant 
for each patient during the course of plasma sampling. Origin   (OriginLab 
Corporation, Northhampton, MA) will be used to solve for the pharmacokinetic 
parameters using a weighted, least squares procedure to obtain simultaneous 
values for R app, Co (plasma concentration at time zero), k rem, and AUC (area under 
the curve).The volume of distribu tion (V d)  will be calculated from the total dose/C o 
and the half -life from 0.693/k rem. Clearance will be calculated from k rem multiplied by 
[CONTACT_941] V d. 
 
[ADDRESS_849656] safety will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_12902] (see section 10 for full detail), c linical laboratory tests, vital 
signs and physical examinations.  
 
8.2 Clinical Parameters  
 Vital Signs  
Page [ADDRESS_849657] Updated: 01/10/2019   
Vital signs (temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], blood pressure and heart rate) 
will be collected prior to the initiation of study drug and prior to each blood 
sample collection at 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 
hours, 6 hours , 8, 12 hours  and 24 hours after the infusion.  
 
 Physical Examination  
 
A complete physical examination will be performed during the screening 
period.  If the drug infusion  occurs on a different day than the screening 
procedures are performed, then an abbreviated physical examination will 
be completed prior to the drug infusion.  A follow up complete physical 
examination will be performed at 24 hours  after the end of the inf usion.  
 
 
8.3 Laboratory Parameters  
 
Laboratory parameters will be evaluated at screening and then at 24 hours at 
completion of  infusion and then at 30  days after the infusion to include the 
following:  
 
 Complete Blood Count (white blood cell count, hemoglobin, MCV, platelet 
count)  
 Renal Function (Sodium, potassium, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), HCO3, 
Creatinine)  
 Liver Function (Alkaline phosphatase, aspartate transferase, alanine 
transferase, and total bilirubin) .  
 
9 Adverse /Serious Adverse  Events  
 
9.2 Adverse Event  (AE) Definition  
 
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject 
administered a pharmaceutical  product that does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment.  AE may be reported by [CONTACT_423], discovered 
by [CONTACT_334956], or detected through physical examination, laboratory 
test, or other means.   
 
At each evaluation, subject will  be interviewed to elicit potential ad verse reactions 
from the drug . The o ccurrence of an AE will be based on changes in the subject’s 
physical examination, laboratory results, and/or signs and symptoms. All AEs 
(except Grade 1 and 2 laboratory abnormalities that do not require an 
intervention), regard less of causal relationship , will be recorded in the case 
reporting form ( CRF) and source docu mentation. The Investigator will  determine 
the intensity of any AE according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Page [ADDRESS_849658] Updated: 01/10/2019  Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.03 (see http://ctep.info.nih.gov) an d their 
causal  relationship.  
 
In this phase [ADDRESS_849659] who has an AE will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_635825].  The investigator or 
designated study physicians will review each event and assess its relationship to 
the drug treatment (unrelated, possibly related, or probably related)  based on the 
following definitions:  
 
10.2.1. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
 
An AE or suspected AE is considered serious if , in the view the Investigator , it 
results in any of the following outcome  
 
1. Death;  
 
2. A life -threatening adverse event;  
 
3. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3850], 
excluding  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_635818];  
 
4. A persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
 
5. Congenital anomaly/birth defect; or  
 
6. Other events that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may 
jeopardize the subject  and may require medical or surgic al intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed  above.  
 
10.2.2 . Unexpected Adverse Event  
 
An AE is considered unexpected if it is not described in the Investigator’s 
Brochure or if it is of  greater frequency and/or severity than mentioned in the 
Investigator’s Brochure. Unexpected, as  used in this definition, refers to an 
adverse drug event that has not been previously observed rather than from the 
Page [ADDRESS_849660] Updated: 01/10/[ADDRESS_849661].  
 
10.2.3 . Relationship  
 
The Investigator will assess the relationship of the event (not -related, unlikely -
related, possibly  related, probably related, or definit ely related) . The relationship  
of an adverse event will be assessed  using the following definitions:  
 
Not Related: Evidence exists that the adverse event definitely has an etiology 
other than the  investigational agent, such as a pre -existing condition or 
underlying disease, a concurrent  illness, or concomitant medication, and does 
not meet any of the criteria above.  
 
Unlikely: The causality of the AE is supported by [CONTACT_635826].  
 
Possibly Related: A temporal relationship exists betwe en the event’s onset and 
investigational agent administration. Although the event may appear unlikely to 
be related to  the investigational agent, a relationship cann ot be ruled out with 
certainty, and/or the  event cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical 
state or concomitant treatment.  
 
Probably Related: A temporal relationship exists between the event’ s onset and 
investigational agent administration, and  the event appears with some degree of 
certainty to  be related to  investigational agent , based on the investigational 
agent’s known  therapeutic and pharmacologic actions. The event cannot be 
readily explained by [CONTACT_19578]’s clinical state or concomitant treatment. If the 
investigational agent is discontinued  or the dose is reduced the event abates or 
resolves.  
 
Definitely Related: Strong e vidence exists that the investigational agent caused 
the adverse event. There is a temporal relationship betwe en the e vent’s onset 
and investigational agent administration, and strong therapeutic and 
pharmacologic evidence that  the investigational agent caused the event. The 
subject’s clinical state and  concomitant treatment have been rule d out as causes. 
If the investiga tional agent is  discontinued or the dose is reduced the event 
abates or resolves, but it reappears upon  rechallenge.  
 
10.2.4. Severity of Adverse Events  
Severity or intensity of adverse events will be graded using the National Cancer 
Institute  Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI -CTCAE), 
Version 4.03, and reported as  indicated on the CRF.  
 
Page [ADDRESS_849662] Updated: 01/10/2019

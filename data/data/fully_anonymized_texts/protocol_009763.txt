STUDY SYNOPSIS  
 
Sponsor:  General Electric Company, acting through its GE Healthcare Business  
Research Type:  This is a Clinical , single -blind , randomized , prospective  research study.  
Regulatory Status:  This is a pre-market  research study of the following  products:  
Pre- market:  Patient-a ssisted compression on Senographe Pristina  
Post -market:  Technologist- controlled compression on Senographe Pristina  
Background and 
Rationale:  Patient -assisted  compression allows the patient to participate in control ling the 
amount of compression force during mammography and is a personalized 
approach that has demonstrated successful reduction in discomfort  experienced 
during  mammography. GE Healthcare’s Senographe Pristina, an innovative 
mammography platform that provides both two -dimensional (2D) and three-
dimensional (3D) imaging capabilities, offers both standard and patient- assisted 
compression modes. This study  is being conducted to c ompare the image quality of 
breast images obtained using standard compression and patient- assisted (PA) 
compression , and to  evaluate the impact of patient -assisted compression on clinical 
workflow. Results from this study are intended to support regulatory  submissions.

Procedures/  
Methods: The study population will consist of adult asymptomatic women presenting for 
screening 2D mammography. One breast of each subject will be identified as the 
“breast of interest ,” which  will undergo two-view (craniocaudal and mediolateral 
oblique) PA compression and image acquisition, immediately followed  by 
[CONTACT_73691] -controlled (TC) compression and image acquisition. The breast of 
interest will be randomly assigned to either the first breast imaged during the exam 
or the second breast imaged. TC compression and imaging , and procedures 
performed on the subject’s other breast will be conducted per standard of care.  
Following image acquisition, image quality evaluation will be conducted by [CONTACT_73686] -
qualified readers. Prior to the reading session, i mages will be de- identified and the 
following information will be removed from the DICOM header to blind readers to the compression mode used during acquisition: time stamp, compression force, and breast thickness.  Two  (2) readers will evaluate each PA and TC compression image 
set collected from each subject’s breast of interest  and assess the acceptability of 
image attributes, as defined in the Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff - Class II 
Special Controls Guid ance Document: Full -Field Digital Mammography System  (2012). 
A third reader will provide adjudication, if there is disagreement for a given image 
set’s overall clinical image quality.  
Workflow data, including time to complete image acquisition for each co mpression 
mode and the incidence of technologist intervention during acquisition, will also be 
collected.  
The proportion of PA image sets that are of equal or higher acceptability than TC 
image sets will be calculated.  A 95% confidence interval will be calculated using 
asymptotic method with continuity correction. The proportion of image sets 
indicated for repeated image acquisition when using PA mode or TC mode will be summarized. Other endpoint data will be summarized  using descriptive statistics . No 
statistical hypothesis is being tested in this study.   
Objectives: The primary objective  is to compare the acceptability of overall image quality in 
unilateral two -view (CC and MLO) breast images acquired using PA and TC 
compression modes.  
The secondary objectives are: 
• To evaluate the need for repeat image acquisition when using PA and TC 
compression modes; and  
• To evaluate acceptability of mammographic attributes for unilateral two -
view breast images acquired using PA and TC compression modes, per the Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff - Class II Special Controls Guidance 
Document: Full -Field Digital Mammography  System  (2012; hereafter referred 
to as the “ Guidance ”). 
The exploratory objectives are: 
• To collect workflow data for PA compression and TC compression, and  
• To collect breast thickness, radiation dose, and compression force for 
images acquired using PA and TC compression.

Sample size and Sites : Up to 36 subjects from one (1) site will be included as part of  this study  to achieve 
the targeted number of  complete and evaluable subjects . The target sample size for 
this study is 30 subjects, providing 60 evaluable image sets for the image attribute 
review (30 PA compression image sets and 30 TC compression image sets). The 
number of subjects was determined based on Sponsor discussions with a U.S. FDA 
Medical Officer, who indicated that, during MQSA re- accreditation, sites are 
requested to submit sample images. If an issue is identified with the sample images, an Advanced Mammographic Review occurs, where the quality of 30 images is 
assessed to determine whether the issue was isolated or systemic.  
Study duration:  The study is expected to last approximately three (3)  months.

of screening mammography,  clinicians struggle to maintain patient participation in regular screening programs. 
Notably, a  systematic review by [CONTACT_73687], et al. concluded that pain experienced during screening 
mammography (e.g. compression pain) contributed to reduced rates of repeat participation in regular screening 
programs.[ADDRESS_455544] shown that a personalized approach to compression can significantly reduce pain intensity and 
discomfort experienced by [CONTACT_73688]. 16, 17, 18 
Patient- controlled compression allows the patient to control the amount of compression force during 
mammography and is a personalized approach that has demonstrated successful pain reduction in 
mammography. 16GE Healthcare’s Senographe Pristina, an innovative mammography platform that provides 
both two -dimensional (2D) and three- dimensional (3D) imaging capabilities, offers standard and patient- assisted 
compression modes. The study described herein is being conducted to compare the image quality of breast 
images obtained using standard compression and patient -assisted compression  in an  asymptomatic female 
population  undergoing full- field digital (FFDM) 2D screening mammogra phy. This study will also evaluate the 
impact of patient -assisted  compression on clinic al workflow. Results from this study are intended to support 
regulatory submissions.  
 Controls and Minimization of Bias  
Due to the inherent difference in utility of standard and patient -assisted compression modes, study subjects  and 
study staff will not be blinded to the compression mode.  However, the following bias control methods will be 
employed in this study:  
• Selection bias will be limited by [CONTACT_364683].  
• Spectrum bias will be limited by [CONTACT_2329] a population expected to represent the general population at the 
investigational site, witho ut regard to race or ethnicity.  
• Patient- assisted compression will be randomly assigned to either the first or second breast imaged to 
mitigate subject- learning bias associated with the amount of compression required for image 
acquisition.  
• Readers conducting image quality evaluations will be blinded to the compression mode used to obtain 
the images.  
• A minimum of three (3) radiology technologists will conduct the study procedures to mitigate bias 
introduced by [CONTACT_73691]- specific practices.

Patient- Assisted Compression, Senographe Pristina (Figure 1) is a commercial mammography medical device  
consisting of the Senographe Pristina FFDM  system (2D) and Senographe Pristina DBT option (3D). The platform 
is an evolution of the cleared/approved Senographe Essential FFDM  system (2D) and SenoClaire DBT option (3D). 
Senographe Pristina includes the same clinical applications as traditional mammography systems and is 
designed to improve workflow while maintaining imaging capabilities and image quality of F FDM and DBT breast 
imaging. The FFDM option will be used for the purposes of this study.  
Senographe Pristina includes the hardware and software components required for multi- modality functioning 
and is designed to  improve patient experience, patient throug hput, and radiographer experience . The system 
offers two compression modes – standard mode and the optional patient -assisted compression mode (referred 
to as “PA compression” hereafter). The patient- assisted feature enables the patient to personally refine breast 
compression using a hand- held remote control  (Figure 1) after the compression has been initiated by [CONTACT_275312], which is required to ensure proper breast positioning.

 Anticipated Risks and Benefits 
The device  under study ha s undergone risk assessment, in accordance with International Standards 
Organization ( ISO) [ZIP_CODE]:2012. R isks have been mitigated to levels as low as reasonably possible (ALARP)  and 
are not expected to exceed risks associated with  the routine clinical breast  cancer screening procedures that 
the subject has been prescribed outside of the study.  The operator’s manual highlights warnings, cautions, and 
potential conventional risks associated with the exam.  
Breast imaging procedures will be conducted using post -market Senographe Pristina systems with pre -market 
PA compression mode installed. Breast imaging procedures will be conducted per the site’s standard of care, 
with the exception of the investigational imaging, which will consist of unilateral two -view (craniocaudal [CC] and 
mediolateral oblique [MLO]) imaging  acquired using the PA compression . There  will be no repeat imaging  
administered using PA compression mode.  
No additional medications will be administered beyond those regularly required for the subject’s medical care 
outside of this study, and regular medication should not be adversely impacted or delayed by [CONTACT_28224].  
Post -trial care and follow -up are not required by [CONTACT_15365].  
There is no expected benefit to study subjects participating in this research. The results of this study may benefit 
future patients  by [CONTACT_364685]. 
 Risk Category  and Rationale 
The Senographe Pristina FFDM system with PA compression mode , as used in this stu dy, is not  considered a 
significant risk device per the 21 CFR § 812.3 definition:  
1) it is not intended as an implant;  
2) is not purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life;  
3) is not for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health; and  
4) it does not otherwise present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a sub ject. 
This designation of non -significant risk is supported by [CONTACT_70020] , in which the data obtained will not be 
used as the sole measure of diagnosis without distinct confirmation from conventional methods, such as 
mammography on an approved/cleared device or other standard of care procedures at the investigational site.

3) Are currently undergoing radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or have a history of prior radiotherapy 
treatment on either breast;  
4) Are currently lactating; or  
5) Have breast implants . 
 Recruiting  and Screening  
Subjects will be recruited for potential enrollment in to this study from an adult asymptomatic female population 
scheduled for screening FFDM at the site. Subjects will be screened for enrollment against the inclusion an d 
exclusion criteria, and enrollment determinations will be made by [CONTACT_978] . Recruitment, screening, and enrollment 
will be conducted per the standard procedures of the investigational site. All subject participation will be 
voluntary.  
Following recruitment , a subject will be considered enrolled (the point of enroll ment) once  she signs and dates 
the informed consent form  (ICF) . Once enrolled, the subject will be assigned a unique subject number , which  will 
not contain information that could identify her (e.g. subject name [CONTACT_40234]). The unique subject number  
will be used to label case report form (CRF) data for the subject throughout her  participation in the study . 
 Breast of Interest  Randomization 
One (1) breast per subject will undergo study -specific  procedures (hereafter referred to as “breast of interest ”) 
while  the second breast will be imaged per standard of care. The breast of interest will be randomized across all 
subjects so that approximately half the subjects will be assigned to the first imaged breast  and the other half will 
be assigned to the second imaged breast  (Figure 2).  
Site technologists conducting the study will perform each subject’s mammography exam per standard practice. Thus, th e laterality of the breast of interest will solely depend on which breast (left or right) the technologist 
images first and second in standard practice.

  Ver: 1.0 ; 22/May/[ADDRESS_455549] shall be withdrawn from the study if a study- related  PA compression in either CC or MLO view is not 
complete d (i.e. no image is acquired due to inadequate compression or positioning).  If a subject withdraws or is 
withdrawn, all efforts will be made to complete and report study data up to the time of withdrawal. A complete 
final evaluation at the time of the subject’s withdrawal shall be made and recorded on a CRF. If the reason for 
withdrawal is related to an adverse event ( AE) or serious adverse event ( SAE), monitoring of the subject will 
continue until the outcome is evident.  
Any data  collected for the subject, up until the time of withdrawal  or discontinuation, may  still be included in the 
study results and provided to the Sponsor, unless the subject requests that their data not be used. The site sh all 
document all requests by [CONTACT_73697].

  Ver: 1.0 ; 22/May/[ADDRESS_455551] is eligible and willing to comply  with applicable site requirements prior to 
starting study procedures. Demographic information, clinical history data, and pregnancy/menopausal status 
will be collected prior to the mammography exam.  
No preparation for the breast imaging exam beyond that usually required by [CONTACT_364686]. After consenting, however, the study staff will show the subjects how to use the PA 
compression m ode prior to starting the exam.  
 Description of Study  Procedures  
 Image acquisitions  
Each subject will undergo her regularly scheduled FFDM imaging exam per standard practices at the investigational site , with the exception of the study- specific image acquisitions using PA compression . For the 
breast of interest,  PA compressio n and image acquisition will be conducted first  and consist of both CC and MLO 
views. There shall be no repeat imaging administered using PA compression mode. Following two -view PA  
compression image acquisition, TC compression and standard of care imaging will be conducted on the same 
breast/breast of interest . Standard of care will be used for imaging of the subject’s other breast.  
A minimum of three (3) site technologists will pe rform the image acquisitions and related study procedures. Study 
procedures shall not impact the order in which the left and right breasts are imaged during the subjects’ exams.  
There will be two (2) s tudy -specific image sets of the breast of interest for each subject . Image sets will consist of 
CC and MLO views obtained using PA compression and CC and MLO views obtained using TC compression.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Image set acquisition time
Study staff will capture the following times associated with the study procedures:  
1) Amoun t of time it took to educate the subject on the PA compression mode and remote control.  
2) Start time of first PA compression on breast of interest.  
3) Start time of first TC compression on breast of interest.  
 Image attribute review  
Following acquisition, study- specific images will be de- identified, and the time stamp , compression force, and 
breast thickness will be removed from the DICOM header to ensure the readers are blinded to the compression 
mode  used for each image set. 
PA and TC compression image sets will be evaluated by [CONTACT_1192] (2 ) MQSA -qualified readers, with a third reader to 
provide adjudication if disagreement is observed between the two (2) readers’ evaluations of “overall clinical 
image quality ” (i.e. item number 9 in Section 5.3.2  Image attribute review ). Images will be displayed on site-
provided mammography  review workstations /systems in the order  in which  they were acquired from the study 
subjects . Each reader will evaluate each image set independently from other reader(s)  and have the freedom to 
navigate between views, as he/she would do in clinical practice.  
In addition to the images, the following case data will be available to the readers for each image set  during image 
attribute review:  
• Techniques (anode, filter, kVp, mAs, half -value layer)  
• Estimated average glandular dose per view (mGy)

cases by [CONTACT_73698] “ Acceptable ” or “Not Acceptable ” on CRFs.  
1) Breast positioning, assessing coverage of the breast on craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique view , 
separately  
2) Exposure, assessing visualization of the adipose and fibroglandular tissues, and visualization of breast 
tissue underlying th e pectoralis muscle, separately 
3) Breast compression, assessing overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_73674], uniformity of exposure of fibroglandular 
tissues, adequacy of penetration of thicker portio ns of the breast, exposure of thinner areas, and motion 
unsharpness

8. SAFETY  
 Anticipated Adverse Events  
Mammography is an x -ray examination of the breasts. As with all  x-ray exam s, mammography  involve s ionizing 
radiation. The amount of radiation from a standard FFDM mammography exam , even with the addition of the 
study -specific unilateral, two -view imaging, is small and equal in cancer risk to the total body radiation receive d 
naturally from the environment over a period of a few months.   
There are no known additional medical risks or side effects from Senographe Pristina FFDM with PA compression mode beyond those of similar conventional clinical procedures on other commercial mammography devices . 
Foreseeable AEs that apply to mammography and are also applicable to digital mammography using the Senographe Pristina with PA compression mode  may include , but are not limited to:  
• Bruising (uncommon);  
• Skin irritation (uncommon), abrasions (uncommon), or tears (rare) ; 
• Discomfort (common) . 
The study staff conducting the research is trained t o recognize these reactions, and  should it be necessary, other 
medical care is available at  the site.  Subjects will be followed for AEs from the time they enter the imaging suite 
for their exam  until the time they  exit the imaging suite after the exam .

It is generally agreed that the risk to a fetus from radiation in a screening mammography exam is minimal 19; 
however, it is standard clinical practice  to try to determine pregnancy status of women referred for 
mammography and not allow women known or suspected to be pregnant to undergo screening mammography 
or other elective radiologic procedures. 
There is always a chance of unexpected risks. Throughout  the study, the Sponsor will evaluate and update safety 
information  in study documents .  
 Adverse Event Definitions  
Adverse Event (AE) : any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward clinical signs 
(including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users or other persons, whether or not related to the 
investigational medical device [ISO [ZIP_CODE] :2011 3.2].  This includes events related to the investigational device or 
the comparator and to the procedures involved. For users or other persons, this is restricted to events related to 
the investigational medical device.  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) : an adverse event that led to death; led to a serious deterioration in the health of 
the subject, that either resulted in a life- threatening illness or injury, a permanent impairment of a body structure 
or a body function,  or in -patient or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or medical or surgical intervention to prevent life-
threatening illness or injury or permanent impairment to body structure or a body function; or led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect. Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre- existing condition, or a 
procedure required by [CONTACT_73701], is not considered a SAE [ISO 
[ZIP_CODE]:2011 3.37]. 
Adverse Device Effect (ADE) : an adverse event related to the use of an investigational medical device [ISO 
[ZIP_CODE]:2011 3.1]. This includes any adverse events resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructions for use, 
deployment, implantation, installation, or operation, or any malfunction of the investigational medical device. 
This includes any event that is a result of a user error or intentional misuse of the investigational device [ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2011 3.43].  
Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE) : an adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the consequences 
characteristic of a serious adverse event [ISO [ZIP_CODE] :2011 3.36]. 
Device deficiency:  an inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, durability, reliability, 
safety , or performance , such as malfunctions, use errors, and inadequate labelling [ISO [ZIP_CODE] :2011 3.15]. 
Unanticipated serious adverse device effect ([LOCATION_003]DE):  a serious adverse device effect, which by [CONTACT_5942], 
incidence, severity , or outcom e has not been identified in the current version of the risk analysis report [ISO 
[ZIP_CODE]:2011 3.42]. In the [LOCATION_002], any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life- threatening 
problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if th at effect, problem, or death was not previously 
identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the study documents , will be reported in accordance with 
21 CFR § 812.3 and applicable law s and regulation s. 
 Documentation of Safety Events  
All adverse  events (AE) , including all serious adverse events (SAE) , are required to be collected, investigated , and 
documented during the study reporting period, as defined in the study procedure set forth in this protocol. Documentation will include:  
• Description of  Event  
• Date of onset and resolution  
• Severity (mild, moderate, or severe)  
 Mild: Symptom(s) barely noticeable to the subject or does not make the subject uncomfortable.

concurrent illness, effect of another device/drug or other cause, and is unlikely related to the investigational product . 
 Possibly related : The adverse event is reasonably expected to be related to the investigational 
product, and an alternative etiology is equally or less likely compared to the potential 
relationship to investigational product . 
 Related : There is a strong relationship to investigational product or recurs on re-challenge, and 
another etiology is unlikely or there is no other reasonable medical explanation for the event.

 Early Termination of the Study  
The Sponsor may terminate the study prematurely according to certain circumstances . Examples of such 
circumstances include ethical concerns, insufficient participant recruitment, participant safety concerns , 
alterations in accepted clinical practice that make the continuation of a clinical trial unwise, early evidence of 
benefit or harm of the research product, or for any other reason.  
10. STATISTICAL METHODS  
 Statistical Hypothesis   
No statistical hypothesis is being tested in this study . 
 Sample Size Determination  
The target sample size for this study is 30 subjects, providing 60 evaluable image sets for the image attribute review (30 PA compression image sets and 30 TC compression image sets).  The number of subjects was 
determined based on Sponsor discussions with a U.S. FDA Medical Officer, who  indicated that , during MQSA re-
accreditation,  sites are requested to submit  sample images. If an issue is identified with the sample images, an 
Advanced Mammographic Review occurs,  where  the quality of  30 images is assessed to determine whether  the 
issue w as isolated or systemic .  
With a sample size of 30 image pairs, the 95% confidence interval width for the proportion of PA image sets with 
equal or higher acceptability than TC image sets will be no wider than 13%, when the proportion is 95%.

The study  data will be summarized using descriptive statistics. The descriptive statistics for continuous variables 
will include mean, standard deviation, median, Q1 and Q3, minimum, maximum, and sample size , as approp riate . 
Categorical variables will be described with counts, percentages, and sample size, as appropriate . A 95% 
confidence interval may be presented , when necessary.  
 Analysis of Primary Endpoin t 
The proportion of PA image sets that are of equal or higher acceptability than TC image sets will be calculated.  
A 95% confidence interval will be calculated using asymptotic method with continuity correction. This analysis 
will also be performed for subgroups defined by [CONTACT_73707] (i.e. brea st of interest imaged 
first versus breast of interest imaged second) . 
Proportion of images with acceptable overall image quality will be summarized for PA image sets and TC image 
sets separately, with 95% confidence interval using asymptotic method with co ntinuity correction . 
 Analysis of Secondary and Exploratory Endpoints  
The proportion of image sets indicated for repeated image acquisition when using PA mode or TC mode will be summarized. This analysis will also be performed for subgroups defined by [CONTACT_941] r andomized breast of  interest . 
The acceptability for individual mammographic attribute s will be summarized by [CONTACT_73709].

 Completion of Case Report Forms (CRFs)  
The data reported on the CRFs shall be derived from source documents and be consistent with these source 
documents. Paper CRFs and/or electronic CRFs (eCRFs) will be used to collect data . The Sponsor wi ll provide 
e/CRFs and train study staff on completion of e/CRFs using Good Documentation Practices (GDP). CRF Completion 
Guidelines (CCG) may be provided by [CONTACT_73710].  
e/CRFs are to be completed as information becomes available at the site. e/CRFs should be signed by [CONTACT_73711], in indicated area(s) , to certify the contents of the form. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_364682] e/CRFs.  
If discrepancies are discovered on paper CRFs during monitoring, the Sponsor’s representative will ensure that the study staff makes necessary corrections directly to the CRF(s) prior to collection.  
Following CRF collection, the Sponsor will review the data. A Data Clarification Form (DCF) may be provided to the site to correct or clarify discrepancies.  
If a site discovers discrepancies after  CRF collection, the site may notify the Sponsor  and request data 
modification.  
If discrepancies are discov ered on the eCRF, whether during monitoring or during data review by [CONTACT_3476], 
a query will be raised, and the site shall make the correction within the electronic database, noting the reason 
for change. Data will be considered clean once all queries are answered and closed.  
If the Sponsor discovers discrepancies on eCRFs, a query will be raised and necessary corrections will be made by [CONTACT_779]. The reason for any changes will be noted. All queries will be resolved prior to study completion.

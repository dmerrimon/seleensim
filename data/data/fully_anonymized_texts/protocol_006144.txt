Since ISO [ZIP_CODE]-2-61:2011 has been updated as ISO [ZIP_CODE]-2-61:2017 with no changes in the requirements for conducting the study and demonstrating SpO2 and PR accuracy, this study results can be referred for demonstrating SpO2 and PR accuracy per ISO [ZIP_CODE]-2-61:2011 as well as per ISO [ZIP_CODE]-2-61:2017.  This study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2011 and :2020.  2. Subjects  This study is performed on volunteers who have previously been determined to be healthy enough for this study, have signed an informed consent form and met the following IRB requirements.  These volunteers are compensated by [CONTACT_59290].  Point of enrolment is defined as time at which subjects sign and date the informed consent form and screening based on subject demography and inclusion/exclusion criteria is complete. Expected duration of each subject’s participation will be about [ADDRESS_280777] subjects are:  1. Both male and female subjects who can give written informed consent 2. Healthy subjects capable of undergoing controlled hypoxemia to the levels outlined in the desaturation profile below 3. Meeting the demographic requirements listed above.  The exclusion criteria for the test subjects are:  1. Age below [ADDRESS_280778], a series of desaturation runs are performed.  Run 1 starts with a stabilized period at room air and is followed by [CONTACT_59291].  Run 2 starts with a stabilized period at 100% and is followed by [CONTACT_59291].  The following are value targets:  Run 1 room air, 90%, 80%, 70% Run 2 100%, 95%, 85%, 75%  The objective of these targets is to spread the data points evenly over the desired range.  Achieving them exactly is not important, though every effort will be made to be within 2%.  The SpO2 value is reduced by [CONTACT_26129] a mixture of medical air and nitrogen, controlled by [ADDRESS_280779] not changed more than 1 % for 20 seconds (they do not have to agree with each other).  Each desaturation plateaus should not exceed 10 minutes. When the

 4 / [ADDRESS_280780] is coached on breathing.  If he/she appears to fall asleep, he/she is woken up.  At any signs of distress, he/she is given 100% oxygen.  Each run should take Between [ADDRESS_280781]’s demographic data will be collected using specific data collection forms.  4. Reference Data  The reference SpO2 will be measured using a Nihon Kohden OLV-[ADDRESS_280782] one run will use tappi[INVESTIGATOR_232674].  Motion types will be arranged as follows:  On the motion-hand side  Subject 1 + 3 + [ADDRESS_280783] 2 + 4 Run 1 rubbing tappi[INVESTIGATOR_232675] 2 tappi[INVESTIGATOR_232676].  • 2Hz sine (2Hz) • 4Hz sine (4Hz) • Sequence of moves of a pseudo random distance from 1mm to 30mm (Rand) • The amplitude of the sine motion and the maximum slope of the random motion will be determined at the beginning of each Desaturation Run. • For 2Hz sine and 4Hz sine, motion artifact red p-p amplitude will be equal to the PPG p-p amplitude of the subject.  For Rand, the largest motion artifact red p-p amplitude will be equal to the PPG p-p amplitude of the subject.  In each plateau, the motion drive type will be sequentially changed in the following ways.  • 30 seconds’ no motion • 30 seconds’ 2Hz • 30 seconds’ 4Hz • 30 seconds’ Rand  6. Sensor Placements  A reference SpO2 will be taken on each subject with the sponsor Control instrument.  The SpO2 probes for the sponsor Control instrument will be the TL-281-IB disposable SpO2 probes.  These probes will be arranged as follows:  On the control-hand side  Subject 1 + [ADDRESS_280784] 2 + [ADDRESS_280785] 3 
NK IRB No.: 70Ag_Vital-[ZIP_CODE] Date: March 16, 2021  
 5 / [ADDRESS_280786] instruments will be the TL-273TA Neonatal and Adult disposable probe, the TL-535U Neonatal disposable probe, the TL-220T Multisite reusable probe.  These probes will be arranged as follows:  On the motion-hand side  Subject 1 + [ADDRESS_280787] 2 + [ADDRESS_280788]’s safety and correct data recording.  The test will be discontinued when a subject requests to withdraw from the study or the Co-investigator will terminate the desaturation procedure and/or a subject’s participation in the study because of the reasons including: 1) the subject experiences unexpected oxygen desaturation or 2) the subject loses consciousness.  Risks associated with participation in the study include the following: a. The risks of the brief exposures to hypoxia are include feeling short of breath, headache, and dizziness.  Brief loss of consciousness may occur but is not expected at the levels of oxygen targeted for these tests.  Nihon Kohden has determined that there is no residual risk associated with the test devices. Nihon Kohden will be responsible for maintaining the test devices.  8. Data Analysis  Data from subjects who did not complete the protocol will be thrown out.  Missing data will not be supplemented.  Data points at a plateau where the equipment output for TL-281-IB changes over 2% saturation will be thrown out.  Data from unstable pulse wave signal due to the uncontrolled motion will be thrown out.   SpO2 data will be reduced using the ARMS method and accuracy will be reported as the ARMS deviation between the co-oximeter and the test instruments for all points gathered from each sensor.

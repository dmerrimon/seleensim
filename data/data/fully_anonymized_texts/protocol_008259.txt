1. Protocol Summary  
Protocol Title  Clinical Validation of the Aptitude Medical Systems Metrix COVID/Flu Test 
for Detection of SARS -CoV-2 and Influenza A/B in Point -of-Care and At -
Home/Non -Laboratory Settings  
Investigational Device(s)  Metrix COVID/Flu Test  
Metrix Reader (Gen 2) 
Primary Objective(s)  To e valuate the clinical performance (Positive Percent Agreement, 
Negative Percent Agreement, and 95% confidence intervals) of the Metrix 
COVID/Flu Test in detecting SARS -CoV-2, Influenza A, and Influenza B 
compared to an FDA -cleared comparator assay.  
Primary Endpoint(s)  For each target:  
• PPA ≥95% (lower bound 95% CI ≥85%)  
• NPA ≥98% (lower bound 95% CI ≥95%)  
Study Design and Procedures  This is a multi -site, prospective, cross -sectional study. Enrollment will 
occur in an “all -comers”/sequential manner after written informed 
consent (and/or verbal assent, in the case of minors) and confirmation of 
eligibility.  
 
All standard -of-care specimens will be collected prior to any study 
specimens. Participants will be asked to complete a self -test (or assisted 
for those under 14 years) using the investigational devices. Participants 
will execute all steps necessary to com plete the test, including result 
interpretation, without any guidance or aid from study coordinators.  
 
After testing with the investigational devices, a healthcare professional 
will collect a nasopharyngeal swab specimen for comparator assay 
analysis by [CONTACT_543553]. Comparator results will not 
be provided to participants.  
 
Results from the investigational device will not be used to make patient 
healthcare decisions. Healthcare management will be determined by [CONTACT_543554].  
Study Population  Individuals aged 2+ years with signs and symptoms of respi[INVESTIGATOR_42977]. Intended users of the investigational device include lay -users 
(OTC/home use) with no prior laboratory experience with the 
investigational device. Participants aged 14 years and up will perform 
self-testing and participants below 14 years will be assisted by [CONTACT_107119].

infections. This may include utilizing one or more investigational sites 
outside of the US (at which participants are required to be fluent in 
English), depending on enrollment needs and geographical/seasonal 
prevalence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_77881].  
 
This study will be conducted in simulated home environment s set up 
within or near clinical settings ( e.g., urgent care clinics).  
Study Duration  The study is to take place during the 202 3 respi[INVESTIGATOR_431883]. The 
estimated length of the specimen  collection and testing phase is expected 
to be up to 2 4 weeks with an additional 2 to 3 weeks of study preparation 
and 2 weeks of final study closeout. Therefore, the total estimated study 
duration is up to 2 9 weeks. If the prevalence for any of the candidate 
analytes is low (such that enrollment targets are not met), the study may 
be extended into the next respi[INVESTIGATOR_543549] s.

3. Statistcal Analysis  
 
3.1. Clinical Performance Analysis  
For each target, t he following analysis will be performed  to obtain a measure of clinical performance of 
the Metrix COVID/Flu Test versus the FDA -cleared comparator assay . Positive Percent Agreement (PPA) 
and Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) will be calculated  as shown below . The PPA and NPA will be 
presented in separate 2x2 tables  for each target  with comparator vs investigational test (test device).  
 
 Comparator Test  
Positive  Negative  
Test 
Device  Positive  A B 
Negative  C D 
 
Positive percent agreement = 100% x A/(A+C)  
Negative percent agreement = 100% x D/(B+D)  
 
The two -sided 95% Confidence Interval (CI) will be calculated using the Wilson Score method.  
 
The study will also report participant demographics, percentage of invalid test results and 
investigational test performance on days from symptom onset (if applicable).  
3.2. Clinical Validation Acceptance Criteria  
The study results will be reported in 2×2 tables to calculate the estimated positive and negative percent 
agreements with the comparison device/method. Wilson two -sided 95% confidence  intervals will also

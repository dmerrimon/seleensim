This Patient  Registry is a prospective, multi -center, single -arm, patient registry  which is intended 
to assess the clinical use in a heterogeneous patient population in a real world clinical 
application.  The L utonix 035 Drug Coated Balloon  (DCB)  PTA Catheter was appro ved by 
[CONTACT_269157] 9, 2014 (PMA P130024) for the indication of percutaneous transluminal 
angioplasty (PTA), after pre -dilatation, of de novo or restenotic lesions up to 150  mm in length 
in native superficial femoral artery (SFA) or popliteal  arteries (P A) with reference vessel 
diameters of [ADDRESS_327368] approved DCB used to treat stenoses in the  SFA and in the 
PA as a result of peripheral arterial diseases (PAD).  
 
This patient registry  will be conducted in conformance with the Declaration of  Helsinki, Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)  requirements and Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP ) including 21  CFR Parts 50, 54, and 56.   
2.1. Background  
PAD  occurs when a narrowin g, or blockage, develops in the arteries; PAD  most commonly 
affects the legs1.The primary cause of lower extremity PAD is atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis of 
the lower extremity arteries results in symptoms ranging from intermittent claudication (pain in 
the buttocks, thighs, or calf which occurs with exercise, and relieves with rest) to pain at rest, and 
can ultimately progress to ulceration and gangrene. A number of risk factors can be directly 
correlated with the onset of progressive PAD, including cigar ette smoking, diabetes mellitus, 
dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], hypertension, hyperhomocysteinemia, and advanced age .1,2 
2.2. Registry Objective  
The objective of this registry is to assess the clinical use of the  Lutonix 035 DCB  PTA Catheter 
in a heterogeneous patient popula tion in a real world , on-label  clinical application  per the 
Instructions For Use (IFU) .  
3. DEVICE DESCRIPTION  
The LUTONIX [ADDRESS_327369] PTA  catheter with a drug coating on the 
balloon portion of the catheter.  The L UTONIX Catheter 035 model  is an over -the-wire (OTW)  
with working length s of 75 and 130 cm  and is compatible with 0.035” guidewire . Marker bands 
are located at the proximal and dis tal ends of the balloons to assist in delivery and placement.   
The balloon surface between the marker bands is coated with a specialized immediate release 
non-polymer based coating  formulation that includes the anti -proliferative drug – paclitaxel  - at a 
surface concentration of 2μg/mm2.  Please refer to the IFU  for complete instructions , preparation  
and procedural use of the device.

SAFE -DCB U.S. Registry (BPV -14-006) Version [ADDRESS_327385] Peripheral Vascular, Inc.  reporting of AEs/SAEs will be limited to those events that are d evice and/or procedure related 
and reporting  will begin immediately following subject enrollment, during the index procedure.  
 
8.1. Definition of Adverse Event  
Collection of AEs will be limited to those that are associated with a localized or systemic clinical 
manifestation that reasonably suggests the involvement of the patient registry  device (s) and/or 
procedure.    
 
− Device(s) -Related:  This category should be restricted to AEs directly attributable to the 
Lutonix® DCB Catheter device(s) used as part of the pro cedure.  
− Procedure -Related:   A procedure includes any activity performed during a patient 
registry -related procedure.  
  
8.2. Adverse Events Classification  
Each AE should be assessed for its severity, or the intensity of an event, experienced by [CONTACT_1560].  
 
─ Mild:  Awareness of a sign or symptom that does not interfere with the subject’s activity 
or is transient and is resolved without treatment or sequelae.  
─ Moderate:   May interfere with the subject’s activity and require additional intervention 
and/o r treatment, and may have additional sequelae.  
− Severe:  Significant discomfort to the subject and/or interferes with the subject’s activity.  
Additional intervention and or treatment are necessary.  Additional sequelae occur.   
 
8.3. Definition of Serious Advers e Event  
Each device and/or procedure related AE will be assessed to determine whether it is serious or 
non-serious.  (NOTE:  The term serious is not synonymous with severity, which may be used to 
describe the intensity of an event experienced by [CONTACT_70579] t.).  
 
An SAE is an AE that:  
1. led to a death  
2. led to a serious deterioration in the health of the subject that:  
a. resulted in a life -threatening illness or injury  
b. resulted in a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function  
c. required in -patient hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
d. resulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent impairment to body structure 
or a body function  
3. led to fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality or birth defect

TLR/TVRs - assessed in the patient registry  endpoints), without serious deterioration in health are 
not considered SAEs.  
8.4. Relationship of Adverse Event to D evice(s)/Procedure  
Each AE/SAE should be assessed for its relationship to the device or procedure as follows:  
The following categories should be used for assigning the certainty of the relatedness:  
− Definitely Related:  An AE is definitely related if it is obvious, certain or there is little 
doubt regarding the relationship.  
− Possibly Related:   An AE is possibly related if it is capable of being related but relatively 
unlikely.  
− Not Related:  An AE is not related if it is determined that there is no plausible a ssociation .

The key patient registry  endpoints of freedom from TLR and TVR rates  as well as primary 
patency rate  will be reported by [CONTACT_269159] 95% confidence intervals. The 
calculation of rates at each time point will be based on available dat a at the time point. Missing 
data will not be imputed. Additionally, a Kaplan -Meier curve across the whole duration of the 
patient registr y for TLR and TVR and Patency may be created. The rates at each time point 
derived from the Kaplan -Meier curve take in to account of information from registry subject s 
who discontinue from the registry  prematurely and cause missing data.

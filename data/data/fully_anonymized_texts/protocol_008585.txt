After transplant, lung function typi[INVESTIGATOR_153784]. [6-8] However, reduced physical function and an inactive lifestyle compromise this benefit. Prior to transplant, end-stage lung disease reduces ventilatory capacity.[9] Disabling dyspnea limits physical activity and exercise, causing low muscle mass and qualitative changes in large exercising skeletal muscle groups.[10] Thus, LTR are severely deconditioned when they come to transplant surgery. After transplant, skeletal muscle changes persist.[11] Side effects of  immunosuppressive agents further reduce lean muscle mass, increase fatigue, and decrease motivation to stay active.[12] A systematic review of 18 studies evaluating loss of skeletal muscle mass, strength and function in LTR reported that quadriceps strength was reduced in the pre-transplant period (range, 49%-86% predicted; n = 455 patients), further reduced immediately after transplant (51%-72% predicted, n = 126), with variable improvement at 3 months after transplant (58%-101% predicted, n = 164).[13]   While improved lung function after transplant has the potential to improve physical function, there is consistent evidence of limitations in reaching this goal.[6, 14-16] To promote rehabilitation goals, LTR are advised to attend a PR program.[17-19] Whereas post-transplant medical management requires following an established protocol, participation in PR is elective to LTR’s individual decision. Studies documenting PR outcomes in other populations, [20, 21] consistent with our experience, report that PR is underused. It enrolls about a half of those referred [20] and loses > 25% of those who enroll to attrition.[21] Attrition of LTR in our PR clinic was greater than 50%. Barriers include scheduling and travel requirements,[18] perceptual disincentives and, of concern to LTR on immunosuppressive regimens, group participation which risks exposure to infection. Further, and of primary interest to this study, we pose that characteristics inherent to PR programs impact long-term adherence to exercise in LTR. During PR, exercise occurs under close clinician supervision but, afterward, LTR are expected to continue exercise unsupervised at home while not feeling confident. Consequently, LTR have little opportunity to establish behavior patterns that promote continued, independent self-management of exercise. Importantly, behavioral strategies, essential to achieve exercise goals and sustain self-management of exercise and active lifestyle, are not the main focus of traditional PR programs.   Telerehabilitation (TR) offers a flexible and sustainable alternative with the potential to promote and sustain self-management of exercise in LTR. Defined as an application of tele-health to rehabilitation,[22] TR uses telecommunication and computing technology to assess patients and deliver interventions in remote locations.[23-25] RCTs have evaluated TR-focused interventions in other populations, e.g., knee arthroplasty, stroke, and supported benefits of TR.[26-28] No

Study Objectives  The study aims to evaluate efficacy of a behavioral exercise intervention, Lung Transplant Go (LTGO) compared to enhanced usual care (EUC) in improving physical function, physical activity and blood pressure (BP) control in lung transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].   Primary Aim: Evaluate efficacy of LTGO in improving physical function and physical activity from baseline to [ADDRESS_177409]-randomization.  Secondary Aim: Evaluate efficacy of LTGO on BP control from baseline to [ADDRESS_177410]-randomization.   Study Design & Methods  After completing a baseline assessment, lung transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (LTRs) were randomized 1:1 to either the LTGO or Enhanced Usual Care group. To achieve balance between groups for known differences in exercise capacity, a blocked randomization scheme stratified by [CONTACT_4321], and length of transplant-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] (≤2 weeks or >2 weeks) was used as an indicator of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-associated deconditioning. The statistician was responsible for randomization.   
  After the start of Covid, all study activities were performed remotely for both groups, including intervention delivery, recruitment, consenting, assessment, and data collection. Outcome assessors were blinded to group assignments. Data collectors were trained to perform study assessments until they demonstrated competency. Quality control checks of inter-rater reliability between assessors were repeated every quarter and remediation was instituted to remedy any drift from the assessment protocol less than (r = .97). Assessors were trained to abstract data 

Page [ADDRESS_177411] using established code books. Inter-rater reliability was determined between two raters for every 10 records. Data safety and intervention fidelity were monitored regularly. Surveys and semi-structured interviews were used to determine the usability and acceptability of the LTGO intervention. Performance of all assessments and delivery of intervention sessions and phone calls were audio or video-recorded. Intervention fidelity was monitored for 10% of phase [ADDRESS_177412] and all phase 2 phone calls. Data safety monitoring (DSM) meetings were held monthly by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_153785], and annually by [CONTACT_976], PD and medical monitor.

Secondary outcome: Blood Pressure Control, Change in stage of hypertension from baseline to 6 months   Statistical Considerations  An intent-to-treat (ITT) design was used wherein all participants were analyzed in the groups to which they were randomly assigned, regardless of treatment received or protocol deviations. The projected sample size was 112 participants a priori to reach a final sample of 80 randomized subjects (40 per group) to achieve 80% power to detect an effect size as small as 0.64, α=0.05, two-tailed, for measures of the difference between LTGO and EUC groups in change in physical function, physical activity, and blood pressure control between baseline and 3 and 6 months.    Phases of data analysis involved an initial screening of data followed by [CONTACT_153788]. All the analyses, including exploratory data analysis and linear mixed model, will be conducted by [CONTACT_4696] (v. 9.4, SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).   Standard descriptive summaries (e.g., means, standard deviation, percentiles, range) and graphical techniques (e.g., histograms, scatter plots) were generated. The distribution of key variables was examined to ensure that the proposed modeling techniques were suitable. The assumptions underlying planned analysis methods were checked, and appropriate data transformation were performed, if necessary. The two groups were compared with respect to baseline variables using Student t-test or Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables; categorical variables were compared between two groups by [CONTACT_153789]-square test or Fisher’s exact test to ensure that randomization resulted in equal distribution of important variables.

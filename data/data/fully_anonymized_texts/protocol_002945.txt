Trial title  
An open-label, multicentre, extension trial to assess the safety of re -dosing of intravenous 
iron isomaltoside (Monofer®)  
Trial design 
The trial is a prospective, open -label, multi -centre, extension trial of the lead -in trials P-
Monofer-IDA-01, P-Monofer-IDA-03, and P-Monofer-CKD-04 to assess the safety profile of 
iron isomaltoside 1000 (Monofer®, Pharmacosmos, Holbæk, Denmark)  in subjects at 3 and 6 
months after re -dosing. 
Subjects will be re-dosed with 1000 mg iron isomaltoside . 
Phase of trial 
The trial is a phase III trial. 
Background  
Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is often associated with many chronic diseases such as renal 
diseases, cancer, infections, chronic heart failure, and inflammatory bowel disease.  
Subjects are often treated with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) in ord er to stimulate 
erythropoiesis. This therapy requires rapid mobilisation of iron reserves in order to meet the 
demands of new red blood cell (RBC) growth. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_317057], 
the demands of this therapy can outstrip the body’s abi lity to mobilise iron stores resulting in 
“functional iron deficiency”.  
IDA can have a substantial medical and quality of life (QoL) burden on the subjects, and  
treatment of these subjects includes treatment of its underlying cause and restoration of no r-
mal haemoglobin (Hb) concentrations and iron stores. Iron replacement can be accomplished 
by [CONTACT_317088]. Intravenous (IV) iron offers a rapid and efficient means of 
iron correction, and it is superior to oral iron therapy in many circums tances. Treatment with 
oral iron may be adequate for some patients, but intolerance, abnormal absorption due to i n-
flammation, noncompliance, and large iron deficits may lead to an inadequate treatment of 
the anemia with oral iron. International guidelines  recommend IV iron preparations as the 
preferred option in the correction of IDA in several  of these circumstances  and when there is 
a high iron demand, since it is more effective, better tolerated, and improves QoL to a greater 
extent than oral iron supple ments. 
Most trials with IV iron have been [ADDRESS_740298] of iron isomaltoside  on:

Endpoints  
The primary endpoint  is the number of adverse drug reaction (ADR) . 
The secondary safety endpoints are the following:  
 Serious or severe hypersensitivity reaction starting on or after the treatment with  iron 
isomaltoside  (i.e. treatment -emergent). The hypersensitivity terms are defined as

2.1 Background 
Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is a common problem associated with many chronic diseases 
such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), cancer, infections, chronic heart failure (CHF), and 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It is also common in pregnant women and occurs in the 
elderly. IDA is primarily caused by [CONTACT_317098], poor diet, or impaired gastrointestinal 
iron absorption. The major causes of anaemia in CKD subjects are iron and erythropoietin 
deficiencies and a decreased responsiveness to the actions of erythropoietin [Mehdi & Toto, 
2009].  
Subjects are often treated with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) in order to stimulate 
erythropoiesis. This therapy requires rapid mobilisation of iron reserves in order to meet the 
demands of new red blood cell (RBC) growth. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_317057], 
the demands of this therapy can outstrip the body’s ability to mobilise iron stores resulting in 
“functional iron deficiency” [Hotta et al., 1991]. 
IDA can have a substantial medical and quality of life (QoL) burden on the subjects, and 
treatment of these subjects includes treatment of its underlying cause and restoration of no r-
mal haemoglobin (Hb) concentrations and iron stores. Iron replacement can be accomplished 
by [CONTACT_317088]. Intravenous (IV) iron offers a rapid and efficient means of 
iron correction, and it is superior to oral iron therapy in many circumstances  [Dignass et al., 
2015]. Treatment with oral iron may be adequate for some  patients, but intolerance, abnormal 
absorption due to inflammation, noncompliance, and large iron deficits may lead to an inad e-
quate treatment of the anemia with oral iron  [Henry, 2006] . International guidelines  recom-
mend IV iron preparations as the preferred option in the correction of IDA in several  of these 
circumstances  and when there is a high iron demand, since it is more effective, better tolera t-
ed, and improves QoL to a greater extent than oral iron supplements  [Charytan et al., 2005; 
Gasche et al., 2007; KDIGO guideline, 2012 ; Dignass et al., 2015]. 
Most trials with IV iron have been 4-12 weeks trials and long-term trials are warranted to fo l-
low-up on long-term safety after re-dosing . One randomised, comparative, open-label,  5-
weeks trial with iron isomaltoside 1000 (Monofer®, Pharmacosmos, Holbæk, Denmark) has 
been carried out (P-Monofer-IDA-01) and two randomised, comparative, open-label, 8-weeks 
trials are going to be initiated in subjects with IDA (P-Monofer-IDA-03) and NDD-CKD sub-
jects with IDA (P-Monofer-CKD-04). This trial is a 6-months extension trial of P-Monofer-
IDA-01, P-Monofer-IDA-03, and P-Monofer-CKD-04 trials where the aim is to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of IV iron isomaltoside re -dosing. 
2.2 Iron Isomaltoside 
Iron isomaltoside is a complex between iron and a carbohydrate moiety. The carbohydrate 
isomaltoside 1000 is a purely linear chemical structure as shown by 13C nuclear magnetic re s-
onance (NMR) of repeating α- (1-6) linked glucopyranose residues. Thus, it is structurally 
different from the branched dextran polysaccharides present in iron dextran. Isomaltoside 
[ADDRESS_740309] been chemically 
modified to further reduce the potential for anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction. Thus, iso-
maltoside 1000 is not a dextran [Jahn et al., 2011].

Protocol Version: 2.0 (amendment 1)  
Date of Document :  14 June 2017  
  
Confidential    Page 16 of 43 Iron isomaltoside has strongly bound iron within the iron isomaltoside formulation, which 
enables a controlled, slow release of bioavailable iron to the iron-binding proteins with only a 
little risk of free iron toxicity [Jahn et al., 2011]. This allows flexible dosing, including high 
and rapid dosing. 
Following IV administration, iron isomaltoside is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_317059] o-
endothelial system, particularly in the liver and spleen. Due to its molecular weight it is not 
eliminated by [CONTACT_8212] [Monofer® Investigator 's Brochure, current version ]. 
Iron isomaltoside is available as aqueous solution for injection containing 100 mg iron/m l 
with pH between 5.[ADDRESS_740310] been 4-12 weeks trials and long-term trials are warranted to fo l-
low-up on long-term safety. One randomised, comparative, open-label, 5-weeks trial with iron 
isomaltoside 1000 has been carried out (P-Monofer-IDA-01) and two randomised, compar a-
tive, open-label, 8-weeks trials with iron isomaltoside is going to be initiated in subjects with 
IDA (P-Monofer-IDA-03) and NDD-CKD subjects with IDA (P-Monofer-CKD-04). This 
trial is a 6-months extension trial of P-Monofer-IDA-01, P-Monofer-IDA-03 , and P-Monofer-
CKD-04 trials where the aim is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IV iron isomaltoside re-
dosing. Some subjects from the lead-in trials (P-Monofer-IDA-01, P-Monofer-IDA-03, and P-
Monofer-CKD-04) will need re-dosing in order to maintain their Hb above a certain thres h-
old. Hence, the intention in this trial is to re-do se subjects when Hb is going down, but not 
necessarily to a more severe stage of anaemia. On the other hand it is the intention not to e x-
pose subjects if there is an indication that there iron related parameters are too high.

10 INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCTS  
10.1 Description of Investigational Products 
Iron isomaltoside 
Iron isomaltoside is a complex between iron and a carbohydrate moiety. The carbohydrate 
isomaltoside 1000 is a purely linear chemical structure as shown by 13C NMR of repeating α-
(1-6) linked glucopyranose residues. Thus, it is structurally different from the branched de x-
tran polysaccharides present in iron dextran. Isomaltoside [ADDRESS_740327] been chemically modified to further reduce the potential 
for anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reaction. Thus, isomaltoside 1000 is not a dextran [Jahn et al., 
2011]. 
Iron isomaltoside has strongly bound iron within the iron isomaltoside formulation, which 
enables a controlled, slow release of bioavailable iron to the iron-binding proteins with only a 
little risk of free iron toxicity [Jahn et al., 2011]. This allows flexible dosing, including high 
dose and rapid dosing. 
Following IV administration, iron isomaltoside is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_317059] o-
endothelial system, particularly in the liver and spleen. Due to its molecular weight, it is not 
eliminated by [CONTACT_8212] [Monofer® Investigator 's Brochure, current version ]. 
Iron isomaltoside is available as aqueous solution for injection/infusion containing 100 mg 
iron/mL with pH between 5.0 and 7.0. 
10.2 Dosage, Administration and Blinding of Trial Drug 
Subjects will be dosed with a single infusion of 1000 mg iron isomaltoside diluted in 100 mL 
0.9 % sodium chloride and given over approximately [ADDRESS_740328] dose will be ap-
plied. 
No premedication (e.g. antihistamine or steroids) is allowed before administration of the trial 
drug. If the subject is in daily treatment for e.g. allergy or asthma this is not considered as 
"premedication" and may be continu ed.

extension trial. If the ESA treatment is terminated between the lead-in trial and this extension 
trial, the wash-out period is 4 weeks before the screening visit in this trial. 
11.2 Prohibited Medications and Non-drug Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_317065] (e.g. antihistamine or steroids) is allowed before administration of the trial 
drug. If the subject is in daily treatment for e.g. allergy or asthma this is not considered as 
"premedication" and may be continued. 
The following medication and non-drug therapy are not allowed during the trial period since 
they could potentially have an impact on the endpoints: 
 Any iron supplementation other than investigational drug (nutritional supplementation 
including iron is allowed unless it is assumed as treatment of the subject's anaemia) 
 Blood transfusion 
ESAs are also prohibited medication unless the subject was treated with ESA in the lead- in 
trial or has received a stable dose (+/- 20 %) 4 weeks before the screening visit in this trial.  
12 ADVERSE EVENTS  
12.1 Definition of Adverse Events 
An AE is defined in the ICH-GCP guideline as “any untoward medical occurrence in a subject 
or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not ne c-
essarily have a causal relationship with this treatment” (ICH E6:1.2). An AE can therefore be 
any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. A clin-
ically significant abnormal laboratory finding is also regarded as an AE if the effect is unf a-
vourable for the subject. It is the responsibility of the Investigator to review the laboratory test 
results and determine whether an abnormal laboratory value is clinically significant. In gen-
eral, a clinically significant laboratory value which suggests disease progression and/or r e-
quires active management is considered as an AE. Clinical significant efficacy laboratory p a-
rameters (including related parameters) are not to be recorded as AEs unless these are consid-
ered lack of efficacy or overdose.  
Trial ID: P-Monofer-IDA/CKD -EXT-01  
Protocol Version: 2.0 (amendment 1)  
Date of Document :  14 June 2017  
  
Confidential    Page 28 of 43 Clinical significant findings in physical examinations and ECGs are to be recorded as medical 
history if they are observed at baseline. Otherwise they should be recorded as AEs.  
Worsening of a pre-existing medical condition (e.g. cancer or diabetes) must also be recorded 
as an AE (e.g. if there is an increase in severity, frequency, duration of the condition or wor s-
ening of outcome). Pre-planned procedures and pre-existing medical conditions (planned or 
present at the time of signing the ICF) that have not worsened are not considered AEs. These 
are recorded on the medical history pages of the electronic case report form (eCRF).  
12.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an AE that  
 is fatal 
 is life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death) 
 requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_317066] (a min i-
mum of an overnight stay in a health care facility) 
 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 is a medically important event or reaction 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other situations 
should be considered serious such as important medical events that might not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_317067].  
If the above interventions are performed as standard of care and not associated with an AE, 
the health issue for which the intervention is being performed will not be considered an SAE. 
If there is a complication as a result of the procedure and the complication meets at least [ADDRESS_740332] is an AE that is judged by [CONTACT_317108] A/S to be “related ” or 
“possible related” to the trial drug (see classification of relatedness in Section 12.4).  
If the ADR fulfils at least 1 of the criterion for an SAE, it is considered a serious adverse rea c-
tion (SAR). If the SAR is not listed as an expected side effect for iron isomaltoside [Monofer® 
Investigator’s Brochure, current version], it is considered a suspected unexpected serious ad-
verse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R).  
It is the responsibility of Pharmacosmos A/S to evaluate the SARs for expectedness. 
12.4 Collection of Adverse Events 
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs (as defined in Section 12.1) observed 
by [CONTACT_317109]-
ject’s medical record as well as in the AE pages of the e CRF. 
Screen failures: All SAEs will be reported in the eCRF from the time a subject has signed the 
ICF and until he/she exits the trial. Non-serious AEs occurring in subjects who are never 
treated with the trial drug will not be collected.

Confidential    Page 29 of 43 Treated subjects: From the time a subject has signed the ICF and until he/she exits the trial, 
all AEs/SAEs will be reported in the eCRF. AEs/SAEs occurring before administration of the 
trial drug are considered as non -treatment emergent, and those occurring after administration 
of the trial drug are considered as treatment emergent.   
If a subject is permanently withdrawn from the trial because of an AE, this information must 
be included in the final visit form. 
An AE should be described in the following manner: The nature of the event will be described 
in precise, standard medical terminology (i.e. not necessarily the exact words used by [CONTACT_17210]-
ject). If known, a specific diagnosis should be stated. Furthermore, the Investigator should 
describe an AE regarding seriousness (see Section 12.2), severity, relatedness, action taken, 
and outcome.  
Severity 
 Mild: The AE does not interfere in a significant manner with the subject’s normal 
functioning level, but may be an annoyance 
 Moderate: The AE produces some impairment of functioning but is not hazardous to 
health, but is uncomfortable and/or an embarrassment 
 Severe: The AE produces significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation and 
is a hazard to the subject 
Relatedness 
 Related: The AE is related to the medicinal product  
 Possible related: A causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed  
 Unlikely related: The event is most likely related to an aetiology other than the medi c-
inal product 
 Not related: No relatedness to the medicinal product 
The categories "related" and "possible related" will be classified as related AEs and the cat e-
gories "unlikely related" and "not related" will be classified as unrelated AEs in the clinical 
study report (CSR). 
Outcome 
 Recovered/resolved: Complete clinical recovery without any sequel attributable to the 
event as per Investigator’s discretion 
 Recovered/resolved with sequelae: Complete clinical recovery but with one or more 
sequels attributable to the event as per Investigator’s discretion 
 Recovering/resolving: The condition is improving and the subject is expected to r e-
cover from the event. This term should only be used when the subject has completed 
the trial 
 Not recovered/not resolved: The subject’s condition has not improved and the symp-
toms are unchanged 
 Fatal 
 Unknown: The subject’s condition is unknown. This term should only be used when 
no other definition is possible e.g. the subject is lost to follow-up

15.6 Safety Analyses 
The incidence of treatment-emergent ADRs and SARs will be presented, including two-sided 
95 % confidence interval (CI). 
AEs will be classified according to the time of onset: 
 Non-treatment  emergent AE – an AE  that starts after the subject has signed the ICF but 
before the subject receives iron isomaltoside  in this extension trial 
 Treatment emergent  AE (TEAE) – an AE that starts after the subject receives iron 
isomaltoside  in this extension trial  
AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) current 
version. Related or possible related AE’s are defined as ADRs. 
AEs will be summary tabulated by [CONTACT_563494]. Number of subjects who experience an ADR 
including S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be compared between treatment groups.  
The following AE listings will be made as a minimum: 
 Non-treatment emergent AEs in treated subjects 
 TEAEs (non-serious and serious)  
 Treatment emergent SAEs  
 SAEs in subjects not receiving treatment in the extension trial (e.g. screen failures) 
 ADRs 
 AEs leading to dose reduction or withdrawal from treatment 
 Fatal SAEs 
 Serious or severe hypersensitivity reactions 
 Composite cardiovascular AEs 
Physical examinations and measurements of vital signs, height,  weight, ECG, and safety l a-
boratory parameters will be tabulated by [CONTACT_765].

values) need to be ≥ 2 × ULN. 
Symptoms indicative of ischemia will need to have been present for > [ADDRESS_740349] tightness. Dyspnoea, diaphoresis, or nausea may 
be considered symptoms of ischemia and will be judged based on the totality of the clinica l 
evidence.

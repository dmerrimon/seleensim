AL amyloidosis and Monoclonal Immunoglob ulin Deposition Disease (MIDD) are two related entities 
associated with unde rlying plasma cell dyscrasia.  Although both diseases are caused by [CONTACT_621091]-folding 
and depo sition in various organs of abno rmal immunoglobu lin light chains (sometimes intact 
immunoglobulin s) secreted by [CONTACT_678321], the molecular mechanisms differ and lead 
to dissimilar pathologi c and clinical finding s. In both diseases however, this immunoglobuli n 
depo sition results in organ dysfunction, morbidity and ultimately death. 
 
Treatment of both diseases is aimed at eradicating the plasma cells that produce the pathologic light 
chain.  Because of the similarity to multiple myeloma (MM), a much more common disorder, patients 
have typi[INVESTIGATOR_678287], most commonly melphalan , 
prednisone, dexamethasone, VAD (Vincristine, Adriamycin, and Prednisone) and more recently in 
the case of AL amyloidosis, newer agen ts like thalidomide, bortezomib and revlimid. While the 
treatment of MM continues to evolve and has resulted in improved outcomes for patients, the 
treatment of amyloidosis and especially MIDD has lagged behind, mainly because of the small 
number of patients reported in the literature. Nevertheless, the goal of treatment remains 
achievement of complete hematologic remission and complete suppression of light chain production, 
which is key to achieving organ response in both AL and MIDD.  However, because of distinct 
pathologic characteristics and increased susceptibility to toxicity due to organ dysfunction compared 
to MM patients, the treatment applied to MM canno t be extrapolated to these diseases. Patients with 
AL amyloidosis and MIDD would bene fit from clinical studies addressing specifically these diseases. 
 
This clinical trial is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], single arm study that examines the tolerability/toxicity, and estimates the 
efficacy of a comprehen sive treatment approach in the manage ment of MIDD and AL amyloido sis. 
The treatment includes 3 phases: Pre-transplant bortezomib based induction 
(Bortezomib/Dexamethasone or BD); followed by [CONTACT_678322] (HD M/ASCT); and post-transplant consolidation/maintenance therapy with BD. This 
3-phase approach is highl y effective in multiple myeloma but has never been tested in patients with 
MIDD or in patients with AL amyloidosis. The goal of the treatment is to achieve a high rate of 
complete hematologic remission which is necessary for organ improvement.   If this pi[INVESTIGATOR_678288], we will develop a larger phase II study that we will propose as a coope rative 
group trial, adop ting this comprehen sive approach to these 2 rare diseases. 
 
The 3 phases of treatment include: 
 
1. Induction therapy consisting of one to three 21-day-cycles of BD (Patients achieving CR after one 
or two cycles could forgo remaining cycle(s)): 
 
Bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2  IV or Subcutaneou s Injection (SQ) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11

2. HD M/ASCT performed with risk-adap ted doses of melphala n IV at 100, 140, or 200 mg/m 2. 
 
3. Post-transplant consolidation/maintenance consisting of six cycles of BD each given every 12

3.0     BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
 
 
3.1     Upfront Treatment of Multiple Myeloma 
 
Multiple myeloma is a malignan t plasma cell proliferative disorder that accounts for an estimated 
15,000 new cancer cases per year in the [LOCATION_002], as well as approximately 11,000 deaths 1. 
Based on the [LOCATION_008] ([LOCATION_006]) Myeloma Forum and the Nordic Myeloma Study Group 
recommenda tions2  and National Comprehen sive Cancer Network (NCCN) Practice Guidel ines 3, 
chemotherapy is indicated for the manage ment of myeloma presenting with myeloma-related organ 
damage (referred to as symptomatic myeloma as oppo sed to asymptomatic myeloma). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_678289], multiple myeloma remains an incurable disease and relapse 
occurs in almost all patients, with a median survival period of 5 to 7 years 4,5.

Approval date: [ADDRESS_917904] front-line treatment for patients with symptomatic multiple myeloma who are deemed 
eligible for transplantation, consists of 2 phases of treatment: The first is referred to as the ―initial‖ 
therapy and consists of various combinations of therapeutic agents. The second consists of high 
dose melphala n followed by [CONTACT_12676] (HD M/ASCT)4,5. 
 
3.1.1  Initial therapy 
The regimens currently recommende d in the NCCN guidelines for initial therapy of MM in patients 
who are candida tes for HD M/ASCT include dexamethasone, thalidomide/dexamethasone, 
revlimid/dexamethasone, liposomal doxorubicin/vincristine/dexamethasone (DVD), as well as 
several bortezomib based regimens. Indee d, In previously untreated patients, bortezomib has shown 
activity as a single agent6-8  and also in combination with dexamethasone6,9, 
thalido mide/dexamethasone10,11,  melpha lan/prednisone (MP)12,13, dexamethasone/adriamycin14,15 as 
well as revlimid/dexamethasone.  There are currently several large phase III rando mized studies 
ongoin g worldwide examining the role of bortezomib in both the transplant and non-transplant 
settings. It is widely accepted that in patients who will undergo HDM/ASCT, melphal an-containing 
regimens should be avoided since stem cell collection may be subsequen tly hampered. 
 
Bortezomib, a potent, reversible, and specific inhibi tor of the proteasome, is a first-in-class 
antineoplastic cytotoxic agen t. It was the first proteasome inhibi tor to enter the clinic and is the first 
approved for any clinical indication. Bortezomib specifically and selectively inhibits proteasome 
function by [CONTACT_678327] (Ki=0.6 nM) and reversibly to the enzyme‘s chymotrypsin-like site. It is 
highly selective for the proteasome as exemplified in a screen of related and unrelated proteases 
where no significant inhibitory activity was seen. The mechanism of action of bortezomib as a 
cytotoxic agen t is described in more details below. 
 
On June 20, 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved bortezomib for injection for the 
treatment of patients with multiple myeloma. This approval results from a clinical trial using 
Bortezomib as an initial treatment for patients with multiple myeloma. 
 
3.1.[ADDRESS_917905] been two large prospective trials in [LOCATION_009] (IFM 90) and in [LOCATION_006] (MRC 9), and one large 
retrospective study of myeloma patients in Nordic countries, showing a survival benefit for ASCT 
compared to conventional chemotherapy16 -18. In the larger study, IFM 90, newly diagno sed untreated 
patients less than [ADDRESS_917906] after up 
to 6 cycles of VMCP alternating with BCNU, vincristine, doxorubicin and prednisone (BVAP) or 
conventional chemotherapy with [ADDRESS_917907] regimen was 
MEL 140 mg/m2 and TBI, and recombinan t interferon alpha (IFNα) was administered to patients in 
both groups until relapse. By [CONTACT_104992]-to-treat, SCT patients had a significantly higher response rate 
(CR+VGPR 38% versus 14%) than those receiving conventional chemotherapy. At a median follow- 
up of [ADDRESS_917908] confirmed these results althoug h the 
dose of melphala n given was 200 mg/m2  and radiation therapy was not used. Based on these trials, 
autologous stem cell transplantation using melphalan 200 mg/m [ADDRESS_917909] 
treatment of symptomatic multiple myeloma. 
 
In patient with renal insufficiency, transplantation with melphal an 200 mg/m2  has resulted in high rate 
of side effects, especially severe mucositis. Lower doses have been studied in the literature for 
these patients. The dose of melpha lan 140 mg/m 2 has been chosen in this clinical trial for patients 
with abno rmal creatinine clearance because it has been shown to be safer than melphal an 200 
mg/m2  and has been widely used in patients with renal dysfunction 19- 22. This dose has become the 
standa rd of care nowadays for transplantation in patients with renal insufficiency and a creatinine

clearance < 50 ml/min. Our experience at MSKCC also suppo rts this observation and this dose has 
been adop ted as standa rd of care for patients with creatinine clearance less than 50 ml/min. 
 
3.1.[ADDRESS_917910] Transplant Therapy 
 
HDM/ASCT has improved response rate and overall survival rate in patients with MM, but all patients 
eventually relapse. Clinical trials have investigated the use of consolidation and maintenan ce 
therapy post-transplant to extend the duration of response. 
 
In a large study23, [ADDRESS_917911], patients were rando mly assigned to receive no maintenan ce 
(group A), pamidronate (group B), or pamidronate plus thalidomide (group C; 400 mg/day, dose 
reduction to a minimum dose of 50 mg was allowed for treatment-related toxicity). At least VGPR was 
achieved in 55% of patients (group A), 57% of patients (group B), and 67% of patients (group C; P = 
.03). The 3-year EFS was 36% (group A), 37% (group B), and 52% (group C; P < .009). The 4-year 
OS was 77% (group A), 74% (group B), and 87% (group C; P < .04). Patients received thalido mide 
for a median of 15 months and the mean dose of thalidomide was 200 mg/day. In another study24  
thalidomide (200 mg/day for a maximum of 12 months) combined with prednisolone (50 mg on 
alternate days) was compared with prednisolone alone as maintenan ce after ASCT. At 12 months 
after rando mization, the thalidomide group had higher PR rate (83% vs 52%; P 
< .01), better 2-year PFS (63% vs 36%; P < .001), and better 3-year OS (86% vs 75%; P = .02). In a 
more recent study25, patients with newly diagno sed MM were rando mly assigned to receive either a 
single ASCT followed by [CONTACT_678328]. Single ASCT followed by 
[CONTACT_678329] 3- year PFS (85% vs 57%; P 
= .02) and 3-year OS (85% vs 65%; P = .04). 
 
Importantly, preliminary studies from two major large studies recently presented at the last ASCO 
meeting in [ADDRESS_917912] HDC/ASCT as standa rd of care for 
MM. Both studies have shown a statistically significant improvement in the progression free survival 
when patients were treated with maintenance therapy with Revlimid after HD M/ASCT. The 
improvement in overall survival is currently not established26,27. 
A recent study using the combination of bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone following a 
single autologous transplant demonstrated that it is feasible to administer [ADDRESS_917913]-transplant.  With this approach, responses were improved and a proportion of 
patients (18%) became PCR nega tive for molecularly detectable residual disease.  Although the 
follow up remains short, no patient who achieved molecular remission relapsed at a median follow 
up of [ADDRESS_917914] transplant maintenan ce and/or consolidation therapy in 
multiple myeloma is widely accepted. Several studies are currently investigating the use of 
bortezomib in the maintenan ce setting. 
 
3.2  Monoclonal Immunoglobuli n Deposition Disease 
 
Monoclonal immunoglob ulin deposition disease (MIDD) is a broad entity encompassing several 
conditions that result from the depo sition of a monoclonal paraprotein in various organs (For 
Review29-31). It includes light chain deposition disease (LCDD ), the most common patholog y; light 
and heavy chain deposition disease (LHCDD ); and heavy chain deposition disease (HCDD ). The 
latter two conditions are rare and have been poorly characterized in the literature.  The major organ 
target in MIDD is the kidney, where the monoclonal paraprotein depo sits within the glomerular 
basement membranes, mesangiu m, tubula r basement membranes and vessel walls. This depo sition 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_418359] a nodular sclerosing glomerulopa thy that eventually manifests with neph rotic 
syndrome, hypertension and renal insufficiency. Less commonly, other visceral organs can be 
involved, including heart and liver29,30,32- 36. Also classified among MIDD is another entity known as

light chain crystal depo sition disease (LCCDD ) described initially by [CONTACT_678330]37. . The pathology in 
this condition consists of light chain depo sition forming intracellula r crystals in histiocytes and renal 
parenchymal cells, particularly the proximal tubular epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], with variable involvement of other 
organs. Proximal tubula r involvement typi[INVESTIGATOR_678290] (LCFS), 
which is characterized clinically by [CONTACT_24975] 2 renal tubula r acidosis (RTA) that associates a non anion 
gap metaboli c acidosis with hypopho sphatemia, glucosuria, and hypouricemia. 
 
MIDD results from the production of a monoclonal paraprotein (light chain, heavy chain, or both) and 
is therefore associated with an unde rlying plasma cell dyscrasia that may or may not be evident at 
the time patients first present. The majority of patients will ultimately be diagno sed with multiple 
myeloma29,30,38. Using the recently developed Free Light Chain Assay that is more sensitive for the 
detection of serum free light chains, it is likely that virtually all patients with MIDD will have a 
monoclonal free light chain detected in the serum. 
 
3.2.[ADDRESS_917915] 
commonly melphala n and prednisone and VAD (Vincristine, Adriamycin, and Prednisone) 29,39,40. In a 
few small series, investigators have reported that high-dose chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_391427] (HD M/ASCT) can be associated with bene ficial results while toxicity 
remains acceptable in this group of patients29,41-45. HDM/ASCT is a therapeutic modali ty currently 
accepted as the standa rd of care for patients with multiple myeloma who are less than 65 years of 
age. Weichman et al. described 6 patients, 5 with LCDD and 1 with LCCDD , who were treated with 
HDM/ASCT and who achieved a good outcome with acceptable and expected toxicity44. As 
described in the present report, most patients had complete hematologic remission followed by [CONTACT_678331]. Royer et al have reported their 
experience in 11 patients with LHCDD who received a variety of therapeu tic regimens. They also 
observed an overall favorable outcome, including complete hematologic remission in five patients 
with improvement of kidney function in four42, and several patients with cardiac and/or hepa tic 
involvement who experienced functional improvement after stem cell transplantation. More recently, 
Lorenz et al. reported the long-term outcome after autologou s stem cell transplantation of six 
patients. Althoug h one patient did not survive the procedure, [ADDRESS_917916] to the minimal

patients. 
 
3.2.2  MSKCC Experience with HDM/ASCT in MIDD 
 
We have recently reported our retrospective review of all patients with MIDD who were treated with 
HDM/ASCT at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center between 2004 and 200747. We identified 7 
patients with monoclonal plasma cell dyscrasia and MIDD who unde rwent HDM/ASCT. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Patient Characteristics 
 
Six patients were male; the median age was 50 (range 33 to 52). All fulfilled criteria for multiple 
myeloma.  The median percentage of plasma cells in the bone marrow was 21 % (10 to 41 %) and 
immunohi stochemical stainin g for light chain isotype showed kappa clonality in all cases. Serum 
protein electrophoresis showed a monoclonal spi[INVESTIGATOR_678291], while serum immunofixation 
showed an IgG kappa monoclonal band in two patients. All seven patients, however, had elevated

serum free kappa light chains and an abno rmal kappa-to-lambda ratio with median s of 52.4 mg/dL 
(5.3 to 385 mg/dL) and 18.34 (3.01 to 203.7), respectively. The monoclonal protein deposited in the 
kidney consisted of free kappa light chains in all five patients with LCDD , kappa light chain and 
gamma heavy chain in the patient with LHCDD , and intratubula r crystals of kappa light chain in the 
patient with LCCD D and Fanconi syndrome.  The median β2 microglobuli n was 9.2 mg/L (2.3 to 18.4 
mg/L) and the median serum albumin level 4.4 gm/dL (3.5 to 4.6 mg/L). Using the International 
Staging System (ISS), five patients had stage III and two stage I disease. All patients were stage IB 
by [CONTACT_79082]-Salmon classification. Cytogene tic analysis in all seven patients and FISH analyses in 
three demonstrated no chromosomal aberrations. 
 
All seven patients had hypertension that was controlled by [CONTACT_78763]. The patient 
with intracytoplasmic light chain crystal depo sition (LCCDD ) presented with renal insufficiency 
(serum creatinine of 1.6 mg/dl; creatinine clearance 40 ml/min) and Fanconi syndrome (with type II 
renal tubular acidosis (RTA II) and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, glycosuria, and 
aminoaciduria). The median serum creatinine was 4.6 (1.6 to 6.1), median creatinine clearance 35 
ml/min (11 to 79 ml/min), and median 24-hour proteinuria 4373 mg (237 to 8525 mg). Three patients 
(patients 1, 6 and 7) presented with severe acute renal failure necessitating initiation of dialysis 
within 2 weeks of initial presentation. These patients continued dialysis through out the entire 
treatment including the transplant period. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Histopathologi c Finding s on Renal Biopsy 
 
All patients unde rwent a diagnostic renal biopsy. The five patients with LCDD and the single patient 
with LHCDD displayed a nodular sclerosing glomerulopa thy with characteristic immunofluorescence 
profile and correspondin g electron dense deposits.  The glomerular capi[INVESTIGATOR_678292]-Schiff 
(PAS)-positive, trichrome-blue and weakly argyrophilic.  There was variable thickening of glomerular 
basement membranes, Bowman‘s capsule, tubula r basement membranes and vessel w alls by [CONTACT_276754]- 
positive material.  These depo sits typi[INVESTIGATOR_678293]-like, glassy thickening s of the tubular 
basement membranes, associated with focal tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. One patient with 
LCDD also exhibited several atypi[INVESTIGATOR_678294], lamellated casts of the myeloma type.  In [ADDRESS_917917] to the patients with LCDD /LHCDD , microscopic examination of the patient with light chain 
crystal depo sition disease revealed no evidence of glomerular disease.  The proximal tubular 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_678295] r cytoplasmic expansion caused by [CONTACT_678332] t intracellular crystalline 
inclusions that deformed the cells.  The intracytoplasmic crystals stained PAS-nega tive, trichrome- 
red and silver-negative.  The proximal tubular cells displayed acute injury, including focal shedding 
of tubula r cells into the tubular lumen, loss of brush border, luminal ectasia and regene rative nuclear 
atypia.  In the medulla, a single atypi[INVESTIGATOR_678296].  Tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis affected 10% of the cortex.  Immunofluorescence 
performed on pronase-digested paraffin sections showed intense diffuse staining for kappa light 
chain in the distribution of the proximal tubula r intracellular crystals and the single atypi[INVESTIGATOR_678297], with 
nega tive staining for lambda light chain.  By [CONTACT_46106], glomeruli were unremarkable, and 
no electron dense depo sits were identified involving renal basement membranes.  Intracytoplasmic

crystals were demonstrated in proximal tubula r epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663].  The findings were interpreted as 
consistent with the special form of LCCDD known as kappa light chain Fanconi syndrome (KLCFS). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment Received and Toxicity 
 
The initial therapy prior to HD M/ASCT included thalidomide (escalated to 200 mg daily) and 
dexamethasone in pulses (40 mg on days 1-4, 9-12, and 17-20) given for 3 cycles (n = 2), 
dexamethasone pulses alone for 3 cycles (n = 3), melphala n and dexamethasone for 5 cycles (n = 
1), and doxorubicin and dexamethasone for 2 cycles (n = 1). Following initial therapy, five patients 
were mobilized with high-dose cyclopho sphamide (3 gm/m2) and G-CSF, and two with G-CSF alone 
(10 mcg/kg daily prior to leukaphe resis for 10 days). All seven patients proceede d to HD M/ASCT 
and received melpha lan as conditioning regimen at 140 mg/m 2 divided on days -3 and -2. Stem cells 
were infused on day 0. Patients received a mean of 5.8 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg (3.6 to 8.3 x 106 
CD34+ cells/kg). 
 
HDM/ASCT was well tolerated. There was no mortality. All patients completed the planne d treatment 
without major or unusual complications. Routine transfusion of blood products, prophylactic broad- 
spectrum antibiotics, hydration, and analgesic medications for mucositis were administered to all 
patients. The non-hematologic adverse events included : Neutropenic fever (n=5); mucositis requiring 
intravenous analge sic medication administered by [CONTACT_228597] (n=2); nausea requiring antiemetics (n=6); 
transient rash (n=2); an epi[INVESTIGATOR_678298] (n=1); abdominal cramps of 
uncertain etiology (n=1). Three patients who were on dialysis prior to HDM/ASCT continued dialysis 
throughou t the course of transplant. In these patients, melphala n was given after dialysis. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Response to Therapy 
 
At the completion of initial therapy, four patients had achieved a PR, 2 a CR, and one a uCR (no 
bone marrow biopsy available for confirmation of CR in this patient). Six of the seven patients 
achieved a hematologic CR after HDM/ASCT. The patient with LCCD D achieved a VGPR as 
reflected by [CONTACT_678333] (i.e. > 90% reduction in the level 
of free kappa light chain). This patient showed evidence of hematologic progression 8 months after 
transplant. He is currently being evaluated for a second autologou s stem cell transplantation 
followed by [CONTACT_678334]-matched sibling . With a median follow 
up time of 23.6 months (range 7.9 to 69.8 months), all other patients remain in hematologic CR. 
 
Among the four patients who were dialysis independ ent at the time of HD M/ASCT, the serum 
creatinine has improved in two (patients 3 and 5), remained stable in one (patient 4) who achieved 
hematologic PR), and worsened in one (patient 2), leadin g to hemodialysis despi[INVESTIGATOR_678299] 
(see figure 4). Proteinuria has improved significantly in the four patients shortly after HD M/ASCT. 
However, we should caution that althoug h an improvement in the proteinuria may reflect 
improvement of the renal function, it may also reflect worsening of the disease due to a decrease in 
the glomerular filtration, as exemplified by [CONTACT_4676] 2 whose proteinuria continued to improve despi[INVESTIGATOR_678300]. The three patients who were dialysis -dependen t at the time of 
HDM/ASCT achieved hematologic CR. Two of them have unde rgone kidney transplantation 14.1 
and 45.7 months after HD M/ASCT (patients 1 and 7), and have a normal creatinine clearance 35.9 
and 69.8 months after HD M/ASCT. The kidney transplantation was deemed reasonabl e in these 
patients since they had achieved a hematologic CR and had no co-morbid condition otherwise. The 
third patient (patient 6) who also remains in hematologic CR became dialysis independen t after 
HDM/ASCT for a period of 2 months following improvement in his creatinine, but has resumed 
peritonea l dialysis mainly for symptomatic relief (nausea) and despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a stable creatinine. 
Discontinuation of his peritoneal dialysis is currently being contemplated.

3.3  Amyloido sis 
 
Systemic AL amyloido sis is a plasma cell dyscrasia that results from mis -foldin g of abno rmal 
immunoglobuli n free light chains (FLC) that form fibrils and deposit as amorphou s, congophili c 
extracellula r deposits. These depo sits occur in key viscera such as the kidneys, heart, and liver and 
in the peripheral nervous system48. As systemic depo sits of amyloid fibrils accumulate, they disrupt 
organ function leading to organ dysfunction, morbidity and ultimately death. The initial presentation 
is variable depending on the organ(s) affected. Initial presentations include a nephrotic-range 
proteinuria with or without renal insufficiency, conge stive cardiomyopathy, unexplained 
hepa tomegaly, and sensorimotor and/or autonomic peripheral neuropathy. The disorder has an 
incidence of 8 to 13 per million persons per year, similar to that of chronic myelogen ous leukemia. 
AL is approximately one-fifth as common as multiple myeloma but is more devastating in that the 
median survival of patients seen within 1 month of diagnosis is 13.2 months 49. Moreover, for those 
who present with conge stive heart failure the median survival is 4 months, and historically less than 
5% of all AL patients survive 10 years or more from diagno sis 48,50. 
 
Achievement of a hematologic response with normalization of the serum FLCs is associated with 
organ responses and improved survival.. Therefore, the main goal of treatment in AL amyloidosis is 
directed at eradication of the FLC producing plasma cell clone, leading to suppression of the 
abno rmal FLC production and deposition in various organs. 
 
3.3.1  Treatment of AL amyloido sis 
 
The median survival of patients with AL was only 18 months in those treated with oral melpha lan 
and prednisone in a large phase III trial condu cted for newly diagno sed untreated patients; those 
receiving colchicine alone had a median survival of eight months51. These results highlight that 
limited progress had been made in reversing AL amyloidosis until the mid 1990 's when HD M/ASCT 
was introduced for the treatment of this disease52,53. The effectiveness of HD M/ASCT  in reversing 
the clinical manifestations of AL amyloido sis in nearly two-thirds of surviving patients has been 
documented at numerous centers. Amyloid P componen t radionu clide scans have demonstrated 
resorption of amyloid deposits after reduction or elimination of the plasma cell clone(16-18). As the 
production of abnormal FLC is halted and amyloid resorbed, both the performance status and the 
quali ty of life of AL patients can improve54. 
 
However, in the early years of SCT for AL, the average [ADDRESS_917918] has range d from 
13% to 43%, which demonstrated that AL patients who unde rgo HD M/ASCT are prone to major 
adverse events54-56. In these early studies, transplant-related mortality was high because multiple 
viscera of AL amyloidosis patients were significantly compromised by [CONTACT_90050], rendering 
patients susceptible to toxicity. Therefore, refinement of patient selection and improvement of peri- 
transplant clinical manage ment became priorities. In 2007, a French group condu cted a randomized 
trial comparing high-dose intravenou s melphala n followed by [CONTACT_678335]-dose melphala n 
plus dexamethasone in patients with AL amyloido sis. Fifty patients were enrolled in each group. The 
results were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis, with overall survival as the primary end point. 
After a median follow-up of [ADDRESS_917919] — 5 from multiorgan 
failure with acute renal failure, 2 from sepsis, and 2 from cardiac arrhythmia. The transplant-related 
mortality was 24%57. However this study was criticized because ASCT was performed in small 
centers where expertise in transplantation for amyloidosis patients may have been subop timal.

Approval date: [ADDRESS_917920]. At the same time, patients 
with 1 or 2 organs symptomatically involved and those with uncomplicated cardiac disease were 
appropriate  candidates for stem cell transplantation, provided the dose of intravenous melphala n 
was attenua ted based on age and organ compromise. This risk-adap ted approach based on extent 
of organ involvement,  dose-related differences in toxicity, (8,22)and on the age-related differences 
in survival has improved the safety of high dose chemotherapy (Cohen BJH publication) and has 
been adop ted by [CONTACT_678336]. 
 
3.3.2  Recent experience with HDM/ASCT followed by [CONTACT_678325]/maintenance 
therapy at MSKCC 
 
In the first of a series of trials condu cted at MSKCC using the risk-adap ted approach,  IRB #02-031, a 
phase II trial evaluated risk-adap ted HD M/ASCT followed by [CONTACT_149618] (D) and thalidomide (T) 
in an attempt to reduce treatment related mortality (TRM) and overcome any loss of efficacy as a 
result of attenua ted melphala n dosing58.  Patients (n = 45) with newly diagno sed AL involving < or =2 
organ systems were assigned to MEL 100, 140, or 200 mg/m(2) with SCT, based on age, renal 
function and cardiac involvement. Patients with persistent clonal plasma cell disease [ADDRESS_917921] received 9 months of consolidation with TD (or D if there was a history of deep vein thrombosis 
or neuropathy). Organ involved included kidney (67%), heart (24%), liver/GI (22%) and peripheral 
nervous system (18%), with 31% of patients having two organs involved. TRM was 4.4%. Thirty-one 
patients bega n adjuvant therapy, with 16 (52%) completing 9 months of treatment and 13 (42%) 
achieving an improvement in hematological response. By [CONTACT_7586]-to-treat, overall hematological 
response rate was 71% (36% complete response), with 44% having organ responses. With a 
median follow-up of 31 months, 2-year survival was 84% (95% confidence interval: 73%, 94%). This 
clinical trial showed that risk-adap ted HDCT/SCT with consolida tion TD is feasible and results in low 
TRM and high hematological and organ response rates in patients with AL amyloidosis. 
 
Improved efficacy and toxicity profiles of bortezom ib compared to thalido mide in multiple myeloma, 
prompted us to initiate a new phase II clinical trial in amyloidosis in 2007 .  We used the same 
strategy of risk-adap ted HDC/ASCT followed by [CONTACT_678337]/dexamethasone (BD) 
in patients with 1 or 2 organ involvement without advanced heart disease. At the 2009 meeting of 
the American Society of Hematology, we presented the two-year upda te for this phase II trial 59. 
Patients with newly diagnosed AL involving <=2 organs were assigned to HD M/ASCT with 
melphala n 100, 140 or 200mg/m2 based on age, renal function and cardiac involvement. Responses 
were assessed at 2-[ADDRESS_917922] received treatment with BD for up to 6 cycles (two 21-day, four 35- 
day cycles).  Thirty-seven patients were enrolled with kidney (68%), heart (43%), liver/GI (14%) and 
peripheral nervous system (16%) involvement.  Forty-one percent had two organ involvement.  Four 
patients with advanced cardiac disease died within [ADDRESS_917923], resulting in a TRM of 12% 
(4/33).  With a median follow-up of [ADDRESS_917924] was 86%.  At 12 and 24 
mos, OS in patients with cardiac involvement was 69% and 49% respectively, versus 100% at both 
time points in those without (P = 0.001).  Sixty-eight percent (19/28) received consolidation with BD 
for persistent clonal plasma cell disease. At [ADDRESS_917925], the hematologic response rate in 
evaluable patients was 95% (20/21) with 62% achieving sCR and 60% having organ improvement. 
At [ADDRESS_917926], the overall response rate was 82% (14/17) including 53% who maintained a 
sCR and 88% (15/17) who had organ improvement. Organs continued to get better over time and 
92% (11/12) of patients with kidney involvement had organ responses at 24 mos versus 50% (7/14) 
at 12 mos.  Overall, 87% of patients who received BD improved their hematologic response. There 
was no correlation between the number of cycles received (median 6; range 1.25-6) and response 
and interestingly, all responde d after only [ADDRESS_917927] 
BD, 79% experienced grade III- IV toxicity, which was most often hematologic toxicity with

thrombocytopeni a in 41%.  Grade 2 or greater peripheral neuropathy was seen in 32% and became 
more prevalent as the number of consolidation cycles increased. 
 
This trial showed that in newly diagnosed patients with systemic AL amyloido sis, consolidation with 
BD following risk-adap ted SCT was safe and effective for eradicating persistent clonal plasma cell 
disease.  Hematologic responses were rapid (occurring after 1 cycle) resulting in high overall and 
unpreceden ted sCR rates.  Improvement in organ function was seen in the majority of patients and 
continues to occur over time.  Relapses are seen following completion of therapy, sugge sting that a 
consolida tion plus maintenan ce regimen following SCT may be worthy of further study. 
 
While consolidation following HD M/ASCT has shown promising results, a Phase II study evaluating 
the incorporation of bortezomib into the combination of melpha lan and dexamethasone as initial 
therapy (i.e. before HD M/ASCT) for AL amyloidosis has been unde rtaken and preliminary data has 
been recently reported60. Twenty-four of 29 patients evaluable on this trial (83 %) had a hematologic 
response with 13 CR (45%) and 16 PR. Organ improvement was seen in 2/10 with cardiac AL, 7/8 
with renal and 6/12 patients with nerve involvement.  Two of 7 patients without baseline neuropathy 
developed symptoms by [CONTACT_5265] 4.  (This trial showed that bortezomib incorporated in the initial 
therapy also shows promising activity in the treatment of AL. Importantly, this trial includes patients 
with amyloido sis as well as patients with MIDD. 
 
The data presented above in amyloidosis lays the ground for this more comprehen sive approach to 
the treatment of this disease, which incorporates pre-transplant bortezomib based initial therapy, 
risk-adap ted HD M/ASCT, followed by [CONTACT_678338]. 
 
 
3.[ADDRESS_917928] effective therapeu tic concepts used in multiple myeloma, is very promising. This treatment 
approach includes a highly active initial combination regimen, followed by [CONTACT_121270] M/ASCT and then 
post-ASCT consolida tion/maintenance therapy, which have been shown to increase the complete 
hematologic response (CR) and the overall survival (OS) in patients with multiple myeloma. The 
hematologic effectiveness of this aggressive regimen is crucial because even low levels of 
circulating free light chains may have deleterious organ consequen ces in MIDD and AL amyloido sis. 
Hence, one of the aims of therapy is to suppress the free light chain production to the greatest 
extent. The success of therapy in curbing organ dysfunction depend s on achieving and maintaining 
a complete hematologic remission. In this context, the comprehen sive and effective treatment 
approach used in this clinical trial is crucial for the achievement of a high CR rate. 
 
We and others have observed a unique sensitivity of these patients to bortezomib-based therapy 
with the majority of responses seen after only 1 cycle.  The incidence of neuropathy in this patient 
popula tion appears similar to that reported in patients with MM.  However the morbidity of 
neuropathy in MIDD and AL patients who are also at risk for both autonomic and sensory 
neuropathy may be greater than seen in MM.  Our experience with repea ted doses of BD as 
consolida tion following HDM/ASCT sugge sts dose-dependen t toxicity.  Given the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_678301], risk of toxicity, and incidence of relapse, within the context of this comprehen sive 
approach to treatment we propose 1-3 cycles of initial BD therapy (determined by [CONTACT_678339]) followed by 6 cycles of consolida tion/maintenance BD after HD M/ASCT with cycles 
administered every 12 weeks. 
 
Although our experience with HD M/ASCT and bortezomib as individual therapi[INVESTIGATOR_678302] , there is no precedent for such a comprehen sive and aggressive 
approach that combines the three phases of therapy as proposed in this clinical trial. Whether

Approval date: 30 -Jan-2019   
 
 
 
patients with MIDD and AL amyloidosis will be able to tolerate such an aggressive and protracted 
approach, and whether the toxicity of HD M/ASCT combined with pre and post transplant 
administration of BD will be prohibitive or deleterio us to these patients will be evaluated on this pi[INVESTIGATOR_11480]. 
 
Regarding MIDD, although our experience with HD M/ASCT appears encouraging , there has been 
no prospective study addressing the use of this treatment modali ty in MIDD. All the data available on 
the subject, including the MSKCC experience, stems from retrospective analyses that have 
obviously numerous shortcomings. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_678303], treatments administered have been widely variable in terms of initial therapy 
(treatment received before the ASCT) as well as conditioning regimens prior to transplantation. 
Regarding the response to treatment in MIDD, the correlation between hematologic response and 
renal response is poorly characterized, often not even reported in the literature, and much remains 
to be unde rstood in that regard. This clinical trial represents the first prospective therapeu tic clinical 
trial in MIDD examining the outcome of these patients using a comprehen sive treatment that is very 
effective in multiple myeloma. 
 
In the event this comprehen sive treatment strategy is safe and there is a signal of activity, we plan to 
complete a larger phase II trial which will be most feasible in a coope rative group setting. 
 
4.0 OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN/INTERVENTION 
4.1 Design 
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_678304]/tolerability of 1-3 cycles of BD, 
followed by [CONTACT_121270] M/ASCT, and maintenan ce therapy with BD in patients with MIDD associated with 
multiple myeloma and AL amyloidosis. A total of 20 patientswill be accrued to the study.  We will 
estimate the hematologic response rates as well as organ response rates at the completion of 
therapy and at 24 months. 
4.2 Intervention 
The treatment has three phases: 
1) Initial treatment phase: This phase consists of 1-3 21-day-cycles of a combination regimen that 
includes bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2, IV or SQ, on days 1, 4, 8, and 11; and dexamethasone [ADDRESS_917929] response criteria well 
established for multiple myeloma. These criteria are based on evaluation of serum and urine M- 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_678305].  Patients who show evidence of progression of disease (POD) with confirmation at any 
time during this phase of treatment will be taken off study and will be treated at the discretion of their 
treating physician. All other patients will continue to receive treatment as per protocol and will 
proceed with the second phase of treatment after 3 cycles. Patients who achieve CR before 
completion of 3 cycles may forego the remaining cycle(s) and proceed to phase 2 of treatment 
(HDM/ASCT). A bone marrow biopsy will be performed at the completion of the first phase of 
treatment to characterize the response to induction BD. 
 
2) Stem cell mobilization and HD M/ASCT: Patients will have peripheral blood stem cells mobilized 
and collected as per MSKCC‘s institutional guidelines.  All patients will undergo risk-adapted 
conventional autologous stem cell transplantation with melphal an 100, 140, or 200 mg/m2 
(dependin g on risk. See section 9.0) given in a single dose on day -2 or divided doses given on days

-3 and -2, prior to stem cell reinfusion on day 0. These procedures will be performed as per 
MSKCC‘s institutional guidelines.. 
Toxicity will be assessed during transplant and hematologic and organ responses to HD M/ASCT will 
be assessed at 12 weeks +/- [ADDRESS_917930] 
phase of treatment. 
 
3) Post-ASCT consolida tion/maintenan ce treatment phase: This phase consists of six cycles of 
bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2, IV or SQ with dexamethasone 20 mg PO  or IV administered on days 1, 8, 
15, and 22 every 12 weeks +/- 2 weeks. Although bortezomib has not been established as 
maintenan ce therapy in multiple myeloma (clinical trials currently in progress), the concept of 
maintenan ce therapy after HD M/ASCT has now been shown to increase the CR rate, PFS, and in 
few studies, OS in patients with multiple myeloma using lenalidomide or thalidomide. 
Toxicity and hematologic response will be assessed at the initiation of every cycle based on CTCAE 
4.[ADDRESS_917931] hematologic response 
criteria in multiple myeloma (including a bone marrow biopsy to confirm CR) at 12 months and at 24 
months (+/- 2 weeks) following treatment initiation.  We anticipate that in many patients, end of 
therapy will correspond to the [ADDRESS_917932]-treatment evaluation. 
 
 
At the completion of treatment, patients will be seen in the clinic every three months until disease 
progression with no further intervention. 
4.3  Outcome measurement 
 
The primary objective of this clinical trial is toxicity/tolerability and we will use CTCAE 4.[ADDRESS_917933] not been as well defined and are discussed in section 12.0.

BORTEZOMIB ( Velcade®) for Injection is a small-molecule proteasome inhibi tor developed by 
[CONTACT_24312], Inc., (Millenniu m) as a novel agent to treat human malign ancies. 
BORTEZOMIB is currently approved by [CONTACT_6581] (US 
FDA) for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma (MM).  It is also indicated for the 
treatment of patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least 1 prior

Institute (NC I) in vitro and in vivo assays.(See ref Appendix 20.5 i)  In addition, BORTEZOMIB 
has cytotoxic activity in a variety of xenog raft tumor models, both as a single agen t and in 
combination with chemotherapy and radiation.(See ref Append ix 20.5 ii,iii,iv ,v ,v i,v ii,v iii,ix,x,xi,xii,xiii,xiv ) 
Notably, BORTEZOMIB induces apop tosis in cells that over express bcl-2, a gene tic trait that 
confers unregula ted growth and resistance to conventional chemotherapeutics. (See ref Append ix 
20.5 xv ) 
The mechanisms of action leadin g up to apop tosis have been more clearly defined and include 
initiation of the unfolded protein response and direct/indirect effects on various molecular targets 
includin g cell cycle control proteins p27 and p21, cyclins, signal transduction molecules, transcription 
factors c-jun and HIF1-
, tumor suppressor protein p53, angiog enesis factors, and many others. 
BORTEZOMIB is thought to be efficacious in multiple myeloma via its inhibition of nuclear factor B 
(NF-B) activation, its attenua tion of interleukin-6 (IL-6)-mediated cell growth, a direct apoptotic 
effect, and possibly anti-angiog enic and other effects. (See ref Appendix 20.5 xv i,xv ii,xv iii,xix,xx,xxi,xxii,xxiii) 
5.1.2  Non-clinical Pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic studies were condu cted in the rat and cynomolgus 
monkey.  Upon intravenous (IV) bolus administration, bortezomib displays a rapid distribution phase 
(t½ <10 minutes) followed by a longe r elimination phase (t½  5–15 hours).  Bortezomib has a large 
volume of distribution (range 5–50 L/kg).  The plasma PK profile is well described by a 
2-compartment model. 
The pharmacodynamic action of bortezomib is well established and can be measured through an ex 
vivo assay (20S proteasome activity)67.  This assay was used to determine the duration of drug 
effect in lieu of the PK data in the early preclinical toxicology studies as well as to set a guide for 
dose escalation in humans.  Following dosing with bortezomib in the rat and cynomolgus monkey, 
proteasome inhibi tion in peripheral blood had a half-life less than 24 hours, with proteasome activity 
returning to pretreatment baseline within 24 hours in monkey and within 48 to 72 hours in rat after a 
single dose of bortezomib.  Further, intermittent but high inhibition (>70%) of proteasome activity 
was better tolerated than sustained inhibition.  Thus, a twice-weekly clinical dosing regimen was 
chosen in order to allow return of proteasome activity towards baseline between dose 
administrations. 
5.1.3  Non-clinical Toxicity 
Single-dose IV toxicity studies were condu cted with bortezomib in the mouse, rat, dog, and monkey 
to establish the single-dose maximum tolerated dose (MTD).  The MTDs were 0.25 mg/kg (1.5 
mg/m2) and 0.067 mg/kg (0.8 mg/m2) in the [ADDRESS_917935] sensitive species, rat and monkey, respectively. 
Repea t-dose multi-cycle toxicity studies of 3 and 6 months in the rat and 9 months in the monkey, 
each with 8-week recovery periods, were condu cted to characterize the chronic toxic ity of 
bortezomib when administered by [CONTACT_91820].  The MTD in the 
6-month rat study was 0.10 mg/kg (0.6 mg/m2) and the key target organs were the gastrointestinal

(GI) tract, hematopoietic and lymphoid systems.  The MTD in the 9-month monkey study was 0.05 
mg/kg (0.6 mg/m2) and the key target organs were the GI tract, hematopoie tic and lymphoid 
systems, peripheral nervous system, and kidney.  Full or partial reversibility was observed for each 
of the toxicities described to date. 
In general, the nature of the toxicity of bortezomib is similar across species, and target organs of 
toxicity in animals have been largely predictive of human toxicity.  The toxicity of bortezomib in 
animals is characterized by a steep dose-response with mortality seen at dosages above the MTD. 
The cause of death at acutely lethal dosages is considered to be related to indirect cardiovascular 
(CV) effects of hypotension and vascular change s with seconda ry bradycardia and the cause of 
death in long-term studies has been attributed to GI or hematologic toxicity.  The pharmacologic 
effects of bortezomib on the CV system have been extensively characterized and have 
demonstrated that indirect effects on CV function occur only at acutely lethal dosages and are 
abrogated by [CONTACT_678340]. 
Additional detailed information regarding the nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology of bortezomib 
may be found in the Investigator‘s Brochure 
5.1.4  Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Phar macodynamics 
The clinical pharmacology characterization of bortezomib has been determined from phase 1 studies 
in subjects with solid tumors and hematological malignan cies, and confirmed in phase 2 studies in 
subjects with multiple myeloma. 
Bortezomib demonstrates multi-compartmental pharmacokinetics. Following intravenou s 
administration of 1.0 mg/m2  and 1.3 mg/m2  dose, the mean first-dose maximum observed plasma 
concentrations of bortezomib were 57 and 112 ng/mL, respectively in 11 patients with multiple 
myeloma and creatinine clearance values >50 mL/min participating in a pharmacokinetics study.  In 
subsequen t doses, mean maximum observed plasma concentrations range d from 67 to 106 ng/mL 
for the 1.0 mg/m2  dose and 89 to 120 ng/mL for the 1.3 mg/m2  dose.  The mean elimination half-life 
of bortezomib upon multiple dosing range d from [ADDRESS_917936] dose.  Mean Total Body Clearances were 102 and 112 L/h following the 
first dose for doses of 1.0 mg/m2  and 1.3 mg/m2, respectively, and ranged from 15 to 32 L/h 
following subsequen t doses for doses of 1.0 and 1.3 mg/m2, respectively.  Clinical experience has 
shown that the chang e in clearance does not result in overt toxicity from accumulation in this 
multidose regimen in humans. 
In subjects with advanced malign ancies, the maximum pharmacodynamic effect (inhibi tion of 20S 
activity) occurred within 1-hour post dose.  At the therapeu tic dose of 1.3 mg/m [ADDRESS_917937] dose was approximately 61%. 
The time course of proteasome inhibi tion in subjects is characterized by [CONTACT_678341], followed by [CONTACT_678342] 6 to 24 hours to within 50% of the pretreatment activity.  On the Day 1, 4, 8, and 11 
schedule , variable (10%–30%) levels of proteasome inhibi tion have been observed at next 
schedule d dosing.  In theory, this advantage allows cells to recover proteasome activity for normal 
cellula r housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_91780]. 
The relationship between bortezomib plasma concentrations and proteasome inhibi tion can be 
described by a maximum effect (Emax) model.  The Emax  curve is initially very steep, with small 
change s in plasma bortezomib concentration over the range of 0.5 to 2.0 ng/mL relating to large 
increases in the percent inhibi tion (0–60%).  After that, a plateau occurs where marginal increases of 
proteasome inhibi tion are observed in spi[INVESTIGATOR_678306] s in plasma bortezomib concentrations.

BORTEZOMIB, includin g patients treated through Millennium-sponsored clinical trials, Investigator- 
Initiated Studies, the US NC I Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), and with commercially 
available drug.  BORTEZOMIB has been commercially available since 13 May 2003 . 
 
The overall goal of the Millennium phase 1 program was to determine the MTD and dose-limiting 
toxicity (DLT) of BORTEZOMIB in a number of therapeutic settings involving subjects with various 
advanced malignan cies.  In a phase 1 trial in patients with refractory hematologic malignan cies, the 
MTD for a twice weekly dosing for 4 weeks of a 42-day cycle was 1.04 mg/m2/dose, with DLTs of 
thrombocytopenia , hyponatremia, hypokalemia, fatigue, and malaise. (See ref Appendix 20.5 xxiv ) 
The toxicity was greatest during the third and fourth weeks of therapy.  In the 3-week schedul e of 
BORTEZOMIB monotherapy (4 doses, given on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day treatment cycle), 
the DLT occurred at 1.56 mg/m2/dose (3 subjects with Grade 3 diarrhea and 1 with peripheral 
sensory neuropathy).  Therefore, the MTD at this schedul e was 1.3 mg/m 2/dose.  In a 35-day 
treatment cycle with 4 weekly doses of BORTEZOMIB monotherapy, the MTD was 1.6 mg/m2/dose 
and DLT included hypotension, tachycardia, diarrhea, and syncope. 
 
In phase 1 clinical studies, antitumor activity was reported in subjects with Non-Hodgkin‘s 
Lymphoma (NHL), MM, Walden ström‘s Macroglobuline mia, squamous cell carcinoma of the 
nasopha rynx, bronchoalveolar carcinoma of the lung, renal cell carcinoma, and prostate cancer. 
(See ref Appendix 20.5 xxv ,xxv i,xxv ii,xxv iii) 
 
The safety and efficacy of BORTEZOMIB in subjects with MM were investigated in two phase 2 
clinical studies, studies M3410 0-024 (subjects with first relapse) (See ref Appen dix 20.5 xxix) and 
M34100-025 (subjects with second or greater relapse and refractory to their last prior therapy). (See 
ref Appendix 20.5xxx)  In M3410 0-025, [ADDRESS_917939] 2 previous treatments received BORTEZOMIB, 1.3 mg/m2  on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day 
treatment cycle.  The European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplant (EBMT) response criteria, 
as described by [CONTACT_149617] (See ref Appen dix 20.5 xxxi) were utilized to determine disease response. 
Complete responses (CRs) were observed in 4% of subjects, with an additional 6% of patients 
meeting all criteria for CR but having a positive immunofixation test.  Partial response (PR) or better 
was observed in 27% of subjects, and the overall response rate (CR, PR, and minor response [MR] 
combined ) was 35%.  Seventy percent of subjects experienced stable disease or better. 
 
The phase 3 study (M34101-039) (See ref Appendix 20.5 xxxii), also referred to as the APEX study, 
was designed to determine whether BORTEZOMIB provided benefit (time to progression [TTP], 
response rate, and survival) to patients with relapsed or refractory MM relative to treatment with 
high-dose dexamethasone.  The study was also designed to determine the safety and tolerability of 
BORTEZOMIB relative to high-dose dexamethasone, and whether treatment with BORTEZOMIB 
was associated with superior clinical bene fit and quality of life relative to high-dose dexamethasone. 
A total of 669 patients were enrolled and 663 patients received study drug (BORTEZOMIB:  331; 
dexamethasone:  332).  Patients rando mized to BORTEZOMIB received 1.3 mg/m2  IV push twice 
weekly on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 3-week cycle for up to 8 treatment cycles as induction therapy, 
followed by 1.3-mg/m2  BORTEZOMIB weekly on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 5-week cycle for 3 
cycles as maintenan ce therapy.  Patients rando mized to dexamethasone received oral 
dexamethasone 40 mg once daily on Days 1 to 4, 9 to 12, and 17 to 20 of a 5-week cycle for up to 
4 treatment cycles as induction therapy, followed by [CONTACT_149618] 40 mg once daily on Days 1 to 
4 of a 4-week cycle for 5 cycles as maintenan ce therapy.  The EBMT response criteria were utilized 
to determine disease response.  There was a 78% increase in TTP for the BORTEZOMIB arm. 
Median TTP was 6.2 months for the BORTEZOMIB arm and 3.5 months for the dexamethasone arm 
(p < 0.0001 ).  CR + PR was 38% with BORTEZOMIB versus 18% with dexamethasone (p  0.0001).

CR was 6% with BORTEZOMIB versus  1% with dexamethasone (p < 0.0001 ).  The CR + nCR 
(near CR) rate was 13% with BORTEZOMIB versus 2% with dexamethasone.  In patients who had 
received only 1 prior line of treatment (BORTEZOMIB:  132; dexamethasone:  119), CR + PR was 
45% with BORTEZOMIB vs 26% with dexamethasone (p = 0.0035 ).  With a median 8.3 months of 
follow-up, overall survival was significantly longe r (p = 0.0013) for patients on the BORTEZOMIB 
arm versus patients on the dexamethasone arm.  The probab ility of survival at 1 year was 80% for 
the BORTEZOMIB arm versus 66% for the dexamethasone arm, which represented a 41% 
decreased relative risk of death in the first year with BORTEZO MIB (p = 0.0005 ).  In patients who 
had received only 1 prior line of treatment, the probability of survival at 1 year was 89% for the 
BORTEZOMIB arm versus 72% for the dexamethasone arm, which represented a 61% decreased 
relative risk of death in the first year with BORTEZOMIB (p = 0.0098).  Updated response rates and 
survival data were reported for M3410 1-039. (See ref Appendix 20.5 xxxiii)  The upda ted CR + PR 
rate was 43% with BORTEZOMIB.  The CR + nCR rate was 16% with BORTEZOMIB.  With a 
median 22 months of follow-up, overall survival was significantly longe r for patients on the 
BORTEZOMIB arm versus patients on the dexamethasone arm.  The median overall survival was 
29.8 months (95% CI:  23.2, not estimable) for the BORTEZOMIB arm vs 23.7 months (95% CI: 
18.7, 29.1) for the dexamethasone arm (hazard ratio = 0.77, p = 0.0272 ).  The probability of survival 
at 1 year was 80% for the BORTEZO MIB arm versus 67% for the dexamethasone arm (p = 0.0002 ). 
 
The safety and efficacy of BORTEZOMIB in relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) 
were investigated in an international, phase 2, multicenter study M34103-053, also referred to as the 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_91782]. (See ref Appendix 20.5 xxxiv ) The single-arm study was designed to evaluate the 
response rates, duration of response (DOR), TTP, overall survival (OS), and safety of 
BORTEZOMIB treatment in patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma.  For 141 
evaluable patients, the response rate was 31% (8% CR/unconfirmed CR [Cru]).  Median time to 
response was 40 days (range 31-204 days).  The median number of cycles administered across all 
patients was 4; in respondin g patients, the median number of cycles was 8. The median DOR by 
[CONTACT_91825] 9.2 months and 13.5 months in patients with CR/CRu.  Median TTP for both groups 
was 6.[ADDRESS_917940] commonly reported adverse events (AEs) were fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, and 
gastrointestinal events.  A time-to-event update to the PI[INVESTIGATOR_91782] (See ref Append ix 20.5 xxxv ) 
was reported after a median follow-up of 26.4 months.  TTP was 6.7 months for all patients, 12.4 
months in all responde rs.  The median DOR was 9.2 months in all responde rs and had not been 
reached in patients achieving CR/Cru.  Overall survival was 23.5 months in all patients and 36 
months in patients with CR/Cru.  Survival at 12 months was 69% overall and 91% in respond ing 
patients. 
 
The phase 3 study (MMY 3002) known as the VISTA study, evaluated the safety and efficacy of the 
combination of BORTEZOMIB, melphalan, and prednisone in previously untreated multiple myeloma 
patients who were not candida tes for stem cell transplant. (See ref Appendix 20.5 xxxv i)  The study 
was designed to determine the ben efit of addin g BORTEZOMIB to MP (melphal an and prednisone) 
as assessed by [CONTACT_91826].  Patients (682) were rando mized to receive nine 6-week cycles of melphala n 
9mg/m2  and prednisone 60 mg/m2  on Days 1 to 4, alone or in combination with BORTEZO MIB 1.3 
mg/m2  by [CONTACT_91827] 1, 4, 8, 11, 22, 25, 29, and 32 during Cycles 1 to 4, and on Days 1, 8, 
22, and 29 during Cycles 5 to 9. Response was evaluated every 3 weeks using the EBMT criteria. 
At a preplann ed interim analysis, the independen t data monitoring committee recommende d that the 
study be stoppe d since the prespecified statistical bounda ry end point of TTP had been crossed. 
Response rates were 30% with 4% CR.  The rates of partial response or better were 71% in the 
BORTEZOMIB (VMP) group compared to 34% in the MP group (p = 0.001).  With follow-up of 16.3 
months, the TTP for the VMP group was 24 months compared to 16.6 months in the MP group (p = 
0.000001 ) and was associated with a 52% reduced time to progression.  The median DOR was 19.9 
months in the VMP group and 13.1 months in the MP group.  Overall survival had not been reached 
in either group.  Hematologic toxicity was similar in both groups.  The incidence of peripheral

sensory neuropathy and gastrointestinal symptoms was highe r in the VMP group.  The incidence of 
herpes zoster was 3% in patients in the VMP group who received antiviral prophylaxis.  Fifteen 
percent of patients in the VMP group discontinued therapy due to AEs compared to 14% in the MP 
group. 
The VISTA study update after extended follow-up of 25.9 months, (See ref Appendix 20.5 xxxv ii) 
confirmed a survival bene fit for the VMP group.  Overall survival was not reached in either group: 
VMP group (75) deaths, 3 year OS 72%; MP group (111) deaths, 3 year OS 59% (p = 0.0032 ). 
Patients on VMP were less likely to start second-line therapy (VMP 38% vs MP 57% at the time of 
data cut-off) with a longer time to next therapy (TNT) and treatment free interval (TFI).  Of the MP 
patients who received subsequen t therapy, 43% went on to receive BORTEZOMIB. 
 
Based on investigator-reported best responses to subsequen t therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], patients relapsing after 
therapy with a novel agen t were not intrinsically more resistant than after receiving a traditional 
agen t. 
 
In the VISTA study, VMP was associated with prolong ed TTP, TNT, TFI, and OS.  Patients were 
successfully treated with subsequen t IMiD-based therapy and retreated with BORTEZOMIB.  After 
36.7 months follow-up, OS continued to be superior for VMP.  The OS for VMP had not yet been 
reached compared to MP (43.1 months). (See ref Appen dix 20.5 xxxv iii)

Other medical events of interest that are considered not causally related to BORTEZOMIB 
include hepa tic failure and QT prolonga tion.  Fatal outcomes have been reported. 
Women of childbea ring potential should avoid becoming pregnan t while being treated with 
BORTEZOMIB.  Genotoxicity testing has shown that BORTEZOMIB is nega tive in the in vitro 
Ames assay and in the in vivo micronucleus assay, but it is a clastogen in the in vitro 
chromosomal aberration assay. 
Additional details on the potential risks of BORTEZOMIB may be found in the current Investigator‘s 
Brochure. 
5.1.7 Preparation, Handlin g, Storage, and Return of Bortezomib 
 
 
Bortezomib will be suppli ed by [CONTACT_678345], Inc. for this study. 
 
Vials containing lyophilized BORTEZOMIB (Velcade®) for Injection should be stored according to 
the label requirements.  For the [LOCATION_002], store at USP Controlled Room Temperature which 
is 25ºC (77ºF); for Europe, do not store above 30ºC (86ºF); excursions permitted from 15 to 30ºC 
(59-86ºF).  To date, stability data indicate that the lyophilized drug product is stable for at least [ADDRESS_917944] be kept of all disposed materials. 
 
Drug is availabl e in sterile, single-use vials containing 3.5 mg of BORTEZOMIB.  Each vial of 
BORTEZOMIB should be reconstituted under a laminar flow biological cabine t (hood ) within 8 
hours before dosing with 3.5 mL of normal (0.9%) saline , Sodium Chloride Injection USP, so that 
the reconstituted solution contains BORTEZOMIB at a concentration of 1 mg/mL.  Prior to 
reconstitution the vials should remain in the cartons to protect them from light.  Dissolution is 
completed in approximately 10 seconds.  The reconstituted solution is clear and colorless, with a

final pH of 5 to 6. Reconstituted BORTEZOMIB should be administered promptly and in no case 
more than 8 hours after reconstitution. 
 
BORTEZOMIB ( Velcade®) for Injection is a sterile lyophilized powder for reconstitution and is 
supplie d in vials containing BORTEZOMIB and mannitol at a 1:10 ratio.  For example, vials 
containing 3.5 mg of BORTEZOMIB contain 35 mg of mannitol. 
 
Administration 
Drug will be administered only to eligible patients unde r the supervision of the investigator or 
identified sub-investigator(s).  Patients may be treated on an outpatient basis, if possible. 
The drug will be prepared unde r the supervision of a pharmacist, or appropriately qualified and 
trained personnel .  The amount (in mg) of drug to be administered will be determined bas ed on 
body surface area.  Body surface area is to be calculated based on body weight using a standa rd 
nomogram or calculation.  The dose should be calculated on Day 1 of each cycle; the dose 
administered should remain the same throughou t each cycle but should be recalculated at the 
start of the next cycle.  If a patient experiences a notable chang e in weight within a cycle, as 
determined by [CONTACT_678346] d weight assessment, then the patient‘s dose should be 
recalculated at that time based on clinical judgment. 
 
The appropriate amount of bortezomib will be drawn from the injection vial and administered as 
an IV push over [ADDRESS_917945] MedComm Solutions 
(see the following contact [CONTACT_31307]) and report the event.  Whene ver possible, the 
associated product should be maintained in accordance with the label instructions pendi ng further 
guidan ce from a Millennium quality representative.

9.0  TREATMENT/INTERVENTION PLAN 
9.1      Treatment Plan 
There are three treatment phases to this protocol. 
9.1.1    Initial treatment phase: During this phase, the patients will receive treatment as 
outpatients and will be followed in the clinic on a regula r basis as shown in the schedul e 
below. The patients will receive one to three 21-day-cycles consisting of the following 
combination: 
 
 
 
33 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center  
IRB Number: 11 -061 A(11) 
Approval date: 30 -Jan-2019   
 
 
 
Bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2IV or SQ on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 as a bolus injection 
Dexamethasone 40 mg IV or PO on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 
Drugs will be administered only to eligible patients unde r the supervision of the investigator 
or identified sub-investigator(s).  Patients will be treated on an out-patient basis. The 
pharmacist will prepare the drugs unde r aseptic conditions.  The amount (in mg) of drug to 
be administered will be determined based on body surface area.  Body surface area is to be 
calculated based on adjusted body weight (ABW ) using standa rd MSKCC nomogram. The 
dose should be calculated on Day 1 of each cycle; the dose administered should remain the 
same throughou t each cycle but should be recalculated at the start of the next cycle. 
The appropriate amount of bortezomib will be drawn from the injection vial and administered 
as an intravenous (IV) push over [ADDRESS_917959] 
saline flush or through a running IV line. Vials are for single use administration. 
Prophylaxis therapy will be initiated at the start of treatment to prevent treatment-related 
toxicity and will include the following: B-complex vitamin supple ment PO containing at least 
50 mg of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) daily; Prilosec 20 mg daily or equivalent; Bactrim DS, 1 
tablet PO, daily, three days a week; Diflucan 100 mg PO, daily, and Acyclovir 400 mg PO, 
twice a day. Doses will be adjusted for renal function. 
Toxicity and response will be assessed after every cycle of treatment, before the next cycle 
and at the completion of the 3 cycles as shown on the schedul e below, section 10.1. 
Patients who achieve CR before completion of 3 cycles may forego the remaining cycle(s) 
and proceed to phase 2 of treatment. If at any point in time during this phase of treatment a 
patient shows evidence of progression of multiple myeloma with confirmation, (s)he will be 
taken off study. All other patients will proceed with the second phase of treatment. Dose 
adjustments and modifications will be made as shown in the section below entitled ―dose 
adjustments and modifications‖. 
 
9.1.2  HDM/ASCT phase: After 3 cycles of BD, patients without progression of disease 
(POD) will proceed with stem cell mobilization and collection as per institutional guidelines.  . 
A leukaphe resis catheter will be placed during that admission if deemed necessary for stem 
cell collection. Leukapheresis will begin as per the SOP of the Blood Donor Room stem cell 
collection process. Once stem cell collection begin s, a target of 10 x 106 CD34+ cells per kg 
will be sough t, allowing the collection of adequa te stem cells for up to three stem cell 
transplants in a patient's lifetime. We will seek a minimal acceptable collection of 2-4 x 106 
CD34+ cells per kg, allowing one to two ASCT procedures with the minimum acceptable 
dose of 2 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg, per SCT. Patients failing to collect the minimum dose may be 
mobilized a second time as per MSKCC guideline s. Patients who are mobilized twice and 
have less than 2 million stem cells (CD34+ cells) collected per kg, will be removed from 
study. The likelihood of this happeni ng is less than 2%. Blood stem cells will be 
cryopreserved according to standa rd operating procedures of the Cytotherapy Laboratory. 
For HD M/ASCT, patients will be admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. High-dose melpha lan will be 
administered in a single day -2, or split on two consecutive days on days -3 and -2 through a 
central venou s catheter. Melphalan will be administered at a risk adapted dose of 100, 140 or 
200 mg/m2  using adjusted ideal body weight (AIBW) and based on risk group and age as 
follows:

Approval date: 30 -Jan-2019   
 
 
 
o  For patients with no evidence of cardiac involvement and creatinine clearance > 
51ml/min, the dose of IV melphalan will be 200 mg/m2  if the patient is < 60 years old, 
140 mg/m2  if 61 to 70, and 100 mg/m2  if > 71. 
  
o  For patients with early cardiac amyloid and/or creatinine clearance < 51ml/min, the 
dose of IV melphalan will be 140 mg/m2  with stem cell suppo rt if the patient is < 60, 
and 100mg/m2  if >  61. 
Stem cells will be infused on day 0. Patients will receive standa rd suppo rtive care measures 
during the HD M/ASCT period as per MSKCC‘s institutional guidelines 73-75. After discharge, 
patients will be followed initially weekly, then biweekly, then monthly, depe nding on the 
clinical condition of the patient and as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_1963]. 
The patients‘ response to the HD M/ASCT will be assessed at 12 weeks +/- 2 weeks after 
HDM/ASCT as shown on the schedul e below. This assessment will include serum, urine and 
bone marrow testing. Patients without POD will proceed with the third phase of treatment. If 
at any time  post transplant a patient shows evidence of POD with confirmation, (s)he will be 
taken off study. 
 
9.1.3  Consolidation/maintenance  phase: During this phase, the patients will receive 
treatment as outpatients and will be followed in the clinic on a regular basis as shown in the 
schedul e below. The patients will receive six cycles , each given once every 12 weeks +/- 2 
weeks and each consisting of the following combination: 
Bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2, IV or SQ, on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 
Dexamethasone 20 mg IV or PO, on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 
The patients‘ response will be assessed with serum and urine testing after every cycle, , and 
at the completion of the 6 cycles of treatment as shown on the schedul e below. If at any point 
in time during this phase of treatment a patient shows evidence of POD with confirmation or 
unacceptable toxicity to treatment, (s)he will be taken off study. All other patients will 
complete the full 6 cycles. The patient‘s toxicity will be assessed at every encounter and 
before initiation of every cycle as shown on the schedul e below. Dose adjustments and 
modifications will be made as shown in the section below entitled ―dose adjustments and 
modifications‖. 
Prophylaxis therapy will be initiated at the start of this phase of the treatment and will include

Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center  
IRB Number: 11 -061 A(11) 
Approval date: [ADDRESS_917962] occurred due to previous doses. Toxicities 
will be assessed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminolog y Criteria for 
Adverse  Events (NCI CTCAE), version 4.0. Cycle delays and dose modifications will be 
made based on the toxicity experienced during the previous cycle of therapy or the ones 
encountered on any of the treatment days. Doses of study drug that need to be held WITHIN 
a cycle are skipped and will not be made up later in the cycle. 
 
9.2.[ADDRESS_917963] day of each cycle: 
–  Platelet count ≥50 x
109/L 
–  Hemoglobi n ≥8 g/dL ; prior red blood cell (RBC) transfusion or recombinan t human 
erythropoie tin use is allowed 
–  ANC ≥1.0 x
109 /L 
–  Non-hematologic toxicity must have recovered to Grade 1 or baseline 
If the above parameters are not met, the start of the next cycle will be held for a week for 
recovery to the specified levels. The start of the new cycle can be delayed on a weekly basis 
(for a maximum of 3 weeks) until recovery from toxicity to a level allowing continuation of 
therapy. Delay of a new cycle for more than [ADDRESS_917964] procedures performed as outlined for the End of Treatment phase 
assessment. 
 
9.2.2  Dose Modifications 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Reduction Steps 
Dose escalation will not be allowed in any patient, and there must be at least [ADDRESS_917965] 
occurred after the previous dose(s). Toxicities are to be assessed according to the NC I 
CTCAE, version 4.0. All previously established or new toxicities observed any time, with the 
exception of neuropathic pain and peripheral sensory neuropathy, are to be manage d as 
shown below. 
Dose reductions steps represented in the following tables for bortezomib and 
dexamethasone. Patients who have an unacceptable toxicity after 2 dose reductions due to 
any of the study drugs will discontinue that study drug. 
If the patient experiences febrile neutropenia, a grade 4 hematologic toxicity (including a 
platelet count < 25 x 109/L) or any ≥ grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity considered by [CONTACT_678352], then drug needs to be held. 
If the bortezomib dose is reduced during the initial treatment phase, the starting dose of 
bortezomib during the Maintenance Treatment Phase should be similarly reduced as well. 
For example, if the bortezomib dose is reduced from 1.3 mg/m 2 to 1.0 mg/m2  in the initial 
phase of treatment, the starting dose in the maintenance phase should also be reduced from 
1.3 mg/m2  to 1.0 mg/m2.

[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Modifications for Bortezomib-Related Neuropathy 
The neurotoxicity-directed questionnaire (see appendix 20.1) is a useful tool for determining 
the presence and intensity of neuropathic pain and/or peripheral neuropathy from the 
patient‘s perspective.  Neuropathic symptoms are more prominent than abnormalities on the 
clinical examination.  After the patient completes the neurotoxicity-directed questionnai re, the 
questionnai re should be reviewed to assist with the evaluation of the onset and intensity of 
peripheral neuropathy and other neuro-toxicities that may possibly require intervention or 
dose modification. The table below contains the recommende d dose modification for the 
manage ment of subjects who experience BORTEZOMIB-related neuropathic pain and/or 
peripheral neuropathy.

Hold:  Interrupt BORTEZOMIB for up to 3 weeks until the toxicity returns to Grade 1 or better. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Modifications for Other Non-hematologi c Toxicity 
If a patient experiences any Grade 3 or 4 non- hematologic toxicity (excluding neuropathy as 
discussed above) considered by [CONTACT_7185](s), then the 
treatment regimen will be held until the intensity of the side effect decreases to Grade 1 or 
baseline. After recovery from toxicity to a level allowing continuation of therapy, a dose level

reduction should be instituted for bortezomib.  A dose reduction for corticosteroids should 
occur only for Grade 3 or 4 corticosteroid-related toxicities. 
Patients with cardiac toxicity: If during treatment the LVEF falls below normal limits of the 
institution, or the ejection fraction (LVEF) falls by 20% from the baseline level, bortezomib will 
be discontinued . The investigator may verify the LVEF from a MUGA by [CONTACT_678355]. If there is no evidence of cardiac damage determined by [CONTACT_678356]. Treatment with bortezomib should be discontinued in 
subjects who experience new onset symptomatic congestive heart failure, or if they 
experience cardiac dysfunction as indicated by [CONTACT_678357], a decrease in LVEF 
to below the institutional lower limit of normal, or an absolute decrease of 15% or more from 
the subject‘s baseline value (e.g. 60% to 45%). 
Patients with mild hepa tic impairment (bilirubin ≤ 1.[ADDRESS_917969]) do not require a starting dose 
adjustment.  Please note that patients with bilirubin levels > 1.[ADDRESS_917970] are excluded from enrollment in 
this protocol.  If a patient develops moderate or severe hepatic impairment with bilirubin ≥ Grade 2 (> 
1.[ADDRESS_917971]) while on study, the investigator should hold BORTEZOMIB until the toxicity returns 
to < Grade 2. Restarting BORTEZOMIB at the next lower dosed level could be considered at the 
Investigator‘s discretion and following exclusion of BORTEZOMIB-induced liver impairment and 
careful consideration of liver disease due to other causes, such as, but not limited to, active infection 
and multiple myeloma-related liver disease.

11.0 TOXICITIES/SIDE EFFECTS 
For toxicity scoring we will use NC I CTC Version 4.0 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html). 
 
11.[ADDRESS_917974] Common Bortezomib Risks: 
 
The most common risks are those that have occurred in greater than or equa l to 30% of patients 
who have received bortezomib: 
• Feelin g weak, tired, and generally uncomfortable 
• gastrointestinal effects such as constipation, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and loss of appe tite. 
These may result in dehydration and/or weight loss 
• fever commonly with shaking chills 
• painful feelings or numbness and tinglin g in hand s and feet, which may not get better after 
stoppin g bortezomib. Uncommonly, the nerves that control things like your heart rate, gut 
movement and urinary bladde r may be affected 
• lowered platelets;  that may increase the chance of bleeding 
• lowered red cells or anemia which may make you feel tired 
 
Very Common Bortezomib Risks: 
 
The very common risks are those that have occurred in 10-29% of patients who have received 
bortezomib: 
• Neutropenia uncommonly associated with fever; commonly lymphopen ia or anemia, 
leukopenia and thrombocytopeni a at the same time 
• flu-like symptoms and other uppe r respi[INVESTIGATOR_6014], such as chills, sore throat, and 
runny nose and sinus and throat infections 
• abdo minal pain

• Peripheral edema. 
• cough , feeling short of breath, lung infections including pneumonia and commonly bronchitis 
• heada che 
• skin rash with itching and redness.  An uncommon risk is a severe, life-threatening or dead ly 
rash with skin peelin g and mouth sores. 
• Herpes virus infections such as Herpes Zoster) and herpes simplex virus Herpes Zoster can 
sometimes spread over large parts of the body.  Both may also affect the eyes or brain, but 
this is uncommon

• Muscular weakness 
• Weight decreased 
• Muscle spasms 
• Gastrointestinal hemorrhage 
• IleusNeuralgia 
 
Uncommon bortezomib Risks: 
 
Uncommon risks are those that have occurred in less than 1% of patients who have received 
bortezomib: 
• Inflammation, pleural effusions, empyema that may cause breathing problems, and can be 
life-threatening or lead to death. Pulmonary hypertension has also been reported.  This can 
cause breathing problems and can be life-threatening. 
• Pericarditis that may cause chest pain or breathing problems and can be life-threatening or 
lead to death. 
• hepa titis, and liver failure (in patients who also got many drugs and had other serious 
medical problems). 
• pain, redne ss, swelling and infection in the area of the skin where bortezomib is injected into 
the vein 
• pain in the mouth and throat when swallowing 
• loss of hearing 
• intestinal obstruction that may reverse spontaneou sly and inflammation of the intestines, 
pancreas or stomach 
• Hemoptysis

12.0 CRITERIA FOR THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESS MENT 
12.1  Measurement of Safety Outcome 
The primary endpo int of this study is assessment of toxicity/tolerability at the completion of 
the treatment. Toxicities will be assessed according to the National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminolog y Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), version 4.0. All subjects will be 
evaluated for the presence of treatment related toxicity during active treatment at the end of 
each cycle as described above in section 9.1.  Safety measurements also will be evaluated 
by [CONTACT_46636], vital signs assessments, clinical laboratory test results, and 
adverse events. Cycle delays and dose modifications will be made based on the toxicity 
experienced during the previous cycle of therapy or the ones encountered on any of the 
treatment days as described above in section 9.2. All adverse events will be reported as 
described in section 17.[ADDRESS_917977], on the CRF.  A physician (either the Principal Investigat[INVESTIGATOR_1660] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a 
physician designated by [CONTACT_079]) will manag e and treat any treatment- 
emergent toxicity.

levels and ratio 
• Negative serum and urine immunofixation 
• <5% plasma cells in bone marrow 
VERY GOOD PARTIAL RESPONSE 
(VGPR) • Reduction in the dFLC (difference between 
involved [iFLC] and uninvolved FLC) to 
<4mg/dl 
PARTIAL RESPONSE (PR) • > 50% reduction in the dFLC

12.[ADDRESS_917980] been well established by [CONTACT_678359] l 
and  widely  used  in  the  literature.  The  tests  and studies  listed  in  section  10.0  will  be 
performed as shown in the schedule to measure organ response using the criteria detailed 
below. Amyloid-related organ involvement will be scored as improved, stable or worsened at 
the completion of every phase of treatment. 
• Improvement of one or more affected organ(s) is defined by: 
[CONTACT_678360]: a 50% reduction in 24-hour urine protein excretion in the absence of progressive 
renal insufficiency (defined as 25% worsening of creatinine and creatinine clearance) which 
has to be at least 0.5 g/24hr. 
Heart: a reduction of the BNP or NT-pro-BNP by 30% from baseline . 
Liver: a 50% decrease of an initially elevated alkaline phosphatase level or reduction in the 
size of the liver by [CONTACT_2669] 2 cm by [CONTACT_9661] . 
Neuropathy: clinical improvement suppo rted by [CONTACT_100875], neurologic exam, orthostatic 
vital signs, resolution of severe constipation or reduction of diarrhea to less than 50% of 
previous movements/day, and EMG studies if indicated. 
 
 
• Worsening of one or more affected organ(s) is defined by:

increase in urinary protein loss if > 3 g/24 hours, or reduction of creatinine clearance by > 
50%, or increase in serum creatinine of > 2 mg/dL. 
Heart: evidence of decrease in ejection fraction by > 10% or increase of the BNP or NT-pro- 
BNP by > 30% from baseline or increase of Troponi n by 33%. 
Liver: >50% increase in the alkaline phosphatase level above lowest value. 
Neuropathy: clinical worsening suppo rted by [CONTACT_969], worsening orthostatic vital signs and 
symptoms, and EMG studies if indicated. 
 
 
• Stable disease is defined when none of the criteria for improvement or for worsening 
disease are met. 
 
12.2.2  MIDD Organ Response 
It is important to highlight that the renal response criteria (since this is the organ that is by [CONTACT_678361]) for patients with MIDD has not 
been clearly characterized in the literature and much work need s to be done along this line. 
Some authors have borrowed the renal response criteria used for amyloidosis to assess the 
renal response in MIDD. However, we believe that there is a striking difference between 
these two diseases. In amyloido sis, renal injury mostly leads to the neph rotic syndrome and 
marked proteinuria, while renal clearance is preserved until very advanced stages of the 
disease. This is why the renal response is assessed based on the proteinuria in this disease. 
Conversely, in patients with MIDD, the main clinical feature of the disease is the decrease in 
the renal clearance. Protein wasting neph ropathy is a less prominent componen t, usually 
reaching mild to moderate levels, and is highly variable. While 96% of the patients have renal 
insufficiency, only 40% have neph rotic range proteinuria. Furthermore, with worsening of the 
renal injury and renal filtration in MIDD, proteinuria usually decreases and no longer reflects 
the worsening pace of the disease. Overall, in MIDD the degree of proteinuria does not 
necessarily reflect the severity of the disease at presentation, and subsequen t change s in 
proteinuria may be difficult to interpret. On the other hand, the creatinine clearance is a more 
reliabl e parameter that always reflects the renal state in this disease. 
In summary, we belie ve that the amyloid criteria for renal respons e canno t be used for MIDD 
We belie ve that the only valid parameters for response measurement in MIDD are the 
creatinine and the creatinine clearance or GFR. These parameters will be used to measure 
the renal outcome in this clinical trial. 
Renal response in MIDD will be scored as improved, stable or worsened at the completion of 
every phase of treatment.

17.2  Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting 
 
 
Adverse Events Definition 
 
 
An adverse event is any unfavorable or unintended sign, symptom or disease temporally 
associated with the use of medical treatment or procedure regardless of whether it is 
considered related to the medical treatment or procedure.  Adverse events will be captured 
and reported at each protocol visit per the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Adult 
Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) Adverse Event (AE) and Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
Guide. 
 
The following adverse events will be captured and should have corresponding source 
documentation in the medical record: 
-  Labo ratory data, grades 3-4 (automatically captured through CRD B) 
-  Unexpected grades 1-5 
-  Expected grades 2-5 (unless specified in table one of the MSK Adult BMT AE and 
SAE Guide)

17.2.1  Procedures for AE and SAE Reporting: Millennium requirements 
All serious adverse events (SAEs) (regardless of expectedness, causality, and whether 
commercial or investigational BORTEZOMIB is used) must be reported to Millennium 
Pharmacovigilan ce (or designee ).  See below for the reporting of SAEs. 
The sponsor-investigator is responsible to meet all regulations and requirements applicable 
to the sponsor-investigator. 
 
Adverse events (AEs) may be spontaneou sly reported by [CONTACT_5363]/or in response to 
an open question from study personne l or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination, or 
other diagnostic procedures.  AEs which are serious must be reported to Millennium 
Pharmacovigilan ce (or designee ) from first dose of bortezomib up to and including [ADDRESS_917988] dose of bortezomib.  When possible, signs and symptoms 
indicating a common unde rlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event. 
Any SAE that occurs at any time after completion of bortezomib treatment or after the 
designated follow-up period that the investigator and/or sub-investigator considers to be 
related to any study drug must be reported to the Millenniu m Pharmacovigilan ce (or 
designee ).  Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_678316] r during the trial (e.g., surgery was performed 
earlier or later than planned ).  All SAEs should be monitored until they are resolved or are 
clearly determined to be due to a patient‘s stable or chronic condition or intercurrent 
illness(es). 
 
This is an investigator-initiated study.  The principal investigator, [CONTACT_678371] (who may 
also sometimes be referred to as the sponsor-investigator), is condu cting the study and 
acting as the sponsor. Therefore, the legal/ethical obligations of the principal investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_91779] a sponsor and those of an investigator. 
 
Sponsor-investigator must report all SAEs, regardless of expectedness or relationship with 
any study drug, to Millennium Pharmacovigilan ce (or designee ) as soon as possible, but no 
later than 5 calendar days of the sponsor-investigator‘s observation or awareness of the 
event.  In the event that this is a multisite study, the sponsor-investigator is responsible to 
ensure that the SAE reports are sent to Millennium Pharmacovigilan ce (or designee) from all 
sites participating in the study.  Sub-investigators must report all SAEs to the sponsor- 
investigator so that the sponsor-investigator can meet his/her foregoing reporting obligations 
to Millennium Pharmacovigilance, unless otherwise agreed between the sponsor-investigator 
and sub-investigator(s).  Millenniu m Pharmacovigilan ce (or designee ) may request follow -up 
information to a reported SAE, which the sponsor-investigator will be responsible for 
providing to Millennium Pharmacovigilan ce (or designee ).

20.3  Body Surface Area and Creatinine Clearance Calculations 
 
 
Body surface area (BSA) should be calculated using a standa rd nomogram that yields the 
following results in meters squared (m2): 
  
 
BSA = 
 
or 
 
BSA = Ht(inches) Wt(lbs) 
3131 
 
 
Ht(cm) Wt(kg) 
3600 
 
Creatinine clearance (CrCl) can be calculated using the Cockroft-Gault equa tion as follows: 
CrCl (ml/min) = (140 - age) (actual wt in kg) 
72  serum creatinine (mg/dl) 
 
For females, use 85% of calculated CrCl value. 
 
Note:  In markedly obese patients, the Cockroft-Gault formula will tend to overestimate the 
creatinine clearance.  (Adipose tissue tends to contribute little creatinine requiring renal 
clearance.)

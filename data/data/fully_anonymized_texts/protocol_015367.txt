Objectives
Primary Objective
1) Compare  postoperative pain control regimens using an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-sparing analgesia 
approach and a standard opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-containing approach in patients that have 
undergone endonasal, trans-sphenoidal (ENTS) surgery. 
Secondary Objectives
1) Determine  if the institution of an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-sparing analgesia regimen decreases the 
use of rescue narcotics in postoperative patients. 
2) Determine  if the institution of an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-sparing analgesia regimen decreases 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-related adverse events
3) Determine  if the institution of an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-sparing analgesia regimen decreases 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577], pharmacy charges, and overall hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7960]. 
Background
Post-operative pain control  is a common concern patients have when they consider 
undergoing a surgical procedure.  Although effective for treating acute pain, opi[INVESTIGATOR_427057]-dependent adverse effects, including constipation, 
nausea and vomiting, altered mental status, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], all of which have 
been shown to increase patient length of stay (1).  The use of non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_427058] a multi-modal approach is 
efficacious in reducing opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], decreasing the incidence of adverse effects, 
improving patient satisfaction and recovery time, and decreasing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15680] (2,3,5).

managed post-operatively,  making it an ideal procedure for an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-sparing post-
operative pain regimen(4).  Anecdotally, we have noted in our post-operative pi[INVESTIGATOR_427060]-operative pain 
with scheduled non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467], often without requiring breakthrough opi[INVESTIGATOR_6086].  
Another safe and effective non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_427061]-modal pain 
management for moderate pain is IV Caldolor (ibuprofen) (6.7.8).  After literature review, 
we were unable to find a study that had attempted to use an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-sparing analgesic 
regimen for post-operative pain control following ENTS approach for resection of pi[INVESTIGATOR_427062].
Study Design
A randomized, double-blind,  placebo-controlled, intervention trial involving 100 treated 
patients undergoing ENTS resection of pi[INVESTIGATOR_427063].  Patients will be randomized into 
two groups; [ADDRESS_539735]-operative medication arm.

8) Pregnancy
9) Incarcerated  patients
10)  Patients with chronic pain or significant medical disease whereby [CONTACT_427071], in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], impact the patient’s welfare
11) Patients with  a history of TIA (transient ischemic attack) or stroke or 
myocardial infarction or a patient with risks factors for the above (such as 
hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], or smoking) that in the judgment of the 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_427064].
Study enrollment procedures
1) Screening  procedure: The outpatient clinic records of patients scheduled to 
undergo transsphenoidal surgery will be screened to determine if patients meet 
study criteria. 
2) Tracking  procedure: Inpatients will be followed by [CONTACT_427072] [ADDRESS_539736], after surgery.  Patient data will be collected 
with a data collection sheet (Addendum B).
3) Informed  consent procedure: The Investigator or a designee is responsible for 
obtaining informed consent from each patient and for obtaining the appropriate 
signatures and dates prior to the performance of any protocol procedures and 
prior to the randomizing subjects. The informed consent document will be used 
to help explain the risks and benefits in simple terms to the patient (Addendum 
C). 
4) Randomization:  Eligible patients who provide consent will be randomized to 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-sparing or standard pain medication regimen.  
Study Interventions
Pre-operative education  and consent visit
All patients  will attend a pre-operative education, consent, and pre-testing visit one 
or two days prior to the scheduled surgical date.  Prior to this session, the patient’s history 
from initial consult will be reviewed to screen for eligibility for the study; eligible patients 
will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  If consent is obtained, the patient will be randomized to either the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-sparing arm or the standard arm (Addendum A).

Original July  24, 2014; Revised Jan 8, 2015; Nov 20, 2015 4Patients will be  randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_539737] randomized number of 61 would be assigned to the treatment group; a 
second number of [ADDRESS_539738] received treatment.
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-sparing group  
Intravenous Caldolor (800mg  every 8 hours) will be initiated during surgery and 
oral acetaminophen [ADDRESS_539739].  Breakthrough pain will be 
treated with rescue narcotics (intravenous morphine 2-4mg every [ADDRESS_539740]-operatively through discharge).  
Hydromorphone (IV 0.5-2mg every 2 hours and oral 2-4mg every 4 hours) will be used in 
patients with morphine or oxycodone allergy or intolerance. The dosing assignments in the 
study group are based on previous clinical studies of IV Caldolor (6).
Standard treatment group
Intravenous Caldolor PLACEBO  will be initiated during surgery and oral 
acetaminophen [ADDRESS_539741].  Breakthrough pain will be treated with 
rescue narcotics (intravenous morphine 2-4mg every [ADDRESS_539742]-operatively through discharge).  Hydromorphone (IV 0.5-
2mg every 2 hours and oral 2-4mg every 4 hours) will be used in patients with morphine or 
oxycodone allergy or intolerance. 
Primary endpoints:
1) Comparison  of pain scores between groups: Visual Analog Scale for Pain score at 
4hr interval x [ADDRESS_539743], per hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361] 
(Addendum C).

will be recorded and compared using a standard equianalgesic oral morphine 
equivalent (OME) calculation (9).
2) Anti-emetic  requirement: The total number of doses and type of any anti-emetic 
required post-operatively in both groups will be compared.
3) Constipation: The  number of patients that do not have a bowel movement during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_427065]. Both groups will be treated with a 
standard bowel care protocol (Addendum D).
4) Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-related  adverse events: The number of patients with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-associated 
adverse events, such as respi[INVESTIGATOR_427066], will be documented; 
POSS sedation scale will be monitored.
5) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_427067]:  Total hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7960], pharmacy charges, and length of stay 
will be compared. 
6) Other  adverse events: Epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], potentially related to intravenous ibuprofen, will 
be compared.
Unblinding
Unblinding will  occur in the case of adverse or hypersensitivity reaction to the study 
medications for the purposes of treatment and allergy documentation, or when the 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or the Co-investigators feel that blinding is impacting patient 
care or patient safety. 
The codes  for each patient will be stored with the Research Pharmacy and the Clinical 
Research nurse and documented on the study drug form.  
If it  is necessary to break the blind, it will be documented, including reason for breaking the 
code, and the researchers will notify the IRB.
Data Analysis:
Frequencies will  be reported for ordinal and categorical variables. Descriptive analyses 
such as minimum, maximum, mean, median, and standard deviations will be used for 
continuous variables. Demographic variables such as age, gender, and ethnicity will be 
reported. Independent samples t-tests will be used to compare mean VAS scores between 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-sparing and standard groups.

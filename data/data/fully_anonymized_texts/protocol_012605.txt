CONFIDENTIAL  8 2 INTRODUCTION This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted according to U.S. and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 Part 312 and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable government regulations and Institutional research policies and procedures. 2.1 BACKGROUND Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) methods have recently been gaining acceptance and attention as treatment strategies for many neurological and psychiatric disorders as well as improving cognition. The methods include well studied methods such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) as well as novel methods like transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) and cross-frequency transcranial alternating current stimulation (CF-tACS). In particular, CF-tACS has been used to improve working memory capacity (Alekseichuk et al. 2017). CF-tACS was designed to target naturally occurring cross-frequency electrical coupling that is witnessed in a variety of cognitive tasks, such as epi[INVESTIGATOR_533461] (Poeppel et al. 2016), decision-making (Arnal et al. 2015), and attention (Quax et al. 2017). Recent evidence has even suggested that cross-frequency coupling underlies the relief from the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease experience by [CONTACT_533478] (deHemptinne et al. 2015). Cross-frequency coupling of neural oscillations is a relatively novel model of brain activity that has been gaining empi[INVESTIGATOR_533462] (see Canolty & Knight 2010 for review). Oscillations are periodic electrical activity observed both intracranially and transcranially in humans using electrocorticograms (ECoG), electroencephalograms (EEG), magnetoencephalograms (MEG) (Buzsaki, Anastassiou, & Koch, 2012). Oscillations have been demonstrated to modulate neuronal firing, organize communication within and between brain regions and hence coordinate cognition (Fries, 2005; Frohlich & McCormick, 2010; Jensen & Mazaheri, 2010). Oscillations in the frequency bands 4 – 8 Hz and 8 – 12 Hz (often referred to as theta and alpha band) have been shown to be correlated with working memory performance (Jensen, Gelfand, Kounios, & Lisman, 2002; Jensen & Tesche, 2002; Raghavachari et al., 2001) and cognitive control (Cavanagh & Frank, 2014). Thus, changes in cognitive performance could be reflected in changes in oscillations. The current study aims to test for the role of cross-frequency coupling in cognitive processes. We will be collecting a saliva sample at the first session. This sample will be used to test for a single nucleotide polymorphism in the BDNF gene whose presence may have an influence on effectiveness of brain stimulation. Within the central nervous system, BDNF regulates survival, proliferation, and synaptic growth as well as directly influences synaptic plasticity in the adult human brain (Antal et al., 2010). Egan et al. (2003) demonstrated that Val66Met, a single nucleotide in the BDNF gene, has function consequences in healthy humans, including decreased epi[INVESTIGATOR_83996] a reduction in recall capacity. This polymorphism is common in over one third of the Caucasian population (65% Val66Val to 35% Val66MET) (Pezawas et al, 2004; Hariri and Weinberger, 2003). Kleim et al. (2006) found that individuals with the Val/Val polymorphism respond to tDCS and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) treatments with expected change, whereas, individuals expressing Val/MET allele do not. These authors indicate the difference to be caused by [CONTACT_226253]/MET allele. These findings suggest that individual efficacy of treatments using brain stimulation may be partially genetically predetermined and should be taken into account when preforming such procedures. Accordingly, we will conduct genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_533463]. In addition to BDNF, we will be assessing sex hormone levels in our participants before stimulation. Cortical excitability has been shown to depend on the phase of the menstrual cycle in women (Smith et al. 1999, Badawy et 
2PAC  Version 3.0 IRB 180003  9 January 2020 
CONFIDENTIAL  9 al. 2013, Walpurger et al. 2004). This effect may be mediated by [CONTACT_226729] (e.g., estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, androstenedione). To account for the different levels of sex hormones in participants when they arrive for the experimental sessions, we will collect saliva for assessing levels of estradiol, progesterone and testosterone. In addition, we will ask women information on birth control use and the best guess-estimate of first day of last menstrual cycle. 2.2 INVESTIGATIONAL AGENT CF-tACS involves the application of electric current on the scalp in a waveform that emulates the coupling between two frequencies: a higher frequency waveform is nested in the peak of lower frequency waveform (Alekseichuk et al., 2016) and has previously been demonstrated to increase performance during a working memory task. 2.[ADDRESS_692870] included resting-state periods after each block of the task with stimulation to allow for analysis of brain activity (see Alekseichuk et al., 2016 for similar methods). Moreover, our lab has successfully performed many transcranial electrical stimulation experiments where stimulation duration has been 40 minutes (IRB # 14-1622, 16-1911) and no significant side effects have been observed. 2.4 STUDY AIMS/HYPOTHESES The purpose of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_533464]-tACS to modulate cortical oscillations observed during cognitive tasks, to generate hypotheses, and to obtain statistical estimates and other information needed for planning a subsequent larger-scale study. Aim 1. Characterize CF-tACS effects in terms of the outcome measures of interest. Aim 2. Perform exploratory analyses to generate new hypotheses. Aim 3. Obtain preliminary data and population parameter estimates needed to plan a future study.

2PAC  Version 3.[ADDRESS_692872] from Hispanic/Latino population.   Justification for excluding women or women who become pregnant: Pregnant participants will be excluded out of an abundance of caution despi[INVESTIGATOR_61571], since no safety data for pregnancy are known to exist for CF-tACS studies and only limited safety data for other noninvasive brain stimulation methods like TMS (Sayar et al. 2014) . We will verify pregnancy status via a urine pregnancy test for all female participants prior to receiving treatment on Day 1 of Stimulation. At the beginning of Sessions 2, 3 and 4, female participants will be asked if there is a possibility that they might be pregnant since Session 1. If the participants answer 'Yes' or 'Maybe', pregnancy test will be conducted. A pregnancy questionnaire will be used to document the answers. Sayar, G.

Recruitment will occur via two methods: flyers to be distributed at major locations on the campus (libraries, gyms, classroom buildings, etc.) and a mass email to all individuals with a UNC-affiliated email address.  3.3.[ADDRESS_692873] effectiveness data for further refinement of CF-tACS approach and for the subsequent design of a follow-up, multi-site, large scale study. We are seeking 24 healthy participants, both male and female, between the ages of 18-35. All women of child-bearing potential (defined as menstruating women of all ages) will be asked to take a pregnancy test during the initial session in order to determine eligibility for the study. We estimate 2 months to complete study enrollment. The experimental design is a 3-treatment, 3-period, 3-sequence crossover with a 1 week washout interval between periods. N=[ADDRESS_692874] visit. Sham treatment will include 10 seconds of ramp-in to 1 minute of CF-tACS with a ramp-out of 10 seconds for a total of 80 seconds of stimulation. The 80 seconds of stimulation serves to desensitize the scalp beyond which participants are generally not able to tell apart the presence or absence of stimulation. This strategy has been described is previous studies using tACS (Alekseichuk et al. 2017; Mellin et al. 2018). Verum CF-tACS will have a [ADDRESS_692875] 1 week. Total participation will include about 12 hours over the course of four weeks. All time estimates take into consideration breaks and time variance in administration. 4.1 TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT PROCEDURES Participants will be randomized into one of 6 sequences. This is a double-blind study, so neither the participant nor the researcher will know which treatment the participant is receiving, if any. 4.1.1 RANDOMIZATION PROCEDURES Sangtae Ahn will randomize 24 6-digit stimulation codes which will be used by [CONTACT_533479]. These stimulation codes are directly linked to which treatment participants receive (sham CF-tACS, theta-gamma verum CF-tACS, or delta-beta CF-tACS) at each session, and will be used with the NeuroConn stimulator. An unblinded code sheet that matches these stimulation codes to treatment arm will be kept by [CONTACT_533480]. Sangtae Ahn will not be involved in data collection, interaction with participants or data analysis ensuring double-blind. The unblinded code sheet will have the following information: · The initial identifier codes for all potential participants · Stimulation code: 6-digit numerical code for the stimulation session

All data retained will be deidentified. 5.2 STIMULATION SESSIONS Participants will undergo four sessions with the same procedure; the only change will be the stimulation condition. In the initial session, participants will have the procedure explained and reminded of their expectations and rights (informed consent). After obtaining consent, a urine drug test and pregnancy screening will be administered. Sessions 2, 3, and 4 will be the same as session 1, except there will be no CF-tACS stimulation during session 1. 5.4.1 SESSION 1  In the initial session, participants will be explained the procedure and reminded of their expectations and rights (informed consent). After obtaining consent, a urine drug test and pregnancy screening will be administered.  • Preparation - Once a negative pregnancy test and negative drug test are confirmed, , the stimulation electrodes, EEG net, ECG electrodes and respi[INVESTIGATOR_533465].  • Questionnaires - The participant will fill out a series of questionnaires pertaining to self-reported handedness, affect, behavioral traits and sleep quality.  • Saliva collection - Saliva will be collected for BDNF genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_533466].  • Resting state EEG – Participant will be asked to relax with eyes open and EEG will be collected simultaneously  • Practice cognitive tasks - The participant will perform a shortened version of the cognitive tasks as practice from which baseline performance will be assessed. · Following the practice, the participant will receive 40 minutes of either verum CF-tACS or sham CF-tACS stimulation, depending on the randomized condition.

CONFIDENTIAL  16 6 STUDY PROCEDURES/EVALUATIONS 6.[ADDRESS_692880] demographics, which include medical history and medication history. In addition, several other self-report measures will be used throughout this study. These measures are listed below and can be found in the attached documents. A. THE STATE-TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY (STAI) is a 20-item self-report assessment that assesses either temporary or chronic anxiety. For the purposes of this study, the state version will be used to measure anxiety as a result of the stress condition. The STAI is commonly used to assess both types of anxiety, and has applications in both clinical and research settings (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_57601], 1983). B. THE PI[INVESTIGATOR_33511] (PSQI) is a 14-item self-report assessment used to assess an individual’s sleep quality from poor to good. This scale is widely used and has been demonstrated to produce reliable data (Buysse et al, 1989). C. THE BEHAVIORAL INHIBITION AND BEHAVIORAL APPROACH SYSTEM SCALES (BIS/BAS) are a set of 24 questions used to assess an individual’s sensitivity to approach vs. inhibition in motivating behavior. This scale is commonly used to measure behavior and has been demonstrated to be reliable (Carver & White, 1994).  D. THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AFFECT SCHEDULE (PANAS) is a 20-item self-report assessment using a 5-level Likert scale to assess the positive and negative affect of an individual over the past week. This scale has been shown to be a reliable measure of both positive and negative affect with little subjectivity to demographic variables (Watson et al, 1988).  E. THE EDINBURGH HANDEDNESS INVENTORY is a 20-item scale to assess the hand dominance of a person in everyday activities (Oldfield, 1971) F. BECK’S DEPRESSION INVENTORY is a 21-item scale to assess the relative presence of depressive symptoms 6.2 SPECIAL ASSAYS OR PROCEDURES Each participant will receive stimulation on three days, separated by a week. Two session will involve verum CF-tACS, and the other will involve sham tACS; the order of stimulation condition will be randomized for each participant. For more information on the stimulation procedures, see section 8.[ADDRESS_692881].  6.3 SAFETY MEASURES We will be monitoring the safety of our participants throughout the study with the following measures. These measures are listed below and can be found in the attached documents. A. A stimulation adverse effects questionnaire used in previous studies (IRB #14-1622, #14-3285, and #14-0600) will be administered at the end of each stimulation session. This questionnaire will be used as a safety measure and to collect data on participant experience. Please see 10.[ADDRESS_692882]. INSTRUCTIONS FOR SPECIMEN PREPARATION, HANDLING, AND STORAGE. For this evaluation, an FDA approved commercial home-based kit will be used (HCG Urine Pregnancy Test Strip). Results are available after only a few minutes. Once the results are clear, the researcher will make a note and the sample will be disposed. All samples will be handled using single-use disposable medical gloves. 6.4.[ADDRESS_692883] 30 minutes before providing a sample.  Once the participant provides the 2ml sample, the collection tube is closed and a liquid from the lid will be released into the tube. The original lid will be removed and replaced with a small cap and the tube will be agitated for 5 seconds.  The sample is then returned to the plastic packaging and labeled with the date of collection, the study name, and the participant ID.  These samples are kept in a secure location at room temperature until the completion of data collection. Once data collection is complete, the PCR will be performed at the UNC Biospecimen Processing Facility and Sangar sequencing will be done by [CONTACT_533481]. INSTRUCTIONS FOR SPECIMEN PREPARATION, HANDLING AND STORAGE FOR SEX HORMONE TESTING. Saliva will be collected using SalivaBio Passive Drool Method. The same restrictions that apply for saliva samples for DNA testing apply here as well. 2ml sample will be collected in a cryovial and froze at -20° C at a secure location. In contrast to saliva for genotype testing, no preservatives are used. Once data collection is done, the samples will be analyzed for levels of estradiol, progesterone and testosterone by [CONTACT_413124]. The samples being sent will be deidentified. 6.5  COGNITIVE TASKS 6.5.1 COGNITIVE CONTROL TASK The cognitive control task is a well-established task in functional magnetic resonance imaging (Koechlin et al. 2003; Badre & D’Esposito 2007), electrocorticography in epi[INVESTIGATOR_533467] (Voytek et al. 2015), and causal testing in stroke patient populations (Badre et al. 2009). The task involves a series of rules that are required to select an appropriate action. In the simple cognitive control conditions, there is a clear mappi[INVESTIGATOR_533468]. In the complex cognitive control conditions, there are context rules that change the lower level rules that must be followed. Previous research using this task shows cross-frequency coupling as measured by [CONTACT_66954] (EEG) that will be targeted by [CONTACT_320686]-tACS proposed here (Riddle et al. in preparation).  
2PAC  Version 3.[ADDRESS_692884] of 400 trials. The EEG recorded simultaneously with the task will be analyzed following an established preprocessing pi[INVESTIGATOR_533469], eye blinks, heart beats and muscle activity. The oscillation power and phase will be estimated using Morlet wavelet convolution. The primary outcome is phase-amplitude coupling between the stimulated frequencies (measured from EEG), reaction time, and accuracy. Phase amplitude coupling will be calculated using the phase locking value z-corrected based on a boot-strapped null distribution from randomly shifting the amplitude values 1000 times (see Cohen Analyzing Neural Time Series Data 2014 for method). Our primary outcomes: • Theta-gamma tACS will increase theta-gamma phase amplitude coupling (one-tailed, Student’s t-test) • Delta-beta tACS will increase delta-beta phase amplitude coupling (one-tailed, Student’s t-test). • Theta-gamma tACS will alter behavior (reaction time or accuracy) as a function of set-size (Student’s t-test). • Delta-beta tACS will alter behavior (reaction time or accuracy) as a function of abstraction (Student’s t-test). 7.2 SECONDARY OUTCOMES The following will be assessed as secondary outcomes  • Brain behavior correlation to account for inter-participant variance. For the significant behavioral findings, we will correlate the strength of phase amplitude coupling during the post-stimulation rest period with the impact on behavior. • For the significant behavioral findings, brain behavior correlation between the strength of phase amplitude coupling in the baseline session to the behavioral effect of CF-tACS on task performance. 7.3 EXPLORATORY OUTCOMES Additionally, the following exploratory measures will be assessed • Modulation in spectral power in other frequency bands (1 – 4 Hz; 8 – 12 Hz; 12 – 30 Hz; 30 – 50 Hz) of CF-tACS • Coherence between distant regions of the brain in the slower frequency of the CF-tACS coupled pair (delta and theta) • Hormone level and BDNF as covariates in analysis of differences in spectral power • Self-reported anxiety, affect and sleep quality as covariates in the analysis of differences in spectral power

A single return electrode (5.0 cm x 7.0 cm) will be affixed in the same manner between Cz and Fz.  Our stimulation setup consists of the stimulator controlled by a desktop through a USB DAQ (National Instruments). Stimulation parameters (waveform, duration, amplitude) is set by [CONTACT_533483]. The software receives stimulation codes and generates the stimulation waveform and sends it to the stimulator where the waveform is converted to stimulation current. The mappi[INVESTIGATOR_533470] (Sangtae Ahn) will be able to access this.  The study coordinator and/or the research assistant will be thoroughly trained and have trainings documented on the transcranial stimulation device and will be present during all stimulation sessions.

The results of this study may also prompt further investigation into the relationship between cortical oscillations and brain stimulation waveforms. This study is not designed to benefit the individual participants.  9.2 POTENTIAL RISKS 8.2.1 PHYSICAL Risk of Injury and Discomfort: Transcranial current stimulation has been used without any reports of serious side-effects for more than a decade. This stimulation made has NOTHING to do with electroconvulsive therapy that applies many orders of magnitude higher stimulation current. Rather, transcranial current stimulation is so weak that it does not cause super-threshold activation of neurons (Frohlich and McCormick, 2010). In particular, tACS has been used without reports of any serious side-effects. Some participants report a transient mild tingling, burning, or itching underneath the electrodes and headache, but no other side effects have been noted. Importantly, it remains unclear if these mild side-effects were caused by [CONTACT_226239]. In order to monitor these side-effects, we will be administering an adverse effects stimulation questionnaire after each stimulation session to determine whether these effects were experienced. Research personnel present during these sessions will also check in with the participant periodically during the stimulation to see whether they are comfortable. If the participant experiences severe discomfort, the stimulation will be immediately stopped and the participant will withdraw from the study.  9.3 REFERRALS FOR MEDICAL FOLLOW-UP OR PSYCHOLOGICAL COUNSELING There is a purely theoretical likelihood that stimulation of neuronal circuits can lead to epi[INVESTIGATOR_61573]. To minimize this occurrence, we screen and exclude patients with personal and family history of neurological conditions from the study. If abnormalities or a seizure is witnessed during the course of the study, a referral will be made to the UNC Department of Neurology for follow-up. In the theoretical event that a seizure is witnessed that involves the loss of consciousness, the patient will be told not to operate a motor vehicle until cleared by [CONTACT_61601]. To ensure participant comfort, a study coordinator or research assistant will periodically check in with the participant about any side-effects he/she may be experiencing during each stimulation session. Following the conclusion of the stimulation session, the participant will receive an Adverse Effects Questionnaire to report on any of the side-effects he/she may have experienced. This questionnaire reports side-effects on a likert scale (1=Absent, 2=Mild, 3=Moderate, 4=Severe). If the participant reports side-effects of Moderate to Severe intensity, a study coordinator or research assistant will discuss the side-effects experienced and note this response. If the participant has rated Severe discomfort, the participant will be withdrawn. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_533471]’s verbal confirmation of intensity.  9.3.[ADDRESS_692890] on Day 1 of Stimulation.

CONFIDENTIAL  23 10 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING 10.1 FROHLICH LAB MONITORING PLAN The purpose of this monitoring plan is to present the Frohlich Lab’s approach to monitoring clinical trials. The plan facilitates compliance with good clinical practice (GCP): a. The rights and well-being of human subjects are protected. b. The reported trial data are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents c. The conduct of the trial is in compliance with the currently approved protocol/amendment(s) with GCP, and with applicable regulatory requirement(s) This section identifies key monitoring activities and specifies the data to be reviewed over the course of a clinical trial. This is a single site, investigator-initiated, clinical trial, so there will be no site monitoring plan in place. The latest version of the approved IRB application for this clinical trial will be followed at all times. This responsibility falls into the hands of the study coordinator and research assistants. If at any time there is a deviation from protocol, the deviation from protocol log will be filled out. All team members will be trained on how and when to use this log. The most up-to-date IRB application will be on file in the Clinical Trials office in Room 233 of the Medical School Wing C. Deviations will be sent to the IRB every 4-6 weeks (if necessary). Periodically, study staff should review 3 randomly selected informed consent forms to ensure that (1) these forms have been filled out appropriately, and (2) the consent form process was followed and properly documented. Should any consent form be in violation, the research team will perform and document a complete review of all consent forms.  Given that we are not sampling within a clinical population we do not expect suicidal ideation to be a concern. However, we will review the Beck's inventory within [ADDRESS_692891]. Fryml, who will respond appropriately. AE and SAE are clearly defined in this document. Documents of AE and SAE can be found in the study binder on file in the Clinical Trials office in Room 233 of the Medical School Wing C. It is the responsibility of the study coordinator to report all events to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_2993] a timely manner (see 9.3 Reporting Procedures). All AEs and SAEs will be discussed with the PI. For our practices, we have adapted the decision tree provided by [CONTACT_84041]-CH IRB to assist with reporting of such events. 10.2 SAFETY OVERSIGHT  Safety oversight will be under the direction of the PI, who will review AEs in real time and make decisions regarding a participant’s continuation of the clinical trial.  10.3 EARLY WITHDRAWAL OF PARTICIPANTS 10.3.1 REASONS FOR WITHDRAWAL A study participant will be discontinued from further participation if: • The participant fails to adhere to rules, including stress, exercise, and sleep restrictions 
2PAC  Version 3.0 IRB 180003  9 January 2020 
CONFIDENTIAL  24 • The participant meets any exclusion criteria (either newly developed or not previously recognized). • Anything that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would place the participant at increased risk or preclude the participant’s full compliance with or completion of the study. • Participants experience severe discomfort during stimulation Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request. 10.3.[ADDRESS_692892] had no seizures occur (Berlim et al., 2013, Brunelin et al., 2012). The study will also be stopped (at least temporarily) if studies provide evidence that transcranial current stimulation caused brain damage or other harmful effects on subjects, either short-term or long-term. Examples of findings that might trigger a safety review are the number of SAEs overall, the number of occurrences of a particular type of SAE, severe AEs/reactions, or increased frequency of events. The reasons for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_84005]: • If a seizure occurs during a study visit, a temporary hold will be placed on the clinical trial The IRB will also be informed promptly and provided the reason(s) for the termination of suspension of by [CONTACT_093], as specified by [CONTACT_8146](s).

The adverse effects questionnaire asks participants to respond on a 4-point Likert scale on the severity of symptoms experienced during the stimulation session (1 = absent, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe). The side effects listed are headache, neck pain, scalp pain, tingling, itching, ringing/buzzing noise, burning sensation, local redness, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], trouble concentrating, improved mood, worsening of mood, dizziness, flickering lights, and other (specify). Participants are also asked to rate on a 5-point Likert scale how related they believe the side effects to be to stimulation (1 = no relation, 2 = remote, 3 = possible, 4 = probable, 5 = definite). In addition to this survey, the study coordinator or research assistant will periodically check in with the participant during the stimulation session to assess side effects.  11.2 METHODS AND TIMING FOR ASSESSING, RECORDING, AND ANALYZING SAFETY PARAMETERS 11.2.1 ADVERSE EVENTS All AEs, including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for “serious adverse events”, will be captured on the appropriate CRF. In addition, the AE Report Form will be completed by [CONTACT_9137] (Appendix B). The AE Report Form includes the following: • What is known about the therapy • What is known about previous reported side effects • If the AE occurred in temporal relation to the therapy • Whether or not the AE improves or disappears when treatment is stopped • Whether the AE is worsening of baseline symptoms • Whether the AE is related to concurrent medical condition or medication use Once complete, this form will be given to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_7706]-I, who will review, comment, and sign this form. Completed forms will be placed in the participant’s folder. In addition, the study coordinator will document any AE occurrence on the AE log (Appendix D), which includes information such as the date of the AE, severity, relationship to the treatment (assessed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_7706]-I*), actions taken, and outcome(s). The log will be reviewed and initialed by [CONTACT_978] 72 hours after being completed. All AEs occurring during the clinical trial will be documented appropriately regardless of relationship to CF-tACS. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution and will be graded for severity and relationship to study treatment. Any medical condition noted at the initial session will be considered at baseline and not reported as an AE. All AEs will be graded for severity using the following guidelines: 
2PAC  Version 3.0 IRB 180003  9 January 2020 
CONFIDENTIAL  26 • ASYMPTOMATIC. The participant is exhibiting no symptoms due to this event; no treatment needed. • MILD. Event results in mild or transient discomfort, not requiring intervention or treatment; does not limit or interfere with daily activities (e.g., insomnia, mild headache) • MODERATE. Event is sufficiently discomforting so as to limit or interfere with daily activities; may require interventional treatment (e.g., fever requiring antipyretic medication). In the case of a moderate AE, the medical advisor may recommend an over the counter medication. • SEVERE AND UNDESIRABLE. Event results in significant symptoms that prevent normal daily activities; may require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84006] (e.g., anemia resulting in blood transfusion). Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented with the Note to File document (Appendix E) and will be filed in the participant’s folder. *Relationship to Study Products: The PI [INVESTIGATOR_533472]. The event will be labeled associated if the event is temporally related to the administration of a therapy and no other factors can explain the event. The event will be labeled as not associated if the event is temporally independent of the study treatment and can be explained by [CONTACT_84042], such as major life events. 11.2.2 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS Serious Adverse Event (SAE): An SAE, as defined by [CONTACT_18121], consists of adverse events that result in death, require either inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_84007], are life-threatening, result in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity or result in congenital anomaly/birth defect.  Other important medical events, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may also be considered Serious Adverse Events if a trial participant’s health is at risk and intervention is required to prevent an outcome mentioned. All SAEs will be recorded on the Serious Adverse Events Form (Appendix B), documented in the UE/SAE log and reported to the IRB.  The SAE Form will be completed by [CONTACT_9137], and includes information relating to the onset and nature of the SAE, relationship to the study treatment, seriousness of the SAE, treatment required as a response to the SAE, and outcome.  This form will be filed in the participant’s folder at the resolution of the event.  The study coordinator will complete the UE/SAE log (Appendix D) which includes information such as the date of the event, time at which the study team was informed of the event, details, when the IRB was notified, and the date that the SAE form was completed. 11.2.3 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS Unexpected Events (UE) will be recorded on the UE/SAE log (Appendix D) and will include information such as the date of the event, when the study team was informed of this event, details of the event, when the IRB was notified, and whether the SAE form was completed.  The IRB will be notified of each UE that may occur during the study. The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) considers unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria: 
2PAC  Version 3.0 IRB 180003  9 January 2020 
CONFIDENTIAL  27 • unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; • related or possibly related to participation in the research (in the guidance document, possibly related means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and • suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized. If an UE occurs the IRB will be notified and the study will be adjusted as needed to protect the health and safety of the participants.  Depending on the nature of the UE, the research protocol, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and informed consent will be changed to reflect the possibility of this event reoccurring. During this time, no new participants will be recruited and the research procedures for currently enrolled participants will be stopped.  Each UE will be recorded and reported throughout the study.      11.3 REPORTING PROCEDURES We will be adopting the OHRE’s “Reporting New Safety Information” SOP (SOP #1401): What Event is Reported When is Event Reported By [CONTACT_456107]-threatening unexpected, suspected serious adverse reactions Within 7 calendar days of initial receipt of information Investigator UNC IRB Non-fatal, non-life threatening unexpected, suspected serious adverse reactions Within 7 calendar days of initial receipt of information Investigator UNC IRB/Institutional Officials, DSMB Unanticipated adverse device effects Within [ADDRESS_692894] Investigator UNC IRB Unanticipated problem that is not an SAE Continuing Review Investigator UNC IRB/Institutional officials All protocol deviations that did not harm subject(s) or others or place subject(s) or others at increased risk of harm Continuing Review Investigator UNC IRB 11.3.1 REPORTING OF PREGNANCY Pregnancy tests will be administered on Visit 1 of Stimulation to all women of child-bearing potential (CBP). Within the study target population (ages 18-35), menstruating females, regardless of age are considered “CBP”. Women who have had a hysterectomy or a bilateral oophorectomy are not considered of “CBP”. There are no studies that suggest CF-tACS would interfere with pregnancy.

2PAC  Version 3.[ADDRESS_692895] the null hypothesis indicated in section 2.4 Study Aims/Hypothesis.  The cognitive task will consist of 400 trials. The EEG recorded simultaneously with the task will be analyzed following an established preprocessing pi[INVESTIGATOR_533469], eye blinks, heart beats and muscle activity. The oscillation power and phase will be estimated using Morlet wavelet convolution. The primary outcome is phase-amplitude coupling between the stimulated frequencies (measured from EEG), reaction time, and accuracy. Phase amplitude coupling will be calculated as the phase locking value corrected for spurious noise using a boot-strapped null distribution (see Cohen Analyzing Neural Time Series Data 2014 for method).  Our primary outcomes and their test are described below: • Theta-gamma tACS will increase theta-gamma phase amplitude coupling (one-tailed, Student’s t-test) • Delta-beta tACS will increase delta-beta phase amplitude coupling (one-tailed, Student’s t-test). • Theta-gamma tACS will alter behavior (reaction time or accuracy) as a function of set-size relative to sham-tACS (Student’s t-test). • Delta-beta tACS will alter behavior (reaction time or accuracy) as a function of abstraction relative to sham-tACS (Student’s t-test).

The OHRE administers, supports, and guides the work of the Institutional Review Boards and all related activities. Any research involving human participants proposed by [CONTACT_61607], staff, or students must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_61608], and before related grants may be funded. OHRE and the IRBs are critical components of the coordinated Human Research Protection Program, which serves to protect the rights and welfare of human participants. All components of this program must work together to ensure institutional compliance with ethical principles and regulatory requirements. The following is a mission statement for the coordinated Human Research Protection Program: The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is committed to expanding and disseminating knowledge for the benefit of the people of North Carolina and the world. An important part of that commitment to knowledge is research of the highest quality on all aspects of the health and behavior of people, and such research is only possible through the participation of humans as research participants. Human participants are partners in research and a precious resource to the university. At UNC-Chapel Hill, human participant research is a privilege, but not a right. Consistent with that philosophy, it is the mission of the UNC-Chapel Hill Human Research Protection Program to ensure that: a. The rights and welfare of human participants are paramount in the research process; b. The highest standards of ethical conduct are employed in all research involving human participants; c. Research investigators are properly trained in the ethical and regulatory aspects of research with human participants; d. Research investigators deal honestly and fairly with human participants, informing them fully of procedures to be followed, and the risks and benefits of participating in research; and e. Research using human participants at UNC-CH conforms to applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations and the policies of the university. 14.3 INFORMED CONSENT PROCESS Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in the study and continues throughout the individual’s study participation. Extensive discussion of risks and possible benefits of tACS will be provided to the participants. Consent forms describing, in detail, the study intervention, device, procedures, and risks are given to the participant and written documentation of informed consent is required prior to the administration of any treatment or assessments used in this study. All consent forms will be IRB-approved and updated with any new information as modifications are made throughout the study.

I’m calling in regards to your interest in our study on the effects of brain stimulation on brain activity. Do you have about 10 minutes now to hear about the study, answer a few screening questions, and possibly schedule your visit?   (If ‘No’, ask for a good time to call back) (If ‘Yes’, proceed)  First, I need to ask for your verbal consent to conduct the screening interview. I will ask questions about your age, medication and drug use, and family and personal health history. You may decline to answer any questions, but please keep in mind that this may affect our ability to determine if you qualify for the study. Of course, the information you provide is strictly confidential, and will not be used for any purpose other than eligibility. Do you consent to participate in the screening interview?  (If ‘No’, thank them for their time and hang up.) (If ‘Yes’, proceed)  Great! This study is looking at how brain activity respond to weak electrical stimulation. In this study, a weak electrical current will be applied to your scalp. Some participants have reported a mild tingling feeling while being stimulated, but no other side effects have been found. It is not a shock and should cause no pain.  This study will include two sessions scheduled a week apart from each other at your convenience, each lasting approximately 3 hours. You will be compensated for your time after each session, with total compensation amounting to $60. We will ask that you maintain a regular sleep schedule during the study, and adhere to restrictions on exercise, caffeine, and alcohol in the day prior to each session. Are you still interested in participating?

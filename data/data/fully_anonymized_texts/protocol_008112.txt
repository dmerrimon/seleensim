The primary endpoint of this trial ,annual rate of decline in FVC, will be analyzed by a random coefficient 
regression model including treatment group andbaseline FVC (mL ).
The key secondary endpoints will be analysed as follows: Proportion of participants with an absolute decline 
from baseline in FVC % predicted of ≤10% at week 52 wil l be analysed by [CONTACT_528338] (mL) in the model. 
Change from baseline in the SGRQ total score at week [ADDRESS_685868] hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (any respi[INVESTIGATOR_285551]) will be analysed by a Cox PH model .  
Time to death (all -causes) will be analysed by [CONTACT_528339]. 
Secondary and further endpoints will be analysed in an exploratory manner.
Sample size justification:
The annual decline in FVC for placebo is estimated to be 200ml. To detect a d ifference from placebo in the 
decline of FVC of 100ml with a standard deviation of 240ml at the signific ance level of 10%, a sample size of 
141, with a randomization ratio of 2:1, the study would have 75% power.

4.0 INTRODUCTION
Study Background
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), the most common form of the idiopathic interstitial 
pneumonias, is a chronic, progressive, irreversible, and usually lethal lung disease of unknown 
cause. IPF occurs mostly in elderly adults, is limited to the lungs, and is associated with a 
histopa thological or radiological pattern typi[INVESTIGATOR_528254] (UIP) [ 1-3]. The 
disease course is heterogeneous with clinical course highly variable from one subject to another. 
In general, the clinical course can be relatively slow but progressive or very rapid with 
deterioration leading to decline in lung function and death. The clinical pi[INVESTIGATOR_528255], respi[INVESTIGATOR_528256] 2 to 3 years from diagnosis [ 4-7]. 
The cause of IPF is unknown, but it appears to be a disorder likely arising from the interplay 
between environmental and genetic factors. Cigarette smo king is the most consistent 
environmental risk factor. Genetic factors have also been strongly implicated in both sporadic 
IPF and familial pulmonary fibrosis. A growing body of evidence suggests that the disease 
process is initiated through alveolar epi[INVESTIGATOR_528257]. Subsequently, 
fibroblasts proliferate and differentiate into myofibroblasts, leading to the excessive 
accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components including collagen and fibronectin 
under the control of prof ibrogenic stimuli such as transforming growth factor β (TGF -β). The 
resulting fibrotic tissue is characterized by [CONTACT_528341], organ injury, function decline and 
organ failure [8-13].TGF- β has been assigned a clear pathogenic role by [CONTACT_528342][INVESTIGATOR_1663] (AECs) in IPF. Inhibiting TGF -β activity, in 
experimental models of lung fibrosis reduces the fibrosis. [ 14-23].
The natural history of IPF is heterogeneous; therefore, raising a number of challenges for 
individual patient management. There are a number of asymptomatic subjects with subclinical, 
undiagnosed disease, especially among the elderly [ 24, 25 ].Some subjects remain relatively 
stable for a prolonged period of time, while others progress rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375] [ 26] and some experience 4.1
Galecto Biotech AB Page 21 of 105
GALACTIC -1 v7.1_[LOCATION_006] 28 January 2022
acute exacerbations of IPF, e.g., acute res pi[INVESTIGATOR_528258] [ 27] of unidentified cause [28 ] 
leading to non -elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_528259] [ 29]. IPF has a broad and profound 
impact on subjects’health- related quality of life (HRQoL) [ 30, 31].
Two drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], pi[INVESTIGATOR_16317] , are currently licensed for the treatment of IPF. 
Both therapi[INVESTIGATOR_528260]/ERS/JRS/ALAT 
clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of IPF due to the potentially significant adverse 
effects with both therapie s [36].Both drugs appear to have comparable efficacy, approximately 
halving the rate of disease progression over 52 weeks as assessed by [CONTACT_528343]. However, neither has shown clear evidence of a survival or symptomatic 
benefit [32-35].Moreover, tolerability limits the use of both drugs in some subjects, and it 
increasingly recognized that a number of subjects either r equire a reduced dose or have to stop 
treatment [ 36-39].Hence there remains a significant unmet medical need in IPF.
Although they have been widely used in the past, current evidence does n ot support the use of 
corticosteroid or immunosuppressant as a therapy for IPF [ 3, 40, 41].Indeed, long- term 
corticosteroid therapy is associated with signi ficant treatment -related morbidity and various 
potentially severe side effects. As a result, current evidence -based guidelines [ 3]provide a strong 
recommendation against the use of corticosteroid monotherapy in IPF, albeit in the absence of 
any randomized placebo- controlled trial. 
Study Rationale
4.2.1 Role of Galectin -3 in fibrosis
Gal-3 is a beta -galactoside -binding mammalian lectin (a carbohydrate binding protein) of 
approximately 30 kDa which is evolutionarily highly conserved [ 42]. In multiple models of 
organ fibrosis, it has been demonstrated that Gal -3 is potently pro- fibrotic, modulating the 
activi ty of fibroblasts and macrophages in chronically injured tissues [ 18, 43- 48].It is 
hypothesized that increased Gal -[ADDRESS_685873] activation 
via the aggregation of growth factor receptor clusters (such as TGF -ß), thereby [CONTACT_528344]-4.2
Galecto Biotech AB Page 22of 105
GALACTIC -1 v7.1_[LOCATION_006] 28 January 2022
fibrotic signal cascades. Mice that are deficient in Gal -3, although phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_514561], 
develop reduced fibrosis in response to tiss ue injury in lung, liver, blood vessels, heart, and 
kidney, and also in response to allograft rejection 
[43-48].In addition, preclinical studies using 
direct intratracheal administration of the galectin -3 inhibitor GB0139 showed that GB0139
decreased bleomycin -induced fibrosis when administered during the fibrotic phase in mice [ 18,
49]. Thus , Gal - 3 may be an important regulator of fibrosis, and these pre -clinical studies provide 
a proof of principal that inhibition of Gal -3 in man could be a potential novel therapeutic 
strategy. Gal -3 is up -regulated in subjects with IPF with elevated levels of Gal -3 in 
bronch oalveolar lavage fluid and serum [18] but not in non- specific interstitial pneumonia 
(NSIP), suggesting that Gal -3 may be a more specifically associated with disease pathogenesis 
and outcome in IPF. Gal -3 is also upregulate d during acute exacerbations of IPF. Gal -3 
expression is also up -regulated in other chronic fibroses, including fibrotic liver disease, 
regardless of etiology [ 44]. Together, these observations support the development of Ga l -3 
selective inhibitors for IPF.
GB0139 is a small molecule lectin inhibitor designed specifically to modulate the fibrogenic 
response to tissue injury. GB0139 has been formulated for inhaled delivery to both target the 
disease site in the periphery of the lung in IPF more directly, and to limit any potential systemic 
toxicity. More details on the profile of GB0139 be found in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).
Galecto Biotech AB conducted a phase 1 clinical study in human volunteers and in 24 subjects 
with IPF in which GB0139 was delivered once daily by [CONTACT_528345] a Plastiape 
device. The trial was divided into two parts. Part 1 (single ascending dose) explored the safety 
and tolerability of GB0139 in healthy volunteers. Part 2 (IND opening study) investigated the 
safety, tolerability pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in subjects with IPF. The clinical 
protocol was discussed with the FDA during a pre -IND meeting held on 03 December 2014, and 
the changes suggested by [CONTACT_528346] 2 of the protocol was 
conducted under the IND.
Galecto Biotech AB Page 23 of 105
GALACTIC -1 v7.1_[LOCATION_006] 28 January 2022
The results from clinical trial GB -HV-01 confirm that GB0139 is safe and well tolerated at 
single inhaled doses up to 50 mg in healthy volunteers [Single Ascending Dose (Part 1)], and 
multipl
e inhaled doses up to 10 mg daily in IPF subjects during 2 weeks of treatment [Multiple 
Ascending Dose (Part 2)]. Further, GB -HV-01 demonstrated that GB0139 reaches the alveolar 
macrophages at pharmacologically relevant concentrations and causes a dose -dependent 
reduction in cell surface Galectin-3 in participants with IPF . In addition, dose -response related 
reductions were observed in the plasma levels of putative IPF biomarkers (YKL -40, PAI -1, 
PDGF -BB, and CCL18 ), which have been associated with IPF disea se severity and all -cause 
mortality [ 50].
Based on both preclinical and available clinical data, GB0139 is expected to demonstrate a 
favou rable risk/benefit profile compared with existing treatment options. No dose -limiting

6.0 STUDY DESIGN
Overall design
Following a review of unblinded efficacy and safety data by [CONTACT_1758]’s DSMB in Feb2021, the 
study design is modified based on the DSMB’s recommendation. DSMB has recommended the 
participants randomised to the 10 mg GB0139 group and all those currently taking nintedanib or 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_528261]. Galecto expects to continue recruiting 
participants who are no ttaking nintedanib or pi[INVESTIGATOR_528262] 3 mg GB0139 or placebo.
This remains a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial in subjects with 
IPF. The updated design based on the above DSMB’s recommendation is summarized in Figure 
1below.

There are three study periods:
Screening Period –After signing the study inform consent form (ICF) participant will enter a 
screening period up to 6 weeks. 
Treatment Period -Following randomization, eligible participants will receive blinded treatment, 
GB0139 or placebo, for 52 weeks. Clinic visits will be performed at week 0/baseline, and then at 
weeks 4, 8, 12, 26, 40, and 52 according to the Study Time and Events Table (Section 2.2)
Follow up P eriod -At the end of the treatment period (week 52), a safety follow -up phone call 
will be performed 7 days after the withdrawal/last study visit. 
Number of Participants
Approximately 141participants in total will be randomized in GALACTIC -1.
Participa nts are considered evaluable if they have taken at least one dose of the double -blind 
treatment. 
Participants who prematurely discontinue double -blind study treatment after randomization can 
remain in the study and complete the remaining scheduled visits, if possible.
Any participants who withdrawn from the study after randomization cannot be replace dand re -
screened. 
Participant -and Study completion
A participant is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed all periods of the 
study including follow up visit. 
The end of study is defined as the date of the last safety follow up via phone of the last 
participant in the study. 
Study Design Rationale
Based on the DSMB’s recommendation, GALACTIC -1 can continue to randomise participants 
with IPF to receive either placebo or 3 mg GB0139 in a randomized and blinded fashion. 6.2
6.3
6.4
Galecto Biotech AB Page 26of 105
GALACTIC -1 v7.1_[LOCATION_006] 28 January 2022
A placebo treatment arm included in the study is to allow for a quantitative assessment of the 
efficacy of 3 mg GB0139 compared with an inactive control. Use of the pla cebo is also essential 
in the evaluation of the GB0139 safety in this study. 
DSMB also recommended no further co
-administration of GB0139 with nintedanib and 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_7735]. Therefore, patients who are not currently taking or cannot tolerate nintedanib or 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_528263] (Section 7.0). Furthermore, nintedanib and pi[INVESTIGATOR_528264] 6. 1_[LOCATION_006] . 
Eligible participants will be randomized in a ratio of 2:1 to receive either 3 mg GB0139 or 
placebo. The updated design has maintained the ratio of active to placebo in the original study 
design, after the 10 mg GB0139 treatment group was removed in Protocol version 6. 1_[LOCATION_006] .  
The 12 months (52 weeks) treatment duration is considered optimal for evaluating the primary 
endpoint in the study.
FVC is generally accepted as a measure of disease severity and as a predictor of survival in IPF. 
FVC is also commonly used as the primary efficacy measure for clinical trials in IPF. The 
decline of lung function in IPF is punctuated by [CONTACT_528347] a substantial 
risk of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47144]. Thus, any intervention which reduces the time to 
exacerbation represents a substantial benefit and will be evaluated. In addition to measurements 
of lung volume (FVC), diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) as well as oxygen 
saturation (SpO2) will be monitored and assessed as secondary lung function endpoints.
Survival is recognised as an important measure to evaluate effect of a potential treatment for IPF 
therefore , time to death (all-cause mortality) isincluded as one of the key 
secondary endpoint s. 
Patients wi th IPF also suffer from dyspnea, cough and poor exercise tolerance, which can reduce 
the quality of life and cause a severe restriction in their activities of in every -day life. Therefore, 
a number of patient-reported outcome instruments including SGRQ will be used to document the 
effect on symptoms and their impact on the patient’s quality of life.

GALACTIC -1 v7.1_[LOCATION_006] 28 January 2022
Dose Justification
In the phase Ib study in IPF patients 3 mg GB0139 administered via dry powder inhaler has 
shown to reduce alveolar macrophage (AM) Gal -3 sur face expression to 42.8 % of baseline 
levels over 14 days of treatment [50]. When comparing the 3 mg GB0139 group with placebo on 
day 14, five high relevance plasma markers (PDGF -BB, PDGF -AA, PAI -1, YKL -40 and MCP 
1) associ ated with IPF pathogenesis were either significantly reduced or showed a trend for 
reduction [50]. In addition, there was a correlation between the change in lung Gal -3 levels and 
the change in plasma levels of the high rel evance biomarkers across the 3 mg and 10 mg groups 
(see IB for details ). Therefore, these reductions in plasma biomarkers were associated with the 
GB0139 -induced reduction in Gal -3 expression on AMs and support the lung PK/PD as the key 
driver of the obser ved systemic biomarker changes. These observations, coupled with AM Gal -3 
target engagement data on 3 mg GB0139 , indicated potential efficacy at this dose level in IPF 
which supports the further evaluation of 3 mg in the present study. 
The 3 mg GB0139 dose was also well tolerated in healthy participants and participants with IPF 
in the phase I study.
Dosing
Following Protocol version 6.1_[LOCATION_006], subjects eligible for the study will be randomised into 2:1

All subjects must be trained in the use of the inhaler device at w0/baseline, according to the 
instructions provided with the device ( Appendix 1 in Section 18.0). Placebo capsules and inhaler 
devices will be provided for training and demonstration purposes. Site staff should be assured the 
subject will be able to administer the drug at home safely and competently. The same DPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_528265]. Study site 
personnel will dispense the IMPs, a nd site personnel will facilitate administration when the

be dispensed with the IMP. One (1) to three (3) inhalations from the DPI [INVESTIGATOR_528269]. Any problems with drug administrat ion will be noted in the CRF.
Site staff will instruct the subject on how to take the drug, including the number of capsules to be 
inhaled each day and the timing of dose administration. On administration of the first dose the 
subject should be monitored a t the site for 1 hour to observe any acute adverse reaction to study 
medication (e.g., bronchospasm). The PI/attending physician may perform additional spi[INVESTIGATOR_528270], in their opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], it is safe to do so and would be helpful in the 
assessment of any such events. For daily doses taken at home, subjects should be advised to 
administer the study drug at approximately the same time of day. Subjects will be given DPI 
[INVESTIGATOR_528271] (plus one week). Subjects will be encouraged to 
contact [CONTACT_528348]. 8.1

Management of Clinical Events 
Management of all types of adverse events, regardless of the possible underlying cause is the 
responsibility of the treating physician/investigator . 
Blinding and Unblinding procedures
8.5.[ADDRESS_685882] in this double -blind study (Sites, Study team, CRO s, other service providers) 
will remain blinded with regard to the randomised treatment assignments until after database 
lock. Only the D SMB will have access to unblinded information. An IVRS/IWRS will be used to 
assign subjects to treatment groups at study start. The randomisa tion code will be kept 
undisclosed up to database lock. 
8.5.[ADDRESS_685883] is essential for 
appropriate treatment of an AE, the Investigator should ideally consult with the CRO/Galecto 
before breaking the code. In any event, the Investigator should inform Galecto Biotech AB 
(subsequently referred to as Galecto) as soon as possible whenever the code has been broken for 
a subject. In the event that the site requires emergency access to an i ndividual subject code and 
personnel from Galecto are not available, each site may break the blind without any prior 
consultation. In such an event, the Chief Investigator, Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_528274] 8.[ADDRESS_685884]’s CRF. The 
IVRS/IWRS will provide a telephone/web procedure for unblinding the code to the Investigator / 
Pharmacist / in vestigational drug storage Manager. The Investigator will not reveal the unblinded 
treatment code to any other member of the clinical team involved in the study or to the Study 
Monitor. If the code is broken for any individual subject, the subject will be withdrawn from the 
study and the procedures accompanying the withdrawal visit performed. If the code is broken 
without justification, this will be deemed a serious protocol violation.
To avoid unblinding of the study team through drug safety reports which are to be unblinded as 
per regulatory requirements, a procedure will be maintained to keep code -breaking in these cases 
unknown to the study team.
Description of Investigational Agents 
The planned dose levels (3and 10 mg GB0139 ) have been selected in the original study design 
(Protocol version 5. 1_[LOCATION_006]) following review of non -clinical pharmacokinetic, safety 
pharmacology and toxicology data. Pharmacokinetic, toxicokinetic and toxicology studies in 
mice, rats and dogs indicate the drug is readily bioavaila ble via the inhaled route with little or no 
accumulation after 14 -daydosing and is excreted in the faeces with a t1/2 of approximately 6 h.
Given the lack of adverse effects seen in the two species as well as the favourable safety profile 
seen in the phas e I/IIa in healthy volunteers and IPF subjects, no direct anticipated adverse drug 
specific side effects are expected in the current study, nor are any drug interactions anticipated 
given the clear cytochrome profiling. Further details regarding non -clinic al pharmacokinetic, 
safety pharmacology and toxicology data can be found in the IB.
Packaging and Labeling 
The IMPs will be prepared by [CONTACT_528349]. The Sponsor must 
ensure that the Investigator is notified prior to dispat ch of IMP supplies, and of the anticipated 
date of their arrival. The IMP is shipped upon firstscreening, then arrives on site prior to dosing.8.[ADDRESS_685885] access. After a review of the temperature monitors included with shipments 
the Sponsor /CRO must ensure that it is confirmed that the transportation conditions w ere 
acceptable.
Storage, Handling, and Accountability 
Following the Sponsor’s approval, all remaining IMP will either be returned to the Sponsor or 
sent for destruction within 8 weeks of completion of the study -dosing period.
All used IMP containers and u nused IMP will be held under quarantine in the investigator site 
facility pending accountability/return/destruction .8.8

A serum pregnancy (choriogonadotropin beta) test will be completed by [CONTACT_528357]
-bearing potential during screening; this test must be negative for the subject to be enrolled. 
Urinary pregnancy tests will then be repeated at various times during the study as specified in the 
Time & Events table. 
Any occurrence of a pregnancy in a subject undergoing treatment in the GALACTIC- [ADDRESS_685899] be reported according to the rules agreed upon with the designated CRO within 24 hours of 
learning of its occurrence. The pregnancy should be followed -up via fax or email to determine
outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or 
absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or new -born 
complications.
Pregnancy should be recorded on a Pharmacovigilance Pregn ancy Form and reported by [CONTACT_528358]’s Pharmacovigilance 
(PV) representative. In case of any congenital abnormality, birth defect or maternal and new -
born complications, the possible relatio nship to the Galecto drug should be reported.
Additionally, any SAE experienced during pregnancy must be reported into the eCRF system.
Note: should the eCRF system become non -operational, the site must complete the appropriate
paper Serious Adverse Event Form . The completed form is then faxed/mailed within 24 hours of 
the Investigator’s or site’s awareness; however, the reported information must be entered into the 
eCRF system once it becomes operational. Please see Section 11.2 for PV reporting information .
10.4.11 Biomarkers 
A serum sample for the assessment of biomarkers will be collected at baseline (visit 2) and 
weeks 4, 12, [ADDRESS_685900] in Table 4gives examples of biomarkers potentially related to 
Galectin- 3 activity and/or IPF disease severity/prognosis. More detail on the rationale for

medications and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_528280].
10.4.19 Adverse Events
Monitoring of AEs, serious and nonserious, will be conducted throughout the study as specified 
in the Time and Events Table (Section 2.2). Refer to Section 11.0 for details regarding 
definitions, documentation, and reporting of pretreatment events (PTEs), AEs, and SAEs. 
Discontinuation of study t reatment 
Temporary discontinuation of GB0139 for <2 weeks will be permitted, if for reasons other than 
those stated below. The reason for discontinuation should be documented in the eCRF.
Treatment with study drug may be permanently discontinued for any of the following reasons:
•Persistent non- adherence by [CONTACT_1130]
•Adverse event assigned to the investigational drug
•Overall unsatisf actory therapeutic response
•Study terminated by [CONTACT_3211]
•Withdrawal by [CONTACT_1130]
•Lost to follow -up
•Other (cause to be elaborated on in the subject’s file)
In all cases, participants should be encouraged to discuss any potential study treatment 
discontinuation with the investigator prior to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_056]. If considered medically 
appropriate by [CONTACT_978], participants who have been withdrawn from study treatment can remain in 
the study, resume their usual standard of care treatment for IPF, if applicable, and complete 
scheduled visits and study assessments up to the follow up phone call.

11.0 ADVERSE EVENTS
Definitions
11.1.1 Pretreatment Event Definition
A pretreatment event (PTE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject who has signed 
informed consent to participate in a study but before administration of the first dose of study 
medication; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with study participation.
11.1.2 Treatment Emergent Adverse Event
A treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that emerges 
during treatment, having been absent pre -treatment or worsens relative to the pre -treatment state.
11.1.3 Adverse Event Definition
Adverse Event (AE) means any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product; the untoward medical occurrence does not n ecessarily 
have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) produc t whether or not it is related to the 
medicinal product. This includes any newly occurring event, or a previous condition that has 
increased in severity or frequency since the administration of study drug.
An abnormal laboratory value will not be assessed as an AE unless that value leads to 
discontinuation or delay in treatment, dose modification, therapeutic intervention, or is 
considered by [CONTACT_2418] a clinically significant change from baseline.
11.1.4 Serious Adverse Event Definition
Serious Adver se Event (SAE) means any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
Results in death.
Galecto Biotech AB Page 49of 105
GALACTIC -1 v7.1_[LOCATION_006] 28 January 2022
Is life-threatening (refers to an AE in which the subject was at risk of death at the time 
of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if 
it were more severe).
Requires subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324] (see 
clarification in the paragraph in Section 11.2 on planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]).
Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity . (Disability is defined as a 
substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions).
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect ?
Is a medically important event . This refers to an AE that may not result in death, be 
immediately life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may be consi dered serious 
when, based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject, require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
oneof the outcomes listed above, or involves 
suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent. Examples of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in subject 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse; any organism, 
virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting transmissible spongiform 
encephalopathy), pathogenic or nonpathogenic, is considered an infectious agent.
Clarification should be made between an SAE and an AE that is considere d severe in intensity 
(Grade 3 or 4), because the terms serious and severe are NOT synonymous. The general term 
severe is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event; the event itself, 
however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a Grade 3 headache). This is 
NOT the same as serious , which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria described 
above and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or ability to 
function. A sever e AE (Grade 3 or 4) does not necessarily need to be considered serious. For 
example, a white blood cell count of 1000/mm3to less than 2000 is considered Grade 3 (severe) 
Galecto Biotech AB Page 50 of 105
GALACTIC -1 v7.1_[LOCATION_006] 28 January 2022
but may not be considered serious. Seriousness (not intensity) serves as a guide for defining 
regulatory reporting obligations.
Procedures for Recording and Reporting Adverse Events and Serious 
Adverse Events
All AEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_3184]/or in response to an open question from study 
personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171] , physical examination, or other diagnostic procedures will 
be recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF (see Section 11.3 for the period of obs ervation).  
Any clinically relevant deterioration in laboratory assessments or other clinical finding is 
considered an AE. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying 
pathology should be noted as 1 comprehensive event.
Regardless of ca usality, SAEs and serious pretreatment events (as defined in Section 11.1) must 
be reported (see Section 11.3 for the period of observation) by [CONTACT_528359]’s 
pharmacovigilance representative or designee (contact [CONTACT_298192] w). This should 
be done by [CONTACT_29658]/mailing the paper SAE Form within [ADDRESS_685905] be 
consistent with the data provided on the eCRF. The SAE Form, created specifically by [CONTACT_528354] 
(or by [CONTACT_1701]), will be provided to each clinical study site.11.[ADDRESS_685906] Information:

INDIA 000-[PHONE_10939] 
Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_528281] (e .g.surgery was 
performed earlier or later than planned).
For both serious and nonserious AEs, the investigator must determine both the severity (toxicity 
grade) of the event and the relationship of the event to study drug administration. For serious 
pretreatment eve nts, the investigator must determine both the severity (toxicity grade) of the 
event and the causality of the event in relation to study procedures.
Relationship of the event to study drug administration (i
.e., its causality) will be determined by 
[CONTACT_528360] (related) or no (unrelated) to this question: “Is there a reasonable 
possibility that the AE is associated with the study drug?”
Galecto Biotech AB Page 52 of 105
GALACTIC -1 v7.1_[LOCATION_006] 28 January 2022
Monitoring of Adverse Events and Period of Observation
AEs, both nonserious and serious, will be moni tored throughout the study as follows: 
•AEs will be reported from the signing of informed consent through [ADDRESS_685907] dose of study drug and recorded in the eCRFs.    
•SAEs .
•Serious pretreatment events will be reported to the Galecto pharmacovigilance 
representative or designee from the time of the signing of the informed consent form up 
to first dose of study drug and will also be recorded in the eCRF. 
•Related and unrelated treatment -emergent SAEs will be reported to the Galecto 
pharmacovigilance representative or designee from the first dose of study drug through 
30days after administration of the last dose of study drug and recorded in the eCRF. 
After this period, only rel ated SAEs must be reported to the Galecto pharmacovigilance 
representative or designee. SAEs should be monitored until they are resolved or are 
clearly determined to be due to a subject’s stable or chronic condition or intercurrent 
illness(es).
Procedures for Reporting Drug Exposure During Pregnancy and Birth Events
If a woman becomes pregnant or suspects that she is pregnant while participating in this study, 
she must inform the investigator immediately and permanently discontinue study drug. The 
sponsor m ust also be contact[CONTACT_53344] a completed Pregnancy Form to the 
Galecto pharmacovigilance representative or designee (see Section 11.2). The pregnancy must be 
followed for the final pregnancy outcome.
If a female partner of a male subject becomes pregnant during the male subject’s participation in 
this study, the sponsor mus t also be contact[CONTACT_528361] a completed Pregnancy 
Form to the Galecto pharmacovigilance representative or designee (see Section 11.2). Every 
effort should be made to follow the pregnancy for the final pregnancy outcome.11.[ADDRESS_685908] Complaints or Medication Errors (Including 
Overdose)
A product complaint is a verbal, written, or electronic expression that implies di ssatisfaction 
regarding the identity, strength, purity, quality, or stability of a drug product.  Individuals who 
identify a potential product complaint situation should immediately report this via the phone 
numbers or e -mail addresses provided below.
A me dication error is a preventable event that involves an identifiable subject and that leads to 
inappropriate medication use, which may result in subject harm. Whereas overdoses and 
underdoses constitute medication errors, doses missed inadvertently by a sub ject do not. 
Individuals who identify a potential medication error (including overdose) situation should 
immediately report this via the phone numbers or e -mail addresses provided in Section 11.2.1.
Product complaints in and of themselves are not AEs.  If a product complaint results in an SAE, 
an SAE form should be completed and sent to IQVIA (refer to Section 11.2).
Safety Reporting to Investigators, IRBs or IECs, and Regulatory Authorities
A designated CRO will be responsible for reporting all suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) an d any other applicable SAEs to regulatory authorities, including the 
European Medicines Agency (EMA) ,investigators and IRBs or IECs, as applicable, in 
accordance with national regulations in the countries where the study is conducted. Relative to 
the firs t awareness of the event by/or further provision to the sponsor or sponsor’s designee, 
S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be submitted to the regulatory authorities as an expedited report within [ADDRESS_685909]’s administration or in the overall conduct of the trial. The investigational sites 
will also forward a copy of all expedited reports to their IRB or IEC in accordance with national 
regulat ions.11.[ADDRESS_685910] (DS MB)
An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be implemented. Members of 
the D SMB selected and appointed by [CONTACT_528362], the sp onsor, or any other activity or entity that might affect their objectivity. The 
establishment and management of the D SMB isprescribed by a charter and provide sreports to 
the study team, sponsor, CRO. The minutes of all DSMB meetings will be stored in the Trial 
Master File (TMF).
The D SMB will continue to conduct regular review of the trial safety data, with the focus on the 
following safety information: 
• Death cases 
• Serious adverse events 
• Adverse events leading to withdrawal from study
The D SMB will recommend continuing , modifying or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_528282]. 
The D SMB iscommitted to meet and to make timely decisions. The D SMB will inform the 
coordinating Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_95917], the Sponsor, and the Trial team if any urgent de cision has 
to be implemented. 
Event Adjudication
Following study read -out, Galecto may decide to employ an independent adjudication panel to 
review, in a blinded manner, events reported in the study including but not limited to all cases of 
death (the pri mary cause of death )and reported acute IPF exacerbations (based on written 
clinical reports, for diagnostic confirmation). See Appendix 3 (Section 18.0)for a definition of 
acute exacerbation in IPF. 12.[ADDRESS_685911] KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_528283]. If selected for coding, AEs, PTEs, medical history, and concurrent conditions will be coded 
using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Drugs will be coded using 
the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary.
eCRFs 
The designated CRO will supply investigative sit es with access to eCRFs and will make 
arrangements to train appropriate site staff in the use of the eCRF. The data collection forms are 
used to transmit the information collected to ensure quality and performance of this study to the 
sponsor, CRO partners , and regulatory authorities. Investigative sites must complete eCRFs in 
English.
After completion of the entry process, computer logic checks will be run to identify items, such 
as inconsistent data, missing data, and questionable values. Queries may be i ssued by [CONTACT_528363]. Issues will be reconciled with Galecto.
Any change of, modification of, or addition to the data on the eCRFs should be made by [CONTACT_4180] . Corrections to eCRFs are recorded in an audit trail that 
captures the old information, the new information, identification of the person making the 
correction, the date the correction was made, and the reason for change.
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_528284] c ompleteness and accuracy and must sign 
and date the appropriate eCRFs as indicated. Furthermore, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_528285] .
eCRFs will be reviewed for comp leteness and acceptability at the study site during periodic 
visits by [CONTACT_1750]. The sponsor or its designee will be permitted to review the subject’s 
medical and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4077]. The 
completed eCRFs are the sole property of the sponsor and should not be made available in any 13.[ADDRESS_685912] Retention
The investigator agrees to keep the records stipulated in Section 13.1 and those documents that 
include (but are not limited to) the study -specific documents, the identification log of all 
participating subjects, medical records, temporary media such as thermal sensitive paper, all 
original signed and dated informed consent forms, subject authorization forms regarding the use 
of personal heal th information (if separate from the informed consent forms), electronic copy of 
eCRFs, including the audit trail, and detailed records of drug disposition to enable evaluations or 
audits from regulatory authorities, the sponsor or its designees. Any source documentation 
printed on degradable thermal sensitive paper should be photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_528286]’s chart to ensure long term legibility. Furthermore, International 
Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E6 Section 4.9.5 requires the investigator to retain essential 
documents specified in ICH E6 (Section 8) until at least [ADDRESS_685913] 2 years after the investigation is discontinued and regulatory 
authorities are notified. No study document is to be destroyed without prior written agreement 
between Sponsor and the Investigator. Should the Investigator wish to assign the study records to 
another party or move them to another location, he/she must notify the Sponsor in writing of the 
new responsible person and/or the new location.13.[ADDRESS_685914] been amended to focus on 
comparisons between GB0139 3mg and Placebo within the SoC2 strata (participants not 
currently treated with pi[INVESTIGATOR_16365]). All relevant subsections within this section 
have been amende d accordingly.
Statistical and Analytical Plans
A blinded data review will be conducted prior to database lock . This review will assess the 
accuracy and completeness of the study database, subject evaluability, and appropriateness of the 
planned statistica l methods.
A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be prepared and finalized prior to database lock . This 
document will provide further details regarding the definition of analysis variables and analysis 
methodology to address all study objectives.
For desc riptive statistics categorical data will be presented as frequencies and percentages. 
Percentages will be based on the number of subjects with non -missing values for the 
corresponding categorical variable. Continuous data will be presented as number of subjects with 
non-missing values, mean standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum, as well as the 
25thand 75thpercentile.
All statistical tests as well as the confidence intervals will be two -sided. The study -wise type I 
error probability for the confi rmatory analys es is set to 10%. 90% confidence intervals are to be 
calculated, if feasible.
Covariates for the primary analyses will be pre -specified. For secondary analyses these are 
anticipated to be broadly similar to primary analysis but will be fully specified in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP).
Statistical Hypothesis
The primary efficacy analys es arebased on data from SoC2 only.14.1

14.2.1 Primary efficacy endpoint s
The superiority of GB0139 3mg compared to Placebo (Plc) will be tested for the annual rate of 
decline in FVC in mL.
The null hypothes is is:
H0: There is no difference in the annual rate of decline in FVC in mL between GB0139
3mgand Plc .
The alternative hypotheses are:
Ha: There is a difference in the annual rate of decline in FVC in mL between GB0139
3mg and Plc.
14.2.2 Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:
The superiority of GB0139 3mg compared to Plc will be tested for the proportion of subjects 
with a decline ≤10% from baseline in predicted %FVC at week 52. The superiority of GB0139
3mg compared to Plc will be tested for the change from baseline in SGRQ total score at Week 
52.The superiority of GB0139 3mg compared to Plc will be tested for the time to first 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (an y respi[INVESTIGATOR_285551], including acute exacerbation of IPF) during treatment.
The superiority of GB0139 3mg compared to Plc will be tested for time to death from all causes 
from date of randomization where time to death will be death at any time up to Wee k 52.
Analysis Sets
The following analysis sets will be used in this trial
Intention -to-Treat (ITT) Analysis Dataset -this includes all randomized subjects
Modified Intention- to-Treat Analysis Dataset (mITT) -this includes all randomized 
subjects with at least one application of study drug , and will be grouped according to the 
treatment they were randomised to.
Safety Analysis Dataset -this includes all randomized subjects with at least one 
application of study drug , and will be grouped according to the t reatment they received.14.3
Galecto Biotech AB Page 59 of 105
GALACTIC -1 v7.1_[LOCATION_006] 28 January 2022
Per-Protocol Analysis Dataset -this includes a subset of the subjects in the ITT analysis 
set who complied with the protocol sufficiently to ensure that these data would be likely 
to represent the effects of study intervention according to the underlying scientific model 
(e.g., subje cts who took at least 80% of study intervention treatment for at least 80% of 
the initial 52 weeks).
Primary Efficacy Analysis
The primary efficacy analysis will be based on data from SoC2 only. 
14.4.1 Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint
The primary endpoint i s described in Section 9.1. The primary efficacy analysis is a random 
coefficient regression (random slopes and intercepts) model. Treatment andbaseline FVC (mL) 
will be included as a covariate in the analysis model. Other covariates such as age, and gender 
will be included as covariates unless their inclusion violates model assumptions or impacts 
stability. Baseline FVC is defined as the FVC result recorded at Visit w0/baseline, unless 
missing in which case the latest FVC before randomization in the subject’s chart result will be 
used.
The decrease in FVC is assumed to be linear within each subject over [ADDRESS_685915] -squares means; p- values and two -sided 90% confidence 
intervals for the difference between the treatment groups will be presented. An intent -to-treat 
principle will be used. Analyses will be implemented using SAS® Version 9.4 or higher. The 
assumptions for the primary analysis of decline in FVC will be tested; details will be provided in 
the SAP. The primary analysis will be based on observed data (but including retrieved drop out 14.4
Galecto Biotech AB Page 60of 105
GALACTIC -1 v7.1_[LOCATION_006] 28 January 2022
measurements) and will assume remaining missing data are missing at random. The effect of 
missing data will be investi gated using multiple imputation methods which assume that subjects 
who discontinue treatment will no longer benefit from it in the future. See Section 14.8 for 
further details of these sensitivity analyses . 
Subgroup analyses will be fully specified in the SAP and will include: 
•Age
•Gender
•Race
•Ethnicity
•Previous treatment with pi[INVESTIGATOR_331329]/or nintedanib
•Recruitment cohort (e .

A cumulative distribution plot will be provided, showing the percentage of subjects by [CONTACT_528364] 52. 
Data will be summarized graphically and using summar y statistics.
14.4.2 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints 
For all secondary endpoints, an intent -to-treat principle will be used.
[IP_ADDRESS] Key Secondary Endpoints
The key secondary analysis will be based on data from SoC2 only. Data will be summarized 
graphically and using su mmary statistics. The multiplicity procedure used for the key secondary 
endpoints will be detailed in the SAP.

GALACTIC -1 v7.1_[LOCATION_006] 28 January 2022
Comparisons between treatment groups regarding the binary endpoint variable based on an 
absolute decline from baseline in FVC % pred
icted of ≤10% will be performed using a logistic 
regression model. Treatment and baseline FVC (mL) will be included in the model along with 
any other covariates included in the analysis of the primary endpoint . The likelihood- ratio test 
will be used to test for diff erences between treatments. Odds ratios together with 9 0% confidence 
intervals will be used to quantify the effect of treatment, comparing GB0139 3mgto placebo as 
the reference.
The change from baseline in the SGRQ total score at Week [ADDRESS_685916] hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ( respi[INVESTIGATOR_285551], including acute exacerbation of IPF) will be 
analysed using a Cox proportional hazards model with covariates treatment, baseline FVC (mL) 
along with any other covariates included in the analysis of the primary endpoint . The equality of 
the hazard rates between the GB0139 3mgand placeb o group will be tested by [CONTACT_528365]. The model will include treatment as covariates. Breslow’s method for 
handling ties will be used. Kaplan -Meier plots by [CONTACT_528366]. 
Time to death from all causes (plus death from respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]- related causes if numbers allow ) will 
be analysed using a Cox proportional hazards model. The equality of the hazard rates between 
the GB0139 3mggroup and placebo will be tested by [CONTACT_528367]. The 
model will include treatment, baseline FVC (mL) as covariates along with any other covariates 
included in the analysis of the primary endpoint . Breslow’s method for handling ties will be 
used. Kaplan- Meier plots by [CONTACT_528366]. I f the proportion of deaths is 
less than 5%, then only frequencies of deaths by [CONTACT_528368].

[IP_ADDRESS] Other Secondary Endpoints
All further endpoi nt analyses will be considered exploratory in nature. 
Data will be summarized graphically and using summary statistics. 
Any p -values presented for the secondary endpoints will be considered nominal in nature and no

Further details are given in the SAP.
Secondary Efficacy Analysis
Secondary efficacy analysis of subgroups will be based on :
Strata (i .e.analysing available data from SoC1)
Previous treatment with pi[INVESTIGATOR_331329]/or nintedanib
Cohort ( e.g.pre-or post -DSMB cutoff, and pre -or post -Protocol version 6. 1_[LOCATION_006])
The same endpoints as for the primary and key secondary efficacy analysis will be analysed in an 
exploratory manner with the same methods as described for the primary efficacy analysis. No 
formal statistical hypotheses will be tested.
14.5.[ADDRESS_685917] 52 weeks of the study. In addition, selected safety analyses will be 
repeated to include data collected beyond 52 weeks; further details will be specified in the SAP. 
All treated subjects will be included in the safety analysis. The primary safety assessment will be 
based on the participants who received 3mg or placebo as study treatments.  A sep arate safety 
assessment will be made for the participants who received study treatment in combination of 
nintedanib or pi[INVESTIGATOR_528287]. The particular tables and figures to be split in this way will be 
specified in the SAP. In general, safety analyses will be descriptive in nature. No hypothesis 
testing is planned. 
Kaplan -Meier plots will be produced for the time to premature treatment discontinuation. 
Statistical analysis and reporting of adverse events will concentrate on treatment -
emergent 
adverse events. A ll adverse events occurring between start of treatment and end of the residual 
effect period will be considered ‘treatment -emergent’. The residual effect period is defined as the 
[ADDRESS_685918] 
drug intake and deteriorate under treatment will also be considered ‘treatment -emergent’. 
Frequency, severity, and causal relationship of adverse events will be tabulated by [CONTACT_528369] g to the current version of MedDRA. 
Laboratory data will be analysed both quantitatively as well as qualitatively. The latter will be 
done via comparison of laboratory data to their reference ranges. Values outside the reference 
range as well as values de fined as clinically relevant will be highlighted in the listings. Treatment 
groups will be compared descriptively with regard to distribution parameters as well as with 
regard to frequency and percentage of subjects with abnormal values or clinically relev ant 
abnormal values. 
Vital signs, physical examinations, or other safety -relevant data observed at screening, baseline, 
during the course of the treatment and at the end -of-treatment evaluation will be assessed with 
regard to possible changes compared to findings before start of treatment.

Determination of Sample Size
The null hypothes is for the treatment difference between GB0139 at 3mg and placebo for the 
two doses is tested using a type I error of 10% for a [ADDRESS_685919] (annual rate of decline in FVC or the 
FVC change from baseline to 52 weeks) is dependent on the effect size (mean treatment 
difference/ standard deviation) and the number of subjects per treatment grou p.
To detect an average difference from placebo in decline in FVC of at least [ADDRESS_685920] deviation of 240 ml then a final sample size of 141subjects would provide 75% power, 
assuming that future subjects are randomised into the study on a 1:[ADDRESS_685921] randomised to placebo 2 subjects will be randomised to 3 mg GB0139 .
Randomization
Following the Protocol version 6. 1_[LOCATION_006] participants will be randomised in blocks to double- blind 
treatment in a 1:2 ratio (Placebo : GB0139 3mg). The unbalanced randomisation is to maintain 
the same probability of allocation to placebo post -Protocol version 6. 1_[LOCATION_006] since this may 
impact participant enrolment. Note that prior to Protocol version 6. 1_[LOCATION_006] participants were
randomized in blocks to double -blind treatment in a 1:1:1 ratio ( GB0139 3mg: GB0139 10mg: 
Placebo) stratified by [CONTACT_190350] . 
The Sponsor will arrange for the randomization and the packaging and labelling of trial
medication. The randomization list will be generated using a validated system, which involves a 
pseudo -random number generator so that the resulting treatment will be both reproducible and 
non-predictable. The block size will be documented in the CTR. Acc ess to the codes will be 
controlled and documented.
Handling of Missing Data
This section describes the estimands approach for the primary analysis and associated sensitivity 
analyses using the Detailed Clinical Objectives framework described by [CONTACT_467671] [51].14.[ADDRESS_685922] value recorded in the trial when a patient dies.
Three specific inter -current events (ICEs) are anticipated during the trial: death, treatment 
discontinua tion, and initiation of pi[INVESTIGATOR_16365]. The handling of these ICEs for the 
treatment effect of primary interest and planned sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint are 
described in Table 5.

15.0 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
Study -Site Monitoring Visits
Monitoring visits to the study site will be done periodically during the study to ensure that all 
aspects of the protocol are followed, and according to the monitoring plan. Source documents 
will be reviewed for verification of data recorded on the eCRFs. Source documents are defined 
as original documents , data, and records. The investigator and institution guarantee access to 
source documents by [CONTACT_3552] (CRO) and by [CONTACT_4186].
All aspects of the study and its documentation will be subject to review by [CONTACT_98634] (as l ong as blinding is not jeopardized), including but not limited to the Investigator’s 
Binder, study medication, subject medical records, informed consent documentation, 
documentation of subject authorization to use personal health information (if separate f rom the 
informed consent forms), and review of eCRFs and associated source documents. It is important 
that the investigator and delegated study personnel are available during the monitoring visits and 
that sufficient time is devoted to the process.
Protoco l Deviations
The investigator should not deviate from the protocol, except where necessary to eliminate an 
immediate hazard to study subjects. Should other unexpected circumstances arise that will 
require deviation from protocol -specified procedures, the i nvestigator should consult with the 
sponsor or designee (and IRB or IEC, as required) to determine the appropriate course of action. 
There will be no exemptions (a prospectively approved deviation) from the inclusion or 
exclusion criteria.
The site must do cument all protocol deviations in the subject’s source documents. In the event of 
a significant deviation, the site must notify the sponsor or its designee (and IRB or EC, as 
required). Significant deviations include, but are not limited to, those that inv olve fraud or 
misconduct, increase the health risk to the subject, or confound interpretation of primary study 
assessment. Protocol Deviations are recorded by [CONTACT_2024]'s CRA in their clinical trial 15.1

management system. All recorded Protocol Deviations will be shared with the investigator in 
writing following each monitoring visit, and period reports will be made available as required for 
submission to the EC/IRB . Recorded Protocol Deviations will also be reviewed regularly with 
Galecto .
The investigator can de viate and change from the protocol for any medically unavoidable reason, 
for example, to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects, without a prior written 
agreement from the sponsor or a prior approval from IRB. In the event of a deviation or change , 
the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_528290] a written form, and then retain a copy of the written form. When 
necessary, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_528291] a protocol 
amendment. If the protocol amendment is appropriate, the amendment proposal should be 
submitted to the head of the site as soon as possible and an approval from IRB should be 
obtained.
The investigator must document all protocol deviations.
Quality Assurance Audits and Regulatory Agency Inspections
The study site also may be subject to quality assurance audits by [CONTACT_63222]. In this 
circumstance, the sponsor -designated auditor will contact [CONTACT_528370]. The auditor may ask to visit the facilities where laboratory 
samples are collected, where the medication is stored and prepared, and any other facility used 
during the study. In addition, there is th e possibility that this study may be inspected by 
[CONTACT_17513], including those of foreign governments (e.g., the FDA, the [LOCATION_008] 
Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency). If the study site is contact[CONTACT_528371] a reg ulatory body, the sponsor should be notified immediately. The investigator 
and institution guarantee access for quality assurance auditors to all study documents as 
described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]
Galecto Biotech AB Page [ADDRESS_685924] for the individual subjects (i.e., subjects) 
according to the protocol, the ethical principles that have their origin in the De claration of 
Helsinki, and the ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline for GCP. Each investigator will conduct 
the study according to applicable local or regional regulatory requirements and align his or her 
conduct in accordance with the “Responsibilities of the Investigator” that are listed in Section 
18.0. The principles of Helsinki are addressed through the protocol and through appendices 
containing requirements for in formed consent and investigator responsibilities.
IRB and/or IEC Approval
IRBs and IECs must be constituted according to the applicable requirements of each 
participating region. The sponsor or designee will require documentation noting all names and 
titles of members who make up the respective IRB or IEC. If any member of the IRB or IEC has 
direct participation in this study, written notification regarding his or her abstinence from voting 
must also be obtained. Those American sites unwilling to provide na mes and titles of all 
members due to privacy and conflict of interest concerns should instead provide a Federal Wide 
Assurance Number or comparable number assigned by [CONTACT_9930].
The sponsor or designee will supply relevant documents for submission to the respective IRB or 
IEC for the protocol’s review and approval. This protocol, the Investigator’s Brochure, a copy of 
the informed consent form, and, if applicable, subject recruitment materials and/or 
advertisements and othe r documents required by [CONTACT_1763], must be 
submitted to a central or local IRB or IEC for approval. The IRB’s or IEC’s written approval of 
the protocol and subject informed consent must be obtained and submitted to the sponsor or 
designee before commencement of the study (i.e., before shipment of the sponsor -supplied drug 
or study specific screening activity). The IRB or IEC approval must refer to the study by [CONTACT_87726], number, and version date; identify versions of oth er documents (e.g., informed 
consent form) reviewed; and state the approval date. Once the sponsor or designee has confirmed 16.[ADDRESS_685925] adhere to all requirements stipulated by [CONTACT_1765]. This may include 
notification to the IRB or IEC rega rding protocol amendments, updates to the informed consent 
form, recruitment materials intended for viewing by [CONTACT_1766], local safety reporting requirements, 
reports and updates regarding the ongoing review of the study at intervals specified by [CONTACT_528372], and submission of the investigator’s final status report to IRB or IEC. All 
IRB and IEC approvals and relevant documentation for these items must be provided to the 
sponsor or its designee.
Subject incentives should not exert undue influence for participation. Payments to subjects must 
be approved by [CONTACT_4197].
Subject Information, Informed Consent, and Subject Authorization
Written consent documents will embody the elements of informed consent as described in the 
Declarati on of Helsinki and the ICH Guidelines for GCP and will be in accordance with all 
applicable laws and regulations. The informed consent form describes the planned and permitted 
uses, transfers, and disclosures of the subject’s personal health information fo r purposes of 
conducting the study. The informed consent form further explains the nature of the study, its 
objectives, and potential risks and benefits, as well as the date informed consent is given. The 
informed consent form will detail the requirements of the subject and the fact that he or she is 
free to withdraw at any time without giving a reason and without prejudice to his or her further 
medical care.
The designated CRO s are responsible for the preparation, content, and IRB or IEC approval of 
the informed consent form. The informed consent form must be approved by [CONTACT_528373].16.[ADDRESS_685926]’s 
legally acceptable representative may provide such consent for the subject in accordance with 
applicable law s and regulations.
The subject, or the subject’s legally acceptable representative, must be given ample opportunity 
to: (1) inquire about details of the study and (2) decide whether or not to participate in the study. 
If the subject, or the subject’s legal ly acceptable representative, determines he or she will 
participate in the study, then the informed consent form must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_423], 
or the subject’s legally acceptable representative, at the time of consent and prior to the subject 
entering into the study. The subject or the subject’s legally acceptable representative should be 
instructed to sign using their legal names, not nicknames, using blue or black ballpoint ink. The 
investigator must also sign and date the informed consent form at the time of consent and prior to 
subject entering into the study; however, the sponsor may allow a designee of the investigator to 
sign to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_1289].
Once signed, the original informed consent form will be stored in the inv estigator’s site file. The 
investigator must document the date the subject signs the informed consent in the subject’s 
medical record. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_282714].
All revised informed consent forms must be revi ewed and signed by [CONTACT_39822]’s legally acceptable representative in the same manner as the original informed 
consent. The date the revised consent was obtained should be recorded in the subject’s medical 
record, and the subj ect should receive a copy of the revised informed consent form.
Galecto Biotech AB Page [ADDRESS_685927]’s right to protection 
against invasion of privacy. Throughout this study, a subject’s source da ta will only be linked to 
the sponsor’s clinical study database or documentation via a unique identification number. As 
permitted by [CONTACT_1763], limited subject attributes, such as sex, age, or

If there is powder left in the capsule:
• Close the inhaler.
• Repeat steps 6 to 9 (third inhalation)
Most people are able to empty the capsule with one or two inhalations, but a maximum of [ADDRESS_685935] all aspects of the clinical care of IPF patients including 
diagnosis and prognosis. The identification of serum biomarkers that are diagnostic for IPF would 
be helpful for both clinicians and patients, particularly in cases where a surgical lung biopsy had 
not been obtained or access to dedicated interstitial lung disease/IPF physicians is limited. 
Secondly, the discovery of peripheral blood biomarkers that reflect disease activity would allow 
for serial monitoring as well as an objective marker to assess treatment efficacy. Lastly, a 
biomarker that provides prognostic information about disease course and/or mortality would be 
valuable for both clinical care and future research study design.
In the context of Galactic -1 study a number of serum biomarkers will be explored:
These may includ ebut are not limited to YKL -40, PAI -1, PDGF -BB, MCP -1, CCL -18, KL -6, 
CA-125, CA -19, Gal-3and collagen neoepi[INVESTIGATOR_322]. Testing will be performed at time points 
indicated in the Time and Events Table.
Galectin - [ADDRESS_685936] widely studied member of the galectin protein family [ 1, 2].
Galectin- 3 is a mid-size protein (29 to 35 kDa) consisting of an N-terminal domain with tandem 
repeats of short amino acid segments (a total of approximately 120 amino acids) linked to a single 
C-terminal carbohydrate -recognition domain (CRD) of about [ADDRESS_685937] with 
carbohydrates, which involves the C-terminal domain, and with unglycosylated molecules, such 
as ce ll surface and extracellular receptors, which involves the N -terminal domain [ 3].
As other galectins, galectin -3 does not contain a signal sequence, therefore it is localized primarily 
in the cytoplasm, and occasionally, in the nucleus and mitochondria. Galectin- 3 is found in 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663], fibroblasts, dendritic cells and inflammatory cells. In addition, galectin- 3 can be 18.2
Galecto Biotech AB Page 84of 105
GALACTIC -1 v7.1_[LOCATION_006] 28 January 2022
secreted and function in extracellular space. It can form pentamers upon binding to multivalent 
carbohydrates, therefore it is capabl e of crosslinking glycans on the cell surface, and in this manner 
initiating transmembrane signaling events and affecting various cellular functions [ 4].
Galectin
-3 is known for its role in tumorigenesis and progression through regulating cell 
proliferation, apoptosis, cell adhesion, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. Expression of 
galectin -3 is modulated in many different cancers. Measurement of serum galectin -3 can be helpful 
in diagnosis and prognosis for specific cancer types, such as th yroid and prostate [ 5].
One of the more interesting and well characterized effects is the role of galectin -3 in the promotion 
of fibrosis. Fibrogenesis or scarring is a consequence of certain types of injury and inflammation, 
which are central pathophysiol ogical mechanisms in the development and progression to heart 
failure. Expression of galectin -3 is low in a healthy human heart; however, as heart failure 
progresses galectin -3 becomes significantly up-regulated. It is released by [CONTACT_528378], pericytes, myofibroblasts, and fibroblasts, 
which in response signal cellular proliferation and secretion of procollagen I. Procollagen I 
irreversibly crosslinks to form collagen and results in cardiac fibrosis [ 6 -10].
Involvement of galectin -
3 in fibrosis has also been demonstrated in liver [ 11] and kidney [ 12].
Inhibition of galectin -3 appears to prevent progression of fibrosis. Recent publications describe 
the tetrapeptide, N -acetyl -seryl -aspartyl -lysyl -proline ( Ac-SDKP) that causes inhibition of cardiac 
fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis. Ac-SDKP is a naturally occurring anti-
inflammatory and antifibrotic peptide that is hydrolyzed almost exclusively by [CONTACT_161221]-
converting enzyme (ACE), and plasma concentration of Ac-SDKP is increased substantially by 
[CONTACT_528379]. Rats overexpressing cardiac ACE have decreased Ac-SDKP concentration and 
increased fibrosis in heart tissue [13]. Other studies include galectin -[ADDRESS_685938] diagnostic and therapeutic implications.
Recently, the FDA has approved for market an assay manufactured by [CONTACT_528380], Inc. 
(Waltham, MA) for galectin -[ADDRESS_685939] risk assessment in patients with chronic 
heart failure [ 14]. BGM Galectin -[ADDRESS_685940] galectin -3. One rat monoclonal 
anti-mouse galectin -
3 antibody is coated onto the surface of wells as a capture antibody to bind 
galectin -3 molecules in samples, while the other mouse monoclonal anti-human galectin -3 
antibody is provided in solution and functions as the tracer antibody for detecting galectin -3 
molecules bound to the capture antibody [ 15].
Galectin
-3 results should be interpreted with caution. Levels may be increased in patients with 
certain forms of cancer, in other conditions associated with organ fibrosis, and in patient s with a 
history of therapeutic use of murine monoclonal antibodies (IgG) or fragments, or who have known 
autoimmune disorders. Additionally, specimens with high levels of gamma globulins (>2.5 g/dL) 
may cause false elevation in results.

KL-6/mucin 1 (MUC-1)
KL-6/mucin 1 (MUC-1) is a circulating glycoprotein belonging to the MUC-1 class and is
expressed on alveolar epi[INVESTIGATOR_528308]. KL-6 exerts antifibrotic and
antiapoptotic effects on lung fibroblasts [ 1]. KL-[ADDRESS_685946] in Japan, where it has been used to assess patients in the clinical routine [2]. Serum KL-6 shows good correlation with disease severity, although it does not discriminate 
between different ILD patterns. Serum levels of KL-6 are significantly elevated in IPF and are 
associated with increased mortality. A serum cut-off value of ⩾1000 U·mL −1 has been associated 
with poor prognosis [3]. The presence of the MUC1 568 adenosine to guanine polymorphism 
(rs4072037) has been found to influence serum KL-6 levels in Caucasian and Japanese subjects, and may need to be considered in the calculation of normal upper limits and cut-off values [ 4,5].

Appen dix 3. Definition of Acute Exacerbations in IPF
Acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_528311] a small minorit y of patients with IPF annually 
(approximately 5 –10%) [ 1-3]. These epi[INVESTIGATOR_528312], pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, or cardiac failure [ 4]. When a cause cannot 
be identified for the acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_528313], the term acute exacerbation of IPF has been used 
[3, 5-15]. It is presently unclear if acute exacerbation of IPF is simply a manifestation of an 
unidentified respi[INVESTIGATOR_474214] (such as pulmonary emboli, infection) contributing to an 
acute wor sening in a patient with IPF or represents an inherent acceleration in the 
pathobiological processes involved in IPF. 
Regarding the definition of AE in IPF, a revised "conceptual framework" was proposed by [CONTACT_528381] 2016 [ 16].
The2007 proposed definition of an "acute exacerbation" (AE) of IPF included all of the 
following:
A previous or concurrent diagnosis of IPF
Deterioration within 30 days
New bilateral ground glass opacities and/or consolidation on a background of 
reticular or honeycomb pattern consistent with usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP)
No evidence of pulmonary infection by [CONTACT_169344][INVESTIGATOR_528314]
Exclusion of alternative causes including left heart failure, pulmonary embolism, 
or an identifiable cause of acute lung injury
The [ADDRESS_685954] today's knowledge of AE -IPF and should allow 
for better insights into the etiology, treatment, and outcomes of this process [ 17]. Similar to the 
definition in 2007, this newly proposed framework defines an AE as " an acute, clinically 
significant respi[INVESTIGATOR_528315] 18.3
Galecto Biotech AB Page 95of 105
GALACTIC -1 v7.1_[LOCATION_006] 28 January 2022
abnormality ," but does not set an exact 30 day limit for symptom onset and does not require 
exclusion of infection. The following diagnostic criteria are proposed:
A known diagnosis of IPF (diagnosis may be made at the time of acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_528316])
Acute worsening, "typi[INVESTIGATOR_528317]'s duration"
Computed tomography of the ches t with new bilateral ground glass opacification 
and/or consolidation superimposed on a background of findings consistent with 
usual interstitial pneumonia (bibasilar reticular opacities associated with 
honeycomb changes and traction bronchiectasis) 
Heart failure or fluid overload does not fully explain the worsening.
Based on our understanding that these events may be triggered similar to acute lung injury in the 
non-IPF patient population, events are further classified into "triggered" (ie, postprocedure, drug 
toxicity, infection, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]) versus "idiopathic" (ie, no inciting event identified). This new 
classification will allow for a more complete pi[INVESTIGATOR_528318].
Pathophysiology and risk factors -While our current understanding of the patho physiology of 
AE-IPF is limited, AE has clinical similarities to acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS). 
Both have increased oxygen needs, bilateral ground glass opacities and/or consolidation on 
imaging, and histopathology demonstrating diffuse alveol ar damage [ 19-22]. It is known that 
there are multiple causes for ARDS and it is likely the same for those with AE -IPF. Further, IPF 
patients likely have maladaptive responses to lung injury, demonstrated by [CONTACT_528382] [ 23, 
24]. 
There are multiple examples of lung injury that subsequently develop into an AE -IPF [ 25-28]. 
Microaspi[INVESTIGATOR_152211] –Microaspi[INVESTIGATOR_528319] a 
proposed risk factor for exacerbations and progression of IPF, based on a meta -
analysis of clinical trials that demonstrated patients who received treatment for

gastric reflux had slower decline of forced vital capacity (FVC), alt hough there 
was no difference in mortality [ 29].
Surgery and thoracic procedures –Thoracic procedures, such as surgical lung 
biopsy, lung cancer resection, and bronchoscopy, have been associated with the 
development of IPF exacerbations [30 -34]. Nonthorac ic surgical procedures have 
also been implicated in development of exacerbations [ 33]. Potential mechanisms 
include administration of high concentrations of oxygen and volutrauma or 
barotrauma during mechanical ventilation. However, a causal relationship 
between IPF exacerbations and procedures is difficult to ascertain due to the 
retrospective analysis of the studies. 
Advanced lung disease –Clinical factors of physiologically advanced IPF are 
associated with increased rates of AE, including: lower FVC, d iffusing capacity 
of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO), and six -minute walk distance [ 27, 
35, 
36]. 
Other –A number of other potential contributors have been implicated, such as 
evidence of pulmonary hypertension, higher body mass index, coronary artery
disease, and treatment with immunosuppressive therapy [ 36-38].
Clinical manifestations - In patients with IPF, an acute exacerbation typi[INVESTIGATOR_528320], but 
generally less than one month [ 17,39]. In a small series of 11 patients, the time from onset of 
symptoms to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_528321] 13 days [ 18]. Cough (with or without 
sputum production) is common; fever and flu -like symptoms may also be present.
On physical examination, the patient may be tachypneic and will typi[INVESTIGATOR_528322].
Galecto Biotech AB Page 97of 105
GALACTIC -1 v7.1_[LOCATION_006] 28 January 2022
Patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_528323], as evidenced by [CONTACT_528383] n of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_218687] (PaO 2/FiO 2) of less than 225 mmHg or a decrease in the PaO 2 
of 10 mmHg or more from baseline.
High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) reveals bilateral ground glass or consolidative 
opacities superimposed on a background of typi[INVESTIGATOR_528324] (eg, bibasilar reticular 
opacities, honeycomb changes, traction bronchiectasis).
Diagnosis -The diagnosis of AE -IPF is generally made in a patient with known or concurrently 
diagnosed IPF and the following featur es [17]:
An acute, clinically significant respi[INVESTIGATOR_528325] <1 month in 
duration
High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) demonstrating new bilateral 
ground glass opacification and/or consolidation superimposed on a background of 
findin gs consistent with usual interstitial pneumonia
Exclusion of heart failure and fluid overload as significant contributors to the 
deterioration
Flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is used to identify infectious agents 
and exclude maligna ncy. While the 2007 criteria for AE
-IPF required the exclusion of infection, 
the 2016 criteria do not exclude potential triggers, such as infection, lung procedures/operations, 
drug toxicity, and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] [ 16, 17]. These potential triggers should be note d, but do not 
exclude AE -IPF.
DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS —The differential diagnosis of AE -IPF includes venous 
thromboembolism, infection, and heart failure. A pneumothorax can complicate IPF, but would 
usually be recognized on a conventional chest radiograph. Pulmonary hypertension developi[INVESTIGATOR_528326] a consequence of IPF is also in the differential diagnosis of worsening dyspnea, but would not 
have the new radiographic opacities associated with AE- IPF.

GALACTIC -1 v7.1_[LOCATION_006] 28 January 2022
Venous thromboembolism –IPF is associated with a significantl y increased risk 
of venous thromboembolism (VTE) [ 40-42]. The suspi[INVESTIGATOR_528327], immobilization, malignancy, and prior or family history 
of VTE. 
Infection –For patients who can tolerate the procedure, our standard pr actice is to 
perform a full investigation for potential lung infection and to initiate empi[INVESTIGATOR_528328], as described. The choice of 
antibiotics for community -acquired pneumonia is described separately. 
Heart failure – Given the average age of individuals with IPF, careful cardiac 
assessment for heart failure or myocardial infarction is appropriate. We typi[INVESTIGATOR_528329], brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and an 
electrocardiogram. An echocardiogra m is not typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a first line assessment, but 
may be useful to evaluate for heart failure in a subset of patients, such as those 
with extrathoracic clinical features of heart failure or an elevated BNP. 
Pulmonary hypertension –Pulmonary hypertension (g roup 3), a well -known 
complication of IPF, also presents with worsening dyspnea, but without increased 
radiographic opacities. The diagnosis is often suspected in patients with 
worsening gas transfer without evidence of worsening interstitial lung disease.
Plasma BNP is often increased, and Doppler echocardiography can provide an 
estimate of pulmonary artery systolic pressure. A firm diagnosis requires right 
heart catheterization.

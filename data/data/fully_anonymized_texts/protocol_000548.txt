A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_637494] (UA) as a Countermeasure To 
Myopenia and Insulin Resistance in Chronic SCI 
3. Objectives
To address the need for an agent that maintains muscle mass and attenuates IR 
after SCI, we propose a ‘first-in-humans with SCI’ pi[INVESTIGATOR_637496] a countermeasure to sarcopenia and IR. 
Aim 1 
•To explore effects of UA administration on upper extremity lean mass and peak 
strength in persons with paraplegia.
Aim 2 
•To test effects of UA administration in sedentary individuals with tetraplegia on 
whole body resting insulin sensitivity, glucose/insulin/inflammatory responses to 
an oral glucose challenge (OGTT), and whole-body lean mass.
4. Study Endpoints
Primary Outcome Measure(s):
1. Change in Muscle Mass Using Dual X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA)

2. Change in Peak Isokinetic Strength

dependent myopenia – i.e., clinically relevant muscle wasting – which is 
commonly observed following spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828] (SCI), and ultimately 
compromises post-SCI function, metabolism, body composition, and health.  
Adjustments to body composition that accompany SCI-related myopenia include 
a decline of metabolically active muscle mass accompanying the loss of actively 
contracting muscle, which reduces whole body caloric expenditure and establishes

to cardioendocrine disease clusters, that include insulin resistance (IR).[ADDRESS_852080] injured 
(SCI) individuals to maintain health and function throughout their lifespans. Left 
unresolved we can expect earlier functional decline and cardioendocrine 
morbidity in the SCI population. These risks also project onto the caregivers of 
those with SCI, who are also “living with an SCI” in the contemporary medical 
environment and are also struggling to recover from the COVID-[ADDRESS_852081] been extensively characterized in 
humans with SCI.5 Rapid loss of sublesional muscle mass is explained by a 48% 
reduction of cross-sectional muscle area occurring as early as 6-weeks following 
injury. Atrophy ranging from 30-60% of total body lean mass has also been 
reported, the extent of loss depending on the muscle-specific phenotype and both 
duration and severity of impairment. (Figure 1.) This muscle atrophy is 
accompanied by [CONTACT_637514]-type transformation from a slow-oxidative 
(Type I) to fast-glycolytic (Type II) myosin heavy-chain phenotype, with both 
Type I and II fiber atrophy contributing to overall muscular wasting. This shift in 
muscle phenotype also has known linkage with insulin resistance and progression 
of cardioendocrine medical complications.  Unfortunately, the maintenance or 
restoration of muscle mass and myosin phenotype following SCI has yet to be 
achieved by [CONTACT_637515]-stimulated contractions of muscles 
located below the lesion level. Attempts to do so have also been dealt a significant 
blow by [CONTACT_15747]-year COVID-[ADDRESS_852082] challenged the ability of persons with 
SCI to preserve levels of fitness needed to sustain essential daily functions, and 
also offset their prevalent cardiometabolic disease (CMD) risks. These health 
risks are accompanied by [CONTACT_637516]-pandemic social reintegration, as 
fears of respi[INVESTIGATOR_637497], and in all 
expectation, will do so well into the future.
Cardiometabolic Pathology and Insulin Resistance
The loss of muscle mass after SCI has been associated with hastened trajectories 
pf all-cause cardiovascular diseases (CVD), which have emerged within the past 
decade as significant sources of morbidity and mortality for persons with spi[INVESTIGATOR_637498] (SCI).[ADDRESS_852083] for cardiometabolic diseases (CMD), a 
clustering of interrelated prothrombotic and proinflammatory factors that confers 
health risks that are equivalent to either coronary artery disease or diabetes. 
-       Study #: 20221142        Effective Date: 5/2/2025
Page 6 of 22Protocol version 2.1 – Revised 05/01/2025Notably, these risk equivalents may be experienced without actually having 
coronary disease or a clinical diagnosis of diabetes, making their occurrence an 
insidious health threat in need of focused early management.[ADDRESS_852084]-SCI Myopenia and Insulin Resistance 
Ursolic Acid – naturally occurring triterpene compound – is an herbal-like isolate 
obtained from the leaves of various plants (rosemary, marjoram, lavender, thyme, 
and organum), fruits (apple fruit peel), and berries. UA modulates several 
signaling pathways associated with the development of chronic diseases. Among 
confirmed benefits of UA administration are anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-
obesity, anti-diabetic, cardioprotective, anti-skeletal muscle atrophy, and 
thermogenic effects. The mechanisms by [CONTACT_637517], as well as atrophy 
and metabolic signaling in skeletal muscles through the mTOR signaling

Recent evidence suggests that the UA has beneficial effects on insulin resistance 
(IR) and related CMD health risks in persons without SCI, and also slows muscle 
wasting in instances of musculoskeletal disuse.[ADDRESS_852085] of SCI 
on physical and functional measures, and whether UA-promoted signaling in 
muscle translated to improvements in these outcome measures. When examining 
effects of UA treatment on sublesional muscle mTOR signaling, catabolic genes, 
and functional deficits following severe SCI in mice we observed  that UA 
treatment significantly attenuated SCI-induced decreases in activated forms of 
mTOR, and signaling intermediates PI3K, AKT, and S6K, and the upregulation of 
catabolic genes including FOXO1, MAFbx, MURF-1, and PSMD11. In addition, 
UA treatment improved SCI-induced deficits in body and sublesional muscle 
mass, as well as functional outcomes related to muscle function, motor 
coordination, and strength.

therapeutic strategy to improve muscle specific pathological consequences of SCI.

Page 11 of 22Protocol version 2.1 – Revised 05/01/2025Lunar Prodigy Advance scanner (GE Lunar Inc., Madison, WI,[LOCATION_003]). Transfer to 
the DXA scanner will be performed using either a ceiling lift or assisted self-
transfer with or without sliding board. Participants will be instructed to take off 
any metal, void their bladder, and dress in light clothes prior to transfer to the 
DXA table. Using the NHANES scanning method, both knees will be bound 
together using a large Velcro strap. Above the knee joints and each leg is placed 
in neutral position with the great toe facing upwards. Because of the difficulty in 
keepi[INVESTIGATOR_637500], arms 
will be strapped near the body in the mid-prone position to ensure the total body 
is within the scanning field. The standard mode scan will be used with a radiation 
dose of 0.4 µGy. Scans are performed and analyzed by a certified DXA operator 
using current Lunar software. As part of quality assurance, the DXA scanner will 
be calibrated using a quality control phantom (L: 197.7, W: 60.1) according to the 
manufacturer guidelines for both short-term and long-term precision studies.
Non-contrast CT images (Structure)*
Computed tomography (CT) is a radiographic method that produces thin cross-
sectional high-resolution images that may better differentiate and measure 
volumes of fat and lean tissue when compared to DXA. For this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], chest, 
abdominal and upper extremity/arm scans will be performed at UM/Sylvester 
Department of Radiology; these will be obtained pre- and post-intervention using 
a 128-slice multi-dimensional whole-body scanner before and after the 
intervention. Before the scan, subjects will have their upper extremities ranged. 
Images for upper extremities will be attained from the glenohumeral joint to the 
hand. All images will be analyzed at a separate workstation using TeraRecon 
iNtuition imaging software. 
Images are automatically segmented into adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and 
bone/background based on location and their attenuation properties, with adipose 
having the lowest attenuation and bone/background having the highest attenuation. 
A CT attenuation range of -120 to -40 Hounsfield units (HU) will be used to 
encompass abdominopelvic adipose tissue, -190 to -30 HU will be used for intra 
muscular fat (IMF), and -29 to +150 HU will be used for skeletal muscle (needed 
for  IMF quantification). Cross-sectional area (CSA; cm2) will be automatically 
calculated by [CONTACT_637525][INVESTIGATOR_637501], while volume (cm3) 
computed by [CONTACT_637526]-slice 
space. Visual distinction will be used to determine visceral adipose tissue (VAT), 
subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), muscle and bone based on the anatomical 
locations of the tissues and CSA and volumes will be summed together from 
consecutive slices. Total VAT mass and total SAT mass (in grams) will be the 
product of the total volume and fat density (0.9196 g/cm3). To account for muscle 
size, IMF CSA will be normalized to muscle CSA. The volume of IMF will be 
calculated as described above. All CT scans will be reviewed by a Radiologist.  
Subjects will be informed of any incidental abnormalities detected in the CT scans 
performed for this study and they will be referred to an appropriate provider. In

will be included in the scan. It will also be reviewed for incidental findings. 
*Total effective dose of radiation for DXA and CT scans (total pre and post) is 
expected to be around 22 mSv (millisievert) or around [ADDRESS_852092]. 
Under antiseptic conditions, a 21-gauge Teflon catheter (Jelco) with multi-sample 
Luer connector will be inserted in a superficial arm vein by a State of [LOCATION_012] 
Certified Phlebotomist. The catheter is kept patent with sterile physiological 
(0.9%) saline. Blood samples obtained at rest and during the OGTT (taken at 30-
minute intervals for two hours) will be collected in NaF (glycolysis), clot lysis 
activator (serum), and citrated Vacutainer tubes, and then centrifuged at 8,000g 
for 30 minutes to isolate the serum. These isolates will be tested on a [COMPANY_002] Mira-
Cobas Automated Chemistry Analyzer ([COMPANY_002] Diagnostic Systems, Basel, 
Switzerland), as we have described.
Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)
Baseline blood sample will be drawn (see to blood analyte for procedure details) 
after an overnight fast. Subjects will them be given Trutol glucose solution that 
contains seventy five (75) grams of glucose, similar in taste to a very sweet soda 
(usually orange flavor). Subjects will be instructed to complete ingestion within 
five (5) minutes. 
After drinking the Trutol, blood will be drawn at exactly [ADDRESS_852093] refrain from eating/drinking anything other than water for the 
duration of the test, approximately 2.5 hours.
Insulin Resistance
Insulin resistance will be computed using the Homeostatic Model of Mathews 
(HOMA; computer version v.2: 
[https://www.dtu.ox.ac.uk/homacalculator/download.php]) Criterion scores for 
normal, glucose intolerant, and insulin resistant were published by [CONTACT_637527], et al., 
Arch Phys Med Rehabil, 2016.
Strength 
Peak isokinetic forces generated during elbow flexion and elbow extension will 
be tested on a BiodexR dynamometer. Peak and average isokinetic forces will be 
tested through full range of flexion and extension.

personnel. However, coded information will be accessible to study 
personnel and may be provided to non-study personnel on a limited 
basis to gain assistance with data entry, management, analyses, and 
interpretation.
•Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects
oTo protect subject privacy, participant consent forms will be stored 
in a file that is separate from their source data. Records/source data 
(physical and electronic) will be identified by a numeric ID. 
Numerical code will be linked to participant names and contact 
[CONTACT_637531] a password protected electronic file solely accessible by [CONTACT_1600] [INVESTIGATOR_637507].  Linkage codes will be 
maintained until data analyses are completed. Once the data have 
been analyzed and published, the linkage codes will be destroyed.
13. Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of 
Subjects
-       Study #: 20221142        Effective Date: 5/2/2025
Page 16 of 22Protocol version 2.1 – Revised 05/01/2025•Participants will be screened and approved for study participation by a 
trained staff member at each center, ensuring compliance with study 
inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
•Testing will be performed at a medical-academic center that is located 
near an emergency room.
•Security personnel who staff the Lynn Rehabilitation Cen are “first 
responders” and will follow standing policies and procedures for 
emergencies in the Center.
•All study personnel at each center hold current CPR certificates.
•An Independent Medical Monitor will receive reports of AEs and SAEs, 
as well as semiannual reports in study progress. IMM reports will be 
included in annual continuing reports to the IRB.
•All phlebotomy will be performed by [CONTACT_637532] a current 
certificate in the appropriate jurisdiction.
•Emergency numbers are posted near all lab telephones. 
•All serious adverse events and adverse events will be reported to the IRB 
within the mandated period as follows:
oFor any adverse event, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_637508].
oAdverse events will be evaluated by [CONTACT_637533]:
▪Grade 1, Mild:  Awareness of symptom, but easily 
tolerated; usually transient requiring no special treatment; 
does not interfere with usual status or daily activities
▪Grade 2, Moderate:  Might be ameliorated by [CONTACT_11884]; may interfere with, but not keep the 
participant from performing usual daily care or 
participating in daily activities.
▪Grade 3: Incapacitating event, inability to perform usual 
activities
▪Grade 4, Life-threatening/Disabling:  Patient is at risk for 
death, or worsening disability or impairment as existed at 
the time of the event
•For the first two grades, the Investigators will observe the participant and 
as necessary institute standard medical or therapeutic care. Repeated 
occurrence of Grade 1 and 2 events may be cause for notification of the 
IRB by [CONTACT_637534]. The Investigators 
may take this action, and the IRB will be so notified.
-       Study #: 20221142        Effective Date: 5/2/2025
Page 17 of 22Protocol version 2.1 – Revised 05/01/2025•Grade 3 and 4 events will be individually evaluated. Any occurrence of 
Grade 3 and 4 events may be cause for notification of the IRB by [CONTACT_637535]. The investigators may take this 
action, and the IRB will be so notified. Upon  a determination that the 
(S)AE was related to the protocol, the study will stop and undergo 
evaluation for continuation. 
Withdrawal of Subjects
Subjects may withdraw from the study without prejudice to medical treatment at 
the center or involvement in future studies at the discretion of the PI. The ICF 
advises students and employees of the rights with respect to study withdrawal. We 
may end a subject’s participation in the study if s/he experiences adverse effects or 
in case of an incidental pregnancy.  Subjects who experience AEs (nausea, bloating, 
for example) will be referred to the Study Physician for appropriate medical care 
and will have their dose decreased by 25% (total dose of 300mg or 3 capsulse in 
the morning plus 3 capsules at night).  This lower dose has been reported to be 
efficacious and may help alleviate the AEs. If symptoms do not improve after 1-2 
days, subjects will be withdrawn from the study.  Subjects that become upset by 
[CONTACT_637536]. Compliance to UA dosing will be calculated monthly and 
subjects who fall below the 80% adherence threshold will be withdrawn from the 
study.

Page 18 of 22Protocol version 2.1 – Revised 05/01/2025Risks to Subjects
•Subjects may become upset by [CONTACT_637537]. 
•The risks of blood drawing include fainting, the occurrence of temporary 
discomfort and/or bruise at the site of puncture; rarely, infection or the 
formation of a small clot or swelling to the vein and surrounding area may 
occur. There may be slight discomfort in the arm or hand during the 
venipuncture. Occasionally, a small accumulation of blood (hematoma) 
may form at the point of insertion of the needle. This may result in a small 
lump that will disappear.  Occasionally, a small amount of bleeding may 
occur around the catheter site. On rare occasions, a local infection may 
occur around the venipuncture site.
•You may find yourself becoming hungry when you fast to have your blood 
drawn.
•Answering questions about your injury may make you feel nervous or 
upset. If you do not wish to answer a question, you can skip it and go to 
the next question.
•DXA scans may cause anxiety and additional radiation exposure. 
Radiation exposure is less than two weeks of natural background radiation 
or like the exposure during a round-trip cross-country flight. 
•CT Imaging may cause anxiety and an excess exposure to radiation.  
Exposure to low-levels of radiation does not cause immediate health 
effects, but can cause a small increase in the risk of cancer over a lifetime.  
•MIP procedure is non-invasive and relatively quick procedure.  Subjects 
may feel the need to cough or may feel short of breath during or after the 
test.  On rare occasions, subjects can become lightheaded.
•Muscle soreness from the exercise regimen that is part of this study is a 
possibility
•Ursolic Acid - naturally occurring triterpene compound - is an herbal-like 
isolate obtained from the leaves of various plants (rosemary, marjoram, 
lavender, thyme, and organum), fruits (apple fruit peel), and berries.  
Some of the common side outcome
oNausea
oStomach distention or bloating
oTrace quantities of blood within the urine
oSkin rash
Small safety studies indicate UA is tolerable with mild to moderate side effects 10, 11, 12
In addition to these risks, this research may hurt you in ways that we do not yet know

Page 6PROTOCOL SUMMARY
This prospective, open -label , non- comparative studywill assess the pharmacokinetics, safet y 
and efficacy  of Intravenous (IV) anidulafungin when used to treat children aged 1 month to 
<18 y ears with invasive candidiasis, including candidemia (ICC).
The primary  study  objective is to assess the safet y andtolerability  of anidulafungin when 
used to treat children with I CC.  Additional assessments will include global response at the 
end of IV therap y (EOIVT) and subsequent time points, exposure -response relationship, the 
rates of relapse (recurrence) and new infection at follow up (FU) visits, and anal ysis of time 
to death during study  therapy  and follow -up visits. 
A sub -study  to explore the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters in children aged 1 month to 
<2years will be performed on a limited number of subject s prior to complete enrollment of 
this age group in this study .
Indication:
Primary  therapy  of invasive candidiasis, including candidemia , in children between the ages 
of 1 month and <18 years.
Background and Rationale:
The incidence of s ystemic invasive f ungal infections has risen significantl y in the past 
decade.  Infections due to Candida spp. account for about 80% of all sy stemic fungal 
infections and are the fourth leading cause of all nosocomial bloodstream infections in the 
[LOCATION_002].[ADDRESS_716301] antation technology  and oncology  
treatment, spread of the Human Immunodeficiency  Virus (HIV), use of vascular catheters, 
and extensive administration o f broad -spectrum antibiotics.
In the [LOCATION_002], mortality  rates in children with candidemia approach 30%, depending 
on the specific subject population and clinical setting.2, 3Current approved treatments for 
infections due to Candida spp. include poly enes, azoles a nd echinocandin antifungal agents.  
Of these, amphotericin B and fluconazole are the most commonly  utilized in the paediatric
population. Guidelines for use of these agents in the paediatric population have often been 
extrapolated from adult studies.  
Anidulafungin is a member of the echinocandin class of antifungals and exhibits fungicidal 
activity  against Candida species.  In the [LOCATION_002], anidulafungin is approved for the 
treatment of 
candidemia and other forms of Candida infections (intra -abdomin al abscess and 
peritonitis) in adults .  In Canada and Europe, anidulafungin carries a similar indication and is 
approved for the treatment of invasive candidiasis/candidemia in adult non -neutropenic 
patients.  To date, there are no clinical studies evaluat ing anidulafungin in paediatric patient
s 
with invasive Candida infection.  This study will assess the pharmacokinetics, safet y and 
efficacy  of anidulafungin in patient s 1 month to <18 y ears of age with ICC .

Final Protocol Amendment 9, 16 September 2016
Page 7Exposure -response relationships of anidulafungin will also be assessed in a population 
pharmacokinetic -pharmacody namic (PK-PD)analy sis.
Anidulafungin is a semi -synthetic lipopeptide s ynthesized from a fermentation product of 
Aspergillus nidulans.  It  acts as a non -competitive inhibitor of (1, 3)-β-D-gl ucan s ynthase, an 
enzy me required for s ynthesis of the cell wall in many pathogenic fungi.  Suppression of cell 
wall glucan s ynthesis leads to osmotic instab ility and eventual cell death.
Anidulafungin is active in vitro against a number of important patho genic organisms, 
including Candida spp., Aspergillus spp., and Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly  P. carinii ).
Itis at least as potent as and often more potent than amphotericin B and fluconazole against 
Candida and Aspergillus spp. Activity  of anidulafung in against Candida spp. is fungicidal 
and has been demonstrated under a variet y of growth conditions.
In animal models, anidulafungin has cleared Candida from internal organs and mucosa and 
led to prolonged survival in lethal infections.  Anidulafungin dem onstrated efficacy  in studies 
in immunosuppressed and immunocompetent mice sy stemically  infected with C. albicans or 
C. glabrata (including fluconazole -and amphotericin B -resistant isolates), 
immunosuppressed rabbits with fluconazole -resistant esophageal and orophary ngeal 
candidiasis, and persistently  neutropenic rabbits with disseminated C . 
albicans candidiasis. 
Study Design
This prospective, open -label, non -comparative study will assess the safet y and efficacy  of 
anidulafungin when used to treat childre n between the ages of 1 month and <18 years with
invasive candidiasis, including candidemia (ICC).
To participate in this study, at the time of enrolment subject s must have either a confirmed 
diagnosis of I CC(based on the growth of Candida sp. from a cult ure obtained from a 
normally  sterile site within 96 hours prior to enrollment), or mycological evidence highl y 
suggestive of 
Candida sp. (eg, the growth of yeast in culture and/or the direct microscopic 
visualization of y east, h yphae or pseudoh yphae from a sample obtained from a normally  
sterile site within 96 hours prior to enrolment ).Subjects may  enroll and initiate study  
treatment prior to cu lture confirmation of Candida sp.  If culture confirmation is not 
obtained, subjects may remain in the study  and receive study  treatment at the discretion of 
the investigator.  Should the investigator choose to withdraw the subject from study  
treatment, the subject will discontinue study  treatment but will remain in the study  for 
continued safet y monito ringfor up t o [ADDRESS_716302] age group (1 month 
to < 2 years),the study  population is broadened only  in this age group to include children at 
risk for invas ive candidiasis. Thus, 
eligibility criteria have been modified in Amendment 9 to 
additionally  allow enrollment of infants ( aged 1 month -< 2 y ears)who do not have 
microbiologically  confirmed Candida but who are at high risk of c andidiasis, and for whom
the investigator considers antifun gal therap y with at least 5 day s of IV anidulafungin to be 
appropriate.

Final Protocol Amendment 9, [ADDRESS_716303] is to 
receive a loading dose of 3.0 mg/kg (not to exceed 200 mg).  Subject is then to receive a 
daily  maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg (not to exceed 100 mg) from Day [ADDRESS_716304] s
will be stratified by  [CONTACT_654] (1 month -<2 years, 2 - <5 years, and 5 -<18 years).  
Subject s with microbiologically  confirmed ICC may be switched to oral fluconazole (6 -12 
mg/kg/day , maximum 800 mg/day ) after at least 10 days of anidulafungin IV treatment, 
provided that the pre -specified criteria are met
.  Subjects will receive treatment (either solel y 
IV anidulafungin, or anidulafungin followed b y oral fluconazole) for a minimum duration of 
14days from the time of the last negative culture (defined as the second of two consecutive 
negative cultures, separated by  [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_716305] positive culture) and 
improvement of clinical signs and sy mptom sof candidemia or invasive candidiasis.  
Subjects without microbiologically  confirmed Candida infection will be treated with IV 
anidulafungin at the discretion of the investigator to a maximum of 35 day s.  Subjects may  be 
switc hed to oral fluconazole (6 -12mg/kg/day , maximum 800 mg/day ) after at least [ADDRESS_716306] day  of study  
treatment will be considered the End of Treatment (EOT). It is expected that the majority  of 
subjects will receive study drug in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]; subjects will be permitted to complete study  
medication on an outpatient ba sis if deemed appropriate by  [CONTACT_093].
(This paragraph, as well as all text herein related to subjects with Candida endocarditis and 
Candida osteomyelitis, is n ot applicable to Korean
and Portuguese investigator sites.)   In 
subject s with Candida endocarditis and Candida osteomy elitis who require continued 
treatment bey ond the maximum total treatment duration (4 9days), this treatment will be 
considered outside the context of this clinical trial and study  drug will not be supplied by  [CONTACT_429].  Fo r the purpose of study treatment evaluation, Day  35(for subjects who require
continued IV treatment) or Day  49(for subjects who required continued oral therapy ) will be 
considered the last day  of study  drug treatment.  These subjects are also required to return for 
the 2- week and 6- week follow -up visit following the last dose of study  drug.
All subject s will have the following assessments at the screening visit: phy sical examination, 
assessment of signs and sy mptoms of Candida infection, urine or serum pregnancy  test (for 
females of childbearin g potential), fundo scopic examination, blood cultures, specimen 
culture or histopathology of other normall y sterile sites (as clinicall y indicated), and safet y 
laboratory  testing.  If a positive culture is returned, repeat cultures are required at least every

Final Protocol Amendment 9, [ADDRESS_716308] s: either as monotherap y or in 
combination with a second sy stemic antifungal agent (eg, amphotericin B).  
In the event the investigator choses to administer anidulafungin as monotherap y for the 
treatment of invasive candidiasis/candidemia, treatment will be administered for a minimum 
duration of [ADDRESS_716309] negative culture (defined as the second of two 
consecutive negative cultures, separated b y at least [ADDRESS_716310] positive 
culture) and improvement of clinical signs and symptoms of candidemia or invasive 
candidiasis.  In the event the i nvestigator cho oses to administer anidulafungin in combination 
with a second antifungal agent, anidulaf ugin will be discontinued following the obtainment 
of required blood samples for pharmacokinetic analy sis as specified by  [CONTACT_760]; the data 
from these subjects will not be utilized for secondary  efficacy  endpoint analy ses but will be 
assessed for safe ty.  After the dosing regimen is confirmed by  [CONTACT_1034], enrollment will 
be opened to additional subjects within this age group at all investigator sites.  Subsequent to 
this time point, the use of a second s ystemic antifungal agent (eg, amphotericin B) will not be 
permitted in any  subject.
A population PK -PDanaly sis will also be performed in all other subject s enrolled and will 
include subjects <[ADDRESS_716311] cohort described above, in 
which 3 to 5 sparse pharmacokinet ic samples will be collected.
Efficacy  will be based on a determination of global response (combination of clinical and 
microbiological response) of success or failure at the EOIVT, EOT , 2-week FUand 6-
week 
FU visits. Rates of relapse (recurrence) and/or new infection will be assessed at the FU
visits.  Safety  will be evaluated through assessment of adverse events 
and monitoring of 
clinical laboratory  tests (hematology  and serum chemistry ), temperature, and phy sical 
examination results.  All subject s will be followed for safety  through the 6-week FU visit.  
The planned enrolment is approximatel y 60 evaluable subjects (those subjects who have 
received at least one dose of anidulafungin and have 
confirmed Candida infection) .
Objectives:
Primary
To assess the safet y and tolerability of anidulafungin when used to treat children with 
invasive candidiasis, including candidemia.
Secondary 
To assess the efficacy  of anidulafungin, as measured by  [CONTACT_547577], at the 
following time points: EOIVT, EOT, 2 -week FU visit and 6 -week FUvisit;

10.The ‘screening visit culture’ is the culture result that qualifies the subject with definitive diagnosis of ICC for study entry (along with other inclusion 
criteria) and is from a blood or tissue sample that was obtained w ithin 96 hours prior to the screening visit, that is positi ve for Candida sp.  The result 
of this culture will be re corded on the ‘screening visit” case report form.  In the event the culture result from this sample is pending, plan to record the 
culture result on the screening visit case report form once the organism has been identified and the information is available .  Please note: if the day of 
the screening visit is also Day 1 of treatment, a sample of blood for culture will be obtained; otherwise a sample of blood f or culture is not required 
until the first day of treatment (Day 1), just prior to administration of study drug.
11.A blood culture at the 2 -week and 6 -week follow -up visit is required only if clinically indicated. 
12.Cultures of other sterile sites will be collected as clinically indicated.  Pathogen isolated will be documented.
13.CBC with differential (includi ng RBC count , reticulocytes, white blood cells, neutrophils, lymphoctyes, monocytes, basophils, and platelet count), 
and serum chemistry tests (AST, ALT, Alk -Phos, total Bilirubin, Albumin, BUN or Urea , Cr, Bicarbonate, Glucose, Na, K, Ca, Cl, Mg) are to b e 
repeated on Day 3, [ADDRESS_716315] wa s already performed w ithin the previous 96 hours (of the screening visit) .  
The results of the echocardiogram, however, must be recorded in the case report form. (Not applicable to Korean and Portuguese investigator sites.)
16.For subjects w ith Candida endoca rditis, either a transesophogeal (prefer red) or transthoracic echocardiogram must be performed at the end of study 
treatment ( ie, at the end of treatment with IV anidulafungin, or at the end of treatment with oral fluconazole in subjects who are switc hed t o oral 
therapy).  Additional echocardiogram assessments, other than those required by [CONTACT_760], should also be performed as clinically indi cated and 
according to local practice standards.  In the event additional echocardiogram assessments are performe d, the results should be recorded on the case 
report form. (Not applicable to Korean and Portuguese investigator sites.)
17.A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study at the time of screening is not required if the test was already performed within th e previous 96 hours (of 
the screening visit) .  The results of the MRI, however, must be recorded in the case report form.   (Not applicable to Korean and Portuguese 
investigator sites.)
18.For subjects w ith Candida osteomyelitis, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study of the affected area must be performed at the end of study 
treatment (ie, at the end of treatment with IV anidulafungin, or at the end of treatment with oral fluconazole in subjects wh o are switched to oral 
therapy). Additional MRI studies, other than tho se required by [CONTACT_760], should also be performed as clinically indicated and according to local 
practice standards.  In the event additional MRI studies are performed, the results should be recorded on the case report for m.  (Not applicable to
Korean and Portuguese investigator sites.)
19.Prior to the administration of the first dose of study drug, a plasma sample (0.1 –0.2 mL) should be obtained.  Excess blood collected for safety 
laboratory testing may be used for this sample; otherwise it should be co llected directly from the subject.  Follow ing the initiation of study drug 
treatment s ix blood samples (0.3 –0.5mL each) will be collected for anidulafungin measurement at the following time points in the first 6 subjects:

Page 211.INTRODUCTION
On 17 February  2006, the US FDA approved intravenous ( IV)anidulafungin in adults for 
treatment of candidemia and other forms of Candida infections (intra -abdominal abscess and 
peritonitis) at a dose of 100 mg daily  (an initial loading dose of 200 mg), and for the 
treatment of esophageal candidiasis, at a dose of 50 mg daily  (an initial loading dose of
100mg).
On 26 September 2007, the European Union ( EU)European Medicines Agency  (EMEA )
approved IV anidulafungin in adult, non-
neutropenic patients for the treatment of invasi ve 
candidiasis, with a recommended dose of 100 mg (an initial loading dose of 200 mg).
On 14 November 2007, Health Canada approved IV anidulafungin for the treatment of 
invasi ve candidiasis/candidemia in adult non-neutropenic patients.
1.1.Indication
In this protocol, anidulafungin is being studied for treatment of invasive candidiasis, 
including candidemia , in children between the ages of 1 month and <18years.
1.2.Background and Rationale
The incidence of s ystemic invasive fungal infections has risen significantl y in the past 
decade.  Infections due to Candida spp. account for about 80% of all sy stemic fungal 
infections and are the fourth leading cause of all nosocomial bloodstream infections in the 
[LOCATION_002].1Theimpact of fungal infections on health care and economic expenditures is 
large and of growing concern.  Increases in infection rates are a consequence of growing 
numbers of at -risk patients due to advances in transplantation technology  and onco logy 
treatme nt, spread of the Human Immunodeficiency  Virus (HIV), use of vascular catheters, 
and extensive administration of broad -spectrum antibiotics.  
In the [LOCATION_002], mortality  rates in children with candidemia approach 30%, depending 
on the specific patient population and clinical setting.2, [ADDRESS_716324] Candida species.  In the [LOCATION_002], anidulafungin is approved for the 
treatment of candidemia and other forms of Candida infections (intra -abdominal abscess and 
peritonitis).  In Canada and Europe, anidulafungin carries a similar indication and is 
approved for the treatment of invasive candidiasis/candidemia in adult non -neutropenic 
patients.
To date, there are no clinical studie s evaluating anidulafungin in 
paediatric subjects with 
invasive Candida infection.  This study  will assess the pharmacokinetics, safet y and efficacy 
of anidulafungin in subjects 1 month to <18 years of age with ICC.  Exposure -response 
relationships of anidulafungin will also be assessed in a population 
pharmacokinetic -pharmacody namic (PK-PD) analy sis.

Page 22Additionally , due to the lack of excipi[INVESTIGATOR_547558]/response data of pol ysorbate 80 in very  
young children (eg, < 2 years of age), the P aediatric Committee (PDCO) at the European 
Medicines Agency  requested to measur e plasma levels of the excipi[INVESTIGATOR_547559] 80, a 
solubilizing agent contained in the intravenous (IV) formulation of anidulafungin.  Thus, 
pharmacokinetic s of polysorbate [ADDRESS_716325] of 
Aspergillus nidulans.  It  acts as a non -competitive inhibitor of (1,3) -β
-D-glucan s ynthase, an 
enzy me required for s ynthesis of the cell wall in many pathogenic fungi.  Suppression of cell 
wall gluc an synthesis leads to osmotic instability
 and eventual cell death.  
1.3.1. Pre-Clinical Data
Anidulafungin is active in vitro against a number of important pathogenic organisms, 
including Candida spp., Aspergillus spp., and Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly  P. carinii).  I t 
is at least as potent as and often more potent than amphotericin B and fluconazole against 
Candida and Aspergillus spp.  Activity  of anidulafungin against Candida spp is fungicidal 
and has been demonstrated under a variet y of growth conditions. 
In animal models, anidulafungin has cleared Candida from internal organs and mucosa and 
led to prolonged survival in lethal infections.  Anidulafungin demonstrated efficacy  in studies 
in immunosuppressed and immunocompetent mice sy stemically  infected with C. albicans or 
C. glabrata (including fluconazole -and amphotericin B -resistant isolates), 
immunosuppressed rabbits with fluconazole -resistant esophageal and orophary ngeal 
candidiasis, and persistently  neutropenic rabbits with disseminated C. albicans candidiasis.  
1.3.2. Clinical D ata
Clinical Pharmacology
Anidulafungin exhibits linear and predictable pharmacokinetics.  The pharmacokinetic 
profile of anidulafungin following I V administration is characterized by
 a short distribution 
half-life (t1/2,α) of 0.5- 1 hour, a predominant elimination half- life (t1/2,β) of approximatel y 
24hours that characterizes the majority  of the concentration- time profile, and a terminal 
elimination half -life (t1/2,γ) of [ADDRESS_716326] day  after a 
loading dose (twice the daily  maintenance dose).  Anidulafungin is extensively  bound to 
human plasma proteins (>99%).
Anidulafungin undergoes slow chemical degradation to produce a ring -opened peptide that 
lacks antifungal activity , which is subsequently  converted to peptidic degradants and 
eliminated in feces.  Anidulafungin has negligible renal clearance (<1%).  It is not a 
clinically  relevant substrate, inducer, or inhibitor of cy tochrome P450 enzy mes.  No 
clinically  relevant drug -drug interactions were observed when anidulafungin was 
co-administered with cy closporine, voriconazole, tacrolimus, amphotericin B or rifampin.  
Dose adjustments are not required for subject s with any  degree of hepatic or renal 
insufficiency , nor are they  required on the basis of age, gender, weight, ethnicity , disease 
status, or concomitant medications.

Page 23In the paediatric population, pharmacokinetic profiles were assessed in a Phase 1/2
multicenter, open -label, sequential dose -escalation study  (from 0.75 mg/kg/day  
to1.5mg/kg/d ay) of IV anidulafungin administered as earl y empi[INVESTIGATOR_547560]

(AUC 24), weight -normalized clearance ( CL), or weight -normalized stead y-state volume of 
distribution ( VSS).  The pharmacokinetic profiles on a weight- adjusted basis of 0.75 and 
1.5mg/kg/day  were similar to the profiles of anidulafungin administered to adults at dosages 
of 50 and 100 mg/day , respectively . 
The pharmacokinetics of anidulafungin have not yet been characterized in subject s less than 
2years of age.  Based upon prior studies and the pharmacokinetic properties of anidulafungin 
(eg, linear pharmacokinetics, minimal renal elimination and no hepatic metabolism), it is 
anticipated that the dose to be used in this age group will be the same as that of subject s aged 
2-
17years. In this study , the pharmacokinetics of anidulafungin will be studied in the first 
6subject s between 1 month to <[ADDRESS_716328] s, sparse pharmacokinetic samples will be collected to e xplore the 
relationship between anidulafungin exposure and response using a population PK-PD
analysis approach , including exploring the association between PK
-PD index (eg, 
AUC/minimum inhibitory concentration (MI C)) and efficacy  endpoints.  
Efficacy in Invasive Candidiasis, including Candidemia (Adults) 
Anidulafungin was compared to fluconazole in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3, double -blind, randomized 
study  ofsubject saged [ADDRESS_716329] s receiv ed either IV anidulafungin (200 -mg on Day 1 and 100 mg daily

could be switch ed to oral fluconazole (400 mg) after at least [ADDRESS_716331] s in the Intent to Treat(ITT)

primary  efficacy  anal ysis of global response ( ie, microbiologic and clinical r esponse) at the 
End of IV T herap y (EOIVT) 
in the Modified- ITT population, 75.6% of 
subject s randomized

Fewer anidulafungin -treated subject s (30 [22.9%]) than fluconazole -treated subject s 
(39[31.2%]) died during and shortly  after the study .  At almost all time points throughout the

3.STUDY DESIGN
This prospective, open -label, non -comparative study will assess the pharmacokinetics, safet y 
and efficacy  of anidulafungin when used to treat children between the age s of 1 month and 
<18years with invasive candidiasis, including candidemia (ICC).
To participate in this study, at the time of enrolment subjects must have either a confirmed 
diagnosis of I CC (based on the growth of Candida sp. from a culture obtained fr om a 
normally  sterile site within 96 hours prior to enrollment), or my cological evidence highl y 
suggestive of Candida sp. (eg, the growth of yeast in culture and/or the direct microscopic 
visualization of y east, h yphae or pseudoh yphae from a sample obtaine d from a normally  
sterile site within 96 hours prior to enrolment).  Subjects may  enroll and initiate study  
treatment prior to cu lture confirmation of Candida sp.  If culture confirmation is not 
obtained, subjects may remain in the study  and receive study  treatment at the discretion of 
the investigator.  Should the investigator choose to withdraw the subject from study  
treatment, the subject will discontinue study  treatment but will remain in the study  for 
continued safet y monitoring for up to [ADDRESS_716334] age group (1month 
to < 2 years),the study  population is broadened only  in this age group to include children at 
risk for invasive candidiasis . Thus, eligibility  criteria have been modified in Amendment 9 to 
additionally  allow enrollment of infants (aged 1 month -< 2 y ears) who do not have

(6-12mg/kg/day , maximum 800 mg/day ) after at least 10 days of IV anidulafungin 
treatment, provided that all of the following criteria are me t:
The subject is afebrile for at least 24 hours;
The subject is able to tolerate oral medication;
Documentation of two blood cultures negative for Candida spp separated by [CONTACT_2669] 
24hours;
Eradication or presumed eradication of Candida sp. from an y othe r sites of infection 
identified at enrollment;
The specific 
Candida isolate identified at study  entry  is susceptible (or presumed to 
be susceptible based on the species identified and local Candida sp. resistance 
patterns) to fluconazole; 
Signs and sy mpto ms of Candida infection have improved such that the Investigator

effective method of contraception consistentl y and correctly for the duration of the active 
treatment period and up to the [ADDRESS_716353] of contraception methods (see 
below) , and instruct the subject in its consistent and correct use.  Subjects need to affirm that 
they meet the criteria fo r correct use of at least 1of the selected methods of contraception.  
The investigator or his/her designee will discuss with the subject the need to use highly  
effective contraception consistently  and correctly  according to the schedule of activities and 
document such conversation in the subject’s chart.   The investigator or his or her designee , at

Highly  effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a 
failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently  and correctly  (ie,perfect use) and 
include:
1.Established use of oral, inserted, injected ,implanted or transdermal hormonal

Page 395.2.3. Administration
Anidulafungin will be administered intravenousl y at an infusion rate not exceeding 
1.1 mg/minute.  Anidulafungin loading dose of 3.0 mg/kg (not to exceed 200 mg) on the first 
day of treatment should be administered intravenously  at a rate of 1.1 mg/min or less, 
however the actual duration of infusion time should not exceed the calculated duration of 
infusion time (based on 1.1 mg/min) plus an additional 30 minutes. For example, for a child 
weighing 25 kg, the calculated duration of infusion time (based on a rate of 1.1 mg/min) 
would be 68 minutes, and maximum duration of infusion would be 98 minutes (68 minutes 
plus 30 minutes). 
Anidulafungin maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 1 00mg) on subsequent 
days should be administered intravenousl y at a rate of 1.1 mg/min or less, however the actual 
duration of infusion time should not exceed the calculated duration of infusion time (based 
on 1.1 mg/min) plus an additional 30 minutes. For example, for a child weighing 25 kg, the 
calculated duration of infusion time (based on a rate of 1.1 mg/min) would be 34 minutes, 
and maximum duration of infusion would be 64 minutes (34 minutes plus 30 minutes). 
** Important Note **  In subjects who a lready initiated on IV anidulafungin prior to 
study entry, a repeat loading dose is not required.  Instead, these subjects may be 
initiated on maintenance doses of IV anidulafungin.
5.2.4. Medication Errors 
Medication errors may  result, in this study , from the administration or consumption of the 
wrong drug, b y the wrong subject, at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength.  Such 
medication errors occurring to a study  participant are to be captured on the adverse event 
(AE) page of the CRFs and on the Seri ousAdver se Event ( SAE )form when appropriate.  In 
the event of medication dosing error, the sponsor should be notified immediately .
Medication errors are reportable irrespective of the presence of an associated AE/SAE, 
including:
Medication errors involving patient exposure to the product. 
Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do 
or do not involve the participating subject.
Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by  [CONTACT_1149], as determined by  [CONTACT_1275], the medication error and, if applicable, an y associated adverse event(s) is 
captured on an adverse event (AE) CRF page (refer to ADVERSE EVENT REPORTI NG

The investigator, or an approved representative, eg, pharmacist, will ensure that all 
investigational products are stored in a secured area, under re quired storage conditions and in 
accordance with applicable regulatory  requirements. 
Site sy stems must be capable of measuring and documenting (for example, via a log), at a 
minimum, daily  minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations (as 
applicable, including frozen, refrigerated and/or room temperature products).  This should be 
captured from the time of investigational product receipt throu ghout thestudy .  Even for 
continuous monitoring sy stems, a log or site procedure thatensures active daily  evaluation 
for excursions should be available.  The operation of the temperature monitoring device and 
storage unit (for example, refrigerator), as applicable, should be regularl y inspected to ensure 
it is maintained in working order.  
Any excursions from the product label storage conditions should be reported upon discovery . 
The site should activel y pursue options for returning the product to the st orage conditions as 
described in the labeling, as soon as possible.  Deviations from the storage requirements, 
including any  actions taken, must be documented and reported to the sponsor.  Once an 
excursion is identified, the investigational product must b e quarantined and not used until the 
sponsor provides documentation of permission to use the investigational product.  It will not 
be considered a protocol deviation if the sponsor approves the use of the investigational 
product after the temperature excur sion. Use of the investigational product prior to sponsor 
approval will be considered a protocol deviation.
Specific details regarding information the site should report for each excursio n will be 
provided to the site.

Record temperature (Note: Subjects receiving treatment in the outpatient setting may  
have less frequent as sessments, but not less than at least once every  7 day s.  Close 
monitoring of subjects treated in the outpatient setting is required); 
Record Adverse Events and Concomitant Medications ;
Cultures of other normally  sterile sites as clinically  indicated.
6.2.2. Days [ADDRESS_716366] s (first [ADDRESS_716367] s aged 1 month to

Prior to the administration of the first dose of study  drug, a plasma sample (0.1 – 0.2 mL) 
should be obtained and sent to the reference laboratory  to test for assay  interference.  Excess 
blood collected for safet y laboratory  testing may  be used for this sample, otherwise it should 
be collected directl y from the subject.
Pharmacokinetic sampling :Six (6) blood samples ( 0.3-0.5 ml each to provide 
0.1 – 0.2 mL plasma ) will be collected for anidulafungin measurement at the following time 
points: 
On Day 1: 2 minutes before the end of infusion ;

maintenance d ose of anidulafungin.  The flexibility  of the sampling time is also allowed as 
long as the actual time of collection is recorded in the CRF.
Ideally, the pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling would be taken from a different site/line than the 
one used for stud y drug infusion. However, at the discretion of the investigator and with 
appropriate flushing of the line to clear all drug residues, samples may be collected using the 
same line.
** Important Note **  For subjects in whom the investigator has chosen to administer 
anidulafungin in combination with a second antifungal agent, these subjects will be 
discontinued from treatment following completion of pharmacokinetic sampling but 
will remain in the study for continued safety assessments and are required to return for

Protocol Amendment 9, [ADDRESS_716379]’s 
chart and the Case Report Form (CRF).  I t will be particularl y important for I nvestigators to 
carefully monitor subjects for any  Adverse Events that could be related to the study  drug.  
Clinical assessments will include:
a.Complete phy sical examination: height, weight, general appearance and vital signs 
(systolic and diastolic blood pressure, temperature, pulse and respi[INVESTIGATOR_426441]); 
cardiovascular s ystem; abdomen and gastrointestinal sy stem; urinary  system; 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_36517]; and central nervous s ystem.  Other examinations may also be 
performed at the discretion of the Investigator.
b.Targeted ph ysical examination: this is a simplified abbreviated and focused phy sical 
exam relevant to the patient’s condition and progress as determined b y the 
Investigator and includes the vital signs.
c.Medical History : including (as appropriate) age, gender, medical history , surgical 
history , prior medications (only  antifungal agents w ithin 30 day s prior to enrolment) , 
adverse reactions to medications, and history  of hepatic, renal, or cardiovascular 
systems .
d.Signs and sy mptoms of Candida infection: The signs and sy mptoms of Candida
infection are diverse and dependent on disease severi ty, the site of infection and status 
of the host immune sy stem. Constitutional sy mptoms suggestive of sy stemic 
infection include fever and sepsis (eg, tach ycardia, hy potension). Infection of 
visceral organ(s) t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_547568] d ysfunction and m ay include radiologic 
findings demonstrative of singular or multiple microabscesses. The most frequently  
observed signs and s ymptoms of commonly  encountered forms of candidiasis are 
listed in the Case Report Form. However, the investigator is referred to the most 
recent clinical practice guidelines (published in March 2009), from the Infectious 
Diseases Societ y of America on the management of Candidiasis for comprehensive 
review of signs and s ymptoms associated with this disease .8
7.3.Global Response Determination
Efficacy  will be based on a determination of global response (combination of clinical and 
microbiological response) of success or failure at the EOIVT, EOT and FU visits.  Rates of 
relapse (recurrence) and /or new infection will be assessed at the FU visits.  These efficacy  
parameters will be derived in the anal ysis from the investigator’s assessment of clinical and 
microbiologic response, and are defined below.  
Global response, which will be derived from both investigator assessed clinical and 
microbiologic responses, will be defined as follows:
Success : Asubject will be categorized as a success if there is both a clinical success
(cure or improvement) and microbiological success (eradication or presumed 
eradication) ;

indeterminate) ;
Indeterminate : Asubject will be categorized as indeterminate if there is a clinical 
and/or microbiological response of indeterminate and neither response was a failure.

In addition, subject s will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] ( eg, in person, by [CONTACT_756], mail ,or e-mail) to 
determine survival status at 2- Week and 6- Week after EOT.  If a subject cannot be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], 
survival status may  be obtained through a family  member, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic records or 
information that is in the public domain.
7.5.Electrocardiogram (ECG)
After the ini tiation of the first dose of anidulafungin, if a ventricular arrh ythmia occurs and is
assessed b y the investigator as clinicall y significant, the investigator should collect a standard
12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) at that time.
The investigator or a des ignated person will determine the appropriateness of the ECG
recordings for interpretation. It may  be necessary  to repeat the ECG to obtain a readable
tracing, calibrate the machine, or rule out improper lead placement. A printout of the ECG
will be sent out to a central laboratory .
7.6.Fundoscopic Examinations
Fundoscopic exams should be performed with pupi[INVESTIGATOR_547556] .  In addition, when

of treatment and at the [ADDRESS_716381] one dose of stud y medication will be evaluated for safet y.  
Safety  will be assessed at each visit through phy sical examination, assessment of laboratory  
parameters and assessment of adverse events.  It will be particula rly important for 
investigators to carefully  monitor subjects for any  adverse events, including elevations in 
liver function tests,thatcould be related to anidulafungin.
7.8.Laboratory Assessments
7.8.1. Hematology and Blood Chemistry
The study  sites will process r outine hematolog y and blood chemistry specimens locally.
CBC with differential (H ematology  panel )will include: red blood cell count , 
reticulocy tes (absolute or percent), white blood cell count, neutrophils (absolute or

alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, albumin, glucose, calcium, magnesium. 
7.8.2. Echocardiogram (For Subjects with Candida Endocarditis) (This section is not 
applicable to Korean and Portuguese investigator sites.)
For subjects with Candida endocarditis, either a transesophogeal (prefer red) or transthoracic 
echocardiogram will be performed at the time of screening.  If, however, the test was already  
performed within the previous 96 hours (of the screening visit) , then an echocardiogram at 
the time of screening i s not required.  In this case, results of the echocardiogram used to 
support the initial diagnosis will be recorded in the case report form.
An echocardiogram will also be performed at the end of study  treatment (ie, at the end of 
treatment with IV anidula fungin, or at the end of treatment with oral fluconazole in subjects 
who are switched to oral therap y).  Results of the echocardiogram will be recorded on the 
appropriate case report form.
Additional echocardiogram assessments, other than those required b ythe protocol, should 
also be performed as clinically  indicated and according to local practice standards.  In the 
event additional echocardiogram assessments are performed, the results should be recorded 
on the case report form.

Page 587.8.5. Microbiol ogical Determinations
1.Screening Culture(s) :The ‘screening visit culture’ is the culture result that qualifies 
the subject with definitive diagnosis of ICC for study  entry  (along with other 
inclusion criteria) and is from a blood or tissue sample (obtained from a normally  
sterile) that was obtained within 96 hours prior to the screening visit, that is positive 
for Candida sp.  The result of this culture will be recorded on the ‘screening visit’ 
case report form.
In the event the subject is enrolled on the b asis of my cologic evidence suggestive of 
Candida infection (see Section 4.1, Inclusion Criteria) and the organism has not y et 
been identified, once the final identification has been determined the result will be 
recorded on the ‘screening visit’ case report form.
2.On-Study Blood Cultures: Blood cultures will be obtained on Day  1 (prior to the 
administration of the first dose) in all subjects .
a.If a positive culture is returned, repeat cultures ar e required at least every  [ADDRESS_716384] 24 hours, are confirmed 
to be negative while on study  medication .  Blood cultures will be obtained at 
the end of IV therap y (EOIVT), and at the end of oral therap y (in subjects 
switched to oral fluconazole).  For subjects who are prematurel y discontinued 
from treatment for an y reason, a blood sample for culture should be obtained 
only if it is clinically  indicated. A blood culture at the 2- week and 6-
week 
follow -up visit is required only  if clinicall y indicated.  
b.
For subjects without microbiologically confirmed ICC , further cultures will be 
obtained at the discretion of the investigator.  The results of the cultures 
should be recorded on the case report form.
c.Additional cu ltures bey ond those required b y the protocol may be obtained at 
any time at the investigator’s discretion, as clinically  indicated.  The results of 
the cultures should be recorded on the case report form.
3.Tissue Cultures : For subjects with microbiologicall y confirmed ICC whose 
screening cultures were obtained from sterile site samples (other than blood), follow -
up cultures from the same anatomical site should be repeated onl y as clinically 
indicated, otherwise they are not required.   For subjects without mi crobiologically 
confirmed ICC , cultures will be obtained as clinically  indicated at the discretion of the 
investigator.  The results of the cultures should be recorded on the case report form.
Investigators will send specimens (blood or other) to their lo cal certified laboratory  for 
culture (incubation should be a minimum of five day s if not positive before then).  Each 
laboratory  will follow its usual procedures for identification of the species and susceptibility  
testing to marketed agents.

Prior to the administration of the first dose of study  drug, a plasma sample (0.1 – 0.2 mL) 
should be obtained and sent to the reference laboratory  to test for assay  interference.  Excess 
blood coll ected for safet y laboratory  testing may  be used for this sample, otherwise it should 
be collected directl y from the subject.
Following initiation of treatment, blood samples (approximatel y 0.3 - 0.5 mL each) will be 
collected for anidulafungin measurement at the following 6 time points. 
On Day  1(receiving 3 mg/kg I V infusion): 2 minutes before the end of infusion;
On Day 2 (receiving 1.5 mg/kg IV infusion): Just prior to the start of infusion ;
2minutes before the end of infusion, 6, [ADDRESS_716386] ’s schedule.  For instance, if serial pharmacokinetic

An adverse event is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject 
administered a produc t or medical device; the event need not necessaril y have a causal 
relationship with the treatment or usage.  Examples of adverse events include but are not 
limited to:  
Abnormal test findings;
Clinically  significant symptoms and signs;
Changes in phy sical examination findings;
Hypersensitivity ;
Progression/worsening of underl ying disease ;
Drug abuse;
Drug dependency .
Additionally , they  may  include the signs or s ymptoms resulting from:
Drug overdose;
Drug withdrawal;
Drug misuse;

Exposure during pregnancy (EDP) ;
Exposure via breast feeding ;
Medication error ;
Occupational exposure
8.4.Abnormal Test Findings
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as 
an adverse event are as follo ws: 
Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms; and/or
Test result requires additional diagnostic testing o r medical/surgical intervention;
and/or
Test result leads to a change in study  dosing (outside of protocol- stipulated dose 
adjustments) or discontinuation from the study , significant additional concomitant 
drug treatment, or other therap y;and/or
Test result is considered to be an adverse event b y the investigator or sponsor.
Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the ab ove conditions, does not 
constitute an adverse event.  Any  abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does 
not require reporting as an adverse event.
8.5.Serious Adverse Events
A serious adverse event is any  untoward medical occurrence at any  dose that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity (substantial disruption of the 
ability  to cond uct normal life function);
Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect;

Page 63Lack of efficacy  in an approved indication should be reported as a serious adverse 
event;
Lack of efficacy  should be reported as an adverse event when it is associated with a 
serious adverse event.
Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical event.  An important medical event may  not be immediately  life-threatening and/or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  However, if it is deter mined that the event may  jeopardize 
the subject or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other adverse event outcomes, 
the important medical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.

Should an aggregate analysis indicate that these prespecified events occur mor e frequently  
than expected based on the expectation of frequency  of the event(s) in question in the 
population for comparison, eg, based on epi[INVESTIGATOR_75144], literature, or other data, then 
this will be submitted and reported in accordance with [COMPANY_007]’ s safet y reporting requirements.  
Aggregate anal ysis of safety  data will be performed on a regular basis per internal standard

8.5.2. Potential Cases of Drug- Induced Liver Injury
Abnormal values in aspartate transaminase (AST) and/or alani ne transaminase (ALT) levels 
concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria outlined 
below in the absence of other causes of liver injury are considered potential cases of drug -
induced liver injury  (potential Hy ’s Law c ases) and should alway s be considered important 
medical events.  
The threshold of laboratory  abnormalities for a potential case of drug- induced liver injury  
depends on the subject’s individual baseline values and underl ying conditions. Subjects who 
prese nt with the following laboratory  abnormalities should be evaluated further to 
definitively  determine the etiology  of the abnormal laboratory values:

allergic disease, and work exposure, should be collected. Further testing for acute hepatitis 
A, B, or C infection and liver imaging (eg ,biliary  tract) may  be warranted. All cases 
confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory
 criteria defined above , with no other 
cause for LFT abnormalities identified at the time should be considered potential Hy ’s Law 
cases irrespective of availability  of all the results of the investigations performed to 
determine e tiology  of the abnormal L FTs. Such potential Hy ’s Law cases should be reported 
as serious adverse events.

Page 668.7.Severity Assessment
If required on the adverse event case report forms, the investigator will use the adjectives 
MILD, MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the maximum intensity  of the adverse event.  
For purposes of consistency , these intensity  grades are defined as follows:
MILD Does not interfere with subject's usual function.
MODERATE Interferes to some extent with subject's usual function.
SEVERE Interferes significantl y with subject's usual function.
Note the dist inction between the severit y and the seriousness of an adverse event.  A severe 
event is not necessarily  a serious event.  For example, a headache may  be severe (interferes 
significantly  with subject's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met 
one of the criteria for serious adverse events, listed above.
8.8.Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all adverse events (serious 
and non-serious); the investigator must record the causal relation ship in the CRF, as 
appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting 
requirements if applicable.  An investigator’s causality  assessment is the determination of 
whether there exists a reasonable possibility  that t he investigational product caused or 
contributed to an adverse event ; generally  the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a 
causal relationship should be provided .  If the investigator does not know whether or not the 
investigational product caused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to 
investigational product” for reporting purposes, as defined b y the Sponsor ( See Section on
Reporting Requirements .  If the investigator's causality  assessment is "unknown but not 
related to investigational product", this should be clearl y documented on study records.  
In addition, if the investigator determines a serious adverse event is associated with study  
procedures, the investigator must record this causal r elationship in the source documents and 
CRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse 
event reporting requirements, if applicable.
8.9.Exposure During Pregnancy
For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for markete d products, an exposure during 
pregnancy  (EDP) occurs if:
1.A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been
exposed (eg, due to treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational 
product; or the female becomes or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/ or 
being exposed to the investigational product;

been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
2. A male has been exposed (eg, due to treatment or environmental exposure)  to the 
investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed 
during his partner’s pregnancy  
If a stud y subject or study subject’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the 
study  subject’s treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must submit this 
information to the [COMPANY_007] drug safet y unit on an SAE report form and an EDP supplemental 
form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred.  In addition, the investigator must submit 
information regarding environmental exposure to a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a 
subject reports that she is pregnant and has been expose d to a cy totoxic product by  [CONTACT_8897][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) using the EDP supplemental form .  This must be done irrespective of whether an 
AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure.   The information 
submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery  (see below for information related 
to termination of pregnancy ).
Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy until 
completion or until pregnancy  termination) and notify  [COMPANY_007] of the outcome as a follow up to 
the initial EDP supplemental form .  In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity  of the 
neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the even t of a termination, the reason(s) for 
termination should be specified and, if clinicall y possible, the structural integrity  of the 
terminated fetus should be assessed b y gross visual inspection (unless pre -procedure test 
findings are conclusive for a conge nital anomal y and the findings are reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy , 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fet aldemise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a 
live born baby, a terminated fe tus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the 
investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnancy  outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows: 
Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and mi ssed abortion;
Neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_716396] 
Additional information regarding the exposure during pregnancy  may  be requested by  [CONTACT_1275].  Further follow -
up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis
(eg, follow -up on preterm infants to identify  developmental delay s).  In the case of paternal 
exposure, the investigator will provide the study  subject with the Pregnant Partner Release of 
Information Form to deliver to his partner.  The Investigator must document in the source

8.10. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when, during the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact [CONTACT_8898], which may  or may  not lead to the occurrence of an AE .
An occupational exposure is reported to the drug safet y unit within 24 hours of the 
investigator’s awareness, using the SAE report form, regardless of whether there is an 
associated AE/SAE.  Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study , 
the information is not reported on a CRF; however, a copy  of the completed SAE report form 
is maintained in the investigator site file.
8.11. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See Also Section on Subject Withdrawal )
Withdrawal due to adverse event should be distinguished from withdrawal due to insufficient 
response, accord ing to the definition of adverse event noted earlier, and recorded on the 
appropriate adverse event CRF page.  
When a subject withdraws due to a serious adverse event, the serious adverse event must be 
reported in accordance with the reporting requirement s defined below.
8.12. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The investigator is to report all directly observed adverse events and all adverse events 
spontaneously  reported by  [CONTACT_232304] /parent(s)/legal guardian/legally  acceptable 
representative .  In addit ion, each stud y subject /parent(s)/legal guardian/legally  acceptable 
representative will be questioned about adverse events.

Each adverse event is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for serious adverse 
events.  If a serious adverse event occurs, expedited reporting will follow local and 
international regulations, as appropriate.
8.13.1.
Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
If a serious adverse event occurs, [COMPANY_007] is to be notified within [ADDRESS_716398] be made immediatel y, irrespective of the extent of available 
adverse event information.  This timeframe also applies to additional ne w information 
(follow -up) on previously  forwarded serious adverse event reports as well as to the initial and

adverse event immediately  (eg, if an outpatient study  subject initially  seeks treatment 
elsewhere), the investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and 
document the time of his/her first awareness of the adverse event.
For all serious adverse events, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information 
to [COMPANY_007] in accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above.  In addition, an 
investigator may be requested by  [CONTACT_4695] -up information in 
an expedited fashion.  Th einformation collected for serious adverse events is more detailed 
than that captured on the adverse event case report form.  In general, this will inc lude a 
description of the adverse event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical 
assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality.  I nformation on 
other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant medications , vaccines, and/or
illnesses must be provided.  I n the case of a subject death, a summary  of available autops y 
findings must be submitted as soon as possible to [COMPANY_007] or its designated representative. 
8.13.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
All adve rse events will be reported on the adverse event page(s) of the CRF.  I t should be 
noted that the form for collection of serious adverse event information is not the same as the 
adverse event CRF.  Where the same data are collected, the forms must be compl eted in a 
consistent manner.  For example, the same adverse event term should be used on both forms.  
Adverse events should be reported using concise medical terminology on the CRFs as well as 
on the form for collection of serious adverse event information .
8.13.3. Sponsor ’sReporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
Adverse events reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be 
carried out in accordance with applicable local regulations.
9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATIS TICAL METHODS
Detailed methodology  for summary  and statistical anal yses of the data collected in this trial 
will be documented in a Statistical Analy sis Plan, which will be dated and maintained by  [CONTACT_103]. This document may  modify  the plans outlined in the protocol; howeve r, any  major 
modifications of the primary  endpoint definition and/or its analy sis will also be reflected in a

The primary  anal ysis will be the evaluation of adverse events throughout the trial, laboratory  
tests, and physical examination.  
The set of subjects for this evaluation will be the Safety population, defined as all subjects 
with at least 1 dose of study medication. 
The following parameters will be summarized: rates of discontinuation, adverse events , ECG 
findings (if applicable) , and laboratory  abnormalities.

Descriptive statistics for categorical data will include frequencies and/or percentages.
9.2.Analysis of Secondary Endpoints
The efficacy anal ysis will be an assessment of glob al response at EOIVT, EOT , 2week and 
6 week FU visits. Global response will be derived from the investigator’s assessment of 
clinical and microbiological response as defined in Section 7.4. Theanalysis will be 
conducted b y frequencies and percentages of global response b y determination (success, 
failure).  These efficacy  anal yses will be assessed in the Modified I ntent- to-Treat (MITT) 
population, which will be defined as all subjects who have received at least one dose of study  
drug and who have microbiological confirmation of Candida infection.  
Rates of relapse (recurrence) and new infection at FU visits will also be derived from the 
investigator’s assessment of clinical a nd microbiologic response as defined in 
Section 7.4,
and anal yzed.  Time to death will be anal yzed and all- cause mortality  rates determined.
9.3.Pharmacokinetic Analyses
9.3.1. Non-compartmental Pharmaco
kinetic Analysis
Non-compartmental pharmacokinetic anal ysis will be performed on individual plasma 
anidulafungin concentration -time data from children <2 years to obtain the following 
pharmacokinetic parameters of anidulafungin: AUC 24and C max.  Data listi ngs and summary  
statistics will be generated for each pharmacokinetic parameter and presented in graphical 
and/or tabular format.  
9.3.2. Population Pharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic (PK- PD) Analysis
Measures of efficacy  or safet y versus stead y-state anidulafungin exposure (AUC 24) will be 
modeled using a nonlinear mixed effects approach as appropriate.
Firstly , population pharmacokinetic analy sis on the plasma concentration data of 
anidulafungin will be performed to derive the conditional estimation of individual A UC 24.  
Population PK -PD models will be developed using an iterative process, adapting the model 
to improve the goodness of fit.  I n the case that only  one record on the PD data (efficacy  or 
safet y endpoints) will be obtained from each subject , a Naïve Pooled D ata (NPD) anal ysis 
will be considered for PK -PD anal ysis.  In the case that multiple measurements are available, 
the time to event anal ysis may  be explored as appropriate.
If a sufficient number of MI C values are available, the association between the PK-PD index, 
AUC/MI C, and efficacy  will also be evaluated using the same approach.  If data permit, the 
association between C max/MIC and efficacy  will be explored. 
Polysorbate 80 exposure parameters (eg, AUC 24, Cmax) will alsobeestimated using a 
nonlin ear mixed effects approach as appropriate.

11.DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]
11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term C ase Report F orm (CRF) should be understood to refer to 
either a paper form or an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection 
method used in this study .
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included subject.  The c ompleted 
original CRFs are the sole propert y of [COMPANY_007] and should not be made available in any form to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of [COMPANY_007] or appropriate regulatory  
authorities, without written permission from [COMPANY_007].
The investi gator has ultimate responsibility  for the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safet y, laboratory  data entered on the CRFs and any  other data collection forms (source 
documents) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic/original, attributable, complete, 
consistent, legible, timely (contemporaneous), enduring and available when required .The 
CRFs must be signed by  [CONTACT_47616]. Any corrections to entries ma de in the CRFs, source 
documents must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary ) and should not obscure the 
original entry . 
In most cases, the source documents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]'s or the ph ysician's subject chart.  In 
these cases data collected on th e CRFs must match the data in those charts. 
In some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF, may  also serve as source documents.  In these 
cases, a document should be available at the investigator’s site as well as at [COMPANY_007] and clearl y 
identify  those data tha t will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the 
source document.
11.2. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory  authorities or [COMPANY_007], the investigator 
agrees to keep records, including the identity  of all parti cipating subjects (sufficient
information to link records, e g, CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed informed 
consent forms, copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], serious adverse event forms, source documents, and

Study  Agreement, whichever is l onger.
If the investigator becomes unable for an y reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period ( eg, retirement, relocation), [COMPANY_007] should be prospectivel y notified.  The 
study  records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to P fizer, such as another 
investigator, another institution, or to an independent third part y arranged by [CONTACT_4618].  
Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of [ADDRESS_716403] obtain [COMPANY_007]'s written permission before disposing of an y records,

12.ETHICS
12.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)
It is the respons ibility  of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study  protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent forms, and other relevant documents, eg, 
recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the IRB/IEC.  All correspondence with the 
IRB/IEC should be retained in the Investigator File.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1099]/I EC approvals should be 
forwarded to [COMPANY_007].
The only  circumstance in which an amendment may  be initiated prior to IRB/I EC approval is 
where the change is necessary  to eliminate apparent immediat e hazards to the subjects.  In 
that event, the investigator must notify  the IRB/IEC and [COMPANY_007] in writing immediately  after 
the implementation.
12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study  will be conducted in accordance with legal and regulatory  requirements, a s well as 
the general principles set forth in the I nternational E thical Guidelines for Biomedical 
Research Involving Human S ubjects (Counsel for International Organization of Medical 
Science 2002), Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (International Confe rence on 
Harmonization 1996), and the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association 1996 & 
2008).
In addition, the study  will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, the I nternational 
Conference on Harmonisation guideline on Good Clinical Practi ce, and applicable local 
regulatory  requirements and laws.
12.3. Subject Information and Consent
All parties will ensure protection of subject personal data and will not include subject names 
on any  sponsor forms, reports, publications, or in any  other disclosur es, except where

reasonabl y be consulted, then, as permitted b y the IRB/EC and consistent with local 
regulatory  and legal requirements, the subject’s assent may  be waived with source 
documentation of t he reason assent was not obtained.  If the study  subject does not provide 
hisorher own consent, the source documents must record wh y the subject did not provide 
consent (eg, minor, decisionally  impaired adult), how the investigator determined that the 
person signing the consent was the subject’s legally  acceptable representative, the consent 
signer’s relationship to the study  subject (eg, parent, spouse) ,and that the subject’s assent 
was obtained, or waived.  If assent is obtained verbally  it must be doc umented in the source 
documents.
If the stud y includes minor subjects who reach the age of majorit y during the study, as 
recognized under local law, they  must re -consent as adults to remain in the study .  If the 
enrollment of ‘emancipated minors’ is permit ted by [CONTACT_43038] y age criteria, the I RB/EC, and 
local law, they  must provide documentation of legal status to give consent without the 
permission of a parent or legal guardian.
The investigator, or a person designated b y the investigator, will obtain writte n informed 
consent from each subject or the subject 's legal lyacceptable representative , parent(s) or legal 
guardian and assent from each subject (if applicable) before an y stud y-specific activity  is 
performed.   The investigator will retain the original of each subject's signed consent/assent
document .

13.DEFINITION OF END OF STUDY
13.1. End of Study in a Member State 
End of Study in a Member State of the European Union is defined as the time at which it is 
deemed that sufficient subjects have been recruited and completed the study  as stated in the 
regulatory  application (ie, Clinical Trial Applicatio n (CTA)) and ethics application in the 
Member State.  Poor recruitment (recruiting less than the anticipated number in the CTA) b y 
a Member State is not a reason for premature termination but is considered a normal 
conclusion to the study  in that Member St ate.

This prospective, open -label study  will assess the pharmacokinetics, safet y and efficacy  of 
intravenous (IV) anidulafungin when used to treat children aged 1 month to <18 y ears with 
invasive candidiasis, including candidemia (ICC).
The primary  study  objective is to assess the safe ty and tolerability  of anidulafungin when 
used to treat children with candidaemia and/or other forms of invasive candidiasis (ICC).  
Additional assessments will include global response at the end of IV therapy  (EOIVT) and 
subsequent time points, exposure-r esponse relationship, the rates of relapse and emerging 
infection at follow up (FU) visits, and analysis of time to death all cause mortality  atduring

2. Section Protocol Summary Background and Rationale, Paragraph [ADDRESS_716410] Candida species.  In the [LOCATION_002], anidulafungin is approved for the 
treatment of candidemia and other forms of Candida infections (intra -abdominal abscess and 
peritonitis) in adults .  To date, there are no clinical studies evaluating anidulafungin in 
paediatric patients with invasive Candida infection.  This study will assess the 
pharmacokinetics, safet y and efficacy  of anidulafungin in patients 1 month to <18 y ears of 
age with ICC.  Exposure -response relationships of anidulafungin will also be assessed in a 
population pharmacokinetic -pharmacod ynamic (PK -PD) anal ysis.

3. Section Protocol Summary Study Design, Paragraphs 2, 4, 5, 6, [ADDRESS_716411] is 
to receive a loading dose of 3.0 mg/kg (not to exceed 200 mg).   Subject is then to receive 
a daily maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg (not to exceed 100 mg) from Day 2 onwards .  
Subjects will be stratified by [CONTACT_654] (1 month -<2 years, 2 -<5 years, and 5 - <18 y ears).  
Subjects may  be sw itched to oral fluconazole (6 -12 mg/kg/day , maximum 800 mg/day ) after 
at least [ADDRESS_716412] the following assessments at the screening visit: phy sical examination, 
assessm ent of signs and sy mptoms of Candida infection, urine pregnancy  test (for females of 
childbearing potential), chest X -ray, fundoscopic examination, blood cultures, specimen 
culture or histopathology of other normall y sterile sites (as clinicall y indicated) , and safet y 
laboratory  testing.  Blood cultures will be repeated on Day s [ADDRESS_716413] 24 hours are confirmed to be negative .  Any 
negative blood culture after Day 1 (per protocol schedule or otherwise) must be 
repeated after [ADDRESS_716414] 6 subjects aged between 
1month to <2 y ears, to be enrolled at selected centers.  Use of a second s ystemic antifungal 
agent (eg, amphotericin B) wil l be permitted for these 6 subjects onl y.  Three subjects in this 
cohort will be between 1 and <6 months of age and 3 subjects will be between 6 months and 
<2years of age, which will be enrolled in parallel .  Data from these 6 subjects will not be 
utilize d for secondary efficacy endpoint anal yses but will be assessed for safet y.  The 
exposure data from these subjects will be used to confirm if the recommended dosing 
regimen is appropriate for subjects aged <2 years.  After the PK data is evaluated and dosing 
regimen is confirmed, subjects between 1 month to <2 y ears of age will be permitted to be 
enrolled at all sites.  Subsequent to this time point, use of a second s ystemic antifungal agent 
(eg, amphotericin B) will not be permitted. 
A population PK -PD analy sis will also be performed in all other subjects enrolled and will 
include subjects <[ADDRESS_716415] cohort described above, in 
which 3 to 4 5sparse pharmacokinetic samples will be collected. 
Efficacy  will be based on a determination of global response (combination of clinical and 
microbiological response) of success or failure at the EOIVT, EOT, 2 -week FU and 6-week 
FU visits.  The main efficacy assessment will be determined at EOTEOIVT.  Rates of relapse 
and/or new infection will be assessed at the FU visits.  Safety  will be evaluated through 
assessment of adverse events and monitoring of clinical laboratory  tests (hematology  and 
serum chemistry ), temperature, and ph ysical examination results.  All subjects will be 
followed for safet y through the 6 -week FU visit.

will be stratified by  [CONTACT_654] (1 month -<2 years, 2 - <5 years, and 5 -<18 years).  Subjects may  
be switched to oral fluconazole (6- 12 mg/kg/day , maximum 800 mg/day ) after at least 
10days of IV treatment, provided that the pre -specified criteria are met.
All subjects will have the following assessments at the screening visit: phy sical examination, 
assessment of signs and sy mptoms of Candida infection, urine pregnancy  test (for femal es of 
childbearing potential), fundoscopic examination, blood cultures, specimen culture or 
histopathology  of other normally  sterile sites (as clinically  indicated), and safet y laboratory

from a sample obtained from a normally sterile site within 96 hours prior to 
enrolment).  In the latter case, culture confirmation of Candida sp. must be obtained 
within [ADDRESS_716490] is to 
receive a loading dose of 3.0 mg/kg (not to exceed 200 mg).  Subject is then to receive a 
daily  maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg (not to exceed 100 mg ) from Day  2 onwards.  Subjects 
will be stratified by  [CONTACT_654] (1 month -<2 years, 2 - <5 years, and 5 -<18 years).  Subjects may  
be switched to oral fluconazole (6- 12 mg/kg/day , maximum 800 mg/day ) after at least 10 
days of IV treatment, provided that the pr e-specified criteria are met.
It is expected that the majority  of subjects will receive study  drug in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]; subjects 
will be permitted to complete study  medication on an outpatient basis if deemed appropriate 
by [CONTACT_093].  All subjects will receive treatment (either solel y anidulafungin, or 
anidulafungin followed by  [CONTACT_547580]) for a minimum duration of [ADDRESS_716491] of negative culture (defined as the second of two consecutive negative 
cultures, separated by [CONTACT_547597] [ADDRESS_716492] positive culture ) and 
improvement of clinical signs and symptom of candidemia or invasive candidiasis.  This will 
be considered the End of Treatment (EOT). Total treatment duration with anidulafungin is 
not to exceed [ADDRESS_716493] the following assessments at the screening visit: phy sical examination, 
assessment of signs and sy mptoms of Candida infection, urine or serum pregnancy  test (for

Efficacy  will be based on a determination of global response (combination of clin ical and 
microbiological response) of success or failure at the EOIVT, EOT, 2 -week FU and 6-week 
FU visits.  Rates of relapse (recurrence) and/or new infection will be assessed at the FU 
visits.  Safety  will be evaluated through assessment of adverse event s and monitoring of 
clinical laboratory  tests (hematology  and serum chemistry ), temperature, and phy sical 
examination results.  All subjects will be followed for safety  through the 6-week FU visit.  
The planned enrolment is 60 evaluable subjects (those su bjects who have received at 
least one dose of anidulafungin and have confirmed Candida infection).
We plan to amend this protocol at a future time to allow for the enrollment of neonates (from 
0 to 1 month of age) when additional pharmacokinetic data are a vailable for this patient

sample obtained from a normally sterile site within 96 hours prior to enrolment).  In the 
latter case, culture confirmation of Candida sp. must be obtained within [ADDRESS_716518] 
treatment initiation.  If culture con firmation is not obtained within this time period, 
subjects will be discontinued from study treatment but will remain in the study for 
continued safety monitoring.  These subjects will be required to return for the 2 -week 
and 6 -week follow -up visits.
All subjects meeting screening criteria will receive IV anidulafungin.  Enrollment will be 
stratified by  [CONTACT_654] (1 month -<2 years, 2 -<5 years, and 5 - <18 years), allowing 20 + 2 in 
each stratum.  Subjects may  be switched to oral fluconazole (6 -12 mg/kg/day , maximum 
800mg/day ) after at least 10 days of IV anidulafungin treatment, provided that all of the 
following criteria are met:
The subject is afebrile for at least 24 hours;
The subject is able to tolerate oral medication;
Documentation of two blood culture s negative for Candida spp separated by  [CONTACT_2669] 
24hours;
Documentation of a negative culture for Candida spp from an y other sites of infection 
identified at enrollment;
The specific Candida isolate identified at study entry is susceptible to fluconazole;
Signs and sy mptoms of Candida infection have improved such that the Investigator 
feels it is appropriate to switch to oral fluconazole.
It is expected that the majority  of subjects will receive study  drug in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]; subjects 
will be permitted to co mplete study  medication on an outpatient basis if deemed appropriate 
by [CONTACT_093].
All subjects will receive treatment (either solel y IV anidulafungin, or anidulafungin followed 
by [CONTACT_547580]) for a minimum duration of [ADDRESS_716519] of negative 
culture (defined as the second of two consecutive negative cultures, separated by [CONTACT_2669] 
[ADDRESS_716520] positive culture) and improvement of clinical signs and 
symptoms of candidemia or invasive candidiasis.  This will be considered the EOT.  Total 
treatment duration with anidulafungin is not to exceed [ADDRESS_716521] the following assessments at the screening visit: phy sical exa mination, 
assessment of signs and sy mptoms of Candida infection, urine or serum pregnancy  test (for 
females of childbearing potential), fundoscopic examination, blood cultures, specimen 
culture or histopathology of other normall y sterile sites (as clinical ly indicated), and safet y

endpoint anal yses but will be assessed for safety .  The exposure data from these subjects will 
be used to confirm if the recommended dosing regimen is appropriate for subjects aged 
<2years.  After the dosing regimen is confirmed, subjects between 1 month to <2 years of 
age will be permitted to be enrolled at all sites.  Subsequent to this time point, use of a 
second s ystemic antifungal agent (eg, amphotericin B) will not be permitted.
A population PK -PD analy sis will also be performed in all other subjects enrolled and will 
include subjects <[ADDRESS_716523] cohort described above, in 
which 3 to 5 sparse pharmacokinetic samples will be collected.
Efficacy will be based on a determination of global response (combination of clinical and 
microbiological response) of success or failure at the EOIVT, EOT, 2 -week FU and 6-week 
FU visits.  Rates of relapse (recurrence) and/or new infection will be assessed at the FU 
visits.  Safety  will be evaluated through assessment of adverse events and monitoring of 
clinical laboratory  tests (hematology  and serum chemistry ), temperature, and phy sical 
examination results.  All subjects will be followed for safety  through the 6-week FU visit.  
The planned enrolment is 60 evaluable subjects (those subjects who have received at 
least one dose and confirmed Candida infection).
We plan to amend this protocol at a future time to allow for the enrollment of neonates (from 
0 to 1 month of age) when additional pharmacokinetic data are available for this patient 
population.

SUMMARY
Reason(s) for Amendment
The primary  reasons for creation of this protocol amendment are as follows :
To remove the exclusion criteria and allow for the enrollment of subjects with 
Candida endocarditis on the basis of at least one postive blood culture for Candida sp. 
and evidence of endocarditis on echocardiogram;
To remove the exclusion criteria and allow for the enrollment of subejcts with 
Candida osteomy elitis on the basis of at least one positive culture for Candida sp. 
from a bone biops y or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_547574] a magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI ) study ;
The Sponsor has also taken the opportunity  to make additions, changes, and clarifications to
the protocol, as appropriate. Following is a summary  of additional clarifications/ 
modifications made:
Clarified that subjects in the pharmacokinetics subgroup (ie, the first 6 subjects 
between 1 month and <2 y ears of age enrolled at selected centers) may  be given 
anidulafugin as either monotherapy or in combination with a second antifungal 
therap y, at the investigator’s discretion.  In the event the investigator choses to treat 
with combin ation therapy , then, following completion of PK sampling, these subjects 
will be discontined from study  treatment but will continue to be followed for safet y 
assessments and are required to return for the 2- and 6 -week follow -up visit.

treatment with anidulafungin, subjects may be switched to oral fluconazole (provided 
switch criteria are met) to complete treatment.
In subjects with Candida endocarditis and Candida osteomyelitis who require 
continued treatment beyond the maximum total treatment duration (49 days), this 
treatment will be considered outside the context of this clinical trial and study drug will 
not be supplied by [CONTACT_1034].  For the purpose of study treatment evaluation, Day 35 
(for subjects who require continued IV treatment) or Day 49 (for subjects who required 
continued oral therapy) will be considered the last day o f study drug treatment.  These 
subjects are also required to return for the [ADDRESS_716566] 6 subjects between 1 month to <2 years of age to confirm whether or not the 
recommended dosing regimen contained within the pr otocol for this age group is 
appropriate.  These subjects may be administered anidulafugin in one of two ways: 
either as monotherapy or in combination with a second systemic antifungal agent (e.g., 
amphotericin B).  
In the event the investigator choses to administer anidulafungin as monotherapy for the 
treatment of invasive candidiasis/candidemia, treatment will be administered for a 
minimum duration of [ADDRESS_716567] negative culture (defined as the 
second of two consecutive negative cu ltures, separated by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_716568] positive culture) and improvement of clinical signs and symptom of candidemia 
or invasive candidiasis.  
In the event the investigator chooses to administer anidulafungin in combination with a 
second antifungal agent, anidulafugin will be discontinued following the obtainment of 
required blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis as specified by [CONTACT_760]; the 
data from these subjects will not be utilized for secondary efficacy endpoint analyses 
but will be assessed for safety.  After the dosing regimen is confirmed by [CONTACT_1034], 
enrollment will be opened to additional subjects within this age group at all investigator 
sites.  Subsequent to this time point, the use of a second systemic antifunga l agent (e.g., 
amphotericin B) will not be permitted in any subject.

9. The ‘screening visit culture’ is the culture result that qualifies the subject for study entry (along with other inclusion criteria) and is from a blood or 
tissue sample that was obtained within 96 hours prior to the screening visit, that is positive for Candida sp.  The result of this culture will be reco rded on the

report form once the organism has been identified and the information is available. Please note, if the day of the screening visit is also Day 1 of treatment, a 
sample of blood for culture will be obtained; otherwise a sample of blood for culture is not required until the first day of treatment (Day 1), just prior to 
administration of st udy drug. Screening blood culture is to be obtained within [ADDRESS_716576] dose of Study Drug (Day 1).  For the screening blo od 
culture, it is preferable for two (2) aerobic blood cultures to be obtained from two (2) separate sites, however, if th is is not practical for clinical reasons, the required 
screening blood cultures may be collected according to local practice standards and as the clinical circumstances dictate.

infection are diverse and dependent on disease severity , the site of infection and status 
of the host immune sy stem. Constitutional sy mptoms suggestive of sy stemic 
infection include fever and sepsis ( eg, tach ycardia, hy potension). Infection of 
visceral organ(s) t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_547568] d ysfunction and may  include radiologic 
findings demonstrative of singular or multiple microabscesses. The most frequently  
observed signs and s ymptoms of commonly  encountered forms of candidiasis are 
listed in the Case Report Form. However, the investigator is referred to the most 
recent clinical practice guidelines (published in March 2009), from the Infectious 
Diseases Societ y of America on the management of Candid iasis for comprehensive 
review of signs and s ymptoms associated with this disease.8

administration of the first dose) in all subjects, and then every  three (3) day s 
thereafter (ie, on Day  3, 7, etc.) until two (2) consecutive cultures, separated by  [CONTACT_12697] 24 hours, are confirmed to be negative while on study  medication.  
b. Blood cultures will also be obtained at the end of IV therapy  (EOIVT), and at 
the end of oral therap y (in subjects switched to or al fluconazole).  A blood culture 
at the 2 -week and 6- week follow -up visit is required only  if clinically  indicated.  
c. Additional cultures beyond those required b y the protocol may  be obtained at 
any time at the investigator’s discretion, as clinically  indicated.  The results of the 
cultures should be recorded on the case report form.
4. Tissue Cultures : For subjects whose screening cultures were obtained from sterile 
site samples (other than blood), follow- up cultures from the same anatomical site 
shoul d be repeated onl y as clinically indicated, otherwise they are not required.
Investigators will send specimens (blood or other) to their local certified laboratory  for 
culture (incubation should be a minimum of five day s if not positive before then).  Each
laboratory  will follow its usual procedures for identification of the species and susceptibility  
testing to marketed agents.  
Additionally , all Candida isolates must be preserved for shipment to the reference laboratory  
for further identification, including speciation, and susceptibility  testing.  This includes the 
original isolate that the diagnosis for inclusion into the study  was made, as well as all 
subsequently  recovered Candida isolates from any site.  If more than one species of Candida
is isolated from a single culture, all isolates must be sent to the reference laboratory.  The

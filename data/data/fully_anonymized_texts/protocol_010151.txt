IRB # [ADDRESS_410128] the accuracy of pulse oximeter s during mild, moderate and 
severe hypoxia; i.e. a range of arterial HbO 2 saturations from 100 to down to 70%. This is done 
by [CONTACT_331518], steady state hypoxia with a gold - 
standard measurement of blood oxyhemo globin saturation (arterial blood sample processed in a 
laboratory hemoximeter). The data obtained is submitted by [CONTACT_331519], or may be used for engineering or calibration purposes.

data points to meet th e ISO [ZIP_CODE] -2-61:201 7). 
 
Per FDA guidance, at least 2, or 15% of the subjects will have dark skin. Equal numbers of men 
and women will be enrolled.

comply with study  procedures.  
16. The subject has any other condition, which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_7372]’ would  make  
them unsuitable for the study.  
 
 
Procedures  
After injection of a local anesthetic, a 22 -gauge catheter is inserted in one radial artery. 
Pulse oximeters are attached to fingers, ears or flat body surfaces. Subjects are in a comfortable 
semi -recumbent position. Subjects then breathe air mixtures containing reduced amounts of 
oxygen to produce the desired level of hypoxemia. Stable, safe and controlled hypoxia is breath - 
by [CONTACT_331520][INVESTIGATOR_331510] a computer program that permits the inspi[INVESTIGATOR_331511] a level of lung alveolar gas  that will achieve the desired degree 
of saturation.  
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], saturation levels involve one period with air breathing and then at one of 6 
levels with reduced oxygen, e.g. 94%, 90%, 85%, 80%, 75% and 70% saturation. Each level of 
saturation is held for 3 0-60 seconds. At appropriate intervals and when oxygen levels are stable, 
arterial blood samples are obtained from the radial arterial catheter. The operator then changes 
the inspi[INVESTIGATOR_331512] -state level of hyp oxia. A "run" 
consists of several stable steady -state hypoxia levels and together takes 10 -15 minutes. Each run 
is terminated by a breath of 100% O [ADDRESS_410130] oximetry in a Radiometer ABL -90 multi -wavelength  oximeter.  
The precise target levels of saturation can be adjusted to suit the sponsor, but typi[INVESTIGATOR_331513] O and FDA standards for testing, which is 70% to 100%.  
The study takes about [ADDRESS_410131]'s time. Analysis of the data requires several 
days. We encourage manufacturer’s representatives to be present for these tests, and to mount the 
probes. An e xtra charge is made if no representative is present, requiring us to mount the probes 
and record data.  
 
Sponsor Pulse oximeter study data  
Data from test pulse oximeters for comparison to blood values can be obtained in several 
ways. In every case, the goal  is to obtain a reading from the oximeter that corresponds to the  
IRB # [ADDRESS_410132] 
shows a sudden fall or rise in oxygen saturation, not at the time of blood sampling. This 
procedure accounts for the delays of finger circulation and uses the estimated delay from the 
lung to the sample site. There is no useful correlation between the actual time of blood sampling 
and the oximeter recording because of the variability of tissue blood flow lag. As mentioned, 
steady -state hypoxia avoids the concern that oximeter reading is not aligned with a blood  sample 
reading.  
 
Statistics  
The number of subjects and the number of comparisons (paired pulse oximeter readings 
and arterial saturation values) is determined by [CONTACT_98843] [2]. This is a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_410133] due to motion  or other  interference  and occasionally  some 
do not  consent.  
 
The following demographic data will be collected on the subjects:  
- gender (male, female,  other) 
- age 
- skin tone (dark, medium,  light)  
- height  (cm)  
- weight  (kg) 
- wrist circumference  (cm)  
- dominant hand (left or  right)  
 
Data Analysis  
In all cases, the blood analysis data are provided, including the SaO2, MetHb, COHb and Hgb 
concentration.  
The data analysis report will consist of the following:  
• A Table of the oximeter readings versus corresponding blood SaO2  values.  
• Graphic plots of the  bias between the oximeter reading and the SaO2 measured by [CONTACT_331521] (on the blood sample, i.e Modified Bland -Altman plots for each instrument or 
instrument probe  combination.  
• Regression equations for the bias of each  instrument.  
• Tables of the mean error or bias, its standard deviation, standard error, 95% confidence 
interval, maximum and minimum and root mean square error, all computed both overall  and 
by [CONTACT_98845] -ranges of  desaturation.

Subject Safety  
Pulse oximeters are typi[INVESTIGATOR_331514] -significant risk medical devices. The LED light 
energy utilized in typi[INVESTIGATOR_331515].  An LED  light emits  light that passes  through  the tissue.  A 
light detector then measures how much light was absorbed by [CONTACT_247747]. Based on the ratio of 
absorbance of different wavelengths of light, the device calculates the ox ygen  saturation.  
 
Risks  
Breathing a very low oxygen mixture may cause dizziness and might cause loss of  
consciousness for a few seconds. It may make one feel very short of breath during the test and  for 
a few seconds afterwards. There is a remote possibili ty that if the subject loses consciousness 
he/she  might  have  muscular  twitching  or convulsions.  This study  will not seek to reach  saturations 
below 70%. Hypoxia may cause tachycardia and increased blood pressure during the test, and 
might  cause  headache.  In all the years  of conducting  the study  no subject  has mentioned  headache. 
Much  more  severe  and prolonged  lack of oxygen  could  cause brain  injury  or death,  but the duration 
and depth of hypoxia is limited by [CONTACT_98846]. The needle catheter used to 
take blood  may hurt when  it is inserted  despi[INVESTIGATOR_331516],  and there  may be a black 
and blue spot afterward. It is remotely possible the artery might be damaged or clot, or a tendon 
sheath  near it be injured  by [CONTACT_98847],  resulting  in some  soreness.  These  risks  are unlikely  because 
none of the enrolled 2000+ subjects has ever had a serious c omplication. Hyperventilating during 
the part of the study requiring reduced PCO2 may make subjects lightheaded or dizzy. Breathing 
air with added CO2 may make subjects feel short of breath and cause a headache. Some subjects 
feel faint when  they arrive  for the study,  apparently  related  to the thought  of having  an arterial  line. 
These subjects were excluded from the study and suffered no further  discomfort.  
 
Risk Mitigations  
Subjects are all monitored with accurate reference oximeters and continuou s end -tidal 
gas analysis to prevent the risk of more profound hypoxia than desired. Investigators are 
experienced anesthesiologists adept at assessing breathing and in maintaining appropriate airway 
conditions. The study room is set up like an OR with all resuscitation equipment immediately 
available.  
 
Informed Consent  
Written  informed  consent  is obtained  before  any study  interventions.  In discussions  with 
the study coordinator before the day of the study, potential subjects will be offered the consent 
form to review. On the day of the study subjects are given the consent form which they read and 
sign if they wish to participate. A study doctor is present to answer  questions.  
 
Only subjects clearly able to understand and read English will be enro lled. Subjects will be asked 
if they have any questions and are told they can withdraw at any time.

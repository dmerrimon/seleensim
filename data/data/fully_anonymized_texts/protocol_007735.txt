3. Background
Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) are commonly used in the practice of anesthesiology 
for skeletal muscle relaxation to facilitate tracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, and to 
provide optimal surgical conditions. They fall into two categories, i.e. the non-depolarizing 
agents versus succinylcholine, which is the only depolarizing agent in clinical use. Non-
depolarizing NMBAs in turn are classified as either an aminosteroid or benzylisoquinolinium 
compound; the former include pancuronium, vecuronium, and rocuronium, whereas the latter 
include atracurium, cisatracurium and mivacurium (1). In order to prevent residual NMB, it is 
vital to adequately reverse any use of a non-depolarizing NMBA. This was historically done 
using an anticholinesterase such as neostigmine, which would increase the concentration of 
acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction leading to the return of neuromuscular 
transmission. 
Unfortunately, there are disadvantages to the use of an anticholinesterase. Firstly, there is a 
“ceiling” effect, i.e. “once the acetylcholinesterase enzyme is maximally inhibited by [CONTACT_845658], the 
administration of additional drug will not further increase acetylcholine levels or enhance 
recovery of neuromuscular blockade” (2, p. 842). Secondly, the use of an anticholinesterase 
with relatively mild residual blockade may lead to paradoxical muscle weakness. Thirdly, 
anticholinesterase agents have a multitude of adverse effects due to their muscarinic effects 
such as nausea, bradycardia, and bronchospasm. (2) Thus, an alternative method to antagonize 
the non-depolarizing NMBAs came to be a topic of research.
It was in this context that sugammadex was found to be a valuable addition to the 
anesthesiologist’s armamentarium. It is a modified γ-cyclodextrin  that encapsulates the 
aminosteroid NMBAs rocuronium and vecuronium. It was first discovered by [CONTACT_845659] [ZIP_CODE]. The successful results of 
the first in vivo study was published in 2002 (3), where rocuronium was reversed in 
anesthetized monkeys, and the first phase I study was published in 2005 (4). It was approved by 
[CONTACT_845660] (FDA) in 2015, with the following three dosing 
ranges, i.e. 2 mg/kg if the train-of-four (TOF) stimulation reaches the second twitch, 4 mg/kg if 
there is no twitch response to TOF stimulation but there are [ADDRESS_1175359]-tetanic counts (PTC), 
and 16 mg/kg after administration of 1.2 mg/kg of rocuronium (5).

neostigmine 
Page 5 of 30  Version: 3 (10/14/2024)
IRB Form BIO 01192022In the clinical assessment of NMBA reversal, a TOF ratio1 of 0.7 was historically seen as 
adequate, but this has been revised in the face of recent evidence that showed a TOF ratio of 
any less than 0.9 could result in “impaired pharyngeal function, airway obstruction, an 
increased risk of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_152211], an impaired hypoxic ventilatory control, and 
unpleasant symptoms of muscle weakness” (2, p. 836). Even if the TOF stimulation count is 4 
but there is still detectable TOF fade, the TOF ratio will equate to 0.1-0.4 (6); this does not 
significantly change with a 5-second, 50-Hz tetanic stimulation (TOF ratio ~0.3) and is only 
slightly improved with double-burst stimulation (TOF ratio ~0.6-0.7) (2).
Carvalho et al. conducted a meta-analysis of 53 studies (12,664 adult patients), where the 
pooled residual NMB incidence ranged from 0.115 when quantitative neuromuscular 
monitoring was used to 0.331 where no neuromuscular monitoring was used (7). Raval et al. 
conducted a meta-analysis of 20 randomized controlled trials (1,923 adult patients), where 
residual NMB (TOF ratio < 0.9) was found in 2.8% of patients who received sugammadex 
compared to 39% of those who received neostigmine [ADDRESS_1175360] administration for a 
moderate block (TOF count 1-4) compared to 1.1% for sugammadex versus 99.1% for 
neostigmine 15 minutes after administration for a deep block (PTC 1-5) (8). Concerningly, 60 
minutes after administration, 2.1% of the sugammadex group versus 19% of the neostigmine 
group still had NMB in the moderate block group compared to 0.4% of the sugammadex group 
versus 39.3% of the neostigmine group in the deep block group. When expanded to 
observational studies (58 studies with 25,277 adult patients), the incidence of residual NMB 
(TOF ratio < 0.9 upon arrival to PACU) ranged from 0% to 90.5% (median 30%), which was 
significantly lower (0% to 16%) in the sugammadex group compared to 3.5% to 90.5% in the 
neostigmine group and 15% to 89% in the spontaneous recovery group (9).
The incidence of residual NMB in the pediatric population has been variably reported. Ledowski 
et al. published in 2015 a series of 64 children (average age 8.2 years) who received NMBA for 
tracheal intubation, only 33 of whom received NMB reversal (32 with neostigmine 0.08 mg/kg 
and 1 with sugammadex); 19.4% of those who received no reversal and 37.5% of those who 
received neostigmine was found to have residual NMB (TOF ratio < 0.9) prior to extubation 
using acceleromyometry, giving an overall incidence of 28.1% (10). Similarly, Klucka et al. 
published in 2019 a series of 291 children (range: 29 weeks to 19 years of age) who received 
NMBA for surgery, 68 of whom received NMB reversal; the TOF ratio was found to be < 0.9 in 
48.2% of patients prior to extubation in the OR versus 26.9% upon arrival to the PACU using 
accelerometry (11).
A Cochrane systematic review published in 2017 (12) analyzed 41 randomized controlled trials 
of 4,206 adults who received non-depolarizing NMBAs for elective surgery, and found that a 2 
mg/kg dose of sugammadex was 6.6 times faster (10.22 minutes) than a 0.05 mg/kg dose of 
neostigmine in reversing moderate NMB from the second twitch (T2) to a TOF ratio > 0.9, while

Page 6 of 30  Version: 3 (10/14/2024)
IRB Form BIO 01192022a 4 mg/kg dose of sugammadex was 16.8 times faster (45.78 minutes) than a 0.07 mg/kg dose 
of neostigmine in reversing deep NMB from a PTC 1-5 to TOF ratio > 0.9. 
However, less is known when there is shallow NMB, i.e. when the TOF count is [ADDRESS_1175361] et al. found in 2002 that the maximal 0.07 
mg/kg dose of neostigmine was unable to reverse all patients to a TOF ratio of 0.9 within 30 
minutes, even at a pre-intervention TOF count of 4 (13). Whether a lower dose of sugammadex 
would be sufficient to achieve a TOF ratio of 0.9 after shallow NMB has been examined by 
[CONTACT_845661]. in 2010 and Pongrácz et al. in 2013. The former group found that in a group of 94 
adults undergoing elective surgery, a dose of 0.22 mg/kg of sugammadex was equivalent to a 
dose of 0.034 mg/kg of neostigmine in reversing NMB from a TOF ratio of 0.5 to 0.9 within 5 
minutes in 95% of their patients (14). Conversely, Pongrácz’s group found that a 0.5 mg/kg dose 
of sugammadex reversed NMB from a TOF count of 4 to a TOF ratio of 1.0 in 4.1 minutes on 
average compared to 2.1 minutes for a 1.0 mg/kg dose of sugammadex, 1.8 minutes for a 2.0 
mg/kg of sugammadex, and 8.5 minutes for a 0.05 mg/kg dose of neostigmine (15).
Due to the high cost of sugammadex, some researchers have hypothesized that a lower dose is 
required when combined with neostigmine. A 2015 study from Beirut in adults undergoing 
elective surgery demonstrated that a dose of 2 mg/kg of sugammadex combined with 
neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg was non-inferior to the standard dose of 4 mg/kg of sugammadex in 
reversing deep NMB, defined as returning from a TOF count of [ADDRESS_1175362] 
anesthetic care unit (PACU) (16). Lobaz, Sammut and Damodaran reported in [ADDRESS_1175363] five hours after receiving a single 1.2 mg/kg dose 
of rocuronium. He had initially achieved a TOF of 4, was reversed with 2.[ADDRESS_1175364] induction. 
There, his TOF steadily declined to 2, as a result of which he received a 6 mg/kg dose of 
sugammadex, causing him to be successfully extubated ten minutes later (17). It is similarly 
important to dose sugammadex appropriately; Carollo et al. published a case report in 2019 of 
an 8-month-old patient who had recurarization after a 4 mg/kg dose of sugammadex was given 
with a TOF count of 2/4, which fortunately resolved after a second 4 mg/kg dose of 
sugammadex (18).
Lastly, known common adverse effects of neostigmine include bradycardia, nausea and 
vomiting (19), while the use of sugammadex has been found to lead to nausea, vomiting, 
hypotension and headache in ≥ 10% of patients (5). There have also been case reports of 
marked bradycardia possibly leading to cardiac arrest with the use of both agents.

Primary study outcome:
The time taken to achieve a TOF ratio of 0.9 after the use of the intervention drug 
versus placebo in a patient population that has already received neostigmine for NMB 
reversal.
Secondary study outcome:
The percentage of patients who achieve a TOF ratio of 0.9 within 1 minute, 2 minutes, 5 
minutes, and 10 minutes.
Safety outcomes:
The incidence in PACU (measured in %) of:
i. Nausea,
ii. Vomiting,
iii. Bradycardia2,
iv. Tachycardia3, and
v. Hypotension4.
For the safety outcomes, patients who were recruited but did not receive the intervention drug 
will be compared to patients who did receive the intervention drug to determine if their rates 
of adverse effects are similar. However, the sample size in this study is too low to perform 
formal non-inferiority tests on this data.
5. Study Intervention/Investigational Agent 
Study intervention:
Patients will be randomized to six groups: 2 mg/kg (the lowest dose approved by 
[CONTACT_1622]), 1 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, 0.25 mg/kg, 0.125 mg/kg of sugammadex and 
placebo (normal saline).
The Grady Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_845643], while the anesthesia provider in the operating room will administer it.
As elaborated before, sugammadex is a FDA-approved drug that is in routine clinical use for 
NMB reversal.

regulations (PI[INVESTIGATOR_47967] 162798 dated 2022-Jul-13). 
6. Procedures Involved
This project is a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled dose-response trial that aims to 
determine the time taken to achieve adequate reversal comparing five doses of sugammadex 
as rescue therapy following inadequate reversal with neostigmine. 
We will identify patients in the Grady Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_845644], received rocuronium for NMB and neostigmine for 
NMB reversal, and achieved a TOF count of at least 3 twitches but not a TOF ratio of 0.9 fifteen 
minutes after neostigmine has been given.
These patients will be randomized using the Emory University REDCap (Research Electronic 
Data Capture) software to six groups: 2 mg/kg (the lowest dose approved by [CONTACT_1622]), 1 mg/kg, 
0.5 mg/kg, 0.25 mg/kg, 0.125 mg/kg of sugammadex and placebo. Doses would be based on 
actual body weight. The time taken to reach a TOF ratio of 0.9 thereafter would be measured. If 
the patient fails to achieve this goal by 10 minutes, sugammadex would be given in 2 mg/kg 
increments until the patient reaches this threshold and can be safely extubated. The TOF ratio 
would be measured again at 30 minutes after arrival at the PACU to exclude delayed residual 
NMB with the plan to give further 2 mg/kg doses of sugammadex if detected.
The inclusion of a placebo group would allow us to examine if patients may recover 
spontaneously over that time without needing any sugammadex at all, and what parameters 
may predict that subset of patients. It will also improve the dose response modelling, in that 
randomization has been weighted so that patients who are least likely to need sugammadex 
(i.e. if they achieved a TOF count of 4 twitches without fade) are more likely to be in the 
placebo group or at the lowest dose of sugammadex that is being tested.
The time taken to a TOF ratio of 0.9 after the intervention drug has been given would be 
compared for statistically significant differences, controlling for the:
-TOF count (3 twitches, 4 twitches with fade, 4 twitches without fade), and
-TOF ratio (0 to < 0.9)
15 minutes after neostigmine has been given and prior to giving the intervention drug.
Quantitative neuromuscular monitoring will be carried out using electromyography, which 
measures the TOF ratio every 20 seconds. The TOF count (between 0 to 4) and the TOF ratio (0 
to 1) would be measured and recorded at baseline and after administration of the study drug. If 
the TOF ratio remains < 0.9 after this, or if the patient exhibits any symptoms or signs of 
residual NMB blockade, a further 2 mg/kg dose of sugammadex would be given until the 
patient achieves a TOF ratio of 0.9.

IRB Form BIO 011920227. Statistical Analysis Plan
Power Analysis
An a priori power analysis was conducted using G*Power [IP_ADDRESS] (20).  We used an ANOVA F-
Test for one-way omnibus difference between groups, alpha threshold of 0.05 for rejecting the 
null hypothesis, statistical power of 0.80 and a "very large" effect size of 0.765 was calculated 
based on results from a 2013 randomized controlled trial that examined time from TOF count = 
4 to TOF ratio 1.0 comparing neostigmine to three different doses of sugammadex: 0.5, 1.0, and 
2.0 mg/kg (15).  This gave a required sample size of N=24.  This number was increased to N=36 
to account for patients with poor modeling from a high starting TOFR (resulting in few data 
points for that patient) or incomplete recovery within the maximum ten minutes allotted.  An 
anticipated 70% of those enrolled will become ineligible because of an initial TOFR of 90% or 
greater, thus not requiring any medications, so up to 120 patients may need to be recruited and 
screened, but only 36 will receive any treatment.
Methodology
Randomization will occur with permuted block randomization, divided into 18 groups, to ensure 
proportional allocation of participants in each group over time.  Dose randomization will be 
assigned after stratifying by [CONTACT_845662], with a set number of patients recruited for each group, 
as seen the table below.  This ensures that patients who likely need a lower dose are more 
likely to receive it. Randomization will not occur until participation is assured, i.e., their TOFR is 
<0.90.

Statistical Methodology
Assuming assumptions are valid, an increasing exponential regression model with random 
intercept will be fitted with Time of Four Ratio versus Time, stratified by [CONTACT_845663] (modeled below).  This translates to a slow response initially followed by a more 
rapid response later.  The random intercept will allow for different initial TOFR values.

following six categories: white, black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, 
Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and two or more races. Ethnicity would be 
either Hispanic/Latino or not Hispanic/Latino. This information will not be used as a variable to 
explain differences between participants, but will be presented in Table 1 as part of the study’s 
demographic data, which may help in assessing if the study could be generalized to other 
patient populations in turn.

undergo general anesthesia as well as NMB). 
Patients who are eligible would then be contact[CONTACT_845665] a study team 
member for potential recruitment, at a minimum the day before the date of surgery in order to 
allow enough time for the patient to consider the risks and benefits of participation.

i. Baseline demographics: MRN, date of birth, sex (male/female), race (white, black, 
American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, 
two or more races), ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino, not Hispanic or Latino), weight (kg)
ii. Preoperative details: ASA status (I-IV)
iii. Surgery details: date of surgery, diagnosis, surgery, start case time (hr: min), end case 
time (hr: min)
iv. Anesthesia details: if succinylcholine was used (Y/N), total amount of rocuronium 
given (mg), the last dose of rocuronium that was given (mg), the time that the last 
dose of rocuronium was given (hr:min), neostigmine dose (mg), the time that 
neostigmine was given (hr: min), the time that the study drug was given (hr: min).
v. TOF ratio (0-1)
-Before any paralytic is given at the start of the case
-Before neostigmine is given at the end of the case
-Before the study drug is given
-30 minutes after PACU arrival
vi. TOF count (0-4 ± fade)
-Before neostigmine is given at the end of the case
-Before the study drug is given
vii. The time taken to achieve a TOF ratio of 0.9 (seconds).
viii. Postoperative details: if there was any of the following adverse effects: nausea, 
vomiting, bradycardia, tachycardia, hypotension (Y/N).

neostigmine 
Page 14 of 30  Version: 3 (10/14/2024)
IRB Form BIO 01192022Baseline demographics and postoperative complications will be collected for patients who were 
enrolled but did not meet the study inclusion criteria to receive the intervention drug and their 
data will be used as a control group for the safety outcomes.
The data collection form is in the Emory University REDCap database but a similar form has 
been attached to this protocol as an Excel spreadsheet. Data would be collected by [CONTACT_845666]. Data will be stored on the Emory University REDCap and OneDrive 
databases and may also be sent confidentially between study team members through the 
Emory University Outlook email network. The REDCap and OneDrive databases as well as the 
Outlook email network are all secure, encrypted and password protected. Paper consent forms 
will be stored in a locked box in the principal investigator’s office at Grady Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
All data and records will be retained for at least 6 years following study completion.
Results will be reported in an aggregate form and in a de-identified manner. The form with 
protected health information (date of birth, date of surgery and MRN) will be recorded on a 
form separate to the form with data to be analyzed. Only study team members will have access 
to the form that links the study IDs with protected health information. [CONTACT_845670], the 
biostatistician for the Emory University Department of Anesthesiology, will conduct the data 
analysis in collaboration with the principal investigator.
If a participant declines to participate in all portions of the study, the participant will not be 
assigned a study ID number and the study team members will refrain from collecting any data 
on the participant.  If the participant agrees to participate in some portions of the study but not 
others, the participant will be assigned a study ID number and the study team members will be 
instructed to collect data only on those aspects of the study to which the participant has agreed 
to participate.  These procedures will help prevent unauthorized inclusion of the patient’s data 
in the database.
21. Plans to Monitor the Data to Ensure Safety of Participants and Data Integrity
X More than minimal risk 
Review our Data and Safety Monitoring Questionnaire and insert the relevant monitoring table 
at the end of this section. Also upload the completed questionnaire in the “Basic Study 
Information” smartform section in eIRB, question #8, as a separate document.

IRB Form BIO 01192022☒ High Complexity Category B
The study team will review the safety endpoints (nausea, vomiting, bradycardia, hypotension) 
on a monthly basis for the duration of the study. These safety endpoints are collected at each 
study visit and recorded in the study database. Patients are routinely assessed for these side 
effects in the PACU by [CONTACT_845667]. 
Subgroup n=6 Total N=36

Hypotension 
(high) 0.15 p=0.0059 n≥4 p=0.0048 n≥12
Using the binomial equation (see below), we calculated the probability of seeing a set number 
of patients in each group, if the actual probability in the normal surgical population is at the 
level specified in the 'assumed probability' column.  
For example, if the 'normal' probability of nausea is up to 25% (that is, the risk with treatment is 
the same as the risk under standard surgical conditions), then the chance of having 5 or more 
patients with nausea in any one treatment group is 0.0046, and the chance of having 16 or 
more patients with nausea in total is p=0.0048.  Since this is unlikely, we will reject the null 
hypothesis, and conclude that the actual risk in our trial is actually higher than that.  So if 5 or 
more patients report nausea in any one group or if 16 or more patients report nausea in total, 
this would trigger a suspension of the trial for further review.

22. Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interest of Participants
The research procedures are not beyond what is routinely used in a patient’s intraoperative and 
postoperative anesthetic management. The patient will be given the option to not interact with 
study team members whenever he/she is not comfortable. The research team will contact [CONTACT_845668], and only beyond that if necessary (e.g. if 
there is a significant adverse event that may or may not be related to the study).

25. Setting
This is a single-site study at the Grady Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Potential participants will be 
identified and recruited at the anesthesia pre-admission clinic on site. Research procedures will 
be performed in the main operating room and ambulatory surgery center on site.

IRB Form BIO [PHONE_17592]. Resources Available
The study drug and equipment required for the study are all in routine clinical use at the Grady 
Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. As the inclusion criteria are broad and there is an average of 20-30 cases 
per weekday of elective surgeries requiring tracheal intubation and NMB, we anticipate that 
there would be minimal problems in recruiting the required number of suitable subjects within 
the aforementioned recruitment period. We will be briefing the anesthesiology department 
staff prior to the study commencement on the details of this research study.

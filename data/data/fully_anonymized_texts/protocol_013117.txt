Protocol 2013-[ADDRESS_338443] in cancer incidence and sixth in cancer mortality among 
men (1).  
 
The course of prostate cancer from diagnosis to death is categorized as a series of clinical states 
defined by [CONTACT_277275], hormonal status, and absence or presence of detectable 
metastases on an imaging study. The states are localized disease, rising prostate specific antigen 
(PSA) after local therapy with radiation therapy or surgery, advanced disease with clinical 
metastases that initially respond to androgen ablation therapy, and advanced disease that 
progresses in the presence of androgen deprivation.  PSA is a widely used marker of disease 
progression and response to treatment changes in PSA foretell subsequent changes in 
radiographic evidence of metastases.  The states are recognized by [CONTACT_277276] a clear definition of therapeutic objectives and outcomes. 
 
1.[ADDRESS_338444] common site of metastasis is to bone with 80% of patients 
dying from the disease having bone metastasis. Skeletal metastasis may result in bone pain, 
fractures and bone marrow failure.  Vertebral involvement may create even more morbidity from 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_13377], which if left untreated may result in paralysis.  
 
The androgen receptor (AR) is the primary oncogenic driver of prostate cancer, and the first line 
of therapy of advanced disease is androgen deprivation, historically by [CONTACT_277277], by [CONTACT_277278][INVESTIGATOR_2117]-gonadal axis with luteinizing hormone releasing 
hormone (LHRH) analogues. Second line hormonal therapy, by [CONTACT_277279], 
has shown a tumor response in less than half of castrate patients. This response is not durable, 
with median duration of response approximating 7 months. (2) When prostate cancer develops 
resistance to castration and anti-androgen combinations, a decrease in PSA may be obtained by 
[CONTACT_277280]-androgen therapy. The withdrawal response rate, however, is no higher and the 
duration of response even shorter than other second-line hormonal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
After the failure of hormonal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], chemotherapy may palliate the symptoms of prostate 
cancer for those patients who can tolerate the side effects. Docetaxel confers a survival 
advantage for patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer, with a median survival of 18 
months.  Nonetheless, current treatment for advanced prostate cancer is not curative and the 
Protocol 2013-0933

3 optimal time of administration of chemotherapy remains under active study.  Newer agents 
include Provenge (Sipuleucel-T) a vaccine made from the patient’s own cells primed to the 
prosta
te specific membrane antigen and re-administered to the patient.  As well Abiraterone 
acetate a CYP17 lyase inhibitor has been shown to increase overall survival in the post 
chemotherapy setting.  In addition Xtandi another androgen receptor blocking agent is available 
in the post- docetaxel setting.   
 
Xof
igo (radium 223) was recently approved in the metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer 
patient with symptomatic bone metastasis.  In the phase III study time to first SRE, overall 
survival in the xofigo arm was improved as well, time to total ALP progression, time to PSA 
progr
ession and a total alkaline phosphatase response was statistically significantly longer in the 
radium-223 chloride group compared to placebo (see below for statistical details). 
 
In summary, the current natural history of advanced prostate cancer is comprised of one to 
several years of response to androgen deprivation, several months of response to secondary 
hormonal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and subsequently cytotoxic chemotherapy for a remaining median survival 
ti
me of less than two years. There is a medical need to extend the rate and duration of response 
for chemotherapy while understanding pathways that confer sensitivity or resistance in 
individualized patients. 
 
1.3 Rationale of the study 
B
ased upon the Radium 223, Alpharadin, phase III trial which has been shown to not only 
palliate pain but also shown to increase overall survival as compared to placebo (median OS 14.9 
months versus 11.3 months) in CRPC without decreases in PSA we propose this study to further 
understand the mechanism of Radium-223 and its effects within the tumor microenvironment in 
bone.   
 
These observations outlined above on changes in alkaline phosphatase without significant 
decreases in PSA are consistent with the hypothesis that targeting the bone microenvironment 
(osteoblast and/or osteoclast) is implicated in CRPC progression and provides rationale for 
determining stromal-tumor interactions when exposed to alpharadin.  
 
1.3.1  Pharmacokinetics / pharmacodynamics  
P
harmacodynamics within the tumor microenvironment will be determined through sampling of 
the bone marrow biopsy and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_277260]/plasma.  Please see below for details. 
 
No pharmacokinetics will be performed.  
 
 
Protocol 2013-[ADDRESS_338445] on bone metastases. Ra-223 dichloride mimics calcium and selectively targets bone, 
specifically areas of bone metastases, by [CONTACT_277281]. The high linear energy transfer of alpha emitters (80 keV/micrometer) leads to a 
high frequency of double-strand DNA breaks in adjacent cells, resulting in a potent and localized 
anti-tumor effect. The alpha particle range from radium-223 is less than 100 micrometers (less 
than 10 cell diameters) which minimizes damage to the surrounding normal tissue.  
 
Preclinical 
In single and repeated dose toxicity studies in rats, the main findings were reduced body weight 
gain, hematological changes, reduced serum alkaline phosphatase and microscopic findings in 
the bone marrow (depletion of hematopoietic cells, fibrosis), spleen (secondary extra-medullary 
hematopoiesis) and bone (depletion of osteocytes, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, fibro-osseous lesions, 
disruption/disorganization of the physis/growth line). These findings were related to radiation-
induced impairment of hematopoiesis and a reduction of osteogenesis and occurred beginning in 
the dose range of 20 (0.[ZIP_CODE] mCi) – 80 kBq (0.0022 mCi) per kg body weight, with the 
e
xception of body weight decreases. 
 
Dose-limiting myelotoxicity was seen in dogs after single administration of 450 kBq (0.012 mCi) 
Ra-223 dichloride per kg body weight (9 times the clinically recommended dose).   
Osteosarcomas, a known effect of bone-seeking radionuclides, were observed at clinically 
relevant doses in rats 7 – 12 months after start of treatment. Osteosarcomas were not observed in 
dog
 studies. The presence of neoplastic changes, other than osteosarcomas, was also reported in 
the longer term (12 to 15 months) rat toxicity studies. Due to its mode of action, and as seen with 
conventional radiotherapy and other radiotherapeutics, radium-[ADDRESS_338446] not been performed. 
 
No histological changes were observed in organs involved in the excretion of Ra-223 dichloride. 
No significant effects were seen on vital organ systems, i.e. cardiovascular (dog), respi[INVESTIGATOR_277261] 2013-0933

5 central nervous systems (rat), after single dose administration of 450 to 1000 kBq (0.012  to 
0.027 mCi) per kg body weight (9 (dog) to 20 (rat) times the clinically recommended dose. 
 
Clinical Experience Summary  
The clinical development of Ra-223 dichloride includes phase I and phase II studies in prostate 
cancer patients with bone metastases. The results of these completed studies indicated that safety 
and tolerability of Ra-223 dichloride in CRPC/HRPC patients with bone metastases was we ll 
tolerated, and that there was evidence of dose related efficacy against bone markers and other 
markers of disease. In addition there was an effect on median overall survival in a Phase II (BC1-
02) placebo-controlled study. These studies enabled the initiation of the Phase III ALSYMPCA 
(ALpharadin in SYMptomatic Prostate CAncer) study. 
 
The clinical safety and efficacy of Ra-[ADDRESS_338447] been evaluated in a double-blind, 
randomized, multiple dose, phase III multicenter study (ALSYMPCA) in castration-resistant 
prosta
te cancer patients with bone metastases. The primary efficacy endpoint was Overall 
Survival (OS).  
 
At the cut-off date of the pre-planned interim analysis, a total of 809 patients were randomized 
2:1 to receive Ra-223 dichloride 50 kBq (0.0014 mCi)/kg intravenously every 4 weeks for 6 
cycles (N=541) plus best standard of care or matching placebo plus best standard of care 
(N=268). Best standard of care included (e.g. local external beam radiotherapy, corticosteroids, 
antiandrogens, estrogens, estramustine or ketoconazole). 
 
An updated descriptive analysis of safety and of OS was performed in 921 randomized patients 
prior to implementing crossover (i.e. offering patients in the placebo group to receive Ra-223 
dichloride treatment). 
 
The results of both, interim and updated analysis, revealed that OS was significantly longer in 
patients treated with Ra-[ADDRESS_338448] of care (HR =0.695 (95% CI 0.581/0.832), median OS 14.9 months 
versus 11.3 months, respectively). 
In the ALSYMPCA study, the results of the interim analysis and the updated analysis showed 
also a significant improvement in all main secondary endpoints in the Ra-223 dichloride arm 
compared to the placebo arm: 
 
Time to first SRE (defined as time to EBRT, time to first pathological bone fracture, time to 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_209530]) was statistically significantly longer in

6 the radium-223 chloride group compared to placebo (median number of months=15.6 for 
radium-223 chloride versus 9.8 months for placebo (HR=0.658, 95 CI 0.522–0.830, p= 0.[ZIP_CODE]). 
 
Time to t
otal ALP progression (defined as ≥ 25% increase compared to baseline/nadir) was 
statistically significantly longer in the radium-223 chloride group 7.4 months compared to 
placebo 3.8 months  (HR = 0.167, 95% CI 0.129 – 0.217; p= <0.[ZIP_CODE]). 
 
Time to P
SA progression (defined as a ≥ 25% increase and an increase in absolute value of ≥ 2 
ng/mL compared to baseline/nadir ) was also significantly prolonged in patients receiving Ra-
223 dichloride compared to patients receiving placebo (HR = 0.643, 95% CI 0.539,0.768; p = 
<0.[ZIP_CODE]). 
 
A total ALP  response (defined as a confirmed ≥ 30% or ≥ 50% reduction compared to baseline) 
at week 12 was observed in higher proportions of subjects who were treated with radium-223 
chloride group (47%  and 3% respectively) compared to those in the placebo (3% and <1% 
respectively) group.  
 
Subgroup survival analysis showed a consistent survival benefit for treatment with Ra-223 
dichloride, independent of total alkaline phosphatase (ALP), current use of bisphosphonates, 
prior use of docetaxel and baseline ECOG status. The results from the phase III ALSYMCA 
study regarding time to external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for pain relief and fewer 
patients reporting bone pain as an adverse event in the Ra-[ADDRESS_338449] common hematologic adverse events all grades were anemia (31.2%), neutropenia (5%) 
and thrombocytopenia (11.5%). Most common non-hematologic all grades adverse events 
occurring in more than 15% of patients were: bone pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and 
constipation.

Secondary Malignant Neoplasms 
No cases of radiation-induced cancer have been reported in reported in clinical trials with 
radium-223 dichloride in follow-up of up to three years. However, the radiation dose resulting 
from therapeutic exposure may result in higher incidence of cancer (e.g. sarcomas of the bone, or 
leukemia), mutations and a potential for development of hereditary defects.

biopsies, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_277262], to be 
treated with the standard 6 doses of Alpharadin. 
 
S
econdary Objectives:   
 L ink PSA initial concentration (as defined within PCWG2) to modulation of bone 
markers, in the blood, urine and bone marrow plasma of study patients     
 Esti mate the efficacy and PFS by [CONTACT_43877]2 in study patients 
 De velop a deeply annotated tissue repository for later hypothesis generating associations 
 C orrelative studies in prostate cancer patient-derived mouse models to validate  
predictive and prognostic biomarker associations (SEE APPENDIX E) 
 To e stimate the overall survival in patients with CRPC 
 
3. Study design 
 
This i
s an open label study to determine the effect of Alpharadin on the bone marrow 
microenvironment in patients with CRPC and bone metastases.  We will determine the 
modulation of bone microenvironment as measured by [CONTACT_11084], plasma, urine and bone marrow 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_277263]. The baseline determination and subsequent assessment of bone-prostate 
cancer paracrine signaling will be correlated with PSA decline, progression free survival, overall 
survival and changes in pain indices.   
 
Subjects will be treated with the standard dosing of xofigo (Alpharadin) Ra -223 dichloride 50 
kB
q (0.0014 mCi)/kg intravenously every 4 weeks for 6 cycles (6 doses total).

5.2 Instructions for use / handling  
 
G
eneral Warning 
R
adium [ADDRESS_338452] to the regulations and/or appropriate licenses of the competent official 
organization. Radium 223dichloride should be handled by [CONTACT_30799] a manner which satisfies 
both radiation safety and pharmaceutical quality requirements. Appropriate aseptic precautions 
should be taken. 
 
Radiation Protection  
The administration of Ra-223 dichloride is associated with potential risks for other persons (e.g. 
medical staff, care givers and members of the patient’s family) from radiation or contamination 
from spi[INVESTIGATOR_101393], feces, or vomit. Therefore, radiation protection 
Protocol 2013-[ADDRESS_338453] be taken in accordance with national and local regulations.Radium-223 is 
primarily an alpha emitter, with a 95.3% fraction of energy emitted as alpha-particles. The 
fraction emitted as beta-particles is 3.6%, and the fraction emitted as gamma-radiation is 1.1%. 
The external radiation exposure associated with handling of patient doses is considerably lower 
in comparison to other radiopharmaceuticals for therapeutic purposes as the administered 
radioactivity will usually be below 8 MBq (0.216 mCi). In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_277266] (ALARA) principle, for minimization of radiation exposure, it is 
recommended to minimize the time spent in radiation areas, to maximize the distance to 
radiation sources, and to use adequate shielding. Any unused product or materials used in 
connection with the preparation or administration are to be treated as radioactive waste and 
should be disposed of in accordance with local regulations. 
 
The gamma radiation associated with the decay of radium-[ADDRESS_338454] been received by [CONTACT_456], a vial of Ra-223 dichloride for technical use will be 
sent to the study center. 
 
Different clinical study centers possess dose calibrators from various suppliers; thus, the isotope 
calibration factor may differ from center to center. Consequently, each center must perform the 
Ra-223 dichloride dial setting on their relevant dose calibrator(s). For dial setting, the clinical 
study center will receive a sealed vial containing a Ra-223 dichloride solution for calibration 
only. The vial is identical to the vials used for study treatment. The amount of Ra-223 dichloride 
in the vial will be stated on the label. Instructions for the dial setting, including the calibration 
log form, will be enclosed with the dispatch of the calibration sample. 
 
Dosimetry 
The absorbed radiation dose calculation was performed based on clinical biodistribution data. 
Calculations of absorbed doses were performed using OLINDA/EXM (Organ Level INternal 
Dose Assessment/EXponential Modeling), a software based on the Medical Internal Radiation 
Dose
 (MIRD) algorithm, which is widely used for established beta and gamma emitting 
radionuclides. For radium-223, which is primarily an alpha emitter, additional assumptions were 
made for the intestine, red marrow and bone/osteogenic cells to provide the best possible 
absorbed dose calculations for Ra-223 dichloride, considering its observed biodistribution and

For an administered activity of 3.65 MBq (0.0987 mCi) (50 kBq (0.[ZIP_CODE] mCi) per kg body 
weight to a 73-kg adult), the calculated absorbed doses to the bone (osteogenic cells) is 4.2050 
Gy (420.5 rad) and to the red marrow is 0.5066 Gy (50.66 rad). The calculated absorbed doses to 
the main excretory organs are 0.0265 Gy (2.65 rad) for the small intestine wall, 0.1180 Gy (11.8 
rad) for the upper large intestine wall and 0.1696 Gy (16.96 rad) for the lower large intestine 
wall.  
 
The calculated absorbed doses to other organs are low, e.g. heart wall (0.0063 Gy, 0.63 rad), 
lung (0.0003 Gy, 0.03 rad), liver (0.0109 Gy, 1.09 rad), kidneys (0.0117 Gy, 1.17 rad), urinary 
bladder wall (0.0147 Gy, 1.47 rad), testes (0.0003 Gy, 0.03 rad), and spleen (0.0003 Gy, 0.03 
rad).  
 
The hematological adverse drug reactions observed in the clinical studies with  Ra - [ADDRESS_338455] responsibility as assigned from the Primary Investigator for handling and storage of 
Ra-223 dichloride. All administrations of Ra-223 dichloride are based on the certified activity of 
Ra-223 dichloride at the calibration date. 
 
Dose Calculation 
The
 dosage of Ra-223 dichloride is 50 kBq/kg body weight. The total activity to be injected will 
be calculated volumetrically using the patient’s body weight on the day of injection (kg), the 50 
kBq/kg body weight dosage level, and the decay correction factor (DK) to correct for physical 
decay of Ra-223 dichloride. A table with DK values according to physical decay of the study 
medication will be provided with each vial of Ra-223 dichloride. The total amount (volume to be 
drawn into the syringe) to be administered to a patient should be calculated as follows: 
Body weight (kg) x50 kBq/kg = volume to be injected (mL)    
DK
 x 1000 kBq/mL   
Data regarding activity should be recorded on the appropriate electronic case report form (eCRF) 
page.

15 Dose Preparation 
Personnel should use appropriate protective clothing and equipment during syringe filling and 
application to prevent contamination with the radioactive solution (medical gloves / protective 
g
lasses). The individual responsible for study drug preparation will draw the correct volume of 
study drug into a syringe. The size of the syringe should be chosen according to the applied 
volume to reach the required dosing accuracy. Ra-223 dichloride should not be diluted or mixed 
with any solutions. Do not store above 40°C (104°F). If the vials have been stored in a 
refrigerator, they should be left at room temperature for [ADDRESS_338456] be well hydrated; the patient should be 
instructed to drink ad libitum. Aseptic technique should be used in the administration of Ra-223 
dichloride. The syringe should be handed over to the individual who will perform the injection. 
The study medication will be administered by [CONTACT_67481] 1 minute . After 
administration, the equipment used in connection with the preparation and administration of drug 
is to be treated as radioactive waste and should be disposed in accordance with local procedure 
for the handling of radioactive material.  
 
 
Drug logistics and Accountability 
All study drugs will be stored at the investigational site in accordance with Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) requirements and the instructions 
given by [CONTACT_115159]. 
 
Accountability 
The
 investigator, or a responsible party designated by [CONTACT_093], must maintain a careful 
record of the inventory and disposition of the agent (investigational or free of charge) using the 
NCI Drug Accountability Record or another comparable drug accountability form. (See the 
CTEP website at http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment  for the “Policy and Guidelines for 
Accountability and Storage of Investigational Agents” or to obtain a copy of the drug 
a
ccountability form.) 
 
Destruction and Return 
At the end of the study, unused supplies of Ra [ADDRESS_338457] may be discontinued from the trial for non-compliance 
with follow-up visits or study drug. 
 
 
 
6. Dose Modification and Concomitant Medications 
Eve
ry effort should be made to administer the full dosing regimen of Ra-223 dichloride.  
Adjustment of dose level is not permitted.   
 
Study visits during the treatment period should occur at 4 weeks intervals (within a window of 
+/- 7 days).  Dosing delays may be instituted under the following circumstances: 
 
Dise
ase progression: 
 
The Investigator should delay cytotoxic chemotherapy, other systemic radioisotope, hemibody 
external radiotherapy or other investigational drug until the follow-up period.  If such treatments 
have to be given during the treatment period, further study drug administrations must be 
discontinued.  Patients with disease progression may continue treatment at the Investigator’s 
discretion.  
 
Myelosuppression:   
Treatment-related changes in hematology parameters may occur. 
•   If a patient experiences CTCAE v4.03 Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or 
anemia the administration of study drug should be delayed until recovery to Grade 2 or 
better.  
•  If a patient experiences CTCAE v4.03 Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, or 
anemia lasting > [ADDRESS_338458] be discontinued.  
•   Blood transfusion is acceptable between study drug administrations but not prior to the start 
of the
 study.  Use of biologic response modifiers, such as G-CSF or GM-CSF, is allowed in 
the ma
nagement of acute toxicity. 
 
Gastrointestinal events: 
Protocol 2013-[ADDRESS_338459] Compression: 
If the patient experiences spi[INVESTIGATOR_209534], the patient should 
be treated for the event, and may receive further study drug administration if adequately 
recovered.  
 
 
 
Surgical Intervention: 
If surgery is required, the patient should continue with study treatment, if this is considered safe 
in t
he treating Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649].  The surgeon needs to be notified that the patient has been 
given radioactive drug, and needs to follow the guidelines for radioactive protection.   
 
Non-pathological fractures: 
For traumatic fractures in weight-bearing bones during treatment phase, the study drug 
administration should be delayed for 2-4 weeks from the time of fracture.  
 
Pathological fractures: 
Pathological fractures may occur as the result of either progressive disease or increased physical 
activity associated with significant pain palliation.  Pathologic fractures are to be treated in a 
manner that attempts to maintain the best functional status and quality of life. Study treatment 
may continue as planned. 
 
Any Other Toxicity:   
Local practice will apply. 
 
6.[ADDRESS_338460]’s welfare, and which is not expected 
to interfere with the evaluation of the study treatment, may be given at the discretion of the 
investigator.  All medications (including contrast media) taken within [ADDRESS_338461]’s source documentation and in 
the CRF (including start/stop dates, dose frequency, route of administration, and indication). 
Permitted

18 • Treatment with non-conventional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (e.g., herbs [with the exception of St. John’s 
W
art], acupuncture) and vitamin/mineral supplements is acceptable provided that, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], such treatment will not interfere with the trial endpoints. 
• Subjects may receive standard of care for any underlying illness. 
• In the event of neutropenia, anemia, or thrombocytopenia, subjects may receive appropriate 
supportive c
are (e.g., transfusion, biologic response modifiers such as G-CSF or GM-CSF, 
prophylactic antibiotics, antifungals and/or antivirals, hematopoietic growth factors).  This 
supportive care should not substitute a recommended dose modification. 
• Blood transfusions and erythropoietin are allowed during the study period but not within [ADDRESS_338462] dose of study drug.  
• If surgery is required during study drug treatment, the surgeon needs to be notified that the 
pa
tient has been treated with a radioactive product and adequate precautions for radioactive 
protection should be applied during the surgical procedure.  The patient should continue with 
study treatment if considered safe in the treating Investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. 
• Concomitant treatments for prostate cancer will be recorded in the CRFs. These treatments 
ma
y include, but are not necessarily limited to: Luteinizing-Hormone-Releasing hormone 
(LHRH) analogs, surgery, radiation therapy, flutamide, bicalutamide, nilutamide, 
cyproterone acetate, estramustine, ketoconazole, corticosteroids, estrogens, and abiraterone.

8. Adverse Event Reporting 
 
8.1 Serious Adverse Event Reporting (SAE)  
An a
dverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either 
the investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
 De ath 
 A life -threatening adverse drug experience –  any adverse experience that places the patient, 
in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse experience as it 
occurred. It does not include an adverse experience that, had it occurred in a more severe 
form, might have caused death. 
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
 A pe rsistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions. 
 A c ongenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse (21 CFR 312.32) 
 
 I mportant medical events as defined above may also be considered serious adverse events. 
Any important medical event can and should be reported as an SAE if deemed appropriate by 
[CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_9476], IND Office. 
 All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the definition of a SAE 
must be reported to the IRB in accordance with the timeframes and procedures outlined in 
“The University of [LOCATION_007] M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board Policy 
for Investigators on Reporting Serious Unanticipated Adverse Events for Drugs and 
Devices”.  Unless stated otherwise in the protocol, all SAEs, expected or unexpected, must 
Protocol 2013-0933 
Ma
rch 24, 2016 
Page 21 
 
21 be reported to the IND Office, regardless of attribution (within 5 working days of knowledge 
of the event). 
 All l ife-threatening or fatal events, that are unexpected, and related  to the study drug, must 
ha
ve a written report submitted within 24 hours (next working day) of knowledge of the 
event to the Safety Project Manager in the IND Office.   
 Unle ss otherwise noted, the electronic SAE application (eSAE) will be utilized for safety 
reporting to the IND Office and MDACC IRB.  
 S erious adverse events will be captured from the time of the first protocol-specific 
intervention, until [ADDRESS_338465] returned to baseline, progression of the event has stabilized, or there has 
been acceptable resolution of the event. 
 Additi onally, any serious adverse events that occur after the [ADDRESS_338466] be reported to the IND Office. This may include the 
development of a secondary malignancy. 
 
Reporting to FDA: 
 Serious adverse events will be forwarded to FDA by [CONTACT_9533] (Safety Project 
Manager IND Office) according to 21 CFR 312.32. 
 
It is the responsibility of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_195697], Good Clinical Practices, the protocol 
guidelines, the sponsor’s guidelines, and Institutional Review Board policy. 
 
8.2 Reporting of Adverse Events 
Adverse Events will be documented according to the Recommended Adverse Event Recording 
Guidelines for Phase II protocol (see table below).

8.3 Reporting Requirements to Supporting Company: 
 
This t
rial will use the NCI-CTCAE v4.[ADDRESS_338467] to toxicity grade.  
 
 
8.3.1  Adverse events  
Investigators should refer to the Safety Information section of the current IB for Ra 223 
dichloride, including the DCSI (development core safety information), for the expected side 
effects of Ra [ADDRESS_338468]’s source documentation. 
Subjects must be carefully monitored for AEs.  This monitoring also includes clinical laboratory 
tests.  Adverse events should be assessed in terms of their seriousness, intensity, and relationship 
to the study drug, or other chemotherapy/treatment. 
 
8.3.[ADDRESS_338469] be followed up until resolution or stabilization, by [CONTACT_209562]. An isolated laboratory abnormality that is assigned 
Protocol 2013-0933 
Ma
rch 24, 2016 
Page 23 
 
23 grade 4, according to CTC definition, is not reportable as an SAE; unless the investigator 
assesses that the event meets standard ICH criteria for an SAE.  CTC grade 4 baseline laboratory 
a
bnormalities that are part of the disease profile should not be reported as an SAE, specifically 
when they are allowed or not excluded by [CONTACT_39719]/exclusion criteria.   
 
All serious adverse events should be reported to Bayer within [ADDRESS_338470] for reporting 
procedures. 
 
The Investigator may report serious adverse drug reactions (SADRs) using the MD Anderson 
Adve
rse Event Form.  
 
All reports shall be sent electronically to:  
 
Electronic Mailbox:   [EMAIL_772]  
 
Reports for all Bayer products can also be phoned in via our Clinical Communications Dept:  
 
Phone:    [PHONE_2341] 
 
8.3.4 Progressive disease 
I
f progressive disease leads to signs and symptoms that meet the criteria for an SAE (i.e., 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], disability, death, or important medical event), the signs and symptoms should be 
reported as an SAE and not the underlying progressive disease. 
 
Death 
If any subject dies during the trial or within [ADDRESS_338471] the cause of death in detail (using the SAE Form) within [ADDRESS_338472] be withdrawn from the trial (treatment and procedures) for the following reasons:  
• Subject withdraws consent from study treatment and study procedures.  A subject must be 
removed from the trial at his/her own request or at the request of his/her legally acceptable 
representative.  At any time during the trial and without giving reasons, a subject may decline 
to participate further.  The subject will not suffer any disadvantage as a result. 
• Subject is lost to follow-up.  
• Death. 
 

Protocol 2013-0933 
Ma
rch 24, 2016 
Page 24 
 
24 Subjects may be withdrawn from the study for the following reasons: 
• The subject is non-compliant with study drug, trial procedures, or both; including the use of 
a
nti-cancer therapy not prescribed by [CONTACT_4690]. 
• If, in the investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], continuation of the trial would be harmful to the subject's 
we
ll-being. 
• The development of a second cancer.  
• Development of an intercurrent illness or situation which would, in the judgment of the 
investi
gator, significantly affect assessments of clinical status and trial endpoints. 
• Deterioration of ECOG performance status to 4. 
• Use of illicit drugs or other substances that may, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], have a 
re
asonable chance of contributing to toxicity or otherwise skewing trial result. 
 
Any subject removed from the trial will remain under medical supervision until discharge or 
transfer is medically acceptable. 
 
In all cases, the reason for withdrawal must be recorded in the CRF and in the subject's medical 
records. 
 
9.1 Screen Failures/Dropouts 
A subje
ct who discontinues study participation prematurely for any reason is defined as a 
“dropout” if the subject has already been randomized; assigned to treatment/run-in/wash-out; 
a
dminister at least one dose of study drug. 
 
A subject who, for any reason (e.g. failure to satisfy the selection criteria), terminates the study 
before the time point used for the definition of “dropout” (see above) is regarded a “screening 
failure”. 
 
9.2 Replacement 
No w
ithdrawn subjects will be replaced.  
 
 
10. Statistical Considerations 
 
10.1 Analysis sets  
Full population:  
All enrolled patients will be used for demographic reporting and calculations of the numbers of 
patients able to complete the planned schedule and be evaluable for serum and bone marrow 
mar
ker studies. 
 
Protocol 2013-0933 
Ma
rch 24, 2016 
Page 25 
 
25 Evaluable for Serum Markers: 
All patients who have usable baseline and at least one post-baseline serum draws will be 
evaluable for analysis of serum markers. 
 
Evaluable for Bone Marrow Markers:   
All patients who have usable baseline and at least one post-baseline bone marrow biopsy will be 
evaluable for analyses of bone marrow markers. 
 
Toxicity:   
All patients who receive a bone marrow biopsy will be evaluable for toxicity.    
 
10.2 Variables 
Overall survival (OS): 
OS will be measured as the number of months from enrollment until death.  Patients who are 
alive at the time of database lock will be censored on the date of last contact. 
   
Progression-free survival (PFS): 
PFS will be measured as the number of months from enrollment until progression or death, 
whichever comes first.  Patients who are alive and free of progression at their last response 
evaluation will be censored on that date.  Progression will be defined by [CONTACT_277285]2. 
 
Demographic variables: 
Age at enrollment, race, ethnicity, ECOG status, extent of bone disease (< 6, 6 -20, >20)  
 
PD Effects: 
Tumor/osteoblast/osteoclast, Ki-67, gamma H2AX, cleaved PRP, cytokeratin/PSA, BALP, and 
TRAP
 
 
Serum biomarkers: 
ALP, BALP, APG, RANKL, OPN, OC, CTX, PI[INVESTIGATOR_277268]:   
Alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, DMP, sclerostin, tenascin, periostin, lumican, decorin, 
osteopontin, osteonectin, nidogen-1, TGFb-induced protein ig-h3. 
 
10.3 Descriptive Statistics   
Patient demographics and medical status at study enrollment will be tabulated for all enrolled 
patients.  Descriptive plots and summaries of adverse events (AE), PD measures, as well as 
Protocol 2013-[ADDRESS_338473] a 
30% increase or decrease in any marker will be presented.  AEs will be reported by [CONTACT_277286] (therapy and blood draws and biopsies all constitute study 
interventions).   
 
10.[ADDRESS_338474] 30%, stayed with 
30% of baseline, or increased by [CONTACT_2669] 30%.  Currently there is no knowledge of how the 
planned PD, serum, and bone marrow markers may predict overall survival.  Exploratory 
analyses described below will be performed on the continuous values of the markers, changes, in 
the markers as continuous measures, and the classification strategy described here.   
16.3.3 Survival Analysis.   
 
Overall (OS) and progression-free (PFS) survival will be calculated from the date of study 
enrollment and will include all enrolled patients.  Survival analyses will be performed when 90% 
of patients have died or [ADDRESS_338475].  Plots of all patients and subgroups identified by [CONTACT_277287] (described below) will 
be presented using the methods of Kaplan and Meier.   
 
10.[ADDRESS_338476], the baseline values will be used to 
determine if the baseline is associated with survival.  Next we will calculate the percent change 
from baseline and use that as a continuous measure in the model.  The ordered category of 
reduced by 30%, same, or increased by 30% groupi[INVESTIGATOR_277269].  Finally, all 
observed values of the marker will be included as a time-varying covariate in the Cox regression 
model.  Since this is an observational study to identify potential usefulness of biomarkers in 
predicting overall survival, no formal adjustments for multiple testing will be needed for future 
trial planning.  However, for publication, only markers with a significance level of  ≤0.[ADDRESS_338477].  Additional regression-tree style partitioning may be 
performed to identify potentially meaningful cutpoints for combinations of markers.  Cutpoints 
will be examined together with demographic and medical status variables.  This will be purely 
exploratory and will need to be confirmed in an independent data set in a future trial.

therapy will be considered too toxic for future studies.

power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.57 for a continuous biomarker as associated with 
survival at a 2-sided 5% significance level if the standard deviation of the biomarker is 1.25.  
With wider spread of the biomarker values, smaller HRs can be detected.  For example, if the 
standard deviation is 1.5, then a HR of 1.45 could similarly be detected as significant. 
 
11. Data and Protocol Management 
 
11.1 Registration Procedure and Data Reporting  
All data
 will be entered to the Department of Genitourinary Medical Oncology Oracle database 
(GURU).  GURU is a password protected database with an audit trail. Data can be collated with 
a
 unique GURU identification in order to de-link information.  The minimum required fields will 
be
 entered to the MDACC required data collection systems (CORe/PDMS). Registration data 
e
ntry will occur prior to initiation of therapy. All eligibility criteria must be satisfied.Reporting to 
the suppor
ting agency will follow the contract agreement.

is enrolled in the study.  
 
11.3 Audit and Inspection 
I
nspections by [CONTACT_209567] i.e. FDA and IEC(s)/IRB(s) are 
possible.  The investigator should notify Bayer immediately of any such inspection. 
 
Protocol 2013-[ADDRESS_338483] thirty days in advance of submission in order to obtain approval prior to submission of the 
final version for publication or congress presentation.  This will be reviewed promptly and 
approval will not be withheld unreasonably.  In case of a difference of opi[INVESTIGATOR_277273](s), the contents of the publication will be discussed in order to find a 
solution which satisfies both parties. All relevant aspects regarding data reporting and 
publication will be part of the contract between Bayer and the investigator/institution

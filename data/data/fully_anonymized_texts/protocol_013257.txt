3/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 PROTOCOL AMENDMENT, VERSION 3: 
RATIONALE  
Protocol BN43546 has been primarily amended to include Sponsor -initiated 
modifications including the reduction of the sample size, an update  to the QT interval 
corrected through use of Fridericia's formula ( QTcF ) monitoring, and the removal of the 
planned interim analysis.  Changes to the protocol, along with a rationale for each 
change, are summarized below:  
• Personal identifiable information (i.e., name [CONTACT_41319]) for the Medical 
Monitor has been removed from the protocol (Protocol title page, protocol 
acceptance form, and Section 8.3.8).  Medical Monitor contact [CONTACT_580989] a sentence indicating that this information will be provided separately 
to sites.  
• The protocol synopsis has been simplified to align with  Clinical Trial Regulation and 
other guidelines (Section 1.1).  
• The sample size has been reduced from 252 participants to 30  participants to 
investigate the objectives of the study with a reduced scope  (Sections 1.2, 4.1.2, 5, 
and 9.2; Appendix A1− 5) and the following changes have been made as a result:  
– The objectives of this study have been revised from "evaluate" to "investigate" as the reduced sample size precludes formal comparisons (Section 3).  
– The description of the primary estimand, statistical hypothesis, and primary, secondary, and exploratory analysis methodologies have been removed as all 
analyses will be conducted using descriptive statistics (Section 3, 9.1, 9.4.2, 
[IP_ADDRESS], and 9.4. 4). 
– The estimated time to complete enrollment has been updated from 
approximately 13 or 15  months to 9 months (Sections 4.1 and 4.4).  
– The planned and optional interim analyses have been removed (Sections 4.1, 9.4, 9.5.1, and 9.5.2).  
– The total length of the  study has been updated from approximately 18 months 
to 13  months (Section 4.4).  
– The number of sites has been reduced from 25 to 12 (Appendix A1− 5). 
• Guidance has been added to clarify that  if a participant cannot be reached during 
the telephone visits, at least [ADDRESS_763902] 
occur  (Section  1.3). 
• To align with the protocol text, the footnote for measurement of vital signs in the 
schedule of activities has been updated to include guidance that t hree consecutive 
blood pressure readings will be recorded at intervals of at least 1 minute and t he 
average of the three  blood pressure readings will be recorded on the eCRF 
(Section 1.3). 
• Guidance has been added to provide instructions for participants who need to take their daily dose at a different time of the day and for  missed doses  (Section s 1.3 and 
6.1). 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
4/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 • The exclusion criteri on for ECG abnormality has been updated to clarif y that the two 
consecutive measurements of the ECGs  during screening should be taken 
approxim ately 30 minutes apart and the second measurement is only taken if it is 
necessary to confirm initial ECG abnormality.  The exclusion criterion has also been 
updated to include a separate QTcF threshold of ≥  [ADDRESS_763903] of care QTcF thresholds  (Section  5.2). 
• Text has been added to specify that  tobacco us e is permitted during the study and 
to provide examples of nicotine and tobacco us e (Section 5.3.2) . 
• A s all analysis will now be  conducted by [CONTACT_580990], 
text has been added to specify that some  individuals from the Sponsor may have 
access to unblinded data as needed for ongoing analysis but the core study team with direct site contact [CONTACT_580991].  
Additionally, text regarding access to blinded data through a secure data sharing platform by [CONTACT_580992] (Section 6.3.2) . 
• The responsibilities of the investigator and the role of the Medical Monitor during 
study conduct have been clarified (Sections  6.8, [IP_ADDRESS], and 8.2.5 ; 
Appendix  A6−2.2). 
• It has been clarified that there is no preclinical or clinical evidence that balovaptan 
administration is associated with an increase in abnormal liver tests (Section 7.1.1). 
• The email address for withdrawal from the Research Biosample Repository after site 
closure has been corrected (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) . 
• A description of the technical and organizational security measures taken to protect personal data has been added to ali gn with CTR requirements  (Appendix A1− 4). 
• Due to certain local requirements and an alignment of Sponsor process, it has been clarified that summaries of clinical study results may be available in health authority 
databases for public access in addition to redacted Clinical Study Reports 
(Appendix A1− 6). 
• The Sponsor record retention policy has been clarified (Appendix A1− 7).  
• The descriptions of potential risks associated with balovaptan has been updated to 
include a clinical study in pediatric participants (Study  BP30153) at 10 mg or an 
equivalent dose based on predicted exposure of balovaptan (Appendices  A6−1.2 
and A6− 1.5). 
 
Additional minor changes have been made to improve clarity and consistency.

STUDY RATIONALE  
The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of balovaptan, a vasopressin 1a 
(V1a) receptor antagonist, in participants with post -traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  Treatment 
options for PTSD include trauma- focused (TF) psychological interventions, such as cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacological treatments, including antidepressant s (selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs] and serotonin and norepi[INVESTIGATOR_5608] [SNRIs]).  The overall response rate with these interventions is limited, and there continues to be a need for treatments with better benefit -risk profiles that target the core symptoms of PTSD.    
OBJECTIVES AND ENDPO INTS  AND ESTIMANDS  
This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of 10 mg once a day (QD) 
balovaptan compared with placebo in participants with PTSD.  Specific primary and secondary objectives and corresponding endpoints for the study are outlined below.

OVERALL DESIGN  
Study BN43546 is a Phase II, randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled, two-arm, 
parallel -group, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 10 mg of oral balovaptan 
QD in adults with PTSD.

Phase : Phase II Population Type : Adult patients  
Control Method:  Placebo  Population Diagnosis 
or Condition: Post-traumatic stress 
disorder  
Interventional Model:  Parallel  Population Age:  18-[ADDRESS_763909] Compound:  Balovaptan  Site Distribution: Multi -site 
Active Comparator:  Not applicable  Study Intervention Assignment Method:  Randomization and stratification  
Number of Arms:  2 Number of Participants to Be Enrolled:  Approximately [ADDRESS_763910] (IMP) for this study is balovaptan and placebo.  
One tablet of study drug (10 mg of balovaptan or placebo) should be taken orally QD at home at 
the same time each day, preferably  in the morning, with or without food.  The tablet should be 
swallowed whole with something to drink .  
Participants who need to take their study drug at a time of day outside of their usual routine 
may do so (e.g., participant typi[INVESTIGATOR_580944], but due to an unforeseen scheduling conflict cannot take their medication until the afternoon), but only one 
dose may be taken each day.  If a dose is missed, the participant should make a note to report 
this missed dose to the site at their next contact.  A missed dose of study treatment must not 
be made up the next day.  
The first dose of the study drug will be administered on Day [ADDRESS_763911] been conducted.  At subsequent visits at Weeks 2 and 12 (except for the Week 6 visit), the study drug will be administered after all protocol -mandated study assessments have been 
completed.  
Modification of the balovaptan or placebo dose is not permitted.  
DURATION OF PARTICIP ATION  
The total duration of study participation for each individual is expected to be approximately 18 weeks .

Notes:  On treatment days, all assessments should be performed prior to dosing, unless otherwise specified.  
The visit window is ± 3 days, and all assessments should be completed within the visit window.  Following any visit that may occur outside of 
allowable visit window, p articipants should return to the initial planned schedule (per randomization as Day 1)  for all subsequent visits.  For 
participants who terminate early, assessments listed under the early discontinuation visit should be completed.  For safety follow up, the visit 
window is −3/+7 days and all safety assessments should be completed within the visit window.  
Unscheduled visits may be performed if clinically indicated.  The following assessments should be performed at a minimum: concomitant 
medications, adverse events, and vital signs.  Additional safety assessments may be performed as clinically indicated, per investigator discretion.  
a A safety follow -up visit must occur for all participants at [ADDRESS_763912] study treatment dose.

22/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 2. INTRODUCTION  
2.1 STUDY RATIONALE  
The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of balovaptan, a 
vasopressin 1a (V1a) receptor antagonist, in partic ipants with post -traumatic st ress 
disorder (PTSD).  Treatment  options for PTSD include trauma -focused  (TF) 
psychological interventions, such as cognitive -behavioral therapy (CBT) and 
pharmacological treatments, including antidepressants ( selectiv e serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors  [SSRIs ] and serotonin and norepi[INVESTIGATOR_5608] [ SNRIs ]).  The 
overall response rate with these interventions is limited, and there continues to be a 
need for treatments with better benefit −risk profiles that target the core symptoms of 
PTSD .  Patients with PTSD suffer  from a cluster of debilitating symptoms that have a 
profound effect on many aspects of their lives.  
2.2 BACKGROUND  
PTSD  is a chronic impairment disorder that occurs after exposure to severe stressors 
(e.g., combat, natural disaster, or other traumatic events ) (Miao et al. 2018) .  It is 
characterized by [INVESTIGATOR_1312]- experiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal symptoms, as well as 
negative alterations in cognition and arousal .  These symptoms can lead to disturbances 
to the individual and their family, as well as significant medical, financial , and social 
problems.  
Re-experiencing symptoms manifest as one of the following:  recurrent, distressing 
recollections in the form of thoughts, perceptions, or dreams ; feeling as if the traumatic 
event is happening again accompanied by [CONTACT_580996], halluc inations, and dissociative 
flashbacks ; or intense psychological distress or physiological reactivity when exposed to 
internal or external cues reminiscent of the traumatic event(s)  (American Psychiatric 
Association [APA] 2013; Jellestad et al. 2021).  Avoidance symptoms are characterized 
by [CONTACT_580997], feelings, conversation, activities, places , or things that 
remind the individual of the traumatic event(s), as well as marked decrease in affect.  
Individuals with PTSD demonstrate negative alterations in mood and elevated levels of 
arousal, including problems initiating and maintaining sleep, increased irritability, 
hypervigilance, and hyperactive startle response, as well as difficulty concentrating. 
These symptoms can often lead to clinically significant distress and significant impairments in daily functioning . 
A diagnosis, per Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Version 5 
(DSM -5) criteria, includes  exposure to trauma and this trauma is persistently 
experienced through unwanted memory intrusions, nightmares, flashbacks, and emotional distress following an exposure to traumatic reminders  (APA 2013) .  In 
addition, individuals avoid trauma -related stimuli and demonstrate negative alterations in 
cognition and mood, which may include overly negative thoughts about oneself  and 
exaggerated blame of self or others for causing the trauma or negative affect.   
 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
23/Protocol BN43546, Version [ADDRESS_763917] month following exposure to trauma (Bryant et al. 2016).  In order to 
meet the criteria, an individual must present with at least nine symptoms from the 
categories of intrusion, negative mood, dissociation, avoidance, and arousal.  These symptoms present at the beginning of the traumatic event or if these symptoms are pre-existing, then they worsen after the traumatic event.  The duration of the disturbance 
is 3 days to 1 month following a trauma exposure.   Although acute stress disorder  and 
PTSD share similar requirements for diagnosis, there is a clear differentiation such that PTSD diagnosis requires meeting a certain number of symptoms within established clusters.  This includes non− fear-based symptoms and a dissociative subtype, and the 
symptoms persist for longer than 1 month.   
PTSD  is generally associated with co- occurring psychiatric disorders  and approximately 
80% of patients with PTSD meet criteria for at least one other psychiatric  condition 
(Brady 1997).  The most common comorbidities are depression, alcohol and substance 
use disorders,  anxiety disorders, physical health problems, and cognitive impairment 
(Kessler et al. 1995; Qureshi  et al. 2011; Paccella et al. 2013 ).  Common psy chiatric 
comorbidities exacerbate PTSD symptoms and increase functional impairment (Ikin et al. 2010; Drapkin et al. 2011).  
The National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS -R), which was conducted between 
2001 and 2003, estimated the lifetime prevalence of  PTSD among adult Americans to be 
6.8%  (NCS -R 2007a , 2007b) .  The lifetime prevalence of PTSD among men was 3.6% 
and among women was 9.7%.  The reported prevalence of  PTSD ranges from 5.4 % to 
16.8% among military service members and veterans, which is higher than among the 
general population (Miao et al. 2018).   Genetic and epi[INVESTIGATOR_580946] 70% of the individual differences in PTSD development, with PTSD heritability estimated at 30%.  
Most guidelines strongly recommend  TF-psych ological interventions as treatment 
options  for PTSD , including CBT, cognitive -processing therapy (CPT), cognitive therapy 
(CT), cognitive restructuring (CR), copi[INVESTIGATOR_580947] (including stress  inoculation 
therapy), exposure- based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], eye movement desensitization and reprocessing 
(EMDR), hypnosis and hypnotherapy, and brief eclectic psychotherapy  (APA 2017) .  
Individual TF- CBT and EMDR have shown to be effective in reducing PTSD symptom 
severity (Bisson et al. 2013; Coventry et al. 2020).  However , the quality of evidence 
showing superiority of TF- CBT and EMDR over waitlist  and/or usual care comparison is 
low (Bisson et al. 2013).  Furthermore, although psychological interventions have shown 
success in alleviating symptoms, there is no evidence for  a significant improvement in 
affect dysregulation (Coventry et al. 2020).  Additionally, psychological interventions, 
such as TF- CBT, EMDR, and mindfulness, do not show a maintenance of treatment 
effects at the 6-month follow up in veterans (Coventry et al. 2020).  Various 
psychological interventions also show high dropout rates, with one review finding up to 54% (Schottenbauer et al. 2008) and another up to 65% (Lewis et  al. 2020).  
 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
24/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 Furthermore, TF- therapi[INVESTIGATOR_580948] a significantly higher dropout rate com pared with 
non-TF therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (Lewis et al. 2020).  This could be reflective of patients’ psychological 
preparedness to confront their trauma.    
Pharmacological treatments for PTSD include antidepressants , such as SSRIs, SNRIs, 
and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, sympatholytic drugs such as alpha- blockers, 
antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, and benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] (Coventry et al. 2020; Hoskins et 
al. 2015; Stein et al. 2006;  Davidson et al. 2006a; Davidson et al. 2006b).  The (U.S.) 
Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) has approved two SSRIs for the treatment of 
PTSD:  sertraline and paroxetine.  These SSRIs primarily act upon the serotonin 
neurotransmitter system and have the strongest empi[INVESTIGATOR_33727].  Overall response rates with the use of SSRIs rarely exceed 60% in patients with PTSD and less than 20% −30% of patients achieve complete remission (Stein et al. 2002; Zohar et al. 2002).   
Other medications  which are not approved for treatment of PTSD , such as  fluoxetine, 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_052], risperidone, and venlafaxine, are also used in clinical practice.   Maintenance 
of effect is also only observed through continued treatment , which suggests that the 
medication is addressing symptoms rather than the underlying source of the disorder 
(Asnis et al. 2004).  Beyond SSRIs, a number of different research avenues have been explored, including prazosin and d- cycloserine but although some positive signals in 
small studies have been observed, these have typi[INVESTIGATOR_580949] (de Kleine et al. 2012; Germain et al. 2012; Raskind et al. 2018) .  
Patients with PTSD often receive treatment with multiple agents that often lack evidence 
of benefit , including diverse antidepressants, anxiolytics, mood stabilizers and 
antipsychotics (Davidson and Connor 1999; Keane et al. 2006; Miao et al. 2018) . 
Balovaptan is a brain penetrant, potent , and highly  selective  human V1 a receptor 
antagonist  that blocks  the activati on of the V1a G protein− coupled receptor. 
In vitro,  balovaptan exhibited an in hibition  constant  of 0.[ADDRESS_763918]  1000-fold binding  selec tivity over 118 o ther recept ors, enzymes, and ion 
channels,  including human vasopressin 2 ( V2) receptor , vasopressin 1b ( V1b) receptor , 
and human oxytocin  recep tors. 
Previous clinical studies of balovaptan have been conducted in healthy volunteers and participants with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using the same dose (10 mg) as  
proposed for this study.  In those trials, an estimated [ADDRESS_763919] received 10 mg once a day (QD) of balovaptan for at least [ADDRESS_763920] 24 weeks.   
Balovaptan was found to be safe and well tolerated.  
Detailed information on balovaptan is provided in the Balovaptan Investigator's 
Brochure.  
 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
25/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 2.3 BENEFIT –RISK ASSESSMENT  
This study will assess the efficacy and safety of balovaptan in adults with 
moderate- to-severe PTSD.  Currently, t he first -line therapy for PTSD is individual 
TF-psychological interventions.  However, these psychological interventions have not 
shown a significant improvement in affect dysregulation or maintenance of treatment effects at 6 month follow up in veterans (Coventry et al. 2020).   
Areas in the brain that are rich in vasopressin receptors have been implicated in PTSD 
suggesting that arginine vasopressin ( AVP) may be able to influence behavior that is 
relevant to PTSD  (Torok  et al. 2019) .  Nonclinical studies have shown that AVP agonist s 
result in PTSD -like behavior in rodents (Sipos et al. 2020).  In AVP -deficient Brattleboro 
rats, which have significant reduction of AVP signaling in the brain, demonstrated improved behavioral parameters that can be linked to PTSD symptoms.  Furthermore, serum AVP concentrations have been observed to be higher in veterans with PTSD compared with those without  (de Kloet et al. 2008) .  These findings imply that treatment 
with a V1a antagonist, such as balovaptan, may offer a means to alleviate symptoms of 
PTSD . 
Across previous clinical trials of balovaptan, it has been found to be safe and well tolerated.  This includes studies in healthy volunteers and in individuals with ASD 
(children, adolescents , and adults).  No pattern of adverse events possibly characteristic 
for the use of balovaptan in humans has emerged to date.    
The following are hypothetical or potential risks for balovaptan, based on its mechanism 
of action and available nonclinical data:  seizure ris k (animal studies ), hematological 
toxicity (animal studies ; mainly  peripheral decrease in neutrophils), risk of bleeding  
(hypothetical relative to the mechanism  of action) , skeletal muscle toxicity (animal 
studies ), cardiac toxicity (animal studies  and interpreted to be stress related) , blood 
pressure changes ( hypothetic al risk relative to the mechanism  of action), and risk of 
peripheral neuropathy (animal studies ) (for further details see  Appendix  6).  However, 
dedicated safety monitoring across clinical trials in healthy volunteers and in subjects  
with ASD have not revealed  a safety signal with regard to the mechanism of action of 
balovaptan and animal -related potential safety risks.  
The dose planned in this study is [ADDRESS_763921] 
dose administered in the ASD clinical trials which had a treatment duration of 12 weeks or longer .  The safety monitoring planned in this study will continue to cover these 
hypothetical and animal- related safety considerations and is considered sufficient to 
ensure participant safety.  
Refer to  Appendix  6 for information on potential risks for balovaptan and risk mitigation 
measures, including guidelines for managing adverse events.

particip ants in this study is  favorable.

28/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 4. STUDY DESIGN 
4.1 OVERALL DESIGN   
Study BN43546 is a Phase II, randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled, two-arm, 
parallel -group, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 10  mg of oral 
balovaptan QD in adults with PTSD.  The study will comprise a 28-day screening period, 
12-week blinded treatment period, and a 2 -week follow -up period.  A study schema is 
provided in Section 1.2 (see Figure  1). 
Participants providing informed consent will undergo screening up to [ADDRESS_763922] double- blind study drug (balovaptan or placebo) administration.  Eligible participants 
will be  randomized in a 1 :1 ratio in a blinded fashion to either 10 mg of balovaptan or 
matching oral placebo QD.  The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline at 
Week 12 i n the CAPS- 5. 
For participants completing the full study, the approximate length of the study will be 18 weeks or approximately 4 months (screening [ up to 4  weeks], blinded treatment 
[12 weeks] and a safety follow -up visit 2 weeks after  a participant’s  Week  [ADDRESS_763923] study treatment dose ). 
Participants will be recruited from sites within the [LOCATION_002].  It is estimated that it will 
take approximately 9 months to reach full enrollment.  Participants who prematurely 
discontinue from study treatment or from the study will not be replaced.   
Randomization will be stratified by  [CONTACT_4321] (male vs. female),  type of trauma (veteran vs. 
civilian) , and concurrent medication use (no concurrent  antidepressant  treatment vs. 
antidepressant  treatment  [SSRI or SNRI ]; see Section 5.1).  The main analysis of the 
primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will occur once the final data from all visits of the follow-up period have been collected and cleaned and the database is locked.  
An Internal Monitoring Committee  (IMC ), consisting of a selected subset of internal 
[COMPANY_002] representatives  who are not in direct contact [CONTACT_580998] , will review relevant 
safety dat a on a regular basis or on an ad- hoc basis , if deemed necessary, as described 
in the IMC Charter.  The IMC Charter provides further details about the roles and 
responsibility of the members, defining the timing of meetings and communication of meeting ’s discussion points.  
Secondary and exploratory endpoints will examine core and associated symptoms of PTSD, impact on health- related quality of life, as well as the ability to identify predictive 
or prognostic biomarkers.  Safety will be examined via adverse events, clinical laboratory 
values, ECGs, physical and neurologic examinations, and safety outcome assessments such as suicidality.  

 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
29/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failure) may 
be re -screened  one additional time (Section 5.4).  Re-screening will not be allowed if a 
participant does not meet the disease -specific inclusion criteria (e.g., PTSD  diagnosis as 
per DSM -5 and Structu red-Clinical Interview for DSM -5 [SCID-5] , PTSD Checklist for 
DSM -5 [PCL-5] score).  The investigator will record reasons for screen failure in the 
screening log.  
4.1.1  Screening Period 
Consenting participants will enter a screening period of up to 28 days  in length to be 
evaluated for eligibility.  Procedures at screening are listed in the schedule of activities in 
Section 1.3 (see Table 1 ).  Participants must meet all of the eligibility criteria in order to 
qualify for the study (see the inclusion and exclusion criteria [see Sections  5.1 and 5.2, 
respectively] ).  
To enter the double- blind period, there must be:  
• No significant new or worsening psychiatric or medical illness since screening that in 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_580950]’s ability to 
participate in the study.  
• No change in medications or psychotherapy since screening except as allowed in the Concomitant Medication section (see Section 6.8.1 ) 
 
4.1.2  Blinded Treatment Period 
The study will enroll approximately 30 participants with moderate- to-severe PTSD (as 
measured by [CONTACT_88806]-5).  All participants will undergo 12 weeks of double- blind treatment 
consisting of four  in-clinic visits.  
At the baseline visit (Day 1), participants will undergo a series of assessments outlined 
in the schedule of activities  (see Section  1.3).  Breaks should be allowed between tests 
when necessary.  Study drug (balovaptan or placebo) must be administered only after all 
protocol -mandat ed assessments are completed.  
As a rule, the test sequence for all assessments should remain the same for a given participant as established at screening and baseline.  At all visits, patient -reported 
outcome (PRO) assessments should be completed prior to any other assessments  or 
procedures .  All asses sments must be performed before administration of study drug.  
If Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( C-SSRS ) assessments at pre-randomization 
or Study Day 1 reveal score/category of [ADDRESS_763924].  
Interim telephone calls will occur at Weeks 4 and 9.  Participants  will be called by  [CONTACT_580999].  Assessments 
will include adverse event  collection , concomitant medication review, and dose 
accountability .

4.2 RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN   
4.2.1  Rationale for Study  Population  
A key component of PTSD vulnerability, development and treatment seems to involve 
the hypothalamic -pi[INVESTIGATOR_580951] (HPA) axis (Yehuda, 2002).  Arginine 
vasopressin (AVP) is an important co- stimulator of the HPA axis, modulating 
glucocorticoid release synergistically with corticotrophin- releasing hormone (CRH) 
(Engelmann et al. 2004; Rotzinger et al. 2010).  In PTSD, three main brain areas have 
been shown to be implicated:  the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the hippocampus, and the basolateral amygdala (Torok et al. 2019).  These brain areas are not rich in 
AVP- producing cells but contain vasopressin receptors at high density.  Thi s suggests 
that AVP is able to influence behavior that is also relevant to PTSD by [CONTACT_581000] a neurotransmitter or released in remote areas such as the hypothalamus and traveling via the extracellular space as a neuromodulator.  
In mouse models, the V1a receptor is highly expressed in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, a region of the amygdala implicated in stress response (Bielsky et al. 2004). V1a receptor knockout and inhibition have anxiolytic effects in mice while elevating 
levels of vasopressin has an anxiogenic effect.  
A study of veterans with PTSD and veterans, without PTSD who witnessed or experienced traumatic events, found that serum AVP levels were higher in veterans with PTSD than other cohorts (de Kloet et  al. 2008).  No difference in AVP levels were found 
between veterans without PTSD and non- military healthy controls.  A strong correlation 
was found between avoidance symptoms as determined by [CONTACT_581001]- Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and AVP serum  concentrations in patients 
with PTSD .  
These findings may imply that treatment with AVP antagonists might offer a way to alleviate symptoms in patients with PTSD.   
Study BN43546 will include both males and females.  The lifetime prevalence of PTSD 
among adult Americans has been reported to be 6.8%, with females being affected 
approximately twice as much as males  (NCS -R 2007a, 2007b) .  Furthermore, the 
reported prevalence among military service members and veterans is higher than among  
the general population (Miao et al. 2018) .  To investigate potential differences in these 
populations, the study will include veterans and civilians.  

 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
31/Protocol BN43546, Version [ADDRESS_763927] meet DSM -5 
criteria for PTSD, which will be confirmed using the PCL- 5 and the Structured- Clinical 
Interview for DSM -5 (SCID -5) (APA 2013) .  The PCL -5 is a 20- item, self-report ed 
measure that assesses  20 DSM -5 symptoms of PTSD  (Weathers et al. 2013c; Blevins 
et al. 2015) .  The SCID -5 is a semi -structured interview guide for making the major 
DSM -5 diagnoses  (First 2014) .  It is administered by a clinician or trained mental health 
professional who is familiar with the DSM -5 classification and diagnostic criteria.  
For pharmacological interventions of PTSD, SSRIs (sertraline, paroxetine, and 
fluoxetine) and SNRI (venlafaxine XR) are recommended as monotherapy  (APA 2017) .  
Participants in this study will include individuals who are on a stable dose of an 
antidepressant  treatment and have not reached full therapeutic effect or those who are 
not taking any antidepressants  because of  intolerance or treatment failure at baseline.  
This will be  assessed by [CONTACT_1963].  
4.2.2  Rationale for Use of Placebo  
Two SSRIs  (sertraline and paroxetine) have been approved by [CONTACT_581002].   Overall response rates with SSRIs  rarely exceed 60% in patients with PTSD  
and less than 20% −30% of patients achieve complete remission ( Stein et al. 2002; 
Zohar et al. 2002).   
Vasopressin signaling is involved in the body’s stress response, and has been implicated in affective illnesses, including PTSD.  Plasma levels of vasopressin have been noted to be increased in PTSD (de Kloet et al. 2008).  Balovaptan is an antagonist at the V1a receptor, and thus may ameliorate symptoms related to elevated stress -related and vasopressin- mediated signaling.  
This study will only enroll individuals who are either on a stable dose of a single antidepressant for management of PTSD or have demonstrated prior lack of tolerability or lack of efficacy (see Section 5.1).  Given the limited pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_580952], a placebo -controlled trial is 
acceptable, provided that appropriate participant consent and safeguards are instituted to minimize the risk  of serious or irreversible harm resulting from exposure to placebo.  
4.2.3  Rationale for Biomarker Assessments  
In a Phase I study of healthy volunteers  (Study BP29412), 10  mg of balovaptan was 
found to elicit a decrease in power envelope connectivity within the α power band of a 
resting -state electroencephalogram ( EEG ) taken with eyes closed (1111327 [available 
on request] ).  The predominant source of this change in connectivity was localized to the 
vicinity of the left anterior insula and the left intraparietal cortex.  Retrospective analyses 
of open -label study data indicated that broadly similar patterns of α-band power 
envelope connectivity change may predict clinical improvement following a change in pharmacological treatment among patients with a PTSD diagnosis.  Changes in α-band 
connectivity have also been implicated in subsequent clinical improvement in patients 

 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
32/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 with a PTSD diagnosis following the administration of repetitive- transcranial magnetic 
stimulation  (rTMS) , and the topography of these effects could be consistent with the 
insular and parietal sources described above ( Zandvakili  et al. 2019).   Thus, 
pharmacodynamic EEG activity elicited by [CONTACT_581003], both in 
frequency and in spatial topography, with EEG changes associated w ith clinical 
improvement in patients with PTSD receiving rTMS.   
However, PTSD is a heterogeneous disorder, hence participants in this study may not all respond similarly to treatment with balovaptan.  Therefore, an objective of this study is to 
define whi ch patients  with PTSD may be most likely to benefit from balovaptan using 
one or more biomarkers ac quired prior to treatment  and to relate the strength of any 
response to balovaptan with change in clinical measures.  In addition to EEG, 
biosamples will be collected for identifying variants in the arginine vasopressin receptor 1A (AVPR1A)  gene that may be associated with response to balovaptan.  For this 
purpose, a mandatory predose whole blood sample will be obtained for DNA extraction from every participant on Day 1.  
Additionally , digital biomarkers will be derived from a wearable device ( e.g., OURA  
Ring) .  The following wearable sensor data will be recorded:   heart rate, movement , and 
sleep.  These measures will be recorded to enable the derivation of exploratory 
biomarkers related to autonomic function and arousal, movement kinematics and behavior, and sleep.   Finally, established cognitive assessments will be performed and 
completed as a ba ttery by [CONTACT_2299] , and cognitive data obtained (Qureshi et al. 
2011) .  On the basis of these data, cognitive biomarkers may be derived from different 
levels of cognitive functioning as well as exploring the relationship of these biomarkers to outcomes . 
4.2.4  Rationale for Use of Clinician -Administered PTSD Scale for 
DSM -5 (CAPS -5) 
The Clinician -Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) is a validated and widely used 
structured diagnostic interview , considered as  the gold standard to assess symptoms 
associated with PTSD  (Weathers et al. 2001) .  It has been  used  in multiple studies on 
PTSD as either a primary diagnostic or outcome measure.  
The CAPS has been revised to correspond with PTSD criteria in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Di sorders (DSM –5; APA 2013).   A 
description of the scale is provided in Section  8.1. 
4.[ADDRESS_763928] that blocks the activation of the V1a G protein− coupled receptor.   In vitro, 
balovaptan exhibited an inhibition constant of 0.[ADDRESS_763929] 1000- fold binding selectivity over 118 other receptors, enzymes, and ion channels, 
including human V2, V1b, and human oxytocin receptors  (1042558 [available on 

 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
33/Protocol BN43546, Version [ADDRESS_763930]]) .  Furthermore, the predicted brain occupancy of the V1a receptor reaches near 
maximal saturation (averag e of approximatel y 89% at trough)  with the 10 mg dose of 
balovaptan.   This predicted receptor occupancy  was calculated according to a model 
which used an ex -vivo functional assay that measured the inhibition of V1a mediated 
and vasopressin induced platelet  aggregation in human whole blood, and based on 
trough c oncentrations observed in Study  BP28420 (“VANILLA”) (1056966 [available on 
request] and 1106698 [available on request]).  
Across previous clinical studies of balovaptan in healthy volunteers and in individuals 
with ASD (children, adolescents, and adults), a dose of  [ADDRESS_763931] dose administered in 
the ASD clinical trials .  Together with the exclusion criteria and the safety moni toring 
scheduled for this study, balovaptan is expected to be well -tolerated by [CONTACT_581004].  Please see Appendix  6 for more details.

clinical studies.  
4.[ADDRESS_763932] visit  shown in the schedule of activities  (see 
Section 1.3). 
The end of this study is defined as the date of the  last visit of the last participant in the 
study or the date at which the last dat a point required for statistical analysis  or safety 
follow-up is received from the last participant, whichever occurs later.   It is anticipated  
that it may take approximately 9 months to recruit all participants for the study ; hence, 
the total length of the study is estimated to be approximately 13 months.  
In addition, the Sponsor may decide to terminate the study at any time.  
4.5 DURATION OF PARTICIP ATION   
The total duration of study participation for each individual is expected to be 
approximately 18 weeks.  
5. STUDY POPULATION   
Approximately  30 adult participant s with PTSD  will be enrolled in this study.  
Prospective approval of protocol deviations to recruitment and enrollment criteria, also 
known as protocol waivers or exemptions, is not permitted.

protocol  
• A ge ≥18 and ≤60 years at the time of signing Informed Consent Form  
• C urrent diagnosis of PTSD as per DSM -5 criteria and confirmed by [CONTACT_57404] -5 
conducted during screening 
• M oderate- to-severe PTSD, as assessed by a score of ≥33 on the PCL -5 completed 
during screening 
• The index trauma event must have occurred in adulthood, i.e., when the participant 
was ≥18 years old 
• The index trauma event must have occurred at least 6  months prior to scr eening 
and no more than 10 years prior to screening 
• Participants who, at baseline, are: 
– Either taking a stable dose of a single antidepressant (SSRI or SNRI) for 
management of PTSD and have been on that medication for ≥6 weeks at that 
stable dosage and demonstrating residual symptoms of PTSD  
or 
– Prior demonstrated lack of tolerability or lack of efficacy (treatment failure, defined as trial of at least two antidepressant medications (SSRI or SNRI) with 
lack of efficacy for management of PTSD) and not taking an antidepressant medication at baseline for ≥6 weeks  
• Treatment with permitted medications and/or non- pharmacological i nterventions 
should be at a stable dose/regiment for 6 weeks prior to screening, with the intent 
that such treatments remain stable throughout the study , with no expected changes 
before the Week  12 visit  
• F luent in English  
• For female participants of childbearing potential:  agree to remain abstinent (refrain 
from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraception method, as defined below:  
Female participants must remain abstinent or use contraceptive methods with a 
failure rate of <1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 14 days 
after the final dose of study drug.  
A female participant is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is 
postmenarchal, has not reached a postmenopausal state ( ≥12 continuous 
months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and is 
not permanently infertile due to surgery (i.e., removal of ovaries, fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_2134], and/or uterus) or another cause as determined by [CONTACT_581005] —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
35/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 (e.g.,  Müllerian agenesis).  The definition of childbearing potential may be 
adapted for alignment with local guidelines or regulations.  
Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of <1% per year include 
bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit 
ovulation, hormone -releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine 
devices.  
The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the 
duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the individual. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not adequate methods of contraception.  If required per local guidelines or regulations, locally recognized adequate 
methods of contraception and information about the reliability of abstinence will be described in the local Informed Consent Form.  
• Note:  No specific contraception methods for males are required.   The Sponsor does 
not require male contraception because of the minimal seminal dose transm itted via 
sexual intercourse (Banh olzer et al. 2012).

39/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 One tablet of study drug (balovaptan or placebo) should be taken orally QD at home at 
the same time each day, preferably in the morning, with or without food.  The tablet 
should be swallowed whole with something to drink . 
Participants who need to take their study drug  at a time of day outside of their usual  
routine may do so (e.g., participant typi[INVESTIGATOR_580944], but 
due to an unforeseen scheduling conflict cannot take their medication until the 
afternoon), but only one dose may be taken each day.  If a dose is missed, the 
participant should make a note to report this missed dose to the site at their next contact.   A missed dose of study treatment must  not be made up the next day. 
The first dose of the study drug will be administered on Day [ADDRESS_763939] been conducted.  At subsequent visits  (except for the Week 6 visit) , 
the study drug will be administered after  all protocol -mandated study assessments have 
been completed.   
6.2 PREPARATION, HANDLING, STORAGE, AND 
ACCOUNTABILITY  
All IMPs  required for completion of this study will be provided by [CONTACT_1034] .  The study 
site (i.e., investigator or other authorized personnel e.g.,  pharmacist ) is responsible for 
maintaining records of IMP delivery to the site, IMP inventory at the site, IMP use by 
[CONTACT_20908] , and disposition or return of unused IMP, thus enabling reconciliation of 
all IMP received, and for ensuring that participant s are provided with doses specified by 
[CONTACT_760].  
The study site should follow all instructions included with each shipment of IMP.  The 
study site will acknowledge receipt of IMPs supplied by [CONTACT_581007]- based response system (IxRS)  to confirm the shipment condition and 
content .  Any damaged shipments will be replaced.  The investigator or designee must 
confirm that appropriate temperature conditions have been maintained during transit , 
either by [CONTACT_76972] (shipment arrival date and time) or temperature monitoring,  for 
all IMPs received and that any discrepancies have been reported and resolved before 
use of the IMPs.  All IMPs must be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and 
monitored (manual or automated) area in accordance with the labeled storage conditions, with access limited to the investigator and authorized staff.  
Only par ticipants  enrolled in the study may receive IMPs , and only authorized staff may 
supply or administer IMPs . 
IMPs will either be disposed of at the study site according to the study site's institutional standard operating procedure or be returned to the Sponsor with the appropriate 
documentation.  The site's method of destroying Sponsor -supplied IMPs must be agreed 
to by [CONTACT_1034] .  The site must obtain written authorization from the Sponsor before

may be permitted if an investigator is deciding whether a participant should withdraw from the study and initiate treatment with a proven therapy .  However, unblinding will not 
be permitted if an investigator is deciding whether a participant should withdraw from the study and initiate treatment with an unproven therapy.  
The investigator should document and provide an explanation for any non- emergency 
unblinding .  If the Medical Monitor agrees to participant  unblinding, the investiga tor will 
be able to break the treatment code by [CONTACT_123517] . 
As per health authority reporting requirements, the Sponsor's Drug Safety representative will break the treatment code for all serious, unexpected suspected adverse reactions (see Section 8.3.4 ) that are considered by [CONTACT_581008] (defined in Section 6).  The participant  may continue to receive treatment, and the 
investigator, participant , and Sponsor personnel, with the exception of the Drug Safety 
representative and personnel who must have access to participant  treatment 
assignments to fulfill their roles (as defined above), will remain blinded to treatment 
assignment.  
6.4 STUDY TREATMENT COMPLIANCE   
When participants are dosed at the site, they will receive study treatment directly from the investigator or designee, under medical supervision .  The date and time of each 
dose administered in the clinic  as well as the time of administration of the preceding 
dose (at home)  will be recorded in the source documents and recorded on the Study 
Drug Administration eCRF .  The dose of study treatment and study participant 
identification will be confirmed at the time of dosing by a member of the study site staff other than the person administering the study treatment . 
When participants self -administer study treatment at home, compliance with study 
treatment will be assessed.  Compliance regarding administration of study drug at home 
will be monitored by [CONTACT_581009] . 
Study drug accountability will be performed at every site visit to monitor dose adherence.   
Interim telephone calls will occur at Weeks 4  and 9.  Participants will be called by [CONTACT_581010].  
Assessments will include adverse event, concomitant medication review, and dose accountability (querying adherence, missed doses, etc).

43/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 • Dosage information, including dose and frequency  
 
Based on hypothetical on-target considerations, results from Good Laboratory Practice 
(GLP) toxicology animal studies and clinical trial experience, there is no indication of 
immune- suppressant effects of balovaptan.  The existing safety monitoring and 
management guidelines, as well as the risk minimization measures outlined in the  
clinical protocol, are considered appropriate to support vaccinations including COVID -19 
vaccines concomitant to the treatment with balovaptan.  
The Medical Monitor may be consulted  if there are any questions related to concomitant 
or prior therapy . 
6.8.1  Permit ted Therapy  
In general, investigators may manage a participant 's care (including preexisting 
conditions)  as clinically  indicated and per local standard practice, with the exception of 
prohibited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_580955]  6.8.3  and taking into account cautionary 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_580955] 6.8.2 . 
It is also common for individuals with PTSD to be engaged in a variety of 
non-pharmacological interventions, including individual and group  based behavioral 
and/or cognitive psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Stable (6  weeks prior to screening)  
non-pharmacological intervention is per mitted.  The frequency of sessions  cannot 
exceed more than twice  monthly.  Neither initiation  of new psychotherapy  nor a change 
to the frequency of existing psychotherapy is permitted  during the course of the study . 
Use of the following concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_580956]:  
• SSRIs (sertraline, paroxetine, and fluoxetine) or SNRI (venlafaxine XR) :  stable 
dose (see Section  5.1) 
• Non-narcotic analgesics (i.e. , non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs [ NSAIDs ], 
acetaminophen/paracetamol)  
• Prescrib ed opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]:  no more than 2 times per week but not for 24 hours before 
study  visits   
• Trazadone:  PRN up to 3 times per week  
• Sedating antihistamines (e.g. , alimemazine,  chlorphenamine, diphenhydramine, 
clemastine, cyproheptadine, hydroxyzine, ketotifen, or promethazine):  allowed up to 
3 times per week but not for 24 hours before study visit  
• Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]:  up to 3 times per week but not  for 24 hours before study visits  
• Other anxiolytics (buspi[INVESTIGATOR_5331], gabapentin, hydroxyzine, propranolol, atenolol, 
guanfacine, clonidine, pregabalin, prazosin)  
• Muscle relaxants :  up to 3 times per we ek but not for 24 hours before study visit  
• Sedatives/hypnotics:  allowed up to 3 times per week but not for 24 hours before 
study visit

• Drugs with known risk of neutropenia per Warnings and Precaution section of U.S. 
Prescribing Info rmation  while not requiring tight controls as mandated for clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
are allowed as long as  the following criteria are met:  
– No hematological side effects have been noted with such drugs prior to study 
enrollment . 
– In this case hem atological controls as often as every 2 weeks during study 
treatment should be considered by [CONTACT_093]. 
 
6.8.2  Cautionary Therapy  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Medications Given with Precaution due to Effects Related to 
Cytochrome P450 Enzymes  
Balovaptan is metabolized by [CONTACT_9058] P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) and medications that are 
strong or moderate inhibitors or inducers of this enzyme will affect the PK of balovaptan.  
Therefore, the CYP3A4 inducers and inhibitors included in Appendix  10 should be 
avoided.  If use of one of these medications is  deemed  necessary  by [CONTACT_093] , the 
Medical Monitor should be consulted  regarding benefits and risks prior to concomitant 
administration with balovaptan. 
Moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, diltiazem) may be 
allowed for a treatment duration of no more than approximately 10 days (e.g., in the 
context of an adverse event).  
These lists of medications are not necessarily comprehensive.  The investigator should 
consult the prescribing information when determining whether a concomitant medication can be safely administered with study treatment .  In addition, the investigator should 
contact [CONTACT_249166].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Herbal Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_580958], safety profiles, and potential drug− drug interactions are generally 
unknown.  However, herbal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_319038].  
6.8.[ADDRESS_763947] be 
stopped 2 weeks prior to screening to ensure washout of medication: 
• Moderate or strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, clarithromycin, 
erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, diltiazem, and grapefruit juice)  

 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
45/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 • Moderate or strong inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g. , carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenytoin, St. John’s 
wort)  
• Q uinidine 
• All other clinically relevant substrates of P- gp:  An interaction cannot be ruled out 
and caution is advised in particular for those medications that have a narrow 
therapeutic window (e.g., loperamide  or paliperidone) or chronic adrenocorticoid or 
glucocorticoid use, in particular prednisolone.  However, when balovaptan is 
administered 5 or more hours prior to such a P- gp substrate, the risk of PK 
interaction is predicted to be small.  
• Oxytocin  
• DDAVP(desmopressin) 
• Bumetanide  
• Agents inhibiting vasopressin receptors (e.g., tolvaptan, conivaptan)  
• Tricyclic antidepressants :  TCAs, MAO inhibitors, or mirtazapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 
• Agents that have been associated with significant and/or irreversible hematological 
toxicity and therefore require frequent hematologic monitoring (e.g., clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050])  
• Use of  any concomitant medication known to potentially cause peripheral 
neuropathy per the Warnings and Precautions section of the U.S. Prescribing 
Information . 
• Antipsychotic medications or mood stabilizers  
 
7. DISCONTINUATION OF S TUDY TREATMENT AND 
PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION OR W ITHDRAWAL  
An excessive rate of withdrawals (either because of participant discontinuing study drug 
or withdrawal from the study) can render the study non- interpretable.  Therefore, 
unnecessary withdrawal of participants should be avoided and all efforts should be taken to motivate participants  to comply with all the study specific procedures and to be 
followed until the end of the 12- week treatment period.  
Before permanently discontinuing study drug (either initiated by [CONTACT_2299] o r the 
investigator), an interruption should be considered  (see Appendix  6, Section A6–2.2 for 
further details).  Participants, who temporarily discontinue study drug for any reason, should restart as soon as medically justified in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]. 
The investigator should show due diligence and explore all possible options to reach a 
participant who fails to return to a visit.  The site must document all attempts to try to contact [CONTACT_581012].  
7.1 DISCONTINUATION OF S TUDY TREATMENT  
It may be necessary for a participant to permanently discontinue (definitive 
discontinuation)  study treatment .  If study treatment  is definitively discontinued, the 

 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
46/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 participant will remain in the study  for additional assessments .  Refer to  the schedule of 
activities (see Section 1.3) for data to be collected at the time of discontinuation of study 
treatment and for any further follow -up evaluations  that need to be completed.  
Participants must permanently discontinue study treatment if they experience any of the 
following: 
• Any medical condition that the investigator or Sponsor determines may jeopardize 
the participant 's safety if he or she continues to receive study treatment  
• Investigator or Sponsor determination that treatment discontinuation is in the best interest of the participant  
• Pregnancy  
• Inability of participant to continue to comply with study requirements  
• S uicidal ideation s core of 4 or  5 or category 6 or greater  on the C -SSRS 
• Specific events that are described in Sections  7.1.1 , 7.1.2 , 7.1.3 , and  7.1.4  
 
The primary reason for study treatment discontinuation should be documented on the 
appropriate eCRF.  
All pa rticipants who withdraw or discontinue from the study treatment early will be asked 
to return as soon as possible (and within [ADDRESS_763948] dose of study drug) for 
an early discontinuation visit and complete the assessments as per the schedule of 
activities  in Section 1.3 (see Table 1 ).  Participa nts will also be asked to return for 
assessments of the primary and secondary efficacy outcomes at the end of the 12-week 
planned visit, regardless of their adherence to  treatment.  If the time between the early 
discontinuation visit and the 12-week planned visit is fewer than 2 weeks, then 
participants  are exempted from the 12-week planned visit.  If the time between the early 
discontinuation visit and the previous visit is fewer than 2 weeks, then participants are 
exempted from completing again all the primary and secondary assessments at the early discontinuation visit. 
Refer to the schedule of activities in Section 1.3 (see Table 1 ) for details on follow -up 
assessments to be performed for participants  who permanently discontinue study 
treatment.   If a participant  requests to be withdrawn from treatment or follow -up 
assessments, this request must be documented in the source documents and signed by [CONTACT_093].  
7.1.1  Liver Chemistry Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_580959].  
Discontinuation of study treatment is required by [CONTACT_82378] a study participant meets abnormal liver  tests as outlined Appendix  3 (see Section  A3–7.6), or if 

 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
47/Protocol BN43546, Version [ADDRESS_763949] of the participant when abnormal liver 
chemistries not meeting protocol -specified stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004].  
Discontinuation of study treatment is also required if the participant experiences moderate or severe hepatic impairment , defined as Child- Pugh class B (7−9 points)  and 
class C  (10−15 points), respectively.  Please see Appendix  8 for Child -Pugh 
classification. 
7.1.2  QTc Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_580960] ( QTc). 
Nevertheless, treatment should be discontinued in case of  the following:  
• Sustained (at least two ECG measurements >30 minutes apart) QTcF that is 
>500 ms and/or >60 ms longer than the baseline value  
Treatment with balovaptan should be discontinued in participants who develop changes 
in QT interval, as described in Appendix  6.  ECG assessment should be conducted as 
outlined in Section 8.2.4 . 
7.1.3  Hematological Toxicity Criteria 
Treatment discontinuation is suggested for participants who meet the following criterion for decreased absolute neutrophil count ( ANC): 
If the ANC falls < 800/ µL and the low ANC is confirmed in a second sample to be 
obtained within about 3 working days .  If the ANC  is <800/ µL for the second sample , 
the investigator should consider treatment discontinuation.  
In cases of ANC related −treatment discontinuation, additional laboratory parameters 
should be considered by [CONTACT_737], including fibrinogen, high-sensitivity  C-reactive 
protein (hs-CRP) , and check for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ( ANCA ).  
7.1.4  Cardiac Toxicity  
Management guidelines and treatment discontinuation for cardiac events are provided in 
Table 4 .

At the time of discontinuing from the study, if possible, an early discontinuation visit 
should be conducted, as shown in the schedule of activities  (see S ection 1.3).  Refer to 
the schedule of activities for data to be collected at the time of study discontinuation and 
follow -up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed.  
The participant will be permanently discontinued both from the study treatment and from the study  at that time.  
If a participant  withdraws consent  from the study, the Sponsor may retain and continue 
to use any data collected before withdrawal of consent .  Samples collected prior to 
withdrawal may be analyzed, unless the participant  specifically reques ts that the 
samples be destroyed (as documented in the source documents)  or local laws require 
destruction of the samples .  However, if samples have been tested prior to withdrawal, 
results from those tests will remain as part of the overall research data.

required study visit:  
• The site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_581013].  If the participant is unable or unwilling to comply with study 
visits, site personnel should assess reasons the participant is unable or unwilling to 
return to the clinic, and determine if there are ways to support participant 
participation.  

 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
50/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 • Before a participant is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or designee must 
make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, three 
telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equiv alent methods) .  These contact [CONTACT_19425]’s medical record. 
• Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered lost 
to follow -up and will be withdrawn from the study.  
 
Discontinuation of specific sites or of the study as a whole are handled as part of  
Appendix  1. 
8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AN D PROCEDURES  
Written informed consent for participation in the study must be obtained before 
performing any  study -related procedures (including screening evaluations) .  Informed 
Consent Forms for enrolled individuals  and for individuals  who are not subsequently 
enrolled will be maintained at the  study site.  
Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the schedule of activities  (see 
Section 1.3).  Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed.  
Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the Sponsor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue study treatment.  
Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the schedule of activities, is essential and required for study conduct.  
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential participants meet all eligibility criteria .  The investigator will maintain a screening lo g to 
record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure as applicable.  
Medical history and baseline conditions, including clinically significant diseases, surgeries history and baseline conditions, including clinically significant diseases, 
surgeries, cancer history (including prior cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26649]), reproductive status, smoking history,  and use of alcohol and drugs of abuse  will be recorded at 
baseline.  Any medication and/or vacci ne (including over -the-counter or prescription 
medicines, vitamins, and/or herbal supplements) used by [CONTACT_78772] 24 weeks  
prior to the screening visit  will be recorded at baseline.  Demographic data, including 
age, sex, and self-reported race/ethnicity, will also be recorded .  At the time of each 
follow -up physical examination, an interval medical history should be obtained and any 
changes in medications and allergies should be recorded.  

 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
51/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 Participants will be closely monitored for safety throughout the study .  For in- clinic visits, 
participants should be assessed for toxicity prior to each dose; treatment will be 
administered  only if the clinical assessment and local laboratory test values are 
acceptable.  Urgent safety concerns should be discussed with the Sponsor immediately 
upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant  should continue or 
discontinue study treatment . 
8.1 EFFICACY  ASSESSMENTS 
8.1.1  Clinical Outcome Assessments  
Participant -reported outcomes (PRO) , clinician -reported outcomes (ClinRO) and 
performance outcome (PerfO) instruments will be completed to assess the treatment 
benefit of balovaptan.   
PRO data will be collected through use of the following instruments:  Life Events Checklist for DSM -5 (LEC-5), PCL -5, Patient Health Questionnaire- 9 (PHQ -9), Beck 
Anxiety Inventory ( BAI), Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272] ( PSQI ), Sheehan Disability Scale 
(SDS), Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire ( CPFQ ), Patient -Global 
Impression o f Severity (PGI -S), and Patient -Global I mpression of Change (PGI -C).  
ClinRO data will be collected through use of the following instruments:  SCID -5, CAPS- 5, 
Clinician -Global Impression of Severity (CGI -S), and Clinician -Global Impression of 
Change (CGI -C).   
PCL-5 and LEC- 5 are the PRO s completed at screening, as well as the SCID -5 
(ClinRO) .  The recommended order for administration is:   PCL-5, SCID -5, and LEC- 5.  
For all other visits, PROs must be completed before the ClinROs in the following order:   
PHQ -9, PCL -5, PSQI, BAI, CPFQ, SDS, P GI-S, PGI -C.  ClinROs should be completed, 
starting with the CAPS- 5, CGI -S, followed by [CONTACT_87791]-C. 
Clinician -Administered PTSD scale for DSM -5 (CAPS-5) is the clinical outcome 
assessment that will be used to determine the primary endpoint (see Table 2  and 
Section 9.4.2 ).  CGI -S and PHQ -9 are the clinical outcome assessment s that will be 
used to determine the secondary endpoints (see Table 2  and Section 9.4.3 ).  For any 
individual patient, the CGI -S/C should be completed by [CONTACT_581014].  
PerfO  data will be collected th rough the use of a computerized cognitive battery . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinician -Admi nistered PTSD Scale for DSM -5 (CAPS -5) 
The CAPS- 5 is a 30- item structured interview that can be used to  make current (past 
month) diagnosis of PTSD, make lifetime diagnosis of PTSD, or assess PTSD symptoms over the past week  (Weathers et al. 2013 a, 2018; see Appendix  11).  For this 
study the past week version of the CAPS- 5 will be used and will be administered  by 
[CONTACT_581015] .  Items are scored using a 5 -point scale, rated from 0 (absent) to 

 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
52/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 4 (extreme/incapacitating), with a higher overall score indicating  a worse outcome.   In 
addition to assessing the [ADDRESS_763955] of symptoms on social and 
occupational functioning, improvement in symptoms since a previous CAPS administration, overall response validity, overall PTSD severity, and specifications for the dissociative subtype (depersonalization and derealization).  Responses will be  collected 
by [CONTACT_581016], which are 
then used to select a response on a 5- point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (absent) to 
4 (extreme/incapacitating).  A total score is calculated by [CONTACT_581017] 1 −20, where a higher score corresponds to greater severity of PTSD  or presence 
of PTSD.  Symptom cluster severity scores can also be derived by [CONTACT_572603] a given DSM -5 cluster:  
Criterion B (items 1 −5); Criterion C (items 6 −7); Criterion D (items 8 −14); and, Criterion E 
(items 15 −20).  For each symptom, standardized questions and probes are provided.  
Administration requires identification of an index traumatic event to serve as the basis for symptom inquiry  via the Life Events Checklist for DSM -5 (LEC- 5; see Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for 
more detail).  The LEC -[ADDRESS_763956] a working knowledge of PTSD but can also be administered by [CONTACT_581018].  
The full interview takes 45 −[ADDRESS_763957] 
CAPS- 5 assessment will be administered no more than 7 days prior to the baseline and 
at Week  6 and Week 12.
  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinician -Global Impression  of Severity (CGI -S) and Change 
(CGI -C) 
The CGI -S and CGI -C are single items  rated by [CONTACT_15370] (Guy 1976; see 
Appendix  11).  The CGI -S is used to assess the overall severity of PTSD symptoms  over 
the past 7 days, whereas the CGI -C is used to assess change in overall PTSD 
symptoms from baseline.  Each item is rated on a 7- point scale, ranging from 1 (no  
symptoms /very much improved) to 7 ( very severe /very much w orse) for the  CGI-S and 
CGI-C, respectively.  Clinicians should make a judgment on severity and any changes 
from baseline based on the totality of information available to them (e.g., insights from the patient captured during the completion of other trial assessments).  The assessments wi ll take up to 5 minutes to complete in their entirety .  The CGI -S will be 
collected at baseline, Week 6, and Week 12.  The CGI -C will be collected at Week 6 and 
Week 12.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Patient Health Questionnaire -9 (PHQ -9) 
The PHQ -[ADDRESS_763958] 
2 weeks.  It was developed using each of the 9 DSM -IV criteria.  On the basis of these 
criteria , the diagnosis of depressive disorders is made (Kroenke et al. 2001;  see 

 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
53/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 Appendix  11).  Responses are rated based on frequency of symptoms on a 4-point 
Likert scale, ranging  from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day).  Reponses are reported 
using a recall of the la st 2 weeks.  A total PHQ -9 total score ranging from 0 to 27 can be 
calculated by [CONTACT_581019], of which a higher score corresponds to more 
severe depression.  Scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represent cutpoints for mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively.  It takes approximately 90 seconds to 3 minutes to complete.  The PHQ -9 will be administered at baseline, 
Week 6, and Week 12.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Life Events Checklist for DSM -5 (LEC-5) 
The LEC -[ADDRESS_763959] version is a 17 -item PRO designed  to screen for potentially 
traumatic events in an individual’s lifetime (Gray et al. 2004; Weathers et al . 2013b; see 
Appendix  11).  The LEC- [ADDRESS_763960] 16 items.  Responses are reported on a 6 -point nominal scale of which one or more responses can be made based 
on whether the event:  happened to the individual personally; they witnessed it happen to someone else; they learned about it happening to a close family member or close friend; they were exposed to it as part of their job ( e.g., first responders); they are not 
sure if it fits; it does not apply.  There is no formal scoring protocol or interpretation per se, other than identifying whether a person has experienced one or more of the 
events listed.  
The purpose of the LEC -5 generally and in this study is to inform other measures 
(e.g., CAPS- 5) to establish exposure to a PTSD Criterion A traumatic event.  It takes 
approximately 4− [ADDRESS_763961] be completed at the screening 
visit. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  PTSD Checklist for  DSM -5 (PCL -5) 
The PCL -5 is a 20-item PRO used to assess the 20 DSM -5 symptoms of PTSD 
(Weathers et al . 2013c; Blevins et al. 2015; see Appendix  11).  Reponses are reported 
on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4  (extremely).  A recall period of 
one month has been validated.  However, the PCL- 5 manual acknowledges a recall 
period of less than one month may make more sense in some cases, but to be aware 
that the psychometric properties may differ to those published using the one- month 
recall  (National Center for PTSD 2013) .  In this study, the one -month recall will be used 
at screening for diagnostic purposes and a one week recall version will be used thereafter for efficacy.  This is to allow for more frequent PCL-5 administrations without 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_580962].   A total severity score , ranging from 0 to 80 , can be calculated by 
[CONTACT_366757], of which a higher score corresponds to more severe symptoms.  The PCL-5 can be used to determine a provisional diagnosis in two ways; either using a 
cutpoint score of 31 to 33, or alternatively , by [CONTACT_581020] 2 (moderately) 
or higher as a symptom endorsed and then following the DSM -5 diagnostic rule , which 

 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
54/Protocol BN43546, Version [ADDRESS_763962]:  1 Criterion B item ( Questions 1−5), 1 Criterion C item ( Questions 6−7), 
2 Criterion D items (Questions 8−14), and 2 Criterion E items ( Questions 15− 20).  If a 
patient meets a provisional diagnosis using either of the methods above, then he or she 
needs further assessment (e.g., CAPS -5 or SCID -5) to confirm a diagnosis of PTSD.  It 
takes approximately 5− 10 minutes to complete.  The PCL- 5 will be administered at 
screening, baseline, Week 2, Week 6, and Week 12.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Structured -Clinical Interview for DSM -5 (SCID -5)  
The SCID -5 is a structured diagnostic instrument for assessing DSM -5 disorders  (First 
2014;  Appendix  11).  The instrument is designed to be administered by a clinician or 
trained mental healt h professional.  The SCID -[ADDRESS_763963] sections begin with an entry question 
that would allow the interviewer to skip the associated questions if not met.  For all 
diagnoses, symptoms are coded as present, subthreshold, or absent.   The SCID -5 will 
be used only at screening for the diagnosis of PTSD.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)  
The BAI is a 21 -item PRO used to assess severity of anxiety in psychiatric populations 
(Beck et al. 1988;  see Appendix  11).  BAI is a self -reported measure of clinical anxiety.  
BAI was designed to specifically assess the physiological and cognitive symptoms of anxiety and is independent of depression.  Responses are reported using a recall of 1  week on the basis of how much an individual has been bothered by [CONTACT_581021] a 4-point Likert scale , ranging  from 0  (not at all) to 
3 (severely it bothered me a lot).  A total score , ranging from 0 to 63, can be calculated 
by [CONTACT_10621] 21 items , for which a higher score corresponds to more severe anxiety.  
Scores of 0  to 21, 22  to 35, and 36 and above represent cutpoints for low, moderate , 
and concerning levels of anxiety.  It takes approximately 2− 4 minutes to complete.  The 
BAI will be administered at baseline, Week 6, and Week 12. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_106735] h Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)  
The PSQI is a [ADDRESS_763964] month (Buysse et 
al. 1989; see Appendix  11).  It contains 7 domains , consisting of subjective sleep quality 
(1 item), sleep latency (2  items), sleep duration (1 item), habitual sleep efficiency 
(3 items), sleep disturbances (9 items), use of sleep medication (1 item), and daytime 
dysfunction (2 items).  It is rated by [CONTACT_581022] a 4 -point Likert scale 
with a range of response options from 0 (corresponding to better outcomes) to 3 (corresponding to worse outcomes).  Reponses are reported using a recall of the past 
month.  The PSQI can be scored as a total score ranging from 0 to 21 by [CONTACT_581023] (mentioned above) , for which higher scores correspond to worse 
sleep quality.  A global score of 5 represents poor sleep quality.  It takes approximately 5−10 minutes to complete.  The PSQI will be administered at baseline, Week 6, and 
Week12.

The SDS is a 5 -item PRO used to assess health -related quality  of life and social  
functioning ( Sheehan 1983, Sheehan  and Sheehan 2008;  see Appendix  11).  It consists 
of [ADDRESS_763965] week, items are rated on a 10- point numerical rating 
scale, ranging from 0 (unimpaired) to 10 (highly impaired).  The measure can be scored 
either by [CONTACT_581024] a percentage or as a global score from 0 to 30, for which higher scores 
correspond to greater impairment.  There are no referenced cutoff scores for this measure.  It takes approximately 1− 2 minutes to complete.  The SDS will be 
administered at baseline, Week 6 and Week 12.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire (CPFQ)  
CPFQ  is a 7 -item PRO used to assess physical and psychological functioning in mood 
and anxiety disorders (Fava et al. 2009; see Appendix  11).  The participant  is asked to 
report how affected he or she has  been over the past month by [CONTACT_581025].  Responses are made using a 6-point 
Likert scale from 1 (greater than normal) to 6  (totally absent).  Scoring can be calculated 
as a total score , ranging from 7 to 42 or by [CONTACT_121982] (cognitive, 4 items;  physical, 3 items) 
by [CONTACT_581026] a higher score corresponds to poorer functioning.  It takes approximately 60− 90 seconds to complete.  The CPFQ will be administered at baseline, 
Week 6, and Week 12.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Patient -Global Impression  of Severity (PGI -S) and  Change 
(PGI-C) 
The PGI -S and PGI -C are single items rated by [CONTACT_581027] 7 days  or change of PTSD symptoms relative to baseline 
(see Appendix  11).  Each item is rated on a 7- point scale , ranging from 1 (no 
symptoms/very much improved) to 7 (very severe/very much worse) for PGI -S and 
PGI-C, respectively.  T he assessments will each take approximately 30 seconds to 
complete.  The PGI -S will be collected at baseline, Week 6, and Week 12.  The PGI -C 
will be collected at Week 6 and Week 12.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Computerized Cognitive Battery  
A computerized cognitive battery will be administered and completed by p articipants  to 
assess domains such as  psychomotor functioning ( e.g., simple and choice- reaction time 
tasks), non- verbal receptive communication ( e.g., facial -emotion recognition task), verbal 
memory, and executive function (including set -shifting  and/or reversal learning).   The 
data will  be used mainly  to derive cognitive biomarkers ( see Section 8.7) and may also 
be used for exploratory efficacy endpoints .  The assessments will take approximately 
30 minutes to complete and will be administered at the pre- randomization visit , Week 2, 
Week 6, and Week 12.

56/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 8.2 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS 
8.2.1  Physical Examinations 
A complete physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the  
cardiovascular, dermatologic, musculoskeletal, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gastrointestinal, and 
neurologic  systems .  Any abnormality identified at baseline should be recorded on the 
General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF.  
A brief  or limited physical examination should be symptom -directed and will include, at a 
minimum, assessments of the skin, lungs,  and the cardiovascular  and neurologic 
systems.   
Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious 
illnesses .  Changes from baseline abnormalities should be recorded in participant  notes .  
New or worsened clinically significant abnormalities beyond what is expected in the 
clinical situation should be recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
8.2.2  Vital Signs  
Temperature  (tympanic) , pulse rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and blood pressure will be 
assessed.  
Blood pressure and pulse measurements  will be assessed while the participant is in a  
seated  position with a completely automated device.  Manual techniques will be used 
only if an automated device is not available.   
Blood pressure and pulse measurements should be preceded by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_763966] for the participant in a quiet setting without distractions (e.g., television, cell phones).  
Vital signs (to be taken before any blood collection) will consist of one pulse and three 
blood pressure measurements (three consecutive blood pressure readings will be recorded at intervals of at least 1 minute).  The average of the three blood pressure 
readings will be recorded on the eCRF.  
Abnormalities observed at baseline should be recorded on the Ge neral Medical History 
and Baseline Conditions eCRF.  At subsequent visits, new or worsened clinically 
significant abnormalities should be recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
8.2.3  Neurological Examination 
Neurologic examinations of the upper and lower limbs will be completed as per  the 
schedule of activities in Section 1.3 (see  Table 1 )and conducted as per the instructions 
provided in in Appendix  7. 

 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
57/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 8.2.4  Electrocardiograms  
Single  12-lead ECGs will be obtained as outlined in the schedule of activities (see 
Section 1.3) using an ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and 
measures PR  interval , QRS  interval , QT interval , and QTcF .  Refer to Appendix  6 for 
prolonged QTc management  criteria and any additional QTc readings that may be 
necessary.  
For the baseline ECG at which triplicate ECGs are required, three individual ECG 
tracings should be obtained as closely as possible in succession, approximately 1−[ADDRESS_763967] 5 minutes .  All ECGs are to be obtained prior to other 
procedures scheduled at that same time (e.g.,  vital sign measurements, blood draws) 
and should not be obtained within 3 hours after any meal .  Circum stances that may 
induce changes in heart rate, including environmental distractions (e.g., television, radio, conversation) should be avoided during the pre−ECG resting period and during ECG recording.  
For safety monitoring purposes, the investigator must review, sign, and date all ECG 
reports .  Paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_228047] 's permanent 
study file at the site .  Digital recordings will be stored at  the site as part of the medical 
record  and the central ECG laboratory .
  The following parameters will be provided as 
non-eCRF  data:  heart rate, RR  interval, QRS interval, PR duration (beginning of P wave 
to first part of QRS complex) , uncorrected QT interval, and QTcF based on machine 
readings of the individual ECG tracings .  Any concerning morphologic waveform 
changes or other ECG abnormalities that lead to change in management or increased monitoring must be documented on the eCRF as an adverse event.  
If at a particular postdose timepoint the mean QTcF is >
 500 ms and/or > [ADDRESS_763968] -of-care treatmen t 
may be instituted  at the investigator's discretion .  If a PK sample is not scheduled for that 
timepoint, one  should be obtained.  A decision on study drug discontinuation should be 
made, as described in Appendix  6 (see Section A6–2.7).  The investigator should also 
evaluate the participant  for potential concurrent risk factors (e.g.,  electrolyte 
abnormalities, concomitant medications known to prolong the QT interval, severe 
bradycardia).  

 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
58/Protocol BN43546, Version [ADDRESS_763969] of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and to the 
schedule of activities (see Section 1.3) for the timing and frequency .  
The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any 
clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the Adverse Event eCRF.  The 
laboratory reports m ust be filed with the source documents .  Clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory findings are those that are not associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_19448]'s condition.  A laboratory test result must be reported as an adverse event if it 
meets any of the following criteria:  
• Is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]  
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation)  
• Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) or a change in concomitant therapy  
• Is clinically significant in the investigator's judgment  
 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated 
laboratory abnormality should be classified as an adverse event.  
All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during 
participation in the study or within [ADDRESS_763970] be 
conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the schedule of activities  
(Section 1.3). 
If laboratory values from non- protocol -specified laboratory assessments performed at 
the institution’s local laboratory require a change in participant management or are considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_093] (e.g., serious adverse event  or 
advers e event  or dose modification), the results must be recorded on the eCRF.  
Samples collected for safety laboratory tests will be destroyed no later than the time of completion of the final CSR . 
8.2.6  Pregnancy Testing  
The schedule for pregnancy testing for enrolled female participants is outlined in Section 1.3 and will be conducted as outlined in Appendix  2. 

 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
59/Protocol BN43546, Version [ADDRESS_763971] (C -SSRS Baseline /Screening version) 
as well as any new instances of suicidality during this study (C -SSRS Since Last Visit 
version to be used at subsequent visits)  (Posner et al. 2009a, Posner et al. 2009a)  
(Appendix  11).  The C-SSRS incorporates a structured interview to prompt recollection 
of suicidal ideation, including the intensity of the ideation, behavior, and attempts with 
actual/potential lethality.  
The C -SSRS is made up of ten categories, all of which maintain binary responses 
(yes/no) to indicate a presence or  absence of the behav ior.  The ten categories included 
in the C -SSRS are as follows:  Category 1 -Wish to be Dead;  Category 2 -Non-specific 
Active Suicidal Thoughts; Category 3- Active Suicidal Ideation with Any Methods 
(Not Plan)  without Intent to Act; Category [ADDRESS_763972], without Specific Plan; Category 5- Active Suicidal Ideation with Specific Plan and 
Intent; Category 6 -Preparatory Acts or Behavior; Category 7- Aborted Attempt; 
Category  8-Interrupted Attempt; Category 9 -Actual Attempt (non -fatal); 
Category  10-Completed Suicide.   A yes  or no binary response is also utilized in 
assessing self -injurious behavior without suicidal intent.  The outcome of the C- SSRS is 
a numerical score obtained from the aforementioned categories .  The maximum su icidal 
ideation category (1− 5 on the C -SSRS)  will determine the suicidal ideation score for the 
participant .  A score of [ADDRESS_763973] further evaluate the risk, which may involve local experts in the field of suicidality.  
8.3 ADVERSE EVENT S, SERIOUS ADVERSE EVEN TS, AND OTHER 
SAFETY REPORTING  
The definitions of adverse event and serious adverse event can be found in  (see 
Secti ons A3–1 and A3–2). 
Adverse events will be reported by [CONTACT_2299] (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant's legally authorized representative).  
The investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and recording events that meet the definition of an adverse event or serious adverse event and remain responsible for following up adverse events that are serious, are 

 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
60/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 considered related to the study treatment or study procedures, or caused the participant 
to discontinue the study treatment  (see Section 7). 
8.3.1  Time Period and Frequency for Coll ecting Adverse Event and 
Serious Adverse Event Information 
After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug, only serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention should be reported.  
The paper Clinical Trial Adverse Event/Special Situations Form  provided to investigators 
should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event), either by [CONTACT_581028] .  All 
other medical occurrences that begin before the start of study treatment but after obtaining informed consent will be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF, not the Adverse Event eCRF. 
All adverse events will be reported  from the start of treatment until [ADDRESS_763974] follow -up visit at the timepoints specified in the schedule of 
activities (see Section 1.3). 
All serious adverse event s will b e recorded and reported to the Sponsor or designee 
immediately and under no circumstance should this exceed [ADDRESS_763975] promptly notify the 
Sponsor . 
8.3.2  Method of Detecting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse 
Events  
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of adverse events  and 
serious adverse events  and the procedures for completing and transmitting serious 
adverse event  reports are provided in Appendix  3. 
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting adverse events  and/or serious 
adverse events .  Open- ended and non -leading verbal questioning of the participant is 
the preferred method to inquire about adverse event occurrences. 
8.3.3  Follow -Up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
After the initial adverse event  or serious adverse event  report, the investigator is 
required to proactively follow each participant at subsequent visits or contacts .  All 

 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
61/Protocol BN43546, Version [ADDRESS_763976] to follow -up (as 
defined in Section 7.3), or the participant withdraws consent .  Further information on 
follow -up procedures is provided in Appendix  3. 
8.3.4  Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse 
Events  
Prompt notification by [CONTACT_29532] a serious adverse event is 
essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a study treatment  under clinical investigation are met.  
The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory authorities  about the safety of a study treatment  under clinical 
investigation.  The Sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements 
relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards or Ethics Committees (IRBs/ECs) , and investigators.  
For all studies except those utilizing medical devices, investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions according to local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary.  
To determine reporting requirements for serious  adverse event cases, the Sponsor will 
assess the expectedness of these events through use of the reference safety information in the b alovaptan Investigator’s Brochure. 
The Sponsor will compare the severity of each event and the cumulative event frequency reported for the study with the severity and frequency reported in the applicable reference document. 
Reporting requirements will also be based on the investigator's assessment of causal ity 
and seriousness, with allowance for upgrading by [CONTACT_25753].  
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a serious adverse 
event or other specific safety information (e.g., summary or listing of serious adverse events) from the Sponsor will review and then file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure  and will notify the IRB/EC, if appropriate according to local requirements.  
8.3.5  Pregnancy  
Female participant s of childbearing potential will be instructed through the Info rmed 
Consent Form to immediately inform the investigator if they become pregnant during the study or within 14 days  after the final dose of balovaptan.  

 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
62/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator should inform the Sponsor within 24 hours of 
learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Appendix  4. 
All pregnancies reported during the study should be followed until pregnancy outcome , 
with follow -up information on the infant collected according to procedures outlined in 
Appendix  4.  The Sponsor or a designee may follow  up by [CONTACT_756], fax, email, and/or 
a monitoring visit to obtain additional case details and outcome information (e.g.,  from 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8838], consultant reports, autopsy reports) in order to perform an independent medical ass essment of the reported case.  
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e.g., spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered serious adverse events.  
8.3.6  Death Events  
Information on reporting deaths is provided in Appendix  3 (see Section A3–7.7) 
8.3.[ADDRESS_763977] are required to be reported by [CONTACT_13657] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after the  investigator becomes aware 
of the event; see Section  A3–5 for reporting instructions) .  Adverse events of special 
interest for this study  are as follows:  
• Cases of potential drug- induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST in 
combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by 
[CONTACT_25742]'s Law (see Section A3–7.6) 
• Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by a study treatment, as defined below : 
Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non -pathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent .  A transmission of an infectious agent may be 
suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings that indicate an infection in a participant exposed to a medicinal product .  This term applies 
only when a contamination of the study treatment is suspected. 
• ANC values <800/ µL and confirmed in a second sample.  
• Creatine phosphokinase ( CPK) values triggering a change in monitoring schedule 
and also when:  
– CPK values exceed 10× ULN for several days without trend of normalization 
according to CPK half -life in plasma  
– CPK increases associated with a relevant decrease in kidney function and no 
alternative explanation exists  
– CPK values increase again to similar values as noted before when treatment has been re- started.

for the Emergency Medical Call Center, will be distributed to investigators.  
8.4 PHARMACOKINET ICS 
Blood samples of approximately 2 mL will be collected for measurement of  plasma 
concentrations of balovaptan using a specific and validated liquid chromatography 
coupled to tandem mass spectrometry  (LC-MS/MS ) assay as specified in the schedule 
of activ ities in Section 1.3 (see Table 1 ).  Concentration of metabolite 2 (M2) and 
metabolite 3 (M3) may be measured if indicated (e. g., safety concern) . 
Instructions for the collection and handling of biological samples will be provided by [CONTACT_1034] .  The actual date and time (24- hour clock time) of each sample will be 
recorded.  
Samples will be used to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of  balovaptan.  Samples 
collected for analyses of balovaptan plasma concentration may also be used to evaluate 
safety or efficacy aspects related to concerns arising during or after the study . 
Genetic analyses will not be performed  on these  plasma samples  unless consent for this 
was included in the Informed Consent Form .  Participant confidentiality will be 
maintained.  At visits during which blood
 samples for the determination of multiple 
aspects  of balovaptan will be taken, one  sample of sufficient volume can be used.  
PK samples will be destroyed no later than 5 years after the final CSR has been 
completed to allow for assay development and validation (if needed).

8.7 BIOMARKER ASSESSMENT S 
The following biomarker assessments will be collected, as applicable,  from participants  
at all sites : 
• EEG assessments.  Resting -state EEG will be  acquired at 1000 Hz from 
64 locations following the extended 10 −20 system electrode montage.  This 
assessment will  follow the recommendations of the International Pharmaco- EEG 
Society (Jobert et al. 2012)  in 4-minute blocks as follows:   eyes closed (recording 
eyes closed [ REC] 1) , eyes open ( recording eyes open [ REO ] 1), eyes closed 
(REC2) , and eyes open (REO2) , amounting to a total of 16 minutes,  while 
participants sit relaxed looking at a fixating cross  during eyes -open conditions .  
Raw, unfiltered EEG data along with impedances (targeting < 15 kOhm for each 
channel in each run) will be recorded.  Resting state data will be processed offline to 
assess electrical brain activity including, but not limited to power at frequency bands  
and connectivity.  
• Computerized cognitive assessments.  A battery of cognitive assessmen ts will be 
administered , using an electronic display and with manual responses controlled by 
[CONTACT_581029]/or right hands  on a mouse, keyboard, or tablet as 
appropriate for the task .  The neurocognitive assessments to be administered will 
include assessments of psychomotor functioning (simple and choice-reaction time 
tasks), non- verbal receptive communication, verbal memory, and executive function.  
• Digital biomarkers .  These will be derived from a wearable device ( e.g., OURA  
Ring) .  The following wearable sensor data will be recorded:  heart rate, movement, 
and sleep.  These measures will be recorded to enable the derivation of exploratory 
biomarkers related to autonomic function and arousal, movement kinematics and behavior, and sleep.  The wearable will be worn starting during screening about 
[ADDRESS_763979] the 
participant on how to wear  and care f or the wearable, and on the importance of 
sleep hygiene. 
 
The following biomarker samples will be collected, as applicable, from participants at all 
sites: 
• Blood samples for exploratory research on biomarkers and biomarker assay 
development  
 
Biomarker samples collected at participating s ites and biomarker samples 
requiring  separate consent are described in Section 8.11. 
Exploratory biomarker research may include, but will not be limited to, analy sis of 
biomarkers relevant to balovaptan (e.g., AVPR1A gene) , PTSD and related disorders, 
and drug safety.   Research may involve extraction of DNA, cell -free DNA, or RNA; 
analysis of mutations, single nucleotide polymorphisms, and other genomic variants; and 

 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
65/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 genomic profiling through use of next -generation sequencing (NGS) of a comprehensive

At participating sites, blood samples will be collected for DNA extraction to enable WGS or WES to identify variants (inherited characteristics) that are predictive of response to study treatment, are associated with progression to a more severe disease state,  are 
associated with susceptibility to developi[INVESTIGATOR_68146], can lead to improved adverse event monitoring or investigation, or can increase the knowledge and understanding of disease biology and dr ug safety . 

 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
67/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 Research will be aimed at exploring inherited characteristics.  
The samples may be sent to one or more laboratories for analysis.  
Collection and submission of blood samples for WGS or WES is contingent upon the 
review and approval of the exploratory research by [CONTACT_25733]'s IRB/EC and, if applicable, an appropriate regulatory body .  If a site has not been granted approval for WGS or 
WES, this section of the protocol (Section  8.11.1) will not be applicable at that site.  
Genomics is increasingly informing researcher's understanding of disease pathobiology .  
WGS and WES provide a comprehensive characterization of the genome and exome, respectively, and, along with clinical data collected in this study, may increase the 
opportunity for developi[INVESTIGATOR_580963] a drug or develop adverse events .  Data will be analyzed in the context of this study but may also 
be explored in aggregate with data from other studies .  The availability of a larger 
dataset will assist in identification and characterization of important biomarkers and pathways to support future drug development.  
For sampling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions, see the laboratory manual.  
Blood samples collected for WGS or WES are to be stored until they are no longer needed or until they are exhausted.  However, the storage period will be in accordance 
with the IRB/EC −approved Informed Consent Form and applicable laws (e.g., health 
authority requirements).  
Data generated from blood samples collected for WGS or WES will be analyzed in aggregate rather than on an individual basis.  Thus, there will be no identification and reporting of incidental findings to investigators or participants.  
If permitted by [CONTACT_1769], a participant may request access to uninterpreted WGS or WES data derived from analysis of his or her blood sample.  If a participant wishes to access these data, the investigator must inform the Sponsor, using the following email address:  global.return- genomics -[EMAIL_11050].  The Sponsor will provide 
available data to the investigator in the form of a raw genomic sequencing data file, but will not provide any interpretation of the data.  The investigator should not include the data file in the participant’s medical record.  Samples may be stored and analyzed in the future, and some samples  may never be analyzed.  Thus, data may not be available at 
the time of the request or may never be available.  
The aggregate results of any conducted research will be available in accordance with the effective Sponsor policy on study data publication (see  Appendix  1).

68/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 8.11.2  Samples for Research Biosample Repository (Participants 
Providing Separate Consent at Participating Sites)  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Overview of the Research Biosample Repository  
The RBR is a centrally administered group of facilities used for the long- term storage of 
human biological specimens, including body fluids, solid tissues, and derivatives thereof 
(e.g., DNA, RNA, proteins, peptides) .  The collection, storage, and analysis of RBR 
samples will facilitate the rational design of new pharmaceutical agents and the development of diagnostic tests, which may allow for individualized drug therapy for patients in the future.  
Samples for the RBR will be collected from participants who give specific consent to participate in this optional research .  RBR samples will be analyzed to achieve one or 
more of the following objectives:  
• To study the association of biomarkers with efficacy or disease progression 
• To identify safety biomarkers that are associated with susceptibility to developi[INVESTIGATOR_123407]  
• To increase knowledge and understanding of disease biology and drug safety  
• To study drug response, including drug effects and the processes of drug absorption 
and disposition 
• To develop biomarker or diagnostic assays and establish the performance characteristics of these assays 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Approval by [CONTACT_581032], storage, and analysis of RBR samples is contingent upon the review and 
approval of the exploratory research and the RBR portion of the Informed Consent Form 
by [CONTACT_25733]'s IRB/EC and, if applicable, an appropriate regulatory body .  If a site has not 
been granted approval for RBR sampling, this section of the protocol (Section 8.11) will 
not be applicable at that site.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Sample Colle ction  
The following samples will be stored in the RBR and used for research purposes, including, but not limited to, research on biomarkers related to balovaptan, PTSD, or 
drug safety:  
• Leftover PK samples (see Section 8.4)  
• Leftover blood for DNA  sample collected at baseline (Day  1) 
• Additional whole- blood sample for RBR at the timepoints specified in the schedule 
of activities in Section  1.3 (see Table 1 ). 
 
The above samples may be sent to one or more laboratories for analysis including, but 
not limited to, the analysis of germline or somatic variants via WGS, WES, or other 
analysis methods .  Genomics is increasingly informing researcher's understanding of 

 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
69/Protocol BN43546, Version [ADDRESS_763980] in identification and characterization of important biomarkers and pathways to support future drug development.  
For sampling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions, see the laboratory manual.  RBR samples are to be stored until they are no longer needed or 
until they are exhausted.  However, the RBR storage period will be in accordance with 
the IRB/EC −approved Informed Consent Form and applicable laws (e.g., health authority 
requirements).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Confidentiality  
RBR samples  and associated data will be labeled with a unique participant identification 
number.  
Participant medical information associated with RBR samples is confidential and may be disclosed to third parties only as permitted by [CONTACT_25734] (or separate 
authorization for use and disclosure of personal health information) signed by [CONTACT_2299], unless permitted or required by [CONTACT_2371].  
Given the complexity and exploratory nature of the analyses of RBR samples, data derived from these analyses will generally not be provided to study investigators or participants unless required by [CONTACT_2371] .  The aggregate results of any conducted research 
will be available in accordance with the effective Sponsor policy on study data publication.  
Data generated from R BR samples must be available for inspection upon request by 
[CONTACT_25735], and Sponsor monitors, representatives, and collaborators, as appropriate.  
Any inventions and resulting patents, improvements, and/or know -how originating from 
the use of the RBR data will become and remain the exclusive and unburdened property of the Sponsor, except where agreed otherwise.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Consent to Participate in the Research Biosample Repository  
The Informed Consent Form will contain a separate section that addresses participation in the RBR .  The investigator or authorized designee will explain to each participant the 
objectives, methods, and potential hazards of participation in the RBR .  Participants will 
be told that they are free to choose not to provide optional RBR samples and may 
 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
70/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 withdraw their consent at any time and for any reason during the storage period.  A 
separate, specific signature [CONTACT_22862] a participant's agreement to 
provide optional RBR samples .  Participants who choose not to provide optional RBR 
samples will not provide a separate signature .  The investigator should document 
whether or not the participant has given consent to provide optional RBR samples and (if applicable) the date(s) of consent, by  [CONTACT_581033]/Withdrawal  eCRF.  
In the event of an RBR participant's death or loss of competence, the participant's samples and data will continue to be used as part of the RBR research.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Withdrawal from the Research Biosample Repos itory  
Participants who give consent to provide RBR samples have the right to withdraw their consent at any time for any reason.  After withdrawal of consent, any remaining samples 
will be destroyed.  However, if RBR samples have been tested prior to withdrawal of 
consent, results from those tests will remain as part of the overall research data .  If a 
participant wishes to withdraw consent to the testing of his or her RBR samples during the study, the investigator must inform the Medical Monitor in writing of the participant's 
wishes through use of the appropriate RBR Subject Withdrawal Form and must enter the date of withdrawal on the Sample Informed Consent /Withdrawal  eCRF .  If a participant 
wishes to withdraw consent to the testing of his or her RBR samples after closure of the site, the investigator must inform the Sponsor by [CONTACT_581034]:  
global .[EMAIL_2452]  
A participant's withdrawal from this study does not, by [CONTACT_5071], constitute withdrawal of consent for testing of RBR samples .  Likewise, a participant's withdrawal of consent for 
testing of RBR samples does not constitute withdrawal from this study.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Monitoring and Oversight  
RBR samples will be tracked in a manner consistent with Good Clinical Practice by a quality -controlled, auditable, and appropriately validated laboratory information 
management system, to ensure compliance with data confidentiality as well as adherence to authorized use of samples as specified in this  protocol and in the Informed 
Consent Form .  Sponsor monitors and auditors will have direct access to appropriate 
parts of records relating to an individual's participation in the RBR for the purposes of verifying the data provided to the Sponsor .  The sit e will permit monitoring, audits, 
IRB/EC review, and health authority inspections by [CONTACT_498762].

71/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 9. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS   
9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHES ES 
No formal statistical hypotheses will be tested for this study .  All analyses will be 
conducted using descriptive statistics. 
9.2 SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION   
Approximately 30 participants will be randomly assigned  to study treatment  (15 in 
balovaptan arm and 15 in placebo arm)  to perform the final analysis with reduced 
scope . 
9.3 ANALYSIS SETS  
The following populations are defined: 
Participant Analysis Set  Description  
Intent to treat   All participants randomly assigned to study drug.  Participants will 
be analyzed according to the treatment to which they were 
assigned.  
Safety  evaluable  All parti cipants randomly assigned to study drug and who receive 
at least one dose of study drug.  Participants will be analyzed 
according to the treatment  they actually receive . 
PK evaluable  The PK -evaluable populat ion will include all participants who 
receive at least one dose of balovaptan and have sufficient 
evaluable concentrations to determine the overall exposure to 
balovaptan.  
Participants may be excluded from the PK -evaluable population if 
they significantly violate the inclusion or exclusion criteria, deviate significantly from the protocol, or if data are unavailable or incomplete.  Excluded cases will be documented together with the reason for exclusion.  All decisions about exclusions from the 
analysis will be made prior to database lock.  
PK  = pharmacokinetic.    
9.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
The intent -to-treat (ITT) analysis set, as defined in 9.3, will be used for efficacy analyses.  
The safety analysis set, as defined in 9.3, will be used for safety analyses.  
Final database lock to enable the analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints will 
occur once all patients have either completed their follow -up assessment or withdrawn 
from the study early, and all data required for analysis have been cleaned and verified.

Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
72/Protocol BN43546 , Version 3 In general, descriptive statistics will be used to s ummarize continuous endpoints and 
counts and percentages will be used to summarize categorical endpoints.  
Missing values will not be replaced.   
9.4.2  Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is  the change in CAPS -5 total symptom severity score  from 
baseline at Week 12 , as defined in Section  3 (see Table  2).  The change from baseline 
in CAPS -5 total symptom severity score at Week 12 will be calculated as the score at 
Week  12 minus the score at baseline.  A negative change from baseline in CAPS -5 total 
symptom severity score indicates improvement.   
Every effort will be made to minimize missing data.   Participants who discontinue early 
from study treatment will be asked to return for collection of safety and limited efficacy 
data (i.e., the primary  and secondary efficacy endpoints) at the scheduled visits.  
9.4.3  Secondary Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints are the changes from baseline at Week 12 in the CGI -S and 
PHQ -9, as defined in Section  3 (see Table  2). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinic ian-Global Impression of Severity (CGI -S) 
The change from baseline in CGI -S will be  calculated as the CGI -S score at Week 12 
minus the CGI -S score at baseline.  A negative change from baseline in CGI -S indicates 
improvement.  
The count and percentages  for each value  of CGI -S changes will be evaluated.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Patient Health Questionnaire -9 (PHQ -9) 
The PHQ -9 is a 9 -question instrument to assess presence and severity of depression  
(see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  for details) .  The total sum of responses score ranges from [ADDRESS_763982] -baseline depression 
severity.

Exploratory endpoints as defined in Section 3, Table  2, will be analyzed descriptively by 
[CONTACT_2939].  Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, and range) will 
be presented for continuous variables and counts and percentages will be presented for 
categorical variables.  
The relationship between biomarkers (see Section 8.7) and efficacy, safety, PK, or other 
biomarker endpoints may be explored to identify biomarkers that are predictive of 
response to balovaptan or are early signs of efficacy.   
9.4.[ADDRESS_763983] results, changes in vital signs , ECGs  and Doppler echocardiograms (where 
applicable) , and C-SSRS . 
Study treatment exposure (such as treatment duration and treatment compliance ) will be 
summarized with descriptive statistics.  
All verbatim adverse event terms will be mapped to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities thesaurus terms, and adve rse event severity will be graded according to  mild, 
moderate, or severe scale (see Adverse Eve nts Severity Grading Scale;  Appe ndix 3, 
Table 1 ).  All adverse events, serious adverse events, adverse events leading to death, 
adverse events of special interest, and adverse events leading to study  treatment 
discontinuation that occur on or after the first dose of study treatment 
(i.e., treatment  emergent adverse events) will be summarized by [CONTACT_27940], 
appropriate thesaurus level, and severity grade .  For events of varying severity, the 
highest g rade will be used in the summaries .  Deaths and cause of death will be 
summarized.  
Relevant laboratory, vital sign (pulse rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], blood pressure, 
and temperature), and ECG data will be displayed by [CONTACT_5586], with grades  identified where 
appropr iate.  Additionally, a shift table of selected laboratory tests will be used to 
summarize the baseline and maximum post -baseline severity grade .  Changes in vital 
signs and ECGs will be summarized.  
9.4.6  Other Analyses   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Summaries of Conduct of Study  
Enrollment,  study treatment administration, and discontinuation from the study will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_2890].  The reasons for study treatment discontinuation will also

Clinical Safety Laboratory Tests   
The tests detailed in Table  A2-1 will be performed by [CONTACT_2237].  
Local laboratory results are only required in the event that the central laboratory results 
are not available in time for study treatment administration and/or response evaluation.  
If a local sample is required, it is important that a sample for central analysis be obtained 
at the same time .  Additionally, if  the local laboratory results are used to make either a 
study treatment decision or a  response evaluation, the results  together with the normal 
range of the parameters measured  must be entered on the electronic Case Report 
Form .  
Protocol -specific requirements for inclusion and exclusion of participants are detailed in 
Section 5.

Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
90/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 A3–[ADDRESS_763998] medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study 
participant temporally associated with the use of a study treatment , whether or not 
considered related to the study treatment . 
Note:  An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of study intervention.  
Events Meeting the Adverse Event Definition  
The following events meet the definition of adverse event:  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
other safety assessments (e.g., ECG,  radiological scans, vital sign  measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, or are considered cli nically significant in 
the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator (i.e., not related to progression of underlying disease)  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent preexisting condition, including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition 
• New condition detected or diagnosed after study treatment  administration, even 
though it may have been present before the start of the study  
• Signs, symptoms, or clinical sequelae of a suspected drug −drug interaction  
• Signs, symptoms, or  clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
treatment  or a concomitant medication  
• Overdose per se will not be reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event 
unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal or self -harming 
intent .  Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae.  
• Lack of efficacy will not be reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event.  
Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments.  However, the signs, 
symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event if they fulfill the definition of an adverse 
event or serious adverse event.  
 
Events NOT Meeting the Definition of Adverse Event  
The followin g events do not meet the definition of adverse event:  
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety 
assessments that are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_11009]’s condition  
Appendix 3:  Adverse Events:  Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, 
Follow -Up, and Reporting 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
91/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 • The disease or disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms 
of the disease  or disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the 
participant’s condition 
• Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy)  
• The condition that leads to the procedure is the adverse event.  
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307])  
• Anticipated day-to-day fluctuations of a preexisting disease or condition present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen 
 
A3–2 DEFINITION OF SERIOU S ADVERSE EVENT   
If an event is not an adverse event per the definition in Section A3–1, it cannot be a 
serious adverse event even if serious conditions are met (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_580968], death due to progression of disease).  
A serious adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any 
dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life threatening 
The term "life -threatening" in the definition of "serious" refers to an event in 
which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event .  It does not 
refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe.  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9234], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19949] (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_53107]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting.  Complications that occur during 
hospi [INVESTIGATOR_580969] s.  If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_580970], the event is serious .  When in doubt as to 
whether "hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]" occurred or was necessary, the adverse event  should 
be considered serious.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a preexisting condition that did not 
worsen from baseline is not considered an adverse event . 
• Results in persistent disability or incapacity  
The term "disability " means a substantial disruption of a person’s  ability to 
conduct normal life functions.  

Appendix 3:  Adverse Events:  Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, 
Follow -Up, and Reporting 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
92/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) t hat may interfere with or 
prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Other situations:  
Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether serious 
adverse event  reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important 
medical events that may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_580971] .  These events should usually be considered serious.  
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
The terms "severe" and "serious" are not synonymous .  Severity refers to the intensity of 
an adverse event (e.g., rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to National 
Cancer Institute [NCI] Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE]; see Section 
A3–2); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance 
(such as severe headache without any further findings).  
Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event recorded on the electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF ). 
Serious adverse events are required to be reported by [CONTACT_13657] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after the investigator becomes aware of the event ) (see Section  A3–5 for reporting instructions).  
A3–3 RECORDING AND FOLLOW -UP OF ADVERSE EVENT S 
AND/OR  SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
A3–3.1 ADVERSE EVENT AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT 
RECORDING  
When an adverse event or serious adverse event  occurs, it is the responsibility of the 
investigator to review all documentation (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory 
reports, and diagnostics reports) related to the event. 
The investigator will then record all relevant adverse event or serious adverse event  
information on  the eCRF.

records to  the Sponsor in lieu of completion of the Adverse Event  eCRF.  
There may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_580972] .  In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the 
participant number, will be redacted on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_12997] . 
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event on the basis of signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information.  Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the 
individual signs  or sympto ms) will be documented as the adverse event or serious 
adverse event . 
A3–3.2 A SSESS MENT OF SEVERITY  
The investigator will make an assessment of  the severity of each adverse event and 
serious adverse event during the study and assign it to one of the categories  in 
Table A3-1. 
Table  A3-1 Adverse Event Severity Grading Scale  
Severity Description  
Mild An event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_2299], causing minimal 
discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities  
Moderate  An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal everyday activities  
Severe  An event that prevents normal everyday activit ies 
An adverse event  that is assessed as severe should not be confused 
with a serious adverse event .  Severe is a category utilized for rating 
the severity of an event,  and both adverse events  and serious 
adverse events  can be assessed as severe. 
An event is defined as "serious" when it meets at least one of the 
predefined outcomes as described in the definition of a serious adverse event, NOT when it is rated as severe.  
 
A3–3.3 A SSESSMEN T OF C A[LOCATION_003]LITY  
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study treatment  and 
each occurrence of each adverse event or serious adverse event.  
A "reasonable possibility" of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or 
arguments to su ggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled 
out. 

Appendix 3:  Adverse Events:  Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, 
Follow -Up, and Reporting 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
94/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. 
Alternative causes, such as underlying diseases, concomitant therapy, and other risk 
factors, as well as  the temporal relationship of the event to study treatment 
administration, will be considered and investigated.  
The investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure and/or prescribing information  (for marketed products)  in his or her assessment.  
For each adverse event or serious adverse event, the investigator must  document in the 
medical notes that he or she has reviewed the adverse event or serious adverse event and has provided an assessment of causality.  
There may be situations in which a serious adverse event has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report to the Sponsor .  
However, it is very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the serious adverse event data to the Sponsor.  
The investigator may change his or her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242] -up 
information and send a serious adverse event follow -up report with the updated causality 
assessment. 
The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory 
reporting requirements.

histopathologic  examinations, or consultation with other health  care professionals.  
If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -up 
period, the investigator will provide the Sponsor with a copy of any post -mortem findings , 
including histopathology.  
New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed CRF.

(i.e., no more than 24 hours after the investigator becomes aware of the information).  
New significant information includes the following:  
• New signs or symptoms or a change in the diagnosis  
• Significant new diagnostic test results  
• Change in causality based on new information  
• Change in the event's outcome, including recovery  
• Additional narrative information on the clinical course of the event  
 
During the adverse event reporting period (defined in Section 8.3.1 ), resolution of 
adverse events (with dates) should be documented on the Adverse Event eCRF and in 
the participant's medical record to facilitate source data verification.  
A3–3.4.[ADDRESS_764001], the Sponsor or a designee may follow  up by [CONTACT_756], fax, email, and/or a monitoring visit to obtain 
additional case details and outcome information (e.g.,  from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_123444], consultant reports, autopsy reports) in order to perform an independent medical assessment of the reported case.  
A3–4 REPORTING OF SERIOUS  ADVER SE EVENTS 
A3–4.1 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVEN T REPORTING TO THE SPONSOR  
VIA AN  ELECTRONIC COLL ECTI ON TOOL  
The primary mechanism for reporting a serious  adverse event to t he Sponsor will be the 
electronic data collection tool, as described in S ection A3–5.  
If the electronic system is unavailable, the site will use the paper Clinical Trial Adverse 
Event/Special Situations Form , as described in Section A3–5, to report the event within 
24 hours.  
The site will enter the serious adverse event data into the electronic system as soon as it becomes  available.  
After the study is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool will be taken off  line to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data.  

Appendix 3:  Adverse Events:  Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, 
Follow -Up, and Reporting 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
96/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 If a site receives a report of a new serious adverse event from a study participant or 
receives updated data on a previously reported serious adverse event after the electronic data collection tool has been taken off  line, the site can report this information 
on a paper  Clinical Trial Adverse Event/Special Situations Form , as described in 
Section A3–5.  
A3–4.2 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVEN T REPORTING TO THE SPONSOR  
VIA PAPER CRF  
Under certain circumstances, serious adverse events may be reported to the Sponsor through use of a paper  Clinical Trial Adverse Event/Special Situations Form , as 
described in Section A3–5. 
A3–[ADDRESS_764002]  
A3–5.1 EVENTS THAT OCCUR PRIOR TO STUDY TREATMENT 
INITIATION  
After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study treatment, only serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention (e.g., biopsy, 
discontinuation of medications) should be reported.  The paper Clinical Trial Adverse 
Event/Special Situations Form  provided to investigators should be completed and 
submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after 
the investigator becomes aware of the event), either by [CONTACT_581046], using the fax number or email address provided to investigators.  
A3–5.[ADDRESS_764003] all case details that can be gathered immediately (i.e., within 24 hours after the investigator becomes aware of the event) on the Adverse Event eCRF 
and submit the report via the electronic data capture (EDC) system .  A report will be 
generated and sent to [COMPANY_002] Safety Risk Management by [CONTACT_27950].  
In the event that the EDC system is unavailable, the paper Clinical Trial Adverse 
Event/Special Situations Form  provided to investigators should be completed and 
submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after the investigator becomes aware of the event), either by [CONTACT_581046], using the fax number or email address provided to investigators .  
Once the EDC system is available, all information will need to be entered and submitted 
via the EDC system .

Follow -Up, and Reporting 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
97/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 Instructions for reporting serious adverse events that occur more than 14 days  after the 
final dose of study treatment are provided in Section A3–6. 
A3–6 REPORTING ADVERSE EV ENTS THAT OCCUR AFTER THE 
ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING PERIOD  
The Sponsor should be notified if the investigator becomes aware of any serious 
adverse event that occurs after the end of the adverse event reporting period (defined as  
14 days after the final dose of study treatment), if the event is believed to be related to 
prior exposure to study treatment .  These events should be reported through use of the 
Adverse Event eCRF.  However, if the EDC system is not available, the investigator should report these events directly to the Sponsor or its designee, either by [CONTACT_169881]/Special Situations Form , 
using the fax number or email address provided to investigators.  
A3–7 PROCEDURES FOR RECORDING  ADVERSE EVENTS  
When an adverse event occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation related to the event (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory reports, and diagnosti cs reports) .  The investigator will then record all relevant adverse event 
information on the Adverse Event eCRF.  It is not acceptable for the investigator to send 
photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_10914]'s medical records to the Medical Monitor in lieu of completi on of the eCRF .  Investigators should use correct medical terminology and 
concepts when recording adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Avoid 
colloquialisms and abbreviations .  Only one adverse event term should be recorded in 
the event field of the Adverse Event eCRF.  
There may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_29482] .  In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the 
participant number, will be redacted on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_580973].  
A3–7.1 DIAGNOSIS VERSUS SIG NS AND SYMPTOMS  
A diagnosis (if known) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than 
individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice,  asterixis, and elevated transaminases) .  However, if a constellation of signs 
and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF .  If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously reported adverse events 
based on signs and symptoms should be nullified and replaced by [CONTACT_25746], with a starting date that corresponds to the starti ng 
date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis.  

Appendix 3:  Adverse Events:  Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, 
Follow -Up, and Reporting 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
98/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 A3–7.2 ADVERSE EVENTS THAT ARE SECONDARY TO OTHER 
EVENTS  
In general, adverse events that are secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or 
clinical sequelae) should be identified by [CONTACT_5252],  with the exception of 
severe or serious secondary events .  A medically significant secondary adverse event 
that is separated in time from the initiating event should be recorded as an independent event on the Adverse Event eCRF.  For example:  
• If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, 
only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF  
• If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF 
• If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF 
• If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all three events should be reported separately on the eCRF 
• If neutropenia is accompanied by [CONTACT_25747], both events should be reported separately on the eCRF  
 
All adverse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is 
unclear as to whether the events are associated. 
A3–7.3 PERSISTENT OF RECURRENT ADVERSE EVENTS  
A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between participant  evaluation timepoints .  Such events should only be recorded once on the 
Adverse Event eCRF.  The initial severity (intensity or grade) of the event will be 
recorded at the time the event is f irst reported .  If a persistent adverse event becomes 
more severe, the most extreme severity should also be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF .  If the event becomes serious, it should be reported to the Sponsor immediately 
(i.e., no more than 24 hours aft er the investigator becomes aware that the event became 
serious; see Section A3–5 for reporting instructions) .  The Adverse Event eCRF should 
be updated by  [CONTACT_25748] "non -serious" to "serious," providing the date 
that the event became serious, and completing all data fields related to serious adverse events.  
A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between participant  evaluation timepoints 
and subsequently recurs .  Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded as a 
separate event on the Adverse Event eCRF.

Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
99/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 A3–7.[ADDRESS_764004] be 
reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:  
• Is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]  
• Results in a change in study treatment  (e.g., dose modification, treatment  
interruption, or treatment  discontinuation)  
• Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) 
or a change in concomitant therapy  
• Is clinically significant in the investigator's judgment  
 
It is the investigator's responsibility to review all laboratory findings .  Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory 
abnormality should be classified as an adverse event.   Please see Section 8.3.[ADDRESS_764005] and associated reporting requirements.  
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g.,  ALP and bilirubin 5
 × upper limit of normal (U LN) associated with cholestasis), only 
the diagnosis (i.e.,  cholestasis) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a descriptor indicating whether the test result is above or below the normal range (e.g.,  "elevated potassium," as opposed to "abnormal potassium") .  If the laboratory 
abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the clinical term should be recorded as the adverse event .  For example, an elevated serum 
potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as "hyperkalemia."  
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormalit y from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section A3–7.3 for 
details on recording persistent adverse events).  
A3–7.5 ABNORMAL VITAL SIGN VALUES  
Not every abnormal vital sign value qualifies as an adverse event .  A vital sign 
abnormality  that is associated with the underlying disease should not be reported as an 
adverse event unless judged by [CONTACT_382254].  A 

Appendix 3:  Adverse Events:  Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, 
Follow -Up, and Reporting 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
100/Protocol BN43546, Version [ADDRESS_764006] be reported 
as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: 
• Is accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]  
• Results in a change in study treatment  (e.g., dose modification, treatment  
interruption, or treatment  discontinuation)  
• Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy  
• Is clinically significant in the investigator's judgment  
 
It is the investigator's responsibility to review all vital sign findings .  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality 
should be classified as an adverse event.  
If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a dis ease or syndrome 
(e.g.,  high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (e.g.,  hypertension) should be recorded 
on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section A3–7.3 for 
details on recording persistent adverse events). 
A3–7.[ADDRESS_764007] ( > 3 × ULN) in combination with either an elevated 
total bilirubin ( > 2 × ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or other 
causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury (as defined by [CONTACT_25742]'s Law) .  Therefore, investigators must report as an adverse event the 
occurrence of either of the following:  
• Treatment -emergent ALT or AST >
 3 × upper limit of normal (ULN) in combination 
with total bilirubin > 2 × ULN 
• Treatment -emergent ALT or AST > 3 × ULN in combination with clinical jaundice 
 
The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section A3–7.1) 
and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after the 
investigator becomes aware of the event), either as a serious adverse event or an adverse event of special interest (see Section A3–5). 
A3–7.7 DEATHS  
All deaths that occur during the protocol- specified adverse event reporting period 
(see Section 8.3.1 ), regardless of relationship to study treatment , must be recorded on 
the Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to the Sponsor (s ee Section  A3–5).  

Appendix 3:  Adverse Events:  Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, 
Follow -Up, and Reporting 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
101/Protocol BN43546, Version [ADDRESS_764008] event .  The event or condition 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical 
concept on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Generally, only one such event should be 
reported.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of 
reporting, "unexplained death"  should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the 
cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), "unexplained death" should be replaced by [CONTACT_25749].  The term "sudden death"  should not be 
used unless combined with the presumed cause of death (e.g., "sudden cardiac death").  
A3–7.8 PREEXISTING MEDICAL CONDITIONS  
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study .  
Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline 
Conditions eCRF.  
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only if the 
frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study .  When 
recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important  to convey the concept 
that the preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] 
(e.g.,  "more frequent headaches").  
A3–7.[ADDRESS_764009]-TRAUMATIC 
STRESS D ISORDER ( PTSD )  
Medical occurrences or symptoms of deterioration that are anticipated as part of post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) should not be recorded as adverse event s.  
However, deterioration that is  judged by [CONTACT_581047] .  When recording an unanticipated worsening of  PTSD  on 
the Adverse Event eCRF, it is  important to convey the concept that the condition has 
changed by [CONTACT_9672] (e.g., "accelerated worsening of post-traumatic stress disorder "). 
A3–7.10 HOSPI[INVESTIGATOR_580974] (i.e., inpatient admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25676] a serious adverse event (per the definition of serious adverse event in Section A3–2), except as outlined 
below .  

Appendix 3:  Adverse Events:  Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, 
Follow -Up, and Reporting 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
102/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 An event that leads to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26664] a serious adverse event: 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a preexisting condition, provided that all of the following criteria 
are met:  
– The participant  was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_580975], was scheduled during the study despi[INVESTIGATOR_580976],  or was scheduled during the study when treatment 
became necessary because of the expected normal progression of the 
condition 
– The participant  has not experienced an adverse event  
 
An event that leads to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_580977] a serious adverse event, but should be reported as an adverse event 
instead:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_580978]  
 
A3–7.11 CASES OF OVERDOSE, MEDICATION ERROR, DRUG ABUSE, 
OR DRUG MISUSE  
Overdose (accidental or intentional), medication error, drug abuse, and drug misuse}  
(hereafter collectively referred to as "special situations") are defined as follows:  
• Accidental overdose:  accidental administration of a drug in a quantity that is higher 
than the assigned dose  
• Intentional overdose:  intentional administration of a drug in a quantity that is higher 
than the assigned dose  
• Medication error:  accidental deviation in the administration of a drug  
In some cases, a medication error may be intercepted prior to administration of 
the drug.  
• Drug abuse:  intentional excessive use of a drug that may lead to addiction or 
dependence, physical harm, and/or psychological harm}  
• Drug misuse:  intentional deviation in the administration of a drug that does not qualify as drug abuse  
In cases where drug is to be self -administered by [CONTACT_2299] , drug misuse 
could involve the drug being administered to someone other than the participant . 
 
Special situations are not in themselves adverse events, but may result in adverse 
events .  Each adverse event associated with a special situation should be recorded 
separately on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the associated adverse event fulfills 
Appendix 3:  Adverse Events:  Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, 
Follow -Up, and Reporting 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
103/Protocol BN43546, Version [ADDRESS_764010], the event should 
be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e.,  no more than 24 hours after the 
investigator becomes aware of the event; see Section A3–5).  For balovaptan or 
matching placebo, adverse events associated with special situations should be recorded as described below for each situation:  
• Accidental overdose:  Enter the adverse event term.  Check the "Accidental 
overdose" and "Medication error" boxes.  
• Intentional overdose:  Enter the adverse event term .  Check the "Intentional

the "Intentional overdose" and "Drug misuse" boxes. 
 
In addition, all special situations associated with balovaptan / matching placebo, 
regardless of whether they result in an adverse event, should be recorded on the 
Adverse Event eCRF as described below:  
• Accidental overdose:  Enter balovaptan and "accidental overdose" as the event 
term.  Check the "Accidental overdose" and "Medication error" boxes.  
• Intentional overdose:  Enter balovaptan and "intentional overdose" as the event 
term.  Check the "Intentional overdose" box .  If drug abuse is suspected, check the 
"Drug abuse" box .  If drug abuse is not suspected, check the "Drug misuse" box. 
• Medication error that does not qualify as an overdose:  Enter the name [CONTACT_26865] a description of the error (e.g., wrong dose administered, wrong

106/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 A4–1 PREGNANCIES IN FEMAL E PARTICIPANTS  
Female participants of childbearing potential will be instructed through the Informed 
Consent Form to immediately inform the investigator if they become pregnant during the study or within 14 days  after the final dose of balovaptan.   A paper Clinical Trial 
Pregnancy Reporting Form should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after the investigator becomes aware of the pregnancy), either by [CONTACT_581046], using the fax number or email address provided to investigators .  Pregnancy should not be recorded 
on the Adverse Event electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF ).  The investigator should 
discontinue study treatment and  counsel the participant, discussing the risks of the 
pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus .  Monitoring of the participant should 
continue until conclusion of the pregnancy .  Any serious adverse events associated with 
the pregnancy (e.g., an event in the fetus, an event in the mother during or af ter the 
pregnancy, or a congenital anomaly or birth defect in the child) should be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF .  In addition, the investigator will submit a Clinical Trial 
Pregnancy Reporting Form when updated information on the course and outcome o f the 
pregnancy becomes available.   
Attempts should be made to collect and report infant health information.  When permitted by [CONTACT_779], an Authorization for the Use and Disclosure of Infant Health Information would need to be signed by [CONTACT_123566] (as per local regulations) to allow for follow -up on the infant.  If the authorization has been signed, the infant's health status at 
birth should be recorded on the Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form.  In addition, the Sponsor may collect follow -up information on the infant's health status at 6 and 
12 months after birth.  
A4–2 ABORTIONS  
A spontaneous abortion should be classified as a serious adverse event (as  the Sponsor 
considers abortions to be medically significant), recorded on the Adverse Event eCR F, 
and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after the 
investigator becomes aware of the event; see Section A3–5). 
If a therapeutic or elective abortion was performed because of an underlying maternal or embryofetal toxicity, the toxicity should be classified as a serious adverse event, recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after the investigator becomes aware of the event; see 
Section A3–5).  A therapeutic or elective abortion performed for reasons other than an 
underlying maternal or embryofetal toxicity is not considered an adverse event.

Genetics:  Use and Analysis of DNA  
Genetic variation may impact a participant’s response to study treatment and 
susceptibility to, and severity and progression of, disease.  Variable response to study 
treatment may be due to genetic determinants that impact drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion; mechanism of action of the drug; disease etiology; and/or 
molecular subtype of the disease being treated.  Therefore, where local regulations and 
the Institutional  Review Board or Ethics Committee allow, a blood sample will be 
collected for DNA analysis from consenting participants. 
DNA samples will be use d for research related to balovaptan in post-traumatic stress 
disorder (PTSD)  and related diseases .  They may also be used to develop tests or 
assays, including diagnostic tests related to balovaptan and PTSD .  Genetic research 
may consist of the analysis of one or more candidate genes or the analysis of genetic 
markers throughout the genome (as appropriate).   
DNA samples will be analyzed for  genetic variation that may be associated with disease 
trajectory, diagn osis, or treatment response.   Additional  analyses may be conducted if it 
is hypothesized that this may help further understand the clinical data.  
The samples may be analyzed as part of a multistudy assessment of genetic factors 
involved in the response to balovaptan or study treatments of this class to understand 
PTSD  or related conditions.  
The results of genetic analyses may be reported in the Clinical Study Report or in a separate study summary.  
The Sponsor will store the DNA samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality.  
The samples will be retained while research on balovaptan or PTSD continues but no 
longer than 15 years or other period as per local requirements.

Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
110/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 Balovaptan is not approved for clinical use in any country for any indication.  However, 
clinical trials in healthy volunteers and participants with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have not revealed adverse drug reactions considered causally related to the administration of balovaptan.  The safety plan for participants in this study is based on potential safety risks related to toxicities observed in animals and hypothetical risks related to the mechanism of action of balovaptan.  Please refer to the Balovaptan 
Investigator's Brochure for a complete summary of safety information.  
Several measures will be taken to ensure the safety of study participants and minimize hypothetical risks.  Eligibility criteria have been designed to exclude individuals at higher risk for toxicities.  Participants will undergo comprehensive safety monit oring during the 
study, including assessment of the nature, frequency, and severity of adverse events.  In addition, guidelines for managing adverse events, including criteria for treatment interruption or discontinuation, are provided in the following sec tion. 
A6–1 POTENTIAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WIT H BALOVAPTAN  
A6–1.[ADDRESS_764011] level (NOAEL) the balovaptan maximum concentration 
(Cmax) based safety margin for electroencephalogram (EEG) effects is approx imately  
36-fold to the C max for a [ADDRESS_764012] been noted in rats.  
Mechanistically, the blockade of the vaso pressin 1a ( V1a) receptor may rather not 
possess pro -convulsive effects given that seizure threshold lowering effects of low -dose 
vasopressin were reversed by [CONTACT_941] V1a receptor SR49059 in the pentylenetetrazole paradigm in mice (Javadian et al. 2016).

In conclusion,  the risk of balovaptan to lower the seizure threshold is considered 
minimal.  Participants with a history of seizures  who are well controlled within the

therapy, may be enrolled in this study.  
A6–1.[ADDRESS_764015] pronounced changes observed in peripheral neutrophils.  The bone marrow of affected dogs, however, did not show hypocellularity but rather normocellularity to hypercellularity.  The hematologic abnormalities were reversible after drug discontinuation.  
The area under the concentration− time curve (AUC) at the NOAE L for the observed 
hematological toxicity in the dog provides a margin relative to a 10 -mg QD dose in 
human adults of about 21- fold for the parent molecule, about 4.5- fold for the metabolite 3 
(M3), and of about 3. 5-fold for the  metabolite 2  (M2).  M2 is not a major metabolite in 
dogs and is not considered relevant for this effect.   
No hematotoxicity was observed in toxicology studies in rats.  
Across clinical trials, [ADDRESS_764016]  (Study WP40734) developed a decrease in absolute 
neutrophil count ( ANC) (from approximately 1300/ µL at pre -treatment to 500− 700/ µL) at 
a dose of [ADDRESS_764017] was withdrawn from the trial.  
Six pediatric participants  taking 10 mg or an equivalent dose based on predicted 
exposure ( Study BP30153) experienced events of neutropenia (4 events in 
4 participants)  and neutrophil count decreased (2 events in 2  participants) , of which 
4 were moderate and 2  were mild.  One pa rticipant  had neutropenia that was ongoing 
at the end of the study, however , this was in the context of acute lymphocytic leukemia 
and Epstein Barr virus infection and was not considered to be associated with balovaptan .  One participant  recovered despi[INVESTIGATOR_580979] 4  recovered after dose interruption or withdrawal.  All events occurred after 
20 weeks of study therapy and the majority were temporally associated with an infection .  Neutropenia is relatively frequent in children, and an association with virus 
infection is recognized  (Callejas Caballero et  al. 2021) .  When the events reported in the 
other dose groups are considered, a difference in frequency was not seen with comparison to the placebo group (10  mg balovaptan equivalent dose [eq] 2 participants 
[1.7%], 4 mg balovaptan eq 2 participants [1.2%], placebo 2  participants  [1.9%], open -
label extension  10 mg balovaptan eq 4 participants  [2.0%]) .  
Appendix 6:  Safety Plan:  Management of Identified and Potential Risks  
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
112/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 There were no events of neutropenia or leukopenia in adult patients with ASD taking 
10 mg in Study BP30153. 
Please refer to the Balovaptan Investigator's Brochure for further details.  
Overall, the available clinical safety database does not suggest a causal neutropenia risk due to balovaptan administration.  However, participants receiving concomitant 
treatment with clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_580980].  Patients with clinically significant hematologic abnormalities or history of blood dyscrasias, hematologic malignancies, or myelosuppression (including iatrogenic) will be excluded from the study.  Safety surveillance in Study  BN43546 includes hematological 
monitoring and check for clinical signs and symptoms of infection.  
A6–1.3 POTENTIAL RISK OF SKELETAL MUSCLE TOXI CITY  
Skeletal muscle degeneration associated with increases in creatine phosphokinase (CPK) was noted after treatment with a high dose of balovaptan in male rats.  
After  treatment completion, these effects promptly reversed.  The mechanism of 
balovaptan effects on skeletal muscle in rats is unclear.  In vitro experiments indicate that M3 may  play a major role.  This is consistent with this finding only being observed in 
male rats that have higher M3 exposures than female rats.  No mitochondrial toxicity or 
cytotoxicity due to cell -cycle inhibition was demonstrated.  Based on AUC  values 
measur ed at NOAEL, the margins relative to anticipated AUC after [ADDRESS_764018] to M3.  
In the literature, the involvement of the V1a receptor to regain muscle integrity after tumor necrosis factor -α exposure has been suggested based on V1a receptor gene 
delivery experiments in mice (Costa et al. 2014).  No skeletal muscle effects of balovaptan have been observed in dogs.  
In humans, a severe adverse event of rhabdomyolysis was reported in a patient with 
ASD treated with 1.5 mg  QD balovaptan, and occasional CPK elevations were noted in 
clinical trials.  Nevertheless, the totality of clinical data available to date (including 
analysis of CPK values and musculoskeletal adverse events) does not indicate a safety alert for skeletal muscle toxicity due to balovaptan.  This conclusion is based on the observations that CPK elevations were also measured in placebo -treated subjects with 
ASD and that treatment -emergent  CPK elevations decreased when treatment was 
continued.  CPK levels will be monitored during the study drug treatment period and with a defined CPK -related adverse event of special interest.   
Please refer to the Balovaptan Investigator's Brochure for additional details.  
Appendix 6:  Safety Plan:  Management of Identified and Potential Risks  
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
113/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 Overall, the risk of skeletal muscle toxicity for this study is considered minimal given the 
safety margin relative to NOAEL noted in rats, the absence o f skeletal muscle toxicity in 
dogs , and the clinical trial experience not indicating sk eletal muscle toxicity.  
In addition to adverse event monitoring, CPK levels will be used to monitor for possible 
occurrences of skeletal muscle toxicity.  
A6–1.[ADDRESS_764019] -natal day (PND) 14  (juveni le to adult) , an increase in heart 
weight was observed at the highest dose tested.  The increase in heart weight was considered non -adverse based on the lack of associated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) 
changes or a histopathological correlate.  In the 26-week  Good Laboratory Practice 
(GLP) toxicology study in adult rats, an increased incidence of spontaneous cardiomyopathy changes was observed, but these changes were considered to be non-adverse exacerbations due to stress.   Cardiac pathologies were not observed when 
balovaptan was administered to dogs in GLP toxicology studies .  
Intense exploration of interference with cardiac ion channels for balovaptan and its M3 
and M2, did not reveal a pre- clinical safety alert for QTc prolongation.  
In clinical trials, treatment with balovaptan (10 mg QD) for more than 12 weeks did not 
produce a cardiac toxicity alert based on clinical adverse event  reporting and monitoring 
with cardiac biomarkers (troponin and N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide 
[NT-proBNP]).   Results from a thorough QT study are available ( Study WP40734) and 
confirmed absence of corrected QT interval (QTc)  prolonging effects after administration 
of balovaptan at 10 mg and 50 mg QD dosing regimens.  
The risk of  cardiac toxicity in Study BN43546 is considered minimal because of  the lack 
of cardiac toxicity in dogs , the delayed onset of cardiac effects in rats (which were 
considered stress -related rather than direct cardiac effects , and in particular the absence 
of a safety alert from dedicated cardiac monitoring in clinical trials .  
Safety monitoring in Study BN43546 will include  ECG,  adverse event monitoring and 
assessment of  high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T ( hs-cTnT) in conjunction with a 
follow -up plan if elevated hs -cTnT levels are measured.   
A6–1.[ADDRESS_764020] article −related microscopic effects were 
observed in multiple peripheral nerves (degeneration of the perineurium with edema and cellular infiltrates).  The onset of peripheral nerve histopathology effects was seen as early as 13 weeks of treatment, and further progression noted after 26 weeks of 
Appendix 6:  Safety Plan:  Management of Identified and Potential Risks  
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
114/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 treatment.  Changes in peripheral nerve histology were found to be associated with and 
preceded by [CONTACT_581048] (i.e., a reduction in nerve conduction velocity  (NCV)  noted at Week 6, no relevant changes to amplitude in line with 
dominating pathology of perineurium and myelin sheath rather than axonal loss).  The electrophysiogical abnormalities were recorded for sensory and mixed nerves and not for motoric nerves.  The histopathologic changes did not fully recover within the 13- week 
recovery period included in the 26- week GLP toxicology study while the 
electrophysiological changes did.  Of note, across sexes, the emergence of peripheral nerve toxicities does not correlate with parent plasma levels but with the plasma levels of M3.  It is unproven whether the peripheral nerve effects seen in rats are caused by [CONTACT_581049] M3 moiety; however, the incidence of the effects are better correlated with M3 levels than with the parent.  The M2 is not considered to be the causative agent because of low plasma levels.  The margins between the plasma levels at the NOAEL and those after 10- mg QD dose in humans are about 10- fold wit h regard to parent and about 
20-fold lower with reg ard to M3  for the 10 mg  QD balovaptan dose .  In addition to the 
effects on peripheral nerves, perivascular inflammation in certain regions of the brain was observed in rats; however, the respective safety margins are about 2- fold higher.   
No such neurohistopathologies were seen in dogs.   
In clinical trials, neurological monitoring (including quantitative vibration testing) did not 
reveal a signal of treatment -emergent peripheral neuropathy or other neurologic 
abnormalities.  In [ADDRESS_764021] reported occasional tingling in the 
feet that was indicative of preexisting peripheral neuropathy; however, no specific cause for peripheral neuropathy could be identified.  
The risk of study treatment linked peripheral neuropathy for participants in this study is considered to be minimal because of the safety margins relative to the NOAEL in rats, no neurohistopathologies have been noted in dogs, and the results from neurological monitoring in clinical trials have not generated a signal for balovapt an caused peripheral 
neuropathy .  
This study excludes participants  with signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy.  
Neurologic examinations focusing on the lower limbs (longer nerves being more susceptible to neuropathy) will be completed during the study (see the schedule of 
Appendix 6:  Safety Plan:  Management of Identified and Potential Risks  
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
115/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 activities in Section 1.3, Table 1 ).  The neurological examination must be conducted as 
outlined in Appendix  7.  
Please refer to the Balovaptan Investigator's Brochure for additional details.  
A6–1.[ADDRESS_764022] shown a bleeding risk.  
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor s (SSRIs ) have been shown to possess a bleeding 
risk, even though fairly small  (Dalton et al. 2006; Serebruany 2006).  In the ASD clinical 
trials 156 subjects were receiving concomitant SSRI medications.   No bleeding risk 
events were reported.  
Patients  with a history of coagulopathies or other bleeding disorders or current clinically 
relevant bleeding event will be excluded from the study.   
Treatment with study drug should be stopped about 1 week prior to surgeries and 
invasive procedures anticipated to  be associated with major blood losses or bleedings in 
sensitive organs (e.g., eye, brain, and spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]).  
A6–1.7 POTENTIAL RISK OF BLOOD PRESSURE CHANG ES  
Given the vasoconstrictive effects on systemic resistance blood vessels of vasopressin mediated through t he V1a receptor, blockade of this receptor by [CONTACT_581050].  However, in a cardiovascular safety pharmacology study conducted in telemetered dogs, an increase in blood pressure was observed with an 
approximately 19-fold margin between the  NOAEL C max for the dog (1917 ng/mL) and 
the predicted highest average C max for participants in Study BN43546 (103  ng/mL).   The 
physiology behind the blood pressure increase seen in dogs is unknown.  
Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring of healthy volunteers was included in clinical Study WP40734 (a thorough QT study), which evaluated both a 10  mg QD and a 50  mg 
QD treatment regimen  over 2 weeks.  No  significant blood pressure changes emerged; in 
particular, no decrease in blood pressure measurements  was observed.   
The absence of a decrease in blood pressure may be explained by [CONTACT_581051] V1a receptor and/or by [CONTACT_581052] V1a 
receptor is compensated by [CONTACT_581053].  

Appendix 6:  Safety Plan:  Management of Identified and Potential Risks  
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
116/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 Nevertheless, participants should be instructed to avoid rapid movements when moving 
from supi[INVESTIGATOR_580981].   Blood pressure will be monitored at regular 
interval s during the treatment period.  
A6–2 MANAGEMENT OF PARTICIPANT S WHO EXPERIENCE 
ADVERSE EVENTS  
A6–2.1 DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
No dose modifications will be allowed in this study.  
A6–2.2 TREATMENT  INTERRUPTION 
Balovaptan may be withheld in participants who experience toxicity considered to be 
related to study drug.  If balovaptan has been  withheld for >10 days because of toxicity, 
the participant  should be discontinued from study drug, unless resumption of treatment  
is approved by [CONTACT_581054] .  
Balovaptan may be withheld for reasons other than toxicity (e.g., surgical procedures) at 
the investigator's discretion following consultation with  the Medical Monitor .  The 
investigator may consult  the Medical Monitor to determine the acceptable length of 
treatment  interruption.  
A6–2.3 MANAGEMENT OF SEIZURES  
While the risk of seizure/convulsive events due to balovaptan is considered minimal, 
local treatment guidelines should be followed to manage such e vents  should they occur .  
Participants  experiencing an adverse event  of convulsion should be seen by  [CONTACT_581055], they should be referred to a clinical 
expert in the area of epi[INVESTIGATOR_580982] .  These  may include 24-hour 
dedicated video EEG monitoring.  Collection of blood and urine samples is 
recommended to measure, as applicable, levels of balovaptan, any anti -eplieptic dr ugs, 
drugs of abuse, glucose, and electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, magnesium).  If 
possible, a blood sample for prolactin should be taken within 1 hour since seizure onset.  
Psychogenic non- epi[INVESTIGATOR_580983] h PTSD  
(Popkirov et al. 2019; Perez et al. 2016) .  Vital signs should be monitored and a 12 -lead 
ECG recorded as soon as possible.    
Depending on the nature and severity of the convulsive event, it may not result in 
permanent study treatment discontinuation .   
Adverse events  of seizure/ convulsion should be discussed with the Medical Monitor as 
soon as possible.

Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
117/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 A6–2.4 MANAGEMENT OF NEUTROPENIA  
As outlined above, the risk of relevant neutropenia due to balovaptan is considered low.  
In case of emergent neutropenia,  treatment discontinuation is suggested for participants 
who meet the following criterion for decreased ANC:  
• If the ANC falls < 800/ µL and the low ANC is confirmed in a second sample to be 
obtained within about 3 days, the investigator should consider trea tment 
discontinuation.   In cases of ANC -related  treatment discontinuation, additional 
laboratory parameters should be considered by [CONTACT_093], including 
fibrinogen,  high-sensi tivity C- reactive protein (hs-CRP) , and an assessment for 
anti−neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ( ANCA ).  
• Follow -up management of participants  who experience fever and/or infection in the 
context of reduced ANC should be discussed with the Medical Monitor and the 
participant  may be referred to a specialist to decide on next steps .   
 
ANC values below 800/ µL (confirmed) , should be reported as an adverse event of 
special interest  (see Appendix  3, Section A3–5). 
A6–2.[ADDRESS_764023] known bleeding risks.  Based on the clinical significance of the bleeding, 
treatment with study drug should be interrupted and may be permanently discontinued if no alternative causative factors of the bleeding adverse event  can be identified  and 
removed. 
Blood samples to assess coagulation parameters (INR, PT, aPTT) as well as balovaptan 
blood levels should be taken.  
A6–2.6 MANAGEMENT OF SKELET AL MUSCLE TOXICITY  
Elevated CPK levels at screening and baseline are not exclusions as long as serum creatinine and potassium values do not exceed the upper limit of normal ( ULN) .  In 
instances where CPK is increased more than 2×ULN at screening, additional CPK, 
creatinine, and potassium samples should also be obtained at Week 2 of treatment.  
Samples from screening, baseline, Week 2, and Week 6 can then indicate whether an 
elevated CPK level observed at screening is part of a fluctuation because of physical 
exercise, for example, or is indicative of inherently elevated CPK levels in an individual participants .  Participants  are advised to abstain from intense physical exercise and to 
report musculoskeletal adverse events to the Investigator promptly.  

Appendix 6:  Safety Plan:  Management of Identified and Potential Risks  
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
118/Protocol BN43546, Version [ADDRESS_764024] definition 
(see Section 8.3.7 ), participants  should be evaluated for use of any concomitant 
medication as well as occurrence of any recent accidents or physical exercise.  In the 
event that CPK values exceed 10× ULN, confirmatory samples should be obtained within 
3−5 days, depending on the actual CPK value and circumstances, for example,  whether 
or not a possible alternative explanation like an accident or sports is present.  Serum 
creatinine and serum potassium levels should be measured at the same time.  An ECG 
recording may provide information about QRS complex changes and arrhythmias 
potentially related to changes in potassium. 
Hydration status should be assessed and intake of fluids is advised.  The need for 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_580984], respectively, should be 
considered, depending on the CPK increase and a participant ’s hydration status.  The 
investigator may decide to temporarily withdraw treatment if no alternative explanation exists and CPK values do not show a trend for normalization according to the half -life of 
CPK in plasma.  Treatment may be re -started once CPK values have shown a c lear 
trend toward normalization and if CPK increases were not associated with relevant kidney dysfunction.  CPK levels should be monitored until they are below 2× ULN or in 
the range of  screening and baseline values.    
CPK l aboratory abnormality as per Section 8.3.[ADDRESS_764025] . 
CPK values will be assessed at baseline, at Week 6 and Week 12 (see the schedule of 
activities in Section 1.3 [see Table 1 ]) as well as at the post -treatment follow -up visit.  
A6–2.7 MANAGEMENT OF CARDIAC ADVERSE EVENTS  
Increases in the Corrected QT Interval ( QTc) Interval  
There is no preclinical or clinical evidence that  balovaptan administration may be 
associated with an increase in the QTc interval.   Nevertheless, treatment should be 
discontinued in case of the following:  
• Sustained (at least two ECG measurements >30 minutes apart) QT interval 
corrected through use of Fridericia's formula ( QTcF ) that is >500 ms and >60 ms 
longer than the baseline value.  In this instance, serum electrolytes, in particular, 
potassium , and magnesium, as well as use of any concomitant medications should 
be analyzed as a potential cause of the increase in the QTc interval.  
Management of participants  with sustained QTc prolongation should include close 
monitoring, with ECGs repeated until two successive ECGs show resolution of the findings, correction of any electrolyte abnormalities, and possible discontinuation of other concomitant medications that are known to prolong the QTc interval.  Consultation with a

such participants .  
Signs and Symptoms of Cardiac Toxicity  
As outlined above, the risk of cardiac toxicity to participants in this study is considered minimal. 
An algorithm relative to results from cardiac troponin T ( cTnT) monitoring is provided in 
Section 7.1.[ADDRESS_764027]  should be 
considered with urgency driven by [CONTACT_581056], but are not limited to, 24 -hour ECG recordings and echocardiographic 
examinations.    
Control of vital signs and by [CONTACT_581057].  
Blood samples for cardiac biomarker monitoring (hs -cTnT, troponin I, NT -proBNP) and 
to measure blood levels of balov aptan together with the information of the time interval 
since last intake of study medication should be obtained as soon as possible.  
A check of all concomitant medications should be performed and documented.  In 
addition,  a urine drug screen should be performed. 
For further details see Section 7.1.4 . 
A6–2.[ADDRESS_764028].  
Circumstances should be carefully evaluated; for example,  rapid blood pressure 
decrease due to rapid body erection, dehydration situations , blood sample draw , or a 
blood pressure increase caused by  [CONTACT_144376].  It is advised to c heck for concomitant 
medications and  conduct a urine drug screen.

Appendix 6:  Safety Plan:  Management of Identified and Potential Risks  
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
120/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 Participants  should be reminded to avoid situations of rapid fluid shift from the upper to 
the lower part of the body.  In context of blood pressure increases, ambulatory blood 
pressure monitoring  (ABPM ) may be considered.  
In case of persistent blood pressure changes, participants  should be seen by a clinical 
expert in the field of blood pressure regulation. 
Depending on the magnitude and clinical rele vance of the blood pressure observed, 
treatment with study drug may be interrupted or even permanently withdrawn.   In such 
situations, blood samples to measure balovaptan levels in blood should be considered.  
A6–2.9 MANAGEMENT OF NEUROL OGIC AL TOXICITY /PERIPHERAL 
NEUROPATHY  
This study excludes patients with signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy.  
Neurologic examinations (see  Appendix  7) will be performed as per the schedule of 
activit ies (Section 1.3, Table 1 ).  
Adverse events of neurological abnormalities should be discussed with the Medical 
Monitor as soon as possible.  
Cases of neurological abnormalities emerging from adverse event reporting or neurological examination that are potentially indicative of dysfunction of peripheral nerves or otherwise represent a neurological deficit and for which no other explanation is apparent  should be reported as an adverse event  of special interest (see Section 8.3.7 ).  
For such cases, the investigator is encouraged to seek advice from and have the participant  seen by [CONTACT_581059] (neurologist).  
Furthermore, a NCV  exam may be recommended as a follow -up for these adverse 
events.  The investigator must inform  the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 
24 hours after the investigator becomes aware of the data) of all out of range NCV data.  
To define pathological values from the NCV examinations, the range of normal values of 
the investigating electrophysiological laboratory will be used.   Repeat measurements 
may be indicated to describe the NCV  over a prolonged period of time, allowing 
interpretation of the case.   
Verified symptoms indicative of peripheral neuropathy should be considered to trigger permanent treatment discontinuation of the partic ipant.  Participants are asked to report 
any signs and symptoms indicative of peripheral neuropathy (e.g., burning, pain, numbness, tingling, impaired motoric skills) to the investigator as soon as possible.

Equipment needed:  
• Cotton swab or Q -tip® 
• Disposable neurological pin 
• Tendon hammer  
• Metal tuning fork  
 
Ask the study participant:  
“Do you have any new numbness, pain, tingling or unusual sensations anywhere on your body, e.g., in your arms, hands,  feet, legs, lower back, or buttocks?”  
• If yes, ask about the onset, distribution, quality, intensity, and frequency and 
document on the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  
“Do you have new weakness in your  arms, hands,  legs or feet or any changes in how 
you are walking?”  
• If yes, document new symptoms on the eCRF.  
 
Guided examination of the upper limbs: Document any new abnormalities on the eCRF.  
Item 1: Sensation  
For each location indicated below and on the diagram (see  Figure 1), ask the 
participant to close his or her eyes.  Use the top of the sternum as the reference 
point.  Ask the participant if the sensation feels the same, decreased, or 
increased.  
• Distal fifth digit dorsal (n ulnaris) ; part of dermatome C8 assessed 
• Distal third digit dorsal (n medianus) : part of dermatome C7 assessed 
• Latero -distal thumb (n radialis ); part of dermatome C6  assessed  
 
Light Touch 
• Touch the Q -tip/cotton swab to each indicated location on each hand.  
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_29107]  
• Touch the disposable neurologic pin to each indicated location on each hand.  
 
Cold  
• Touch the metal tuning fork to each indicated location- on each hand.

123/Protocol BN43546, Version 3  
Vibration  
• Hit the tuning fork and ask the participant if he or she can feel buzzing when it is 
placed on the sternum.   
• Then, hit the tuning fork again and place it on the indicated locations and ask the participant whether he or she can sense the vibration.  
  
Item 2: Power  
For each arm, check the power of the participant to perform the following maneuvers 
against resistance:  
• elbow flexion and extension 
• thumb abduction   
 
Instructions for elbow flexion:  
Myotomes assessed:  C5/6 (musculocutaneous and radial nerve) and Muscles 
assessed:   biceps brachii, coracobrachialis, and brachialis  
• Ask the patient to flex their elbow : “Put your hands up like a boxer.”  
• Apply resistance by [CONTACT_581060]:  “Don’t let 
me pull your arm away from you.”  
 Instructions for elbow extension:  
Myotome assessed:  C7 (radial nerve) and muscles assessed: triceps brachii  
• With the patient’s elbows still in the flexed position, apply resistance by [CONTACT_581061] m towards the patient whilst stabilizing the shoulder joint:  “Don’t let me push 
your arm towards you.”  
  
Instructions for thumb abduction: 
Myotome assessed:  T1 (median nerve) and muscle assessed: abductor pollicis brevis  
• Ask the patient to turn their hand over so their palm is facing upwards and to 
position their thumb over the midline of the palm. Advise them to keep it in this 
position whilst you apply downward resistance with your own thumb:  “Point your 
thumbs to the ceiling and don’t let me push them down.”  
  
Note any new onset weakness (i.e., power less than full strength with maximum effort 
against resistance).  
• Each movement is to be rated as per the scale proposed by [CONTACT_581062] :  
Appendix 7:  Structured Brief Interview and Examination for Peripheral Neuropathy

1: muscle activation without movement  
2: move with gravity  
3: move (“just”) against gravity  
4: good / against resistance, but not normal muscle 
power  
5: normal strength  
 
Guided physical examination of the lower limbs:  Document any new abnormalities on 
the eCRF.  
Expose both of the study participant’s legs from the upper thighs downward.  
Item 1: Gait  
• Observe the study participant’s natural gait.  
• Ask the study participant to walk on his or her tiptoes and then on the back of the 
heels.  This will elicit any compensated weakness or dystonia.  
• Ask the study participant to walk heel -to-toe in a straight line.  This will bring out any 
uncoordination due to sensory or motor neuropathy or cerebellar signs.  
 
Item 2: Tone and Deep Tendon Reflexes 
• Ask the study participant to lie on the examination couch and to relax his or her legs.  
• Observe any new signs of deformity, fasciculation, wasting, or atrophic sk in 
changes.  
• Asking the participant to remain relaxed, gently roll each leg in laterally and 
medially.  Then support each knee in dorsiflexion with your palm.  Gently lift each 
leg and allow it to fall naturally.  
• Put each leg into dorsiflexion at the knee.   Use the tendon hammer to tap the 
patellar tendon to elicit the patellar reflex.  Then place the legs flat with the knee and ankle dorsiflexed.  Tap the Achilles tendon to elicit the ankle reflex.  
• Finally with the leg relaxed, take the plantar surface of  each foot in turn and sharply 
dorsiflex the ankle to check for clonus (sustained clonus of >5 beats is abnormal).  
• Grade the reflex response as: No (“0”), little (“ +”), moderate (“ ++”), or strong (“ +++”) 
reaction (patellar and ankle reflexes) 
• Check for emerging clonus when plantar surface of foot is dorsiflexed sharply 
(plantar reflex).  
- Note: sustained clonus of >5 beats is abnorma  
Note any abnormalities of tone, hyporeflexia, hyperreflexia, or sustained clonus.

Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
125/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 Item 3: Power  
For each leg, check the power of the participant to perform the following maneuvers 
against resistance:  
• Hip flexion and extension  
• Knee flexion and extension  
• Ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion  
 
Note any new onset weakness (i.e., power less than full strength with maximum effort 
against resistance).  
• Each movement is to be rated as per  the scale proposed by [CONTACT_581062]: 
0: no muscle function  
1: muscle activation without movement  
2: move with gravity  
3: move (“just”) against gravity  
4: good / against resistance, but not normal muscle 
power  
5: normal strength  
  
Item 4: Sensation  
For each dermatome indicated on the diagram (see Figure 2 : S1, S2, L2, L4, and L5), 
ask the participant to close his or her eyes.  Use the top of the sternum as the reference 
point.  Ask the participant if the sensation feels the same, decreased, or increased.  
Light Touch  
• Touch the Q -tip/cotton swab to the sternum and then each indicated dermatome 
(S1, S2, L2, L4, and L5) on each leg.

Protocol Amendment History  
A rationale for the current amendment precedes the Table of Contents.  
PROTOCOL AMENDMENT, VERSION 2 :  [ADDRESS_764042] recent feedback from the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) after submission of the Investigational New Drug Application.  
In addition, Sponsor -initiated modifications have been incorporated including clari fication 
of non-pharmacological interventions and the number of interim analyses to be 
performed .  Substantive changes to the protocol, along with a rationale for each change, 
are summarized below.  
• The exclusion criterion for moderate or severe hepatic  and renal  impairment was 
updated to include specific grading criteria ; Child -Pugh classification, and eGFR, 
respectively (Section 5.2). 
• An exclusion criterion was added for participants with current or past gastrointestinal 
disease that could potentially lim it the absorption of study drug.  Some reduction in 
gastrointestinal absorption is considered acceptable since the brain receptor 
occupancy is predicted to remain relatively high with even moderate reduction in absorption (Section  5.2). 
• The exclusion criterion for participants currently receiving trauma- based 
psychotherapy was removed (Section 5.2) and clarification language was added 
describing the types and frequency of non -pharmacological interventions for 
post-traumatic stress disorder that are permitted  during the study (Section  6.8.1).    
• Language on screen failures was updated to more closely align with [COMPANY_002] Global Data Standards  (Section 5.4). 
• Following FDA comment to include structured questions about general and upper ext
remity neuropathy symptoms and to include upper extremity testing as part of the 
neurological evaluation, the following sections in the protocol have been updated.  
Section 7.1.5 now has a  section describing considerations for treatment 
discontinuation regarding emerging AE of perip heral neuropathy.   Text was updated 
to include both upper and lower limbs in neurological examinations (Section 8.2.3).   
In Appendix
 7, details of the structured brief interview and examination for peripheral 
neuropathy
 were updated to include upper extremity sensory and motor testing.  
• The r ando
mization ratio was updated from 3:1 to 1:1 (Sections  4.1, 6.3.1, and 9.2) , 
which will allow for a more robust comparison between balovaptan and placebo 
arms based on the data collected in the study . 
• Text was added describing the rationale for the target number of enrolled 
participants, which is based on drop- out rates seen in similar clinical studies 
(Section 9.2). 
• Language has been revised to include only one interim analysis instead of two.  The 
information will be  used for internal purposes and planning of future development of 
the compound ; sample size re- estimation may be performed (Section 9.5.1).  
Appendix 13:  Protocol Amendment History  
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  
216/Protocol BN43546, Version 3 • Language was updated to clarify that  electrocardiogram parameters will be provided 
as non- eCRF data (Section 8.2.4) .  
• Language has been clarified in Appendix 1, Section A1- 1 to indicate that any 
substantial amendments to the protocol will require IRB/EC and health authority 
approval (as locally required) before implementation of changes, with the exception 
of administr ative changes or changes necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard 
to study participants.  
• Due to administrative changes “serious adverse event reporting form” has been 
updated to “Clinical Trial Adverse Event/Special Situations Form” and “Clinical Trial Serious Adverse Event/Adverse Event of Special Interest Reporting Form” has been 
updated to “Clinical Trial Adverse Event/Special Situations Form” throughout the 
protocol.

comedogenic”.  
3 OBJECTIVE(S)  
The objective  of this protocol  is to  evaluate  the comedogenic  potential  of the test material(s)  using the 
back  of human  volunteers.  
[ADDRESS_667566] panel(s).  This human  
comedogenicity  test panel(s)  is being  conducted  in order  to assess  the comedogenic  potential  of the 
test material(s)  and determine  if the test material(s)  induce  microcomedones  under  repetitive  patch  
test conditions.  The target  population  for each  test panel  is adult  men  and women  (age  18 through  45 
years),  who  are acne -prone  and have  large  pores  on the back  and/or  a history  of acne  vulgaris  on the 
face  or back.  Subjects  will be patched  on the upper  back  with  test material  dosed  patches  and an 
undosed  occlusive  patch  (negative  control)  every  Monday,  Wednesday,  and Friday  for [ADDRESS_667567] material  and control  sites,  and graded  for 
microcomedones.

by [CONTACT_1034]):  
• Liquids  and fragrances  approximately  100 microliters  (µL) 
• Creams,  lotions,  petroleum,  etc. approximately  100 µL 
• Paper,  powder  or other solid materials  a sufficient  amount  to cover  the pad a rea 
 
Patches  will be applied  starting at the lower  edge  of the patch  and pressing  from below  to let air 
escape.  The patch  will be secured by  [CONTACT_515171]  (especially  the corners)  to ensure  good  
adherence.

documented in the appropriate  source  documents.  
 
9.2 STUDY  INSTRUMENT(S)  
Follicular Biopsies:  
Follicular  biopsies  will be collected  from  each  patch  site at Visit  [ADDRESS_667602].  The 
following  procedures  will be followed  for follicular biopsy  collection:  
• The test sites  will be gently  cleansed  with  warm  soapy,  water  and patted  dry. 
• A glass  slide  containing  a drop  of cyanoacrylate  glue  will be held  against  each  site until  it has 
dried.  
• The slide  will then  be removed  slowly,  so as to extract  follicles  and their  contents.  
• The specimen  slides  will be stored  in labeled  slide  boxes  until  graded.  
• The specimens  collected  using  the cyanoacrylate  follicular  biopsy  technique  will be evaluated  
by a trained   grader  using  a stereomicroscope  (magnification   ratio  of 0.8).  Hyperkeratotic  
follicles  (microcomedones)  will appear  as cylindrical  horny impactions  surrounding  extracted  
vellus  hairs.  
 
Specimens  will be graded  using  a 5-point  global  assessment  scale  as follows:  
0 None  (0%,  No microcomedones)  
0.5 Slight  (1-24%  Smallish  horny  masses)  
1 Mild  (25-49%  Smallish  horny  masses)  
2 Moderate  (50-74%  Moderately  sized horny  masses)  
3 Severe  (75-100%  Larger  globoid  microcomedones)  
 
The results  from  the microcomedone  grading  of the follicular  biopsies  will be recorded  using  the 
Stephens  Electronic  Data  Capture  (EDC)  system,  if available,  which  documents  the identity  of the 
evaluator/technician  as well as the time  and date  of all entries,  or all corrected  entries.  Subject  data  can 
also be provided  by [CONTACT_515177]’s  request.  Paper  grading forms  will be completed  if EDC is  
unavailable.  Any test site with  a NACDG  grading  score  of [ADDRESS_667603] COMPLETION/WITHDRAWAL

Skincare  Master  Protocol  Template  V2 OCT2015  – SOP-004747  19/[ADDRESS_667605]  Withdrawal  
When  an individual  who has signed  the ICD is not enrolled  in the study  or withdraws/is  withdrawn  
prior  to completing  the study,  the reason is to be documented  in the source  documents,  Screening  
and Enrollment log,  and in the final  study  report. Reasons  for subject  withdrawal  may  include:  
 
• Screen  Failure (e.g.  fails to meet  inclusion/exclusion criteria, chooses  not to enroll,  etc.)  
• Participant  is determined  to be ineligible  after  enrollment  
• Subject’s  choice  to withdraw  
• Investigator  terminated  (e.g.  noncompliance,  etc.)  
• Adverse  Event  / SAE (must  be reported  in accordance  with  the reporting  requirements  
defined  in the Adverse  Event  Reporting Section.  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Other  
 
 
Subjects  may  withdraw  from  the trial at any time  at their  request,  or they  may  be withdrawn  at any time  
at the discretion  of the Sponsor,  PI, or designee  for safety,  behavioral,  or administrative  reasons.  If a 
subject  does  not return  for a scheduled  visit,  [ADDRESS_667606]  withdrawal  
10 STATISTICAL  ANALYSIS  PLAN.  
The per-protocol  (PP) population  will be the primary  population for  comedogenicity  analyses.  The PP 
population  will include  all subjects  who received  treatment  and completed  the study  in general  
accordance  with  the protocol. Only  the data  of completing subjects  will be analyzed.  Subjects  may  be 
removed  from  the analysis  in the case  of an AE, SAE,  non-compliance,  or Investigator  discretion.  The 
reason for  any subjects  excluded  from  the analyses  will be documented in a note  to file and included  
in the study  report.  
 
Demographic  data  and baseline  characteristics  will be summarized  for all subjects  who are enrolled  in 
the study.  For continuous  variables,  descriptive  statistics  including number  of subjects  (N), mean,  
median,  standard deviation (SD),  minimum  (MIN)  and maximum  (MAX)  values  will be  presented.  For 
categorical  variables,  the frequency  and percentage  of each  category  will be provided.  
 
A descriptive  statistical  summary  will be provided  for the global  assessments  of microcomedone  data  
from  biopsies  for the test material and control  sites.  The descriptive  statistical  summary  includes  the 
number  of observations  (N), mean,  median , standard  deviation  (SD),  minimum (MIN),  and maximum  
Protocol  Title:  Human  Comedogenicity  Test 
Protocol  identification:  CO-[ADDRESS_667607] - date:  10FEB2017  Final  Version  (1) 
Skincare  Master  Protocol  Template  V2 OCT2015  – SOP-004747  20/33   
  
(MAX).  
 
In addition,  microcomedone  scores  will be analyzed  using  a mixed -effects  model,  where  the test 
Material/negative  control  is a fixed  effect  and the subject  is a random effect.  Each test product  will be 
compared to the negative  control  within  the model  frame.  A test material  will be considered  positive  
for comedogenicity  if it has a mean  microcomedone  value  of 1.0 or greater,  and is statistically  greater  
than  the mean  microcomedone  value  for the negative  control  site. 
 
All statistical  tests  will be 2-sided  at significance  level  alpha=0.05.  P-values  will be reported  to 3 
decimal  places  (0.000).  No multiple  testing  corrections  will be considered in the study.  Statistical  
analyses  are performed  using  SAS software  version 9.30  or later  series  (SAS  Statistical  Institute).  The 
results  will be sent to the Sponsor  along the raw data  in a Microsoft  Excel  document at the completion  
of the study.  
 
A test material  is considered negative  for comedogenicity  as long  as it satisfies  1 of the following  2 
conditions:  the microcomedone  mean  score  is less than 1.0 and/or  the mean score  is not greater  than  
the control  with  p-value  < 0.05.  
 
[ADDRESS_667608]  be approved  by [CONTACT_515178].  
Note  that submission  of administrative  change/non -substantial  amendments  to regulatory  authorities  
and/or  IRB/IECs  for approval  prior  to study  implementation  is determined  after  consultation  with  the 
local regulatory  representative  and/or  IRB/IEC  policy  and may  vary  by [CONTACT_1606]/region.  
The only  circumstance  in which  an amendment  may  be initiated  prior  to IRB approval  is where  the change  
is necessary  to eliminate  apparent  immediate  hazards  to the subjects.  In that event,  the PI [INVESTIGATOR_515145]  [ADDRESS_667609]  safety/well -being was affected,  the IRB/IEC,  if any, will also be  notified.  
The final  report  will describe  the deviation from  the protocol  and the circumstances  requiring it. 
 
 
11.3 ADVERSE  EVENT REPORTING  
11.3.1 Introduction  
Timely,  accurate,  and complete  reporting and analysis  of safety  information  from  clinical  studies  are 
crucial for the protection  of subjects,  investigators,  and the  Sponsor,  and are mandated by  [CONTACT_515179]:  Human  Comedogenicity  Test 
Protocol  identification:  CO-[ADDRESS_667610] - date:  10FEB2017  Final  Version  (1) 
Skincare  Master  Protocol  Template  V2 OCT2015  – SOP-004747  21/33  
  
agencies  worldwide. The  Sponsor  has established  procedures  in conformity with  regulatory  
requirements  to ensure  appropriate  reporting of safety  information.  
 
11.3.2 Definitions  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event  (AE)  
An AE is any untoward  medical  occurrence  in a clinical  study  subject  temporally  associated  with the 
clinical invest igation,  whether  or not the event  has a causal  relationship to  the subject’s  participation  
in the trial.  It is therefore  any unfavorable  and unintended  sign (including an abnormal  finding),  
symptom,  or disease  that occurs during the  trial. This  can include  any occurrence  that is new  in onset,  
an aggravation of severity/frequency  of a baseline  condition,  or abnormal  results  of diagnostic  
procedures,  including laboratory  test abnormalities.  
 
Examples  of AEs  include  but are not limited  to: 
Abnormal  test findings,  
Clinically  important  symptoms  and signs,  
Changes  in physical  examination findings,  
Hypersensitivity,  and 
Progression/worsening of underlying  disease.  
Any change  in existing  medical condition (Medical  History)  would be  considered  an AE and  recorde d 
appropriately.  
 
Additionally,  they  may  include  the signs  or symptoms  resulting from:  
Investigational  product  overdose,  
Investigational  product  withdrawal,  
Investigational  product  abuse,  
Investigational  product  misuse,  
Investigational  product  interactions,  
Medication  errors,  
Investigational  product  dependency,  
Exposure in utero , and 
Study  related  procedure.  
 
The criteria for  determining whether  an abnormal  objective  test finding should be  reported as an AE  
are as follows:  
Test  result is associated  with  accompanying symptoms,  and/or  
Test  result requires additional  diagnostic  testing  or medical/surgical intervention,  and/or  
Test  result leads to  a discontinuation from  the study,  significant  additional  concomitant  
treatment,  or other  therapy,  and/or  
Test  result is considered  to be an adverse  event by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_189349].  
 
Merely  repeating an abnormal  test,  in the  absence  of any of the above  conditions,  does  not constitute  
an AE. Any abnormal  test result that  is determined  to be  an error  does  not require  reporting as an  AE. 
 
Expected  AE 
All investigational  products  have the potential  to cause  some  uncomfortable  effects  or other  reactions.  
Signs  and symptoms  of erythema,  edema,  scaling/dryness,  itching,  burning,  stinging,  and tingling  are 
Protocol  Title:  Human  Comedogenicity  Test 
Protocol  identification:  CO-[ADDRESS_667611] - date:  10FEB2017  Final  Version  (1) 
Skincare  Master  Protocol  Template  V2 OCT2015  – SOP-004747  22/33  
  
considered  clinical  endpoints  if they  are mild  in nature  and should  not be reported  as AE. These  
conditions  may  or may  not resolve  over  time.  Symptoms  that are persistent  and moderate  to severe  in 
nature,  or that involve  elevation  (e.g.  edema,  papules,  vesicles,  spreading)  will be considered  adverse  
events  (AEs).  The Investigator  or designee  will have  the final  authorization  to determine  if a reaction  will 
be considered an AE.  
If a subject  is discontinued  due to worsening of a sign or symptom  (including worsening  of the signs  
and or symptoms  recorded  as part of the evaluations),  then  it should  be recorded  as an  AE. 
 
Treatment  Emergent  AE (TEAE)  
TEAE  is defined  as any event  not present  prior  to the initiation  of the IPs. Note  that AEs will be 
summarized  for all subjects  who signed  the ICD, differentiating TEAEs.  
AEs are considered  serious  and require  expedited reporting if they  meet  the definition  of a Serious  
Adverse Event  (see part below).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious  Adverse  Event  (SAE)  
An SAE is an  AE (untoward  medical  occurrence)  that fulfills  at least  one of the following  criteria:  
 
• results  in death;  
• is life-threatening (immediate  risk of death);  
• requires  inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_40088];  
• results  in a persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to 
conduct  normal  life functions;  
• is a suspected transmission  of any infectious  agent  via a medicinal  product  (medically  
significant)  and should be  reported  as an SAE in the  category  “Other  medically  important  
conditions ”; 
• results  in a congenital  anomaly/birth defect;  
• is another  medically  significant  event  (i.e. a medically  significant  condition that  may  jeopardize  
the subject  or require  medical  or surgical intervention  to prevent  any of the previously  listed  
outcomes).  Medical  and scientific  judgment should be  exercised  in deciding  whether  expedited  
reporting is appropriate  in situations  other  than those  listed  above.  Examples  of                    
such medical  events  include  allergic  bronchospasm requiring intensive  treatment  in an  
Emergency  Room or at  home,  blood dyscrasia,  or convulsions  that do not result  in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];  or development  of drug dependency  or drug abuse, or malignancy).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Severity  
The severity  of all AEs must  be evaluated  by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1660], if the PI [INVESTIGATOR_515146]  a medical  background,  by a 
medically  qualified  individual  (MD/DO).  The severity  classifications  are: 
• Severe  – Extreme  distress,  causing significant  impairment of functioning or incapacitation;  
interferes  significantly  with  subject's  usual  function;  prevents  normal  everyday  activities.  
• Moderate  – Sufficient  discomfort  is present  to cause  interference  to some  extent  with  
subject's  usual  function  or normal  everyday  activity.  
• Mild  – Awareness  of symptoms  that are easily  tolerated,  causing minimal  discomfort  and not  
interfering with  subject's  usual  function  or normal  everyday  activities.  
Protocol  Title:  Human  Comedogenicity  Test 
Protocol  identification:  CO-[ADDRESS_667612] - date:  10FEB2017  Final  Version  (1) 
Skincare  Master  Protocol  Template  V2 OCT2015  – SOP-004747  23/33  
  
Note  the distinction  between  the severity  and the seriousness  of an  AE. A severe  event  is not 
necessarily  a serious  event.  For example,  a headache  may  be severe  (interferes  significantly  with  
subject's  usual  function)  but would not  be classified  as serious  unless  it met one of the criteria for  
SAEs,  listed  above.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Causality  Assessment  
An AE (serious  or non-serious)  is consider ed “study -related” if the causality  assessment  is possible,  
probable,  or very  likely.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_1660], if the PI [INVESTIGATOR_515146]  a medical  background,  a medically  qualified  
individual  (MD/DO)  determines  the causality  by [CONTACT_266087]:  
 
• Not related – an AE that is not related  to the participation in the study.  
• Doubtful  – an AE for which  an alternate  explanation is more likely  (e.g.  concomitant  drug),  or 
the relationship in time  suggests  that a causal  relationship is unlikely.  
• Possible  – an AE that might  be a result  of participation  in the study.  An alternative  explanation  is 
inconclusive  and the relationship  in time  is reasonable  so a causal  relationship  cannot  be excluded.  
• Probable  – an AE that might  be a result  of participation in the study.  The relationship in time  is 
suggestive  (e.g.  confirmed  by [CONTACT_515180]).  An alternative  explanation is less likely.  
• Very  Likely  – an AE that is listed as a possible  adverse  reaction and cannot  be reasonably  
explained  by [CONTACT_515181].  The relationship in time  is very  suggestive  (e.g.  
confirmed  by [CONTACT_515182]).  
 
11.3.[ADDRESS_667613]’s  last study  procedure  or visit (or termination  if the subject  terminates  early  from  the study  for 
any reason).  
AEs that occur between  end of study  and 30 calendar  days  after  completion of the study  will only be 
reported  to the Sponsor  if they  are serious.   SAEs  are reportable  beyond  this period if the event  is 
considered  study -related.  The Sponsor  will evaluate  any safety  information that  is spontaneously  
reported  by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_515147].  
Subjects  are encouraged  to report  AEs spontaneously and in response  to questioning during the  visit 
(e.g.  if they  have  had any  side effects/issues  or changes  in their health). For  each  AE reported by [CONTACT_515183],  the study  team member  should notify  the PI, Study  Physician,  
or designee,  who will collect  information about  the event.  
All AEs, regardless  of seriousness,  severity,  or presumed  relationship to  study  procedures,  must  be 
recorded  using medical  terminology  on the Sponsor  provided  AE form  and then  entered  into the 
Electronic  Data  Capture  (EDC),  Medidata  Rave  AE Universal  Database.  These  events  must  then be 
entered  into the Medidata  Rave  AE Universal  Database  within  5 business  days  of the site’s  awareness.  
The DPR review  of AEs/SAEs  in Medidata  Rave  AE Universal Database  will be conducted within [ADDRESS_667614]  AE Universal  Database  in order  to escalate  any 
potential  safety  signal  to the Department Head.  
Whenever  possible,  diagnoses  should be  given  when  signs  and symptoms  are due to a common  
etiology  (e.g.,  cough,  runny  nose,  sneezing,  sore  throat,  and head  congestion should  be reported as 
“upper  respi[INVESTIGATOR_23739]”).  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_1660], if the PI [INVESTIGATOR_515146]  a medical  background,  a medically  
qualified individual  (MD/DO)  designee,  must  record or  confirm  their  opi[INVESTIGATOR_515148]:  Human  Comedogenicity  Test

Skincare  Master  Protocol  Template  V2 OCT2015  – SOP-004747  24/[ADDRESS_667616]  also report  AEs to the appropriate  IRB unless  otherwise  required and 
documented by [CONTACT_1201]. 
If a SAE occurs,  in addition  to the above  reporting procedures,  the Site will immediately  notify  the 
Study  Manager  and Study  Director  by [CONTACT_515184]  e-mail  (see Appendix  III for Contact  
[CONTACT_7171])  
 
Subsequent to a telephone  or encrypted  e-mail report  of an SAE,  a Clinical  Trial  SAE Report  Form  
(provided  to the study  site at the initiation  of the study)  must  be completed  by [CONTACT_515185]  (however  at a minimum,  the subject  identification number,   
name  [CONTACT_515196]  [if applicable],  SAE description,  investigator’s  assessment  of causality,  
and name  [CONTACT_515197]), signed  by [CONTACT_978] (or the medically  qualified  
designee),  and securely  transmitted  to the Study  Manager  and Study  Director  within 24  hours  of 
becoming aware  of the event.  
This timeframe  also applies  to additional  new  information (follow -up) on previously  forwarded SAE  
reports.  
In the rare event  that the Investigator’s  site does  not become  aware  of the occurrence  of a SAE 
immediately  (e.g.,  if an  outpatient  study  subject  initially  seeks  treatment  elsewhere),  the Investigator’s  
site is to report  the event  immediately  after  learning  of it as described  and document  the time  of the 
study  site’s  first awareness  of the SAE.  
 
The Study  Manager  or designee  will notify  the DPR within  [ADDRESS_667617]  more  information  as necessary.  The Study Manager  or designee  will send  an e-mail  
appropriate  document  to Sponsor’s  OCMS  group  per local  procedures  within  the following  timelines:

11.3.4 Monitoring  and Resolution  of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS] Non -Serious  AEs 
All study -related  AEs will be followed  until  resolution,  until  a stable  clinical  endpoint  is reached,  or at 
least  [ADDRESS_667620] -study  withdrawal/completion.  This information  will be captured in the source  
document and entered  into Medidata  Rave  AE Universal  Database.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious  AEs (SAEs)  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_1660], if the PI [INVESTIGATOR_515146] a medical background,  the medically  qualified designee  (MD/DO)  will 
monitor  SAEs  until  resolution or until  one of the conditions  in [IP_ADDRESS]  is met.  The information  will be 
captured in the  source  document and entered  into Medidata  Rave  AE Universal  Database.  The 
PI/designee  will also document  follow -up information on an updated  Clinical Trial  SAE form,  which  will 
be reviewed  by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_515150].  The Study  Manager  or designee  will forward  the document(s)  to the DPR and 
Study  Director  or designee,  and to OCMS  per local  procedures.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Resolution  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_515151]:  
Resolved;  
Not Resolved;  
Fatal;  
Resolved  with sequelae;  
Resolving;  
Unknown.  
 
Serious  AEs that have not  been resolved  by [CONTACT_2054],  or that have not  been resolved  upon  
discontinuation of the subject’s  participation in the  study,  must  be followed  until  any of the following  
occurs:  
the event  resolves  
the event  stabilizes  
the event  returns  to baseline,  if a baseline  value  is available  
the event  can be attributed  to factors  unrelated to study  conduct  
when  it becomes  unlikely  that any additional  information can be obtained  (subject  or 
healthcare  practitioner  refusal  to provide  additional  information,  lost to follow -up after  
demonstration  of due diligence  with follow -up efforts).  
 
11.3.5 Exposure In Utero  
For investigational  products  within clinical  studies,  an exposure  in utero  (EIU) occurs  if: 
• A woman is exposed  to the investigational  product  at any time  between her last menses  
prior  to conception  through the  delivery  of the baby.  
If any study  subject  becomes  or is found to  be pregnant  during the  study  subject’s  participation,  the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_515152] a Pregnancy  Notification Form  (to be provided  by [CONTACT_515186]).  Initial notification  via telephone  to the Sponsor’s  study  team  contact  [CONTACT_515187]’s  awareness  of the pregnancy.  The Pregnancy  
Notification Form  must  then  be sent  to the Sponsor  within 24 hours  of the site’s  awareness.  The

information  submitted should  include  the anticipated  date  of delivery  (see below  for information to  
document termination  of pregnancy).  
Follow -up is conducted  to obtain  pregnancy  outcome  information on all EIU reports.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_515153] (i.e.,  induced  abortion)  and then notify  
the Sponsor  of the outcome.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_515154] a follow -up to the  initial  Drug  
Exposure  During  Pregnancy  Collection Form  A and/or  End of Pregnancy  Collection Form  B (provided  by 
[CONTACT_515188]). The  reason(s)  for an induced  abortion should be  specified.  An EIU 
report  is not created  when  an ectopic pregnancy  report  is received  since  this pregnancy  is not usually  
viable. Rather,  a SAE case  is created  with  the event  of ectopic  pregnancy.  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_515155]  a SAE (i.e., spontaneous  abortion,  stillbirth,  neonatal  death,  or 
congenital  anomaly  [including that  in an aborted fetus,  stillbirth,  or neonatal  death]). In the case  of a 
live birth,  the “normality” of the newborn can be assessed  at the time  of birth  (i.e.,  no minimum  
follow -up period  of a presumably  normal  infant  is required before  an End of Pregnancy  Collection  
Form  B can  be completed).  The “normality” of an aborted fetus  can be assessed  by [CONTACT_515189],  unless  pre-abortion test  findings  are suggestive  of a congenital  anomaly.  
Additional  pregnancy  outcomes  that are classified  as SAEs  and should be  reported  as such  include:  
 
“Spontaneous  abortion” includes  miscarriage  and missed  abortion;  
All neonatal  deaths  that occur  within  [ADDRESS_667622]  to causality;  
Any infant  death  after  [ADDRESS_667623]/ INDEPENDENT ETHICS  COMMITTEE  
OR HEALTH  AUTHORITIES  
This study  (protocol,  ICD, recruiting material  [advertisements, phone  script,  etc.],  and all addenda)  will 
be reviewed  and approved  by [CONTACT_515190]/Independent Ethics  Committee  (IRB/IEC)  
contact[CONTACT_515191].  
Details  of the IRB/IEC  for this study  are in Appendix  I. 
It is the  responsibility  of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_515156],  protocol  amendments,  ICD(s),  
and other  relevant  documents,  e.g.,  advertisements,  if applicable  from  the IRB/IEC.  
The study  will not be activated,  subjects  will not be recruited, consented, or receive  test materials  
until  such time  as the IRB/IEC  as approved  the required documentation.  In addition,  the IRB/IEC  will 
review  the study  before  any significant  change  in the  protocol  is initiated. After  each  review,  the 
IRB/IEC’s  approval  letter  will be  forwarded  to the Sponsor.  
All correspondence  with  IRB/IEC  should be  retained  in the SMF. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_515157]/IEC  approvals  should be 
forwarded  to the Sponsor  and will  be filed  in the  TMF.

PRÉCIS 
Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an option to treat aortic valve stenosis or failure of a sur-
gically implanted tissue valve.  Sometimes  TAVR displaces the diseased aortic valve leaflets outwards, caus-
ing life -threatening obstruction of the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart. This is more com-
mon in surgically implanted tissue valves that are designed to achieve the largest aortic valve orifice area.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_522875], 
the mortality of TAVR -associated coronary artery obstruction remains prohibitively high.  
The investigators have developed and tested a technique to tear the existing aortic valve leaflet and enable 
TAVR in such patients . The procedure is called B ioprosthetic or native A ortic Scallop Intentional Laceration 
to prevent I atrogenic Coronary Artery obstruction (BASILICA).  
The purpose of this study is to perform BASILICA in patients who have no good options to prevent coronary  
artery obstruction during TAVR.

genic Coronary Artery obstruction (BASILICA) prospective investigation  
Précis:  Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an option to treat aortic 
valve stenosis or failure of a surgically implanted tissue valv e.  Sometimes 
TAVR displaces the diseased aortic valve leaflets outwards, causing life -
threatening obstruction of the coronary arteries that supply blood to the 
heart. This is more common in surgically implanted tissue valves that are de-
signed to achieve t he largest aortic valve orifice area.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_522877]-

BASILICA prospective investigation  Page 7 of 39 2018- 03-09 2.0 OBJECTIVE  
The objective of this protocol is further to characterize  the feasibility and safety of B ioprosthetic  or native  
Aortic Scallop Intentional Laceration to prevent I atrogenic Coronary Artery obstruction (BASILICA), in pa-
tients at high risk of coronary artery obstruction complicating TAVR.  
In this protocol, we use transcatheter heart valves  (THV)  according to their marketed indication , on-label.  
3.0 BACKGROUND  
Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an effective alternative to surgical aortic valve replace-
ment in intermediate and high -risk patients.  TAVR is also an effective treatment for failure of bioprosthetic 
surgical aortic valves, a treatment known as valve -in-valve TAVR. Valve- in-valve TAVR is associated with low 
mortality, satisfactory hemodynamics, and good intermediate -term f unc-
tional outcomes in selected high risk patients [ 1, 2].  Valve- in-valve TAVR 
commonly exacerbates valve under -sizing (a phenomenon known as pa-
tient -prosthetic mismatch), which increases one -year mortality [1, 2].   
Coronary artery obstruction is a devastating complication of valve -in-valve 
TAVR with a greater than 50% mortality [ 3].  Coronary artery obstruction 
occurs when the transcatheter heart valve displaces the underlying surgic al 
or native aortic valve leaflets outwards and obstructs the coronary artery 
ostia, usually by [CONTACT_522907] 
(Figure 1 ). Coronary artery obstruction occurs most commonly during TAVR 
for surgical bioprothesis designs intended to maximize effective aortic ori-
fice area (“stented” bioprostheses that have externally mounted leaflets, 
and “stentless” surgical biopro stheses). Coronary artery obstruction can be 
predicted by [CONTACT_094] -procedure morphology and CT.   
4.0 CLINICAL AND SCIENTIFIC JUSTIFICATION  
We propose a solution based on our non- clinical [5] and initial clinical [ 6] 
LAMPOON procedure (intentional catheter -based traversal and laceration 
a mitral valve leaflet structure in order to prevent the complications of 
leaflet displacement after related transcatheter mitral valve implantation).  
In LAM POON, we use catheter techniques to split the mitral valve leaflet to 
prevent obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract.

BASILICA prospective investigation  Page [ADDRESS_678527] developed a technique to split an aortic 
valve leaflet, whether bioprosthetic or native, to prevent coronary artery obstruction af ter TAVR.  The new 
technique is called Bioprosthetic Aortic Scallop Intentional Laceration to prevent Iatrogenic Coronary Artery 
obstruction (BASILICA).  Figure [ADDRESS_678528] powerful predictors is thought to be a 
small “virtual tube to coronary artery distance (VTC)”, especially when less than 3 -4mm [3, 7].  However, 
the risk determination must integrate all of these factors, and must incorporate judgement.

6.[ADDRESS_678531] a BASILICA traversal point, radiographic landmarks, and fluoroscopic projection angles.  
The procedure is performed under general anesthesia  or und er moderate sedation at the discretion of the 
institutional heart team .   The BASILICA  procedure has three steps: (1) leaflet traversal with a guidewire, 
followed by (2) leaflet laceration, immediately followed by (3) TAVR .  These are all guided by [CONTACT_522908].  
Research study participation is defined as beginning the moment BASILICA traversal is attempted.  
First catheter access is obtained typi[INVESTIGATOR_522880]  (two for BASILICA, one for he-
modynamics and angiography , and one for TAVR ) and at least one  venous introducer  sheaths for tempo-
rary transvenous pacing.  Anticoagulation  with heparin or equivalent achieve s an activated clotting time > 
300s .   
Hemodynamic and echocardiography measurements are recorded at baseline including gradients across 
the aortic valve, severity of valvular obstruction and  severity of valvular regurgitation.  
Two retrograde catheters are positioned, using a guidewire anchor as needed, in the LVOT and Aorta re-
spectively.  Care is taken to avoid entrapment of mitral valvular structures. A  snare catheter is positioned in 
the LVOT .  A coaxial traversal guiding catheter system (typi[INVESTIGATOR_522881]) directs electrosurgery 
devices (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a rigid 0.014” guidewire inside a polymer jacket wire convertor) against the base  of the 
coronary cusp targeted for laceration, using fluoroscopic and /or echocardiographic guidance.   
Traversal is accomplished by [CONTACT_522909] 0.014 ” guide-
wire to an electrosurgery pencil during short bursts of “pure, cutting” radiofrequency energy at approxi-
mately 30W.  The guidewire is repositioned as needed until it crosses the aortic  leaflet and is snare -re-
trieved  and externalized . Nonionic conduc tive flush (dextrose 5%) can be administered as needed via the 
guiding catheters to reduce guidewire char and thromboembolism.  
BASILICA prospective investigation  Page 11 of 39 2018- 03-09 Next the polymer jacket wire convertor is withdrawn, and the traversal wire is modified by [CONTACT_522910] 
(1) denuding a non- circumferential segment ~2mm in length, 90o arc and (2) kinking the denuded segment 
to enforce its position at the inner curvature of the intended guidewire lacerating surface.  Next the poly-
mer jacket radiopaque marker tip is locked adjacent to the kinked de nuded shaft segment.  Next the en-
snared guidewire is externalized to position the lacerating surface across the base of the leaflet.  
BASILICA may be performed on one or two valve leaflets that may threaten coronary artery obstruction.  
Next, at operator discretion, the transcatheter heart valve may be positioned before or after the laceration 
step.  If before, the operator assures no entrapment of the TAVR system with the laceration system of cath-
eters.  
At operator discretion, stroke pre vention strategies may be employed, including external carotid artery 
compression and intravascular embolic protection devices.  
Laceration is performed by [CONTACT_522911], and applying 
tension on both free  ends of the guidewire while simultaneously apply electrosurgery energy (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 
70W) in short bursts, until the laceration is complete and the guidewire is free.  
Hemodynamics are recorded quickly after laceration before TAVR .  Coronary artery stent syst ems are posi-
tioned prophylactically at the discretion of the operator.  Predilatation, including intentional disruption of 
the bioprosthetic valve frame, is performed at operator discretion , before or after TAVR . Then TAVR  is per-
formed using established te chniques  typi[INVESTIGATOR_522882].  The device size and inflation 
volumes are selected and applied at the discretion of the operator.  Post -dilatation is performed at opera-
tor discretion to achieve an optimum TAVR result.  Coronary artery patency is established using angi-
ography and, if employed, using prepositioned pressure -tip guidewires.  Coronary artery pressure ( instanta-
neous wave- free ratio, iFR ) may further be examined if possible at the discretion of the operator.  
Completion hemodyn amics and echocardiography are recorded.   Finally, percutaneous femoral artery and 
vein vascular hemostasis is obtained and the subject  convalesces in the appropriate inpatient recovery unit.  
Before discharge, follow -up transthoracic echocardiography is recorded.   A single contrast -enhanced CT of 
the heart is obtained before discharge if renal function allows, otherwise it is deferred as long as 30 -days. 
Blood tests are recorded for research only as obtained for medical care.  
Anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy is prescribed after discharge at the physicians’ discretion, and is 
recorded.  
All subjects are to be enrolled in the TVT -Registry postmarketing TAVR registry.

10.2 Study Analysis  
Clinical events are classified by [CONTACT_360954] [INVESTIGATOR_522884]-
tigator.   The results of the study will be released within 12 months of study completion.  
Primary and secondary a nalyses will be stratified acc ording to the setting for TAVR , whether native or bio-
prosthetic, and whether the bioprosthetic valve will intentionally be over -expanded to achieve a greater 
than nominal orifice area.  
The study will be analyzed using descriptive statistics, including a ca se-by-case narrative summary of major 
adverse events.  Kaplan -Meier estimates will be used to estimate the overall survival and the event -free 
survival Afterwards, we will survey for parameters associated with an increased risk of major adverse 
events  by e xploratory subgroup analysis and regression models . 
10.2.1  Primary  efficacy  endpoint  
The primary endpoint is Clinical  success (measured at exit from the catheterization laboratory).  All of the 
following must be present:  
BASILICA prospective investigation  Page 18 of 39 2018- 03-09 - Successful BASILICA  traversal and laceration  of the intended aortic leaflet; and  
- Absence of procedural mortality; and  
- Successful access, delivery, and retrieval of the BASILICA  device system; and  
- Successful TAVR  device implantation ; and  
- Absence of acute life -threatening ostial coronary artery obstruction (by  [CONTACT_522912],  
by [CONTACT_89320] , and by [CONTACT_522913] <0.89 if obtained ) 
- Freedom from emergency cardiac surgery or reintervention related to  the BASILICA TAVR proce-
dure, including attempted implantation of coronary artery stents to treat TAVR -induced coronary 
artery obstruction .   
Additional details about primary endpoint  
Valve post -dilatation is not considered  unplanned  re-intervention.  When pre- positioned coronary artery 
stents are not able to be retrieved, they may be i mplanted without impacting the primary endpoint.   
10.2.2  Primary safety endpoint  
The primary safety endpoint is freedom from major adverse clinical events (MACE) according to VARC -2 at 
30days.  
10.2.3  Secondary Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints include   
- Technical success, de fined as clinical success irrespective of coronary artery stenting  
- Clinical success without stroke , as determined by [CONTACT_522914]  
- Technical success of BASILICA only (delivery and removal of BASILICA catheter equipment, tra-
versal, and laceration of intended aortic leaflet)  
- Coronary artery  obstruction measured as instantaneous wave -free pressure ratio (iFR) or related 
measurements using a solid -state  pressure -transducer guidewire , if measured  
- Survival to discharge, to 30d, and to 12mo  
- Neurological eve nts as reported by [CONTACT_522915]  
- Access and vascular complications  
- Peri-procedural and spontaneous acute myocardial infarction  
- Pericardial effusion or tamponade  
- VARC -2 bleeding complications  
- AKIN acute kidney injury  
- Freedom from hemolytic anemia related to BASILICA TAVR  
- BASILICA Device or Procedure related technical failure: acute embolism, mitral valve injury, tra-
versal into left atrium, coronary artery injury induced by [CONTACT_522916], etc.

DSMB are unaffiliated to the study. Th e NHLBI DSMB will review the protocol  progress report  at six month 
intervals , or more frequently upon request of PI, IRB, and/or NHLBI Clinical Director . The DSMB may recom-
mend early termination of the study for considerations of safety and efficacy. Unanticipated Adverse De-
vice Effects (UADEs) will be submitted to the DSMB following the same timelines as the IRB (See section 
9.2.4 ). 
In the case of death or serious UADE, if the sponsor and the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_522887], the clinical trial will be terminated within [ADDRESS_678540]. [21 CFR 812.46]. All clinical  sites will be notified of this action.  
Each institutional IRB will review all Serious Adverse Events, Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects, and Un-
anticipated Problems, and may choose to suspend or terminate the protocol based on those findings. We 
believe this will protect subject safety.

BASILICA prospective investigation  Page 20 of 39 2018- 03-09 10.3.1  Anticipated mortality  
There are few data available to guide mortality assumptions. In an international registry of valve -in-valve 
TAVR, th e short -term (30 -day) mortality of coronary obstruction complicating TAVR was 50%, despi[INVESTIGATOR_522889]-
nary stenting {Ribeiro, 2017 #362183}. The long -term  mortality is expected to be larger. There is no registry 
of subjects not offered valve- in-valve TAVR because of threatened coronary obstruction.  
Absent data, we are forced to use judgement and experience to estimate clinically acceptable mortality for 
this group of patients with “no good options.”  We assume that intentional fracture of surgical biopros-
thetic va lve frames would confer incremental mortality, although there are no available data. To come to 
this determination, we polled our lead site investigators, who are selected for their high -volume experience 
and quality.  The best estimate of clinically -accep table 30 -day mortality was 15% for standalone BASILICA 
and 20% for BASILICA with valve fracture.  
10.3.2  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_522890] 30-days after the proc edure does not sub-
stantially exceed an anticipated rate. We anticipate the rate of 30 -day mortality is 15% or less and determine 
the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_106558] a Bayesian approach  [8]. The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_522891] 30 -day mortality rate exceeds 15 % is at least 90%.  We take our prior distribution to be a beta 
distribution so that our prior clinical opi[INVESTIGATOR_389628] 20% of the weight we will place on the new study data, 
which gives the prior parameters a = 0.9, b =5.1. Hence when we make decisions a bout stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10098], 
the data from the study will dominate over the prior opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649].  
The following table summarizes the threshold numbers for the stop rule boundary, which would lead to a 
recommendation to stop the study due to the excess 30 -day mortali ty.

with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of  subjects (21 CFR 812.3(s)).  
Unanticipated Problem ( UP): An unanticipated problem is any incident, experience, or outcome that meets 
ALL of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency in relation to:  
a. the research risks that are described in the IRB -approved research protocol and informed consent docu-
ment, Investigator’s Brochure or other study documents, and  
b. the characteristics of the subject population being studied, and

Non-Compliance  
Non-compliance is defined as failure to comply with applicable NIH Human Research Protections Program 
(HRPP) policies, IRB requirements, or regulatory requirements  for the protection of human research sub-
jects.  
Non-compliance may be further characterized as:  
1. Serious non -compliance: Non -compliance that:  
a. Increases risks, or causes harm, to participants.  
b. Decreases potential benefits to participants.  
c. Compromises the integrity of the NIH HRPP.

BASILICA prospective investigation  Page 25 of 39 2018- 03-09 11.2 Adverse event management:  
The following adverse event management guidelines are intended to ensure the safety of each subject  
while on the study.  Adverse events and adverse device effects will be attributed to study procedure and 
graded by [CONTACT_522920]:  
11.2.[ADDRESS_678543]’s condition. Not surpassing the expected standard medical inter-
vention.  
Moderate  Condition creates a level of discomfort that interferes with the subject’s usual 
activity or affects clinical status. May require medical intervention.  
Severe  Incapacitating and significantly affects the subject’s clinical status. Likely re-
quires medical intervention and prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
 
11.2.2  Attribution of adverse events to  the research protocol  
The relatedness of adverse events will be classified as:  
Classification  Description  
Definite  The event is clearly related to the research protocol . 
Probable  The event is likely related to the research protocol . The event has a reasonable 
temporal relationship to the  research device or research procedure and alter-
native causes , such as underlying disease, concomitant medications, or con-
comitant treatment -can be excluded.  
Possible  The event may be related to the research protocol . The event has a reasonable 
temporal relationship to the research device or research procedure, and at-
tribution of the event to the device or procedure cannot be excluded. How-
ever, alternative causes —such as underlying disease, concomitant medica-
tions, or concomitant treatments —are presumably responsible.  
Unlikely  It is doubtful the event is related to the research protocol . The event can rea-
sonably be explained b y other factures, including underlying disease, concomi-
tant medications, or concomitant treatments.  
Unrelated  The event is clearly not related to the research protocol . There either is no 
temporal association with the research device or procedure, or the  event is 
readily explained by [CONTACT_522921], including underlying disease, concomitant 
medications, or concomitant treatments.

13.1.1  Indications For Use  
The Astato 0.014” guidewire is used for transcatheter electrosurgery in two steps in this procedure.  First it 
is used for leaflet traversal during electrification.   This procedure is similar to the use of the Astato XS20 
and an amputated Asahi Confienza Pro 12 in the transcaval IDE investigation recently published [10]. 
Second, the midshaft is focally denuded and electrified for the leaflet traversal step.   This is described in 
the pre -clinical [5] and early clinical [ 6] LAMPOON manuscript s. 
Neither of these procedures are addressed in the indications for use:  
BASILICA prospective investigation  Page 30 of 39 2018- 03-09 Asahi -Intec Astato XS 20:  This product is intended to facilitate the placement and exchange of diagnos-
tic and therapeutic devices during intravascular procedures. This device is intended for peripheral vas-
cular use only.  
13.1.2  In vitro testing  of bedside modification  
We performed a benc htop investigation of the tensile strength implications of intended (“conventional”) 
and unintended (“undesirable”) bedside modification of the Astato guidewire shaft.   Using the available 
testing equipment, the BASILICA modification of the Astato guidewi re left a fracture force exceeding 75N in 
all tests, compared with the ISO [ZIP_CODE]- 2014, part 8.6 limit (which is 5N) by [CONTACT_522926].  See Appendix B.  
We believe this demonstrates the safety of the guidewire modification when following the prescribed tech-
nique.  
14.0 INVESTIGATOR ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS  
14.1 Good Clinical Practice  
The study will be conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E6 
(Guideline for Good Clinical Practice), Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Parts 50 (Protection of 
Human Subjects), and 56 (Institutional Review Boards), and other  appropriate regulatory requirement(s). 
The Investigator will be thoroughly familiar with the BASILICA TAVR  technique as described in the prot ocol 
and the Investigation al plan . Essential clinical documents will be maintained to demonstrate the validity of 
the study and the integrity of the data collected. Regulatory files should be established at the beginning of 
the study, maintained for the duration of the study and re tained according to the appropriate regulations.  
14.2 IRB Submissions  
The IRB/IEC and other appropriate institutional regulatory bodies will review all appropriate study docu-
mentation in order to safeguard the rights, safety, and well -being of the subjects. The study will only be 
conducted at sites where IRB/IEC and other ap propriate institutional regulatory body approval have been 
obtained. The protocol, informed consent, safety updates, annual progress reports, and any revisions to 
these documents will be provided to the IRB/IEC and other appropriate institutional regulator y bodies by 
[CONTACT_737].  
14.[ADDRESS_678553] or 
his/her legal representative prior to study participation. The method of obtainin g and documenting the in-
formed consent and the contents of the consent will comply with ICH -GCP and all applicable regulatory re-
quirement(s).  
Subjects who are unable to provide consent may be enrolled, if allowed by [CONTACT_522927].  Consent for 
these s ubjects must be obtained from a legally authorized representative. The process for obtaining this 
consent must conform to local human subjects pro tection policies and to state laws.  
Waiver of consent is requested to collect de- identified clinical data into  a retrospective registry  arm of pa-
tients treated before IDE enrollment begins nationwide , on the grounds that the retrospective collection of 
de-identified clinical data imparts no increase over minimal risk and that informed consent is impractical in 
this population of extremely ill and elderly patients, many of whom have poor survival despi[INVESTIGATOR_522898], and 
many of whom have severe disability.  
BASILICA prospective investigation  Page [ADDRESS_678554] number. The Investigator will grant monitor(s) 
and auditor(s) from the Sponsor or its designee and regulatory authority ( ies) access to the subject’s origi-
nal medical records for v erification of data gathered on the CRFs and to audit the data collection process. 
The subject’s confidentiality will be maintained and will not be made publicly available to the extent per-
mitted by [CONTACT_4913].  
14.[ADDRESS_678555] the study in compliance with the protocol provided by [CONTACT_1034], and given 
approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1686]/IEC and other appropriate institutional regulatory bodies. Modifica-
tions to the protocol should not be made wit hout agreement of both the Investigator and the Sponsor. 
Changes to the protocol will require written IRB/IEC and other appropriate institutional regulatory body 
approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_51703], except when the modification is needed to eliminate 
an immediate hazard(s) to subjects. The IRB/IEC may provide, if applicable regulatory authority ( ies) permit, 
expedited review and approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_51704](s) in ongoing studies that have the ap-
proval /favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1100]/IEC and other appropriate institutional regulatory bodies. The Sponsor 
will submit all protocol modifications to the regulatory authority(ies) in accordance with the governing reg-
ulations.  
When immediate deviation from the protocol is required to elimi nate an immediate hazard(s) to subjects, 
the Investigator will contact [CONTACT_1034], if circumstances permit, to discuss the planned course of action. 
Any departures from the protocol must be fully documented in the CRF and source documentation.  
14.[ADDRESS_678556] Acce ss to Source Data  
Monitoring and auditing procedures developed by [CONTACT_73562], in order to comply with 
GCP guidelines.  
Regulatory authorities, the IRB/IEC and other appropriate institutional regulatory bodies, and/or the Spon-
sor may reques t access to all source documents, CRFs, and other study documentation for on- site audit or 
inspection. Direct access to these documents must be guaranteed by [CONTACT_737], who must provide 
support at all times for these activities.  
14.[ADDRESS_678557]. It is the Principal Investigator’s responsibility to ensure the 
accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data reported in the subject’s CRF. Source documentation 
supporting the CRF data should indicate the subject’s participation in the study and should document the 
dates and details of study procedures, AEs, and subject status.  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_438898], should complete the CRF screens as soon as possi-
ble after inform ation is collected, preferably on the same day that a study subject is seen for an examina-
tion, treatment, or any other study procedure  but no more than [ADDRESS_678558] sign and date the Investigator’s Statement at the end of the CRF to endorse 
the recorded data.  
BASILICA prospective investigation  Page [ADDRESS_678559] Retention  
The Investigator will maintain all study records according to ICH -GCP and applicable regulatory require-
ment(s). Records will be retained fo r at least [ADDRESS_678560] or according to ap-
plicable regulatory requirement(s). If the Investigator withdraws from the resp onsibility of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_1497], custody must be transferred to a person willing to accept the responsibility. The Sponsor 
must be notified in writing if a custodial change occurs.  
The Sponsor has full rights over any invention, discovery, or innov ation, patentable or not, that may occur 
when performing the study.  
14.9 Publication and Presentation of Study Findings and Use of Information  
It is anticipated that the results of this study will be presented at scientific meetings and/or published in a 
peer reviewed scientific or medical journal. A Publications Committee comprised of Investigators participat-
ing in the study and representatives from the Sponsor, as appropriate, will be formed to oversee the publi-
cation and presentation of the study results, which will reflect the experience of all participating clinical 
sites. No publication or disclosure of study results will be permitted except under the terms and conditions 
of a separate written agreement between Sponsor and the investigator and/or the inves tigator's institu-
tion.  
14.[ADDRESS_678561] of the study, including assurance that the study meets  the regulatory requirements of the appropriate 
regulatory bodies.  
15.2 General Duties  
The Sponsor's general duties consist of submitt ing the appropriate regulatory  applications , selecting inves-
tigators, obtaining their signed agreement, providing them with the information necessary to conduct the 
study, e nsuring proper clinical site monitoring , and ensuring  study subject  informed consent is obtained.    
15.[ADDRESS_678562] confidentiality is maintained. The site monitor will ensure that th e investiga-
tion is conducted according to protocol design and regulatory requirements by [CONTACT_54665] 
(letter, e- mail, telephone, and fax).  
15.4 Site Selection and Training  
The sponsor or its designee ( national co -principal investigator) will ensure appropriate training in the tech-
nique of caval -aortic access prior to enrollment at any participating institution.  
15.4.1  Site selection:  
Site selection will be based on  
1. Physician expression of interest and need to apply this treatment approach to patients at the site.  
2. Physician prior experience performing or proctoring [ADDRESS_678563] examinations that are satisfactory for consideration of BASILICA TAVR . 
5. Site investigators willing and able to comply with the requirements of this protocol.  
A waiver for criterion 2 is specifically applied to Site #1, which was the first to perform BASILICA TAVR in 
patients. To compensate for limited transcaval experience, every research BASILICA procedure will be proc-
tored by [CONTACT_522928].  
15.4.2  Site training:  
Site training will consist of  
• Principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or sponsor didactic training about the technique, preclinical, and clinical 
experience to date.  
• Proctored conduct of BASILICA TAVR  procedure s in patients  at the local si te, at the sole discretion 
of the Sponsor and/or Principal Investigator .   
• Completion of training, and suitability for independent BASILICA TAVR enrollment, will be certified 
by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_522899].

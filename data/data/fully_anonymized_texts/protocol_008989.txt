INTRODUCTION
4.1 Background
Arthritis is a clinical syndrome of joint pain accompanied by [CONTACT_197072]. Two common etiologies of arthritis are degeneration of the 
joint, osteoarthritis (OA), and inappropriate inflammatory response, rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
OA is characterized by [CONTACT_197073], remodeling of adjacent bone, and inflammation in the 
affected joint [1, 2]. RA is a progressive inflammatory disease that eventually causes systemic 
joint damage and disability [3]. Post-traumatic arthritis is a form of osteoarthritis following an 
injury to a joint. Inappropriate joint biomechanics due to deformities is the main risk factor for 
OA [4]. The joint biomechanics are directly affected by [CONTACT_197074] [5]. Varus deformity is an excessive inward angulation 
of the lower leg and results in a bowlegged appearance. It may cause an overloading and 
cartilage wear in the medial knee compartment, which could support a degeneration of the knee 
joint leading to OA [5]. 
As of 2010, there were approximately 250 million people globally with osteoarthritis of the knee 
joint (3.6% of the global population) [6]. The prevalence was higher in females than in males 
[6]. Initial treatment of arthritis may include physical therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and corticosteroids which can be taken orally or by [CONTACT_17838]. 
Avascular necrosis (AVN) has several etiologies but fundamentally results from a decrease in 
blood flow to the affected bone, leading to cellular death [7]. Studies have reported a 3.4% and 
9.4% incidence of spontaneous osteonecrosis in persons older than 50 and 65 years of age, 
respectively [8]. Initial treatment of AVN may include medication, stretching, not walking on the 
affected leg. 
Complex epi[INVESTIGATOR_197037]. The management of these fractures especially in elderly patients is challenging [9].
When the damage to the joint is advanced or available conservative treatment options are 
exhausted, knee arthroplasty is considered the most effective treatment for patients with any of 
these indications.
Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a highly successful and frequently performed surgical treatment 
to reduce disability caused by [CONTACT_124702]-stage osteoarthritis and other conditions affecting articular 
cartilage [10, 11]. Technical outcomes for TKA are excellent, with favorable postoperative 
health-related quality of life [12]. Also, survivorship of primary knee replacements is excellent 
with reported survivorship of 82.3% at 25 years [13]. TKA has traditionally been indicated in the 
elderly population with relatively sedentary lifestyles, but more active, younger patients (<55) 
are receiving TKA due to the desire for a pain-free, active lifestyle with the demand projected to 
continue to increase for this group. A recent systematic review has shown that functional 
outcomes are similar in this population compared to elderly patients with no increase in the 
burden of revision [14].
 
Clinical Protocol  Study Number: CORI.2019.07  
A Prospective, Multi -center, Study to Evaluate the Safety and 
knee arthroplasty ([LOCATION_006]A) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) 
procedures   Version:  6.0, 15/Jan/2024 
Page: 17 of 122 
 
Unicondylar knee arthroplasty ([LOCATION_006]A) is another conservative surgical treatment for patients with 
OA or AVN that only affects a single compartment of the knee [15, 16]. In 2018, 11% of all 
knee arthroplasties in the [LOCATION_008] were compartmental knee arthroplasties ([LOCATION_006]A) [17]. 
In the [LOCATION_002], it is estimated that 600,000 primary TKAs and 45,000 primary [LOCATION_006]As are 
performed each year, and the amount of procedures is expected to annually increase by 10% 
[18, 19]. The escalating prevalence of end-stage OA places an increased burden on healthcare 
providers, especially on less experienced surgeons and facilities that perform low numbers of 
arthroplasties [20, 21]. Lower volume hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] (<25 procedures/year) report higher revision 
rates and more complications by 5 to 8 years compared to high volume hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] (>200 
procedures/years) [21, 22]. Therefore, technology or techniques that could improve outcomes 
and reduce the risk of revision are becoming increasingly important.  
Surgical factors that must be considered in knee arthroplasty include lower leg alignment, soft 
tissue balancing, maintenance of the joint line, and component size and fixation [23]. 
Malalignment of components in any anatomical plane can cause major complications including 
aseptic loosening, instability, poor function, polyethylene wear, and pain [23-25]. Additionally, 
implant malposition and malalignment of the joint can result in failure of the prosthesis [26]. 
When not aligned wit
outcomes, decreased implant survivorship, increased wear, and early failure from component 
loosening may occur [27].  
Evidence has shown that neutral mechanical alignment provides optimal outcomes in knee 
arthroplasty, which is achieved with conventional alignment guides in approximately 75% of TKA 
cases [28].  
For partial knee procedures, approximately 30-60% of [LOCATION_006]As have been reported to be 
malaligned using conventional manual instruments [29]. The importance of alignment can be 
demonstrated by [CONTACT_197075] [29, 30] while roughly 25% of TKAs have been revised for 
instability or malalignment [31]. 
As an alternative to mechanical alignment, kinematic alignment technique for knee arthroplasty 
aims to restore the individual knee anatomy and ligament tension, to restore native knee 
kinematics [32]. Kinematic alignment restores the obliquity and level of the joint line 
anatomically so the femoral component is slightly more valgus (1° to 2°) and the tibial 
component is slightly more varus (1° to 2°) than mechanically aligned components. 
A significant innovation in knee arthroplasty has been the introduction of computer navigation 
and robotic-assisted surgery. One such technology is the CORI Robotics. This system is a semi-
autonomous image-free system. During the surgery, the surgeon maps the condylar landmarks 
and determines alignment indices to define the volume and orientation of bone to be removed. 
The tools to remove the bone and place the implants are controlled and manipulated by [CONTACT_197076] a 3-dimensional digital map of the surgical surface.  
Comparisons of robotic systems to conventional instruments have demonstrated that robotic 
platforms produce fewer positioning errors in both [LOCATION_006]A and TKA [33-35]. When used in medial

4.2.1 Demographic Information 
A total of 414 joints were reported in the reviewed literature. Herry et al.[43] and Canetti et 
al.[41] likely shared the same patient population as Batailler et al.[39] Therefore, these joints 
were not included in the total, but these publications were not excluded due to different 
outcomes being reported among the studies. The Robotic Knee Surgical Systems are used 
intraoperatively to assist with implantation of knee prostheses, and studies report on a 
combination of intraoperative alignment parameters, clinical outcomes, and safety information. 
Three (3) studies provided early postoperative follow-up between the perioperative period and 
one year post-operative time point. Four (4) additional studies reported follow-up of one year or 
longer, two of which reported outcomes after [ADDRESS_233842] evenly distributed, as men comprised 49% of the total population from all 7 
publications. The age of patients undergoing [LOCATION_006]A with the Robotic Knee Surgical Systems 
ranged from 45 to 92 years with an average age of 66.8 years for the total patient population 
from all 7 publications.  
4.2.2 Clinical Outcome 
Outcome measures were evaluated in three publications with Knee Society Score (KSS), 
satisfaction rate, return to sport, Lysholm scale, Forgotten Joint score (FJS), University of 
[LOCATION_004], Los Angeles (UCLA) activity scale, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score 
(KOOS) and Knee Society Function Score (KSFS) being reported.

Page: [ADDRESS_233843] commonly employed outcome measures, being 
reported by [CONTACT_197077].[39] and Canetti et al.[41].These studies reported KSS and KSFS 
scores ranging from 92.6 to 96.4 and 90 to 97.2, respectively, indicating excellent functional 
outcomes. Satisfaction was scored on a scale from 1-5 with values corresponding with feeling 
disappointed to very satisfied. The percentages reported are the number of patients that 
indicated they were very satisfied with their procedure; this does not include patients that 
indicated they were just satisfied. Other outcome scores were reported in a single study, and 
none of these outcomes evidenced reduced function.  
Surgical System to patients who were operated on using conventional instruments. For KSFS 
and satisfaction rate, no statistically significant differences were observed between the two 
groups. However, Canetti et al.[41] observed a statistically significant increase in KSS and 
quick
observed in the larger cohort of Batailler et al.[39], the observed difference may be due to the 
smaller sample size. The percentage of patients returning to sports, UCLA, Lysholm scale, and 
FJS were not statistically significant between the two cohorts.  
Overall, patients undergoing knee procedures with the Robotic Knee Surgical Systems showed 
improved KSS, KSFS, KOOS, and UCLA scores compared to pre-operative values. 
4.2.[ADDRESS_233844] provided accuracy 
measurements for the Robotic Knee Surgical Systems themselves and compared to conventional 
instruments. Three (3) publications investigated alignment accuracy in various planes, the 
incidence of outliers, and restitution of the joint line [39, 42, 43]. 
The reviewed publications indicate that the Robotic Knee Surgical Systems can produce the 
desired mechanical axis, hip knee ankle angle, coronal femoral angle, coronal tibial angle, tibial 
slope, and joint line deviation in the majority of cases. Outliers were reported for most of the 
angular alignment parameters, and only one study indicated a rate higher than 15% [39]. This 
increased outlier rate is likely due to the decreased tolerance imposed by [CONTACT_197078] 2° of the desired value compared to the standard 3°.

the hip knee ankle angle or tibial slope for medial or lateral [LOCATION_006]As. However, there were

4.2.4 Adverse Events & Complications 
Complications related to the surgery, revision of the implant, and general complications were 
reported in the 7 included publications. Overall, the revision rate for prostheses implanted using 
the Robotic Knee Surgical Systems was 1.2% (5/414 procedures). Revisions were due to aseptic 
loosening without implant malpositioning (3, 0.7%) and unexplained pain (2, 0.5%). Additional 
reoperations included three (3) arthroscopic partial lateral meniscectomies, two (2) arthroscopic 
arthrolyses, and one (1) arthrotomy and lavage. Batailler et al.[39] noted that complications 
that affect robotic-assisted techniques (e.g. pin-site infections, broken pi[INVESTIGATOR_2115], or fractures at the 
pin site) did not occur in their cohort.

regulatory approval by [CONTACT_21495] (NMPA) in China.
Study hypotheses are that the CORI surgical system will achieve post-operative leg alignment 
(± 3°), and an improvement in patient-reported outcome measures.  This primary endpoint is 
aligned to the primary study objective of evaluating the CORI surgical system for [LOCATION_006]A and TKA 
procedures in achieving post-operative leg alignment.  Accuracy and alignment are two key 
variables in successful [LOCATION_006]A and TKA procedures. These measures have been previously 
evaluated with the predicate NAVIO surgical system. The primary endpoint will support the 
continued evaluation of these variables for the CORI surgical system.

patients contraindicated for knee replacement. 
4.4.4 Warnings and Precautions 
Knee Arthroplasty) states the following warnings and cautions: 
CORI Robotics is a surgical tool designed to provide assistance to the surgeon; it is not a 
planning and the conduct of the surgery during which CORI Robotics is being used. 
CORI Robotics and accessories should be used only by, or under the supervision of, a 
qualified surgeon or qualified member of his or her staff who is familiar with this 
document and has received training from Smith & Nephew. 
Use of equipment not specifically designated in this manual as compatible with CORI 
Robotics may result in the system not functioning properly, leading to patient or user 
injury. 
Refer servicing only to trained service personnel. Equipment damage, personal injury, or 
death may result if CORI Robotics is not serviced properly. 
To avoid risk of electrical shock, only connect the CORI Robotics Cart to a supply main 
with protective earth. 
Modification of CORI Robotics can cause the system to malfunction and could result in 
user and/or patient injury. 
Connecting electrical equipment to the multiple socket output effectively leads to creating 
a Medical Equipment System, and could result in a reduced level of safety. 
The transformer outlet is only to be used for CORI Robotics components. Do not connect 
any other device or improper extension cord to the transformer (max. load 600 VA) 
outlet. Failure to comply with this warning may result in shock hazard or product damage.
Additional equipment connected to medical electrical equipment must comply with the 
respective IEC or ISO standards. All configurations shall comply with the requirements for 
medical electrical systems (see IEC [ZIP_CODE]-1). Anyone connecting additional equipment to 
medical electrical equipment configures a medical system and is therefore responsible 
that the system complies with the requirements for medical electrical systems. Attention 
is drawn to the fact that local laws take priority over the above mentioned requirements. 
If in doubt, contact a qualified Biomedical technician or your local Smith & Nephew 
representative.

4.4.6 Anticipated Risks / Adverse Effects 
As with any surgical procedure, there is risk involved. Potential complications accompanying 
surgery may occur, including allergic reaction (anaphylactic and minor), infection, mild to 
serious physical injury, localized static shock, delay in the operation, surgical site nerve injury, 
vascular injuries of the lower extremity, soft tissue damage, major bone gouging at the surgical 
site, bone fracture, immature implant failure, unstable knee joint, limited or restricted knee 
range of motion, major blunt impact injury, unintended laceration/puncture wound, and 
osteonecrosis.  
As this is a post-market study and the device is used according to the IFU, the use of CORI 
Robotics in this study introduces no additional potential risks to the study participant.
4.4.7 Safety Data Collection 
All adverse device effects or device deficiencies will be categorised and reported as instructed in 
Section 12, Adverse Events and Device Deficiencies. During causality assessment activity 
(assessment of Related vs Unrelated) and expectancy assessment (assessment of Unanticipated 
vs Anticipated) clinical judgement shall be used and relevant documents, such as the IFU shall 
be consulted, as foreseeable serious adverse events and the potential risks are summarized 
there. The presence of confounding factors, such as concomitant medication/treatment, the 
natural history of the underlying disease, other concurrent illness or risk factors shall also be 
considered.

The CORI Robotics is comprised of a console control unit, optical tracking camera, primary and 
secondary input displays (tablet and optional display monitor), instrument trays and foot pedal 
(Figure 6-1). The CORI Robotics software consists of a patient and user management module, a 
surgical planner, and an intra-operative cutting module. The system uses the tracked position of 
the surgical bur to control its cutting engagement to the bone that is intended to be removed. 
The CORI Robotics incorporates a detailed user interface that provides procedure setup, tracking 
status, visual indicators, and real-time cutting progress during the procedure. The system uses 
the tracked position of the surgical bur to control its cutting engagement to the bone that is 
target surface of the bone. The CORI Robotics software controls the cutting engagement of the 
surgical bur based on its proximity to the planned target surface. The cutting control is achieved 
with two modes:  
Exposure control adjusts the bur's exposure with respect to a guard. If the surgeon 
encroaches on a portion of bone that is not to be cut, the CORI Robotics retracts the bur 
inside the guard, disabling cutting. 
Speed control regulates the signal going to the drill motor controller itself and limits the 
speed of the drill if the target surface is approached. This mode of operation is useful in 
shapi[INVESTIGATOR_197038].

written evidence of training and expertise in the study procedure. If deemed necessary, pre-
study cases shall be performed until the surgeon feels comfortable with the system in order to 
prevent any learning curve during the study. The number of pre-study cases depends on the 
level of the individual experience of the surgeon. Anonymized CORI Robotics Case Reports will 
be collected for these pre-study cases as proof of experience. If no pre-study cases are 
completed the case log of the first study case will be collected and analysed as soon as possible 
following the surgery to ensure the additional data required for the study has been collected.

sis was estimated to be 92.1%
(54). If this assumption holds for this study, then the enrollment of 36 knees for each of the two 
planned study groups (i.e. the CORI Robotics [LOCATION_006]A and CORI Robotics TKA) for a total of 72
knees will individually provide approximately 80% power to show that the lower limit of the two-
sided 95% confidence interval for the proportion of mechanically aligned TKAs is greater than 
that obtained from literature. To account for up to a 10% attrition rate in knees enrolled, 40 
knees in each group (80 knees combined, 40 [LOCATION_006]A and 40 TKA) will be enrolled in the study.
8.2 Data Management

variables will be summarized with frequencies and percentages. Continuous variables will be 
summarized with the following summary statistics: the number of observations, mean, median, 
standard deviation, minimum and maximum values.  
All statistical comparisons of data would describe the test statistic used as well as its distributional 
assumptions. For continuous variables, in an event of marked deviation from normality assumption, 
a commensurate non-parametric test would be used as an alternative thereby [CONTACT_197095]. All analyses will be performed using SAS version 
9.3 (or a later version). 
 
10.2 Analysis Populations 
The following are the analysis populations: 
Safety Population (SAF): This is defined as all subjects who were treated for a [LOCATION_006]A or TKA 
with the use of the CORI Robotics and a Smith+Nephew Knee Implant System. 
Full analysis set population (FAS): The FAS is a subset of the subjects of the SAF population 
who have at least one post-operative assessment on any of the effectiveness endpoints or 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) endpoints.  
Per-Protocol Population (PP): The PP population is a subset of subjects in the FAS population 
who do not have major protocol deviations and who satisfied all enrollment eligibility criteria. 
Major protocol deviations will include but not only restricted to subjects enrolled who do not 
satisfy the study entry eligibility criteria. All other criteria that will be categorized as major 
deviations will be formally classified on a case-by-case basis prior to the final study database 
lock.  
10.3 Baseline Data 
All observations available prior to the operative date will be defined as baseline data. All 
demographic and pre-operative characteristics data will be summarized at baseline. All 
demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized using the SAF, FAS and PP analysis 
populations.

independent repeated measures Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) models (to account for the 
correlation between subjects with bilateral knees) will be used to model the KSS scores as the 
dependent variable. As a minimum, each model will contain a visit (pre-operative and 
postoperative) and the investigational site as a fixed term with a repeated specification for the 
knee.  Pre-operative prognostic and demographic variables not only restricted to age, BMI and sex, 
but that can also be ascertained to have an impact on the KSS scores will be introduced as 
covariates in the final model. These covariates will be added to the model using a stepwise 
approach and a covariate is retained -
Model based means (adjusted means or Least Square Means, LSMeans) and corresponding 
standard errors associated with each KSS score at the pre-operative visit and postoperative visits 
will be presented. Model based changes (and corresponding standard errors) from the pre-
operative visit to each subsequent postoperative as well as their corresponding 95% CIs will 
additionally be summarized. If the p-value associated with the visit term in the model is significant 
(i.e. p < 0.05), then the 95% CIs corresponding to the model based change (LS Mean) from the 
pre-operative to each postoperative visit will indicate where significant differences (changes) from 
the pre-operative at postoperative are found.

Leg alignment pre- and post-cementation will be summarized using descriptive summary 
characteristics for continuous variables. 
Robotics System Time & Cutting Time 
Robotic System and cutting times will be summarized using summary statistics for continuous 
variables. Standard Robotics System and cutting times will be obtained from literature and included 
in the SAP. The average operating (µ 11) and cutting times (µ 21) and their commensurate 95% CIs 
will be summarized compared to the obtained literature-specified (i.e. µ 10 and µ20 respectively) 
using the t-test.  
The following are the possible outcomes, where i=1 represents operating time and i=2 represents 
cutting time:  
If the lower limit (LL) of the 95% CI for µ i1 is > µ i0, then it is concluded that µ i1 is significantly 
greater than µ i0. 
If the upper limit (UL) of the 95% CI for µ i1 is > µ i0, then it is concluded that µ i1 is significantly less 
than µ i0. 
If (LL of 95% CI for µ i1 i0 i1), then it is concluded that µ i1 on-study is 
comparable to that specified in the literature (µ i0).  
All other endpoints will be summarized using the FAS analysis population.

Not applicable.
SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIFICATION
Parratte et al.[53] looked at the effects of postoperative mechanical axis alignment on the survival 
of TKAs. They found that of the 398 TKAs reviewed in the paper there were 292 (73.4%) which 
post-operatively were defined as mechanically aligned (i.e. with a mechanical axis of 0° ± 3°).
This study is designed to demonstrate superiority in the proportion of TKAs post-operatively 
defined as mechanically aligned against the reference proportion of 73.4% from above.

show that the lower limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the proportion of 
mechanically aligned TKAs is greater than that obtained from literature. To account for up to a 10% 
attrition rate in knees enrolled, 40 knees in each group (80 knees combined, 40 [LOCATION_006]A, 40 TKA) will 
be enrolled in the study.

12.1.1 Adverse Event
An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury or 
untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users or other persons, 
whether or not related to the investigational medical device and whether anticipated or 
unanticipated.  
Note 1: This definition includes events related to the investigational medical device or the 
comparator.

Note 2: This definition includes events related to the procedures involved.  
Note 3: For users or other persons, this definition is restricted to events related to the use of 
investigational medical devices or comparators. 
AE is used both to refer to AE which do not meet the definitions of Adverse Device Effects or 
Serious Adverse Events and as an umbrella term referring to adverse events of all classifications.  
An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (for example, an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease. For reporting purposes, emphasis is placed first and foremost on whether or 
not the event constitutes an untoward medical occurrence. 
12.1.[ADDRESS_233912] (ADE) is an adverse event related to the use of an investigational medical 
device.  
Note 1: This definition includes adverse events resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructions 
for use, deployment, implantation, installation or operation, or any malfunction of the 
investigational medical device.  
Note 2: This definition includes any event resulting from use error or from intentional misuse of the 
investigational medical device.  
Note 3: This includes "comparator" if the comparator is a medical device.  
Not Related  - An AE is considered to be not related to the use of an IP or the procedure when the 
effect is DEFINITELY UNRELATED to have any relationship to the use of the IP or the procedure. 
Related   An AE is considered to be related to the use of an IP or the procedure when there is a 
POSSIBLE, or DEFINITE relationship between the AE and the use of the IP or the procedure. 
An ADE is further categorized depending on whether the criteria in section 12.1.3 and 12.1.4 are 
met.

The bone break could be reduced (set) and immobilized during 
the same surgery during which it occurred if it is detected. If the 
fracture occurs after the surgery, additional medical attention 
would be required. Subsequent healing returns normal body 
function for the subject.

serious, if the subject's range of motion has been worsened 
compared to the range of motion prior to surgery, or it has been 
restored sub-optimally.

Main Low-
extremity vessels Damage to the vascular systems of the subject's leg. 
In severe cases, dis-vascularization occurs that is, the subject 
loses blood flow to the leg when a clot forms in significant 
arteries of the leg. Additional surgery would be required to 
correct blood flow. If blood flow to the leg is not restored, the 
patient's leg may need to be amputated. 
12.1.5 Severity 
The severity of every AE will be assessed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_125155]. AE should be 
classified as mild, moderate, or severe, regardless of whether or not the AE are considered to be 
serious or non-serious. The classification should be based on the following definitions: 
Mild -  An event is mild if the subject is aware of, but can easily tolerate the sign or symptom.
Moderate - An event is moderate if the sign or symptom results in discomfort significant enough 
activities. 
Severe -  
inability to work or engage in their usual activities. 
12.1.6 Device Deficiency 
A Device Deficiency (DD) is an inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, 
durability, reliability, safety, or performance.  
Note 1: DD includes malfunctions, use errors and inadequacy in the information supplied by [CONTACT_197102].  
Note 2: This definition includes device deficiencies related to the investigational medical device or 
the comparator. 
Device deficiencies that did not lead to an adverse event but could have led to a medical 
occurrence if 
a) suitable action had not been taken,  
b) intervention had not been made, or  
c) circumstances had been less fortunate,

APPENDICES
22.1 Protocol Amendment
22.1.1 Protocol Amendment 1
[IP_ADDRESS] General Purpose
This amendment has been completed to:
1) increase the pre-operative visit window from 28 days to 90 days and to allow pre-operative 
activities to occur on the day of surgery as long as they occur prior to the surgery itself.
2) allow the 6-month visit to be conducted remotely.
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale
1) Following the COVID pandemic and the cancellations of elective surgery the waiting lists for 
surgery have increased globally. Extending the visit window will aid sites in being able to 
include subjects whose surgery is longer than 28 days from their initial pre-operative visit
without having to schedule an additional pre-operative visit.
2) No x-rays are taken at the 6-month visit so the subject does not need to come in to site. The 
PROMs collected at the visit can be sent to the subject who can complete them whilst on the 
phone to a member of the study team. The PROMs will then be securely sent back to site and 
entered into the EDC. The KSS would not have the -generated) 
component of the questionnaire completed if the visit is remote. However, per the 2011 
Knee Society Knee Scoring System Licensed User Manual [55] outcomes are only scored 
using the patient report -
generated) component of the questionnaire is collected for background information and to 
facilitate comparison of patient outcome with the old KSCR.
[IP_ADDRESS] Effect on Study Status
1) The amendment will ensure more potential subjects can be included in the study and reflect 
the consequences of the COVID pandemic on the current routine clinical schedules. There is 
no impact on any subjects that are enrolled prior the amendment being effective as the 
amendment is lengthening rather than reducing the pre-operative visit window.
2) There will be no impact on any subjects reaching the 6-month visit prior to the amendment 
being effective because they will have the 6-month visit on site.
The database will be updated according to the new protocol once approved.

Study hypotheses are that the CORI 
surgical system will achieve post-
operative leg alignment (± 3°), and 
an improvement in patient-reported 
outcome measures.  This primary 
endpoint is aligned to the primary 
study objective of evaluating the 
CORI surgical system for [LOCATION_006]A and 
TKA procedures in achieving post-
operative leg alignment.  Accuracy 
and alignment are two key variables 
in successful [LOCATION_006]A and TKA 
procedures. These measures have 
been previously evaluated with the 
predicate NAVIO surgical system. The 
primary endpoint will support the 
continued evaluation of these 
variables for the CORI surgical 
system.

The study design meets the needs of 
the aforementioned regulatory 
requirements and has been powered 
based on recent analyses from the 
NAVIO Surgical System.  This study is 
designed to demonstrate superiority 
in the proportion of TKAs post-
operatively defined as mechanically 
aligned against the reference 
proportion of 73.4% (53).  The 
proportion of mechanically aligned 
System from a recent analysis was 
estimated to be 92.1% (54). If this 
assumption holds for this study, then 
the enrollment of 63 knees for each of 
the two planned study groups (i.e. the 
CORI Robotics [LOCATION_006]A and CORI Robotics 
TKA) for a total of 126 knees will 
individually provide 80% power to 
show that the lower limit of the two-
sided 95% confidence interval for the 
proportion of mechanically aligned 
TKAs is greater than that obtained 
from literature. To account for up to a 
10% attrition rate in knees enrolled,

22.1 Protocol 
Amendment 1  N/A 22.1.1 General Purpose  
This amendment has been completed 
to: 
1) increase the pre-operative visit 
window from 28 days to 90 days and 
to allow pre-operative activities to 
occur on the day of surgery as long as 
they occur prior to the surgery itself. 
2) allow the 6-month visit to be 
conducted remotely. 
 
22.1.2 Rationale 
1) Following the COVID pandemic and 
the cancellations of elective surgery 
the waiting lists for surgery have 
increased globally. Extending the visit 
window will aid sites in being able to 
include subjects whose surgery is 
longer than 28 days from their initial 
pre-operative visit without having to 
schedule an additional pre-operative 
visit. 
2) No x-rays are taken at the 6-
month visit so the subject does not 
need to come in to site. The PROMs 
collected at the visit can be sent to 
the subject who can complete them 
whilst on the phone to a member of 
the study team. The PROMs will then 
be securely sent back to site and 
entered into the EDC. The KSS would

22.1.[ADDRESS_233962] on Study Status 
1) The amendment will ensure more 
potential subjects can be included in 
the study and reflect the 
consequences of the COVID pandemic 
on the current routine clinical 
schedules. There is no impact on any 
subjects that are enrolled prior the 
amendment being effective as the 
amendment is lengthening rather 
than reducing the pre-operative visit 
window. 
2) There will be no impact on any 
subjects reaching the 6-month visit 
prior to the amendment being 
effective because they will have the 
6-month visit on site.  
The database will be updated 
according to the new protocol once 
approved.

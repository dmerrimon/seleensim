 SYNOPSIS 
Name [CONTACT_742042] n
sor/Company: Bausch + Lomb Incorporated  
Name [CONTACT_791]:   
Test: Bausch + Lomb kalifilcon A daily disposable contact [CONTACT_741956]:  Bausch + Lomb Biotrue ONE day daily disposable contact [CONTACT_741957]:  A Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of a kalifilcon A Contact 
[CONTACT_741958]:  Approximately 20 investigative sites, [LOCATION_002] only  
Primary Objective:  
The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a new silicone 
hydrogel daily disposable contact [CONTACT_13293], kalifilcon A compared to the Bausch + Lomb 
Biotrue ONE day® daily disposable contact [CONTACT_741959] a daily disposable wear basis.  
Methodology:  The study is evaluating the safety, efficacy and product performance of 
an investigational silicone hydrogen contact [CONTACT_13293]. Silicone hydrogel contact [CONTACT_741960]-silicone hydrogel soft 
contact [CONTACT_13276], promoting the level of health of the eye.  
 
Approximately 247 subjects (494 eyes) will be enrolled in this three-month, two arm, 
1:1, randomized, parallel, bilateral, single-masked study at approximately 20 
investigative sites in the [LOCATION_002].  In order to use this study for submission to the 
Japanese regulatory agency, a minimum of 20% of the randomized subjects will be of 
Japanese descent (i.e., both maternal and paternal grandparents born in Japan).   
 
Subjects will be assigned randomization numbers sequentially as they are enrolled and 
deemed eligible to participate.  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_9084] (Japanese, 
non-Japanese) and by [CONTACT_76537].  Japanese descent will be documented by 
[CONTACT_741961]’s source documents.  Lenses will be 
dispensed according to subject-specific randomization schedules provided to the 
unmasked designee at each site.  
Number of Subjects Planned:  Approximately 247 subjects (494 eyes), with a minimum 
of 20% of subjects being of Japanese descent (i.e., both maternal and paternal 
grandparents born in Japan).  
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: 
• Subjects must be [ADDRESS_1014322] capacity 
to provide voluntary informed consent.  
• Subjects must be myopic and require lens correction from -0.25 to -6.00 Diopter 
(D) with 0.25 D steps, in each eye. 
• Subjects must be correctable through spherocylindrical refraction and with soft 
spherical contact [CONTACT_265705] 40 letters (0.14 logarithm of the minimum angle of 
resolution [logMAR]) or better ([ADDRESS_1014323] chart) in each eye.  
• Subjects must be adapted soft contact [CONTACT_741962] [ADDRESS_1014324] 5 days per week on a daily disposable 
wear basis for approximately 3 months.  
Key Exclusion Criteria:  
• Subjects participating in any drug or device clinical investigation within 2 weeks 
prior to entry into this study (Screening/Dispensing Visit) and/or during the period 
of study participation.  
Study #890 - Protocol 
Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page 5 of 79 
  
 • Subjects who have worn gas permeable (GP) contact [CONTACT_367784] 30 days 
or who h a
ve worn polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) lenses within the last three 
months.  
• Subjects with an active ocular disease or who are using any ocular medication. 
• Subjects who currently wear monovision, multifocal, or toric contact [CONTACT_13276].  
• Subjects with an ocular astigmatism of greater than 1.00 D in either eye. 
• Subjects with anisometropia (spherical equivalent) of greater than 2.00 D. 
• Subjects who are amblyopic. 
• Subjects who have had any corneal surgery (e.g., refractive surgery).  
Investigational Product, Dosage and Mode of Administration: 
The investigator or designee will instruct all subjects to adhere to the Subject Instructions 
provided with their study contact [CONTACT_13276]. 
 
In order to ensure that the investigator and site staff remain masked to the study lens, an 
unmasked designee at each site will be responsible for all study lens accountability, 
including dispensation and collection of study supplies to subjects.  
 
Subjects are to be instructed not to discuss or show the dispensed study lenses to the 
Investigator or masked site staff during the study. 
 
Subjects will be instructed that other contact [CONTACT_13276] (other than the study lenses) and 
contact [CONTACT_741963] (other than the drops provided) are not allowed to be used 
during the study period.   
Study Duration of Treatment:  approximately 3 months  
Schedule of Visits:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Criteria for Evaluation: 
The primary endpoints are as follows: 
Effectiveness: 

Study #890 - Protocol 
Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page [ADDRESS_1014325] 
VA averaged
 over all scheduled visits. 
Safety: 
The primary safety endpoint will be any slit lamp finding greater than Grade 2 over the 
course o f the study.  
Statistical Methods: 
Continuous data will be summarized using descriptive statistics: sample size (n), mean, 
standard deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum. Categorical data will be 
presented using the total counts for each category and corresponding percentages. The 
denominator for each percentage will be the number of subjects or eyes with non-missing 
data at the given visit for each respective study treatment, unless otherwise indicated. 
 
Monocular distance high-contrast VA will be assessed while wearing the study lens at 
the Screening/Dispensing visit and all scheduled follow-up visits. For each eye visit, the 
number of letters read correctly will be recorded in the case report form. The number of 
letters read correctly will be converted to a logMAR value. For each eye, the average of 
the non-missing logMAR VA values at the scheduled visits (Screening/Dispensing and 
follow-up visits) will be computed. 
 
The average of the non-missing logMAR VA values at scheduled visits 
(screening/dispensing and all follow-up visits) will be summarized using continuous 
summary statistics for the PP Population in a table at the eye level. An analysis of 
variance model will be constructed using the PP Population with a response variable of 
average logMAR VA and fixed factors of treatment and site. The least squares mean and 
standard error will be displayed by [CONTACT_121610] a table. In addition, the least 
squares mean difference between treatment groups (test minus control) will be displayed. 
An upper one-sided 95% confidence limit for the difference between treatment groups 
will be presented. If the confidence limit is less than 0.06, then the null hypothesis that 
the Test lens is not non-inferior to the Control lens will be rejected, and the Test lens 
will be statistically successful in this outcome. 
 
At each follow-up visit, graded slit lamp findings will be assessed for each eye using 
Grades [ADDRESS_1014326] to findings greater than Grade 2 at 
any visit (Absent, Present). Missing data will not be imputed. Greater than Grade 2 
findings (Absent, Present) will be summarized at the eye level by [CONTACT_741964] a table. A one-sided upper 95% 
confidence limit around the difference in “Present” proportions between the test and 
control treatment groups will be constructed using the Newcombe-Wilson score method. 
If the upper confidence limit is less than 5%, then the null hypothesis that the Test lens 
is not non-inferior will be rejected, and the Test lens will be statistically successful in 
this outcome.  
Sample Size Calculations: 
Power and sample size calculations were performed using nQuery software version 7.0 
(Statistical Solutions Ltd). 
 
In a previous study of a similar lens (Bausch + Lomb Protocol 661), the standard 
deviation of the logMAR VA averaged over all follow-up visits was 0.076. When the 
sample size in each group  (test and control)  is 222 eyes, a two group one -sided 0.0 5 
Study #890 - Protocol 
Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page [ADDRESS_1014327] 99% power to reject the null hypothesis that the test 
lens is no
t non-inferior (the difference in means, −, is 0.06 or greater) in favor of 
the altern
ative hypothesis that the test lens is non-inferior, assuming that the expected 
difference in means is [ADDRESS_1014328] OF ABBREVIATION S .....................................................................................................................11

 1.0 INTRODUCTION  
Bausch +  
Lomb is evaluating the safety, efficacy, and product performance of an 
investigational silicone hydrogel contact [CONTACT_13293]. Silicone hydrogel contact [CONTACT_741965]-silicone hydrogel soft contact 
[CONTACT_13276], promoting the level of health of the eye.

day® daily disposable contact [CONTACT_741966] a 
daily disp o
sable wear basis. 
3.0 STUDY DESIGN 
3.1 Description of Study Design  
Approximately 247 subjects (494 eyes) will be enrolled in this three month, two arm, 1:1, 
randomized, parallel, bilateral, single-masked study at approximately 20 investigative sites 
in the [LOCATION_002] (US). In order to use this study for submission to the Japanese 
Regulatory Agency, a minimum of 20%1 of the randomized subjects will be of Japanese 
descent (i
.e., both maternal and paternal grandparents born in Japan). Subjects will be 
assigned randomization numbers sequentially as they are enrolled and deemed eligible to 
participate. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_9084] (Japanese, non-Japanese) and 
investigational site.  Japanese descent will be documented by a Family Tree Worksheet 
that is kept with the subject’s source documents.  Lenses will be dispensed according to 
subject-specific randomization schedules provided to the unmasked designee at each site.   
At the Screening/Dispensing Visit, approximately one-half of the subjects will be 
randomized to receive Bausch + Lomb investigational kalifilcon A daily disposable contact 
[CONTACT_13276] (Test), and approximately one-half of the subjects will be randomized to receive 
Bausch + Lomb Biotrue ONE day® daily disposable contact [CONTACT_13276] (Control). Both groups 
will wear the assigned lenses on a daily disposable wear basis. The lenses must be replaced 
with a new lens each day or whenever a lens is removed from the eye. 
3.[ADDRESS_1014338] (IRB) and Sponsor approval to conduct the study. The Sponsor and IRB must 
approve any advertising used to recruit subjects prior to use of that advertising. 
All consented subjects must be accounted for, whether they participate in the study or not. 
Bausch + Lomb will provide a Screening Log on which to enter information for each 
subject who signs an Informed Consent Form (ICF). Once a potential subject is consented 
and their initials are entered onto the Screening Log, the Investigator should proceed with 
screening procedures. 
Study #890 - Protocol 
Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page 13 of 79 
  
 Potential subjects are deemed either “Screen Pass” or “Screen Fail”.  “Screen Fail” subjects 
are those  
subjects who have not met the study inclusion criteria or have met the exclusion 
criteria. “Screen Fail” subjects cannot participate in the study. Electronic case report forms 
(eCRFs) must not be completed for “Screen Fail” subjects; however, the copy of their 
signed ICF and any information collected as part of screening (e.g., source documents, etc) 
must be kept in their permanent records. 
“Screen Pass” subjects are those subjects who have met all of the study inclusion criteria 
and have not met any of the exclusion criteria. Only “Screen Pass” subjects are eligible to 
participate in the study and can be assigned to a treatment using the randomization system. 
Once a subject is randomized (i.e., a treatment is assigned), a subject is considered active 
and must be accounted for at every visit until exited (completed or discontinued) from the 
study. Refer to Section 3.2.[ADDRESS_1014339] to follow-up.

4.7 Mas
king/Unmasking  
The Investigator/site staff and Bausch + Lomb personnel or designee(s) involved in the 
conduct of the study will be masked to the study lenses. Each site must have an unmasked 
designee that will be responsible for dispensing and collecting the study Test and Control 
lenses and accountability.  This designee shall not participate in study assessments that 
may cause bias to the study data.  
The randomization schedule will be created by [CONTACT_599836].  Personnel involved with repackaging and supply of clinical trial 
material will also be unmasked.  Field Clinical Research Associates (CRAs) will become 
unmasked during product reconciliation, at the conclusion of each site’s participation in 
the study and prior to locking the database.  Unmasked designees at the site will manage 
the dispensation and return of study lenses and related supplies. All other study personnel 
will remain masked until database lock.  

Study #890 - Protocol 
Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page [ADDRESS_1014357]’s randomly assigned treatment is required, the 
Investigat o
r (or other designee) is required to contact [CONTACT_1689] (or designee) to 
request permission to unmask.  The Medical Monitor (or designee) will contact [CONTACT_741972] (Dan Donatello, see Personnel and Facilities Page 3) and obtain approval to grant 
permission to unmask.  Upon receipt of authorization from the Sponsor designee, the 
Medical Monitor (or designee) will advise the Investigator (or other qualified designee) to 
log into the randomization system and unmask the subject.  If the Medical Monitor cannot 
be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], the Investigator (or other qualified designee) should then contact [CONTACT_741973] a subject.  In the event that the Medical 
Monitor or Sponsor designee cannot be contact[CONTACT_240367] (or other qualified 
designee) deems the unmasking emergent, the Investigator may log into the randomization 
system without authorization and unmask the subject. Whether unmasking occurs 
inadvertently or intentionally, the Investigator must notify the Medical Monitor or Sponsor 
designee as soon as possible after unmasking. In addition, the Investigator must record the 
date, time, and reason for unmasking the study treatment in the source documentation. 
Subjects will be instructed to insert the study lenses out of the sight of the Investigator or 
site staff other than the unmasked designee. Subjects are not to show the study blister packs 
and foils to the Investigator or site staff other than the unmasked designee unless instructed 
to do so.

4.9 Risk Assessment 
Info
rmation concerning potential risks associated with the investigational device (as well 
as possible interactions with concomitant medical treatments and risk-to-benefit ratio) can 
be found within the Report of Prior Investigations (ROPI) for the study.  Risks are also 
summarized within the Informed Consent document.  The assessments required for the 
study are routinely performed and are standard of care for contact [CONTACT_19554]. The 
subjects will be informed of any potential study specific risks in the ICF or if new risks 
become apparent during the study. 
5.[ADDRESS_1014359], the Investigator (or designee) will explain 
the purpose of the study, procedures, risks/benefits, and subject responsibilities to the 
potential subject. The subject’s willingness and ability to meet the follow-up requirements 
of the study will be determined. If the subject chooses to participate in the investigation, 

Study #890 - Protocol 
Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page [ADDRESS_1014360]’s records, 
and a copy should be provided to the subject.  In addition, the applicable privacy regulation 
requirements must be met. 
5.1.1 Screening/Dispensing Visit (Day 1) 
A Screening Log will be provided by [CONTACT_741974]. Once all available lines on the Screening Log 
have been completed, or the Investigator has fulfilled his/her quota of subjects, the 
Investigator will sign and date the form to verify that all the subjects who interviewed for 
the study have provided informed consent and Health Insurance Portability Accountability 
Act (HIPAA) authorization. 
After obtaining written informed consent, prospective subjects will be screened to 
determine whether they meet the entry criteria for the study.  
Screening/Dispensing will proceed as follows: 
a. Enter the subject information on the next available line of the Screening Log. 
b. Collect the subject’s demographics including collection of the Family Tree Worksheet 
for subjects of Japanese descent.

“Screen Fail” subjects are ineligible and cannot be randomized in the study.  The reason 
for screen failure must be documented on the Screening Log and in the subject’s source.  
The subject’s source is to be maintained with their ICF. 
Only “Screen Pass” subjects should be randomized in the study.  If the subject is a “Screen 
Pass”, perform the following: 
i. Collect Symptoms/Complaints Rating Scales (refer to Section 6.0 of Appendix B ) from 
the subject regarding their habitual lenses. 
j. Randomize the subject using Oracle Randomization System (ORS).  The unmasked 
designee ONLY must determine the subject’s randomized study lens assignment 
through ORS.  
The unmasked designee will then dispense lenses (in the subject’s randomized study 
lens assignment and appropriate sphere powere) to maintain a daily disposable 
modality until the 1-Week Follow-up Visit and record the dispensation in the Product 
Accountability Log.  
In an effort to ensure the Investigator remains masked, the unmasked designee MUST 
dispense the lens blister packs. 
k. Have the subject insert one pair of the study lenses in their eyes. In an effort to ensure 
the Investigator remains masked, the subject MUST insert the lenses out of the sight of 
the Investigator and other masked site personnel. 
l. Review Subject Instructions with the subject and provide the subject with a copy of the 
instructions.  Dispense lens cases.  Instruct the subject to place all worn lenses in a lens 
case (up to 10 pairs of lenses per case) with no solution (dry). The subject should return 
the lens cases to the site at the 1-Week Follow-Up Visit.  Remind the subject to use the 
white drawstring bag to bring all lenses (worn and unworn) to each visit. 
NOTE: Study lenses should be allowed to equilibrate a minimum of three minutes on the eye.  
m. Record the dispensed lens sphere power and after a minimum of three minutes of the 
subject w e
aring the lenses, perform the following assessments:

6.0 ADVERSE EVENTS 
6.1 Adverse Event Definitions 
For the purposes of this study, reportable AEs include ocular AEs and non-ocular serious 
adverse events (SAEs). All AEs will be classified first for seriousness and significance and 
then as to whether or not they are device related or non-device related and if device related, 
then, if it is an adverse device effect (ADE), an anticipated serious adverse device effect 
(ASADEs) or an unanticipated serious adverse device effect ([LOCATION_003]DEs). AEs, ADEs, 
ASADEs, [LOCATION_003]DEs, SAEs, Significant Non-Serious AEs and Non-Significant Non-
Serious AEs are defined as follows: 
6.1.1  Adverse Event (AE)  
Any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward clinical signs 
(including abnormal laboratory findings) in a subject, user, or other persons, whether or 
not related to the investigational medical device. This definition includes events not related 
to the investigational medical device, comparator, or the procedures involved. For users or 
other persons, this definition is restricted to events not related to investigational medical 
devices. 
Study #890 - Protocol 
Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page [ADDRESS_1014375]’s 
end of participation in the study must be reported. All reportable AEs must be followed 
until the event resolves or stabilizes. 
Applicable AEs (from slit lamp examination) should be photo documented and 
communicated to the Medical Monitor. 
6.1.[ADDRESS_1014376] (ADE) 
An ADE is an AE that is assessed to be related to the use of an investigational medical 
device. This definition includes AEs resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructions 
for use; deployment, implantation, installation, or operation; or any malfunction of the 
investigational medical device. This definition also includes any event resulting from use 
error or from intentional misuse of the investigational medical device. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Anticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect (ASADE) 
An ASADE is an ADE that first meets the serious criteria (see Section 6.1.3 ) or significant 
non-serious criteria (see Section 6.1.4 ) and which, by [CONTACT_5942], incidence, severity or 
outcome, has been previously identified in the investigational plan or application 
(including a supplementary plan or application) and/or in the risk analysis report. ASADEs 
include:   
• Corneal Ulcer (infectious or non-infectious) 
• Keratitis
 
• Sensitivity to light (photophobia) 
• Excessive eye secretions including mucopurulent discharge 
• Blurred vision, rainbows or halos around objects 
• Poor visual acuity (reduced sharpness of vision) 
• Moderate to severe eye pain not relieved by [CONTACT_288830] 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect ([LOCATION_003]DE) 
An [LOCATION_003]DE is an ADE that first meets the serious criteria (see Section 6.1.3 ) and has an 
effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated 
with, a device if that effect, problem or death was not previously identified in nature, 
severity or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a 
supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated 
with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects. 
6.1.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
An AE that: 
o Led to death; 
o Led to serious deterioration in the health of the subject, that resulted in: 
Study #890 - Protocol 
Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page 31 of 79 
  
 ‒ A life-threatening illness or injury; or 
‒ A permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function (e.g., 
blindness)
; or 
‒ Inpatient or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or 
‒ Medical or surgical intervention to prevent life-threatening illness or 
injury or pe
rmanent impairment to a body structure or a body function; 
o Led to fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality or birth defect. 
Note: A planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre-existing condition, or a procedure 
required by [CONTACT_760], without serious deterioration in health, is not considered 
an SAE. 
Serious adverse events are also those events that result in, or have potential to cause, either 
permanent impairment of an ocular function or damage to an ocular structure and may 
necessitate medical or surgical intervention. 
Serious adverse events may include any hazardous, sight-threatening conditions occurring 
after exposure to the test article, including the following: 
• A presumed infectious ulcer (defined as a progressive erosion of the corneal 
tissue). For the purposes of reporting, this includes: 
o Central or para-central location;  
o Penetration of Bowman’s membrane; 
o Infiltrate ≥ 2 mm diameter; 
o Associated  w
ith iritis;  
o Associated with any increase in intraocular pressure; 
o Culture positive for microorganisms; 
o Increasing size or severity at subsequent visits; 
NOTE: Signs of a presumed infectious corneal ulcer may include irregular focal 
infiltrates, active lesions with raised edges, significant diffuse infiltration, anterior 
corneal to mid-stromal involvement, erosion with overlying staining, conjunctival 
and lid edema, anterior chamber reaction (iritis), and severe bulbar and limbal 
redness. Symptoms associated with a presumed infectious ulcer (microbial 
keratitis) may include pain of rapid onset, severe redness, purulent or 
mucopurulent discharge, tearing, and photophobia.  
• Any central or paracentral (within 6 mm of cornea) corneal event that results in 
permanen t
 opacification (such as corneal scar or vascularization); 
• Any serious adverse ophthalmic events including hypopyon and/or hyphema; 
• Any neovascularization within the central 6 mm of the cornea;  
• Permanent loss of ≥ 2 lines/10 letters of BSCVA; 
• Loss of ≥  [ADDRESS_1014377] lens VA from baseline 
Study #890 - Protocol 
Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page 32 of 79 
  
 • All cases of iritis. 
6.1.4 Signif i
cant Non-Serious Adverse Events 
A significant non-serious adverse event is an AE that does not meet the serious criteria, is 
considered significant by [CONTACT_1034], and requires expedited reporting. These events 
include:  
• Peripheral non-progressive non-infectious corneal ulcers;  
• All symptomatic corneal infiltrative events;  
• All cases of corneal staining greater than or equal to Grade 3; 
• A temporary loss of two or more lines/10 or more letters of BSCVA (for greater 
than or equal to 2 weeks); 
• Neovascularization cases Grade 2 or greater; 
• Any ocular event that necessitates temporary lens discontinuation of greater than 
or equal to 2 weeks. 
6.1.5 Non-Significant Non-Serious Adverse Events 
A non-significant non-serious adverse event may include but are not limited to the 
following and does not require expedited reporting: 
• Bacterial Conjunctivitis; 
• Viral Conjunctivitis; 
• Allergic Conjunctivitis; 
• Corneal Edema; 
• Contact [CONTACT_240375][INVESTIGATOR_19534]; and, 
• Loss of Contrast Sensitivity 
6.[ADDRESS_1014378] of care. 
For purposes of this study, the Sponsor requests that cultures should be obtained in cases 
of corneal ulcer or suspected ocular infection, unless medically contraindicated. Cultures 
should be taken from the cul-de-sac, lower eyelid margin, and the corneal lesion (if 
applicable). The required culturing techniques are outlined in Appendix B . 
When a culture is obtained, the contact [CONTACT_599848]. 
Microbial data generated from returned subject supplies (e.g., lenses, lens cases) are for 
information only. Because microbes may be introduced into subject supplies during use, 
recovery of microbes from returned subject supplies cannot be presumed to indicate 
etiology or direction of organism transmission. 
Study #890 - Protocol 
Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page [ADDRESS_1014379] determine if the event is 
serious (refer to Section 6.1.3  for criteria) and/or significant (refer to Sections 6.1.4  and 
6.1.5 ) and then assess the severity of symptoms and the relationshi p of the event to the 
study device using the following guidelines: 
6.3.1 Severity 
• Mild:  Subject awareness of a sign or symptom that is easily tolerated, 
requires no treatment, and does not interfere with subject’s daily activities. 
• Moderate:  Subject awareness of a sign or symptom which may be a low 
level of concern to the subject and may interfere with daily activities but can 
be relieved by [CONTACT_119106]. 
• Severe:  A sign or symptom that interrupts the subject’s daily activity and 
requires systemic therapy or other treatment 
6.3.2 Relationship to Study Device and/or Rewetting Drops 
• Related: There is at least a reasonable possibility that the AE is related to 
the study device (contact [CONTACT_13293]) and/or rewetting drops. Reasonable 
possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship or 
association between the study device and/or rewetting drops and the AE. 
Also referred to as an ADE. 
• Not Related:  There is little or no reasonable possibility that the AE is 
related to the study device (contact [CONTACT_13293]) and/or rewetting drops. This 
assessment implies that the AE has no evidence to suggest either a causal 
relationship or association to the study device and/or Rewetting Drops and a 
more likely or certain alternative etiology exists. 
6.4 Procedures for Reporting SAEs and Significant Non-Serious Adverse Events 
An AE classified as a SAE or a Significant Non-Serious AE requires expeditious handling 
and reporting to the Sponsor to comply with regulatory requirements, as follows: 
• The event must be reported to the Medical Monitor (or designee) within 24 
hours of the Investigator’s awareness of the event via facsimile/email 
transmission on a paper SAE or Significant Non-Serious AE Report Form 
signed by [CONTACT_737]. 
Study #890 - Protocol 
Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page 34 of 79 
  
 Lexitas Medical Monitor (or designee) 
 
 
 
 
 
• The Me d
ical Monitor (or designee) will email a copy of the form (within 24 
hours) to  
 
.  
• Investigators should not wait to receive additional information to fully 
docu
ment the event before initially notifying the Medical Monitor (or 
designee) of an SAE or a Significant Non-Serious AE. Additional relevant 
information such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_741944] (or designee) as soon as they are available. 
• The Investigator should take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety of 
the subjects: notably, he/she should follow a subject with an SAE or 
Significant Non-Serious AE until the event has resolved or the condition has 
stabilized. This may imply that follow-up will continue after the subject has 
left the study, and that additional evaluations may be requested by [CONTACT_429]. 
• Ensure that the subject's identity is protected and the subject's identifiers in the 
clinical trial are properly mentioned on the form. 
• BEGIN TREATMENT OF THE AE IMMEDIATELY BY A SUITABLY 
LICENSED EYE CARE PROFESSIONAL. 
• Continue to update the paper SAE or Significant Non-Serious AE Report 
Form, if applicable, each time the subject is seen during the management of 
the event and at resolution of the event.  All updated report forms should be 
submitted to the Medical Monitor (or designee) who will distribute the reports 
as stated above. Whenever possible, it is suggested that the Investigator take 
photographs of all applicable AEs and forward them to the Medical Monitor 
(or designee). 
• Events requiring medical treatment will be evaluated by [CONTACT_1034]. Upon 
review of the medical treatment, Bausch + Lomb representatives may contact 
[CONTACT_741979]. 
• Report all [LOCATION_003]DEs to the reviewing IRB within 10 working days following 
awareness of the [LOCATION_003]DE or according to the established reporting procedures 
of the IRB, whichever is shorter. 
• Submit all bills, prescription receipts, and culture reports/fees related to the 
AE to the Bausch + Lomb.  Expense incurred for study related medical 
treatment will be paid by [CONTACT_59268] + Lomb.

 be made to obtain the health status of the mother and infant at term or fetus (in cases of 
miscarriag e
 or therapeutic abortion). Pregnancy itself is not considered an AE. 
All confirmed pregnancies must be reported on a paper Pregnancy Report Form and 
submitted to the Medical Monitor (or designee) via facsimile or email transmission within 
24 hours of the Investigator’s awareness of the pregnancy.  The Medical Monitor (or 
designee) will distribute the completed form to the Sponsor as per the distribution list in 
Section 6.4 . 
All pregnancies will be followed until outcome even after study closure.  The outcome of 
all pregnancies will be reported on a paper Pregnancy Outcome Report Form and submitted 
to the Medical Monitor (or designee) via facsimile or email transmission once the outcome 
is learned. The Medical Monitor (or designee) will distribute the completed form to the 
Sponsor as per the distribution list in Section 6.4 .  
Although pregnancy occurring in a clinical study is not considered to be an AE or SAE, 
any pregnancy complication, spontaneous abortion, or elective termination of a pregnancy, 
for medical reasons, will be recorded as an SAE. Any serious complication or event 
resulting from the pregnancy should be reported to the Medical Monitor (or designee)

7.1.2 Secondary Effectiveness Endpoints 
This study has no secondary effectiveness endpoints. 
7.1.3 Safety Endpoints 
The primary safety endpoint will be any slit lamp finding greater than Grade 2 over the 
course of the study.

7.2.1 Primary Effectiveness Endpoint 
The null hypothesis ( ) is that the difference in mean logMAR VA between the test group 
and the co
ntrol group ( −) is 0.06 or greater. The alternative hypothesis ( ) is that 
the differe
nce is less than 0.06. 
:−≥0.06

7.2.2 Primary S a
fety Endpoint 
The null hypothesis ( ) is that the difference in the proportion of eyes with any slit lamp 
finding gr
eater than Grade [ADDRESS_1014385] group and the control group ( −) is 0.05 
or more. The a
lternative hypothesis ( ) is that the difference is less than 0.05. 
:−≥0.05  
:−<0.05  
7.3 Sample Size
 
Power and sample size calculations were performed using nQuery software version 7.0 
(Statistical Solutions Ltd). 
The unit of analysis for the primary endpoints will be the eye. 
7.3.1 Primary Effectiveness Endpoint 
In a previous study of a similar lens (Bausch + Lomb Protocol 6612), the standard deviation 
of the logM A
R VA averaged over all study visits was 0.076.  
When the sample size in each group is [ADDRESS_1014386] 99% power to reject the null hypothesis that the test lens is not non-
inferior (the difference in means, −, is 0.06 or greater) in favor of the alternative 
hypothesis
 that the test lens is non-inferior, assuming that the expected difference in means 
is [ADDRESS_1014387] deviation is 0.076. 
7.3.2 Primary Safety Endpoint 
Over two previous studies of similar lenses (Bausch + Lomb Protocols 6612 and 6903), 
0.6% of eye
s had a slit lamp finding greater than Grade 2. An estimated proportion of 1% 
will be used to compute the sample size.  
With 222 eyes in each group, the upper limit of the observed one-sided 95% confidence 
interval will be expected to be less than 0.05 with 99% power when the Control proportion, 
, is 0.[ADDRESS_1014388] expected proportion, , is 0.01. These results are based on 
100,[ADDRESS_1014389] the 
confidence interval. (Newcombe RG (1988) Interval estimation for the difference between

 independent proportions: comparison of eleven methods. Statistics in Medicine 17:873-
890.) 
7.3.3 Over
all Power and Enrollment Targets 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Enrollment Target 
Every effort will be made to minimize losses to follow-up. Nevertheless, enrollment targets 
will be increased to allow completion of the expected sample sizes with losses of up to 
10%. 
The expected number of completed eyes is approximately 222 per treatment group. This 
corresponds to 111 subjects per treatment group. With two treatment arms, the target for 
completed subjects will be approximately 222 subjects. To allow for losses of up to 10%, 
approximately 222÷(1−0.1 )= 247 subjects will be enrolled. A minimum 20% of the 
enrolled sub
jects will be of Japanese descent. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Overall Power 
If the primary endpoints are not correlated with each other, then the power will be 
approximately 99% x 99% = 98%.  
7.4 Randomization 
Subjects will be randomly assigned to treatment groups in a one-to-one ratio. 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_9084] (Japanese, Non-Japanese) and by [CONTACT_3725]. 
7.5 Study Populations 
7.5.1 Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population 
The ITT Population will consist of all randomized subjects and both of their eyes, 
excluding any subjects who were ineligible based on Screening/Dispensing Visit 
assessments and randomized in error and not dispensed study lenses. Subjects will be 
included in ITT Population summaries according to the treatment group to which they were 
randomly assigned. 
7.5.2 Per Protocol (PP) Population 
The PP population will be the primary population used for analysis of the primary 
effectiveness endpoint.  The PP Population will consist of all ITT Population subjects 
without important (major) protocol deviations for subject level summaries and, for eye 
level summaries, both of their eyes. Important protocol deviation categories are defined in 
Section 7.6.[ADDRESS_1014390] receives more than one treatment and one of those treatments

7.6 Statistical Analysis 
7.6.1 Methods of Analysis 
[IP_ADDRESS]  General Methods 
Continuous data will be summarized using descriptive statistics: sample size (n), mean, 
standard deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum. Categorical data will be 
presented using the total counts for each category and corresponding percentages. The 
denominator for each percentage will be the number of subjects or eyes with non-missing 
data at the given visit for each respective study treatment, unless otherwise indicated. 
As is customary for contact [CONTACT_367813], eyes will be treated as independent sampling units 
in eye level analyses unless otherwise noted. 
Further details will be provided in a separate statistical analysis plan which will be 
completed and approved prior to unmasking of the treatment assignments. 
Data will be summarized for all subjects and, for a Japanese submission only, separately 
for the Japanese subjects.   Primary Effectiveness Endpoint Analysis 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Primary Effectiveness Endpoint Analysis 
Monocular distance high-contrast VA will be assessed while wearing the study lens at the 
Screening/Dispensing visit and all scheduled follow-up visits. For each eye visit, the 
number of letters read correctly will be recorded in the case report form. The number of 
letters read correctly will be converted to a logMAR value. For each eye, the average of 
the non-missing logMAR VA values at the scheduled visits (Screening/Dispensing and 
follow-up visits) will be computed. 
The average of the non-missing logMAR VA values at scheduled visits 
(screening/dispensing and all follow-up visits) will be summarized using continuous 
summary statistics for the PP Population in a table at the eye level. An analysis of variance 
model will be constructed using the PP Population with a response variable of average 
logMAR VA and fixed factors of treatment and site. The least squares mean and standard 
error will be displayed by [CONTACT_121610] a table. In addition, the least squares mean 
difference between treatment groups (test minus control) will be displayed. An upper one-
sided 95% confidence limit for the difference between treatment groups will be presented. 
If the confidence limit is less than 0.06, then the null hypothesis that the Test lens is not 
non-inferior to the Control lens will be rejected, and the Test lens will be statistically 
successful in this outcome. 
As a sensitivity analysis, the ITT population will be used to test the hypothesis. Summaries 
by [CONTACT_741980]. Missing data 
will be multiply imputed using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method.  
Study #890 - Protocol 
Date: 09Aug2019 Confidential Page 40 of 79 
  
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Primary Sa f ety Endpoint Analysis 
At each follow-up visit, graded slit lamp findings will be assessed for each eye using 
Grades [ADDRESS_1014392] to findings greater than Grade 2 at any 
visit (Absent, Present). Missing data will not be imputed. Greater than Grade 2 findings 
(Absent, Present) will be summarized at the eye level by [CONTACT_741981] a table. A one-sided upper 95% confidence limit 
around the difference in “Present” proportions between the test and control treatment 
groups will be constructed using the Newcombe-Wilson score method. If the upper 
confidence limit is less than 5%, then the null hypothesis that the Test lens is not non-
inferior will be rejected, and the Test lens will be statistically successful in this outcome. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of Statistical Success 
The test device will be statistically successful if it is successful in both primary endpoints.  
7.6.[ADDRESS_1014393] Discontinuation 
The reasons for study discontinuation will be summarized by [CONTACT_741982]. Details of discontinued eyes will be also listed by [CONTACT_3148]. 
7.6.4 Protocol Deviations 
Important (major) protocol deviations will be summarized by [CONTACT_741983] a table.  
Categories of important protocol deviations will include the following, which will be 
derived via data entered on the case report forms or in the randomization system. 
• Ineligibility 
• Not dispensed study treatment 
• Misrandomization 
• Dispensing of the incorrect lens (type or prescription) 
• Use of medications that could potentially affect the primary effectiveness 
endpoint 
Failure to comply with the procedures used to assess the primary effectiveness endpoint, 
such as missing a scheduled visit or failing to complete the procedure in accordance with 
instructionsAdditional important protocol deviation categories may be added prior to 
unmasking. 
Important (major) protocol deviations will also be displayed in a listing.

7.6.7 Missing Data 
Imputation of missing data is not conservative in a non-inferiority analysis setting. 
Therefore, primary effectiveness analyses will be completed using the PP Set without 
imputation of missing data. 
Sensitivity analyses of data from the ITT Set with missing data imputation are described 
in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . Unless otherwise specified in the protocol or statistical a n alysis plan, 
missing data will not be imputed.

statistical success. Therefore, no adjustments for multiple comparisons are needed.  
7.6.9 Interim Analyses 
No interim analyses are planned.

  APPENDIX B:  METHODS OF C LINICAL EVALUATION  
Maintenance and calibration of the equipment relevant to study assessments must be 
appropriately performed and documented by [CONTACT_3878], where applicable.  Any 
Any changes to the procedures described in this appendix will be provided under separate 
cover. 
1.0 Visual Acuity/Refraction 
It is essential that a standard procedure be used to obtain VA measurements. The VA and 
refraction measurements should be obtained by a physician, optometrist, or trained 
technician. One standard logMAR chart, high 90% contrast, with Sloan letters will be used 
to obtain the VA measurements in this study. The following VA equipment from Precision 
Vision, Inc. will be used in this study: 90% High Contrast 6.5 feet (2.0 meters) testing 
distance Translucent Chart (CAT. NO. 2103-2), and the Precision Vision Small Illuminator 
Cabinet (CAT. NO. 914). 
1.[ADDRESS_1014404]’s eyes to the logMAR 
chart is 6.5 feet (2.0 meters). The chart should be at eye level for the subject. The logMAR 
charts have two alternative letter sequences from 28 letters (0.3 logMAR) to  
62 letters (-0.3 logMAR). It is recommended that one letter sequence is used for the right 
eye, and the second letter sequence is used for the left eye, to minimize learning effects at 
each visit. Care should be taken to completely occlude the eye not being measured.  
Since the test distance of the chart is not at optical infinity, refractive power compensation 
is required to simulate optical infinity. The VA should be measured through the 
phoropter using the distance refractive correction with the addition of  
+0.[ADDRESS_1014405] distance of 6.5 feet (2.0 meters). 
If all letters are correctly identified on any given line, then the subject is encouraged to read 
the next smaller line. When the subject says they cannot read a letter, they should be 
required to guess. A maximum effort should be made to identify each letter. A scoring 
sheet for each eye is provided to keep track of the letters correctly identified by [CONTACT_741992] 
“X” over the incorrectly identified letter. The subject continues reading down the chart to 
the last letter of a given line, until the subject has missed [ADDRESS_1014406] 
to be consecutive.

  1.3 Recording and Scoring logMAR Values 
Using the 
Sponsor supplied recording/scoring sheet, an example of which is shown below, 
the tester will record the actual VA measurement. 
The number of letters CORRECT will be recorded on the recording/scoring sheet in the far 
right box on the corresponding line. The lines will then be added up and the “TOTAL” 
number of letters correctly identified will be recorded on the recording/scoring sheet. The 
“TOTAL” is the number that will be entered onto the eCRF.  
Example of Distance VA: 
In the example below, all letters in lines [ADDRESS_1014407] 
would be considered complete. In this example, the total letters correctly identified is 42. 
This number is recorded in the space marked “TOTAL” and also recorded on the eCRF.

  • Lens cases for storage of worn study lenses (up to 10 pairs of lenses, stacked dry). 
 
GENERAL IN
FORMATION 
Do NOT use any products other than those dispensed to you by [CONTACT_742002]. 
If problems or symptoms should occur, immediately remove your lenses and follow the 
steps described in the sections of these instructions entitled Warnings and Adverse Effects . 
Prompt attention to problems is essential and may require immediate professional care. 
Remember, when wearing contact [CONTACT_13276], your eyes should look and feel good and your 
vision should be clear. 
Because they are worn directly on your eyes, contact [CONTACT_742003]. These effects tend to increase with the length of time the lenses remain on 
your eyes between removals. Although the great majority of people successfully wear 
contact [CONTACT_353713], before you decide whether to continue wearing contact 
[CONTACT_742004], you should discuss with your study doctor the effects of 
contact [CONTACT_742005]. You also 
should read the sections of these instructions entitled “Warnings”, ”Adverse Reactions”, 
“Precautions”, and “Wearing Restrictions and Indications”. Ask your study doctor to 
explain anything that you do not understand, including any additional restrictions which 
may be given to you by [CONTACT_6814]. These contact [CONTACT_742006]-use disposable wear, and should be replaced each time lenses are removed from your 
eyes. 
You also need to remember that soft contact [CONTACT_13276], including those covered by [CONTACT_742007], are made of a type of plastic that absorbs liquids, vapors and small particles, 
and for some people, may collect deposits from your natural eye fluids. Therefore, you 
should strictly follow these instructions and any other instructions given to you by [CONTACT_297478]. Any failure to follow these instructions and the wearing restrictions will 
increase the chances of contamination, damage to the lenses, or a buildup of deposits on 
the lenses, which can lead to serious, sight-threatening eye infections and injuries. 
Adherence to your prescribed wearing schedule and regular check-up visits to your study 
doctor are also necessary for the proper and safe use of contact [CONTACT_13276]. Soft contact [CONTACT_742008]. Therefore, be sure to follow the wearing 
schedule prescribed for you, and do not over wear your lenses simply because they remain 
comfortable and you are not experiencing a problem. Only your study doctor, through a 
professional examination, can determine how your eyes are reacting to the contact [CONTACT_742009]. 
Finally, if problems or symptoms should occur, immediately remove your lenses and 
follow the steps described in the section of these instructions entitled “Warnings and 
Adverse Reactions.” Prompt attention to problems is essential and may require 
immediately professional care. 
Remember, when wearing soft contact [CONTACT_686131], and 
your vision should be clear.

each removal. 
− Keep a spare pair of lenses available in case you have to remove your lenses 
immediately upon the appearance of a problem or symptom. 
− Do not use aerosol products such as hair spray while wearing your lenses. The 
lenses may absorb the spray, resulting in injury to the eye and damage to the lens. 
− Avoid wearing the lenses around fumes, irritating vapors, smoky or dusty 
conditions. The lenses may absorb the chemicals or particles, resulting in injury to 
the eye. 
− Avoid rubbing your eyes with the lenses in, which can irritate the eye or dislodge 
the lens. 
− If you get something in your eye, remove the lens immediately. Do not replace with 
new lens until your eye feels normal. 
− Tell your regular physician and every other doctor that you visit, that you wear 
contact [CONTACT_742010]. If you are admitted to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 
also tell your nurses that you wear contact [CONTACT_13276]. 
− A bottle of Sensitive Eyes® Drops will be dispensed to you at the 
Screening /
Dispensing Visit.  You may use these drops as needed throughout the 
study. Your Study Doctor can provide you with additional Drops should you need 
a new bottle. 
− Do not use any eye drops, ointments, or medicines in your eye unless they are 
specifically approved by [CONTACT_742011]. Some drops, ointments, or 
medicines will cause injury to the eye if used by a contact [CONTACT_35560]. 
− Ask your study doctor whether there are any other wearing restrictions that apply 
to you, write those restrictions in the spaces provided below and follow them

3. PRECAUTIONS 
You should be aware of and fully discuss with your study doctor the following safety 
precautions: 
− Do not use saliva or anything other than the recommended solutions for lubricating 
or wetting your lenses. 
− If the lens sticks (stops moving) on your eye, follow the recommended directions 
on Care for a Sticking Lens. The lens should move freely on your eye for the 
continued health of your eye.  If non-movement of the lens continues, you should 
immediately consult your study doctor. Do not attempt to remove the lens, except 
on the instructions of your study doctor. 
− Always wash and rinse your hands before handling lenses. Do not get cosmetics, 
lotions, soaps, creams, deodorants, or sprays in your eyes or on the lenses. It is best 
to put on lenses before putting on makeup. Water-base cosmetics are less likely to 
damage lenses than oil-base products. 
− Do not touch contact [CONTACT_742012], as microscopic scratches of the lenses may occur, causing 
distorted vision and/or injury to your eye. 
− Carefully follow these handling, insertion, and wearing instructions for the daily 
disposable contact [CONTACT_742013]. 
− Never wear lenses beyond the period recommended by [CONTACT_6814]. 
− Always handle lenses gently and avoid droppi[INVESTIGATOR_35459]. 
− Ask your study doctor about wearing lenses during water activities and other sports.

  − Inform your doctor (health care professional) about being a contact [CONTACT_35560]. 
− Never use
 tweezers or other tools to remove lenses from the lens container unless 
specifically indicated for that use. Pour the lens into your hand. 
− Do not touch the lens with your fingernails. 
− Always contact [CONTACT_742014]. 
− Always inform your employer of being a contact [CONTACT_35560]. Some jobs may 
require use of eye protection equipment or may require that you not wear contact 
[CONTACT_13276]. 
− As with any contact [CONTACT_13293], follow-up visits are necessary to assure the continuing 
health of your eyes. Your study doctor should provide you with a recommended 
follow-up schedule. 
 
4. ADVERSE REACTIONS (Problems And What To Do) 
You should be aware that the following problems may occur: 
− Eyes stinging, burning, itching (irritation), or other eye pain, 
− Comfort is less than when lens was first placed on eye, 
− Abnormal feeling of something in the eye (foreign body, scratched area), 
− Excessive watering (tearing) of the eyes, 
− Unusual eye secretions, 
− Redness of the eyes, 
− Reduced sharpness of vision (poor visual acuity), 
− Blurred vision, rainbows, or halos around objects, 
− Sensitivity to light (photophobia), 
− Dry eyes. 
If you notice any of the above, you should: 
− Immediately remove your lenses. 
− If the discomfort or problem stops, then look closely at the lens. If the lens has dirt, 
an eyelash, or other foreign body on it, or the problem stops and the lens appears 
undamaged, insert a new lens. After insertion of a new lens, if the problem 
continues, you should immediately remove the lenses and consult your study doctor. 
When any of the above problems occur, a serious condition such as infection, corneal ulcer, 
neovascularization, or iritis may be present. You should keep the lens off your eye and seek 
immediately professional identification of the problem and prompt treatment to avoid 
serious eye damage. 
 
5. PERSONAL CLEANLINESS and LENS HANDLING 
Study #890 - Protocol 
Date:  09Aug2019                                                   Confidential                       Page C-6  
  − Preparing the Lens for Wearing: 
It is essential that you learn and use good hygienic methods in the care and handling of the 
lenses. Cleanliness is the first and most important aspect of proper contact [CONTACT_224037]. In 
particular, your hands should be clean and free of any foreign substances when you handle 
your lenses. The procedures are: 
○ Always wash your hands thoroughly with mild soap, rinse completely, and dry 
with a lint-
free towel before touching your lenses. 
○ Avoid the use of soaps containing cold cream, lotion, or oily cosmetics before 
handling y
our lenses, since these substances may come into contact [CONTACT_742015]. 
○ Handle your lenses with your fingertips, and be careful to avoid contact [CONTACT_742016]
s. It is helpful to keep your fingernails short and smooth. 
○ Start off correctly by [CONTACT_742017]. 
○ Should you accidentally place an inside-out lens on your eye, one of the 
following s
igns should signal you to remove and replace it correctly: 
▪ Less than usual comfort, 
▪ The lens may fold on the eye, 
▪ Excessive lens movement on blink, 
▪ Blurred vision. 
If the lens f
olds and sticks together: Place the lens in the palm of your hand and GENTLY 
rub the lens between your index finger and palm in a gentle back and forth motion. Replace 
the lens if it does not unfold. 
If the lens flattens or drapes across your finger, the lens or your finger may be too wet. To 
correct this, dry your finger by [CONTACT_742018], drying the opposite finger each time. 
 
- Placing the Lens on the Eye: 
There are other methods of lens placement. If the following methods are difficult for you, 
your study doctor will provide you with an alternate method. 
Note :  If after placement of the lens, your vision is blurred, check for the following: 
○ The lens is not centered on the eye (see “Centering the Lens,” next in these 
instructio
ns). 
○ If the lens is centered, remove the lens (see “Removing the Lens” section) and 
check for th
e following: 
▪ Cosmetics or oils on the lens (replace the lens), 
▪ The lens is on the wrong eye, 
▪ The lens is inside-out (it would also not be as comfortable as normal). 
Study #890 - Protocol 
Date:  09Aug2019                                                   Confidential                       Page C-[ADDRESS_1014417] the lens on the lower white part of your eye. Remove your index finger 
and slowly release the lower lid. Look down to position the lens properly. Close your eyes 
for a moment; the lens will center itself on your eye. 
The Two-Hand Placement Technique 
With the lens on your index finger, use the middle finger 
of the other hand to pull the upper lid against the brow. 
Use the middle finger of your placement hand to pull 
down the lower lid and then place the lens centrally on 
your eye. While holding this position, look downward to 
position the lens properly. Slowly release your eyelids. 
If the lens feels uncomfortable, then look in the mirror and 
gently place a finger on the edge of the contact [CONTACT_742019]. Then by [CONTACT_145949], the lens will 
re-center itself. If the lens still feels uncomfortable, follow 
the steps described in the section of these instructions 
entitled “Adverse Reactions.” 
 
− Centering the Lens : 
Very rarely, a lens that is on the cornea will be displaced onto the white part of the eye 
during lens wear. This can also occur during placement and removal of the lenses if the 
correct techniques are not performed properly. To center a lens, follow one of the 
procedures below. 
Hold the upper and lower eyelids open with your fingers. Then while looking in a mirror, 
gently place a finger on the contact [CONTACT_742020]. 
Or 
Hold the upper and lower eyelids open with your fingers. Then, while looking in a mirror, 
move your eye towards the lens to place it on the center of the eye. 
 
− Removing the Lens: 
Always remove the same lens first. 
1) Wash, rinse, and dry your hands thoroughly. 

Study #890 - Protocol 
Date:  09Aug2019                                                   Confidential                       Page C-8  
  2) Always be sure that the lens is in the correct position on your eye before you try to 
remove it 
(a simple check of your vision, closing one eye at a time, will tell you if the lens 
is in the correct position). Look up and slowly pull down your lower eyelid with the middle 
finger of your removal hand and place your index finger on the lower edge of lens. Squeeze 
the lens lightly between the thumb and the index finger and remove it. Avoid sticking the 
edges of the lens together. 
3) Remove the other lens by [CONTACT_145951]. 
Note: If this method of removing your lens is difficult for you, your study doctor will 
provide you with an alternate method. 
 
− Care for a Sticking (Nonmoving) Lens: 
It is important to the health of your eyes that your contact [CONTACT_686135]. If a lens 
sticks (stops moving), put a few drops of the Bausch + Lomb Sensitive Eyes® Drops 
provided b
y your study doctor into your eye. In this case, do not use plain water or anything 
other than the recommended solutions. Do not attempt to remove a lens that is sticking, 
which could damage your eye. If the lens does not begin to move when you blink after 
several applications of the solution or, contact [CONTACT_458398]. Do not 
attempt to remove the lens except on the advice of your study doctor. 
 
6. EMERGENCIES

PRECAUTIONS 
Precautions for Eye Care Professionals: 
• Due to the small number of subjects enrolled in clinical investigation of lenses, all 
refractiv e
 powers, design configurations, or lens parameters available in the lens 
material are not evaluated in significant numbers.  Consequently, when selecting an 
appropriate lens design and parameters, the eye care professional should consider all 
characteristics of the lens that can affect lens performance and ocular health, including 
oxygen permeability, wettability, central and peripheral thickness, and optic zone 
diameter. 
• The potential impact of these factors on the subject’s ocular health should be carefully 
weighed ag
ainst the subject's need for refractive correction; therefore, the continuing 
ocular health of the subject and lens performance on eye should be carefully monitored 
by [CONTACT_288818]. 
• Fluorescein should not be used while the subject is wearing the lenses, because the 
lenses wil
l become discolored. Whenever fluorescein is used, flush the eyes with sterile 
saline solution.  Wait at least 5 minutes before inserting new lenses. If it is not possible 
to flush the eyes, wait a minimum of 1 hour before inserting new lenses. If inserted too 
soon, the lenses may absorb residual fluorescein. 
• Before leaving the eye care professional’s office, the subject should be able to promptly 
remove len s
es.

  • The lenses are prescribed for disposable wear, and are to be stored for return to the eye 
care profe
ssional once they are removed from the subject’s eye. It is important that 
subjects be instructed to always have available a pair of replacement lenses. In the event 
that a lens must be removed from the eye because of dust, a foreign body or other 
contaminant gets on the lens or the lens becomes dehydrated, the lens should be 
removed and replaced with a replacement lens. 
Eye care professionals should carefully instruct subjects about the following safety 
precautions: 
• If the lens sticks (stops moving) on the eye, follow the recommended directions on Care 
for a Sti c
king Lens. The lens should move freely on the eye for the continued health of 
the eye. If non-movement of the lens continues, the subject should be instructed to 
immediately  consult his or her eye care professional. Do not attempt to remove the 
lens, except on the instructions of the eye care professional. 
• Always wash and rinse hands before handling lenses. Do not get cosmetics, lotions, 
soaps, crea
ms, deodorants, or sprays in the eyes or on the lenses. It is best to put on 
lenses before putting on makeup. Water-base cosmetics are less likely to damage lenses 
than oil-base products. 
• Do not touch contact [CONTACT_615584], 
as microscopic scratches of the lenses may occur, causing distorted vision 
and/or injury to the eye. 
• Carefully follow the handling, insertion, removal, and wearing instructions in the 
Subject In
structions and those prescribed by [CONTACT_288820]. 
• Never wear lenses beyond the period recommended by [CONTACT_288820]. 
• If aerosol products such as hair spray are used while wearing lenses, exercise caution 
and keep e y
es closed until the spray has settled. 
• Always handle lenses gently and avoid droppi[INVESTIGATOR_35459]. 
• Avoid all harmful or irritating vapors and fumes while wearing lenses. 
• Ask the eye care professional about wearing lenses during water activities and other 
sports. 
• Info
rm the doctor (health care professional) about being a contact [CONTACT_35560]. 
• Never use tweezers or other tools to remove lenses from the lens container unless 
specifical
ly indicated for that use. Pour the lens into the hand. 
• Do not touch the lens with fingernails. 
• Always contact [CONTACT_742029]. 
• Always inform the employer of being a contact [CONTACT_35560]. Some jobs may require 
use of eye
 protection equipment or may require that the subject not wear contact [CONTACT_13276]. 
• As with any contact [CONTACT_13293], follow-up visits are necessary to assure the continuing health 
of the subje
ct’s eyes. The subject should be instructed as to a recommended follow-up 
schedule. 
ADVERSE REACTIONS  
Study #890 - Protocol 
Date:  09Aug2019                                                   Confidential                       Page D-[ADDRESS_1014419] should be informed that the following problems may occur: 
• Eyes stinging, burning, itching (irritation), or other eye pain, 
• Comfort is less than when lens was first placed on eye, 
• Abnormal feeling of something in the eye (foreign body, scratched area), 
• Excessive watering (tearing) of the eyes, 
• Unusual eye secretions, 
• Redness of the eyes, 
• Reduced sharpness of vision (poor visual acuity), 
• Blurred vision, rainbows, or halos around objects, 
• Sensitivity to light (photophobia), 
• Dry eyes. 
If the subj e
ct notices any of the above, he or she should be instructed to: 
• Immediately remove lenses. 
• If the discomfort or problem stops, then look closely at the lens. If the lens is in any 
way damage
d, do not put the lens back on the eye. Place the lens in the storage case 
and contact [CONTACT_288820]. If the lens has dirt, an eyelash, or other foreign 
body on it, or the problem stops and the lens appears undamaged, the subject should 
insert a new lens. After insertion of a new lens, if the problem continues, the subject 
should immediately remove the lenses and consult the eye care professional . 
If the above symptoms continue after removal of the lens, or upon insertion of a new lens, 
the subject should immediately remove the lenses and contact [CONTACT_742030], who must determine the need for examination, treatment or 
referral without delay. 
(See Important Treatment Information for Adverse Reactions.) A serious condition such as 
infection, corneal ulcer, corneal vascularization, or iritis may be present, and may progress 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375]. Less serious reactions such as abrasions, epi[INVESTIGATOR_741953]. 
IMPORTANT TREATMENT INFORMATION FOR ADVERSE REACTIONS 
Sight-threatening ocular complications associated with contact [CONTACT_93904][INVESTIGATOR_375], and therefore early recognition and treatment of problems are critical. Infectious 
corneal ulceration is one of the most serious potential complications, and may be 
ambiguous in its early stage. 
Signs and symptoms of infectious corneal ulceration include discomfort, pain, 
inflammation, purulent discharge, sensitivity to light, cells and flare and corneal infiltrates.  
Initial symptoms of a minor abrasion and an early-infected ulcer are sometimes similar. 
Accordingly, such epi[INVESTIGATOR_17754], if not treated properly, may develop into an infected 
ulcer. In order to prevent serious progression of these conditions, a subject presenting 
symptoms of abrasions or early ulcers should be evaluated as a potential medical 
emergency, treated accordingly, and be referred to a corneal specialist when appropriate.

steroid/an
tibiotic combinations may exacerbate the condition. If the subject is wearing a 
contact [CONTACT_742031], the lens should be removed immediately 
and the lens and lens care products retained for analysis and culturing. 
SELECTION OF SUBJECTS 
Persons who require vision correction and who would not or could not adhere to the 
replacement regimen for the Bausch + Lomb daily disposable contact [CONTACT_742032]. Failure to follow handling 
instructions could lead to serious eye infections, which might result in corneal ulcers. 
Subject communication is vital because it relates not only to subject selection but also to 
ensure compliance. It is also necessary to discuss the information contained in the Subject 
Instructions with the subject at the time of the initial examination. Subjects selected to wear 
the Bausch + Lomb daily disposable contact [CONTACT_742033], general health, and cooperation. The eye care professional must take 
care in selecting, examining, and instructing contact [CONTACT_742034]. Subject hygiene and 
willingness to follow eye care professional instructions are essential to their success. 
A detailed history is crucial to determining subject needs and expectations. Your subject 
should be questioned regarding vocation, desired lens-wearing time (full or part time), and 
desired lens usage (reading, recreation or hobbies). Initial evaluation of the lens should be 
preceded by a complete eye examination, including visual acuity, keratometry, and slit 
lamp examination. 
It is normal for the subject to experience mild symptoms such as lens awareness, variable 
vision, occasional tearing (watery eyes), and slight redness during the adaptation period.  
Although the adaptation period varies for each individual, generally within one week these 
symptoms will disappear. If these symptoms persist, the subject should be instructed to 
contact [CONTACT_288816]. 
FITTING PROCEDURE 
1. Pre-fitting Examination 
A pre-fitting subject history and examination are necessary to: 
− determine whether a subject is a suitable candidate for daily disposable contact 
[CONTACT_13276] (co n
sider subject hygiene and mental and physical state), 
− make ocular measurements for initial contact [CONTACT_367835], and 
− collect and record baseline clinical information to which post-fitting examination 
results can
 be compared. 
A pre-fitting examination should include spherocylindrical refraction and VA, keratometry, 
and biomicroscopic examination. 
2. Initial Lens Power Selection 
− Lens power is determined from the subject's spherical equivalent prescription 
corrected t
o the corneal plane. 
− Select the appropriate power lens and place the lens on the eye. Allow the lens to 
remain on  
the eye long enough (3 minutes) to achieve a state of equilibrium. Small

  variations in the tonicity, pH of the lens solutions, and individual tear composition 
may cause s
light changes in fitting characteristics. 
− Allow any increase in tear flow to subside before evaluating the lens. The time 
required wi
ll vary with the individual. 
3. Initial Lens Evaluation 
− To determine proper lens parameters observe the lens relationship to the eye using 
a slit lamp. 
○
 Movement: The lens should provide discernible movement with: 
▪ Primary gaze blink 
▪ Up gaze blink 
▪ Up gaze lag 
○ Centration: The lens should provide full corneal coverage. 
− Lens evaluation allows the contact [CONTACT_93920]/cornea 
relations h
ip in the same manner as would be done with any soft lens. 
4. Criteria of a Well-Fitted Lens 
If the initial lens selection fully covers the cornea, provides discernible movement after a 
blink, is comfortable and provides satisfactory visual performance, it is a well-fitted lens 
and can be dispensed. 
5. Characteristics of a Tight (Steep) Lens 
A lens which is much too steep may subjectively and objectively cause distortion which 
will vary after a blink. However, if a lens is only marginally steep, the initial subjective 
and objective vision and comfort findings may be quite good. A marginally steep lens may 
be differentiated from a properly fitted lens by [CONTACT_742035]. A properly 
fitted lens will tend to slide downward approximately 0.5mm while a steep lens will remain 
relatively stable in relationship to the cornea, particularly with the blink. 
6. Characteristics of a Loose (Flat) Lens 
If the lens is too flat, it will: 
− Decenter, especially on post-blink. 
− Have a tendency to edge lift inferiorly and sit on the lower lid, rather than 
positioni n
g between the sclera and palpebral conjunctiva. 
− Have a tendency to be uncomfortable and irritating with fluctuating vision. 
− Have a tendency to drop or lag greater than 2.[ADDRESS_1014421]-blink.

  − Prior to a follow-up examination, the contact [CONTACT_742036] [ADDRESS_1014422] lens wear. 
− With lenses in place on the eyes, evaluate fitting performance to assure that 
CRITERIA OF 
A WELL FITTED LENS continue to be satisfied. Examine the 
lenses closely for surface deposition and/or damage. 
− After the lens removal, instill sodium fluorescein (unless contraindicated) into the 
eyes and con
duct a thorough biomicroscopy examination. 
○ The presence of vertical corneal striae in the posterior central cornea and/or 
corneal ne o
vascularization may be indicative of excessive corneal edema. 
○ The presence of corneal staining and/or limbal-conjunctival hyperemia can be 
indicative
 of an unclean lens, a reaction to solution preservatives, excessive lens 
wear, and/or a poorly fitting lens. 
○ Papi[INVESTIGATOR_615555]/or damaged 
lens.  If a
ny of the above observations are judged abnormal, various 
professional judgments are necessary to alleviate the problem and restore the 
eye to optimal conditions.  
WEARING SCHEDULE 
The wearing and daily disposable schedules should be determined by [CONTACT_742037]. Regular checkups, as determined by [CONTACT_288820], are extremely 
important. 
Daily Disposable: 
There may be a tendency for the daily disposable subject to over-wear the lenses initially. 
Therefore, the importance of adhering to a proper, initial daily disposable schedule should 
be stressed to these subjects. The wearing schedule should be determined by [CONTACT_742037]. The wearing schedule chosen by [CONTACT_742038]. The lens is to be prescribed for single-use disposable wear, and is to be 
replaced after each removal. 
All subjects should be supplied with a copy of the Subject Instructions.

particular lens-wearing schedule. 
CARE FOR A STICKING (NONMOVING) LENS 
If the lens sticks (stops moving), the subject should be instructed to use their study 
rewetting drops in their eye. The subject should be instructed to not use plain water, or 
anything other than the recommended solutions. The subject should be instructed to contact 
[CONTACT_742039], and to not attempt to remove the lens except on the advice of 
the eye care professional.

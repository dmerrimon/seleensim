Studied period (years):  To Be Determined (TBD)  
  Date of first enrollment:   November 21, [ADDRESS_571897] completed:  TBD  Phase of development:  3  
Objective:  
The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of red blood cell ( RBC) transfusion for 
support of acute anemia in cardiovascular surgery patients based on the clinical outcome of renal impairment  
following transfusion of RBCs treated wi th the INTERCEPT Blood System for Red Blood Cells compared 
to patients transfused with conventional RBCs .

RBCs by [CONTACT_209565] (i.e., 75±[ADDRESS_571900] study transfusion) .  
Study Procedures:  
Screening/Recruitment  
In order to minimize the number of patients who enroll in the study but do not require RBC transfusion, only 
patie n
ts with a relatively high likelihood to receive a RBC transfusion as determined by [CONTACT_737] (e.g., 
patients receiving aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] , clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] (or analogs) and/or GPI[INVESTIGATOR_97086]/IIIa inhibitors), or patients with a TRUST 
Score of >3 will be eligible for enrollment. Patients  ≥[ADDRESS_571901] (IRB) approval of an appropriate informed consent process.  
All potentially eligible patients will be approached for study consent /assent  within 30 days prior to their 
surgical procedure. Subjects who consent /assent  to the study will be assigned a subject  ID number and undergo 
screening.  
Screening will includ e documentation of the patient’s  pre-surgical exposure to radiographic contrast media and 
number of prior pregnancies (females). Screening data may be derived from the medical record whe n 
performed within [ADDRESS_571902] components  will be entered into the clinical database via an electronic data capture (EDC) system  
using electronic case report forms ( eCRFs). Patients who fail eligibility for any or multiple inclusion/exclusion 
criteria may be rescreened for eligibility closer to th e time of surgery . 
Randomization and Blinding  
Eligible subjects will be randomiz ed up to 7 days before  or on the day of scheduled surgery  (Day 0 ). An 
Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) will be used for electronic randomization of eligible patients. 
Randomization (in 1:[ADDRESS_571903]:Control) stratified by [CONTACT_3725] , pre-existing renal impairment (baseline sCr 
≥1.2 mg/dL  vs. < 1.2 mg/dL ), and cardiac surgery group (more at risk for renal complication s vs. less  at risk ) 
will be employed . Screened subjects who receive a red cell transfusion prior to randomization will no longer 
be considered for randomization, and their participation in the study will end. Patients may be rescreened for 
eligibility closer to the time of surgery.  
Treatment   
Once a subject is randomized, only study RBCs ( Test or Control , per the subject’s randomization) should be 
dispensed and transfused d uring the acute transfusion support period  (Day [ADDRESS_571904]), as clinically indicated and determined by [CONTACT_1963].  
In rare exceptions where  study RBCs are unavailable  or patient’s need for RBC transfusions exceeds the 
quantity of study RBCs in inventory at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_449057] (e.g., during a  Massive Transfusion Protocol) , a

transfusion  using  non-study RBC  (conventional)  may be given to provide the patient with an appropriate and 
necessary treatment. In this case, a protocol deviation should be documented.  If a study RBC transfusion is 
given after randomization before surgery commences , a protocol deviation should also be documented.    
Treatment assessments will be divided into an acute transfusion support  period starting the day of surgery 
(Day 0 up to Day 7) during which study RBC (Test or Control) are administered, a post -surgical follow -up 
period of a minimum of [ADDRESS_571906] additional safety data, a clinical 
assessment at day 30 after surgery specifically for mortality and RRT status, and a visit at day 75 (±15) after 
the last study transfusion to assess mortality and RRT status, and collect samples for serological screening for 
antibodies specific to INTERCEPT  RBC s. 
In all patients , anesthesia and surgical procedures will be performed according to the local standards of care.  
Following the acute transfusion support period, subjects may receive conventional RBC components if additional transfusions are needed, as indicated by [CONTACT_449091].   
Study Assessments: Monitoring and Follow -up 
Baseline  through Acut
 e Transfusion Support  Period (Pre -Op Day -[ADDRESS_571907] -Op Day 7)  
A screen for antibodies specific for INTERCEPT RBCs should be performed every time that a routine IAT is 
performed during the acute 7- day study transfusion period.  
A blood sample for sCr will be taken at 48 ±[ADDRESS_571908] 48 
hours after surgery will be discontinued from the study and replaced.  
Daily sCr assessments  will be recorded up to and including  48 ±[ADDRESS_571909] baseline laboratory parameters and adverse events (AEs) will not be collected for non -
transfused subjects . Vital status  will be reported for randomized and non -transfused subjects  at the time of 
discontinuation. 
Hemodynamic  and laboratory measures will be assessed pre- operatively (Day -1, Baseline ) and daily  as 
available in the medical record  from post -operative Day [ADDRESS_571910] of 
care visit on Day 7, blood sample s should be obtained on that day for a complete blood count and sCr 
determination.   
Hemodynamic parameters that will be collected if available, include heart rate, blood pressure, mean arterial 
pressure, central venous pressure (CVP), and peripheral oxygen saturation via pulse oximetry probe.

Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)  
The study will be monitored by [CONTACT_274391] (DSMB). The primary 
mission of the DSMB is to ensure patient safety  and review protocol compliance for data collec tion. The 
DSMB will be assembled by [CONTACT_449092]. DSMB members will be indep endent of the Sponsor.  
Interim Analysis and Early Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_449058]-estimation  performed in October 2021, no other 
interim analysis is planned for this study to compare treatment differences with respect to efficacy or safety at 
any time prior to the completion of the study.  Specific stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], defined for safety considerations, are 
defined in Section 4.6 of the protocol.  
Number of patients:  
A total of at least [ADDRESS_571918] and Control components in patients undergoing cardiac surgery procedures.  
For the primary efficacy endpoint, the proportion of patients with  a ∆sCr ≥0.3 mg/dL from  pre-surge ry 
baseline to  within 48±[ADDRESS_571919] will be conducted to assess for treatment 
difference (Test  − Control ).  By [CONTACT_449093] 3 0% in the Control group and no more than 50% 
increase from the Control rate as the non- inferiority margin, a sample size of 292 patients  (146 per arm) will 
provide approximately 80% power to declare non -inferiority at the two -sided 0.05 alpha level, assuming the 
true treatment difference is zero .  
Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion:

included in this analysis .   
Secondary efficacy outcome measures  include : 
• The proportion of patients with a diagnosis of stage I, II or III Acute Kidney Injury (KDIGO 2012)  
based on changes in sCr levels  from pre -surgery baseline  and the need for rena l replacement therapy 
(RRT)  post-surgery .  
• Mortality or the need for RRT by [ADDRESS_571927] -surgery. 
Safety:  
The primary safety outcome measures are the:  
• Proportion of patients with any treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs) possibly, probably or 
definitely related to study RBC transfusion through [ADDRESS_571928] study transfusion; and   
• Proportion of patients with treatment emergent antibodies with confirmed specificity to INTERCEPT 
RBCs by [CONTACT_53410] ( i.e., 75 ±[ADDRESS_571929] study transfusion) .

Statistical methods:  
For the primary efficacy endpoint, the treatment difference (Test – Control) and its two -sided 95% confidence 
interval (CI) will be estimated from Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by [CONTACT_449096] (sCr ≥1.2 
mg/dL vs. < 1.2 mg/dL) and cardiac surgery group (more at risk for renal complications vs. less at risk) 
performed. The upper bound of the two- sided 95% CI will be compared with the 50% of the observed Control 
rate. Non -inferiority will be achieved if the upper bound is less than the 50% of the observed Control rate.  For 
the non -inferiority test, the null and alternative hypotheses (H 0 and H 1, respectively) will be formulated as 
follows:𝐻𝐻 0: 𝑃𝑃𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇−𝑃𝑃𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑇𝑇𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶≥50% ×𝑃𝑃�𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑇𝑇𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶     𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣.    𝐻𝐻1: 𝑃𝑃𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇−𝑃𝑃𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑇𝑇𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶<50% ×𝑃𝑃�𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑇𝑇𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶,    
where 𝑃𝑃𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 and 𝑃𝑃𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑇𝑇𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 are the event rates  for Test (INTERCEPT) and Control  groups , respectively , and 
𝑃𝑃�𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑇𝑇𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶is the observed Control rate. 
Same C
MH test will be used for assessment of treatment differences for the secondary efficacy endpoints.  As 
a sensitivity analysis, logistic regression will be utilized to estimate the treatment differences after controlling for baseline sCr, cardiac surgery group performed and other covariates to be detailed in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).  Treatment -emergent AEs (defined as AEs with an onset date/time that is on or after the start 
date/time of the first study transfusion) will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570], system organ class (SOC), and

CLI [ADDRESS_571955] to disclosure without express written consent from Cerus Corporation.  2 BACKGROUND I NFORMATION 
 GENERAL  
Red blood cell ( RBC) transfusion is a critical supportive therapy for healthcare. 
Patients and physicians assume, when required, blood transfusion will be available 
and safe. However, serious transfusion-transmitted infections (TTI) caused by [CONTACT_419939], bacteria and protozoa (Stramer 2009, MacLennan 2006); and fatal transfusion complications such as transfusion- associated graft -versus- host disease 
(TA-GVHD) still pose a threat to transfusion recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (Kopolovic 2015). 
Currently, prevention of TTI includes pre-donation evaluation and selection of low-risk donors, followed by [CONTACT_449099]/or nucleic acid testing for selected known infectious pathogens.  
The advent of testing has greatly reduced TTI from blood products, particularly 
viral disease, and sepsis associated with the t ransfusion of bacterially contaminated 
red cell blood components is generally regarded as a very rare event. However, from 1976 through September 1998, 26 fatalities thought to be secondary to contaminated whole blood or red cells were reported to the U.S. FDA (Lee 1999). The majority of deaths reported to the FDA involved Yersinia enterocolitica . The highest reported 
incidence of Y. enterocolitica  contamination was reported in New Zealand, with an 
incidence rate of 1 in 65,000 and a fatality rate of 1 in 104,000 red cell units transfused (Theakston et al. 1997). Unrecognized cases, underreporting, and regional variation may account for observed differences in this incidence. Interestingly, passive reporting studies of bacterially contaminated red cells from 
the [LOCATION_002], [LOCATION_009], and the [LOCATION_008] that caused symptoms of 
infection show a relative paucity of Y. enterocolitica  cases (Perez et al. 2001, 
Kuehnert et al. 2001, Serious Hazards of Transfusion report for 2000-2001). Of the reported deaths, one was due to a coagulase-negative Staphylococcus strain and 
seven were due to a variety of gram-negative organisms (including Serratia 
liquefaciens  in three cases). These organisms are all capable of growth at 
refrigerated temperatures (1 ° to 6°C). Sepsis associated with the transfusion of red 
cells contaminated with gram- negative bacteria is typi[INVESTIGATOR_449066] 
(Brecher and Hay 2005). Patients frequently develop high fever (temperatures as high as 109°F have been observed) and chills during or immediately following transfusion. From 1987 to February 1996, 20 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22880] Y. enterocolitica  red cells 
were reported to the Centers for Disease Control (Cookson et al, 1996). Twelve of 
the 20 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_449067], and the median time to death was only 25 hours. Of the seven 
who developed disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, six died.

Title :  A Randomized, Double -Blinded, Controlled, Parallel Group, Non- inferiority, Phase III Study to Evaluate 
the Efficacy and Safety of the INTERCEPT Blood System for Red Blood Cells in Patients undergoing Complex 
Cardiac Surgery Procedures (the ReCePI [CONTACT_3449])  
 
CLI [ADDRESS_571956] shown a 
much higher incidence of bacterial contamination (Damgaard et al 2015).  The organisms commonly cultured are Staphylococcus sp. or Propi[INVESTIGATOR_449068].; 
those strains that have been reported to be isolated in association with adverse 
events linked to the transfusion of contaminated red cell concentrates include Pseudomonas sp., S. marcescens, Enterobacter sp., Klebsiella sp., S. epi[INVESTIGATOR_449069] B. cereus (Siblini et al 2004).   
Newly -emerging infectious agents also remain important risks to blood safety. 
Estimates of per -unit and per-patient aggregate infectious risks for conventional 
RBCs, including known and potential emerging infectious agents (EIA, modeled 
based on chikungunya and dengue viruses) were calculated by [CONTACT_449100] (2015).  Minimum and maximum per- unit risks were calculated as 
0.0003% (1/323,000) and 0.12% (1/831), respectively.  The minimum estimate is for known lower- risk pathogens while the maximal estimate also includes an EIA 
and endemic area Babesia sp. risk.  For patients with hemoglobinopathies who receive repeated RBC transfusions such as sickle cell disease ( SCD ), at the 
minimum risk level it is estimated that approximately 1/450 (0.22%) of patients will acquire an infection during their entire course of transfusion therapy (approximately 
30-50 years); at the maximum risk levels, infections risk inc reases to 43 -45% for 
patients with hemoglobinopathies, or almost 1 in every 2 patients (Kleinman and 
Stassinopoulos 2015). 
Leukoreduced RBC concentrates  contain <5 x10
6 white blood cells ( WBC ) that may 
induce TA- GVHD and/or alloimmunization to human leukocyte antigen ( HLA) 
antigens. Gamma irradiation can effectively prevent TA -GVHD in transfusion 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. However, almost half the cases of TA -GVHD occur in patients in which 
their treating physicians failed to identify risk using current guidelines for blood 
irradiation, leading to substantial morbidity and mortality (Kopolovic 2015). Moreover, irradiation adversely affects post-transfusion RBC recovery (Dumont 2008) and is associated with raised extracellular potassium levels in the transfused 
concentrates .  
To proactively address the risk of TTIs and TA-GVHD, Cerus has developed 
pathogen and leukocyte inactivation technology systems (INTERCEPT Blood 
System ™) for platelet and plasma components and is currently developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a system 
for RBC concentrates. These systems use nucleic acid -targeted compounds that 
intercalate into, and upon activation, covalently bind to nucleic acids of viruses, 
bacteria, parasites and leukocytes that may contaminate blood components, and 
form irreversible adducts and crosslinks thus preventing replication and TTI. This

damage cells and proteins. RBCs do not require nucleic acid for therapeutic function and thus retain therapeutic efficacy after pathogen i nactivation treatment. 
INTERCEPT treated RBC (INTERCEPT RBCs) components should not require gamma irradiation because the treatment process inactivates donor white blood cells with a high safety margin (Castro et al. 2016).  It is also possible that INTERCE PT 
treatment may interfere with antigen presentation by [CONTACT_449101], thereby 
[CONTACT_449102].  
Conventional leukoreduced RBC concentrates include approximately 20-40 m L of 
residual plasma that contains serum proteins and immunoglobulins ; these  are 
implicated in allergic TRs and Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI) . 
The INTERCEPT RBC process includes a terminal washing step that reduces the 
concentration of plasma proteins and may reduce the incidence of these reactions.  
The INTERCEPT Blood System for RBCs inactivates a variety of bacteria, viruses and protozoa. The organisms evaluated to date include examples representing a range of different characteristics, such as enveloped (HIV and DHBV) and non-enveloped (Bluetongue virus), RNA genome (HIV and BVDV) and DNA genome 
(DHBV), and single stranded (HIV) and double stranded (DHBV) genomes. The 
bacteria evaluated represent Gram negative bacilli (Yersinia sp., Serratia sp., E. coli , 
Salmonella sp. and Pseudomonas sp.) and Gram positive cocci ( S. epi[INVESTIGATOR_95232] 
S. aureus ) that are significant especially for RBC transfusion. The protozoan 
parasites evaluated to date are Plasmodium falciparum  and Babesia microti . 
INTERCEPT RBCs have demonstrated adequate viability in terms of in vivo recovery and lifespan for transfusion (Cancelas 2015), and a recently completed Phase 3 clinical study (CLI [ZIP_CODE]) in cardiovascular surgery patients conducted in 
Europe has demonstrated that INTERCEPT RBCs possess in vitro characteristics 
comparable to untreated RBCs with a comparable safety profile (Brixner 2015, Rico 2015).

 SUMMARY OF NONCLINICAL AND CLINICAL STUDIES  
The INTERCEPT treatment process uses amustaline and glutathione together with a 
processing solution in a single-us e disposable set to produce pathogen inactivated 
RBCs in SAG -M additive solution.  Cerus’ pre -clinical and clinical development 
program has evaluated the efficacy of amustaline for pathogen inactivation and 
safety profiles of treated RBCs and breakdown products with regard to systemic 
toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity in accordance with International Council 
on Harmonization (ICH) standards for RBCs development of pharmaceuticals. 
These data are presented in detail in the Investigator’s Brochure.

No physiologically relevant toxicity using INTERCEPT RBCs at doses higher than 
planned for this trial was observed in pre- clinical studies. Additional information 
about the toxicological evaluations of the treatment system is provided in detail in 
the Investigator’ s Brochure .  
2.3.[ADDRESS_571961] ion of S-303 can also lead to reactions with macromolecules 
other than nucleic acids in the blood components, such as constituents of the red cell 
membrane. In early studies of the pathogen inactivation process for RBCs (referred 
to as “Original process”) there was evidence of antibody formation directed against 
INTERCEPT RBCs (also referred to as S-303- specific  RBC antibodies) in two 
patients participating in a chronic RBC transfusion study.  In order to minimize 
these non-specific and unwanted reactions w ith RBC surface molecules, an 
increased level of the quencher, glutathione (GSH), has been included in the current, pathogen inactivation process (referred to as “ Current process”) .  
Additional information regarding the potential for immunogenicity, and the studies 
that have been conducted is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.

 SUMMARY OF POTENTIAL RISKS  
The potential risks of this study include those adverse reactions that are recognized to 
occur following any  transfusion of RBC components and could be anticipated to 
occur with either control or INTERCEPT-treated components including, but not 
limited to, delayed serologic transfusion reactions (DSTRs ), acute hemolytic 
transfusion reactions (A HTR s), delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTRs ), 
febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTRs ), allergic (urticarial) reactions, 
anaphylaxis, transfusion- related  acute lung injury (TRALI), transfusion- associated 
circulatory overload (TACO), transfusion- related sepsis (TRS), or transfer of an 
infectious agent via transfusion/transfusion transmitted infection (TTI), respectively, 
transfusion- associated graft -vs-hos t disease (TA -GVHD), and allo -immunization to 
RBC and HLA antigens.  
The development of antibodies to INTERCEPT RBCs, or to neoantigens formed as a result of acridine binding to red cells, could occur as a result of transfusion with 
INTERCEPT RBCs. Acridine -specific antibodies were observed in an early and 
current ongoing blinded studies  (as described in the Investigator’s Brochure) and 
many  could be neutralized with acridine in solution, thereby [CONTACT_449104]. The occurrence of these antibodies was not associated with any clinical 
events or observations. The Current process  has been optimized to decrease the 
likelihood of this event.  
A screening study was performed to evaluate the prevalence of natural antibodies 
with specificity for INTERCEPT RBCs (SUD [ZIP_CODE]). Five plasma samples from 998 
subjects requiring chronic transfusion support for anemia and 12 plasma samples 
from 10,721 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_449070]- reactions with 
INTER CEPT RBCs.  The cumulative prevalence of cross -reactive antibodies to 
INTERCEPT RBCs was 0.15%.  Each of the antibodies identified was characterized 
and none were found to be IgG
[ADDRESS_571971] of Control RBCs.

CLI [ZIP_CODE], v8.[ADDRESS_571972] related to the 
occurrence of delayed serological and hemolytic TRs associated with treatment 
emergent antibodies to INTERCEPT RBCs.  
Additional risks associated with Control components, that INTERCEPT treatment is 
designed to reduce, include risk of infectious contamination by [CONTACT_449105], such as HIV, HCV, HBV, malaria, and emerging viruses such as Zika, Dengue and Chikungunya. 
The risk of bacterial contamination is considered to be negligible with INTERCEPT 
RBC components and, although it has not been measured directly, is expected to be less than the risk of bacterial contamination with conventional RBC components, thus 
providing a potential benefit of receiving INTERCEPT-treated components. 
Finally, human error, clerical error and transfusion of RBC to the wrong patient 
remain risks of red cell transfusion. 
 DESCRIPTION OF AND RATIONALE FOR TREATMENT  
Patients undergoing cardiac surgery are an appropriate study population because (i)  
these patients commonly require multiple RBC transfusions for support of acute anemia and might be expected to manifest complications ascribed to exposure to 
allogeneic blood, (ii)  cardiac surgery patients comprise a large group of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_449071] a national basis account for a 
significant proportion of blood component utilization, and (iii) following cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_4897], patients are in a pro-inflammatory state which 
might make them particularly vulnerable to adverse consequences of RBC 
transfusion, especially decreased  tissue and organ oxygenation. While other types of surgical patients receive blood for acute anemia, they are either dif ficult to study in a 
clinical trial setting (e.g. , trauma patients) or they may have high rates of autologous 
blood transfusion use (e.g., orthopedic patients). Cardiac surgery is also one setting 
where a liberal RBC transfusion policy has been documented to increase overall survival, suggesting an important role in ensuring tissue oxygenation (Murphy 2015).

measures of therapeutic benefit  (Weiskopf 1998). In addition, evaluation of RBC 
component therapeutic efficacy is challenging because no single endpoint adequately reflects RBC transfusion efficacy in acute anemia. However, a reasonable approach is 
to assess a single key organ system such as renal as the primary endpoint.  
Accordingly, the primary efficacy measure in the proposed study is renal impairment 
defined by [CONTACT_449106] .  
Lassnigg et al.  (Lassnigg 2004, Lassnigg 2008) found that m easuring repeat sCr 
concentrations within 48 hours of c ardiothoracic surgery and determining the ∆ sCr 
from pre -surgery baseline concentrations was  the most effective discrimination 
method to find patients at risk for adverse postoperative outcomes, including 
mortality by [CONTACT_2006] [ADDRESS_571974]- surgery , they found that ∆ sCr concentrations declined in the majority of 
patients and was associated with the lowest mortality (1.8%). Minimal increases  [0-
0.5 mg/dL were associated with a more than doubled mortality in both centers 
(5%/6%).   Used as a sole criterion, ∆sCr within 48 hours of surgery was more 
sensitive than the RIFLE (Mehta 2007) and AKIN (Bellomo 2004) definitions of 
Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) as a correlate of poor outcomes. The most important findings of these studies were that 1) even a small absolute increase in sCr in the post-
cardia c surgery setting confers an adverse prognosis and increases the risk of death; 
2) a window of 48 hours following cardiac surgery was able to classify the risk 
groups; and 3) ease of use and early prediction ability of absolute sCr  changes alone 
challenge the RIFLE and AKIN classifications in these patients.   
Historically acute kidney injury (AKI) is known to complicate recovery from cardiac 
surgery in up to 30% of patients, and places patients at a 5 -fold increased risk of 
death during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ( O'Neal et al. 2016).  
AKI has been validated as a predictor of adverse outcomes after cardiac su rgery 
based on sCr assessment alone. Many analyses do not incorporate urinary output 
(UO) as a component of the AKI measure, especially in cardiac surgery patients . For 
example:

CLI [ZIP_CODE], v8.[ADDRESS_571975] to disclosure without express written consent from Cerus Corporation.  • Hobson et al. (Hobson 2009) describe 2973 cardiac surgery patients between 
1992 and 2002 and define AKI as a ≥50% increase in sCr from pre- surgery 
baseline. Survival was worse among patients with AKI and was proportional to 
its severity, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.23 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.42). 
• Loef et al . (Loef 2005) describe an association of in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_449072]-operative sCr levels only, in 843 cardiac surgery patients in 1991 (hazard ratio of death 1.83;95% confidence interval 1.38 to 3.20). 
• More recently, Zhou et al. (Zhou 2016) confirmed the association of AKI based 
only on sCr criteria, with higher mortality and longer length of stay in 1036 
critically ill ICU patients.  
AKI that requires renal replacement therapy occurs in 2 –5 % of patients following 
cardiac surgery and is associated with 50 % mort ality (O'Neal 2016). For those who 
recover from renal replacement therapy or even mild AKI, progression to chronic kidney disease in the ensuing months and years is more likely than for those who do 
not develop AKI. Renal ischemia, reperfusion, inflammation, hemolysis, oxida tive 
stress, cholesterol emboli, and toxins are known to contribute to the development and progression of AKI. Transfusion with RBC may prevent AKI by [CONTACT_449107], but is also hypothesized to exacerbate AKI by 
[CONTACT_449108] -transferrin bound iron, promotion of a pro- inflammatory state, 
impairment of tissue oxygen delivery, and exacerbation of tissue oxidative stress (Karkouti 2012). A comparison of AKI incidence using conventional and 
INTERCEPT- treated RBC in cardiac surgery therefore offers a sensitive predictive 
measure of the equivalence of long -term o utcomes following acute RBC transfusion 
for both benefits and potential harms. 
Lassnigg et al. (Lassnigg 2004, Lassnigg 2008) found an association of small changes 
in serum creatinine ( ∆sCr) in the first 48 hours after surgery with mortality by [CONTACT_4475] 30, 
and an independent association of transfusion with adverse outcomes. I n the ReCePI

The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of RBC transfusion 
for support of acute anemia in cardiovascular surgery patients based on the clinical outcome of renal impairment following transfusion of RBCs treated with the 
INTERCEPT Blood System for Red Blood Cells compared to patients transfused 
with conventional RBCs.

rate and two -sided 0.05 alpha level. Patients who receive a study transfusion but die 
within 48 hours after surgery will be included in the mITT  analysis but excluded from 
the per protocol analysis. 
The primary safety  endpoint s are: 
• Proportion of patients with any treatment -emergent adverse event s (TEAEs)

these patients have many adverse events which are unrelated to study RBC 
transfusion.

their complex cardiac surgery . Patients already hospi[INVESTIGATOR_449079]. 
Patients undergoing urgent or emergent cardiac surgery are eligible for the study, 
subject t o institutional review board (IRB) approval of an appropriate informed 
consent process. 
In order to minimize the number of patients who enroll in the study but do not require 
RBC transfusion, only patients with a relatively high likelihood to receive a 
transfusion as determined by [CONTACT_737] (e.g., patients currently on regimen of 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] (or analogs) and/or GPI[INVESTIGATOR_97086]/IIIa inhibitors), or patients with a 
TRUST score of ≥[ADDRESS_572031] score of ≥3 
corre sponds to a high likelihood of requiring red cell transfusion within 96 hours of 
surgery .  Study consent /assent  will be sought in these eligible subjects within 30 days 
of their surgical procedure. Subjects who consent /assent  to the study will be assigned 
a subject  identification ( ID) number and undergo screening.  
The complete list of s creening assessments are outlined in T able 7.1a. Data may be 
derived from the medical record where performed within [ADDRESS_572032]’s home to collect  screening assessments . Patients who fail eligibility for any 
or multiple inclusion/exclusion criteria may be rescreened for eligibility clo ser to the 
time of surgery. 
All available components of the TRUST score (age, sex , Hb, weight, type of surgery, 
serum creatinine, surgical history and surgical task) will be collected on the case 
report form.  The TRUST score (or the minimum and maximum possible TRUST scores, if there are any missing components) will be calculated according to the published algorithm ( APPENDIX  1). 
Eligible subjects will be randomized up to 7 days before  or on the day of surgery, but prior to 
the start of surgery  (i.e., induction of anesthesia ). The adverse event collection period will 
begin at the beginning of surgery or the first study RBC transfusion, whiche ver is first .

 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
7.2.1 Efficacy Parameters  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of patients with a diagnosis of renal 
impairment defined as an y increase in sCr ≥0.3 mg/dL ( or 26.5 µmol/L) from the pre -
surgery baseline within 48±[ADDRESS_572087] 
meets this criteri on before receivin g a study transfusion, that particular event will not be 
included in this analysis. 
Treatment difference (Test −Control) will be compared between the subjects who were 
randomized to receive INTERCEPT RBC s vs. those randomized to receive 
conventional RBCs  with a non- inferiority margin of 50% increase from the Control rate 
and two-sided 0.05 alpha level.    
Secondary efficacy parameters that will be assessed include: 
• The proportion of patients with a diagnosis of stage I, II or  III Acute Kidney Injury 
(KDIGO 2012) based on changes in sCr levels from baseline and the need for 
renal replacement therapy (RRT ) post- surgery .  
• Mortal ity or the need for RRT by [CONTACT_2006] [ADDRESS_572088]-surgery. 
7.2.2 Methods and Timing of Efficacy Parameters   
Hemodynamic and laboratory measures will be assessed pre -operatively (Day -1 or pre-
operatively on the day of surgery) and daily from post-operative Day [ADDRESS_572089]. Serum creatinine  
will be determined on a daily basis during the acute transfusion support period and , in 
order to capture the primary efficacy endpoint, a sample for sCr will be taken also at 
48±[ADDRESS_572090]  (refer to Study Schedule of Assessments; Section 7 .1).  
An end of acute transfusion period a blood sample will be collected  at Day 7, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7954], or death, whichever occurs first. If a subject is discharged prior to Day [ADDRESS_572091] of care visit on Day 7, blood samples should be obtained on that day for a complete blood count and sCr determination.

 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
7.3.1 Safety Parameters   
The primary safety outcome measures are the:  
• Proportion of patients with any treatment- emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) 
possibly, probably or definitely related to study RBC transfusion through [ADDRESS_572093] study transfusion.  
• Proportion of patients with treatment emergent antibodies with confirmed  
specificity to INTERCEPT RBCs ).  
Additional safety assessments will inclu de, but are not limited to: 
• Treatment -emergent AEs through [ADDRESS_572094] study transfusion. 
• Treatment -emergent SAEs through [ADDRESS_572095] study transfusion. 
• Transfusion reactions (as defined by [CONTACT_449095] [NHSN] Hemovigilance Module protocol) through [ADDRESS_572096] study transfusion. 
• Treatment -emergent immunization to RBC allo -antigens through 28±[ADDRESS_572097] study transfusion.  
• Treatment -emergent immunization to HLA allo -antigens through 28±[ADDRESS_572098] study transfusion. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical (investigational) product and which does not necessarily 
have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product whether or 
not related to the medicinal (investigational) product (ICH E2A II/A/1,  21 CFR  312.32).

CLI [ZIP_CODE], v8.[ADDRESS_572099] to disclosure without express written consent from Cerus Corporation.  [IP_ADDRESS] Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
A Serious A E (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in any 
of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• Life-threatening event (results in an immediate risk of death from the reaction as it 
occurred)  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Important medical events th at may not result in death, be life-threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and/or may require 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes l isted in this definition.  
The terms "severe" and "serious" are not synonymous. Severity refers to the intensity of 
an adverse event (e.g., rated as mild, moderate, or severe, life-threatening or death according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (NCI CTCAE) criteria). Severity and seriousness need to be assessed for each 
adverse event recorded on the eCRF.  
SAE  must be reported by [CONTACT_10550] (i.e., no more 
than 24 hours) after learning of the event. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Unexpected Adverse Event  
Any adverse event occurring in one or more subjects in a research protocol, the nature, severity, or frequency of which is not consistent with (a)  the applicable product 
information (protocol, informed consent /assent , Investigator’s Brochure or other 
product labeling), or (b) the expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder or condition of the subject experiencing the adverse event and the subject’s predisposing risk factor profile for the adverse event.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects  
Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death 
caused by, or possibly, probably or definitely related to  a device, if that effect, problem, 
or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the 
investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or

[IP_ADDRESS] Definition  of Renal Impairment  
For the purposes of this study, renal impairment is defined as an increase in sCr ≥ 0.3 
mg/dL from the pre- surgical baseline concentration . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of Acute Kidney In jury (AKI)  
For the purposes of this study, a definition of an acute kidney injury during the study is based on the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) AKI workgroup 
definition ( KDIGO 2012 ) criteria as : 
• An increase  sCr ≥50% of the pre -surgery baseline level within [ADDRESS_572101]-
surgery, OR  
• An increase in sCr ≥0.3 mg/dL (26.5 µ mol/L) from pre-surgery baseline within 48 
hours of surgery. 
For the purposes of this study, acute kidney injury s tages are defined as follows  
(KDIGO AKI workgroup) :  
Stage 1   Serum creatinine:  1.5–1.9 times baseline within 7 days after surgery  
OR 
≥0.3 mg/dl (≥26.5 µmol/L ) increase within 48 hours of surgery 
 
Stage 2  Serum creatinine:  2.0–2.9 times baseline within 7 days after surgery 
 Stage 3  Serum creatinine:  3.0 times baseline within 7 days after surgery 
OR 
Increase in serum creatinine to ≥4.0 mg/dl (≥353.6 µmol/L ) 
OR 
Initiation of renal replacement therapy  
 
If a renal event during the study fulfills KDIGO laboratory criteria as specified above, 
this may constitute an AE/SAE of AKI as per Investigator’s clinical judgement.

For the purposes of this study RRT is defined as the institution of hemodialysis or 
peritoneal dialysis to treat acute or  chronic renal failure associated with a decrease in 
glomerular filtration rate  with or without fluid overload, severe acidosis, hyperkalemia 
or other electrolyte abnormalities . Dialysis performed solely to treat toxin/poisonings or 
performed preventativel y during surgery while on a by[CONTACT_348693], will not be 
considered RRT in the terms of meeting a secondary endpoint. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment -emergent HLA antibodies  
For the purposes of this study, HLA Class I and II antibody testing will be performed in 
a central laboratory according to the method described by [CONTACT_449121]. (Triulzi 2009). 
Screening tests for anti -HLA Class I and II will be performed with multi-antigen bead 
kits (LabScreen LSM12, LabScreen Mixed, One Lambda, Canoga Park, CA) according 
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Data will be using two different normalized 
background ( NBG) ratio cut -offs.  The data will be analyzed using the manufacturer’s 
recommended cutoff of a NBG ratio of 2.2.  The data will also be analyzed  using NBG 
ratios of the mean plus three or five standard deviations of a log transformed distribution of values for plasma samples for non- transfused males, as described (Triulzi 
2009).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of Culture Proven Sepsis/ Septic Shock 
For the purposes of this study, transfusion related sepsis/septic shock is defined as a 
positive culture from blood and/or CSF and a study RBC product with matching 
bacterial strains, with at least 3 of the following signs of septic inflammatory response 
syndrome (SIRS) (Levy  2003):  
• Temperature < 36°C or > 38°C 
• Heart rate > 90  bpm 
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] > 20 breaths/min or PaCO

 Clinically Significant Antibodies (Chapman et al. 2004) 
Clinically significant antibodies are those that are capable of causing patient morbidity 
due to accelerated destruction of a significant proportion of transfused red cells. 
  Delayed Serological Transfusion Reaction (DSTR) (Ness et al. 1990; 
Garratty 2012)  
The DSTRs  are where a particular alloantibody can be shown to be present in the 
patient’s  plasma, on the transfused donor RBCs and/or in an eluate from these RBCs, 
but no clinical or laboratory signs of hemolytic anemia (HA) are present. Regardless of 
the mechanism, the persistence of a positive DAT does not correlate with the presence 
or absence of clinical hemolysis (Ness 1990). 
The DSTR may be in the form of new antibodies or a rising titer of antibodies in 
patients with pre -existing antibodies (patients with pre -existing antibodies specific to 
INTERCEPT RBCs at baseline evaluation will be excluded in ReCePI ). DSTR will be

Transfusion with Study RBC Components  
 Assessment of Immune Reactivity to INTERCEPT RBCs  
At the time of RBC c rossmatch and at sp ecified times during the study [ screenin g 
(Table 7.1a) during the acute transfusion support period ( Table 7.1c ) and at Day 28 
(±3 days) and day 75 (± 15 days) ( Table 7.1e ) post first study transfusion; ], patient 
plasma/serum samples are tested for the presence of antibody specific to INTERCEPT 
RBCs. The RBC screening panel uses a gel card agglutination format and has been 
validated at the Blood Center of Wisconsin for this purpose. The primary RBC 
screen ing panel is composed of reagent RBCs from [ADDRESS_572106] been prepared as both INTERCEPT -treated 
and untreated RBCs. Each panel has three sets of RBCs made from the identical group O donors: untreated RBC; treated RBCs consisting of cells carrying a “high” level of S-
303 (amustaline) adducts (comparable to the INTERCEPT RBC s prepared with the 
“Original  process” and cells carrying a “low” level of S-303 ( amustaline) adducts 
(representative of  INTERCEPT RBCs prepared with the “C urrent  process ”. The 
primary screening panel is designed as a sensitive screening test for both common RBC alloantibodies and for INTERCEPT RBC -specific  antibodies. The secondary panel is 
designed to determine the specificity of any antibodies detected in the primary scr een 
and to distinguish common RBC alloantibodies from INTERCEPT RBC- specific 
antibodies. 
By [CONTACT_449125], much in the same way that homozygous donors are used to produce commercially prepared red cells, there is a 
greater potential for detecting low affinity or low titer (weak) antibodies. Thus, the 
panels have the capability to detect an antibody specific to INTERCEPT RBCs even in 
the presence of alloreacti vity from an intrinsic antigen.

CLI [ZIP_CODE], v8.[ADDRESS_572107] the screening panel(s) of reagent RBCs to 
identify an antibody specific to INTERCEPT RBC s. The gel card agglutination test 
results are scored (0, weak positive, 1+, 2+, 3+, 4+) and the reactivity is classified as follows:  
• If the antibody screening score is 0 for all the untreated and INTERCEPT RBCs 
on the primary RBC screening panel, the sample is considered “non- reactive” with 
no antibodies (neither an intrinsic alloantibody or INTERCEPT RBC- specific 
antibody) present in the patient’s serum and thus no requirement for antibody identification with the secondary antibody identification panel. Neither the secondary RBC screening panel nor additional tests are required. The patient 
continues to receive study RBC components according to the protocol. In addition, 
each unit of study RBC is crossmatched to the patient’s plasma using an antiglobulin (AHG) gel card test, providing a further level of protection to detect 
incompatibility, including that caused by [CONTACT_449126] -specific antibodies. 
• If the results of the primary RBC screening panel show concordant 3/3, 2/3, or 1/3 reactive with BOTH the INTERCEPT treated reagent RBCs and the corresponding Control untreated RBCs, the sample will be considered “presumed allo- reactive” 
antibody to an intrinsic red cell antigen. The sample is tested against the secondary 
RBC screening panel to identify and confirm the specificity of the allo -antibody 
producing the reaction according to standard blood banking rules (reactivity with 
three RBC cells bearing the RBC antigen, and non- reactivity with three RBC that 
lack the antigen). If the antibody that is causing the agglutination is identified and 
confirmed, then the sample is considered “allo- reactive” for that RBC alloantigen. 
In this setting, lack of reactivity with all (at least three) INTERCEPT treated RBC 
cells that lack the RBC alloantigen, will rule out INTERCEPT RBC  antibody 
specificity. The patient continues on study and will receive compatible (cross 
matched) study RBC components.  
• If INTERCEPT RBC -specific antibodies cannot be ruled out, or agglutination is 
visible for all the untreated RBC cells in the panel, (i. e., “pan -reactive”), the 
patient will be discontinued from the study transfusions and followed up at 
planned visits for safety until study completion.  
• If the primary RBC screening panel score is positive with 2/3 or 3/3 of the 
INTERCEPT RBCs carrying S-303 (amustaline)  adducts at either ‘high” and/or 
“low” level AND 0/3 with the corresponding Control untreated RBCs which lack 
S-303 adducts, the sample is classified as “reactive for -INTERCEPT RBC -
specific antibodies” and the sample will be sent to the cent ral testing lab for further 
characterization  of specificity .

secondary panel will also be tested . In this setting the secondary panel serves to 
increase the sensitivity fo r INTERCEPT RBC - specific antibodies by [CONTACT_6310] a 
larger number of INTERCEPT RBC cells. Negative reactivity to both repeat tests 
of the primary panel cell and negativity with the secondary panel will be 
considered a negative test. Reactivity in at least one of two repeat primary panel 
cells INTERCEPT RBC cells or any INTERCEPT RBC cell in the secondary 
panel without reactivity with the corresponding untreated RBC will be a considered positive test for INTERCEPT RBC  reactivity. The sample will be sent 
for ad ditional characterization at the Central immunohematology reference 
laboratory to include inhibition studies to determine specificity of observed reactivity. (see APPENDIX 2 for a Characterization plan for potential antibody to 
INTERCEPT RBCs - Addendum to the CLI [ZIP_CODE] Protocol).  
The above-mentioned Central Laboratory protocol will ensure that the minimum criteria

Note the distinction between the severity and the seriousness of an adverse event. A 
severe event is not necessarily a serious event. For example, a headache may be severe (interferes signi ficantly with patient's usual function) but would not be classified as 
serious unless it met one of the criteria for serious adverse events.  Consistency between severity and seriousness assessments should be ensured by [CONTACT_737].   
7.5.2 Assessing Seriou sness of an Adverse Event  
The Investigator will assess if an AE resulted in any one or more of the following 
outcomes that result in classification of the event as a n SAE: death, a life -threatening 
event (results in an immediate risk of death from the reac tion as it occurred), inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or another important medical event  (Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
7.5.3 Assessing Causality of an Adverse Event 
The Investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all adverse events 
(serious and non-serious). An I nvestigator’s causality assessment is the determination of 
whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an adverse event. If the Investigator does not know whether or not investigational product caused the event, then the event will be handled as “possibly 
related to investigational product” for reporting purposes.  
Adverse events assessed by [CONTACT_449129] (possible, likely/probable) to 
the investigational product also must be evaluated as a Transfusion Reaction and 
classified per the CDC NHSN Hemovigilance Protocol ( APPENDIX  3).

 STATISTICAL METHODS  
8.1.1 Efficacy Analysis 
For the
 primary efficacy endpoint, the treatment difference (Test – Control) and its two-
sided 95% confidence interval (CI) will be estimated from Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel 
(CMH) test stratified by [CONTACT_449096] (sCr ≥1.2 mg/dL vs. < 1.2 mg/dL) and cardiac 
surgery group (more at risk for renal complications vs. less at risk) performed. The upper bound of the two-sided 95% CI will be compared with the 50% of the observed Control rate. Non-inferiority will be achieved if the upper bound is less than the 50% of 
the observed Control rate.  For the non- inferiority test, the null and alternative 
hypotheses (H0 and H 1, respectively) will be formulated as follows: 
𝐻𝐻
0: 𝑃𝑃𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇−𝑃𝑃𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑇𝑇𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶≥50% ×𝑃𝑃�𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑇𝑇𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶     𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣 .    𝐻𝐻1: 𝑃𝑃𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇−𝑃𝑃𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑇𝑇𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶<50% ×𝑃𝑃�𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑇𝑇𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶,    
 
where
 𝑃𝑃𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 and 𝑃𝑃𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑇𝑇𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 are the event rates for Test (INTERCEPT) and Control groups, 
respectively, and  𝑃𝑃�𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑇𝑇𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 is the observed Control rate. 
Same C
MH test will be used for assessment of treatment differences for the secondary 
efficacy end points.  As a sensitivity analysis, logistic regression will be utilized to 
estimate the treatment differences after controlling for baseline sCr, cardiac surgery 
group performed and other covariates to be detailed in the statistical analysis plan 
(SAP).

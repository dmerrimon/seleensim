2016 -KM-004 v 1.1 October 3 , 2016  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 5 of 36 
 Session  A. The µ-Cor device and ZOE monitor will be applied during 
Session A.  
2. Patients will be randomly allocated to Study Arm  1 or Study Arm 2 , with 
randomization stratified by [CONTACT_775154] (CHF or non -CHF) . A 
randomization schedule will be provided to the clinical sites.  
3. Weight, blood pressure, and heart rate will be recorded before the 
dialysis session.  
4. During the  hemodialysis session , the patient will wear 1 µ -Cor device  
and will be connected simultaneously to 1 ZOE monitor  (via 2 ZOE 
electrodes)  for comparative measurements and UFV  correlation, from at 
least [ADDRESS_1064744]  15 minutes after 
the end of the dialysis session.  
5. The thoracic area of the patient will be cleaned and  treated per  the 
protocol procedures . The µ -Cor will b e placed  in accordance with 
instructions provided in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  
6. The ZOE electrodes will be placed according to the manufacturer's 
instructions for use (IFU) . 
7. The µ-Cor will record measurements during  the dialysis session, 
including at least  the 15  minutes before and 15 minutes after the session.  
8. ZOE ( Z0) values will be measured every 6 minutes  (± 1 minute ) during 
the dial ysis session . ZOE ( Z0) values also will be  measured  every 
3 minutes  (± 1 minute)  before and after the session , for a minimum of 
5 measurements .  
9. The UFV  during the course of hemodialysis will be measured by 
[CONTACT_775155] 6 minutes

Estimated 
Enrollment Period : Up to [ADDRESS_1064745] : One (1) day  
2016 -KM-004 v 1.1 October 3 , 2016  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 6 of 36 
 Proposed Study 
Duration:  Approximately 6 months  
Endpoints : The p rimary  endpoint is a c omparison of correlation s of thoracic impedance  
made with the -Cor System  and UFV , with those of the ZOE  and UFV . The 
non-inferiority assessment will be between each location (side and front)  of 
the -Cor System/UFV correlation to the  ZOE/UFV correlation . 
The secondary endpoints are:  
 Comparison of correlations of thoracic impedance made with the 
-Cor System and UFV, to those of the ZOE and UFV using all 
values from the -Cor System, regardless of location  
 Comparison of the precision of the ZOE and the -Cor System  
Statistical Methods : Since previous published studies have reported that bio impedance  
measurements have been more reliably used before  and after  the dialysis  
treatment ( 5) (6) (7), data from these time points  will be compared separately 
from data collected during dialysis.  In general, summaries will be provided 
for all study patients and by [CONTACT_30157]. 
Correlation between -Cor and UFV changes during the dialysis session will 
be summarized using average Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Correlation 
between ZOE and UFV changes will be summarized in the same manner. 
The non -inferiority assessment will be between each location (side and front) 
of the µ -Cor S ystem/UFV corre lation to the  ZOE/UFV correlation.  The 
µ-Cor System will be considered as substantially equivalent with respect to 
clinical performance of the ZOE monitor  if the correlation between the 
µ-Cor thoracic impedance measurements and UFV (r_ µ -Cor) is non -inferior 
to the correlation between ZOE bioimpedance  measurements and UFV 
(r_ ZOE). Non -inferior is defined as r_ µ -Cor within the range [(r_ ZOE - 
0.05), 0.9999].  
The precision of each device will be compared using a Mann Whitney test.

frequent recurrence of acute epi [INVESTIGATOR_1841]. Among these patients are those with congestive heart 
failure (CHF). Lung congestion is the leading cause of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_775141] ( 1). To date , there is no effective method for direct measurement and 
monitoring of l ung congestion, making physicians rely on non -specific, patient -dependent 
measurements such as a patient’s weight and blood pressure. A tool that provide s direct and 
accurate measurement of thoracic impedance  has the potential to shorten the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_775142]; it also may provide early edema detection in order to 
prevent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61715].  
Similarly, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing hemodialysis a lso require 
fluid management strategies. It has been documented that patients diagnosed with CKD 
undergoing maintenance hemodialysis have a high prevalence of heart failure (HF) and poor 
prognosis ( 2) (3). Congestive heart failure is a frequent clinical ma nifestation in patients 
undergoing dialysis (4). 
For these reason s, body fluid assessment is important for managing CKD and HF. Bioimpedance 
technology has remained underutilized due to the lack of noninvasive, ambulatory measurement 
devices. In this study , we will evaluate the performance of the µ-Cor System, a noninvasive, 
wearable monitoring system for accurately assessing thoracic impedance by [CONTACT_775157].  
Fluid changes evaluated with the  µ-Cor will be compared with tho se of an FDA -cleared fluid 
measurement device, the ZOE® Fluid Status Monitor ( Noninvasive  Medical Technologies)  to 
establish significant equivalence . Qualified healthcare practitioners currently use the ZOE  for 
monitoring patients who are living with fluid  management problems, taking diuretic medication, 
living with heart failure, living with end stage renal disease , or suffering from recurrent 
dehydration.

2 DEVICE DESCRIPTION  
The µ -Cor noninvasively monitors a patient’s clinical parameters ( thoracic impedance , ECG, 
heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], activity, and posture). Measurements are acquired via a patient -worn 
device and the raw data are  transmitted wirelessly to a remote server with dedicated software to 
process the raw data. The µ -Cor is designed for use in outpatient clinics and home settings.  
2.1 Device Components  
The components of the µ -Cor can be found in Table  2.

5.[ADDRESS_1064763]:  
1. During the  hemodialysis session (Session A) the patient will wear one µ-Cor device  on 
the side location, below the left armpit  (Study Arm 1 ) or one µ -Cor device  on the front 
location , upper left chest  (Study Arm 2 ) and [ADDRESS_1064764]  15 minutes after the end of the dialysis session.  
2016 -KM-004 v 1.1 October 3 , 2016  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 17 of 36 
 2. Patients will be randomly assigned to Study Arm 1 or Study Arm 2, with randomization 
stratified by [CONTACT_775154] (CHF or non -CHF) . A randomization schedule will be provided 
to the clinical sites.  
3. Patients should be positioned in their dialysis chair per standard of care.  
4. Preparation of the devices and patients  will be as follows:  
ZOE monitor  (model Z2 -100 and ZOE electrodes model Z2 -711):  
The p atient ’s skin where the electrodes have to be placed should be clean and dry; all hair 
should be removed  from the site where the electrodes will be placed to assure a good 
connectio n to the skin. The AC adapter is connected to the back of the ZOE, and the 
device plugged into an outlet (or insert batteries). Two new ZOE electrodes are to be 
snapped on the ZOE cable. Electrodes are to be place d on the skin: electrode 1 goes 
above the t op of the breastbone with the arrow tip pointing down; electrode 2 goes below 
the bottom of the breastbone with the arrow tip pointing up.  
After an information for user manual ( IFU)-required  5-minute  wait period to allow for 
the electrodes to seed,  measur ements can start  by [CONTACT_775159]. During the 
time of the readings, the patient  must remain still for about [ADDRESS_1064765] be recorded manually on a Z 0 Tracking log . 
An illustrated user manual will be provided to the site as a part of the site training for 
additional guidance.  
µ-Cor System :  
The patient’s  skin where the patch will be placed should be clean and dry; all hair should 
be trimmed  from the site where the patch will be placed to assure a good connection to 
the skin. T he charger (and gateway placed inside the charger ) is connected to an outlet 
using the power cord supplied by [CONTACT_633834] . When a green LED light appears  on the 
cartridge (not on charger) , it is an indication that the unit is ready for use. The cartridge is 
to be placed on the charger for  up to  60 minutes . The cart ridge is then removed from the 
charger  and placed on the adhesive patch: lower positioning tabs of the cartridge will go 
on the lower part of the adhesive patch; then the rest of the cartridge is pressed onto the 
patch. The cartridge should be firmly attac hed. The patch liner is to be peeled off and 
placed on the skin. The patch should be completely adhered to the skin. For Study Arm [ADDRESS_1064766] “Kyma” right side 
up, with the nipple aligned anywher e between the top and middle of the cartridge.  For 
Study Arm [ADDRESS_1064767] be removed 
from the adhesive patch by [CONTACT_775160] -in clip; then the cartridge should be 
tilted and removed from the patch. The cartridge should then be placed on the charger . 
In order to detach the adhesive patch from the skin, it is necessary to hold the skin with 
one hand while peeling off gently with the other hand. A wet wipe can be used to assist 
with this process. Patches must be discarded and cannot be reused.  
An illustrated IB will be provided to the site as par t of the site training for additional 
guidance  (Appendix C) 
5. Weight , blood pressure , and heart rate will be recorded before the hemo dialysis session.   
6. The -Cor will be programmed to record  measurements  every [ADDRESS_1064768] 15 minutes before and after the hemodialysis 
session. However, only every alternate -Cor recording taken during the dialysis session 
will be used for analysis ( ie, the reading taken every 6th minute). This will be done in 
order to syn chronize -Cor measurements with the ZOE (Z0) measurements that also will 
be recorded every 6  minutes  (±1 minute ) during the hemodialysis session  along with the 
UFV measurements.  
7. ZOE ( Z0) values will be measured every  3 minute s (± 1 minute)  before and after the 
hemodialysis session , for a minimum of 5 measurements  (synchronized with the -Cor

5.[ADDRESS_1064769] Withdrawal  
Participation in this clinical investigation is voluntary and patients  may withdraw at any time.  
In the event the patient chooses to withdra w, he/she will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_183365]. The patient  also may be terminated from the clinical investigation at any time if 
his/her primary physician and/or the Investigator consider it to be in his/her best medical interest. 
Withdrawal from the investigation will not affect patient ’s follow -up care. Patients  will be 
informed of any significant information regarding new findings that may develop during the 
course of the research study that may relate to his/her willingness to continue participation as a 
clinical investigation patient . 
Patients will either sati sfactorily complete all requirements set forth in the clinical investigation 
plan or their participation in the clinical investigation will be prematurely terminated. The 
completion of a patient’s participation in the clinical investigation or early depart ure from the 
clinical investigation must be fully documented in the patient’s progress notes as well as on the 
appropriate CRF.  
2016 -KM-004 v 1.1 October 3 , 2016  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 20 of 36 
 Should a patient choose to withdraw from the study, the reason(s) for withdrawal will be 
recorded on the appropriate CRF and in  the patient’s medical record.  
An Investigator may remove a patient from the study for the following reasons:  
 In the judgment of the Investigator, continuation in the study can adversely affect the 
safety of the patient  
 Subject non -compliance with the clinical investigational plan

clinical site will return all systems to ZOLL . 
5.8 Protocol Deviation  
A protocol deviation is defined as not adhe ring to the clinical investigation plan . Protocol 
deviations can be major or minor. A major deviation  is defined as an event that resulted in an 
increased risk to a patient  or others; affected the right s, safety , or welfare of a patient ; or affected 
the in tegrity of the clinical investigation. Major protocol deviations include (but are not limited 
to): failure to obtain informed consent prior to patient  enrol lment, an enrolled patient  did not 
meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria , or unauthorized use of the devices.  
Prior approval by [CONTACT_775162], 
contemplates, or makes a conscious decision to deviate. Prior approval is not expected in 
situations where unforeseen circumst ances are beyond the Investigator’s control ( eg, inadvertent 
errors, product failure, or inability to perform required procedures due to patient  illness).   
All major deviations will be documented on a Protocol Deviation CRF.  
6 RISK ANALYSIS  
ZOLL  has conduc ted an analysis of the benefits and risks of the μ -Cor System. ZOLL  has 
determined that this clinical investigation is justified as the overall potential benefit to the 
population outweighs its intended risks. This is a non -significant clinical study  (the non-
significant risk declaration is presented  in Appendix D). 
6.[ADDRESS_1064771] dermatitis, or breaching of the skin if the patch is 
removed too quickly. The μ -Cor System has not been tested for compatibility with magnetic 
resonance imag ing (MRI ) machines or external defibrillator s. Re-use of the patch may result in 
patient cross -contamination and inaccurate measurements.  
6.2.[ADDRESS_1064772] those procedures will 
participate in this study.   
7 ADVERSE EVENTS AND D EVICE DEFICIENCIES  
An adverse event  (AE) is any undesirable exper ience (sign, symptom, illness, or other medical 
event) occurring to a patient , whether or not associated with the investigational product or related 
procedures that is considered a change from baseline, or pre -study status during the course of the 
study.   
7.1 Adverse Event Reporting  
Adverse events  shall be assessed and documented and should include the following:  
 The time of onset of any new AE or worsening of a previously observed AE  
 A description of the event  
 The duration of the event (start and stop dates, or ongoing)  
 The severity of the event (mild/moderate/severe)  
 Assessment of the relation of the AE to the study device and index procedure  
 Description of action taken to treat the event  
 Event outcome  
Event severity will be categorized as follows:  
 Mild  - Easily tolerated by [CONTACT_102] , causing minimal discomfort and not interfering 
with everyday activities. These events generally do not require treatment.  
 Moderate  - Sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities. 
These events are us ually relieved by [CONTACT_14212].  
 Severe  - Prevents normal, everyday activities. These events may require systemic drug 
therapy or other medical treatment.  
The relationship between the AE, the study device , and the interventional procedure wil l be 
categorized as follows  
 None  - An AE for which sufficient information exists to indicate that the etiology is 
unrelated to the device; the AE is readily explained by [CONTACT_102]’s  clinical state or other 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].   
2016 -KM-004 v 1.1 October 3 , 2016  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 22 of 36 
  Possible  - The AE follows a known o r expected response pattern to the device, but could 
readily have been produced by a number of other factors.  
 Probable  - The AE follows a known or expected response pattern to the device.  
 Definite  - The AE follows a known or expected response pattern to the device and the 
physician confirms the relationship through further testing or evidence.  
Regardless of whether or not the AE is considered related to the device and/or interventional 
procedure, the AE mus t be reported on the appropriate AE CRF.  
7.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any adverse experience that result s in any of the 
following outcomes: death, a life -threatening adverse experience, in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_194636], a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, 
permanent impairment of a body function or perma nent damage to a body structure, or 
necessitated medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body 
function or permanent damage to a body structure.   
In the event of an SAE, the Sponsor should be notified within 24 hours after i dentification of an 
SAE, followed by a written summary submitted within 2 days.   
The Investigator will report all SAEs to the IRB according to local requirements.

7.[ADDRESS_1064773] (UADE)  
An Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (U ADE) is an AE related to the use of an 
investigational medical device, which  by [CONTACT_5942], incidence, severity or outcome has not been 
previously identified in the risk management files.  
In the event of an UADE, the Sponsor should be notified within [ADDRESS_1064774] to its identity, 
quality, durability, reliability, safety , or performance. Device deficiencies (also referred to as 
device performance issue s) also include malfunctions, use er rors, and inadequate labeling.   
All µ-Cor device deficiencies will be documented in the patient’s  medical record and on the 
appropriate CRF . 
8 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
8.1 Outcome Measures  
The p rimary  endpoint is the compar ison of correlation s of thoracic impedance made with the -
Cor System and UFV  with those of the ZOE  monitor  and UFV . The non -inferiority assessment 
will be between each location (side and front) of the -Cor System /UFV correlation and 
ZOE/UFV correlation.  
The secondary endpoints are:  
 Comparison of correlations of thoracic impedance made with the -Cor System 
and UFV with those of the ZOE and UFV using all values from the -Cor 
System, regardless of location  
 Comparison of the precision of the ZOE and the -Cor System

Figure 1: Primary Endpoint Assessment  
8.2 General Statistical Considerations  
A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be created by [CONTACT_775163] a designee, and will be finalized 
prior to database lock.  
For statistical analyses, d ata will be summarized by [CONTACT_775164].  
All tests of differences will be conduct ed at a [ADDRESS_1064775] deviation, minimum, and maximum. Categorical endpoints will be summarized 
using number of patients, frequency, and percentages.  
Additional explor atory analyses of the data will be conducted as deemed appropriate.  
8.3 Patient Disposition  
Patients  who complete the study and those who prematurely discontinue from the study, will be 
summarized overall  and by [CONTACT_30157]. In addition, for patients who prematurely discontinue 
from the study, the reasons for discontinuation will be summarized.  

2016 -KM-004 v 1.1 October 3 , 2016  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 25 of 36 
 8.4 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Descriptive summaries of demographic s and baseline characteristics will be presented for all 
patients and by [CONTACT_775165]. 
8.5 Analyses  
The primary efficacy analysis will be conducted on  all per -protocol enrolled patients that meet 
all selection criteria . Supportive analyses may be conducted on a subset of subjects, as defined in 
the statistical analysis plan.  
8.5.1 Comparison of Correlations  
The primary endpoint is the comparison of correlation s of thoracic impedance made with the µ-
Cor System and UFV  with those of the ZOE monitor and UFV. Correlation between -Cor and 
UFV changes during the dialysis session will be summarized using average Pearson’s correlation 
coefficient. Correlation between ZOE and UFV changes will be summarized in the same manner. 
The non -inferiority assessment will be between each location  (side and front) of the µ-Cor 
System/UFV  correlation and ZOE/UFV correlation. The µ-Cor System will be considered as 
substantially equivalent with respect to clinical performance of the ZOE monitor if the 
correlation between the µ-Cor thoracic impedance measurem ents and UFV (r_  µ-Cor) is non -
inferior to the correlation between ZOE bioimpedance measurements and UFV (r_ZOE). Non -
inferior is defined as r_  µ-Cor within the range [(r_ZOE – 0.05), 0.9999 ]. 
A similar, supporting comparison will be made using all values from the µ-Cor System, 
regardless of location. This comparison will be considered as a secondary comparison.  
8.5.[ADDRESS_1064776] will be employed to compare the precision of the Zoe and the µ -Cor. The 
precision of each device will be calculated, using values obtained before dialysis, as:  
Precision = standard  deviation  of measurements  before  dialysis
median  measurement  before  dialysis

[CONTACT_775173]. The data captured on the CRFs will be compared to 
supporting site documents, and includes  eligibility criteria, AEs, protocol deviations, device 
accountability, device performance , and all study objectives.   
In some instances, site monitoring may be performed remotely as long as key data provided on 
CRFs are properly monitored against source documents.  
If a clinical site is found to be out of compliance  with the CIP and regulations, it will be 
terminated from  the clinical investigation and shall be required to return all unused devices 
and/or associated clinical investigation materials and procedure manuals to ZOLL .   
9.3.5 Site Close -out 
Site closeout will be conducted at the completion of the clinical study. Durin g the close -out visit, 
ZOLL  or ZOLL ’s designee will ensure that all CRFs and data queries are signed , dated , and have 
been transmitted to ZOLL ; the device accountability log has been reconciled ; and any remaining 
study devices have been shipped back to ZOL L. Additionally, ZOLL  will review the 
Investigator’s ongoing study responsibilities, including reporting of any unexpected or device 
related AEs, submission of a final study report , notification of study close to the IRB , and the 
maintenance of study files  per regulations. In some instances, the site closeouts may be 
conducted via tele phone.  
10 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIO NS 
10.1 Conformance with Regulatory Standards  
The clinical investigation will be performed in accordance with ICH E6, the Declaration of 
Helsinki , and a pplicable local regulations. International Conference of Harmonization (ICH) and 
GCP will be used as guidance for the preparation and conduct of the clinical investigation.  
Prior to enrollment of the first patient , ZOLL  will notify the appropriate regulatory agencies and 
obtain approval as necessary to start the clinical investigation.  
10.1.[ADDRESS_1064782]  
Clinical investigations will not begin without documented approval of the clinical investigation  
by [CONTACT_775174] . Additional approvals (by [CONTACT_775175][INVESTIGATOR_307]/organizations ) may also be required.  The Investigator will submit and obtain approval 
for the clinical investigation from their IRB and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_350569] . Prior to submission to the 
IRB, ZOLL  must review and approve the site-specific  ICF. It is the responsibility of the 
Investigator to ensure that all aspects of the IRB and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_775146], maintained and renewed as necessary.  The Investigator will provide ZOLL  with a 
copy of all communication from the IRB and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_775147]/or approval of the CIP, and approval of the ICF prior to initiation of the clinical investigation. 
Amendments to the CIP and revisions to the ICF will be subject  to the same requirements. The 
[ADDRESS_1064783] their 
origins in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
Copi[INVESTIGATOR_775148]/or approvals must be maintained in the site regulatory b inder.  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to report any withdrawals of approval by [CONTACT_775176] 5 working days.  
10.1.2  Patient  Confidentiality  
Patient  confidentiality will be maintained throughout the study. For this purpose, a unique patient  
identification code (ID number and patient  name [CONTACT_104846]) will be used th at allows identification of 
all data reported for each patient .   
Data relating to the study might be made available to third parties (for example in case of an 
audit performed by [CONTACT_12721]) provided data are treated as confidential and that the 
patient’s privacy is guaranteed in accordance with HIPAA criter ia and/or other applicable 
requirements.    
10.1.3  Clinical Investigational Plan Compliance  
The Investigator will carefully review the procedures defined in the CIP and in the CRFs with 
his/her research staff prior to the time of site initiation to ensur e appropr iate interpretation and 
implementation. The Investigator should not plan to deviate from the CIP without obtaining prior 
consent from ZOLL . ZOLL  may approve minor protocol deviation on a case -by-case basis. All 
protocol deviations (from the CIP) will be re ported to ZOLL .   
Only ZOLL  is allowed to modify this CIP. Any changes to the CIP will originate from ZOLL  (in 
the form of an amendment) and must be re -submitted to each institution’s IRB and must be 
approved. Any modification that potentially affects patients’ rights or safety also must be 
approved by [CONTACT_775177]. In an emergency where action is necessary 
to protect the life or physical well -being of the patient , a deviation from the CIP for an individual 
patient  may be allowed on  a per -patient  basis. In such circumstances, the Investigator must notify 
their IRB and ZOLL  and must describe the conditions necessitating the deviation from the CIP 
and the outcome of the emergency intervention in a written report. ZOLL  will determine wh ether 
the patient  is to continue in the clinical investigation.  
10.1.4  Suspension or Termination of Clinical Study  
ZOLL  may suspend or prematurely terminate either a clinical investigation at an individual 
investigational site or the entire clinical investigation  for significant and documented reasons. An 
Investigator, IRB , or appropriate regulatory authority may suspend or prematurely terminate 
participation in a clinical investigation at the Investigational Site for which they are responsible.  
If suspension or p remature termination occurs : 
a) ZOLL  shall remain responsible for providing resources to fulfill the obligations 
from the CIP and existing agreements for following up the patients  enrolled in the 
clinical investigation, and  
b) The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_775149]/her investigational site, if appropriate.  
[ADDRESS_1064784] give notice of any emergency deviations and 
justification for the deviation to the study personnel responsible at ZOLL  and the IRB as quickly 
as possible after the emergency, and in any event, no later than 24 hours after the emergency .

ZOLL  will supply the investigational devices as well as the study -related supplies to the 
investigational site , as described in the clinical investigation procedures for this study. The 
investigational site may be allowed to store controlled inventory , when qualified.  
The Investigator or responsible designee will record the receipt and disposition of the μ -Cor 
System in the appropriate device log. ZOLL  will monitor these logs on an ongoing basis. At the  
end of the clinical investigation, the original logs will be returned to ZOLL  and a copy of the 
logs kept in the regulatory binder at the investigational site.  
The μ -Cor System is an investigational device and will be packaged with a label with the name 
[CONTACT_775180]. The device also will be labeled with 
the following:  
“CAUTION: Investigational device. Limited by [CONTACT_4496] (US) law to investigational use.”  
The Investigator should take adequate precautions, includ ing storage of the investigational study 
device (also referred to as investigational product), to prevent theft or diversion of the products 
into unauthorized channels of distribution. Should a product not be used, the Investigator will 
return or dispose o f the device per ZOLL ’s instructions.  All -Cor Systems, used or unused,

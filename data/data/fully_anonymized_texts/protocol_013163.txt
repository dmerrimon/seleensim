While a number of therapeutic options exist for patients with breast cancer (BC), breast tumor biology is 
heterogeneous and not all BCs respond to treatment.  Ide ntifying a marker pred icting  response could 
spare non -responders unnecessary side effects, cost, and time. A recent example in BC is 
bevacizumab, an expensive anti -angiogenic monoclonal antibody, for which the FDA revoked approval 
for patients with metastatic BC1.  While thi s targeted therapy may benefit some patients, no appropriate 
predictive marker has been identified in the drug development process1.  An ideal biologic marker 
would be easy to perform, reliable, low -cost and non -invasive.  A limitation of assessing tumo r-based 
markers in metastatic BC is the inability to procure tumor tissue at different treatment times.  To 
circumvent this issue, anti -cancer agents can be assessed pre -operatively, where women with newly 
diagnosed BC receive a study drug, alone or with ch emotherapy, between diagnostic breast biopsy and 
surgical resection. In addition, tumor changes can be directly compared to modulation of non -invasive 
markers, such as functio nal radiographs or blood , to identify a non -invasive marker  predicting  tumor 
response.  
 
We are conducting a neoadjuvant single -institution trial with the non -selective, inexpensive β –blocker 
propranolol alone and with chemotherapy in locally advanced BC.  β -blockade  regulate s angiogenesis 
in primary breast tumors2,3.  In these trials, we plan to evaluate treatment -related microvascular 
response via changes in breast Diffuse Optical Tomography (DOT) , a non -invasive, fast, safe, and 
inexpensive breast imaging  tool.  As the optical property contrast from endogenous chromophores 
(oxyhemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, water, and lipid) provides information on tissue vascularity, it  can 
monitor response to anti -angiogenic agents4.  DOT changes occur as early as [ADDRESS_99100] evaluated DOT response to anti -
angiogenic agents.   
 
Design : We are performing a phase II study investigating neoadjuvant propranolol alone , followed by 
[CONTACT_90001] (taxane, followed  by [CONTACT_90002]/cytoxan) in [ADDRESS_99101] cancer.  Once enrolled, patients will start propranolol in combination with 
weekly treatments of taxane therapy (+ every 3 week Herceptin  and every 3 week Pertuzumab , if 
HER2+) followed by  [CONTACT_90002]/cytoxan + propranolol. Patients will continue to take propranolol 
through the day before surgery  (last dose of propranolol: night before surgery) .  
 
Primary Endpoint :  
1. To assess the feasibility  of giving neoadjuvant propranolol alone and in combination with 
chemotherapy.  Our hypothesis is that it will be feasible for patients to take propranolol with 
chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting.

Secondary Endpoints:  
 
1. To evaluate deoxyhemoglobin reduction as a non -invasive, image -based biomark er of angiogenic 
response after 2 weeks  of neoadjuvant propranolol administration  in combination with paclitaxel , as 
measured by [CONTACT_63625].  These images will be compared to DOT collected for the ongoing prospective IRB -
AAAI0480 trial.  
 
 
2.  To explore the modul ation of DOT markers at 5 time-points with propranolol: a) baseline ,; b) before 
starting taxane week #3; c) before starting AC cycle #1; d)  before  starting AC cycle #2; and e) before 
surgery.  These images will be compared to DOT collected for the ongoing p rospective IRB -AAAI0480  
trial.   
 
3. To evaluate the association between changes in optical  images and markers of angiogenesis  [tumor 
(VEGF, CD31, CD105, microvessel density  and area ), serum (VEGF, V-cam, and PI[INVESTIGATOR_89985])], 
proliferation (tumor KI-67 levels),  and tumor macrophage infiltration (CD163 expression) compared to 
baseline levels.  
 
4.  To explore whether acute stress levels, as measured by [CONTACT_90003] - revised version (QSC -R23), associate with image - or 
blood -based biomarker changes after propranolol.   
 
5.  To assess the safety and tolerability of neoadjuvant propranolol along with chemotherapy  
A.Background:  
A.1. Angiogenesis in BC: A number of studies have demonstrated that  angiogenesis, the process of 
blood vessel formation, is essential in the role in the growth, progression and metastatic potential of BC 
cells11,12. The most  clinical experience with anti -angiogenic agents in BC has been with bevacizumab 
(Avastin), the humanized recombinant monoclonal antibody that specifically blocks the binding of 
vascular endothelial growth  factor (VEGF) to high -affinity receptors.  Three randomized con trol trials 
have demonstrated an  improvement in progression free -survival and response rates with the addition of 
bevacizumab to front-line chemotherapy13-15.  However, while significant, the improvement  in these 
outcomes in the AVADO14 and Ribbon -115trials has  not been clinically compelling, given the median 
progression -free survival of [ADDRESS_99102] Cancer: Anti -angiogenic Effects : There is emerging pre -clinical and 
observational data that neuro -endocrine signaling influences BC  metastatic potential.  Used to treat 
cardiovascular disease, β -blockade associates with a reduction in distant BC metastases in 
observational studies18-21. β-blocker use independently predicts metastatic risk (HR=0.43; p=0.031) and 
BC-specific mortality at 10 years (HR=0.29; p=0.007)19.   Compared to other anti -hyperte nsives, β -
blocker use significant reduces BC recurrence (p=0.026).  In a retrospective study of patients receiving 
neoadjuvant therapy, β -blocker use is an independent predictor of improved relapse free survival (HR: 
0.52; p=0.015), with a trend in overall  survival (HR 0.64; p=0.09)21.  In another study, BC -specific

agonist), terbutaline (β [ADDRESS_99103]), xamoterol (β [ADDRESS_99104]), or isoproterenol plus propranolol. Stained for 
CD31 and VEGF (IHC and ISH). Tumor VEGF protein levels (ELISA). Microvessel Density is higher in 
the isoproterenol and terbuta line groups than in controls or in the combination group.  
 
mortality is significantly lower for propranolol users (median: 80 mg daily) as compared to nonusers 
(HR: 0.19)22. Non -BC mortality is similar. No effect is seen with atenolol (β1 antagonist) , suggesting that 
the β2 adrenergic receptor is the likely mediator.  These studies provide evidence that propranolol 
should be evaluated prospectively.  
 
There is strong pre -clinical data in accordance with  these observations, suggesting that β -blockers offer 
this advantage in BC by [CONTACT_90004]2,3.  Activation of cellular β -
adrenergic receptors by [CONTACT_90005][INVESTIGATOR_89986] n, regulating tumor cell 
prolif eration23 and apoptosis inhibition24. Norepi[INVESTIGATOR_89987] -MB-468 (triple negative: TN) BC cells23.   This effect is completely inhibited by β2 -specific 
blockade and only partially reduced by [CONTACT_941] β1 -specific blocker atenolol.  The functionality of the β -
adrenergic receptor is also observed in CG -5 BC (ER+) cells25.  In BALB/c mice syngeneic to 66cl4 BC 
cells (TN), the β -agonist isoproterenol increases distant metastasis by 22 -fold vs. control (p=0.03), and 
the β -blocker propranolol completel y blocks stress -enhanced metastasis (p<0.0001). While primary BC 
size does not change with propranolol, propranolol largely abrogates primary tumor macrophage 
infiltration (F4/80+), as well as stress -induced vascularization of primary mammary tumors (CD31)  (p 
<0.001). In SKOV3ip1 ovarian and MDA -MB-231 (TN) BC orthotropic models, less visceral metastases 
are seen in mice treated with propranolol (0%) vs. placebo (50%) (p = 0.01)3.  While the β -agonist 
isoproterenol and β2 -agonist terbutaline increase tumor weight and metastatic number, the β1 agonist 
xamoterol does not  (Figure 1 ), which, similar to observational data3, implicates  the role of β2. In 
SKOV3ip1 cells, VEGF mRNA expression increases by 842% after norepi[INVESTIGATOR_89988] 1,240%. This effect is blocked by [CONTACT_90006].  This supports the evaluating 
propranolol as an angiogenic modulator in BC.  β-adrenergic receptor functionality is observed in ER+25 
and HER2+ cells26.  Given these consistent findings, we plan to investigate propranolol in a 
prospective, translational clinical trial . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A.3. Diffuse Optical Tomograp hy (DOT) as a n Image -based  Marker of Tumor Angiogenic 
Response:  As DOT provides information on tissue vascularity, it can monitor response to anti -
angiogenic agents4. DOT utilizes optical t ransmission measurements with low -intensity light (i.e. non -
ionizing radiation) to provide [ADDRESS_99105] from endogenous chromophores [oxyhemoglobin (Hb02), deoxyhemoglobin (Hb), water, and

Baseline vs. 2 weeks of Paclitaxel in Patient #1 (A1) and Patient #2 (B1)  
 lipid] can distinguish malignant from normal tissue4,27. Total hemoglobin levels, which directly relate to 
blood vessel density in tumors, are double those in benign breast lesions28. Vascular changes precede 
measurable structural changes in  mouse models29. A limited number of small series (n=7 -16 patients) 
report DOT changes in patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy5,7-10.  None incorporate targeted 
therapy beyond trastuzumab.  Total hemoglobin levels significantly decreases with pathologic complete 
response (p=0.001)5,10.  Changes occur as early as 1 week after starting pre -operative chemotherap y, 
with tumor Hb levels droppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 33% +/ -7% in responders vs. non -responders (18% +/ - 10%: z=0.008)5.  
In addition, pre -treatment total hemoglobin levels correla te with pre -treatment mean vessel density of 
CD105 -expressing vessels, a neoangiogenesis marker (p <0.001)9. We will evaluate DOT as an early 
marker of angio genic response in this neoadjuvant  trial with propranolol.  
 
In an ongoing pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] (IRB -AAAD7133), [ADDRESS_99106] 29 patients, there is a significant difference between 
deoxyhemoglobin levels in BC -bearing vs. healthy (p=0.017).  The current data suggests a sensitivity of 
91% and a specificity of 83%.  In our ongoing s tudy of 20 women receiving neoadjuvant taxane  
followed by [CONTACT_90007] (IRB -AAAI0480), we are  assessing the percentage change  in DOT 
parameters and pCR.  This study has enrolled 15 patients  (open: 8/2011). Figure [ADDRESS_99107] 4 patients, the mean 
Hb02 and Hb decrease is 70% and 50%, respectively.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
B. Study Design  
 
B.1. Overview:  We propose a phase II study investigatin g the impact of neoadjuvant propranolol alone 
and in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy (taxane, followed by [CONTACT_90002]/cytoxan).  Once 
enrolled, patients will start propranolol 20 mg po bid, ultimately increa sing the dose of propranolol up to 
a maxim um 80 mg po daily ER  if tolerating propranolol ( Section F.2 for details) , when receiving  12 
weeks of taxane therapy + propranolol (+ Herceptin  and Pertuzumab , if HER2+) followed by 
[CONTACT_90002]/cytoxan + propranol ol (Figure 3).  This dose of propranolol has been chosen as it i s the 
median propranolol dose in the Barro n study, in which propranolol i s associated with reduced breast 
cancer progression and mortality22.  We chose to start with a lower dose at initiation to make sure that 
patients are tolerating the dose, prior to titrating up.  This was discussed with  cardiologists at CUMC 
and agreed to be the safest approach.  
 
B.2. Intervention:  We will also be evaluating changes in tumor -, image - and blood - biomarkers.  The 
main inclusion criteria will be English or Spanish speaking women over the age of [ADDRESS_99108] a tumor size ≥ 1 cm by [CONTACT_90008]-week

and cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2 )(AC) given every 2 weeks with growth -factor support  (i.e. 
neulasta) .  Full details are in Section D .6.Paclitaxel is administered as an IV infusion over 1 hour.  
Adriamycin is given by [CONTACT_90009] 5 -10 minutes. Cyclophosphamide is given by [CONTACT_90010] 30 -60 minutes.  The day following chemotherapy, the patient will receive neulasta, which 
stimulates the production of white blood cells and reduces the likelihood of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a low white 
blood cell count and fever after chemotherapy. It will be given as an injection under the skin on the day 
after each AC.  Neulasta may cause bone or joint pain and reactions at the injection sites.   Prior to 
each infusion of paclitaxel, patients are administered diphenhydramine, dexamethasone, and an H2 
block er.  Prior to each infusion of AC, patients are administered dexamethasone and outpatient anti -
emetics . 
 
If paclitaxel is not available secondary to drug supply issues, weekly nab -paclitaxel (abraxane) can be 
substituted at a dose of 100 mg/m2.  The first cycle of AC should start no more than [ADDRESS_99109] taxane dose unless the physician deems a longer break necessary.  Subjects will be recruited from 
CUMC.  
 
B.3. Measures : In addition to DOT , we will collect tumor tissue and blood for changes in a ngiogenesis, 
macrophage infiltration, proliferation, and adrenergic signaling.  For angiogenesis, we will explore 
modulation of tumor  angiogenesis: CD31 (IHC: Dako), CD 105 (Vector labs), mean vessel density and 
area as described9.  Serum VEGF, V-CAM levels , and PI[INVESTIGATOR_12252]  (ELISA) will be assessed in the Irving 
Institute for Clinical and Translational Research Biuomarkers Core.   For tumor macrophage infiltration, 
we will investigate tumor expression of CD163 by [CONTACT_9064] , as previously described30.  If 
there is an issue with this signal, we will consider CD68 ( PGM-1).  T umor proliferation will be assessed 
by [CONTACT_9064], (Ki -67: Dako) In addition to serum norepi[INVESTIGATOR_89989] , we will assess serum IL -6, since this cytokine is implicated in tumor progression 
and metast asis and increases with β -adrenergic receptor activation (all: Columbia Biomarker Core: 
ELISA)31.Because stressed animals demonstrate the most significant benefit to propranolol in pre -
clinical models, we plan to explore measures of stress and their association with other biomarker 
changes.  This will be measured at a) baseline, b) prior to week # 3 taxane, c) prior to cycle #1 AC, and 
d) before surgery.  We will also explore responses to the Q uestionnaire on Stress in Cancer Patients 
revised version (QSC -R23),  a disease -specific questionnaire to assess psychosocial stress in cancer 
patients32.  This questionnaire, which is grouped into 5 five homogeneous scale ( psychosomatic 
complaints, fears, information deficits, everyday life restrictions and social strains ), has been m easured 
at serial time periods (regardless of menopausal status)33.  Future tissue marker considerations will be 
rt-pcr on FFPE for pro -metastatic gene expression  [candidates including COX2 ( PTGS2), MMP9, 
ARG1, TGFB, VEGF, alpha2 integrin, gelsolin, Vcam1, Csf1]2.

C. Statistical Analysis  
 
C.1: Primary Endpoint:  We will evaluate the feasibility of neoadjuvant propranolol, along with cytotoxic 
chemotherapy.  The combination will be deemed feasible if at least 75% of patients (15 patients) are 
compliant with taking > 80% take the drug on a daily  basis as prescribed (nonadherence/medication 
possession ratio < 20%)34.This rate is higher than the 52% compliance rate, defined by [CONTACT_90011], in oth er series with oral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_89990]35.

Protocol dated 03/03/2014  C.2: Secondary  Endpoints:  We will evaluate the modulation of DOT deox yhemoglobin  measurements  
between the baseline and 2 weeks after propranolol plus paclitaxel .  Assuming different correlation 
levels (0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0 .6,0.7,0.8 and 0.9) between the baseline and [ADDRESS_99110] over 95% power to detect a difference of 0.39 (from 10.[ZIP_CODE]/+ -0.5455374 to  10.[ZIP_CODE]/+ -
0.2017752) at 5% significance level using paired t -tests.  These statistical considerations are based on 
recently reviewed data in patients with repeated DOT measures.  
We will use the Spearman rank correlation coefficient to analyze relationships between angiogenic 
markers, tumor proliferation, and adrenergic signaling.  The Wilcoxon signed -rank (mat ched -pairs) test 
will be used to compare expression levels between matched pre -and post -samples treated with 
propranolol alone. We will explore modulation of biomarkers collected at  different time periods ( Table 
1).  SAS Version 9.[ADDRESS_99111] , as we treat 
4-6 patients/month with neoadjuvant chemotherapy at Columbia. We expect half to enroll in this study.  
We plan to compare this data to the 20 patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (ongoi ng - no 
propranolol: IRB -AAAI0480) as a non -randomized concurrent control.   
 
We will evaluate the safety and tolerability of propranolol plus chemotherapy.  The addition of 
propranolol to taxane therapy does not significantly alter biologic response, as m easured by [CONTACT_90012]36.  In the literature, there is various reporting on the cardiac safety of propranolol with 
adriamycin, ranging from protective37-[ADDRESS_99112] 
cancer adjuvant setting to determine if β -blockers reduce the risk of cardiomyopathy, including those 
receiving trastuzumab43.  In this trial, we plan to closely monitor side effects, pe r the CTCAE v 4.0, as 
well as closely monitoring for cardiac dysfunction with echocardiogram or MUGA  (Table 1 ).   
 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10020]:  We will stop the trial if 20% of the patients (i.e. 4/20) need to be removed from the 
study due to toxicities.  
 
D. Study Proce dure  
 
D.1. Anthropometric Measures:  Upon or prior to enrollment, each study participant will have a 
targeted physical exam: height, weight, blood pressure, pulse, and breast exam including bra cup size 
as reported by [CONTACT_102].  Measurement of the breast  tumor size will be documented using 
standardized calipers in metric notation with the patient lying in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_89991] (or in the same position on all subsequent exams).   
 
D.2. Imaging : During the basel ine visit, each participant will undergo static and dynamic DOT 
evaluation of their tumor for determination of oxyhemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, water, and fat content 
in the affected breast.  Static and dynamic DOT readings will be obtained at 5 time points : at baseline, 
before starting taxane week #3, before starting AC cycle #1, before starting AC cycle #2, and before 
surgery.  During treatment, patients will be followed every two weeks with clinic visits and breast exam 
measuring tumor size with calipers . 
 
D.3. Tissue -Based Biomarker Collection : For patients that provide consent at the time of enrollment, 
there is an optional breast biopsy for research purposes only. This biopsy will be a core needle biopsy 
of the known breast mass. The procedure will be p erformed by a member of the study team, surgical 
unit or radiology unit at CUMC. Breast core biopsy is optional prior to the third week of taxane therapy . 
A core biopsy gun will be used and four to six passes will be made to obtain tissue from the mass. 
Tissue will be placed in cold formalin prior to paraffin embedding and processing. Once the tissue is 
processed, it will be reviewed by [CONTACT_90013].   
  
Page 7 
Protocol dated 03/03/2014  D.4. Blood -Based Biomarker collection:  We plan to collect blood at [ADDRESS_99113] tube, one 3 ml green -top tube, and one 7 ml EDTA tube.  We 
plan on evaluating plasma norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238].  Blood will be collected and stored at -80.  We will evaluate 
the blood in collabora tion with Serge Cremers (CTSA).  Currently , we plan on evaluating 
norep inephrine (plasma: HPLC/ECD), epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] ( plasma: LCMSMS), and  IL-6 (plasma: ELISA).  We 
will consider future evaluation of other blood markers, such as CRP (serum: turbidimetric)   
 
D.5. Safety : Safety will be monitored with toxicity interviews performed every 2 weeks while a patient is 
on study (except if a patient has a 3 -week delay between taxane the rapy and AC, per the investigator’s 
discretion).  Steps should be taken as per Table s2-6.   
 
D.6. Toxicity Monitoring : All unresolv ed adverse events greater than g rade [ADDRESS_99114] -
treatment follow -up.  The purpose of the diary is to document that the patient appropriately takes 
propranolol and ensure an accurate toxicity assessment. Toxicities will be graded per CTCAE v.  4.0.  
The study will be monitored by [CONTACT_90014].  
 
D.7. Treatment Plan  
Agent Administration and Study Design  
Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. No investigational or commercial agents or 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_89992] y be administered with the intent to treat the patient's 
malignancy.  
 
Propranolol .  
Each dose of propranolol should taken within 30 minutes of food.  The dosing of propranolol is 
described in  Section F.  
 
Paclitaxel: 80 mg/m2 IV infusion over 60 min (or inst itutional guidelines)  weekly x 12 consecutive 
weeks. Paclitaxel premedication: administer dexamethasone [ADDRESS_99115] dose of paclitaxel only; or [ADDRESS_99116] dose , administer dexamethasone 6 -10 mg IV (or lower doses if 
the taxane is well tolerated without reaction), diphenhydramine 25 -50 mg IV, and an H2 blocker 
(cimetidine 300 mg, ranitidine 20 mg, or an equivalent) approximat ely 30 -60 minutes prior to each 
subsequent paclitaxel dose.  
 
Nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane):  In the event paclitaxel is not available due to manufacturing and supply  
shortages, nab -paclitaxel will be substituted for paclitaxel. The dose is 100 mg/m2 IV infusion  over 30 
minutes weekly (or institutional standard). No premedications are given with nab -paclitaxel.  
 
Trastuzumab (only if HER2 -positve ): 8 mg/kg IV loading dose over 90 minutes, then 6 mg/kg weekly 
over 30 -60 minutes x 3 doses ( covering 12 weeks,  includi ng loading dose). To be administered after 
paclitaxel.  
 
Pertuzumab (only if HER2 -positive): 840 mg IV loading dose over 60 minutes, then 420 mg every 3 
weeks x 3 doses ( covering 12 weeks,  including loading dose ).  To be administered before paclitaxel.  
 
Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G -CSF; filgrastim):  G-CSF should not be used during 
paclitaxel +/ - trastuzumab /pertuzumab  unless: (1) treatment with paclitaxel is delayed due to 
neutropenia, (2) the patient has a serious or life -threatening documented  or suspected infection 
associated with neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC]< 1000/mm3), or (3) or another 
complication that in the judgment of the treating physician could derive potential benefit from G -CSF. 
The drug should be used at a dose/sche dule specified in the package insert. Pegfilgrastim should not 
Page 8 
Protocol dated 03/03/2014  be used.  
 
Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide : Doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 IV over 5 -10 minutes, 
Cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 IV infusion over [ADDRESS_99117] paclitaxel and/or trastuzumab /pertuzumab  dose.  
 
Premedication: Administer antiemetic therapy including a [ADDRESS_99118] and dexamethasone (12 
mg) IVSS 30 -60 minutes before AC chemotherapy plus aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053] (125 mg PO before AC) in 
accorda nce with NCCN guidelines ( www.nccn.org ); dexamethasone (8 mg BID) and aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053] (80 mg 
QD) is recommended on days 2 -3 to reduce delayed emesis.  
 
Pegfilgrastim 6 mg SC on day 2 of each cycle of AC.

F.  Dose Adjustment secondary to Toxicit y 
Dose modifications will be made using the sch ema outlined in Tables 2 -6. 
 
 
F.1. Propranolol Dose Modifications   
The initial dose level of propranolol and chemotherapy is detailed in Table 4.  
 
Table 2: Propranol ol + Chemotherapy   
Dose Level  Propranolol Do se Reduced Dose  
4 (Maximum 
dose) 80 mg ER po daily  60 mg po daily (in divided dosing)

1 20 m g po daily (in divided dosing)  Off-study  
 
 
A) “Cardiac” toxicities  
 
Grade I  
 
 The patient will start at 40 mg po daily upon starting chemotherapy ( Table 2: dose level 
2). 
 
 Every 2 weeks, the patient can be re -assessed and, if the patient i s tolerating thi s dose 
(i.e. with no grade I “cardiac toxicities”), the dose can be increased by 1 dose level, with 
a max of 80 mg po ER daily  (Table 2: dose level 4 ).   
 
 If the patient experiences grade I “cardiac” toxicity,  the dose will be held at that level for 2 
week s.  If, after 2 weeks, this “cardiac” toxicity has resolved, the dose can be up -titrated, 
per physician discretion.  
 
Grade II or higher:  
 
 If grade II or higher “cardiac toxicities” occur at any point during the study, the patient will 
be removed from the study.  
 
 
B) “Non -cardiac” toxicities  
 
Grade I or lower  
 
 The patient can be re -assessed every 2 weeks and, if the patient is tolerating this dose 
(i.e.no propranolol -related toxicities exceeding grade I) , the dose can be increased to up 
to 80 mg ER po daily  (Table 3 ).   
 
Grade II or higher  
Page 12 
Protocol dated 03/03/2014   If grade  II toxicity occurs , no change in dose is required, per physician discretion.  
 
 If grade III or IV toxicity and thought to be related to propranolol, reduce by 1 dose level.  
This to xicity should be monitored every 2 weeks, with a dose reduction by 1 dose level 
every 2 weeks until <grade II.  
 
 Every 2 weeks, the patient can be re -assessed.  If all “non -cardiac” toxicities thought to 
be related to propranolol  are reduced to < grade I, the dose can be increased by [CONTACT_23615] , per physician discretion .  The maximum dose is 80 mg ER po daily.   
 
Table  3: Dose Modification  for Propranolol based upon Toxicity Grade  
Toxicity 
Grade  “Cardiac”  “Non -cardiac”  
I No change in dose while grade I;  
If resolved after 2 weeks  (i.e. g rade 
0), the dose can be increased by 1 
dose level (max: 80 mg daily)  Dose can be increased by 1 dose 
level every 2 weeks (max: 80 mg 
daily)  
 
II Off-study  No change in dose required; Upon 
toxicity reduction to < grade I, can 
increase by 1 dose level ever y 2 
weeks (max: 80 mg daily)  
III Off-study  Reduce dose by 1 level every 2 
weeks until < grade II; Upon 
reduction to < grade I, can increase 
by 1 dose level every 2 weeks (max: 
80 mg daily)  
IV Off-study  Same as grade III  
 
F.2. Chemotherapy Dose Modificat ions  
Patients remain at starting dose ( Table 4: 3b), unless a dose reduction is required for the following 
toxicities below.  Each dose reduction is defi ned as one dose level reduction  (Table 4): 
 
 Grade III or IV  febrile neutropenia (fever > 38.5 C and ANC  < 1,000/mm3) between 
courses.   Filgrastim may also be used with weekly paclitaxel  
 Platelet nadir < 50,000  
 Grade III or IV  neuropathy (hold paclitaxel until < grade 2 neuropathy, reduce paclitaxel 
dose one dose level, keep propranolol dose stable)   
 Patie nts with g rade III or IV  non-hematologic toxicity (excluding neuropathy and 
“cardiac”). NOTE:  For patients with overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_50685] (i.e. possibly related to 
propranolol and chemotherapy, such as fatigue or dizziness), the timing, nature, and 
degree of toxicity must be considered.  Patients may have modification of propranolol 
alone, c hemotherapy alone, or both  depending upon these factors, per physician 
discretion.  
 
Patients who require a > 4 week delay in therapy due to to xicity should be removed from the 
protocol.

F.3.  QTc Prolongatio n and Echo cardiogram (Echo) /MUGA assessment  
ECGs and Echo/MUGA will be conducted throughout the trial.   
  
 ECGs  
 QTc toxicities  should follow the CTCAE v. 4 (“Investigations”).  If > grade II  toxicities are 
seen (i.e. QTc > 480  msec ), the dose of propranol ol will be decreased by 1 dose level, 
with a repeat ECG  4 weeks later.   
 
 If the repeat ECG  demonstrates >grade II  toxicity , the dose will be decreased by [CONTACT_90015], with a repeat ECG  4 weeks later – until this toxicity is noted to be 
<grade  I.   
 
 Once a stable dose is reached, it is per the discretion of the investigator, whether the 
propranolol dose will be up -titrated.  If up -titrated, the ECG  should be repeated within 4 
weeks.  
 
 Echo/MUGA  
 If an echo demonstrates an asy mptomatic decrease o f ejection fraction to less than 50% 
or a decrease more than 15%  from baseline, this test sho uld be re -evaluated  with 
MUGA.   
 
 If similar results are seen on MUGA, propranolo l should be held for 4 weeks, after  which 
time the echo and/or MUGA can be repeate d.  If the cardiac imaging demonstrates 
resolution of this issue (i.e. ejection fraction > 50% an d the decrease of > 15% from 
baseline  is no longer present ), propranolol can be resumed at 1 dose level lower, per the 
discretion of the investigator, and rema in at this dose.   If the ejection fraction does not 
recover to >50% or to <15% of baseline, propranolol should not be resumed.  The 
ejection fraction must be > 50% prior to initiating adriamycin/cytoxan.  
 
 If propranolol  is resumed , the cardiac ima ging shou ld be repeated within 8  weeks to 
demonstrate stability.  At this point, propranolol should not be up -titrated further.

H. Medical Device  
DOT:  
For this study we will use an optical imaging system developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Andreas Hielsch er's 
Biophotonics and Optical Radiology Lab at Columbia University. This device is used for investigational 
purposes only. A similar device has previously been used for clinical studies on approximately 70 
subjects at the State University of [LOCATION_001] Downs tate Medical Center (SUNYDMC), Brooklyn, NY. 
Page 14 
Protocol dated 03/03/[ADDRESS_99124], limbs, human heads, and finger joints. 
These studies were appr oved by [CONTACT_90016] (current protocol IRB -AAAB0510), respectively. The light intensities and exposure times are 
within required limits as set by [CONTACT_90017] (ANSI) and recomm ended by 
[CONTACT_90018] & Health Administration (OSHA) of the US Department of Labor. 
According to these standards (see ANSI Z136.[ZIP_CODE], page 48, Table 7, entry for Visible and Near -
Infrared light) the maximum permissible exposure (MPE) before  any tissue damage occurs is given by 
[CONTACT_90019] = 200x10^[0.002(x700)] mW/cm^2, where x is the wavelength of the light. For example, at x = 800 
nm the MPE = 316 mW/cm^2, which is at least [ADDRESS_99125]’s breasts into a 
measur ement head containing 96 optical fibers.  During the optical measurements, light from four laser 
diodes (wavelengths  765 - 905nm, with light intensity comparable to that emitted by a conventional 
light bulb) will be sequentially coupled into [ADDRESS_99126]’s optical properties from which values for water, oxyhemoglobin, 
deoxyhemoglobin and fat concentrations can be determined.  Levels of each component will be 
quantified by [CONTACT_20683] a region of interest (the area surrounding the highest  concentration) and 
calculating the mean concentration for that region.  Dynamic measurement of DOT will be made during 
a [ADDRESS_99127] in the i maging head, setting up and conducting the measurements 
takes about 30 minutes and produces minimal discomfort.

Detailed Title A Phase IIB, randomised, observer -blind, placebo -controlled, 
multi-centre study  to evaluate the effi cacy, safet y, reactogenicity  
and immunogenicit y of the [COMPANY_004] Biologicals’ investigational 
vaccine [COMPANY_004]3277511A when administered intramuscu larly 
according to a 0, 2 month schedule in COPD patients aged 40 to 
80 years with a previous history  of acute exacerbat ion 
(AECOPD).
Indication Active immunisation for the reduction of frequency of moderate 
and severe acute exacerbations of COPD in patients with a 
previous history  of AECOPD.
Rationale for the 
study and study 
designRationale for the stud y
The purpose of this Phase IIB proof -of-concept (POC) study in 
moderate to very  severe COPD patients (i.e. GOLD grade 2, 3 
and 4) aged 40 to 80 y ears with a history  ofmoderate or severe
AECOPD in the previous 12 months is to evaluate whether the 
NTHi -Mcat vacc ine can reduce the frequency  of AECOPD in 
this population and to assess the vaccine’s safet y, reactogenicity 
and immunogenicit y.
Several formulations of a vaccine containing the NTHi antigens 
(10 or 30 µg) either non -adjuvanted or combined with different 
adjuvants (aluminium [Al], adjuvant sy stem [AS]01 Eand 
AS04 C) were alread y evaluated in two previous Phase I clinical 
trials (NTHI -002 in healthy  adults aged 18 - 40 years and NTHI -
003 in current and former health y smokers of 50 -70 years old). 
The investigational vaccines were well -tolerated, with an 
acceptable saf ety and reactogenicity profile. These studies 
allowed the dose selection of the NTHi antigens (10 µg) and the 
adjuvant sy stem (AS01 E) currentl y evaluated for the first time in 
moderate and severe COPD patients aged 45 -81 years in the
Phase II stud y NTHI -004.
The safet y, reactogenicity and immunogenicit y of different 
formulations of the NTHi- Mcat investigational vaccine ha ve 
been evaluated in the Phase I study  in healthy  adults aged 19 -
40 years and in current and former smokers aged 50 -70 years 
(study  NTHI MCAT -001). Based on results obtained up to [ADDRESS_1025373] of care tosubjects in the
respective stud y groups.

27-MAR -2019 10Rationale for the stud y design
In the current study , moderate, severe and very  sever e COPD 
patients (i.e. GOLD grade 2, 3 and 4) with a history of AECOPD 
will receive 2 doses of the NTHi-Mcat investigational vaccine or 
placebo intramuscularl y (IM) according to a 0, [ADDRESS_1025374] at pre -
defined timepoints. 
In addition to the scheduled study  visits, ad hoc AECOPD -
driven study  visit(s) and/ or phone contact(s) wil l take place for 
each AECOPD occurring from first vaccination up to study  
conclusion:
An AECOPD visit will be scheduled as soon as 
possible after the onset of the AECOPD sy mptoms 
(maximum 96 hours after the onset of the s ymptoms). 
Follow -up visit(s) and/or phone call(s) will take place 
to determine the end of the AECOPD.
Rationale for the use of placebo
There is currently no established vaccine with recognised 
efficacy  in reducing the frequency  of AECOPD. Placebo (PBS) 
will therefore be used as a control.
Objectives Primary
To assess efficacy  of the investigational vaccine as 
compared to the placebo control with respect to the rate of 
moderate and severe AECOPDs.
Secondary
To describe the safet y and reactogenicity  of the 
investigational vaccine.
To assess efficacy  of the investigational vaccine as 
compared to the placebo control with respect to the rate of 
all AECOPDs and by  [CONTACT_926]  (i.e. mild, moderate or 
severe).

1.1. Background
1.1.1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary  disease and acute exacerbations
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary  Disease (COPD), a common preventable and treatable 
disease, is characterised by  [CONTACT_749949] m. The classification of COPD severity  is done based on the patient’s spi[INVESTIGATOR_749883] [ GOL D, 2013]. The airflow limitation in COPD pati ents can 
be classified into Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive L ung Disease (GOLD) grades 
as shown in Figure 1[GOLD , 2017]. 
Additional parameters can be collected in order to allow for a combined assessment that 
could be used for future evaluation ( Figure 1) [ GOLD , 2017].

COPD = Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease; GOLD = Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease;

Number of exacerbatio nsper year, number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8800] y ear and CAT score 
will be collected at the enrollment in order to allow for the classification according to the

* Note: in this study , the mMRC scaling will not be used to classify  patients in different 
COPD categories. 
The airflow limitation is associated with an enhanced chronic inflammatory  response in 
the airway s and lungs to noxious particles of gases. The most important environmental 
risk factor for COPD is tobacco smoking, even t hough other factors, such as occupational 
exposure, may  also contribute to the development of the disease [ GOLD, 2017]. I t is a 
multi-
component disease with se veral contributory mechanisms, including airway  
inflammation, airway  obstruction, mucociliary  dysfunction and structural changes to the 
airway s [American Thoracic Societ y and European Respi[INVESTIGATOR_21584] y, 2004; GOLD, 
2017]. Together, these mechanisms manifest as an accelerated decline in lung fun ction, 
with sy mptoms such as breathlessness on phy sical exertion, deteriorating health status 
and exacerbations.
In 2015, COPD ranked third among the global age-standardised death rates for both 
sexes, with about 3. 2 million patients dy ing of the disease [Wang , 2016]. The morbidity  
and mortality  of COPD is substantially  contributed to acute exacerbation of COPD 
(AECOPD), which are events during which the patient’s respi[INVESTIGATOR_749886] -to-day variations and which require a change in maintenance 
treatment. Higher exacerbation rates have been related to a faster decline in lung function 
and are known to have a negative effect on the patient’s quali ty of life. Moreover, 
frequent exacerbations are associated with significant mortality , particularly  if they  
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Between 40 -60% of medical expenditure for COPD is a direct 
consequence of AECOPD  Cazzola , 2008 . 
Acute exacerbations and comorbidities contribute to the overall disease severity  in 
individual COPD patients. An acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) is defined as an 
acute e vent characterized by  a worsening of the patient’s respi[INVESTIGATOR_749887] -to-day variations and leads to a change in medication [ GOLD, 2017]. 
The rate at which acute exacerbations occur varies greatl y between patients, with severe 
patients exacerbating more often. AECOPD additionally
 increase morbidity and 
mortality , leading to faster decline in lung function, poorer functional status, and have a 
significant impact on healthcare s ystems worldwide [ Sapey , 2006].
The lungs are known to be colonised with different strains of bacteria [ Erb-Downward , 
2011; Wilkinson , 2017]. In COPD patients, acquisition of new bacterial strains is 
believed to be an important cause of AECOPD [ Sethi , 2002]. Although estimate s vary  
widely , Non -Typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) appears to be the main bacterial 
pathogen associated with AECOPD (11 -38%), followed b y Moraxella catarrhalis (Mcat) 
(3-
25%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (4-9%) [ Alamoudi , 2007; Bandi , 2003; 
Hutchinson, 2007; 
Ko, 2007; Larsen, 2009; Murphy , 2005; Papi , 2006; Rosell , 2005;

27-MAR -2019 39Reducing the frequency  and severit y of AECOPD is one of the main goals of COPD 
maintenance treatment. The severit y of AECOPD can be graded according to the 
intensity  of medical intervention required (see Table 1) [Wedzicha , 2007 . 
Table 1 Classification of severity  of A ECOPD
Grade Intens ity of medical intervention
Mild Can be controlled with an increase in dosage of regular medications
Moderate Requires treatment with systemic corticosteroids and/ or antibiotics
Severe Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956] *
*In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_749888]/or treatment for AECOPD that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or in an out -
patient setting. 
1.1.2. Current man agement of A ECOPD
The use of antibiotics is recommended b y several guidelines [ American Thoracic Societ y 
and European Respi[INVESTIGATOR_450962] y, 2004] as a standard treatment for COPD patients with 
AECOPD showing purulent sputum. However, as not all patients have confirmed 
bacterial -related exacerbations, there is an inappropriate use of antibiotics, leading to the 
spread of antibiotic -resistant bacteria [ Daubin, 2008]. I nfections with multidrug -resistant 
bacteria have been linked to increase in morbidit y, length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], health care 
cost and morta lity [Nseir , 2008].
A wide range of pharmacologic (such as inhaled corticosteroids, bronchodilators, 
phosphodiesterase inhibitors, theophy llines, long -term antibiotics and mucoly tics) and 
non-pharmacologic (such as lung volume reduction surgery , home ox ygen, ventilatory  
support and pulmonary  rehabilitation) interventions also exist to reduce AECOPD and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_749889]. However, a need for further novel interventions re mains because 
current approaches are not completely  effective, even when targeted and used optimally . 
Prevention of AECOPD is an insufficientl y addressed medical need today , despi[INVESTIGATOR_749890] (bronchodilators such as long-acting musc arinic 
antagonists [LAMA], long -acting beta agonists [LABA], methy lxanthines, 
corticosteroids, phosphodiesterase -
4 inhibitors and combination drugs), and is thought to 
remain so in the 10 -years horizon.
There is currentl y no vaccine indicated for preventio n of AECOPD, even though 
influenza and pneumococcal vaccines are routinely recommended to COPD patients. The 
availability  of a vaccine for the prevention of bacterial AECOPD could contribute 
significantl y to the current management of COPD, in terms of redu cing the risk of 
bacterial exacerbations as well as the inappropriate use of antibiotics.

27-MAR -2019 401.1.3. [COMPANY_004] Biologicals’ NTHi- Mcat investigational vaccine
GlaxoSmithKline ([COMPANY_004]) Biologicals is developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a new NTHi- Mcat investigational 
vaccine against diseases caused b y NTHi and Mcat. The investigational vaccine that will 
be evaluated in the present study  is an adjuvanted multi -component vaccine consisting of 
surface proteins from NTHi and Mcat. The selected NTHi antigens are three conserved 
surface proteins presented as a free recombinant Protein D (PD) and a recombinant fusion 
protein combining Protein E (PE) and protein Pi[INVESTIGATOR_749871], named PE -Pi[INVESTIGATOR_749871]. The selected Mcat 
antigen is UspA2, a surface protein from Mcat that is expressed in more than 95% of the 
Mcat strains. The vaccine is being developed foractive immunisation to reduce the 
frequency  of moderate and severe acute exacerbations of COPD in patients with a 
previous history  of AECOPD.
The target population of the [COMPANY_004] NTHi -Mcat investigational vaccine are COPD patients, 
who are often elderly , who are known to have a weakened immune response due to 
functional defects and altered frequencies of innate and adaptive immune cells, with 
impaired generation of long -term immune memory  (immunosenescence)  Weinberger , 
2008 . Moreover, the immune response of COPD patients has been suggested to be 
disturbed both locally  and sy stemicall y. Using an adjuvant may  help to induce a higher 
and long er-lasting immune response.
Please refer to the current I nvestigator Brochure for information regarding the pre -
clinical and clinical studies andthe epi[INVESTIGATOR_749891] -Mcat 
investigational vaccine .
1.2. Rationale for the study  and study  design
1.2.1. Rationale for the study
The purpose of this Phase IIB proof -of-concept (POC) study  in moderate to very  severe 
COPD patients (i.e. GOLD grade 2, 3 and 4) aged 40 to 80 y ears with a history  of 
moderate or severe AECOPD in the previous 12 months is to ev aluate whether the NTHi -
Mcat vaccine can reduce the frequency  of AECOPD in this population and to assess the 
vaccine’s safety , reactogenicity  and immunogenicity .
Several formulations of a vaccine containing the NTHi antigens (10 or 30 µg) either non -
adjuva nted or combined with different adjuvants (aluminium [Al], adjuvant sy stem 
[AS]01 Eand AS04 C) were alread y evaluated in two previous Phase I clinical trials 
(NTHI -002 in healthy  adults aged 18 -40 years and NTHI -003 in current and former 
healthy  smokers o f 50-70 years old). The investigational vaccines were well -tolerated, 
with an acceptable safet y and reactogenicit y profile. These studies allowed the dose 
selection of the NTHi antigens (10 µg) and the adjuvant sy stem (AS01 E) currentl y 
evaluated for the fi rst time in moderate and severe COPD patients ag ed 45 
-81 years in 
the Phase II stud y NTH I-004.

MCAT -001). Based on results obtained up to [ADDRESS_1025409] of care tosubjects in the respective stud y groups.
1.2.2. Rationale for the study  design
In the current study , moderate, severe and very  severe COPD patients (i.e. GOLD grade 
2, 3 and 4) with a history of AECOPD will receive 2 doses of the NTHi -Mcat 
investigational vaccine or placebo intramuscularl y (IM) according to a 0, [ADDRESS_1025410] care.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Scheduled study  visits and A ECOPD -driven study  contacts
Scheduled study  visits, during which the effect of immunisation against NTHi and Mcat 
will be evaluated, will take place a t pre-defined timepoints (see Figure 2). 
In addition to the scheduled study  visits, ad hoc AECOPD
-driven study visit(s) and/ or 
phone contact(s) will take place for each AECOPD occurring from first vaccination up 
to study  conclusion:
An AECOPD visit will be scheduled as soon as possible after the onset of the 
AECOPD sy mptoms (maximum 96 hours after the onset of the s ymptoms). 
Follow -up visit(s) and/or phone call(s) w ill take place to determine the end of the 
AECOPD. 
1.3. Rationale for the use of placebo
There is currentl y no established vaccine with recognised efficacy in reducing the 
frequency  of AECOPD. Placebo will therefore be used as a control.
1.4. Benefit: Risk Assessment

1.4.1. Risk Assessment
Important Potential/Identified 
RiskData/Rationale for Risk Mitigation Strategy
NTHi -Mcat investigational vaccine
Theoretical risk of acquiring a 
vaccine -induced autoimmune 
disease after vaccinationNo confirmed signals related to this 
potential risk have been identified 
during the preclinical and clinical 
programs so farClose monitoring of potential immune -
mediated diseases in clinical 
development programs using adjuvants 
systems. The potential risk for events of 
possible autoimmune ae tiology to occur 
is mentioned in the Informed Consent 
Form (ICF).
Study Procedures
Risk of blood sampling Blood sampling associated risk of 
syncope, dizziness, infection at the 
site after or during venepuncture.Blood samples will be obtained by a 
trained professional and medical 
assistance will be available.
The potential risk of feeling faint, or 
experiencing mild local pain, bruising, 
irritation or redness at the site where 
blood was taken, is mentioned in the 
ICF. The amount of blood to be taken
for sampling will not be harmful to the 
subject’s health.
Risk of induced sputum sampling Small risk of bronchoconstriction as 
a reaction to the inhalation of the 
saline solution used to induce the 
sputumSputum induction is generally 
considered safe. The potential risk of 
bronchoconstriction is mentioned in the 
ICF.

Strong exhalation can cause 
increased pressure in chest, eyes 
or stomach. Occasionally after 
receiving the 
albuterol/salmeterol inhaler, a 
temporary sensation of “heart 
racing” and shakiness may be 
felt.(Amended 27 March 2019)Screening of patients with a 
contraindication for spi[INVESTIGATOR_68333]

electronic Diary  Cards will be programmed as to detect potential AECOPD as follows 
(based on the Anthonisen criteria [ Anthonisen, 1987]):
Worsening of two or m ore of the following major sy mptoms for at least two 
consecutive day s: dy spnoea, sputum volume, sputum purulence (colour), OR
Worsening of any major symptom together with any of the following minor 
symptoms for at least two consecutive day s: sore throat, c old(nasal discharge and/or 
nasal congestion), fever (oral temperature 37.5°C /99.5°F ) without other cause, 
increased cough, increased wheeze.
Note :The same two s ymptoms do not have to be present on both day s as long as at least 
one major s ymptom is present on both day s.
Each time a potential AECOPD is detected via the electronic Diary  Card, the device will 
alert the subject to contact [CONTACT_4145], and at the same time an alert will be sent to the 
site so that the investigat or contacts the subject to determine if the alert is an AECOPD or 
not, and if an AECOPD visit is warranted. Delegation of this responsibility from the 
investigator to study  staff should be agreed with the Sponsor. In addition, the site should 
proactivel y follow-
up all data received via the electronic Diary  Card and contact [CONTACT_749953] .
During the contact [CONTACT_1155], the investigator will determine whether the subject 
might actuall y be experiencing an AECOPD ( e.g.notifications that can be explained 
solely by [CONTACT_749954]):
If the investigator concludes that the subject is notexperiencing an AECOPD, this 
should be documented/ reported in the Study  Works (Web portal) . Please refer to 
study  procedures manual (SPM) for more details on how to perform this.
If the investigator concludes that the subject is experiencing an AECOPD, an 
occurrence of AECOPD will be entered in the eCRF and an AECOPD visit will be 
scheduled as soon as possible after the onset of AECOPD sy mptoms as recorded in 
the electronic Diary  Card or confirmed by  [CONTACT_423] (maximum 96 hours after onset 
of sy mptoms and, if applicable, preferabl y before starting treatment with antibiotics). 
The AECOPD onset date wi ll be captured in the eCRF and additional information 
about severity will be also collected.
In case the AECOPD is confirmed but no AECOPD visit can take place, the site 
should record the information in the medical records subject files, and in the 
eCRF in medical records section and obtain all relevant information regarding 
the AECOPD (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8735], medical record etc) and record this in the eCRF.

practice outside of the study .
During the AECOPD visit, the investigator will again confirm the occurrence of the 
AECOPD b ased on clinical and medical judgement and based on the Anthonisen criteria 
and will record its date of onset. The end date of the AECOPD and its severity  will be 
determined/ confirmed by [CONTACT_651852] (a) follow up phone call(s), which will 
take place at least every  2 weeks until the AECOPD has resolved.
If an AECOPD occurs at the time when one of the scheduled stable study  visits is 
planned, it should be handled and recorded as an AECOPD visit, with all relevant 
AECOPD visit study  procedures performed and, if possible, the stable study  visit should 
be re -scheduled to a later date, when the subject is stable again and within the time 
window specified in the protocol.
The site must engage their best efforts to reach the patients, however, if the site does not 
succeed in contact[CONTACT_5713], the reason should be recorded and an explanation given 
about what occurred. For example, the subject could be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_749897] a 
different ph ysician (and in that case medical record sshould be obtained), or the subject is 
on holiday s or not able to go tothe sit e.
For the anal ysis of the primary  endpoint, the AECOPD must be confirmed by  [CONTACT_1275]:

[IP_ADDRESS].1. Study group and treatment number allocation
The target will be to enrol approximately  600 eligible subjects who will be randomly  
assigned to two stud y groups in a (1:1) ratio (approximately  300 subjects in each group).
Allocation of the subject to a study  group at the investigator site will be performed using 
a randomisation system on internet (SBIR). The randomisation algorithm will use a 
minimisation procedure accounting for age (40 -59 years or 60 -80 years), n umber of 
modera te/ severe AECOP D in the previous y ear (< 2 or ≥2),GOLD grade (GOLD 2,

For each dose subsequent to the first dose, the study  staff in charge of the vaccine 
administration will access SBIR, provide the subject identification number, and the 
system will provide a treatment number consistent with the allocated study group.
The number of each administered treatment must be recorded in the eCRF on the Vaccine 
Administration form/screen.
When SBI R is not available, refer to the SBIR user g uide or the SPM for specific 
instructions.
6.2.3. Allocation of subjects to assay  subsets 
Approximately  50% of the subjects (~150 subjects per group) will have their sputum 
samples anal ysed for microbiology  ininvestigator institutions or [COMPANY_004] designated lab . 
Thesub-setwill be selected for sites that have microbiology  accredited local/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_749902].
Sputum samples (or a subset of them) , not tested for microbiology  at investiga tor 
institutions or [COMPANY_004] designated labs , will also be used for cy tokine measurement (see also
Table 12).
6.3. Method of blinding 
As the investigational NTHi -Mcat vaccine in this study  isof different appearance than 
the placebo and the investigational NTHi -Mcat vaccine will have to be reconstituted 
whereas the placebo does not, dou ble-blinding is not feasible.
Data will be collected in an observer -blind manner. By  [CONTACT_43049]-
blind, it is meant that 
during the course o f the study , the vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_42973] y stud y endpoi nt (e.g. safet y, reactogenicity and efficacy ) will all be 
unaware of whether vaccine or placebo was administered. 
Study site
Each stud y site is responsible for having a blinding plan. To work in an observer -blind 
manner, vaccine preparation and administration will be done by  [CONTACT_749961] y of the study clinical evaluation assay s.Two 
teams of study  personnel will hence be set up:

7.2. Storage and handling of study  vaccine s
The study  vaccines must be stored at the respective label storage temperature conditions 
in a safe and locked place. Access to the storage space should be limited to authorized 
study  personnel. The storage conditions will be assessed during pre -study  activities under 
the responsibility  of the sponsor study  contact. The storage temperature should be 
continuously  monitored with calibrated (if not validated) temperature monitoring 
device(s) and recorded. Refer to the Module on Cl inical Trial Supplies in the SPM for 
more details on storage of the study  vaccines.
Temperature excursions must be reported in degree Celsius.
Any temperature excursion outside the range of 0.0 to +8.0 C (for +2 to +8°C/+36 to 
+46°F label storage condition) impacting investigational medicinal products (I MPs) 
must 
be reported in the appropriate (electronic) temperature excursion decision form ([e]TDF). 
The impacted IMPs must not be used and must be stored in quarantine at label 
temperature conditions until usage approval has been obtained from the sponsor.

An AE can therefore be any  unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporall y associated with 
the use of a medicinal product. For marketed medicinal products, this also includes 
failure to produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of efficacy ), abuse or misuse. 
Examples of an AE include:
Significant or unexpected worsening of the condition under study .
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre- existing condition , apart from the 
condition under study ,including either an increase in frequency  and/or intensity  of 
the condition.
New conditions detected or diagnosed after investigational vaccine administration 
even though they  may  have been present prior to the start of the study .
Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.
Signs, sy mptom s temporally  associated with vaccine administration.
Pre-or post -treatment events that occur as a result of protocol- mandated procedures 
(i.e. invasive procedures, modification of subject’s previous therapeutic regimen).
AEs to be recorded as endpoints (s olicited AEs) are described in Section 9.1.3 . All other 
AEs will be recorded as UNSOLI CITED AEs.
Examples of an AE DO NOT include:
Medical or surgical procedures ( e.g.endoscop y, appendectom y); the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE/ SAE.
Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur ( e.g.social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], admission for routine examination).
Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present

 that do not worsen. 
The disease being studied, or expected progression, signs, or s ymptoms of the 
disease being studied, unless more severe than expected for the subject’s condition.
Pre-existing conditions or signs and/or s ymptoms present in a subject prior to the

Potential immune -mediated diseases (p IMDs) are a subset of AEs that include 
autoimmune diseases and other inflammatory  and/or neurologic disorders of interest 
which may  or may  not have an autoimmune aetiology . AEs that need to be recorded and 
reported as pI[INVESTIGATOR_159201] 19 .
However, the investigator will exercise his/her medical and scientific judgement in 
deciding whether other diseases have an autoimmune origin (i.e. pathoph ysiology  
involving systemic or organ-specific pathogenic autoantibodies) and should also be 
recorded as a p IMD.

Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_1025475] -study  AE/SAE is defined as any  event that occurs outside of the AE/SAE 
reporting period defined in Table 20. Investigators are not obligated to actively  seek AEs 
or SAEs in former stud y participants. However, if the investigator learns of any  SAE at 
any time after a subject has been discharged from the study , and he/she considers the

As a consistent method of collecting AEs, the sub jectshould be asked a non -leading 
question such as:
‘Have you felt different in any way since receiving the vaccine s or since the previous 
visit? ’
When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility  of the investigator to review all 
documentation (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory  and diagnostics reports) relative 
to the event. The inv estigator will then record all relevant information regar ding an 
AE/SAE in the eCRF. T he investigator is not allowed to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_5189]’s medical records to [COMPANY_004] Biologicals instead of appropriatel y completing the

The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis pertaining to the event based on 
signs, s ymptoms, and/or other clinical information. I n such cases, the diagnosis should be 
documented as the AE/SAE and not the individual signs/sy mptoms.

Biologicals using the following grading scale:
0 : < 20 mm diameter
1 : 20 mm to 50 mm diameter
2 : > 50 mm to  100 mm diameter
3 : > 100 mm diameter
Temperature ( in this study  preferred location to measure the temperature is oral cavit y or 
axilla) will be scored as follows:
0 : < 37.5°C
1 : 37.5°C to 37.9°C
2 : 38.0°C to 38.9 °C
3 : ≥39.0°C
The intensity  of each AE and SAE should be assigned to one of the following categories:
1 (mild) =An AE w hich is easil y tolerated b y the subject, causing minimal 
discomfort and not interfering with every day activities.
2 (moderate) =An AE which is sufficiently  discomforting to interfere with 
normal every day activities.
3 (severe) =An AE which preve nts normal, every day activities. S uch an AE 
would, for example, prevent attendance at work/school and 
would necessitate the admini stration of corrective therap y.
An AE that is assessed as Grade 3 (severe) should not be confused with a SAE. Grade 
3 is a category  used for rating the intensit y of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be 
assessed as Grade 3. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets one of the pre -
defined outcomes as described in Section 9.1.2.
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Assessment of causality
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship betw een stud y vaccines and the 
occurrence of each unsolicited AE/SAE using clinical judgement. In case of concomitant 
administration of multiple vaccines/products, if possible, the investigator should specify  
if the AE could be causally  related to a specific va ccine/product administered (i.e. 
investigational, control/placebo or co -administered vaccine). When c ausal relationship to 
a specific vaccine(s)/product(s) cannot be determined the investigator should indicate the 
AE to be related to all products.

IB to determine his/her assessment.
There may  be situations when a SAE has occurred and the investiga tor has minimal

important that the investigator alway s makes an assessment of causality  for every  event 
prior to submission of the Expedited Adverse Events Report to [COMPANY_004] B iologicals. The 
investigator may  change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_19954] -up information and 
update the SAE information accordingl y. The causality assessment is one of the criteria 
used when determining regulatory  reporting requirements.
All solicited local (injection site) and general reactions will be considered causally  related 
to vaccination. Causality  of all other AEs should be assessed by  [CONTACT_159290]:
Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE may hav e been caused by [CONTACT_106365] ?
YES : There is a reasonable possibility  that the study vaccines contributed to 
the AE. 
NO : There is no reasonable possibility that the AE is causally  related to the 
administration of the study  vaccines. There are other, more likel y 
causes and administration of the study  vaccines is not suspected to have 
contributed to the AE.
If an event meets the criteria to be determined as ‘serious’ (see Section 9.1.2 ), additional 
examinations/tests will be performed b y the investigator in order to determine ALL 
possible contributing factors for each SAE.
Possible contributing factors include:
Medical history .

Protocol Amendment [ADDRESS_1025480] for Reporting SAEs is essential so that legal obligations 
and ethical responsibilities towards the safet y of other subjects are met.
Investigator safety  reports are prepared according to the current [COMPANY_004] policy  and are 
forwarded to investigators as necessary . An investigator safet y report is prepared for a 
SAE(s) that is both attributable to the study vaccines and unexpected. The purpose of the 
report is to fulfil specific regulatory  and GCP requirements, regarding the product under 
investigation.

After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each 
subject and provide additional relevant information on the subject’s condition to [COMPANY_004] 
Biologicals (within 24 hours for SAEs; refer to Table 22).
All AEs documented at a previous visit/contact [CONTACT_159292]/not 
resolved or recovering/resolving will be reviewed at subsequent visits/contacts until [ADDRESS_1025481] vaccination .
All pI [INVESTIGATOR_159170] (serious or non -serious) and SAEs documented at a previous visit/contact [CONTACT_43084]/not resolved or recovering/resolving will be reviewed at 
subsequent visits/contacts until the end of the study .

The investigator will follow subjects:
with SAEs, pI [INVESTIGATOR_159170] (serious or non -serious), or subjects withdrawn from the study  as 
a result of an AE, until the event has resolved, subsided, stabilised, disap peared, or 
until the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow-up. 
If the investigator receives additional relevant information on a previousl y reported SAE, 
he/she will provide this information to [COMPANY_004] Biologicals using a paper/ electronic

regulatory  reporting. The [COMPANY_004] Biologicals’ Central Safet y Physician is responsible for 
unblinding the treatment assignment in accordance with the specified timeframes for 
expedited reporting of SAEs (refer to Section 9.4.1 ).
9.8. Emergency  unblinding
Unblinding of a subject’s individual 
treatment code should occur only in thecase of a 
medical emergency , or in the event of a serious medical condition, when knowledge of 
the treatment is essential for the clinical management or welfare of the subject , as judged 
by [CONTACT_093].
The emergency  unblinding process consists of the automated sy stem SBIR that allows the 
investigator to have unrestricted, immediate and direct access to the subject’s individual 
study  treatment.

a need to perform a data review, or if there is a safety  problem (at least once per y ear). 
The SRT will inform the iSRC about any  potential safet y concern relevant to the study. 
Before each iSRC safet y evaluation in this study , the SRT will review the same safety  
data, but in a blinded manner, in order to keep all people involved in the conduct, 
cleaning and final anal ysis of the study  blinded.

The iSRC will be authorised by  [CONTACT_43055]’ Vaccine Safet y Monitoring Board 
(VSMB) and its c ore members will include a [COMPANY_004] Biologicals’ Safet y Physician, a 
CRDL , and a Biostatistician who are not otherwise involved in the conduct of the project . 
If none of the core members listed above is a respi[INVESTIGATOR_749920], such an expert will be 
included.
The iSRC will conduct unblinded reviews of all available safety  data from the present 
study  while taking into account an y other findings that could have an impact on the safet y 
of the subjects, and will determine whether there is a safet y signal that needs to be 
escalated to [COMPANY_004] Biologicals’ VSMB. In the event that a safet y signal is observed, [COMPANY_004] 
Biologicals ’ VSMB might decide to suspend, modify  or continue the conduct of the 
study .
Planne d iSRC reviews will be done when approximately  [ADDRESS_1025484] completed one month after second vaccination (Figure 3).
In addition to the planned iSRC evaluations, ad hoc safet y evaluations can take place if a 
safet y concern is identifie d by [CONTACT_749972].

The primary  objective of this study  is to assess the efficacy  of the investigational vaccine 
as compared to placebo control, as measured b y the rate of moderate and severe 
AECOPD from [ADDRESS_1025500]. Sample size is 
estimated using a formula from [ Keen, 2007]. Assuming a yearly incidence rate of 
moderate and severe AECOPD in the placeb o arm equal to 0.[ADDRESS_1025501] [ Mackay , 
2012; Dransfield , 2013] and an over -dispersion parameter of 1.8, ~300 subjects per group 
will provide 80% power to detect at least a 28 % reduction in the rate of AECOPDs in the 
vaccinated group compared to the placebo group, with a 1 -sided 6.5% significance level 
and a dropout rate of 15%.

FAS .The primary anal ysiswill also be repeated on the efficacy ATP (per -protocol) 
cohort if the percentage of vaccinated subjects excluded from the ATP cohort for efficacy  
is more than 5%.
Efficacy –Clinical Endpoint
The following incidence rates of AECOPD (an y type) occurring from enrolment up to [ADDRESS_1025512] -Dose 2 will be computed together with 95% CI, and incidence rates together 
with VE in the prevention of AECOPD (an y type) will be computed over a period 
starting [ADDRESS_1025513]- Dose 2 and lasting for 1 year, with 95% CI: 
All-cause moderate and severe AECOPD (primary endpoint).
All-cause, all -severity AECOPD.
All-cause AECOPD, b y severit y.
For the primary endpoint, the 87% CI will also be reported in order to evaluate the null 
hypothesis at 13% alpha level (2 -side). This objective will be considered a success if the 
lower limit of the 87% CI will be above 0%. (Amended 27 March 2019)
The CI sof the incidence rate will be computed using a model which accounts fo r 
repeated events. The primary  outcome will be analy sed using the Negative Binomial 
regression model with number of AECOPD as dependent variable; treatment (vaccine or 
placebo), age group (40 –59 years or 60–80 y ears ), GOLD grade (2, 3 or 4), history  of 
exacerbations (<2 or ≥ 2) and country  as independent variables, with logarithm as link 
function, and the logarithm of time for follow- up (in y ears) as an offset variable . If the 
model does not converge, the Poisson distribution will be used instead of the Ne gative 
Binomial one.
VEforAECOPD events is defin
ed as:
VE (AECOPD) = 1 - Rvacc/ Rcon
with:
Rvacc= average yearlyincidence rate of AECOPD events per subject in the group 10 -

Humoral immunity
Serological assay swill be performed at [COMPANY_004] Biologicals’ laboratory  or in a [COMPANY_004] 
designated laboratory  using assay s as described below and in Table 10. The cut -off and 
unit of these assa ys might be subject to change during the course of the study  (e.g. in case 
of assay  re-optimization, qualification or standardization). In this case, this will be 
documented in the clinical study  report.
Anti-PD antibodies
Anti
-PD antibodies will be determined using a validated ELI SA assay  developed by  [CONTACT_348621]. Concentration of specific anti -PD antibodies will be determined, using 
in-house made reference serum. The technical cut -off of the assay  is 153 EU/mL .
Anti-PE antibodies
Anti- PE antibodies will be determined using an ELISA assay developed by [CONTACT_348621]. Concentration of specific anti -PE antibodies will be determined, using in-
house made reference serum. The tec hnical cut -off of the assay  is 16EU/mL. (Am ended 
27 March 2019)
Anti-Pi[INVESTIGATOR_749929]- Pi[INVESTIGATOR_749930]. Concentration of specific anti -Pi[INVESTIGATOR_749931], using an 
in-house made reference serum. The tec hnical cut -off of the assay  is 8EU/mL .

Anti-UspA2 antibodies
Anti- UspA2 antibodies will be determined using an ELI SA assay  developed by  [CONTACT_348621]. Concentration of specific anti -UspA2 antibodies will be determined, using 
an in- house made reference serum. The tec hnical cut- off of the assay  is 28EU/mL . 
(Amended 27 March 2019)
Cell-mediated immunity
CMI  assay s will be performed at [COMPANY_004] Biologicals' laboratory or in a [COMPANY_004] designated 
laboratory  using assay s as described in Table 11.
The I CS staining assay  will be used to assess CMI  responses, using an adaptation of 
previously  described methods [ Moris , 2011]. After PBMC stimulation with the relevant 
antigens, the frequency  of CD4+and/or CD8+T-cells expressing selected set of cy tokines 
(such as IL -2, IL -13, IL -17, IFN -γ, TNF -α and CD40L) or selected combination of 
cytokines will be evaluated by  [CONTACT_749989] .

Amendment date: 30 November 2017
Co-ordinating author: , XPE Pharma & Science for [COMPANY_004] 
Biologicals
Rationale/background for changes: 
!Removal of the ® and ™ symbols in the document and simplification of the 
copyright statement as per [COMPANY_004] Legal Global Trade Marks (LGTM) department’s recommendation.
!The tertiary endpoint regarding ‘biomarkers’ has been adjusted as haematology is 
measured at baseline only and not throughout the study and thus cannot be considered a study endpoint.
!CD8
+T cell component was removed from the secondary endpoint, but kept in the 
exploratory/tertiary endpoint. Previous clinical studies have shown that the 
investigational NTHi and NTHi-Mcat vaccines do not induce CD8+T cell 
responses. This was observed in all studies performed with the NTHi vaccine and seen in the interim analysis of NTHi Mcat-001 study. 
!The definition of ‘current smoker’ has been updated to better clarify the time 
frame during which a subject who stopped smoking is still considered as ‘current smoker’. A definition for ‘Study Works’ was also added to the glossary of terms. 
!An exclusion criterion was updated to clarify that only subjects with clinically 
significant respi[INVESTIGATOR_749934] (e.g. clinically significant lung 
fibrosis, clinically significant pulmonary embolism) need to be excluded from 
study participation.

Protocol Amendment 2 Final
27-MAR -2019 146Footnote a and b of the Study  Procedures Table were rewritten to clarify  when 
some study  procedures of the Screening Visit needs to be repeated (i.e. in case 
Visit [ADDRESS_1025543] has 
any medical condition [e.g. fever] that prevents his/her participation in the study  
within 29 d ays of Screening Visit) and when the entire Screening Visit needs to be 
repeated (i.e. in case the subject had AECOPD before Visit [ADDRESS_1025544] was stable for 30 day s). The footnote to the study  design overview figure 
was adjusted in a similar way.
A footnote was added to the study  procedures table to explain that solicited 
(general/local) AEs will be collected up to Day  [ADDRESS_1025545] -vaccination, but solicited 
AEs ongoing at Day  7 will be followed until resolution (for a maximum of 30 
days). This was also added to Section 6.9.21 . 
A scientific rationale for collecting race/ethnicit y was added per country  specific 
requi rement for [LOCATION_009] (Section 6.9.5).
Cut-off values for anti -PE, anti -Pi[INVESTIGATOR_749877]- UspA2 antibody  ELISAs were 
updated following the re -set up of the assay s.
The PCR assay  for sputum samples was not designed to discriminate amongst 
Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) serot ypes. Results from AERI S epi[INVESTIGATOR_119260]  [Wilkinson , 2017] showed that more than 99% of these bacteria would be 
Non-Typeabl e Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi). Therefore, the protocol was 
updated to clarify  that the presence of Hi bacteria in sputum during exacerbation 
will be used to determine AECOPD associated to NTHi.
The list of potential im mune mediated diseases ( Table 19) was updated (effective 
June 30th2017). A list of MedDRA preferred terms for potential immune mediated 
diseases was added as Appendix C.
The FDA reference was removed from the intensity  scale for redness/swelling and 
temperature as the reference did not re flect the correct cut -off values for the 
different intensities that will be used in this study . 
A definition for ‘All enrolled set’ was missing in the original protocol. Table and 
listings referring to this cohort will be prepared.
The 87% confidence inte rval (CI) was removed from all secondary  anal yses. This 
confidence interval will only  be maintained for the primary  anal ysis because the 
95% CI s are underpowered for this study .  All other sensitivity  analy ses on 
different cohorts will be described using 9 5% CIs. As the primary  objective will 
have both 87% and 95%, the sensitivity anal yses can be interpreted with 95% CI
s.
‘According- to-Protocol’ was replaced b y ‘Per-Protocol Set’ as per current CDI SC 
standard for cohorts for analy sis. 
A Fu ll-Anal ysis Set ( FAS) that corresponds to an intent -to-treat analy siswas 
added . The FAS will include all randomized subjects who will receive at least [ADDRESS_1025546] in the FAS 
will be anal ysed “as randomized” (i.e. according to the vaccine a subject was 
planned to receive irrespectivel y of his/her real exposure).

Section 4.1 Detection of AECOPD
If the investigator concludes that the subject is notexperiencing an AECOPD, this 
should be documented/ reported in the eCRF Study Works (Web portal) . Please refer 
to study  procedures manual (SPM) for more detail s on how to perform this.
The site must engage their best efforts to reach the patients, however, if the site does not 
succeed in contact[CONTACT_5713], the reason should be recorded and an explanation given 
about what occurred. For example, the subject c ould be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_749897] a 
different ph ysician (and in that case medical record sshould be obtained), or the subject is 
on holiday s or not able to go tothe site.

Section [IP_ADDRESS] Randomisation of supplies
The randomisation of supplies within blocks will be performed at [COMPANY_004] Biologicals, using 
MATerial EXcellence ( MATEX), a program developed for use in Statistical Anal ysis 
System ( SAS®) (Cary , NC, [LOCATION_003]) by  [CONTACT_43055]. Entire blocks will be shipped to

The target will be to enrol approximately  600 eligible subjects who will be randomly  
assigned to two stud y groups in a (1: 1) ratio (approximately  300 subjects in e ach group).
Allocation of the subject to a study  group at the investigator site will be performed using 
a randomisation system on internet (SBIR). The randomisation algorithm will use a 
minimisation procedure accounting for age (40 -59 years or 60 -80 years), n umber of 
moderate/ severe AECOP D in the previous y ear (< 2 or ≥2),GOLD grade (GOLD 2, 
GOLD 3 or GOLD 4) and country .Minimisation factors will have equal weight in the 
minimisation algorithm .
Details on the minimisation algorithm are reported in th e statistical analysis plan.

Efficacy –Clinical Endpoint
The following incidence rates of AECOPD (an y type) occurring from enrolment up to [ADDRESS_1025604] -Dose 2 will be computed together with 87% 95% CI, and incidence rates 
together with VE in the prevention of AECOPD (any  type) will be computed over a 
period start ing [ADDRESS_1025605] -Dose 2 and lasting for 1 y ear, with 87%95% CI: 
All-cause moderate and severe AECOPD (primary endpoint).
All-cause, all -severity AECOPD.
All-cause AECOPD, b y severit y.
For the primary  endpoint, the 95% CI will also be reported in order to evaluate the null 
hypothesis at 5% alpha level (2 -side). For the primary endpoint, the 87% CI will also be 
reported in order to evaluate the null hypothesis at 13% alpha level (2 -side). This 
objective will be considered a success if the lower limit of the 87% CI will be above 0%.

Acquisition and apparition
The following definitions will be used:
Acquisition: The first time a bacterium is detected in the sputum of a patient over 
the course of the study visits ( a positive status at the visit considered as baseline 
excludes a subject from this analysis ).
Apparition: Detection of a bacterium in the sputum of a patient taken during a 
study visit which was not detected in the sputum taken during the previous visit.
The following analyses will be performed for (NT)Hi (alone or with other bacteria), 
MCAT (alone or with other bacteria) and either Hi or MCAT:
Percentages of subjects with acquisition for each treatment group and risk ratio 
between groups, considering both Day 1 and D ay 91as baseline.
Percentages of subjects with apparition for each treatment group and risk ratio 
between groups, considering Day 1 as baseline.
Percentages of subjects with acquisition at AECOPD visit for each treatment 
group and risk ratio between groups, considering both Day 1 and D ay 91as 
baseline.
Percentages of subjects with apparition at AECOPD visit (when negative at 
previous stable visit) for each treatment group and risk ratio between groups, 
considering 
Day 1 as baseline
Frequency table for apparition (number of apparition for each subject fro m Day 
1), by [CONTACT_6660].

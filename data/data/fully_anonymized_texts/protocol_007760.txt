PRÉCIS  
Background:  
• Approximately 50% of patients with advanced, non- HPV associated  head and neck 
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) will develop locoregional or distant relapse within 
two years of completing definitive standard -of-care treatment.  
• Two ongoing clinical trials investigating neoadjuvant PD -[ADDRESS_621278] that immunotherapy can both cytoreduce existing disease before surgery and reduce the risk of locoregional or distant disease relapse after surgery.  
• Preliminary data from these studies suggest neoadjuvant treatments can be administered 
without delaying planned surgical intervention . 
• Experiments conducted by [CONTACT_483444] (LTIB ) 
demonstrated synergistic activity with tumor- targeted adenoviral vaccine plus M7824 
plus N-803 in humanized mice bearing human carcinomas and in vitro  studies.  
• M7824 is a bifunctional fusion protein consisting of an anti -programmed death ligand 1 
(PD-L1) antibody and the extracellular domain of transforming growth factor beta (TGF -
β) receptor type 2, a TGF- β trap.  
• Adenoviral vaccines targeting known shared tumor antigens can generate antigen- specific 
T cells.  
• N-803 is an IL -15/IL- 15Rα super  agonist complex that can enhance both NK cell and T 
cell anti -tumor activity via expansion and activation. 
• Activity observed with neoadjuvant anti -PD-[ADDRESS_621279] been 
shown to work in concert with M7824 in preclinical studies. 
• Analysis of pre - and post -treatment tissues from HNSCC patients presents a unique 
opportunity to interrogate the effects the above treatment(s) on tumor.  
• A dose escalation of N -[ADDRESS_621280] been treated with the combination. 
No DLTs were observed.  
Objectives:  
• Determine the rate of pathologic complete response ( pCR) or clinical- to-pathological 
downstaging in patients  with previously untreated intermediate/high risk, non- HPV 
associated  , squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (T1- T4, N0- N3, M0 stage II, 
III or IV) who receive  any of the three proposed treatments : M7824 alone, M7824 plus 
TriAd vaccine, or M7824 plus TriAd vaccine plus N803 prior to definite surgery. 
Eligibility:  
• Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed, previously untreated intermediate/high risk, p16 -negative (if oropharyngeal ), squamous cell carcinoma of the 
head and neck (T1- T4, N0-N3, M0 stage II, III or IV) 
• Men
 or Women; Age >18 years  
• ECOG performance status ≤ 1

Design:  
• This protocol is a sequential window of opportunity trial of A nti-PD-L1/TGF- β trap 
(M7824) alone and in combination with TriAd Vaccine  and N -803 for non-HPV 
associated resectable Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) .  
• Patients will be referred to the NIH for this immunotherapy treatment from surrounding 
academic medical centers and private physicians.  
• Upon referral to the NIH, patients will be rapi[INVESTIGATOR_483414], and enrolled on the protocol, 
if appropriate.  
• This trial will enroll patients in three arms sequentially to permit safety evaluation before adding the next agen t. 
• In the first arm of 12 patients, M7824 (1200 mg) will be administered intravenously on day 1 and 15. 
• If no safety concerns, accrual will proceed to the 2
nd arm, and 12 patients will enroll with 
M7824 (1200mg; intravenous ) treatment on day 1 and 15 and TriAd vaccine ( 5 x 1011 
VP; subcutaneous) treatment on day 1 only. 
• If no safety concerns, accrual will proceed to the 3rd arm, and 12 patients will enroll  with 
M7824 ((1200mg; intravenous ) treatment on day 1 and 15 plus TriAd vaccine ( 5 x 1011 
VP; subcutaneous injection) and N- 803 (15mcg/kg, subcutaneously) treatment on day 1. 
• After obtaining pre -treatment biopsies, imaging and blood collection, patients will 
receive the neoadjuvant immunotherapy at the NIH Clinical Center.  
• Patients will then be sent back to their referring providers for their definitive standard of care surgery and adjuvant therapy as indicated based upon pathologic analysis of the surgical specimen. NCI invest igators will have no role in directing the ensuing standard 
of care surgeries performed at outside institutions .  
• For consistency in pathologic analysis of resection specimens, tissue blocks and/or slides 
will be obtained from outside institutions and be reviewed by [CONTACT_483445].  
• It is expected that up to 20 patients may enroll in one year. Thus, with 3 arms of 12 
patients api[INVESTIGATOR_13959], up to 36 evaluable patients may enroll. Accrual is expected to be completed within 2 years.

1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
1.1.1 Primary Objective  
Determine the rate of pathologic complete response ( pCR) or clinical -to-pathological 
downstaging in patients  with previously untreated intermediate/high risk, non HPV -associated 
squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (T1- T4, N0- N3, M0 stage II, III or IV) who 
receive any of the three proposed treatments : M7824 alone, M7824 plus TriAd vaccine, or 
M7824 plus TriAd vaccine plus N803. 
1.1.2 Secondary Objectives  
• Estimate the rate of grade 3 or 4  immune related adverse events ( irAEs ) 
• Determine the rate of treatment -related adverse events ( AE) causing a delay of 4 weeks 
or more beyond  planned surgery 
• Estimate the response rate of the primary disease by [CONTACT_483446] (RECIST)  
• Estimate the one- and two- year recurrence free survival  
• One- and two- year overall survival  
1.1.3 Exploratory Objectives  
• Define immune infiltrate  and localization  using m ultiplex immunofluorescence  
• Define T cell clonality  using Deep TCR- seq 
• Determine  tumor infiltrating  lymphocyte ( TIL) responses to shared antigens and antigens 
predicted from exome and RNA sequencing  
• Assess antigen specific responses using peripheral T cell isolation  
• Multiparameter characterization of PBMC by [CONTACT_4133]  
• Assessment of changes in serum cytokines  
• Assessment of changes in TGF β signaling in tumor, normal mucosa and skin  
 
1.[ADDRESS_621284] -of-care treatment for patients with locally -advanced or locoregionally 
advanced (stage II, III or IV) non-HPV associated  head and neck squamous cell carcinoma 
(HNSCC) of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx and larynx includes multi -modality 
therapy consisting of concurrent chemoradiation (CRT) or surgery followed by [CONTACT_483447]. In contrast to patients with human papi[INVESTIGATOR_28597] (HPV) -positive oropharyngeal cancer, patients with newly diagnosed advanced stage HPV-
negative HNSCC have poor outcomes after definitive standard -of-care treatment [1]. N
egative 
p16 status is a surrogate marker for an HPV -negative tumor (p16- positive tumors are HPV -
positive) in tumors originating in the oropharynx . Involvement of HPV  and therefore p16 status, 
have not been demonstrated to be biologically relevant in head and neck cancers originating in

locations other than the oropharynx (e.g. oral cavity, larynx, hypopharynx or nasopharynx)  [2]. 
Therefore , these tumors are considered to be ‘non- HPV associated.’  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_483415], locoregional recurrence (LR) or distant metastasis (DM) will develop in 35% of 
patients  with non- HPV- associated HNSCC  in the first one year (Figure 1 ). F ive -year overall 
survival (OS) is less than 50% [3]. A dditionally, standard -of-care treatments for advanced stage 
HNSCC leave cured patients with devastating functional impairments [ 4].  More efficacious and 
less toxic treatments are needed for advanced stage, non- HPV associated, HNSCC.  
Figure 1: Disease- free survival in patients with advanced p16- negative HNSCC treated with radiotherapy (RT) or 
RT plus chemotherapy.  
 
1.2.2 Immu notherapy has clinical activity in patients with HNSCC  
HNSCC has features that make it ideal for immunotherapy. The majority of HNSCC specimens demonstrate evidence of T cell infiltration and PD -L1 expression indicative of an underlying 
immune response [ 5]. A
dditionally, HNSCCs harbor many genomic alterations that may give 
rise to an array of T cell neoantigens [ 6, 7].  Based on safety and improved overall survival 
reported in two clinical trials, both pembrolizumab and nivolumab, two programmed death receptor -1 (PD -1) monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ), are FDA -approved for patients with 
recurrent/metastatic HNSCC that have failed systemic platinum -based chemotherapy [ 5, 8]. 
These studies demonstrate a manageable safety profile but objective responses in only 15 -20% of 
patients following PD -1 blockade. Optimal timing of immune checkpoint blockade, or 
combination immunotherapy targeting resistance mechanisms, may enhance response rates and lead to improved patient survival.  
10 
Abbreviated Title:  Neoadjuvant IO for HNSCC  
Version Date:  March 26, [ADDRESS_621285] increased clinical activity in HNSCC 
Treatment with immunotherapy before definitive extirpative surgery (neoadjuvant treatment) 
may optimally activate anti -tumor immunity. The use of up- front neoadjuvant or induction 
immunotherapy before standard-of- care treatment for HNSCC is being actively studied in at least 
nine clinical trials worldwide. Pre -clinical work from our laboratory demonstrates that PD -1 
mAb treatment before surgical removal of tumor in mice leads to greater induction of neoantigen- specific memory T cells and anti -tumor immunity compared to PD -1 mAb treatment 
after surgical removal of tumor in multiple models of head and neck cancer (Figure 2). This data 
suggests that immunotherapy administered when tumor antigen is present followed by [CONTACT_483448]. Immunotherapy in the up- front treatment 
setting before surgical resection may increase the magnitude o f response or increase the 
percentage of patients that respond. Additionally, surgical specimens offer an opportunity to assess for alterations in clinical -to-pathologic staging and evidence of major pathologic response 
as trial outcome measures [ 9]. 
 
Ongoing clinical trials at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute and University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_483416]. Preliminary results from these studies have demonstrated 1) no grade 3/4 adverse events, 2) no delays in pre -determined time to 
surgery with surgical treatment occurring t wo to three weeks following the final dose of 
immunotherapy, 3) improved disease -specific survival at the one -year mark, and 4) evidence of 
clinical activity with major pathologic responses in surgery specimens and clinical- to-pathologic 
downstaging [ 10] ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) , [11] ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  Thus, neoadjuvant single agent 
immune checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy before definitive surgical resection in patients with advanced HNSCC appears be safe and have clinical activity.

1.2.4 Rationale for combination of I/O agents  
Preclinical studies are now revealing that an effective immuno -oncology strategy is the use of 
multiple immune -mediating agents, each targeting different components of the immune system. 
These include: (a) induction of an immune response via vaccination directed against tumor-associated antigens, (b) potentiation of the systemic immune response by [CONTACT_483450] (such as the N -803 [also known as ALT -803], an IL -[ADDRESS_621286] fusion 
protein) to enhance both NK and CD8
+ T-cell responses, and (c) reduction of 
immunosuppressive entities in the tumor microenvironment (TME) by [CONTACT_311801] -PD1/PDL1 
mAb checkpoint inhibitors, and/or reduction of immunosuppressive cytokines such as TGF -β 
with the use of a bifunctional anti -PDL1/TGF- β2 “Trap” designated M7824. The LTIB, in 
collaboration with the Genitourinary Malignancies Branch ( GMB) , has developed and/or co-
developed these agents via a series o f cooperative research and development agreements 
(CRADAs ). Each has been interrogated in a series of preclinical studies and in Phase I/II clinical 
studies in the CCR as well as by [CONTACT_127761]. The preclinical studies and early clinical studies detailed below are demonstrating the relative lack of additional toxicities with enhanced clinical benefit employing combinations of these agents. Furthermore, preclinical studies are now demonstrating that the combined use of agents from each of the immune -mediating 
categories described above elicits the most immune- mediated anti -tumor activities.

 Figure 3:  Combined effect of Ad- Twist vaccine and M7824 in EMT6 carcinoma model  
As previous shown in studies published by [CONTACT_483451] [ 12], M 7824 combined 
with tumor- targeted vaccine enhances antitumor activity in metastatic murine cancer models (  
F
igure 3) . A dditionally, M7824 can mediate ADCC  and the addition of N -803 to M7824further 
enhances this ADCC activity .  [13] (Figure 4) .

1.2.5 M7824  
TGFβ is an immunosuppressive cytokine highly expressed in HNSCC by [CONTACT_20150], stromal and 
infiltrating immune cells and is a mechanism of resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitor 
immunotherapy[ 14, 15].  M7824 is a bifunctional fusion protein combining anti -PD-L1 mAb and 
TGFβ receptor type 2, serving as a TGF β trap (  F igure 6). By [CONTACT_483452] -L [ADDRESS_621288] anti- tumor immune activation in 
multiple pre -clinical models of cancer [16]. I n a dose -escalation phase 1 study  performed at the 
NIH Clinical Center, M7824 demonstrated a manageable safety profile and induced durable anti -
tumor responses, as well as reduction in circulating TGF β (Figure 7 ) [17]. F our of nineteen 
patients (21%) experienced a grade 3 or 4 adverse event; these included one case of grade 2 bullous pemphigoid, one case of grade 3 asymptomatic lipase increase, one case of grade 2 colitis, and once case of grade 3 hypokalemia. Only grade 2 colitis occurred within 30 days of initiating M7824 treatment.

 Figure 6: M7824 .   
Approximately one -third of patients with advanced non- HPV associated HNSCC harbor tumors 
without evidence of T cell infiltration [ 5], suggesting these tumors may lack T cell antigens or 
have antigen processing or presentation defects. NK cells recognize tumors cells through antigen- independent mechanisms and may play a role in anti -tumor immunity in these cancers. 
In addition to activating T cells, M7824 can induce NK cell anti -tumor activity through 
antibody- dependent cell -mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and the in vivo anti -tumor activity of 
M7824 is dependent upon both T cells and NK cells [ 12, 16]. T
hus, M7824 dually activates T 
and NK cell activity along with local neutralization of immunosuppressive TGF β to maximally 
activate anti -tumor immunity.

cancer receiving M7824.

effector T and NK cells, leading to significant in vivo anti -tumor activity when combined with 
immune checkpoint blockade in multiple pre -clinical solid tumor models [18].  As discussed 
above, M7824 enhances ADCC -mediated NK cell cytotoxicity [12].  Specifically, experiments 
conducted in the LTIB show that N -803 and M7824 work synergistically to enhance NK cell -
mediated ADCC (  Figure 8A  ) [19].  T he combination of N -803 and immune checkpoint 
blockade (nivolumab) has been used clinically with a manageable safety profile and evidence of 
clinical activity [20]. N o patient receiving this combination treatment experienced a grade 4 
adverse event. Grade 3 adverse events occurred in ≤ 10% of patients and included fever, fatigue, 
dizziness and alterations in clinical laboratory assessments.  
1.2.7 C linical Safety and Experience with N -803 and anti- PD-1/L1 blockade at the NCI 
The combination of N -803 and immune checkpoint blockade (nivolumab) has been used 
clinically with a manageable safety profile and evidence of clinical activity [ 20]. N o patient 
receiving this combination treatment experienced a grade 4 adverse event. Grade 3 adverse 
events occurred in ≤10% of patients and included fever, fatigue, dizziness and alterations in 
clinical laboratory assessments. Furthermore, investigators at the NIH Clinical center have 
experience with administration of combination M7824 and N -803. As of January 2019, [ADDRESS_621290] been treated with the M7824 1,200 mg IV every 2 weeks + N -803 
(10-15 mcg/kg) SC every 2 weeks combination at the NCI. Four patients received a N -803 
dosing of 10 mcg/kg every 2 weeks and 9 patients received N -803 dosing of 15 m cg/kg. No 
dose limiting, or unexpected toxicities  attributed to the combination  were observed. One patient 
with microsatellite stable, metastatic rectal cancer achieved a dramatic drop in CEA and improvement of cough attributed to lung metastasis after 3 treatments of M7824 and N -803.

patient had received CEA, MUC1, and brachyury targeted adenoviral -based vaccine before 
enrolling on the M7824 + N-803 study.  
Figure 8 : A) Carcinoembryonic antigen decrease in a microsatellite stable colorectal cancer patient, who had 
previously received TriAd vaccine, while on M7824 and N -803.B) Corresponding decrease in lung metastasis in the

Pharmacodynamic data from Nant suggest optimal T cell and NK cell is achieved with 15 
mcg/kg dosing every 3 weeks. Therefore, a one -time dose of 15 mcg/kg N -803 on day 1 of 
treatment will be used in this study.  
1.2.8 Therapeutic brachyury, MUC1 and CEA adenovirus vaccines (TriAd vaccine)  
The ability of adenoviral vaccination platforms to induce antigen -specific immune responses in 
human cancers is well studied. While vaccination of individual HNSCC cancer patients against A 
B

Abbreviated Title:  Neoadjuvant IO for HNSCC  
Version Date:  March 26, [ADDRESS_621292] shared antigens commonly expressed in HNSCCs allows for the use of a 
standardized vaccine platform, and pre- clinical data suggests that “spreading” of T cell responses 
against neoantigens can be induced following vaccination against tumor -associated antigens 
(unpublished data, Hamilton laboratory). Query of expression data from the HNSCC cohort of 
The Cancer Genome Atlas demonstrates that brachyury, MUC1 and CEA are commonly expressed in HNSCCs and represent rational shared antigen targets. (Figure 9 ).   
Figure 9: Gene expression of brachyury, MUC1 and CEA from the HNSCC cohort of TCGA .   
1.2.9 Clinical Experience with brachyury, MUC1 and CEA adenovirus vaccines at the NCI  
Administration of adenoviral vaccines encoding for these tumor- associated antigens has shown a 
manageable toxicity profile and ability to induce antigen specific T cell response in phase I trial conducted by [CONTACT_483453]/LTIB at the NCI. The combination of ETBX -011 (CEA -targeted), ETBX 
-051 (brachyury- targeted) and ETBX -061 (MUC1- targeted) has been tested in ten subjects. No 
DLTs were observed. Common TRAEs were fever and injection site reactions, all grade 1 or 2. Preliminary immune response data from this trial is shown in Table 1 .

The immunogenicity of the TriAd vaccine (ETBX -011, ETBX -051 and ETBX -061) has been 
assessed in five patients enrolled in the Phase I study following 1 (n=1), 2 (n=5), and 3 (n=3) 
cycles of vaccination. Antigen -specific immune responses were assessed with a cytometry -based 
assay. T cells expressing the type I cytokines IFN -γ, IL-2, TNF -α, and/or the degranulation 
marker CD107a following stimulation with peptide pools encoding CEA, MUC -1, and 
Brachyury were measured before and after vaccination, as previously described [ 21, 22]. 
Including all time points examined, unpublished studies by [CONTACT_483454] 5/5 patients 
(100%) developed T cell responses to at least one of the antigens (MUC -1, CEA, Brachyury) 
encoded by [CONTACT_29500], with both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses noted. The demonstrated 
immunogenicity of the TriAd vaccine in advanced and diverse cancer patients enrolled in the Phase I study supports the use of this vaccine in combination immunotherapy studies in more homogeneous populations.   
1.2.[ADDRESS_621293] of care [23]. P
atients will have 
the opportunity to benefit from neoadjuvant immunotherapy as they await surgical treatment. Since treatment will occur over [ADDRESS_621294] optimal T cell and NK cell is achieved with 15 mcg/kg dosing every 3 weeks. Therefore, a one -time dose of 15 mcg/kg N -803 on day 1 of 
treatment will be used in this study.  M7824 is given at a flat dose of 1,200 mg intravenously.

from the phase I study of this vaccine platform.  
1.2.11 Rationale Summary  
• Clinical outcomes for non -HPV- associated  HNSCC are poor.  
• Generating tumor associated antigen -specific T cells (e.g. CEA, MUC1, and brachyury) 
and then enabling their activity with combination immuno -oncologic ( I/O) agents (e.g. 
M7824 and N -803) has been validated preclinically as a strategy for increasing immune -
mediated anti- tumor activity  
• M7824 and N -803 also work in concert to enhance anti -tumor activity in a non -antigen 
specific fashion (i.e. enhanced NK cell -mediated  antibody dependent cellular 
cytotoxicity ). 
• The window between diagnosis and resection of  non- HPV associated HNSCC tumors 
presents a “window”  opportunity to test minimally toxic combination immuno-oncologic 
agents’ ability to improve clinical outcomes.  
• Patients have the opportunity to benefit from immunotherapy during this period of time when they are normally scheduling and awaiting definitive surgery treatment for their HNSCC.  
• Pre-treatment biopsies and post- treatment biopsies or resected tumor samples can provide 
ample tissue for studies aimed at interrogating the effects of combination immuno -
oncologic treatments on tumor microenvironment and correlating those effects with 
clinical activity.

Center  under a separate NIDCD protocol (01 -DC-0099). This protocol treats patients with 
neoadjuvant immunotherapy only; standard of care surgery and any indicated adjuvant therapy is not part of this protocol. Tissue blocks or slides from surgically resected tissues will be obtained 
from these outside institutions and reviewed by [CONTACT_483458]. Secondary clinical outcome measures will be determined by [CONTACT_483459]. 
Immune correlative analyses may be performed on pre - and post -treatment tissues (tumor, 
normal mucosa and skin) and bloods. Pre -treatment biopsies will be obtained in the clinic setting 
(OP5 Otolaryngology clinic) under local anesthesia only whenever possible. When not possible 
or safe to obtain biopsies in the clinic, biopsies will be obtained under general anesthesia in the operating room at the NIH Clinical Center. Post -treatment biopsies will be obtained at the time 
of standard of care surgery if the surgery is being performed at the NIH Clinical Center or at Suburban Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. If the surgery will be performed at an outside academic institution other than Suburban Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], then biopsies will be performed in the clinic setting under local anesthesia. When not possible or safe to obtain biopsies in the clinic, post -treatment biopsies will not be 
obtained.  
If a patient’s condition precludes safe performance of any protocol -indicated procedure, the 
procedure may be canceled at the discretion of the investigator.

3.1.1 Design Schema 
 
 
• Staggered enrollment for Arm B and Arm C  
In order to minimize expos ure to unanticipated adverse events for the first in human 
combinations administered to patients in Arm B and Arm C, staggered enrollment will be 
utilized for the first 3 patients enrolled to Arm B and Arm C.  
For Arms B and C:  
• An interval of [ADDRESS_621303] pass between treatment of patient #1 and 
patient #2.  
• An interval of [ADDRESS_621304] pass between treatment of patient #2 and 
patient #3.

3.1.2 Dose Limiting Toxicity  
Dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) will be defined as  any event  at least possibly  attributable to 
investigational agents that delays planned tumor resection surgery by >4 weeks  or any one of the 
following adverse events, possibly attributable to study  agents (M7824 and/or N -803 and/or 
TriAd vaccine) , that occurs within 28 days after study agent administration . 
Any grade ≥ 4 hematologic toxicity or grade ≥  3 anemia or grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets 
25-50,000) with associated bleeding, except CD4 lymphocyte count or other T lymphocyte 
subset count.  
• Any grade ≥ 3 non-hematologic toxicity, except for any of the following:  
o transient (≤ 48 hour) grade 3 fatigue, local reactions, flu like symptoms, fever, headache, 
or nausea, emesis, and diarrhea not controlled with adequate medical management, or 
o Any CTCAE Grade 3 skin toxicity lasting less than five days.  
o Electro lyte abnormalities that can be easily managed with replacement therapy.  Grade 3 
hyperkalemia/hypokalemia that does not resolve to ≤ Grade 2 within 48 hours -72 hours 
with medical management will be considered a DLT.  
o Asymptomatic Grade 3 lipase or amylase el evation. 
o Grade 3 immune -related colitis or pneumonitis that resolves to grade 1 within 48 hours of 
initiating appropriate medical treatment  
o Any endocrinopathy that can be medically managed with hormone replacement  
• Since patients in this population undergo potentially curative resection, a treatment- related 
delay in planned surgery >[ADDRESS_621306]  possibly attributable to the treatment regimen . This does not apply 
to asymptomatic grade 4 lab abnormalities (e.g. lipase elevation). Prior to resumption of the 
study, an expedited safety report will be sent to and reviewed by [CONTACT_8415]. Serious adverse events (SAE s) also must be evaluated by [CONTACT_96517].  
After completed enrollment of a rm A, enrollment to a rm B will proceed if ≤1 patient  in arm A 
experience a DLT.  
After completed enrollment of a rm B, enrollment to a rm C will proceed if  ≤1 patient  in arm B 
experienc e a DLT.  
If 2 patients in a given study arm experience a DLT, accrual to that arm will be halted.

3.2 DRUG ADMINISTRATION  
3.2.1 General rule  
A window of +/ -3 days for every two weeks study drug(s) dosing is allowed in the event of 
scheduling issues (i.e. holiday, bad weather or other scheduling issues). A minimum of [ADDRESS_621307] M7824 administration and the second.  Any dose that cannot be accommodated within this window will be skipped and the dose not made up. 
3.2.2 M7824 
Subjects in Arms A, B and C will be scheduled to receive M7824 at a flat dose of 1,200 mg IV 
on days 1 and 15. 
Subjects will receive M7824 via IV infusion over 1 hour ( -10 minutes / +20 minutes, that is, over 
50 to 80 minutes) once every 2 weeks. M7824 will be administered as a "flat" dose of 1,200 mg 
independent of body weight. M7824 is administered as an intravenous infusion with a mandatory 0.2 micron in- line filter.  
In order to mitigate potential infusion -related reactions, premedication with an antihistamine and 
with acetaminophen (for example, 25- 50 mg diphenhydramine and 500 -650 mg acetaminophen ) 
may be given within approximately [ADDRESS_621308] available medical practice.  
• Risk for cutaneous keratocanthoma/squamous cell carcinoma with administration of 
M7824 
All cases of skin lesions suspi[INVESTIGATOR_483420]. In cases where patients are unable to follow up with Dermatology at the NIH, keratoacanthomas may be managed by [CONTACT_483460]. Patients will then undergo routine follow -up skin exams and treatment as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_483461].  
3.2.3 Adenoviral vaccines  
ETBX 011, 051 and 061 will be given as subcutaneous injections, on day 1 of treatment  to 
subjects in  Arms B and C. 
ETBX -011, ETBX -051 and ETBX -061 will be administered by [CONTACT_483462]. A 1 to 1⁄[ADDRESS_621309] 5 cm.

Abbreviated Title:  Neoadjuvant IO for HNSCC  
Version Date:  March 26, [ADDRESS_621311] dose. N-803 will not be self-administered.  
• Skin Rash in Association with Subcutaneous Administration of N-803 
Based on current experience, localized skin rashes are common with subcutaneous 
administration. If a rash occurs and the rash area surrounding the N -803 injection site is > 6 cm 
and symptomatic (painful and/or itchy), it may be treated (at the discretion of the treating physician) with topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 0.05% clobetasol propi[INVESTIGATOR_16847] (i.e. 0.05% Cormax) or 0.1% triamcinolone (i.e., Kenalog) cream. Diphenhydramine may be administered pre - (25-50 mg TID orally) and 
post- dosing (25- 50 mg TID orally x 2 days) of N -803 at the discretion of the treating physician. 
Diphenhydramine should be eliminated if not tolerated. Other agents may be administered at the discretion of the treating physician.  
3.2.5 Sequence and Monitoring of Dose Administration 
When administering concurrent investigational agents on the same day, the following sequence 
of administration is preferred. Acetaminophen 650 mg and Benadryl 50 mg by [CONTACT_1966] (or another 
equivalent antihistamine) may be given within [ADDRESS_621312] 10 minutes, but no longer than 5 hours, following M7824 infusion completion.  
3.3 D
OSE MODIFICATIONS  
No dose modifications are allowed. 
3.3.1 Suggested evaluation of suspected bleeding or hemorrhage events and treatment 
modification  
• For anemia or hemorrhage events assessed as treatment -related, items queried may 
include but are not limited to detailed relevant past medical and treatment history, bruising tendency, history of blood transfusions and/or dependency, and a request for an updated participant history including details such as concomitant medications, all laboratory data, updated dosing information and recent tumor evaluation scans.  
• In this protocol, anemia may be due to M7824 (documented in 29% of patients) and/or 
SX-682. For M7824 anemia is  an important identified risk (see Investigators’ 
Brochure). Notably, there are many reasons for hemorrhage and/or anemia in patients with advanced cancer, and Hb level of at least 10 g/dL is required for this study. A 
thorough investigation of new anemia cases of unspecified etiology is recommended: 
• Participants must enter the study with Hgb values at least 10 g/dL and baseline anemia 
evaluation is conducted per recommendations below.  
• Consider hematology consult for severe and or refractory anemias.  
30 
Abbreviated Title:  Neoadjuvant IO for HNSCC  
Version Date:  March 26, 2025  
 
• All relevant hematologic testing for treatment related anemias should be done prior to 
blood transfusion, if clinically feasible.  
• Transfusion should be performed at the discretion of the investigator, based on clinical 
assessment and considered when participant experiences significant anemia.  
• Guidance for evaluation of baseline anemia or suspected treatment -related anemias is 
provided below. Investigators may consider the following laboratory evaluations in 
participants with anemia.  
o Hb and CBC with differential (e.g. MCV, RDW, ANC, hematocrit, reticulocytes counts) 
o Peripheral blood smear for cell morphological assessment  
o Complete metabolic panel including liver panel-LFTs, bilirubin, LDH, renal function, and serum folate, B12 value s and other chemistries  
o Coagulation factors (PT, PTT, INR)  
o Urinalysis including culture 
o Iron panel (TIBC, ferritin, Fe)  
• Discuss further management with Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_483421].  
3.3.2 Immune -related adverse events  
Management of irAEs attributed should include consideration of published guidelines [ 24] 
and 
the investigator’s discretion.   
o I n addition to above referenced guidelines, the following recommendations should 
be considered when managing irAEs: 
• Permanent treatment discontinuation is required in case of immune -related 
Grade 4 rash/inflammatory dermatitis, nephritis, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, hemolytic uremic syndrome, aplastic anemia, immune thrombocytopenia, acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura inflammatory arthritis, myositis and polymyalgia -like syndrome.  
• For Grade 4 immune -related lymphopenia, permanent treatment 
discontinuation will be required, if lymphopenia is considered immune -
related in nature, no clear alternative explanation exists for the event, and it does not resolve within 14 days. Permanent treatment discontinuation is not required when the AE is manifested by a single laboratory value out of normal range without any clinical correlates. In this case, treatment should be held until the etiology is determined. If the event is not considered immune -related and resolves to  Grade ≤ 1, restarting treatment may be 
considered.  
• For Grade 1 immune -related pneumonitis: continue treatment. If clinically 
indicated, monitor participants weekly or more frequently as needed with 
31 
Abbreviated Title:  Neoadjuvant IO for HNSCC  
Version Date:  March 26, 2025  
 
history, physical examination and pulse oximetry. If symptoms appear 
and/or changes in the physical exam are noted, treat as Grade 2.  
•  For myositis: in case of management with rituximab, treatment should be discontinued.  
• For Grade 3 or 4 endocrinopathies: withhold until clinically stable or 
permanently discontinue depending on severity.  
• For hepatitis with no tumor involvement of the liver: withhold if total 
bilirubin increases to more than 1.[ADDRESS_621313]  
3.3.3 Discontinuation 
Treatment will be discontinued in case of  following events if occur within the DLT evaluation 
period: 
• Any Grade 4 adverse drug reactions (ADRs), as defined by [CONTACT_3989] v5 and assessed as 
related to any study agent  by [CONTACT_737], except for laboratory values that are 
determined to not be clinically significant or singl e laboratory valued that resolve to Grade ≤ 
1 or baseline grade within 7 days with adequate medical management. 
• Any Grade 3 ADRs except for any of the following: 
o Transient flu -like symptoms or fever, which is controlled with medical management.  
o Transient fatigue, local reactions, headache, nausea, emesis which is controlled with 
medical management.  
o Tumor flare phenomenon defined as local pain, irritation, or rash localized at sites of known or suspected tumor. 
o Any drug- related amylase or lipase abnormality that is not associated with symptoms or 
clinical manifestations of pancreatitis.  
o Hgb decrease (< 8.0 g/dL) that is clinically manageable with blood transfusions or erythroid growth factor use does not require treatment discontinuation.  
o Keratoacanthoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.  
o Any endocrinopathy that can be medically managed with hormone replacement 
o Those which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_483422] (e.g. placement of a pleurx catheter for recurrent inflammatory pleural effusions)  
3.3.4 Dose hold  
Dose hold determined to be necessary by [CONTACT_483463].  If a patient misses the 2
nd 
dose of M7824 that patient does not need to be replaced on that study  arm. For  conditions 
determined to be transient by [CONTACT_152152] r, treatment may be delayed by [CONTACT_8622] 3

4 CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS/MEASURES  
4.1 GENERAL GUIDANCE  
Supportive care with blood components, antibiotics, analgesics, general medical therapy, etc., will be delivered as required.  
Immunotherapy including interferon, immunosuppressive dru gs (for example, chemotherapy or 
systemic steroids except for short term treatment of allergic reactions, endocrine replacement therapy or low dose prednisone [≤ 10mg daily] or equivalent, or for the treatment of irAEs or other appropriate short -term stero id use), or other experimental pharmaceutical products are 
prohibited. Short term administration of systemic steroid or other immunosuppressant such as infliximab or mycophenolate (that is, for allergic reactions or management of irAEs) is allowed. Steroids with no or minimal systemic effect (topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], inhalation), are allowed. 
Any live vaccine therapi[INVESTIGATOR_483428]. Administration 
of inactivated vaccines is allowed (for example, inactivated influenza vaccine).  Locally approved 
COVID vaccines are permitted.  
Antiemetics may be used for the treatment of nausea and vomiting but should not be used prophylactically at first dosing. Steroid -based anti -emetics are not allowed.  
4.[ADDRESS_621317] treatment with N-803, if the investigator determines that stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_311783]. The beta blocker may be resumed 2 weeks following the dose of N -803. Anti-hypertensive management decisions will be 
made on a case by [CONTACT_413]. For example, an anti -hypertensive may be resumed or added at any 
point if the investigator believes it to be clinically indicated e.g. if a patient experiences uncontrolled hypertension while receiving N -803 treatment on study. For patients on 
antihypertensives at baseline, the agent will be resumed if clinically indicated by [CONTACT_311821] N- 803 treatment cessation.  
If a localized skin rash at the injection site occurs that is >6 cm and symptomatic, it may be treated with 0.05% clobetasol propi[INVESTIGATOR_311784] 0.1% triamcinolone cream or similar product at the discretion of the treating physician.  
39 
Abbreviated Title:  Neoadjuvant IO for HNSCC  
Version Date:  March 26, 2025  
 
Administration of additional glucocorticoids is discouraged during the N -803 treatment period as 
the use of systemic steroid medications may result in loss of therapeutic effects of the study drug. 
However systemic steroids may be used to treat an irAE.

The amount of blood that may be drawn from adult patients for research purposes shall not 
exceed 10.5 mL/kg or 550 mL, whichever is smaller, over any eight- week period.  
Blood samples will be processed and stored through the Clinical Services Program with Leidos Biomedical research, Inc. (CSP) and will be shipped to different labs for research analysis as 
required. Blood will be collected on days 1 and 15 prior giving treatment, Additionally, w hen no 
treatment is being given, blood will be collected  on day 8 and within day 21- 28, and day 105. 
This could occur +/ - 3 days for any time point.     
Tumor tissue (and also normal mucosa and skin t issue may be collected)  biopsies will be 
collected on Day  [ADDRESS_621321]- treatment biopsy (on  day 21- 28 biopsies ), if the surgery is perfor med at the 
NIH Clinical Center or at Suburban Hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_307], the tissue will be acquired  from the operating room 
while the patient is under general anesthesia. If the surgery will be performed at an outside 
academic institution other than Suburban Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],  then biopsies will be performed in the clinic 
setting under local anesthesia at the NIH Clinical Center. This could occur +/ - [ADDRESS_621322] -
treatment biopsies will not be obtained.  
Primary tumor biopsies  are limited to 10 per patient  per time point ; normal mucosa biopsies are 
limited to 2 per patient per time point; skin biopsies are limited to 1 per patient per time point. 
All tissue samples required for the Hamilton, Donahue and Hodge labs will be stored in the 
Allen lab  as described later in section 5.2.2 a
nd distributed when they are ready to perform 
assays.  
Tissue and blood samples will be assessed for correlative changes related to development of 
a
ntigen- specific anti -tumor immunity, general immune activation, and potential alterations in 
wound healing.  
5.1.1 To define immune infiltrate and localization using Multiplex immunofluorescence  
Multi -parameter (multi -plex) immunofluorescence using the Perkin- Elmer Opal System will be 
used to assess tumor samples for infiltration and location of selected  immune cell subsets, 
including effector T cells, regulatory T cells and myeloid cells . This will be done in collaboration 
with the Tumor Immune Microenvironment Laboratory (TIML) in the Genitourinary 
Malignancies Branch, NCI managed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Houssein Sater. [CONTACT_483494]’s laboratory is located

provide instructions on shippi[INVESTIGATOR_483430].  
5.1.3 Assessment of antigen -specific responses in TIL  and antigens predicted from exome and 
RNA sequencing  
Standardize d protocols develop ed in the NCI TIL Laboratory will be used to culture tumor 
infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) form tumor fragments. Briefly, tumor will be minced into 1 -2 mm 
fragments and plated in T cell supportive mediate supplemented with human IL -2. Following 3 
weeks of culture, T cells will be sorted via negative magnetic selection and assessed for antigen 
specific responses by [CONTACT_34536]. Samples stimulated with  Ionomycin, phorbol -myristate -acetate 
(PMA/Iono) will be used as a positive control. Autologous B cells expanded from PBMC will be 
used as antigen -presenting cells. Messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding genes of interest will be in 
vitro transcribed (IVT) from expression vectors engineered to express genes harboring potential 
antigens. mRNA will be electroporated into B cells. TIL will be screened for responses against naturally processed and presented MHC class I restricted epi[INVESTIGATOR_483431] -1, CEA, or 
brachyury, or predicted  neoepi[INVESTIGATOR_322] . This work will be performed in the Alle n Lab, NIDCD. 
Prediction of neoepi[INVESTIGATOR_483432], RNA sequencing and prediction pi[INVESTIGATOR_483433]. This work will be perfomed by [CONTACT_483467]. Nant will  use Illumina's HiSeq and 
NovaSeq platforms for sequencing. All samples  will be  run according to clinical sequencing 
quality standards, as regulated by [CONTACT_84905]/CAP, by [CONTACT_483468].   
 
5.1.4 Biomarker analysis related to wound healing.  
Expression analysis of genes related to wound dealing and TGF β signaling may we assessed. 
Hypotheses related to the role of immunotherapy- induced inflammation , TGFβ signaling and 
wound healing will be studied by [CONTACT_9064], immunofluorescence, and focused 
PCR arrays on FFPE or frozen tissues. This work will be performed in the Allen Lab, NIDCD.  
5.1.5 Assessment of antigen -specific responses in peripheral T cells.   
PBMCs may be analyzed for tumor antigen -specific immune responses to MUC -1, CEA, and 
Brachyury using an intracellular cytokine staining assay. PBMCs will be stimulated in vitro  with 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 15- mer peptide pools encoding the tumor -associated antigens listed above; control 
peptide pools will involve the use of human leukocyte antigen peptide as a ne gative control and 
CEFT peptide mix as a positive control. CEFT is a mixture of peptides of CMV, Epstein -Barr 
virus, influenza, and tetanus toxin. Post -stimulation analyses of CD4 and CD8 T cells will 
involve the production of IFN -γ, IL -2, TNF, and the degranulation marker CD107a. If sufficient 
PBMCs are available, assays may also be performed for the development of T cells to other tumor- associated antigens. A detailed description of this assay has been previously reported  [21]. 
This work will be performed in collaboration with the Laboratory of [CONTACT_483495], LTIB , 
NCI.  When ready to analyze, samples will be requested from Theresa Burks, CSP – Leidos, who

• Storage, Logging, Access to and Sample Destruction upon Completion  
Waste tissues will be stored in the NIDCD tissue bank at the NIH Clinical Center. In addition, 
limited samples may be collected under this protocol as described above. Following enrollment, subjects will be registered and assigned a code in CTDB under which the limited demographic and clinical information will be stored. Only the code will be used on the specimens to electronically log the specimens using a task -specific bar -code technology software which has 
full security and audit functions consistent with NIH requirements. Samples and the limited demographic and clinical information will not contain PII. Data should be entered within 2 weeks of patient enrollment onto the protocol. The access to the code keys will be limited to those designated by [CONTACT_483475] a secured, locked location.  Samples will be stored in freezers, liquid nitrogen containers or tissue cartridge shelves in the NIDCD Core laboratory, located in building 10 on the NIH campus, secured by [CONTACT_441198].  Access to samples from a protocol for research purposes will be by [CONTACT_79923] [INVESTIGATOR_483434] (1) for research purposes associated with protocol objectives for which the samples were collected, or (2) for a new research activity following submission and IRB approval of a new protocol and consent, or (3) for use only as unlinked or linked samples under the Office of Human Subjects Research Protections (OHSRP) 
Exemption Form guidelines stipulating that the activity is exempt from IRB review. The use of all samples will be fully tracked and audit lists of when each sample was used and who used it can be generated upon need or request.  Samples, and associated data, will be stored permanently unless the patient withdraws consent. If researchers have samples remaining once they have completed all studies associated with the protocol and patient consent has not been withdrawn, samples may be kept permanently for possible use in future IRB approved investigations.  Once research objectives for the protocol are achieved, researchers can request access to remaining samples, providing they have both approval of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_483435].  
5.2.3 Protocol Completion/Sample Destruction  
All specimens obtained in the protocol are used as defined in the protocol. Any specimens that 
are remaining at the completion of the protocol will be stored in the conditions described above. Samples from consenting subjects will be stored until they are no longer of scientific value or if a subject withdraws consent for their continued use, at which time they will be destroyed. If the patient withdraws consent, the participant’s data and specimens will be excluded from future distributions, but data and specimens that have already been distributed for approved research use will not be able to be retrieved.

5.3 SAMPLES FOR GENETIC /GENOMIC ANALYSIS  
5.3.1 Description of the scope of genetic/genomic analysis  
Using blood and tissue samples, we will perform next generation sequencing (NGS) of DNA  and 
RNA. This will be performed by [CONTACT_483467]. Nant will use Illumina's HiSeq and NovaSeq platforms 
for sequencing. 
 The primary purpose of this sequencing is to perform bioinformatic prediction of neoepi[INVESTIGATOR_322]. 
However, clinically actionable gene variants may be discovered as a result of exome sequencing. Refer to section 5.1.3 .  
5.3.2 Description of how privacy and confidentiality of medical information/biological specimens will be maximized  
Initially the samples of each patient will be barcoded. At no time will patient’s names be used on 
the blood a nd tissue samples. Sometimes, because a group collaboration or journal policy 
requires it, a subject’s genetic data will be deposited in a database such as dbGaP. Although there is controlled access to such a database, such a submission carries theoretical risks of revealing the identity of the subject. This is discussed in the consent. 
5.3.3 Management of Results  
Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_35114] a clinically actionable gene variant is discovered. Clinically 
actionable findings for the purpose of this study are defined as disorders appearing in the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics recommendations for the return of incidental findings that is current at the time of primary analysis. (A list of current guidelines is maintained on the CCR intranet: https://ccrod.cancer.gov/confluence/display/CCRCRO/Incidental+Findings+Lists ). 
Subjects 
will be contact[CONTACT_148408] a request to provide a blood sample to be sent to a CLIA certified laboratory. If the research findings are verified in the CLIA certified lab, the subject will be offered the opportunity to come to NIH (at our expense)  to have genetic  education and 
counseling to explain this result. If the subject does not want to come to NIH, a referral to a local genetic healthcare provider will be provided (at their expense).  
This is the only time during the course of the study that incidental findings will be returned. No in
terrogations regarding clinically actionable findings will be made after the primary analysis.  
5.3.4 Genetic counseling  
The costs of CLIA testing will be paid for by [CONTACT_079]. If the health history, family history, or tumor diagnosis suggests that the participant might benefit from genetic testing, we will discuss this with him/her.

6.3 RESPONSE CRITERIA  
For the purposes of this study, patients will be followed -up every 3 months +/ - [ADDRESS_621327]) guideline (version 1.1) guidelines to the post -treatment pathologic staging obtained 
from pathologic analysis of the surgically resected specimen. The screening/baseline imaging will be used to determine the pre -treatment TNM classification and stage. Both primary endpoint 
criteria are based upon results from pathologic analysis of surgically resected tissues. For patients that have surgery outside of th e NIH Clinical Center, tissue blocks and/or slides will be 
obtained from the institution where the patient underwent surgery after the patient signs that institution’s  release document. These tissue blocks and/or slides will be reviewed by [CONTACT_941] N CI 
Laboratory of Pathology. Outside pathology reports may also be obtained from the corresponding institution after the patient sign’s that institution’s  medical release document. In 
cases where there is discordance between the pathologic staging as determined by [CONTACT_483476], we will use the pathologic staging as 
determined by [CONTACT_483477].  
Secondary outcome response measures will be obtained by [CONTACT_483478]/baseline and D21- 28. Response or progression when comparing pre - 
and post -treatment imaging will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_159845]1.1 guidelines [25].
 Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional 
measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.  
6.3.1 D
isease Parameters  
Measurable disease :  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in 
at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as:  
• By [CONTACT_13190] x -ra y: >20 mm;  
• By [CONTACT_3610]:  
o S can slice thickness 5 mm or under : as >10 mm 
o Scan slice thickness >5 mm: double the slice thickness  
• W ith calipers on clinical exam: >10 mm.  
51 
Abbreviated Title:  Neoadjuvant IO for HNSCC  
Version Date:  March 26, [ADDRESS_621328] be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
Malignant lymph nodes. To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node 
must be > [ADDRESS_621329] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended 
to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured 
and followed. 
Non-measurable disease . A ll other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longes t 
diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered 
non-measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial 
effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, a nd abdominal masses 
(not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non- measurable.  
Note:  C ystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non- cystic lesions are 
present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
Target lesions.  A
 ll measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in 
total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  and recorded 
and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions 
with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on 
occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which 
circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. A 
sum of the diameters (longest for non- nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters 
will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable 
dimension of the disease.  
Non-target lesions . A
 ll other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over 
and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non -target lesions and should also be 
recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, 
or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow-up.  
6.3.2 Met hods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and 
never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging- based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
52 
Abbreviated Title:  Neoadjuvant IO for HNSCC  
Version Date:  March 26, 2025  
 
Clinical lesions : Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
(e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers 
(e.g., skin nodules). In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a 
ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
Chest x -ray: L esions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. However, CT is preferable.  
Conventional CT and MRI: T his guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based 
on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_621330] slice thickness 
greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  
MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans).  
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MR I has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly 
impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the availability of MRI 
is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the 
scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease. Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow -up should be the same as was used at 
baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond 
the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the 
image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Body scans 
should be performed with breath- hold scanning techniques, if possible.  
PET- CT:
 At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined PET -CT is 
not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements.  However, if 
the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET -CT is of identical diagnostic 
quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be 
used for RECIST measurements and can be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT 
introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed. 
Ultrasound: Ul
 trasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a 
method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for 
independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be 
guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the next. If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_12153], confirmation by [CONTACT_12154].  If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of 
CT in selected instances.  
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy: Th
 e utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is 
not advised.  However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological response 
when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint. 
53 
Abbreviated Title:  Neoadjuvant IO for HNSCC  
Version Date:  March 26, 2025  
 
Tumor markers:  Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are initially 
above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete 
clinical response.   
Cytology, Histology : Th ese techniques can be used to differentiate between partial responses 
(PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain). 
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens 
d
uring treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is 
mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
FDG- PET
 : While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG -
PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
a. N egative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion.  
b. No FDG- PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up: If the positive FDG -
PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD. If 
the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow -up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG- PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing 
site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD. 
c. FDG- PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy 
in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring.  The use of FDG -PET in this circumstance should be prospectively described 
in the protocol and supported by [CONTACT_4623] -specific medical literature for the indication.  
However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity.  
Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake greater 
than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image. 
6.3.3 Response Criteria  
6.3.4 Evaluation of Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR) : D
 isappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non- target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm. 
Partial Response (PR) : At  least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters.  
Progressive Disease (PD) : At l east a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
54 
Abbreviated Title:  Neoadjuvant IO for HNSCC  
Version Date:  March 26, [ADDRESS_621331] on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also 
considered progressions). 
Stable Disease (SD) :  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters while on study. 
6.3.5 E valuation of Non-Target Lesions 
Complete Response (CR) : D isappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non- pathological in size (<10 mm short axis). 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a 
patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
Non-CR/ Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits.  
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appe arance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression  of existing non- target lesions.  Unequivocal progression should not normally trump 
target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion 
increase. 
Although a clear progression of “non- t arget” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_12999], and the progression status should be 
confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal Investigator).  
6.3.[ADDRESS_621332] response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will 
depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product (ICH E6 (R2))  
8.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  (SAE)  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if in the view of the investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following:  
• Death,  
• A life -threatening adverse event (see 8.1.3) 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
o A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/admission that is pre -planned (i.e., elective or scheduled surgery 
arranged prior to the start of the study), a planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5912] -existing 
condition, or a procedure required by [CONTACT_760], without a serious deterioration in 
health, is not considered a serious adverse event.  
o A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/admission that is solely driven by [CONTACT_105]- medical reasons (e.g., 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_138707]) is not considered a serious adverse event.  
o Emergency room visits or stays in observation units that do not result in admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_62489] a serious adverse event. The reason for seeking medical care should be evaluated for meeting one of the other serious criteria.  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
• Important medic al events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require

medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
8.1.3 Life-threatening  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered "life -threatening" if, in the view 
of either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. (21CFR312.32)

related.   
• R
elated  – There is a reasonable possibility that the study product caused the adverse 
event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study product and the adverse event.  
• Not Related  
 – There is not  a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study 
product caused the event. 
8.1.[ADDRESS_621340] (AESI)  
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is one of scientific and medical interest specific to understanding of the Investigational Product(s) and may require close monitoring and rapid communication by [CONTACT_68477]. An AESI may be serious or non- serious. The 
rapid reporting of AESIs allows ongoing surveillance of these events to characterize and understand them in association with the use of these investigational products.  
Only AESIs that match the definition of SAE will be reported as other SAEs within 7 days from 
the knowledge of event. Other non- SAE AESIs should not be reported to OSRO but only 
collected in the clinical database.  
The adverse events related to mucosal bleeding, regardless of site, will be collected as an AESI to enable evaluation of potential risk factors, such as site/past radiation/associated infection at site/recent instrumentation and other variables such as time to onset, exposure history, grade of bleeding, anatomical sites, etc. can be collected.  
8.[ADDRESS_621341] and alternate etiology (if not related to study product), date of resolution of the event, seriousness and outcome. The assessment of severity and relationship to the study product will be done only by [CONTACT_8703] a diagnosis and listed on the Form FDA 1572 as the site principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_11637]- investigator.  AEs 
occurring during the collection and reporting period will be documented appropriately regardless of relationship.  AEs will be followed through resolution.

8.4 W
AIVER OF EXPEDITED REPORTING TO CCR   
As death due to disease progression is part of the study objectives (OS) , and captured as an 
endpoint in this study, it will not be reported in an expedited manner to the sponsor. However, if 
there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the study drug and the event, report 
the event in an expedited manner according to section 8.3. 
8.5 SAFETY REPORTING CRITERIA TO THE PHARMACEUTICAL COLLABORATORS  
Reporting will be per the collaborative agreement s.  
8.6 REPORTING PREGNANCY

The outcome of all pregnancies should be followed up and documented. 
8.6.[ADDRESS_621343] dose of any investigational drug  on this protocol, whichever occurs later . 
Pregnancy of the patient’s partner is not considered to be an AE. The  outcome of all pregnancies 
occurring from the date of the first dose until [ADDRESS_621344] dose should, if possible, be 
followed up and documented. Pregnant partners may be offered the opportunity to participate in 
an institutional pregnancy registry protocol (e.g., the NIH IRP pregnancy registry study) to provide data about the outcome of the pregnancy for safety reporting purposes. 
8.[ADDRESS_621345] and the adverse event.  CCR will notify FDA and all participating investigators (i.e., all investigators to whom the sponsor is providing drug under its INDs or under any investigator’s IND) in an IND safety report of potential serious risks from clinical trials or any other source, as soon as possible, in accordance to [ADDRESS_621346] annually in a summary format.  
8.8 S
PONSOR PROTOCOL DEVIATION  REPORTING  
A Protocol Deviation is defined as any non- compliance with the clinical trial Protocol, Manual 
of Operational Procedures (MOP) and other Sponsor approved study related documents , GCP, or 
protocol- specific procedural requirements on the part of the participant, the Investigator, or the 
study site staff inclusive of site personnel performing procedures or providing services in support 
of the clinical trial.  
It is the responsibility of the study Staff to document any protocol deviation identified by [CONTACT_83943] (PDTS) online 
application. The entries into the PDTS online application should be timely, complete, and maintained per CCR PDTS user requirements . In addition, any deviation to the protocol  should 
be documented in the participant’s source records and reported to the reviewing IRB per their 
guidelines. OSRO required protocol deviation reporting is consistent with E6(R2) GCP: 
Integrated Addendum to ICH E6(R1): 4.5 Compliance with Protocol; 5.18.3 (a), and 5.20 Noncompliance; and ICH E3 16.2.2 Protocol deviations. 
 
63 
Abbreviated Title:  Neoadjuvant IO for HNSCC  
Version Date:  March 26, [ADDRESS_621347] operating procedures, and the quality and integrity of study data and data collection methods are maintained.   
Monitoring for this study will be performed by [CONTACT_483480] (OSRO)  Sponsor and Regulatory Oversight Support (SROS) Services contractor. 
Clinical site monitoring activities will be  based on OSRO standards, FDA Guidance E6(R2) 
Good Clinical Practice: Integrated Addendum to ICH E6(R1) March 2018, and applicable regulatory requirements. 
Details of clinical site monitoring will be documented in a Clinical Monitoring Plan (CMP) 
developed by [CONTACT_62554]. CMPs will be protocol -specific, risk -based and tailored to address human 
subject protections and integrity of the study data. OSRO will determine the intensity and frequency of monitoring based on several factors, including study type, phase, risk, complexity, expected enrollment rate, and any unique attributes of the study and the site. The Sponsor will conduct a periodic review of the CMP to confirm the plan's continued appropriateness. A change to the protocol, significant or pervasive non- compliance with GCP, or the protocol may trigger 
CMP updates.  
OSRO  SROS  Monitoring visits and related activities will be conducted throughout the life cycle 
of each protocol. T he first activity is before the study start s to conduct a Site Assessment Visit 
(SAV) (as warranted), followed by a Site Initiation Visit (SIV), Interim Monitoring Visit(s) 
(IMVs), and a study Close -Out Visit (COV).  
Some monitoring activities may be performed remotely, while others will take place at the study site(s).  Monitoring visit reports will describe visit activities, observations , and associated action 
items or follow -up required for resolution of any issues, discrepancies, or deviations.  Monitoring 
reports will be distributed to the study PI, NCI CCR QA,  CCR Protocol Support Office,  
coordinating center (if applicable) and the Sponsor regulatory file.  
The site Monitor will inform the study team of any deviations observed during monitoring visits. If unresolved, the Monitor will request that the site Staff enter the deviations in the CCR Protocol Deviation Tracking System (PDTS) for deviation reporting to the Sponsor and as applicable per institutional and IRB guidance.  
10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1 S
TATISTICAL HYPOTHESIS  
10.1.1 Primary Endpoint(s):  
The primary endpoint of this study is to determine if by [CONTACT_483481]: M7824 alone, M7824 plus TriAd vaccine, or M7824 plus TriAd  vaccine plus N803, 
there is a sufficiently high success rate in patients with head and neck cancer. Success is defined as pathologic complete response ( pCR) or clinical to pathologic downstaging in each patient. 
10.1.2 Secondary Endpoint(s):  
• Estimate the rate of grade 3 or 4  immune related adverse events ( irAEs ) 
64 
Abbreviated Title:  Neoadjuvant IO for HNSCC  
Version Date:  March 26, 2025  
 
• Determine the rate of treatment -related adverse events ( AE) causing a delay of 4 weeks or 
more beyond planned surgery 
• Estimate the response rate of the primary disease by [CONTACT_483446] (RECIST)  
• Estimate the one- and two- year recurrence free survival  
• One- and two- year overall survival  
10.2 SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION  
Based on prior reports for single agents, no pCRs but an overall 30% success rate may be 
anticipated. Because of uncertainty involving delays in surgery following each treatment arm, the following three arms will be enrolled sequentially to permit safety evaluation before adding the next agent: 
• M7824 alone 
• M7824 + Vaccine 
• M7824 + Vaccine + N -803 
The trial will begin by [CONTACT_79323] 12 patients to the M7824 alone arm  (arm A). For sample size 
estimation purposes, with 12 patients, there would be 81% power for an exact binomial test with a one -sided 0.[ADDRESS_621348] the difference between a 20% success rate and a 
50% success rate in this arm. If 0 -1 of the 12 patients experiences a dose limiting toxicity , 
accrual will then proceed to the 2
nd arm (arm B) , and 12 patients will enroll following the same 
criteria. Finally, if 0 -1 of 12 patients experiences a dose limiting toxicity  while treated in the 
second arm  (arm B), accrual will proceed to the 3rd arm (arm C), again with [ADDRESS_621349] one dose of each of the intended agents on the three arms will be 
included in the analyses of primary and secondary endpoints. 
65 
Abbreviated Title:  Neoadjuvant IO for HNSCC  
Version Date:  March 26, [ADDRESS_621350] clinical to pathologic downstaging will be determined and reported 
with a confidence interval.  
10.4.2 Analysis of primary endpoints 
For each arm, the number of patients who experience a pCR will be determined and reported. In addition, for each arm, the fraction of patients who experience clinical to pathologic downstaging will be reported. Finally, for each arm, the fraction of patients who experience either a pCR or clinical to pathologic downstaging will be reported. Each of these fractions will be reported along with a 90% one-sided confidence interval. 
10.4.3 Analysis of secondary endpoints  
The secondary endpoints and their intended analyses are as follows:  
• To estimate the rate of grade 3 or 4 immune -related adverse events; the actual number of 
patients experiencing these events will be reported separately by [INVESTIGATOR_216].  
• To determine the rate of patients whose surgery is delayed 4 weeks or greater beyond 
planned surgery will be reported as the number out of the patients per arm, separately by [INVESTIGATOR_216]. 
• To estimate the response rate of the primary disease by [CONTACT_393], the fraction with 
CR+PR out of evaluable patients will be reported along with a 95% confidence interval, 
by [INVESTIGATOR_216]. 
• To estimate the 1 year and 2 -year RFS rates. A Kaplan -Meier curve of RFS will be 
constructed for each arm, with the 1 - and 2- year values reported along with 95% 
confidence intervals.  
• To estimate the 1 year and 2- year overall survival . A Kaplan -Meier curve of OS  will be 
constructed for each arm, with the 1 - and 2- year values reported along with 95% 
confidence intervals.  
10.4.4 Safety analyses  
Data on adverse events for each arm will be obtained and reported: to estimate the rate of grade 3 or 4 immune -related adverse events; the actual number of patients experiencing these events will 
be reported separately by [INVESTIGATOR_216].  
10.4.5 Baseline descriptive analyses  
Descriptive statistics will be determined and reported for patients enrolled onto any of the three treatment arms, separately by [INVESTIGATOR_216].  
10.4.6 Planned interim analyses  
None. 
66 
Abbreviated Title:  Neoadjuvant IO for HNSCC  
Version Date:  March 26, 2025  
 
10.4.7 Subgroup analyses 
None. 
10.4.8 Tabulation of individual patient data 
None. 10.4.9 Analysis of exploratory objectives.  
The following endpoints will be evaluated: 
• Immune infiltrate by [CONTACT_483482] m ultiplex immunofluorescence  
•  T cell clonality using Deep TCRseq 
• TIL responses to shared antigens and antigens predicted from exome and RNA sequencing  
• Antigen specific responses using peripheral T cell isolation 
• Multiparameter characterization of PBMC by [CONTACT_4133]  
• Changes in serum cytokines 
• Changes in TGF β signaling in tumor, normal mucosa and skin 
These evaluations may result in descriptive statistics or possibly statistical evaluations of effects. 
I
f any statistical tests are performed, they will be conducted in an exploratory fashion, without 
any adjustment for multiple testing performed but interpreted in the context of the number of tests undertaken.  
11 COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS   
11.1 C
OOPERATIVE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT (CRADA)  
A CRADA ([ZIP_CODE]) is in place with EMD Serono for the supply of M7824. 
A CRADA ([ZIP_CODE]) is in place with ImmunityBio  (previously NantCell) for the supply of N-803. 
A CRADA (0 2997) is in place with ImmunityBio  (previously NantCell)  for the supply of ETBX  
(TriAd) vaccines [ADDRESS_621351] SELECTION  
Subjects from all racial/ethnic groups and both genders are eligible for this study if they meet the  
eligibility criteria. Efforts will be made to extend accrual to a representative population, but in 
this preliminary study, a balance must be struck between patient safety considerations and limitations on the number of individuals exposed to potentially toxic and/or ineffective treatments on one hand and the need to explore gender and ethnic aspects of clinical research on 
the other hand. If differences in outcome that correlate with ethnic identity are noted, accrual 
may be expanded, or a follow -up study may be  written to investigate those differences more 
fully. Participants who do not accept blood transfusions will be excluded. As there is a risk of 
severe bleeding with this study drug, participants must be willing to receive blood transfusions if 
medically necessary for their own safety. Participants must  be able to receive blood transfusions 
67 
Abbreviated Title:  Neoadjuvant IO for HNSCC  
Version Date:  March 26, 2025  
 
in order to minimize the risks of receiving M7824. Another reason for this is that including these 
patients could compromise the scientific validity of the study. For example, death from blood 
loss could make  it difficult to assess other aspects of the investigational immunotherapy’s 
safety —a primary scientific goal in this early -phase immunotherapy trial, which are carried out 
in small numbers of participants.  
12.2 PARTICIPATION OF CHILDREN  
Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of each individual agent in patients <[ADDRESS_621352] benefit from research participation  (section  12.4), al
l subjects ≥ age 18  will be offered the opp ortunity to fill 
in their wishes for research and care, and assign a substitute decision maker on the “NIH Advance Directive for Health Care and Medical Research Participation” form so that another person can make decisions about their medical care in the event that they become incapacitated or cognitively impaired during the course of the study. Note: The PI [INVESTIGATOR_62494]  (ACAT)  for evaluation as needed for the following: an 
independent assessment of whether an individual has the capacity to provide consent; assistance in identifying and assessing an appropriate surrogate when indicated; and/or an assessment of the capacity to appoint a surrogate . For those subjects that become incapacitated and do not have 
pre-determined substitute decision maker, the procedures described in NIH HRPP Policy 403 for 
appointing a surrogate decision maker for adult subjects who are (a) decisionally impaired, and (b) who do not have a legal guardian or durable power of attorney, will be followed.  
12.4 RI
SK/ BENEFITS ASSESSMENT  
Patients will receive evaluation of their disease at the National Cancer Institute’s Clinical Center. This protocol may or may not benefit an individual, but the results may help the investigators learn more about the disease and develop new treatments for patients with this disease.  
Potential adverse reactions attributable to the administration of the treatments utilized in this trial are discussed in section  14. All care will be taken to minimize side effects, but they can be 
unpredictable in nature and severity. Patients will be examined and evaluated prior to enrollment. All evaluations to monitor the treatment of patients will be recorded in the patient chart.  
The potential benefit to a patient that goes onto study is a reduction in the bulk of their tumor w
hich may or may not have favorable impact on symptoms and/or survival.  
Potential risks related to treatment on the window trial include unexpected or expected toxicity 
that may delay or prevent surgical resection, or cause post -operative complications precluding 
or affecting the tolerance of standard of care adjuvant therapy.  
Potential risks and discomforts will also be  minimized to the greatest extent possible by [CONTACT_483483], monitoring, withdrawal of the subject upon evidence of difficulty or adverse event; referral for another treatment, counseling or other 
necessary follow -up.

Abbreviated Title:  Neoadjuvant IO for HNSCC  
Version Date:  March 26, 2025  
 
We anticipate that a thorough discussion of the study at the time informed consent is obtained 
will minimize any susceptibility to undue influences and unnecessary risks to research subjects. 
Although no compensation is available, any injury will be evaluated and treated in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_62495]. In all publications and presentations resulting from this trial, patients’ anonymity will be protected to the maximum extent possible. Authorized personnel from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or other regulatory authorities may have access to research files in order to verify that patients’ rights have been safeguarded.  
12.4.1 Known Potential Risks  
• Research Blood Collection  
Risks of blood draws include pain and bruising in the area where the needle is placed, 
lightheadedness, and rarely, fainting. When large amounts of blood are collected, low red blood cell count (anemia) can develop.  
• Tumor , normal mucosa and skin biops ies 
Risks of tumor biopsy include bleeding, minor discomfort, and infection. Risk of bleeding will be minimized with the use of lidocaine with epi[INVESTIGATOR_483437] (if in the operating room) or silver nitrate (if in the clinic). Discomfort is not a concern if the patient is under general anesthesia and with be minimized in the clinic with the use of injectable  local anesthetic per standard -of-care approaches. Risk of injection with 
biopsies is minimal, but short course of oral antibiotics after biopsies may be provided at the 
discretion of the investigator. Biopsies of tumor and normal mucosa will be performed with sterilized [ADDRESS_621353] of care technique. Suture closure is not required for tumor or normal mucosal biopsies.  
In addition to the risks detailed  in the consent for associated with this protocol, patient s will be 
consented for all tumor, normal mucosa and skin tissue biopsies with a clinical consent form for 
either operative intervention under general anesthesia or for clinic -based procedures under local 
anesthesia.  
• Risks  of the study agents 
Risks include the possible occurrence of any of a range of side effects which are listed in the Consent Document or this protocol document. Frequent monitoring for adverse effects will help to minimize the risks associated with administration of the study agents.  
• Risks due to contrast dye used in CT scans 
If contrast dye is used, there is a risk for allergic reaction to the dye. Patients who are allergic to or sensitive to medications, contrast dye, iodine, or shellfish should notify their physician. Patients with kidney failure or other kidney problems should notify their physician. 
• Nasopharyngo-laryngoscopy  
This procedure takes only a few minutes, is painless and does not require any sedation. It is a 
normal part of an ENT exam.

Abbreviated Title:  Neoadjuvant IO for HNSCC  
Version Date:  March 26, 2025  
 
• Risks due to Radiation 
The study will involve radiation from the following sources:  
• Up to 3 CT scans (Neck  and Chest) per year for disease assessment  
Subjects in this study may be exposed to approximately 0.[ADDRESS_621354] of the time, this amount of 
extra radiation is not harmful to subjects.  However, being exposed to too much radiation can 
cause harmful side effects including a new cancer  in about 1 out of every 1000 people who get a 
very large amount of extra radiation.

should be stored at ≤ -60°C. Receiver must stop the temperature monitoring device by [CONTACT_483487] (instructions for handling and operation of temperature monitoring device will 
be provided with the package).  
14.1.7 ETBX dose preparation and administration 
The dose of ETBX vaccine to be injected is 5x1011 VP per 1mL. Prior to injection, the 
appropriate vial should be removed from the freezer and allowed to thaw at controlled room 
temperature (20 –25°C, 68- 77°F) for at least 20 minutes and not more than 30 minutes, after 
which it should be kept at 2- 8°C (35 –46°F). The vaccine is stable in the vial for at least 8 hours 
after removal from the freezer when kept refrigerated at 2 -8°C (35- 46°F). Once the vaccine has 
been thawed, it must not be refrozen.  
Each vial is sealed with a rubber stopper and has a white flip -off seal. The end user of the 
product will need to flip the white plastic portion of the cap up/off with their thumb to expose the 
rubber stopper and then puncture the stopper with an injection needle to withdraw the liquid. The rubber stopper is secured to the vial with an aluminum -crimped seal.  
The thawed vial should be swirled and then, using aseptic technique, the pharmacist or pharmacist designee should withdraw the appropriate volume from the appropriate vial using an appropriately sized syringe.  
The thawed drug product may be stored at 2 – 8°C in the vial or syringe for a total of up to 8 
hours prior to delivery to the patient, if necessary. Instructions for Dose Preparation – [ADDRESS_621363] by [CONTACT_483488] (refer to the vial label for a description of the vialed ETBX vaccine concentration).

Version Date:  March 26, [ADDRESS_621366] been identified as IRRs including hypersensitivity, irAEs and 
skin lesions with hyperkeratosis, keratoacanthoma, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma possibly 
due to TGF β inhibition. The important identified risks with M7824 (bintrafusp alfa) observed to 
date were overall manageable. Anemia, alterations in wound healing or repair of tissue damage, 
and embryofetal toxicity  remain as important potential risks. Mucosal bleeding events of mild to  
moderate severity were observed in participants treated with M7824 in ongoing studies and are a 
potential risk for  M7824. Events may include epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], hemoptysis, gingival bleeding  or 
hematuria amongst others. In general, these reactions resolve without discontinuation of treatment.   
In addition, after discussion among NCI investigators  on multiple protocols using M7824, 
multiple  bleeding events ranging from low grade gingival bleeding and epi[INVESTIGATOR_483441], GI bleeding and hematuria  have been observed. Some of these events can be 
attributed  to bleeding events related to cancer directly and others bleeding events can be 
attributed to colitis  or cystitis which is a known toxicity of anti -PD-L1 agents including M7824. 
However, there  remains the possibility that M7824 may increase the overall risk of bleeding in 
ways that may not  be directly related to direct tumor bleeding or inflammatory bleeding events 
described with  checkpoint inhibitors like M7824. It is hypothesized that this possible increased 
bleeding risk may  be due to TGF beta inhibition which has an effect on angiogenesis ; bleeding 
has also been observed  in patients receiving M7824 and may be drug- related (e.g., gum bleeding, 
nose bleeds, coughing up blood, blood in their urine, or blood in the stool).  Accordingly, 
patients will be notified of the  same possible risk in the informed consent document for this 
study (e.g., gum bleeding, nose  bleeds, coughing up blood, blood in their urine, or blood in the 
stool). 
Several procedures have been performed on patients receiving M7824 at the NCI and no 
bleeding complications have been reported.

14.2.3 Formulation and Preparation  
M7824 is provided as a sterile liquid formulation and packaged at a 10 mg/mL concentration in 
USP/ Ph Eur type I 50R vials that are filled with drug product solution to allow an extractable volume of 60 mL (600 mg/60 mL). The vials are closed with rubber stoppers in serum format complying with USP and Ph Eur with an aluminum crimp seal closure. Each single -use vial 
contains 600mg of M7824, formulated as 10mg/mL of active, 6% (w/v) Trehalose, 40 mM NaCl, 5 mM Methionine, 0.05% (w/v) Tween 20, 10 mM LHistidine at pH 5.5.  
The liquid formulation is diluted directly with 0.9% sodium chloride solution for injection. The 
estimated volumes of delivery are anticipated to be no more than 250mL. The verified concentration range in the infusion solution is 0.16 mg/mL to 9.6 mg/mL.  
14.2.[ADDRESS_621367] be stored at 2℃  to 8℃  until use. Product stored at room temperature for extended 
periods of time might be subject to degradation. M7824 must not be frozen. Rough shaking of 
the reconstituted solution must be avoided.  
The chemical and physical in -use stability for the infusion solution of M7824 in 0.9% sodium 
chloride for injection has been demonstrated for a total of 72 hours at room temperature; 
however, from a microbiological point of view, the diluted solution should be used immediately and is not intended to be stored unless dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions. No other drugs should be added to the infusion containers containing M7824.

14.3.2 Toxicity  
In patients receiving the 10 mcg/kg subcutaneous injection, the following were reported grade 1 
and 2 toxicities: worsening anemia,  diarrhea , anorexia, nausea/vomiting,  constipation, fatigue, 
fever, peripheral IV infiltration, injection site reactions, pain/aches, sinusitis, hypoalbuminemia, hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, decreased iron, headaches, dysgeusia, atrial fibrillation,  and 
cough. Grade 3 hypertension, atrial fibrillation, neutropenia, and decreased lymphocyte count 
were also reported.  
14.3.3 Formulation and preparation  
N-803 is a soluble complex consisting of two protein subunits of a human IL -15 variant 
associated with high affinity to a dimeric human IL -15 recept or α (IL -15Rα) sushi 
domain/human IgG1 Fc fusion protein. The IL -15 variant is a 114 aa polypeptide comprising the 
mature human IL -15 cytokine sequence with an Asn to Asp substitution at position 72 of helix C 
(N72D). The human IL -15Rα sushi domain/human IgG1 Fc fusion protein comprises the sushi 
domain of the human IL -15 receptor α subunit (IL -15Rα) (aa 1 -65 of the mature human IL -15Rα 
protein) linked with the human IgG1 CH2- CH3 region containing the Fc domain (232 amino 
acids). Aside from the N72D substit ution, all of the protein sequences are human. Based on the 
amino acid sequence of the subunits, calculated molecular weight of complex comprising two 
IL-15N72D polypeptides and a disulfide linked homodimeric IL -15RαSu/IgG1 Fc protein is 92.4 
kilodaltons (kDa). Each IL -15N72D polypeptide has a calculated molecular weight of 
approximately 12.8 kDa and the IL -15RαSu/IgG1 Fc fusion protein has a calculated molecular 
weight of approximately 33.4 kDa. Both the IL -15N72D and IL -15RαSu/IgG1 Fc proteins are 
glycosylated resulting in an apparent molecular weight of N -803 as approximately 113 kDa by 
[CONTACT_115571]. The isoelectric point (pI) determined for N -803 ranges from 
approximately 5.5 to 6.5. Thus, the fusion protein is negatively charged at pH 7. The calculated molar extinction coefficient at A280 for N -803 is 116,540 M -1, or 1.26 OD280 for a 1 mg/mL 
solution of N -803, or one OD280 is equivalent to 0.79 mg/mL solution of N-803.  
The biological drug product, N -803, is formulated in a phosphate buffered saline solution. The 
drug substance is produced by a recombinant mammalian cell line and is manufactured using protein -free media.  
N-803 is supplied in a 2-mL single -dose/single- use vial containing 0.6 mL of N -803 (extractable 
volume is 0.5 mL) at a concentration of 1 mg/mL or 2 mg/mL.   
14.3.4 Stability and storage  
Study medication is provided in a 2mL vial containing 0.6 mL of ALT 803 at a concentration of 
2 mg/mL. Study medication must be maintained at a temperature between 2 ℃ and 8℃ . The 
duration of time during which the product remains stable at room temperature will be obtained from ImmunityBio  (previously NantCell). 
14.3.5 Administration procedures 
N-803 is administered subcutaneously. See section 3.2.4

Background,  Rationale, and Context 
The tra nsversus abdominis plane (TAP) block was  described  in [ADDRESS_583478]  local  anesthetic between  the internal oblique and  transversus  abdominis muscles  where 
the sensory nerves  of the abdominal wall  travel  [1]. The TAP  block can  also be performed  by [CONTACT_456555]. TAP  block has  been  shown to  provide analgesia after  ab-
dominal surgery, decreasing  opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441],  and is widely  accepted  into practice [2].  TAP  block has  
become a cornerstone in  enhanced  recovery  after surgery  programs,  as well  as part of multi-
modal analgesia,  and opi[INVESTIGATOR_456539]. A recent  meta -analysis  of Randomized  
Controlled Trials  (RCT)  comparing TAP  block with  bupi[INVESTIGATOR_456540]  
[3]. Liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_456541] a longer 
duration of analgesia (up  to 72 hours) by [CONTACT_456556].  A 
recent  systematic  review  comparing liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_456542],  including TAP  blocks, showed conflicting  results  so no definitive  
conclusions could be made [4].  It is unclear  if liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_456543]-
caine for TAP  blocks in  bariatric  surgery.  Our study would be the first  RCT  comparing laparo-
scopic TAP  block with  liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_456544]  a bariatric  surgery  popula-
tion.  
Objectives  
Compared  to only B upi[INVESTIGATOR_456545], we  will investigate  the anal-
gesia effects  to patients  undergoing metabolic  and bariatric  surgery  receiving  TAP  block with  a 
Liposomal Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_291203].      
Primary  Objective : To determine  if patients  undergoing metabolic  and bariatric  surgery  
receiving  TAP  block with  a Liposomal Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_456546],  as measured  by [CONTACT_456557] (VAS),  that are equivalent  compared  to patients  receiving  TAP  block with  Bupi-
vacaine only.  
Primary  Hypothesis: 
1)Lower  values  of the outcome variable VAS  are desirable,  and the hypothesis
is listed  below –
Bariatric  Exparel  TAP Block  Study  Date:  8/4/2023 
2 Hypothesis 1. 1  
𝐻𝐻0:  𝜇𝜇 𝐸𝐸−𝜇𝜇𝑆𝑆  ≥ 𝛿𝛿  (Study group is  different  compared  to the active 
control group      by 𝛿𝛿 or more)  
𝐻𝐻1:  𝜇𝜇 𝐸𝐸−𝜇𝜇𝑆𝑆  <𝛿𝛿 (Study group is  equivalent to  the active control when  
difference is  within  prespecified  𝛿𝛿) 
Where 𝜇𝜇𝐸𝐸, 𝜇𝜇𝑆𝑆  are the population means for the outcome VAS  measured  at 24 
hours after  surgery  for the study group (E) and the standard (S) active group, re-
spectively  𝛿𝛿 is non- inferiority  margin,  specified  in advance based  on clinical  judgement. 
Based  on our clinical  experience,  𝛿𝛿 = 1.5 
Secondary  Objectives:  Compared  to TAP  block with  Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_274711], we  will compare 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], and  other effect  differences  to patients  undergoing metabolic  and bariatric 
surgery  receiving  TAP  block with  Liposomal Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319].      
Secondary  Hypotheses 
Hypothesis 2.1 – Patients  undergoing metabolic  and bariatric  surgery  receiving  
TAP  block with  Liposomal Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_456547]-
tal discharge /during the first 48 hours postoperatively as  measured  in morphine equiva-
lents  (mg) compared  to patients  receiving  simply  TAP  block with  Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_274711].  
Hypothesis 2.2 - Patients  undergoing metabolic  and bariatric  surgery  receiving  
TAP  block with  Liposomal Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_456548]-
logic scale (VAS) at  12 hours after  surgery  that are equivalent compared  to patients  re-
ceiving  TAP  block with  Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_274711].  
Exploratory objectives : We will explore other effects,  including pain  score  at [ADDRESS_583479] at  Atrium Health,  an academic medical  center.  
Subjects  selection  criteria  
Bariatric  Exparel  TAP Block  Study    Date:  8/4/[ADDRESS_583480] meet  all the following 
criteria:  
1. Adult, age > [ADDRESS_583481]  deviation  for each  
group is  3, the margin  of equivalence is  1.5 on NRS,  and the true  difference  between  the two  
groups is  0 on the NRS.  Group sample  size of  88 from  each  group achieves  90% power to  detect  
our prespecified  equivalence margins, with  alpha of 0.05.  Assuming a 20% dropout or with-
drawal  based  upon previous experience,  106 subjects  per group will be required.    
 
Interventions  and Interactions  
 There will be two  groups: (1) active control and  (2) study group. Active  control group pa-
tients  receive TAP  block with  a Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_456549],  containing 50 mL  0.5% Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319],  
and 100 mL  normal saline  solution. Study group patients  will receive TAP  block with  a Liposo-
mal Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_291203],  containing 20 mL  Liposomal Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319],  30 mL  0.5% Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319],  
and [ADDRESS_583482] port is  
placed  upon laparoscopy. Type of anesthesia administered  will also  be standardized  including 
the use of narcotics,  lidocaine,  inhalational anesthesia and  Ketamine.  
 Randomization schedules will be generated  by [CONTACT_78718]  9.4 (SAS  Institute  Inc., Cary,  NC)  by 
[CONTACT_2329] a masked  block randomization  procedure. Eligible  patients  will be randomized  with  a 1:1 
ratio between  the 2 groups of patients  receiving  TAP  block Exparel  mixture  or simply  bupi[INVESTIGATOR_100214]-
caine administered  via TAP  block. Research  Electronic Data Capture (REDCap)  randomization 
Bariatric  Exparel  TAP Block  Study    Date:  8/4/2023 
4 module will be used  to manage randomization and  allocate treatment groups. The  allocation  se-
quence will be concealed  with  application  of the REDCap.   
 
Outcome Measure(s)  
Primary  Outcome measures  
1. Pain score at  [ADDRESS_583483]- operative,  using visual analogue scale (VAS),  ranging 
from  [ADDRESS_583484]-operative nausea and  vomiting  (PONV)  measured  by a numerical  score (1:  no 
nausea or vomiting, 2: some nausea no vomiting, 3: nausea and  vomiting) 
5. Length of stay  in hours 
6. Patient  satisfaction  score  
These parameters  will be scored  via SeamlessMD  on a phone application, as  well  as pa-
per and pen on a standardized  reporting  form  for patients  less comfortable using technology. 
Data will also  be collected  from  patient  electronic  charts.   
 
Analytical Plan  
 Equivalency test  with  priori  specified  non- inferiority  region will be used  to assess pri-
mary  outcome variables.  
Descriptive  statistics  (mean,  range,  percentage,  median, etc.)  will be used  to assess the quality  
and accuracy  of the administrative  and clinical  data.  Means  with  standard deviations or medians  
with interquartile  range (IQR) will be reported  for continuous variables  and percentages  for cate-
gorical  variables.  Missing  data will be evaluated  prior to  data modeling. General  linear  regres-
sion, or other generalized  linear  regression  models will be used  to compare the outcomes be-
tween  the two  groups with  both univariate or multivariate  analyses.  Potential confounders will be 
identified  with  univariate analysis.  For univariate analyses,  a Student’s t- test or Wilcoxon two -
sample  test will be used  for continuous variables,  and chi-square test  for categorical  variables  
against  the primary  and secondary  outcomes. Both unadjusted and  adjusted  odds ratio  (OR) with  
Bariatric  Exparel  TAP Block  Study    Date:  8/4/2023 
5 corresponding 95% confidence interval  (CI)  will be  reported. Two -tailed  p values  will be calcu-
lated  for all  tests,  and p< 0.05 is  considered  statistically  significant.  All data  will be analyzed  us-
ing Statistical Analysis Software,  version  9.4 (SAS  Institute  Inc., Cary,  NC).  
There are no plans for interim data analyses.  Analyses  will be conducted according to  per-proto-
col (PP)  principle. 
 
Human  Subjects  Protection  
Subject  Recruitment  Methods  
Patients  who  are scheduled  for sleeve gastrectomy  or roux- en-y gastric  by[CONTACT_456558]-
operative visit.  The bariatric  surgeons and  bariatric surgery  fellows  will do the recruiting, and  pa-
tients  will be contact[CONTACT_456559]. Patients  
will also  receive a written  flyer  containing information about the study during the preoperative 
visit.  As all qualifying patients  will be informed  about the study during the preoperative visit,  ac-
cess to participation  among  women  and minorities  will depend on how many  of these patients  
undergo sleeve gastrectomy  or roux- en-y gastric  by[CONTACT_456560].  Subject’s  privacy  will 
be protected  by [CONTACT_456561]. Data will be stored  on a password  protected  computer of the investigator 
and in a password protected  RedCap  database.  
 
Informed  Consent  
Signed informed  consent will be obtained from  each  subject.  The investigators as  well  as the 
other bariatric surgeons and bariatric  surgery  fellows  will obtain informed  consent at  the Atrium 
Health  Weight  Management  clinics  during the preoperative visit.  
 
Confidentiality  and Privacy  
Confidentiality  will be protected  by [CONTACT_456562]-
comes,  minimizing  to the fullest extent  possible the collection  of any  information  that could di-
rectly  identify  subjects,  and maintaining  all study information in  a secure manner.  To help  ensure 
subject  privacy  and confidentiality, only a unique study identifier  will appear  on the data collec-
tion form.  Any  collected  patient  identifying information  corresponding to  the unique study iden-
tifier  will be maintained  on a linkage file,  store  separately  from  the data.  The linkage file  will be 
kept secure,  with  access  limited  to designated  study personnel. Following data collection  subject  
identifying information  will be destroyed (state  the anticipated  time  the data will be destroyed, 
e.g. three years  after closure of the study, and  the method of destruction), consistent with  data 
validation  and study design, producing an  anonymous analytical  data set.  Data access  will be 
limited  to study staff.  Data and  records  will be kept locked  and secured,  with  any computer data 
Bariatric  Exparel  TAP Block  Study    Date:  8/4/[ADDRESS_583485] protected. No  reference to  any individual participant  will appear  in reports,  presenta-
tions, or publications that  may  arise from  the study.

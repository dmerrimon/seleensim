1 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
  
1.1 Introduction:  
 
Eight- million  (16%) U.S. children have a Behavior Disorder (BD), which is linked to a ten-fold increase in education, 
health care, and criminal justice costs. Early intervention is thus critical, yet outcomes for the standard of care, 
Behavioral Parent Training (BPT) , vary suggesting the likelihood of a yet to be identified underlying mechanism . 
One likely candidate, emotion regulation (ER), has been implicated in a broad range of adult and child outcomes, 
including early -onset BDs. For example, parental difficulties with ER, as well as difficulties helpi[INVESTIGATOR_690123]  (i.e., emotion socialization), are linked to the etiology, maintenance, and severity 
of early -onset BDs. As such, this NIMH Exploratory and Developmental Research Grant (Par ent R21) aims to 
further explore the ER in the context of BPT process and outcomes.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_936298] or Intervention: 
 
Behavioral Parent Training (BPT) is the well -established, standard of care treatment for  early -onset BDs .  Both a 
parent and the target child attend sessions which focus on parents learning, practicing and effectively using new 
skills to manage child behavior.  Phase I skills focus on teaching parents to provid e positive attention to behaviors 
they want to i ncrease and Phase II focuses on improving child compliance by [CONTACT_690128]. Treatment is an average of  8-12 weeks. This study is exploring the mechanisms 
underlying BPT.  
 
1.3 Non-Clinical and Clinical Study Findings :  
 
BPT is the recommend first line of treatment and standard of care for early -onset BDs. Therefore, the probability 
and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in and of themselves than those 
ordinarily encountered if families were seeking psychological services in the community.  In turn, the benefit of 
improving child behavior outweigh risks.  
 
1.4 Relevant Literature and Data:  
 
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], so it will serve as preliminary data for future work.  
 
2 STUDY OBJECTIVE   
 
2.1 Primary Objective:  
 
Describe patterns of child behavior and emotion regulatory processes in BPT . 
 
2.2 Secondary Objective:   
 
Use preliminary results t o inform future research on BPT adaptations . 
 
3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN (brief overview)

3.3 Study Duration, Enrollment and Number of Subjects :  
 
N = 45  children ;  
Each child participates in BPT treatment with a parent for an average of 10 weeks (M = 8 to 12) ;

7 STUDY INTERVENTION (drug, device or other intervention  details ) 
 Behavioral Parent Training is the recommend first line of treatment and standard of care for early -onset BDs.  Both 
 a parent and the target child attend sessions which focus on parents learning, practicing and effectively using new 
 skills to manage child behavior.  Phase I skills focus on teaching parents to provide positive attention to behaviors

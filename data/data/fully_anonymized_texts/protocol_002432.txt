Title of Study: A Phase 1 Dose Escalation and Cohort Expansion Study of TSR -033, an Anti -LAG -3 
Monoclonal Antibody, Alone and in Combination With an Anti -PD-1 in Patients With Advanced Solid 
Tumors  
Study Center(s): Up to 10 sites in Part 1 and up to 20 sites in Part 2  
Studied period (years):  
Estimated date first patient enrolled: July [ADDRESS_616316] patient completed: May 2021  Phase of development: 1 
 
Proposal/Rationale: The recognition of tumors by [CONTACT_479852]. 
Studies have reported the presence of tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) as a positive  prognostic 
feature in multiple tumors, supporting a role for the immune system in limiting tumor growth. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_479826], tumors are able to grow in the presence of an immune system, 
suggesting a suboptimal innate immune response.  
Emerging research into this inadequate immune response has identified an important family of proteins 
that play key roles in immune checkpoint pathways, regulatory cascades that ordinarily maintain 
immune homeostasis, but are co -opted by [CONTACT_479853]. Prominent proteins within this immune checkpoint family include 
programmed cell death receptor (PD -1), associated with immune system downregulation and self -
tolerance, and lymphocyt e activation gene -3 (LAG -3) which is widely associated with exhausted or 
dysfunctional T cells that show varying degrees of functional impairment in the context of chronic 
antigen exposure . 
To date, PD -1 has been a popular development target of anti -cancer  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_479827], there remains a large number of patients who 
derive little clinical benefit from this treatment approach (primary resistance) or suffer a relapse post -
treatment (acquired or adaptive immune resistance). To potentially engender a stronger and more 
durable anti -tumor response, it is thought that a combined treatment approach that targets both PD -1 and 
LAG -3, complementary immune pathways in intrinsic tumor -cell resistance, ma y be successful. This 
belief is bolstered by [CONTACT_479854] (MLR) assay and efficacy in 
syngeneic tumor models, which, taken together, provide a rationale for combination therapy with anti -
PD-1 and anti -LAG -3 antibodies i n cancer . 
Two such therapeutic antibodies that target PD -1 and LAG -3 are dostarlimab  and TSR -033, 
respectively. Dostarlimab is a potent humanized immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) κ monoclonal antibody 
(mAb) that binds to PD -1 and blocks the interaction between PD -1 and its ligands, programmed cell 
death ligand -1 (PD -L1) and programmed cell death ligand -2 (PD -L2). The functional antagonist activity 
of dostarlimab  was confirmed in a MLR assay demonstrating enhanced interleukin -2 (IL -2) production 
upon addition of dostarlimab . Dostarlimab  is being studied as monotherapy and in combination in 
several tumor types to evaluate its safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics 
(PDy), and clinical activity in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumo rs. TSR -033 is a potent 
and selective humanized IgG4κ mAb that will undergo dose -limiting studies and safety and tolerability

 assessment in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors, both alone and in combination with 
dostarlimab , in Part 1 of this  study . 
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide and remains a deadly 
disease (second most common cause of cancer death in the U nited States [US] ) despi[INVESTIGATOR_479828]1, which include the current standard of care (SOC), chemotherapy with or without 
anti-angiogenic antibodies or anti -epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR) antibodies2 as first - and 
second -line regimens. In the U S, although the incidence rate of CRC in adults aged ≥50 years has 
declined in recent decades, it has increased by 13% in those aged <50 years.  In addition, if the disease 
progresses to become metastatic CRC (mCRC), it is usually incurable.  While colorectal cancers with 
microsatellite instability are frequently sensitive to check point inhibitor therapy, they make up only 
about 3% of patients wit h metastatic disease.[ADDRESS_616317] not yet been repli cated in the remaining 97% 
of patients whose mCRC is microsatellite stable CRC (MSS -CRC). Therefore, MSS -CRC remains an 
area of great and urgent medical need . 
Based on the growing body of evidence from preclinical models, the anti -tumor effects of conventional 
chemotherapy, used as part of the SOC in CRC, are derived not only from direct tumor cell killing, but 
also from increased priming of the immune response. This can occur through immunogenic cell death 
(ICD) which (a) releases a host of antigen s/neoantigens and highly immunostimulatory molecules 
which attract leukocytes and (b) stimulat es a type I interferon response which promotes improved 
antigen presentation and T cell activation. This suggests that chemotherapy can synergize with 
checkpoint blockade pathways to boost tumor immunosurveillance and improve anti -tumor efficacy. By 
[CONTACT_479855], immunotherapy may therefore add a complementary and distinct 
mechanism of action to the currently utilized standard chemotherapeutic and biologic regimens used to 
treat CRC. Therefore, immunotherapeutic agents warrant further investigation in the clinic to test the 
hypothesis that the combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy can synergistically potentiate 
antitumor responses in pat ients with MSS -CRC.  
Among the cytotoxic chemotherapy choices for CRC, oxaliplatin - and irinotecan -based chemotherapy 
regimens are most commonly utilized, with clinical outcomes improved by [CONTACT_479856] (VEGF) or its receptor (VEGFR) in appropriate 
patients .[ADDRESS_616318] to oxaliplatin -based regimens, FOLFOX and its v ariants ( ie, modified FOLFOX6 
[mFOLFOX6], FOLFOX4) remain popular and are used globally.5,6 FOLFOX consists of folinic acid 
(FOL) or leucov orin, 5 -fluorouracil (F), and oxaliplatin (OX). mFOLFOX6, given with or without 
bevacizumab (anti -VEGF mAb),  is by [CONTACT_479857], clinically and in studies, 
for first -line therapy in CRC.7 An alternative 3 -drug combination is FOLFIRI, which consists of 
irinotecan (IRI) in addition to FOL and F.[ADDRESS_616319] to 
overall survival (OS)6, the oxaliplatin -based regi mens are utilized more frequently than irinotecan -based 
regimens in the first -line metastatic setting globally. In the second -line metastatic setting, a number of 
contemporary trials have established reliable benchmarks for overall response rates and progr ession -free 
survival (PFS), as well as OS, with FOLFOX - or FOLFIRI -based regimens. Taken together, the overall 
response rate with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI chemotherapy with or without biologics appears to be modest 
in CRC, in the 4% to 15% range.6,9,10,11,12,13,14 
Beyond second -line therapy, TAS -102, an oral fluoropyrimidine analogue and thymidine phosphorylase 
inhibitor, has demonstrated an improvement of OS by 1.8 months in patients with refractory disease

versus 5.0 months [HR ratio 0.77; 95% CI 0.64 to 0.94; one -sided p=0.0052 ).19 Finally, immunotherapy 
with checkpoint i nhibitors as monotherapy appears to be active only in patients with microsatellite 
instability –high (MSI -H) or mismatch repair –deficient (dMMR) CRC.20,[ADDRESS_616322] - or fourth -line MSS -CRC. Part 2B will assess the safety profile and 
initial efficacy of mFOLFOX6 (Cohort B1) or FOLFIR I (Cohort B2) plus bevacizumab in combination 
with TSR -[ADDRESS_616323]-line regimen.20

 Overall Study Schema  
 
Abbreviations: CRC=colorectal cancer; DLT=dose -limiting toxicity; mg=milligrams; MSS=microsatellite stable; 
PDy=pharmacodynamics; PK=pharmacokinetics; Q2W=every 2 weeks; Q3W=every 3 weeks; Q6W=every 6 weeks; 
RP2D=recommended Phase 2 dose . 
a Approximately 72 patients in Parts 1a, 1b and 1c are expected, but this may increase to approximately 132  patients in total if 
the Sponsor and Investigators determine that additional safety and/or PK/ PDy data are needed to confirm the RP2D for 
monotherapy. These enrollment numbers could increase if the Sponsor, in consultation with the Investigator, determine that 
additional cohorts consisting of 6 -12 patients are needed to examine additional dose levels. At any dose level, where DLTs 
were observed in less than ⅓ of patients, in Part 1b, up to 6 additional patients may be enrolled to enable a better 
characterization of the PK/ PDy data in order to confirm the RP2D. These enrollment numbers could further increase if the 
Sponsor , in consultation with the Investigators determine that an intermediate dose level(s), consisting of approximately 
6 patients requires exploration to better understand PK/ PDy. 
b The starting dose of TSR -[ADDRESS_616332] dose at 
which <⅓ of 6 -12 patients experienced DLTs with single -agent TSR -033. 
c Doses presented in the schema represent the planned TSR -033 dose levels (subject to change based on safety and/or PK/P Dy 
data). Dostarlimab wi ll be given at a dose of 500 mg (Q3W) in Part 1c and 1000 mg Q6W in Part 2 of the study. These 
enrollment numbers could increase if the Sponsor, in consultation with the Investigator, determine that additional cohorts 
consisting of 6 -12 patients are needed  to examine additional dose levels.  
d Part 2 will enroll 2 disease -specific cohorts: Cohort A (third - or fourth -line MSS -CRC) and Cohort B (second -line 
MSS -CRC).  The opening of enrollment of the expansion cohorts may not be simultaneous and is dependent on  emerging data 
from ongoing studies.

 <[ADDRESS_616355] preliminary efficacy data . 
Part 2 Cohort B2: Initially, a 6 -patient run -in with FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab regimen will be tested 
for safety, with the potential to add 6 additional patients, for a total of 12 patients. The DLT observation 
period will be from Dose 1, Day 1, through Dose 3, Day 3, prior to the start of infusion. Following the 
DLT observation period, if ≥2 DLTs are observed, a dose level reduction of TSR -033 to 240 mg can be 
considered (dose le vel -1). This dose level would then enroll 6 patients. Alternatively, if <[ADDRESS_616356] 6 patients, such that an additional 6 to 18 may be enrolled. The total for Part 2B as a whole 
remains at 24.  
Please refer to the Pharmacy Manual for details on the preparation and administration of the infusion 
solutions for TSR -033 and dostarlimab . 
mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI and TSR -033 will be given on a Q2W schedule and dostarlimab  on a Q6W 
schedule.  
The full infusion s chedule will be as follows:  
Part 2 Cohort B1:  Infusion times (per dose cycle):  
Note: Infusion times described below a re approximate.  
1. Bevacizumab (Day 1): 30 -minute infusion, unless a longer schedule was previously tolerated;

Duration of Treatment:  
Planned Study Conduct Duration:  Approximately 42 months (time from first patient enrolled until 
study cut -off [when responder or discontinuation status for all patients is known]).  
Planned Study Treatment Duration: Enrolled patients may continue study treatment for up to 2 years or 
until PD, unacceptable toxicity, patient withdrawal, Investigator’s decision, or death. Continued study 
treatment beyond 2 years may be considered followi ng discussion between the Sponsor and 
Investigator.  
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Pharmacokinetics:  
Serum samples for PK determination will be collected prior to, during, and after treatment with 
TSR-033 alone or in combination with dostarlimab , and the dual i mmunotherapy regimen in 
combination with chemotherapy and bevacizumab as described in the protocol.  
Serum samples for ADA assessments will be collected prior to, during, and after treatment with  
TSR-033 alone or in combination with dostarlimab , and the dual immunotherapy regimen in 
combination with chemotherapy and bevacizumab. Results of ADA assays (screening, confirmation, 
and neutralizing antibody  [NAb] ) will be correlated with clinical activity, PK, as well as safety 
assessments . 
Pharmacodynamics:  
During Part 1 and Part 2, blood cells may be assessed for LAG -3 receptor occupancy according to the 
schedule detailed in  the protocol . 
In addition, these analyses may include, but are not limited to, assessing changes in circulating immune 
cells, serum cytok ines, ctDNA, and soluble LAG -3 to better characterize the clinical activity of  
TSR-033 and may be considered for selection of the RP2D.  
Safety:  
Safety assessments conducted throughout the  treatment period in clude symptom -directed physical 
examinations, AE  and DLT assessment, vi tal signs, electrocardiograms ( ECGs), ECOG PS, and clinical 
laboratory assessments, including complete blood count  (CBC) with 5 -part differential , coagulation 
factors,  chemistry, thyroid panel ( ie, thyroid -stimulating hormone [TSH] , triiodothyronine [T3], free

[ADDRESS_616376] reported 
the presence of tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) as a positive prognostic feature in multiple 
tumors, supporting a role for the immune system in limiting tumor growth. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_479832] e reactivity, tumors are able to grow in the presence of an immune system, suggesting a 
suboptimal immune response.  
Emerging research into this inadequate immune response has identified an important family of 
proteins that play key roles in immune checkpoint pathways, regulatory cascades that ordinarily 
maintain immune homeostasis, but are co -opted by [CONTACT_479860]. Prominent proteins within this immune 
checkpoint family include lymphocyte activation gene ( LAG -3) and programmed cell death -1 
receptor ( PD-1), which are widely associated with exhausted or dysfunctional T cells that show 
varying degrees of functional impairment in the context of chronic antigen exposure and are 
associated with immune system downregulation and self -tolerance . 
1.1.1.  Lymphocyte Activation Gene -[ADDRESS_616377] identifie d on activated T cells and a subset of natural killer cells. Its engagement 
on T cells results in the attenuation of T cell signaling and reduced effector function, and it has 
thus been implicated in limiting anti -tumor immunity.23,24 LAG -3, along with other co -inhibitory 
receptors ( eg, PD-1, T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin -domain containing -3 receptor [TIM -3]) 
is widely associated with exhausted or dysfunctional T cells, which show varying degrees of 
functional impairment in the context of chronic antigen exposure.25 
[IP_ADDRESS].  TSR -033 
TSR-033 is a potent and selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the 
immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) κ isotype that binds to human and cynomolgus monkey LAG -3 with 
high affinity and blo cks the binding of LAG -3 to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class 
II-expressing Daudi cells. Functionally, as a single agent, TSR -033 enhances T cell activation (as 
determined by [CONTACT_13204] -2 [IL -2]) in a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) with a half -maximal 
effective concentration of approximately 2 nM. Furthermore, the combination of TSR -033 with 
an anti -PD-1 antibody increased T cell activation in this assay, resulting in a 5 - to 10 -fold 
increase in potency of the combination versus TSR -033 alone. These data, together with other 
nonclinical data, support the evaluation of TSR -033 as a monotherapy, and in combination with 
anti-PD-1, in cancer patients . 
Please refer to the current version of the Tesaro TSR -033 Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for further 
nonclinical and clinical details about this investigational product.  
1.1.2.  Programmed Cell Death -1 Protein  
Initial exploration of T cell activation in chronic viral models suggested that chronic viral 
infections led to a state of T cell hypo -responsiveness, term ed T cell exhaustion, and involved

36 
 immune inhibitory receptors expressed by T cells .25,26 One of the proteins shown to be mediating 
T cell exhaustion in chronic viral models and subsequently tumor models was PD -1. The 
discovery and characterization of PD -1 revealed that PD -1 limits T  cell activation through 
binding to programmed death ligand -1 (PD -L1) and programmed death ligand -2 (PD -L2) and 
limiting tyrosine kinase signaling from the T cell antigen receptor and co -stimulatory 
receptors.27,28 
The identification of PD -L1 as the ligand for PD -1 was followed by [CONTACT_479861]-L1 expression by [CONTACT_479862].29 These data led to the hypothesis that 
PD-1/PD -L1 may be exploited to s ubvert the anti -tumor immune response. Nonclinical models 
where PD -1 signaling was blocked or deficient (PD -1 knockout mice) demonstrated improved 
immune -mediated tumor control.30,31 Thus, PD -1/PD -L1 represented an immune inhibi tory 
mechanism employed by [CONTACT_479863] T cells.  
These nonclinical experiments led to the evaluation of anti -PD-[ADDRESS_616378] immunotherapeutic approaches.32 Activity was demonstrated in 
tumors known to be responsive to i mmunotherapy, such as melanoma and renal cell carcinoma 
(RCC), as well as lung tumors which were traditionally insensitive to immunotherapy, like 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This led to intense interest in PD -1/PD -L1 blockade in 
multiple tumor type s resulting in the development of specific antibodies that block PD -[ADDRESS_616379] received

pembrolizumab are distin ct antibodies, the safety profiles are very similar across therapi[INVESTIGATOR_479833] -1 was well -tolerated with manageable 
immune -related adverse events (irAEs) being the most noteworthy .

Dostarlimab  is being studied as monotherapy and in combination in several tumor types to 
evaluate its safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics ( PDy), and 
clinical activity in patients with advanced o r metastatic solid tumors . 
Dose escalation of dostarlimab  as monotherapy continued to a maximally administered dose of 
10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W); no dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed and a 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached. Flat d oses of 500  mg every 3 weeks (Q3W) 
and 1000  mg every 6 weeks (Q6W) were also evaluated for safety in cohorts of 6 patients each

AEs Grade ≥3. These included Grade 3 or 4 elevated lipase, elevated amylase, colitis, 
dehydration, dyspnea, aseptic meningitis, mucosal inflammation, elevated troponin, and 
ventricular  fibrillation (in one patient each). One patient treated at a dose of BMS -986016 
240 mg + nivolumab 240 mg experienced Grade 5 myocarditis; this patient had a history of heart 
disease.  Preliminary evidence of clinical benefit was observed in patients with melanoma, 
NSCLC, cervical cancer, anal cancer, and cholangiocarcinoma . 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_479834] -1/PD -L1 checkpoint inhibitors, there remain 
large numbers of patients who derive little clinical benefit from such therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (primary 
resistance) or suffer a relapse (acquired or adaptive immune resistance) .[ADDRESS_616383] tumor cell killing, but also from 
increased priming of the immune response.48 This can occur through immunogenic cell death 
(ICD) which (a) releases a host of antigens/neoantigens as well as highly immunostimulatory 
molecules which attract leukocytes and (b) stimulation of a type I interferon response which 
promotes improve d antigen presentation and T cell activation .[ADDRESS_616384] the hypothesis that the co mbination of 
immunotherapy and chemotherapy can synergistically potentiate antitumor responses. This idea 
will be studied in Part 2 of the current protocol, investigating the efficacy of TSR -033 and 
dostarlimab  therapy in combination with chemotherapy in p atients with advanced or metastatic 
colorectal cancer (CRC) (see Section  1.2.3 ). 
1.2.3.  Rationale for Selection of Expansion Cohorts  
CRC is one of the most common malignancies worldwide and remains a deadly disease (second 
most common cause of cancer death in the U nited States [US] ) despi[INVESTIGATOR_479835]1, which include the current standard of care (SOC), chemotherapy with or without anti -
angiogenic antibodies or anti -epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR) antibodies2 as first - and 
second -line regimens. In the US, although the incidence rate of CRC in adults aged ≥50 years 
has declined in recent decades, it has increased by 13% in those aged <50 years. In addition, if 
the disease progresses to become metastatic CRC (mCRC), it is usually incurable.  While 
colorectal  cancers with microsatellite instability are frequently are frequently sensitive to check 
point inhibitor therapy, they make up only about 3% of patients with metastatic disease.[ADDRESS_616385] to many other areas of cancer therapy, the advances achieved with

[ADDRESS_616386] not yet been replicated in the remaining 97% of patients whose mCRC is 
microsatellite stable CRC (MSS -CRC). Therefore , MSS -CRC remains an area of great and 
urgent medical need . 
Among the cytotoxic chemotherapy choices for CRC, oxaliplatin - and irinotecan -based 
chemotherapy regimens are most commonly utilized, with clinical outcomes improved by [CONTACT_479864] (VEGF) or its 
receptor (VEGFR) in appropriate patients .[ADDRESS_616387] to oxa liplatin -based regimens, FOLFOX 
and its variants ( ie, modified FOLFOX6 [mFOLFOX6], FOLFOX4) remain popular and are used

oxaliplatin (OX). mFOLFOX6, given with or without bevacizumab (anti -VEGF mAb),  is by [CONTACT_479865], clinically and in studies, for first -line therapy in CRC.7 An

(OS)6, the oxaliplatin -based regimens are utilized more frequently than irinotecan -based 
regimens in the first -line metastatic setting globally. In the second -line m etastatic setting, a 
number of contemporary trials have established reliable benchmarks for overall response rates 
and progression -free survival (PFS), as well as OS, with FOLFOX - or FOLFIRI -based regimens. 
Taken together, the overall response rate with FO LFOX or FOLFIRI chemotherapy with or

PDy=pharmacodynamics; PK =pharmacokinetics; Q2W =every 2 weeks; Q3W =every 3 weeks; Q6W =every 6 weeks; 
RP2D =recommended Phase 2 dose . 
a Approximately 72 patients in Parts 1a, 1b and 1c are expected, but this may increase to approximately 132 patients 
in total if the Sponsor and Investigators determine that additional safety and/or PK/PDy data are needed to confirm 
the RP2D for mo notherapy. These enrollment numbers could increase if the Sponsor, in consultation with the 
Investigator, determine that additional cohorts consisting of 6 -12 patients are needed to examine additional dose 
levels. At any dose level, where DLTs were observe d in less than ⅓ of patients, in Part 1b, up to 6 additional 
patients may be enrolled to enable a better characterization of the PK/PDy data in order to confirm the RP2D. These 
enrollment numbers could further increase if the Sponsor, in consultation with the Investigators determine that an 
intermediate dose level(s), consisting of approximately 6 patients requires exploration to better understand PK/PDy.

c Doses presented in the schema represent the planned TSR -033 dose levels (subject to change based on safety 
and/or PK/PDy data). dostar limab  will be given at a dose of 500 mg (Q3W) in Part 1c and 1000 mg Q6W in Part 2 
of the study. These enrollment numbers could increase if the Sponsor, in consultation with the Investigator, 
determine that additional cohorts consisting of 6 -12 patients ar e needed to examine additional dose levels.  
d Part 2 will enroll 2 disease -specific cohorts: Cohort A (third - or fourth -line MSS -CRC) and Cohort B (second -line 
MSS -CRC).  The opening of enrollment of the expansion cohorts may not be simultaneous and is dependent on 
emerging data from ongoing studies .

 3.1.1.  DLT Criteria  
DLT Criteria for assessments in Part 1a, 1c, and 2B (unless noted) include treatment -related 
adverse events (T RAEs) as detailed below:  
• Grade ≥2 uveitis, eye pain, or blurred vision that does not resolve with topi[INVESTIGATOR_479836] 2 weeks.  
• Grade ≥2 immune -related endocrine toxicity that requires hormone replacement 
(except Grade 2 thyroiditis or thyroid dysfunction ). 
• Grade 2 or 3 colitis or diarrhea that persists without resolution to Grade ≤1 for ≥7 
days despi[INVESTIGATOR_479837].  
• Grade 3 or 4 irAE without resolution to Grade ≤1 or baseline within 8 days despi[INVESTIGATOR_479838]  5.6.4  and Table  3. 
• Any Grade clinically significant irAE ( eg, myocarditis, encephalitis) requiring 
treatment discontinuation.  
• Any other Grade ≥3 non -hematologic clinical (non -laboratory) toxicity excluding:  
− Nausea and vomiting resolving to Grade ≤1 within 48 hours.  
− Grade 3 fatigue wit h duration <7 days.  
− In Part 2B, events deemed by [CONTACT_479867] . 
• Any clinically -significant Grade ≥3 non -hematologic laboratory abnormality . 
• Any clinic ally-significant hematologic toxicity specifically defined as:  
− Grade 4 thrombocytopenia for ≥7 days, or Grade 3 or 4 associated with bleeding 
or requiring platelet transfusion.  
− Grade 4 neutropenia for ≥7 days, or Grade 3 or 4 associated with infection or 
febrile neutropenia.  
− Grade 4 anemia, or Grade 3 requiring blood transfusion.  
• Any death that is not clearly attributed to the underlying disease or extraneous causes.  
Treatment -related toxicity is defined as an AE that is not clearly attributable to other ca uses ( eg, 
PD or a pre -existing medical condition). Toxicities will be assessed according to the CTCAE 
v5.0. If multiple toxicities occur, the presence of DLT will be graded based on the most severe 
toxicity observed . 
At the end of the respective DLT observ ation periods, each patient must be assessed by [CONTACT_479868] a DLT to confirm the patient may continue 
treatment. Patients who experience DLTs may be considered for continuing treatment given the 
appropriate clinic al context ( eg, may continue treatment if a transient Grade 3 laboratory 
abnormality is asymptomatic and otherwise unremarkable) following discussion between the 
Investigators and Sponsor.

Abbreviations: DLT =dose limiting toxicity; Q2W =every 2 weeks.  
At any dose level, an initial 3 or 6 patients will be enrolled , then:  
• If the observed DLT rate is <⅓, the dose may be escalated.  
• If the observed DLT rate is >⅓, no further dose escalation will be considered, and this 
dose level will be considered the maximum administered dose (MAD) . 
• If the observed DLT rate is ⅓, the Sponsor may enroll up to 6 additional patients 
following discussion with the Investigators . 
− If the observed DLT rate in a total cohort of 9 to 12 patients is >⅓, no further dose 
escalation will be considered, and this dose level will be considered the MAD . 
The MTD will be considered the dose one level below the MAD if ≥⅓ of patients experience 
DLTs, or, at MAD if <⅓ of patients experience DLTs.  
Accordingly, the RP2D may be at the MAD or 1 dose level below the MAD. Alternativ ely, an 
intermediate dose level below the MAD may be introduced and assessed for DLTs. Dose 
escalation will continue until the RP2D is reached or may be stopped at any dose level based on 
emerging safety and PK/PDy data, subject to agreement between the In vestigators and Sponsor. 
A RP2D will be defined as the dose with DLTs observed in <⅓ of at least 6 patients and desired 
PK and as determined by [CONTACT_1034], in agreement with the Investigators. A 
patient will be considered non -evaluable  if, for any reason other than safety, the patient is unable 
to complete the DLT observation period, or if the PK assessments were insufficient to define the 
PK profile. Patients in Part 1a considered non -evaluable may be replaced after consultation 
betwee n the Investigators and Sponsor.

[IP_ADDRESS].1. Assessment of Renal Impairment 
During the conduct of the expansion cohorts, a safety assessment will be performed in 6-12 
patients with moderate chronic kidney damage ( ie, creatinine clearance [CrCL] between 30 and 
50 mL /min). Patients meeting these criteria may be enrolled in any of the 4 expansion cohorts 
and will complete DLT observation for 42 days. If DLTs are observed in <⅓ of patients, then patients with CrCL ≥30 mL/min will be allowed throughout Part 2 of the stud y. 
3.1.4.  Part 2 – Dose Expansion Cohorts – TSR-033 + Dostarlimab (Q2W + Q6W) 
Part [ADDRESS_616409] ered on a Q2W schedule for TSR-033 and a 
Q6W schedule for dostarlimab. In Part 2B, TSR-033 and dostarlimab will be administered on Day 
3 of a dose cycle following chemotherapy and bevacizumab therapy on Day 1 of a dose cycle. 
The expansion cohorts will evaluate the preliminary activity of TSR-033 in combination with 
dostarlimab in anti- PD-1 naïve patients with a sp ecific tumor type as follows: 
• Cohort A – Third- and fourth-line MSS- CRC  
• Cohort B –Second -line MSS- CRC  
In each disease-specific expansion cohort, a Simon’s 2- stage de sign will be used to provide 
initial assessment of the clinical activity of the TSR-033 in combination with dostarlimab
50 (see 
Section  8.7).  
For Cohorts B1 and B2, if within 12 weeks of initiating study treatment, delayed irAEs 
consistent with DLT criteria occur in ≥⅓ of patients at a particular dose level, a lower dose level 
will be considered by [CONTACT_479869]: 
• Further refinement of RP2D and dose for expansion cohorts and/or 
• All patients on treatment if in the best interest of the patient

 The final data cut -off (DCO) date for the study will be defined by [CONTACT_479870] . The DCO date represents the end of data collection for th e study and 
the date on which the clinical study database will be closed to new d ata. 
Patients in Survival Follow -Up at the time of the DCO date will be considered to have completed 
the study . Patients still on treatment at the time of the DCO date may continue to receive study 
treatment for up to 2  years  unless specific withdrawal cri teria are met (see Section  3.3.2  and 
Section  4.3.1 ); patients may also choose to discontinue study treatment at any tim e. Note:  Study 
treatment must be discontinued before the TSR-[ADDRESS_616427] of care 
at a patient’s particular study site, and only SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation of study 
treatment, overdoses, and pregnancies will be reported directly to the Sponsor  via paper forms  
(see Section  6.1.12 ; refer to the Study Reference Manual  for further details  on reporting using 
paper forms ). Although the clinical study database will be closed at the time of the DCO date, 
the stu dy will remain open until all pa tients  discontinue study treatment and the end of study 
definition (noted above) is reached.

 • Withdrawal of consent from treatment, but agreement to participate in FUP visits 
(partial consent withdrawn).  
• Death.  
Patients who discontinue from study treatment will continue to receive FUP assessments (see 
Table  4, Table  5, Table  6, and Table  7) as part of the study unless they are discontinued from the 
study.  
4.3.2.  Discontinuation from the Study  
Patients may be discontinued from the study for any of the following reasons:  
• Withdrawal of consent by [CONTACT_102], who is at any time free to discontinue 
participation in the study, without prejudice to further treatment.  
• Loss to FUP.  
• Death.  
• Sponsor decision to terminate study.  
If a patient is thought to be lost to FUP, discontinues study treatment, or discontinues the study, 
attempts should be made to contact [CONTACT_73551]. For 
patients who are thought to be lost to FUP, at least [ADDRESS_616452] 
patient(s) that become non -evaluable for safety or if there is insufficient PK data during Part 1a, 
Part 1b, and Part 1c.  
For Cohorts B1 and B2, if a patient discontinues study treatment prior to the first assessment of 
disease (either scheduled radiological assessment at 6- or 9-weeks  post treatment initiation or 
clinically indicated disease assessment prior to 6 or 9 weeks) , the patient may be replaced after 
consultation between the Investigators and Sponsor, unless the patient discontinued study 
treatment due to clear clinical progression without radiographic evidence of progression. In these 
patients, obtaining a subsequen t confirmatory radiographic image is necessary if feasible ( eg, 
patient’s condition allows for imaging).  
4.4. Patient Identification and Randomization  
4.4.1.  Patient Identification  
All patients who enter screening (defined as the point at which the patient signs the I CF) will 
receive a unique patient identification number. This number will be used to identify the patient 
throughout the study and must be used on all study documentation related to that patient. A 
patient will be considered enrolled when the patient has c onsented, been screened, and all 
eligibility criteria have been confirmed by [CONTACT_737]. The patient identification number 
must remain constant throughout the entire study .

Part 2A : Following completion of t he TSR -033 infusion, dostarlimab  (1000 mg) will be 
administered via a 30 -minute IV infusion ( -5 minute and +15 minute) with a post -infusion 
observation period of 2 hours for Dose 1, Day 1. TSR -033 will be given on a Q2W schedule and 
dostarlimab  on a Q6W sc hedule. If emerging safety and/or PK data indicate that exploration of a 
lower TSR -033 dose is warranted, an additional cohort may be opened.  
Part 2  Cohort B1: Initially, a 6 -patient run -in with mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab regimen will 
be tested for safety, with the potential to add 6 additional patients, for a total of 12 patients. The 
DLT observation period will be from Dose 1, Day 1, through Dose 3, Day 3, prior to the start of 
infusion. Following the DLT observation period, if ≥2 DLTs are observed, a dose  level reduction 
of TSR -033 to 240 mg can be considered (dose level -1). This dose level would then enroll 6 
patients. Alternatively, if <[ADDRESS_616459] preliminary efficacy

Part 2, Cohort B2: Initially, a 6 -patient run -in with FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab regimen will be 
tested for safety, with the potential to add 6 additional patients, for a total of 12 patients. The 
DLT observ ation period will be from Dose 1, Day 1, through Dose 3, Day 3, prior to the start of 
infusion. Following the DLT observation period, if ≥2 DLTs are observed, a dose level reduction 
of TSR -033 to 240 mg can be considered (dose level -1). This dose level wo uld then enroll 6 
patients. Alternatively, if <[ADDRESS_616460] 6 patients, such that an additional 
6 to 18 may be enrolled . The total for Part 2B as a whole remains at 24.  
Please refer to the Pharmacy M anual for details on the preparation and administration of the 
infusion solutions for TSR -033 and dostarlimab . 
The bevacizumab and the chemotherapy regimens will be administered following TSR -033 and

[ADDRESS_616463]-Treatment Vital Signs Monitoring and Safety Observation  
For all patients in Part 1, vital signs ( ie, resting blood pressure [BP], pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and 
temperature) will be monitored around the administration of the first and second doses of TSR -
033. These measurements should be collected prior to TSR -033 administration, 15 minutes after 
the start of the TSR -033 infusion (±5 mins), at the end of the TSR -033 infusion (±5 mins), 
60 minutes (±15 minutes) after the end of the TSR -033 infu sion, and 150 minutes (±15  minutes) 
after the end of the TSR -[ADDRESS_616464] -TSR-033 or 
-TSR-033/dostarlimab  administration, for Dose [ADDRESS_616465]-treatment administration for Dose 1; should no 
IRs occur, observation can be reduced to 1 hour for Dose 2, then to 30 minutes for all doses 
thereafter. Note that the observation period for patients receiving combination therapy (Part 1c 
and 2) will beg in once the dostarlimab  administration is completed. Also note that for patients in 
Part 2B, observation will be on Day 3 of the dose cycle when TSR -033/dostarlimab  are 
administered post -Day 1/2 treatment with SOC chemotherapy and bevacizumab . 
5.2.2.  Dose of TSR -033 
[IP_ADDRESS].  TSR -033 Dose (Part 1a and Part 1b) – Q2W Schedule  
Part 1a (dose escalation) will initially evaluate 3 ascending dose levels of TSR -033, 20 mg, 
80 mg, and 240 mg, administered via IV infusion. A 3  + 3 design will be used for the initial dose 
escalation (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  for details on dose escalation rules). Subsequent dose escalations 
will enroll 6 -12 patients at each dose level. Further dose e scalation may be considered in 
additional cohort(s) to 720 mg or an intermediate dose following agreement between the 
Investigators and Sponsor.  
Once the DLT observation period for the 20 mg dose level in Part 1a is complete, a cohort of up 
to 6 patients a t a dose of 20 mg will be enrolled in Part 1b. Additional cohorts may be enrolled in 
Part 1b at 80 or 240 mg, or both, or an alternative dose level, such as 720 mg, to better 
understand the PK/PDy of TSR -033. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  TSR -033 in Combination with Dostarlimab  (Part 1c) – Q3W Schedule  
The starting dose of TSR -[ADDRESS_616466] dose at which <⅓ of at least 6 patients experienced DLTs globally with 
single agent TSR -033. A lower dose cohort (6 -12 patients) may be evaluated if emerging data 
indicate that further dose exploration is warranted. In Part 1c TSR -[ADDRESS_616467], follow ed by [CONTACT_91051] . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  TSR -033 in Combination with Dostarlimab  (Part 2)  
Part 2 of the study will further explore the safety and clinical activity of TSR -033 in combination 
with dostarlimab . In Part 2B, the TSR -033 + dostarlimab  combination will be administered  with

 bevacizumab and chemotherapy (Cohort B1: mFOLFOX or Cohort B2: FOLFIRI). In Part 2, the 
following 2 disease specific cohorts will be enrolled (all patients PD -1 naïve):  
• Cohort A: Third - or fourth -line CRC  
• Cohort B: Second -line CRC  
Dosing in Part 2 wi ll be initiated using the RP2D established for TSR -033 in Part 1c of the study. 
Based on the analysis of TSR -033 exposure, receptor occupancy data, and PK/PD y modeling 
from Part 1, 720 mg Q2W is predicted to result in drug exposure sufficient to maintain a dequate 
target engagement over the dosing interval in the majority of patients. The selection of the RP2D 
and schedule may subsequently be revised based on clinical and PK/PDy data initially obtained 
in Part 2.  
TSR-[ADDRESS_616468] results and assessments are reviewed by [CONTACT_479871].  
5.3. Dose Modification  
5.3.1.  Dose Modification General Rules  
• Intra -patient dose escalation to a TSR -033 dose that has been prev iously shown to be safe 
may be permitted following agreement between the Investigator and Sponsor.  
• Study treatment dosing delays are permitted in the case of medical/surgical events or 
logistical reasons not related to study therapy ( eg, surgery, unrelated  medical events, 
patient vacation, and/or holidays). Patients should be placed back on study therapy within 
28 days of the scheduled TSR -033 infusion. If a delay is >28 days, the patient should be 
placed back on study therapy only after discussion with the  Sponsor. Reasons for 
treatment delays of >3 days should be documented in the eCRF.  
• TSR-[ADDRESS_616469]  be withheld for drug -related Grade 3 toxicities but may 
be resumed upon recovery to Grade ≤1 (see Table  2 for certain exceptions) ; TSR -033 and 
dostarlimab will be permanently discontinued for any drug -related Grade  4 event. TSR -
033 should be discontinued for some Grade  3 immunologic -mediated AEs as described in 
Table  2. 
• Specific AEs typi[INVESTIGATOR_422806] -PD-1 antibodies will be managed according to 
the rules summarized below in Section  5.3.2 . 
• In Part 2B, dose modification for bevacizumab, mFOLFOX6 (Cohort B1), or FOLFIRI 
(Cohort B2) should follow the product label.  If, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689] , a 
patient may benefit from discontinuation of certain but not all ele ments of a regimen, for 
example, discontinue oxaliplatin but remain on the remainder of mFOLFOX6 plus 
bevacizumab and the immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] , this will be allowed only after discussion with 
the Medical Monitor.  
5.3.2.  Dose Modification for Specific Immune -Related Adverse Events  
• Any grade hypophysitis or hypothyroidism should be managed by [CONTACT_479872]. In case of new onset type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM)/Grade 3

be resumed in appropriately managed clinically and metabolically stable patients. 
Please refer to Table  3 for details on the management of TSR -033 dose delays and 
discontinuation for specific events.  
• For TSR -033, dose reductions to a lower dose level (no reduction below 20 mg) may 
be permitted following consultation with the Sponsor based on emerging data . 
• All treatment delays (including any missed d oses) and discontinuations, and the 
reason for delays or discontinuation of TSR -033 and/or dostarlimab , should be 
recorded in the eCRF.

[ADDRESS_616478] ad here to the contraception requirement (described above) for the duration of 
the study and through [ADDRESS_616479] study treatment. If there is any question that a 
patient will not reliably comply with the requirements for contraception that patient  should not 
be entered into the study.  
5.6.4.  Rescue Mediations and Supportive Care Guidelines  
Patients should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_479874], but not limited to, the items outlined below. P rophylactic cytokines ( eg, 
G-CSF) should be administered according to current American Society of Clinical Oncology 
guidelines.51 
Note : It may be necessary to perform additional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or 
skin photography as part of evaluation of an event.  
The following text details specific treatment guidance by [CONTACT_119558]:  
• Pneumonitis:  
− Treat with systemic corticosteroids, oral for Grade 2 ( eg, 0.5 to 1 mg/kg per day 
of prednisone or equivalent) and IV for Grade 3 -4 (eg, 1 to 2 mg/kg per day of 
prednisone or equivalent) . 
− Administer additional anti -inflammatory measures, as needed.  
− Taper corticosteroids when symptoms improve to Grade ≤1 over ≥4 weeks . 
− If Grade 2 and no improvement or worsening over 2 weeks, treat as Grade 3 -4. 
− Consider prophylactic antibiotics for opportun istic infections in the case of 
prolonged steroid administration.  
• Diarrhea/Colitis:  
− Monitor carefully for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such as diarrhea, 
abdominal pain, and blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and of bowel 
perforation (s uch as peritoneal signs and ileus) . 
− All patients who experience diarrhea/colitis should be advised to drink liberal 
quantities of clear fluids. If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and 
electrolytes should be substituted via IV infusion . 
− For Grade 2 diarrhea/colitis that persists >3 days, administer oral corticosteroids 
(eg, 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg per day of prednisone or equivalent). If symptoms persist or 
worsen with steroids, treat as Grade 3 -4. 
− For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea/colitis that persists >3 days, treat with IV steroids ( eg, 1 
to 2 mg/kg per day of prednisone or equivalent) followed by [CONTACT_5019] -dose oral 
steroids . 
− Taper corticosteroids when symptoms improve to Grade ≤1 over ≥4 weeks.

 • T1DM or Grade ≥3 Hyperglycemia:  
− For type I diabetes mellitus and for Grade 3 -4 hyperglycemia associated with 
metabolic acidosis or ketonuria, insulin replacement therapy is required.  
• Hypophysitis:  
− Treat with systemic corticosteroids, oral for Grade 2 ( eg, 0.5 to 1 mg/kg per day 
of prednisone or equivalent) and IV fo r Grade 3 -4 (eg, 1 to 2 mg/kg per day of 
prednisone or equivalent) . 
− Taper corticosteroids when symptoms improve to Grade ≤1 over ≥4 weeks . 
− Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is 
tapered.  
• Hyperthyroidism or Hypothyroidism : 
− Thyroid disorders have been reported with PD -1 inhibitors occurring at any time 
during treatment. Monitor patients for changes in thyroid function (at the start of 
treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical 
evaluation) a nd for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders.  
− Grade 2 Hyperthyroidism events:  
− Consider nonselective beta -blockers ( eg, propranolol) as initial therapy.  
− Grade 3 -4 Hyperthyroidism  
− Treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroids followed by [CONTACT_79918] ( eg, 0.5 to 1 mg/kg per day of prednisone or equivalent). Taper 
corticosteroids when symptoms improve to Grade ≤1 over ≥4 weeks. 
Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is 
tapered . 
− Grade 2 -4 Hypothyroidism  
− Thyroid hormone replacement therapy, with levothyroxine or liothyronine, is 
indicated per SOC.  
• Hepatitis:  
− Treat with systemic corticosteroids, oral for Grade 2 (initial dose of 1  to 2 mg/kg 
per day of prednisone or equivalent) and IV for Grade 3 -4 (1 to 2 mg/kg per day 
of prednisone or equivalent)  
− Taper corticosteroids when symptoms improve to Grade ≤1 over ≥4 weeks.  
• Severe Exfoliative Dermatologic Events:  
− Suspected: Treat with high potency topi[INVESTIGATOR_479842]. Treat with 
oral prednisone or e quivalent at an initial dose of 0.5 to 1  mg/kg/day and taper 
steroid when dermatitis is controlled. Ensure adequate evaluation (eg, urgent 
dermatology consultation) to confirm etiology and/or exclude other causes.

72 
 − Confirmed: Administer 1 to 2  mg/kg/day IV methylprednisolone or equivalent 
and taper steroid when dermatitis is controlled.  
• Renal Failure or Nephritis:  
− Treat with systemic corticosteroids, oral for Grade 2 (initial dose of 
0.5 to 1 mg/kg per day of prednisone or equivalent) and IV for Grade 3 -4 
(1 to 2 mg/kg per day of prednisone or equivalent).  
− Taper corticosteroids when symptoms improve to Grade ≤1 over ≥4 weeks . 
• Adrenal Insufficiency:  
− Start treatment with corticosteroids before other hormone replacement therapy to 
avoid adrenal crisis (hydrocort isone slowly titrating doses down according to 
symptoms or prednisone and fludrocortisone titrating up or down based on blood 
pressure, other symptoms, and laboratory results); patients with severe symptoms 
may require additional fluids (eg, saline >2  L). 
− Monitor for cortisol level (AM), comprehensive metabolic panel (Na, K, CO 2, 
glucose), and renin.  
− Ensure adequate evaluation (eg, endocrine consultation).  
• Myocarditis:  
− Administer high -dose corticosteroids (1 g/day of IV methylprednisolone) for 3 to 
5 days, followed by [CONTACT_86615] 4 to 6  weeks based on 
improvement in cardiac function and biomarkers.  
− If no improvement in 24  hours, consider adding other potent immunosuppressive 
agents.  
− Ensure adequate evaluation (eg, urgent cardiology consultatio n) to confirm 
etiology and/or exclude other causes.  
• Severe Neurologic al Events (Myasthenic Syndrome/Myasthenia Gravis, 
Guillain -Barré Syndrome, Immune -Related Encephalitis, Transverse Myelitis)  
− Consider high dose corticosteroids and other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_479843]. 
− It is highly recommended that Investigators discuss any AEs with the Sponsor 
before using infliximab.  
− Ensure adequate evaluation (eg, neurology consultation).  
− Consider MRI of brain and/or spi[INVESTIGATOR_479844].  
− Consider inpatient management as clinically indicated.  
• Uveitis:  
− Urgent ophthalmology consultation . 
− Administer treatment with ophthalmic and systemic 
prednisone/methylprednisone .

 • Management of Infusion -related Reactions : An infusion -related reaction is defined 
as an AE to the infusion of TSR -033 or dostarlimab  that occurs during the infusion or 
within 2 hours of completion of the infusion. Signs and symptoms usually develop 
during or shortly after drug infusion and gener ally resolve completely. Table  3 shows 
treatment guidelines for patients who experience an infusion -related reaction 
associated with administration of T SR-033 or dostarlimab .

may be restarted at 50% of the 
original infusion rate ( eg, from 100 
mL/h to 50  mL/h). Otherwise, 
dosing will be held until symptoms 
resolve, and the patient should be 
premedicated for the next scheduled 
dose.  
The end of infusion PK sample 
should always be drawn at the end of 
the last study medication infusion, 
regardless if the infusion is slowed 
or temporarily stopped due to an

For patients who continue to receive study treatment after the DCO date of the final analys is (see 
Section  3.3.3 ), dispensing of study treatment after the clinical study database has closed may be 
done with a manual resupply option (refer to the Study Reference Manual). Drug accountability 
data will also  be collected at the site.  Note:  There will be no further access to TSR-033 study

[ADDRESS_616480] of the study include  DLTs, SAEs, 
treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs), irAEs, clinical laboratory assessments (hematology, 
chemistry, thyroid function , and urinalysis ), vital signs, ECGs, physical examination, ECOG PS, 
and use of concomitant medications.  
6.1.1.  Definitions  
Adverse event: An AE is any untoward medical occurrence that occurs in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, and which does not necessarily 
have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unf avorable 
and unintended sign (including clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not 
considered related to the product.  
AEs may include the onset of new illness and the exacerbation of pre -existing medical 
conditions. An AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including 
baseline or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered.  
A TEAE  will be define d as any new AE that begins, or any pre -existing condition that worsens in 
severity, after at least 1 dose of study treatment has been administered.  
Serious adverse event: An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death.  
• Is life -threatening.  
− Note : This means that the patient is at immediate risk of death at the time of the 
event; it does not mean that the event hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe.  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
− Any AE that prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_73524].  
− Exception: Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ( eg, for observation, protocol compliance, 
elective procedures, or social reasons) will not be considered an SAE; h owever, 
the reason for the planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_119515].  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
• Is an important medical event(s).  
− An important medical event m ay not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_119516]. Examples of such events are intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home for al lergic bronchospasm, blood

213349  (4040 -01-001, CITRINO)  
Amd  05 (Version  6.0) 
76 
 dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction  (S[LOCATION_003]R) : A S[LOCATION_003]R is serious adverse 
reaction of which the nature and severity is not consistent with the information about the study 
drug set out in the IB Reference Safety Information section.  
6.1.2.  Assessment of Adverse Events  
Each AE will be assessed by [CONTACT_479875].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Intensity  
Investigators should assess the severity of AEs according to CTCAE. In general, CTCAE v5.0 
severity grades are:  
• Grade 1:  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms, clinical or diagnostic observations 
only, intervention not indicated.  
• Grade 2:  Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL). (Instrumental ADL 
refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, 
managing money, et c.) 
• Grade 3:  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111], disabling, limiting 
self-care ADL. (Self -care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, 
using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden.)  
• Grade 4:  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
• Grade 5:  Death related to AE.  
A distinction should be made between serious  and severe  AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity 
where as seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_119559]  6.1.1 . For example, a mild degree 
of gastrointestinal bleeding requiring an overnight hospi[INVESTIGATOR_119517]. Similarly, an AE that is severe in intensity is 
not necessarily an SAE. For example, alopecia may be assessed as severe in intensity but may 
not be considered a n SAE.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Causality  
The Investigator will assess the causality/relationship between the study drug and the AE. One of 
the following categories should be selected based on medical judgment, considering the 
definitions and all contributing factors:  
• Related : A c linical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurs in a plausible 
time relationship to treatment administration, and which concurrent disease or other 
drugs or chemicals cannot explain. The response to withdrawal of the treatment 
should be clinic ally plausible.  
TMF -14403236  CONFIDENTIAL  
213349  (4040 -01-001, CITRINO)  
Amd  05 (Version  6.0) 
77 
 • Possibly related : A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a 
reasonable time sequence to administration of the treatment, unlikely to be attributed 
to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals.  
• Unlikely related : A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a 
temporal relationship to treatment administration that makes a causal relationship 
improbable, or in which other drugs, chemicals, or underlying disease provide likely 
explanations.  
• Unrelated : A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with little or no 
temporal relationship with treatment administration. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_119518] ( eg, concomitant disease, environmental factors, or other drugs or 
chemicals).  
6.1.3.  Collecti ng and Recording Adverse Events  
All AEs, regardless of the source of identification ( eg, physical examination, laboratory 
assessment, ECG, or reported by [CONTACT_4676]), must be documented in the eCRF.  
All AEs and SAEs will be collected and recorded in the eCRF for each patient from the day of 
signed informed consent until [ADDRESS_616481] (see Table  4, Table  5, Table  6, and Table  7 for schedules of 
events). If an Investigator becomes aware of an SAE after the [ADDRESS_616482], the 
Investigator should report the SAE to the Sponsor according to timelines for reporting SAEs 
described in Section  6.1.5 . All AEs and SAEs experienced by a patient during the study period, 
irrespective of the suspected causality, will be monitored until: the AE or SAE has resolved or 
stabilized, any abnormal laboratory values have returned to baselin e or normal levels, there is a 
satisfactory explanation for the changes observed, the patient is lost to FUP or withdraws 
consent, or the patient has died.  
AEs may be volunteered spontaneously by [CONTACT_4694], or discovered by [CONTACT_14543], nonleading question such as: “How have you 
been feeling since you were last asked?” The Investigator will document the nature of the AE, 
date of onset of the AE (and time, if known), date of outcome of the AE (an d time, if known), 
severity of the AE, assessment of the seriousness of the AE, and assessment of the causal 
relationship of the AE to study drug and/or study procedure.  
Each AE should be recorded in the source document and in the eCRF using the patient’s own 
words (verbatim) unless, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], the AEs constitute components of a 
recognized condition, disease, or syndrome. In the latter case, the condition, disease, or 
syndrome should be named rather than each individual symptom.  
Concomitant illnesses that existed before entry into the study will not be considered an AE 
unless the illness worsens during the treatment period. Pre -existing conditions will be recorded in 
the eCRF (in the medical history section or appropriate page) as we ll as on the SAE Report Form 
(medical history section).

Amd  05 (Version  6.0) 
78 
 6.1.4.  Reporting Disease Progression  
The event of PD is an efficacy criterion and is therefore not considered an AE per se. Disease 
progression should be reported within the eCRF. If AEs/SAEs occur in relati on to disease 
progression that are not consistent with the nature and natural progression of the patient’s 
disease, these AEs/SAEs must be reported per AE/SAE reporting requirements described in 
Section  6.1.2  and Section  6.1.5 . Death due to PD that is consistent with the nature and natural 
progr ession of the patient’s disease is not reported as AE/SAE.  
6.1.5.  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
The Investigator must report all SAEs within [ADDRESS_616483] be completed on each form: FUP number, site number, patient/subject number, protocol 
number, and the SAE term(s) and date of awareness. Only the a ppropriate field(s) on the SAE 
Report Form where the Investigator received additional or updated information should be 
completed. Previously provided information does not have to be entered on the FUP SAE Report 
Form.  
Initial and FUP SAE reports and any ad ditional supporting documentation ( eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_73529], 
consultant reports, death certificates, or autopsy reports) included with the SAE report should be 
sent to the Sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of the Investigator/site awareness or receipt. If 
supporting documentation is provided, the Investigator should highlight all relevant and pertinent 
information. Also, any additional SAE documentation must be a clear photocopy with the 
patient’s personal identifiers removed. The Investigator must sign and  date all SAE forms.  
The minimum information required for an initial SAE report is:  
• Identification of person sending the report ( ie, name [CONTACT_95903])  
• Patient identification (screening number, initials [if permitted by [CONTACT_479876]], NOT patient name)  
• Protocol number  
• Description of SAE  
• Causality assessment  
In case the Investigator has no ability to either fax or email an SAE ( eg, due to technical issues), 
pharmacovigilance can be contact[CONTACT_3012]. If an SAE is reported vi a phone and during usual 
business hours, the Sponsor pharmacovigilance (or designee) will capture the information on a 
telephone contact [CONTACT_119561]. Outside usual business hours, the message will be 
recorded and the required FUP actions initiat ed during the next business day. Once technical 
issues are resolved, the Investigator should fax or email the completed SAE form to the Sponsor 
(or designee).

 After receipt of the initial report, the Sponsor (or designee) will review the information and, i f 
necessary, contact [CONTACT_14546].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Submission and Distribution of Serious Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction 
Reports  
All SAEs that are unexpected and considered by [CONTACT_479877]  (related or possibly related) with the use of the investigational study drug(s) are 
subject to expedited safety reporting to health regulatory agencies . Per regulatory requirements, 
if an SAE is assessed by [CONTACT_479878] a S[LOCATION_003]R it will be submitted to the Re gulatory 
Authorities. In addition to this, a copy of the report ( Council for International Organizations of 
Medical Sciences [ CIOMS ] or MedWatch 3500A) will be distributed to the Investigators/site. A 
copy of the report will be submitted to the respective Institutional Review Board (IRB) or 
Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) and Investigators as per local regulation.  
Disease progression or AEs related to the underlying disease, as defined in the study 
protocol, unless resulting in death, should be considere d as expected and are excluded from 
the regulatory requirements for expedited reporting . 
TESARO has delegated the reporting of some of the S[LOCATION_003]Rs reporting duties to a third party. 
Information about the third parties responsible for S[LOCATION_003]R reporting to Heal th Authorities, 
Investigators, IRBs, and IECs is listed in the application documentation submitted to regulatory 
authorities.  
6.1.6.  Pregnancy  
Pregnancies occurring in patients enrolled in this study must be reported and followed to 
outcome. If a patient inadvert ently becomes pregnant while on study treatment, the patient will 
immediately be removed from the study. Any pregnancies that occur within [ADDRESS_616484] interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. Elective abortions without 
complications should not be considered AEs unless they were therapeutic abortions. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_479848] a healthy newborn should not be considered an SAE. 
Pregnancy is not considered an SAE unless there is an associated serious outcome. Spontaneous 
abortions should always be reported as SAEs.  
Any SAE that occurs during pregnancy mus t be recorded on the SAE Report Form ( eg, maternal 
serious complications, therapeutic abortion, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth, neonatal death, 
congenital anomaly, or birth defect) and reported within [ADDRESS_616485] it to 
the Sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of knowledge of the pregnancy. If there is an 
associated serious outcome, then both the Initial Pregnancy Noti fication report form and SAE 
report form should be completed.  
The Investigator should FUP with the patient until delivery or termination of pregnancy, even if 
the patient was withdrawn from the study or if the study has finished. At that time, the Pregnanc y

80 
 Outcome report form should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor within 24 hours after 
the Investigator becomes aware of the pregnancy outcome.  
In the event the pregnancy outcome occurs following the end of the study and database lock, the 
Investigat or will report the pregnancy outcome to the Sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours after 
the outcome of the pregnancy is known to the Investigator in accordance with the procedure for 
reporting SAEs (see Section  6.1.5 ). 
6.1.7.  Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
The following laboratory variables will be determined in accordance with the schedule of events 
(see Table  4, Table  5, Table  6, and Table  7). These tests will be performed by [CONTACT_479879].

 − Total protein  
− Albumin  − Lactate dehydrogenase  
− Lipase  
• Urinalysis:  
− Specific gravity  
− Leukocyte esterase  
− Nitrite  
− Blood  
− Bilirubin  
− Protein  − Glucose  
− Ketones  
− Urobilinogen  
− Microscopy (if clinically 
indicated)  
• Thyroid panel ( ie, TSH, T3 or FT3, and FT4 [or T4 if FT4 is not available], or 
equivalent tests, where applicable)  
• Serum or urine pregnancy  testing (women of childbearing potential [WOCBP] only)  
• Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV 
RNA) testing (screening only if clinically indicated eg, patients with history of IV 
drug use)  
Any laboratory values ass essed as clinically significant should be recorded as an AE. If SAE 
criteria are met, the event should be recorded and reported according to the SAE reporting 
process (see Section  6.1.5 ). 
6.1.8.  Physical Examination and Vital Signs  
Complete physical examinations, including height (screening only), weight, and vital signs (BP, 
pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and temperature) will be performed in accordance with the s chedule of 
events (see Table  4, Table  5, Table  6, and Table  7). 
Any physical examination or vital signs assessed as clinically significant should be recorded as 
an AE or SAE. If any seriousness criteria are met, the event should be recorded and reported 
according to the SAE repor ting process (see Section  6.1.5 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Symptom -Directed Physical Examination  
Symptom -directed physical exams will be performed throughout the study as cli nically indicated.  
6.1.9.  Electrocardiogram  
A standard 12 -lead ECG will be performed in accordance with the schedule of events (see 
Table  4, Table  5, Table  6, and Table  7). Any ECG result assessed as clinically significant should 
be recorded as an AE or SAE. If any seriousne ss criteria are met, the event should be recorded 
and reported according to the SAE reporting process (see Section  6.1.5 ).

 6.1.10.  Eastern Cooperative Oncol ogy Group Performance Status  
PS will be assessed using the ECOG scale (see Appendix  3) in accordance with the schedule of 
events (see Table  4, Table  5, Table  6, and Table  7). The same observer should assess PS each 
time.  
6.1.11.  Addition al Safety Assessments  
All patients will undergo ECGs in accordance with the schedule of events (see Table  4, Table  5, 
Table  6, and Table  7). ECGs should be performed prior to any blood draws. Patients will be 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_479849] a semi -recumbent position (about 30 degrees of elevation) and rested for 
approximately 2 minutes before ECGs are recorded.  
Any ECG findings assessed as clinically significant should be recorded as an AE. If any 
seriousness criteria are met, the even t should be recorded and reported according to the SAE 
reporting process (see Section  6.1.5). 
6.1.12.  Collection of Safety Information After Final Analysis  
For patients who continue to receive study treatment after the DCO date of the final analysis (see 
Section  3.3.3 ), the Sponsor will continue to collect  safety information including SAEs, AEs 
leading to discontinuation of study treatment, overdoses, and pregnancies; these events will be 
reported directly to the Sponsor via paper forms (refer to the Study Reference Manual). The 
events will be reported per defined time frames as follows:  
• SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment, and overdoses will be 
reported during the treatment period and for up to [ADDRESS_616486].  
• Pregnancies will be reported during the treatment period and for up to [ADDRESS_616487] dose.  
Reporting of these events (SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment, overdoses, 
and pregnancies) will continue to be in accordance wit h the protocol. Additionally, any SAE that 
is ongoing at the time of the DCO date of the final analys is must be followed -up to resolution, 
unless the event is considered by [CONTACT_479880] -up. The Sp onsor retains the right to request additional information for any patient with 
ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the time of the DCO date of the final analys is, if judged necessary.  
6.2. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics

clinical practice. Assessments wil l revert to the standard of care at a patient’s particular study site 
and only SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment, overdoses, and pregnancies 
will be reported directly to the Sponsor via paper forms (see  Section  6.1.12 ; refer to the Study 
Reference Manual for further details on reporting using paper forms ). 
7.1.1.  Use of Standard of Care Assessments for Screening  
In some cases, clinical assessments performed prior to obtaining informed consent may be used 
to qualify the patient for the study, providing these assessments are performed within [ADDRESS_616497] dose of study treatment (within 28 days for radiolog ic assessments). These 
include radiological examinations, ECGs, physical examinations, vital signs, hematology, 
chemistry, coagulation studies, or urinalysis, which may be considered as part of normal SOC. In 
these cases, repeat assessments may not be nece ssary prior to enrollment unless individual 
parameters require further study or confirmation and are clinically appropriate.

response may be performed at the earliest [ADDRESS_616529] indication of response, but no later than 35 days, whicheve r is clinically indicated. The 
subsequent scan after the confirmatory scan should be obtained per the original schedule. Clini cally stable patients should not be discontinued until progression is

 Demographics, baseline characteristics, and medical history information wi ll be summarized by 
[CONTACT_479881] 1a, 1b, and 1c and by [CONTACT_479882] 2, for the Safety Population 
using descriptive statistics. No formal statistical comparisons among cohorts will be performed.  
Demographic, baseline characteristics, a nd medical history data for each patient will be provided 
in data listings.  
8.2. Safety Analyses  
The following key safety parameters will be evaluated by [CONTACT_15994], by [CONTACT_479883], and 
overall, unless noted otherwise:  
• DLTs (DLT -Evaluable Population) during the DLT -observation period in Part 1a, 
Part 1c, and Part 2B.  
• Incidence of TEAEs during the DLT -observation period ( ie, the first [ADDRESS_616545] 42 days of treatment for Part 1c) compared to 
subsequent days with subsequent  doses.  
• Incidence of TEAEs, irAEs, and SAEs occurring while patients are on treatment or up 
to [ADDRESS_616546].  
• Clinical laboratory assessments (CBC wit h 5-part differential, chemistry, and thyroid 
panel), CTCAE graded laboratory toxicities, ECOG PS, ECG parameters, and usage 
of concomitant medications.  
All AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) coding 
system and  displayed in tables and data listings using system organ class and preferred term. 
Analyses of AEs will be performed for those events that are considered treatment -emergent, 
where treatment -emergent is defined per protocol as any AE with onset after the f irst 
administration of study drug, throughout the treatment period, until 90  days after cessation of 
study treatment (or until the start of alternat ive anti -cancer therapy, whichever occurs earlier), or 
any event that was present at baseline but worsened i n intensity or was subsequently considered 
drug-related by [CONTACT_119573]. DLTs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_479884] 1a, Part 1c, and Part 2B.  
The number and percentage of patients with any TEAE, with any TEAE assessed by [CONTACT_479885] (definite, probable, or possible relationship), and with any 
SAE will be summarized by [CONTACT_6654]. In these tabulations, each patient will 
contribute only once ( ie, the most related occurrence or th e most intense occurrence) to each of 
the incidence rates in the descriptive analysis, regardless of the number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. No formal 
hypothesis -testing analysis of AE incidence rates will be performed.  
The occurrence of and reasons for any requirement fo r dose interruption will be tabulated.  
All AEs occurring on -study will be listed in patient data listings. By -patient listings will also be 
provided for the following: patient deaths, SAEs, and AEs leading to withdrawal of study 
treatment.

 8.2.1.  Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant medications will be coded using the W HO Drug Dictionary (September 2016 or 
later version). A dictionary listing of all unique concomitant medications used in the study will 
be provided . 
8.3. Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
All patients who rece ive any amount of  TSR-033 and/or dostarlimab  and have ≥1  measurable 
drug concentration  will be included in PK analyses.  
Noncompartmental methods will be used to evaluate the PK characteristics of TSR -033 in 
Part 1a and Part  1b and TSR -033 and dostarlimab  in Part 1c and Part 2, as appropriate . PK 
parameters such as C max, time at maximum concentration (T max), AUC,  t½, volume of distribution 
at steady state (V ss), and clearance (CL) may be derived from serum concentrations using actual 
sampling times, as data permit. Concentration data may be included in a population PK analysis, 
the results of which will be reported separately.  
Concentration -time data and PK parameters will be listed and summarized descriptively by 
[CONTACT_9084], dose level, and dose number.  Summary statistics will include the mean, standard 
deviation, coefficient of variation, geometric mean, geometric mean coefficient of variation, 
median, minimum, and maximum.  
8.4. Antidrug Antibody Analysis  
The number and percent of patients who become positive for ADA s will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_765]/time and overall. Similar analysis may be conducted for neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) if 
deemed appropriate.  
8.5. Efficacy Analyses  
All efficacy endpoints will be summarized on the data from patients in Part  2 by [CONTACT_479886];  in addition, data may be pooled for patients in Part  1 and Part  2, by [CONTACT_44847]. The 
primary efficacy analysis is based on the Efficacy Population defined in Section  8.1. All analyses 
will include summary statistics, including number of patients (n) and percentage (%) for 
categorical variables and number of patients, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and 
maximum for continuous variables. Time -to-event analyses will be performed using Kaplan -
Meier (KM) methods.[ADDRESS_616547] v1.1, as assessed by [CONTACT_737]. Point estimates and 2 -sided 
95% CIs will be provided. The primary analysis of ORR will be performed for each expansion 
cohort and no multiplicity adjustment will be made since separate inferences will be drawn for 
each cohort.

 facilitate data capture during clinical trials. The system is fully compliant with Code of Federal 
Regulations 21  Part 11 . 
The Investigator will ensure the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data repor ted to 
the Sponsor. Data collection processes and procedures will be reviewed and validated to ensure 
completeness, accuracy, reliability, and consistency. A complete audit trail will be maintained of 
all data changes. The Investigator or designee will coo perate with the Sponsor’s representative(s) 
for the periodic review of study documents to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data 
capture system at each scheduled monitoring visit . 
Electronic consistency checks and manual review will be used to id entify any errors or 
inconsistencies in the data. This information will be provided to the respective study sites by 
[CONTACT_25317] . 
The Investigator or designee will prepare and maintain adequate and accurate study documents 
(medica l records, ECGs, AE and concomitant medication reporting, raw data collection forms, 
etc.) designed to record all observations and other pertinent data for each patient receiving study 
treatment . 
The Investigator will allow Sponsor representatives, contrac t designees, authorized regulatory 
authority inspectors, and the IRB to have direct access to all documents pertaining to the study.  
9.5. Archiving Study Documents  
Essential clinical documents will be maintained to demonstrate the validity of the study and the 
integrity of the data collected. Master files should be established at the beginning of the study, 
maintained for the duration of the study, and retained according to the appropriate regulations. 
Trial subject’s medical files should be retained for at leas t 5 years (recommended to be in their 
original format) and in accordance with the maximum period of time permitted by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_307], 
institution, or private practice.  If the Investigator becomes unable to respond for their essential 
documents ( eg, relocatio n, retirement), the Sponsor should be notified of this change and 
informed as to whom the responsibility has been transferred . 
9.6. Good Clinical Practice  
This study will be conducted in accordance with the Internationa l Council for Harmonisation of 
Technical R equirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use  (ICH) for GCP and the Declaration 
of Helsinki (Version 2008). The clinical study will also be carried out in accordance with 
national and local regulatory requirement(s) . 
9.7. Informed Consent  
Before each patient is  enrolled in the clinical study, written informed consent will be obtained 
from the patient according to the regulatory and legal requirements of the participating country. 
As part of this procedure, the Investigator must explain orally and in writing the nature, duration, 
and purpose of the study, and the action of the study treatment in such a manner that the patient 
is aware of the potential risks, inconveniences, or AEs that may occur. The patient should be 
informed that he/she is free to withdraw from the study at any time. The patient will receive all 
information that is required by [CONTACT_73560]. The Investigator or

 designee will provide the Sponsor with a copy of the IRB/IEC -approved ICF prior to the start of 
the study.  
The ICF must be signed and dated; [ADDRESS_616551] be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_119581]/IEC and signed by [CONTACT_479887], as well as those 
currently enrolled in the clinical study.  
9.8. Protocol Approval and Amendment  
Before the start of the s tudy, the study protocol and/or other relevant documents will be approved 
by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB/Competent Authorities, in accordance with local legal requirements. The 
Sponsor must ensure that all ethical and legal requirements have been met before the first pati ent 
is enrolled in the study.  
This protocol is to be followed exactly. To alter the protocol, amendments must be written, 
receive approval from the appropriate personnel, and receive IRB/IEC/Competent Authority 
approval prior to implementation (if appropri ate). In the U S, following approval, the protocol 
amendment(s) will be submitted to the Investigational New Drug Application under which the 
study is being conducted. Administrative changes (not affecting the patient benefit/risk ratio) 
may be made without  the need for a formal amendment. All amendments will be distributed to 
all protocol recipi[INVESTIGATOR_114963].  
9.9. Patient Confidentiality and Data Protection

 APPENDIX  1. RESPONSE EVALUATION CRITERIA IN SOLID 
TUMORS (RECIST), V1. 1 
Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm.  
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstra te an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm. ( Note : the appearance of 1 or more new lesions is also 
considered progression).  
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the  smallest sum diameters while on study.  
Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level. All lymph nodes must be nonpathological in size (<10 mm short axis).  
Note : If tumor markers are initially above the ULN, they must normalize for a patient to be 
considered in complete clinical response.  
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of 1 or more non -target lesion(s) or maintenance of tumor 
marker level, or both, above the normal limits . 
Progressive Disease (PD):  Appearance of [ADDRESS_616562] be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion 
increase.  
Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_12999], and the progression status should be 
confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_3433] e review panel (or the Investigator).  
Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until 
PD/recurrence (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started). The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of 
both measurement and confirmation criteria.

a See RECIST v1.1 publication for further details on what is evidence of a new lesion.  
b Only for nonrandomized trials with response as primary endpoint.53 
c In exceptional circumstances, unequ ivocal progression in non -target lesions may be accepted as disease PD. 
Note : Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective 
evidence of PD at that time should be reported as “symptomatic dete rioration.” Every effort should be made to 
document the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

Note : A “Non -CR/non -PD” is preferred over “stable disease” for non -target disease since SD is increasingly used as 
an endpoint for assessment of efficacy in some trials so to assign this category when no lesions can be measured is 
not advised.

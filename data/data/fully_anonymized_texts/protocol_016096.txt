2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
Uterine Carcinosarcoma (UCS) is a rare, aggressive malignancy accounting for 5% of uterine 
cancers. It is defined by [CONTACT_396512][INVESTIGATOR_018] (carcinomatous) and mesenchymal 
(sarcomatous) malignant cells [1]. Carcinosarcomas (C S) have been reported in a variety of organ 
sites including the ovary, fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916], peritoneum, prostate, and breast, with uterine origin being most common. The epi[INVESTIGATOR_396490] 8.0 (22- Apr-2021) 
8 
 frequently has high grade features (serous, clear cell, grade 3). Clinically, UCS tumors have a high 
incidence of extra -uterine spread at diagnosis and high rates  of recurrence manifesting as poor 
progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)[ 2]. 
Standard of care treatment for patients with UCS includes hysterectomy, bilateral s alpi[INVESTIGATOR_8936] -
oophorectomy, and lymph node dissection. Adjuvant chemotherapy has emerged as the most active treatment. The GOG conducted a series of drug development trials with the goal of defining active regimens. Ifosfamide, cisplatin, and paclitaxel were identified as the most active single agents. Combination regimens further improved response rates, with variable effect s on PFS and 
OS [3, 4].  A phase III trial comparing ifosfamide +/ - paclitaxel in patients with adv anced/recurrent  
UCS  demonstrated an improved response rate (RR) (45% vs 29%), median  PFS (5.8 vs 3.6 mo), 
and median  OS (13.5 vs 8.4 mo) with the combination regimen [ 4]. A subsequent phase II trial of 
paclitaxel and carboplatin reported a RR of 54% (13% complete response), median PFS of 7.6 months, and median OS of 14.7 months [ 5]. A subsequent  phase III trial comparing ifosfamide + 
paclitaxel to  carboplatin + paclitaxel is ongoing . In a parallel trial, stage I -IV patients with no 
residual disease were randomized to ifosfamide + cisplatin or whole abdominal radiation therapy  
[5]. The results demonstrated that a 22% reduction in the relative risk of  recurrence and a 29% 
reduction in the risk of  death with chemotherapy. In addition, the results of EORTC study [ZIP_CODE] 
(observa tion vs pelvic radiation for stages I -II UCS and leiomyosarcoma) demonstrated better 
local control without impact on survival  [6]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_396491], <30% of 
patients with optimally r esected, stage III -IV disease remain free of progression at 3 years  [5]. For 
patients with bulky advanced/recurrent disease, ~15% of patients remain free of  progression at 2 
years, and only 20% survive 2 years[ 7]. Improvement upon existing treatments is greatly needed.  
Historically, UCS was combined with other uterine sarcomas for treatment selection and clinical trial eligibility. There is increasing recognition th at UCS are not sarcomas, but an extreme 
manifestation of de -differentiated endometrial cancer (EC). Several hypotheses have been 
advanced to explain the hist iogenesis of UCS. One possible explanation for the phenotypi c 
changes is that it may represent a model of epi[INVESTIGATOR_018]- mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT is a 
process whereby [CONTACT_14198][INVESTIGATOR_396492] -cell contacts, have remodeled cytoskeletons, 
and acquire the ability to migrate  [8-10] . These changes are associated with the activation of a 
mesenchymal like gene expression profile. Mesenchymal cells are able to detach, penetrate the basement membrane, infiltrate, and metastasize. Primary tumor cells undergo EMT to acquire invasive/metastatic capacity. In addition, EMT induces cancer stem -like prope rties and confers 
drug resistance to tumor cells  [11, 12].  
A few studies have evaluated the role of EMT in uterine carcinosarcomas. Saegusa and colleagues compared 14 cases of UCS to 13 cases of endometrial cancers and demonstrated the complete shutdown of E -cadherin expression in the mesenchymal elements [13]. In addition pAkt and 
nuclear B -catenin levels were increased in mesenchymal cells. Romero -Perez and colleagues 
compared tumor DNA microarrays between 15 UCS and 23 EC samples and demonstrated changes in the expression of genes modulating EMT including the AT -hook 2 gene (embryonic nuclear 
factor that mediates EMT in some tumor models) and overexpression of HMGA2 gene (which favors EMT by [CONTACT_396513]- beta/Smad pathway)  [14].  
UCS represents an ideal model to study EMT. Morphologically, epi[INVESTIGATOR_396493]/mesenchymal populations of cells within UCS. The 
mesenchymal cells demonstrate many of the hallmarks (clinically and by [CONTACT_4658]) of EMT. Metastatic

 disease demonstrates epi[INVESTIGATOR_396494], perhaps suggesting the activation of mesenchymal to 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_018] (MET) transition. However, the mechanisms underlying this EMT transformation are currently unknown.  
Several candidates that may interrupt EMT and inhibit cancer stem -like cells ( CSC) have been 
identified  [10, 15, 16]. Among several growth factors that can act as inducers of EMT, 
transforming growth factor beta (TFG -β) has been shown to play an important role in cancer 
progression and metastasis  [15, 17-19 ]. TGFβ is a multifunctional cytokine that regulates EMT 
and suppresses growth and proliferation in epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663]. Aberrations in TGF -β signaling occur 
frequently during tumorige nesis allowing cancer cells to proliferate, invade, and metastasize 
beyond their tissue of origin. Active TGFβ binds to the TGFβ type II receptor subunit (TGFβR -
II), which then recruits and activates the type I receptor subunit (TGFβR -I). This active recep tor 
complex phosphorylates and activates the receptor -activated Smads which then form comple xes 
with Smad4, and translocates to the nucleus to modulate specific target gene expression[ 20].  Mani 
and colleagues were among the first to report a link between EMT and the acquisition of epi[INVESTIGATOR_396495]β treatment of breast cancer stem cells initiated EMT and concomitant acquisition of tumor initiating and self -renewal properties [21]. TGFβ has also been 
shown to modulate E -cadherin expression and induce reversible epi[INVESTIGATOR_396496] [ 22].  
Komiyama and colleagues have reported that expression of TGFß1 and its receptors is associated with biological features of ovarian cancer and cancer sensitivity to paclitaxel/carboplatin  [23]. 
Tissues of the primary tumor were collected  from 24 patients with ovarian cancer, primary 
peritoneal cancer, or fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_396497]/ carboplatin ; and the expression of TGFß1, TßRI, and TßRII mRNA was evaluated.  The 
authors found that a lo wer TGFß1 mRNA expression was associated  with high sensitivity to 
paclitaxel and carbop latin [23]. In consistent with this report , studies on mice model have shown 
that increased  TGF -β signaling could play an important role  for paclitaxel -resistance and breast 
cancer recurrence [ 24].   
To test the role of  TGFβ in UCS, researchers at the Un iversity of Oklahoma led by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. 
Bhattachraya  utilized patient tumor samples to demonstrate that the components of the TGFβ 
pathway are expressed and functional in UCS [25, 26]. mRNA levels of TGFβ -I, TGFβ -II, TGFβR -
I and TGFβR -II were shown to be higher in recurrent compared to the non -recurrent UCS patient 
samples.  
Additionally, TGFβ induced significant phosphorylation of i) Smad 2/3 and ii) c -Jun N -terminal 
kinase (JNK), iiii) nuclear localization of nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFAT1) and iv) cMyc transcription in UCS. While TGFβ induced proliferation through NFAT1/cMyc, regulation of migration/invasion and E MT are currently being explored. However the TGFβ receptor 1 
inhibitor (TGFβ R -1/ galunisertib .), efficiently blocks TGFβ induced proliferation, migration and 
EMT in UCS [15]
 . 
Galunisertib  is a small molecule selective inhibitor of the TGFβR -I kinase domain. It has been 
evaluated in phase I testing and 300 mg/day, 14 days on/14days off was the suggested as the phase II dose [ 27, 28]. A randomized phase II study comparing 160 mg vs 300 mg/day in hepatocellular 
carcinoma patients demonstrated manageable toxicity, evidence for biomarker response, and 
Pk/PD data supporting the 300 mg/day dosing in future studies  [29]. Furthermore, pre -clinic al 
studies in mice model showed that galunisertib could prevent drug  resistant to paclitaxel and 
Version 8.0 (22- Apr-2021) 
[ADDRESS_498744] cancer [24]. A phase Ib study 
with gemcitabine found no dose limiting toxicity, and the 300 mg/day dose was advanced into a 
phase II study in metastatic pancreatic cancer patients  [29]. A phase II study of galunisertib plus 
lomustine, galunisertib monotherapy, or placebo plus lomustine found that combination with 
lomustine did not change the PKs of galunisertib [ 30]. Furthermore, patients treated with 
galunisertib (150- mg, PO, twice a day) alone had less frequency  of drug-related grade 3/4 adverse 
events compared with lomustin e-treated patients (10% vs 26%); and galunisertib did not increase 
the frequency of lomustine related adverse events [ 30].  
To date , the safety and anti -cancer effect of Galunisertib  combined with paclitaxel/car boplatin 
regimen remains unclear. Based on the association of TGF β signaling with EMT in UCS, we 
propose a Phase IB feasibility trial with this novel TGF β inhibitor in combination with carboplatin/ 
paclitaxel (CT) in CS patients. In a phase II study evaluating CT in this population, 58% of patients were able to complete [ADDRESS_498745] therapy  [7].  We anticipate that given the excellent 
tolerability of galunisertib in previous studies, and in the potential for improved disease control 
with this agent that 60% or more of patients will receive [ADDRESS_498746] +/ - galunisertib .

5.2.[ADDRESS_498754] be diluted prior to infusion. Paclitaxel should be diluted in 0.9% Sodium Chloride 
for Injection, USP; 5% Dextrose Injection, USP; 5% Dextrose and 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP; or 5% Dextrose in Ringer’s Injection to a final concentration of 0.3 to 1.2mg/mL. The solutions are physically and chemically stable for up to 27 hours at ambient temperature (approximately 25°C / 77°F) and room lighting conditions. 
NOTE:  In order to minimize patient exposure to the plasticizer DEHP, which may be leached 
from PVC  infusion bags or sets, diluted paclitaxel solutions should be stored in bottles (glass, 
polypropylene) or plastic (polypropylene, polyolefin) bags and administered through polyethylene  
lined administration sets.  
Paclitaxel should be administered through a n inline filter with a microporous membrane not greater 
than 0.22 microns. Use of filter devices such as IVEX -2® or IVEX -HP®, which incorporate short 
inlet and outlet PVC -coated tubing, has not resulted in significant leaching of DEHP. 
All patients should be premedicated with corticosteroids, diphenhydramine, and H2 antagonists 
prior to paclitaxel administration in order to prevent severe hypersensitivity reactions. Patients who experience severe hypersensitivity reactions to paclitaxel should not be rechal lenged with the 
drug.

 6 TREATMENT PLAN  
An original, informed consent form, indicating prior approval by [CONTACT_8236]’s Human Rights 
or Clinical Trials Committee for participation in this study, must be forwarded to the SCC CTO 
Office.  
6.1 Treatment Plan  
6.1.1 Paclitaxel/Carboplatin  plus Galunisertib 
• Paclitaxel ** 175* mg/m2 over 3 hours, IV day 1 
• Carboplatin AUC 6* over 1 hour, IV day 1 (If no prior radiation therapy) 
• Galunisertib 150mg po BID day 4- 17 (see section 6.3) 
• Cycles are 28 days  
* Or, in patients with history of prior pelvic radiation, Paclitaxel  135mg/m2 over 3 hours, IV day 
1; Carboplatin AUC 5* over 1 hour, IV day 1 (if no prior radiation  therapy) ; Galunisertib 150mg 
po BID day 4-17 (see section 6.3). Cycles are 28 days.  
** Docetaxel st arting at 75  mg/m2 , IV day 1 may be substituted if a patient is intolerant or has an 
allergic reaction to paclitaxel .    
Patients will receive paclitaxel/carboplatin/galunisertib until unacceptable toxicity or progression.  
In the event of a complete clini cal response or partial response for which the treating physician 
believes cytotoxic chemotherapy  with paclitaxel/carboplatin  may be safety suspended, patients 
will continue galunisertib 150mg po BID as maintenance monotherapy until progression or 
toxicity . 
6.2 Method of Paclitaxel/Carboplatin Chemotherapy Administration 
6.2.1 Pre-medications for Paclitaxel  
Due to the risk of hypersensitivity reactions with paclitaxel, all patients should be pre -medicated 
with:  
AGENT  DOSE/ROUTE  DURATION  
Dexamethasone  [ADDRESS_498758]. Based on an updated 
ASCO antiemetic guidelines, a dult patients who are treated with carboplatin at AUC  ≥ [ADDRESS_498759]  (like fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053]) , a 5-HT3 
receptor antagonist, and dexamethasone [31]. Patients should receive fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_396500], granisetron, or dolasetron prior to chemotherapy plus dexamethasone (10- 20 mg  IV). 
Version 8.0 (22- Apr-2021) 
17 
 For some patients the addition of lorazepam (1- 2 mg IV 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy)  may 
also be appropriate.   
Note : Due to potential fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_396501][ 32], dose 
adjustment of dexamethasone should be considered.  
6.2.3 BSA Calculation 
If the body surface area is >  2.0m2 then drugs should be dosed at 2.[ADDRESS_498760] pre -medication  
After premedication, paclitaxel will be given at a dose of 175 mg/m2 as a 3 -hour infusion or 
135mg/m2 as a 3-hour infusion for those patients with prior pelvic radiotherapy 6.2.5 Paclitaxel/Carboplatin  dose 
Carboplatin dosed to an AUC of 5 for patients  receiving docetaxel rather than paclitaxel or with 
prior pelvic radiation; or AUC 6 for patients with prior radiation will be given IV over 30 minutes 
after paclitaxel.  
The dose of carboplatin will be calculated by [CONTACT_396516].  
CALVERT FORMULA:  
Carboplatin dose (mg) = (Target AUC) X (GFR + 25) 
For the purposes of this protocol, GFR will be estimated based on the calculated creatinine 
clearance ( Cockroft-Gault equation).  
Dosing of paclitaxel in patients with hepatic impairment is discussed in section 7.5.[ADDRESS_498761] be recalculated for each cycle if patient has weight change of greater 
than or equal to 10% from baseline. 
6.2.6 Regimen  
This regimen can be administered in an outpatien t setting.  
Regimen will be repeated every 28 days until unacceptable toxicity or progression.  In the event 
of a complete clinical response or partial response for which the treating physician believes cytotoxic chemotherapy with paclitaxel/carboplatin may  be safely discontinued, 4 cycles of 
combination therapy is recommended; treatment may be changed to monotherapy with galunisertib 
monotherapy with 28 day cycles with galunisertib alone on days 4-17. 
Recommended guidelines for dose reductions/discontinuation are described in section 7. 
6.[ADDRESS_498762] be develo ped 
following section 6 of the ICH guidelines.  
6.3.1 Administration  
Galunisertib will be administered orally 150mg , bid, 14 days on and 11days off starting on day 4 
and ending on 17 of a 28 day cycle.   
A cycle (28 days) will be defined as an intermittent dosing regimen of 14 days of galunisertib 
followed by 11 days without g alunisertib administration. Any missed doses should not be made 
up. No patient should receive more than 14 consecutive days of galunisertib dosing for safety 
reasons .  
Version 8.0 (22- Apr-2021) 
18 
 To date, galunisertib at the IB defined dose is well tolerated in patients. If a toxicity is observed  
that may be related to galunisertib , a dose reduction to 80 mg BID is permitted.   
6.3.2 Recommended Guidelines for D ose R eductions/ Discontinuation are as Follows:  
If a patient experiences any of the following events that are considered possibly related to 
galunisertib , galunisertib will be omitted until the event resolves:  
• Neutropenia with absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <0.5 x 109/L x 7 days, or ANC <1.0 x 
109/L with a single temperature of >101oF/38.3oC or a sustained temperature of 
>100.4oF/38oC for more than 1 hour, or  thrombocytopenia with platelet count < 50,000 x 
109/L  
• Hematologic toxicity must resolve to baseline or </= grade 1 prior to resumption of 
galunisertib therapy .  
• Non-hematologic toxicity must resolve to CTCAE Grade ≤1 or baseline (with the exception 
of alopecia, fatigue, skin rash, nausea, vomiting, constipation, or diarrhea that can be controlled with treatment).  
6.3.3 Dose reduction  
If dosing is delayed for treatment -related AEs for more than 2 weeks, and the patient recovers 
within 28days, the patient may continue at a reduced dose of 80 mg BID (160- mg total daily dose). 
If recovery is >[ADDRESS_498763] 
his/her dose reduced more than once. Dose re-escalation to the previous dose is not permitted. 
7 TREATMENT MODIFICATIONS  
Dose modification is based on history of prior pelvic radiation therapy, interim nadir levels , and  
delays due to pr e-treatment counts. No dose escalation will be permitted . Toxicity will be

paclitaxel + galunisertib or galunisertib alone will be one a case by [CONTACT_396517].  
No reduction below lowest dose level specified is allowed. If grade [ADDRESS_498767] dose levels, the Study Chair should be contact[CONTACT_396518] . 
Dosing of galunisertib should be held until hematologic parameters are within range for treatment.  
If dosing is delayed for treatment- related AEs for more than 2 weeks, and the patient recovers 
within 28 days, the patient may continue at a reduced dose of 80 mg BID (160- mg total daily dose). 
If recovery is >[ADDRESS_498768]

7.4.2 Pre-cycle I nitiation C ounts  
No subsequent course of therapy should be given until the ANC > 1500/mcl and the PLT count >  
75,000/mcl. If dose is held due to pre -treatment myelosuppression, recheck counts weekly. If 
therapy is delayed 3 weeks or longer from scheduled administration, the Study Chair should be 
notified and the patient should be removed from study tr eatment .

 7.5.2 Gastrointestinal  
Nausea/vomiting: Increased antiemetic therapy, outpatient IV hydration, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_396502].  
As reported greater than 48 hours following completion of chemotherapy cycle:  Grade 0 -3 toxicity - No change, Grade 4- reduce all drugs one dose level. 
Other toxicity: For any Grade  3-4 toxicity not mentioned above, protocol treatment should be 
withheld until patient recovers to ≤  Grade 1 status. Subsequent courses of therapy should be given 
with a one level dose reduction of agent(s) felt to be responsible. In general, unusual toxic ities 
should be discussed with the Study Chair. If therapy is delayed [ADDRESS_498769] immediately be discontinued from the treatment and the adverse event reported to Lilly within 24 hours (SAE). 
General Guidance for Cardiotoxicity monitoring  
Prior to Enrollment  
•  MRI or CT scan (with contrast) of chest will be locally assessed for enrol lment and safety 
decisions by a physician or a person who is qualified by [CONTACT_396519]. The 
objective of this evaluation is to assess for possible aneurysms of t he ascending aorta and 
aortic arch. Should the patient have a previous history of abdominal aneurysm, an additional abdominal MRI or CT is required. NOTE: If a chest MRI or CT scan (with contrast) is performed as part of standard screening and on- treatment  tumor assessment, 
this same  scan may be used for safety evaluation, provided that it properly assesses the 
great vessels of the heart.  
During Study  
•  CT with contrast or MRI will be conducted at 6 cycles and then as clinically indicated. 
30-days follow- up visit  
• MRI or CT scan with contrast of chest to assess the large vessels of the heart: Perform if there was no previous post -treatment scan, if findings were observed on a previous scan, 
or if clinically indicated . 
7.5.4 Hepatic F unction  
Dose adjustment of pacli taxel in patients with hepatic impairment include:  
3-hour infusion:  
• Transaminases <[ADDRESS_498770] and bilirubin level ≤1.[ADDRESS_498771]: 175 mg/m
2 
• Transaminases <[ADDRESS_498772]: 135 mg/m2 
Version 8.0 (22- Apr-2021)

9 EVALUATION CRITERIA   
9.1 Parameters of Outcome –RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_498782] one dimension (longest dimension to be recorded). Each lesion must be ≥ [ADDRESS_498783] and MRI; or ≥ 20 mm when measur ed by [CONTACT_69145], including plain x- ray.  
9.1.2 Baseline Documentation of “Target” and “Non-Target” lesions 
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and 
Version 8.0 (22- Apr-2021) 
25 
 measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the 
longest dimension) and their suitability for accurate repetitive measurements by [CONTACT_396520] (either by [CONTACT_14217]). A sum of the longest dimension 
(LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD. The baseline sum LD will be used as reference to further characterize the progression of the measurable dimension of the disease. Tumor within a previously irradiated field will be designated as “non-target” lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is obtained to confirm persistence at least 90 days following completion of radiation therapy.  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be 
recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and each of these lesions should be followed as stable (the persistence of a non -target lesion), complete response (the disappearance of a non-
target lesion) or progressive disease (the unequivocal progression of a non- target lesion).  
All baseline evaluations of disease status should be performed as close as possible to the start of treatment and never more than [ADDRESS_498784] be assessed using the same technique as baseline.  
9.1.3 Definition of D isease Progression  
Progression for patients with measurable disease at baseline is d efined as ANY of the following: 
• At least  a 20% increase in the sum of LD target lesions taking as reference the smallest 
sum LD recorded since study entry ; in addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum 
must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm 
• In the case where the ONLY target lesion is a solitary pelvic mass measured by [CONTACT_396521], a 50% increase in the LD is required taking as reference the smallest LD recorded since study entry  
• The appearance of one or more new lesions  
• Deat h due to disease without prior objective documentation of progression  
• Global deterioration in health status attributable to the disease requiring a change in therapy 
without objective evidence of progression  
• Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, other than pleural effusions 
without cytological proof of neoplastic origin, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_021] (in 
this circumstance an explanation must be provided)  
Progression for patients with non- measurable disease at baseline is defined as increasing clinical, 
radiological, or histological evidence of disease since study entry.

[ADDRESS_498786] will be ≥grade [ADDRESS_498787] d. 
10 DURATION OF STUDY  
Treatment may continue as long as the patient is receiving clinical benefit and not experiencing 
excessive toxicity or disease progression.  If a complete clinical response is achieved or for patients 
who come on study with no measurable disease (e.g. post operative early stage)  or achieve a 
durable partial response for which the treating physician feels discontinuation of cytotoxic 
chemotherapy is an option, 4 cycles of combination therapy is recommended with an option for 
main tenance therapy with galunisertib monotherapy until toxicity, progression.   
Follow- up is required as outlined in Section 8.1 In brief, patients will be seen every 28 days (prior 
to each cycle of therapy) while receiving active chemotherapy and/or galunisertib maintenance.  
CT scans to assess response will be performed prior to every odd cycle .  Patients will also be seen 
[ADDRESS_498788] visit, the patient will be followed up with phone check in every 3 month 
for duration of 2 years from date of registration . 
A patient is considered off study therapy when the patient has  progressed or died prior to 
completion of study therapy, a non- protocol drug or therapy (directed at the disease) is initiated or 
all study therapy is totally discontinued. Survival and progression data will continue to be collected.  
[ADDRESS_498789]. Investigators 
are required to report to Lilly Drug Safety ANY serious treatment emergent adverse event (STEAE) as soon as possible.   
A STEAE is any sign, symptom or medical condition that emerges during treatment or during a 
post- treatment follow -up period that (1) was not present at the start of treatment and it is not a 
chronic condition that is part of the patient’s medical history, OR (2) was present at the start of 
treatment or as part of the patient’s medical history but worsened in severity and/or frequency during therapy, AND that meets any of the following regulatory serious criteria:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Is disabling  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Version 8.0 (22- Apr-2021) 
27 
 • Is medically significant or requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of  the 
outcomes listed above.

Occasionally Lilly may contact [CONTACT_15483], clarification, or current status of the subject for whom and adverse event was reported.  
11.3 Assessing Causality  
Investigators are required to assess whether there is a reasonable possibility that galunisertib 
combined treatment caused or contributed to an adverse event.  The following general guidance may be used.  
Yes: if the temporal relationship of the clinical event to galunisertib administration makes a causal relationship possible, and other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions do not provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event. 
No: if the temporal relationship of the clinical event to galunisertib administration makes a causal relationship unlikely, or other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event.

Safety Report, of any serious, unexpected AE that is considered possibly related to the use of galunisertib.  An unexpected adverse event is one that is not already described in the Investigator Brochure.  
Written IND Safety Reports should include an Analysis of Similar Events in accordance with regulation 21 CFR § 312.32.  All safety reports previously filed with the IND concerning similar events should be analyzed.  The new report should contain comments on the significance of the new event in light of the previous, similar reports.   
Written IND safety reports with Analysis of Similar Events are to be submitted to the FDA, Lilly 
Drug Safety, and all participating investigators within [ADDRESS_498794] learning of the event.  The FDA prefers these reports on a MedWatch 3500a Form but alternative f ormats are 
acceptable (e.g. summary letter).  
A log of the IND safety reports will be submitted annually to the OUHSC IRB at the time of Continuing Review.  
b. IND Annual Reports  
In accordance with the regulation 21 CFR § 312.32, the Sponsor shall within [ADDRESS_498795] submit a brief report of the progress of the investigation.  Please refer to Code of Federal Reg ulations, 21 CFR § 312.[ADDRESS_498796] of the 
elements required for the annual report.  
11.5 Collection and R ecording A dverse E vents  
All adverse events (AEs) of any grade will be collected, identified using the MedDRA 
terminology, graded as to severity, assessed for causality, and followed until resolution. 
All AEs, regardless of the source of identification (eg, physical examination, laboratory  
assessment, ECG, reported by [CONTACT_4676]), must be documented in the eCRF and reported in the IND 
annual report. 
All AEs wil l be collected and recorded in the eCRF for each patient from the first day of dosing 
until [ADDRESS_498797] to follow-up, or until the patient has died. 
11.5.1 Definit ions 
Adverse event : An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that occurs in a patient or  
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, and which does not  
necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any  
unfavorable and unintended sign (including clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or  
not considered related to the product.  
Version 8.0 (22- Apr-2021) 
30 
 Adverse events may include the onset of new illness and the exacerbation of pre- existing medical  
conditions. An AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including  
baseline or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered. 
Treatment -emergent :  A treatment -emergent adverse event will be defined as any new AE that 
begins, or any  preexisting condition that worsens in severity, after at least 1 dose of study treatment 
has been  administered.  
Serious adverse event : A serious adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence  
that, at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  
o Note: This means that the patient is at immediate risk of death at the time of the  event; 
it does not mean that the event hypothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
o Any AE that prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_73524]. 
o Exception: Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (eg, for observation, protocol compliance, elective 
procedures, social reasons, etc.) will not be considered an SAE; however,  the reason 
for the planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_119515]. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• Is an important medical event(s)  
o An important medical event may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death 
or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_73527].  
11.5.[ADDRESS_498798] to study treatment as outlined in the following sections. 
Intensity  
Investigators should assess the severity of AEs according to CTCAE. In general, CTCAE ( Version 
4) severity grades are:  
Grade 1:  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only;         
intervention not indicated 
Grade 2:  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention  indicated; limiting 
ageappropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL). (Instrumental ADL 
refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone,  
managing money, etc.) 
Grade 3:  Severe or medically significant but not i mmediately life -threatening;  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting  self-
care ADL. (Self -care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding  self, 
using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden.) 
Grade 4:  Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated 
Grade 5:  Death related to AE  
Version 8.0 (22- Apr-2021) 
31 
 A distinction should be made between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity  
whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_119559] 7.4 and 7.5. For example, a mild 
degree of gastrointestinal bleeding requiring an overnight hospi[INVESTIGATOR_396505]. Similarly, an AE that is severe in intensity 
is not necessarily an SAE. For example, alopecia may be assessed as severe in intensity but m ay 
not be considered an SAE. 
Causality 
The Investigator will assess the causality/relationship between the study drug and the AE. One of  
the following categories should be selected based on medical judgment, considering the  definitions 
and all contributing factors:  
• Related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurs in a plausible  time 
relationship to treatment administration, and which concurrent disease or other  drugs or 
chemicals cannot explain. The response to withdrawal of the treatment  should be clinically 
plausible. 
• Possibly related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a  reasonable 
time sequence to administration of the treatment, unlikely to be attributed  to concurrent 
disease or other drugs or chemi cals. 
• Unlikely related:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a  temporal 
relationship to treatment administration which makes a causal relationship  improbable, or 
in which other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease provide likely explanations.  
• Unrelated:  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with little or no  
temporal relationship with treatment administration. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_396506] (eg, concomitant disease, environmental factors, or other dru gs or  chemicals).  
12 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
12.1 Data Analysis Plan 
(a) Definition of primary outcome/endpoint: 
1) Completion of 4 cycles - completion of a cycle will be defined as receiving both 
carboplatin/paclitaxel and taking ≥75% of the doses of GB for the cycle  
(b) Definition o f secondary outcomes/endpoints: 
1) Adverse event occurrence and grade, as assessed by [CONTACT_12397] v4.  
2) PFS- duration of time from enrollment to RECIST progression or death from any cause, 
censored at last disease assessment or loss to follow -up; and OS – duration of time from 
enrollment to death from any cause, censored at date last known alive or loss to follow -
up 
3) Galunisertib serum concentrations levels on day 4, 8 and 29 (cycle 2 day 1) 
(c) Exploratory: 
Correlate mRNA levels  of EMT markers (SNAI1, N -Cad) and TGFβ -I, TGFβR -I and 
TGFβR -II with response rate (complete response + partial response) and clinical benefit 
ratio (response rate + stable disease at 6 months)  
(d) Sample size and Analytic plan for primary objective: 
Version 8.0 (22- Apr-2021) 
32 
 The %  of patients completing 4 cycles will be calculated and a 90% confidence interval 
constructed for the completion rate. With 25 patients and an expected completion rate of 
60%, the lower bound of the two- sided exact Clopper -Pearson 90% confidence interval 
(CI) would be 42%, which provides sufficient evidence that the combined regimen is 
feasible for inclusion in a randomized Phase II study. The following table provides 90% 
confidence intervals when the expected completion rate ranges from 60% to 80%, with a sample size of 25. Patients who come off the treatment for disease progression but did not experience toxicity requiring termination of treatment will be included among those patients completing the target g oal of treatment of 4 cycles.  Assuming 30% of the  enrolled 
patients will drop out, we will enroll 36 patients to reach the targeted sample size (n = 25).  
# patients Expected rate of completing 4 cycles  90% Confidence interval 
25 60% 42% - 76% 
 70% 52% - 85% 
 80% 63% - 92% 
 
(e) Analytic plan for secondary objectives:  
1) To determine the frequency and severity of adverse events as assessed by [CONTACT_12397] v4. 
• Frequency and severity of adverse events will be tabulated, by [CONTACT_6764], type 
and maximum grade.  
2) To determine the PFS and OS of patients receiving combination CT + GB.  
• Median PFS and OS (and CIs) for patients who receive the combined regimen under study will be computed using the Kaplan -Meier curves and compared to a historical 
cohort of patients who received the standard care. 
3) To ascertain pharmacokinetic profile of GB when given in a combination regimen with 
CT. 
• Galunisertib levels will be drawn cycle 1 day 4: pre -dose and [ADDRESS_498799] 
dose; Day 8 and day 29: pre -dose for the first 6 patients 
• Levels over time will be summarized descriptively, as qua rtiles and range, and 
graphically using boxplots for example.  These will be compared to previous phase I data describing the pharmacokinetics of galunisertib to determine if it is significantly impacts by [CONTACT_3252] -administration of carboplatin/paclitaxel.  
4) To de termine if mRNA levels of TGFβ -I, TGFβ -II, TGFβR -I  a n d  T G F β R -II are 
associated with response to galunisertib therapy including galunisertib. 
• The response rate (complete response + partial response) and clinical benefit ratio 
(response rate + stable disease at 6 months) w ill be tabulated according to high and 
low mRNA (divided by [CONTACT_396523]) concentrations of TGFβ -
I, TGFβ -II, TGFβR -I and TGFβR -II. Because of the sample size, these analyses are 
hypothesis generating and hypothesis testing will not be conducted. 
Version 8.0 (22- Apr-2021) 
33 
 (f) Accrual  
[ADDRESS_498800] 
received ≥ 3cycles of treatment. If a DLT occurs in 2  or more patient, the dose of GB will be 
decreased to  a lower level (level - 1) at 80mg, PO, BID  and an additional analysis will then be 
conducted after [ADDRESS_498801] completed ≥ 3cycles. DLT is defined as either hematologic or non-
hematologic toxicity (a ssessed in accordance with the CTCAE Version 4.0), which cause any of 
the following: 
Hematologic Toxicity:  
• Dose delay of greater than 3 weeks due to failure to recover counts. 
• Study treatment -related febrile neutropenia.  
• Grade 4 neutropenia lasting > 7 day s. 
• Study treatment- related Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or bleeding associated with Grade 3 
thrombocytopenia. 
Non-Hematologic Toxicity:  
• Study treatment- related Grade 3 or Grade 4 non -hematological toxicity (excluding 
alopecia, fatigue, hypersensitivity reactio n), (if controlled w/ medications exclude nausea, 
vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia) 
• Any drug -related death  
All AEs of the 6 patients will be listed. With 6 patients, there is high probability (>0 .80) to observe 
at least one DLT, if the true DLT rate is at least 25% (Table 1). The probability of observing ≥2 DLTs is high (≥0.77) if the true rate of DLTs is at least 40% (Table 1).

13 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN 
Safety oversight will be performed  by [CONTACT_176133]’s (SCC) internal Data and Safety 
Monitoring Committee (DSMC). The DSMC is composed of individuals with the appropriate expertise in adult and pediatric hematology and medical oncology, radiation oncology, translational and corr elative science, pharmacy, nursing and biostatistics. The DSMC operates 
under the rules of an approved data safety monitoring plan which complies with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) guidelines published as Essential Elements of a Data and Safety Monit oring 
Plan for Clinical Trials Funded by [CONTACT_176134] 2005 and the “ NIH Policy for Data and 
Version 8.0 (22- Apr-2021) 
34 
 Safety Monitoring,” NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts , 
http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice- files/not98 -084.html .  
The Data Safety Monitoring Committee is charged with oversight of participant safety, study 
conduct and the validity and integrity of data for clinical trials at SCC. While the focus of the DSMC is to monitor interventional investigator initiated trials (IITs) that are not subject to external monitoring, it has the authority to monitor any SCC protocol when potential concerns are identified. The DSMC also has the authority to suspend or close a study until the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_396507]. The DSMC 
reports all findings to the Institutional Review Board (IRB).  
Under the direction of the DSMC chair, a full board meeting is convened on a quarterly  basis to 
review the accumulated safety data, accrual information, and additional inform ation as stated in 
the DSMC plan.  
13.[ADDRESS_498802] safety and 
data quality. All cancer -related clinical trials active at the SCC are eligible for audit; however, pri ority 
is placed on those clinical trials that are not monitored or audited by [CONTACT_176135]. If an external entity conducts an audit of a clinical trial at the SCC, then the findings of that audit are reported to the 
DSMC, either through the formal audit report provided by [CONTACT_176136], if available, or 
from the PI, who will report any findings communicated during the audit process.
 
[ADDRESS_498803] KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]

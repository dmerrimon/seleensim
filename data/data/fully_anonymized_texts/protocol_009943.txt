 You are asked to participate in a research study conducted by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Suh- Jen 
Lin from the School of Physical Therapy at the Institute of Health Sciences – 
Dallas, [LOCATION_007] Woman’s  University. This project is being completed as part of 
a faculty study project. Your  participation in this study is entirely voluntary; you 
can quit at any time. Please read the  information below and ask questions 
about anything you do not understand, before  deciding whether or not to 
participate.  
 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY  
To explore the effect of exercise training on shortness of breath and endurance of the  heart, and to examine the additional benefits of breathing 
muscle training on physical  activity, breathing muscle strength, heart rate 
response, walking speed, and  quality of life.  
 PROCEDURES  
If you volunteer to participate in this study, you will be asked to do the following things:  Participate in initial tests consisting of a 6- minute walk test, 
breathing muscle strength testing, comfortable walking test, grip strength test, 
single limb stance test, and quality of  life survey. During the walk test, you will 
be put on a finger oximeter to monitor your  heart rate and oxygen saturation 
throughout the test. You will also be asked basic  information about your 
health, age, height, and weight. At the end of test session, you will be given a 
pedometer to wear and to record the number of steps you take each day.  You 
are required to record your steps in a daily log. You will also be provided a unit of  accelerometer (a delicate unit of pedometer) to monitor your steps 
duration for the first  week and the 6th week. You will need to return this 
accelerometer to us at the end of  recording. The initial session at our site will 
last for about two hours.   
 You will be asked to participate in a daily walking program and breathing muscle training  program. The breathing exercise is about 15 minutes a day. 
The walking program is to accumulate about 40- 45 minutes of walking a day. 
You can begin with short 15 minutes  of walking twice a day;  then gradually 
increase your walking routine as your capacity  improves. For the weekly 
follow up (about 15 minutes), you need to come to our site to re-assess your  
inspi[INVESTIGATOR_462402]. If you have transport ation issue, we will try to conduct the weekly reassessment at 
your home if time and scheduling are allowed. Then, the researcher will reset 
you training target step count  and target breathing intensity of the following 
week. At the end of six weeks, you w ill return to our site for a 2- hr visit to 
repeat the tests done during week one.

of confidentiality. This  will be managed by [CONTACT_462404]. All data will be stored in a locked filing cabinet in a locked 
research room, and data will be destroyed upon completion of this study. The 
researchers will try to prevent any problem that could happen because of this 
research. You should let the researchers know at once if there is a problem 
and they will help you. However, TWU does not provide medical services or  
financial as sistance for injuries that might happen because you are taking part 
in this  research.  
 POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO SUBJECTS  
You will benefit from the free access to the breathing muscle training equipment and  instruction on proper use. You will also benefit from  the effects 
of exercise due to the daily walking program. A free pedometer and a heart 
rate monitor will also be provided for you to keep. You will be provided with 
$[ADDRESS_592119] the [LOCATION_007] Woman’s University  Office of Research & 
Sponsored Programs at (940) 898- 3378 or [EMAIL_8877].  I understand 
the procedures  described above. My questions have been answered to my  
satisfaction, and I agree to participate in this study. I have been given a copy of this form.

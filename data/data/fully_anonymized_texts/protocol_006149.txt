INTRODUCTION: 
 
Alopecia areata (AA) is an auto-immune disease characterized by [CONTACT_105]-scarring hair loss 
that can sometimes progress to total loss of all scalp and body hair.1 The life-time risk of 
AA has been reported to be 1.7%.2 AA can cause tremendous emotional and 
psychosocial distress in affected patients and their families. There is a lack of effective 
treatments for patients with alopecia areata. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_418665], probably because of limited penetration. Intralesional injections of 
corticosteroids are effective but can only be considered for patients with limited 
involvement. Immunotherapy with diphencyprone or squaric acid dibutyl is effective in 
some patients but is usually limited to treatment of scalp involvement and can cause 
significant pruritus and dermatitis. None of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_418666]. There is a need for new treatment 
options for patients with alopecia areata especially based on the recently evolving 
understanding of the disorder.  
 
The histologic hallmark of AA is perifollicular inflammation and a peribulbar infiltrate of 
predominantly lymphocytes around anagen hair follicles, known as a “swarm of bees”. 
This feature is typi[INVESTIGATOR_745519], and may not be present in 
chronic cases. While the etiology of AA remains unknown, studies have suggested 
infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and a predominant Th1 cytokine profile in the 
etiology of this disease, leading to destruction of the hair follicle immune privilege site.  
 
During the last decade, interleukin (IL)-[ADDRESS_1019758] demonstrated markedly elevated IL-17 levels in blood from 
patients with alopecia areata (unpublished but presented at the EADV in 2013).  IL-[ADDRESS_1019759] been sown in both ser um and lesional skin 
of AA patients.7 Furthermore, preliminary analyses from our laboratory (Fig. 1) showed 
an elevation of IL-[ADDRESS_1019760] further shown 
that p40, IL-13, IFN-γ, IL-12RB1, IL-22, JAK3 are all significantly induced in AA (p<0.05) 
in a similar fashion as in AD when comparing lesional with nonlesional skin. 
 
 [ADDRESS_1019761] is an oral small molecule phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitor that has 
been shown to regulate inflammatory mediators.[ADDRESS_1019762] enters cells by [CONTACT_745526], once intracellular, binds PDE4. PDE-4, the dominant phosphodiesterase 
expressed in immune cells, degrades cyclic AMP (cAMP) into AMP. PDE4 inhibition 
thereby [CONTACT_745527], which can down-regulate the inflammatory 
responses such as TNF-α, IFN-γ, interleukins (IL) 2, 12, 17, and [ADDRESS_1019763] beneficial effects in 
AA. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved apremilast for the 
treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis in March 2014, and for patients 
with moderate- to-severe plaque psoriasis in September 2014.

expression of both IL-17A and IFN gamma, with significantly lower expression of IL- 13 
as compared with both AA and AD. Significant decreases in mRNA expression of IL-13, 
and IL12/23p40 are seen after treatment with intralesional corticosteroids, without 
significant changes in the other cytokines. P value= 0.0002 for the IL-13, and p=0.1 for

 7  STUDY DESIGN: 
 
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_745520]. A total of 30 subjects with moderate to severe alopecia areata (including 
universalis and totalis) involving 50-100% of the scalp will be enrolled.  A possible 
maximum of 15 patients (approximately 7 patients  each ) with current epi[INVESTIGATOR_745521] / universalis may be included in this study. 
In Phase 1, subjects will be randomized (2:1) to either receive apremilast or placebo for 
[ADDRESS_1019764] from Week 24 through Week 48 . 
The following subjects will be eligible to enter into Phase 2: 
1. Subjects who received placebo in Phase [ADDRESS_1019765] in Phase 1 of the study, and who achieved 
any minimum of 50% regrow th (SALT 50)  at Week 24, compared to Baseline. 
 
After providing informed consent, subjects will be assessed for study eligibility at the 
Screening visit (day -28 to day - 1), which includes limited physical examination , 
assessment of regrowth pattern , SALT scoring, review of medical history and 
concomitant as well as prior medications/treatments , and serum pregnancy test (if 
applicable) . Laboratory tests will be performed for complete Blood Count (CBC) and 
white blood cell count (WBC) with differentials (basophils, eosinophils, lympho cytes, 
monocytes, neutrophils), serum chemistry for albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 
alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatinine, potassium, 
sodium and total bilirubin , as well as h epatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) and hepatitis C 
antibody .  
 
Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will undergo Baseline / Day 0 assessments. These 
assessments include hair examination, SALT scoring, aaPGA scoring, review of 
concomitant medications , clinical photography, questionnaires (AASIS and AA-QoL) , 
and urine pregnancy test (if applicable) . Blood samples will be collected for mechanistic 
studies, DNA analysis and RNA and proteomic analysis. Two biopsies of the scalp will 
be performed : one from an area affected with alopecia areata and one from an area that 
is not affected. If the subject has 100% hair loss, then only one biopsy from an affected 
area will be performed.  At this Baseline visit, subjects will undergo randomization, and 
will receive the first oral dose of study drug (apremilast or placebo). 
 
Subjects will be provided with the study drug, and will receive twice daily (BID) dosing of 
study drug (apremilast or placebo orally) through Week 24.  
 
Subjects will return for visits every four weeks through Week 24 (Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 
and 24) so that a review of concomitant medications and adverse events can be 
assessed.  Females of childbearing potential will undergo a urine pregnancy test at 
each of these visits. Additional study drug will be dispensed every 4 weeks. In addition, 
the following procedures will be collected at various time points: 
 
 Week 4: assessment of regrowth pattern , SALT scoring, aaPGA scoring.  
   
 8  Week 8: assessment of regrowth pattern, SALT scoring, aaPGA scoring, and 
clinical photography.  
 
Week 12: assessment of regrowth pattern , SALT scoring, aaPGA scoring, clinical 
photography, blood tests (for mechanistic studies, Pax RNA and proteomic 
analysis), and questionnaires (AASIS and AA-QoL) . One optional biopsy of the 
scalp (close to the involved area that was biopsied at Baseline) may be performed. 
 
Weeks 16 and 20 : assessment of regrowth pattern, SALT scoring, aaPGA scoring.  
 
Week 24: limited physical examination, assessment of regrowth pattern , SALT 
scoring, aaPGA scoring, clinical photography, questionnaires (AASIS and AA-
QoL
), blood tests (for mechanistic studies , RNA and proteomic analysis) , and one 
scalp biopsy will be performed (in the vicinity of the involved area biopsied at 
Baseline).  
 
At the Week [ADDRESS_1019766] (30 mg twice daily). Subjects who received apremilast in Phase 1 and 
showe d  no regrowth will be discontinued from the study.  
 
Subjects continuing in Phase 2 will return to the site every 4 weeks through Week 52 
(Weeks 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48 and 52) so that a review of concomitant medications and 
adverse events can be assessed.   Females of childbearing potential will undergo a 
urine pregnancy test at each of these visits (except Week 52). In addition, the following 
procedures will be collected at various time points: 
 
Weeks 28 and 32: assessment of regrowth pattern, SALT scoring, aaPGA scoring 
and clinical photography. 
 
Week 36: assessment of regrowth pattern, SALT scoring, aaPGA scoring, clinical 
photography, and questionnaires (AASIS and AA-QoL). 
 
Weeks 40 and 44: assessment of regrowth pattern, SALT scoring, aaPGA scoring 
and clinical photography. 
 
Week 48: limited physical examination, assessment of regrowth pattern, SALT 
scoring, aaPGA scoring, clinical photography, and questionnaires (AASIS and AA-
QoL
).  
 
Subjects will end treatment with apremilast at Week [ADDRESS_1019767] terminates  early or chooses to discontinue the study, he/she will be asked to 
 9  return for a final visit, which would include: limited physical examination, examination of 
hair, SALT scoring, aaPGA scoring, clinical photography and questionnaires (AASIS 
and AA-QoL).  If the subject terminates or discontinues prior to Week 24, then the Early 
Termination Visit will also include blood tests (for mechanistic studies, RNA and 
proteomic analysis) and one scalp biopsy (in the vicinity of the involved area biopsied at 
Baseline ). 
 
Subjects will not receive any other active treatment for alopecia areata (outside of the 
study drug) while participating in the study.  
 
Apremilast will be provided as 10-, 20-, or 30-mg tablets. Apremilast will be taken orally 
twice daily, approximately [ADDRESS_1019768], the dose will be titrated in 10- mg/day 
increments. Following the 5-day titration, the recommended maintenance dosage is 30 
mg twice daily taken orally starting on Day 6. This titration is intended to reduce the 
gastrointestinal symptoms associated with initial therapy.  
 
Day 1: 10 mg in morning 
Day 2: 10 mg in morning and 10 mg in evening 
Day 3: 10 mg in morning and 20 mg in evening  
Day 4: 20 mg in morning and 20 mg in evening  
Day 5: 20 mg in morning and 30 mg in evening  
Day 6 and thereafter: [ADDRESS_1019769] will be performed at Screening and urine 
pregnancy tests  will be performed at Baseline and every 4 weeks thereafter , in females 
of childbearing potential.   
 
Efficacy will be evaluated using the Severity Alopecia Tool (SALT)11 score, and the 
alopecia areata Physician Global Assessment (aaPGA). The SALT score is a 
mathematical approach to the determination of hair loss and hair regrowth.12 The 
percentage of scalp hair loss in each of the sides, back and top of the scalp are 
determined independently, and are multiplied by [CONTACT_745528] a final total percentage 
hair loss, designated as the SALT score . (Appendix 1). 
 
Alopecia areata Physician Global Assessment ( aaPGA): a static PGA score is widely 
used as a primary efficacy point of treatment success in many studies of dermatological 
diseases. The static aaPGA score represents an overall static evaluation of the 
alopecia, performed by [CONTACT_192675]. It utilizes a scale of 6-points, 
ranging from 0 (no regrowth) to 5 (100% regrowth), with 0:no regrowth; 1:<25% of 
regrowth; 2: 25%-49% of regrowth; 3:50%-74% of regrowth; 4:75%-99% of re- growth; 
5:100% of regrowth). (Appendix 2). 
 
 [ADDRESS_1019770] scale 
(AASIS)13 and the Alopecia Areata Quality of Life Index (AA-QLI).14 (Appendices 3 and 
4). 
 
Skin biopsies from the scalp will be performed on all subjects at Baseline and Week 24 
or Early Termination visit (if prior to Week 24). At Baseline, biopsies will be obtained 
from involved and uninvolved areas of the scalp (except in the case of 100% 
involvement, when only 1 biopsy of involved scalp will be biopsied). At Week 24 or Early 
Termination visit, the biopsy will be performed in the vicinity of the involved area 
biopsied at baseline. An optional biopsy will be performed at Week 12, close to the area 
that was involved at baseline. All skin biopsies will be 4.5 mm in diameter. 
 
At Baseline, serum will be obtained for DNA  (1 PaxGene), RNA (2 PaxGene), and 
proteomic analysis (2 tubes serum). Studies of RNA, and proteomic analysis will further 
be performed at Weeks [ADDRESS_1019771] been 
shown to be elevated in patients with alopecia areata. Thus, for mechanistic research 
purposes, we will assess Th1 (interferon gamma) and Th2 (IL-13) cytokines, as well as 
a panel of ten Th1 and Th2 chemokines ( CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL17, CCL18, CCL22, 
CCL26, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5) (using MSD) in serum before and after apremilast 
treatment.

RISKS OF APREMILAST 
As of [ADDRESS_1019776] has been given to about 5200 subjects (people).  The 
following are the most commonly seen risks, discomforts and side effects in subjects 
who have taken apremilast:  headache including tension headache, stuffiness or 
infections of the nose and throat (upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_745524]), stomach upset (nausea), vomiting and diarrhea.  Most of these side 
effects were mild to moderate in intensity and resolved with continued treatment.  
 [ADDRESS_1019777]: 
 Very common:  diarrhea, nausea (stomach upset), vomiting.  
 Common:  Upper abdominal (stomach) pain, indigestion, frequent bowel 
movement, heartburn, fatigue, bronchitis (infection of the tubes to the lungs), 
redness/swelling/pain in the sinuses, inflammation or infections of the nose and 
throat, weight loss, decreased appetite, back pain, headache (including tension 
and migraine), difficulty sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], depression, cough, rash, dizziness, weakness, 
flu, muscle pain, numbness, itchiness. 
 Uncommon:  allergic reaction. 
Reports of various types of cancers, heart problems, and serious infections have been 
found from apremilast studies. However, these events in patients being treated with 
apremilast happened as often as those being treated with placebo (sugar pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]).  
Drugs in the same family as apremilast have been shown to produce inflammation 
around the vessels of the skin (vasculitis) in rats and mice. Skin vasculitis has been 
rarely reported equally in patients  taking apremilast or placebo.   
Depression and weight loss have  been reported with the use of apremilast, thus, 
su
bjects will be questioned about any mood changes and weight loss at each visit.  
 
SAFETY MONITORING 
The study will be conducted in accordance with our department’s Standard Operating 
Procedures, which are based on US FDA Title [ADDRESS_1019778]’s 
safety is compromised, the investigator will discontinue the subject immediately.   
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_199217] [ADDRESS_1019779] some or all of the following 
procedures: limited physical examination; blood test; pregnancy test; clinical 
photography; assessment of regrowth pattern; hair evaluation; SALT assessment; 
aaPGA; questionnaires (AASIS and AA-QoL); assessment of concomitant medication 
and adverse events; biopsy of scalp. 
 
ADVERSE EVENTS 
An adverse event (AE) is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence 
occurring at any dose that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a 
study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or 
any concomitant impairment of the subject’s health, including laboratory test values (as 
specified by [CONTACT_65801]), regardless of etiology. Any medical condition that was 
present prior to study treatment and that remains unchanged or improved should not be 
recorded as an AE. If there is a worsening of that medical condition this should be 
considered an AE. A diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page of the 
Case Report From rather than the individual signs or symptoms of the diagnosis or 
syndrome. 
All AEs will be recorded by [CONTACT_737](s) from the time of signing the informed 
consent through the end of the designated follow-up period. 
Abnormal laboratory values defined as adverse events 
An abnormal laboratory value is considered to be an AE if the laboratory abnormality is 
characterized by [CONTACT_39132]: 
 Results in discontinuation from the study. 
 Requires treatment, modification/interruption of study drug dose, or any other 
therapeutic intervention. 
 Is judged by [CONTACT_737](s) to be of significant clinical importance. 
If a laboratory abnormality is one component of a diagnosis or syndrome, then only the 
diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page of the CRF. If the 
abnormality was not a part of a diagnosis or syndrome, then the laboratory abnormality 
should be recorded as the AE. 
Serious adverse event 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE which: 
 Results in death 
 Is life-threatening (i.e., in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689](s) the subject is at 
immediate risk of death from the AE) 
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
 16   Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (a substantial 
disruption of the subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions) 
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 Constitutes an important medical event 
Important medical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be 
immediately life threatening or result in death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or disability, but may 
jeopardize the subject or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes listed above.  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in 
deciding whether such an AE should be considered serious. 
Events not considered to be SAEs are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65777]: were planned before 
entry into the clinical study; are for elective treatment of a condition unrelated to the 
studied indication or its treatment; occur on an emergency outpatient basis and do not 
result in admission (unless fulfilling other criteria above); are part of the normal 
treatment or monitoring of the studied indication and are not associated with any 
deterioration in condition. 
If an AE is considered serious, both the AE pages of the CRF and the SAE Report Form 
must be completed. 
For each SAE, the Investigator(s) will provide information on severity, start and stop 
dates, relationship to study drug, action taken regarding study drug, and outcome. 
Classification of severity 
For both AEs and SAEs, the investigator(s) must assess the severity of the event. The 
AEs will be evaluated for severity according to the following scale: 
Grade 1 = Mild 
Grade 2 = Moderate 
Grade 3 = Severe 
 
Classification of Relationship/Causality of adverse events (SAE/AE) to study drug 
The Investigator(s) must determine the relationship between the administration of study 
drug and the occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not Suspected or Suspected as defined 
below: 
Not 
suspected : The temporal relationship of the adverse event to study 
drug administration makes a causal relationship 
unlikely or remote , or other medicat ions, therapeutic 
interventions, or underlying conditions provide a sufficient 
explanation for the observed event  
Suspected:  The temporal relationship of the adverse event to study 
drug administration makes a causal relationship 
possible,  and other medications, therapeutic 
interventions, or underlying conditions do not provide a 
sufficient explanation for the observed event.  
 17  Immediate reporting of serious adverse events  
Any AE that meets the any criterion for a SAE requires the completion of an SAE Report 
Form in addition to being recorded on the AE pages of the CRF.  The Investigator(s) is 
required to ensure that the data on these forms is accurate and consistent.  This applies 
to all SAEs, regardless of relationship to study drug, that occur during the study, those 
made known to the Investigator(s) within [ADDRESS_1019780]’s last dose of study 
drug, and those made known to the investigator(s) at anytime that are suspected of 
being related to study drug. 
The SAE must be reported immediately (i.e., within 24 hours of the Investigators’ 
knowledge of the event) to Celgene Safety by [CONTACT_276869].   A written report 
(prepared by [CONTACT_737](s) using an SAE Report Form or a 3500A Medwatch form  
is to be faxed to Safety (see below for contact [CONTACT_3031]).

The SAE report should provide a detailed description of the SAE.  If a subject has died 
and an autopsy has been performed, copi[INVESTIGATOR_397416].  Any follow-up data will 
be detailed in a subsequent SAE Report Form or Medwatch form and sent to Celgene. 
The Investigator(s) is responsible for informing the Institutional Review Board/Ethics 
Committee (IRB/IEC) of the SAE and providing them with all relevant initial and follow-
up information about the event. The Investigator(s) must keep copi[INVESTIGATOR_397417], including correspondence with Celgene and the IRB/IEC, on file.  All SAEs 
that have not resolved upon discontinuation of the subject’s participation in the study 
must be followed until either the event resolves completely, stabilizes , resolves w ith 
sequelae, or returns to baseline (if a baseline value is available).  
 
Contraception Education  
The risks to a fetus or to a nursing child from apremilast are not known at this time.  
Results of the animal and in vitro studies can be found in the IB.    
All females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must use one of the approved 
contraceptive options as described under inclusion criterion # [ADDRESS_1019782].  Male subjects (including those who have had a vasectomy) 
who engage in activity in which conception is possible must adhere to inclusion criterion 
# [ADDRESS_1019783] ’s contraceptive methods  or ability to become pregnant changes at any 
time during the study, the Investigator will educate the subject regarding options and 
correct and consistent use of effective contraceptive methods in order to successfully 
prevent pregnancy.  
 
 
Pregnancies 
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless 
of age or disease state) of a female subject or the female partner of a male subject  
occurring while the subject is on study drug, or within [ADDRESS_1019784]’s last dose 
of study drug, are considered immediately reportable events.  Study drug is to be 
discontinued immediately and the subject instructed to return any unused portion of  the 
study drug to the investigator(s).  The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or positive 
pregnancy test must be reported to Celgene Safety immediately  via facsimile or email 
using the Pregnancy Report form provided by [CONTACT_27718].  
The female should be referred to an obstetrician-gynecologist experienced in 
reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. 
The Investigator(s) will follow the female subject until completion of the pregnancy, and 
must notify Celgene Safety of the outcome of the pregnanc y as a follow -up on the follow 
up Pregnancy Reporting form.  
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as a SAE 
(i.e., spontaneous or therapeutic abortion [any congenital anomaly detected in an 
aborted fetus is to be do cumented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly 
[including that in an aborted fetus]), the Investigator(s) should follow the procedures for 
reporting SAEs (i.e., report the event to Celgene Safety by [CONTACT_31950] 24 hours of 
the Investigat or’s knowledge of the event).  
In the case of a live “normal” birth, Celgene Safety should be advised by [CONTACT_31950] 
24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event.  
All neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_1019785] 
to causality, as SAEs.  In addition, any infant death after 30 days that the Investigator(s) 
suspects is related to the in utero exposure to the study drug should also be reported to 
Celgene Safety by [CONTACT_31950] 24 hours of the Investigator s’ knowledge of the 
event.  
If the female is found not to be pregnant, any determination regarding the subject’s 
continued participation in the study will be determined by [CONTACT_737](s) .  
 
Proposed Mechanistic studies: 
In order to identify the molecular and cellular profiles  of alopecia areata at Baseline, and 
identify treatment response biomarkers, we plan to perform lesional (LS) a nd  
nonlesional ( NL) 4.5 mm punch biopsies at Baseline and after 24 weeks of treatment 
(LS only) as above (from the same area previously biopsied, but not from the scar).  
 
 19  Gene expression studies (RT-PCR and gene arrays), and immunohistochemistry will be 
performed.  
 
The expression levels of markers of the different immune pathways, including: Th1 
(IFN-gamma, CXCL9, CXCL10, MX1, IL-12RB1, IL-12RB2), Th17 (IL- 17A, IL23p19, 
IL23p40, CCL20, CXCL1, elafin/PI3), Th2 (IL-13, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, CCL17, CCL18, 
CCL22, CCL5), T22/IL-22 cytokine and IL-17/IL-22 regulated S100s genes (S100A12), 
Th9/IL-9, and general T-cell activation (IL-2, IL-15, IL-2RA, IL-15RA), JAK3, as well as 
IL-16, and IL-32, and keratin associated genes (Keratins 35, 75, 85, 86 ), will be 
evaluated using RT-PCR. We will also assess for modulation of inflammatory markers 
(i.e MMP12), and innate immune genes (IL- 1b, IL-8) by [CONTACT_937]-PCR.  
 
Gene arrays will also be performed. The Affymetrix U133A Plus 2 gene array platform 
will be used.   
 
Skin infiltration by T-cells, DCs, and Langerhans cells will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_9064]. The following markers will be used: CD3 and CD8 for T cells, 
Langerin for Langherans cells, CD11c for myeloid DCs. A similar score to ALADIN will 
be used, however, taking into account more hair and keratin biomarkers.  
 
STATISTICAL ANALYSES:  
Sample size considerations 
This is an exploratory study therefore the sample size has been kept relatively low. Data 
collected from this study will be used to obtain estimates of differences and variability of 
the study outcomes. Therefore there will be no formal hypothesis testing and power 
calculation in this study.   
Nevertheless, consider the primary outcome is the % of patients who achieve a 50% 
improvement in their SALT score after 24 weeks of treatment, with a sample size of 
20:[ADDRESS_1019786]  approximately 40% 
superiority. This calculation is based on the use of a one-tail Fisher’s exact test at 
alpha=0.05 level, 80% power and was obtained with the software Gpower.  
Impact of the sample size on the biomarkers outcomes:  Gulati et.al. (2014) )[3]  reported 
a standard deviation equal to 3.45 for IFNg’s log 2FCH between baseline and after 
DPCP treatment at Week [ADDRESS_1019787] size of 0.87 (which 
corresponds to a log 2FCH larger than 3) with power of 95% in a 95% two-side t-Test for 
paired samples. Considering Bonferroni correction for [ADDRESS_1019788] 
size could be detected with a power of 80%. 
Statistical Analys is 
Primary outcome: A one-tail Fisher exact test will be used to compare the percentage 
 20  of patients who achieve 50% improvement in the SALT score after 24 weeks of 
treatment between drug and placebo groups.   
Secondary Outcomes: 
A Mixed effect model repeated measures (MMRM) will be used to detect any overall 
differences in the treatment effect as compared to placebo. The differences in SALT 
score between Baseline values and those at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and [ADDRESS_1019789] for paired samples. 
Similar analysis will be carried out for the secondary endpoints at Week 48. 
 
MECHANISTIC STUDIES STATISTICAL ANALYSES: 
For comparison of expression levels of lesional, and non-lesional AA skin, we will use 
RT-PCR, and gene-arrays. RT-PCR values will be normalized to the housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_418667] (validated in all our AD studies) and log2-transformed prior to analysis. 
Microarray data will be preprocessed using standard pi[INVESTIGATOR_19189] (exhaustively used by [CONTACT_418682] a large number of studies) and log-[ADDRESS_1019790] model on R’s limma framework will be used and p-values for the moderated t-
tests and paired-t-test will be adjusted by [CONTACT_418683]-Hochberg procedure.  
Extensive bioinformatics tools will be employed to gain insights into the results and test 
hypotheses that are generated in the “data mining stage”.  This will include (but will not 
be limited to) pathway and gene-set enrichment analyses using Ingenuity software, 
GSEA, the R package GSVA (Gene Set Variation Analysis) and other in-house codes 
produced by [CONTACT_27156]. To define cellular and molecular biomarkers of AA in skin 
biopsies, biomarkers will be divided into those that show significant group differences 
and those that do not. Multiple regression models will be used to determine the best set 
of biomarkers that predict disease activity and response. Similar approaches will be 
carried out for blood analyses. 
Gene expression changes in Th2/IL-13, “T22”/IL- 22, S100A7 and S100A8, Th1/IFN-
gamma, and Th17/IL-17A will be jointly correlated with clinical responses by [CONTACT_418684] u-statistics and R package muStat, as we have previously 
 [ADDRESS_1019791] Scale (AASIS) at 
Week 24 and the change from Baseline in the Alopecia Areata Quality of Life 
questionnaire (AA-QoL) at Week [ADDRESS_1019792] for paired samples will be used. 
Safety and Tolerability Analysis 
Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_220131] (AEs) and will be presented 
with descriptive statistics at each visit. AEs will be coded using the CTCAE, Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, V 4.0. The number and percentage of 
subjects/lesions experiencing an AE/SAE will be stratified by [CONTACT_9313], or a 
preferred term, and/or severity of the adverse event, and recorded and tabulated overall 
by [CONTACT_199231]-strata.  Each subject will be counted only once within a system organ class 
or a preferred term using the adverse events with the highest severity within each 
category. All information pertaining to adverse events noted during the study will be 
listed by [CONTACT_1130], detailing verbatim given by [CONTACT_093], preferred term, system 
organ class, date of onset, date of resolution, severity, and relationship to treatment. A 
tabulation of AEs will be provided by [CONTACT_1130]. For local subcutaneous adverse events, 
the rate of AEs will be compared between groups. The proportion of lesions in each 
treatment group reporting adverse events that occur in ~ 5% in either treatment group 
will be compared using the Fisher’s exact test.

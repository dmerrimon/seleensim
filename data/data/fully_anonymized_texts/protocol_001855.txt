2. BACKGROUND and  SIGNIFICANCE  
According to the National Spi[INVESTIGATOR_223645], as many as 300,[ADDRESS_433644] injury  (SCI),  with approximately  17,[ADDRESS_433645] met with only limited 
succes s.2, 3 Complete recovery is reported in less than 1% of SCI survivors.[ADDRESS_433646] current stimulation has been shown to significantly influence corticomotor 
excitability (a marker of neuroplasticity).6-[ADDRESS_433647] current 
stimulation: anodal stimulation over the primary motor cortex leads to a depolarization of the neuronal 
membrane’s resting potential and thus increases motor cortical excitability; cathodal stimulation 
causes the opposite effect.10-[ADDRESS_433648] current stimulation (tsDCS). Possible mechanisms 
include alteration of GABAergic and glutamatergic systems.13-[ADDRESS_433649] injury (SCI). SSEPs have

investigation of this promising intervention by [CONTACT_349009], electrophysiologica l data prior 
to rapid clinical translation of findings. In general, our proposal has exceedingly high 
translational potential. The non -invasive stimulation we propose (tsDCS) is delivered by a 
portable device that can be easily carried and applied in a div ersity of clinical settings, including 
inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation.  
 
3. PURPOSE OF THE  STUDY:  
The purpose of the study is to investigate the effects of a novel therapeutic approach to promote 
functional recovery and spasticity in chronic SCI. We w ill evaluate tsDCS effect on neuro - 
physiological measure such as H reflex and SSEP in subjects with SCI. This incremental, 
design will allow us to establish strong, electrophysiological data prior to rapid clinical translation 
of our findings about this p romising, early -stage  technique.  
The central hypothesis is twofold: 1) active tsDCS will lead to a change in Hmax/M max ratio 
than sham tsDCS, in a polarity dependent manner; and 2) active tsDCS will lead to a change in 
SSEP amplitude and latency, in a pol arity dependent manner.  
Hypothesis: To evaluate the effects of tsDCS and different polarities on spi[INVESTIGATOR_348974]/M max ratio and SSEPs.  
Hypothesis 1: In subjects with motor incomplete SCI, either anodal or cathodal tsDCS placed 
at the T10 -T11 level will result in a change in spi[INVESTIGATOR_348975]/M 
max ratio.  
Hypothesis 2: In subjects with motor incomplete SCI, either anodal or c athodal tsDCS placed 
at the T10 -T11 level will result in a change in spi[INVESTIGATOR_348976] (SSEP).  
 
4. DESCRIPTION OF  STUDY:  
Subjects will be screened in the outpatient SCI clinic. Each subject will receive fi ve tsDCS (2 
cathodal, 2 anodal and 1 sham) conditions at T10 -T11 spi[INVESTIGATOR_348977] a random order. There will 
be a wash -out period of 1 week between each tsDCS condition. Saline soaked sponge 
electrodes (36 cm2) will be used to deliver active tsDCS over skin  at specified level. Reference 
electrode will be placed over left shoulder. Active tsDCS (i.e., anodal or cathodal; not sham) will 
consist of stimulation at an intensity of 2.5 mA for the entirety of each stimulation session (i.e., 
2.5mA for 15 minutes to result in a current density of 0.071mA/cm2 and a total delivered charge 
of 0.064C/cm2). This current density was proven to be safe and sufficient to induce

IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-17-0166  
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 08/18/2017   physiological changes in previous human studies.17, 19, 35 .In a study done on healthy  subjects 
(Korupolu PI), current densities above this range resulted in skin blisters. For sham tsDCS, we 
will start at 0mA and ramp the intensity up, then down, over a [ADDRESS_433651] current stimulation.  
 
Pre-screening: During the pre -screening process, potential subjects with incomplete SCI will be 
contact[CONTACT_349010]. Korupolu (PI) or other co -investigators. Dr.Korupolu will 
give final approval fo r the subject to come to The Institute for Rehabilitation and Research 
Memorial Hermann for the screening procedure.  
 
Screening (Visit 1, duration: One hour): This visit will occur the same day as intervention 
visit. After subject arrives at TIRR a researc h personnel will meet him/her at the Motor Recovery 
Laboratory. The details of the study - specific procedures will be reviewed with the subject 
together. Subject will be screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Signed and dated 
informed consent will be obtained. Demographics, medical history, list of medications and 
modified ashworth scale score will be recorded. If the subject is female in child bearing ages, a 
urine pregnancy test results from primary care physician will be requested. A medication d iary 
will be given to the subject and asked to document all changes in type and dosage of the 
medication he/she has been using throughout the study. This will allow us to differentiate a 
potential effect of a change in dosage or type of medication on movem ent recovery. After 
subject meets all Inclusion an Exclusion Criteria the randomization will be done by [CONTACT_349011], opaque, consecutively numbered envelopes constructed by [CONTACT_349012].  
Each envelope will have intervention sequence informati on. Sequence will be generated by a 
random number generator. The research assistant will assign [ADDRESS_433652] session who will 
administer tsDCS. The research assis tant will not be involved in data analysis or measurement 
of outcomes.  
Intervention (duration: three hours): This visit is divided in to baseline, tsDCS stimulation and 
post tsDCS.

Baseline: The baseline assessment will be performed on the s ame visit as intervention and will 
be performed in the Motor Recovery Laboratory by [CONTACT_349013]’s group 
assignment.  
Vital Signs: Vital signs will be recorded at the beginning of each session.  
SSEPs: We will measure SSEPs to evaluate eff ects of tsDCS on ascending 
somatosensory pathways. A somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) is the electrical 
activity response measured at the skin’s surface along ascending sensory pathway 
following controlled peripheral nerve stimulation. For recording p osterior tibial nerve 
SSEPs, the nerve is stimulated at the ankle, with the cathode midway between the 
Achilles tendon and the medial malleolus and the anode [ADDRESS_433653] of a 0.1 –0.[ADDRESS_433654] pulse at 3 -5Hz. 
These pulses will be delivered by [CONTACT_349014]. The stimulation intensity would exceed the motor threshold for 
eliciting a muscle twitch.37We will use same Nihon Kohden clinica l EMG/NCV measuring 
system to measure SSEPs. Procedure will follow per clinical protocol.  
 
Hmax/Mmax ratio: Immediately before and after application of tsDCS we will measure 
Hmax/Mmax ratio obtained from soleus muscle by [CONTACT_349015]. The 
difference between pre and post Hmax/Mmax ratio will be measured. The H -reflex is a 
compound muscle action potential elicited by [CONTACT_6398] -threshold electrical stimulation of 
afferent fibers in the mixed nerve with subsequent monosynaptic excitation of alpha 
moton eurons. Changes in the excitability of the reflex pathway are estimated by 
[CONTACT_349016]. M wave is a compound muscle action potential 
produced by [CONTACT_349017] -maximal stimulation of motor axons. The H -reflex amplitude is 
highly var iable, the excitability of the motoneuron pool plays a substantial role in 
determining the amplitude of the H -reflex. Therefore, changes in the ratio of maximal H - 
reflex amplitude and maximal M -wave amplitude (Hmax/Mmax) provide a rough estimate 
of modula tion in spi[INVESTIGATOR_183862].18, 19, [ADDRESS_433655] advocated method of H -reflex 
normalization is eliciting the H -reflex at a percentage of the Mmax. This method entails 
finding the amplitude of the Mmax and then adjusting the stimulation intensity to produce 
an H -reflex with amplitude equal to some percentage of the Mmax amplitude.36

electrodes Each subject will receive five tsDCS conditions at T10 -T11 spi[INVESTIGATOR_348979] a wash - 
out period of 1 week between 2 cathodal, 2 anodal and 1 sham tsDCS in a random order. Saline 
soaked sponge electrodes (36 cm2) will be used to deliver active tsDCS over skin at specified 
level. Reference electrode will be placed over left sho ulder. Active tsDCS (i.e., anodal or 
cathodal; not sham) will consist of stimulation at an intensity of 2.5 mA for the entirety of each 
stimulation session (i.e., 2.5mA for 15 minutes to result in a current density of 0.071mA/cm2 and 
a total delivered char ge of 0.064C/cm2). This current density was proven to be safe and 
sufficient to induce physiological changes in previous human studies.17, 19, 35 In a study done on 
healthy subjects (Korupolu PI), current densities above this range resulted in skin blister s. For 
sham tsDCS, we will start at 0mA and ramp the intensity up, then down, over a [ADDRESS_433656] 
current stimulation. Figure 3 shows the study design.

7. DATA  ANALYSIS:  
Data analysis: Descriptive statistics will be calculated for all variables. Group analysis of 
intervention -related changes with fixed effects comparison of post -intervention versus baseline 
will be performed. We will use repeated measures analysis of covar iance to estimate the effect

IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-17-0166  
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 08/18/2017   of group on outcome measures. Stata 14 software will be used to perform analysis. PI [INVESTIGATOR_348982].  
A sample size of 15 subjects was determined based on the review of  current literature to 
determine the optimal polarity for future studies.17, 19, 22, 35 In these studies 10 -12 healthy subjects 
were evaluated who received one anodal tsDCS, one cathodal tsDCS and sham (total 3 
sessions) in cross over fashion. In our study , we plan to deliver [ADDRESS_433659] total 75 
sessions and 150 data points (pre and post tsDCS outcome assessment) for each outcome 
measure. This study will pro vide a strong neurophysiological data for the implementation of 
future clinical randomized controlled trial studies to evaluate the effects of tsDCS combined with 
rehabilitation therapy.  
8. POTENTIAL  RISKS/DISCOMFORTS:  
 
tsDCS: Transcutaneous Spi[INVESTIGATOR_348983] (tsDCS) is a noninvasive procedure 
in which a device sends a small Direct Current (DC) across the skin to modulate spi[INVESTIGATOR_348984]. 
The use of tsDCS in therapeutic protocols to date has not resulted in severe adverse effects. In 
addition o ur protocol of 2.5mA has been used by [CONTACT_349022]: Somatosensory evoked potential is recording electrical signals of sensation going from 
body to brain. Recording electrodes are attached to the scalp and arm. Th e stimulus will last 
about 2 minutes at a time and may cause some twitching and tingling sensation in the target 
area. However it is painless and carries no significant risk.  
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_348985]: Stimuli above the action threshold of peripheral nerves will be 
administered through skin. This might cause some discomfort that is anticipated to be mild and 
easily tolerated by [CONTACT_748]. Also skin irritation might occur due to electrode attachment to  
the skin.  
Assessment/Questionnaires: All assessments will be performed in a designated room inside 
Motor  Recovery  Laboratory.  None  of these  tests  are either  painful  or uncomfortable  to perform.  In 
order to prevent potential embarrassment during the testin g the test will be done individually and 
in private. If subjects feel uncomfortable in answering any of the questions they may stop the 
study at any  time.  
 
9. POTENTIAL  BENEFITS:  
As with any study focusing on basic research, the subjects will derive no direct  benefit. The 
results of these studies may benefit subsequent future subjects. We envision that in the near 
future the information obtained from the proposed research will provide a better understanding  
13 
IRB NUMBER: HSC -MS-17-0166  
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 08/18/2017   for treatment options of SCI population . 
 
10. RISK -BENEFIT  RATIO:  
The potential improvement of arm and hand movement outweighs the risk of non -invasive spi[INVESTIGATOR_348986], fatigue, pain and discomfort.  
 
11. CONSENT  PROCEDURES:  
Informed consent will be obtained from the subject at Motor Recovery Laboratory at The 
Institute for Rehabilitation and Research. After the patient is identified by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_348987]/she is interested in participating, info rmed, written consent 
will be obtained by a member of the research team.  
In addition a photography/videotapi[INVESTIGATOR_348988], if he/she 
agrees to be photographed / videotaped during the assessments or treatment sessions.  
12. CONFIDENTIALITY  PROCEDURE:  
All data will be coded with identification number, database will be in a password –protected 
computer and kept in a locked file cabinet.  
13. COSTS  
The subject will not be expected to pay any costs.  
14. PAYMENTS:  
Subject receive up to $[ADDRESS_433660] of transportation and parking if they 
attend all five of your scheduled sessions.

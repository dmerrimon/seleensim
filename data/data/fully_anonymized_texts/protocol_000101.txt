1. Protocol  Summary  
 
Full Title:  Giving  Information  Systematically  and Transparently  in Solid  Tumor  
Cancer  
Short  Title:  Oncolo -GIST  
Principal  Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_286449]  G. Prigerson,  PhD 
Study  Description: The study  will develop,  refine  and pi[INVESTIGATOR_728879] -GIST  clinician  
training  intervention.  The training  is aimed  at enhancing  the clinician’s  
communication  with  patients  by [CONTACT_728885].  
Sample  Size:  Phase  1 Interviews:  N=20  (N=10  clinicians,  N=10  bereaved  caregivers)  
 
Phase  2: N= 54 (N=50  patient  subjects, N=4 clinician  subjects)  
Enrollment:  This study  will enroll 74 subjects  and screen  up to 250 subjects.  
Study  Population:  Phase  1 Interviews:  Bereaved  Caregiver subjects  will be caregivers  of 
patients  who  died  in the past  year  with  a primary  diagnoses  of GI or 
lung  cancers.  Clinician  subjects will be either  oncologists,  palliative  care  
physicians,  nurses,  nurse  practitioners,  social workers  and psychologists  
who  care  for patients  with  metastatic  GI and lung  cancers.  
 
Phase  2: Patient  subjects  will be adults  (18+)  diagnosed with  lung,  head 
and neck,  or GI cancer,  with  a progression  of their  disease  after one line 
of therapy.  Clinician  subjects  will be Lung,  Head and Neck,  or GI 
oncologists.  All subjects’ primary  language  will be English and will have  
full mental  capacity.  
Enrollment  Period:  Phase  1 (Interviews):  12 months  
Phase  2: 19 Months  
Study  Design:  Phase  1 (Interviews):  Intervention manual  development  
Phase  2: Intervention phase  (two -group pi[INVESTIGATOR_728880]).  
Participants:  Participants  will be recruited  at Weill Cornell Medical College/  
New -York  Presby[CONTACT_380976][INVESTIGATOR_307],  at the Lung  and GI Cancer  centers.  
Study  Duration:  31 months  
Start  date: Jan 22, 2020 
End date: July 25, 2022  (end  enrollment);  January  25th, 2023  (end data  
analysis  and all other  activities)  
 
Participant  Duration:  Phase  1 Interviews:  2 hours  
 
Phase  2: 4 months  (with  patient  status  monitoring  up to 12 months)  
Primary  Objective:  To assess the effectiveness  of the Oncologist  intervention  by [CONTACT_728886]’s  degree  of prognostic  understanding  after  discussing  
Protocol  # 19-07020392  
Version  Date:  April  25th, 2022  
Page  # [ADDRESS_995397]  trained  
clinicians.  
 
 
 
Secondary  Objectives:  To examine  the effects  on patients  of having  better  prognostic  
understating,  including  its effect  on their  quality  of life, the type  of care  
they  choose  to receive  and whether  or not the care  they  received  was 
consistent  with  the patient’s  preferences  and values.  
Endpoints:  Outcome  will be a training  manual  for clinicians  that teaches  the 
Oncolo -GIST  methods  of communication.  The efficacy  of the 
intervention  will be determined  by [CONTACT_728887]’s  prognostic  
understanding  using  our validated  4-item  assessment.  The assessment  
will determine  if the patient  understood the scan  results  as well as the 
expected  outcomes  of treatments  offered.  Outcomes  will also include  
whether  a DNR  order  was completed  for the patient,  the patients  
quality  of life (McGill Quality  of Life measure)  , patient  performance  
status  (e.g.,  Eastern  Cooperative  Oncology  Group,  ECOG), as well as the 
type  care  received  (e.g.,  anticancer,  intensive,  palliative  care).

 1.1 Study  Objectives  
1.1.1 Objectives  
Objective  1: To develop  and refine  Oncolo -GIST , an intervention  aimed  at enhancing  clinicians’  
communication  with  patients  by [CONTACT_728888],  by [CONTACT_728889].  
 
Objective  2: To determine  feasibility  and acceptability  of Oncolo -GIST  in a cluster  trial in 50 
patients  with  advanced cancer  and 4 clinicians.  
 
Objective  3: To test the preliminary  efficacy  of Oncologist  on the 1) patients  prognostic  
understanding  2) Other  aspects  of patient  care  including type  of care,  quality  of life, and “value  
consistent”  care.  
 
1.1.2 Hypotheses  / Research  Questions  
 
Hypothesis  1: The Oncolo -GIST  intervention  will be demonstrated to be feasible  and acceptable  
to both clinicians  and patients.  
 
Hypothesis  2: The Oncolo -GIST  intervention  will be associated  with  advanced cancer  patients’  
understanding  of their  scan  results  and prognosis  (i.e.,  that they  likely  have  months,  not years,  
left to live).  
 
 
2. Background and Significance  
Informed  consent  requires  an individual  to have  a clear understanding  of the facts,  implications,  and 
consequences  of an action .[ADDRESS_995398] majority  of patients  in our NCI-funded Copi[INVESTIGATOR_728881]  (CwC)  R01s  proved  to 
be. Among CwC advanced cancer  patients  with  a median  survival of 5 months  from  our baseline  
assessment, we found only  5% accurately  understood that they  had incurable  cancer,  were  terminally  ill, 
were  at a late- or end- stage  of their  illness,  and likely  had months,  but not years,  left to live.[ADDRESS_995399]  sufficient  understanding  of their  
prognosis,  and expected  risks/benefits  of treatments  being  offered  to them,  for making  informed  
choices.  Prelim inary  evidence  from  CwC has shown  that patients  who  get the gist that death is near  are 
more  likely  to: a) engage  in advance  care  planning  (ACP)  5 6 b) receive  less burdensome,  intensive,  and 
unbeneficial  EoL care  (e.g.,  fewer  ICU stays,  inappropriate  palliative  chemotherapy) ,5 6 7 8 and c) more  
value -consistent  EoL care .6 Although we found that 71%  of these  patients  state that they  would want  
their  oncologist  to tell them  their  prognosis,  only  17.6%  stated  that their  oncologist  had discussed  their  
prognosis  (i.e.,  life-expectancy) with  them .[ADDRESS_995400]  discussions  of prognosis ,4 10 7 but that the manner  of communication  matters  for patients  
to “get the gist”  that death is near .10 
Protocol  # 19-07020392  
Version  Date:  April  25th, 2022  
Page  # [ADDRESS_995401]  a compelling  need  for interventions  that:  a) promote  oncologist  discussions  of 
prognosis  with  their  advanced cancer  patients,  b) prove  feasible  to implement  in clinic,  c) are acceptable  
to oncologists,  and d) improve  patients’  prognostic  understanding.  We believe  that the Oncolo -GIST  
approach  has enormous  potential  to address  each  of these  needs.  By [CONTACT_728890],  the Oncolo -GIST  approach  is expected  to uphold bioethical principles  by 
[CONTACT_728891]’  capacity  to engage  in truly  informed  medical decision -making  which,  based on prior 
findings,  is also expected  to result  in better  EoL outcomes  (e.g.,  less intensive,  more  palliative  and more  
value -consistent  EoL care).  [ADDRESS_995402]  
intervention,  determine  its acceptability  to oncologists,  and potential for improving advanced cancer  
patients’  prognostic  understanding.  In pursuing  these  goals,  this studyaims  to determine  the   
promise  of the Oncolo -GIST  approach  for affecting  the targeted  outcomes  and given  positive  results,  
to position  us for a larger RCT.  We, thus,  propose  to examine  key aspects  of intervention  
development,  to evaluate  the NIH’s  Stage  I activities  of the Stage  Model  of Behavioral Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  (e.g.,  
intervention  refinement,  adaptation,  and pi[INVESTIGATOR_599387] ),[ADDRESS_995403]’s  
preliminary  efficacy.  
Both  qualitative  and quantitative  methods  will be used  in Phase  1. During  the Phase  1 interviews  
(Aim  #1) we will obtain  feedback  from  relevant  stakeholders/key  informants  (bereaved  caregivers  
and clinicians)  on an early  draft  of the Oncolo -GIST  manual and proposed  approach  using  a version  of 
the Delphi  method 14 in which  we interview  bereaved  family  caregivers  of advanced cancer  
patients  (n=10)  and oncology  clinicians  who  care  for patients  with  advanced gastrointestinal (GI) and 
thoracic  (lung)  cancers  (n=10).  The participants  will have  the option  of completing a recorded  phone  
interview  or answering  identical questions  via a link to REDCap.  Participants  will also be asked  
demographic  and oncology  based  communication  questions  specific  to either  clinicians  or caregivers.  
 
In Phase  2, for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_728882]  (Aim  #3), we will recruit  adult  patients  (n=50)  with  
metastatic  GI, head and neck,  or lung  cancers  with  scan  results  that reveal progression  (worsened  
disease)  on an initial systemic  treatment;  that is, patients  whose  life-expectancy  can reliably  be 
estimated  to be months,  not years . 5 9 Medical oncologists  (n=4)  who  care  for these  patients  will also 
be consented for study  participation  and half (n=2)  will be randomized  to receive  the brief “Oncolo - 
GIST  communication”  training.  The Oncolo -GIST  training  will provide  instruction  in how  to introduce  
the topic  of prognosis,  describe  scan  results  as “worse,”  prognosis  as “likely  months,  not years,”  and 
expected  treatment  outcomes  (e.g.,  “not  expected  to be cured by [CONTACT_3148],”  and expected  impact  
on quality  of life – that is, whether  the anticancer treatment  is likely  to make  them  feel overall  
better  or worse).  We expect  12-13 patients  will be clustered  within  each  of the 4 oncologists.  
Hierarchical Linear Modeling  (HLM)  techniques  will be employed  to address  the non-independence  
of patient  assessments within  each  cluster.  Patients  (n=25)  will be seen  by [CONTACT_728892] -GIST  
trained  oncologist  or an oncologist  not trained  in the intervention;  that is, usual  care  (n=25).  
Patients  in both arms  will have  met the same  eligibility  criteria (i.e.,  have  similar prognoses).  
Thus,  we will get initial feedback  on the Oncolo -GIST  intervention  from  relevant  stakeholders  and 
key informants,  obtain  information  on the patient  and oncologist  experience  with  the intervention  
and evaluate  its feasibility  and acceptability.  Finally,  we will obtain preliminary  effect  size estimates  
Protocol  # 19-07020392  
Version  Date:  April  25th, 2022  
Page  # [ADDRESS_995404]  Version  2.0’s  effect  on our primary  outcome  – patient  prognostic  understanding  
– to inform  the planning  of a future  larger scale  efficacy  randomized  controlled  trial (RCT).  Patients  
will be assessed  by [CONTACT_728893] a scheduled meeting  with  their  
oncologist  to discuss  the scan  results.  This will provide  patients’  baseline  levels  of prognostic  
understanding  and enable  us to determine  how  the intervention  relates  to pre-post  scan  visit 
changes  in prognostic  understanding.  Although the first scheduled scan  after study  enrollment  may  
not reveal progressive  disease,  we have  been  assured  by [CONTACT_6283]. Epstein and Saxena  that only  
exceptional  cancer  patients  will not progress  within  [ADDRESS_995405] -scan  within  a week  of that progressive  scan  visit and after  
their  two next  scans, if applicable.  [see Human Subjects  section  for Study  Timeline  & Assessment  
Schedule  and details  of assessment  procedures].  Although not all patients  are expected  to die within  
the study  observation  period,  given a median  life expectancy  of ~4-[ADDRESS_995406]  
majority  will die during  the study  observation  period.  Thus,  for all patients  enrolled  in this study,  the 
medical care  that they  receive  can reasonably  be considered end- of-life care,  whether  they  die 
during  the study  observation  period  or not. 
Informed  consent  of participants  will occur  in-person or will be conducted remotely  by [CONTACT_728894] (transfer.weill.cornell.edu)  or via a 
REDCap  Informed  Consent  form  (see attached)  The REDCap  form  will be implemented  in the 
following  manner  to ensure  informed  consent:  a research  assistant  will send the form  to a 
participant  prior to a scheduled phone  call, go through the consent  with  the participant  over  the 
phone,  and answer  any questions.  The participant  will need  to type  the correct  name  [CONTACT_728910]:  a wrong  answer  will be counted as “not  consented.”  
REDCap  has been  automatically  set up with  the e-consent  framework  to auto -archive  consents  and 
email  a PDF copy  of the signed form  to the participant.  A research  assistant  will then call the 
participants  to go over  consent  and answer  any questions  they  may  have  prior to any assessments.  
Participants  will keep  one copy  of the consent  form  and send  one copy  back  by [CONTACT_728895]/data  collection.  
Phase  2 documents  will be submitted upon  completion of the Phase  1 Interviews  and the Phase  1 
Open Trial  respectively.  No participants  will be enrolled  without  IRB approval  of these  documents.  
 
3.2 Interviews,  Focus  Groups,  Surveys, and/or  Observations  
A. Administration  
 Timing  and Frequency  
Phase  1 Interviews:  Clinicians  and bereaved  caregivers  will complete  a one-time,  2 hour  
phone  study  session  or REDCap  survey  (including  embedded intervention  manual)  link. 
Phase  2: Patients  will be assessed  in the week  prior to their  scheduled scan,  within [ADDRESS_995407]  them,  to explore  intervention effects  on primary  and 
secondary  outcomes,  respectively.  Oncologists  will be assessed  in the week  following  
that same  clinic  visit to obtain  their  impressions  of the discussion  of prognosis  and the 
patient’s  prognostic  understanding.  All these  assessments will take 20-30 minutes.  
Trained  oncologists  will complete  a brief (5-minute)  post -training  quiz,  and all 
oncologists  will complete  a brief (5-minute)  survey  on Oncolo -GIST  at the end of the 
Protocol  # 19-07020392

person  or letter  (postal  and email)  recruitment.  Only  data  from  potential  participants  
will be stored  on secure  servers.  Patient  subjects  will also have  data  collected  via 
medical chart  abstraction  including diagnoses,  medications,  advanced directives,  and 
types  of care  received  (e.g.  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125]).  These  data  will be deleted  upon completion  of the 
study.

chart  abstraction.  Clinicians  (Phase  2) will answer  an initial demographic  survey  and 
surveys  including prognosis  questions,  patient  understanding,  and patient  medical 
status  for each  patient  participant.  Clinicians  trained  in Oncolo -GIST  will also 
complete  a short  post -training  quiz to assess their  understanding  of the Oncolo -GIST  
manual.  All clinicians  will complete  a brief study  completion  questionnaire  to assess 
the feasibility  and acceptability  of the Oncolo -GIST  method.

  Referral information  
Data collected/received  from  participants  will be reviewed  within  24-48 hours  and 
research  study  staff will be responsible  for addressing  elevated  psychological  
symptoms/suicidality  identified  on the assessments so that timely  and appropriate  
psychiatric  assessment  and care  can be provided.  If a participant  at acute  risk of 
self-harm  or harm  to others  cannot  be reached  by [CONTACT_728897]  3 hours  
(after at least  two phone  call attempts  and an email  requesting a call back),  the 
participant‘s  emergency  contact(s) will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].

 7.1 Data  Reporting  / Regulatory  Considerations  
7.2 Data  Collection  
The data  collection  plan  for this study  is to utilize  REDCap  to capture  all treatment,  toxicity,  efficacy,  
and adverse  event  data  for all enrolled  subjects.  
7.2.1 REDCap  
REDCap  (Research  Electronic  Data Capture)  is a free data  management  software  system  that is 
fully supported by [CONTACT_57421]- Cornell Medical Center CTSC.  It is a tool for the creation  of 
customized,  secure  data  management  systems  that include  Web -based data -entry  forms,  
reporting  tools,  and a full array  of security  features  including user  and group based privileges,  
authentication  using  institution  LDAP  system, with  a full audit  trail of data  manipulation  and 
export  procedures.  REDCap  is maintained  on CTSC -owned  servers  that are backed up nightly  
and support  encrypted (SSL-based)  connections.  Nationally,  the software  is developed,  
enhanced and supported through a multi -institutional consortium  led by [CONTACT_728903].  
 
7.[ADDRESS_995424]/Ethics  Committee  Approval  
As required  by [CONTACT_427],  the Investigator  will ensure  all legal aspects  are covered,  and 
approval of the appropriate  regulatory  bodies  obtained,  before  study  initiation.  
 
Before  initiation  of the study  at each  study  center,  the protocol,  the ICF, other  written  material 
given  to the patients,  and any other  relevant  study  documentation will be submitted to the 
appropriate  Ethics  Committee.  Written  approval  of the study  and all relevant  study  information  
must be obtained before the study  center  can be initiated  or the IP is released  to the  Investigator.  
Any necessary  extensions  or renewals  of IEC/IRB  approval must  be obtained for changes  to the 
study,  such  as amendments  to the protocol,  the ICF, or other  study  documentation.  The written  
approval of the IEC/IRB  together  with  the approved ICF must  be filed  in the study  files.  
 
The Investigator  will report  promptly  to the IEC/IRB  any new  information  that may  adversely  
affect  the safety  of the subjects or the conduct  of the study.  The Investigator  will submit  written  
summaries of the study  status to the IEC/IRB  as required.  On completion  of the study, the  IEC/IRB  
will be notified  that the study  has ended.  
 
All agreed  protocol  amendments  will be clearly  recorded  on a protocol  amendment  form  and will  
be signed and dated  by [CONTACT_728904].  All protocol  amendments  will 
be submitted to the relevant  institutional IEC/IRB  for approval before  implementation,  as 
required  by [CONTACT_56819].  The only  exception  will be when  the amendment  is necessary  to 
eliminate  an immediate  hazard  to the trial participants.  In this case,  the necessary  action  will be 
taken  first,  with  the relevant  protocol  amendment  following  shortly  thereafter.  
 
Once  protocol  amendments  or consent  form  modifications  are implemented  at the lead  site, Weill  
Cornell Medicine,  updated documents  will be provided to participating  sites.  Weill Cornell 
Medicine  must  approve  all consent  form  changes  prior  to local IRB submission.  
 
Relevant  study  documentation will be submitted to the regulatory  authorities  of the participating  
countries,  according  to local/national requirements, for review  and approval before  the beginning  
of the study.  On completion  of the study, the regulatory  authorities  will be notified  that the study  
has ended.

this is in doubt,  as well as any unexpected medical events that  occur  during  patients’ participation  
in the study.  Participants’  responses  to study  assessments will be monitored  for severe  
psychological  distress.  Patients’  participation  will be discontinued if they  experience  severe  
distress   attributable   to  the  study,   as  determined   by  [CONTACT_31497]-investigators   or  their   treating

treatment.  
 
Reporting to DSMC  
Due to the low clinical risk involved  in this  study,  we propose  reporting  to the Weill  Cornell DSMC  
on an annual  basis.  Annual  reports  will comprise:  recruitment  and retention  totals,  including  
voluntary  patient  withdrawals;  a summary  of progress  since  the previous  DSMC  report;  and 
accounts  of any and all adverse  events  (AEs).  For the purpose  of this study,  an AE is defined as a 
participant  experiencing  severe  psychological  distress, regardless  of attribution.  
 
8. Statistical  Considerations  
8.1 Sample  Size/Accrual  Rate  
Phase  1 Interview:  Sample  size will be 10 clinicians  and 10 bereaved  caregivers  recruited  over  6 
months.  
 
Phase  2: The pi[INVESTIGATOR_728883] 4medical oncologists  (2Oncolo -GIST  Version  2.0 trained;  
2usual  care)  and 50 patients  ([ADDRESS_995429],  25 will receive  usual  care)  within  an 18-month recruitment  period.  Based  on past 
recruitment  yields  in the GI and lung  cancer  clinics  at WCM  (e.g.,  recruitment  of 60 advanced GI 
cancer  patients  alone  in 18 months),  we are confident  that we can recruit  this number  of eligible  
patients  within  an 18- month  period.  Given  this is an oncologist  communication  intervention,  we 
expect  the patient  drop- out rate to be low.  Fifty  participants  will ensure  fairly  stable  estimates  of 
intervention  effects  and confidence  intervals  and indicate  if there  is a “signal”  that the intervention  
is helpful  for promoting prognostic  understanding.  Using  our validated  4-point  prognostic  
understanding  score4 as a continuous  outcome,  if Cohen’s  d is large  (0.8),  with  48 patients  and 4 
oncologists,  the power  will be > 80%.  If the effect  size is  medium  (0.5),  power  will drop  to 30%.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_995430]  trained  clinicians,  and 25 patients  will be recruited  to 
usual  care  clinicians  in Phase  2. 
 
8.3 Analysis  of Endpoints  
8.3.1  Analysis  of Primary  Endpoints  
Phase  1 Interviews:  We will obtain  feedback  on the current  version  of Oncolo -GIST  (Version  1.0).  
Morse’s  guidelines15 for rigorous  qualitative  research  (e.g.,  audit  trail,  saturation)  will be followed  
and Atlas.ti  software  used.  16 Themes  emerging will be quantified  (re: frequency,  
priority)  and considered to inform  revisions  to the Phase  [ADDRESS_995431]  intervention.  
 
 
Phase  2: We will generate  preliminary  effect  size estimates  to inform  the planning  of the larger,  
efficacy  randomized  controlled  trial (RCT).  Hierarchical Linear Modeling  (HLM)[ADDRESS_995432]  study  outcomes  (e.g.,  patient  health  literacy)  will be included in 
models  to increase  the precision  of effect  size estimates .[ADDRESS_995433]  Version  2.0’s  ability  to improve  patients’  prognostic  understanding  
for a future,  larger study.  Linear and logistic  regression  models  will estimate effects  of the 
Page  # 14 Protocol  # 19-07020392  
Version  Date:  April  25th, [ADDRESS_995434]  intervention  on secondary  and exploratory  outcomes.  
 
9. Adverse  Event  Reporting  Requirements  
Adverse  event  (AE) monitoring  and reporting  is a routine  part of clinical research.  Safety  is monitored  
by [CONTACT_728906],  as 
well as by [CONTACT_728907],  x-rays,  electrocardiographs,  etc. 
 
9.1 Adverse  Event  Definition  
An adverse  event  (also  referred  to as an adverse  experience)  can be any unfavorable  and 
unintended sign (e.g.,  an abnormal laboratory  finding),  symptom,  or disease  temporally  
associated  with  the use of a drug,  and does  not imply  any judgment  about  causality.  An adverse  
event  can arise  with  any use of the drug  (e.g.,  off-label use, use in combination  with  another  
drug)  and with  any route  of administration,  formulation,  or dose,  including  an overdose.  In the 
case  of this study,  which does  not administer any drugs,  the only  potential  AE is psychological  
distress.  Any case  of severe  psychological  distress, as indicated  by [CONTACT_728908] (see 
Section  6.1) or by a participant’s  self-report,  will be noted  in the AE log, reported  to the IRB, and 
included in the annual  DSMC  report.  AEs will be reported  regardless  of attribution,  which will 
be determined  by [CONTACT_22888]-investigators  according  to the schedule  below  (section  9.1.1).  
 
9.1.1 Adverse  Event  Characteristics and Related  Attributions  
CTCAE  term  (AE description)  and grade:  The descriptions  and grading  scales  found in 
the revised  NCI Common  Terminology  Criteria for Adverse  Events  (CTCAE)  version  4.0 
will be utilized  for AE reporting.  A copy  of the CTCAE  version  4.0 can be downloaded  
from  the CTEP  web  site (http://ctep.cancer.gov ). 
• Attribution  of the AE: 
- Definite  – The AE is clearly  related  to the study  treatment.  
- Probable  – The AE is likely related  to the study  treatment.  
- Possible  – The AE may  be related  to the study  treatment.  
- Unlikely  – The AE is doubtfully  related  to the study  treatment.  
- Unrelated  – The AE is clearly  NOT  related  to the study  treatment.

9.1.3 Reporting  of AE to WCM IRB 
All AEs occurring  on this study  will be reported  to the IRB according  to the IRB policy,  
which can be accessed  via the following  link:

Objectives & 
Endpoints: 
 Brachytherapy is administered in conjunction with external beam 
radiation therapy and concurrent chemotherapy in women with locally 
advanced cervical cancer and is an essential component of curative 
therapy for this disease.1 Contemporary high-dose rate (HDR) 
brachytherapy is commonly delivered in 4-[ADDRESS_784168] the rectum and bladder from the 
high-dose regions and to stabilize brachytherapy applicators ( Figure 
2). Traditional vaginal packing methods include vaginal gauze packing 
(VGP) and rectal retractors (also called posterior vaginal speculum 
blades or rectal blades). VGP has been the preferred packing method 
in most centers due to its availability and low cost, but it causes patient discomfort and lacks reproducibility since it is highly dependent upon 
physician placement.[ADDRESS_784169] due to device crowding from the vertical column of 
applicators and rectal retractor. Vaginal balloon packing (VBP) 
methods have been developed to provide a more comfortable and 
reproducible method of vaginal packing, but these are expensive.2-[ADDRESS_784170] for a treatment that already delivers relatively poor 
reimbursement compared to other radiation modalities.8 Current 
packing options are suboptimal for contemporary image-guided 
brachytherapy delivered on an outpatient basis under mild sedation.  
This study validates the clinical performance of a new hydrogel-based 
packing technique (BrachyGel Vaginal Hydrogel Packing System, 
(BrachyGel VHPS)) in patients with cervical cancer. This approach is 
expected to meet the needs of contemporary, image-guided 
brachytherapy at a low cost and with much less patient discomfort. 
Participants will receive brachytherapy according to standard 
guidelines but packing would alternate between standard and 
BrachyGel. Participants will assess discomfort/pain, and clinicians 
and physicists will assess imaging properties, completeness and 
overall experience.  
BrachyGel VHPS is considered by [CONTACT_594448] a non-significant risk 
(NSR) device and therefore this study does not require an 
Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) from the FDA.

CONFIDENTIAL  10 treatment with high dose-rate (HDR) intra-cavitary brachytherapy with tandem-based 
applicators. Contemporary HDR tandem-based brachytherapy is commonly delivered in 
4-[ADDRESS_784172] rectum and bladder from the high-dose regions and to stabilize brachytherapy 
applicators ( Figure 2). Traditional vaginal packing methods include vaginal gauze packing 
(VGP) and rectal retractors. These options, however, are suboptimal for contemporary 
image-guided brachytherapy delivered on an outpatient basis under mild sedation. 
Although VGP is the preferred packing method in most centers because of its availability 
and low cost, it causes patient discomfort in the modern era of outpatient, multi-fraction 
HDR brachytherapy courses and lacks reproducibility because it is highly dependent upon 
physician placement.[ADDRESS_784173] due to device crowding from the vertical column of applicators and rectal retractor. 
Vaginal balloon packing (VBP) methods have been developed to provide a more 
comfortable and reproducible method of vaginal packing.2-7 However, in the US 
commercially available VBP (Alatus, RadiaDyne, LLC, Houston, TX) costs approximately 
$400 per application, totaling $2,[ADDRESS_784174] for a treatment that already delivers 
relatively poor reimbursement compared to other radiation modalities.8  
Recently, a new hydrogel-based packing system has been developed: BrachyGel Vaginal 
Hydrogel Packing System. On the basis of the results from the pre-clinical testing, the 
BrachyGel Vaginal Hydrogel Packing System should improve comfort for patients and 
should be easier for physicians to utilize during brachytherapy. Additionally, it is expected 
to reduce variation in physician performance, better pack lateral and irregular regions of 
the vagina ( Figure 4), image clearly by [CONTACT_594449], minimize air pockets ( Figure 3), and 
provide a more affordable option compared to the commercial balloon product.

treatment for the majority of these women, approximately 8,000 women with cervical 
cancer and 42,000 women with uterine cancer. Based on the average number of 
procedures per patient (5 for cervical, 3 for uterine), we project over 150,000 individual 
brachytherapy procedures in the US alone. The polymer hydrogel solution (BrachyGel) 
provides a tailored solution that fits ideally within an image-based brachytherapy 
paradigm. The past two decades have seen an overall trend toward increasing 
implementation of image-based brachytherapy techniques with volume-based 
prescriptions and advanced treatment planning using CT and MRI11,12. This product is 
tailored for image-based brachytherapy, providing customized packing that is visualized 
well on CT and MRI.

 BrachyGel Vaginal Hydrogel Packing System  
The product consists of the hydrogel solution, delivery gun, and a reaction bag. After 
standard brachytherapy applicators are in place, one reaction bag is inserted into the 
anterior vagina and a second bag into the posterior vagina. The hydrogel reagent 
containers are then placed within the delivery gun and connected to the reaction bag tube. 
The hydrogel reagents mix within the reaction bag (including the tubing) and the hydrogel 

BrachyGel, RadOnc 003  Version Date:  11/16/[ADDRESS_784178]. 
With the BrachyGel VHPS, the thiol-Michael addition 
reaction leads to hydrogel formation and expansion in situ 
within the vaginal cavity, providing a ~[ADDRESS_784179] vaginal tissue  (chosen to approximate pressure 
from the Valsalva maneuver13) and conforming to a range of 
cavity shapes and dimensions  (Figure 5). The expansion to 
fill the vaginal cavity occurs with minimal air pockets, which 
is an improvement over the other available packing 
methods. The hydrogel surrounds the applicator and 
conforms to the vaginal cavity, allowing for a fixed-
geometry, reusable applicator to serve any size or shape 
cavity. The imaging characteristics ( Figure 2)  on CT and 
MRI are ideal for use as vaginal packing during pelvic 
brachytherapy, with a homogeneous appearance that helps 
discern packing from adjacent bladder and rectum. This is 
the first use of a hydrogel technology to provide customized 
filling of a body cavity during radiation therapy. Furthermore,

implant procedure. 
BrachyGel, RadOnc 003  Version Date:  11/16/2021  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  13 it meets a need for a customized packing that readily conforms to any anatomical variation. 
This improves upon the VBP method, which offers only a range of filling of a pre-set shape 
and volume. 
The delivery system design also contains innovative characteristics that are not available 
in current packing systems ( Figure 7). The BrachyGel system includes a vent tube for air 
to escape from the bag while the hydrogel forms. In addition, there is a tube available for 
the physician to inject saline prior to removing the hydrogel packing in cases where a 
softer hydrogel would help with extraction of the packing. These design characteristics 
optimize the imaging characteristics of the packing (by [CONTACT_594452]), allow fine-tuning 
by [CONTACT_099] (saline port), and maximize patient comfort. 
 Pre-Clinical Experience 
The BrachyGel Vaginal Hydrogel was formulated on the basis of the attributes of the thiol-
Michael addition reaction ( Figure 9), which is unprecedented as a method for customized 
vaginal packing. This approach is based upon its biocompatibility, limited production of 
heat, and favorable imaging and radiation 
attenuation properties of constituent 
materials. The thiol-Michael click reaction 
involves the base or nucleophile-
catalyzed addition of a thiolate into an 
electron-deficient alkene. The reaction 
was chosen due to the ability to produce 
a biocompatible gel that forms quickly 
and reliably. Among its many other uses, 
the thiol-Michael addition reaction finds 
significant application in hydrogel 
synthesis with precursors including 
poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based 
materials, polysaccharides, polypeptides, 
and synthetic materials. Common 
applications include drug-delivery, tissue 
engineering, and tissue repair. The 
development of this hydrogel packing 
strategy is described in a 2017 article in

CONFIDENTIAL  14 The suitability of a PEG-based hydrogel for the intended use as vaginal packing has been 
demonstrated. A mild base (NaHCO 3) rapi[INVESTIGATOR_491084] a hydrogel in vitro using this reaction. 
Characteristics included rapid hydrogel-formation in less than 2 minutes, a hydrogel 
modulus capable of displacing vaginal tissue (~10 kPa) with a lack of appreciable soluble 
species after the reaction, and the ability to absorb additional water after hydrogel 
formation. Measuring the effect of formulation variables such as PEGDA molecular weight, 
initial polymer concentration, and base concentration on the hydrogel-formation rate and 
modulus demonstrated hydrogel properties well suited for brachytherapy packing 
materials.  The water absorption of the hydrogel revealed its ability to absorb water in 
order to fine-tune tissue displacement. CT and MRI imaging studies displayed favorable 
radiation attenuation, demonstrating clear hydrogel distinguishability from native tissue 
and the metal applicator, vital for image-guided treatment planning ( Figure 8). Biological 
evaluation against human vaginal epi[INVESTIGATOR_594436]. 
Based on available public information, this constitutes the first use of a water-absorbing 
hydrogel designed as a packing solution for pelvic brachytherapy applications. 
 Relevant Clinical Experience 
The investigational product has been used in cadavers, but not in living humans. Data 
related to cadaver studies, biocompatibility and leakage studies may be found in the 
investigator’s brochure.  
 Risk/Benefit Assessment   
 Known Potential Risks  
Vaginal brachytherapy is associated with the following acute side effects according to the 
EMBRACE study (Image guided intensity modulated External beam radiochemotherapy 
and MRI based adaptive BRAchytherapy in locally advanced CErvical cancer).  
In a study of over 1000 patients receiving brachytherapy, urinary morbidity, in particular 
urinary frequency, urgency, incontinence and cystitis, was seen in up to 24.5% of patients 
at all grades following brachytherapy15. At grades 2-4, prevalence rates were significantly 
lower at up to 5.0%. Most grade 3 and 4 urinary morbidity was urinary frequency, 
incontinence, and ureteral strictures, with grade 3-4 fistula, bleeding, spasm, and cystitis 
much lower at <1.0% and actuarial 3-year incidence of all grade 3 and 4 urinary morbidity 
events was 5.3%15.  
In a study of 960 patients, rectal bleeding was seen in 20.1% of patients at grade 1, 6% 
at grade 2, 1.6% at grade 3, and 0.1% at grade 416. This effect was dose dependent, with 
patients receiving ≤ 65 Gy having only minor and less frequent adverse events (risk of 
fistula was 0-2.7%), while patients receiving ≥ 75 Gy had more major and frequent events 
(12.5% risk of fistula). Overall rectal morbidity ≥ grade 2 was 10% at 69.5 Gy.  
In a study of 1176 patients receiving brachytherapy for cervical cancer, grade 3-4 bowel 
morbidity frequency was 5% at grade 3 and 5.9% at grade 417. Stenosis/stricture/fistula 
frequency was 2% at grade 3 and 2.6% at grade 4. Less severe events (grade 1 and 2) 
were more common, with 28-33% experiencing short term diarrhea, flatulence, 
incontinence, difficulty in controlling bowels, constipation, and abdominal cramps.  
 
Vaginal morbidity with brachytherapy for cervical cancer occurred relatively frequently in 
the EMBRACE study. In a group of 630 patients, frequency of vaginal stenosis overall was 
BrachyGel, RadOnc 003  Version Date:  11/16/2021  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  15 21%, but the effect was dose-dependent with 20%, 27%, and 34% of patients experiencing 
grade ≥ 2 events following 65 Gy, 75 Gy, and 85 Gy, respectively18. 
Additionally, patients may experience localized pain during the procedure due to the 
packing material. It is hypothesized that this will be short term (will resolve within 1 day) 
and will be significantly decreased during/following treatments with BrachyGel packing. 
 Known Potential Benefits  
Participants may experience less pain and/or side effects of vaginal packing during and 
following fractions delivered with the BrachyGel Vaginal Hydrogel Packing System than 
fractions delivered with standard of care packing systems. There should be no difference 
in experience between arms, as both Arms A and B will undergo two fractions with the 
Brachygel system and two fractions with the standard of care system.  
 Assessment of Potential Risks and Benefits  
It is expected that brachytherapy fractions delivered with BrachyGel as the packing system 
will be at least as comfortable and as safe as standard of care. Similarly, the quality of 
image guidance during fractions delivered with BrachyGel as the packing system should 
be at least as good as with standard of care packing systems. If BrachyGel is determined 
to be non-inferior to standard of care options, BrachyGel may present a less expensive, 
more comfortable, and highly effective option for delivery of brachytherapy for cervical 
cancer. The risks of participation for individual participants should not be greater than with 
standard brachytherapy and this study may identify an additional effective, low-cost, 
comfortable packing system option for future cervical cancer patients requiring 
brachytherapy.

will continue with study follow-up. Participants that withdraw from study treatment and 
study follow-up will not be contact[CONTACT_594455]. 
 
 Procedures for Discontinuation of Study Intervention 
Discontinuation from brachytherapy according to the study does not mean discontinuation 
from the study, and remaining study procedures should be completed as indicated by [CONTACT_60658].  If a clinically significant finding is identified (including, but not limited to 
changes from baseline) after enrollment, the investigator or qualified designee will 
determine if any change in participant management is needed. Any new clinically relevant 
finding will be reported as an adverse event (AE). 
The data to be collected and procedures to be completed at the time of study intervention 
discontinuation are included in the schedule of assessments in section 13.1 .

9 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN  
 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
 Definition of Adverse Events (AE) 
For the purposes of this protocol, we define an adverse event to be any untoward medical 
occurrence associated (at least possibly related) with the use of the study intervention(s)  
 Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAE) 
An adverse event (AE) or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the 
view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
 death,  
 a life-threatening adverse event,  
 inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
 a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions, or  
 a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. A planned medical 
or surgical procedure is not, in itself, an SAE. 
 Classification of an Adverse Event 
[IP_ADDRESS] Severity of Event 
For adverse events (AEs) not included in CTCAE version 5.0, the following guidelines will 
be used to describe severity.  
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the 
participant’s daily activities.  
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the 
therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with 
functioning. 
BrachyGel, RadOnc 003  Version Date:  11/16/2021  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  23 • Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require 
systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially 
life-threatening or incapacitating.  Of note, the term “severe” does not necessarily 
equate to “serious”. 
 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Relationship to Study Intervention 
All adverse events (AEs) must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by 
[CONTACT_594456]/her clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using 
the categories below. Relationship of the adverse event to brachytherapy and packing 
system will be assessed separately. In a clinical trial, the study product must always be 
suspect.  
 Definitely Related – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and 
other possible contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including 
an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to study 
intervention administration and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_19009]. The response to withdrawal of the study intervention 
(dechallenge) should be clinically plausible. The event must be pharmacologically 
or phenomenologically definitive, with use of a satisfactory rechallenge procedure 
if necessary. 
 
 Probably Related – There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the 
influence of other factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal 
laboratory test result, occurs within a reasonable time after administration of the 
study intervention, is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs 
or chemicals, and follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal 
(dechallenge). Rechallenge information is not required to fulfill this definition. 
 
 Possibly Related – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., 
the event occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the trial 
medication). However, other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the 
participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant events). Although an AE may rate 
only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it can be flagged as requiring more 
information and later be upgraded to “probably related” or “definitely related”, as 
appropriate. 
 Unlikely to be related – A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test 
result, whose temporal relationship to study intervention administration makes a 
causal relationship improbable (e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable 
time after administration of the study intervention) and in which other drugs or 
chemicals or underlying disease provides plausible explanations (e.g., the 
participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments). 
 
 Not Related – The AE is completely independent of study intervention 
administration, and/or evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another 
BrachyGel, RadOnc 003  Version Date:  11/16/[ADDRESS_784190] be an alternative, definitive etiology documented by [CONTACT_984]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Expectedness 
The treating investigator will be responsible for determining whether an adverse event 
(AE) is expected or unexpected. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, 
severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously 
described for the study intervention and/or this population. Expected AEs are described in 
Table 2.

 Abnormal Laboratory Values 
Laboratory values will not be collected or assessed for this study. Abnormal laboratory 
values will not be recorded or reported in this study.  
 Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow-Up 
The occurrence of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) may come to 
the attention of study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study participant 
presenting for medical care, or upon review by a study monitor. 
 
All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be 
captured on the appropriate case report form (CRF). Information to be collected includes 
event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study 
product (assessed only by [CONTACT_8703] a diagnosis), and 
time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study must be 
documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate 
resolution. 
 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be 
considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s 
condition deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
BrachyGel, RadOnc 003  Version Date:  11/16/[ADDRESS_784191] all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after 
brachytherapy fraction 2 is completed until 30 days (for non-serious AEs) or anytime (for 
SAEs considered related to the study intervention) after the last day of study treatment.  
At each study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the 
last visit.  Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization. 
 Adverse Event Reporting 
AEs must be recorded into the EDC system designated by [CONTACT_594457], per the following guidelines.

 Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects 
 Definition of Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE) 
Unanticipated adverse device effect is any serious adverse effect on health or safety or 
any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with a device, if that effect, 
problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence 
in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application),

should not receive any further brachytherapy. While the study intervention (packing 
system type) should not affect pregnant women or the unborn child, pregnant women 
should not receive radiation in this area.  
 Unanticipated Problems 
 Definition of Unanticipated Problems (UP) 
The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) considers unanticipated problems 
(UPs)(may include a data breach) involving risks to participants or others to include, in 
general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria: 
 
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol-related documents, such as the 
Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved research protocol and informed 
consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the participant population being 
studied;

 Protocol Deviation 
 Definition of Protocol Deviation 
A protocol deviation is defined as any change, deviation, or departure from the study 
design or procedures of a research project that is NOT approved by [CONTACT_8236]’s IRB 
prior to its initiation or implementation, OR deviation from standard operating procedures, 
Good Clinical Practices (GCPs), federal, state or local regulations. Protocol violations may 
or may not be under the control of the study team or UVA staff. These protocol violations 
may be major or minor violations. 
 Protocol Exception 
Protocol exceptions are circumstances in which the investigator wishes to deviate from 
eligibility criteria or one or more of the specific procedures called for in a research plan. 
Unlike modifications that apply to all subsequent subjects in the research, a 
protocol/research plan exception only applies to a specific subject or group of subjects. 
Exceptions are planned, and the investigator gets approval from the lead site ahead of 
time. Such a request should be rare and justified in terms of serving the best interests of 
the potential study participant. The Lead site will receive permission from the DSMB for 
any exceptions at the Lead site.  
 Reporting of a Protocol Deviation or Exception

10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1 Design 
This is a two-center, stratified and randomized, four period, two arm crossover, non-
inferiority trial to demonstrate that BrachyGel Vaginal Hydrogel Packing System (hydrogel) 
is non- inferior to standard method vaginal packing (standard) in dose thresholds for D2cc 
(in Gy) for rectum and bladder by [CONTACT_726] a non-inferiority margin of δ=[ADDRESS_784200] fraction and 
then either sequence A (standard-hydrogel-standard-hydrogel) or sequence B (hydrogel-
standard-hydrogel-standard) chosen at random, for the remaining four fractions. It is 
possible for participants to require less therapy during the final fraction (ie maximum 
therapy has been applied to the tumor), thus, the choice of ordering is limited to these two 
orderings to ensure that both packing types are administered to each participant with the 
primary assessment based upon fraction 2 and 3 data (ie, a two period, two treatment 
crossover).

CONFIDENTIAL  31 
 Randomization and Stratification 
Participants will be stratified by [CONTACT_3725] (UVA, AHN). Randomization will occur with equal 
allocation to each ordering (Arm A or Arm B) using a stratified block randomization scheme 
with varying block sizes (of 2-4). Randomization will occur prior to the 2nd fraction of 
brachytherapy. 
 Evaluation of Sample Populations and Criteria  
 Study Population 
Safety: All randomized participants receiving at any protocol treatment will be evaluated 
for safety outcomes.  
Evaluable: All randomized eligible participants receiving at least 3 fractions of treatment 
will be evaluated for study outcomes. 
 Study Outcomes & Endpoints 
Study measurements will be captured post each fraction of treatment. Assessments may 
include: 
 Adverse events 
 Dosimetry 
 Physicist evaluation of imaging/packing 
 Physician evaluation of imaging/packing 
 Participant discomfort survey 
There are two primary endpoints based upon dosimetry measurements in the bladder 
and the rectum. Each endpoint is the difference between D2cc dosimetry measurements 
obtained during periods 1 and 2 (fractions 2 and 3 under the 2x2 crossover structure). 
Additional assessments include data from periods 3 and 4 (fractions 4 and 5).  
Additional endpoints include measurements over all periods for: 
 Bladder and rectal dosimetry as measured by D0.1 cc and D1 cc. 
 Participant reported discomfort  
 Physicist evaluated imaging properties  
 Physician evaluated imaging properties  
 Physician evaluated use experience  
 Sample Size and Accrual 
For this crossover study the primary comparison is based upon the 2x2 initial crossover 
portion. The primary endpoint is the difference of D2cc dosimetry measurements between 
periods 1 and 2 (fractions 2 and 3) for sequence arm A and sequence arm B based upon 
a two-sample comparison of the mean difference to the non-inferiority margin. Data from 
[ADDRESS_784201] packing resulted in a mean (standard deviation) of 0.12 (1.56) 
and 0.10 (0.92) D2cc for the difference for bladder and rectal dosimetry, respectively. The 
BrachyGel, RadOnc 003  Version Date:  11/16/2021  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  32 width of the 95% CI for the mean difference was 0.9 and 0.5 for bladder and rectal 
dosimetry, respectively. Based upon these measurements and clinical judgement, a non-
inferiority margin of δ=(0.12+1.56=1.68) was chosen for this study. 
Justification for the sample size is based upon obtaining sufficient accrual to test the 
primary hypothesis that use of the hydrogel vaginal packing is non-inferior to standard 
packing methods in 1) bladder and 2) rectal dosimetry by [CONTACT_726] a non-inferiority 
margin. Let diff A and diff B denote the differences between fractions. 
The primary hypothesis to be tested is H o: µdiffA - µdiffB ≥ δ versus H a: µdiffA - µdiffB < δ, where 
the non-inferiority margin, δ=1.68, each for bladder and rectal, with a one-sided 2.5% level 
t-test. A sample size of 20 evaluable cervical cancer participants per arm achieves 94% 
power to detect non-inferiority using a one-sided t-test when the margin of non-inferiority 
is 1.68, the true difference between the means and the reference (standard) value is 0.12, 
and the assume population standard deviation is 1.56. Power is 96% if one uses the 
estimates for rectal dosimetry. 
Adjusting for participants not satisfying the evaluable criteria ( section 10.3.1), it is 
estimated that approximately [ADDRESS_784202] 
and 4 physicists/dosimetrist to participate in completing the Physician and Physicist 
Assessments.  
 Safety Monitoring 
All study participants who receive treatment will be assessed for the occurrence of 
treatment related adverse events. Adverse events of potential concern related to the 
vaginal packing, are acute vaginal adverse events (aVAE) which: i) is determined to be at 
least possibly related to BrachyGel; ii) occurs within the first [ADDRESS_784203] 
Brachytherapy treatment utilizing BrachyGel (ie. Period 2 or 3 depending on the 
randomization arm); and iii) meets the criterion below: 
Has any of the following vaginal toxicities grade >=3 according to CTCAE:  
 Vaginal pain 
 Vaginal perforation 
 Vaginal hemorrhage 
 Vaginal inflammation 
 Vaginal infection 
 Dyspareunia 
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_594460]. Results reported in Romano et al 2017 on high-dose brachytherapy experience at 
UVA noted that 0/74 = 0% (upper limit of 95% CI of 4.9%) patients experienced grade ≥[ADDRESS_784204] 2% for late vaginal 
toxicity.21,[ADDRESS_784205] (SPRT)

CONFIDENTIAL  45 13.5 Protocol Amendment History 
Version Date: from 3/31/2021 to 11/16/2021 
Section(s)  Description of Change  
Title Page, Key Roles and Study 
Governance, ABBREVIATIONS,  
1.[ADDRESS_784219] information and changed UPMC to AHN. 
Rationale: UPMC has not/will not be participating as an additional site for the trial. The additional 
site has been changed to AHN. 
8.2 Participant reported 
outcomes Reworded to include the options for completing the participant 
surveys. Participants can either complete a paper survey of the 
questions or a team member can read the questions/answers 
and record the participant’s selections.  
Rationale: For flexibility, there is no impact in having participants answer the questions on paper 
independently.   
9.1.1 Definition of Adverse 
Events (AE) Redefined AEs to be any untoward medical occurrence 
associated (at least possibly related) with the use of the study 
intervention(s) Rational e:  The new definition streamlines the capture of AEs without underreporting. This 
definition captures pertinent standard clinical care and intervention related AEs of any category.  
9.1.7 Serious Adverse Event 
Reporting,  
9.2.2 Reporting of UADE, 9.5.2 
Unanticipated Problem Reporting,  
9.6.2 Reporting a Data Breach,  
9.7.3 Reporting of a Protocol 
Deviation or Exception Restructured the reporting guidelines to specify which entities 
perform which requirements based on site type. 
Rationale: For clarity on which requirements are performed by [CONTACT_594472].   
10.4 Sample Size and Accrual Changed the total maximum enrollment goal from 70 to 57 
Rationale: To better align with the study budget.   
13.1 Schedule of Activities 
(SoA) Updated calendar footnotes and increased timeframe for the 
collection of baseline physical exam, performance evaluation 
and conditions from within 3 days of Brachytherapy 1 to 
30days. 
Rationale:  For clarity and to align with SOC practice.  
13.[ADDRESS_784220]/Dosimetrist Case 
Report Form,  
13.3 Participant Packing 
Discomfort Assessment, 13.4 
Physician Case Report Form Updated formatting of Questionnaires and added Spanish 
translation to the participant discomfort survey. 
Rationale:  For functionality and to allow Spanish speaking participants the option to complete the 
survey questions on paper independently.  
 
Version Date: from 6/25/2020 to 3/31/2021 
Section(s)  Description of Change  
1.2 Schema 
5.8 Registration and 
Randomization Removed “after 1st fraction of brachytherapy” from the 
randomization time limit. The randomization timeframe  is “10 days 
prior to 2nd fraction” 

BrachyGel, RadOnc 003  Version Date:  11/16/2021  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  46 9.2 Randomization and 
stratification 
Rationale: For flexibility as there is no statistical reason to limit randomization to after the 
first brachytherapy.  
5.1 Inclusion Criteria 
5.2 Exclusion Criteria 
 Updated Inclusion criteria 2 and exclusion criteria 1 & 3 to clarify 
that radiation therapy that is a part of the patient’s current definitive 
treatment plan for the cancer of interest is acceptable 
Rationale: It is common for the study’s patient population to receive a combination of EBRT, 
brachytherapy and chemotherapy as definitive treatment. The intent is to not exclude individuals 
receiving other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_594444] a part of their current treatment plan for cervical cancer.  
Abbreviations 
5.1 Inclusion Criteria 
8.1.1 Physical Exam Changed KPS to KPS or ECOG 
Rationale: For flexibility based on standard practice 
5.5 Description of Study 
intervention Added a description of the Arm assignments and details about 
fraction 1. 
Rationale: To provide additional clarity on the assignments and to align this section with section 
4.[ADDRESS_784221] Storage and 
Stability Added “after manufacture” 
Rationale: For additional clarity on the expi[INVESTIGATOR_594445].  
5.8 Registration and 
Randomization Added statement “eligibility and registration can occur after 1st 
fraction but before 2nd fraction” 
Rationale: The first fraction is considered a “screening procedure” and the second is considered 
the start of treatment. Eligibility confirmation and registration do not need to occur before the first 
fraction.  
7.[ADDRESS_784222] and Physician 
reported outcomes 
9.3.2 Study Outcomes & 
Endpoints Added “both standard and BrachyGel” 
Reworded “period” to “fraction 2-5” 
Added statement about only dosimetry measurements data will be 
collected from Fraction 1 
Added statement that sedated patients will not be asked the patient 
survey questions 
Rationale: Patient and doctor/physicist surveys only need to be completed starting at fraction 2 
since fraction 2 is considered the start of treatment.  Fraction 1 is considered a part of “screening” 
and the dosimetry values collected will be used as baseline values per section 9.1. Since the 
participant reported outcomes are exploratory, sedated patients can still be enrolled as data for the 
primary endpoints can still be collected.   
8.1.4 Abnormal Laboratory 
Values 
8.1.5 Time Period & 
Frequency  for Event 
Assessment & Follow up Reworded to state that Abnormal laboratory values will not be 
considered AEs and will not be recorded or reported 
Rationale: Lab values are not being collected or assessed for the study. Lab values are typi[INVESTIGATOR_594446].    
10.1.2 Consent Procedures 
and Documentation Added verbal consenting information for doctors and physicists 
Rationale: Doctors and physicists who plan to complete the Physician and Physicist Assessment 
Surveys are considered participants. Verbal informed consent needs to be obtained  
11.2.1 Data Collection and 
Management 
Responsibilities Removed references to Oncore as the eCRF system 
Rationale: Oncore is no longer the primary system being used for IIT eCRFs 

BrachyGel, RadOnc 003  Version Date:  11/16/[ADDRESS_784223]. Showalter was shifted from Medical Monitor to Sub-Investigator 
Rationale: Consistency with his corrected role  
12.1 Schedule of Events Footnotes 4-6 were added and Footnote 3 updated to account for 
sedated patients 
Rationale: To align with the changes made throughout the document  
12.1 Schedule of Events Concomitant  medication review removed from Brachytherapy 1 
Rationale:  Patients are always sedated for Brachytherapy 1 therefore not pain control medications 
would be administered during the procedure.   
12.1 Schedule of Events Added a +/- 2 week window to the 30 day safety follow up 
Rationale: For flexibility and clarity to account for changes in patient scheduling.  
12.[ADDRESS_784224]/Dosimetrist 
CRF 
12.4 Physician CRF Reworded “circling” to “clearly selecting” in all of the survey 
questions 
Rationale: To allow electronic completion of CRFs  
Abbreviation Table 
5.8 Registration and 
Randomization 
8.1.6 AE Reporting 
10.1.3 Confidentially & 
Privacy Reworded “Oncore” references to “ designated EDC system” 
Rationale: Oncore is no longer the exclusive data entry system for the study.  
8.1.5 Time Period & 
Frequency  for Event 
Assessment & Follow up 
12.1 Schedule of Events Updated start of AE recording and reporting from time “informed 
consent  was obtained” to “after the completion of the brachytherapy 
fraction 2” 
Rationale: Brachytherapy [ADDRESS_784225]/physicist accrual goals.  
Rationale: Added for clarity  
5.1 Inclusion Criteria Removed  Inclusion criteria #4 “ ability to read and write English or 
Spanish”  
Rationale: Patient participants do not need to read or write for the study since the patient comfort 
survey is verbally presented to the patient. Any non-English speaking patient can enroll as long as 
the patient can be properly consented and there is an acceptable interpreter for the subject’s native 
language.   
9.7.2 Protocol Exceptions Added section and definition 
Rationale: Inadvertently omitted from previous versions. This section is applicable since this is a 
multisite study.  
 
 
 
Version Date: 25 June 2020 
Section(s)  Description of Change  

BrachyGel, RadOnc 003  Version Date:  11/16/[ADDRESS_784226]. Showalter was shifted from Medical Monitor to Sub-Investigator 
Rationale: [CONTACT_594481] needs to be able to participate as a sub-investigator in order to perform 
brachytherapy and cannot serve as both the medical monitor AND a co-investigator. 
1.1 Synopsis 
5.1 Inclusion Criteria Expanded the range of stages to include IB1 and IVB 
Rationale: While uncommon, patients with these stages of disease may receive brachytherapy as 
definitive treatment for cervical cancer and there is no reason to exclude them from participation 
6.5 Concomitant Therapy Changed “during the procedure” to “for the procedure” 
Rationale: In some cases pain medication for the procedure may be given prior to the procedure 
or just following, and this should also be captured. 
13.1 Schedule of Activities 
(SOA) “Medical History” was updated to “Baseline conditions/assessment” 
Rationale: A true history is not necessary, but an assessment of baseline conditions is required in 
order to assess adverse events

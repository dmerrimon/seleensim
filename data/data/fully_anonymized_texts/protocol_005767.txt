Study Design:  This is an open label phase II I randomized controlled trial to determine the safety of [ADDRESS_504859] conserving therapy (BCT), consisting of partial mastectomy, followed by [CONTACT_400599] , is a w idely accepted standard of care and the preferred  local 
treatment  approach for many women with breast cancer.  Women opting for breast 
conserving therapy have improved body image, quality of life, and sexual function1,2.  
 
Six randomized studies with long term follow up have established the equivalent overall 
survival of breast conserving therapy to mastectomy3-[ADDRESS_504860] cancer, Correa and 
colleagues20 demonstrated a likelihood of left anterior descending artery (LAD) stenosis 
in excess of what would be expected, providing  indirect evidence of radiation -mediated 
coronary artery disease. Darby [INVESTIGATOR_6254] -authors19 found that the risk of major coronary 
events (myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, or death from ischemic heart 
disease) was related to the mean heart dose and not the LAD, suggesting a microvascular 
etiology.  Radiation related c ardiovascular toxicity is likely multifactorial, and multiple 
dose-volume relationships are  likely  important  risk factors of subsequent c ardiac disease, 
including dose to the LAD, heart (mean heart dose and volumetric parameters such as 
V25) and left ventricle21.  Efforts to minimize cardiac exposure to radiotherapy, while 
studying the potential dose  relationships are of utmost importance, particularly in the 
 [ADDRESS_504861] cancer radiotherapy with protons is emerging, with hopes 
of being able to maintain or improve the locoregional control and cause -specific survival, 
with potential to reduce toxicity.  
 
Clinical experience with proton beam radiotherapy (PBT) in the treatment of breast 
cancer patients remains limited, though increased institutional experience s are reported, 
and a multi -center randomized study in node positive patients has been init iated (CITE 
PCORI) . A recent review examined published experience  with PBT for breast cancer28. 
This report highlights the limited published clinical experience with proton beam for 
breast cancer,  in particular demonstrating very little data for whole breast radiotherapy 
without regional nodal treatment.  The t wo such cited studies were retrospectively 
planned proton versus  plan comparisons, rather than clinical experience, yet each 
supported a dosimetric advantage to PBT for left sided breast cancer patients undergoing 
BCT, with a reduction in mean heart dose, coronary artery dose, and ipsilateral lung 
dose29,30.   
 
Clinical experience in the node positive setting is published.  MacDonald et  al [ADDRESS_504862] wall irradiation and 
eleven received radiotherapy to the supraclavicular, level 3, and internal mammary lymph 
 9  MC1635  
 
node chains. Nine pati ents had grade 2 skin toxicity and 3 patients had grad e 1 skin 
toxicity. There was no ≥ grade [ADDRESS_504863] grade 1 fatigue. There were no reported cases of 
pneumonitis. The average mean dose to the heart was 0.44 Gy and the average mean V20 
of the lung was 12. 7%.   Cuaron et al. recently reported the results of treatment of the 
largest cohort of patients treated with proton therapy for breast cancer.32 Four patients 
were treated after lumpectomy, 24 after mastectomy (including 14 patients with implant 
reconstruction and 1 patient with autologous reconstruc tion) and [ADDRESS_504864] wall recurrence. Grade 2 dermatitis 
occurred in 20 patients (71.4%), 8 of whom (28.6%) also experienced moist 
desquamation. Grad 2 esophagitis was observed in 8 patients (28. 6%). There was 1 grade 
3 reconstructive complication. The median mean heart dose was 0.88Gy and the median 
V20 of the ipsilateral lung was 16.5%. This early data suggests that post -mastectomy and 
post-lumpectomy proton therapy  is feasible and well tolerate d with reduced dose to the 
heart and lung , warranting further study.  
 
In addition to the clinical experience in the locally advanced setting, several institutions 
have examined PBT for partial breast radiotherapy.  One such initial report showed high 
rates of acute skin toxicity, pi[INVESTIGATOR_16576], and worse physician reported cosm esis 
33.  However, the planning techniques reported therein, including passive scatter and a 
single beam treated per day for many, pos sibly contributed to these outcomes.  A larger 
series from Loma Linda with 60 month follow  up and 100 patients reported good to 
excellent cosmetic outcome in >90% throughout  5 years of follow up34. No patient had 
acute grade 3 or higher skin toxicity.   Ispi[INVESTIGATOR_400588] 5 years were 
3%.  In addition to differences in dose and technique, once daily treatments were used.     
 
Much of the published PBT experience is with passively scattered protons.  A concern 
with this technique is the high entrance skin dose which may be associated with higher 
skin toxicity and adverse cosmesis.[ADDRESS_504865] fractionation, 
newer preclinical and clinical data support a shorter course of radiotherapy.  
 
For fraction sizes up to  approximately  8 Gy , The linear -quadratic formula model is the 
preferred method of predicting the relationship between fraction size and tissue response 
of varying radiotherapy regimens. Its origins stem from what has been described as a 
two-component survival curve for  mammalian cells represented by [CONTACT_400600] -
response curve for the log of cell survival.40 In it, the biologically effective dose (BED) of 
a given fractionation regimen is related to the α/β ratio in the following equation, where α 
represents the log e of the cells killed per gray and β is the log e of the cells killed per gray 
squared:  
 
BED = nd (1 + d/α/β)  
d = dose per fraction  
n = # of identical fractions  
 
The ratio of α/β is the dose at which the linear and quadratic components of cell killing 
are the same. In general, early -responding tissues such as skin desquamation have a high 
ratio whereas  late-responding tissues such as dermal contraction have a low ratio and are 
very sensitive to increases in fraction size.[ADDRESS_504866] s that the α/β rati o of breast cancer may be low and more in 
line with that  of late responding tissues  and therefore breast cancer patients may not 
benefit from prolonged fractionation regimens .42,[ADDRESS_504867] 
Radiotherapy (START) trials, two modern breast cancer randomized controlled trials 
examining various fractionation regimens that have recently been reported with [ADDRESS_504868] over 5 
weeks was compared with 41.6Gy or 39 Gy in 13 fractions over 5 weeks. There was no 
significant difference in local -regional relapse between the 41.6Gy and 50Gy regimens 
(6.3% vs 7 .4%, p=0.65) or the 39Gy and 50Gy regimens (8.8 vs 7.4%, p=0.41).[ADDRESS_504869] cancer to changes 
 11  MC1635  
 
in fraction size that was not confounded by [CONTACT_400601]. An α/β ratio for 
local -regional relapse of breast cancer was determined from a meta -analysis of START -A 
and the START pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251] (349 events, 3646 women) as 3.5 Gy (95% CI 1.2 -5.7).  The 
α/β ratio for normal tissue toxicity endpoints i ncluded 3.5Gy (95% CI 0.7 -6.4) for breast 
shrinkage, 4Gy (2.3 -5.6) for breast induration, 3.8Gy (1.8 -5.7) for telangiectasia, and 4.7 
Gy (2.4 -7.0) for breast edema, suggesting that normal tissue toxicity may not be reduced 
and may even be increased when br east cancer radiotherapy fract ionation regimens are 
prolonged with small daily fractions.  
 
Further evidence supporting hypofractionated regimens for breast cancer came from the  
START -B clinical trial , in which 50Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks was compared  with 
40Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks. There was no difference in local -regional relapse at 
10 years between 40Gy and 50Gy groups, (4.3% vs 5.5%, p=0.2) but breast shrinkage, 
telangiectasia, and breast edema were significantly less common with the shorte r 
fractionation regimen. These data are consistent with the results of the Canadian 
hypofractionation trial which compared 42.5Gy in [ADDRESS_504870] in the doses used in these studies, 
and may potentially be deleterious.24,44. Interestingly, if one applies an α/β ratio for both 
normal tissue toxicit y and tumor control of 3.[ADDRESS_504871] of an addition 3.33 Gy47.  Three year local recurrenc e free survival was 95.9%, and 
breast cosmesis was good or excellent in 94% of evaluable patients.  
 
In the FAST trial, 915 women aged ≥ [ADDRESS_504872] cancer 
after wide local excision were randomly assigned to receive 50 Gy in 25  fractions of 2.0 
Gy over 5 weeks versus 28.5 Gy or 30Gy in 5 fractions once weekly fractions of 5.7 Gy 
or 6.0 Gy. Three -year rates of physician -assessed moderate/marked adverse effects in the 
breast were 17.3% (13.3 -22.3%, p<0.001) for 30Gy and 11.1% (7.9 -15.6%, p=0.18) for 
28.5Gy compared with 9.5% (6.5 -13.7%) after 50Gy.[ADDRESS_504873] recur rences were noted.  
 
 
Rovea, et al reported outcomes with 5  fractions of 6 to 6.5 Gy delivered once weekly for 
291 elderly patients49. 5 year Local control was excellent at 98%.  Lat e skin fibrosis was 
Grade 2 in 4.2% and grade 3 in 1.4%. Breast edema was low, at 7%, 4.2%, and 1.4% for 
Grade 1, 2, and 3, respectively.  Good to excellent cosmetic outcome was reported in 
86.4%.   Similarly, favorable acute toxicity results were reported  among [ADDRESS_504874], despi[INVESTIGATOR_400589]50.    
 
Min reported a modern c ohort of patients treated according to an older French trial51.  82 
patients were treated to 23 Gy over 4 fractions, delivered on days 1 and 3 and 15 and 17.  
 12  MC1635  
 
Five year local control was 99%, with low rates of acute  toxicity.  63 of 74 (86%) 
reported good or excellent cosmesis at last follow up.  An included cost analysis 
supported substantial cost savings, compared with both standard fractionated and 
moderate hypofractionated schemes52.  
 
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_400590], there are no data available presently on the role of hypofractionation for breast 
cancer with scanning beam proton therapy .31 
 
The overlying hypothesis of this study is that the  low α/β of breast cancer can be 
exploited with carefully designed hypofractionated proton  therapy regimens to further 
optimize the therapeutic ratio, improve patient convenience, and reduce cost . The goal of 
this phase II I randomized controlled trial is t o determine whether the hypofractionated 
proton  regimens proposed are n on-inferior compared with standard fractionated proton 
radiotherapy and therefore worthy of further investigation.

rates of grade 3 toxicity were seen using either the 40 Gy over 3 weeks, or 26 Gy or 27 
Gy over one week.56  It is possible tha t the spot proton RBE may be different than 1.1 for 
hypo -fractionated treatments. Trials like the currently proposed would be critical to 
define differences in RBE with spot scanned hypofractionated radiation as well as the 
cancer and normal tissue alpha/b eta.

7.0 Protocol Treatment  
 
Doses throughout will be prescribed in Gy (RBE) / Gy or Gy . One Gy will be the equivalent of 
one Gy (RBE) / Gy  for proton therapy for the purposes of the descriptions below. Radiation 
therapy must begin within [ADDRESS_504887] chemotherapy . The dose, schedule, and 
timing (neoadjuvant vs adjuvant)  of chemotherapy and endocrine therapy  are at the discretion of  
the treating oncologists . Concurrent cytotoxic chemotherapy with radiotherapy is not allowe d. 
Use of anti -HER2 therapy during radiotherapy is permitted.  
 
The treatment  technique  (photon/x -ray vs. proton ) utilized will be at the physician’s discretion 
and will be based on technical considerations, availability at the radiation oncology facility, 
insurance coverage considerations, and patient preference. See section 7.4.

7.7 Target Volumes 
The definitions for the CTV and normal structures for this protocol will generally follow the 
RTOG (Radiation Therapy Oncologic Group)-endorsed consensus guidelines for delineation 
for breast cancer with 
exceptions described below. 
7.[ADDRESS_504896] target volumes (Arms 1 and 2) 
7.711  High tangents volume:  Alternatively, breast target volume can be 
defined by [CONTACT_400603]. All palpable breast tissue and all 
tissue encompassed by a standard tangent fields would be considered 
breast tissue.  A medial tangent would be placed at the costo-condral 
junction and a lateral tangent would be placed at the mid axillary line or 
more posterior as necessary to cover all breast tissue laterally. The caudal 
border would be [ADDRESS_504897] and in general it should not be closer than 1.5 cm from the inferior 
border of the humeral head and no more than 2 cm distal ly.  
7.712  Low tangents volume: would be defined in the same manner; with the 
exception that the superior border should be between 2-4 cm from the 
inferior border of the humeral head. 
7.713  Manual modifications:  alternatively, volumes can be defined using the 
RTOG breast atlas as above. However, for uniformity of the posterior 
margin the breast volume would include muscle tissue as needed to 
maintain a uniform distal edge. Please see breast CTV (section [IP_ADDRESS].2). 
7.714  Lumpectomy Cavity: Contour using the excision cavity volume, 
architectural distortion, lumpectomy scar, seroma and/or extent of 
surgical clips (clips and/or fiducials are strongly recommended). 
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Lumpectomy Cavity CTV :  Lumpectomy Cavity + 5mm 3 
D expansion. Limit the CTV 5 mm from skin.   
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_504898] CTV: the breast would be the same as the CTV high 
tangents or low tangents without further expansions. The 
lumpectomy CTV is also included. The breast CTV volume 
is limited 5mm from the skin.  The breast CTV posteriorly, 
would be limited 5mm from the lung excluding the chest 
wall. 
7.715  Photon therapy 
[IP_ADDRESS].1  PTV -eval (PTV evaluation): PTV evaluation would be used 
for photon patients. PTV eval would equal to the breast CTV 
as defined above. The breast CTV as defined above matches 
the definition of the RTOG 1005 “ This Breast PTV Eval is 
limited anteriorly to exclude the part outside the patient and 
the first 5 mm of tissue under the skin (in order to remove 
most of the buildup region for the DVH analysis) and 
posteriorly is limited no deeper to the anterior surface of the 
ribs (excludes boney thorax and lung). ”

7.82 Heart:  To be contoured on all cases. The contour should begin just inferior to the 
level in which the pulmonary trunk branches into the left and  right pulmonary 
arteries (PA) and should extend to its most inferior extent near the diaphragm. 
The esophagus, ascending and descending aorta and inferior vena cava should be 
excluded from the heart contour.  
 
7.83 Left anterior descending (LAD) interventricul ar branch : To be contoured on 
left sided cases . “Originates from the left coronary artery and runs in the 
interventricular groove between the right and left ventricles. If it is difficult to 
see, raising the level and lowering the window may help (e.g. lev el 50, window 
150)”.60  
 
7.84 Right coronary artery (RCA).  To be contoured on all right -sided cases . 
“Originates from the right side of the ascending aorta. Due to the native heart 
position in the chest, on axilla CT, it  appears to start inferior to the left coronary 
artery. It moves significantly with cardiac motion, so often the location can seem 
noncontiguous from axial CT slice to slice, as the position of the AV groove 
changes.”60 
 
7.85 Ipsilateral lung : To be contoured on all cases, auto -segmentation with manual 
verification is permitted  
 
7.86 Contralateral lung:  To be contoured on all cases, auto -segmentation with 
manual verification is permitted  
 
7.87 Total lung:  To be contoured on all cas es, auto -segmentation with manual 
verification is permitted

10.0 Adverse Event (AE) Reporting and Monitoring  
 
10.[ADDRESS_504905] (i.e. drug, device, biologic) in a patient or research subject.  
Serious Adverse Event  – Any grade 4 or 5 adverse event as defined by [CONTACT_400605] v4.0. 
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  Serious problems/events can be 
well defined and include in general:  
 Death 
 Life threatening adverse experience  where emergent lifesaving treatment is 
necessary.  
 
 
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845] ) - Any 
unanticipated problem or adverse event that meets the  following three criteria:  
Serious : Serious problems or events that results in significant harm, (which may be 
physical, psychological, financial, social, economic, or legal) or increased risk for the 
subject or others (including individuals who are not r esearch subjects). These include: (1) 
death; (2) life threatening adverse experience; (3) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] - inpatient, new, or 
prolonged; (4) disability/incapacity - persistent or significant; (5) birth defect/anomaly; (6) 
breach of confidentiality and (7)  other problems, events, or new information (i.e. 
publications, DSMB reports, interim findings, product labeling change) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_293129], safety, or welfare of the subjects 
or others, or substan tially compromise the research data, AND  
Unanticipated : (i.e. unexpected) problems or events are those that are not already 
described as potential risks in the protocol, consent document, not listed in the 
Investigator’s Brochure, or not part of an underly ing disease. A problem or event is 
"unanticipated" when it was unforeseeable at the time of its occurrence. A problem or 
event is "unanticipated" when it occurs at an increased frequency or at an increased 
severity than expected, AND  
Related : A problem or event is "related" if it is possibly related to the research procedures.  
 
Preexisting Condition - A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the 
study.  A preexisting condition should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, 
intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period. At screening, 
any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At 
the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities t hat meet the 
definition of an adverse event must also be recorded and documented as an adverse event.

16.0  Statistical Considerations and Methodology  
16.1  Overview:  This is an open label phase II I randomized controlled tr ial to determine the 
safety of [ADDRESS_504917] is whether the 
experimental arm results in an unacceptable increase in the 24 -month compli cation rate. 
If it does not, then the experimental arm will be recommended for further study. If the 24 -
month complication rate is found to be unacceptable, then the recommendation would be 
to do no further studies of the experimental arm . 
 
16.2 Primary an d Secondary Endpoints  
 
 28  MC1635  
 
16.21  Primary Endpoint:  The 24 -month complicat ion rate, defined as the percentage of 
women evaluable at 24 months who develop one or more of the following events:  
 
1) grade 3 or higher  late adverse event   OR 
 
2) deterioration of  cosmesis from excellent/good to fair/poor or from fair to 
poor at the 24 -month evaluation  (using the Harvard/NSABP/RTOG 
Cosmesis Scale )  
 
16.22 Secondary Endpoints:  
16.221  Acute and late adverse events including grade ≥[ADDRESS_504918]:  
 Acute adverse events : any adverse event, regardless of attribution, that 
occurs in the first [ADDRESS_504919]-RT. 
 Late adverse events (up to [ADDRESS_504920] RT): any adverse event that 
occur red after the first [ADDRESS_504921]-RT. 
 Ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence  (IBTR ): this is defined as  local 
recurrence  from trial registration as a first event  at [ADDRESS_504922] parenchyma a s the original tumor.   
 Regional recurrence:  invasive breast cancer in the axilla, regional lymph 
nodes, chest wall, and skin of the ipsilateral breast  at 5 years . 
 Distant recurrence:  metastatic cancer that has either been biopsy 
confirmed or clinically dia gnosed as recurrent invasive breast cancer  at 5 
years . 
 Invasive diseas e- free survival:  this is defined as the time from study 
registration until the occurrence of one of the events in a composite 
endpoint. This endpoint includes invasive IBTR, regional in vasive breast 
cancer recurrence, distant breast cancer recurrence, death due to any 
cause .  
 Disease - free survival:  this is defined as the time from study registration 
until the occurrence of one of the events in a composite endpoint. This 
endpoint include s any IBTR, regional invasive breast cancer recurrence, 
distant breast cancer recurrence, death due to any cause,  
 Cause specific survival:   is defined as the time from registration to death 
due to breast cancer . If the cause of death is unkonw or difficul t to 
stablish patients with a distant failure at the time of death would be 
censored as dying from breast cancer  
 Overall survival:  is defined as the time from registration to death due to 
any cause.  
 
 
16.3  Exploratory endpoints:   
 [ADDRESS_504923]:  
 Patient Reported Outcomes/Quality of life: Elements of the Patient -
Reported Outcome s Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (PRO -CTCAE)  will be used for patient self -reporting of 
toxicities. The Breast Cancer Treatment Outcomes Scale (BCTOS) will 
be used to measure patient reported functional status (pain, mobility ). 
Other measures of fatigue, pain, and arm function are listed in the 
appendix.  
 Patient self -reported cosmetic outcomes:  the patient self -reported 
outcome will be assessed using a modified Harvard Cosmesis Scale and 
the BCTOS at baseline, 2 years, and 5 years.   
 Panel assessed cosmetic outcome:  in addition to patient self -reported and 
physician reported outcomes, cosmesis will be assessed by a panel of 
breast cancer medical providers using digital photographs from baseline 
and at 2 years.  The Panel will be blinded to treatment allocation.  
 
16.4 Sample Size Determination  
This study requires 100 evaluable women for the primary endpoint ana lysis (50 evaluable 
patients per arm) . 
Ninety -two percent of expected patients completed a [ADDRESS_504924] had their 3 -year follow -up visit based on the date of 
random assignment and who did not ex perience recurrence, undergo mastectomy, or die. 
Therefore to be conservative we will  anticipate enrolling 10 (5 per arm)  additional 
patients to account  for ineligibility, cancellation, major treatment violations, or other 
reason s. The maximum projected en rollment is therefore [ADDRESS_504925]  radiotherapy after 
lumpectomy. At baseline, 84% of patients in the hypofraction ated arm were rated as 
having good or excellent cosmesis by [CONTACT_400607]. At 3 years, the 
percentage was 77%, or an absolute change of 7%.[ADDRESS_504926] to the lumpectomy cavity which has been associated with 
a slightly higher risk of fibrosis and adverse cosmesis.63,64 Therefore, the sample size 
proposed for arms 1 -2 is b ased on an assumed value of a  10% complication rate in the 
control arm.  The rate of grade 3 or higher  late toxicity in this population is expected to be 
≤1 %  (Whelan ASCO 2011) .  Since the local failure  rate and death rate at 2 -years in the 
[LOCATION_006] start B trial24 was less than 3% we assume that an additional 10% to account for 
patients lost to follow, failures, dea ths and others should be adequate  (Total enrollment of 
110 patients) .  
16.[ADDRESS_504927] one of the fol lowing events:  1) grade 3 or higher late adverse event  
OR 2) deterioration of cosmesis from excellent/good to fair/poor or from fair to poor 
(using the Harvard/NSABP/RTOG Cosmesis Scale )  
 
The proposed analysis would be to compute the difference in the 24 -month complication 
rate between the experimental arm and the control arm. A one -sided 90% confidence 
interval (with the upper  bound of the interval) was computed  by [CONTACT_7702] a 10% 
complication rate in the control arm a nd a 15% “non -inferiority margin” of the difference 
(i.e. the maximum the difference can be between the experimental arm and control arm , 
the largest difference we’re willing to accept ). The decision rule would be of the 
following:  
 Upper  bound of the one-sided confidence interval (CI) for the  difference 
(experimental arm 24 -month complication rate minus control arm 24 -month 
complication rate) lies above 15% then recommend that the experimental arm is 
not investigated further . The 24 -month complication rate of the experimental arm is 
unacceptab ly high.  
 Upper  bound of the one-sided confidence interval (CI) for the difference 
(experimental arm 24 -month complication rate minus control arm 24-month 
complication rate) is less than 15% then recommend that the experimental arm 
undergo further investiga tion. The 24 -month complication rate of the experimental 
arm is potentially acceptable.  
 
With 100 evaluable patients, this study has 80% power with a [ADDRESS_504928] a null hypothesis that the control arm complication rate is10% and experimen tal arm 
control rate is 25% versus an alternate hypothesis that the complication rate in both arms 
is 10%.  Sample size was computed using PASS v.15  software . 
 
Other considerations:  Adverse events, quality/duration of response, and patterns of 
treatment f ailure observed in this study, as well as scientific discoveries or changes in 
standard care will be taken into account in any decision to terminate the study.  
 
16.[ADDRESS_504929] become evaluable for the primary endpoint.  
 
16.61 Primary Analysis : The primary analysis will be to estimate the difference 
in the complication rate (adverse cosmesis  and grade 3+ toxicities) which 
is defined as the [ADDRESS_504930] that <3% of patients will 
not be found eligible based on failure or death.24 The complication rate 
will be estimated using a bino mial estimator in both experimental arm 
 31  MC1635  
 
and control arm, and a one -sided 90% confidence interval of the 
difference will be computed with normal approximation.  As mentioned 
above, the following decisions will be made based on the 90% CI:  
 The upper bound of the 1 -sided 90% CI of the difference lies below 
15%: The experimental arm regimen is acceptable.  
 The upper  bound of the 1-sided 90% CI of the difference lies above 
15%: The experimental arm regimen is unacceptable.  
 
16.62  Secondary  Analyses  
 
16.621  Acute a dverse events : All patients who were registered to the study and 
started treatment will be included in the acute adverse event analysis. An 
acute adverse event is an AE, regardless of attribution, that  occurs up to 
[ADDRESS_504931]-RT. The maximum grade for ea ch type of acute AE will be 
recorded for each patient. Data will be summarized as frequencies and 
relative frequencies  by [CONTACT_2939] . Additionally, the relationship of 
the adverse event(s) to the study treatment will be taken into 
consideration.  Rates w ill be compared between arms using chi -squared 
tests.  
   
16.622  Late adverse events : All patients who were registered to the study and 
started treatment will be included in the late adverse event analysis. A 
late adverse event is an AE, regardless of attri bution, that appears or 
persists after [ADDRESS_504932] -RT. The maximum 
grade for each type of late AE will be recorded for each patient. Data 
will be summarized as frequencies and relative frequencies  by [CONTACT_54012]. Additionally,  the relationship of the adverse event(s) to the study 
treatment will be taken into consideration.  Rates will be compared 
between arms using chi -squared tests.  
 
16.623  Locoregional control : The cumulative incidence of locoregional 
recurrence will be estima ted using a competing risks method (Gooley et 
al.) by [CONTACT_2939] . The competing risks will be distant breast cancer 
recurrence and death.  Comparison between arms will employ Fine -Gray 
regression.  
 
16.624  Invasive disease -free survival : i-DFS is defined  as the time from 
registration until the time of invasive disease recurrence (not includ ing 
DCIS) or death due to any cause. The i-DFS will be estimated with a 
Kaplan -Meier estimator and curve  by [CONTACT_2939] . Estimates will be 
given for specific time poi nts along with 95% CIs.  Comparison between 
arms will employ a log -rank test.  
 
16.62 5  Disease -free survival : DFS is defined as the time from registration until 
the time of disease recurrence or death due to any cause. The DFS will 
be estimated with a Kapla n-Meier estimator and curve by [CONTACT_2939]. 
Estimates will be given for specific time points along with 95% CIs. 
Comparison between arms will employ a log -rank test.  
 
16.626   Cause specific survival: The CSS will be estimated with a Kaplan -Meier 
estimato r and curve by [CONTACT_2939]. Estimates will be given for specific time 
 32  MC1635  
 
points along with 95% CIs. Comparison between arms will employ a log -rank 
test. 
16.627 Overall survival : The OS will be estimated with a Kaplan -Meier 
estimator and curve  by [CONTACT_3148] a rm. Estimates will be given for 
specific time points along with 95% CIs.  Comparison between arms will 
employ a log -rank test.  
 
 
16.631  Quality of life : The subscales of the BCTOS, elements from CTCAE -
PRO, and other patient reported measures such as fatigue , breast pain, 
breast shape, and arm related morbidity outlined in the appendix will be 
summarized as the mean ± SD and median (minimum value, maximum 
value). Mixed models will be used to estimate changes at fixed time 
points as well as compare outcomes be tween arms.  
 
16.632  Cosmesis : The values of the cosmesis instruments (patient self -reported 
and panel -assessed) will be summarized with the frequencies and 
confidence intervals of fair or poor cosmesis events at baseline, 2 year s, 
and 5 years by [CONTACT_2939].   Comparisons between arms will employ 
chi-squared tests.  
 
 
16.7            Data & Safety Monitoring  
 
16.71   The study chair(s) and the study statistician will review the study at least twice a 
year to identify accrual, adverse event, and any endpoint prob lems that might be 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. The Mayo Clinic Cancer Center (MCCC) Data Safety Monitoring 
Board (DSMB) is responsible for reviewing accrual and safety data for this trial 
at least twice a year, based on reports provided by [CONTACT_31959].    
 
16.72  Adverse Event Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]: The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_400596].  We note that the Adverse Event 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_31921] (1) the study re -opening to 
accrual or (2) a t any time during the conduct of the trial and in consideration of 
newly acquired information regarding the adverse event profile of the 
treatment(s) under investigation.  The study team may choose to suspend accrual 
because of unexpected adverse event pro files that have not crossed the specified 
rule below.  
 
Accrual will be temporarily suspended if at any time we observe events 
considered at least possibly related to study treatment (i.e. an adverse event with 
attribute specified as  “possible,” “probable, ” or “definite”) that satisfy one of the 
following:   
 If [ADDRESS_504933] 10 treated patients (per treatment arm ) 
experience a grade [ADDRESS_504934] -treatment .   
 After the first [ADDRESS_504935] been treated  (per treatment  arm) : if ≥ 20% 
of all patients experience a grade [ADDRESS_504936] -treatment . 
 
We note that we will revie w grade 4 and 5 adverse events deemed “unrelated” or 
“unlikely to be related”, to verify their attribution and to monitor the emergence 
of a previously unrecognized treatment -related adverse event.  
 
16.8  Results Reporting on ClinicalTrials.gov: At study a ctivation, this study will have  been 
registered within the “ClincialTrails.gov” website. The Primary and  Secondary Endpoints 
(i.e., “Outcome Measures”) along with other required  information for this study will be 
reported on ClinicalTrials.gov. For purpose s of timing of the Results Reporting, the 
initial estimated completion date for the  Primary Endpoint of this study is 48 months after 
the study opens to accrual. The  definition of “Primary Endpoint Completion Date” 
(PECD) for this study is at the  time the last patient registered has been observed for [ADDRESS_504937] based on racial groupin gs, the sample size is not 
increased in order to provide additional power for subset analyses.  
 
16.93   The geographical region served by [CONTACT_68281], has a population which 
includes approxi mately 5% minorities.  We expect about 5% of patients will be  
classified as minorities by [CONTACT_31961] 100% of patients will be women.

4.  Refer to test schedule in section 4.[ADDRESS_504940] of 
1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing 
the subject of the following:  
 What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in 
this study  
 Who will have access to that information and why  
 Who will use or disclose that information  
 The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of 
their PHI.  
(This information is contained within the Mayo IRB Informed Consent Template 
Section 14)  
In the event that a  subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the 
investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected 
prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For subjects that have revoked 
authorization to collect or use PH I, attempts should be made to obtain permission 
to collect at least vital status (long term survival status that the subject is alive) at 
the end of their scheduled study period.  
 
18.32 Source Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of c linical findings, observations, 
or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and 
evaluation of the trial.  Source data are contained in source documents.  
Examples of these original documents, and data records include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], 
clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or 
evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from

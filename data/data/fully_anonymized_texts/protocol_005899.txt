Background: 
 
Most patients who undergo colorectal or small bowel resection (about 350,000 patients/year in the 
[LOCATION_002]) will experience postoperative ileus, a temporary impairment of gastrointestinal function 
(8). POI is associated with increased morbidity, increased hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577] (LOS), and increased 
health care costs (13). In most patients, LOS is typi[INVESTIGATOR_801964] [ADDRESS_1106994] of $1.46 billion (8). Currently, 
there is no specific treatment for or prevention of POI (8,16). Alvimopan is an oral, peripherally acting 
selective mu-opi[INVESTIGATOR_801965], and was FDA approved in 2008 for short-term use to accelerate upper and lower 
gastrointestinal recovery in inpatients following segmental large or small bowel resection with primary 
anastomosis (8,14,15,16). Studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of Alvimopan in reducing time 
to return of bowel function, LOS and cost in abdominal surgery, however there have also been 
conflicting findings that have not observed these benefits in laparoscopic colorectal surgeries, have 
found no reduction in readmission rates or an increase in readmission rates, or have not found a 
reduction in cost (14,13,16,17,18). It is possible that the use of Alvimopan may be more effective in 
some populations than in others (i.e. low risk vs. high risk for POI, open vs. laparoscopic surgery) (13). 
The high cost of Alvimopan (currently $142.32/capsule) is of significant concern, and given 
prophylactically to all patients undergoing colorectal or small bowel resection may not be economically 
prudent as not all patients will develop POI or require treatment for POI (mild cases). This study aims to 
evaluate the cost effectiveness of Alvimopan as rescue therapy in patients undergoing colorectal or 
small bowel resection who develop POI, and its safety and effectiveness in reducing LOS and POI 
duration. 
 
Hypothesis: 
 
We hypothesize that the use of alvimopan as rescue therapy in patients undergoing colorectal and small 
bowel resection surgery who develop POI can shorten their duration of POI and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577]. 
 
Objectives: 
 
To perform a prospective RCT to evaluate the effect of alvimopan as rescue therapy compared to 
standard of care in reducing the duration of post-operative ileus and post-operative LOS after colorectal 
and small bowel resection surgery. 
 
Protocol: 
 
This will be a prospective randomized control trial with a total of 58 patients, 29 in each group. Patients 
who undergo laparoscopic or open colorectal resection, small bowel resection, or ileostomy reversal 
with small bowel resection that subsequently develop postoperative ileus will be eligible for enrollment. 
If they meet inclusion/exclusion criteria, they will be randomized at the time of diagnosis of 
postoperative ileus to receive Alvimopan as rescue therapy or to receive conservative standard care. 
 
At the time of diagnosis of postoperative ileus and after enrollment and randomization, all patients will 
be returned to NPO status. Nasogastric tubes (NGT) may be placed for gastric decompression at the 
discretion of the surgical team if clinically indicated. In the event that an NGT is placed, medications will 
be given orally or via the NGT, which will be clamped for [ADDRESS_1106995] ERAS pathways with the exception of reduction of diet. Antiemetics will be given 
as clinically indicated; however, no prokinetic or promotility agents will be given as scheduled dosages. 
 
Patients randomized to the study group will be given a maximum of 3 doses of Alvimopan 12mg orally, 
12 hours apart. Alvimopan will be given from the time of diagnosis of postoperative ileus to the time of 
return of bowel function or the maximum 3 doses.  Subsequent Alvimopan doses will be given if there is 
no return of bowel function or if symptoms of distension and/or nausea persist despi[INVESTIGATOR_801966].   
 
All patients will follow a standard ERAS pathway after surgery, with early feeding and ambulation, along 
with opi[INVESTIGATOR_801967]. 
 
The patient and surgical team will be able to know which arm of the study the patient is in based on 
documentation in the medical record of the administration of Alvimopan. 
 
Standard discharge criteria will be applied to all patients, including: Passage of stool, Ability to tolerate 
solid food and to drink comfortably, Adequate oral analgesia, Patient's willingness to be discharged. 
 
Study Design: 
 
This will be a prospective randomized control trial. Patients who undergo laparoscopic or open 
colorectal resection, small bowel resection, or ileostomy reversal with small bowel resection that 
subsequently develop postoperative ileus will be eligible for enrollment. 
 
If they meet inclusion/exclusion criteria, they will be randomized at the time of diagnosis of 
postoperative ileus to receive Alvimopan as rescue therapy or to receive conservative standard care. 
 
Alvimopan will be prescribed as 1 dose PO with clampi[INVESTIGATOR_801968] 30 minutes. A 
subsequent dose (up to a maximum of 3 doses) may be repeated 12 hours later if there has been no 
recovery of GI function. 
 
Outcome:  The primary outcome measure will be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_801969] (date 
of diagnosis until actual discharge). The secondary outcome measures will be: time to return of bowel 
function (date and time ileus identified to date and time of passing flatus, stool and tolerating diet), 
complications (serious adverse events and adverse events of interest 30 days postoperatively),  number 
of re-operations (any reoperations within 30 days of surgery), number of readmissions (any 
readmissions within 30 days of surgery)

Statistical Analysis  
 
Planned Data Analysis:  
 
Descriptive statistics will be computed for all variables including mean ± standard deviation or median 
[25th, 75th percentiles] for continuous factors and frequency (percent) for categorical variables. 
Univariate analyses will be conducted to compare the distribution of pre-op characteristics across 
treatment groups using t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum tests for continuous variables and Chi-square or 
Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables. 
 
The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_801972], and the day 
of POI diagnosis and day of return of bowel function.   T-test will be used to assess differences in the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_801973].  Multivariable linear regression will be conducted to adjust for baseline measurements as well as 
potential confounding variables such as gender, obesity, and operative time.  Backwards variable 
selection will be used with a removal criteria of alpha > 0.1.  When required, data will be transformed in 
order to meet normality assumptions.   
 
For purposes of statistical analysis, a subset analysis may be done based on history of POI, type of 
operation, BMI, patients’ gender, or other clinically significant co-factors. All data will be analyzed with 
the use of SAS (version 9.4, The SAS Institute, Cary, NC), SPSS statistical software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL), 
or R version 3.6.1 ( www.R-project.org ). A p-value <0.05 will be considered statistically significant.  
 
Sample Size Calculations: 
 
We conducted the sample size calculation using estimates of length of stay after the diagnosis of POI .  
We are assuming equal-sized treatment groups and alpha = 0.05. 
 
We assumed that the average length of stay after the diagnosis of POI in no alvimopan group would be 
4.25 days, and alvimopan group 2.75 days.  Assuming a log-normal distribution, and co-efficient of 
variation of 0.6 based on prior data, there will be 80% power to detect decreases of a least 35% in 
length of stay after the diagnosis of POI in the Alvimopan group relative to the control group with 27 
patients in each group, a total of 54 patients.  Accounting for a dropout rate of about 5%, our 
enrollment goal will be 58 patients (29 per group).   
  
 
Reporting of Results  
 
Aggregate and anonymous, in text and table format, for publication in a medical journal. 
 
Consent  
 
A study coordinator will obtain informed consent from participating patients prior to Alvimopan 
administration.  The coordinator will have HIPPA training, certification in human subject protection, and 
will be familiar with the research protocol. The study coordinator will explain to each participant the 
purpose of the study as well as give the patient the opportunity to opt out of participation. Consents will 
be kept in a room accessible only to qualified research personnel working in the CORS department. 
Consents will be obtained prior to alvimopan administration. Patients will be offered participation in the 
study in a private clinic room. Patients will be offered to participate in the study post-operatively at the 
time of their post operative ileus diagnosis. Alvimopan is not part of the standard of care. It will be 
administered free of charge without extra financial charges to the enrolled patients.

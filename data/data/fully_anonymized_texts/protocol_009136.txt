Objectives  The primary objectives are as follows:  
The study will be condu cted in two phases. The first phase will enroll 
40 patients. At the end of it, we will determine adherence to CR. We 
will then proceed to the second phase which will enroll an additional 
50 patients, for a total study sample size of 90 , and at its end we w ill 
assess toxicity, as well as potential predictors of it . 
Phase 1:  Investigate the feasibility of a clinical trial administering ionizing 
radiation with concurrent CR for the treatment of breast cancer. True 
adherence will be defined as a successful redu ction of 25% of total calories 
based on diet journals in at least 80% of the logged events.  
Phase 2: Acute skin toxicity as defined by [CONTACT_853748] (NCI CTCv.[ADDRESS_1188334] de squamation ) will be followed to ensure 
noninferiority as compared with historical controls.  
The secondary objectives are as follows:  
Investigate measurable changes of patient characteristics and tissue and 
serum from fasting/CR  conditions to determine a me tric for evaluating this 
treatment in future studies.  
 Weight:  Weight will be monitored by [CONTACT_43658], at baseline, week 
1, 3, 5 and 7, conclusion and 4 weeks after diet is complete.  Body fat 
measurements via calipers and bioimpedance which will be don e at 
baseline, conclusion and 4 weeks after diet is completed.   Vital signs will 
be monitored weekly.  
 Serum:   
 At initiation of diet, conclusion of diet and 4 weeks after diet is 
complete, fasting labs will be drawn:  
 Clinical Lab: CBC, basic metabolic panel , hemoglobin A1C, 
triglycerides, insulin, IGF -1, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), 
adiponectin, leptin and estradiol  
 Other Serum Markers:   IGF-1R, IRS -1, proteomic  and/or genomic 
analysis  
 At week 5: a fasting insulin level will be evaluated.  
 Psycho -social evaluation : Patients will have psycho -social evaluation 
using the  FACT -B test and the PROMIS cancer fatigue short form at 
baseline, week 5, conclusion and 4 weeks after conclusion.  
 Outcomes:  Local recurrence, progression free survival, distant 
metastas es and overall survival will be assessed through patient records 
after study has been completed.  
 Toxicity:  acute skin reaction or pain using the National Cancer Institute 
Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI CTC) version 4.[ADDRESS_1188335] also been treated for a 6  – 6.5

of patients with toxicity, along with a 95% exact confidence interval. Our 
institution’s historical toxicity rate among similar patients is about 80% and we 
aim to prove that the dietary intervention is non -inferior with an absol ute 
margin of 10%, using an exact binomial test. With a total sample size of 90 
and assuming that true toxicity will be 80% or lower, we have 82% power 
(with one -sided alpha of 0.05).

 INTRODUCTION 1
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted 
according to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 
312 and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable government 
regulations and Institutional research policies and procedures.  
 Specific Aims and Hypothesis 1.1
We hypothesize that a dietary change such as fasting may alter tumor biology. Further 
we hypothesize that a 25% reduction in caloric intake is a feasible intervention for 
early stage breast cancer patients to adhere to during radiation therapy. 
To this end, in this feasibility trial we will (1) investigate the feasibility of a clinical trial 
administering ionizing radiation with concurrent CR for the treatment of breast cancer 
(2) Acute skin toxicity as defined by [CONTACT_684244] (NCI CTCv.[ADDRESS_1188338] 
desquamation) will be followed to ensure noninferiority as compared with historical 
controls. (3) investigate measurable changes of patient characteristics along with 
serum markers from CR to determine a metric for evaluating this treatment in future 
studies.  
The use of caloric restriction as a novel intervention has the potential to change the 
biology of tumors and enhance the clinical benefit of standard cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. If this 
trial is successful and it is determined that patients can achieve successful caloric 
restriction during breast cancer treatment, the long term goal will be to open a larger 
study to determine if this treatment is more efficacious than using radiation alone. 
 Background and Rationale 1.2
CR, or a diet modification aiming to reduce the total intake of calories by 20-30%, has 
been shown to increase longevity across multiple species.  Recently, there has been 
growing interest in the potential role of CR as a treatment modality for age-related 
diseases such as cancer because an increasing body of literature has demonstrated 
that there is a metabolic component to both carcinogenesis and tumor progression. In 
fact, many of the molecular pathways that are induced by [CONTACT_240316], such as IGF1-R, Akt 
and mTOR pathways, are also known to be perturbed in cancer and are currently 
targ
ets of novel cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Therefore, alteration of multiple steps in these 
pathways by [CONTACT_853749]. 
CR has been shown to decrease the incidence and progression of spontaneous 
breast cancers in murine models, and to protect normal tissue during chemotherapy.  
Our preliminary results show that CR represses tumor growth in an additive manner 
when combined with radiation in 2 different aggressive murine models (4T1 and 
67NR) of breast cancer (Fig 1).  Our results at the molecular level demonstrate that 
various components of the IGF-1R pathway are downregulated with CR and RT used 
separately, and are further decreased by [CONTACT_853750], suggesting a 
role for CR in the observed repression of tumor growth (Fig 2).    
   
 
12G.616 Protocol v4.2 (04Jan2016)  10 
Figure 1: Tumor re-growth-delay curves for tumors created from 4T1 breast cancer cell 
line: Ten mice were treated with either: ad libitum (AL) diet, radiation (RT), a 30% reduction in 
their calories (CR), or CR + RT. Compared to the AL cohort, for 4T1 tumors at 1000mm3 RT 
produced a 23% growth delay, CR 56%, and CR+RT 82%.  
 
 
Figure 2. Expression of members of the IGF-1R pathway.  RT-PCR was performed for 
molecules in the IGF-1R pathway(IGF-1R, IRS, PIk3ca, and mTOR).  For all of these 
molecules, CR, radiation, and the combination of both treatments resulted in downregulation 
which implicates this pathway in mediating the tumor regression noted.   
 
Although the preclinical data appears promising, it is unknown if patients will want to 
or be able to adhere to a reduction in calories during radiation therapy.  In the 
radiation clinic, many patients inquire about potentially beneficial dietary alterations. 
Although CR requires a significant commitment, we have shown through a TJUH IRB 
approved questionnaire that 75% of breast cancer patients queried at our institution 
would be interested in enrolling on such a diet related intervention trial (manuscript 
under review).  Because CR may act as a complementary therapeutic modality in the 
treatment of women with breast cancer, its full capacity as a therapeutic intervention 
needs to be assessed.   
It seems logical to propose that combining CR with genotoxic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_853721], in the treatment of breast cancer, could both retard tumor progression as 
well as confer significant therapeutic advantage by [CONTACT_853751] 

   
 
12G.616 Protocol v4.2 (04Jan2016)  [ADDRESS_1188339] 
beneficial for women to use in a larger randomized trial based on the results obtained 
here.  
Specific Aim 1: In a clinical trial, will investigate the ability of CR to modulate 
the effects of radiation in the treatment of early breast cancer. Aim 1a. Adherence 
will be assessed and is defined for each patient as achieving 25% reduction of her 
normal caloric intake (weekly average of diet journals), during at least 80% of the days 
during the intervention. Aim 1b. Acute skin toxicity as defined by [CONTACT_853748] (NCI CTCv.[ADDRESS_1188340] desquamation) will be followed to ensure noninferiority as 
compared with historical controls. Specific Aim 2: Investigate measurable changes 
of patient characteristics along with serum markers fr om CR to determine a 
metric for evaluating this treatment in future studies.  Patient characteristics such 
as weight, vital signs, body fat measurements, psychosocial evaluation and outcomes 
will be monitored. Additionally, members of the IGF- 1R-AKT pathway, and glucose 
and insulin in the serum, will be assessed to create a molecular signature [CONTACT_853767].   
The innovative use of caloric restriction as a novel therapeutic option has the potential 
to change the biology of tumors and enhance the clinical benefit of current treatments 
for breast cancer. If patients are noted to be compliant, we will be able to open a 
larger study to determine if the combination of radiation and caloric restriction is more 
efficacious than radiation alone. 
 Study Therapy 1.3
Baseline caloric intake will be assessed by [CONTACT_853752] 7-10 days prior to radiation 
treatment planning. Recommendations by [CONTACT_853753] 25% and the patient will begin this diet immediately 
after the planning session and for [ADDRESS_1188341] generated a reproducible mouse model to 
assess various modalities of treatment. Specifically, we tested the syngeneic and

Figure 4: Tumor re-growth-delay curves for tumors created from 4T1 breast 
cancer cell line. Ten mice were treated with either: ad libitum (AL) diet, radiation 
(RT), a 30% reduction in their calories (CR), or CR + RT. Compared to the AL cohort, 
for 4T1 tumors at 1000mm3 RT produced a 23% growth delay, CR 56%, and CR+RT 
82%.  
 
CR alters the IGF-1R survival-signaling pathway 
To determine if altering the IGF-1R pro-survival pathway might be responsible for the 
additive tumor regression noted between CR and irradiation, q RT-PCR was performed 
on grossly dissected 4T1 tumors from the previous experiment using primers for IGF-
1R, IRS, PIk3ca, and mTOR. 
Figure 5: Expression of members of the IGF-1R pathway.   RT-PCR was performed 
for molecules in the IGF-1R pathway(IGF-1R, IRS, PIk3ca, and mTOR).  For all of 
these molecules, CR, radiation, and the combination of both treatments resulted in 
downregulation which implicates this pathway in mediating the tumor regression 
noted.   
 
These results (Fig. 5) demonstrated that multiple molecules in the IGF-1R/AKT 
pathway are downregulated with CR alone or in combination with radiation.  Since the 

   
 
12G.616 Protocol v4.2 (04Jan2016)  14 
IGF-1R/AKT is involved in apoptosis and based on these results we propose that this 
work warrants further investigation of this pathway is warranted in order to determine 
whether pathway components contribute to the beneficial effects of CR in breast 
cancer. 
 Clinical Data to Date 1.[ADDRESS_1188342] been no published trials assessing radiation therapy with a diet 
modification to date, there are now a number of registered trials 
(www.clinicaltrials.gov ) assessing a ketogenic diet with cancer therapy for lung 
cancer, pancreatic cancer, primary brain tumors and metastatic cancer. 
There are published trials in the non-oncologic realm however; showing that caloric 
restriction is feasible and patients are able to be compliant in other diseases or in 
healthy volunteers. For example, the Comprehensive Assessment of Long-term 
Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy (CALERIE) is a multi-center randomized 
controlled trial that placed patients on a 25% caloric reduction for [ADDRESS_1188343] in Arizona, where patients were 
kept on a CR diet of1,780 kcal/day for [ADDRESS_1188344] in a CR Clinical Trial: Many patients express an interest in dietary 
changes they can make to improve their cancer survival but the data supporting such 
interventions is scarce.  To begin to develop a protocol for using CR to treat patients, 
we set out to assess the feasibility of using CR in a clinical setting. Specifically, we 
distributed an IRB-approved questionnaire to our oncology patients querying patient 
interest in participating in a CR study. We found that 75% would participate in a CR 
trial. The patients identified several tools they believed would help them with dietary 
trial adherence including speaking with a dietician weekly and weekly phone 
conversations with the physician.  This demonstrates that there is patient interest in 
dietary interventions and that a trial using CR could successfully accrue patients. We 
have since worked with the Integrative Medicine Department to develop a strategy to 
implement a CR diet and to monitor and ensure adherence.  
 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits 1.6
The patients will undergo a 25% reduction in total caloric intake since this is a) the 
reduction used in other clinical trials that employ caloric restriction and, b) the 
definition of caloric restriction and the percent reduction noted to effect molecular 
targets in the IGF pathway. 
The patients will undergo CR for a total of [ADDRESS_1188345] 5 weeks for stabilization of physiologic processes 
   
 
12G.616 Protocol v4.2 (04Jan2016)  15 
under caloric restriction [1].  
The diet modification proposed should not induce many risks, and every effort will be 
made to insure that patients are receiving adequate overall nutrition.  Although some 
patients may experience weight loss and fatigue, other risks should be minimal. These 
risks may include: decreased bone mineral density, decreased muscle mass and 
strength, depression, decreased sex drive, fatigue, irritability, fainting, rashes, 
acidosis, malnutrition, constipation, dehydration, cholelithiasis and reversible 
amenorrhea.  
Because obesity has been proven a poor prognostic factor in those patients with 
breast cancer, dietary intervention may be ideal for improving outcomes for these 
patients who decrease their caloric intake. 
 STUDY OBJECTIV ES [ADDRESS_1188346] cancer. True adherence will be defined as a 
successful reduction of 25% of total calories based on diet journals in at least 80% of 
the logged events. 
Aim 1b. Acute skin toxicity as defined by [CONTACT_853754] (NCI CTCv.[ADDRESS_1188347] 
desquamation) will be followed to ensure noninferiority as compared with historical 
controls.

 Primary Study Endpoints 3.2
Objective:  Investigate the feasibility of a clinical trial administering ionizing radiation 
with concurrent CR for the treatment of breast cancer. True adherence will be defined 
as a successful reduction of 25% of total calories based on diet journals in at least 
80% of the logged events. Acute skin toxicity as defined by [CONTACT_853748] (NCI CTCv.[ADDRESS_1188349] desquamation) will be followed to ensure noninferiority as 
compared with historical controls. 
To obtain baseline caloric intake, patients will keep food diaries for 7 to 10 days. On 
the basis of these diaries, a caloric intake will be computed for each day. Each 
patient's baseline (pre-diet) caloric intake will then be the average caloric intake in this 
pre-diet phase. The target caloric intake during the diet phase will be set to 75% of 
this baseline average (25% restriction). 

   
 
12G.616 Protocol v4.2 (04Jan2016)  [ADDRESS_1188350] 80% of all logged events meeting the diet restriction target. 
 Secondary Study Endpoints 3.3
Investigate measurable changes of patient characteristics and tissue and serum from 
fasting/CR conditions to determine a metric for evaluating this treatment in future 
studies. 
 Weight: Weight will be monitored as a percent change and by [CONTACT_853755], at baseline, week 1, 3, 5 and 7, 
conclusion and 4 weeks after diet is complete.  
 Body Fat Measurement: Body fat percentage will be done at baseline, conclusion and [ADDRESS_1188351] and base of fold. A 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_853723] 1 to 2 seconds before reading the 
caliper. Duplicate measurements will be taken at each site, allowing time for skin to 
regain normal texture and thickness. Measurements will be taken at the: 
 Biceps: Measured on a vertical fold at the upper arms frontside, half way between 
shoulder and elbow. 
 Triceps: Measured on a vertical fold at mid of the upper arms backside. 
 Scapula: Measured on a diagonal fold on the back, at the lower edge of the scapula. 
Angle of inclination should be 45°, clockwise. 
 Hip: Measured on a diagonal fold straight over the pelvis, close to the navel. Angle of 
inclination should be 30°, clockwise. 
 Bioimpedance: Bioimpedance will be taken at baseline, conclusion and 4 weeks after 
diet is completed and will be measured in Ω/m2. 
 Vitals: Vital signs including temperature, blood pressure, heart rate and respi[INVESTIGATOR_853724]. 
 Serum (collection procedures detailed in Appendix VI ): 
 At initiation of diet, conclusion of diet and 4 weeks after diet is complete, fasting labs 
will be drawn: 
 Clinical Lab: CBC, basic metabolic panel, hemoglobin A1C, triglycerides, insulin, 
IGF-1, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), adiponectin, leptin and estradiol 
 Other Serum Markers:   IGF-1R, IRS-1, genomic and/or proteomic analysis 
 At week 5: a fasting insulin level will be evaluated. 
   
 
12G.616 Protocol v4.2 (04Jan2016)  19 
 Psycho-social evaluation:   Patients will have psycho-social evaluation using the FACT-
B test and the PROMIS cancer fatigue short form at baseline, week 5, conclusion and 4 
weeks after conclusion. (Forms detailed in CRFs in Appendix VII) 
 Outcomes: Local recurrence, progression free survival, distant metastases and overall 
survival will be assessed through patient records after study has been completed. 
 Toxicity: acute skin reaction or pain using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity 
Criteria (NCI CTC) version 4.0 scale22 will be assessed. Number of patients 
experiencing toxicity and time to occurrence of toxicity will be recorded (see Appendix III 
for toxicity scale). This toxicity will be compared to historical controls from TJUH who 
have also been treated for a 6-6.5 week course of radiation.

 Study Drug /Therapy  5
 Description 5.1
Baseline caloric intake will be assessed by [CONTACT_853752] 7 to 10 days prior to 
radiation treatment planning. Recommendations by [CONTACT_853756] 25% and the patient will begin this diet immediately 
after the planning session and for a minimum of 2 weeks before starting radiation. The 
patient will then remain on this calorically restricted diet as measured by [CONTACT_853757] a minimum of 2 weeks after the 
completion of the radiation course. This is done to ensure that he patients undergo 
caloric restriction for a minimum of 10 weeks +/-1-2 weeks. 
Restriction of calories is the primary objective of dietary modification and will be 
tailored to each patient by [CONTACT_853758]. Diet guidelines and compliance will be reviewed 
at weekly on-treatment visits by [CONTACT_853759]. 
 Treatment Regimen 5.2
 Prior to Radiation: 5.2.1
Caloric restriction to 75% of normal calorie intake will begin when patients present 
for radiation treatment planning. Prior to this, patients will have recorded their daily 
intake in food journals for 2 weeks. Patients will remain on this calorically restricted 
diet until completion of radiation treatment for a total of 10 weeks.  
Restriction of calories is the primary objective of dietary modification; however, to 
patients will be encouraged to maintain adequate nutrient intake. Diet guidelines 
and adherence will be enforced at weekly on-treatment visits by [CONTACT_853760]. 
 Risks of Caloric Restriction 5.3

 Study Visit Schedule 6.2
 Screening 6.2.1
Eligibility of patients will be verified based on clinical staging and any need for 
adjuvant chemotherapy as well as previously stated eligibility criteria. Those 
eligible patients will receive detailed information about the study including a step-
by-step outline of proposed treatment including radiation therapy and diet 
modification. Patients will be informed of possible risks and benefits. Informed 
consent will be obtained from patients. A full history and physical examination will 
be performed on consented patients. Baseline weight and BMI will be taken. In 
addition, blood will be drawn for eligibility measurements of beta-hCG if 
appropriate .  
 Phase I—Pre-treatment 6.2.2
Visit 1:  Patients will report to the Radiation Oncology Department for radiation 
treatment planning to include CT simulation. Food diaries from the previous 7- 10 
days will be collected and analyzed to create a diet plan for each patient. 
Integrative medicine will meet with patients to counsel them on lifestyle changes 
and behavioral aspects of dietary modification. Dietary counselors will give patients 
guidelines for dietary modification including the appropriate amount of calories that 
each patient should be receiving and what kinds of foods they should avoid or eat 
more of. Nutritional counseling will be done using behavioral cues to encourage 
adherence (see Appendix V for worksheets). Patients will be instructed to begin 
their new diet starting at this visit and to continue logging foods into their journals. 
They will complete the journal daily. Patients will undergo a focused examination to 
assess initial breast appearance and texture for comparison as patients receive 
radiation therapy. Fasting blood will be drawn for baseline laboratories at this visit. 
Clinical measurements will include CBC w/diff, CMP, HbA1c, IGF-1, adiponectin, 
leptin, estradiol, triglycerides, insulin, ESR. Separately, blood samples will also be 
   
 
12G.616 Protocol v4.2 (04Jan2016)  26 
analyzed for the following: IGF-1R, IRS-[ADDRESS_1188364]-B form as well as a baseline fatigue assessment using the 
PROMIS cancer fatigue short form (see appendix XI). Weight, height, vital signs, 
bioimpedance and caliper measurements will be done. 
Phone Intervention:  Patients will be contact[CONTACT_853761] a week during the 
time they are keepi[INVESTIGATOR_853730]. 
Visit 2:  Week 1 or day 7 (±2 day) of diet. Weight will be measured and vital signs 
will be taken. Food diary from previous week to be collected, as well as 24hr recall 
of diet. 
Visit 3:  Week 2 of diet. Weight will be measured and vital signs will be taken. Food 
diary from previous week to be collected, as well as 24hr recall of diet. 
 Phase II—Visits During Radiation Treatment 6.2.3
Visit 4-9:  Patients will be monitored for acute radiation toxicity including skin 
changes and desquamation. Patients will be questioned and examined to ensure 
general health and will be reassured about radiation-related side effects. Patients 
will turn in their food diary from the previous week and dietary counselors will 
review these with the patients to determine how they can continue to comply with 
dietary modification. At each visit, a 24hr recall of diet will be asked of the patient 
and compared with the diet journal to determine the self reporting accuracy. Each 
week during this period, patients will be counseled on their diet and given 
behavioral modification lessons corresponding to specific weeks in the diet (see 
Appendix V for worksheets). Weight will be taken at weeks 3, [ADDRESS_1188365]-B psychosocial assessment will be given at visit 7along with the 
PROMIS cancer fatigue short form. In addition, at visit 7 (week 5 of diet) patients 
will have a fasting blood draw done for insulin level.  
Radiation will be planned to be administered 5 days a week, Monday through 
Friday. Radiation is given for approximately 6-6.5 weeks or 30- 33 treatments. 
 Phase III—Post Radiation Treatment 6.2.4
Visit 10:  Week 9 of diet,for scheduling purposes. Weight and vital signs will be 
measured. Patients will be monitored for acute radiation toxicity including skin 
changes and desquamation. Patients will turn in their food diary from the previous 
week and dietary counselors will review these with the patients to determine how 
they can continue to comply with dietary modification. A 24hr recall of diet will be 
asked of the patient and compared with the diet journal to determine the self-
reporting accuracy. Patients will be counseled on behavioral modification for the 
final week of their diet (see Appendix V for worksheet). Weight and vital signs will 
be measured.

Advanced Technology Consortium (ATC) and the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI) http://atc.wustl.edu/home/NCI/NCI_IMRT_Guidelines.html 
 Megavoltage photon beams with energies ≥6 MV and megavoltage electron [IP_ADDRESS]
beams are required. 
 Localization, Simulation, and Immobilization 6.4.3
 Simulation and treatment may be performed with the patient in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_283958] [IP_ADDRESS]
prone position. 
 Patients should be optimally positioned with immobilization devices at the [IP_ADDRESS]
discretion of the treating physician such as alpha cradle casts, breast 
boards, wing boards. 
 Methods to minimize the cardiac exposure to RT like heart block, gating or [IP_ADDRESS]
breathhold are allowed at the discretion of the treating physician 
 For large-breasted patients, including those with a large inframammary skin [IP_ADDRESS]
fold, devices to improve positioning of the breast are permissible. 
 A treatment planning CT scan in the treatment position will be required to [IP_ADDRESS]
define the tumor bed for boost. 
 The CT required for generation of a virtual plan with 3DCRT or [IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1188370] be placed on external landmarks at the [IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1188371] data-set. These markers should identify: 1) The lumpectomy 
incision 2) Additional markers to define the clinical borders of 
tangent fields (e.g. based on the palpable breast tissue and boney 
landmarks). 
 The CT should extend cephalad to start at or above the mandible [IP_ADDRESS].3
and extend sufficiently caudally (or inferiorly) to the inframammary 
fold to encompass the entire lung volume. A CT scan image 
thickness of ≤0.5 cm should be employed. 
 External skin localizing marks, which may include permanent [IP_ADDRESS].4
tattoos, are recommended for radiation daily localization and set- up 
accuracy. 
 Treatment Planning/Target Volumes 6.4.4
 Planning isodose lines will be chosen by [CONTACT_35425].  [IP_ADDRESS]
 Target Volumes and Normal Structures [IP_ADDRESS]
 Lumpectom y CTV: Contour using all available clinical and radiographic [IP_ADDRESS]
information including the excision cavity volume, architectural distortion, 
lumpectomy scar, seroma and/or extent of surgical clips (clips are strongly 
recommended). Patients without a clearly identifiable lumpectomy bed do 
not need a boost. Lumpectomy CTV volume will be expanded by 1.5 to 2cm 
at the physicians discretion and the expanded volume (Lumpectomy PTV) 
will be treated. 
 Ipsilateral lung. This may be contoured with auto-segmentation with manual [IP_ADDRESS]
   
 
12G.616 Protocol v4.2 (04Jan2016)  30 
verification. 
 Contralateral lung. This may be contoured with auto-segmentation with [IP_ADDRESS]
manual verification 
 Heart : The heart should be contoured beginning just inferior to the level in [IP_ADDRESS]
which the pulmonary trunk branches into the left and right pulmonary arteries 
(PA). Above the PA, none of the hearts 4 chambers are present. All the 
mediastinal tissue below this level should be contoured, including the great 
vessels (ascending and descending aorta, inferior vena cava). The heart 
should be contoured on every contiguous slice thereafter to its inferiormost 
extent near the diaphragm. If one can identify the esophagus, this structure 
should be excluded from the heart. One need not include pericardial fat, if 
present. Contouring along the pericardium itself, when visible, is appropriate. 
 Treatment Verification 6.[ADDRESS_1188372] treatment:  6.5.[ADDRESS_1188373] be obtained and approved by a physician prior to initiation of treatment. 
 Subsequent images or films:  6.5.[ADDRESS_1188374] be obtained prior to fraction number 
5 and every 5 fractions subsequently. The imaging modality and process should be 
performed based on the institutional guidelines. 
 Radiation Therapy Adverse Events 6.6
All Radiation Therapy AEs will be scored according to the NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4 
Short Term: Fatigue is an anticipated systemic reaction to radiation treatment. Skin 
erythema, desquamation, breast edema, breast tenderness and myositis are potential 
local reactions. 
Long Term: Long term effects possibly include radiation pneumonitis, rib fractures, 
second malignancy and for left-sided lesions cardiac complications 
 STATISTICAL PLAN 7
 Sample Size Determination 7.1
The study will enroll a total of 90 patients. For Phase 1, with a sample size of 40 , 
the study has 83% power to establish that adherence is higher than 60%, assuming 
that true adherence will be 80% or greater (one-sided exact binomial test with alpha 
0.05). 
   
 
12G.616 Protocol v4.2 (04Jan2016)  31 
 Statistical Methods 7.2
Primary endpoint (adherence). We will compute the proportion of patients who are 
adherent to the diet restriction (as defined in section 3.2), along with a 95% exac t 
confidence interval. We will also use an exact binomial test (with a one-sided alpha of 
0.05) to test whether adherence is greater than 60%.  
Aim 1b. We will compute the proportion of patients with toxicity, along with a 95% 
exact confidence interval. Our institution’s historical toxicity rate among similar 
patients is about 80% and we aim to prove that the dietary intervention is non-inferior 
with an absolute margin of 10%, using an exact binomial test. With a total sample size 
of 90 and assuming that true toxicity will be 80% or lower, we have 82% power (with 
one-sided alpha of 0.05). 
Secondary endpoints. The change in body fat measurement between baseline and the 
end of the study will be analyzed via a paired t-test. Weight changes over time will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_853763] a function of time (baseline, diet weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, and 
10) via mixed-effects regression.  The patterns of change over time in vital signs, 
insulin and other clinical labs, serum markers, and psycho-social outcomes (FACT-B) 
will also be analyzed similarly. If some of these measures are skewed, we will 
transform them (e.g., log) before the analyses. Finally, local recurrence, distant 
metastases, progression free survival, and overall survival will be analyzed via 
survival methods, specifically the Kaplan-Meier method and the logrank test. If 
sufficient events occur, we may assess the impact of various patient and 
clinical/treatment variables on these outcomes via Cox proportional hazards 
regression.  
Local recurrence, progression free survival, distant metastases and overall survival 
will be assessed and compared with historic controls using the Kaplan Meier method. 
Local recurrence, progression free survival, distant metastases and overall survival 
will be measured from the date of study enrollment to time of event. 
 Subject Population(s) for Analysis 7.[ADDRESS_1188375] 4 food diaries per week 
during the diet modification phase will be used for analysis. 
 Safety and Adverse Events 8
 Definitions 8.1
 Adver se Event 8.1.1
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops 
or worsens in severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or 
injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic 
procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality: 
 results in study withdrawal 
 is associated with a serious adverse event 
   
 
12G.616 Protocol v4.2 (04Jan2016)  32 
 is associated with clinical signs or symptoms 
 leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests 
 is considered by [CONTACT_338913] 8.1.2
Adverse events are classified as serious or non-serious.   
A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
 fatal 
 life-threatening 
 requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] 
 results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 an important medical event 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, 
but are clearly of major clinical significance. They may jeopardize the subject, and 
may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted 
above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in-
patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency 
department would typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355].  
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be 
regarded as non-serious adverse events.  
 Adverse Event Reporting Period  8.1.[ADDRESS_1188376] administration of study treatment.   
 Preexisting Condition 8.1.4
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting 
condition should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the 
character of the condition worsens during the study period.  
 General Physical Examination Findings 8.1.5
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a 
preexisting condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically significant 
findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an adverse event must also be 
recorded and documented as an adverse event.   
 Post-study Adverse Event 8.1.[ADDRESS_1188377] to follow-up, or the adverse event is 
   
 
12G.616 Protocol v4.2 (04Jan2016)  [ADDRESS_1188378] to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s 
personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this 
study.  The investigator should notify the study sponsor of any death or adverse 
event occurring at any time after a subject has discontinued or terminated study 
participation that may reasonably be related to this study.  The sponsor should also 
be notified if the investigator should become aware of the development of cancer or 
of a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject that has 
participated in this study.   
 Abnormal Laboratory Values 8.1.7
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if any 
one of the following conditions is met:   
 The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm the 
abnormality 
 The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity 
 The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; e.g. change of 
dose, discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow-up assessments, further 
diagnostic investigation, etc. 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_146706] 8.1.8
Any adverse event that results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_853731] a serious adverse event unless specifically 
instructed otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition responsible for surgery should 
be documented as an adverse event if the condition meets the criteria for and 
adverse event.  
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are 
reported as an adverse event in the following circumstances: 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5110] a preexisting condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an 
outcome of an adverse event if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic 
and the outcome was uneventful. 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_413722]. 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16458], unless it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85367]. 
 Recording of Adverse Events 8.[ADDRESS_1188379] seek information on adverse 
events by [CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all 
adverse events should be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in 
the appropriate adverse event module of the case report form (CRF).  All clearly 
related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should be 
   
 
12G.616 Protocol v4.2 (04Jan2016)  [ADDRESS_1188380] be followed 
up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the 
study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or study 
participation should be recorded and reported immediately. 
 Unblinding Procedures 8.3
This is single arm study. There is no unblinding procedure. 
 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]  8.4
There will be no formal interim analyses for purposes of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_87545]. 
However, descriptive analyses for monitoring accrual and study implementation will be 
carried out throughout the study. 
 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 8.5
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_344899]/her site.  This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate 
reporting of adverse events as noted above, as well as the compliance and 
implementation of the KCC data and safety-monitoring plan.  Medical monitoring will 
include a regular assessment of the number and type of serious adverse events by 
[CONTACT_233743]. 
 Medical Monitoring and AE/SAE Reporting 8.5.1
A Medical Monitor is assigned to this study at the Thomas Jefferson University.  
This is a physician/pharmacist who is not directly involved in the trial, and is not 
currently collaborating with the sponsor/investigator on any other trial.  The role of 
the Medical Monitor is to review all reportable AEs/SAEs (in real-time) including 
grading, toxicity assignments, non-reportable AEs (quarterly), protocol 
violations/deviations, as well as all other safety data and activity data observed in 
the ongoing clinical trial occurring at Thomas Jefferson University . The Medical 
Monitor may recommend reporting of adverse events and relevant safety data, and 
may also recommend suspension or termination of the study to the DSMC and TJU 
IRB.   
Every KCC investigator initiated protocol includes requirements for reporting of 
adverse events based on CTC 4.0. All events are reported to the IRB and Medica l 
Monitor using a password protected web-site. In addition all unexpected and 
serious adverse events (SAEs) are reported to the TJU IRB and to the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) if applicable. The investigator is required to submit all 
unexpected and serious adverse events to the TJU IRB and the Medical Monitor 
within the timeframes outlined in the below table. All AE/SAEs will be reported to 
   
 
12G.616 Protocol v4.2 (04Jan2016)  35 
the DSMC at the quarterly DSMC review meetings; however, if the Medical Monitor 
determines corrective action is necessary, an “ad hoc” DSMC meeting will be 
called. Fatal adverse events related to treatment which are unexpected must 
be reported within 24 hours to the TJU IRB and the DSMC. Fatalities not 
related to the study drug/device must be reported within 5 days. A summary of 
the reporting requirements for KCC investigator initiated Phase I and Phase II 
studies are presented below.

guidelines if more stringent reporting procedures are specified. 
 Data and Safety Monitoring Committee 8.5.2
Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) is the Data and Safety Monitoring 
Board (DSMB) for the KCC. The DSMC is a multidisciplinary committee charged 
with overseeing the monitoring of safety of participants in clinical trials, and the 
conduct, progress, validity, and integrity of the data for all clinical trials at the 
Thomas Jefferson University KCC. The committee meets quarterly to review the 
progress and safety of all active research protocols that are not monitored by 
[CONTACT_233745]. 
 The DSMC meets quarterly. Additional DSMC meetings are scheduled based on the 
nature and number of trials being monitored over a specified time period. The DSMC 
meets (by [CONTACT_15498]) within 24 hours following the notification of an unexpected 
adverse event felt to be related to the study drug.  
 Prior to each DSMC meeting, each board member, is provided a printout of all 
reported AEs and SAEs occurring during the reporting period for this clinical trial. 
   
 
12G.616 Protocol v4.2 (04Jan2016)  [ADDRESS_1188381] of the trial. DSMC members 
are provided with the principal investigator’s assessment, a written report 
summarizing adverse events, safety data, and activity data observed during the 
specified time period described in each protocol, as well as recommendations from 
the Medical Monitor. A review of outcome results (response, toxicity and adverse 
events) and factors external to the study (such as scientific or therapeutic 
developments) is discussed, and the Committee votes on the status of each study.  
 A summary of the board’s action is sent to each investigator, the CCRRC and TJU 
IRBs. The DSMC actions may include recommendations/requirements that will lead 
to improved patient safety and/or efficacy, significant benefits or risks that have 
developed, or other changes determined to be necessary. The DSMC may also take 
note of slow accrual or lack of scientific progress, and refer such issues to the 
CCRRC. The DSMC provides the investigator with the rationale for any decision 
made.  
 Data Handling and Record Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] [ADDRESS_1188382] of 1996 
(HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the 
subject of the following:  
 What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study 
 Who will have access to that information and why 
 Who will use or disclose that information 
 The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, 
by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation 
of subject authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use 
PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. 
that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period. 
 Source Documents 9.2
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or 
other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the 
trial. Source data are contained in source documents.   Examples of these original 
documents, and data records include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, 
laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy 
dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_5117], microfiches, 
photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media , x-rays, subject files, and 
records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico-technical 
departments involved in the clinical trial. 
   
 
12G.616 Protocol v4.2 (04Jan2016)  37 
 Case Report Forms 9.3
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the 
study. All data requested on the CRF must be recorded. All missing data must be 
explained. If a space on the CRF is left blank because the procedure was not done or 
the question was not asked, write “N/D”. If the item is not applicable to the individual 
case, write “N/A”. All entries should be printed legibly in black ink . If any entry error 
has been made, to correct such an error, draw a single straight line through the 
incorrect entry and enter the correct data above it. All such changes must be initialed 
and dated. DO NOT ERASE OR WHITE OUT ERRORS. For clarification of illegible or 
uncertain entries, print the clarification above the item, then initial and date it. 
CRFs are found in the Appendix VII.  
 Records Retention 9.4
It is the investigator’s responsibility to retain study essential documents for at least [ADDRESS_1188383] elapsed since the trial began. 
 STUDY MONITORING, AUDITING, AND INSPECTING 10
 Study Monitoring Plan 10.1
The investigator will allocate adequate time for monitoring activities. The Investigator 
will also ensure that the medical monitor or other compliance or quality assurance 
reviewer is given access to all the above noted study-related documents and study 
related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.), and has adequate space 
to conduct the monitoring visit. 
 Auditing and Inspecting 10.2
The investigator will permit study-related monitoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_5040], the funding sponsor, government regulatory bodies, and University compliance 
and quality assurance groups of all study related documents (e.g. source documents, 
regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data etc.). The investigator 
will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study-related facilities (e.g. 
pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.). 
Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection 
by [CONTACT_137713]. 
 Independent External and Internal Audits  10.2.[ADDRESS_1188384] achieved 10% of target accrual. 
However, a study can be audited at any time based on recommendations by [CONTACT_941] 
   
 
12G.616 Protocol v4.2 (04Jan2016)  38 
IRB, DSMC, CCRRC and/or the Director of Clinical Investigations, KCC. Studies 
are re-audited once they have achieved 50% of target accrual. Special audits may 
be recommended by [CONTACT_1201], DSMC or CCRRC based on prior findings, 
allegations of scientific misconduct and where significant irregularities are found 
through quality control procedures. Any irregularities identified as part of this 
process would result in a full audit of that study.  
In addition to the audits at 10 and 50%, the CRMO randomly audits at least [ADDRESS_1188385] a bi-annual basis, to verify that there is a signed and dated 
patient consent form, the patient has met the eligibility criteria, and that SAEs are 
documented and reported to the TJU IRB.  
All audit reports are submitted to the DSMC for review and action (when 
appropriate). A copy of this report and recommended DSMC action is sent to the 
CCRRC and TJU IRB. The committee regards the scientific review process as 
dynamic and constructive rather than punitive. The review process is designed to 
assist Principal Investigators in ensuring the safety of study subjects and the 
adequacy and accuracy of any data generated. The TJU IRB may, based on the 
DSMC and auditor’s recommendation, suspend or terminate the trial.  
 Ethical Considerations 11
This study is to be conducted according to US and international standards of Good 
Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and International Conference on Harmonization 
guidelines), applicable government regulations and Institutional research policies and 
procedures. 
This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to a properly constituted 
independent Institutional Review Board (IRB), in agreement with local legal 
prescriptions, for formal approval of the study conduct.  The decision of the IRB 
concerning the conduct of the study will be made in writing to the investigator before 
commencement of this study.   
All subjects for this study will be provided a consent form that is compliant with local and 
federal regulations, describing this study and providing sufficient information for subject s 
to make an informed decision about their participation in this study.  See Attachment for 
a copy of the Subject Informed Consent Form.  This consent form will be submitted with 
the protocol for review and approval by [CONTACT_14884].  The formal consent of a 
subject, using the IRB-approved consent form, must be obtained before that subject is 
submitted to any study procedure.  This consent form must be signed by [CONTACT_468272], and the investigator-designated research professional 
obtaining the consent.  
 Study Finances 12
 Funding Source 12.1
This study is financed through a generous pi[INVESTIGATOR_853733] 
   
 
12G.616 Protocol v4.2 (04Jan2016)  39

 If multifocal breast cancer, then it must be able to be resected through a single 
lumpectomy incision  
  Appropriate stage for protocol entry, including no clinical evidence for distant 
metastases, based upon the following minimum diagnostic workup: 
  History/physical examination, including breast exam and documentation of 
weight and Karnofsky Performance Status of 80-100% at study entry.  
  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test 
within 14 days of study entry 
  Women of childbearing potential must be non-pregnant and non-lactating and 
willing to use medically acceptable form of contraception during radiation therapy

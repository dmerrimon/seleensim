  December 1 1, 2018  Tool Revision History  
Version Number : 2.1 
Version Date : July 6, 2018  
Summary of Re visions Made:  
- Revised sample size from 202 to 122 . The total sample size of n=12 2 is comprised of 
n=50 for the MB -BP intervention group; n=50 for the enhanced usual care control group;  
and n=22 for the exploratory MBSR group. This sample size reflects rec ruitment during 
UH3 phase rather than during both the UH2 and UH3 phases.  
- Mediation analyses will be performed via meta -analysis of both samples from the UH2 
and UH3 phases, for which the participants were assessed using identical methods. This 
will maxim ize statistical power for mediation analyses, which require greater power.  
- Narrowed primary outcome to one (Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive 
Awareness), in order to minimize issues of multiple statistical testing and maximize 
statistical power , given the smaller sample size when analyses are restricted to the data 
collected during the UH3 phase.  
- A unique clinicaltrials.gov registration will be created based on the UH3 -specific aims, 
data collection, and analyses.  
 
Version Number : 2.2 
Version Date : August 9 th, 2018  
Summary of Revisions Made:  Replaced [CONTACT_306295] -Chih Wu with [CONTACT_698768] as the 
clinical cardiologist on the DSMB. This was done because [CONTACT_192437] and [CONTACT_425135] have 
published together in the past three year. [CONTACT_472586] and [CONTACT_698769] have not published 
together.  
 
Version Number : 2.3 
Version Date : August 16 , 2018  
Summary of Revisions Made:  
- Addressed comments and requested revisions per OCRA 8/9/[ADDRESS_948662] 10, 2018.  
- Revised Appendix B as requested by [CONTACT_698732]. Also removed sub -Appendix A, Conducting 
Orientation Sessions at the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care and Society 
University of [LOCATION_005] Medical Schoo l, as it is not utilized in this study

- Updated the study team roster to include the co -PI (King); data safety monitoring expert 
(Britton); and the study clinicians (Wu and Flynn).  
- Clarified the role UMass Medical School will play in conducting the f MRI imaging study 
and explicitly stated that the details of said study will be documented separately.  
- Removed the MBSR exploratory arm . (Refer to Nov. 6, 2018 PI [INVESTIGATOR_698702]. NCCIH provided written approval in Nov. 12, 2018 email respon se to PI)  
- Revised (clarified) descriptive language around recruitment; screening; inclusion criteria; 
blinding ; randomization procedures ; intervention timing , duration , and content; 
assessment windows ; and data management  to more accurately reflect the pla n for UH3 
study procedures.  
- Updated the full list of measures for UH3, which included the removal of: actigraphy 
devices, Mindful Skill Acquisition  scale, dietary self -efficacy, and the readiness to 
change for hypertenstive risk factors questionnaire . Addi tionally, the following measures 
were  added : the PROMIS Global Health v.1.2 scale, childhood food insecurity 
questionnaire, alcohol consumption, mindfulness home practice questions, the Connor -
Davidson Resilience scale, the Self -efficacy for chronic diseas e management 
questionnaire , and 6 -month semi -structured exit interview questions .

PARTICIPATING STUDY SITES  
There is one study site , Brown University, carrying out the  Mindfulness -Based Blood Pressure 
Reduction  (MB-BP) study  protocol outlined in this document. The Univ ersity of [LOCATION_005] 
Medical School is conducting the fMRI  Imaging  study that will recruit and scan a subset of MB -
BP study participants (see separate fMRI study protocol and related MOP for full detail) .  
 
PROTOCOL SUMMARY   
Study Title  
Mindfulness Bas ed Blood Pressure Reduction : Stage 2a Randomized Controlled Trial  
  
MB-BP Study Protocol  10 of 55 Version 2.5 
  December 1 1, 2018  Objectives  
1. Impacts of MB -BP on Primary Self -Regulation Targets:  Identify the impacts of MB -BP vs. 
enhanced usual care on the primary self -regulation target, specifically an assay of self -
related processes ( MAIA ), described in Table 1. We hypothesize that MB -BP will 
significantly improve the MAIA in directions of better self -regulation, compared to control.   
a. Secondary analyses will evaluate impacts on secondary self -regulation targets 
including an assay of emotion regulation (DERS), and cognitive processes (SART), 
described in Table 1.  
b. Exploratory analyses will evaluate engagement of MB -BP vs. enhanced usual care 
with triangulated self -regulation target assays described in Table 1  such as e motion 
regulation and stress (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_698703], Perceived Stress Scale), self -
related processes (Heart Beat Detection Task, Interoceptive Awareness fMRI Task), 
and cognitive processes (Mindful Attention Awareness Scale).  Measures such as 
the neur oimaging Interoceptive Awareness fMRI Task will replicate assays in the 
MINDFUL -PC study.  
2. Self-Regulation Targets as Mediators of MB -BP Effect on Medical Regimen Adherence 
and Health Behavior Change:   Evaluate the degree to which the engagement of MB -BP 
with self -regulation targets translates into improved prehypertension/hypertension medical 
regimen adherence, specifically for the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) -
consistent diet. We hypothesize that MB -BP will increase the DASH diet score co mpared to 
control, in participants with low DASH diet adherence at baseline (DASH diet score <5.5), 
and that the self -regulation primary outcome in Aim 1 (i.e. MAIA) is a significant mediator.  
3. Further d evelop an MB -BP therapi[INVESTIGATOR_424739] , including 
procedures for training, supervising, and evaluating therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_698704] 2018 to 
implement the Mindfulness -Based Interventions Teacher Assessment Crit eria (MBI -TAC) for 
MB-BP instructors, which is the most respected quantitative and qualitative tool developed 
to provide feedback for enhancing MBI teacher effectiveness, and establishing teacher 
certification.1-[ADDRESS_948676], and several 
collaborating cardiologists and family physician clinician -researchers. Enhanced usual care 
involves every participant being provided with a validated home blood pressure monitor (Omron, 
Model PB786N), wh ich has evidence in and of itself to potentially lower blood pressure,5,[ADDRESS_948677] Stage 2 hypertension (blood pressure 
>140/90 mmHg) will be offered to have their physicians notified, if not already being overseen 
for uncontrolled hypertension. For participants with uncontrolled hypertension who do not have 
a physician, we will work with participants to provide access within constraints of their health 
insuran ce. Enhanced usual care group participants receive an educational brochure from the 
American Heart Association entitled “Understanding and Controlling Your High Blood Pressure 
Brochure” (product code 50 -1731 ). 
 
 
MB-BP Study Protocol  11 of 55 Version 2.5 
  December 1 1, 2018  Blinding  
All study staff will be blinded to the participant treatment allocation with the exception of the 
instructor, individual who performs the randomization, and staff member coordinating 
participants within each course. All staff performing participant assessments will be blinded to 
the partici pant treatment allocation  to promote equipo ise. Data analyses will be performed by a 
statistician blinded to treatment allocation type. The data manager will be able to break blinding 
if needed (e.g. for Data and Safety Monitoring Board).  
  
Intervention Al location  
Stratified randomization will be used, as simple randomization can fail if it creates groups 
unbalanced for critical features known to affect outcomes.7,8 Stratified randomization can reduce 
both types I and II error, improve trial efficiency, and facilitate subgroup and interim analyses.7 
Randomization will be done using an online computer software program known as Research 
Randomizer (Version 4.0).9 The randomization process will occur after each new round of 
enrollment. Study enrollment will continue until target enrollment goals are  reached (i.e., n=50 
for MBBP intervention group, n=50 for enhanced usual care control group).   
 
Interventions and Duration  
Two-arm RCT comparing MB-BP vs. enhanced usual care. Follow -up assessments will take 
place within pre -defined assessment windows o ccurring around [ADDRESS_948678] of 50 individuals per group  for both the MB -BP intervention arm and the 
enhanced usual care arm. (see Figure 1 below for detail) .  
 
For more detailed discussion of group allocation, stratification factors, and how it influences 
study population, p lease refer to Section 6.2.4 .  
 
 
Inclusion/exclusion criteria:  
Inclusion Criterion : Elevated blood pressure defined as  ≥120 mmHg systolic  or ≥80 mmHg 
diastolic pressure ;10 able to speak, read, and write in English ; all adults (≥18 years of age), 
genders and racial/ethnic groups are eligible to be included.  
Exclusion Criteria: Exclusion criteria follow standard guidelines and recommendations:11 (a) 
current regular meditation practice (>once/week); (b) serious medical illness precluding regular 
class attendance; (c) current substance abuse, suicidal ideation or  eating disorder, (d) history of 
bipolar or psychotic disorders or self -injurious behaviors. These participants are excluded

2. BACKGROUND AND  RATIONALE  
2.1 Background on Condition, Disease, or Other Primary Study Focus  
The World Health Organization reported that suboptimal blood pressure (BP) is responsible for 
more than half of cardiovascular disease mortality world -wide. Furthermore, greater than half of 
those with hypertension have uncontrolled BP .12 A 2009 Institute of Medicine report 
recommended prioritizing research to “Compare the effectiveness of mindfulness -based 
interventions (e.g. yoga, meditation, deep b reathing training) and usual care in treating… 
cardiovascular risk factors. ” [ADDRESS_948680] sizes (range 0 -5 mmHg).14 Mindfulness -Based Stress 
Reduction (MBSR) has been customized to a number of disease processes, such as 
Mindfulness -Based Cognitive Therapy for patients with recurrent depression, and Mindfulness -
Based Relapse Prevention for patie nts with substance use addictions.15-[ADDRESS_948681]. The same may be 
true for hypertension , however mindfulness interventions custo mized for 
prehypertensive/hypertensive patients have never been investigated.  Until methodologically 
rigorous studies to evaluate customized interventions for hypertension are performed, we will 
not know if the observed preliminary effects of general mindf ulness interventions on blood 
pressure reduction could be much more effective with a tailored approach.   
 
The development of effective interventions that enhance the capacity for self -regulation among 
people with chronic health conditions is a major public  health challenge in the [LOCATION_002] and 
worldwide. The process of healthcare system transformation that is underway focuses on 
moving accountability for healthcare costs to healthcare systems.[ADDRESS_948682] rapi[INVESTIGATOR_698706]’ capacity to self -manage these deadly and costly chronic health conditions.19 While 
access to care20 and health education21 are essential, a person’s capacity for self -regulation is 
often the primary limiting factor in their ability to adhere to their medical regimen, collaborate on 
illness self -management, and reduce health risk behaviors.22-[ADDRESS_948683] on chronic illness management and the 
entire healthcare system. Mindfulness -Based Interventions (MBIs) have already begun to offer 
feasible basic building blocks for the rapid integration of an empi[INVESTIGATOR_595628]-optimized, trans -
diagnostic, self -regulation toolkit into healthcare across multiple contexts and age groups.  
 
Mindfulness meditation, a form of training that involves maintaining a non -judgmental form of 
attention to immediate experience,29 has been employed in both clinical and non -clinical settings 
to facilitate self -regulation and behavior change.30-34 Mindfulness -Based Interventions ( MBIs ),35 
sometimes referred to as “3rd Wave Behavioral Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],”[ADDRESS_948684] as needed in order 
MB-BP Study Protocol  14 of 55 Version 2.5 
  December 1 1, 2018  to maintain and sustain the intended goal. Self -regulatory failure is primarily determined by 
[CONTACT_698734] (or depletion of) self -regulatory strength,53 highlighting the need for interventions that 
strengthen self -regulation capacity. Current behavioral models lack a full integration of tools for 
strengthening self -regulation towards both initiation and maintenance of behavior change.51,52 
Strategi es focusing on extrinsic rewards or behavioral economics can help change behavior, but 
intrinsic motivation is ultimately essential to self -regulation.54 Behavioral and psychological 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_698707] p rovide emotional regulation strategies and some even include motivational 
components;55,[ADDRESS_948685], MBIs uniquely integrate training in the emotional, motivational, and 
cognitive aspects of self -regulation within one therapeutic intervention.  By [CONTACT_698735] a specific orientation to experience (curious, open -minded, 
and accepting), mindfulness practice strengthens the capacity for frequent daily corrective 
adjustments needed to stay on track with intended goals. Studying how common self -regulation 
targets influence, and are influenced by, variou s components of MBIs provides a  unique 
opportunity to develop an easy -to-disseminate, integrated therapeutic intervention optimized 
with the most potent components for enhancing self -regulation within the context of medical 
regimen adherence and the initiation and maintenance of health behaviors.   
 
Following recent proposals on the mechanisms of action of mindfulness by [CONTACT_27156]30,[ADDRESS_948686] self -regulation domains of mindfulness can be identified:  
(A) Cognitive processes,  including attention (i.e. orienting, alerting,63,64 vigilance,65 and 
conversely sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], cognitive f atigue, attentional lapses, and mind -wandering66); executive 
function, co nflict monitoring,67,68 impulsivity and inhibitory control,69,70 and metacognitive 
awareness.71-73 Many studies indicate that medi tation training, such as MBIs, engage these 
cognitive processes.74-87 
(B) Emotion regulation,  which is the capacity to alter the magnitude or duration of an 
emotional response.[ADDRESS_948687] also been reported112-114 which leads to the question (to be addressed by [CONTACT_698736]) of which conditions affect target engagement.  
(C) Self -related processes,  including: (i) self -efficacy  – the belief in one’s capabilities to 
execute the courses of action re quired to manage prospective situations (such as changing and 
maintaining a medical regimen),115,[ADDRESS_948688] of self -regulation and changes in 
health behavior;117,118 (ii) self-compassio n – the capacity to extend compassion to oneself in 
instances of perceived inadequacy or failure rather than engaging in either self -destructive 
behaviors (self -judgment, isolation, rumination) or in permissive, risky behaviors:119-121 self-
compassion has been found to promote health behaviors such as adhering to diets,122 smoking 
cessation,123 physical activity,124 and seeking medical treatment when needed;125 (iii) self-related 
rumination or mind -wandering  – which may be beneficial in some cases126-128 but detrimental in 
others129-133 and is a central topic in MBI research, by [CONTACT_27156]57,134 and others;135 and (iv) 
interoceptive awareness  – the awareness of internal manifestations of emotions and feelings, 
considered fundamental to the ‘experiencing self’,136-141 a particular form of awareness which 
can be enhanced by [CONTACT_698737], nonjudgmental attention (‘mindfulness’) to inner 
body sensations,32,33,[ADDRESS_948689] a Stage 2a behavioral intervention study to evaluate 
whether MBSR customized to pre -hypertensive and hypertensive patients has  the potential to 
provide clinically relevant reductions in BP.

  December 1 1, 2018   
2.2 Study Rationale  
The MB-BP Study aims to customize the standardized MBSR161-164 intervention to adult 
participants with prehypertension or uncont rolled hypertension. Similar to MBSR, the MB-BP 
intervention consists of eight 2.5 -hour weekly group sessions (plus a 2.5 -hour orientation 
session) and an 8 -hour one -day session, led by a certified MBSR instructor with extensive 
cardiovascular disease and hypertension expertise.165-178 MB-BP builds a foundation of 
mindfulness skills (e.g. meditation, self -awareness, etc.) through the MBSR curriculum. MB-BP 
then directs attention towards hypertension risk factors. Th e unique areas of MB-BP are 
education on hypertension risk factors, hypertension health effects, and specific mindfulness 
modules focused on awareness of diet, physical activity, medication adherence, weight loss, 
and alcohol consumption and  their effects on well -being. A curriculum guide has been created 
based on the standardized MBSR manual ( Appendix A), and was further developed through 
the approaches described above, and sequentially revised based on participant feedback and 
preliminary findings.163,164 MB-BP participants learn a range of mindfulnes s skills including body 
scan exercises, meditation and yoga. Homework consists of practicing skills for ≥45 min/day, 6

We will perform a Stage 2a4 two-arm RCT of MB -BP vs. enhanced usual care control. This is a 
pragmatic co ntrol group design ed to inform physicians in well -resourced settings if MB -BP 
would be of service to refer patients to as compared to enhanced usual care patients. The study 
is intended to evaluate the  impacts of MB -BP on  the primary self -regulation outcom e of 
interoceptive awareness (i.e.  MAIA) as compared to an enhanced usual care group. Secondary 
self-regulation outcomes are described in the Objectives section outlined previously . This study 
also aims to evaluate the degree to which the engagement of MB -BP with self -regulation targets 
translates into improved prehypertension/hypertension medical regimen adherence, specifically 
for the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) -consistent diet.  
 
The enhanced usual care  control group was decided upon through recommendations by [CONTACT_698738], the Data Safety Monitoring Board, and 
several collaborating cardiologists and family physician clinician -researchers. Enhanced usual 
care involves every participant being p rovided with a validated home blood pressure monitor 
(Omron, Model PB786N),[ADDRESS_948690] Stage 2 
hypertension (blood pressure >140/90 mmHg) will be offered to have their physicians notified, if 
not already being overseen for uncontrolled hypertension. For participants with uncontrolled 
hypertension  who do not have a physician, we will work with participants to provide access 
within constraints of their health insurance. Enhanced usual care group participants receive an 
educational brochure from the American Heart Association entitled “Understanding and 
Controlling Your High Blood Pressure Brochure” (product code 50 -1731 ). 
 
All research assessments will take place in the Brown University Mindfulness and 
Cardiovascular Health Lab in Providence, RI. The MB -BP intervention classes will be offered in 
both a University and community -based setting.  
 
MB-BP Study Protocol  [ADDRESS_948691] 
during the 10 week, 6 month, and 1 year assessment 
windows, which are defined as: (a) “10 week” follow up 
assessments are to occur at least one day after and up to 
five weeks after the end of the intervention (i.e. the Week 
8 class). Staff will prioritize completing 
the assessments  within the first three week s of 
the assessment  window , but will allow for participants to 
complete up to five weeks after. (b) The “6 -month” follow 
up assessments will be scheduled to occur six months 
from the orientation class date plus or minus 2.5 weeks. 
This allows for a five-week data collection period with 
prioritization given to the three -week  window  surrounding 
the official six-month  date. (c) The “1 year” follow up 
assessments  are to be completed with the intervention 
group participants only and will occur one year plus or 
minus a month after the start of the intervention (i.e., 
orientation date).   
 
If a participant is unable to complete 
an assessment  within the defined data collection  window , 
but still wishes to participate, we will allow for the 
participant to complete an online home survey and/or in 
person follow up  assessment  beyond the parameters 
defined above.  
 
Participants who were randomized to the waitlist 
enhanced usual care  group  will be offered MB -BP after 
the [ADDRESS_948692] two months for individuals in the 
intervention arm.  The intervention will be offered several times a year over the course of the 
total study duration.

4. SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF PARTICIPANTS  
4.1 Inclusion Criteria  
 Elevated blood pressure or hypertension defined as ≥120 mmHg systolic  or ≥80 
mmHg diastolic pressure.10 Able to speak, read, and write in English. All adults (≥18 
years of age), genders and racial/ethnic groups are eligible to be included.   
4.[ADDRESS_948693] guidelines and recommendations:11 (a) current 
regular m indfulness meditation  practice (>once/week); (b) serious medical illness or 
cognitive condition (e.g., dementia) precluding regular class attend ance  and/or 
participation ; (c) current substance abuse, suicidal ideation or eating disorder, (d) 
history of bipolar or psychotic disorders or self -injurious behaviors. These 
participants are excluded because they may disrupt group participation, require 
additional or specialized treatment, or are already participating in practices similar to 
the intervention.  Additionally, we will be asking participants randomized to the control 
group to restrain from engaging in any type of formal mindfulness practice mor e than 
weekly during the first six months of study involvement so as to not introduce 
confounding variables.  Individuals will be made aware of this requirement at the time 
of informed consent (first in -person screening). Anyone who is unwilling to follow the 
treatement requirement would be ineligible for the study.

(IRB). In addition to allowi ng the participant time to read over the consent form, 
trained research staff review the important points of consent with each participant . 
The informed consent process is documented.  A signed copy of the consent is kept 
on file in a secure location in the  research lab separate from study data and a copy i s 
offered  to the participant to keep with his/her personal records. Due to the nature and 
delivery of the intervention, all participants must be able to read and write in English 
and be able to provide inf ormed consent for their participation.  
5. STUDY INTERVENTIONS  
5.1 Interventions, Administration, and Duration   
MB-BP Intervention Description:  This study proposes to customize MBSR to 
participants with prehypertension/hypertension creating an intervention  called 
Mindfulness Based Blood Pressure Reduction Study  (MB-BP). Specifically, MB-BP is 
based on the standardized MBSR intervention described elsewhere,161-[ADDRESS_948695] of eight 2.5-hour weekly group sessi ons, a 2.5 hour orientation,  and an 8 -
hour one -day session. MB -BP will be performed by [CONTACT_698739]190 with formal training in cardiovascular health (e.g. dietician, physician 
assistant, health and wellness coach, and those with an Associate’s or Bachelor’s 
degree in relevant health sciences), and further certification in MB -BP. MB-BP 
instructor training in volves: (1) An initial 40 hour in -person or online videoconference 
training where the unique elements of MB -BP are introduced. (2) Two half -day in -
person training retreats where MB -BP-specific teaching modules are practiced in 
peer groups, supervised by [CONTACT_3433] e senior MB -BP trainer, with peer and trainer feedback. 
(3) Studying specific evidence -based articles on hypertension etiology, treatment and 
prevention, as well as articles synthesizing evidence of mindfulness on hypertension 
and hypertension risk factors . 10,183,191 -193 A written exam evaluates knowledge in this 
area, for which instructors -in-training need to pass. (4) Supervised teaching of MB -
BP in non -study participants is done using the Mindfulness -Based Inter vention 
Teacher Assessment Criteria (MBI -TAC), 1,2,194 and an annotated MB -BP Curriculum 
Guide until adequate quality is established within predefined criteria.  
The unique areas of MB-BP are education on hypertens ion risk factors, hypertension 
health effects, and specific mindfulness modules focused on awareness of diet, 
physical activity, medication adherence, alcohol consumption, stress, and social 
support for behavior change. A Curriculum Guide  has been created based on the 
standardized MBSR manual developed at UMass Medical School ( Appendix 
B).163,164 MB-BP sessions contain instruction and practice in mindfulness meditation, 
and conversations about stress and copi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Stu dents learn a range of mindfulness 
skills including body scan exercises, meditation and yoga. Homework consists of 
MB-BP Study Protocol  19 of 55 Version 2.5 
  December 1 1, 2018  practicing skills for ≥45 min/day, 6 days/week. All MB -BP classes are to be held in 
either University or community -based locations in a comfo rtable, accessible 
environment where privacy is able to be maintained.  
 
MB-BP builds a foundation of mindfulness skills (e.g. meditation, self -awareness, 
etc.) through the MBSR curriculum. MB-BP then directs attention towards 
hypertension risk factors. Ear ly in the MB-BP, the importance of hypertension for 
health and mortality is described, along with hypertension risk factors. Participants 
will have their blood pressure and hypertension risk factors assessed at baseline, 
and be provided with this informati on during the first in -person MB-BP session. This 
phase aims to engage participants’ interest in hypertension risk factors, and increase 
motivation for behavior change. MB-BP encourages participants to explore personal 
readiness for change in the different  hypertension risk factors, and explore utilizing 
mindfulness practices to engage with those risk factors that they choose to. Each 
week, focus is provided on different hypertension risk factors. However, common 
themes exist across all hypertension risk fa ctors including (1) awareness of thoughts, 
emotions and physical sensations particularly surrounding hypertension risk factors 
such as overconsumption of palatable foods, sedentary activities, alcohol 
consumption, medication adherence; (2) craving, particu larly for hypertension risk 
factors such as overconsumption of palatable foods, sedentary activities, and alcohol 
consumption; (3) the impact of bringing mindfulness to every moment, particularly in 
relation to hypertension risk factors. For example, when consuming highly palatable 
food, bringing awareness to the emotions, thoughts and physical sensations prior to 
eating, during eating, and in the time  afterwards. Participants are trained to bring 
non-judgmental attention to the often short -term pleasure of  overconsumption of 
foods, sedentary activities, heavy alcohol consumption, or not taking medications, 
and bring non -judgmental attention to the longer term suffering associations with 
these activities. Through this process, participants are encouraged to reflect on if 
behavioral choices provide more benefit or harm to their well -being, and to choose 
the behaviors that bring benefit. (4) Self -care: as awareness of thoughts, emotions 
and physical sensations increases, and self -regulation will likely increase s as a result 
of the meditation practices, the curriculum will emphasize to participants that it is 
common for people to start caring for themselves more. It is a way of better knowing 
ourselves, and through knowing ourselves in in each moment, we often wa nt to care 
for ourselves in each moment. This may mean taking medication that will help our 
health, or being more physical active, eating more healthily, or consuming more 
moderate amounts of alcohol.

  December 1 1, 2018  technologically enhanced forms of meditation logs (e.g. accelerometer -based 
ecological momen tary assessment and actigraphy score; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) , and found 
large proportions of participants had difficulty using the device properly (e.g. failing to 
stop meditation timers), which hampered data quality ( paper in progress ). We 
discussed this issue with  leading meditation researchers, and meditation logs remain 
their recommended method at this time. However, innovative approaches are being 
explored by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Lazar, including smartphone apps linked to audio homework files, 
with timers linked to data exports.  These technologies are not yet ready for use, but 
we will incorporate technological advances for homework monitoring once 
demonstrated to be effective.  Data analyses will evaluate effect modification by 
[CONTACT_698740]-BP practices.

(34) Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI):  Participants in the UH3 phas e 
who elect to take part in the fMRI imaging study will undergo an fMRI scan ning 
session for approximately [ADDRESS_948699] is in the resting state. Final 
sample size w ill be 24 per group  (n=48); enrolling up to [ADDRESS_948700] outcomes.7,8 Stratified 
randomization  can reduce both types I and II error, improve trial efficiency, and 
facilitate subgroup and interim analyses.7 Variables used to create strata inclu de age 
(≤60 vs. >60 years), gender (male vs. female), and/or uncontrolled hypertension 
(≥140 mmHg systolic pressure, or ≥90 mmHg diastolic pressure) vs. prehypertension 
(120 to <140 mmHg systolic pressure, and 80 to <90 mmHg diastolic pressure). 
Simple ran dom sampling will occur within each of the eight strata, thus allowing for 
each arm of the study to be more balanced with respect to age, gender, and 
hypertension category. The total size of each stratum will vary from cohort to cohort. 
To conduct the rand omization, a list of participant IDs and strata characteristics will 
be provided, and a trained researcher not affiliated with the study will perform the 
randomization on participants after baseline assessment and final determination of 
eligibility is comp lete. Randomization will be done using an online computer software 
program known as Research Randomizer (Version 4.0).9 The randomization process 
will occur after each new round of enrollment  (i.e., uniqu e cohort ). If the cohort 
sample size is such that there are not enough participants for balance within the 
three strata, we will prioritize stratification by [CONTACT_698743], 
specifically by [CONTACT_698744]. Furthermore, afte r 
randomization within strata, if sample sizes in the entire sample for cohort differ by 
[CONTACT_698745], then all imbalanced groups are re -randomized 
until the entire sample differs by [CONTACT_23818] 1 participant per group (e.g. n=8 MB -
BP, n=9 enhanced usual care control). Expected cohort sizes, consistent with the 
MB-BP Study Protocol  25 of 55 Version 2.5 
  December 1 1, 2018  SARP are 1 5-20 participants. We anticipate needing to run 6 to 7 cohorts  to reac h 
the target sample size . 
 
Study enrollment will continue until target enrollment goals are reached (i.e., n=50 for 
MBBP intervention group  and n=50 for enhanced usual care control group).   
 
6.2.5 Blinding   
All study staff will be blinded to the participant treatment allocation with the exception 
of the instructor, individual who performs the randomization, and staff member 
coordinating participants within each course. All s taff performing participant 
assessments will be blinded to the participant treatment allocation to promote 
equipoise. Data analyses will be performed by a statistician blinded to treatment 
allocation type. The data manager will be able to break blinding if  needed (e.g. for 
Data and Safety Monitoring Board). Circumstances for breaking the blind would be a 
large number  of adverse experiences  (>10% of enrolled participants  reporting AEs  
rated as severe or life threatening ) taking place in one or more study gro up. In this 
case, the data safety monitoring board would be notified, and could break the blind to 
help determine the cause of the adverse experiences.  
 
6.2.[ADDRESS_948701] in -person screening assessment and at baseline, with 
the except ion that questionnaires for which the answers should not  change or be 
informative ( age, race/ethnicity, education, adverse childhood experiences , family 
history of hypertension ) are not given at follow -ups. In addition,  adverse events are 
monitored and doc umented at each of the follow -up period s as well as throughout 
the duration of an individual’s study involvement according to the data safety 
monitoring protocol put forth in this grant . Participants are also asked a set of semi -
structured questions at the  end of their six month follow up that inquire about their 
experience as either a control group member or intervention group participant .   
 
6.2.7 Completion/ Final Evaluation  
For control group participants, the 6-month  evaluation is the final visit . Upon 
completion of this assessment, they will be eligible to participate in the MB -BP 
training . Individuals in the intervention group will be assessed at 1 year follow up  with 
a subset of measures (see Table 6.1 Schedule of Evaluation)  in order to assess long 
term effects of the intervention.  
7. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
7.1 Expected Risks and Specification of Safety Parameters  
Meditation -related risks:  NCCIH states that meditation is generally safe for healthy people, but 
that adverse effects have also been reported. [ADDRESS_948702] been documented in more than 40 scientific reports [for reviews see 6-8] and are listed in 
the Mindfulness -Base d Intervention Guidelines.9,[ADDRESS_948703] been reported by [CONTACT_698746]: increased depression, anxiety or panic, re -
experiencing of traumatic memories, dissociation, executive dysfunction, headaches/body pain 
and insomnia.6,11-[ADDRESS_948704] been reported, mostly in the contexts of intensive retreats (>5 hrs/day) or in 
conjunction with pre -existing psychopathology.6,8,9,17 The frequency of serious ad verse effects in 
the context of MBIs is estimated to be less than 1%, although adequate estimates are not 
available.[ADDRESS_948705] been taken to minimize meditation -related risks at different stages of 
the study. During the pre -enrollment stage, individuals with severe mental illness are excluded 
from the study and all risks are clea rly communicated in the consent form. During treatment, 
meditations are relatively short and interspersed with dyads and reflections. Mindfulness 
homework assigned as part of the intervention is optional and is recommended to not exceed 1 
hour per day. Tea chers query participants about their experiences with meditation, and provide 
corrective feedback or modifications when needed. Developi[INVESTIGATOR_698712]. Because not all par ticipants 
feel comfortable disclosing difficulties in class, an online “safety check -in” questionnaire will 
query meditation -related risks (see section 6.2.1). [CONTACT_425136], a licensed psychiatrist, will be 
available to advise on any psychological event s that occur, and provide referrals for treatment if 
needed. Additionally, [CONTACT_425137] [CONTACT_698747], including providing DSMP specific training to research staff and investigators.  
 
Psychological  distress:  Research subjects participating in this study may have feelings of loss of 
privacy from being contact[CONTACT_424893], and possible psychological 
distress caused by [CONTACT_698748] -person and online questionnaire s that bring up 
painful memories or feelings. However, the resulting potential for injury to research subjects is 
judged to be minimal. We have already contact[CONTACT_425017]’s Health Initiative 
using similar assessment procedures to this study, with good responses from the participants. 
With regard to psychological distress from taking part in the MB -BP intervention, given that 
screening questions will exclude  participants with substantial mental illness, and given the 
NCCIH statement above that “Meditation is considered to be safe for healthy people.”[ADDRESS_948706], w ill be available to advise on any psychological events 
that occur, and provide referrals for treatment if needed.  
 
Loss of confidentiality:  Likelihood: rare. Minimization: Confidentiality will be maintained by [CONTACT_698749].  All paper for ms and data collection tools, including the informed 
consent forms, will be kept in a locked filing cabinet in a secure location. All electronic data files 
containing identifying information will be encrypted with a cloud -based software.  Note that 
althoug h these measures have been taken to protect participants’ personal information, 
complete confidentiality cannot be guaranteed when transmitting information over the internet. 
All information obtained from participants will be accessible only to research st aff. 
 
Injury due to physical activities:  It is possible that injuries could be sustained from (1) the gentle 
mindful movements (yoga), or (2) physical activities that participants engage in as a result of the 
intervention encouraging exploration of physica l activity as a way to reduce blood pressure. (1) 
Mindful movements: Participants receive a handout during the orientation showing the yoga 
MB-BP Study Protocol  [ADDRESS_948707] any physical limitations, so that the providers can advise on which poses to do, and which 
to avoid. (2) Physical activities: Participants ar e encouraged to explore physical activities that 
promote strength and conditioning as a way to reduce blood pressure. As with the mindful 
movements, they are encouraged to explore limits in their body related to movement, but not to 
go beyond those limits.  Participants are asked to listen to what their body is telling them more 
closely than what the mindful movement instructor is telling them. Furthermore, they are 
encouraged to ask their healthcare provider about advised physical activities if they have an y 
physical limitations.  
 
Risks associated with fMRI:  The fMRI study will be conducted using a 3T MR scanner at UMass 
Medical School, which has been approved for research and clinical studies in children and 
adults by [CONTACT_1622]. Magnetic resonance (MR) techno logy does not use X -rays, but instead uses 
strong magnetic fields and radio waves. Individuals interested in participating in the fMRI study 
will complete a screening questionnaire to assess eligibility, including asking whether they have 
devices that can be affected by [CONTACT_698750] (e.g., claustrophobia, body mass greater than 
300 lbs.) that prohibit the ability to be scanned. Participants are screened immediately prior to 
each MRI scan to ensure participant safety. Significant risks also can arise if  ferromagnetic 
materials are brought into the high magnetic field environment of the scanner and immediate 
vicinity, as they can become hazardous projectiles. These types of items are not permitted in 
the scanning area. The MR exams are painless, and excep t for the pulsating sounds, subjects 
will not be aware that MR scanning is taking place. With proper safety precautions in terms of 
the avoidance of metal objects, there are no known health risks associated with MRI. The safety 
of MRI is reflected in the f act that it is used in standard medical practice without the requirement 
for informed patient consent. Most people experience no ill effects from the magnetic field, but 
some report claustrophobia, dizziness, mild nausea, headaches, a metallic taste in the ir mouth, 
double vision, or a sensation of flashing lights. These symptoms are transient and resolve 
quickly after the subject exits the scanner. The technologist will be able to hear subjects at all 
times and subjects are free to end the procedure at any time. In rare cases, a very slight, 
uncomfortable tingling of the back due to the rapid switching of the magnetic field has been 
reported during certain types of scans. Subjects are asked to report this immediately so the 
scan can be changed to avoid this.  Although these precautions will avoid all known risks 
associated with MR, this procedure may involve risks that are currently unknown. The scanner 
is noisy, but does not harm hearing. For comfort, subjects will be given earplugs to muffle the 
noise.  
 
Risk of adverse events during the study:  It is possible that some patients will have an adverse 
event during the study, including increased stress or anxiety. Participants with major mental 
health conditions, such as schizophrenia, history of psychosis, bipola r depression, suicidal 
ideation, borderline personality disorder, post -traumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive 
disorder, panic attacks, current alcohol or substance abuse, or an eating disorder are ineligible 
for the study. We expect risk of advers e events to be very low. For further discussion of AE and 
SAE monitoring and reporting refer to Section 6.[ADDRESS_948708] statement:  These risks are considered to be minimal and are addressed in the protocol 
and consent form.  
MB-BP Study Protocol  28 of 55 Version 2.5 
  December 1 1, 2018  7.2 Methods and Timing for As sessing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety 
Parameters  
Safety monitoring will occur continuously throughout the study using both active and passive 
monitoring methods outlined and discussed in further detail below. All reported AEs, SAEs, and 
unanticipated pr oblems will be recorded throughout the study using the data collection systems 
set up and detailed in the Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP)  
The research staff will record all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after 
informed consent  is obtained but no later than the final 1-year assessment. At each study visit, 
the research staff will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit (or time of 
most recent reporting).  Events will be followed for outcome information until  resolution or 
stabilization or until the grant funding ends.  
 
7.3 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events , Reporting Procedures, and 
Follow -up 
An adverse event (AE) is generally defined as any unfavorable and unintended diagnosis, 
symptom, sign (includi ng an abnormal laboratory finding), syndrome or disease which either 
occurs during the study, having been absent at baseline, or if present at baseline, appears to 
worsen.  A serious adverse event (SAE) is generally defined as any untoward medical 
occurren ce that results in death, is life threatening, requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8448], results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or 
is a congenital anomaly . 
 
Per NCCIH safety monitoring requirements , all AEs and SAEs captured and/or observed 
involving enrolled study participants will be recorded regardless of their relationship to the study 
intervention. Below we outline possible AEs and SAEs that may occur related to this research 
study and interven tion; present our procedures for capturing and recoding; and detail the 
protocol for follow up of AEs. For further discussion of the procedures related to safety 
monitoring and follow up procedures refer to Section 7.4. Safety Monitoring.  
 
Safety Check -ins: All participants enrolled in the study, regardless of treatment allocation, will 
receive a two -tiered safety monitoring ‘check -in’ every 2 weeks during the treatment phase of 
the study; every month during months 3 -6 of the follow -up phase; and at the fin al 1-year time 
point. The two -tiered system is designed to detect and follow up on AEs that are at least 
moderate in severity (interfere with ADL), and to minimize staff and participant burden that 
would otherwise occur if all mild even ts were queried and documented.  
 
Tier 1 of the safety check -in involves sending all active, enrolled participants an email (or 
placing a phone call from a research staff member, if no email provided) containing a link to a 
brief online survey that queries events with moderate  or greater levels of severity. Any 
participant who endorses one or more tier [ADDRESS_948709] common meditation -related side effects (e.g. 
anxiety, depression, dissociation, flashbacks etc.) using patient -reported outcomes 
measurement information system (PROMIS) or NeuroQol items (or other validated scales if 
construct is not available), and PROMIS response options (never - very often).  
 
MB-BP Study Protocol  29 of 55 Version 2.5 
  December 1 1, 2018  Additionally, the tier 2 survey will ask participants to provide further detail (i.e., date of onset, 
symptomology, circumstance surrounding the event, relatedness to the intervention, etc.) 
regarding the AE/SAE reported in the tier 1 survey. Deta il provided will be used to guide the tier 
2 phone calls made by [CONTACT_44498].  
 
Tier 2 Safety Check -in phone call: Any participant who indicates that he or she experienced an 
AE or SAE will then receive a follow up call from a trained research staf f member. The purpose 
of the follow up call will be to further document the details of the AE/SAE, assess need for 
treatment modification, referrals and reporting.  
 
Research staff members conducting the safety monitoring phone interviews will document the 
details of the AE/SAE using the Adverse Events Form, which will then be included in the 
participant file as well as in the annual Data Safety Monitoring Reports presented to the DSMB.  
Reporting procedures for AEs and SAEs related to the study will be foll owed including reporting 
all SAEs to the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_698713].  
 
7.3.1  Mental Health  
Participants assigned to any treatment group may experience mental health or suicidal ideation 
during the course of their study involvement. All study particip ants will be monitored for AEs and 
SAEs by [CONTACT_446314] a monthly basis until the time of their study completion.  Additionally, 
participants will be asked to complete questionnaires about anxiety, depression and suicidal 
ideation, specifically the Beck Anxiety Inventory and the Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_698714] (CESD -R), at each of their in -person assessments, excluding the 
one year follow up. [CONTACT_425139], a licensed psychiatrist with extensive experience evaluating 
research participan ts for clinical deterioration or suicidality, will serve as the study clinician.   
Beck Anxiety Inventory (BA):  If participant scores ≥26 on the Beck Anxiety Inventory, a safety 
flag will appear notifying the research assistant (RA) administering the assess ment. The RA will 
then implement the MB -BP safety protocol, which is reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_698751]. Staff are trained on the safety protocol and a hard copy of the protocol is kept in 
an accessible location in the assessment office at a ll times.  
Depressive Symptomatology:  The CESD -R will be administered during the in -person 
assessment visits, and scores will be reviewed immediately upon completion of the in -person 
assessments.  
1. Sadness (dysphoria): Question numbers 2,4, [ADDRESS_948710]  (anhedonia): Question numbers 8, 10  
3. Appetite:  Question numbers 1, 18  
4. Sleep:  Question numbers 5, 11, 19  
5. Thinking / concentration:  Question numbers 3, 20  
6. Guilt (worthlessness): Question numbers 9, 17  
7. Tired (fatigue): Question numbers 7, 16  
8. Movement (agitati on): Question numbers 12, 13  
9. Suicidal ideation:  Question numbers 14, [ADDRESS_948711] two weeks.  If participants 
meet criteria for major depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], a safety flag will appear notifying the research 
MB-BP Study Protocol  30 of 55 Version 2.5 
  December 1 1, 2018  assistant (RA) administering the assessment. The RA will then implem ent the MB -BP safety 
protocol, which is reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_69985]. Staff are trained on the 
safety protocol and a hard copy of the protocol is kept in an accessible location in the 
assessment office at all times.  
 
If participants re spond having any suicidal ideation (CES -D questions 14 or 15), staff will again 
be instructed to follow the IRB approved safety protocol.  
 
7.3.2  Physical Health  
Possible atrial fibrillation detected during Heartbeat Detection Task: If possible atrial fibri llation is  
indicated by [CONTACT_698752] “Heart Beat Detection Task” a safety flag will 
appear notifying the research assistant (RA) administering the assessment. The RA will then 
implement the MB -BP safety protocol.  
 
Out-of-range blood  pressure readings : If during an in -person assessment the participants 
systolic blood pressure (SBP) and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) falls outside of the 
acceptable range outlined in the safety protocol, the RA will be notified and the IRB approved 
safety protocol will be implemented.   
 
Injury due to physical activities: It is possible that injuries could be sustained from (1) the gentle 
mindful movements (yoga), or (2) physical activities that participants engage in as a result of the 
intervention e ncouraging exploration of physical activity as a way to reduce blood pressure.  
 
(1) Mindful movements: Participants receive a handout during the orientation showing the 
yoga poses that will be offered during the course. They are encouraged to explore limits 
in their body related to movement, but not to go beyond those limits Participants are 
asked to listen to what their body is telling them more closely than what the mindful 
movement instructor is telling them. Modifications of poses are available, including f or 
those limited to chairs or wheelchairs. Participants are encouraged to bring the handout 
of poses to their health care providers if they have any physical limitations, so that the 
providers can advise on which poses to do, and which to avoid.  
 
(2) Physical activities: Participants are encouraged to explore physical activities that 
promote strength and conditioning as a way to reduce blood pressure. As with the 
mindful movements, they are encouraged to explore limits in their body related to 
movement, but not  to go beyond those limits. Participants are asked to listen to what 
their body is telling them more closely than what the mindful movement instructor is 
telling them. Furthermore, they are encouraged to ask their healthcare provider about 
advised physical  activities if they have any physical limitations.  
 
Note that adverse events related to physical injuries will be captured during the routine safety 
check -ins (discussed above) . 
 
7.3.3  Other  
Participant Initiated (Passive monitoring):  Participants are enc ouraged to contact [CONTACT_698753]/or study staff if any physical or mental health symptoms arise or other study or 
meditation -related problems occur. Participants may report AEs at any time throughout the 
study. Events will be evaluated with th e Adverse Events Form by [CONTACT_464].  
MB-BP Study Protocol  31 of 55 Version 2.5 
  December 1 1, 2018  Attrition:  Reasons for attrition are also an important source of AEs, but are rarely assessed 
adequately, as participants are unlikely to give honest answers if queried directly by [CONTACT_464]. 
To increase the accurac y of attrition reason reporting, participants will be asked to complete a 
brief online Participant -initiated dropout reason survey (see Appendix A7).  
Investigator -initiated withdrawals: In rare ci rcumstances, a study participant may be withdrawn 
from the study and/or intervention  by [CONTACT_3021]. In this case, the researcher or other study 
staff should complete the Attrition information form, and describe reasons for attrition.  Note, 
however, that this scenario would be very unusual, and has not happened once in the in the 
approximately [ADDRESS_948712] this scenario to 
occur extremely rarely (as evidenced to date), but rema ins a possibility.  
fMRI Study Safety Monitoring:  it is possible participants may experience or report an AE or SAE 
durin g their involvement with the fMRI Study. Research staff will use the Adverse Events Form 
and accompanying documents found in the Appendices to document all AE/SAE discovered at 
the time of involvement in the fMRI imaging study. The logged events will then be 
communicated to the Coordinating Center, so that they can be included in the participant file as 
well as in the annual Data and Safety Monitoring Reports presented to the DSMB.  Reporting 
procedures for AEs and SAEs related to the study will be followed  including reporting all SAEs 
to the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_698713].  
 
Non-Response to Treatment : The possibility that the treatment will not yield benefit is another 
possible risk and will be explained during informed consent procedures. Non -responders 
(identified as minimal change in medical regimen adherence from baseline assessment) will be 
provided with referrals to other treatment, if desired.  
 
The data collection systems we have set up to monitor and record AEs and SAEs are 
specifically designed to  avoid double capture. Unique participant identifiers, dates and details 
surrounding events, as well as steps taken to follow up are recorded.  
 
7.4 Safety Monitoring  
Oversight of internal monitoring of the participants’ safety will be conducted by [CONTACT_141428] l PI, [CONTACT_425144]. Oversight of the external Data and Safety Monitoring Committee will be conducted 
by [CONTACT_67061] ([CONTACT_425145]). The Data and Safety Monitoring Committee will include experts 
in cardiology (Choudhary), psychology/psychiatry (Edmondson) , epi[INVESTIGATOR_623] (Choudhary), 
and biostatistics (Liu).   
 
Entities Conducting Monitoring: The Institutional Review Board (IRBs) at Brown University will 
review all research procedures, and will provide oversight. Internal monitoring will be done by 
[CONTACT_698754] ([CONTACT_425135]) and the Brown University IRB. The Data 
Safety Monitoring Committee will provide external monitoring, and will meet annually by [CONTACT_648], 
video conference, or in -person. They will be provided data annually in orde r to evaluate 
potential effects of the RCT on major outcomes (e.g. medical regimen adherence). Any serious 
adverse effects will be immediately reported to the principal investigator (Loucks) and the 
committee chair.  
 
MB-BP Study Protocol  32 of 55 Version 2.5 
  December 1 1, 2018  What is Monitored : Monitoring is done o f all procedures to ensure that they conform to the 
approved protocol; of unforeseen circumstances that might arise and affect safety; of all reports 
of serious adverse events as defined in US Department of Health and Human Services 
regulations for the pro tection of human research subjects 45 CFR Part 46, and the FDA 312.32 
(death, life -threatening experience, new or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity); of other significant adverse events (adverse events that lead to drop out by 
[CONTACT_215750]); of unexpected adverse events resulting from the 
study; and of expected adverse events.  
 
Monitoring is done of all study inclusion and exclusion criteria. During this clinical trial, we will 
notify officials, as mandated by [CONTACT_2371], if a participant reports intention  to harm him/herself or 
others, or reports child abuse or abuse of an elder.  [CONTACT_425136], a licensed psychiatrist, will 
be available to advise on any psychological events that occur, a nd provide referrals for 
treatment if needed.  
 
Frequency of Monitoring : All adverse events will be continuously monitored by [CONTACT_978]  [INVESTIGATOR_698715] (Please see section 7.3) . 
Participants will be giv en contact [CONTACT_698755].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_698716], inc luding 
adverse events.  Any adverse events that are observed and/or reported will be reported to [CONTACT_425134] and the Data Safety Monitoring Committee chair  under the proposed timelines in the 
DSMP . The Investigators and DSMB members  will be available to meet  outside of the regularly 
scheduled meetings (scheduled annually), if necessary, due to concerns regarding a particular 
participant or any problems that may arise for participants.  If necessary, they will make 
appropriate recommendations for changes in pro tocol, or terminate the study. The Brown 
University IRB conducts the monitoring at the continuing reviews as scheduled, whenever 
modification requests are considered, and upon receiving reports of serious adverse events 
from the PI [INVESTIGATOR_215717].  
 
Report ing Plan : Any serious adverse events that are observed and/or reported will be 
immediately reported to [CONTACT_425135] and the Data Safety Monitoring Committee Chair. Serious 
adverse events related to the study are then reported to the Brown University IRB and to NIH. 
Brown University’s IRB requires fatalities related to the study be reported within [ADDRESS_948713] be approved in writing by [CONTACT_124142] h the Brown University IRB as well as by [CONTACT_22866], 
NCCIH.  
MB-BP Study Protocol  33 of 55 Version 2.5 
  December 1 1, 2018  8. INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION  
This study will be stopped prior to its completion if: (1) the intervention is associated with 
adverse effects that call into question the safety of the in tervention; (2) difficulty in study 
recruitment or retention will significantly impact the ability to evaluate the study endpoints; (3) 
any new information becomes available during the trial that necessitates stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356].  
9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATI ONS  
9.1 General Design   
Analyses will evaluate (1) whether MB-BP influences self -regulat ion targets, (2) whether the 
MB-BP-induced changes in self -regulation targets are associated with changes in medical 
regimen adh erence, and (3) whether MB-BP is associ ated with medical regimen adherence. 
Analyses will incorporate generalized linear models (GLM) with properly chosen link 
functions, performed using generalized estimating equations (GEE) with robust standard 
error estimators.245,246 This provides an extension of regression analysis to the case of 
correlated or repeated observations, allows for inclusio n of both continuous and discrete 
dependent variables, and enables modeling of covariance structures when observations are 
correlated across time. Following “intention -to-treat” principles, analyses will be condu cted 
on all participants in the randomized c ontrolled trial , regardless of intervention completion. 
Analyses will use GLM with identity links for normally distributed data. The between -groups 
independent variable in the GEE analysis is intervention condition, with control conditions as 
distinct refe rent groups. Categorical variables will be included in GLM/GEE models as 
indicator variables with one level chosen as referent . Continuous independent variables  
such as age and baseline blood pressure would be included as linear terms. In addition, we 
will include assessment time as a linear term and possibly with an additional quadratic term 
to capture possible non -linear relationship of time with the outcomes. It is conceivable that 
one would observe a steeper slope in the initial months that would decrea se in the pursuing 
months. Thus, the use of a quadratic term for assessment time would be able to capture 
these phenomena . To evaluate self -regulation targets as mediators of the effects of MB-BP 
on medical regimen adherence, mediation analyses described b y Valeri and VanderWeele 
will be employed.[ADDRESS_948714] sizes, as well as 
statistical variance.247 
9.2 Sample Size and Randomization  
Treatment Assignment Procedures  
Statistical Power:  
Utilizing effect sizes and statistical variance from the Stage 1 MB -BP clinical trial showed an 
increase  of MAIA from baseline of mean 22.6 (SD=6.5) to mean 26.3 (SD=6.0)  at 6-month  
follow -up, demonstrating a 3.7 increase in MAIA score (p<0.00 1). Power analyses using the 
T statistic and non -centrality parameter, with alpha  (two-tailed) set at 0.05 and beta a t 0.2, 
shows  with a MAIA increase of 3.7  in MB -BP vs. control, sample size requirements are  46 
per group. With DASH diet score increasing from 2.78 (SD=0.61 ) at baseline to 3.37 
(SD=0.81 ) at 6-month  follow -up in the Stage 1 MB -BP study  in the 67% of partic ipants with a 
low DASH score (<5.5) , demonstrating a DASH diet score  increase of  0.59 (p<0.001 ). Using 
an effect size of 0.[ADDRESS_948715] that, with  alpha (two -tailed) set at 0.05 and beta at 0. 2, a sample size of 33 per 
group will be sufficient.  
 
Using simulations from Fritz and MacKinnon,248 for 80% power to detect a mediated effect 
when effect of exposure on mediator, and mediator on outcome, is of small to medium 
strength (standardized Cohen’s d effect sizes of 0.26-0.39 each), based on Sobel first -order 
test, we will need 90 participants. Given that 67% of Stage 1 participants had DASH diet 
score <5.5, recruiting a sample size of 160 participants  across the UH2 and UH3 phase s 
(Figure 1) , this would allow for [ADDRESS_948716] sizes on DASH 
diet score were large Cohen’s d (d=0.82). Effect sizes on the primary self -regulation 
outcome  was medium (MAIA C ohen’s d=0.59). Assuming associations between the MAIA  
and DASH diet score are in the small to medium range, the study should be adequately 
powered for mediation analyses. Please note that Stage 1 analyses also demonstrated 
significant improvements in othe r health behaviors, including alcohol consumption and 
physical activity following the MB -BP intervention. Secondary analyses will evaluate impacts 
of MB -BP on these health behaviors, but are not adequately powered for mediation 
analyses due to the lower pr oportion of participants that do not adhere to these behavioral 
AHA guidelines (i.e. approximately 15% of participants do not comply to AHA alcohol 
guidelines, and 32% do not adhere to physical activity guidelines in our Stage 1 sample).  
 
The fMRI imaging  analyses (n=24 per group) should be adequately powered, based on 
power calculations shown in the MINDFUL -PC study below  and by [CONTACT_698756] . To achieve this, we estimate having to enroll 
up to 60 eligible study participants into the fMRI study.   
 
For fMRI s elf-regulation neural targets, r esting State Functional Connectivity (rs -FC) will be  
expressed as correlation coefficients, transformed using Fisher’s z -transformation for 
analysis. rs -FC will be obtained  at two time points (baseline: T1; post -training: T2) for 
participants and controls . We will use a mixed effects model with baseline rs -FC as an 
additional predictor for the change outcome. There are two elements to the hypotheses – 
the determination of th e significance of the change within group and the comparison of the 
change in the treatment group compared to the control group. For the comparis on in change 
between treatment and control group , with a mixed analysis of variance (within -subjects rs -
FC at T 1 and T2, and between -subjects according to intervention; sample size, total n = 48, 
24/group), we are able to detect an ES of 0.3 between the two treatment groups with 81.3% 
power (and an ES of .21 with 81.3% power for within -group mindfulness effect; an ES of 
0.23 with 87.7% power for an interaction of treatment and time), with two -sided tests at 
alpha=0.05. Thus is reasonable power to detect small - to moderate -size differences in 
BOLD.249  
 
Our calculations assume drop -out rates will average around 10 -15% across each group, 
with the control group exhibiting the highest rates of withdrawal and loss to follow up. These 
estimates are based on the Stage 1 and 2a MB -BP trials in the UH2 phase.

Self-Regulation Primary Outcome: Multidimensional Assessment o f Interoceptive 
Awareness ( MAIA ), a validated measure of body awareness.222-224 We hypothesize 
that MB -BP will significantly improve the MAIA in directions of better self -regulation, 
compared to control.  
 
 
9.5.2  Secondary Outcomes  
Self-regulation outcomes  foster triangulation, including further validated measures of 
interoceptive awareness (Heartbeat Detection Task,250,251 Interoceptive Awareness

Task,228-233), self -compassion (Self -Compassion Scale Short Form121), and self -
efficacy ( Self control  scale and SECD -6 Scale260-267). 
 
Medical regimen adherence outcome: Diet, assessed utilizing Dietary Approaches to 
Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating pattern score,181 measured via diet history food 
frequency questionnaire.182 The measure assesses adherence to JNC -7 guidelines 
DASH eating pattern score (range 0 -8).181,183

MB-BP Competency and Treatment Fidelity: Treatment fidelity strategies will be 
perfo rmed in accordance with recommendations of the NIH Behavior Change 
consortium, specifically ensuring treatment fidelity in the following five areas: study 
design, training providers, delivery of treatment, receipt of treatment and enactment 
MB-BP Study Protocol  37 of 55 Version 2.5 
  December 1 1, 2018  of treatment sk ills,268 as follows.  Study design : All session durations will be recorded 
and any deviations from the planned duration will be documented.  All class sessions 
will be taped (as conditions allow). Audiotapes will un dergo a quality assessment 
audit by [CONTACT_698758], who will review a ten percent randomly selected 
sample of the recordings. Research staff completing the audit will conduct 
competency ratings on these tapes using validated adherence scales (MBCT 
Adherence Scale, where items 1 -11 in the scale are for MBSR, MB -BP and 
MBCT269). Data from t he audit will be used to provide detailed feedback to treatment 
providers. We will ensure equivalent dose across conditions, including meditation, 
yoga and stress reduction training, through tracking the audio recordings. Possible 
setbacks in implementatio n of treatment will be addressed, including having a large 
pool of MBSR and MB -BP instructors in the event that specific instructors no longer 
teach classes. Instructor attrition will be tracked.  
Provider training:  MB-BP will be performed by [CONTACT_698739]191 with formal training in cardiovascular health (e.g. dietician, physician 
assistant, health and welln ess coach, and those with an Associate’s or Bachelor’s 
degree in relevant health sciences), and further certification in MB -BP. MB-BP 
instructor training involves: (1) An initial 40 hour in -person or online videoconference 
training where the unique element s of MB -BP are introduced. (2) Two half -day in -
person training retreats where MB -BP-specific teaching modules are practiced in 
peer groups, supervised by [CONTACT_698759] -BP trainer, with peer and trainer feedback. 
(3) Studying specific evidence -based article s on hypertension etiology, treatment and 
prevention, as well as articles synthesizing evidence of mindfulness on hypertension 
and hypertension risk factors. 10,183,192 -194 A written exam evaluates knowledge in thi s 
area, for which instructors -in-training need to pass. (4) Supervised teaching of MB -
BP in non -study participants is done using the Mind fulness -Based Intervention 
Teacher Assessment Criteria (MBI -TAC), 1,2,195 and an annotated MB -BP Curriculum 
Guide until adequate quality is established within predefined criteria.   
 
MBSR teacher certification is fairly extensive, and accreditation occurs through the 
University of [LOCATION_005] Medical School Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, 
Health Care and Society, detailed elsewhere.191 Examples of criteria for becoming a 
certified MBSR teaching include ( i) completion of an eight -week MBSR course as a 
participant, (ii) completion of several multi -day residential training courses in 
mindfulness based stress reduction practice and teaching, (iii) substantial experience 
in teaching MBSR, (iv) strong reference s letters from colleagues and participants 
who have taken your MBSR courses, (v) completion of several multi -day mindfulness 
meditation retreats, (vi) have a graduate degree in a field connected to MBSR (e.g. 
education, psychology, medicine) or demonstrati on of equivalent understanding 
through work experience in a related field. There are 89 registered MBSR programs 
in [LOCATION_005] (60), RI (9) and CT (20) that offer year -round program including 
the Center for Mindfulness where MBSR originated. Eligible pr ograms must be [ADDRESS_948718] completed the MBSR Instructor certification 
training to participate in the study.  
 
Delivery of treatment : We will assess participants’ perceptions of provider warmth 
and credibility using brief measures  based on the validated Working Alliance 
Inventory,[ADDRESS_948719], and measures of warmth and 
MB-BP Study Protocol  38 of 55 Version 2.5 
  December 1 1, 2018  credibility will be adjusted for in sensitivity analyses, to evaluate if results differ when 
these measures are included vs. excluded.  
 
Receipt of treatment and enactment of treatment skills: Adherence to the prescribed 
MB-BP practices will be monitored through class attendance, practice logs and 
diaries.  Adherence data will be collected weekly during the course of the 
intervention. Mindfulness will also be measured through the use of the validated Five 
Facet Mindfulness Ques tionnaire218 as well a s by [CONTACT_698760] -intervention.   
 
10.3.4  Protocol  Deviations  
Protocol deviations will be reported to the Brown University IRB  and NCCIH . A 
description of the deviations, and any effects on  the protection of human subjects  will

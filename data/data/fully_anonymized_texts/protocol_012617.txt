Endometriosis is a chronic illness which begins during adolescence and young adulthood. Current
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_643290], leaving many women trying to cope with chronic pain. Novel
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_643291], and prevent ongoing
suffering for these women. In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we aim to estimate the efficacy and safety of a regimen of
norethindrone acetate (a standard therapy) or cabergoline (a novel agent) for alleviating pain symptoms in
young women with endometriosis. The results of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_123834] a future, larger

If NOT checked:
Please provide scientific justification for excluding non-English speaking subjects.
In addition to the fact that there is no known difference in endometriosis prevalence with regards to
race and ethnicity, the additional burden of translation services on personnel and funding would make
performing the study impossible. As noted above, the consent process will be in-person and there will
be three in-person CTSU visits, all of which would require translator services. In addition to the
consent form, there are multiple questionnaires that would all need to be translated into multiple
languages. The requirement to include non-English speaking individuals would be unusually
burdensome for a study of this magnitude.

making capabilities)Specify population.
Specify what additional safeguards will be taken to protect the rights and welfare of these
subjects.
Adults With Decisional Impairment
*Decisional Impairment  is defined as: persons who have impaired ability to make decisions as a result
of intellectual or mental health challenges as well as individuals who have lost capacity to
make decisions because of clinical situations such as unconsciousness.
Please describe the type and range of decisional impairment of the adult subjects to be
included in the research.
Provide a rationale for why it is necessary to include adults with decisional impairment as
participants in research, including information regarding the potential benefit to the
individuals in relationship to potential risks.
Describe the criteria and procedures or measurements for evaluating the  decisional status of
the prospective participant to determine whether they are capable of consenting on their own
behalf. This would include the use of standardized measurements, consults with another
qualified professional, etc...
Describe how persons authorized to obtain legally valid consent will be identified in the event
any individual is judged incapable of consenting on their own behalf. Please review the IRB
policy to the right of this question that describes the requirements for determining a legally
authorized representative for the subject.  Briefly, these are court-appointed guardians, health
care proxies, or durable power of attorney.  Please note that family members are not
automatically considered for this role and may only be permitted when there is documentation
that neither of the previous exist.Please also explain how legal records regarding authority will
be obtained, reviewed by [CONTACT_5051], and documented in the research record.
When possible if legally valid consent cannot be obtained from the subject, assent should be
obtained. Please describe if you plan to obtain assent and provide criteria used to evaluate the
assent or dissent of the adult with decisional impairment.
If applicable to your population, provide a description of how the participant will be protected
if their capacity to consent is lost or fluctuates.  What provisions have been made to protect
the subjects's rights?  This may include the use of an ombudsman, frequent cognitive status
evaluations, etc...

Recruitment and Remuneration
Recruitment
1* Describe plans for recruitment, including identification of potential participants, who is responsible
for recruitment and how and when subjects will be recruited.
Potentially eligible participants will be identified during visits to the Pediatric Gynecology program at BCH
(including satellite sites) or the CIRS or MIGS programs at BWH. Patients will be identified by [CONTACT_643329]. 
If the patient is interested, the provider will contact [CONTACT_3476]. An IRB-approved study brochure may be
given to the patient, to allow her to contact [CONTACT_116194] . A study coordinator or another member of
the study team will meet with the patient to discuss options for involvement.
In some instances, providers may wish to give blanket approval for the study team to contact [CONTACT_75054],
rather than referring individual patients. In these instances, the study team will contact [CONTACT_643330] a recruitment letter (appendix L), and then follow up with the patient (by [CONTACT_61529], if
patient approved for research) one week later. This allows patients of very busy providers the opportunity to
participate in the study. Patients are able to opt out of the follow up call/email by [CONTACT_643331]
(Appendix N) to the study team. Providers who give patient contact [CONTACT_643332] f will be only IRB-
approved participants in the research. 
We will also recruit by [CONTACT_643333]-approved brochures in the waiting rooms of the clinics and other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_643300]. After a patient expresses interest in participating in the trial, a research assistant or
another approved member of the study team will meet with the patient/family to discuss options for
involvement and to sign the consent form. Prior to enrollment, patients will be asked what their highest
endometriosis pain score has been within the last month. Only those patients with a score of 3/10 or greater
will be eligible to enroll.
In addition, potentially eligible participants from the [LOCATION_011] Center for Endometriosis (BCE)’ "W omen’s Health
Study: from Adolescence to Adulthood" cohort (CHB IRB# IRB-P00004267) will be identified from the
enrollment logs of the BCE. Patients meeting inclusion criteria will be identified by [CONTACT_3476] (all of whom
will jointly have IRB approved roles in the BCE Study and current proposed trial), and will be contact[CONTACT_643334] (either phone, email, text) in the manner outlined below .
Patients may also be recruited from Craig's List, Facebook, and the BCH and Partners' research websites and
employee intranet pages, and will all be screened for eligibility by [CONTACT_3476]. Recruitment materials may
also be made available at the Gynecology department's annual endometriosis patient day . 
2* Will you need to search through BCH medical records or institutional databases such as i2b2 or
BCH360 for the initial screening for potentially eligible subjects?
  Yes No
If YES:
2.1Will you be accessing records or contact [CONTACT_643335],
your service or your co-investigators?
  Yes No
In general, recruitment of patients from services outside of the investigators’ area is not to be done
without involvement of the departments in which the patients were seen.  
If YES:
2.1.1 Please describe how you will coordinate with other departments or care providers during
the recruitment process.
3If applicable, how will prospective subjects' healthcare providers (e.g., physician, dentist, etc.) be
involved in the recruitment and/or be notified of their individual patients' participation in the study? 
Subjects' healthcare providers may choose to give potentially eligible patients a study brochure, or refer
them to a study team member for further discussion regarding study participation. Participation or non-
participation in the study will not alter clinical care for patients in any way . 
Prospective subjects' gynecologic and primary care healthcare providers will be notified of their individual
patients' participation in the study by [CONTACT_643336] a written letter , if agreed to by [CONTACT_230080].

All prospective participants will meet with a member of the study team trained in proper recruitment and
consenting of study participants. All prospective participants will be made aware that study involvement is
completely voluntary. Choosing to participate or not participate will not affect patients' care. The consent forms
will explicitly state that participation is voluntary and the decision to participate or not participate will not af fect
a patient's clinical care.
5* Does the recruitment strategy involve contact[CONTACT_643337]? 
  Yes No
If YES:
5.1Please describe how frequently and in what manner individuals will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].
Potentially eligible participants from the BCE "Women’s Health Study: from Adolescence to
Adulthood" Study cohort will be identified from the enrollment logs of the BCE. Patients meeting

(a) A controlled clinical investigation other than phase [ADDRESS_860994] to FDA regulation
(requires registration). CONTROLLED is defined as a design to permit comparison of a test
intervention with a control to provide a quantitative assessment of the drug/ effect. This can
include concurrent control groups as well as non concurrent controls including historical
controls or subjects as their own controls (requires registration by [CONTACT_1260])
(b) Protocol prospectively compares a device-based intervention subject to FDA regulation against a
control in human subjects (requires registration). An INTERVENTION broadly includes various
techniques using the device such as, among other things device regimens and procedures, and use of
prophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic agents. This applies to studies other than a small clinical trial to
determine feasibility of a device, or a clinical trial to test prototypes devices where the primary outcome
measure relates to feasibility and not health outcome. (Requires registration by [CONTACT_1260])
(c) A device trial that is a pediatric post-market surveillance trial (requires registration by [CONTACT_643343])
(d) Protocol prospectively assigns human participants or groups of humans to one or more health-
related interventions to evaluate the effects on health outcomes.” Health-related interventions include
any intervention used to modify a biomedical or health-related outcome (for example, drugs, surgical
procedures, devices, behavioral treatments, dietary interventions, and process-of-care changes). Health
outcomes include any biomedical or health-related measures obtained in patients or participants,
including pharmacokinetic measures and adverse events. (ICMJE requires registration)
(e) Protocol does not meet any of the criteria above (a-d) but research will be registered on
clinicaltrials.gov (voluntary registration, statement optional)

3* Explain the rationale for including or not including research data and the informed consent/assent
forms in the CHB medical records.
Given that this is an interventional trial, knowledge of the medications that a subject may be randomized to
may be helpful to members of the subjects' healthcare team. As such, the consent form will be available to be
viewed in the medical record. 
For subjects who are not patients at BCH, operative reports will be collected to ensure they meet inclusion
criteria. These reports will be scanned into the newly created BCH medical record as source documentation.
Please note: the confidentiality section of the consent form must specify whether research data and/or the

Privacy
1* ‘Privacy’ refers to a person’s desire to control access of others to themselves. Describe the steps that will be taken to
protect and assure the privacy of the subject. 
Detail specific actions the Research Team will take to ensure that privacy is protected through each phase of the study
(e.g. access to medical records for recruitment, mailings to subjects, phone calls with subjects, research visits).
Patients with endometriosis will be approached about the study in the gynecology clinic where they receive clinical care. In most
cases, the treating physician will discuss participation in the study with the patient in a private of fice or treatment room, and will ask
if they are willing to speak with the study coordinator. The physician will provide each patient with a study brochure for her review.
Interested patients will meet with the study coordinator in a private setting to discuss involvement in the study . Patients will be
made aware the study is voluntary and participation will not affect clinical care. For all participants, the consent process will take
place in a private setting. Participants will be encouraged to ask questions and to illustrate full understanding of the study
procedure and risks/benefits. 
Other potential subjects may approach the study team in response to flyers posted in clinic, or given to them by [CONTACT_643344] a clinic visit. Phone calls with potential subjects to screen for eligibility for participation will also be conducted
in a private setting.
During research visits, participants will complete study questionnaires in a private room setting. 
Participants will determine their preferred means of communication (phone call, email, text), and if there are any means of
communication that they never wish to employ. When phone calls are made, the study will be referred to in general terms that will
not disclose the exact nature of study participation. Information which may identify the purpose of the study or the disease status of
the participant will not be recorded on voicemail or answering machine. 
Examples of issues:
• Potential subjects may not want to be approached for research purposes by [CONTACT_643345] . 
• Potential subjects may not want others to know they have a disease or were previously treated for a condition;
  therefore, you may want to avoid sending a recruitment letter in the mail that may be opened by [CONTACT_2312]. 
• Subjects may not want to be seen in areas that may stigmatize them (i.e. pregnancy counseling center).
Confidentiality
2* Investigators are required to obtain only the minimum data necessary to achieve the research goals. 
Please justify why the data you are obtaining is the minimum necessary .
For subjects, the date of diagnostic surgery, stage of endometriosis at diagnosis, and other comorbid health conditions will be
obtained from the medical record or by [CONTACT_6270]-report from the patient. All participants will complete questionnaires regarding their
overall health, pain status, functional status, medical history, gynecological history, and mental health. These data are all necessary
to assure the patient's eligibility for participation, to quantify our outcome measures, and to account for confounding or mediating
factors that may impact the effects of our interventions. Identifying information from all data sources will be removed at collection.
All data samples will be identified by a randomly generated study ID number unique to each participant.
3* Describe where data will be kept, how it will be secured and who will have access to the data.  If links to identifiers are
used, please describe the coding mechanism, whether the code is derived from subject information, and how and where
the mechanisms for re-identification will be protected and maintained.
Each participant will be assigned a unique study ID number which will be used to label and track all of her study data. Study ID
numbers will be randomly generated at the time of study enrollment. The date of collection will also be placed on each sample and
survey. To protect confidentiality, no names will be used on samples to link samples to a specific person. 
A key to the code linking samples to the participant will be kept in a secure MS Access database management system. This
database system will be accessible by [CONTACT_643346] f who have been trained in
HIPAA guidelines and requirements. The password will be provided on an as-needed basis. 
The INFORM database will house the study data. This database will include information from participants’ questionnaires, as well
as clinically relevant information (date of diagnosis, stage of disease, current treatment regimen) for subjects. Again, this database
will only be accessible to approved members of the study team. Information in the database will be identified using the same study
ID numbers placed on participants’ blood samples and surveys.
4* Provide a plan to protect the identifiers from improper use and disclosure.
When participants enroll in the study, their name, date of birth, and CHB/BWH medical record number will be recorded alongside
their newly assigned study ID number in the Access database. This will be accessible only to certain approved members of the
study team. No one else will have access to the key or other identifying patient information. 
5* Provide a plan for destroying the identifiers at the earliest opportunity consistent with the conduct of the research or
provide a health or research justification for retaining the identifiers. For protocols that may be subject to future
continuing and secondary data analysis, the IRB highly recommends providing justification for not destroying identifiers
permanently.
When samples are collected from participants, samples will immediately be deidentified from the patient and will be identified by
[CONTACT_2299]'s study ID number and not with name [CONTACT_643371]. The visit date will be placed on the sample to prevent errors in

with the participant's study ID number. 
The information gathered in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_643304], and will
go on to inform future larger randomized trials. Because this research gains strength and depth as the number of patients
increases, there is no immediate plan to destroy the master list which will tie data/samples to patient identifying information.

2. Drs. DiVasta and Hornstein have successfully conducted multiple clinical trials involving recruitment of
research subjects from CHB and BWH. [CONTACT_643388] is an experienced epi[INVESTIGATOR_643306], and will be essential in thoughtful analysis of the data and any adverse events. [CONTACT_643389] is
an experienced obstetrician/gynecologist and researcher at BWH.

stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_363200], and if any interim analysis will be performed (if so, on what basis). If
this information is in protocol, please specify where relevant information is located.
Risks of this study are low, but greater than minimal risk, due to the fact that the medications to be used
have minimal potential side effects and will be given in traditionally accepted/clinically utilized doses 
Given that this is a small pi[INVESTIGATOR_643307], aggregate unblinded data will not be
reviewed by [CONTACT_643348]. Potential side ef fects of the medications will be reviewed at
each study visit by [CONTACT_23164], and laboratory data obtained, looking for any significant safety
issues. Any concerns regarding side effects of the medication, or any laboratory values outside of the expected
range, will be brought to the attention of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_643308] .
7If this protocol is for a multicenter trial what mechanisms are in place to either receive or distribute
results of the data and safety monitoring function in a prompt manner .
The protocol will be conducted at BWH and CHB. The same investigator group is overseeing and running
the trial at both institutions, so dissemination of data and results will be seemless. The monitoring group will
have access to all data, regardless of at which institution the subject is seen.

Risks and Benefits
Risks
1 * Provide a description of the foreseeable risks to subjects. Consider all types of risks,
including physical, psychological, social/reputation, legal, financial, privacy and breach of a
promise of confidentiality. 
The potential risks and discomforts include a bruise at the site of venipuncture (for subjects electing
to provide a blood sample); infection resulting from venipuncture is also a risk, albeit very rare. Subjects
may also experience discomfort when asked sensitive questions about their lifestyle as part of the
questionnaire. 
Another potential risk to participation would be a breach of confidentiality . In order to minimize this risk,
all samples are stored with a code number unique to each participant. Samples will not be labeled with
any type of identifying information such as name [CONTACT_17929] . All health information is also
de-identified, and labeled only with the code number. All data are kept in a secured server, in files that
are password protected. Only authorized personnel within the [LOCATION_011] Center for Endometriosis will have
access to identifying information. If samples are shared with researchers, they will be identified only by
[CONTACT_643349]-identifying information such as age, race, or ethnicity .
Samples will not be sold for profit. If results of tests performed on the specimens are ever published in
the medical literature, no identifying information will be included. The results of the tests performed for
research purposes will not be placed in the medical record. A copy of the consent form will not be
placed in the medical record. In this manner it will be unlikely that others within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], an
insurance company or employer would ever learn of such results.
Risks of the medications to be given in this study are low when eligibility criteria are met, as described
below:
Norethindrone acetate is a synthetic hormone, which will be given to subjects at physiological doses.
Thus, we do not anticipate adverse events associated with use of the medication. In the numerous
studies of adult women with endometriosis to whom norethindrone acetate was given, no significant
adverse events were reported. Side effects could include: weight changes, edema, acne, headache, or
change in mood. We will assess for these side effects with repeated physical examinations and the self-
administered assessments, the SF-36, Beck Depression Inventory, the pain measures, and the MRS.
The safety of cabergoline has been evaluated in approximately 1,200 patients with Parkinson’ s disease
in controlled and uncontrolled studies at dosages of up to 11.5 mg/day which greatly exceeds the
maximum recommended dosage of cabergoline for hyperprolactinemic disorders, and the dosage used
in the proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. When used in similar populations of reproductive aged women for other
indications, at doses identical to those proposed in the current study , cabergoline side effects include: GI
distress (constipation, pain), dizziness, headache, tingling, or swelling of the extremities. In addition to
the adverse events that occurred in the patients with hyperprolactinemic disorders, the most common
adverse events in patients with Parkinson’s disease (and treated with doses of ~3 mg/day) were
dyskinesia, hallucinations, confusion, and peripheral edema. Heart failure, pleural ef fusion, pulmonary
fibrosis, and gastric or duodenal ulcer occurred rarely. Postmarketing cases of cardiac valvulopathy
have been reported in patients receiving cabergoline. These cases have generally occurred during
administration of high doses of cabergoline (>2mg/day) for the treatment of Parkinson’ s disease. 
No significantly increased risk of clinically relevant cardiac valve disorders was found in subjects treated
with long-term cabergoline therapy at the doses used in endocrine practice. Current expert
recommendations state that patients prescribed cabergoline should be screened by a clinical
cardiovascular examination and that echocardiogram should be reserved for those patients with an
audible murmur, those treated for more than 5 years at a dose of more than 3 mg per week, or those
who maintain cabergoline treatment after the age of 50 years.
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) has been found to be abnormally increased in association with
pleural effusion/fibrosis. We will utilize a measurement of ESR at each study visit to screen for the very
unlikely development of a fibrotic disorder associated with low-dose cabergoline use. If we find that the
ESR increases to abnormal levels, a clinical evaluation would be indicated, including a chest x-ray .
Serum creatinine measurements can also be used to help in the diagnosis of fibrotic disorder , and will
be checked at each visit.

upon animal reproductive studies, and is approved for use during pregnancy "if needed". For these
reasons, a pregnancy test will be performed at each visit. Women who become pregnant during the
study would be terminated from further study participation. For this reason, participants taking the drug
should not become pregnant. To be a part of the research, participants will be advised that they must not
have sexual intercourse or must use reliable, effective birth control during participation. 
During research visits, participants may be asked questions that lead to feelings of discomfort,
emotional upset, or frustration. Participants will be advised that they may not be able to answer all the
questions and do not need to answer any questions that they do not wish to answer . If the participant
were to become distressed, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_643310] . We
will offer to have the participant speak to a mental health professional regarding her feelings. The Beck
Depression Inventory-II will be scored by [CONTACT_643351], while the
participant is still present. It is possible that the study team could identify concerns for depression from
the answers to the questionnaires. If the participant has a score ≥ 20 (indicating moderate or severe
depression) or responds anything other than 0 to Item 9 (I don’t have any thoughts of killing myself), the
Research Coordinator will alert the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_97318] . The study team will notify the
participant regarding our findings from the Depression Inventory , and encourage the participant to allow
us to share the information with her parent (if she is age<18 years) or her healthcare provider .
Additionally, mental health resources will be made available to the participant. Participants are informed
within the consent form that “If, during your participation in this research, there is reason to believe that
you are at risk for being suicidal or otherwise harming yourself or others, the research team is required

2 * What is the likelihood and seriousness of such risks?
The likelihood of such risks is low, and no serious risks are anticipated.
3 * Describe provisions for minimizing risks to participants.
Subjects are monitored closely throughout the course of participation by [CONTACT_643353], and
with their clinical care gynecology provider. 
At the baseline study visit, we will measure blood samples for total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and
triglyceride levels. This lipid profile will allow us to monitor for any individual changes in serum lipi[INVESTIGATOR_643312], and for differences between treatment groups. In some studies of adult women, mildly
deleterious effects on circulating lipid profiles have been seen in patients receiving treatment with
norethindrone acetate (decreased HDL). Lipid profiles will be repeated at follow-up visits scheduled for 3
and 6 months after initiation of therapy. Blood samples will also be taken for liver function tests (AST,
ALT) at each visit to allow us to monitor for any liver inflammation associated with the drug therapy.
HbA1c will be taken at baseline and at 6 months to monitor for impairments in glucose metabolism. W e
will utilize a measurement of ESR and serum creatinine at each study visit to screen for the very unlikely
development of a fibrotic disorder associated with low-dose cabergoline use. A physical examination will
be performed at each visit to assess for acne, and cardiac auscultation will be done to assess for the
presence of a cardiac murmur. The presence or absence of hormonal symptoms (mood changes, breast
tenderness, acne, and changes in menstrual bleeding patterns) will be queried at each visit. The
hormonal milieu will be assessed using serum measurements of estradiol and prolactin at baseline and
each subsequent study visit. These laboratory studies will allow us to monitor cabergoline activity , and to
determine compliance with cabergoline treatment in Group 2. If any cardiac murmur is identified during
study participation, an echocardiogram will be performed. 
Subjects will be discontinued from further study participation if any of the conditions that are listed as
exclusion criteria for participation develop during the six months of active participation in the study .
Because of the potential risk of adverse side effects, patients in the treatment trial will be monitored
closely during the 6-month study period with laboratory assessments and physical examinations every
three months. 
Study participants will be able to contact [CONTACT_643354]. No confidential information from this study or other data within a patient’s medical record may be
furnished to anyone unaffiliated with Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_643313], except as required by
[CONTACT_643355] (e.g., FDA).
All participants will be advised to abstain from sexual intercourse, or to use reliable birth control to
prevent pregnancy. A pregnancy test will be performed at each of the 3 study visits.

share with their primary care provider, including monitoring of lipid panels, liver function, and
hormonal status.
5 * Describe how the research may result in knowledge expected to benefit society .
With the information gathered from the proposed study, we hope to develop evidence-based
guidelines for the utilization of norethindrone acetate and/or cabergoline for treatment of endometriosis.
This study has the potential to benefit a large number of patients who suf fer from endometriosis.
 
Pediatric Risk/Benefit Determination
All protocols that include children/adolescents must be classified into a risk/benefit category .
Does your study involve more than one risk/benefit category for dif ferent groups? If so, answer
questions 1, 1.1, 1.[ADDRESS_860998] favorable risk/benefit scenario, and use the
questions 2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 to explain the risk/benefit assessment for the other groups of subjects in
your study.
“Minimal risk” means that the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the
research are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during
the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests.
1* Check the category below that best represents the degree of risk and benefit which children in this
study will be exposed to. If your study involves more than one group of subjects ( eg. .experimental
and placebo groups) consider whether the research presents a different risk/benefit assessment for
each group. If this is the case select the least favorable risk/benefit ratio that might apply to any of the
subjects. 
For example, a study may present  greater than minimal risk with potential for direct benefit for  an
experimental group, but no potential for direct benefit for a placebo group. In this case you should
select  “Greater than Minimal Risk; No Potential for Direct Benefit” in this section and use section 2
below to describe the risks and benefits for the group for which there a potential for benefit.

about the subject’s condition
1.1If Greater than Minimal Risk; Potential for Direct Benefit
1.1.1How is the risk justified by [CONTACT_213087]?
The medications used will be provided to the patient at no cost, and will potentially ameliorate
ongoing endometriosis-associated pain. Participants will be given information about their results
to share with their primary care provider, including monitoring of lipid panels, liver function, and
hormonal status. Both medications are commonly used in the reproductive-aged group of
females that we are recruiting for the current study.
1.1.2How is the benefit to risk assessment at least as favorable as presented by [CONTACT_643356]?
No patient is denied treatment, or receives only placebo therapy . We are recruiting patients
who remain in pain from their endometriosis with the hope of identifying a novel therapy to
ameliorate symptoms. The two medications are frequently used within this age group.
1.2If Greater than Minimal Risk; No Potential for Direct Benefit 
1.2.1How is the risk of the protocol a minor increase over minimal risk?
1.2.2 How do the procedures present experiences to the subjects that are reasonably
commensurate with those inherent in the subjects’ actual or expected situations? 
1.2.3 How is knowledge to be gained of vital importance for the understanding or amelioration
of the condition?
1.2.4 Can the consent of both parents be obtained if reasonably available?
1.3To which group of subjects does this risk/benefit assessment apply?
All subjects 15-40 years of age who will be recruited for study participation.

Non-Genetic Incidental Findings and Dissemination of Research Results
Non-Genetic Incidental Findings  
This section addresses incidental findings that are not genetic. Genetic incidental findings and return of genetic
results are addressed in the “Genetic Research Results” section.
1* Is there a possibility of clinically significant non-genetic incidental findings being discovered during the
research study?  These may include the unexpected discovery of abnormal results following an MRI of a
healthy control, or indications of subject depression following review of quality of life assessments etc. This
should also be explained in the consent form.

used in studies of adolescents, and is validated for use in persons aged 13-[ADDRESS_861000] depression may be uncovered after review of these assessments.
It is also possible that a previously unidentified cardiac murmur will be identified during the study .
1.2Outline the plan for addressing non-genetic incidental findings (e.g., contact[CONTACT_643357]’s primary care provider, referral, etc.). 
This scale will be scored and screened at the time of the subjects’ study visits. Any subject who
reports a moderate level of depressive symptoms or higher (defined as a Beck Depression Index-II
score ≥20) or who circles a response other than “0” to question 9 (which addresses suicidal
ideation) will be referred to a mental health provider or their medical provider at the time of the
study visit according to standard clinical practice. 
If a cardiac murmur is identified, the patient will be notified. W e will also notify the patient's medical
provider with permission.

consent.
If YES, please respond to the following questions:
8.1 Describe the criteria and /procedures or measurements for evaluating the decisional status
of the now adult subject to determine whether they are capable of consenting on their own
behalf. This would include the use of standardized measurements, consults with another
qualified professional, etc.
8.2Describe how you will determine who is authorized to provide legally valid consent for the
now adult subject. This could include use of durable power of attorney for healthcare, a
legally appointed guardian (this must be a court-appointed induvidual), or the use of
surrogate consent as approved in IRB. Please include whether and how legal records
regarding authority will be obtained and reviewed by [CONTACT_5051].
 
8.3When possible if legally effective consent cannot be obtained from the now adult subject,
assent should be obtained. Please describe if you plan to obtain assent and provide criteria
used to evaluate the assent or dissent of the now adult sibject with decional impairment
 
9 * Regulations require that significant new findings developed during the course of the research, which
may relate to the subject's willingness to continue participation, be provided to the subject. Describe
how this requirement will be met.
If significant new findings develop, this information will be disseminated to all participants. The consent
forms will also be amended to reflect any change in the risk/benefit ratio of the study .

Placebo
1 * Briefly describe the placebo (drug, device, procedure, intervention, surgery , etc.) arm used in
the study. Provide a justification for use of the placebo, including the length of subject
participation in the placebo arm. Please justify why the study cannot be conducted without the
use of the placebo. Your justification should address whether outcomes are subjective and
how use of a placebo will address this issue, if applicable.
No subjects in the proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_643316]. Subjects will be randomized to
either receive norethindrone acetate (standard care) versus cabergoline (investigational drug). 
However, since the two medications are administered on a different frequency, a placebo will be used
to maintain blinding of drug assignment to both the investigators and the subject.
If a subject is randomized to norethindrone acetate, she will receive norethindrone acetate 5 mg
tablet by [CONTACT_34048] + one placebo pi[INVESTIGATOR_643317].
If a subject is randomized to cabergoline, she will receive one placebo pi[INVESTIGATOR_643318] +
cabergoline 0.5 mg tablet by [CONTACT_553234]. 
As a result, all subjects will take 1 pi[INVESTIGATOR_643319] 1 pi[INVESTIGATOR_643320] . This will allow both the patients
and investigators to remain blinded to group assignment.
2 * Describe any commonly used diagnostic/treatment approach(es) that will be withheld from
subjects assigned to the placebo arm of this study.  Will subjects be denied any type of
treatment or diagnostics that would be considered a current standard of care?
No subjects will receive only placebo. All subjects will receive active treatment. All subjects will
receive either the intervention medication or the standard of care.
3 * Summarize any risks to subjects in the placebo arm consequent to not receiving active
treatment for their disease or condition.
No subjects will receive only placebo. All subjects will receive active treatment.

Analysis of endometriotic lesions has demonstrated that a prerequisite for their formation and maintenance is the
development of an adequate blood supply. The regulation of this ‘‘endometriotic vasculature’’ involves well-established
pathways of angiogenesis, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) acting through the VEGF receptor 2
(VEGFR2). 
Cabergoline is a long-acting dopamine receptor agonist with a high af finity for D2 receptors, a Drd2-A. In animal models,
Drd2-A inhibit pathologic angiogenesis by [CONTACT_643366]2 signaling while maintaining an acceptable safety profile
and not interfering with the normal establishment and progression of pregnancy .
In a preliminary study that sought to evaluate the efficacy of Drd2-A in the treatment of peritoneal endometriosis in
humans, researchers found that Drd2-A led to tissue degeneration, which was supported by [CONTACT_100276]-regulation of
VEGF/VEGFR2, three proangiogenic cytokines (CCL2, RUNX1, and AGGF1) and plasminogen activator inhibitor (P AI)

Potential Drug Interactions:
Ergot-alkaloids, macrolide antibiotics, other dopamine agonists (phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthenes, or
metoclopramide)
Contraindications:

12Are there any known antidotes? Please describe.
In cases of overdose, symptoms of overdose would likely be those of over-stimulation of dopamine receptors. These
might include nausea, vomiting, gastric complaints, hypotension, or thought/perception disturbances (hallucinations),
nasal congestion and syncope.
General supportive measures should be undertaken to remove any unabsorbed drug and maintain blood pressure if
necessary. In addition, the administration of dopamine antagonist drug may be advisable.

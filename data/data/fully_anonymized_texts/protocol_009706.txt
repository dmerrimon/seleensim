1. Abstract  
a. Provide no more than a one page research abstract briefly stating the problem, the 
research hypothesis, and the importance of the research.  
 
Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a chronic inflammatory  skin dis ease clinically 
characterized by [CONTACT_248079] (Fostini et 
al., 2013; Pereira & Ständer, 2016) . There are no  FDA approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_248070]. 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_248071], calcineurin in hibitors, calcipotriol, 
and capsaicin, systemic corticosteroids, thalidomide, systemic immunomodulatory 
drugs such as methotrexate and cyclosporin, antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_248072], 
phototherapy and photochemotherapy are often tried with limited success and in 
some cases with unfavorable risk -benefit ratio (Qureshi et al., 2019) . Emerging 
reports are detailing the significant disease burden and unmet need in P N patients, 
with a prevalence estimate of 125,000 ambulatory visits per year in the [LOCATION_002]  
(Whang e t al., 2020) . 
Chronic pruritus of unknown origin (CPUO) is defined as itch lasting for more than 
6 weeks without underlying systemic or neuropathic et iologies (Kim et al., 2019) . 
CPUO presents on multiple segments of the body, and it is unrespons ive to 
emollients. CPUO encompasses patients without a characteristic primary 
dermatologic eruption and negative systemic workup. Currently, there is a poor 
understanding of the etiology of CPUO, with eosinophilia and immune dysregulation 
suggested to play  a role, but studies have been limited by [CONTACT_25211] (Kim et 
al., 2019; Patel et al., 2019) . CPUO pathophysiology is hypothesized to involve 
several neu roimmune mediators, including histamine, IL -31, substance P, and 
TRPV1 (Miranda et al., 2018).  
In this study, we would like to evaluate the safety and efficacy of abrocitinib, a Jak1 
inihibtor, as a treatment for PN and CPUO. We hypothesize application of abrocitinib 
will improve these conditions of chronic itch, ultimately leading to improved overa ll quality 
of life via blockade of key cytokines known to be associated with conditions of itch 
including IL -31.

 Primary Objective: To assess the efficacy of abrocitinib in reducing pruritus in patien ts 
with prurigo nodularis (PN) or chronic pruritus of unknown origin (CPUO) who are 
experiencing moderate to severe pruritus   
 
Secondary Objectives:  
 
• To evaluate the effect of abrocitinib in improving quality of life in patients with prurigo nod ularis or 
chronic pruritus of unknown origin who are experiencing moderate to severe pruritus   
• To evaluate the  safety and tolerability of abrocitinib in subjects wi th prurigo nodularis or chronic pruritus 
of unknown origin who are experiencing moderate to  severe p ruritus  
 
Exploratory Objectives:  
 
• To evaluate the correlation between abrocitinib responsiveness and comorbidities in prurigo nodularis and 
chronic prurit us of unknown origin  
• To evaluate the correlation between responsiveness to abrocitinib the rapy with skin and blood biomarkers 
of prurigo nodularis and chronic pruritus of unknown origin  
 
 
3. Background  (briefly describe  pre-clinical and clinical data, curre nt experience with 
proce dures, drug or device, and an y other relevant information to justify the research ) 
 
Jak1, the target of abrocitinib, plays a critical role in signaling of many cytokines. 
Relevant for this application, Jak1 is involved in the signal ing for IL -[ADDRESS_301554] been 
linked to chronic itch and prurigo nodularis (Campi[INVESTIGATOR_248073]., 2019; Ghoreschi et al., 
2009; Zhang et al., 2008) . Additionally, abrocitinib  has been shown to inhibit IL -22 
signaling in keratinocytes as well as various cytokine sig naling pa thways, including 
IFNα (Fetter et al., 2020; Silverberg et al., 2020) . 
As the etiology of PN and CPUO is unknown, and there are currently no FDA approved 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], it is extremely difficult to treat patients with PN and CPUO . Prior 
investigations have suggested roles f or aberrant keratinocyte signaling, neuronal 
dysregulation, and cutaneous inflammation (Hughes et al., 2020; Kowalski et  al., 2019; 
Zhong et al., 2019) . Targeted RT -qPCR and immunohistochemical staining have 
demonstrated dysregulation of select neurotrophi c factors and cytokines, but these 
results were inconsistent (Fukushi et al., 2011; Matsumura et al., 2015; Park et al.,  2011; 
Takada et al., 2013; Wong et al., 2020; Zhong et al., 2019) .  Similarly, previous studies 
have shown conflicting evidence of immu ne polarization (Fukushi et al., 2011; Park et 
al., 2011; Wong et al., 2020; Zhong et al., 2019) . 
In both CPUO and PN, there is evidence of involvement of IL -31 and Oncostatin -M 
(Kowalski et al., 2019; Salao et al., 2020); Sonkoly et al., 2006) . IL-31 sign als through 
binding the heterodimer receptor complex of Type -1 cytokine receptor IL -31RA and 
sub-unit OSMRb, which acti vates Jak1 for signal transduction (Zhang et al., 2008) . PN 
has been studied more extensively than CPUO, and these studies have identifie d Th1/2 
cytokine signatures as driving pSTAT6 and pSTAT3 nuclear localization in PN 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196] (Fukushi et al., 2011) . As explained previously, there is conflicting evidence 
of immune polarization in PN. Notably, STAT6 and STAT3 activation and subsequent

 nuclear localization is mediated by [CONTACT_248080]1 activation, which itself is mediated by 
[CONTACT_248081] (Seif et al., 2017) . 
Abrocitinib is made by [CONTACT_4618], Inc. and is currently in Phase 3 trials for treatment of 
atopic dermatitis. At present, there is evidence that 200mg taken orally as a single daily 
dose is effective at reducing atopic dermatitis and itch associa ted from this condition. 
The incidence of adverse events with abrocitinib is well characterized and known 
adverse events will be monitored  for during the course of this trial.  
 
 
4. Study Procedures  
a. Study design, including the sequence and timing of study procedures    
(distinguish research procedures from those that are part of routine care ). 
 
• Screening Visit  
• At the screening visit (Visit 1),  eligibility for the study will be confirmed. This will entail:  
o Physical examination: Examination of major body organs.  
o Vital sign s: Measurement of blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], bo dy 
temperature,  height and weight.  
o Tuberculosis assessment: tu berculosis tes ting will be performed where indicated 
and as required by [CONTACT_248082]. This can be a skin test or a blood test.  
o Blood collection : The total amount of blood to be taken in this study for each 
participant is approximately 130mL (abou t 9 tablespoon s). These samples will be 
used to test:  
 Complete Blood count,  biochemistry  (tests of kidney, thyroid and liver 
function) .  
 IgE (immunoglobulin E) marker  of inflammatory disorders  
 Hepatitis B and C test.  The law requires us to report po sitive tests to 
the health department.   This reporting will include informati on that 
identifies you (for example name, date of birth, home address, phone 
number, etc.) as required by [CONTACT_248083].   The health department 
may use this information to contact [CONTACT_248084]/or to 
help conduct health surveillance activiti es aimed at preventing or 
controlling diseases.  
 HIV screening test. You may be asked to sign a separate State of 
Maryland c onsent form for this HIV test.  If the HIV test is posit ive it 
does not always mean you are infected with the HIV virus.  It does 
mean you will need further testing and you will receive counseling 
about this.  The law requires us to report positive tests t o the health 
department.   This reporting will include in formati on that identifies you 
(for example name, date of birth, home address,  phone number, etc.) as 
required by [CONTACT_248083].   The health department may use this 
information to contact [CONTACT_248085] r follow up and/or to help conduct 
health surveillance a ctiviti es aimed at preventing or controlling 
diseases.

6. Drugs/ Substances/ Devices  
a. The rationale for choosin g the drug and dose or for choosing the device to be 
used.  
 
 
Drugs:  
 
Abrocitinib 200mg ora l tablet – This drug is a study drug that was selected due to its 
targeting of the Jak1 pathway. 200mg is the dose that has been through Phase 3 trials 
for treatment of atopic dermatitis and there is significant data available regarding the 
safety and avai lability of t he drug at this dose.  
 
Tuberculin [COMPANY_003] – This drug is used as part of a tuberculin [COMPANY_003] test as performed by 
[CONTACT_44579] .1mL of purified tuberculin [COMPANY_003] subcutaneously in the skin. This is the 
standard dosing for a test to determine if a patient i s infected wi th Mycob acterium 
tuberculosis.  
 
Lidocaine /epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]  – 3 mL injection at the biopsy site. Lidocaine -HCL 1% w/ 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (1:100,000)  
 
 
b. Justification and safety information if FDA approved drugs will be administered 
for non -FDA approved indications or if doses or routes of administration or 
participant  populations are changed.  
 
 
N/A 
 
 
c. Justification and safety information if non -FDA approved drugs without an IND 
will be administered.  
 
 
N/A An IND has been given approval to proceed.  
 
 
7. Study Statistics  
a. Prima ry outcome variable . 
Percent PP -NRS reduction between baseli ne and week 12.  
 
b. Secondary outcome variables . 
 
Analysis of PN-IGA, PROMIS Itch Ques tionnaire, PAS, 5D Pr uritus Score, DLQI, 
HADS, and EQ -5D and detect differences between baseline through Week 12 . An 
ordinal regression will be used because these are non -parametric, ordinal scales.

Version 4 Dated:   01/[ADDRESS_301580] subsequent analyses of 
treatmen t efficacy. We will treat a p -value of <0.05 as statistically s ignificant, and all 
tests will be two -tailed. For the primary endpoint, ANOVA will  be used to analyze 
differences in percent PP -NRS reduction (baseline and week 12) with the inclusion of 
other covariates. We will use a Least -Square means to account for mis sing data or 
unbalanced design. We will conduct a two -way analysis of the response  variable (PP -
NRS per cent reduction) by [CONTACT_248091]: specifically, whether the patient 
has PN or C PUO, and week of treatment. We can derive all LS -means differen ces 
from every permutation of week or diagnosis, relative to Week 0 (baseline, pri or to 
treatment). We will incorporate a 95% confidence limit for a significant difference in 
LS-mean difference  between the control group and other groups.  
 
Unlike the primar y efficacy endpoint, the secondary endpoints do not have explicit, 
clinically mean ingful changes outlin ed in the literature. As such, we will look for 
significant downregulation in itch assessm ents, and significant improvements in 
quality of life and sleep  measures.  
 
Secondary aims will be analyzed using appropriate statistical tests a s outlined below, 
and missing data will be corrected with Multiple Imputation (MI) and we will assume 
that miss ing data is Missing at Random (MAR).  
 
For secondary analyses, a  multivariable logistic regression will be used to calculate 
the odds ratios of di fferent study arms (P N and CPUO) achieving a [ADDRESS_301581] differences between baseline through Week 12, 
an ordinal reg ression will be used because these are non -parametric, ordinal scales.  
 
IgA for PN is not validated in the US,  so we are using it as an additional secondary 
efficacy measure . Appendix D has a simplified version we are applying to this study. 
Eczema and ps oriasis IgA are simil arly qualitative. Analysis of PN/CPUO  IgA will 
be an ordinal scale based on qualitative s caling determined at the site visit. We will 
analyze IgA with a n ordinal regression, same as other scales mentioned above.  
 
Atopy will be defined  as a binary variable  where patients have 2 out of 3: underlying 
history of atopic dermatitis, history of seaso nal allergies, or asthma.  
Among PN patients taking 200 mg of ab rocitinib, we will use a linear regression to 
compare PP -NRS reduction from baseli ne with week 12, amon g PN patients with 
atopy and PN patients without atopy.

8. Risks  
a. Medical risks, listing all procedu res, their major and minor risks and expected frequency.  
 
 
Foreseeable and known risks of study drug  
There is a risk that participants  might experience disco mfort or side effects with the use of the study drug or 
procedures. Some of them are still unknown at this stage. In some cases, side effects can be seri ous, long -
lasting, permanent, or life -threatening . The study doctor is trained to take the appropriate measures to 
reduce risks and limit any discomforts you may experience.    
 
Side Effects:  
o The most c ommonly reported side effects are:  
 Nausea (1 in 7 peop le) 
 Nasopharyngitis (1 in 8 people)  
 Headache (1 in 25 people)  
o Rare but serious side e ffects include:  
 Serious infection (less than 1 in 100 people)  
 Vomiting (1 in 85 people)  
 Decreased platelet counts (1 in 75 people)  
o  
 
 
Skin Biopsy  
• Small risk of bleeding  
• A scar may form, but is likely to fade over time  
• All procedures have a small risk of in fection  
 
Blood D raw 
Taking blood may cause discomfort, bleeding, or bruising where the needle enters the 
body. In rar e cases, it may result in fainting. There is a small risk of infection.  
 
Interviews or questionnaires  
Participants  may get tired or bored when we are aski ng you questions or they are 
completing questionnaires. Participants  do not have to answer any questi on they do not 
want to answer.  
 
Identifiable private information  
There is the risk that information about about par ticipants  may become known to people 
outside this study.

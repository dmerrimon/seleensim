       Version Date: 8/30/2023 1 BACKGROUND 
1.1 Brain Metastases: Epi[INVESTIGATOR_218100] 30 to 
40% of cancer patients.1-[ADDRESS_262001], tumor histology, and tumor-related hemorrhage.2 In general, prognosis after 
diagnosis of brain metastasis is poor; however , longer survival is now being observed with 
improved systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_218101].2,3,5,8,9 Favorable prognostic factors include young age (<60 years), good 
performance status, female gender, solitary meta stasis, absence of neurologic symptoms, and 
well-controlled primary disease with absence of metastasis outside the central nervous 
system.2,3,10,11 
 
1.2 Treatment Paradigm 
 
Management is influenced by [CONTACT_77431], location, and volume of brain metastases, as well as 
tumor histology, molecular markers, and recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) or graded 
prognostic assessment (GPA).1,[ADDRESS_262002] been investigated for 
treatment of one to four brain metastases in clude surgery alone, whole- brain radiation therapy 
(WBRT) alone, WBRT followed by [CONTACT_44850], surgery followed by [CONTACT_218116], and surgery followed by 
[CONTACT_218117].1,5,[ADDRESS_262003], as well as an overall survival benefit in patients with more favorable prognosis (favorable 
GPA, RPA Class 1, or solitary metastasis).5,6,11,14,15  
 
Due to concerns related to cognitive decline and  quality of life measures with WBRT, studies on 
the use of SRS alone for a limited number of brain metastases ensued.5,6,11 These studies 
consistently reported superior local control and  distant brain control with SRS plus WBRT 
compared to SRS alone, although conclusions related to overall survival were variable.5,6,11,16-20 
Aoyama et al. reported an overall survival benefi t using SRS with WBRT only in those with higher 
GPA scores, while Chang et al. reported a superior overall survival with SRS alone.5,17,18 Kocher 
et al., Brown et al., and Churilla et al. reported no difference in overall survival with the addition of WBRT.
19,21,22 A meta-analysis by [CONTACT_218118]. concluded no difference in overall survival, while 
an individual patient-data meta- analysis by [CONTACT_218119]. concl uded that SRS alone provides a 
survival benefit for patients <[ADDRESS_262004] cancer.24

Lesions >[ADDRESS_262005] and neurologic 
symptoms.
6,13 Risk of recurrence at the resection cavity has been reported to be approximately 
50%; consequently, postoperative radiation in the form of WBRT or SRS is frequently used to 
sterilize the surgical bed.6,12,[ADDRESS_262006] that 
postoperative WBRT provides better intracranial local control than postoperative SRS for larger 
brain metastases but with no difference in OS.5,6 It should be noted that these comparisons are 
limited by [CONTACT_218120]; in addition, optimal dose/fractionation schemes for 
postoperative SRS have not yet been determined with certainty.6,7 
 
1.5 Toxicity 
 
Multiple studies report worsened cognitive decline and quality of life with the addition of WBRT to 
either SRS or surgery for a limited number of brain metastases.3,5,6,18,21,25 Given evidence for 
WBRT-related toxicity along with the lack of clear survival benefit with the addition of WBRT (and 
potentially a survival benefit with SRS alone in certain populations), the current trend for management of limited brain metastases now favors surgery (+/- postoperative SRS) or SRS 
alone with reservation of WBRT as a salvage option.
1,4-6,9,11 A number of studies are now 
evaluating the use of SRS in patients with multiple (more than four) brain metastases.3-5,8,11,26,27 
According to a recently published systematic review, SRS may be considered an option for 
patients with greater than four brain metastases provided the total tumor volume does not exceed 13 cc and no single metastasis is larger than 3 cc in volume.
1 While postoperative WBRT carries 
the cognitive and quality of life toxicities discussed above, SRS carries the risk of CNS necrosis 
(up to 23%).28,[ADDRESS_262007] of WBRT and expanding data on 
outcomes, specific patterns of CNS failure are becoming clearer. A number of studies report excellent local control rates with postoperative SRS (up to 83 to 94% at 24 months) but with 
distant intracranial failure rates of 40 to 60% within [ADDRESS_262008] is the incidence of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis in patients with solid 
tumors and brain metastases. Rates of leptomeningeal disease with solid tumors are reported to 
be in the range of 5 to 15%.  Risk factors for leptomeningeal involvement include breast cancer 
histology (particularly triple-negative receptor status and infiltrating lobular carcinoma), as well as 
non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma histologies.
31,32 Treatment options at the time of 
leptomeningeal failure typi[INVESTIGATOR_218102], intrathecal chemotherapy, and/or systemic 
chemotherapy depending on histology.9,32 Prognosis with leptomeningeal metastasis is poor, with 
reported survival in the range of two to six months.9,16,31,32 
 
Neurosurgical risk factors for leptomeningeal ca rcinomatosis include pi[INVESTIGATOR_218103], 
opening of the ventricular system, and infratentorial lesions.31,33 In the setting of up-front surgery, 
the hypothesis is that any anatomic disruption that  allows cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) contamination 
with tumor cells may predispose for leptomeningeal spread.9,29-31,34 Although postoperative SRS 
 
 
Study Short Title: GK-SRS-Brain Metastases  14  Version No.:  
       Version Date: 8/30/[ADDRESS_262009] seeded the CSF. Currently reported rates of leptomeningeal failure after surgery with 
postoperative SRS for brain metastases are in the range of 8 to 24%.
33 
 
In 2016, Johnson et al. reported significantly grea ter incidence of leptomeningeal metastasis with 
surgery followed by [CONTACT_218121] (16.9% vs. 5.2%, p<.01).[ADDRESS_262010] by [CONTACT_218122]. describes a “nodular” pattern of leptomeningeal spread associated with surgery followed by 
[CONTACT_218123] “sugarcoa ted” pattern of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis 
described in other settings.29 The authors also reported more favorable survival with the nodular 
pattern and that SRS may be a feasible option for focal treatment of nodular leptomeningeal 
disease.29 Adjuvant WBRT may offset the risk of leptomeningeal disease some degree, although 
this does not address the entire volume of CSF circulation.9,32 
 
1.7 Study Rationale 
 
Given the increased risk of leptomeningeal failure with surgery followed by [CONTACT_218117], as well as the 
risk of radiation necrosis, new paradigms in therapy delivery and sequencing are being 
explored.29,33-35 Areas of investigation include optimization  of target volume, marginal expansion, 
multifractionation, timeliness of SRS after surgery, and delivery of SRS prior to surgical 
resection.33,34 In theory, advantages of preoperative SRS include better target delineation, 
sterilization of tumor cells prior to surgical disruption of the tumor, vascular supply, and CSF 
spaces, and resection of tissue that would otherwise be at risk of radiation necrosis.29,34,35  
 
In 2014, Asher et al. reported that the use of neoadjuvant SRS prior to surgery was both safe and 
effective (even for metastases >3 cm) with no reported leptomeningeal recurrences or radiation 
necrosis.34 More recently, Patel et al. performed a retrospective comparison of preoperative 
versus postoperative SRS and reported no difference in local control, distant brain failure, or 
overall survival. Furthermore, the authors reporte d significantly lower rates of leptomeningeal 
carcinomatosis and radiation necrosis with preoperative SRS.29,36  
 
Huff et al. recently published a protocol for a phase II prospective trial designed to compare outcomes using preoperative SRS versus historically cited outcomes for postoperative SRS.

Our current pi[INVESTIGATOR_218104], CNS progression-free survival, overall survival, rates of leptomeningeal spread, rates of 
radiation necrosis, and quality of life measures with the use of preoperative SRS.  
2 HYPOTHESIS, OBJECTIVES, AND ENDPOINTS 
Our hypothesis is that preoperative GK-SRS is feas ible and results in greater local control than 
postoperative radiosurgery to the resection cavity. 
2.1 Primary Objectives 
1. To assess feasibility of preoperative GK-SRS in patients with brain metastases treated 
with preoperative GK-SRS.   
2. To assess local control in patients with brain metastases treated with preoperative GK-
SRS.   
 
 
 
Study Short Title: GK-SRS-Brain Metastases  15  Version No.:  
       Version Date: 8/30/2023 2.2 Secondary Objective(s) 
1. To assess survival (CNS progression-free survival and overall survival) for patients 
undergoing preoperative SRS and surgical resection.  
2. To document rates of leptomeningeal carc inomatosis for patients undergoing preoperative 
SRS and surgical resection.  
3. To record incidence of radiation necro sis in patients undergoing preoperative GK-SRS 
and surgical resection.  
4. To document quality of life measures using preoperative GK-SRS and to compare to 
historically cited rates using postoperative GK-SRS.  
 
2.3 Primary Endpoint 
1. Feasibility for this study will be defined as 50% of enrolled study subjects undergoing the 
surgical resection as per the protocol. 
2. Measure rate of local control at the resection cavity any new tumors  by [CONTACT_447]-treatment 
MRI.  
 
2.4 Secondary Endpoint(s) 
1. CNS progression-free survival and overall survival will be evaluated at six, 12, and [ADDRESS_262011] pattern of surveillance (brain MRI every three 
months for two years).  
Quality of life will be assessed every three months, and neurocognitive evaluations will be 
performed every six months. These parameters will be compared to baseline testing performed 
at the time of enrollment. Local control, CNS progression-free survival, overall survival, rates of 
leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, rates of radiati on necrosis, and steroid requirements will also be 
documented and compared with historically reported rates.

x Selective consent withdrawal from interventional portion of the study but agree to 
continued follow-up of associated clinical outcome information. 
 
Investigator-initiated Withdrawal 
 
The investigator will withdraw a subject whenever continued participation is no longer in the 
subject’s best interests. Reasons for withdrawing a subject include, but are not limited to, disease 
progression, the occurrence of an adverse event or a concurrent illness, a subject’s request to 
end participation, a subject’s noncompliance or simply significant uncertainty on the part of the investigator that continued participation is prudent.  The reason for study withdrawal and the date

5.1.1 Stereotactic Radiosurgery 
  
SRS will be delivered utilizing Gamma Knife®. Target volume and isocenter determination will be 
based on a brain MRI with the patient’s head in the stereotactic frame or face mask. SRS will be 
delivered to each lesion that has not previously undergone treatment. Due to the volumetric 
summation constraint for the remaining metastases, no single, non-resected lesion greater than 
[ADDRESS_262024] dose to the target volume will be used such that constraints can be met. This will be 
considered a minor deviation. 
Possible Side Effects Related to Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) 
 
Common, Some May Be Serious 
In [ADDRESS_262025]:

resection criteria. One to 10 days after radiosurgery, the dominant lesion(s) will be maximally 
resected and labeled tissue will be sent to the neuropathology department for clinical diagnosis 
and radiobiological correlative studies. If for safety concern or other considerations, gross total 
resection is not reached, the residual disease in the setting of subtotal resection will be closely 
observed given that it has been treated with a def initive dose of SRS, reserving salvage local 
therapy for cases of progression.

REQUIREMENTS  
 
6.[ADDRESS_262032] a causal relationship with 
this treatment. (International Conference on Harmonisation [ICH], E2A, E6). 
 
This study will utilize the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0, located on the CTEP web site: 
 
https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  
 
AEs may be spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_5363]/or in response to an open question from study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination or other diagnostic procedures. 
 
6.1.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) means any untoward medical occurrence that results in any of the following outcomes: 
x Death.  Results in death. 
x Life-threatening . Is life-threatening (refers to an AE in which the patient was at risk of 
death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe). 
x Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_109577] (see clarification in the paragraph below on planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]). 
x Disability/incapacity . Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity. 
(Disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions). 
x Pregnancy  
x Medically important event . This refers to an AE that may not result in death, be 
immediately life threatening, or require hosp italization, but may be considered serious 
when, based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient, require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above, or involves 
suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent.  Examples of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse; any organism, 
virus, or infectious particle (e.g., pri on protein transmitting transmissible spongiform 
encephalopathy), pathogenic or nonpathogenic, is considered an infectious agent. 
 
 
 
Study Short Title: GK-SRS-Brain Metastases  25  Version No.:  
       Version Date: 8/30/2023 6.1.3 Attribution of an Adverse Event 
An assessment of the relationship between the adverse event and the medical intervention, using 
the following categories:  
 
Definitely Related : The AE is clearly related to the intervention . There is clear evidence to 
suggest a causal relationship, and other possible contributing factors can be ruled out.   
Probably Related:  The AE is likely related to the intervention. There is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship, and the influence of other factors is unlikely.  
 
Possibly Related: The AE may be related to the intervention. There is some evidence to suggest 
a causal relationship (e.g., the event occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the 
trial medication). However, the influence of other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., 
the subject’s clinical condition, other concomitant events).  
 
Unlikely:  The AE is doubtfully related to the intervention. A clinical event, including an abnormal 
laboratory test result, whose temporal relation ship to drug administration makes a causal 
relationship improbable (e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication) and in which other drugs or chemicals or underlying disease provides 
plausible explanations (e.g., the subject’s clinic al condition, other concomitant treatments).  
 
Unrelated: The AE is clearly NOT related to the intervention.  The AE is completely independent 
of study drug administration, and/or evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology.  
 
6.1.4 Expectedness of an Adverse Event 
 
Study investigator or treating physician will be responsible for determining whether an AE is 
expected or unexpected as indicated in the protocol, informed consent form and/or drug 
information brochure. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency 
of the event is NOT consistent with the risk information previously described for the study 
intervention. 
 6.2 Collection and Reporting Requirements for Adverse Events and Serious Adverse   
      Events 
 
6.2.1 Collection of Adverse Events 
 All grade 3, 4, and 5 adverse events (including all SAEs) must be recorded in OnCore
® and/or an 
adverse event log. All AEs required to be collected must be graded according to the CTCAE v5. 
When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology should be noted 
as one comprehensive event. Investigator’s or treating physician’s assessment of AE attributions 
must also be documented.  
 
AEs will be collected from the time the subject signs the consent form through [ADDRESS_262033] 
dose of study drug(s). AEs will be tracked and followed until resolution, subject withdraws 
consent, or is lost to follow-up (including subjects who discontinue early). All adverse events 
collected per the protocol will be followed with appropriate medical management until they are 
resolved, if they are related to the study treatment, or until the investigator deems the event to be 
chronic.  
 
 
Study Short Title: GK-SRS-Brain Metastases  26  Version No.:  
       Version Date: 8/30/2023 Please see section 6.2.2 and table 2 to identify the adverse events that need to be reported.  
 
 
6.2.2 Reporting of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Please refer to table 2 below to identify adverse  events that meet reporting requirements.  
 
All serious adverse events (SAEs) that occur after the subject has signed the consent form 
through [ADDRESS_262034] dose of study drug(s) will be reported. All SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution, or until the investigator deems the event to be chronic. 
 
All serious adverse events (SAEs) must also be documented in OnCore
®.

7 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
7.1 Power Calculations 
The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate feasibility. With about 10 patients, assuming 
a local control of rate of 85% (in line with observed local control rates in the literature in 2014, 
Asher et al. and 2016, Patel et al.), 34,36 we will be able to estimate a 95% confidence interval with 
width not exceeding 0.40, that is about 47% of the assumed 85% local control rate. 
 
7.2 Methodology of comparisons between groups 
Descriptive statistics, including means, medians, and ranges will be reported wherever 
appropriate. For the primary hypothesis, the estimated rates of local control and its 95% 
confidence interval using an exact binomial method will be computed. For the secondary 
objectives, appropriate Kaplan Meier progression-free survival estimates will be computed.  
 All calculations will be performed using the SAS and the R language for statistical computing. 
Unless explicitly mentioned, all analysis will use a type I error rate of 0.05 and 95% confidence 
intervals.

Informed Consent Process 
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in 
the study and continues throughout the individual’s study participation. Extensive discussion of 
risks and possible benefits of this therapy will be provided to the subjects and their families. Consent forms describing in detail the study interventions/products, study procedures and risks 
are given to the subject and written documentation of informed consent is required prior to starting 
intervention/administering study product.

       Version Date: 8/30/[ADDRESS_262042] (and legally authorized representative, if 
necessary) will be asked to read and review the document. The treating physician or the 
investigator will explain the research study to the subject and answer any questions that may arise. The study coordinator may complete the consenting process. In accordance with [ADDRESS_262043] will sign and date the informed consent document prior to any procedures 
being done specifically for the study.  
A witness should only sign when required, per FH/MCW IRB policy. If a witness signs the 
document when not required, the study staff should document in the legal medical record (or note to file) the relationship to the patient and why a witness signed. (i.e., “Although not required, the 
subject’s spouse was present during the consenting process and signed as the witness.” Or 
“Although not required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_182169] a 
witness.”) 
The subjects will have the opportunity to discuss the study with their surrogates or think about it 
prior to agreeing to participate. The subjects may withdraw consent at any time throughout the 
course of the trial.  
A copy of the informed consent document will be given to the subjects for their records. The rights 
and welfare of the subjects will be protected by [CONTACT_21223]. If there are 
changes to the consent form, all revisions will be reviewed with study subject at the next 
appropriate opportunity. Patients who require reconsenting will be defined in the IRB-approved amendment submission. The process for obtaining informed consent will again be performed. 
Study subjects will not be reconsented for continuing reviews. The MCWCC CTO will follow the 
MCW/FH IRB’s policy for subjects who demonstrate limited English proficiency or limited literacy.  
After the subject’s visit in which the consent is sig ned, it is documented in the clinic chart that the 
consent has been signed and that all questions have been answered to the subject’s satisfaction after adequate time for review of the consent. It is also documented that a copy of the consent 
was given to the subject. The original consent is kept with the subject’s study file, and a copy of 
the consent is sent to the OCRICC office, whic h will then submit to HIM a copy of the signed 
consent to be scanned into EPIC, the legal medical record. 
9.[ADDRESS_262044] Confidentiality and Access to Source Documents/Data  
Subject confidentiality is strictly held in trust by [CONTACT_456]-investigator, participating 
investigators, and any staff, and the sponsor. This confidentiality includes the clinical information 
relating to participating subjects, as well as any genetic or biological testing. 
The study protocol, documentation, data and all other information generated will be held in strict 
confidence. No information concerning the study, or the data will be released to any unauthorized 
third party without prior written approval of the principal investigator.

been processed correctly.  
10.2 Data Management Responsibilities 
10.2.1 Principal Investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_218110]/case report forms and 
ensures that a) complete and accurate data will be obtained and provided to the sponsor; b) 
patient records are maintained to include history,  prescribed medication and investigational 
product(s), measurements, exams, evaluations and adverse events; c) corrections are applied to 
clinical research data according to principles of good research practice (i.e., single-line delete, 
date and initial). He or she will ensure that there is correlation between the case report forms and 
the source documents .  
10.2.2 Research Coordinator   
A research coordinator creates, collects and organi zes clinical trial documentation. He or she 
ensures that source documentation and data abstraction and entry are being done at protocol 
specified time points.  
 
10.2.3 Research Nurse/Medical Staff  
The research nurse and medical staff documents pr otocol-required care or assessment of the 
subject’s outcomes, adverse events and compliance to study procedures. 
10.2.4 Biostatistician

(annotation of CRFs and record layout) and validation. 
10.3 Source Documents  
Source documents for clinical information (pati ent history, diagnosis, clinical and diagnostic test 
reports, etc.) are maintained in the patient’s clinical file.  
All source documents will be written following ALCOA standards:  
ALCOA Attribute Definition 
Attributable Clear who has documented the data. 
Legible Readable and signatures identifiable. 
Contemporaneous Documented in the correct time frame along with the flow of 
events. If a clinical observation cannot be entered when made, 
chronology should be recorded. Acceptable amount of delay 
should be defined and justified. 
Original  Original, if not original should be exact copy; the first record made 
by [CONTACT_218130]. The investigator should have the 
original source document. 
Accurate Accurate, consistent and real representation of facts. 
Enduring Long-lasting and durable. 
Available and 
accessible Easily available for review by [CONTACT_182203]/inspections. The documents should be retrievable in 
reasonable time. 
Complete Complete until that point in time. 
Consistent Demonstrate the required attributes consistently. 
Credible Based on real and reliable facts. 
Corroborated Data should be backed up by [CONTACT_12243]. 
 
10.4 Case Report Forms 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or his/her designee will prepare and maintain adequate and 
accurate participant case histories with observations and data pertinent to the study. Study-specific case report forms (CRFs) will document safety and treatment outcomes for safety 
monitoring and data analysis. All study data will be entered into OnCore
® via standardized CRFs, 
in accordance with the study calendar, using single data entry with a secure access account. The 
clinical research coordinator will complete the CRFs as soon as possible upon completion of the 
study visit; the investigator will review and approve the completed CRFs.  
The information collected on CRFs shall be identical to that appearing in original source 
documents. Source documents will be found in the patient’s medical records maintained by [CONTACT_182204]. All source documentation should be kept in separate research folders for each patient. 
In accordance with federal regulations, the investigator is responsible for the accuracy and 
authenticity of all clinical and laboratory data entered onto CRFs. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_218111]: GK-SRS-Brain Metastases  34  Version No.:  
       Version Date: 8/30/[ADDRESS_262051] that the information contained on the CRFs is true and 
accurate.  
All source documentation and data will be available for review/monitoring by [CONTACT_218131]. 
10.[ADDRESS_262052] all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation on everyone administered the investigational intervention or em ployed as a control in the investigation. Case 
histories include the case report forms and s upporting data including, for example, signed and 
dated consent forms and medical records including, for example, progress notes of the physician, 
the individual's hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3853](s), and the nurses' notes. The case history for each individual shall 
document that informed consent was obtained prior to participation in the study. 
Study documentation includes all CRFs, data correction forms or queries, source documents, 
sponsor-investigator correspondence, monitoring logs/letters, and regulatory documents (e.g., protocol and amendments, IRB correspondence and approval, signed patient consent forms). 
Source documents include all recordings of observati ons or notations of clinical activities and all 
reports and records necessary for the evaluation and reconstruction of the clinical research study.

†A new lesion is one that does not present on prior scans and is visible in a minimum of two 
projections. If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy 
can be considered, and follow-up assessment will clarify if the new lesion is new disease. If repeat 
scans con ¿rm there is de ¿nitely a new lesion, progression should be declared using the date of the 
initial scan showing the new lesion. For immunotherapy-based approaches, new lesions alone to 
do not de ¿ne progression. 
 
 ‡Increase in corticosteroids alone will not be tak en into account in determining progression in the 
absence of persistent clinical deterioration.

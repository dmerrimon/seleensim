Page 2 of 18 IRB APPLICATION  Version: 9/26/[ADDRESS_78052] is to assess adherence  with home blood pressure monitoring in hypertensive patients 
with a history of stroke  and to determine if a social incentive improves adherence  with monitoring.  Enrolled 
subjects stroke (Ischemic stroke, intraparenchymal hemorrhage, or high -risk TIA) and uncontrolled blood pressure, 
defined by [CONTACT_11557]>140 or DBP>90 mm Hg at the time of study screening .  To be eligible subjects will also be 
required to own a smart phone (iOS or Android operating system).  After enrollment, patie nts will be given a home 
blood pressure cuff with instructions to monitor their BP twice daily for 90 days.  Subjects will be randomly 
assigned to a social incentive program, in which a social supporter  receives updates via  email and/or  text 
message on the  subject ’s adherence with BP monitoring  and their average blood pressure .  This study will 
provide important pi[INVESTIGATOR_71969] g and blood pressure control in patients with a history of 
stroke.

and to determine if a social i ncentive improves adherence.   
1.2  Secondary Objective  
A secondary objective of this study is to determine if adherence with blood pressure monitoring is associated with 
change in blood pressure during the study period and to determine which individual factors are associated with 
adherence.

Page 3 of 18 IRB APPLICATION  Version: 9/26/[ADDRESS_78053], including blood pressure control, high dose statin 
therapy, smoking cessation, diet, and exercise. The goal of this proposal is to perform important preliminary work 
on the feasibility of connected health and behavioral /social  incentives to im prove blood pressure control in 
patients with TIA or stroke.    
 
Hypertension is by [CONTACT_71986], with 
a population attributable risk of 35 to 75% depending on the definition of hypertension used.[ADDRESS_78054] suboptimally controlled blood pressure levels , and prior  work  
suggests that stroke patients are even less likely to achieve target blood pressure  goals than patients with 
coronary artery disease .4  Importantly, t reatment to lowe r blood pressure reduces future stroke in those with and 
without a prior history of stroke.5-7  In a study of 227 ischemic stroke patients with sym ptomatic intr acranial 
stenosis and  a median follow -up of 32 months , 17% of subjects who achieved a systolic blood pressure of <140 
(or <130 for diabetics) had a recurrent stroke, MI, or vascular death, compared to 29% in patients who did not 
achieve goal blood pressure .8 All of these 227 patients were all enrolled in a clinical trial and were receiving 
protocol driven intensive medical therapy to optimize risk factor control.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], only 121 of 227 (53%) 
reached their goal blood pressure.   
 
Non-adherence to pre scribed medications has been proposed as one major reason for suboptimal blood pressure 
control.9   In one study of 4068 elderly subjects with hypertension, antihypertensive prescriptions were filled for 
only 49% of the prescribed medication days, and only  23% of subjects had good compliance (defined as taking > 
80% of their recommended medication regimen).9 Additionally, lack of insight into the benefit of aggressive blood 
pressure control, lack of awareness of actual blood pressure levels, and lack of effective strategies for triggering 
more intensive therapy for both patients and providers may all be impor tant.10   
 
One prior study compared  home blood pressure monitoring with intermittent nurse support to usual care in 
patients with recent stroke .11 At 12 month follow -up, more patients in the intervention group had changes to their 
antihypertensive therapy (60% vs. 48%, p=0.02), but there was no overall difference in change in mean systolic 
blood pressure from baseline to 12 month measurements.   This study was limited in that the incentive (nursing 
support) is relatively resource intensive, patient report wa s used to assess compliance rather than automated 
device recording, and blood pressure was checked infrequently (weekly).    
 
The proposed study builds on existing literature in several unique and important ways.  First, the blood pressure 
monitor used in this study is a commercially available unit that will interact with the subject ’s smart phone.  
Software that comes with the device will allow the subject to track their own blood pressure. Blood pressure will 
be checked more frequently (twice daily).  Fin ally, the incentive used in this study will provide real time feedback 
to the subject and to a social supporter  that they identify , in an effort to improve adherence.   
 
4.  CHARACTERISTICS OF THE STUDY POPULATION  
4.1  Target Population  
Adult subjects with  a history of acute ischemic stroke , intraparenchymal hemorrhage,  or high risk transient

Page 6 of 18 IRB APPLICATION  Version: 9/26/[ADDRESS_78062] a follow -up phone call at 48-72 hours after enrollment and  either a phone or computer 
based encounter  30 days +/ - 3 days after enrollment  and an in -person visit at 90 days +/ -7 days.  Participation will 
be completed after the day 90 visit.    
5.  STUDY DESIGN  
5.1  Phase  
Phase 2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251].   
5.2  Design  
This is a single center randomized trial designed to assess the effectiveness of a social intervention to improve 
adherence with home blood pressure monitoring.  Computer -based block randomization (block size=4) will be 
used to maintain relatively equal numbers of subjects in both arms of the study.  This study will provide important 
preliminary data for future studies, which  will use behavioral incentives to improve adherence to home blood 
pressure monitoring and titration of antihypertensive therapy.   
5.3  Study Duration  
Individual subjects will be in the study for a total of 90 days. They will receive a telephone call at 48 hours and 
either a computer based or telephone based interview at 30+/- [ADDRESS_78063] an in -person visit at 
90+/-[ADDRESS_78064] 
patient is enrolled.  Data collection  and analysis will be completed in the subsequent 6 months for total study 
duration of 24 months.     
 
6. DRUGS OR DEVICES   
 
All patients will receive a Withings wireless blood pressure monitor.  This commercially 
available device measures heart rate and blood pressure.  The device is operated by 
[CONTACT_71988] (Apple iPhone 3 GS and 
newer, Android 4.0 and newer)  via bluetooth .  Blood pressure and heart rate readings 
will be automatically uploaded to Penn’s Way to Health  platform via the subject ’s smart 
phone.  There are no risks associated with this device.  All subjects will be instructed 
on the proper use of the device as well as best practices  for measuring blood pressure at the time of study 
enrollment.

Page 7 of 18 IRB APPLICATION  Version: 9/26/[ADDRESS_78065] data from 
wireless devices.  Blood pressure and heart rate data will be collected and stored in a secure, HIPAA complaint 
format.  The platform will provide automatic reminders for all patients  to use the blood pressure cuff twice daily.  
Additionally, the platform will automatically apply the social incentive to randomized subjects.  The social incentive 
is described in more detail later  (section 7.1) .   
 
7.  STUDY PROCEDURES  
7.1  ENROLLMENT  
At the time of enrollment the following data will be collected: Age, sex, race, ethnicity, handedness (left arm 
dominate, right arm dominate), date of stroke, etiology of stroke (large vesse l disease, small vessel disease, 
cardioembolic, other defined etiology, cryptogenic), past medical history (including prior history of: hypertension,  
diabetes, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, 
coronary artery disease and/or my ocardial infarction, chronic kidney 
disease, peripheral artery disease, stroke prior to the enrolling event, and 
other), current medications, smoking history (current, former, never 
smoker), employment status (currently employed, disabled, retired), living  
situation (lives alone yes/no, if no, number of people and relationship of 
people living in the home), annual household income (<$20,000, $20,000 -
39,999, $40,000 -64,999, $65,000 -104,999, $105,000+), insurance status 
(private health insurance, medicare, me dicaid, none), primary care 
provider (yes/no), cardiologist (yes/no) , nephrologist (yes/no) .  We will also obtain contact [CONTACT_61183] -
up phone calls and for scheduling the [ADDRESS_78066] 
reimbursement purposes.  
Study Measurements at enrollment  
1. Upper arm circumference.  Measured using a tape measure in the mid -portion of the upper arm.  
Circumference  <9” or  >17” is an exclusion criteria.   
 
2. Mini-Mental Status Examination  (MMSE) – the MMSE is a brief, standardized cognitive assessment . 
Subjects will be excluded if they score ≤ 20 on the MMSE, which corresponds to moderate or severe 
dementia.  
2.  Modified Rankin Scale (mRS).  The mRS is a 5 point scale which 
ranges from no  disability to severe disability  (figure 1) .  It is assessed 
using a brief, structured interview.  Study personnel will be trained and 
certified in the use of the mRS.  Subjects with mRS >2 are excluded.  
 
3.  National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS).  The NIHSS is a 
brief, structured neurologic examination, designed to assess deficits 
from stroke  (figure 2) .  Study personnel will be trained and certified in 
the use of the NIHSS.   
 
4.  Heart Rate and blood pressure – Heart rate and blood pressure will 
be measured at least [ADDRESS_78067] 5 minutes before blood pressure is checked.  
The patient will be asked to sit in a chair  with their back straight and 
supported and their feet flat on the floor.  The arm will be supported on 
a flat surface at approximately the level of the heart.  Blood pressure  
and heart rate will be assessed in the non -dominate arm  using a n Modified Rankin Scale  
0 – No symptoms  
1 – No disability; able to carry out all  
      previous activities despi[INVESTIGATOR_61158]  
2 – Slight disability; unable to carry out all previous activities  
      but able to look after own affairs  
3 – Moderate disability; requires some help but able to walk  
      unassisted  
4 – Moderately severe disability; unable to attend to own  
      bodily needs and unable to walk unassisted.  
5 – Severe disability; requires constant nur sing care and  
      attention, bedri dden.

BP twice daily, once between 6:00am -11:59am and once between 4:00pm -9:59pm.    Finally, patients will be 
enrolled onto the Way to Health platform and will choose whether they prefer to receive study communications via 
email or text message . The  subject will also be given a telephone number that they may call if they encounter any 
technical difficulties with the Withings device.   
 
Connected Health Monitoring  
The Withings blood pressure cuff provides the subject with a graphical display of their blood pressure after it is 
measured  as well as prior blood pressure readings.  Blood pressu re readings are color coded to indicate Normal 
blood pressure, mild, moderate, and severe hypertension.  BP readings will be automatically uploaded form the 
subject’s  device to Way to Health.  If subjects have not completed their morning BP check by 11:00a m they will 
receive a reminder via their chosen form of communication (email or text).  In the evening they will receive a 
reminder if they have not checked their BP by 9:00pm.  In addition to the standard feedback provided within the 
Withings app, subject s will receive automated feedback from the Way to Health platform on a weekly basis.  Th is 
message w ill contain the subject’s  mean blood pressure over the preceding [ADDRESS_78069]’s  blood pressure is above or below  a goal of <140/90 mm Hg  and will report their compliance 
with scheduled BP checks .   
 
 
Social Incentive  
Patients will be randomly assigned (1:1) to either receive a social incentive or not. The social incentive will require  
the subject to identify  a social supporter .  This individual can be a family member, friend, or other community 
member  selected by [CONTACT_423].  The social supporter will need to assent to the study and register on the Way to 
Health platform.  The social supporter w ill receive educ ation on  the importance of hypertension, how to measure 
blood pressure, and how to operate the Withings monitor.  If the social supporter is not present at the time of 
subject enrollment, they may assent to the study via telephone and /or by [CONTACT_71989].  In this scenario they will receive education via telephone and/or online.    
 
The social supporter will choose whether they prefer to receive study communications  via text message or email.  
The social supporter will rec eive a text or email message alert at 11:00am if the subject has not completed their 
morning BP reading and at 9:00pm if the subject has not completed their evening BP reading.  The social 
supporter will also receive feedback on the subject’s BP control fr om the Way to Health platform on a weekly 
basis.  This message will summarize the subject’s adherence to home monitoring in the preceding [ADDRESS_78070]’s mean BP over the preceding [ADDRESS_78071]’s BP is abo ve or 
below a goal of <!40/[ADDRESS_78072] in order to improve both adherence and BP control  
 
Non-adherence  
BP readings will be automatically uploaded  from the subjec t’s smartphone to the Way to Health platform.  If the 
subject goes [ADDRESS_78073] by [CONTACT_71990]: Connected Health Blood Pressure Monitoring in Stroke Patients

final analytic dataset but be considered “non -adherent” for the remaining study days (further details  in section 8).    
 
 
7.2 48 Hour Follow -up Phone Call  
Enrolled subjects will be contact[CONTACT_6811] 48 hours +/ - [ADDRESS_78075] wi ll be offered 
an additional in -person visit to trouble shoot the device and/or repeat device training.  The subject will also be 
screened for adverse events  during this telephone call.   
 
7.3 30 Day  Interview  
Enrolled subjects will be contact[CONTACT_6811] 30 days +/ - 3 days after enrollment via electronic messaging (text message 
and/or email).  The subject will be asked to log into Way to Health and complete a short form.  This form will 
screen for adverse ev ents and  collect [ADDRESS_78076] to Health and will not need to be assessed 
over the telephone.  Secondary outcomes  assessed will i nclude:  
 
 TIA or stroke since enrollment  
 Number of physician visits since enrollment (Primary care, cardiology, other)  
 Number of emergency  department visits since enrollment and reason for each visit  
 Number of changes in antihypertensive medications since e nrollment (dose adjustment and/or addition of 
a new agent)  
 Patients perception of blood pressure monitoring device and study protocol ease of use ( very difficult , 
moderately difficult, mildly difficult, easy to use)  
 Patients perception of the utility of bl ood pressure monitoring (very useful, moderately useful, mildly useful, 
not useful)  
 Patients perception of blood pressure control ( adequately controlled, not adequately controlled)  
 
Subjects who do not complete the online form will be contact[CONTACT_71991].

8.  STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
Demographics and past medical history variables will be summarized for all subjects using means or medians as 
appropriate for continuous variables and proportions for categorical variables.  We will compare the two study 
arms using Student’s t -test or Wi lcoxon rank sum as appropriate for continuous variables and χ2 test for 
categorical variables.   
 
The primary outcome measure is adherence with blood pressure monitoring during the study period.  Adherence 
will be defined by [CONTACT_71992] (numerator) by [CONTACT_71993] (denominator).  The expected number of BP measurements is the number of days 
that the subject is in the study m ultiplied by 2.  Most subjects will be enrolled in the study for 90 days and will 
therefore be expected to check their BP 180 times.  Adherence in this case is the number of completed BP 
measurements divided by 180.  The 90 -day follow -up visit has a window  of +- 7 days, so for subjects that 
complete the study protocol the denominator will be adjusted accordingly.  Subjects whom withdrawal from the 
study and/or stop monitoring  their BP before the [ADDRESS_78080] 75 days of the 
study and then ceases all BP measure ments, adherence will be calculated as 60/180=33.3%.  After adherence 
has been calculated for all subjects we will evaluate the distribution of adherence for normality and compare 
adherence between the two study arms using Student’s t -test or Wilcoxon rank  sum as appropriate.  A sample 
size of 90 will give us 80% power to detect a 30% difference between groups with α=0.05.

Page 11 of 18 IRB APPLICATION  Version: 9/26/[ADDRESS_78081].  The average change in blood pressure will be compared between 
study arms using Student’s t -test or Wilcoxon rank sum as app ropriate.  We will also compare the proportion of 
subjects with an average blood pressure <140/[ADDRESS_78082] a sensitivity analysis in which we impute a change in BP for subjects with less 
than 14 days of monitoring of zero.   
 
We will compare secondary outcomes across study arms including number of calls to the study team, number of 
physician visits, number of emergency department visits, number of changes in antihypertensive medications, and 
the patient perception of : study protocol, utility of blood pressure monitoring, and blood pressure control.  We will 
also determine the relationship between adherence to blood pressure monitoring and change in blood pressure 
during the study period.   For this analysis, we will first determine the average adherence in the study population.  
We will compare the change in blood pressure in those with above average adherence to those with below 
average adherence.   This will be done in the full study population and then stratified by [CONTACT_30157].  In an 
exploratory analysis multivariable regression will be utilized to determine which factors were associated with a 
high level of adherence to the study protocol , define d as adherence above the study median.  We will investigate 
the following variables in a univariate analysis: age, sex, race, ethnicity, income, social support in the home, 
employment status, MMSE score, NIHSS, and modified Rankin Scale. Variables in the u nivariate analysis with

10.[ADDRESS_78087] imp ortant modifiable risk factor for 
stroke and an important risk factor for myocardial infarction, chronic kidney disease, and other serious medical 
conditions.  Study education about the importance of hypertension , goal blood pressure levels, and regular 
monitoring of blood pressure may lead to improved blood pressure control in subjects, which in turn has the 
potential to lower the risk of serious medical conditions, including heart attack and stroke.  There is also a 
potential societal benefit, as this stu dy will provide important insights into adherence with home monitoring in 
patients with cerebrovascular disease and may be useful for future larger studies which combine home monitoring 
with therapeutic interventions  to lower blood pressure  with the goal o f reducing the risk of future stroke.  
10.3  Alternatives to Participation  
Participation in this research study is voluntary.  Subjects may choose not to participate; their decision to 
participate or not will not affect their regular medical care in any wa y.   
10.4  Risk/Benefit Assessment  
Considering the minimal risk to participants and the potential benefit both to individual participants and to society, 
the risk to benefit ratio is favorable.

11.1  Definitio ns 
      Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity 
during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  
Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be  adverse events if the abnormality:  
 Results  in study withdrawal  
 Is associated with a serious adverse event  
 Is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
 Leads  to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
 Is considered by [CONTACT_71996] -serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
 Fatal  
 Life-threatening  
 Requires  or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
 Results  in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 A congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 An important medical event  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major 
clinical significance.   They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the 
other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in 
in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71978] a n emergency department would 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355].  
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the serious criteria will be regarded as non-serious adverse 
events .  
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which adverse events mus t be reported is defined as the period from the initiation of 
any study procedures to the end of the study treatment follow -up.  For this study, the study treatment follow -
up is defined as [ADDRESS_78088] .  
Preexisting Condition  
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition should be 
recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during 
the study period.  
General Physical Examination Findings

Page 15 of 18 IRB APPLICATION  Version: 9/26/2016  
  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At the end 
of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition  of an adverse event 
will be recorded and documented as an adverse event.   
Post -study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events will be followed by [CONTACT_1374], the subject 
is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the investigator 
should instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal 
physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.  The inve stigator should notify 
the FDA and IRB of any death or adverse event occurring at any time after a subject has discontinued or 
terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to this study.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71979] a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition 
responsible for surgery will be documented as an adverse event if the condition meets the criteria for an 
adverse event.   
 
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an adverse 
event in the following circumstances:  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_71980] a 
preexisting condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse event if the 
purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14842].  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14843], unless it is 
a worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14844].  
11.[ADDRESS_78089], study personnel  will seek information on adverse events by [CONTACT_71997], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148]. Information on all ad verse events will be recorded immediately in the source 
document, and in the appropriate adverse event module of the case report form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, 
symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures with their results will be recorded in the  source document, 
grouped under one diagnosis.  
 
All adverse events occurr ing during the study period will  be recorded.  The clinical course of each event should be 
followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study tre atment or participation is 
not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up to 
determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to 
be possibly related to the study treatment or study participation should be recorded and reported immediately.  
11.3  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Reports of all serious adverse events (including follow -up information) must be sub mitted to the IRB promptly . All 
serious adverse events, regardless of relatedness or expectedness to the study drug, will be submitted via 
PennAEs.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_28693]’s binder.

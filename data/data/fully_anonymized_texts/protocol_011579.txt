You a
re being asked to participate in a research study. Before you give your consent to 
volunteer, it is important that you read the following information and ask as many questions as 
necessary to be sure you understand what you will be asked to do.  
 
Investigators :  
This study is being conducted by [CONTACT_867098], PhD, Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at the 
University of [LOCATION_004], San Diego. Phone number: ([PHONE_17917].  
 
Purpose of the Study:   
This study is being conducted to examine the effects of a behavioral treatment designed to 
improve positive emotions, behaviors, and underlying brain systems. Participants will be 
individuals who experience difficulties with anxiety or depression. You have been asked to 
participate in this study because your responses to our screening questionnaire indicated that you 
are experiencing symptoms of anxiety or depression. There will be approximately 150 
pa
rticipants in this study. 
 
Description of the Study :  
This study has several parts. You will be asked to participate in one or more parts of the study. 
The clinical interview, computer-based, and behavioral portions of the study will be conducted at 
the Altman Clinical and Translational Research Institute located at [ADDRESS_1209694], 
L
a Jolla CA, [ZIP_CODE]. The brain imaging session will be conducted at the UCSD Keck Center for 
Functional MRI.  
 
If you decide to participate in the study the following is a summary of what will happen to you: 
 
Screening procedures :  
To determine if you are eligible to participate, you will be asked to complete a clinical interview. 
A clinical interview is an assessment tool that helps researchers make an accurate diagnosis of a 
va
riety of psychiatric conditions. During this interview, you will be asked questions about your 
a
nxiety, mood, and history of other psychological symptoms, which will take approximately one 
hour.  
 
I
f you are a female and capable of child-bearing, we will ask you for verbal confirmation that 
you are not pregnant. If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, you should not take part 
in this research. In addition you will be asked questions to determine if you are eligible to 
undergo MRI, such as whether you have a cardiac pacemaker; metal fragments in the eyes, skin 
or body; heart valve replacement, brain clips, venous filter, history of sheet metal work or 
welding, aneurysm surgery, intracranial by[CONTACT_6476], renal or aortic vascular clips; prosthetic devices 
such as middle ear, eye, penile implants or joint replacements; hearing aide, neurostimulator, 
insulin pump, IUD, pregnancy; vascular shunts or stents; metallic implants, plates, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2115], wires or Human Research

If your responses indicate that you are eligible, you will be asked to participate in the study. If 
you are not eligible to participate, the information obtained from you during this screening will 
not be included in this study and will be shredded to protect your confidentiality. 
 
Study procedures :  
Part 1:  
During this part of the study, you will be asked to complete questionnaires and provide the 
investigators with basic information about you as well as information about your mood and 
anxiety. This portion of the study should take about [ADDRESS_1209695] with each participant. The interview 
portion of the study will take about one hour. If your responses during this interview indicate that 
you are eligible to participate, you will continue to Part 2. 
 
Part 2:  
Next, you will be asked to complete several additional questionnaires and computerized tasks. 
During these tasks you will see pi[INVESTIGATOR_320517] a screen, and you will be asked to either do 
nothing or, in some cases, to push a button or move a joystick according to the rules of the task. 
The task(s) will be explained to you in detail beforehand so that you will know how to perform 
the task. These questionnaires and computer tasks will take approximately 90 minutes. You may 
take
 breaks in between the computer tasks if you so choose. You will also be asked to complete 
several tasks that measure your level of anxiety and mood in different situations (e.g., talking 
with a stranger). The behavioral tasks will take about [ADDRESS_1209696] with each 
participant.  
 
During the computer and/or behavioral tasks, some basic physical functions (e.g., heart rate, 
breathing rate) may be measured with a non-invasive device. Additionally, electrodes may be 
attached to your face to measure eye and other facial movements as well as to your neck, hand, 
wrist, and/or palm to monitor skin conductance and heart rate. The electrodes will be attached 
using gel/lotion and paper tape. Brain activity may be measured during these tasks using surface 
electrodes that are mounted in an elastic cap, which you will wear during the experiment. The 
cap has open plastic rings that are filled with gel/lotion and then surface electrodes will be placed 
in those holes. All electrodes will be removed after the assessment is complete. Setting up these 
devices and fitting and adjusting the electrodes and cap will take approximately 30  minutes. 
 
Part 3:  
Next, you will complete the MRI session. If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, you 
should not take part in this research.  If you are a female and capable of child-bearing, we will 
administer a urine pregnancy test before the MRI session. The test result must be negative for

Do not use after      02/20/[ADDRESS_1209697]. Taylor and his research team will make sure that your 
urine collected for this study will be properly discarded. It will not be used for any other 
research. In this session a pi[INVESTIGATOR_867095] a Magnetic Resonance 
Imaging (MRI) scanner. This session will take approximately 2 hours and will be scheduled at 
the UCSD Keck Center for fMRI. For the MRI scan, you will be placed in a large donut-like 
machine for about 1 hour. Your head will be placed in a special helmet-like “head-holder” and 
you will be asked to hold still while we take pi[INVESTIGATOR_138379]. The MRI technician will 
position you in the scanning machine, provide hearing protection including ear plugs and 
headphones, ensure that you can fully view the display screen, and give you the response device 
(i.e., button box or joystick). You will be asked to perform several computer tasks while in the 
MRI scanner. During these tasks you will see pi[INVESTIGATOR_867096] a screen or onto 
special goggles, and you will be asked to either do nothing or, in some cases, to push a button or 
move a joystick according to the rules of the task. The task(s) will be explained to you in detail 
before you enter the scanner so that you will know how to perform the task.  
 
 
Part 4:  
This is the treatment part of the study. You will be randomly assigned to one of t wo treatment 
groups or a waitlist group. The random group assignment ensures that each participant has the 
sa
me probability (~33% chance) of be ing  assigned to any group.  
 
 
Treatment Groups:  
If you are assigned to one of the treatment groups, you will come into the clinic once per 
week for either [ADDRESS_1209698] Group: If you are assigned to the waitlist group, you will not complete any 
exercises in Part 4 for a 10-week duration. After completing Part 5 you will be given the 
opportunity to complete the treatment protocol. 
 
Part 5: 
After completing Part 4 (treatment groups) or approximately 10 weeks after completing Part 3 
(waitlist group), you will attend a final assessment session during which you will complete the 
same assessments that you completed during the initial session (Part 2), including the brain 
im
aging session (Part 3). Each session will last about [ADDRESS_1209699]

Risks or Discomforts :  
Participation in this study may involve some added risks or discomforts. These include: 
1. You ma y experience temporary discomfort because you will be asked to answer some 
personal questions about your anxiety, mood, and other psychological symptoms (for 
example: “Have you been feeling depressed during the past few weeks?”). You will also be 
asked to view words, sentences, or pi[INVESTIGATOR_867097] (for example: read the word 
"embarrassed" or "stupid"), or complete tasks (e.g., talking with a stranger) that may cause 
temporary discomfort. We will do everything possible to minimize any risks or discomfort 
y
ou may experience as a result of the study. If you feel any discomfort as a result of 
participating in this study, you may stop at any time, and you should also contact [CONTACT_867099]. The investigator will also provide you with a referral list 
with contact [CONTACT_867100].  
2. You may feel some discomfort from wearing the electrode cap as it may put some pressure 
on your forehead or chin (chip strap). You may also experience some temporary discomfort 
with the removal of the tape that holds the electrodes in place. You may experience some 
temporary skin irritation from the gel/lotion use to attach the electrodes to the skin, and/or the 
tape used to hold the electrodes in place. These risks will be reduced by [CONTACT_2329] a 
hypoallergenic, bacteriostatic, saline-based gel and the option of foam padding for your 
for
ehead and/or chinstrap. 
3. R isks associated with MRI: The magnetic resonance scanner is a long narrow tube that is 
open on both ends. A small number of individuals experience claustrophobia once inside. 
You will be able to signal the investigators with a squeeze ball device at any time to pause or 
stop the study or simply to ask questions.  
 The scanner produces loud banging noises while acquiring images. You will be given 
a set of earplugs to help with the noise.  
 There are no known effects from exposure to magnetic fields. However, some 
patients might become anxious or claustrophobic (a feeling of anxiety) during 
sc
anning. If this happens to you, you can stop the procedure at any time. You may 
also experience some discomfort and fatigue or muscular aches from lying on your 
ba
ck for one hour in a confined space during the imaging. While in the scanner, it is 
possible that you might become dizzy, or experience a small twitching sensation. This 
is not unexpected and should not be painful, but you should tell the researchers about 
it.  
 If you have any metal clips, plates or a pacemaker in your body, you should tell the 
investigator. MRI may not be appropriate under some of these conditions: a cardiac 
pacemaker; metal fragments in the eyes, skin or body; heart valve replacement, brain 
clips, venous filter, history of sheet metal work or welding, aneurysm surgery, 
intracranial by[CONTACT_6476], renal or aortic vascular clips; prosthetic devices such as middle 
ear, eye, penile implants or joint replacements; hearing aide, neurostimulator, insulin

Benefits of the Study :  
There may or may not be any direct benefit to you from participating in this study. All 
participants will be provided with diagnostic feedback after the clinical assessment , which is a n 
assessment  tool that helps researchers make an accurate diagnosis of a variety of psychiatric 
conditions.  All participants will also b e given information on c ommunity clinics offering mental 
health services on a sliding fee scale. You may experience a decrease in symptoms or increase in 
positive emotions as a result of these procedures.  The investigators  may learn more about n ew 
treatments to benefit individua ls experiencing elevated levels of anxiety or depression.  
 
Alternatives to Participating:  
The alternative to participation in this study is to not participate. There are alternative treatments 
for anxiety and depression. These include cognitive behavioral and talk therapy, as well as 
medications that have been shown to reduce symptoms. 
 
Voluntary Nature of Participation:  
Participation in this study is voluntary. Your choice of whether or not to participate will not 
influence your current or future relations with UCSD. If you decide to participate, you are free to 
withdraw your consent and to stop your participation at any time without penalty or loss of 
benefits to which you are allowed. If you decide that you no longer wish to continue in this 
study, you will be requested to notify the Investigator, [CONTACT_29898], verbally or in writing. At that 
time, you will be asked to complete a final examination involving questions about your anxiety 
and mood to determine your health status. 
 
The
re may be conditions under which the Investigator, [CONTACT_29898] determines that your 
participation in the study should end. These include any signs of change in your health status that 
may jeopardize your well-being (e.g., significant worsening of anxiety or mood symptoms). If 
your study participation is ended for these reasons, you will be referred to clinical resources in 
y
our community. 
 
Costs and/or Compensation for Participation :

Confidentiality: 
Research records will be kept confidential to the extent allowed by [CONTACT_2371].  All data will be kept 
confidential, and will be accessible only to research personnel, including the Investigator ([CONTACT_524223]), his co-investigators, and trained research assistants. Consent forms with identifying 
infor
mation will be kept in a separate locked filing cabinet from research materials. Research 
materials will be assigned a numerical code separate from any identifying information. This data 
will be kept in a locked office in the case of paper forms or on a password-protected computer at 
the research site in the case of electronic data. Data will be kept for at least three years after the 
conclusion of the study and study analyses are complete. Data may be reported in scientific 
journals, but will not include any information, which identifies you as a participant in this study. 
All of the information you provide will be associated with a number and data will be recorded 
based on that number.  
 
Data from this study  may be submitted to the National Institute of Mental Health Data Archive 
(NDA). The NDA is a  data repository  run by [CONTACT_17144] (NIMH) 
that allows researchers studying mental health and substance use to collect  and share  de-
identified information with each other.  A data repository is a large database where information 
from many studies is stored and managed.  De-identified information means  that all personal 
information about research participants such as name, a ddress, and phone number is removed 
and replaced with a code number.  With an easier way to share, researchers hope to learn new and 
important things about mental illnesses more quickly than before.  
                                                                       
During and after the study, the researchers will send  de-identified information about your health 
and behavior and in some cases, your genetic information, to NDA.  Other researchers nationwide 
can then file an application with the NIMH to obta in access to your  de-identified study data for 
research purposes. Experts at the NIMH who know how to protect health and science 
information will look at every request carefully to minimize risks to your privacy.  
  
You may not benefit directly from allowin g your information to be shared with NDA. The 
information provided to  NDA may help researchers find better  treatments.    
NIMH will  also report to Congress and on its web site about the different studies that researchers 
are conducting using NDA data. Howev er, you will not be contact[CONTACT_867101].   
  
You may decide now or later that you do not want to share your information using NDA.  If so, 
contact [CONTACT_632458], and they will tell NDA, which ca n stop sharing 
the research information.  However, NDA cannot take back information that was shared before

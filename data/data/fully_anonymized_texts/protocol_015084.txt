Study Design:
This is an open -label, randomized, parallel -group study to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single dose of 
vedolizumab subcutaneous (SC) 108 mg for injection administered in 2 different device delivery presentations in 
healthy  subjects. A minimum 102 subjects (51 per group) will be randomized to 1 of 2 device presentations (Group A 
or B).
Group Approximate Number of Subjects Treatment Description (a)
A 51 Single dose vedolizumab SC 108 mg delivered by [CONTACT_57783] (PFS) (reference).
B 51 Single dose vedolizumab SC 108 mg delivered by [CONTACT_862651] (PFS+NSD) (test).
(a) Subjects randomized to each device will also be randomized for the site of administration (abdomen, thigh, or arm). Thus, within 
each treatment group, there are 3 sites of administration (abdomen, thigh, or arm) randomly assigned, for a total of 6 treatm ent

CONFIDENTIALStatistical C onsiderations:
PKs:
For summary statistics and median plots by [CONTACT_31065], the nominal PK sampling time will be used; for individual 
subject plots by [CONTACT_5586], the actual PK sampling time will be used.
The PK parameters will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_3148], by  [CONTACT_57787], and a combination of 
treatment and site of administration. For AUC last, AUC ∞, and C max, individual subject parameters will be plotted by 
[CONTACT_57788]. 
Natural log transfor med AUC∞(if data permit), AUC last, and C maxwill be analy zed using an analysis of covariance 
model with treatment and site of administration as fixed effect and weight as a continuous covariate. Estimates of the 
adjusted mean differences (Test -Reference) and corresponding 90% CIs will be obtained from the model. The 
adjusted mean differences and 90% CIs for the differences will be exponentiated to provide estimates of the ratio of 
adjusted geometric means (Test/Reference) and 90% CIs for the ratios. Single doses of 108 mg of vedolizumab 
administered as PFS (reference treatment) will be compared vs PFS+NSD (Test Treatment). Comparability between 
the test and reference treatments will be concluded if the 90% CI for C maxand AUC lastare contained within therange of 
0.8 and 1.25.
Sample Size Justification:
The sample size of 51 subjects per group will provide 90% probability of concluding that the ratios of central values 
for area under the serum concentration -time curve (AUC) or Cmaxbetween 2 different device presentations is between  
0.8 and 1.25. This is assuming that the true difference between the central values is no more than 5% and based on 
24% coefficient of variation on AUC or C maxfrom no n-Japanese subjects in study MLN0002S C_101. An 18% 
drop-out rate was assumed for the sample size calculation.

CONFIDENTIAL4.0 INTRODUCTION
4.1 Background
Vedolizumab (also known as MLN0002, ENTYVIO, or KYNTELES) is a recombinant 
humanized mo noclonal  antibody  (mAb) com posed of 2 light chains of the subclass and 
2immunoglobulin G 1 heavy chains that binds specifically to the human lymphocyte integrin 47. 
The 47integrin i s a pi[INVESTIGATOR_57770] y and inflammat ion because of its unique 
role in mediat ing the migrat ion of lymphocy tes into gut -associated lympho id tissue and lamina 
propri a, via binding to m ucosal  addressin cell adhesion mo lecule -1 (MAdCAM -1). Thus, 
vedo lizumab acts as a gut- selective immuno modulator. 
Vedolizumab intravenous (IV) has been developed as a treatment for ulcerative co litis (UC) and 
Crohn’s disease (CD), which are characterized by [CONTACT_862652]. 
Marketing approval has been granted in the [LOCATION_002], European Unio n, and mult iple other 
countri es for the treatm ent of adult patients with moderately to severely act ive UC or CD who have 
failed conventional therapy (ie, corticosteroids or immuno modulators) or tum or necrosis factor 
alpha antagoni sts. 
Two presentations o f vedo lizumab have been developed: a lyophilized powder for IV infusio n and 
a liquid for subcutaneous (SC) inject ion. Vedolizumab SC (also known as Vedolizumab Injection, 
for Subcuta neous Use; Vedo lizumab Solut ion for Inject ion in Prefilled Syringe; or MLN0002 SC) 
is a liquid presentation that has been developed for SC administration. To develop vedo lizumab 
SC, the vedo lizumab IV presentation was modified to ensure the long -term stabi lity needed for a 
liquid product. However, the vedo lizumab SC drug product presentation is similar to that of the 
vedo lizumab IV presentation after reconstitution. No changes were made that would impact the 
primary  structure of the protei n, and com parable biochemical properties and in vitro funct ional 
activit y have been demonstrated. Therefore, the nonclinical and clinical informat ion from studies 
with vedolizumab IV are considered relevant.
The bioavailabilit y, pharmacokinet ics (PK), and safet y of vedolizu mab fo llowing a single SC 
inject ion of vedo lizumab SC at 3 dose levels (54, 108, and 160 mg) relat ive to a single IV infusio n 
of vedo lizumab IV 300 mg was examined in a phase 1, open- label study  (MLN0002SC_101). 
Forty -eight (24 Japanese and 24 non -Japanese ) heal thy, adul t male and female subjects were 
rando mized. A total o f 12subjects received a single dose of vedo lizumab IV 300 mg and 
36subjects received a single dose of vedo lizumab SC at 54, 108, or 160 mg (12 subjects per dose 
group). The bioavailabili ty estimate from vedo lizumab SC was 75.1%. The SC bioavailabilit y was 
independent of the SC doses evaluated (54, 108, and 160 mg vedolizumab SC). All other PK 
param eters estimates were very  similar to the values derived from phase 3 data with vedolizumab 
IV, and there were no PK differences by [CONTACT_545] (Japanese vs non -Japanese). In study  
MLN0002SC_101 ,75.0% of subjects (36 of 48 subjects) had treatment -emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs). The percentage of subjects with a TEAE was the same when comparing subjects who 
received vedo lizumab SC and subjects who received vedolizumab IV. All TEAEs were considere d 
by [CONTACT_57790] y; no TEAEs of severe intensit y were 
reported. Four subjects had persistently moderate to high antivedolizumab antibodies ( AVA) t iters

and were not included in the nonco mpartmental  PK summaries. Overall, vedo lizumab SC and 
vedo lizumab IV were well tolerated in this study. The observed TEAEs were consistent with the 
overall safet y profile o f vedo lizumab.
Previou sly conducted clinical  studi es have characterized the efficacy, safety , tolerabili ty, PK, 
pharmacodynamics, and immunogenicit y of vedo lizumab IV, a lyophilized formulat ion. As of 
19November 2016, vedolizumab exposure has extended for ≥12months in 1832 subjects, 
≥24months in 1379 subjects, ≥36months in 1169 subjects, ≥48months in 862 subjects, 
≥60months in 645 subjects, ≥72months in 308 subjects, ≥84 months in 32 subjects, and 
≥96months in [ADDRESS_1202537] recent drug shipment data (19 November 2016), the 
cumulative pat ient exposure to vedo lizumab IV since its marketing approval in May [ADDRESS_1202538] ive UC or CD who achieved clinical response fo llowing open -label 
vedo lizumab IV therapy  (MLN0002SC -3027 and MLN0002SC -3031) . The current presentation 
of the SC form ulation is in a prefilled syringe. 
The main purpose of this phase 1 clinical study is to compar e the PK of a vedo lizumab SC 108 mg 
dose in a prefilled sy ringe (PFS) vs prefilled syringe in needle safet y device (PFS+NSD). The 
PFS+NSD presentation is planned to be commercially available device after approval.
4.3 Benefit/Risk Profile 
The proposed study  (Vedo lizumabSC -1018) i s designed to evaluate the PK and variabilit y of a 
vedo lizumab SC 108 mg dose in a PFS vs PFS+NSD . No changes were made to the vedolizumab 
SC drug product composit ion that would impact the primary structure of the protein, and 
comparab le biochemical properties and in vitro funct ional act ivity have been demo nstrated. 
Therefore, the nonclinical and clinical informat ion fro m studi es wi th vedolizumab IV are 
considered relevant.
The safet y of the vedo lizumab SC presentation is expected to be similar to that of vedo lizumab IV 
because of similar exposure, outside of expected local administration site events, such as 
inject ion-site reacti ons. The observed adverse events (AEs) with vedolizumab SC are consistent 
with the vedo lizumab IV safet y profile in ongo ing phase 3 clinical studies.
A phase 1 single dose study  with the SC form ulation in healt h volunteers was conducted and 
ident ified no safet y concerns. This study  is comparing different devices and the safet y is expected 
to be similar among thes e devices. 
Overall, vedo lizumab has been well tolerated in clinical studies, including a phase 1 study of 
vedo lizumab SC.

6.2 Justification for Study Design, Dose, and Endpoints
This study  is designed in accordance wit h Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance 
docum ents [1,2] . The primary  PK endpo ints C maxand area under the serum concentration -time 
curve (AUC) are standard parameters to com pare the rate and extent of absorption.
This study  will be perf ormed in heal thy subjects, rather than the target subject populat ion (ie, 
patients wi th UC or CD) because of the potential for immunogenicit y in subjects after single dose 
administration . Similar PK has been observed in healthy subjects and pat ients with UC or CD 
following administration of vedolizumab IV.
The study  design is open -label, since the primary object ive is to assess object ive variables, that is, 
vedo lizumab PK using mult iple device presentations. Because this is an object ive measurement, 
there is consequent ly no  risk of potential bias of the stud y results; hence, neit her study blinding nor 
inclusio n of a placebo group is required.

From  signing of informed consent, throughout the durati on of the study, and for [ADDRESS_1202576] 
dose of study  drug, female subjects of childbearing potential* who are sexually  active wi th a 
nonsterilized male partner** must use a highly effective method of contraception (from the list

CONFIDENTIAL9.1.9.3 Definitions and Procedures for Contraception and Pregnancy Avoidance
The follow ing definitions apply for contraception and pregnancy avoidance procedures.
* A wom an is considered a woman of childbearing potential, that is, fertile, fo llowing menarche 
and until beco ming postmenopausal unless permanent ly sterile. Permanent sterilizat ion methods 
include hysterectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy . A postmenopausal state is defined as no 
menses for 12 months wit hout an alternative medical cause. A high FSH level in the 
postm enopausal  range (FSH >40 IU/L) may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in younger 
wom en (eg, those <45 years old) or women who are not using hormonal contraception or hormona l 
replacement therapy . However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH 
measurement is insufficient.
** Sterilized men should be at least [ADDRESS_1202577] –bilateral vasectomy and have confirmed that they 
have obtained documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate or have had bilateral 
orchi dectomy .
The follow ing procedures apply for contraception and pregnancy avoidance.
1.Highly effect ive methods of contraception are defined as “those, alone or in combinat ion, that 
resul t in a l ow failure rate (i e, less than 1% failure rate per y ear when used consistent ly and 
correctly ). In this study, where medicat ions and devices containing hormones are included, the 
acceptable methods of contraception are: 
Nonhorm onal Methods: 
Intrauterine d evice. 
Bilateral tubal occlusio n. 
Vasectomized partner (provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the study 
participant and that the vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of 
the surgi cal success. 
True sexual abst inence, only if this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle o f 
the subject. True abstinence is defined as refraining fro m heterosexual intercourse 
during the ent ire peri od of  the study , from [ADDRESS_1202578] dose.
Horm onal Methods: Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the 
investigat ive co mpound, comparator, concomitant medicat ions, which may reduce the 
efficacy  of the contracepti on method.
Combined (estrogen and progestogen) hormonal contraception a ssociated with 
inhibit ion of ovulat ion init iated at least [ADDRESS_1202579] dose of study drug 
OR combined with a barrier method (male condom, female condo m or diaphragm) 
if for shorter durati on unt il she has been on contraceptive for 3 months:
Oral.

CONFIDENTIALIntravaginal (eg, ring).
Transdermal. 
Progestogen -only hormonal contracepti on associ ated wi th inhibit ion of ovulation 
initiated at least [ADDRESS_1202580] dose of study  drug OR combined with a 
barrier m ethod (m ale condom , female condo m or diaphragm) if shorter till she has 
been on contraceptive for 3 months:
Oral. 
Injectable.
Implantable.
2.Subjects will be provided with information on highly effect ive methods of contraception as 
part of the subject informed consent process and will be asked to sign a consent form stating 
that they  understand the requirements for avo idance of pregnancy, donat ion of ova, and sper m 
donati on during the course of the study .
3.During the course of the study, regular serum hCG pregnancy tests will be performed only for 
women of childbearing potential and all subjects (male and female) will receive continued 
guidance wi th respect to the avoidance of pregnancy  and sperm  donat ion as part of the study  
procedures. Such guidance should include a reminder of the fo llowing:
a.Contr aceptive requirements of the study.
b.Reasons for use of barrier methods (ie, condom) in men with pregnant partners.
c.Assessment of subject compliance through questions such as:
i.Have you used the contraception consistent ly and correctly since the last 
visit?
ii.Have y ou forgotten to use contraception since the last visit ?
iii.Are your menses late (even in women with irregular or infrequent menstrual 
cycles a pregnancy test must be performed if the answer is “yes”)
iv.Is there a chance you could be pregnant ?
4.In addit ion to a negative serum hCG pregnancy test at Screening, female subjects of 
childbearing potential must also have confirmed menses in the mo nth before first dosing (no 
delayed menses), a negat ive serum hCG pregnancy test as close as possible and be fore first

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal

Requi re an invasive diagnostic procedure.
Requi re discont inuat ion or a change in dose of study  drug or a concomitant medicat ion.
Be considered unfavorable by [CONTACT_4168]. 
PTEs/AEs caused by a study  procedure (eg, a bruise after blood draw) should be recorded as a 
PTE/AE.
Diagnoses vs signs and symptoms:
Each event should be recorded to represent a single  diagnosis. Acco mpanying signs (including 
abnorm al labora tory values or ECG findings) or symptoms should NOT be recorded as 
additional AEs. If  a diagnosis is unknown, sign(s) or symptom(s) should be recorded 
appropriately  as a PTE(s) or as an AE(s).
Laboratory  values and ECG findings:
Changes in laboratory  values or ECG findings are only  considered to be PTEs or AEs if they 
are judged to be clinically significant (ie, if some action or intervent ion is required or if the 
investigator judges the change to be bey ond the range of normal physio logic fluctuati on). A 
laboratory  or ECG re -test and/or continued monitoring of an abnormal value or finding are not

If abnormal laboratory values or ECG findings are the result of pathology for which there is an 
overall diagnosis (eg, increased creat inine in renal failure), the diagnosis only should be 
reported appropriately  as a PTE or as an AE.
Pre-existing condit ions:
Pre-exist ing condit ions (present at the time o f signing of informed consent) are considered 
concurrent medical condit ions and should NOT be recorded as PTEs or AEs. Baseline 
evaluat ions (eg, laboratory tests, ECG, x -rays) should NOT be re corded as PTEs unless related 
to study procedures. However, if the subject experiences a worsening or complicat ion of such a 
concurrent medical condit ion, the worsening or complicat ion should be recorded appropriately 
as a PTE (worsening or complication oc curs before start of study drug) or an AE (worsening or 
complicat ion occurs after start of study  drug). Investigators should ensure that the event term 
recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening o f…”).
If a subject has a pre -exist ing epi [INVESTIGATOR_39747] (eg, asthma, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]) any 
occurrence of an epi[INVESTIGATOR_45284] a PTE/AE if the condit ion beco mes more 
frequent, serious or severe in nature. Investigators should ensure that the AE term recorded 
captures t he change in the condit ion from Baseline (eg “worsening of…”).
If a subject has a pre -exist ingdegenerat ive concurrent medical condit ion (eg, cataracts, 
rheumatoi d arthri tis), worsening of the condit ion shoul d only be recorded as a PTE/AE if 
occurring to a greater extent to that which would be expected. Invest igators should ensure that 
the AE term recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening o f…”).
Worsening of PTEs or AEs:
If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of a PTE aft er the start of study  drug, 
the worsening or complication should be recorded as an AE. Invest igators should ensure that 
the AE term recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening o f…”).
If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of an AE after any  change in study  
drug, the worsening or complicat ion shoul d be recorded as a new AE. Invest igators should 
ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening of…”).
Changes in intensit y of AEs/serious PTE s:
If the subject experiences changes in intensit y of an AE/seri ous PTE, the event should be 
captured once with the maximum intensit y recorded.
Prepl anned surgeries or procedures:
Prepl anned procedures (surgeries or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) that were scheduled before signing of informed 
consent are not considered PTEs or AEs. However, if a preplanned procedure is performed 
early  (eg, as an em ergency) because of a worsening of the pre -exist ing con dition, the

Elect ive procedures performed where there is no change in the subject ’s medical condit ion 
shoul d not be recorded as PTEs or AEs, but should be documented in the subject’s source 
docum ents. Com plicat ions result ing from an elect ive surgery should be reported as AEs.
Overdose:
Cases of overdose with any  medicati on wi thout m anifested side effects are NOT considered 
PTEs or AEs, but instead will be documented on an Overdose page of the CRF. Any 
manifested side effects will be considered PTEs or AEs and will be recorded on the AE page of 
the CRF.
10.1.[ADDRESS_1202600] medical occurrence that at any  dose:
1.Results in DEATH.
2.Is LIFE THREATENING.

The rel ationship (causalit y) of each AE to study  drug(s) will be assess ed using the fo llowing 
categori es:
Related: An AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of a drug (including the 
course after withdrawal of the drug), or for which possible involvement of the drug cannot be 
ruled out , although fac tors other than the drug, such as underlying diseases, complications, 
concomitant medications and concurrent treatments, may also be responsible.
Not Related: An AE that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of a drug and/o r 
that can reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_1604], such as underlying diseases, complications, 
concomitant medications and concurrent treatments.
10.1.8 Relationship to Study Procedures
Relationship (causalit y) to study  procedures should be determined for all PT Es and AEs.
The relationship should be assessed as Related if the investigator considers that there is reasonable 
possibilit y that an event is due to a study procedure. Otherwise, the relationship should be assessed 
as Not Related.
10.1.9 Start Date
The start dat e of the AE/PTE is the date that the first signs/symptoms were noted by  [CONTACT_14426]/or invest igator.
10.1.10 Stop Date 
The stop date of the AE/PTE is the date at which the subject recovered, the event resolved but with 
sequelae or the subject died.
10.1.11 Frequency 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_39751] c AEs/PTE (eg, vomit ing) or those which occur repeatedly over a period of consecutive 
days are intermittent. All other events are continuous.
10.1.12 Action Concerning Study Drug 
Drug withdrawn –a study  drug i s stopped because of the particular AE.
Dose not changed –the particular AE did not require stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a study  drug.
Unknown –only to be used if it has not been possible to determine what action has been taken.
Not applicable –a study  drug was stopped for a reason other than the particular AE, eg, the 
study  has been terminated, the subject died, dosing with study drug was already stopped before 
the onset of the AE.
Dose interrupted –the dose was interrupted because of the particular AE.

Recovered/reso lved –Subject returned to first assessment status with respect to the AE/PTE.
Recovering/resolving –the intensit y is lowered by  1 or m ore stages: the diagnosis or 
signs/symptom s has almost di sappeared; the abnormal laboratory  value improved, but has not 
returned to the normal range or to baseline; the subject died from a cause other than the 
particular AE/PTE with the condit ion rem aining “recovering/reso lving”.
Not recovered/not resolved –there is no change in the diagnosis, signs or symptoms; the 
intensity of the di agnosis, si gns/ symptom s or laboratory  value on the last day  of the observed 
study  period has got worse than when it started; is an irreversible congenital anomaly; the 
subject died fro m another cause with the particular AE/PTE state remaining “Not 
recovered/not resolved”.
Resolved with sequelae –the subject recovered from an acute AE/PTE but was left with 
perm anent/si gnificant impairment (eg, recovered from a cardiovascular accident but with 
some persisting paresis).
Fatal  –the AEs/PTEs which are considered as the cause of death.

[IP_ADDRESS] AEs of Special Interest
If these special interest AEs , which occur duri ng the treatment period or the fo llow-up peri od, are 
considered to be clinically significant based on the criteria below, they  shoul d be recorded in a 
special interest AE CRF or an SAE form. The SAE form shoul d be com pleted and reported to the 
SAE reporting contact [CONTACT_82301] 1.0within 24 hours .
Hypersensitivity Reactions (Including Injection Site Reactions)
Current ly, there is no evidence to support the routine prophylactic administration of premedication 
(eg, antihistamines, corticosteroids) to subjects receiving vedo lizumab; hence, such preme dicat ions 
are unlikely to be necessary  or beneficial.
Vedolizumab SC will be administered by a healthcare professio nal, who should be prepared to 
manage hypersensit ivity react ions including anaphylaxis, if they occur. Appropriate monitoring and 
medical sup port measure should be available for immediate use. Subjects should be observed during 
the SC administration and for [ADDRESS_1202604] ion site pain, redness and/or swelling, etc, that may represent an administration -related 
reacti on to study medicat ion. Subjects will be asked to report administration -related AEs to the sites 
immediately  as they  are experienced or aft er having received appropriate medical care. Appropriate 
treatm ent and follow -up will be determined by  [CONTACT_17062]. If si gns or symptoms of an 
administration -related reaction are observed during the administration of study medicat ion, it should

or serious administration -related reaction (eg, shortness of breath, wheezing, stridor, angioedema, 
life-threatening change in vital signs, severe injection site reacti ons) m ust be wi thdrawn from  the 
study  (see Study  Manual ). 
Any inject ion site reaction will be collected and graded as fo llows:
Grade 1: Tenderness with or without associated symptoms (eg warmth, erythema, itching).
Grade 2: Pain, lipody strophy , ede ma, phlebit is.
Grade 3: Ulcerat ion or necrosis, severe tissue damage, operative intervention indicated.
Grade 4: Life threatening consequences; urgent intervent ion indicated.

Protocol 11 December 2017
CONFIDENTIALET=Early Termination, PT=prothrombin time.
(a) Days [ADDRESS_1202631] a ±[ADDRESS_1202632] a ±2 -day window. Days 64, 85, 106, 127/ET, and [ADDRESS_1202633] a ±3 day window.
(b) Informed consent must be signed before any study -specific procedures are performed.
(c) All subjects must have a negative QuantiFERON test at Screening. Initial indeterminate results will be repeated; a subject with 2 indeterminate results will be excluded. 
(d) The PML checklist is administered at Screening, on Day 1 before the administration of study drug, and 127±3/ET, and at an y unscheduled visits. A wallet card that denotes key 
study  information, including signs and symptoms of PML, will be distributed to all subjects at Screening.
(e) A physical examination will be performed at Screening, on Days -1, 1, 8, 29, and at the Final Visit Day 127/ET. All physical examinations will be performed by [CONTACT_57818]. Clinically significant findings on the physical examination that occur after dosing with study drug will be recorded as AEs.
(f) Vital signs (oral temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], pulse, and blood pressure) will be obtaine d at Screening, Check -in (Day -1), Day  1 (predose, postdose), and Final Visit Day 127±3/ET. 
For Day 1, heart rate and blood pressure will be measured after 5 minutes in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_57781] 1 and 3 minutes after standing. For Day 127±3/ET, heart rateand blood pressure 
will be measured after 5 minutes supi[INVESTIGATOR_57782]. 
(g) Height and weight will be measured and BMI will be calculated at Screening. Weight will also be measured at Check -in Day -1 and Day 106±3.
(h) All ongoing medications from Screening thr ough Final Visit Day 127/ET will be recorded.
(i) Standard 12 -lead ECGs will be recorded at Screening, Check -in (Day -1), Day  1 (predose [within 0.5 hours before dosing the SC injection]), and Final Visit Day 127/ET. When an 
ECG recording is scheduled for the same day as blood draws (eg, PK or AVA sampling), the ECG recording will be collected 5 minutes before the nominal time o f the blood sample. 
(j) With the exception of the Screening Visit, clinical laboratory tests (hematology, serum chemistry, and uri nalysis) require a minimum [ADDRESS_1202634]. 
(k) A serum pregnancy test is required for women of childbearing potential only. Pregnancy avoidance counseling will also be performed. 
(l) An FSH level will be obtained on women who are postmenopausal ( ie, defined as at least [ADDRESS_1202635] regular menses with an FSH >40 IU/L or at least [ADDRESS_1202636] regular 
menses).
(m) Subjects will be confined to the clinic for 2 nights (Day  -1 to Day 2, inclusive). The total confinement period will be 2 days . Subjects are required to be considered clinically stable 
by [CONTACT_57819] 2. Subjects will return to the study units periodically according to the schedule for PK sampling and safety assessments. 
(n) The pain scale will be administered immediately following the SC injection, and a second assessment will be performed between 15 and 30 minu tes following the injection.
(o) Blood samples for determination of AVA will be collected at predose on Day 1 (within 0.5 hours be fore dosing), Days 29, 64, 85, 106, and 127/ET postdose. AVA positive 
samples will be further analyzed for neutralizing AVA. If a subject experiences an SAE, a blood sample for AVA assessment sho uld be obtained at the unscheduled visit.
(p) Blood samples f or PK analyses of vedolizumab will be collected beginning predose on Day 1 (within 0.5 hours before the SC injection) and then at 2, 8, 24, 72, 120, and 168 hours 
after Day 1 dosing, and on Days 10, 15, 29, 43, 64, 85, 106, and Final Visit Day 127/ET. If a subject experiences an SAE, a blood sample for PK analysis should also be obtained at 
the unscheduled visit. PK samples will be collected at ET at the discretion of the investigator.
(q) PTEs will be captured following the signing of the informed consent at Screening. Routine collection of AEs will occur from the administration of study drug until Final Visit Day 
127/ET and the unscheduled visit. Any new AEs will be recorded in the CRFs and site source document. If any SAE is reported s pontaneously to the investigator following the AE 
collection period, the event will be reported to the sponsor if it is considered to be related to study participation.

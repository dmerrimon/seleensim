Study Title:   A phase Ib study of the combination of MLN0128 (Dual TORC1/2 Inhibitor) 
and MLN8237 (Aurora A inhibitor, alisertib) in patients with advanced solid tumors with 
an expansion cohort in metastatic triple -negative breast cancer (TNBC)  
Phase:   Ib 
Number of Patients:  A maximum of 6 patients can be enrolled at each dose level.  With 5 
potential dose levels and an expansion cohort of 30 patients, including TNBC, the 
maximum number of patients that can be enrolled is 56 and the minimum number is 6. 
Study Objec tives  
Primary  
• To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) 
of the combination of MLN0128 and alisertib in adult patients with advanced solid 
tumors. 
Secondary  
• To determine the safety profile and tolerability of the combination of MLN0128 and alisertib in adult patients with advanced solid tumors.  
• To determine the pharmacokinetics of MLN0128 and alisertib in the combination. 
• To evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of MLN0128 and alisertib in serial tumor biopsies and blood samples in patients with metastatic TNBC  and other solid tumors 
enrolled in the expansion cohort at the MTD. 
• To estimate the objective response rate using RECIST 1.1 and time to progression in patients with advanced solid tumors treated with MLN0128 and alisertib.  
Tertiary/Exploratory  
• To explore biomarkers predictive of response to MLN0128 and alisertib including the investigation of mechanisms of acquired resistance to treatment in patients with metastatic TNBC and other solid tumors treated in the expansion cohort at the MTD. 
• To evaluate the pharmacodynamic effect of the combination of MLN0128 and alisertib on cellular metabolism using functional imaging with FDG -PET (5 -fluoro -
deoxy-glucose-PET) and diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI-MRI).  
Overview of Study Design:    
This is a single institution, Phase Ib study designed to evaluate the safety and toxicity of the combination of MLN0128 and alisertib in patients with advanced solid tumors with an expansion cohort in patients with previously treated metastatic TNBC  and other solid 
tumors.  
The dose escalation portion of the trial with be conducted using a standard 3 + [ADDRESS_1174429] therapy exists (see Figure 1 for dose escalation

V4 25July2018 4 schema and Table 1 for planned dose levels).  Once the maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD) / recommended phase II dose (RP2D) is identified, the dose 
expansion portion will be conducted in patients with previously treated metastatic TNBC  and other solid tumors.  Exploratory correlative studies will 
be conducted in the expansion cohort including:  evaluation of pharmacodynamics markers in serial tumor biopsies and blood samples, exploration of predictive biomarkers using fresh and archival tissue samples, and evaluation of cellular metabolism using functional imaging.  
A total of 20 patients will be treated in the dose -expansion cohort at the MTD/RP2D (see 
Figure 2 for dose expansion cohort schema).  All patients in the expansion cohort group [ADDRESS_1174430] 1.1 will be evaluated every three cycles (approximately 9  weeks i n the dose escalation cohort and 10 weeks in the dose 
expansion cohort Group 2). 
 An additional 10 patients with previously treated locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic 
cancer will be treated at the MTD/RP2D to further evaluate tolerability and explore efficacy in this population.

MLN0128/alisertib   
COMIRB [ADDRESS_1174463] prevalent malignancy in women worldwide and accounts for more 
than 400,000 cancer deaths annually ( 1).  Triple- negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined 
as breast cancer which is negative for the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] 2 (HER2).  TNBC accounts for 10-15% of all newly diagnosed breast cancer (2,3), although there is a higher incidence in breast 
cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA1) mutation carriers (4) in African -American women (5).  
The molecular profiling of breast cancers has revealed that a basal -like gene expression 
signature [CONTACT_845086]; however, the overlap is not complete (6,7).  
Patients with TNBC are more likely to develop distant metastasis and have an increased risk of death from breast cancer compared to other breas t cancer subtypes (2,8). 
 Systemic chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for advanced or metastatic TNBC (9).  
The principle goal of chemotherapy in metast atic breast cancer is the palliation of symptoms 
related to sites of disease; however, prolongation of survival is also a goal where feasible.  Combination chemotherapy generally has higher response rates compared to the sequential administration of single  agents.   Combination chemotherapy, however, does not always 
confer a survival benefit and can produce significantly more toxicity ( 10).  First line 
chemotherapy for TNBC generally involves an anthracycline or taxane-based regimen.  A number of other chemotherapeutic agents have some degree of activity ( 11) and there are 
currently no targeted agents FDA- approved for the treatment of TNBC.  Patients with 
metastatic TNBC have a median overall survival of around [ADDRESS_1174464] 12 weeks ( 12). 
1.1.2         MLN0128  
Millennium has developed MLN0128, which is a novel, highly selective, orally bioavailable adenosine 5’ triphosphate (ATP)-competitive inhibitor of the serine/threonine kinase referred to as the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). MLN0128 (formerly INK128)  
targets [ADDRESS_1174465] mTOR  complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. 
 MLN0128 selectively and potently inhibits mTOR kinase (IC
50 = 1.1 nM), inhibits 
mTORC1/2 signaling, and prevents cellular proliferation. The mTOR is a kinase that regulates cell growth, translational control, angiogenesis, and cell survival by [CONTACT_259780]. mTOR kinase plays a key role in several pathways that are requently dysregulated in human cancer ( 13).  mTORC1 is best known as a key regulator of 
protein translation through phosphorylation of 4EBP1 (the eukaryotic translation Initiation Factor 4E -binding Protein 1) and ribosomal protein S6 (known as S6) kinase. mTORC2 is 
best known for its ability to fully activate protein kinase B (AKT) by [CONTACT_432363] S473 site, which regulates proliferation and survival pathways ( 14). 
 
The mTORC  is an important therapeutic target that is a key intracellular point of 
convergence for a number of cellular signaling pathways. Inhibiting mTOR may inhibit

providing the rationale for mTOR inhibitors as potential agents in the treatment of a number of indications including solid tumor and hematological malignancies, as either monotherapy or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. Like rapamycin, several newly approved rapalogs (temsirolimus and everolimus) are specific and allosteric inhibitors of mTORC1, and only partially inhibit mTORC1 signaling pathways. They do not directly inhibit mTORC2,  which has shown to be an emerging target in cancer research. MLN0128 
was developed to address the incomplete inhibition of the mTOR pathway by [CONTACT_432364]1 and mTORC2. 
 MLN0128 is being developed for both oncology and non-oncology indications. In oncology, MLN0128 is being investigated as a treatment for advanced solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, either as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy, other molecularly targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], or antihormonal agents. Non- oncology indications  
being investigated include fibrotic and inflammatory diseases .  
 
2.    NONCLINICAL SUMMARY  
2.1 Pharmacology 
MLN0128 selectively and potently inhibits mTOR kinase (the concentration inhibiting 50% 
of enzyme activity [IC
50] is 1.1 nM), inhibits mTORC1/2 signaling, and prevents cellular 
proliferation.  MLN0128 inhibited phosphorylation of downstream modulators of mTORC1and mTORC2 in human U87 glioblastoma tumor xenograft models in mice and showed strong tumor growth inhibition (TGI) at tolerable oral (PO) doses in all 8 xenograft models tested  (see IB 
Ed8 for details).

2.3 Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics  
MLN0128 was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_432342], rats, dogs, and monkeys, with high oral bioavailability. [
14C]MLN0128 was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_845048]- Evans rats; radioactivity was eliminated from most tissues at  
48 hours postdose. MLN0128 displayed dose-proportional plasma exposures, a moderate propensity to cross the blood-brain barrier, and was modestly bound (70.5%) to human plasma proteins. MLN0128 distributed mainly to the plasma of human blood. There was no obvious concentration-dependent red blood cell (RBC) distribution of MLN0128 in human 
MLN0128/alisertib   
COMIRB [ADDRESS_1174467] cancer- resistance protein  
(BCRP), or ganic cation transporter (OCT)1 and OCT2. 
 M1, the single metabolite (monohydroxylation product) observed in human microsomal incubations, was also observed in rats and monkeys. The main isozymes responsible for phase 1 metabolism appear to be cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4. MLN0128 did not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, and 3A4 activity and expression at concentrations up to 
10 µM. MLN0128 displayed low potential for inhibition and is not a time-dependent 
inhibitor of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4/5. 
 Oral administration of MLN0128 in humans has a low potential for metabolic and transporter- based drug -drug interactions (DDIs), especially given clinical exposures 
observed to date after administration of the highest anticipated therapeutic dose to be used in 
the clinic in oncology indications (total maximum plasma concentration [C
max] of 0.48 µ M 
[free C max of 0.14 µM] at 30 mg once weekly [QW]). 
2.4 Toxicology 
The toxicologic profiles obtained in the Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) -compliant and 
non-GLP -compliant studies in rats and monkeys were generally consistent with 
pharmacologic inhibition of mTORC1/2 activity. Observed toxicities were mostly consistent 
between sexes. MLN0128 repeat -dose GLP studies include completed 28- day and 
preliminary 3 -month toxicology studies in rat and monkeys, and embryo- fetal studies in rats 
and rabbits. 
 The primary dose- limiting toxicities (DLTs) of MLN0128 in rats and monkeys were 
secondary to an exaggerated pharmacologic response and consisted of body weight loss and associated clinical observations that included hunched posture, dehydration, gastrointe stinal 
(GI) distress and decreased activity, appetite, and body temperature. In addition to the previously mentioned effects, a single monkey in the 3-month toxicology study demonstrated a DLT of skin toxicity characterized as progressive acanthosis. The highest exposures tolerated in the preliminary 3-month rat and monkey toxicology studies were 
1233 and 194 ng ⋅hr/mL, respectively.  
 
Adverse effects in rats included body weight loss, decreased activity, increased glucose and insulin levels, alterations in w hite blood cells, bone marrow and lymphoid depletion, thymic 
necrosis, oligospermia, testes degeneration/atrophy, nonglandular stomach epi[INVESTIGATOR_59460]/ulceration/hyperplasia, pancreatic islet degeneration and fibrosis, lens fiber degeneration with cataract correlate, adrenal cortex hypertrophy, pi[INVESTIGATOR_845049], liver hepatocellular vacuolation, retinal dysplasia with or without optic nerve atrophy, and alveolar histiocytosis. The alveolar histiocytosis was only present in the 28-day rat study and was absent in the 3-month rat study. Both retinal dysplasia and alveolar histiocytosis are thought to be potential background findings. The pancreatic islet degeneration and fibrosis, as well as the other findings of lens fiber degeneration, pi[INVESTIGATOR_488418], and liver vacuolation, were consistent with the mechanism of action (MOA) and

V4 25July2018 27 effects observed with other rapalogs. The microscopic findings observed in the testes, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_26612], and eyes in the 28-day and/or 3-month rat studies were not resolved after a 14-day recovery period, while partial to complete resolution was seen in the pancreas, adrenal gland, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117], liver, lungs, thymus, nonglandular stomach, and bone marrow.   The adverse effects in monkeys included hunched posture, dehydration, GI distress, and decreased activity, appetite, and body weight; increased glucose and insulin; lymphoid and bone marrow depletion; adrenal hypertrophy/hyperplasia; pancreatic and salivary gland acinar cell secretory depletion;  neutrophilic inflammation of GI tract with occasional erosion 
and ulceration, skin effects including ulceration, epi[INVESTIGATOR_85783], acanthosis and hyperkeratosis; and adipose tissue depletion. Additionally, there were sporadic inflammatory findings am ong some animals that were of uncertain association to the test article. The 
findings in the pancreas, adrenal glands, and salivary glands may have been related to a stress response or reduced food consumption. The findings observed in repeat-dose monkey studies were generally reversible after a 14 -day recovery period. 
 The findings in rat and monkey repeat-dose toxicology studies with MLN0128, including bone marrow and lymphoid depletion; GI, liver, pancreas, and skin effects; and effects on glucose and insulin levels, can be monitored in clinical trials. The toxicities seen in the repeat -dose toxicology studies, such as GI effects and glucose and insulin increases, are 
consistent with the treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), including mucositis and hyperglycemia, observed to date in patients receiving MLN0128.  Rat and rabbit range-finding embryo-fetal studies demonstrated teratogenic, fetotoxic, and abortive effects with MLN0128. Embryo- fetal lethality and/or teratogenic effects have been 
reported with the mTORC1 inhibitors rapamycin and the rapalogs.  MLN0128 was negative for genotoxicity in an in vitro bacterial mutagenesis (Ames) assay, an in vivo rat micronucleus assay, and an in vivo rat comet assay. An in vitro chromosomal aberration assay with MLN0128 in human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) was 
positive for chromosomal aberrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. However, the weight of evidence from the combined results of a negative mutagenicity assay and negative genot oxicity assessments in 2  in vivo assays in 3 tissues (bone marrow, 
liver, and duodenum) demonstrate that MLN0128 does not present a genotoxic risk. MLN0128 was negative for phototoxicity in the 3T3 fibroblast assay.  
3.    SUMMARY OF EFFECTS IN HUMANS

3.2.3  Study INK128-003 
Study INK128-003 is a phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation study of oral MLN0128 
administered in 4 -week cycles in combination with paclitaxel in patients with advanced  
solid malignancies (lung, ovarian, endometrial, breast, pancreatic, prostate, etc). As of t he 
clinical data cutoff date, the treatment period for the primary endpoint had completed and long- term treatment for 1 patient remained ongoing.  
 In this study, 67 patients received ≥1 study drug dose under 1 of 3  dosing schedules: QW; 
QD×3days per week ; and QD×5days per week . With each regimen, paclitaxel 80  mg/m
2 was 
dosed on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle. Patients who tested positive for HER2+ received 
the combination and also received trastuzumab QW.  At total of 57% of the patients are women and 93% are white. At baseline, the median age was 60  years (range, 21 -81 years).  
 On the basis of dose escalation data, 8 mg of MLN0128 on the QD×3days per week  
schedule was selected for the dose expansion phase in patients with breast cancer. The QD×5days per week  and QW schedules were abandoned before MTDs were declared, as 
they were viewed as being less convenient relative to the QD×3days per week  schedule from 
the perspective of administering the paclitaxel and trastuzumab combination.   Overall  in the dose expansion phase, patients entered a median of 3.0 treatment cycles 
(range, 1 -19 cycles) and a mean (SD) of 5.6 (6.07) cycles. The overall median duration of 
exposure was 7.5 weeks, with a duration over 2- fold greater (11.1  weeks) in the MLN0128 
8 mg QD×3da ys per week  HER2 - treatment group relative to the MLN0128 8 mg 
QD×3days per week  HER2+ plus trastuzumab group (5.2 weeks). The median cumulative

5.    CLINICAL SUMMARY OF SAFETY  
5.[ADDRESS_1174486] self -monitoring of blood glucose, 
a finding of fasting blood glucose ≥ 140 mg/dL measured by [CONTACT_845071]. Subjects with Grade 1 hype rglycemia (fasting serum glucose [FSG] > the upper limit of the normal range  
≤ 160 mg/dL) are treated with oral hypoglycemic agents (eg, metformin), and subjects with ≥ Grade 2 hyperglycemia (FSG > 160 mg/dL) are treated aggressively with oral hypoglycemic  agents and/or insulin as clinically indicated. Daily home monitoring and  
MLN0128/alisertib   
COMIRB [ADDRESS_1174487] resulted in good control of glucose levels for the 
majority of MLN0128- treated subjects who developed hyperglycemia.  
 
5.1.2  Cardiac Effects  
Cardiac events (including QT interval corrected for heart rate prolongation and arrhythmias) 
have been infrequently observed in clinical studies of MLN0128. To date, there has been 
[ADDRESS_1174488] postdose that had a fatal outcome and  
was assessed as related to MLN0128. Routine cardiac monitoring with baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) or multigated acquisition  (MUGA)  scan and on-study ECGs and 
physical examination constitute the core cardiac safety monitoring in all MLN0128 studies.  
 For subjects showing any signs of cardiac instability after MLN0128 dosing, additional monitoring onsite before clinic discharge should be considered.  
5.1.3  Renal Function 
Elevations in creatinine (regardless of causality) have been observed in  subjects receiving 
MLN0128, all of which have been reversible with drug interruption and/or supportive care with IV  hydration. Further evaluation of the renal insufficiency with urine electrolytes 
suggested a pre- renal etiology with a low fractional excretion of sodium < 1%. However, the 
adverse event cases were confounded by [CONTACT_488446], vomiting, hyperglycemia, concomitant medications with GI side  effects such as metformin, and 
hydronephrosis, any of which may have also contributed to dehydration a nd elevated 
creatinine. Subjects should be encouraged to drink at least 20 ounces of fluids a day, especially on days requiring fasting (per protocol), with administration of IV fluids in the clinic as indicated to avoid dehydration.  Baseline macroscopic urinalysis and routine serum chemistries along with other safety 
laboratory assessments are performed in all MLN0128 studies. Additionally, microscopic urinalysis, a 12-hour urine collection, spot urine electrolytes, protein and creatinine, and serum  chemistry should be collected at any time when the serum creatinine is ≥ Grade 1, 
according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0, to further evaluate possible etiologies for the renal dysfunction.  
5.1.[ADDRESS_1174489] part, rash and pruritus improve with antihistamines, topi[INVESTIGATOR_178339], and/or dose interruption. Some subjects have required pulse systemic steroids, dose reduction, and/or study treatment discontinuation. 
 
MLN0128/alisertib   
COMIRB [ADDRESS_1174490] not been conducted with MLN0128. At this 
time, there are no known drug interactions. In vitro data, including cytochrome P450 induction/inhibition and transporter inhibition studies conducted for MLN0128, suggest a low risk for MLN0128 to precipi[INVESTIGATOR_047] a drug-drug interaction. Although potential drug- drug 
interactions with MLN0128 cannot be ruled out based on the known metabolism characteristics of MLN0128, the potential risk is considered low.  
 
6.  ALISERTIB (MLN8237 ) 
6.1  Aurora A Kinases and the Aurora A Kinase Inhibitor Alisertib (MLN8237) 
Alisertib (International Proprietary Name, also known as MLN8237) is a selective small 
molecule inhibitor of Aurora A kinase that is being developed for the treatment of advanced malign ancies.  Aurora A kinase (AurA) belongs to a highly conserved family of 
serine/threonine protein kinases that also includes Aurora B and Aurora C.  AurA and Aurora B are expressed in all actively dividing cells, while Aurora C expression is largely restric ted to dividing germ cells (15,16).  AurA localizes to centrosomes and the proximal 
mitotic spi[INVESTIGATOR_683586] a diverse set of mitotic processes.  
 The evidence supporting AurA kinase as a therapeutic target for the treatment of malignancies comes from several sources.  First, the AurA kinase gene is amplified, overexpressed, or both in many tumors, including colon, breast, pancreatic, and bladder cancers, as well as certain lymphomas, leukemias, and myeloma (16). AurA overexpression 
in human cancers has been correlated with increased aneuploidy and centrosome amplification (16,17). Second, forced overexpression of AurA kinase in experimental 
models results in the transformation of normal cells, suggesting that AurA overexpression may be oncogenic (15). Lastly, in a number of different experimental systems, AurA 
inhibition leads to mitotic delays and severe chromosome alignme nt and segregation defects, 
followed by [CONTACT_283511] ( 18-20). Overall, the essential role of AurA in mitotic progression 
and its dysregulation in certain cancers makes it an attractive therapeutic target.   
 Given the obligatory role of mitosis in tumor proliferation, an AurA inhibitor would be expected to have potential applications across a broad range of human tumors.  Indeed, alisertib has demonstrated activity against a variety of nonclinical solid tumor and 
hematological malignancy models grown in vitro  and in vivo , as described below.  Alisertib

V4 25July2018 37 is also expected to be toxic to proliferating normal tissues, such as the bone marrow, 
gastrointestinal (GI) epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], and hair follicles because any cell that is in mitosis, where AurA is expressed and active, should be susceptible to the effects of an AurA kinase inhibitor.  
6.1.1  Alisertib In Vitro  Studies  
Alisertib is an ATP -competitive and reversible inhibitor of AurA kinase in vitro  with an 
inhibition constant (Ki) of 0.43 nM. The data from both enzymatic and cell- based assays 
demonstrated that alisertib is a selective and potent inhibitor of AurA kinase. Alisertib inhibited proliferation of a wide variety of tumor cell lines grown in culture. Moreover, treatme nt of tumor cell lines with alisertib induced phenotypes consistent with AurA kinase 
inhibition, including mitotic spi[INVESTIGATOR_226991], mitotic delay, and apoptosis ( 21-24) . For 
further details, refer to the Investigators’ Brochure (IB).   
6.1.2     Alisertib In Vivo  Studies  
Alisertib demonstrated antitumor activity when administered orally on a daily basis for approximately 21 days (maximal tumor growth inhibition [TGI] > 90%) i n several 
experimental human solid and hematologic tumor models grown as xenografts in immunocompromised mice. The maximally efficacious dose (ED) for each model varied: between 10 and 30 mg/kg if given once daily (QD) and 20 mg/kg if given twice daily (BI D). 
Studies in the HCT-116 colon tumor model showed that less frequent dosing (eg, 5 days on followed by 5 days off) was also efficacious, demonstrating that continuous dosing is not necessary for antitumor activity. A single oral dose of alisertib given t o nude mice 
bearingsubcutaneous HCT-116 human colon tumors resulted in inhibition of activated AurA kinase and an increase in mitotic cells. Therefore, mitotic index (MI) can be used as a pharmacodynamic marker of alisertib in some in vivo settings. The re lationship between 
pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and efficacy was further studied in HCT-116 xenografts using oral dosing and subcutaneous osmotic mini-pumps. Both a pharmacodynamic response and efficacy (antitumor activity) were achieved using either route of administration. The data from these studies suggest that the maximum pharmacodynamic effect (mitotic accumulation) and efficacy are achieved at steady state plasma concentrations of 1- µM. Moreover, the maximally efficacious oral doses of al isertib 
in the HCT-116 model (30 mg/kg QD) resulted in plasma concentrations of 1 µM for 8 to 12 hours postdose. Plasma concentrations of alisertib associated with saturating levels of pharmacodynamic and antitumor activity (1 μM) were exceeded at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of alisertib in patients (50 mg BID).  To determine whether alisertib would enhance the antitumor effects of standard of care agents in solid and hematologic malignancies, nonclinical combination studies were performed. Combinat ion therapy with alisertib and docetaxel resulted in additive or 
synergistic effects during the dosing period, with prolonged tumor growth delay in multiple solid tumor xenograft models after terminating treatment. These effects were also observed in alter native intermittent dosing schedules. In DLBCL xenograft models, combination 
therapy with alisertib and rituximab resulted in synergistic, additive, or subadditive effects

6.1.3    Alisertib Safety Pharmacology, Toxicology, and Drug Metabolism 
Safety pharmacology studies with alisertib did not identify significant adverse effects in nonclinical studies, including in the central nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular systems. No alisertib -related effects on clinical signs or physical examination findings 
indicative of impaired respi[INVESTIGATOR_4806] (ie, labored or shallow breathing), or microscopic changes in the lungs of animals that survived until scheduled termination, were noted at tolerated doses in Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) -compliant, repeat-dose, toxicology 
studies. Alisertib exhibited minimal activity against the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_845050], which is encoded by [CONTACT_283512] (IC50 and Ki > 100 µM). Alisertib had in vitro  activity against 
the GABAAα1 benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_226993] (Ki = 290 nM).  The dose- limiting toxicities (DLTs) for alisertib in both rats and dogs after repeat d aily oral 
dosing for 2 cycles (each cycle consisted of 7 consecutive days separated by a 14 -day dose 
holiday) or for 6 cycles (each cycle consisted of 21 consecutive days of dosing separated by a 7-day dose holiday) were consistent with inhibition of AurA kinase by [CONTACT_227033]. Principal 
findings in toxicology studies in rats and dogs included gastrointestinal (GI) signs, panleukopenia, decreased reticulocyte counts, and increased mitotic figures and apoptosis (single -cell necrosis) in tissues with a high bas al cellular replication rate. These findings are 
indicative of toxicity to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_845051]. No off- target effects were seen in the 
GLP -compliant toxicology studies.Alisertib was negative in the bacterial reverse mutation 
assay (Ames assay) both in the absence and presence of Aroclor™ 1254-induced rat liver S9 fractions. In a rat bone marrow micronucleus assay, alisertib was considered to be equivocal for clastogenicity.  
 Alisertib is metabolized by [CONTACT_283513] I (cytochrome P450 [CYP]3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP1A2) and phase II (uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase [UGT] 1A1, 1A3, and 1A8) enzymes.  Using human liver microsomes with the appropriate cofactors, the percent contribution of CYP and UGT was calculated to be 13.1% and 86.9%, 
respectively, showing that CYP isozymes play a minor role in the metabolism of MLN8237.  MLN8237 is unlikely to inhibit the 5 major CYP enzymes, 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4/5 (IC50 > 100 μM) when administered at the projected human efficacious dose.  MLN8237 is not a mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP3A4/5.  Alisertib inhibited the P glycoprotein (Pgp)- mediated efflux of paclitaxel (Taxol®) in Caco 2 cells with an IC50 of 
4.0 μM.  Detailed information regarding the nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology of alisertib may be found in the IB.  
 
6.1.4 Alisertib Clinical Experience  
As of 29 March 2012, the following company-sponsored alisertib studies were in progress or completed: 6  single -agent phase 1 studies, 3 single-agent phase 2 studies, 1 single- agent

[COMPANY_005] Protocol X31023  
Confidential   
V4 25July2018 39 phase 1/2 study, and 3 combination studies.  Alisertib for clinical studies is being developed 
in 2 dosage formulations:  Enteric- coated -tablet (ECT) and oral solution (OS).  The dose-
escalation, phase 1 study, C14007, evaluated multiple dose levels from 10 to 60 mg BID for 7 days in repeat, 21-day cycles and 50 mg BID has been determined to be the MTD.  Alisertib is structurally related to the benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] (BZD) (eg, diazepam, lorazepam) and also has activity against the GABAAα1 BZD receptor.  BZD-like effects (eg, somnolence, confusion, memory loss) have been observed to be associated with the onset of maximal plasma concentration (eg, Tmax [time to maximum plasma concentratio n]).  CNS effects 
associated with peak plasma levels have been generally managed by [CONTACT_683606] (eg, BID administration), although dose reductions have sometimes been required.  While CNS effects attributed to alisertib were also generally reversible and manageable by [CONTACT_283515], the causal relationship, and thus optimal approach to management, were sometimes confounded by [CONTACT_683607], but not limited to, concomitant medications (eg, narcotic analgesics, antianx iety medications), comorbidities 
(eg, infection, anemia, electrolyte abnormalities), or progressive malignancy (eg, brain metastases).  The clinical experience with alisertib includes treatment with multiple doses and schedules and is summarized in the IB.    
6.1.[ADDRESS_1174491], with peak plasma concentrations generally achieved by 3 hours postdose. Negligible urinary excretion of alisertib was observed in humans. The renal 
clearance of alisertib in humans was less than 0.1% of apparent oral clearance. Steady -state 
plasma exposures of alisertib increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner over the range of 5 to 200 mg/day in patients with advanced solid tumors. Overall mean steady state terminal half -life following multiple -dose administration in patients with 
nonhematologic malignancies was approximately 22 hours. The overall mean peak/trough ratios were 2.6 and 5.0 for BID and QD dosing, respectively. The overall mean accumulation ratios were 2.8 and 1.9 for BID and QD dosing, respectively. Pharmacokinetic steady -state conditions were approximately achieved by [CONTACT_2006] 7 following daily oral 
administration. The PK properties of alisertib in patients with hematologic malignancies 
were generally consistent with those observed in patients with nonhematologic malignancies. Based on PK and genotype data in patients with nonhematologic malignancies, there was a substantial overlap in exposures (dose- normalized steady -state 
area under the plasma concentration versus time curve [AUC]) of alisertib in patients with 0, 1, or 2 copi[INVESTIGATOR_23932]1A1 *[ADDRESS_1174492] dose. 
Negligible urinary excretion of alisertib was observed in humans. The renal clearance of alisertib in humans was less than 0.1% of apparent oral clearance. Steady -state plasma

terminal half -life following multiple -dose administration in patients with nonhematologic 
malignancies was approximately 2 2 hours. The overall mean peak/trough ratios were 2.6 
and 5.0 for BID and QD dosing, respectively. The overall mean accumulation ratios were 
2.8 and 1.9 for BID and QD dosing, respectively. Pharmacokinetic steady-state conditions were approximately achieved by [CONTACT_2006] 7 following daily oral administration.   Based on the results of a population PK analysis in 294 adult cancer patients, the apparent oral clearance of alisertib CL/F was unaffected by [CONTACT_654], body weight, BSA, or the UGT1A1 genotype (number of *28 alleles). These results support the use of a common fixed starting dose of alisertib independent of UGT1A1 genotype status, age or body size in the adult patient population, in the ongoing and planned clinical trials.  The absolute bioavailability of alisertib in humans has not been determined; however, the single -dose pharmacokinetics of a prototype oral solution formulation of alisertib (25- mg 
dose) were characterized in a cross -over relative bioavailability evaluation in Study C14010 
in [ADDRESS_1174493] to the timing of meals in future  clinical studies, unless otherwise specified in the clinical study 
protocol.  
6.1.6   Alisertib Potential Risks and Benefits  
Seven -hundred fourteen patients (excluding 13 patients from a company-sponsored, non- US 
IND study in Japan) have been treated with alisertib as of 29 March 2012. Clinical safety data includes experience from patients who received multiple cycles followed by [CONTACT_845072], and from patients who reduced or discontinued treatment. Based on the available clinical d ata, drug abuse, dependency, and drug withdrawal effects 
were not observed.   To date, the observed risks associated with alisertib treatment, as detailed in the Safety Management Attachment of the IB, include: (1) reversible myelosuppression including leukopenia, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia; 
(2) GI toxicity including stomatitis/mucositis/oral pain, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, diarrhea, and dehydration; (3) sedation, somnolence, confusional state, disorientation (and associated memory loss), and gait disturbances; (4) alopecia; (5) asthenia/fatigue; (6) fever, (7) infection, (8) abnormal liver function tests (including aspartate transaminase [AST], alanine transaminase [ALT], bilirubi n, alkaline phosphatase 
[ALP], and gamma glutamyl transferase [GGT]), and (9) rash, which may include bullous dermatitis, and palmar -plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome.While these toxicities are 
potentially associated with risk or discomfort to the patie nt, they are anticipated to be 
MLN0128/alisertib   
COMIRB [ADDRESS_1174494] received.  The clinical utility of these effects will be investigated in current and future studies.  
 This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, applicable regulatory requirements, and International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP), guidelines. 
6.2  Risk of MLN0128 and Alisertib Combination Therapy 
Overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_845052]0128 and alisertib, 
however, the risk of increased toxicity with combination therapy is possible. Dose limiting adverse events observed with MLN0128 treatment include mucositis, hyperglycemia, diarrhea and fatigue.  Dose limiting adverse events observed with alisertib treatment include 
myelosuppression and CNS depression. As described in Section 10.1 and Table 1, dosing will begin below the MTD for each agent in the dose escalation cohort.  Patients will be monitored for toxicity and management g uidelines are provided to facilitate early detection 
and rapid, appropriate management of toxicity. 
7. STUDY RATIONALE  
7.1  Alisertib and MLN0128 in TNBC 
Metastatic TNBC is a biologically heterogeneous disease and the development of active 
targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_845053] (25,26 ).  AurA plays a critical role in mitosis including functions in 
chromosome alignment, spi[INVESTIGATOR_221781], and cytokinesis ( 27,28).  It functions as an 
oncogene through the promotion of genetic instability ( 15) and over-expression of AurA has 
been linked to inferior outcomes in patients with early stage breast cancer ( 29).  Aurora 
kinase inhibitors (AKIs) are a promising class of drugs for the treatment of TNBC based on their anti- mitotic mechanism of action and  the high mitotic index observed in TNBC. ( 30). 
 Alisertib is an orally bioavailable, second -generation selective AKI with broad 
antiproliferative and anti- tumor activity in preclinical in vitro  and in vivo  TNBC models 
(23).  Alisertib treatment resulted in a G2/M cell cycle arrest and the induction of apoptosis 
in a subset of p53 wildtype and mutant sensitive TNBC cell lines ( 23). TP53 is the most 
commonly mutated gene in TNBC with an incidence of approximately 85% ( 31).  While the 
majority of mutations are missense mutations in the DNA binding domain, more complex mutations (ie frameshift and nonsense mutations) occur at a higher frequency in TNBC as 
compared to luminal breast cancers (32).  Mutations in p53 may abrogate its tumor 
suppressor function resulting in impairment of cell cycle arrest, DNA repair and apoptosis 
MLN0128/alisertib   
COMIRB 15 -1135 
[COMPANY_005] Protocol X31023  
Confidential   
V4 25July2018 42 (33).  AurA over-expression may lead to increased p53 degradation via phosphorylation of 
p53 at Ser315, leading to increased ubiquitination by [CONTACT_530530]2 ( 34). Furthermore, silencing of 
AurA resul ts in stabilization of p53 and a characteristic G 2/M cell cycle arrest (34).    
 
Sensitivity to the pro -apoptotic activity of alisertib in TNBC is mediated by [CONTACT_17588] p53 and the 
p53 family member p73.  Knock-down (KD) of either p53 or p73 using shRNA in the p53 wildtype CAL- 51 TNBC cell line led to an  increase in resistance to the antiproliferative and 
proapoptotic effects of MLN8237 ( 23). This shift to resistance was associated with an 
increase in senescence associated -β-galactosidase (SA -β-gal) activity and phenotypic 
features consistent with senescence (23). These findings support the induction of senescence 
as a mechanism for resistance to the anti -apoptotic effects of MLN8237 in cells lacking 
functional p53 or p73.    Alisertib is active against TNBC xenograft and patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) models where apoptosis is observed in sensitive models as detected by [CONTACT_51214]-3 staining (23).  Senescence and upreg ulation of genes in the PI3K/AKT/mTor pathway were 
observed in PDX models treated with alisertib to resistance.  This finding is consistent with an emerging body of literature supporting a critical role for mTOR in oncogenic and DNA-damage induced senescence (35). 
 Based on the role of mTOR in senescence and upregulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTor pathway in TNBC models resistant to AKIs, we investigated the combination of alisertib and the Torc1/2 inhibitor MLN0128 in TNBC PDX models.  The combination of MLN8237 and 
MLN0128 resulted in greater TGI as compared to either agent alone (Figure 3A), accompanied by [CONTACT_845073]5 expression (Figure 
3B) and a decreased senescence as evaluated by [CONTACT_192522] -β-gal and phenotypic changes (Figure 
3C).

continuous dosing.  This dose is 75% lower than the MTD of single agent milled MLN0128 
(4 mg) PO daily when administered in a continuous dosing schedule.  The starting dose of alisertib is 30 mg PO BID.  This dose is in the biologically active dose range and is 40% lower than the MTD of single agent alisertib (50 mg PO BID Days 1 -7 repeat every 21 
days).   
7.2  Correlative Studies  
Serial tumor biopsies will be performed in the Expansion Cohort Group 1 and Group 2.  Tumor tissue will be obtained prior to initiating study drug treatment, Cycle 1 Day 7, Cycle 2 Day 7 and at the time of progression in patients with an initial response t o treatment.  
Tissue samples will be processed, assayed and analyzed at the University of Colorado 
Cancer Center.  Testing will include immunohistochemistry (IHC), SA -β-gal staining, gene 
expression profiling and DNA mutation testing.  Other markers may be investigated 
depending on ongoing preclinical work.  Functional Imaging with diffusion- weighted MRI (DWI) and 5- fluoro -deoxy-glucose- PET 
(FDG -PET) will be performed at the University of Colorado Cancer Center in a subset of 
patients enrolled in Dose Expansion Groups 1 and 2 depending on the presence of tumor lesions amenable to imaging evaluation.  Oncologic imaging has evolved and now represents a  key diagnostic platform for cancer diagnosis and treatment. In addition to capabilities in determining tumor  size, molecular and physiologic imaging is now available 
in order to assess tumor metabolism, physiology and molecular targets non-invasively in  real time. As such, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) plays a crucial role in assessing tumor metabolic aggr essiveness by [CONTACT_845074] 18F- radioactive glucose 
analogue (FDG) which is up- regulated in TNBC and is a sensitive marker for treatment 
response to novel targeted agents. Tumor cellularity can be assessed by [CONTACT_845075] -weighted MRI (DWI) which is clinically used to assess tumor 
response to chemotherapy as a marker of apoptosis (36,37). These studies will be performed 
and analyzed by [CONTACT_845076], PhD (Associate Professor of Anesthesiology, Pharmacology and Radiology; Director, Colorado Clinical Translational Science Institute Imaging Core) and  her staff.

10.1    Overview of Study Design 
This is a Phase Ib open-label, single institution, dose- escalation study designed to evaluate 
the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of MLN0128 administered by [CONTACT_1966] (PO) in combination with alisertib administered PO to patients with advanced solid tumors and previously treated metastatic TNBC  and other solid tumors in an expansion cohort.  The 
initial schedule of MLN0128 administration will be on ce daily with continuous dosing.  If

10.2 Dose Escalation Cohort 
The starting dose for MLN0128 is 1 mg (milled formulation) PO once daily with con tinuous 
dosing.  This dose is 75% lower than the MTD of MLN0128 in the Ph1b/2 study C31001 which is 4 mg (milled formulation).  The starting dose of alisertib is 30 mg PO BID Days 1 -
7 repeat every 21 days.  This dose is 40% lower than the MTD of alisertib (50 mg) for this dosing schedule.  During Cycle [ADDRESS_1174504] dose of MLN0128 (Cycle 1 Day -7 to Cycle 1 Day 21).  Patients who withdraw from the study prior to completing the DLT assessment window for any reason other than a DLT will be replaced.  In addition, patients who miss a total of > [ADDRESS_1174505] 2 other Phase I Oncologists (co -investigators). Available adverse event 
data, laboratory assessments, ECGs, dose administration logs and PK parameters (when available) will be used to determine whether dose escalatio n should continue and, if so, at 
what dose level and schedule (see Table 1).  The dose escalation schema may be altered if toxicity is observed related to one agent which would favor escalation of the other agent.

Dose escalation will procede in accordance with the following rules (see Figure 1): 
• A minimum of 3 patients will be treated in each cohort.  
• If 0 patients experience a DLT in a cohort, dose escalation will proceed. 
• If [ADDRESS_1174506] 3 patients in a cohort experiences a DLT then 3 additional patients will be enrolled in that cohort. 
• If less than 1/3 of the evaluable patients in a cohort experience a DLT then escalation 
will proceed  
• If 1/3 or more evaluable patients in a cohort experience a DLT, then the MTD has 
been exceeded and the precedi ng dose level will be expanded to 6 evaluable patients 
(If [ADDRESS_1174507] not already been evaluated at that level).  Intermediate dose levels may be evaluated at the discretion of the Sponsor Investigator after discussion with the study team.  
• If the MTD is exceeded in the first dosing cohort, lower doses or alternate schedules 
of MLN0128 or alisertib will be evaluated as guided by [CONTACT_845077]. 
• If the MTD is exceeded at a given dose level then the next highest dose at which less than 1/3 of at leas t 6 evaluable patients experiences a DLT will be declared the 
MTD.

MLN0128 should be administered in continuous cycles, which should continue unless the 
patient has a Grade 3 or greater MLN0128 -related event. Guidelines for dose interruption and for dose reduction are as follows:
 
 
Criteria for Dose Interruption and Dose Modification During a Cycle  
Administration of MLN0128 should be withheld for MLN0128 treatment -related toxicities 
that are Grade [ADDRESS_1174531] clinical practice.  The following nonhematologic toxicities attributed to MLN0128 would not require dose interruption:  
• Grade 3 or high er nausea and/or emesis in the absence of optimal anti -emetic 
prophylaxis. (Optimal anti- emetic prophylaxis is defined as an anti -emetic regimen that 
employs both a 5-HT3 antagonist and a corticosteroid given in standard doses and 
according to standard sch edules.) 
• Grade 3 or higher diarrhea that occurs in the absence of optimal supportive therapy.  
 If the event resolves to Grade 1 or baseline values within 2 weeks of interrupting treatment, the patient may resume study treatment at a dose reduced by 1 level (see Table 1). Two dose 
reductions of MLN0128 will be allowed according to Table 1.  If further dose reduction is required from [ADDRESS_1174532] without dosing.  Dosing interruptions/delays of up to 14 days will be allowed for recovery from toxicities or inter -current illness. Longer 
interruptions can be considered if the patient is benef iting from therapy with 
MLN0128.Guidance for the management of common toxicities observed with MLN0128 hyperglycemia, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], oral mucositis, rash, nausea/vomiting, and non-infectious pneumonitis are outlined in Section 12.8.

Permanent discontinuation can be considered at the treating Investigator’s 
discretion.  
MLN0128/alisertib   
COMIRB [ADDRESS_1174533] meet the following criteria: 
• ANC mus t be  ≥ 1,500/mm3 
• Platelet count must be ≥ 75,000/mm3.   
• In addition, all toxicities considered by [CONTACT_845079] ≤ Grade 1 or to the patient’s baseline values before a new cycle of therapy may begin.  
If the patient fails to meet the above -cited criteria for retreatment, then initiation of the next 
cycle of therapy should be delayed for up to [ADDRESS_1174534] been met.  
Should treatment need to be delayed for more than 1 week (ie, a rest period of more than 21 days) because of incomplete recovery from treatment -related toxicity, the dose of alisertib 
should be reduced by [CONTACT_30560] (Table 1) when therapy resumes.  A second dose reduction may occur should treatment need to be delayed for more than [ADDRESS_1174535] without dosing.  Only 2 dose reductions of alisertib will be allowed according to Table 1. Dosing interuptions/delays of up to 14 days will be al lowed for recovery from toxicities or inter -current illness.  Longer 
interuptions can be considered if the patient is benefiting from therapy with alisertib.  
Growth factor support is permitted at the treating Investigator’s discretion following delay or neutropenic fever, but should not be used prophylactically during Cycle 1. 
12.4.1  Dose Modifications for Hematological Toxicity 
If a patient experiences any of the following hematological toxicities during the dosing 
period, dosing with alisertib will be discon tinued for the remainder of that cycle and the 
dose will be decreased 1 level for all subsequent cycles of treatment.  
• Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <  500 cells/mm3) lasting more than 7 consecutive days 
• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 25,000/µL) lasting more than 7 consecutive days 
• Platelet count less than 10,000/µL at any time

• Any Grade 3 nonhematological toxicity that is considered by [CONTACT_845080]: 
o Grade 3 or greater nausea or emesis, or both, that occurs in the absence of optimal antiemetic therapy (5 -hydroxytryptamine 3 [5- HT3] 
serotonin receptor antagonist); 
o Grade 3 or greater diarrhea that occurs in the absence of opt imal 
supportive therapy with loperamide or a comparable anti- diarrheal;  
• Grade 2 non- hematological toxicities that are considered by [CONTACT_227045][INVESTIGATOR_227004]. 
In general, study drug treatment should be discontinued if a patient experiences a Grade 4 
toxicity.  If, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_227005]’s interest 
to continue therapy with alisertib, then after recovery from the toxicity or toxi cities in 
question to ≤ Grade [ADDRESS_1174537] 1 dose level with subsequent cycles of therapy.  
When a dose reduction of alisertib is required, no re- escalation of dose will be permitted.  If 
a pat ient requires more than 2 dose reductions, therapy with alisertib will be discontinued.

12.8.1 Management of Hyperglycemia 
In addition to obtaining fasting serum glucose (FSG) levels at clinic visits, all subjects will 
be given a glucometer to monitor their daily pre-dose fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels at home.  Subjects will be instructed to notify the study staff immediately with any abnormal readings (ie, ≥ 150 mg/dL) for further instructions on the management of their hyperglycemia.  Hyperglycemia observed during home glucose monitoring should be confirmed in the clinic.  Investigators will be responsible for reviewing the home glucose monitoring logs for hyperglycemia.  If no irregularities in the fasting blood glucose level are observed during a minimum of 6 consecutive months, then the frequency of in-home fasting glucose testing  may be reduced to twice weekly if the investigator approves.  Subjects will 
continue to notify the investigator of fasting blood glucose levels that exceed 150 mg/dL and, if blood glucose levels are not well-controlled, or if the subject requires either oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin to control blood glucose levels, then the frequency of in-home testing of fasting blood glucose levels will be reinstated to daily.

V4 25July2018 64 In the event that any FSG reading performed at the site indicates hyperglycemia (> upper 
limit of normal [ULN] or ≥ 110 mg/dL), the study staff should first ascertain that the subject was fasting at the time of the blood draw (ie, nothing by [CONTACT_24314] 8 hours prior to blood being obtained), had continued to take their concomitant anti glycemic medications 
should the subject have underlying diabetes mellitus, and repeat the FSG as needed.  If the repeat FSG continues to demonstrate hyperglycemia, investigators should initiate steps to aggressively manage the hyperglycemia per standard cl inical practice.  The following 
guidelines are provided to aid the investigator in initiating antiglycemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Based on the clinical experience from MLN0128 trials, most epi[INVESTIGATOR_845057] [ADDRESS_1174548] their glucose closely monitored by [CONTACT_464].  The investigator may choose either to continue close monitoring of subjects who develop Grade 1 hyperglycemia (FSG  > ULN  ≤ 160 mg/dL) or, alternatively, consider initiating treatment with an oral 
hypoglycemic agent, such as metformin.  All subjects with Gr ade ≥ 2 hyperglycemia 
(FSG  > 160 mg/dL) must be treated aggressively with oral hypoglycemic agents and/or 
insulin as clinically indicated while continuing on MLN0128.  The investigator should consult an endocrinologist if needed to aid in optimizing the subject’s hyperglycemia treatment plan.  
It is recommended that subjects be treated initially with a fast acting, insulin sensitizer, such as metformin at 500 mg PO QD, and titrate up to a maximum of 1000 mg PO BID as needed.  Concurrent addition to metformin of DPP -4 inhibitors (eg, sitagliptin or 
vildagliptin) and/or insulin should also be considered.  Oral sulfonylureas (eg, glipi[INVESTIGATOR_53289]) should be used with caution due to the higher risk of inducing hypoglycemia in subjects.  The dose of oral hypoglycemic agents should be adjusted in subjects with renal insufficiency. In addition, patients should also  be encouraged to follow a low carbohydrate 
diet once hyperglycemia is first observed.  
 Guidance on study drug dose modification for patients with hyperglycemia is provided in the following table

12.9  Management of Clinical Events Related to alisertib 
12.9.1  Management of Central Nervous System Effects 
If a patient experiences excessive sedation believed to be related to alisertib, treatment with 
alisertib should be interrupted.  Patients whose sedation is not considered immediately life-threatening should be carefully monitored and given appropriate supportive care. 
If the patient’s level of consciousness is considered to be life- threatening, necessary 
measures should be instituted to secure the airway, ventilation, and intravenous access.  
Flumazenil (Romazic on
®) is a selective benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_845064], not as a substitute for, the proper management of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_80311].  Although there is neither preclinical nor clinical experience with flumazenil and alisertib, the use of flumazenil should be considered if the level of alisertib- associated sedation is 
considered to be life-threatening.  Patients treated with flumazenil should be monitored for resedation, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], and other residual benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_845065].  Continued monitoring is particularly important in the

13.    STATISTICAL AND QUANTITATIVE ANALYSES  
13.1    Statistical Methods  
Primary Objective:   
The MTD will be defined as the highest dose level evaluated in which 0 or 1 patient out of 6 
patients experiences DLT.  
Secondary Objectives:  
1. Safety:  Adverse events will be tabulated by [CONTACT_16624].  
2. Pharmacokinetics:  The AUC and Cmax will be determined for MLN0128 and MLN8237.  The distribution of these parameters for MLN0128 when administered with MLN8237 and for MLN8237 when administered with MLN0128 will be compared to the appropriate single agent administration control data.  
3. Translational Endpoints:  All analyses with respect to the translational component of this study are intended to be hypothesis- generating and descriptive in manner.  Biologic 
correlates will be obtained from tumor biopsies as outlined above.  Baseline levels of these markers will be correlated with clinical outcome (i.e. response, time to progression, and adverse events) using regression methods (Cox model for tie to event, logistic reg ression for 
binary outcome, Poisson regression for counts).  Additionally, the dynamic change in markers will be assessed from baseline to Cycle 1 Day 7 and Cycle 2 Day 7 in both Expansion Cohort Groups using repeated measures/mixed models analysis.  For t he 
functional imaging performed in select patients in the Dose Expansion Groups, FDG- PET 
images will be analyzed with AsiProVM and mean change in SUV will be compared to baseline.  For DCE -MRI analysis, the AUC for the gadolinium versus time curve and the 
initial AUC will be calculated using the trapezoidal rule in Microsoft Excel.  Data will be

4. Efficacy:  Analysis of efficacy measures will be descriptive.  The best overall 
response will be summarized using the number and percent of patients in each tumor 
response category along with the two-sided exact binomial 95% confidence intervals. Time to progression will be defined as the time from the first day of treatment to the first observation of disease progression.  If a patient dies without documentation of disease progression, the patient will be considered to have had tumor progression at the time of their death unless there is sufficient documented evidence to conclude no progression occurred 
prior to death.  The distribution of disease- free survival will be estimated using the method

and efficacy information  in this patient population.  Escalation to the next dose cohort will 
depend on the probability of DLT at a given dose.  When 1 of 3 patients develops a DLT and the cohort is expanded to 6 patients, the proposed plan for dose escalation provides a 91% probability that dose escalation will proceed at doses associated with DLT probability of < 10%.
 
 A maximum of 6 patients can be enrolled at each dose level.  With 6  potential dose levels 
and an Expansion Cohort of 30 patients with TNBC, the maximum number of patients that can be enrolled is 56 and the minimum number is 6.  The total planned enrollment in the expansion study is up to approximately 30 patients in  
three cohort groups. This sample size will provide a reasonable chance (> 75%) of   
observing at least one or more adverse events when the true frequency of the adverse  event is between 10%−15% at the given dose level. Specifically, for a given adverse event   
with a true rate of 15%, 10%, 5%, or 1%, the probability of observing at least one such  adverse event in the combined cohort of 20 patients is 99%, 86%, 64%, or 18%, respectively In addition, assessment of the response rate in 20 patients will exclude with 95% confidence,  a true response rate of 15% or higher if no response is observed.

V4 25July2018 78 14. ADVERSE EVENTS    
14.1    Definitions  
14.1.1    Adverse Event Definition  
Adverse event (AE) means any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product; the untoward medical occurrence does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product whether or not it is related to the medicinal product.  This includes any newly occurring event, or a previous condition that has increased in sever ity or frequency since the administration of 
study drug. 
An abnormal laboratory value will not be assessed as an AE unless that value leads to 
discontinuation or delay in treatment, dose modification, therapeutic intervention, or is considered by [CONTACT_845083] a clinically significant change from baseline.    
14.1.2    Serious Adverse Event Definition  
Serious AE (SAE) means any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death.  
• Is life-threatening (refers to an AE in which the patient was at risk of death at the 
time of the event.  It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe).  
• Requires inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324]  
(see clarification  in the paragraph below on planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]). 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity . (Disability is defined 
as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions). 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect . 
• Is a medically important event .  This refers to an AE that may not result in death, 
be immediately life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may be considered serious when, based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient, require medical or surgical intervention to prevent [ADDRESS_1174561] of an infectious agent.   Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse; any organism, virus, or infectious particle (eg, prion protein transmitting Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy), pathogenic or nonpathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent.

COMIRB 15 -1135 
[COMPANY_005] Protocol X31023  
Confidential   
V4 25July2018 79 Clarification should be made between a serious AE (SAE) and an AE that is considered 
severe in intensity (Grade 3 or 4), because the terms serious and severe are NOT synonymous.  The general term severe is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event; the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a Grade 3 headache).  This is NOT the same as serious , which is based on 
patient/event outcome or action criteria described above, and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or ability to function.  A severe AE (Grade 3 or 4) does not necessarily need to  be considered serious.  For example, a white blood cell count of 
1000/mm
3 to less than 2000 is considered Grade 3 (severe) but may not be considered 
serious.  Seriousness (not intensity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
14.2    Procedures for Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse Events  may be spontaneously identified  by [CONTACT_5363]/or in response to an 
open question from study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination, or other diagnostic procedures.  Any clinically relevant deterioration in laboratory assessments or other clinical finding is considered an AE.  When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event.   
Adverse Events which are serious must be reported to Millennium Pharmacovigilance (or 
designee) from the time of consent up to and including [ADDRESS_1174562] of MLN0128 or alisertib . Any SAE that occurs at any time after completion of 
MLN0128 treatment or after the designated follow -up period that the sponsor-investigator 
and/or sub-investigator considers to be related to any study drug must be reported to Millennium Pharmacovigilance (or designee).  Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_432356] (e.g., surgery was performed earlier or later than planned).  All SAEs should be monitored until they are resolved or are clearly determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic condition or intercurrent illness(es). 
Since this is an investigator -initiated study, the sponsor-investigator Jennifer R. Diamond, 
MD, also referred to as the sponsor-investigator, is responsible for reporting serious adverse 
events (SA Es) to any regulatory agency and to the sponsor- investigator’s EC or IRB.   
Regardless of expectedness or causality, all SAEs must also be reported in English to 
Millennium Pharmacovigilance or designee: 
• Fatal and Life Threatening SAEs: within 24 hours of the sponsor-investigator’s 
observation or awareness of the event 
• All other serious (non -fatal/non life threatening) events: within 4 calendar days 
of the sponsor-investigator’s observation or awareness of the event  
The Sponsor will send all SAE reports to Millennium Pharmacovigilance (or designee) 
within  [ADDRESS_1174563] include at minimum:  
• Event term(s)

Confidential   
V4 25July2018 80 • Serious criteria  
• Intensity of the event(s): Sponsor-investigator’s or sub-investiga tor’s 
determination.   Intensity for each SAE, including any lab abnormalities, will 
be determined by [CONTACT_128751], as a 
guideline, whenever possible.  The criteria are available online at http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html. 
• Causality of the event(s): Sponsor-investigator’s or sub-investigator’s 
determination of the relationship of the event(s) to MLN0128 and alisertib administration.  
Follow-up information on the SAE may be requested by [CONTACT_759257] (or designee) .   
In the event that this is a multisite study, the sponsor -investigator is responsible to ensure 
that the SAE reports are sent to Millennium Pharmacovigilance (or designee) from all sites participating in the study.  Sub -investigators must report all SAEs to  the sponsor-
investigator so that the sponsor-investigator can meet his/her foregoing reporting obligations to the required regulatory agencies and to Millennium Pharmacovigilance, unless otherwise agreed between the sponsor-investigator and sub- investigat or(s).   
Relationship to all study drugs for each SAE will be determined by [CONTACT_9940] -
investigator by [CONTACT_91854]: Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE is associated with the study drug(s)?

16.  DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
The Sponsor Investigator will be responsible for monitoring the trial per the trial monitoring plan, in addition to overseeing the safety and efficacy of the trial, executing the DSM plan, and complying with all reporting requirements to local and federal authorities. This oversight will be accomplished through additional oversight from the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) at the University of Colorado Cancer Center (CU Cancer Center).  The DSMC is responsible for ensuring data quality and patient safety for all clinical studie s at the CU Cancer Center.   A summary of the DSMC’s activities is as 
follows: 
• Conduct of internal audits  
• Ongoing review of all serious adverse events (SAEs), unanticipated problems (UAPs) and reportable adverse events (AEs)  
• Has the authority to close and/ or suspend trials for safety or trial conduct issues

Per the CU Cancer Center Institutional DSM Plan, SAEs, UAPs and reportable AEs are reported to the DSMC, IRB and the sponsor per protocol.  All SAEs, UAPs and reportable AEs are to be reported to the DSMC within [ADDRESS_1174567]’s treatment outcomes will be discussed by [CONTACT_455110] (CRCs) at weekly disease -oriented working group meetings.  Data 
regarding number of subjects, significant toxicities, dose modifications, and treatment responses will be discussed and documented in the meeting’s minutes.  The Sponsor Investigator will provide a DSM report to the CU Cancer Center DSMC on a six month basis. The DSM report will include a protocol summary; current enrollment numbers; summary of toxicity data to include specific SAEs, UAPs and AEs; any dose modifications; all protocol deviations; and protocol amendments. The DSM report to the DSMC will also include, if applicable, the results of any efficacy data analysis conducted, as well as any internal DSMB reports.

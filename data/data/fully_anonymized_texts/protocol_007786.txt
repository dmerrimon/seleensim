Protocol  Date:  10/03/2019 3 1. Background 
 
Lung  Cancer  and Indeterminate Pulmonary  Nodules  (IPNs ): The estimated  number  of patients  
with  newly  diagnosed  lung cancer  in the US for 2013  is 228,190 (118,080 men  and 110,110  
women),  with  an estimated  159,480  deaths  (87,260  men,  72,220  women).  Lung cancer  now  is, 
and will be for years  to come,  the leading  cause  of cancer  death  in both  the US and the world.  The 
five-year  relative  cancer  survival of all stages  and all types  combined  (2002 -2008)  ranges  from  
17%  for lung cancer  to nearly  100%  for prostate  cancer  (1). The future  U.S. cancer  burden,  
estimated  from  the current  and projected  size and age demographics  of the U.S. population,  is 
expected  to more  than  double  from  1.[ADDRESS_673609]  3.0 million  in 2050.  The lifetime  
risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_519301]/bronchus  is 1 in 12 for men  and 1 in 16 for women  (2). The 
primary  risk factor  for lung cancer  is smoking,  with  the percentage of the southeastern  US 
population  estimated  to be smokers  significantly  higher  than  for the general US population,  with  
correspondingly  higher  incidence  and death  rates  from  all tobacc o-related  cancers . 
 
Two  c
ontributors  to the high  mortality  of lung cancer  are the frequent  advanced stage  of the 
disease  when  discovered  and the delay  in diagnosis  of cancer  in a newly  discovered  IPN. This delay  
in definitive  diagnosis  of an IPN can potentially  allow  time  for metastasis  to occur  during the 
follow -up interval.  The exciting  results  of the National  Lung Screening Trial  (NLST ) demonstrated  
an approximately  20%  reduction  in lung cancer  specific  mortality  via low-dose  computed  
tomography  (LDCT ) screening of high -risk patients.  As a result,  the US Preventive Services  Task  
Force  has recommended  annual  LDCT  screening for an estimated  7.4 million  Americans  at high 
risk for lung cancer  (3). However,  even  in high -risk patients,  most  IPNs  were  benign.  Specifically,  
24.2%  of LDCT  screening scans  had IPNs  requiring  further  evaluation  (usually  serial CTs for up to 
2 years),  with  96.4%  of these positive  screening CTs eventually  found to be false  positive  (4). 
Furthermore,  8.3%  of all positive  scans  had a subsequent  18F-FDG  PET/CT  scan  as part of the 
diagnostic  process. Since  IPNs  in high  risk patients  must  be followed  with  serial LDCT  exams  (5), 
a
nd guidelines  suggest  diagnosis  with  18F-FDG -PET/CT  scans for lesions  larger than  [ADDRESS_673610]  
a greater than  a 5% likelihood  of cancer  (6), patients  may  receive  up to [ADDRESS_673611]  scans, 
and possibly  an 18F-FDG  PET/CT  scan,  to follow  an IPN.  These subseq uent  scans  are at 
considerable  time/expense  to both  the patient  and the healthcare  system,  when  over  96%  of 
these nodules  will be benign.  The economic  burden  of this disease  is staggering.  The annual  cost 
of >150,000  deaths/y  in the US f rom lung cancer  is >$12  billion  (7). The estimated  cost of lung  
cancer  screening in the US is up to $2 billion/y. The subsequent  management  of IPNs,  requiring  
serial CT scans , and sometimes  invasive  biopsies  or surgical resection,  is estimated  to be many  
times  greater,  perhaps  as much  as $240,000  per additional lung cancer  death  avoided,  when  
allowing  for the costs  of no screening and overdiagnosis  (8). 
 Disease  Management : One management  option  for newly  diagnosed  indeterminate  lung nodules  
is “watchful  waiting”  to see if the nodule  increases  in size over  a two-year  period,  with  the obvious  
caveat  that during this time  cells  from  a malignant  nodule  could metastasize,  resulti ng in the lost 
chance  of a cure.  The other  option,  proceeding to tissue diagnosis  at the time  of discovery,  is often  
inappropriate  for several reasons. While  bronchoscopy  with  brush cytology  or transbronchial  
biopsy  may  be useful  if the lesion  is 2 cm or larger in size,  the reported  diagnostic  yield  of 
bronchoscopy  for a solitary  pulmonary  nodule  varies  widely  in the literature  (20-80%)  and 
depends  on the size of the nodule,  the incidence  of malignancy  in the study  population,  and the 
skill of the operator.  Transthoracic  fine needle  aspi[INVESTIGATOR_519302] 1524: [18F]FSPG PET Protocol  
  
 
 
   
Protocol  Date:  10/03/[ADDRESS_673612]  2 cm. False  negative  results,  
occurring  in up to 30%  of the patients,  remain  a serious  clinical problem.  Unfortu nately,  the 
success rate of diagnosis  is inversely  related  to nodule  size,  and yet the greatest  hope  for cure  lies 
in detecting  cancer  as early  as possible,  presumably  in smaller  nodules.  Thus,  a definitive  biopsy  
often  requires  surgical resection,  via video-assisted thoracoscopic  surgery  (VATS) or open  
thoracotomy,  since  less invasive  techniques  have  unacceptably  high  false  negative rates  (9-11). 
 
Therapy: Resection  of early  stage  disease  remains  the only  proven  means  to improve  long- term  
survival from  lung cancer.  Although  the smoking  rate in the US is decreasing,  it remains  
unacceptably  high.  The risk of lung cancer  accordingly  will remain  elevated  for many  years  due to 
smoking  prevalence,  general  demographics,  and potential  exposure  to other  inhaled  carcinogens  
(1). Additionally,  now  that lung cancer  screening of high  risk individuals  is adopted in the US, the 
capacity  of the US Healthcare  System  is severely  strained  to meet  demand.  Nonetheless,  low-dose  
annual  CT screening for lung  cancer  in high -risk patients  is the only  proven  means  to reduce  lung  
cancer  deaths,  with  a 20%  reduction  in cancer -specific  mortality  (4). 
 T
he US Preventative Services  Task  Force has endorsed LDCT  lung cancer  screening for high  risk 
patients  as an effective  means  of reducing lung cancer  deaths,  with  a “B” level  recommendation,  
equal  to that of screening mammography.  Thus,  most  US medical facilities  already  offer  low-dose  
lung cancer  screening programs  (12), and both  medical and public  advocacy  societies  have  
endorsed  lung cancer  screening,  including the American  Cancer Society,  American  College  of 
Chest  Physicians,  American  College  of Radiology,  American  Society  of Clinical Oncology,  the 
National Comprehensive  Cancer  Network  (NCCN),  the American  Lung Association  and others  (13). 
In 2015, the Center  for Medicare  and Medic aid Services  (14) began  to reimburse  LDCT  in high -risk 
patients  within  the Medicare  population . It is estimated  that approximately  four  million  Medicare  
beneficiaries  fit the eligibility  criteria  for screening,  which  includ es adults  age [ADDRESS_673613]  
a thirty  pack/year smoking  history  and are either  currently  smoking  or have  quit in the past  15 
years  (14). While  the specific  number  of lives  saved  annually  in the US by [CONTACT_519322],  prevalence  of lung cancer  in the local 
screened  population,  and the effectiveness  of associated  smoking -cessation  programs,  the 
number  is estimated  to be about  12,000  annually  (15). In a ddition , under  the Affordable  Care  Act, 
private  medical  insurance  is required  to cover  lung cancer  screening  with  no co-pay as of 2015 . 
Accordingly,  the number  of new  IPNs  discovered  annually  in the US will increase  several fold,  
reaching  into the millions. Clearly  the management  of IPNs  in the US population  is a complex  and 
resource -intensive  task.  As the US Healthcare  System  increasingly  adopts  lung cancer  screening,  
improved  means  of managing  IPNs  will be urgently  needed.  
 Positron  emission  tomography  (PET)  imaging  in lung  cancer : Imaging  with  computed  
tomography  (CT) (either  at a single  time  point  or serially  over  time)  or with  positron  emission 
computed  tomography  combined  with  CT (PET/CT) can help  to discriminate  between  benign  and 
malignant  nodules,  yet the best  image -based  methods  are also inexact,  with  both  false  positive  
(FP) and false  negative ( FN) results  leading  to unnecessary  surgery  or missed early  diagnosis,  
respectively.  Collective  experience  with  the most  widely  used  PET tracer  in oncology,  2-deoxy -2-
(
18F)-fluoro -D-glucose  (18F-FDG), a probe  that measures  glucose  utilization,  has been  variable.  18F-
FDG  PET possesses  limited  ability  to discriminate  between  benign  and malignant  lung nodules  less 
than  1 cm in diameter,  as well as limited  value  in relatively  quiescent  lung cancers,  such  as well-
differentiated  adenocarcin oma  or typi[INVESTIGATOR_519303]  (16). T he  sensitivity  of PET scanning  
THO 1524: [18F]FSPG PET Protocol  
  
 
 
   
Protocol  Date:  10/03/2019 5 for small lesions  drops  significantly  to around  60%  (17). In lesions  smaller  than  1 cm, o nly very  
intense  18F-FDG  uptake  is clearly  perceived.  Nomori,  et al. (18), examined  [ADDRESS_673614] -of-care  18F-
FDG  PET,  eight  (40%)  of which  were  malignant. This problem  is compounded by [CONTACT_519323]  (FP) 
uptake  of 18F-FDG  in IPNs.  Much  of the US population  lives  in areas  with  endemic  fungal  disease,  
such  as histoplasmosis,  coccid ioidomycosis  and cryptococcus.  Vanderbilt  University  Medical  
Center  (VUMC ) is in the Ohio/Mississippi  [INVESTIGATOR_519304],  where  coccidiomycosis  and 
histoplasmosis  are particularly  common.  Other  large  segments  of the US population  are in other  
areas  of endemic  fungal  disease,  such  as the entire southwestern  US, including southern  
[LOCATION_004]. In our prospective  analysis  of 211 patients  referred  to our thoracic  oncolog y, thoracic  
surgery  and/or  pulmonary  medicine  services,  the sensitivity  of 18F-FDG  PET/CT  was good  (92%) 
but the specificity  was only  40%,  with  60%  of benign  nodules  having FP uptake  (19). Nearly  
identical results  were  reported  from  another  location  in the Ohio/Mississippi  [INVESTIGATOR_519305], et al. at the University  of Iowa  (20). 
 
Hi
ghly proliferative  cells,  as found  in most  lung cancers,  utilize  Warburg  metabolism  to both  
provide  energy  and building blocks  needed for cellular proliferation.  This is an effect  shared  with  
all proliferating  eukaryotic  cells,  but particularly  expre ssed in aggressive  malignancies,  providing  
the target  of metabolism  exploited  with  18F-FDG  PET/CT.  Unfortunately,  other  non-malignant  cells  
with  high  glucose  consumption,  such  as macrophages,  particularly  found  in granulomatous  
nodules,  also have  high  uptake  of 18F-FDG  (21). These  two factors  often  lead  to the “false  positive”  
uptake  on 18F-FDG  PET/CT  scans  in areas  of endemic  fungal  and other  granulomatous  nodules  
(22). This,  of course,  explains  the high  sensitivity  of 18F-FDG  PET/CT  imaging  of IPNs , along  with  its 
poor  specificity  (~40%) , observed  in many  areas  of the US. 
 Patients  with  newly  discovered  IPNs  (often  by “accident”  when  an x-ray or CT scan  is performed  
for an unrelated  reason)  may  be at high  risk for lung cancer.  Patients  with  IPNs  or lung cancer  
typi[INVESTIGATOR_456124]  a significant  smoking  history,  are often  current  smokers, and commonly  have  other  
tobacco -related  co-morbidities  such  as COPD,  emphysema  and/or cardiovascular disease  that 
greatly  impair their  functional  status  and confer  high  risk for interventional procedures  needed  to 
establish  a definitive  diagnosis . 
 D
ifferentiation  of a benign  from  a malignant  lung nodule  is imperfect  at the time  of IPN discove ry. 
No combination  of CT characteristics  can definitively  determine  if a given  IPN is benign  or 
malignant  (23, 24). While  18F-FDG  PET/CT  is helpful,  it can be confounded by 
[CONTACT_80601]/inflammation,  small nodule  size,  metabolically  indolent  cancers , and ground -glass  or 
part-solid  nodules.  Moreover,  in much  of the United  States,  a variety  of fungi  and other  
granulomatous  processes confound  CT further , with  most of the tracer  uptake in active  
granulomatous  nodules  relegated  to inflammatory  stroma . Therefore,  an improved  means  to 
discriminate  benign  from  malignant  IPNs  at the time  of discovery  is badly  needed.

Protocol  Date:  10/03/[ADDRESS_673615]  a great  
need  to improve  upon  the 40%  specificity  of 18F-
FDG  PET/CT  for diagnosis  of lung nodules  in 
regions  of endemic  granulo matous  infections,  
yet without  sacrificing  18F-FDG’s  ~90%  
sensitivity,  particularly  in the context  of 
nationwide  lung cancer  screening.  
 
Figure  1.  A Diagnostic  PET Tracer  of Cancer  
Cell Metabolism  (18F-FSPG) : Tumor  cells  adopt  
distinct  metabolic  pathways  to ensure a 
sufficient  supply  of energy  and building  blocks  
for growth  and proliferation.  There is 
emerging  evidence  for the existence of a 
tumor -specific  truncated tricarboxylic  acid 
cycle  (25) associated with  a high  rate  of 
lipogenesis and glutaminolysis  from  glutamine 
and glutamate  (26). As a result  of the 
truncated TCA cycle,  glutamine  and glutamate  are often  major  metabolic  substrates  of tumor  
cells  in parallel  or even  instead  of glucose -derived  metabolites  like pyruvate.  Targeting those  
tumor -specific  pathways  with  18F-labeled tracers represents a promising  approach for 
improved PET imaging of tumors.  
 (S)-4-(3-[
18F]-fluoropropyl) -L-glutamic  acid (18F-FSPG)  is a new  18F-labeled  radiotracer designed  for 
positron  emission tomography  (PET)  imaging  of tumors  (Fig. 1). 18F-FSPG  (originally  [18F]BAY  94-
9392)  is an 18F-labeled  glutamic  acid derivative  originally  identified  to target  tumor -specific  
adaptations  of intermediary  metabolism.  18F-FSPG  is specifically  taken  up via the system  xC- 
transporter,  a glutamate -cystine  exchanger  (SLC7A11/SLC3A2  heterodimer)  that transports  
amino  acids  L-glutamate  and L-cystine  (Cys-S-S- Cys) into the cell. The release  of highly  abundant  
intracellular glutamate  is the driving  force  for efficient  uptake  of cystine  and 18F-FSPG.  Isotopic  
dilution  of 18F-FSPG  in a large  intracellular glutamate  pool  leads  to efficient  trappi[INVESTIGATOR_519306] , 
with  no further  metabolism  of the tracer  observed.  Intracellularly,  cystine  is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_519307]  (Cys-SH) and represents  the rate-limiting  precursor  for glutathione  (27) 
b
iosynthesis.  Redox  maintenance  and a constant  supply  of GSH are especially  important  in tumor  
cells  as protection  against  reactive  oxygen  species  (ROS) and for tumor  survival ( 28). As a result , 
many  tumor  cells  possess a survival  advant age over  normal cells  because  they  express  a higher  
expression  of the xC- transporter,  accumulate  higher  levels  of L-cysteine and L-glutamate,  and thus  
maintain  high  levels  of GSH to detoxify  ROS efficiently  (29). 
 
In contrast  to the modified  intermediary  metabolism  often  found  in tumors,  infection  and 
inflammation related  processes are primarily  dominated  by a high  rate of glycolysis  and/or  
glutaminolysis . Infiltrating  macrophages  and most  other  inflammatory  cells  do not proliferate  at 
the target  site,  and thus  depend  mainly  on glucose  or glutamine  to meet  their  bioenergetic  
requirements.  ROS and redox -balancing  processes  are also important  in these settings , wherein  
system x C- may  also play a role.  However,  the absence  of an intracellular glutamate  pool  should

Protocol  Date:  10/03/2019 7 not lead  to high  transporter  activity  and/or  tracer  retention  as observed  in tumor  cells . This need s 
to be investigated  in more  detail and will be also part of this study  to gain  further  insight  for future  
application s of 18F-FSPG  as a targeted  cancer -imaging  agent  in the clinic . 
 
Preclinical PET imaging  studies  with  18F-FSPG  indicate d superior  tumor  imaging  when  compared  
with  18F-FDG  with  rapid  clearance  from  the blood  and whole  body  leading  to a low background  
from  healthy  organs  and tissues. For example,  a high  uptake  and retention  of 18F-FSPG  in NCI-
H460 lung cancer  cells  was observed  in vitro  and in vivo. Other  lung tumor  cells  lines  (A549,  NCI-
H322,  NCI-292)  were  studied  with  similar  results  (26). 
 Furthermore,  
18F-FSPG  was tested  in several  inflammation model s. In a combined  
tumor/inflammation  model , where  inflammation  was induced by [CONTACT_519324], 18F-FSPG  showed  
superior  differentiation  of tumor  tissue  from  inflammatory  lesions  compared  to 18F-FDG  (26). 
Other  inflammation  models  were  studied  but the results  are not yet published  (personal  
communication  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_519308]).  This included also inflammation models  using Freund ’s 
complete  adjuvant,  a colitis  model , and a wound healing/scar tissue  model  that showed  similar  
results  to the turpentine  oil model  and were  all negative for 18F-FSPG  uptake.  Only  a rodent  model  
of lymphadenitis  and one mouse  with  incidental  histiocytosis  were  observed  to be positive  for 
FSPG . More  research  is needed  to understand  what  led to increased  18F-FSPG  uptake  and 
retention  in this situation , though  sarcoidosis  and active  tuberculosis  do demonstrate  strong  18F-
FSPG  uptake (30). 
 Toxicology  and safety  pharmacology  studies  with  the 
19F-labeled  drug substance  (“cold”  fraction  
of the active  compound)  and decayed  drug formulation  (containing by-products  and impurities)  
confirmed  that 18F-FSPG  can be used  in clinical trials. Furthermore,  the calculated  effective  
radiation  dose  (ED) dose  is within  acceptable  limits  for PET imaging  in humans  (see below ).  
 In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_519309]. (31) a high  tumor  detection  rate 
was observed  for NSCLC  but not for breast  cancer.  A positive  
18F-FDG -PET was used  as the 
inclusion  criteri on. All [ADDRESS_673616]

significant  correlation  between  18F-FSPG  uptake  and protein  expression  of both  the SLC7A1 [ADDRESS_673617]  tumor  samples  specifically,  IHC 
showed  that absence  of CD44  correlated  with  low signal from  18F-FSPG -PET, even  if the SLC7A11  
subunit  was present,  indicating possible  importance  of CD44  co-expression for system  xC- 
function.  The standardized  uptake  values  of 18F-FSPG  for non-small  cell lung  cancer  (NSCLC)  
averaged  7.6 (+/- 7.3),  versus  13.0 (+/- 6.7) for 18F-FDG.  While  the average  uptake  values  for 18F-
FSPG  were  lower  than  for 18F-FDG,  Baek,  et al, (31) demonstrated  that the background  signal was 
lower  for 18F-FSPG , leading  to comparable  tumor  to background  ratios  with  18F-FDG . 
 In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_519310]  
18F-FSPG  PET was investigated  in patients  with  inflammatory  lesions  and 
compared  with  18F-FDG.  The SUV max of all lesions  was significantly  lower  (~3.6  times)  for 18F-FSPG  
compared  to 18F-FDG  (SUV maxFSPG : 1.8 versus  SUV maxFDG : 6.5), with  the exception  of sarcoid  lesions ; 
rapid  washout  was also observed.  Such  incidence s in our target  population  is low and it is 
expected  that these are unlikely  confounders  on the differential diagnosis.

The SUVs  for 18F-FSPG  in NSCLC  were  higher  compared  with  other  radiopharmaceuticals in this 
setting:  18F-Fluorothymidine  (18F-FLT) showed  SUV values  of 3.54  (+/- 1.98)  (32). Hustinx  et al. (33) 
reported  on the use of another  amino  acid (2-18F-fluoro -L-tyrosine,  18F-TYR) for imaging  in cancer,  
including lung cancer,  but with  only  6 out of 11 lung cancer  patients  demonstrating  similar  staging  
compared  to 18F-FDG,  with  the 18F-TYR SUV value  for lung cancer  being approximately  2.0. Beer  
et al. (34) investigated  a PET imaging  probe  for angiogenesis,  18F-galacto -RGD, and compared  it to 
18F-FDG  in PET/CT  imaging  of [ADDRESS_673618]  proven  limited  usefulness  for PET 
imaging  of neoplasms  in the lung, prior  attempts  to use amino  acids  and other  PET imaging  agents  
beyond 18F-FDG  are, until  now,  of limited  clinical value. 
 In summary,  
18F-FSPG  is a novel  PET tracer to assess the activity  of system  xC- and has shown 
promise  as a cancer -imaging  probe  in a variety  of preclinical and clinical  settings. A favorable  
biodistribution  pattern  and a high  lesion  detection  rate previously  seen  in rodents  (26) was 
confirmed  in patients  with  different  tumor  types.  Phase  I clinical  trials  have  been  completed  
assessing the safety  and tolerability  as well as the tumor  targeting  potential and tumor  
accumulation  of 18F-FSPG  in healthy  volunteers  and patients  with  various  cancers.  To date,  18F-
FSPG  has been  evaluated  in patients  with  breast  and lung cancer,  where  the tracer  exhibited  a 
promising  detection  rate of tumors  with  xC- transporter  activity  (31). Ten of [ADDRESS_673619]  cancer  (31).  
 B
enefit  of this research  to patients  
 This research  may  impact  patient  care  in a number  of positive  ways.  Resu lts from  this study  have  
the potential  to establish  a new  role for non-invasive  molecular imaging  in distinguishing benign  
indeterminate  pulmonary  nodules  from  lung cancer . The benefits  potentially  include  reducing the 
need  for some  follow -up CTs, unnecessar y invasive  biopsies  with  atten dant  morbidity  and rare 
mortality,  reducing patient  anxiety,  and an overall decrease in wasted  healthcare  spending.  If 
18F-
FSPG  PET is shown to be more  specific  for lung canc er compared  to 18F-FDG  PET for diagnosis  of 
IPNs , 18F-FSPG  PET may  enable  improved  detection  of smaller  lesions  and improved  discrimination  
of benign  from  malignant  lesions  compared  to the current  standard  of care  assessment s. 
 
2. Objectives,  Rationale,  and Specific  Aims  
 This is a hypotheses -driven  prospective  clinical trial of an emerging , molecularly  targeted  PET 
reagent , 
18F-FSPG.  
 The objective  is to test the hypothesis  that  
18F-FSPG  PET/CT will provide  improved  accuracy  in 
diagnosis  of IPNs  compared to the current  PET/CT  imaging standard- of-care  with  18F-FDG.  
 Our rationale  is that 
18F-FSPG  PET/CT may  yield  improvements  in discrimination of tumor  from  
benign IPNs.  
THO 1524: [18F]FSPG PET Protocol  
  
 
 
   
Protocol  Date:  10/03/2019 9  
There are three Aims:  
 Specific  Aim 1: To compare the imaging characteristics  of 
18F-FSPG  PET/CT  with  standard-
of-care,  18F-FDG  PET/CT.   
 Hypotheses:  
18F-FSPG  will accumulate  in lung tumors  with  equal  or improved  sensitivity and 
increased specificity  over  SOC 18F-FDG  PET/CT .  
 Approach:  We will determine  and compare  the accuracy  in discrimination between  benign and 
malignant  lung nodules  detected  by [CONTACT_519325] 
18F imaging probes  for the 
diagnosis  of lung cancer  in a population whose  IPN’s  are 7-30 mm in maximum  diamete r, or 
in lung masses  not yet biopsied  that  are more  than 3 cm in diameter.   
 Specific  Aim 2: To compare the imaging  characteristics  of 
18F-FSPG  PET/CT  to standard- of-
care 18F-FDG  PET/CT in patients  with  newly  diagnosed lung  cancer . 
 Hypotheses:  
18F-FSPG  will provide  improved  baseline  diagnosis  and staging of lung cancer  
relative  to SOC PET/CT  using  18F-FDG .  
 Approach:  We will determine  whether  
18F-FSPG  PET/CT  is superior  to 18F-FDG  PET/CT  for 
baseline  diagnosis  and staging of lung cancer,  and whether  the biodistribution of 18F-FSPG  
varies  in various  histological  subtypes,  grades , and stages  of lung cancer.   
 Specific  Aim 3: To determine whether  
18F-FSPG  uptake in lung  cancer  can be predicted based  
on correlation with  CD44  and xC- expression in surgical  pathology  specimens . 
 Hypotheses:  
18F-FSPG  PET will correlate  with  xC- and CD44  immunoreactivity  in tumor  and non-
tumor  (IPN)  tissues.   
 Approach:  Core  or surgical  biopsies  and/or  autopsy  specimens  will be obtained from , following  
standard- of-care  for subjects , in Specific  Aims  1 or 2. This profiling  will allow  us to determine  
whether  FSPG  uptake  may  potentially  distinguish a subclass  of lung  cancers  with  different  
clinical  behavior,  e.g. possibly identifying  very  high  risk disease  even  in early  stage  lung cancer .  
 
3. Animal  Studies  and Previous  Human Experience  
 Published  reports  note  that 
18F-FSPG  has been  evaluated  previously  in rodents  and humans  (31, 
35
-37) . To date,  18F-FSPG  has been  evaluated  with  promising  results  in over  [ADDRESS_673620]  cancer  (31). In preclinical studies,  18F-FSPG  exhibited  greater  tumor  avidity  compared  to 
inflammation  in a combined  tumor -inflammation  model  in rats (26). In another  publication  from  
Korea,  18F-FSPG  was evaluated  to be useful  in patients  with  HCC who  exhibited  a range  of 18F-FDG  
THO 1524: [18F]FSPG PET Protocol  
  
 
 
   
Protocol  Date:  10/03/2019 10 PET results  (35). To date, in human  studies,  18F-FSPG  PET has been  well tolerated,  with  no reported  
safety  concerns  (35).  
 
4. Patient  Eligibility  & Inclusion  / Exclusion Criteria  
 
Particip ants  will be recruited  by [CONTACT_519326]  (TVHS)  study  team  members . Patient  history  will be reviewed  for 
inclusion/exclusion  criteria and informed  consent  obtained as described  below.  
 Enrollment  will be open  to all patients  of both  genders  with  the above  diagnoses  described  in the 
Specific  Aims,  with  the following  inclusion/exclusion  criteria.  
 A. Inclusion Criteria  
 1. Adult  patient  (age 40 - 80). 
2. An indeterminate  pulmonary  nodule  (IPN) (7– 30 mm diameter) on CT, or an indeterminate  
lung mass  (> 30 mm diameter) , without  prior  examinations  that establish  that the lesion  has 
been  stable  for two or more  years .  
3. Untreate d. 
 
OR 
4. An adult  patient  with a newly  diagnosed,  untreated  primary  lung cancer  diameter  [ADDRESS_673621]  provide  informed  written  consent,  which  will include  a layman’s  explanation  
of the estimated  amount  of additional  radiation  that the patient  will receive  from  the 
investigational PET/CT  scan  using 
18F-FSPG.  
 6. The patient  must  agree  at the time  of study  entry  to undergo  clinically  indicated  biopsy(ies)  or 
a 24-month  period  of follow -up, as needed,  to resolve  the etiology  of their  IPN(s)  or lung mass (es).  
  B. Exclusion Criteria  
 1. Pregnant  or lactating  patients  will be excluded,  as will females  of childbearing  potential  who  
refuse  to undergo  a serum  or urinary  beta -HCG  pregnancy  test the day of either  the

or the 18F-FDG  PET/CT  scans, in accordance  with  the standard  policy  of the Medical  Imaging  
Service  at our facility. Women  who  have  experienced  [ADDRESS_673622] and PET/CT .  If the standard -of-care  
18F-FDG/PET  was of diagnostic  quality  as 
determined  by [CONTACT_519327],  then  this will be presumptive  evidence  that 
THO 1524: [18F]FSPG PET Protocol  
  
 
 
   
Protocol  Date:  10/03/2019 11 the patient’s  body  habitus  and/or  disabilities  should not prevent  a diagnostic  quality  18F-FSPG  
PET/CT  scan,  either.  
 
3. A recognized  active  lung infection  (this  will confound  the standard -of-care  18F-FDG  PET/CT  
scan) . 
 4. Previous  systemic  or radiation  treatment  for cancer  of any type  within  [ADDRESS_673623]  a tissue diagnosis

A. Non -oncologic  severe  co-morbidities  suggesting a life span  of less than  two years  
if not treated , as determined  by [CONTACT_112988] ’s treating  physician .  
B. If severe co-morbidities  are present,  the treating  physician  should indicate  that a 
life span  of [ADDRESS_673624] follow -up to establish  a 
benign  diagnosis  for lesions  lacking  tissue diagnosis  if extremely  fragile  subjects  
are enrolled  and then experience an untimely , unrelated  death .  
 
5. Enrollment/Randomization  
 
We propose  a three  (3) year funded prospective  cohort  with  consecutive  subject  
enrollment  throughout  each  year.  We will enroll subjects referred  to the Oncology,  Thoracic  
Surgery  or Pulmonary  Medicine  Services  at Vanderbilt  University  Medical  Center  and Tennessee  
Valley  Healthcare  System  Nashville . We will allow  a 2- year follow -up of all subjects  to document  
stability  by [CONTACT_519328]  a tissue  diagnosis  (stability  on CT for two years  of an IPN 
or mass  is accepted  presumptive  evidence  of benignity).  Follow -up will be from  the day of the 
baseline  CT, and may  be extended  later if needed.  At VUMC,  we see about  [ADDRESS_673625]  described.   
 W e will perform  an analysis  to correlate  the 18F-FSPG  PET/CT  findings  with  18F-FDG  PET/CT  
and the surgical pathology  results  for the patients  who  have  tissue correlation.  Each  subject  will 
receive the “standard -of-care”  18F-FDG  PET/CT  as indicated  for patients  at high  risk for lung cancer  
who  have  an IPN or lung  mass  meeting  our size criteria,  and will also receive  the investigational  
18F-FSPG  PET/CT,  with  no intervening  treatment  of the target  lesion (s). After  enrolling  30 subjects,  
we will close  enrollment  but continue  the study  for data  collection  and analysis  until  the funding  
period  ends  and/or  sufficient  follow -up for diagnosis  (up to 2 years)  has occurred,  and report  our 
results  in the peer -reviewed  literature.  
 Should  we achieve  clear statistical superiority  of 18F-FSPG  PET/CT  over  18F-FDG  PET/CT  
before  that time,  we will pursue  a larger  trial to offer improved  benefit  of our patients  for the 
diagnosis  of IPNs  and/or  staging  of lung cancer  (see Go/No -Go criteria in Study  Design) . While  2 
years’  stability  in nodule  size is the “gold  standard”  for CT, well over  90%  of cancers  demonstrate  
growth  on CT within  one year.  We will also perform  the research  outlined  in Specific  Aim 3 on 
tissue specimens  obtained  from  our subjects  in Specific  Aims  1 and 2. If we find significant  added  
value  from  the use of 18F-FSPG  in either  IPNs  or lung cancer,  we will propose  further  investigations.  
Final diagnosis  will be based  on tissue biopsy  (surgical  or via a high -quality core  biopsy)  
or negative  (no growth)  two-year follow -up with  CT. We will assign  patients  with  IPNs  into the 
THO 1524: [18F]FSPG PET Protocol  
  
 
 
   
Protocol  Date:  10/03/2019 12 “benign”  category  if their  IPNs  remain  stable  for two or more  years,  decrease  in size,  or resolve  
during CT follow -up, performed  in accordance  with  Fleischner  Society  guidelines.   
 
Patient  Registration  
 
All patients  MUST  be registered  with  the Vanderbilt -Ingram  Cancer Center  (VICC)  prior to the start  
of research  procedures  for all sites .   
 Patients  will be centrally  registered  with  the Vanderbilt -Ingram  Cancer Center  (VICC)  at study  
entry  by [CONTACT_519329] -Institutional  Team  at coordinating.center@ vumc.org . At the time  of 
registration,  the following  documents  must  be submitted :  
 
• Copy  of the patient’s  signed  and dated  Informed  Consent  
• Patient  Enrollment  From   
• Eligibility  Checklist  including source  documents  to verify  eligibility  
 The VICC  Coordinating  Center  will assign sequence  numbers  to all patients  in screening.  Sequence  
numbers  will not be re-used  if a patient  screen  fails.  
 
6. Data Management  and Monitoring  
  
Participating  i
 nstitutions  will be collaborating  with  Vanderbilt  in patient  accrual. Data  will be 
collected  using a centralized  electronic  case  report  form  called  ON-line Clinical  Oncology  
Research  Environment  = Oncore  (http://www.vicc.org/ct/research/onco re.php).  Oncore  is a 
highly  secure,  web  based,  cancer  specific,  and customizable  system that provides  fully  
integrative  clinical data  management  and study  administration  capabilities  developed  in an 
ongoing collaborative  effort  with  NCI designated  Comprehensive  Cancer  Centers.   It fully  
integrates  study  administration  functionality  including protocol  tracking,  patient  registration,  
NCI reporting,  review  committee tracking,  and SAE tracking,  with  clinical data  management  
functionality  including electronic  case report  forms  (eCRF) design,  clinical  data  capture,  protocol  
and regulatory  compliance  monitoring.   Also  the system  is capable  in storing  basic  protocol  
information  (e.g.,  IRB approval  dates,  dates  for annual  renewals,)  and clinical  trials  research  
data.   Oncore  allows  the investigator  to define  specific  protocol  requirements  and generate  data  
collection  forms.   Creation  of the data  collection  form  is done  with  a single  button  click  after  the 
parameters  of an individual  protocol  have  been  specified.  Oncor e permits  specification  of study  
protocols,  management  of patient  enrollment,  clinical data  entry  and viewing,  and the 
generation  of patient  or study -specific  reports  based  on time  stampi[INVESTIGATOR_007].   OnCore  is embedded 
with  a comprehensive  d omain  repository  of standard reference codes  and forms  to promote  
standardization. The sources  for the repository  include  CDUS,  CTC,  CDEs  from  NCI, ICD, MedDRA  
and various  best  practices  from  contributing NCI-designated  Comprehensive  Cancer Centers.  
OnCore  provides  several repor ting features  specifically  addressing NCI Summary  3 and Summary  
4 and other  reporting  requirements.  Data may  also be exported  in a format  suitable  for import  
into other  database,  spreadsheets  or analysis  systems (such  as SPSS).  This system  will be used  to 
manage  all VICCC  clinical  trials  data.  OnCore  is maintained  and supported  in the VICC  Clinical 
and Research  Informatics  Resource.

 During the course  of the study,  the Coordinating  Center  will routinely  monitor  sites  for protocol  
compliance,  compare  CRFs  with  individual  subjects’ original source  documents,  assess drug 
accountability,  and ensure  that the study  is being conducted  according  to the pertinent  
regulatory  requirements.  The review  of subjects’ medical  records will be performed  in a manner  
to ensure  that subjects’ confidentiality  is maintained. Monitoring  visits  will primarily  be 
conducted remotely,  and sites  are required  to provide  the appropriate  source  documentation  in 
order  to allow  for proper  oversight  per GCP.  Investigators  must  agree  to cooperate with  the 
Coordinating  Center  to ensure  that any problems  detected  are resolved.  
 T
he VICC  DSMC  meets  on a quarterly  basis  and ad hoc to discuss  data  and safety  monitoring of 
clinical trials  and to oversee  the VICC  DSMP.  Internal  audits  for compliance  with  adverse  event  
reporting,  regulatory  and study  requirements,  and data  accuracy  and completion  are conducted 
according  to the VICC  DSMP  according  to study  phase  and risk. The committee reviews  all 
serious  adverse  events  (SAE) on Vanderbilt  sponsored investigator -initiated  studies  on a 
quarterly  basis  and provides  DSMC  SAE review  reports  to the Vanderbilt  IRB. 
 7. Study  Procedures  & Data  Collection  
 
Baseline Imaging: CT 
 
 Each  patient  will have  a diagn ostic  CT within  180 days  prior to enrollment  (as part of the 
standard  of care)  to define  the pathologic  conditions  necessary to be enrolled,  and be untreated  
for the IPN or lung cancer  for which  the patient  is being evaluated. These prior  scans  must  be 
immediately  available  to the investigators  for review.  Outside  CT scans  found to be of good  quality  
will be acceptable  if they  are available  in native  (uncompressed)  DICOM  format.   
 Imaging  Protocol : 
18F-FSPG  (Figure  1) 
 
 Each  patient  will undergo  an SOC whole -body  (vertex to mid thighs)  18F-FDG  PET/CT  scan  
within  60 working  days  of an 18F-FSPG  PET/CT  scan  for these  first 60 enrollees,  with  no intervening  
cancer  treatment  of the target lesion  (limited  biopsies  or resections  are allowed) . A minimum  of 
[ADDRESS_673627]  lapse  between  SOC (18F-FDG)  and 18F-FSPG  PET/CT  scans. Standard  of care  
procedures  performed  prior  to consent  but within  the protocol  defined  windows  for each  
THO 1524: [18F]FSPG PET Protocol  
  
 
 
   
Protocol  Date:  10/03/[ADDRESS_673628]  be performed  after  
the consent  date.  
 Eight  (8) subjects  with  either  indeterminate  nodule (s) or thought  or known to have  newly  
diagnosed  lung cancer,  will receive  an 18F-FSPG  PET scan  (emission only) , acquired  dynamically  
after injection  over  the nodule/mass  of interest  for [ADDRESS_673629]  a short  break  (bathroom,  stand  up) 
and then  receive  a PET/CT  scan  from  the vertex to the mid-thighs .  This  final body  PET/CT  covers 
the same  anatomic  range  as the SOC 18F-FDG  PET/CT , and will be compared  closely  to the 18F-FDG  
PET/CT  to determine  if there  is added value  of the 18F-FSPG  PET/CT.   Once the dynamic  PET/CT  
scans  with  18F-FSPG  in the initial [ADDRESS_673630]  of care 18F-FDG  PET/CT.  
 The third  year  will be used,  if needed,  to obtain  at least  two years  of CT follow -up for 
patients  with  IPNs  who  chose  serial  follow -up CT scans  over  a tissue diagnosis  (two  years  is 
required  by [CONTACT_519331]/benignity  for solid  nodules),  though 
over  90%  of malignant  IPNs  will demonstrate  growth  within  one year  by [CONTACT_4654].

THO 1524: [18F]FSPG PET Protocol  
  
 
 
   
Protocol  Date:  10/03/2019 16 relevant  information  available  in the patients’  medical  records . The final PET/CT  interpretations  
(18F-FSPG ; 18F-FDG  PET/CT,  clinical  CTs and other  relevant  clinical imaging  available  for 
comparison ) will then  be compared  to determine  the impact  of 18F-FSPG  PET/CT  on the final 
diagnosis,  and specifically  to determine  if the 18F-FSPG  PET/CT would  have  changed  the diagnos is 
and/or  stage  of disease  compared  to the clinical  SOC CT and/or  18F-FDG  PET/CT .  These results  will 
be reported  to the biostatistician  who  will com pi[INVESTIGATOR_519311]  (see 
Statistical Consideration  Section) .   
 
At this time,  the investigational data  will not be used  to direct  care  (e.g.  influence  treatment  
decisions)  until  we have  sufficient  knowledge  of the usefulness  of the data  in this regard  
compared  to standard  of care  procedures.  
 Rationale  for Size Criteria  
  The rationale  of a minimum  diameter  of 7 mm for IPNs  and lung cancer  for our 
investigation  is based  on the usual  lower  limit  of detectability  on PET imaging.  While  this is usually  
reported  as 8-10 mm in the literature,  much  of this is based  on older  technology  PET scanners.  
The size of 7 mm is also the minimum  size in which  evaluation  of an IPN becomes  technically  
feasible  (11, 38) in ter
 ms of: 
 1) Number  of patients  to manage  
2) Limited  clinical means  by [CONTACT_519332]  a small IPN 
3) Risks/benefits  of definitive  evaluation  of a nodule  this small  
 
While  overall very  safe,  definitive  evaluation  of such  small IPNs  often  require s a core  biopsy  via 
a transthoracic  or transbronchoscopic  biopsy,  VATS  wedge  resection  or even  an open  
thoracotomy  since  fine-needle  biopsies  are often  non- definitive. Given  the co-morbidities  
frequently  present  in patients  at high  risk for lung cancer,  the perioperative  mortality  is likely  to 
be 1.0%.  Since  the majority  of IPNs,  even  in high -risk patients,  are benign,  we must  choose  a 
minimum  size threshold  at which  the potential benefits  for the patient  justify  the pain , cost and 
risk of a definitive  answer.   
 Henschke  et al. (39) recently  addressed  this in a retrospective review  of 21,[ADDRESS_673632] lung cancer  screening program  performed  between  2006 –2010,  in which  
malignancy  rates of various  size ranges  of IPNs  were  evaluated. With  a cut-off of 7 mm in 
diameter for IPNs,  instead  of 5 mm,  was used,  the percentage of patients  with  a “positive”  
screening CT at baseline  for an IPN decreased  from  16%  (5 mm threshold)  to 7.1%  (7 mm 
threshold).  When  these patients  were  then  evaluated  for subsequent  diagnosis,  a delay  in 
diagnosis  of lung cancer  by 9 months  occurred  in about  5% of patients  using the threshold of 7 
mm diameter as the minimum  size for close  interval  follow -up, while  the percent  of “positive”  
screening exams  decreased  by [CONTACT_519333] ( Table  1). Accordingly,  though  still debated,  the 
definition  of a “positive”  CT screening examination  for lung cancer  will likely  need  to address  
practical,  realistic  management  issues that will include  the size of the IPNs  to be definitively  
evaluated  versu s followe d, particularly  given  the low but real morbidity/mortality  associated  
with  invasive  procedures  when  the vast majority  of even  high -risk patients  will have  a benign

Protocol  Date:  10/03/[ADDRESS_673634]  (40). In addition  to the intensity  and estimate  
of percent  positive  tumor  cells,  the cellular localization  of staining  is documented  (nuclear,  
cytoplasmic,  or membrane).   
 
8. Risks  
 
Radiopharmaceutical  
 T he radiopharmaceutical (18F-FSPG)  used  in this study  for PET scanning has been  
evaluated  in humans  previously  (31, 35). No adverse  side effects  such  as anaphylactic  reactions,  
allergic  reactions , or mortality  or morbidity  have  been  reported  to the best  of our knowledge.  For 
a complete  safety  listing  of 18F-FSPG,  please  refer  to the Investigational Brochure  (IB) of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_519312]-
held  IND 121728.  The total  mass  of radiopharmaceuticals  administered  in this study  is in the sub-
pharmacological amount  (<100  micrograms) , and thus  is expected  to have  no physiologic  effect  
on the patient  or tumor.  18F-FSPG  is produced by [CONTACT_519334] -held  IND 124202 (Henry  Charles  Manning,  PhD,  PI) and 
meet s all USP <823>  requirements  for a sterile,  injectable  PET radiopharmaceutical.  
Injection  
 R
isks and side effects  related  to the IV catheter  may  include  discomforting  pain  at the site 
of injection,  bleeding,  and bruising.   
Reproductive  Risk 
 Patients  should not be pregnant  while  on this study  because  the imaging  agent  being  
tested  contains  a small amount  of radioactivity. This could  affect  an unborn baby.  Female  subjects  
of childbearing  potential  must  have  a negative  serum  or urinary  pregnancy  test within  24 hours  
of the proposed  investigational PET/CT  scan  prior  to injection  of the investigational  
radiopharmaceutical  in accordance  with  the policies  of the Vanderbilt  University  Medical Center  
IRB and Department  of Radiology.  
Dose  Rationale  
 A dose  of 300 MBq  (8.1 mCi)  for 18F-FSPG  studies  was chosen  in accordance  with  a typi[INVESTIGATOR_519313] 18F-FDG  used  for oncological  diagnostics  (350  MBq for an adult).  This dose  is 
expected  to provide  suitable  imag ing contrast  of the target  structures . 
 Radiation S afety   
 Effective  radiation  doses  for 
18F-FSPG  were  calculated  from  biodistribution  studies  in mice  
and were  determined  in five healthy  volunteers.  Extrapolated  effective  doses  from  mice  are 5.[ADDRESS_673635],  assuming a patient  dose  of 300 MBq  and a 
bladder -voiding interval of 45 min.  In humans,  an effective  dose  of 4.5 mSv  was determined  in 
healthy  volunteers  from  an injection  of 300 MBq /8.1 mCi of 18F-FSPG .

Protocol  Date:  10/03/2019 19 Toxicity  Studies  
 The tracer (18F-FSPG ) used  in the study  has been  evaluated  in humans  previously  without  
incident  (31, 35). The evaluation  of the toxicity  of FSPG  included an extended  single -dose toxicity  
study  in rats and in dogs  and the evaluation  of the genotoxic  potential in a gene  mutation  assay 
(Ames  test) and an assay on clastogenic  effects  (micronucleus  assay in vitro ). For a complete  
description  of 18F-FSPG  toxicity,  please  refer  to the Investigational Brochure  (IB) of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_519312]- held  
IND 121728.  Additionally,  the effects  of the impurities  of the anticipated  clinical  kit formulation  
were  evaluated  in an extended  single  dose  toxicity  study  over  three  days in rats with  a decayed  
kit-formulation. All toxicological studies  were  performed  according  to GLP principles.  Since  these  
studies  were  intended  to evaluate  the chemical toxicity  of FSPG  and not the potential effects  of 
the radiation,  the non-radioactive  19F-labeled  analogue  was used  for toxicological  testing.  
9. Reporting  of Adverse  Events  or Unanticipated Risks  to Participants  or Others 
 
 Dr(s).,  Shah, Manning, and attending nuclear  medicine  physician(s)  will monitor  the study  
progress  and safety  of the participating  patients  and will monitor  for serious  symptoms  or 
toxicities  on an ongoing basis. Vanderbilt’s  Clinical  Trials  Shared  Resources  department  will 
undertake  reporting  any significant  adverse  events  to the IRB as required , to Pi[INVESTIGATOR_519312] (until  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_519314]), and to the IND holder,  [CONTACT_519340]. [CONTACT_519340] and the study  team  will meet  
regularly,  based  on enrollment,  to review  and discuss  any adverse  events  related  to this study  and 
report  these  to the FDA as required . Patients  will be asked  to report  to the nurse  any adverse  
symptoms  that occur  within  30 days  of the research  PET studies.  Serious  adverse  events  related  
to the study  drug (18F-FSPG)  or the performance  of the PET/CT  scan  will be reported  within  three  
working  days  to the IRB and FDA as required, and non-serious  adverse  events  at the time  of 
continuing review . These adverse  events  will be recorded  in the database  maintained  by [CONTACT_519335].   
  Adverse  events  for the purposes  of this imaging  trial are defined  as any unexpected  
medical occurrence  in a subject who  receives  
18F-FSPG.  The event  does  not necessarily  have  to be 
causally  related  to the PET radiopharmaceutical to qualify  as an adverse  event.  An adverse  event  
can be any unfavorable  or unintended  signs, symptom  or disease  temporally  associated  with  the 
injection  of one of the radiopharmaceuticals,  whether  or not it is considered related  to 18F-FSPG  
PET.  Subjects  will be monitored  for advers e events  during the actual  imaging  period  and for up six 
half- lives  following  the research  PET study.   Since  the investigational drug,  18F-FSPG,  decays  to 
background  in 6 half- lives,  these  adverse  events  should  occur  within  660 minutes  (11 hours)  of 
admini stration  to be investigationally  related  to the drug.   Other  adverse  events  could  last longer,  
such  as bruising,  pain,  bleeding or infection  at the IV injection  site.   We  will attempt  to contact  
[CONTACT_519336] 18F-FSPG  PET/C T scan,  at least  [ADDRESS_673636]  created  a reporting  form  for tracking  AEs related  to radiopharmaceuticals  given  in 
“microdose”  (sub -physiologic)  quantity.   This  form  will facilitate  and better reflect  reporting  AEs 
related  to diagnosis -only  investigations  of sub-physiological  mass  quantity  radiopharmaceuticals.   
This AE tracking  form  will be submitted as a separate  document  to the IRB. 
THO 1524: [18F]FSPG PET Protocol  
  
 
 
   
Protocol  Date:  10/03/2019 20 Serious  Adverse  Events  (SAE)  are defined in accordance  with  the NCI’s  CTCAE  Ver. 4.0.  
 
A serious  adverse  events is defined  as, but not limited  to, events  that:  
• result  in death   
• are life-threatening  (The  patient  was at risk of death  at the time  of the event.  It does  
not refer to an event  which  hypothetically  might  have  caused  death  if it were  more  
severe)   
• requires  inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_40088]   
• results  in persistent or significant  disability/incapacity,  or in a congenital  
anomaly/birth  defect   
 All serious  adverse  events,  regardless  of causality  to protocol -indicated  treatment,  will be 
reported  to the Principal  Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or  the Study  Coordinator at each  institution,  and also 
to the Coordinating  Center.  
 
All serious  adverse  events  must  be reported  to the Coordinating  Center  within  24 hours  of the 
investigator becoming  aware  of the event.  Events  should  be reported  using the Vanderbilt  
Coordinating  Center  SAE Form   
as well as Form  FDA 3500A  (Mandatory  Reporting  Form  for investi gational agents).  The FDA 
form  can be found  online  at https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/medwatch/
.  
 
Both forms  must  be fully  completed  and emailed  (preferred) , faxed,  or scanned  to: 
 
ATTN:  VICC  CTSR  Personnel  
EMAIL:  Coordinating.Center@ vumc.org  
FAX:  (615)  875-[ADDRESS_673637]  also be reported  within  24 hours  of receipt  of the informa tion by [CONTACT_1275].  
 
The Coordinating  Center  will disseminate  information  regarding  serious  adverse  events  to the 
participating  sites  as described  in FDA guidance  only  in the case  that the event(s)  is/are  
unexpected,  and is/are  believed  to be related  (i.e. possibly,  probably,  or definitely)  to the study  
medication.  The Coordinating Center  will be responsible  for reporting  of events  to the FDA and 
supporters,  as appropriate.  
 
Institutional  Review  Board  
 All adverse  events  and serious  adverse  events will be reported  to the IRB per current  institutional  
standards.  If an adverse  event requires  modification  of the informed  consent,  these  modifications  
will be provided  to the IRB with  the report  of the adverse  event.  If an adverse  event requires  
modif ication  to the study  protocol,  these modifications  will be provided  to the IRB as soon  as 
possible.

Protocol  Date:  10/03/2019 21 10. Study  Withdrawal  / Discontinuation 
 
 Patients  will be withdrawn from  the study  for the following  reasons:  withdrawal  of patient  
consent,  failure  to adhere  to physician  instructions  and protocol,  and if the patient’s  physician  
considers  withdrawal to be in a given  patient’s  best  interest.  
 
11. Statistical  Considerations  
 
Study  Design  
 As we have  shown  from  a large  review  of patients  referred  to us for IPNs  and lung masses, 
18F-FDG  PET/CT  has 92%  sensitivity  but 40%  specificity  for diagnosis  of cancer,  primarily  due to 
inflammatory  (especially  granulomatous)  lung nodules  in our population.  For 18F-FSPG  to have  a 
significant  impact,  we assume that the sensitivity  of 18F-FSPG  will be equal  to 18F-FDG,  but that 
the specificity  of 18F-FSPG  for the diagnosis  of lung cancer  will be 80%.  Given  the preliminary  data  
we have  shown  with  virtually  no 18F-FSPG  uptake in an active  granulomatous  abscess, we are very  
optimistic  that our approach  could succeed.  
  Our preliminary  proposed  invest igation  will include  [ADDRESS_673638]  that we will need  to extend  the study  to a 
total  of 70 subjects completing a study  to achieve  significance.   Our  plans  for the additional  
funding will be to approach  the current  IP holder  (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_519315])  as well as to apply  for

o/No -Go criteria : To verify  that data  collected  in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_519316] y support s 
procee ding to a larger  efficacy  trial,  clear  Go/No -Go criteria, which  will be assessed  at the end of 
enrollment  and data  analysis,  have  been  established  for each  aim,  and include:  
A. Aim 1 – 18F-FSPG  PET/CT  has equal  sensitivity  to 18-FDG  PET/CT,  with  ≥50%  specificity , 
compared  to the proven  40%  specificity  of 18F-FDG  PET/CT,  for the diagnosis  of 
indeterminate lung nodules,  in our area with  high  endemic  rates  of fungal  nodules.  
B. Aim 2 – 18F-FSPG  PET/CT  is at least  equivalent  in overall accuracy  to 18F-FDG  PET/CT  for 
staging  of lung cancer.  
C. Aim 3 –18F-FSPG  uptake  on PET/CT  imaging  correlates  significantly  with  co-expressed 
(presumed  heterodimer)  CD44  and Xc- expression  levels  in surgical pathologic  specimens; 
if not, pursue  other  explanations  for 18F-FSPG  uptake.  
 A positive  result  in Aim 1 would  support  additional clinical trials  (Go), but failure  to achieve  either  
sufficient  sensitivity  or selectivity  for lung cancer  would  contraindicate  further  study  (No-Go) at 
the present  time.  
    
THO 1524: [18F]FSPG PET Protocol  
  
 
 
   
Protocol  Date:  10/03/2019 22 Primary  Endpoint s:  Results  from  18F-FSPG  PET/CT:  
1. Demonstrate  significance  accuracy  in discrimination  of benign  from  malignant  
nodules/masses  equal  to or greater  than  18F-FDG  PET/CT,  especially  for 
inflammatory/infectious  lung  nodules,  or trend  toward  significance  should additional 
subjects  be enrolled.  
2. Demonstrate  equivalent  or superior  accuracy  for staging  of lung cancer  compared  to 18F-
FDG  PET/CT,  or trend  towards  significance  should  additional subjects  be enrolled.  
Sample  Size and Study  Power  
 Because our study  population  will not originate  solely  from  a lung cancer  screening trial,  
it will be “enriched”  for high  risk of malignancy .  Thus,  the sample  size calculation  primarily  focuses  
on the power  to detect the minimum  clinically  important  difference  in the specificity  of 18F-FDG  
and 18F-FSPG  tests  (19). Accordingly,  comparing  to 18F-FDG  PET/CT  scans, we hypothesize  that use 
of the 18F-FSPG  PET/CT  will improve  specificity  for lung  cancer  diagnosis  in our study  population  
from  40%  (18F-FDG)  to 80%  (18F-FSPG).  We use McNemar’s  test for paired  data to evaluate  the 
specificity  for these two methods.  We assume the proportion  of the discordant  pairs  is 0.2 and 
0.6. A sample  size of 37 benign  subjects  provides  80%  power  to detect a 40%  increase  in specificity  
with  a two-sided  type  1 error  = 5%. Sixty -two subjects  will be recruited  to take the historic  lung  
cancer  prevalence  of 0.4 (19) fo r  the referral population  to the pulmonary  medicine  or thoracic  
surgery  services  at VUMC for an IPN or lung mass. We will also apply  a non-inferiority  test to show  
that the sensitivity  of 18F-FSPG  is not worse  than  the 18F-FDG.  A sample  size of 25 cancer  patients  
achieves  82%  power  at a 5% type  [ADDRESS_673639] when  the sensitivity  of 
18F-FDG  is 0.9 (42) and the maximum  allowable  difference  between  18F-FDG  and 18F-FSPG  is 0.2. 
Thus,  we propose  to enroll  up to [ADDRESS_673640] to 
follow -up or choosing to withdraw  from  the study  before  protocol  completion . 
Data Analysis  
As part of our “go/no  go” analysis  as initial proof  of principle,  we plan  to enroll  [ADDRESS_673641]  significance  in accuracy  for diagnosis  of IPNs  or lung masses.   This will be an initial,  
“proof  of principle”  investigation.  If not, we will consider  other  imaging  probes.   However,  if we 
do see a trend  of significance,  we plan  on  [ADDRESS_673642]  a 40%  prevalence  of cancer  in our referral base,  which,  heretofore,  is not a 
“screened”  population.  Thus,  with  [ADDRESS_673643]  about  42 
subjects  with  benign  nodules  and 28 with  cancer.  The analysis  of Specific  Aim 1 will focus  on the 
18F-FSPG  PET/CT’s  ability  to discriminate  up-front  benign  from  malignant  lung nodules/masses in 
all subjects. Analysis  of Specific  Aim 2 will then  focus  on analysis  of known/confirmed  lung 
cancers.  Specific  Aim [ADDRESS_673644]  Narrative  with  the findings  of Specific  Aims  1 and 2. 
THO 1524: [18F]FSPG PET Protocol  
  
 
 
   
Protocol  Date:  10/03/2019 23 Sensitivity,  specificity,  overall accuracy  and ROC  curves  will be generated  and compared  for both  
18F-FDG  and 18F-FSPG  tests.  Wilcoxon  rank -sum  or Kruskal- Wallis  tests  will be applied  for the group  
comparisons  of immunohistochemical  staining  (CD44  and xC- expression  levels,  Specific  Aim 3) 
and the biodistribution  characteristics  of 18F-FDG  and 18F-FSPG  tests  (Specific  Aims  1 & 2 ). The 
demographic  information  such  as age,  smoking  status/pack -year history  will be tabulated.  
Descriptive  statistics,  including means,  standard  deviations,  and ranges  for continuous  
parameters  (uptake  expressed  in SUV max, SUV mean, SUV peak) normalized  to lean  body  mass  and 
body  weight , and ratios  of these  uptake  values  to cardiac  blood  pool  and normal  lung. as well as 
percentages  and frequencies  for categorical parameters,  will be presented.

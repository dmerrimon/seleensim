1-1 CHAPTER 1  
 
 
1. BACKGROUND  
 
While hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) offers the only cure for many patients with 
malignant and non -malignant hematologic diseases, this treatment is associated with significant 
risks, leading to high rates of morbidity and mortality.  There is a critical need for more effective 
prevention and treatment strategies for HCT -associated complications.  The most serious of the 
latter include graft -versus -host disease (GVHD), cancer recurrence, organ toxicity and 
opportunistic infection.  Although s ome clinical variables (e.g., recipi[INVESTIGATOR_29039], donor -recipi[INVESTIGATOR_29040] [HLA] mismatch) predict higher risk of some events (e.g., GVHD, 
infection), no diagnostic tests exist that reliably predict occurrence, severity or response to 
therapy of any of these complications.  Recent compelling results from single center studies 
suggest that biomarkers can be identified that stratify patients into discrete risk groups for some 
outcomes and for overall mortality.  However, these relatively small studi es generally lack the 
statistical power or validation necessary to allow their results to be incorporated into practice.  
One key factor in the success of biomarker studies is the quality of clinical outcomes data that is 
linked to the specimens being anal yzed.  An adequate resource for these studies requires 
longitudinal sample collection integrated with longitudinal collection of comprehensive, 
standardized, high quality clinical data regarding complications, from onset to resolution, and 
regarding other clinical variables affecting risk of post -HCT outcomes.  
 
The Resource proposed in this application will address the important problem that no multicenter 
biospecimen collections exist that contain appropriate types and/or numbers of specimens, 
together wi th detailed, rigorously reviewed clinical data collected from adequate numbers of 
patients, for biomarker studies.  We propose to address this clear unmet need through a multi -
center initiative to uniformly collect and store high quality biological specime ns and high quality 
clinical data from a large, prospective cohort of patients and their donors.  This Resource will be 
made available to the biomedical community and is expected to facilitate studies that will 
establish the utility of specific biomarkers for risk assessment, diagnosis and monitoring to allow 
more rational treatment strategies.  These studies are also likely to provide mechanistic insights 
and to identify new therapeutic targets leading to development of more targeted and effective 
therapie s. 
 
The goal of this protocol is to establish a cohort of biologic samples collected prospectively from 
patients treated in BMT CTN centers that will be a shared biospecimen resource for conducting 
future allogeneic HCT correlative studies.  This resource is designed to allow genomic, 
proteomic and transcriptional data to be integrated with  high quality clinical  phenotype and 
outcomes  data to identify risk factors for development and severity of acute GVHD, chronic 
GVHD, organ toxicity, relapse, mortality, infection and other clinically significant complications 
occurring after allogeneic HCT.  
 
To achieve this goal, p atients and donor s will be recruited and consent obtained at the time that 
they enroll on BMT CTN protocols where enrollment occurs at or before transplantation or prior 
to start of conditioning for patients enrolled on non -BMT CTN studies or treated as standard of

1-2 care.  Samples will be collected : (1) from patients and donors pre -transplant; and, (2) from 
patients post -transplant on a calendar schedule through the first [ADDRESS_28414] -transplant events will be collected using the same data collection forms and systems 
that are used on BMT CTN trials.  Additional clin ical data for both BMT CTN and non -BMT 
CTN  patients will be available from data submitted to the Center for International Blood and 
Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR)  using the CIBMTR Comprehensive Report Forms .  
This protocol also leverages ongoing pre -transplant donor -recipi[INVESTIGATOR_29041]  (NMDP) .  Success in establishing this 
shared resource will inspi[INVESTIGATOR_29042] a dvantage of National Institutes of H ealth (NIH) funding initiatives.  
 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Biomarkers – Protocol #[ADDRESS_28415] allogeneic hematopoietic cell transp lants that are  transplanted in U.S. 
centers that participate in the NMDP/CIBMTR’s “Protocol for a Research Sample 
Repository for Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and Marrow Toxic 
Injuries”  and r eceive a cord blood graft or receive a bone marrow or peripheral blood 
graft from a related donor or from an unrelated donor in an NMDP -affiliated Donor 
Center or Registry participating in that same protocol.   
 
This transplant and donor center restriction is to allow linkage with pretransplant donor  
specimens collected under the NMDP/CIBMTR protocol.  Current data indicate that 
>90% of donors approached under this protocol agree to provide samples . 
 
2. Patients with any malignant or non -malignant hematologic disorder will be eligible for 
enrollment on this protocol. Upon reaching accrual of [ADDRESS_28416] 10 kilograms given the 
volume  (100 mL) and number of blood draws during this study  (see Section 4.3.3 for 
blood volume adjustments for patients weighing between 10 and 20 kg) .  Subjects must 
weigh at least 30 kg to provide research samples for gene expression studies (additional 
40 mL). A minimum of 200 pediatric participants , defined as <18.0 years at the time of 
enrollment, will be enrolled on this protocol.  
 
4. All participants or parent/legal guardia n mu st sign an informed consent for this study.  
Because studies using this resource will require linking with clinical data collected by 
[CONTACT_29063], all participants or parent/legal guardian must also consent to participate in 
“Protocol for a Research Database for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation and Marrow 
Toxic Injuries ”.

2-2 2.2.Inclusion Criteria Hematopoietic Cell Donors  
 
The data and samples obtained from patients on this protocol are linked to donor data and 
samples obtained from a separate NMDP/CIBMTR protocol, “Protocol for a  Research Sample 
Repository for Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and Marrow Toxic 
Injuries .”  No donor specimens  will be collected under this protocol.  Samples from donors will 
be obtained under the protocol specified above using the sta ndard NMDP mechanism for the 
collection of donor samples.  
 
2.3.Conditioning Regimens  
 
This protocol allows institutional choice in conditioning regimen.  
 
2.4.GVHD Prophylaxis  
 
This protocol allow s institutional choice in GVHD prophylaxis . 
 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Biomarkers – Protocol #[ADDRESS_28417] for future testing 
of the collected samples.  
 
For each assessment period all medications given for GVHD prevention and/or treatment are 
collected.  
 
Through Day 100 when the diagnosis of GVHD is uncertain, or when GVHD is present, but 
there is more than one simultaneous possible cause of GVHD symptoms (e .g. C. difficile 
infection in the setting of proven GI GVHD), all etiologies, proven and possible, a s part of 
recording diagnostic certainty in the database (definite, probable, uncertain) for future analyses 
will be collected . 
 
Weekly GVHD staging and treatment will be collected from Day [ADDRESS_28418] Chronic GVHD assessments at Day 100, 180, 1 year and 2 years are 
submitted using both AdvantageEDC and FormsNet.   The BMT CTN Chronic GVHD Provider 
Survey (see BMT C TN 1202 Biomarker Data Management Handbook) is submitted via 
AdvantageEDC .  Additional information regarding chronic GVHD will be collected on the 
CIBMTR forms 2100 and 2200 a nd submitted using FormsNet .

  Version 3.0 dated March 17, 2015  
 
 
3-3 3.5.Acute Liver Injury/SOS/Kidney Injury  
 
The diagnosis of veno -occlusive disease/sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (VOD/SOS) is defined 
using the Baltimore criteria :1 
 
Total bilirubin ≥ 2 mg/dL and either a liver biopsy showing VOD or SOS OR at least 2 of the 
following  3: 
• Ascites  
• Weight gain ≥5% above baseline weight  
• Hepatomegaly, or presence of a liver biopsy showing VOD or SOS  
 
The diagnosis of  thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is defined using BMT CTN consensus 
criteria2 which requires the presence of:  
• RBC fragmentation and ≥2 schistocytes per high -power field on peripheral smear  
• Concurrent increased serum LDH above institutional baseline  
• Concurrent renal and/or neurologic dysfunction without other explanations  
• Negative direct and indirect Coombs test results  
 
Renal dysfunction is considered as either a d oubling of serum creatinine from baseline ( where 
baseline is the serum  creatinine before  hydration and conditioning) or 50% decrease in creatinine 
clearance from baseline.  
 
VOD/SOS and TMA will be collected on CIBMTR Form [ADDRESS_28421] -transplant.  
 
The diagnosis of Idiopathic Pneumonia Syndrome  (IPS) is d efined by [CONTACT_29064]3 
and requires all three of the following criteria :  
• Multilobar  infiltrates on chest radiograph (CXR) or computed tomography (CT) that are 
not due to fluid overload.  
• Presence of clinical symptoms (hypoxia , requirement for supplemental oxygen , dyspnea, 
cough, or rales ). 
• Absence of lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (by [CONTACT_29065] -alveolar lavage [BAL] or 
surgical lung biopsy).  
 
Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome (BOS) is defined using NIH Consensus Criteria4 and requires 
all the following criteria to be met :  
• Forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_3741] 1 second/forced vital capacity (FEV1 /FVC) ratio <  0.7 and 
FEV1  < 75% of predicted.  
• Evidence of air trappi[INVESTIGATOR_29043], OR 
residual volume >  120%,  OR pathologic confirmation of constrictive bronchiolitis.  
• Absence of infection in the respi[INVESTIGATOR_4352], documented with investigations directed by 
[CONTACT_4659], such as radiologic studies (radiographs or computed tomographic 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Biomarkers – Protocol #1202  
  Version 3.0 dated March 17, 2015  
 
 
3-4 scans) or microbiologic cultures (sinus aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_29044], 
sputum culture, or bronchoalveola r lavage).  
 
COP was previously termed bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP).  No 
consensus criteria for COP have been established following HCT , but recommendations have 
been published and will be used for this study .5  The diagnosis o f COP can be made on the basis 
of: 
• Lung biopsy showing organizing pneumonia OR both of the following:  
• Radiographic evidence of patchy or diffuse, “fluffy” consolidations, ground glass 
opacities, and/or nodules on chest radiograph or CT scan  
• Absence of infection in the respi[INVESTIGATOR_4352], documented with investigations directed by 
[CONTACT_4659], such as radiologic studies (radiographs or computed tomographic 
scans) or microbiologic cultures (sinus aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_29045] s creen, 
sputum culture, or bronchoalveolar lavage)  
 
Pulmonary function tests are NOT required to make the diagnosis of COP, but commonly reveal 
a forced vital capacity <  80% predicted (a restrictive defect).  
 
Lung injury data will be collected using CIBMTR forms 2100 and 2200 at Days 100, 180, 1 year 
and 2 years using FormsNet.  
 
3.7.Transplant -related Mortality (TRM)  
 
TRM is defined as death from causes other than relapse/progression of the disease for which the 
transplant was performed.   
 
Transplant -related mo rtality/Death is reported  using CIBMTR Forms [ADDRESS_28422] 
disease specific forms using FormsNet  at whichever time point ( Day 100, 180, 1 year, or 2 years) 
occurs first after death up to [ADDRESS_28423] who experience graft failure.  
 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Biomarkers – Protocol #1202  
  Version 3.0 dated March 17, 2015  
 
 
3-5 Graft failure is defined as failure to ever engraft neutrophils  (persistent ANC <  500/mm3) or 
irreversible decline (without additional cell infusions) to ANC <  500/mm3 following an initial 
engraftment.  Graft failure should not be declared prior to Day [ADDRESS_28424] blood transplants.  An exception to this rule is if the 
treating center determines graft failure occurred earlier than these timepoints AND additional 
cells were infused (ie, subsequent HCT).  Late graft failure (neutropenia following initial 
engraftment) should only be declared if the ANC is consistently below 500/mm3 and the 
neutropenia is persistent.  
 
3.9.Real -Time GVHD Data Analysis  
 
Near real -time (8-[ADDRESS_28425] diagn osis) data reviews of GVHD onset data will identify and 
resolve inconsistencies in interpretation of GVHD signs and symptoms between centers, thereby 
[CONTACT_29066], such as maximum severity, response to treatment and 
non-relapse mortality.  These  reviews will act as a surrogate to a single continuity grader used to 
resolve inconsistencies among attending physicians.  The value of “near real -time ana lyses” will 
be assessed by [CONTACT_29067].  The number of cases where adjudication differs from the participating 
center will be compared to the same rate on other BMT CTN studies where this type of review is 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_29046] .

4. ENROLLMENT, DATA COLLECTION AND SAMPLE COLLECTION/  
PROCESSING  
 
4.1.Enrollment Procedures  
 
Patients will be registered using the BMT CTN AdvantageEDC system.  Prior to initiation of 
conditioning regimen, an authorized user at the transplant center enters the patient demographics, 
consent date, and proposed start date for conditioning into Segmen t A in AdvantageEDC.  
 
The planned transplant date will dictate when pre -transplant samples should be collected.  The 
actual transplant date will be captured in the transplant form and dictate when post -transplant 
samples and clinical data will be collected .   
 
A visit schedule based on transplant date is displayed for printing and is referred to as ‘Segment 
A Follow -up.’ 
 
4.2.Study Monitoring  
 
4.2.1.  Follow -up Schedule  
 
The follow -up schedule for calendar -driven study visits is outlined in Table 4.2.1.    A detailed 
description of each of the forms and the procedures required for forms completion and 
submission can be found in the BMT CTN 1202 Biomarker Data Management Handbook .   
 
Forms that are not entered into AdvantageEDC within the specified time will be considered  
delinquent.  A missing form will continue to be requested either until the form is entered into the 
AdvantageEDC and integrated into the Data and Coordinating Center’s (DCC) master database 
or until an exception is granted and entered into the Missing For m Exception File, as detailed in 
the BMT CTN  AdvantageEDCSM User’s Guide . 
 
All subjects participating in BMT CTN [ADDRESS_28426] also participate in the NMDP/CIBMTR 
research database study “Protocol for a Research Database for Hematopoietic Cell 
Transplantation,  Other Cellular Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_29047] ,” as described in Chapter 
2.

5.1.Genetic/DNA Sample Sets and Future Studies  
 
The DNA resource created by [CONTACT_29069] a stand -alone 
GWAS discovery study, but it could contribute significantly as an independent study population 
for candidate gene validation studies or for validating ‘hits’ from G WAS discovery studies.  The 
decreasing cost of customized arrays such as the ImmunoChip and exome sequencing of selected 
genes, increases the likelihood that a well characterized cohort like the one we propose will 
become an important addition to the growi ng global “genetic and phenotype database (dbGaP)” 
maintained by [CONTACT_29070].  A sample size of [ADDRESS_28437].  Assuming approximately equal 
proportions of patients with related donor and unrelated donor results in 750 patients with each 
donor type.  The patients in each donor -type group will be divided into two equal groups of 375 
for testing and validation.  Table 5.1 shows the difference in cumulative incidence of acute 
GVHD between genotypic polymorphisms that can be detected with 80% power with a sample 
size of 375.  In this scenario, the outcome is defined as the cumulative incidence (p) of 
experiencing acute GVHD at 6 months, which may range from 20% for grade 3 -4 aGVHD to 
50% for grade [ADDRESS_28438] on the outcome.  The detectable 
differences were computed for various outcome probabilities, minor allele frequencies (MAF), 
and number of SNPs being tested simultaneousl y using a two -sided overall type I error rate of 
0.[ADDRESS_28439] a minimum difference ranging from 
14% to 18% with 1  SNP, ranging from 18% to 23% with 10 SNPs, and from 22% to 28% with 
100 SNPs.

BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   Biomarkers – Protocol #[ADDRESS_28440] patient’s prognosis, and to confirm their accuracy of prediction.  Therefore, 
we assessed the ability of the proposed resource to support s uch modeling and validation studies.  
In the context of future serum biomarker studies, modeling and validation may be conducted by 
[CONTACT_29071] (MA vs. NMA) and donor type (HLA -Identical 
sibling [ID sibs] vs. matched unrela ted donor [MUD] vs. mismatched unrelated donor 
[MMUD]), resulting in 6 separate subpopulations for potential modeling and validation.  Using 
CIBMTR data, we estimate that 26% of patients receive MA Sibs transplant, 19% NMA Sibs, 
22% MA MUD, 19% NMA MUD, 8%  MA MMUD, and 6% NMA MMUD.  Assuming patients 
in this study follow a similar subpopulation distribution, and after splitting each subpopulation 
into testing and validation sets,  we expect to have 195 MA Sibs, 144 NMA Sibs, 165 MA MUD, 
144 NMA MUD, 59 MA M MUD, and 43 NMA MMUD available for analysis.  In the validation 
stage, researchers are interested in prediction accuracy of the biomarker levels for subsequent 
clinical outcomes, described through sensitivity and specificity.  Table 5.2 shows the widths of  
95% confidence intervals for these measures when the clinical outcome has probabilities ranging 
from 20% to 50% for each subpopulation assuming an underlying specificity of 75% and 
sensitivity of 70%.  In general, there are sufficient sample sizes in the groups receiving matched 
sibling and matched unrelated donor transplant to estimate specificity and sensitivity with 
reasonable precision.

5.5.Pediatric Cohort  
 
One of the hypotheses to address is whether the concentration of GVHD biomarkers is lower in 
children than in adults at the time of GVHD onset.  The power to detect a two -fold difference  in 
biomarker concentration with a coefficient of variation (CV) of 2 was calculated for various rates 
of grade II - IV GVHD (Table 2) using a two -sided overall type I error of 0.05.   Bonferroni 
correction was used to correct for multiple comparisons in scenarios where two or more 
biomarkers are being compared simultaneously .  Assuming Grade II – IV GVHD occurs in 45% 
of children and 50% of adults, there is more than 90% power to detect a two -fold difference in 
biomarker concentration between children compared to adults when up to 50 biomarkers are 
compared simultaneously.  W hen Grade II – IV GVHD occurs in 35% of children and 40% of 
adults, there is more than 90% power to detect a difference of this size when up to 10 biomarkers 
are compared simultaneously and there is 83% power when [ADDRESS_28445] a two -fold difference in biomarker concentration between 
children and adults  with CV=2

B-3 1. Introduction  
We invite you to join this clinical trial, also 
known as a research study. We are doing 
this study because we want to learn more 
about what makes related and unrelated 
(allogeneic) bone marrow, blood stem cell 
and umbilical cord blood transplants work 
well.  
This study will include at least 1,[ADDRESS_28447] . 
This Consent Form will tell you about the 
purpose of the study, the possible risks and 
benefits, other options available to you, and 
your rights as a participant in the study.  
2. Study Purpose  
We invite you to join this research study 
because you are already receiving  a 
transplant. For this study, we are  collecting 
health information and extra  blood samples 
from transplant patients, like you.  If you 
agree to join the study, we will ask for: 1) 
information  about your health after your 
transplant (such as graft -versus -host disease 
(GVHD)) and 2) samples of your blood 
before and after  your transplant that we will 
use in future research studies.  We will use your health information and 
blood samples in future studies, but we don’t 
know what the studies will be about right 
now. For example, we may use your health 
information and blood samples to learn more 
about graft -versus -host disease (GVHD) or 
cancers that come back (relapse). Your 
health information and blo od samples may 
also be used for studies that aren’t about 
transplant.  
 
3. Right to Ask Questions and/or Withdra w 
You have the right to ask questions about 
the study at any time. If you have questions 
about the study  or you want to leave the 
study, please contact:  
[insert contact [CONTACT_29075]]  If you decide not to continue being in the 
study, you may choose not to allow future 
blood samples or data collec tion. You can  
also decide to have any blood samples you 
already provided destroyed ; however, 
samples and information that have already 
been shared with other researchers cannot be 
taken back or destroyed.

willingness to  stay in this study  
4. Your Health Information and Blood Samples 
If you agree to provide your health 
information and blood samples  for future 
research , here is what will happen:  
a.) Your health information (this will not 
include personal information such as 
your name) will be co llected during the 
2 years you are participating and given 
to the BMT CTN. This information will 
be tied to your blood samples and will be 
made available to researchers for future 
studies.  
b.) We will collect blood samples before 
and after transplant.  
▪ Before your transplant: We will 
collect about 1 tablespoon of blood 1 
time.  
▪ After your transplant: W e will 
collect  about  2 tablespoons of blood 
7 times over 90 days.  Each blood 
draw will be about 1 -2 weeks apart.   
▪ The blood will be drawn  either  from  
a central line or from  a vein in your 
arm.  
c.) The blood samples will be sent to the 
BMT CTN Repository for processing and storage. A repository is a place that 
protects, stores and sends out samples 
for approved research studies. All 
research samples will b e coded . A small 
sample of your blood may be sent to a 
laboratory partnering with BMT CTN 
Repository to count and describe the 
different white blood cell types in the 
sample. This information will be sent 
back to the Repository and stored with 
the other sa mple -related information.  
d.) Materials stored in the Repository will 
be used mainly by [CONTACT_29076]. 
In the future, the unused blood  samples 
and health information will be made 
available outside of this network (see 
section ‘ e’ below).  
e.) Researchers can apply to study the 
health information and blood samples in 
the Repository. The BMT CTN Steering 
Committee and/or the BMT CTN 
Executive Committee must approve each 
request before they will share samples or 
infor mation with resear chers. This is to 
make sure that the investigators 
requesting the samples are qualified, and 
that the research is of high quality.

B-5 f.) DNA from your stored blood samples 
might be used in genome -wide 
association (GWA) studies for a future 
project either done or  supported by [CONTACT_4878] (NIH). 
Genome -wide association studies are a 
way for scientists to find genes that have 
a role  in human disease or treatment. 
Each study can look at  millions of  
genetic changes at the same time . 
If your coded  samples are used in 
such a study, the researcher is 
required to add your test results and 
sample information into a shared, 
public research database. This public 
database is called the NIH Genotype and Phenotype Database and it is 
managed by [CONTACT_29077] (NCBI). 
It is very unlikely that the NCBI 
could identify you, or link you to 
your information or research 
samples.   
 
Your blood will be used only for research 
and will not be sold. The research done with 
your blood may help to develop new 
products in the future.  You will not get paid 
for any samples or for any products that may 
be developed from current or future 
research.  
 
5. Risks and Discomforts  
The risk of injury while being in this study 
is considered small.  
 
If your blood samples are collected from 
your arm (instead of your central line), you  
may bleed a little bit and/or develop a small 
bruise. Infection from blood draws is rare, 
but may happen . If you are uncomfortable at 
the sight of blood you may feel light -headed 
or faint.   
 A possible risk is the loss of confidentiality 
about your medical information. We will use 
safety measures with both your samples and 
health information  to make sure that your 
personal information will be kept pr ivate. 
It’s very unlikely that your personal 
information will be given to someone else  
(see the Privacy, Confidentiality and Use of 
Information section below) .   
 
6. Possible Benefits
Takin g part in this study will not make your 
health better. You will not get any direct 
benefit from taking part in this study. The 
information from this study will help doctors 
and researchers learn more about  how well 
unrelated transplant works as treatment for 
people with a blood disease.  This information could help people with a 
blood disease  who may need a transplant in 
the future .

A. Why am I here?  
We invite you to join this research study because you are already recei ving a transplant. For 
this study, we will ask you for information about your health (health information) and extra  
blood samples .   
B. Why are you doing this study?  
We are collecting heal th information and blood samples from transplant patients, like you, to 
learn more about what makes transplants work well. We will use your health information and 
blood samples in future research studies.  
C. What will happen to me  if I join the study ? 
If you say you want to be in the study, we will ask you for a few things:  
▪ Information about your health after your transplant.      
▪ Some blood samples before and after your transplant.  
­ Before your transplant: We will collect about 1 tablespoon of blood 1 tim e.

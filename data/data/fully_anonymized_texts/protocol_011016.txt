Title of trial Phase IIa, multicentre, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled,  
study  to evaluate the safety , tolerabilit y and efficacy of  treatment 
with BI 655130 in adult patients with moderate to severe atopic 
dermatitis
Coordinating 
InvestigatorN/A
Trial site(s) Multi -centre trial
Clinical phase IIa
Trial rationale Although the pre -clinical data and rationale for the use of an IL-36R 
antagonist in atopic dermatitis ( AD) are strong, there are no data on 
the use of an IL -[ADDRESS_225630] i npatients with AD. Thus, a 
small proof of clinical concept study  is planned to assess safet y, 
tolerability and efficacy  in patients with moderate to severe AD.
Trial objective(s) Theprimary  objective sof this trial areto investigate the safety, 
tolerability andefficacy  of BI 655130 in adult patients with moderate 
to severe atopic dermatitis following repeated intravenous 
administrations of 600 mg compared to placebo .
Trial e ndpoints Primary  endpoint
Percentage change from baseline in EASI at Week 16 
Secondary  endpoint
Number of patients with drug related AEs
Absolute and p
ercentage change from baseline in EASI  at
Week 4 
Proportion of patients with a 50% improvement from baseline 
in EASI  (EASI50) at Week 4 and 16
Proportion of patients with a 75% improvement from baseline 
in EASI  (EASI75) at Week 4 and 16
Change from baseline in SCORAD at Week 4 and 16 
Proportion of patients achieving at least a 2 -grade reduction 
from baseline to clear (0) or almost clear (1) in IGA at Week 4 
and 16
Trial design Double-blind, randomised, placebo- controlled comparison of two 
groups over 16 weeks
Total n umber of patient s
randomisedApproximately  45 patients will be entered in the study

1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND
Atopic Dermatitis (AD) is an immune- mediated skin disease characterized by  [CONTACT_190215] (ery thema) and an intense and unrelenting itch (prutitis). In 
common terminology  AD is often referred to as Eczema, the term for a variety of skin 
conditions, of which AD is the most severe. Diagnosis is based on a patient’s medical history , 
characteristic clinical findings and exclusion of other skin conditions [ P18-[ZIP_CODE]]. The 
hallmark of AD is pruritus tha t is responsible for much of the disease burden for patients and 
their families. Pruritus can be persistent and consequently  can disrupt sleep and/or cause 
anxiety  ordepression [ R18-2681, R18 - 2680 ]. Other clinical features of AD include skin 
dryness, ery thema (redness), oozing, crusting, and lichenification ( skin that has become 
thickened and leathery ). 
Worldwide, the lifetime prevalence of AD has increased over the last 30 years occurrin g in
10–20% of the population in developed countries. Prevalence is lower, but increasing, in 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_14696] [ R18-
2667]. Ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y, AD develops during childhood with 
approximately  60% of cases occurring in the first ye ar of life [ P06-[ZIP_CODE]; R18- 2668]. I n 
about 70% of cases ,the disease greatly  improves or resolves in childhood, but the remaining 
30% of patients go on to have a remitting and relapsing condi tion with repeated flares [ R18-
2668 ; R18-2663 ].
AD appears to have a more heterogeneous pathophy siology  than previously  thought. Unlike 
chronic plaque psoriasis that is almost exclusively  driven by  [CONTACT_40690]17 pathway , AD involves 
multiple immune axes involving expression of multiple cy tokines and chemokines, including 
IL-13, IL -4, IL -33,IL-17and IL -22.IL-[ADDRESS_225660] s and may  be a critical link between S. aureus infection and 
exacerbation of AD inflammation.
In human skin tissues, IL36R is expressed in keratinocy tes, dermal fibroblasts and infiltrating 
myeloid cells.  IL36R activation in skin tissue drives the production of inflamm atory  
mediators (e.g. CCL20, MI P
-1β, TNF -β, IL12, IL17, IL23, TGF -β) and modulates the 
expression of tissue remodeling genes (e.g. MMPs, TGF- β). The link between IL36R and 
AD is based on data demonstrating upregulation of human IL36 Rand IL 36(and IL36 α) 
expression in A D skin biopsies compared to normal control skin as well as data showing 
IL36R functionality  in disease relevant primary  human cells. In addition, there is data 
demonstrating enhanced IL- 36 signaling in human macrophages via the TH2 cy tokine (IL4) 
pathway . 
Recent data suggest that IL36 Rmay also play  a role in the pathogenesis of A D via a specific 
pathway  related to S. aureus infection [R18-2666, R18 - 2669 ]. These papers show 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_190200] S. aureus induces an inflammatory  response mediated b y IL-[ADDRESS_225661]  and that IL36R deficiency  or blockade results in a reduction of the skin 
inflammation induced by S. aureus derived virulent PSMα peptides [ R18-2666 , R18-2669 ]. 
These studies demonstrated a clear link to the IL36 pathway  suggesting IL36 pathway  
activation may  represent an earl y and persistent event in the development of A D disease.

1.2.1 Mode of Action
BI 655130 is a humanized antagonistic monoclonal IgG1 antibod y that blocks human IL36R
signaling. Binding of BI 655130 to IL36R is anticipated to prevent the activation of IL36R by  
[CONTACT_190216] (IL36 α, β and γ) and subseque nt downstream activation of pro- inflammatory  
and pro -
fibrotic pathways with the aim to reduce epi[INVESTIGATOR_1231]/ fibroblast/ immune cell -
mediated inflammation and interrupt the inflammatory  response that drives pathogenic 
cytokine production in inflammatory  diseases including AD , generalized pustular psoriasis 
(GPP), palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
1.2.2 Nonclinical pharmacology
Preclinical studies
BI 655130 binds to human IL36R with a binding avidity  of less than 1 pM. BI 655130
inhibits IL36 ligand -stimulated NF -B activation in HT29 and transformed epi[INVESTIGATOR_190201]90 values in a 
consistent range of 0.7 to 3.7 nM. BI 655130 also inhibits IL8 release in primary  human 
intestinal my ofibroblasts andIFNγ secretion in human peripheral blood mononuclear cell
(PBMC )stimulated with IL36α, IL36β, or IL36γ combined with IL 12.
Mutations of two key  residues (L 234 and L235) to alanine were made to BI [ADDRESS_225663] of the mutations 
in the IgG1 FcR binding sites on both antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxic ity (ADCC) and 
complement -dependent cy totoxicity  (CDC ) effector functions revealed that the mutations 
abrogate both ADCC and CDC effector functions and indicate that BI 655130 will be a non -
depleting therapy in vivo.
Toxicology studies
As BI 655130 does n ot demonstrate adequate pharmacological activit y in common
toxicology  species, a surrogate antibod y (BI 674304) specific for mouse IL36R was
developed and used for toxicology  assessments. In a 13 -week intravenous toxicity  study  of BI 
674304 in mice, no adverse effects of IL36R antagonism were seen at a dose (50 mg/kg, 
twice weekly ) that was [ADDRESS_225664] level (NOAEL) was 
considered to be 50 mg/kg/dose.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_225665]-03(15.0)/Saved on:30.Nov 2017In developmental and reproductive t oxicity  studies there was no evidence of effects on 
fertility  or embry onic development in mice after administration of 50 mg/kg/dose of BI

completed for BI 655130; 4 phase I trials wer e conducted in health y volunteers (HV), [ADDRESS_225667] been exposed to single or multiple doses of BI 655130 
in 4 phase I studies which assessed safet y, tolerability , PK and PD of BI 655130 in healthy  
volunteers [c09985235 -01]. 
Study  1368.1 was a single escalating dose t rial with i.v. infusions of placebo or BI 
655130 up to 10 mg/kg [ c09985235-01]. The most frequentl y reported treatment -
emergent AEs were nasophary ngitis (BI 655130: 20.7%; placebo: 15.0%), headache 
(BI 655130: 8.6%; p lacebo: 15.0%), influenza like illness (BI 655130: 6.9%; placebo: 
10.0%), and diarrhoea (BI 655130: 3.4%; placebo: 10.0%). All AEs were of mild or 
moderate intensit y and were resolved b y the end of the trial.There were no serious 
AEs and no AEs that led to discontinuation of trial drug.
Study  1368.2 was a multiple rising dose trial with subjects receiving up to 20 mg/kg 
in a single intravenous infusion weekly for 4 weeks. The incidence of nervous system 
disorders (especiall y headache) appeared to be higher in the 20 mg/kg BI 655130 
group than in the other treatment groups. Two subjects experienced d yspnoea onl y in 
the 20 mg/kg group. Additionally , gastrointestinal disorders (diarrhoea and nausea) 
and nasophary ngitis appeared to occur more often in subjects w ho received BI [ADDRESS_225668] in the 20 mg/kg BI 655130 treatment group.
Study  1368.3 was a relative bioavailability  trial in 36 subjects of a subcutaneous (s.c.) 
formulation of BI 655130 at two different dose strengths (150 mg and 300mg). The 
most frequent local events reported were redness and swelling at the injection site, all 
were mild in intensity , occurred within 30 minutes after inje ction and completely  
resolved within 4 hours. There were no reports of injection site pain.
Study  1368.9 was a single rising dosing trial in 32 Japanese healthy  volunteers 
receiving different i.v. doses of BI 655130 (300 mg, 600 mg, and 1200 mg) or one 
subcutaneous dose (300 mg). Adverse events by  [CONTACT_190217], chest incomfort, and allergic rhinitis, while AEs reported on BI 
655130 were upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_23739] (300 mg i.v.), contusion (600 mg i.v.), 
gastroenteritis (1 200 mg i.v.), and temporomandibular joint sy ndrome (1200 mg i.v.). 
None of the observed AEs were judged b y the investigator as related to the trial 
medication.
The first study  in patients was conducted as an open- label, single arm phase I  study  to 
explore the safet y, tolerability , PK and efficacy  of BI 655130 in GPP (1368.11). A total of 7 
patients with acute GPP were enrolled and treated with a single intravenous dose of BI 
655130 (10 mg/kg). Proof-of- concept was achieved with the first 7 patients treated, who 
showed rapid clinical responses to single administrations of BI 655130 with good safet y and

response in s ystemic components (C -Reactive Protein [CRP] approaching normalization 
within 4 weeks). All patients (7/7) reported at least 1 AE while on -treatment and in 4 patients 
(57.4%) AEs considered drug -related b y the investigators were reported. None of the reported 
AEs was severe, serious or led to discontinuation.The most frequentl y reported treatment -
emergent AE was arthralgia (3 out of 7 patients [42.9%]). Eosinophilia, chills, oedema 
peripheral, py rexia, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_2826], and eczema were each reported in 2 
patients [28.6%]
Study  1368.15, a randomis ed placebo controlled study  investigated the safety , tolerability , 
pharmacokinetics, pharmacogenomics and efficacy of 2 intravenous doses of BI 655130 in 59 
patients with palmoplantar pustulosis psoriasis. Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 
allocation rat io and received either 900 mg BI 655130, 300 mg BI 655130 or placebo 
intravenously  every  4 weeks over a period of 12 weeks. The proportion of patients who 
achieved ppPASI50 at Week 16 in the total population was similar in all treatment groups (6 
of 19 in 900 mg BI 655130 arm, 6 of 19 in 300 mg BI 655130 arm, and 5 of 21 in placebo 
arm). However, post -hoc subgroup anal yses indicated efficacy  of both doses of BI 655130 in 
patients with more severe PPP disease at baseline (above the median PPPASI  value of 16.7). 
In particular, the results on pustule severity  were pronounced with a rapid reduction in 
pustule severity  with evidence of a dose response relationship.
In total, 85.7% in the placebo arm and 89.5% in each of the BI 655130 arms (300 mg and 900 
mg) rep orted at least 1 AE while on treatment. There were 3 AEs leading to discontinuation 
of trial drug in the placebo arm (14.3%), whereas 1 patient in the 300 mg dosing arm (5.3%) 
and 3 patients in the 900 mg dosing arm (15.8%) discontinued trial medication due to an 
adverse event. The most frequentl y reported treatment -emergent AE were nasophary ngitis 
(placebo 38.1%, 300 mg BI 655130 26.3%, 900 mg BI 655130 42.1%) and headache 
(placebo 33.3%, 300 mg BI 655130 21.1%, 900 mg BI 655130 31.6%).
PK data indicate t arget -mediated drug disposition (TMDD) of BI 655130. The saturation of 
the non
-linear elimination pathway  is likely  occurring after 0.3 mg/kg and BI655130 exhibits 
linear kinetics at dose -level greater than 0.3 mg/kg. The half -life of BI655130 is 
approxima tely 4 weeks in the linear dose range and thus similar to otherIgG1 molecules. 
In one patient an infusion related reaction was reported. The patient felt “heat” after the 
infusion of the trial medication during Visit 3. The event was not accompanied by  [CONTACT_190218], in particular vital signs remained stable. The patient recovered without treatment. 
There were no clinicall y relevant abnormalities on treatment with BI [ADDRESS_225670] who

strong, there are no clinical data on this mechanism of action in AD. Thus, a small proof of 
clinical concept stud y is planned to assess safet y, tolerability and efficacy  in patients with 
moderate to severe AD. 
In order to be able to address future scientific questions, patients will be asked to voluntarily  
donate biospecimens for banking (please see Section 5.4). If the patient agrees, banked 
samples may  be used for futur e biomarker research and drug development projects , e.g. to 
identify  patients that are more likely  to benefit from a treatment or experience an adverse 
event (AE) , or to gain a mechanistic or genetic understanding of drug effects and thereb y 
better match p atients with therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]
.
1.4 BENEFIT - RISK ASSESSMENT
The positive efficacy  data obtained in GPP (trial 1368.11) confirms BI 655130's mechanism 
of action of effectively  blocking the IL36 pathway thereb y providing support for potential 
benefit in diseases where the IL36 pathway  appears to contribute to disease. Furthermore, the 
clinical safet y data support clinical studies in patients with repeat doses up to 20mg/kg
IV qw.
There is no direct benefit for individual participants in this study , because efficacy  ofBI 
[ADDRESS_225674] an infusion reaction at a dose of 20 mg/kg, thus 
patients in this trial will be closel y monitored for infusion reactions, including measurement 
of pulse and blood pressure prior to infusion and approximately 5and [ADDRESS_225675] trial in patients with atopic dermatitis, patients with active infection or certain 
chronic infections (HIV, HBV, TB) will be excluded.

earlyembry onic development studies. There was no evidence of effects o n fertility  or 
embry onic development (teratogenicity ) in mice after admini stration of 10 or 50 mg/kg/dose.
Thus, m en and women of child bearing potential with appropriate birth control can be 
included in clinical trials with BI [ADDRESS_225677] of clinical trials in pediatric
patients, pregnancy  and lactation. Until such data are available, these patients will be
excluded from this study (
1368-0032).
Currently  there are no data available to suggest interactions of BI 655130 with other drugs 
[c03320877
-05].
Considering the medical need for development of an effective and well tolerated drug for the 
therap y of AD, the benefit of this trial is considered to outweigh the potential risks and 
justifies the administration of multiple dosesof BI 655130 to patients with AD to investigate
safet y, tolerabilit yandefficacy .

CONTROL GROUP(S)
The placebo control is required to control for investigator bias and/or beneficial effects of 
being in a clinical trial. The 2:1 randomization (active: placebo) is warranted in order to 
maximize the number of patients receiving active treatment and is bein g controlled for from a 
statistical standpoint. The rationale for switching responding patients to follow -up with no -
treatment atWeek16 is to evaluate the duration of clinical response off treatment. I n addition, 
patients who have not attained at least a 75% reduction in EASI  score compared to baseline
will have the opportunity to receive (or continue) active treatment .

A fixed rather than weight -based dose regimen of single dose of 600 mg has been selected .
Early trials of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies often investigate bod y-weight –based 
regimens to reduce the in ter-subject variability  in drug exposure. However, there is generall y 
only a modest contribution of body  weight to the overall pharmacokinetic (PK) and 
pharmacod ynamic (PD) variability  of monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, monoclonal 
antibodies are highl ytarget specific and offer a relatively  large therapeutic window compared 
to new chemical entities. Therefore, most monoclonal antibodies are approved at fixed doses 
in antibody /target excess in order to cover target turnover and maximize efficacy  [R10-6267 ;
R13-4749 ;R13-4753 ;R13-4750 ;R13-4754 ].
4.1.3 Method of assigning patients to treatment groups
An Interactive Response Technology (IRT) willbeused toscreen andrandomise eligible 
patients, perform subsequent drug assignment, manage initial/re -suppl yordering ofdrug
supplies andhandle emergency un-blinding. Theinvestigator willreceive allnecessary
instructions toaccess IRTfrom theSponsor orchosen provider. Detailed IRT functions and 
procedures willbedocumented intheuser requirement specifications mutually  agreed toby
[CONTACT_190220]. Patients willberandomly assigned toone of thetreatment
groups through theassignment ofmedication which willbetreatment group -specific (Section 
3.1).Fortechnical andstatistical features ofthetreatment allocation process, please see.
Sections 4.1.4 and7.6.
During Visit 2 (W0) and after the patient’s eligibility  has been confirmed, the treatment will 
be assigned via IRT. Patients will be r andomized to receive BI 655130 600 mg or placebo in 
a ratio of 2:1. The assignment will occur in a blinded fashion via IRT. 
During Visit 7(W16) patients will be evaluated with the EASI  scoring s ystem (see Section 
5.1) and based on the response will be reassigned via I RT to receive BI 655130 600 mg or no 
treatment at all .  The re -assignement will occur in an open label fashion.
4.1.4 Drug assignment and administration of doses for each patient
In all patients, the infusion solution is intended to be intravenousl y administered over a 
period of 90 minutes. In case of safet y concerns, e.g. due to infusion reactions, it is at the 
discretion of the investigator or his/her designee to adapt the infusion scheme, including but 
not limited to slowing down the infusion rate, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_51119], and provided no further 
safet y concern exists, restarting at a slower rate. Regardless, the total duration of infusion 
should not exceed 180 minutes (3 hours). Further based on his/her medica l judgment the 
investigator will provide medications as needed.
The administration of the trial medication will be done under the supervision of the 
investigating ph ysician or a designee. The so -called four- eye principle (two- person rule) 
should be applied for administration of trial medication and – if applicable –its preparation, 
if correct dosage cannot be ensured otherwise.

this test has a positive result , the administration of study  drug should not proceed and this 
urine test should be confirmed by  a serum pregnancy  test.
4.1.5 Blinding and procedures for unblinding
[IP_ADDRESS] Blinding
Patient s, investigators and every one involved in trialconduct or analy sisor with an y other
interest in this double -blind trialwill remain blinded with regard to the random isedtreatment 
assignments until after the data base lock (DBL) for the primary  anal ysis.The randomisation
code will be kept secret by [CONTACT_190221] [ADDRESS_225702] patient completed to 
allow for the exclusion from the anal yses ofpharmacokinetic ( PK) samples taken from 
placebo patient s. Bioanaly tics will not disclose the randomisation code or the results of their 
measurements until the trialis officially  unblinded.
[IP_ADDRESS] Unblinding and breaking the code
Emergency  unblinding will be available to the investigator via IRT. It must only  be used in
an emergency situation when the identity  of the trialdrug must be known to the investigator
in order to provide appropriate medical treatment or otherwise assure safety  of trial
participants . The reason for unblinding must be documented in the source documents and/ or 
appropriate CRF page.
Due to the requirements to report Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
(S[LOCATION_003]Rs), it may  be necessary  for a representative from BI’sPharmacovigilance group to 
access the randomisation code for individual patients during trialconduct. The access to the 
code will only  be given to authorised Pharmacovigilance representatives and not be shared 
further.

5.[ADDRESS_225714] been used in numerous AD studies, 
including the E czema Area and Severity  Index (EASI ), the scoring of atopic dermatitis 
(SCORAD) , Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) and Dermatology  Quality  of Life Ind ex 
(DLQI) .
The primary  efficacy  endpoint for this trial is percent change in EASI Score at Week 16 
compared to Baseline . Secondary  endpoints include EASI 50, EASI 75, SCORAD and IGA. 
An interim anal ysis of change in EASI at Week 4 will be conducted when 75% of patients 
have completed the Week 4 visit. The details of these assessments are described below.
EASI
The EASI scoring s ystem is based on the psoriasis area and severity  index (PASI ) used 
routinely  in patients with psoriasis to describe signs and s everit y of the disease. The principle 
of integrating disease extent and severity  to describe disease led to the definition of the EASI  
[R18-2665 ]. The EASI  score assesses the extent of disease at four body  sites and measures
four clinical signs: (1) erythema, (2) induration/papulation, (3) excoriation, and (4) 
lichenification, each on a scale of zero to three. The EASI score confers a maximum of 72 
and evaluates two dimensions of AD: disease extent and clinical signs. The sug gested 
severit y strata for the EASI  are as follows: 0 = clear; 0.1 –1.0 = almost clear; 1.1 –7.0 = mild; 
7.1–21.0 = moderate; 21.1 –50.0 = severe; 50.1 –72.0 = very  severe [ R18-2851 ]. The EASI  
score does not assess symptoms like pruritus and sleep loss [ R18-2670 ].
SCORAD
The SCORAD index will also be included in the clinical trials and has three elements: extent 
of disease, disease severity  and subjective s ymptoms. These combine to give a maximum
possible score of 103. The commonly  used SCORAD strata to classify  AD severit y are mild 
= 0–25, moderate = 26 –50 and severe = 51 –103 [ R18-2664 , R18-2679 ]. 
IGA
The IGA scale allows investigators to assess overall disease severit y at one given time point, 
and it consists of a five -point severity  scale from clear to severe disease (0= clear,1 =almost 
clear, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4= severe). The IGA scale uses cli nical characteristics of 
erythema, infiltration, papulation, oozing and crusting as guidelines for the overall severity  
assessment [ R18-2670 ].

The DLQI is a patient -administered, ten -question, quality  of life quest ionnaire that covers six
domains including s ymptoms and feelings, dail y activities, leisure, work and school, personal
relationships and treatment [ R05-2548 ]. The DL QI has a one -week recall period. Response
categories include “not relevant” (score of 0), “not at all” (score of 0), “a little” (score of 1),
“a lot” (score of 2) and “very  much” (score of 3). Question 7 is a “y es”/ “no” question where
“yes” is scored as 3. DLQI total score is calculated by  [CONTACT_190229] s of each question 
resulting in a range of 0 to 30 where 0 -1 = no effect on patient’s life, 2 -5 = small effect, 6 -10 
= moderate effect, 11 -20 = very  large effect, and 21 -30 = extremel y large effect on patient’s 
life. The higher the score, the more the qual ity of life is impaired. A 4- point change from 
baseline is considered a clinically  important difference [ R18-1988 ].
5.2 A SSESSMENT OFSAFETY
Safety  will be assessed descriptivel y based on:
• Adverse events (including drug-related AEs)
•Adverse events of special interest (AESI)
•Serious adverse events (SAEs)
•Safety  laboratory  tests
•Physical examination
•Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, bod y temperature)
• 12- lead ECG
•Infusion site reactions
•Immunogenicit y (ADA)
5.2.1 Physical examination
Complete and targeted phy sical examinations will be performed at visits as described in the 
Flow Chart . Height and weight of the patient will be recorded at the Screening Visit only.
Complete phy sical examination w ill include general appearance as well as evaluation of all 
organ s ystems. Targeted phy sical examination will evaluation of organ s ystems associated 
with AE(s) s ymptoms or laboratory  abnormalities.
Clinically  relevant abnormal findings will be reported as baseline conditions or AEs.
5.2.2 Vital signs
Vital signs evaluations will be performed at visits as shown in the Flow Chart . This includes
measuring temperature, pulse rate and systolic/diastolic blood pressure. Vital signs will be 
measured after patients have been sitting comfortably  for at least [ADDRESS_225716] of 
blood sampling on the vital measurements.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_225717]-03(15.0)/Saved on:30.Nov 2017At visits with i.v. administration, vital signs will be assessed pre -dose, at approximately  5 
minutes after the end of infusion and 60 minutes after the end of infusion.
During i.v. d rug administration, patients should be closely  monitored for signs and s ymptoms 
of hy persensitivity  reactions for approximately  1 hour after the end of study  drug 
administration.
Hypersensitivity  reactions should be treated according to medical standards. Pre-medications 
for further infusions might be considered and will be agreed on between investigator and BI 
CTM .
5.2.3 S afety laboratory parameters
For the assessment of laboratory  parameters, blood and urine samples will be collected b y the 
trial site at the time points indicated in the Flow Chart .
The parameters that will be determined are listed in Table 5.2.3: 1. The laboratory  tests will 
be performed at a central laboratory .
However, local labs may  be used for dosing decisions at visits involving i.v. administration of
BI 655130 or placebo . The lab tests listed in Table 5.2.3: 1canbe collected and assessed 
locally  by [CONTACT_190230]; however, split or concurrent samples will be drawn and sent to the central 
laboratory  for anal ysis.
In case the criteria for hepatic injury  are fulfilled, a number of additional measures will be 
performed (please see Section [IP_ADDRESS] and the Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI )Checklist 
provided in the I SF and the ele ctronic data capture (eDC) system). The amount of blood 
taken from the patient concerned will be increased due to this additional sampling.
Clinically  relevant abnormal findings (e.g. anemia, hy poproteinemia, hy poalbuminemia, 
hypocalcemia etc.) will be re ported as baseline conditions or AEs. A clinically  relevant value 
may be either in -or outside the reference range. Clinically  relevant abnormal laboratory  test 
results must be confirmed using an unscheduled visit laboratory kit and should be repeated 
until normalization or stabilization or until an alternative explanation has been found. 
Abnormal laboratory  values will also be graded for intensity  by [CONTACT_190231] 2.0 
criteria [R13-3515 ].

the patient’s medical file.
Clinically  relevant abnormal findings will be repo rted either as baseline condition (if 
identified at the screening visit) or as adverse events and will be followed up and/or treated as 
medically  appropriate.
Other Safety Parameters:
In case of an infusion reaction, monitor the patient per standard of c are, grade the intensity  of 
the reaction according to RCTC V2 grading (cf. ISF) and proceed as described in Section 
4.2.1 .
All cases of malignancies that are detected during the trial will be reported as SAEs. 
5.2.5 Assessment of adverse events
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions of AEs 
Adverse event
An AE is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessaril y have to have a 
causal relationship with this treatment.
An AE can therefore be any  unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
Serious adverse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an y AE ,which fulfils at least one of the 
following criteria:
-results in death,
-is life -threatening, which refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hy pothetically  might have 
caused death if more severe,
-requires in patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956] ,
-requires prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956],
- results in persistent or signif icant disability  or incapacity , 
-is a congenital anomal y /birth defect,
-is deemed serious for any other reason if it is an important medical event when based 
on appropriate medical judgement which may jeopardise the patient and may  require 
medical or surg ical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
above definitions.
Boehringer Ingelheim 12 Feb 2020
BI Trial No.: 1368-0032
c23806995 -04 Clinical Trial Protocol Page 43of 85
Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_225722]-03(15.0)/Saved on:30.Nov 2017Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospit alisation or 
development of dependency  or abuse. 
AEs considered “Alway s Serious”
Cancers of new histology and exacerbations of existing cancer must be classified as a serious 
event regardless of the duration between discontinuation of the drug and must be reported as 
described in Section 5.2.5 .2, subsections “AE Collection” and “AE reporting to sponsor and 
timelines”.
In accordance with the European Medicines Agency initiative on Important Medical Events,
Boehringer Ingelheim has developed a list of further AEs, which b y their nature, can alway s 
be considered to be “serious” even though they  may  not have met the criteria of an SAE as 
defined above.
The latest list of “Alway s Serious AEs” can be found in the eDC system.
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs)
The term AESI relates to any  specific AE that has been identified at the project level as being 
of particular concern for prospective safet y monitoring and safet y assessment within this trial, 
e.g. the p otential for AEs based on knowledge from other compounds in the same class. 
AESI s need to be reported to the sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Department within the same 
timeframe that applies to SAEs, please see below .
The following are considered as AESIs:
Hepatic injury
Hepatic Injury , is defined by  [CONTACT_15624]:
An elevation of AST and/or AL T ≥3-fold ULN combined with an elevation of total 
bilirubin ≥2-fold UL N measured in the same blood sample , or
Aminotransferase (ALT, and/or AST) elevations ≥ [ADDRESS_225723] provided in the I SF. In case of a DILI, it will be up to the investigator to keep the 
patient in t he trial as long as he considers he/she can perform all planned procedures. In case 
of clinical s ymptoms of hepatic injury  (icterus, unexplained encephalopathy , unexplained 
coagulopath y, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, etc.) without lab results (ALT, AST, total 
bilirubin) available, the investigator should make sure these parameters are anal ysed,if 
necessary  in an unscheduled blood test. Should the results meet the criteria of hepatic injury  
alert, the procedures described in the DILI checklist should be followed.

Opportunistic and my cobacterium tuberculosis infections
These include pneumocystis jirovecii, BK virus disease including PVAN, CMV, post-
transplant ly mphoproliferative disorder (EBV), progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy , 
bartonellosis (disseminated only ), blastomy cosis, toxoplasmosis, coccidioidomy cosis, 
histoplasmosis, aspergillosis (invasive only), candidiasis (invasive or pha ryngeal),

(invasive only ), vibriosis (invasive due to vibrio vulnificus), HCV progression [R17-2617].
Protocol -specified AESI can be classified as serious or non- serious but all AESI  must be 
reported in an expedited manner similar to serious adverse events on a SAE form (i.e. non 
serious AESI must be reported on the SAE form and follow the same reporting timelines as 
for serious AEs).
Intensit y (severit y) of AEs
The intensity  grading of AEs will be performed according to RCTC Version 2.0 developed 
by [CONTACT_190232]  (OMERACT) or ganization [R13-3515 ]. 
Refer to 
the ISF for intensit y/severity  classification.
Intensit y options are:
Grade 1 mild
Grade 2 moderate
Grade 3 severe
Grade 4 life -threatening
Causal relationship of AEs
Medical judg ement should be used to determine the relationship, considering all relevant 
factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de -challenge or re -challenge, 
confounding factors such as concomitant medication, concomitant diseases and relevant 
history .

c23806995 -04 Clinical Trial Protocol Page 45of 85
Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_225725]-03(15.0)/Saved on:30.Nov 2017Arguments that may  suggest that there is a reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship 
could be :
The event is consistent with the known pharmacology  of the drug .
The event is known to be caused b y or attributed to the drug class.
A plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure.
Evidence that the event is reproducible when the drug is re- introduced .
No medicall y sound alternative aetiologies that could explain the event (e.g. pre-
existing or concomitant diseases, o r co-medications).
The event is t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y drug -related and infrequent in the general population not 
exposed to drugs (e.g. Stevens -Johnson sy ndrome).
An indication of dose -response (i.e. greater effect size if the dose is increased, smaller 
effect size if dose is reduced ).
Arguments that may  suggest that there is no reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship 
could be:
No plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure is evident 
(e.g. pre -treatment cases, diagnosis of cancer or chronic disease within days /weeks 
of drug administration; an allergic reaction weeks after discontinuation of the drug 
concerned).
Continuation of the event despi[INVESTIGATOR_15576], taking into 
account the pharmacological properties of the compound (e.g. after 5 half -lives).
Of note, this criterion may not be applicable to events whose time course is prolonged 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_15577].
Additional arguments amongst those stated before, like alternative explanation (e.g. 
situations where other drugs or underl ying diseases appear to provide a more likely  
explanation for the observed event than the drug concerned).
Disappearance of the event even though the trialdrug treatment continues or remains 
unchanged.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse event col lection and reporting
AE Collection
The investigator shall maintain and keep detailed records of all AEs in the patient files.
The following must be collected and documented on the appropriate CRF(s) by  [CONTACT_1275]:
From signing the in formed consent onwards until the individual patient ’send of trial:
oall AEs (serious and non -serious) and all AESI s
After the individual patient ’s end of trial:
the investigator does not need to activel y monitor the patient for new AEs but should 
only report any occurrence of cancer and related SAEs and related AESI s of which the 
investigator may become aware of by [CONTACT_23321], e.g. phone call.
Those AEs should however not be reported in the CRF .

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_225726]-03(15.0)/Saved on:30.Nov 2017AE reporting to the sponsor and timelines
The investigator must report SAEs, AESI s, and non -serious AEs which are relevant for the 
reported SAE or AESI, on the BI SAE form immediatel y (within 24 hours) t o the s ponsor’s 
unique entry point (country  specific reporting process will be provided in the I SF). The same 
timeline applies if follow- up information becomes available. In specific occasions, the 
investigator could inform the sponsor upfront via telephone. This does not replace the 
requirement to complete and send the BI SAE form.
With receipt of an y further information to these events, a follow -up SAE form has to be 
provided. For follow -up information the same rules and timeline apply  as for initial 
information.
Information required
For each AE, the investigator should provide the information requested on the appropriate 
eCRF pages and, if applicable, the BI SAE form. The investigator should determine the 
causal relationship to the trial medication.
The following should also be recorded as an (S)AE in the CRF and, if a pplicable, BI SAE 
form:
Worsening of the underly ing disease or of other pre -existing conditions .
Changes in vital signs, ECG, phy sical examination and laboratory  test results, if they  
arejudged clinically  relevant by  [CONTACT_093].
If such abnormaliti es already  pre-exist prior to trial inclusion they will be considered as 
baseline conditions and should be collected in the eCRF only . All (S)AEs, inc luding those 
persisting after a patient’s end of trial, must be followed up until they have resolved, have
been a ssessed as “chronic”or “stable”, or no further information can be obtained.
Pregnancy
Urine pregnancy  testing should be done prior to study  drug administration. Study  drug should 
only be administered in case of a negative test result. I n case of a positive urine pregnancy  
test, a serum pregnancy  test will be done. Women who underwent tubal ligation are still 
considered of childbearing potential and pregnancy testing is necessary  as well. The testing 
schedule is specified in the Flow Chart .The patient will also be asked about their pregnancy  
status at the End of Study  Safety  Phone C all.
In rare cases, pregnancy  might occur in a clinical trial. Once a patient has been enrolled in the 
clinical trialand has taken trialmedication, the investigator must report any drug exposure 
during pregnancy  in a trialparticipant immediately  (within 24 hours) by  [CONTACT_15627] A of 
the Pregnancy  Monitoring Form to the sponsor ’s unique entry  point.
The outcome of the pregnancy  associated with the drug exposure during pregnancy  must be 
followed up and reported to the s pons or’s unique entry  point on the Pregnancy  Monitoring 
Form for Studies (Part B).

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_225727]-03(15.0)/Saved on:30.Nov 2017The I SF will contain the Pregnancy  Monitoring Form for Studies (Part A and B) .
As pregnancy  itself is not to be reported as an AE, in the absence of an accompany ing SAE 
and/or AESI, only the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Studies and not the SAE form is to be 
completed. If there is an SAE and/or AESI associated with the pregnancy  an SAE form must 
be completed in addition.
Exemptions to SAE r eporting
For this study  there are no exemptions to SAE reporting .
5.3 DRUG CONCENTRATION M EASUREMENTS AND 
PHARMACOKINETICS
5.3.1 Assessment of pharmacokinetics
BI 655130 concentrations will be reported descriptively . It isnot intended to calculate PK 
paramet ers; however, if appropriate PKparameters might be calculated .PK data may be 
incorporated into a larger pharmacometric anal ysis with other trials of the BI [ADDRESS_225728].
Also, ADAs and neutralizing antibody  (Nabs )will be measured and their impact on PK will 
be assessed. The relationship between PK and selected efficacy  endpoints, biomarkers and 
AEs may  be assessed. PK and demographic data together with treatment assignments and 
dosing information may  be made available to individuals outside of the trial team for the 
purpose of PK dataset generation in accordance with sponsor’s standard procedures.
Refer to the Flow Chart for the time points of PK , ADA and Nab . Date and exact time of 
drug administration and PK, ADA and Nab will be recorded on CRFs. On visits wi thstudy  
medication dosing, PK ,ADA and Nab should be collected within 2 hour period prior to 
administration of study  drug.
5.3.2 Methods of sample collection
[IP_ADDRESS] Plasma sampling for pharmacokinetic anal ysis
For quantification of BI 655130 plasma concentrations, blood will be taken from a forearm 
vein into a K 2EDTA (ethylendiaminetetraacetic acid) anticoagulant blood -drawing tube at the 
time points listed in the Flow Chart under PK sampling.
Samples will be stored in a freezer set at the anal ytical laboratory until the finalization of the 
clinical trial report (CTR). T he plasma samples may  be used for further methodological 
investigations (e.g. for stability  testing ) however, only  data related to the analy te will be 
generated b y these additional investigations. The study  samples will be discarded after 
completion of the additional investigations but not later than 5 years upon the final study  
report has been signed.

For ADA assessment, blood will be taken from a forearm vein into a K 2EDTA anticoagulant 
blood -drawing tube at the time points listed in the Flow Chart . For Nab assessment, blood 
will be taken from a forearm vein into a serum blood drawing tube at the time points lis ted in 
the Flow Chart .
Samples will be stored in a freezer set at the anal ytical laboratory  until they  are anal yzed. The
Plasma /serum samples may  be used for further methodological investigations, e.g. for 
stability  testing, however only  data related to the anti -drug antibodies will be generated b y 
these additional investigations. The study  samples will be discarded after completion of the 
additional investigations but not later than 5 y ears after the final study  report has bee n signed.
5.3.4 Pharmacokinetic – pharmacodynamic relationship
No formal analy sis of pharmacokinetic/pharmacody namic relationships is planned.
If the data suggest a pharmacokinetic/pharmacod ynamic relationship of special parameters, 
e.g. an exploratory  analysis may  be performed.
Correlation between drug concentration and response may be made if adequate data are 
avail able. In addition, exploratory  correlations may  also be made between drug concentration 
and AEs. It isnot intended to include these data into the final report. However, the data may  
be part of the report if the available data allows for such correlation.
Data may  also be used to develop pharmacokinetic/pharmacody namic models using nonlinear 
mixed effect modeling techniques, if feasible. For this purpose data may also be combined 
with data from other trials. Modeling activities will be planned and document ed separatel y 
according to internal and external guidelines and Standard Operating Procesures (SOP).

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_225744]-03(15.0)/Saved on:30.Nov [ZIP_CODE]. STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF
SAMPLE SIZE
7.1 STATISTICAL DESIGN - MODEL
This is a n exploratory  trial in patients with atopic dermati tis. It is designed as a 2:1 
randomised, double- blind, placebo -controlled trial with 2 parallel groups (1 dose of BI
655130 and placebo (2:1) ).
The primary  objective of this trial is to explore the safety, tolerability and e fficacy  of BI 
655130 in comparison to placebo in patients with atopic dermati tis.
The primary  efficacy  endpoint for this trial is Percent c hange in Eczema Area and Severity  
Index (EASI) Score at Week 16 compared to Baseline .
Due to the potential for diff erent pathophy siology  in different ethnic groups, r andomisation 
will be stratified by [CONTACT_545] (Asian vs. Non -Asian patients ). The primary  endpoint will be 
analysedusing a r estricted maximum likelihood estimation based on a mixed- effect model for 
repeated mea sures analy sisto obtain adjusted means for the treatment effects. This model 
will include discrete fixed effects for treatment at each visit and stratification factor 
Asian/Non -Asian, and continuous fixed effects for baseline at each visit. The primary  
treatment comparisons will be the contrast between treatments at Week 16.
After Week [ADDRESS_225745] ingwill be performed having an alpha level of 10% (two-sided) , 
or α = 0.05 (one- sided):
H0:  Mean percent change of EASI score at W eek 16 (BI 655130 )
≤ Mean percent chang eEASI  score at W eek 16 (Placebo)
H1:  Mean percent change EASI score at wWeek 16 (BI 655130 )
>Mean percent chang eEASI  score at W eek 16 (Placebo)
As this is a nexploratory trial, the result of this hypothesis testing will be discussed in the 
context with all results, both safet y and efficacy.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_225746]-03(15.0)/Saved on:30.Nov [ZIP_CODE].3 PLANNED ANALYSES
The efficacy anal yses will be performed for the Full Ana lysis Set ( FAS), which is based on 
the intent -to-treat principle, and comprises all participants who were randomised, received at 
least one dose during the trial, and had a baseline measurement for the primary  endpoint. 
Efficacy  anal yses will be based on the planned treatment (i.e., the treatment assigned at 
randomisation). Safety analyses on patients who wer e randomised, and received at least one 
dose during the trial will be based on the actual treatment received at the randomisation visit; 
this set of patients is called the Safet y Analysis Set (SAF). All efficacy  analy ses will be 
conducted on the FAS. All s afety  anal yses will be conducted on the SAF. With regard to 
efficacy  and safet y endpoints, “baseline” refers to the measurement recorded at 
randomisation (Visit 2), if data at Visit [ADDRESS_225747] statistical parameters (number of non -missing values, mean, standard deviation 
(SD), median, quartiles, minimum ,and maximum) or frequency tables (including patient 
frequencies and percentages) will be calculated where appropriate.
7.3.1 Primary endpoint analyses
The primary  anal ysis is a restricted maximum likelihood (REML ) based approach using a 
mixed model with repeate d measurements (MMRM) comparing the percent change from 
baseline of the EASI score after 16weeks of treatment.
The anal ysis will include the fixed, categorical effects of treatment at each visit, stratification 
factor Asian/Non -Asian and the fixed contin uous effects of baseline at each visit. Visit swill 
be treated as the repeated measure with an unstructured covariance structure used to model 
the within -patient measurements.
The Kenward -Roger approximation will be used to estimate denominator degrees of freedom 
and adjust standard errors. Significance tests will be based on least -squares means using a 
two-sided α = 0. 10 (two -sided 90 % confidence intervals (CI)).The primary treatment 
comparison will be the contrast between treatments at Week 16 .
The pri mary  anal ysis will be performed on the FAS. Patients will be analysed according to 
the stratum to which they belong (regardless of any  miss-assignment to treatment based on 
identification of the wrong stratum), as such an error occurs before randomisation .
Procedures to follow if the anal ysis fails to converge will be described in the TSAP.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_225748]-03(15.0)/Saved on:30.Nov 2017To assess the homogeneity of the treatment effect on the primary  endpoint across the levels 
of Asian/Non -Asian, the same MMRM model will be fitted but replacing the tr eatment -by-
visit term by  a treatment -by-Asian/Non -Asian -by-visit term. A descriptive p -value of 
treatment effect homogeneity  at Week [ADDRESS_225749] will 
be estimated from this model, as it is not interpretable.
7.3.2 Secondary endpoint analyses
The endpoint change from baseline in SCORAD will be anal ysed using the same model as 
used for the primary  endpoint (MMRM).
For the primary  endpoint variable, the EASI  score, responder anal yses will be performed. A 
patient is defined as EASI50/75 responder when percent change from baseline of the EASI 
score is ≥50% or ≥75% , resulting in binary  variable with values of 1 (=response) or 0 (= non-
response). A logistic regression model will be used to predict the response rate s and to 
calculate the risk difference for BI 655130 versus placebo. As a sensitivity  anal yses, the
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test adjusted by  [CONTACT_35876] (Asian/Non -Asian) 
will be used.
For the proportion of patients with I GA [ADDRESS_225750] will be 
used.

Adverse events will be coded using the Medica l Dictionary  for Drug Regulatory  Activities
(MedDRA). Standard BI summary  tables and listings will be produced. All adverse events 
with an onset between start of treatment and end of the residual effect period (REP), a period 
of [ADDRESS_225752] drug in take and deteriorate under treatment will 
also be considered as ‘treatment- emergent’.
Frequency , severit y, and causal relationship of adverse events will be tabulated b y system 
organ class and preferred term after coding according to the current version o f the Medical 
Dictionary  for Drug Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA) at database lock .
Laboratory  data will be analy sedboth quantitatively  as well as qualitatively. The latter will 
be done via comparison of laboratory  data to their reference ranges. Values o utside the 
reference range as well as values defined as clinically  relevant will be summarised . Treatment 
groups will be compared descriptivel y with regard to distribution parameters as well as with 
regard to frequency  and percentage of patient s with abnormal values or clinically  relevant 
abnormal values.
Vital signs, ph ysical examinations, or other safet y-relevant data observed at screening, 
baseline, during the course of the trialand at the end -of-trialevaluation will be assessed with 
regard to possibl e changes compared to findings befo re start of treatment.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_225756]-03(15.0)/Saved on:30.Nov 2017With respect to safet y evaluations, it is not pl anned to impute missing values.
If a patient misses a visit, for continuous endpoints the missing data will not be imputed. The 
mixed effect model will handle missing data based on a likelihood met hod under the "missing 
at random” assumption.
For all binary  endpoints (i.e. endpoints that are either 1 (patient responded) or 0 (patient did 
not respond)), the following will be performed:
If there are data at visits both before and after the visit with a missing outcome, then 
impute as success onl y if both neighbouring visits also represent a success;
Otherwise, impute as a non-responder
Further sensitivity  anal yses to assess the robustness of the results may  be performed and as 
such will be described in the TSAP.

patients). If necessary , and depending upon g lobal distribution, entry  of patients into a 
stratum may  be capped.
The randomisation of patients to the treatment gro ups will be performed via I RT. BI will 
arrange for the randomisation as well as packaging and labelling of trial medication. The 
randomisa tion list will be generated using a validated sy stem, which involves a pseudo -

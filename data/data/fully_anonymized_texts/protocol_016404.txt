Background : Approximately 17,[ADDRESS_1240000] injury ( SCI) occur each year in the United 
States. With advances in acute medical care, longevity has increased in persons with SCI; 
however, morbidity due to cardiovascular disease ( CVD)  occurs at an earlier age compared to 
the general population.  Additionally, indi viduals with chronic SCI are at a heightened risk of 
CVD due to autonomic nervous system ( ANS ), physical inactivity and increased inflammatory 
processes. Arterial stiffness ( AS) is recognized as an independent risk factor for CVD, and pulse 
wave velocity ( PWV ) has proven to be a valid tool to predict and track structural arterial changes 
that reflect arteriosclerosis. In persons with SCI an increase in AS has been noted when 
compared to the uninjured population; however, possible contributors to this increa se are not yet 
fully understood.  
After a SCI, sympathetic control in the regions below the lesion level are severely 
disrupted; however, parasympathetic function is preserved. Due to the dissociation between the two systems, those with lesions above T6 ex perience low resting BP and further decreases in BP 
when changing postures (OH). D ecreased plasma norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (NE)  has been noted in 
individuals with cervical lesions when compared to individuals with thoracic injuries and controls . Additionally, lower levels of NE have been found to be associated with an increased 
incidence of OH in persons with SCI . As a consequence,  individuals with high -level injuries 
have a heightened reliance on RAAS to maintain and stabilize BP.  
A mechanism for increased AS in the uninjured population is over activation of the renin -
angiotensin- aldosterone system ( RAAS ). Angiotensin II ( ANG II ), a hormone produced through 
RAAS, modulates vascular stiffness by [CONTACT_886205], promotes collagen formation and increases oxidative st ress. Due to decentralized cardiovascular autonomic control, individuals 
with SCI have a heightened reliance on RAAS to maintain and stabilize blood pressure ( BP), 
especially during an orthostatic challenge. Participants: A total of 33 subjects, 22 individuals 
with SCI and 11 age -matched uninjured controls. Objectives: To study the hazardous effects of 
a highly activated RAAS on vasculature, the participant will be placed  on a tilt table in the 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_886182] ( 30º, 45 º and 60 º for 10 minutes at each angle of tilt). 
PWV will be measured during supi[INVESTIGATOR_886183] (active plasma renin) will be assessed at supi[INVESTIGATOR_20793] 60 degree tilt to determine if RAAS specific hormones contribute to increased AS in each cohort. The study aims are: 1) To investigate the influence of orthostatic 
change of BP and NE  responses to orthostasis; and 2) To determine if increased reliance on the 
RAAS for orthostatic BP regulation contributes to  differences in supi [INVESTIGATOR_886184].  
 
SPECIFIC AIMS:  
Aim 1:   To investigate the influence of orthostatic change in BP on plasma renin responses to 
HUT.   
Hypothesis 1A:  There will be an inverse relationship between the change in BP and change in 
plasma renin from supi[INVESTIGATOR_886185] 60°HUT in individuals with high- level SCI.     
  
Hypothesis 1B:  There will be no relationship between the change in BP and change in plasma 
renin from supi[INVESTIGATOR_886185] 60° HUT in persons with low -level SCI and uninjured                    
controls.

Version Date: 8.6.2020   3 
  
Aim 2 :  To investigate the influence of orthostatic change in BP and NE on the RAAS  
responses to HUT.   
 
Hypothesis 2 A: There will be a linear relationship between the change in orthostatic BP and 
change in plasma NE concentration  from supi[INVESTIGATOR_886185] 60°  HUT.    
  Hypothesis 2 B: Plasma renin activity will be inversely related to plasma NE concentrations 
during HUT in persons with SCI.  
 
Aim 3 : To determine if increased reliance on the RAAS for orthostatic BP regulation 
contributes to differences in supi[INVESTIGATOR_886186].  
 
Hypothesis 3 A: There will be significant group differences for change in plasma renin during 
HUT, in that plasma renin will be significantly increased during HUT in participants with high -
level SCI, but will remain unchanged i n individuals with low -level SCI and uninjured controls.  
 Hypothesis 3 B:  Change in plasma renin during the HUT maneuver will be directly associated 
with supi[INVESTIGATOR_886187]- level SCI.   
 Hypothesis 3 C: There will be no relationship between the change in plasma renin during the 
HUT maneuver and supi[INVESTIGATOR_886188] -level SCI and uninjured controls.  
  
REVIEW OF LITERATURE:  
 
After a SCI, descending sympathetic preganglionlic neurons are disrupted causing loss of 
supraspi[INVESTIGATOR_886189][1, 2] ,which results in numerous clinical issues. 
The level of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_886190] r egulation 
dysfunction after SCI. In individuals with injuries below T6, the sympathetic and 
parasympathetic control of the heart and splanchnic bed are intact, both of which are essential for 
short - and long - term BP regulation [2] . On the other hand, individuals with higher -level injuries, 
the parasympathetic control remains integral, while sympathetic autonomic control is lost (Krasioukov, 2009). This results in persistent hypotensi on and severe drops in BP when moving 
to the upright position (OH) [1, 3- 7]. 
OH has a higher prevalence in individuals with cervical compared to individuals with 
thoracic lesions, irrespective of whether their lesion was complete or incomplete [8, 9] .  
According to a Consensus statement from the American Au tonomic Society and American 
Academy of Neurology, OH is defined as a decrease in systolic BP (SBP) of 20+ mmHg and/or a fall in diastolic BP (DBP) of 10+ mmHg within 3 -minutes of moving from supi[INVESTIGATOR_886191], with or without symptoms [10] . Interestingly, decreas ed plasma NE has been noted in 
individuals with cervical lesions when compared to individuals with thoracic injuries and controls [11- 14]; and furthermore, there was no significant increase in NE level when individuals 
with tetraplegia underwent HUT [15, 16] .  Additionally, lower levels of NE have been found to 
be associated with an increased incidence of OH in persons with SCI [17] . Individuals with

14]and, as a result, are less prone to hypotension and OH [3, 18, 19] . 
Additionally, OH after SCI is thought to be largely related to inability to centrally 
regulate vascular tone [20] . The loss of the reflex vasoconstriction of the splanchnic bed and 
lower extremity vasculature results in venous blood pooling, which results in reduced blood volume in end- diastolic volume, leading to a decrease in cardiac output and left ventricular 
stroke volume [21] . In addition, due to paralysis of the lower extremities and physical inactivity, 
persons with SCI lose their ability to use skeletal muscle pump by [CONTACT_886206]. Individuals with paraplegia and uninjured controls demonstrated increased total peripheral resistance during a head -up tilt(HUT) compared to cervical injuries [22] . This suggests that the 
SNS was increased in controls and individuals with low -level injuries beca use they were able 
toincrease venous return in order to maintain BP.  
Although many individuals with SCI demonstrate OH, symptoms associated with OH 
decrease over time (light -headedness, blurred vision, fatigue, weakness, etc.) [19] . Evidence 
demonstrates that increased dependency on the RAAS is believed to play an integral part in reducing the severity of postural hypotension and the associated symptoms [12, 16, 19, 23, 24] . 
Renin was shown to increase in individuals with tetraplegia during HUT, an orthostatic challenge, at a much quicker and higher rise compared to individuals with thoracic injuries and uninjured controls [12, 23, 25] .  
The RAAS plays an essential role in maintaining long -term BP and is an enzymatic 
cascade in which renin is released into the blood and acts on angiotensinogen to form 
angio tensin I, which forms ANG II by [CONTACT_886207] (ACE) [26, 27] . 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_886192], recent evidenc e that 
chronic overproduction of this system may result in remodeling and restructuring of peripheral and coronary blood vessels by [CONTACT_886208], [28, 29] , 
accompanied by [CONTACT_886209], and production of inflammation, thrombosis and fibrosis [28] . Recent evidence has demonstrated that the use of ACE inhibitors or ANG II 
receptor blockers (ARBs) reduce vascular remodeling [30- 32], and diminish collagen production 
and increase the elastin to collagen ratio [31] . A meta -analysis demonstrated that the use of 
ARBs and ACE inhibitors decreased the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular mortality and total mo rtality in uninjured subjects [33], suggesting that the excessive ANG II 
production may lead to an increased risk of CVD.  
AS has been identi fied as an independent risk factor for CVD [31, 34, 35]  and PWV is 
considered to be the gold standard measurement because of it s high reliability and validity [36] . 
Increased AS has been documented in individuals with SCI compared to age -matched uninjured 
controls [2, 37- 41], even after matching for age, body composition and activity level [20] . It is 
well appreciated that the increase in AS is due to the natural aging process [42], however, we 
recently reported th at AS was not associated with age in the SCI population, suggesting 
premature cardiovascular dysfunction in persons with SCI [41] .  
Additionally, there is evidence supporting a direct linear association between AS and 
LOI, with AS increasing with ascending LOI [41] . In this same study, we reported that 
individuals with increased AS reported experiencing OH [41] , because OH may cause structural 
vascular adaptations secondary to persistence and epi[INVESTIGATOR_886193] [43] . Interestingly, our 
team recently demonstrated that there was significant inverse relationship between seated SBP and AS [41] ; and furthermore, Wecht et al. (2005) demonstrated that anti -hypotensive agents 
(Midodrine and L-NAME) reduced orthostatic dependency on the RAAS because plasma renin

effects on AS [24]. Groothuis et al. (2010) demonstrated that ANG II contributed to increased 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_886194] (T4- T12), but did not 
contribute to AS in controls [44]. Although increased AS has been reported in individuals with 
SCI, controversy abounds and additional evidence is needed to gain a better understanding of impact of morphologic and physiologic vascular adaptations that occur following SCI on orthostatic BP regulation a nd AS.  
 
 
 
SIGNIFICANCE OF RESEARCH:  
 
Evidence has shown that PWV is increased 2 -3 m/s in persons with SCI compared to 
able- bodied individuals [45, 46]  which corresponds a staggering 40 year acceleration of age -
related cardiovascular decline[47] . Evidence of causality suggests that decreases in AS, 
subsequent to administration of ARBs or ACE inhibitors, reduced vascular remodeling and 
decreased the risk of myocardioal infarction, stroke and cardiovascular mortalit y in the uninjured 
population [33] .  Additionally, the effects of OH on AS have not been studied in the SCI 
population, even though, persiste nt and epi[INVESTIGATOR_886195], including memory, processing speed and executive function in the uninjured population[48- 51]. Documenting the impact of the RAAS on AS in the SCI 
population, will provide a necessary step in initiating a change in clinical treatment of hypotension and OH, which may lead to improved regulation and preserva tion of cardiovascular 
health and longevity.

 • Acute illness or infection,  
• Current smokers within 1 year,  
• Documented history of controlled or uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes,  
• Any other neurological condition other than a SCI (multiple sclerosis, Pa rkinson’s 
disease),

stroke).  
 Procedure: 
All subjects will be asked to visit the Kessler Foundation (KF) laboratory for [ADDRESS_1240003]. Subjects will be asked to arrive between 8:[ADDRESS_1240004] and a good night sleep.  Subjects will remain seated for 5 -minute hemodynamic assessment. After, subjects 
will be transferred to the tilt table to lay supi[INVESTIGATOR_2525] 10 minutes prior to another 5- minute 
hemodynamic assessment. Arterial stiffness, ren in and NE will be collected in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_12251]. Subjects will then be progressively tilted to 30°, 45° and 60 ° for 10 minutes at each angle and 5 minutes of hemodynamic assessments will be measured at each angle. At 60 °, renin and NE will be collecte d.  
• Cardiovascular Assessments :  While the subject is seated [ADDRESS_1240005] and abdomen for continuous monitoring of HR and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487] (RR).  Brachial BP will be monitored at [ADDRESS_1240006] adult BP  cuff 
placed at the right upper arm, and beat -to-beat finger arteriolar BP will be continuously 
monitored from the right middle finger throughout testing.  MAP (mmHg) will be calculated from brachial BP using the formula: [systolic BP + (2 X diastolic BP)] /3.  
Beat-to-beat HR, RR and BP data will be viewed in real -time and stored for subsequent 
analysis using customized programs created with LabView graphical software.   
• Arterial Stiffness: aPWV (aortic pulse wave velocity)  will be measured using the 
Sphygm oCor CPV system (AtCor Medical Pty Ltd., West Ryde, NSW., Australia) at the 
carotid and femoral site s measured from the participant’s supra -sternal notch to each 
artery. The aPWV measurement will be taken in two steps: a tonometry reading of site A (caroti d artery) with an ECG signal simultaneously recorded captured after 10 seconds of 
good data, followed by a 10 second reading of site B (femoral artery) with an ECG signal . 
• Tilt table: will be used to perform an orthostatic provocation, which will be a progressive 
HUT from supi[INVESTIGATOR_886196] 30º, 45 º and 60 º for 10 minutes at each angle of tilt. Adjustment of the tilt table to each angle will be accomplished in less than 5 seconds, and subjects will be questioned at each angle of tilt regarding symptoms of syncope (i.e., blurry vision, dizziness, light -headedness, or nausea). The tilt table will be padded and 
motorized. Restraining straps will be used on the lower extremities and trunk to ensure subject safety during higher inclinations of HUT and to avoid lower -extremity muscle 
contractions in the control subjects. The straps will be wide and padded for subject comfort and to insure that stimulation of sympathetic spi[INVESTIGATOR_886197].  
• Hormonal Assessment: Blood will be drawn from a vein in the arm or hand twice each 
study visit to measure plasma renin level  and NE . One sample of each will be taken in the 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_886198] 60º. Alcohol will be used to sterilize the area. A rubber band will be placed around the arm proximal to the vein. A small needle will be inserted into the vein to

puncture site will be covered. Samples will be  immediately spun, down plasma separated 
and stored at - 80 º C for subsequent high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) 
analysis of renin and NE concentrations which will be performed at the Bronx VA research lab.

Statistical Analysis: To determine the relationship between change in BP and change in plasma rennin, we will use Pearson’s correlation coefficient or Spearman’s correlation coefficient with alpha. The independent variable is change in SBP from supi[INVESTIGATOR_886185] 60° HUT and the dependent variable is change in renin from supi[INVESTIGATOR_886185] 60° HUT. The alpha level will be set at 
0.05.

responses to HUT.   
Hypothesis 2A:
 There will be a linear relations hip between the change in orthostatic BP and 
change in plasma NE concentration from supi[INVESTIGATOR_886185] 60°  HUT.     
  Hypothesis 2B:
 Plasma renin activity will be inversely related to plasma NE concentrations 
during HUT in persons with SCI.  
 Statistical Analysis: To determine the relationship between change in BP and NE , we will use 
Pearson’s correlation coefficient or Spearman’s correlation coefficient with alpha. The independent variable is change in SBP from supi[INVESTIGATOR_886185] 60° HUT and the dependent variable is change in NE  from supi[INVESTIGATOR_886185] 60° HUT. The alpha level will be set at 0.05.  
  
Aim 3 : To determine if increased reliance on the RAAS for orthostatic BP regulation 
contributes to differences in supi[INVESTIGATOR_886186].

 Statistical Analysis: Differences in change in plasma renin during HUT between groups will be analyzed using univariate group by [CONTACT_134245], with the interaction effect being the statistical effect of interest. The alpha level will be set at 0.05. The G*Powe r calculations indicate that with 
a total sample size of 33, there will be a power = 0.8.[ADDRESS_1240009] size.  
 Hypothesis 3B:
  Change in plasma renin during the HUT maneuver will be directly associated 
with supi[INVESTIGATOR_886187]- level SCI.

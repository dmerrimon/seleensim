BMS -188667 Abatacept
SYNOPSIS
Clinical Protocol IM101332
Protocol Title : A Phase [ADDRESS_167463](s), Dose and Mode of Adm inistration, Duration of Treatment with Investigational 
Product(s):
Abatacept 125 mg weekly via SC injection
Placebo to match the abatacept w eekly via SC inje ction
Study Phase: Phase 3
Research Hypothesis:
Abatacept 125 mg when administered SC is more effective than placebo in achieving ACR20 response after 
24weeks (Day 169) of treatment in subjects with active Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA).
Objectives :
Primary :To compare the efficacy of abatacept to placebo as assessed by [CONTACT_8091]20 response at Day 169.
Key Secondary :
To compare the efficacy of abatacept to placebo as assessed by [CONTACT_146254] 
(HAQ) response at Day 169.
To compare the efficacy of abatacept to placebo in the subset of subjects who have never been exposed to 
Tumor Necrosis Factor α Inhibitor (TNFi) therapy, as assessed by [CONTACT_8091]20 response at Day 169.
To compare the efficacy of abatacept to placebo in the subset of subjects who have previously taken TNFi 
therapy, as assessed by [CONTACT_8091]20 response at Day 169.
To com pare the efficacy of abatacept to placebo as assessed by [CONTACT_146255] (Sharp/van der Heidje score) of x-rays from baseline to Day 169.
Study Design: This is a 24 week (168 days), Phase 3, random ized, double- blind, placebo controlled, multicenter 
study, followed by a 28 week (196 days) open -label period in subjects with active PsA based on the Classifi cation 
Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis (CASPAR). This study will include subjects who have had an inadequate response 
and/or intolerance to non-biologic DMARDs and may or may not been exposed to TNFi therapy . Subjects currently 
on biologic therapy cannot be enrolled. Approximately 400 subjects in total will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 
125mg SC weekly of abatacept and placebo (200 subjects per arm): approximately 248 subjects in the TNFi 
exposed subgroup and approximately 152 subjects in the TNFi naive subgroup. Randomization will be stratified 
globally by [CONTACT_146256], prior use of TNFi therapy and for psoriatic skin involvement 3% BSA. A maximum 
of approximately 40% of subjects with < 3% BSA psoriatic skin involvement will be randomized. On Day 113 
subjects who do not achieve a 20% improvement from baseline in their swollen and tender joint counts will be 
labeled as treatment failures and removed from their blinded treatment arm and transitioned to the early escape arm , 
open label weekly SC abat acept [ADDRESS_167464] the option of entering a one year 
study extension.

Study Assessments : 
Efficacy will be assessed using the ACR response rate, the HAQ response rate, the radiographic non-progressor rate 
of the PsA -modified Sharp/van der Heidje score (SHS), and the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) scores. 
Statistical Considerations:
Sample Size: A hierarchical testing procedure will be applied for the primary endpoint (proportion of ACR20 
responders at Day 169) and the 4 key secondary endpoints (proportion of HAQ responders, proportion of ACR20 
responders in 2 subgroups and proportion of non-progressors in total SHS at Day 169) to ensure the preservatio n of 
the overall type I error. The sam ple size determination is calculated in such a way that the pow er is at least 80% for 
Revised Protocol No.: 03
Date: 19-Aug-2014 8

Clinical Protocol IM101332
BMS -188667 Abatacept
each of the endpoints included in the hierarchical testing procedure and in addition, for the skin endpoint, PASI50.
All estimates used for the sample size determination are based on the results of phase II study IM101158 for PsA, 
except for non -progressors using total PsA -modified Sharp/van der Heijde score (SHS) (x -ray).A 2-sided continuity 
corrected Chi-square test at alpha=0.05 is used. Based on the power calculations, a sample size of 400 randomized 
subjects (200 per arm) is required: 248 subjects in the TNFi exposed subgroup and 152 subjects in the TNFi naive 
subgroup .
Endpoints:
Primary endpoint :Proportion of ACR2 0 responders at Day 169
Key secondary endpoin ts:
Proportion of HAQ responders (a reduction of at least 0.35 from baseline) at Day 169
Proportion of ACR20 responders at Day 169 in the TNFi naive subpopulation
Proportion of ACR20 responders at Day 169 in t he TNFi exposed subpopulation
Proportion of non-progressors in total PsA-modified SHS (defined as a change from baseline intotal 
PsA-modified SHS 0) at Day 169
Other secondary endpoint :
Proportion of subjects achieving a PASI50 (achieving at least 50% improvement from baseline in PASI) at 
Day 169 in subjects with baseline BSA 3% 
Proportion of ACR50 and ACR70 responders at Day 169
Mean change from baseline in physical (PCS) and mental functions (MCS) of SF -36 at Day 169
Proportions of subjects with po sitive immunogenicity response up to Day 169
Safety (proportion of subjects with adverse events, deaths, SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation and 
proportion of subjects with marked laboratory abnormalities) up to Day 169
Analyses: 
Efficacy Analysis :
All efficacy analyses will be for the intent -to-treat (ITT) analysis population. In general, no form al statistical testing 
will take place except for the primary, the key secondary efficacy endpoints and the proportion of subjects achieving 
PASI50 at Day 169. If the 2-sided test for the prim ary endpoint (proportion of ACR20 responders at Day 169) is 
statistically significant at alpha=5%, then a hierarchical approach for statistical testing will be used for the secondary 
endpoints. This procedure allow s forpreserving of the overall Type I error rate of 0.05 for the study. Hierarchical 
ordering of the secondary endpoints is as follows:
Proportion of HAQ responders at Day 169 
Proportion of ACR20 responders at Day 169 in the TNFi naive subpopulation 
Proporti on of ACR20 responders at Day 169 in the TNFi exposed subpopulation 
Proportion of non-progressors in total PsA-modified SHS (defined as a change from baseline in total 
PsA-modified SHS 0) at Day [ADDRESS_167468] to be non-statistically 
significant. A clear distinction will be made between p-values whereby [CONTACT_146258]. All 
proportions mentioned above will be tested with a 2-sided Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) Chi-square test, 
stratified by [CONTACT_146259] (Yes, No), MTX use (Yes, No) and BSA (< 3%, 3%) at a 5% significance level.

Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) is define d as any female who has experienced 
menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy  or bilateral 
oophorectom y) and is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined as 12months of amenorrhea in 
a woman over age [ADDRESS_167481] a serum follicle stimulating hormone 
(FSH) level > 40 mIU/ml to confirm menopause.
Revised Protocol No.: 03
Date: 19-Aug-2014 33

Clinical Protocol IM101332
BMS -188667 Abatacept
Women treated with hormone replacement therapy , (HRT) are likely  to have artificiall y 
suppressed FSH levels and may require a washout period in order to obtain a physiologic FSH 
level. The duration of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used: The duration of 
the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the investigators should use their 
judgment in checking serum FSH levels. If the serum FSH level is > 40 mIU/ml at any time 
during the washout period, the woman can be considered postmenopausal.
1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products, (rings, creams, g els)
4 week minimum for transdermal products
8 week minimum for oral products
Other parenteral products may  require washout periods as long as 6 months.

double -blind period and fulfilling the necessary  criteria may enter the 28 -week open -label period 
during which all subjects receive abatacept 125 mg/ml subcutaneous injection. 
Randomization schedules will be generated and kept by [CONTACT_146266] -Myers Squibb. Each subject who is qualified for treatment will 
be assigned a unique randomization number. Randomization numbers will be assigned using a 
Central Randomization System in the order in which subjects qualify  for treatment, not in the

right side of the bod y.
On “Office Visit” days, SC injections should occur AFTER all assessments, including blood 
draws for assessment of immunogenicit y and drug conce ntrations. To ensure compliance and to 
monitor technique “office visit” SC injections should be conducted in the presence of a qualified 
investigational staff. 
4.3.1 Dose Modifications
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Modifications in the Absence of Adverse Events.
All Study  Medications (Abatacept SC and matching placebo ): Every  effort should be made to 
give all medications within 3daysof the target date in the double -blind and open label 
treatment periods. The last dose before each office visit should be administered at least [ADDRESS_167491] then be administered on the next scheduled 
target administration day.
In the long term extension period, the office visits may be modified to be 7 days of the target 
dosing administration day  for a significant reason (including an adverse event).
During the double -blind period , any subject who misses greater than four consecutive doses
should be discontinued from t he study .
During the open -label period , any subject who misses greater than sixconsecutive doses should 
be discontinued from the study .
[IP_ADDRESS] Dose Modifications Due to Adverse Events
If abnormal laboratory  test results or clinical adverse events indicate toxici ty that, in the 
judgment of the investigator, could place the subject at risk, study  drug administration should be 
interrupted and the investigator should notify  the BMS medical monitor. Subjects may receive 
further study  medication treatment only if full resolution of the adverse event or abnormal 
laboratory  finding is documented.
If a dose is skipped, the next SC injection should be administered on the subsequent targeted 
administration day .
4.4 Blinding/Unblinding
Blinding of treatment assignment is critical to the integrit y of this clinical study . However, in the 
event of a medical emergency  or pregnancy  in an individual subject in which knowledge of the 
Revised Protocol No.: 03
Date: 19-Aug-[ADDRESS_167492]'s management, the blind for that subject may be 
broken by [CONTACT_093]. The subject’s safety  takes priority  over any other considerations in 
determining if a treatment assignment should be unblinded.
Before breaking the blind of an individual subject's treatment, the investigator should determine 
that theunblinded information is necessary , ie, that it will alter the subject's immediate 
management. In many cases, particularl y when the emergency  is clearly  not related to the 
investigational product, the problem may be properly  managed by [CONTACT_82745]. It is highly  desirable that the decision to unblind treatment assignment 
be discussed with the Medical Monitor, but the investigator alway s has ultimate authority  for the 
decision to unblind. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_109377].
For this study , the method of unblinding for emergency  purposes is the IVRS. For information 
on how to unblind in an emergency , consult the IVRS materi al.
In cases of accidental unblinding, contact [CONTACT_122382].
Any request to unblind a subject for non-emergency  purposes should be discussed with the 
Medical Monitor.
The BMS Bioanaly tical Science Department or its designee will be unblinded to the randomized 
treatment assignments in order to minimize unnecessary  analysis of PK and immunogenicity 
samples from the placebo group of subjects. Other members will remain blinded.
4.5 Treatment Compliance
Monthly  study drug administration compliance will be performed at the investigational site 
office b y reviewing the diary cards.
4.6 Destruction and Return of Study Drug
4.6.1 Destruction of Study Drug
For this study , study  drugs (those supplied by [CONTACT_52240]) such as 
partially  used study  drug containers, vials and s yringes may be destroy ed on site. 
Any unused study  drugs can only be destro yed after being inspected and reconciled by [CONTACT_52241] y, or to meet local regulations (eg, cytotoxics or biologics). 
On-site destruction is allowed provided the following minimal standards are met:
On-site disposal practices must not expose humans to risks from the drug.
On-site disposal practices and procedures are in agreement with applicable laws and 
regulations, including any  special requirements for controlled or hazardous substances.
Written procedures for on-site disposal are available and followed. The procedures must be

qualify for the Early Escape], and Day 365 (Open Label 197) (14days).Subjects who 
terminate the study  early in the double -blind period or open label period will have radiographs 
taken at the Early  Termination visit.
Radiographs of the hands and feet may be taken after dosing on Day 1  as long as they are 
performed on Day  1.
Radiograph y of the hands and feet will be standardized to ensure sufficient image qualit y for the 
evaluation of radiographic progression. Radiolog y facilities and personnel will be qualified for 
participation in the study based on the technical capabilities of the equipment and experience and 
the licensing of the x-ray technologists. Radiographic technique will be harmonized through the 
use of writt en radiographic procedure manual and training of x-ray technologists. In addition the 
film-screen system will be standardized to ensure sufficient resolution for the evaluation of 
erosi ons and joint space narrowing.
Radiographs collected for the study will be sent to a central reading facility  for quality  control 
and central evaluation (in a blinded manner) by a  radiologist trained and experienced in the 
scoring of PsA by [CONTACT_146268] -van der Heijde Modified Scoring Method (SHS) for psoriatic

5.3.2 Physical Examination
Complete and/or targeted (brief) physical examinations may be performed by a Doctor of 
Medi cine (MD), Doctor of Osteopathy  (DO), Physician’s Assistant (PA), or Nurse Practitioner 
(NP). 
While the brief interim physical exam may not be as comprehensive as the initial full 
examination, key aspects of the brief interim examination should evaluate important body 
systems as clinicall y indicated. The brief ph ysical examination should include examination of the 
heart, lungs and abdomen, and may include other relevant body  systems such as the lymph 
nodes, liver, spleen and breasts, at the discretion of the examiner. A brief interim physical 
examination may note any changes in the subject’s condition (body systems) since the last 
assessment and does not preclude examination of any  of the body  systems as clinically  indicated.

5.3.5 Vital Signs
Vital signs (seated blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature) will be recorded during the 
screening visit, during every  visit, and at study  discharge or as soon as possi ble after the last dose 
for subjects who terminate early, and at the post study  drug follow -up visits. Blood pressure and 
heart rate should be measured after the subject has been seated quietly  for at least [ADDRESS_167501]’s 
eligibility . In addition to a chest x-ray that does not show any cardiac or pulmonary  disease and 
no suspi[INVESTIGATOR_122346], a tuberculin skin test will be performed and interpreted according to 
local country  Health Authorities and/or Medical Society  guidelines. Some guidelines have 
specific recommendations for subjects who are to receive biologics or immunosuppressant 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (eg, RA experience with biologic agents),43,44,45or who are immunocompromised and 
who have had prior BCG vaccination(s).46,47Tuberculin skin testing is not contraindicated for 
persons who have been vaccinated with BCG. An interferon gamma release assay  (e.g., 
QuantiFERON Gold or Tspot/ELISpot) is an acceptable alternative when skin testing for 
tuberculosis (i.e., [COMPANY_003]) is not appropriate.

finding), symptom, or disease temporall y associated with the use of investigational product, 
whether or not considered related to the investigational product.
The causal relationship to study  drug is determined by a physician and should be used to assess 
all adverse events (AE). The casual relationship can be one of the following:
Related: There is a reasonable causal relationship between study  drug administration and the 
AE.
Not related: There is not a reasonable causal relationship between study  drug administration 
and the AE.
The term “reasonable causal relationship ”means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship. 
Adverse events can be spontaneously  report ed or elicited during open -ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)
6.1 Serious A dverse Events
A Serious Adverse Ev ent (SAE) is any  untoward medical occurrence that at an y dose: 
results in death
is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically  might have caused death if it 
were more severe)
requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312] 
(seeNOTE below)
results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity
is a congenital anomal y/birth defect 
is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediatel y 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [eg, medical, 
surgi cal] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above.) 
Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].) Potential drug induced liver injury  (DILI) is also considered an 
important medical event. (See Section 6.6 for the definition of potential DILI.)
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the study  
drug is an SAE.
Although pregnancy , overdose, cancer, and potential drug induced liver injury  (DILI) are not 
alway s serious by [CONTACT_52252], these events must be handled as SAEs.
(See Section 6.1.1 for reporting pregnancies).

Clinical Protocol IM101332
BMS -188667 Abatacept
Any component of a study  endpoint that is conside red related to study  therap y (eg,death is an 
endpoint, if death occurred due to anaphy laxis, anaphy laxis must be reported) should be reported 
as SAE (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details.
NOTE : 
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_102412]: 
a visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20347] < 24 hours, that does not 
result in admission (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event)
elective surgery , planned prior to signing consent
admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure
routine health assessme nt requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status 
(eg,routine colonoscop y)
medical/surgical admission other than to remedy  ill health and planned prior to entry  into 
the study . Appropriate documentation is required in these cases
admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health 
status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg,lack of housing, economic 
inadequacy , caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family  circumstances, administrative reason).
6.1.[ADDRESS_167504]’s written consent to participate in the study , all SAEs, whether related or 
not related to study  drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associated with 
protocol -specified procedures. All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening period 
and within [ADDRESS_167505] be collected that 
relate to an y later protocol -specified procedure (eg, a follow -up skin biopsy ). 
The investigator should report any SAE that occurs after these time periods and that is believed 
to be related to stud y drug or protocol -specified procedure. 
An SAE report should be completed for an y event where doubt exists regarding its seriousness. 
If the investigator believe s that an SAE is not related to study  drug, but is potentially  related to 
the conditions of the study  (such as withdrawal of previous therapy  or a complication of a study  
procedure ), the relationship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form.
SAEs, whether related or not related to study  drug, and pregnancies must be reported to BMS 
(ordesignee) within [ADDRESS_167506] be recorded on the SAE Report Form; pregnancies on 
a Pregnancy  Surveillance Form (electronic or paper forms). When using paper forms, the reports 
are to be transmitted via email or confirmed facsimile (fax) transmission to:
For studies capturing SAEs/pregnancies through electronic data capture (EDC), electronic 
submission is the required method for reporting. The paper forms should be used and submitted

BMS -188667 Abatacept
immediately , only  in the event the electronic system is unavailable for transmission. When paper 
forms are used, t he original paper forms are to remain on site.
 
If only  limited information is initially  available, follow -up reports are required. (Note: Follow -up 
SAE reports should include the same investigator term(s) initially  reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity  or relationship to study  drug or if new information 
becomes available, a follow -up SAE report should be sent within 24 hours to the BMS 
(ordesignee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report.
All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization.
6.2 Nonserious A dverse Events
Anonserious adverse event is an AE not classified as serious.
6.2.1 Nonserious Adverse Event Collec tion and Reporting
The collection of nonserious AE information should begin at initiation of study  drug. Nonserious 
AE information should also be collected from the start of a placebo lead-in period or other 
observational period intended to establish a bas eline status for the subjects.
Nonserious AEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization, or reported as SAEs if they 
become serious (see Section 6.1.1) Follow -up is also required for nonserious AEs that cause 
interruption or discontinuation of study  drug andfor those present at the end of study  treatment 
as appropriate. All identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on the nonserious 
AE page of the CRF (paper or electronic). 
Completion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory  abnormalities 
that are reported/identified during the course of the study.
6.2.[ADDRESS_167507] result abnormalities should be captured on the nonserious AE CRF 
page or SAE Report Form (paper or electronic) as appropriate:
Any laboratory  test result that is clinically  significant or meets the definition of an SA E 
Any laboratory  test result abnormality  that required the subject to have study  drug 
discontinued or interrupted
Revised Protocol No.: 03

6.6 Potential Drug In duced Liver Injur y (DILI)
Specific criteria for identify ing potential DILI have not been identified for this protocol. 
Standard medical practice in identify ing and monitoring hepatic issues should be followed.
6.7 Other Safety  Considerations
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinations, 
electrocardiogram, x-ray filming, any other potential safet y assessment required or not required

All efficacy  analyses will be for the intent -to-treat (ITT) analy sis population, except if stated 
otherwise. In general, no formal statistical testing will take place except for the primary , the key 
secondary  efficacy  endpoints (including the ACR20 responders in the twoTNFi subgroups) and 
the proportion of subjects achieving PASI 50 at Day 169.
[IP_ADDRESS] ACR20
Primary  anal ysis at Day 169
The primary  efficacy  analysis regarding the comparison between abatacept and placebo in the 
proportion of ACR20 responders at Day 169 will be performed with a 2-sided 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) Chi-square test, stratified by [CONTACT_146259] (Yes, No), MTX 
use (Yes, No) and BSA (< 3%, 3%) at a 5% significa nce level. The Chi square p -value and the 
relative risk along with its 95% confidence interval will be provided at Day 169. In addition, the 
absolute treatment difference will be provided along with its 95% two-sided confidence interval 
based on the stratu m-specific sample size weighting method 73at all timepoints up to Day  169. 
All subjects who prematurely  discontinue the study after receiving study  medication will have 
missing data imputed as ACR20 non-responder at all scheduled protocol visits subsequen t to the 
point of discontinuation. Rescue medication and early escape after Day 113 as described in 
sections 3.1.2 and 3.1.3 will be allowed. After receiving this rescue medication, the as-observed 
ACR20 response will be used in the ACR20 analysis up to Day 169; however, forsubjects 
switching to open label abatacept in the early  escape period, the subjects will be imputed as 
non-responders for the ACR20 responder analyses up to Day 169.The primary  analysis will be 
done for the intent -to-treat (ITT) anal ysis population.
Sensitivity  Analysis at Day 169
The following sensitivity analy ses for the primary analy sis of ACR20 response at Day 169will 
be performed:
analysis apply ingthe per -protocol anal ysis population.
To investigate if imbalances in demograph y characteristics and/or baseline characteristics do 
not have an impact on the primary  result, a logistic regression including treatment, prior 
TNFi use, MTX use, BSA, demogra phic variables (age, gender, and weight) and baseline 
variables (duration of disease, tender joints, swollen joint, HAQ DI, pain, subject global 
assessment of disease activity , physician global assessment of disease activity , CRP and 
current oral corticost eroid use) will be performed.

abstinent shall be exempt from following the pregnancy  prevention requirements specified 
below.
DURATION OF MANDATORY CONTRAC EPTION:
For Abatacept:   
Females:  WOCBP must use a highl y effective method of contraception throughout the study  and 
for [ADDRESS_167520] dose of study  drug.
Males:  Because the concentration of abatacept in the semen is expected to be low, no 
contraception is required for males subjects taking the study  drug.
For Teratogenic Concomitant Medications:
Males and females taking a teratogenic medication should follow contraception guidelines and 
duration described in the label for the concomitant medica tions in addition to those required for 
abatacept.
CONTRACEPTIVE METHODS:
A.Highl y Effective Methods of Contraception
Highl y effective methods of contraception have a failure rate of < 1% when used consistently  
and correctl y.  WO CBP are expected to use one o f the highl y effective methods of contraception 
listed below:
1.Male condoms with spermicide
2.Hormonal methods of contraception including combined oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], vaginal 
ring, injectables, implants and intrauterine devices (IUDs) such as Mirena
3. IUDs, such as ParaGard
4.Tubal ligation 
5.Vasectom y
For abatacept, WOCBP must use a highl y effective method of contraception.
For teratogenic concomitant medications:  Males and females taking a teratogenic medication 
should follow contraception guidelines and duration described in the label for the concomitant 
medications in addition to those required for abatacept.
B.Abstinence
Abstinence is an acceptable form of contraception for all study  drugs.
Subjects who choose abstinence must continue to have pregnancy tests, as specified in

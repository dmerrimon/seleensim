 1) Summary  
Abdominal pain is one of the most common reasons for children and adolescents to seek care in the 
emergency department (ED). Computed tomography (CT) has been promoted as a method to improve 
diagnostic accuracy when evaluating patients with acute abdominal pain. In the past [ADDRESS_442723] common surgical emergency in c hildren, its diagnosis remains a 
challenge and thus, emergency department (ED) providers increasingly rely on computed tomography to distinguish appendicitis from other conditions. This project (a) uses electronic health record (EHR) 
technology to deliver patient -specific clinical decision support to ED providers at the point of care, (b) 
assesses the impact of this intervention on the use of diagnostic imaging and clinical outcomes, and (c) 
assesses the impact of the intervention on the costs of care deliv ered.  
Appy CDS is an automated, evidence -based tool designed to provide point -of-care clinical decision support 
(CDS) to providers for pediatric patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute 
abdominal pain.  Appy CDS uses Epic and web -based algorithms t o provide recommendations , consistent 
with standard of care and informed by a personalized appendicitis risk calculation.  The Appy CDS will be 
implemented and evaluated within two large health systems, HealthPartners (HP) and Kaiser Perman ente 
Northern [LOCATION_004] (KPNC) .  The overall approach and algorithms driving the appendictis risk calculation 
within Appy CDS will be the same at the KPNC and HP sites.  However, the actual implementation and 
appearance of the CDS may vary, based on local differences between the two health systems in: workflow, 
current EHR structure, and preferences of clinical leaders.  
If successful, this flexible decision support tool could be adapted and implemented broadly in a range of 
acute care settings to both stan dardize and personalize care delivered to pediatric patients.

 2) Introduction  
 
a) Background  
Acute abdominal pain is the chief complaint for 5% -10% of all emergency department (ED) visits among 
children.1-4 Up to 10% of these patients have appendicitis, the most common surgical emergency in this 
age group.2 Due to overlap in presentation between appendicitis and nonsurgical conditions, identifying 
the etiology of acute abdominal pain can be difficult. Thus, ED providers increasingly use computed 
tomography (CT) to diagnose appendicitis.5,[ADDRESS_442724] use among children with abdominal pain increased from 0.9% to 15.4%.[ADDRESS_442725] been to identify: 1) patients at high risk for 
appendicitis who do not require imaging before surgery; and 2) patients at low risk for appendicitis,  for 
whom the risks of CT may outweigh the benefits.24 In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we demonstrated that providing ED 
clinicians a child’s estimated risk for appendicitis based on their current symptoms can reduce CT use.[ADDRESS_442726] (EHR) -
linked, web-based clinical decision support (CDS) system that integrates data from multiple sources and 
presents point -of-care CDS in order to augment clinician judgment and prioritize care delivery. Such a CDS 
system is likely to be an efficient and scalable method for translating eviden ce into practice across 
multiple general EDs, the primary sites where children with acute abdominal pain receive emergent care.  
 
Community -based EDs in two regions will develop, implement, and prospectively evaluate a w eb-based 
CDS tool ( Appy -CDS) for chil dren with acute abdominal pain. Appy -CDS will identify pediatric patients with 
acute abdominal pain at increased risk for appendicitis, notify providers of a patient’s estimated risk for 
appendicitis, and provide specific evidence -based recommendations. To  measure the impact of Appy -CDS, 
we will conduct a cluster-  randomized trial across 1 7 participating EDs in two large health systems with a 
combined total of more than 90,000 pediatric visits per year.  
 
Specific Aim 1 : To design and implement a triage -base d trigger, as part of Appy -CDS, to identify pediatric 
patients with acute abdominal pain at increased risk for appendicitis.  
 
• Hypothesis 1: Among pediatric patients with abdominal pain, a triage -based trigger will identify 
those at risk for appendicitis with a negative predictive value ≥99% and positive predictive value ≥20%.  
 
Specific Aim 2 : To evaluate the impact of the full Appy -CDS intervention on appropriate use of diagnostic 
imaging (CT and ultrasound) for pediatric patients with acute abdominal pain at risk for appendicitis.  
 
• Hypothesis 2. Among eligible pediatric patients at risk for appendicitis, those treated at 
intervention EDs compared to those treated at control EDs will be less likely to undergo a CT 
examination.  
 
7 Appy -CDS Manual of Operations  
Version 19 –Updated February 6, 2018 ; Originated January 2016.  
  
 
 • Hypothesis 3. Among eligible p ediatric patients at risk for appendicitis, those treated at 
intervention EDs compared to those treated at control EDs will be less likely to undergo diagnostic 
imaging with CT or ultrasound.  
 
Specific Aim 3:  To evaluate the impact of the full Appy -CDS intervention on health care costs.  
 
• Hypothesis 4. Among pediatric patients at risk for appendicitis, those treated at intervention EDs compared to those treated at control EDs will have significantly lower resource use in a defined [ADDRESS_442727] 
builds on extensive previous wor k by [CONTACT_355411], including derivation and validation of 
pediatric ED clinical decision rules, CDS development and implementation, and economic and statistical analyses of ED resource use. The proposed point -of-care CDS tool will be a scalab le model for using EHR -
linked, web-based technology to safely deliver personalized and evidence -based care for children in the 
ED. 
 
b) Rationale  
Abdominal pain is one of the most common reasons for children and adolescents to seek care in the ED.1 
About 5% -10% of all pediatric ED visits are for abdominal pain, and appendicitis is ultimately diagnosed in 
up to 10% of these children.2,3,[ADDRESS_442728] common surgical emergency in pediatrics. The 
lifetime risk of appendicitis is 8.6% for males and 6.7% for females.27 When evaluating pediatric patients 
with acute abdominal pain, ED physicians often consider surgical conditions, such as ovarian torsion or 
cholecystitis, in addition to appendicitis; however, these conditions are uncommon in children.28,29 In a 
recent multicenter study of more than 2,500  pediatric  patients  (3-18 years old) presenting to an ED with 
<96 hours of abdominal pain, 39% had appendicitis, while only 1.1% of patients ha d a surgical condition 
other than appendicitis.21  
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_355342], diagnosing appendicitis remains challenging. The clinical presentation of non -
surgical conditions causing acute abdominal pain (e .g., mesenteric adenitis, acute gastroenteritis) often 
mim ics that of appendicitis. In addition, children may have difficulty communicating their complaints.30 Up 
to 40% of children with appendicitis are misdiagnosed on initial presentation,30-32 leading to delay s in 
treatment and increased morbidity and mortality.33 There is also considerable variability in the ED 
evaluation of children with suspected appendicitis.5,19,34,35 A recent survey of 40 US children’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_355343], among children with appendicitis, CT use ranged from 21% -49%, and ultrasound rates 
ranged from 2% -26%.[ADDRESS_442729] for patients with equivocal 
8 Appy -CDS Manual of Operations  
Version 19 –Updated February 6, 2018 ; Originated January 2016.  
  
 
 presentations have not been generalizable to larger cohorts of children with acute abdominal pain.  
 
Overuse of CT is problematic given the risks of radiation exposure and increased costs of care. As a res ult 
of their smaller size and increased organ sensitivity, pediatric patients are especially vulnerable to 
radiation -induced injuries.12,14,43,[ADDRESS_442730] has a 
demonstrated sensitivity of 94% (95% CI 92% -97%) and specificity of 95% (95% CI 94% -97%) for identifying 
appendicitis in children, its positive predictive value decreases substantially when used in children with low likelihood of appendicitis.
[ADDRESS_442731] emergent care for children is provided in general EDs.8 Only 7% of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_355344].50 Recent data from the 
National Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_355345]’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_355346].4,7,51 Plausible 
explanations for this difference include 1) general ED providers may have less confidence than pediatric ED providers in eliciting and interpreting physical exam findings in children and 2) general ED providers may be more familiar with adult gu idelines that advocate CT to diagnose appendicitis.
[ADDRESS_442732] stratified patients based on their white blood cell count (WBC) and then applied a selective imaging pro tocol, with ultrasound as the first -line 
imaging.
59 Similarly, utilizing data from 10 pediatric EDs, our group has derived and validated a decision 
rule to identify patients at low risk of appendicitis using recursive partitioning. We found that the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was the first node, or the most powerful tool, for identifying pediatric patients with acute abdominal pain who could forgo diagnostic imaging.
20,21 Additional key predictors were: focal 
right - sided pain, pain with walking, emesis, and duration of pain.[ADDRESS_442733] been single -site efforts performed 
in academic medi cal centers.
61-65 A systematic review of research studies conducted through 2004 
9 Appy -CDS Manual of Operations  
Version 19 –Updated February 6, 2018 ; Originated January 2016.  
  
 
 included 100 random ized and nonrandomized trials with concurrent controls, compa red computer -based 
CDS with routine care. The authors noted that computer -based CDS improved clinician performance in 
64% of the studies. Two of four ED -based trials showed that CDS led to improv ements in diagnosis. In all 
clinical settings, improvement was noted more often with automatic delivery of CDS versus when users 
had to activate the CDS.63 These results mirror our previous work demonstrating that CD S in outpatient 
clinics improves clinician adherence to diabetes guidelines and glucose and blood pressure control in 
diabetic patients.66-68 In our previous work, we found that ED physicians are receptive to CDS based on 
validated prediction rules and are open to multiple means of incorporating CDS into the EHR.69 
 Implementing CDS via the EHR in multiple EDs presents unique challenges. EDs provide care to a high 
volume of acutely ill patients requiring rapid management decisions despi[INVESTIGATOR_355347]. The proposed CDS will gather information from multiple sources at multiple times during the patient encounter, integrate these data using previously validated clinical decision rules, and provide evidence - based patient -specific clinical care recommendations in real ti me. Furthermore, ED clinicians 
work in dynamic and complex systems; each ED has evolved a particular method of decision -making or 
clinical workflow. For CDS to be successful, it is necessary to assess and account for local ED processes and 
clinician percep tions.
[ADDRESS_442734] use in children with acute abdominal pain.
73 In their 2007 article 
on US EDs, Gausche -Hill et al wrote, “Key opportunities for improving pediatric emergency care lie in non - 
children’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], where the vast majority of care occurs”.8 The Appy -CDS intervention integrates 
clinical information to optimize management of children with acute abdominal pain in general EDs. 
Moreover, our te chnical approach is a useful template to generalize ED point -of-care CDS to a range of 
clinical conditions.  
c) Innovation  
The potential for computerized CDS to improve practitioner performance and adherence to guidelines is widely recognized. However, the impact of EHR -linked CDS on patient outcomes has been variable.
63,74,75 
Review of previous  negative studies identifies 3 principal reasons for failure: (a) Clinicians have not 
accessed the CDS information in a timely fashion, (b) the CDS has been limited to simple prompts or reminders, and (c) the CDS has not provided personalized information.
76,[ADDRESS_442735] primarily been developed and implemented in academic 
children’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].21,78,[ADDRESS_442736] pediatric ED visits and radiation exposures are in general EDs9, 
there is an urgent need to study the effectiveness of pediatric -specific CDS in these settings.6 We propose 
10 Appy -CDS Manual of Operations  
Version 19 –Updated February 6, 2018 ; Originated January 2016.  
  
 
 to work closely with site- based leadership to develop and implement the Appy -CDS system in [ADDRESS_442737] of CDS resources to improve quality of care for pediatric patients with acute abdominal pain. 
For instance, although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is currently not a standard diagnostic tool for 
pediatric patients with acute abdominal pain, our protocols could be modified to address use of this 
imaging modality in the future.  
 Innovation in Assigning Patients a Personalized Risk of Appendicitis: This project builds on previous successful efforts by [CONTACT_355412][INVESTIGATOR_007]
[ADDRESS_442738] may be more appropriate than ultrasound. By [CONTACT_355413], evidence -based recommendations, Appy -CDS will offe r guidance tailored to each patient.  
d) Preliminary Studies  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_123704]: We recently  complet ed a single -center  pi[INVESTIGATOR_355348].  For this project,  based in the 2 primary  EDs of 
Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_355349]  (Children’s  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]),  we engaged a multidiscip linary  team  
of radiologis ts, surgeons,  and ED physicians  to develop  a consensus  care  pathway.  Similar to the current  
proposal,  goals  of the  pi[INVESTIGATOR_355350].  The pi[INVESTIGATOR_355351] [ADDRESS_442739] by [CONTACT_355414].20,21 Patie nts with  an 
ANC  <6.75 × 103/µL, absence  of nausea,  and absence  of max imal tenderness  in the right  lower quadrant  
were  identified  as at low risk for appendicitis .21 Second,  to determine  which  patie nts were  at high  risk for 
appendicitis  and could  proceed to the operating  room without  imaging,  we used  the exter nally  validated  
Pediatric  Appendicitis  Score  (PAS).22,84 The remaining  patients  were  classified  as medium  risk, and 
ultrasound  was the recomm ended  initial imaging modality.  We then  worked  with  our informatics  group  
to create a simple  “time -of-ordering  alert”:  the pi[INVESTIGATOR_355352]  a 
CT or ultrasound  for patients  with  acute  abdominal  pain.  The CDS  tool was modified  and refined  in two 
phases.  Drs. Schmeling and Mize,  members  of the Clinical Advisory Council for the current  proposal,  were 
instrumental  to the success  of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268].   
11 Appy -CDS Manual of Operations  
Version 19 –Updated February 6, 2018 ; Originated January 2016.  
  
 
 Over  the 36-month  study  period,  4,234 pediatric  and adolesce nt patients  with acute  abdominal pain  
received  care in the  pi[INVESTIGATOR_355353].  Of these,  778 (18%)  had appendicitis  and 178 (23%  of appendicitis  cases)  had 
a perforated appendix.  After  CDS was implemented,  942 (22%)  had an abdominal  CT, and 
1,666  (39%)  had an ultrasound . Interrupted  time series  design  revealed a  significant  23%  decline  in CT use 
post -implementation (OR=0.77 (95%CI.67- .88) P<0.01) (Figure 1). Safety outcomes remained unchanged 
over the study period.[ADDRESS_442740] use, total  imagi ng (CT or ultrasound)  did not decrease.  In additi on, after a marked  early  post -
implementation  decrease  in CT, further  reductions  were limited  despi[INVESTIGATOR_355354].  
Review of the intervention revealed  3 key themes  we will address  in the current  proposal:  a) 
clinicians prefer  patient speci fic informatio n to general  approaches  to acute  abdominal pain  b) 
clinicians  do not want  to calculate  a patient’s  risk for appendicitis  by [CONTACT_355415],  
and c) a “time -of-ordering  alert”  can promote  replacement  of CT with  ultras ound but is not sufficient  
to reduce  total diagnos tic imaging.  Based  on the pi[INVESTIGATOR_355355]’s previous  work,  we 
conclude  that the success  of the proposed  Appy -CDS intervention  can be maximized  by: (1) Making  
decision  support  available  at the point  of care  and based on all available  relevant  clinical data;  (2) 
Providing  patient -specific  information  in a sophisticated  manner,  beyond  simple  prom pts or 
reminders;  (3) Integrating  the CDS into the routine  flow of patient care;  and (4) Ensuring adequate  ED 
staff training,  process measurem ent, and feedback  to reinforce  use.

 3) Study Sites and P opulation  
We will conduct  a pros pective  clust er-rand omized clinical trial at [ADDRESS_442741] and ultrasound  utilizat ion in 
intervention  and control  sites  will be measured  for 24 months  after the full Appy -CDS “go-live”  date.  
Rates  of perforation,  negative  appendectomies,  and missed appendicit is will be monitored  as safety 
outcomes.  We will compare  resource  use and re-visit rates  between intervention  and control  EDs within  
7 days  of the index  ED visit.  Figure  2 is an overview  of the study  design.  
 
This study  inclu des 17 gene ral EDs operated  by [CONTACT_355416]: HPMG  (Regions, Hudson,  Lakevie w, 
Methodist, Westfield  and Amery ), in the Upper  Midwest  and KPNC  (Sacramento,  Roseville,  South  San 
Francisco,  San Rafael,  Sant a Clara,  South  Sacramento,  San Leandro,  San Francisco,  Fremont, Oakland  and 
Rich mond). These 17 EDs provide  care  to a diverse  pedia tric patient  population  (34% Hispanic,  19%  African -
American,  and 11% Asian) . None  of the particip ating  EDs are university -based;  howeve r, [ADDRESS_442742] -certifi ed emergency  medicine  
physicians.  Ultrasound  is available  at each  particip ating  ED, and 5 sites  are referral centers  for pediatric  
appendectomies.  Each  ED currently  uses the Epi[INVESTIGATOR_355356] (Verona, WI). Both  health  systems have  agreed  to 
particip ate and work  with  the study investigato rs to create linkages  between  their  EHR and the Appy -CDS 
tool. Collectively , the [ADDRESS_442743]  more  than 650,000 annua l ED visits, of which 101,014  are 
patient s aged  5-20 years).  
 
To be included, patients must: a) be 5 -20.9 years old on the index date, and b) present to a participating 
ED with a chief complaint of acute abdominal pain.  
a) Exclusion C riteria  
Using data from the EHR and gathered from triage -based prompts introduced at all participating EDs, 
we will identify patients with a current pregnancy, previous abdominal surgery, trauma, cystic fibrosis, 
sickle cell anemia, inflammatory bowel disease, or other selected comorbidities at the prime site, or with an ED visit for abdominal pain in the prior 7 days . These patients will be excluded from the study 
cohort.  As described below, b ased on responses to the initial screening questions, patients with >120  
hours of abdominal pain or patients with no right sided or generalized abdominal pain will also be excluded from the risk score calculation and further analyses.  
 
If patients are transferred to an outside facility  (outside of KPNC or Health Partners netwo rks) for 
surgery and we are unable to review their operativ e and pathology notes, they will  be excluded  from 
the safety  analys es. These patients will be retained in the primary analyses, evaluating the use of CT or 
US, with the diagnosis of appendicitis  or not appendicitis  assigned based on provider impression and 
imaging available at the time of ED discharge / transfer.  
b) Patient Recruitment  
Patients will be identified based on a chief complaint of abdominal pain and at HP, using automated alerts 
within the electronic health record ( EHR). A flag will be created for patients who  meet eligibility criteria. 
The flag will  be stored in Epic for use by [CONTACT_355417] ( CDS) at a later point.  Although 
13 Appy -CDS Manual of Operations  
Version 19 –Updated February 6, 2018 ; Originated January 2016.  
  
 
 the process of identifying eligible patients is fully automated, success of the study depends , to a large 
extent , on the engagement of nursing staff and providers at all participating  sites. Enrollment can be 
maximized by [CONTACT_2329] a combination of the methods outlined below.  
1. Education of nurses, physicians and residents providing care in each emergency 
department (ED).  
a. Present the study at ED staff meetings.  
b. Train nurses and providers at shift meetings or other meetings as appropriate . 
c. Use the “ train the trainer ” approach  including the recruitment of “champi[INVESTIGATOR_5458]” to 
promote the project.  
2. Put in place a system to remind physicians about the EHR tools available to them .  
3. Post laminated cards with project info next to all workstations as reminders to staff 
regarding the purpose and importance of responding to the EHR alerts . 
4. Incentives to nurses or providers for completing the EHR -linked tools.  
5. Provide feedback to nurses and providers regarding use rates.  
4) Allocatio n of I nterventions  
EDs will be stratified  by [CONTACT_2360] [INVESTIGATOR_355357]-matched  based  on pediatric  patient volume.  
Matching EDs on selected  characteristics  a priori  minimizes  possible  sources  of bias  by [CONTACT_355418]-level  confounders  between  intervention  arms . It will sharpen our com parisons  of interest  and it is 
recommended  for trials  with  a small number  of clusters85,[ADDRESS_442744] ician (GVB)  using a computerized  random - 
number generato r. Assignment  will be revea led before  implemen tation.  Emergency Department  
stakeholders  at each  site have agreed  to randomization  before  initiation of the study. 
5) Description of I ntervention  
Appy -CDS will be developed using existing CDS platforms at each site. The tool will be consistent but 
also locally relevant , thus will have subtle differences in design and workflow. Implementation and 
training will be tailored to local preferences.  
 
a) Design at HealthPartners  
At all HealthPartners  (HP)  sites , the Appy CDS has  [ADDRESS_442745] or 
ultrasound  and will present  a risk estimate  and targeted recommen dations.  Each  component  is 
desc ribed  in detail below.  Final algorithms  will be modified  based  on evaluation  of clinical workflow  and 
feedback  from  ED, radiology,  and surgery  clinical  leaders.  Detailed information of HP specific workflow

Triage  CDS:  When  a patient 5-20.9 years  old presents  to a participating  ED with  a chief  complaint  of 
14 Appy -CDS Manual of Operations  
Version 19 –Updated February 6, 2018 ; Originated January 2016.  
  
 
 abdominal  pain,  an alert  will trigger  prompting  the triage  nurse  (or provider at KPNC) to  answer  several 
discrete histor ical questio ns. Relevant  previous  diagnoses  will also be pulled  from  the EHR (e.g., sickle  
cell anem ia, inflammatory  bowel disease,  cystic  fibrosis,  previous  abdominal surgeries)  along  with  the 
results  of a urine pregnancy  test,  if obtained.  Thus Triage  CDS will consistently  apply exclusion  and 
inclusi on criteria across all sites  to identify  a subject  group, in real- time,  with  elevated  append icitis risk 
(Hy 1). This group will then  be targeted  by [CONTACT_355419] -CDS system  at intervention  sites and will serve  
as the comparison  group  at control sites  (Hy 2-3). 
 
MD Alert:  At intervention  sites, a provider EHR- based  alert  will trigger  for patients  identified  by [CONTACT_355420]. This alert  will provide  a recommendat ion that,  if appendicitis  is 
being considered,  to “order  a CBC and refer  to the risk -strat ification  algori thm” (acces sible  via 
embedded  hyperlink) .  
 
Imaging CDS:  At the interv ention  sites, when  a clinician  begins ordering  a CT or ultrasound  for a study -
eligib le pediatric  patient,  an alert box will prompt  the clinician  to answer  3 discrete questio ns about  the 
patient’s  histo ry and physical  exam findings.  This information  will be matched  to the data  provided  by 
[CONTACT_355421], processed through  a predefined  algorithm,  and presented  to the  clinician  in real time  as 
estimat ed risk of appendicitis.  As describ ed in detail below,  a risk estimate  will be developed  based  on 
data  from  our previous  multicenter  study.[ADDRESS_442746] 
(See  Appendix  A for design and workflow) .  
At all KPNC s ites, p ediatric patients with abdominal pain will be identified based on their chief complaint.  
Providers will be trained to complete additional appendicitis assessment questions within RISTRA, KPs 
existing platform linked within the EHR. Analogous to the HP sites, these questions will be used to assess 
eligibility and appendicitis risk.  
 
b) Design at Kaiser Permanente  
At KPNC intervention sites only , users will again be trained to use the RISTRA platform to access the CDS. 
There will be an interface  where providers  will be asked 3 -5 additional questions regarding the patient’s 
signs or symptoms.   The patient ’s individual appendicitis risk based on elicited questions  and information 
recorded in  the EHR  will then be presented . Based on this risk score, there will be targeted 
recommendations  for the provider to consider in their diagnostic evaluation. In addition, there will be a 
time of order BPA for Ultrasound and CT , again reminding providers to consider the appendicitis risk score.   
Figure  2 shows a high level schematic of the Appy -CDS across sites. Detailed information of KP specific 
workflow is illustrated in Appendix B .

c) Implementation of the Appy -CDS Intervention  
At intervention  sites, the Appy -CDS system  will provide patient -specific  targeted  recommen dations  to 
clinicians  during distinct  phases  of the clinical  encounter  to max imize  visibili ty and usability.  Furthermore,  
Appy -CDS is designed  to address  several common  reasons identified  by [CONTACT_355422],[ADDRESS_442747]. William  
Mize,  Chief  of Pediatric Radiology  at Children’s  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_355358],  have agreed  to serve  
on the Clinical Advisory Council.  We will conduct  detailed  clinical workfl ow assessments  at each  
participating  ED to ensure  proper integration.  We will seek letters  of agreement  from  the directors  at 
participating  EDs indicating their support  for the final Appy -CDS system. A list of Advisory Board 
members from each site is listed in Tables 12 and 13 . 
  
To address  lack of awareness  and lack of familiarity  with  the CDS syste m, Physician  and Nurse Champi[INVESTIGATOR_5458]  
(depending on site) will be recruited  from each  participating  ED. They  will receive  extensive training  from 
site PIs and project  managers  in the  Appy -CDS system.  Before  implementation  of the Triage  CDS, 
Physician  Champi[INVESTIGATOR_355359].  At the 
intervention  sites, before  implementation  of the full Appy -CDS,  Physician  Champi[INVESTIGATOR_355360] s to the MD alert  and Imaging CDS.  The site-based  Physician  Champi[INVESTIGATOR_355361]

 field questions  and reinforce  CDS use at the site.  
 
To address  low outco mes expec tancy, site PIs will provide  summary  repor ts to Physician  and or Nurse 
Champi [INVESTIGATOR_5458], who  will disseminate  them  to ED clinicians  at intervention  sites. Repor ts will include  the 
number  of patien ts with acute  abdominal  pain evaluated,  frequency  of use of Appy -CDS,  and ED return  
visits. This feedback  will promote  continued  use over  the 24-month  intervention.  At Kaiser, as in previous  
interventions ,67,68 we will use  small  group or individual incentives ($5 gift cards) to  facilit ate ED clinicia ns’ 
accep tance of new  EHR-based  tools.  HealthPartners  will also use small incentives including offering gift 
cards  for using the CDS and providing food to individual groups (e.g. residents a nd physician assistants) if 
a pre -specified threshold for CDS use is reached .  
 
The Appy -CDS intervention  will be implemented  over  4 phases,  as desc ribed  belo w. 
 
At Control and  Intervention  Sites  
Phase  1: The HP and KPNC Clinical Advisory  Councils will review and approve  the Appy -CDS system. The 
algorit hms underlying the CDS will reside  on a distinct  Web site housed on secure  servers  own ed by [CONTACT_355423]. Site  PIs will work  with  their  IT pers onnel  to integrate the triage CDS component  with  their  
EpiC are platform.   
 
Phase  2: We will first implement  Triage  CDS to screen  patients and crea te a cohort  at increased  risk 
for appendicit is. Once  the local  IT group s have  completed  the programming  necessar y, we will pi[INVESTIGATOR_355362]. Triage  nurses will be asked  to provide  feedback  on their  experience with  the Triage  
CDS, including assessment  of the clinical plausib ility, utility  of prompts, and impact on clinic  workflo w. 
 
At Intervention  Sites  Only 
Phase  3: Once  modifications  to the Triage  CDS are complete and the triag e tool fully  implemente d, we 
will begin to  develop  and test the MD Alert and the Imaging CDS components.  The clinician  study 
Investigators  will test the functionality  of the full Appy -CDS using a series  of simulated  patients meeting  
eligibility  criteria.  After the first round  of testing  and modificatio ns, we will pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]-test the MD Alert  and 
Imaging CDS componen ts at intervention  EDs in each  hospi [INVESTIGATOR_355363] [ADDRESS_442748] with training.  
 
Phase  4: Ongoing educ ation is critical to ensure  continued  use of the CDS throughout  the 24-month 
intervention.  Following  implemen tation, ED clinical supervisors and staff will receive email  reminders  
with  rates of use of  the triage alert (at HP), and the  CDS.  During the initial phase  of provider  education,  
adoption  of the new  practice  pattern  will be encouraged  through  the use of incentives . The project  
manager or Physician  Champi[INVESTIGATOR_355364] -CDS and gather  informal feedback.  We 
will conduct  a second  round  of staff trainin g on the CDS after the first implemen tation  year.

 6) Plan  of Ana lysis and Ana lytic Models  
a) Development  of a Risk -Prediction  Estimate  for use in Appy -CDS  
We derived a new pediatric Appendicitis Risk Calculator (pARC) from an existing, de -identified cohort of 
children with suspected appendicitis.21 Although the parent study included children 3 -18.9 years, given the 
low risk for appendicitis in children under 5 and increased likelihood of atypi[INVESTIGATOR_355365],96 
the pARC score was derived and validated in the subs et of children and adolescents 5 -18.9 years.  In the 
prior prospective study, conducted from March 2009 through April 2010, ED clinicians collected clinical 
data from patients with suspected appendicitis at 9 pediatric emergency departments (PEDs). Treatin g 
clinicians enrolled children and adolescents who presented to the PED with <96 hours of abdominal pain and under evaluation for suspected appendicitis.  “Suspected appendicitis” was defined as undergoing laboratory testing, diagnostic imaging or a surgic al consultation for possible appendicitis. Patients with the 
following conditions were excluded: pregnancy, prior abdominal surgery, inflammatory bowel disease, 
chronic pancreatitis, sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, a medical condition affecting the ab ility to obtain an 
accurate history, or history of abdominal trauma within the prior [ADDRESS_442749] been described 
previously.
21   
 We validated pARC using de -identified data from two independent cohorts of patients 5 -18 years with 
visits to the Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_355366] 2003 – 2004 and from 2013 –  2015. These cohorts 
were chosen as the validation sample as their criteria for cohort entry, data collect ion, data cleaning 
and data quality control were similar to those used in the derivation sample.  Consistent with the recommendations of Altman, the validation population did not overlap with the derivation population.
[ADDRESS_442750] research20 and quality improvement 
projects. For both, children and adolescents with possible appendicitis were prospectively identifie d by 
[CONTACT_355424] 10 hours per day. Subjects were included in the cohort when their treating emergency physician ordered advanced imaging or a surgical consult with concern for appendicitis.  
 
In both the derivation and validation cohorts, the primary outcome was appendicitis.   Patient history, 
physical exam, and laboratory variables were collected and prospectively recorded using standardized processes in the parent studies.
20,21  For consideration in pARC, we included only predictors with less 
than 10% missing data and at least moderate inter- rater reliability (kappa >.35).60 Following the 
prognostic model development approach recommend by [CONTACT_355425]98, we selected all potential 
predictors for the multivariable model based on the following rules: 1) variables associated with 
appendicitis with a p -value <0.05 in the age and gender adjusted models; 2) associations between 
variables and appendicitis were in the expected direction; 3) for binary predictors, the beta coefficient 
was greater than 0.4;  4)  Trans formation of the laboratory values to a normal scale and shape of the 
association was informed by [CONTACT_355426]; 5) If only WBC was available, but not ANC, the ANC 
was imputed as ANC = (-.8783  + 1.1008  * sqrt(WBC))^2 ;  6) If neither WBC nor ANC were available, the 
ANC was imputed as 7x103/µL, corresponding to the mean ANC in our derivation cohort; 7) 
Interactions between age and gender and each additional predictor with appendicitis were evaluated as potential terms in the model.  The final pARC model is shown below.

The newly derived pARC  was then applied to the validation cohort. We evaluated the discriminatory 
performance using the area under the curve (AUC) plot and AUC statistic.  
 
Complete data for the validation of pARC were available for 1426 patients.  Across seven clinically 
action able risk categories (< 5%, 5 -14%, 15 -24%, 25- 49%, 50- 74%, 75- 84% and ≥ 85%) the pARC score 
provided valid risk prediction. The AUC for pARC was 0.85 (95% CI 0.83 -0.87).99 
 
Hypothesis 1 : Among  pediatric  patients  with  abdominal  pain,  a triage -based  trigger will identify  those  
at risk for appendiciti s with  a negative  predictive  value  ≥99%  and positive  predic tive value  ≥20%. 
 
The purpose  of the Triage CDS (tria ge-based  trigger)  is to reliably  identify  a study  cohort  at elevated  risk 
of appendicit is at both  the intervention  and control  EDs.  This cohort  will comprise  the analytic  sample  
used  to determine  the impact  of the Appy -CDS system  on our key outcomes  of CT and ultrasound  use (Hy 
2 & 3) and health  care  costs  (Hy 4). In addition,  data  from  Triage  CDS will be included in the appendicit is 
risk algorithm (as  detailed  above).  Final content  of Triage  CDS will be based on our previous  decis ion 
rule,21 expert opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], and  revie w of ED workflow;  Appendix A demonstrates  the questions  that are 
includ ed. 
 
Assessment  of the Triage  CDS will consist  of [ADDRESS_442751],  the frequency  that triage  nurses  or providers 
answer questions  when prompted  in the EHR (pain  duration  <96 hours,  pain  on right  side, history  of 
emesis,  pain  with  walkin g) will be identified.  Second,  among  pediatric  patients  with  complete  data  in 
the EHR, the negative  and positive predictive  value  of the triage tool will be determined.  We 
hypothesize  that among  pediatric  patients with complete data,  the triage  tool will yield a positive  
19 Appy -CDS Manual of Operations  
Version 19 –Updated February 6, 2018 ; Originated January 2016.  
  
 
 predictive  value  of at least 20%  and a negative  predictive value  of at least  99%.  Due to variation  in 
design , patient load, and number  of urgent  pediatric  presentations, we  antici pate consider able 
differences in data capture  across  EDs.   Identifying these  differenc es will inform optimal site-specific  
system design  and training.  If the positi ve or negative  predictive  value  deviates  subs tantially  from  our 
goals,  (i.e., a 95% confidence  interval for negative  predictive  value  failing  to include  99% ), before  full 
implemen tation we will review  EHR data for all appendicit is cases and refine our trigger. Followi ng 
implemen tation,  we will prospective ly track  the performance  of the Triage  CDS at each  site and report 
performance  metrics  (sensitivity,  specificity,  positi ve predictive  value,  and negative  predictive  value).  If 
signifi cant  differences  are discover ed across  study sites,  we will use site-specif ic estimates  of negative 
and positive  predictive  values  as covari ates in multivariate  analysis  of our key study  outcomes  (Hy 2-4). 
 
Hypotheses 2 and 3 : Appy -CDS implemen tation  will reduce  CT and total diagnost ic imaging  (CT 
and ultrasound)  in patien ts identified  as at risk for appendicitis.  
 
Effectiveness  of the full Appy -CDS system  will be evaluated  using a cluster-randomized  trial.  We will 
inclu de da ta from  both the pre and post  intervention  periods  in the analysis  to account  for site-specific  
variation  and potential  imbalances  in baseline  imaging  use. Our analysis  will follow  an intent -to-treat 
approach  and cons ider both  randomization  and the timing  of the Appy -CDS imple mentation  at the 
particular study  site. Patient and ED- level  confo unding will be addressed  in three  ways.  First,  our paired  
randomization  scheme  will attempt to balance  potential  conf ounders  across study  arms before  Appy -CDS 
implemen tation.  Second,  we will use a pre- post  intervention  design  to account  for imbalances  at baseline  
in imaging  use. Third,  before  final analysis,  we will com pare patient  characterist ics across study arms  and 
randomized  pairs. If ED or patient -level characteris tics deviate  in the control  and intervention  arms,  they  
will be adjusted  for in multivariable  models.  
 
To test the effectiveness  of the full Appy -CDS system,  we will com pare ratios  of CT and ultrasound  use pre 
and post  implemen tation  across study  arms (i.e., difference-in-differences  approach).  This is best  desc ribed  
as estimating  a time  (pre/post  intervention)  by [CONTACT_9866].  We will conclude  that the Appy -CDS 
changed CT  or other  imaging  and/or  ultrasou nd utilizat ion if signifi cance  at the 5% level is found using a 2-
tailed  test.  To best  estima te this effect across  the entire  pediatr ic ED patient population,  we will fit a 
marginal model that provides  population -level  impacts averaged  across  all clusters.86 To do this,  
gener alized  estimating  equatio ns (GEE)100 and a log-linear model  with  an autoregressive  covariance  
structure will be employed.  A parsimonious approach  to multivariable  adjustment  will be follo wed,  and 
only  factors  found unbala nced across  study  arms  at the 5% level  and assoc iated  with  the effect size (>.2)  
will be retained  and included  in the models  as covari ates. 
 
Exploratory Analysis   
Effectiveness  of the intervention  may  vary  by [CONTACT_355427] r. Although  our study  
may  be underpowered  to detect such  differences,  we intend  to conduct  two exploratory analyses.  The 
first will examine  if patient and provider characteristics  act as moderators  of the overall intervention  
effect,  examining both  single  predic tors, such  as patient age,  sex, and risk of appendicitis  and a 
composite  moderato r.101 Our second  exploratory  analysis  will focus on the process  of provider  change, 
com paring  trajectories  of imaging  and ultrasound  use across  intervention  sites.  
 
Hypothesis 4 – resource utilization:  The skewed nature  of health  care  utiliza tion patterns  is well 
known .102,103  This is particularly  true  of epi[INVESTIGATOR_355367]

 has a known likelihood  of complicatio ns.[ADDRESS_442752]  outlined in the literature  and model  
the total amount  of emergency  and hospi [INVESTIGATOR_307]-based  care  used  during the treatment epi[INVESTIGATOR_355368]-visits due to misdiagnos is or surgic al complicati ons. This will begin  by [CONTACT_355428]-visits due to an adverse event  (e.g., wound  infection,  abdominal  absc ess, and obstruction ) 
or other  unplanned  re-admission  using logistic regression.  Then  we will directly  model  the total costs of the 
treatment epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  The choice  of a statistic al approach  to model  epi[INVESTIGATOR_355369]. The most  common approach  is the log-linear model.  Howeve r, this model  
requires  the use of a retransfo rmation  factor  that is sensitive  to heterosced asticit y.[ADDRESS_442753].  To facilit ate this approach,  an alternative  hierarchic al estimation  technique,  GEE,  
may  be considered.  GEE extends the gener alized  linear model to allow  for covariance  matrices  that specify  
clustering  of the data (e.g. at the ED level).  
 
We anticip ate some  variation  in billin g practic es across  study sites  and variation  in patterns  of care. Thus,  
we will examine  health  care  utilizat ion from two perspectives,  distinguished  by [CONTACT_355429].  The first 
analytic dataset will  inclu de the entire sample  and will focus  on ED and other  hospi [INVESTIGATOR_355370].  This analysis  will focus  upon  the impact of the Appy -CDS from  a single  hospi [INVESTIGATOR_355371]. 
The second analytic  dataset will be limited  to those  insured by [CONTACT_355430].  This tighten ed 
sample  will provide  complete  capture of  all billed  and reimbursed  medical  care  and accurate ly estimate 
the risks  of ED re-visit and total epi[INVESTIGATOR_355372] -CDS’  impact across  the broad er 
health  care  system.  
 
Similarly , two utilizat ion measures  will be employed.  The first will be Total Cost  Relative  Resource  Value  
units (TCR RVs), which  are endorsed  by [CONTACT_355431]  (NQF )105 to measure  costs for the full 
study cohort.  TCRRVs are based  on Centers  for Medicare  and Med icaid Services  (CMS)  relative  value  units 
(RVUs) but  extend  RVU meas ures to inclu de inpatient,  outpatient surger y, ED services,  and scheduled  
outpatient, professional,  and pharmacy  services  that do not have  CMS  RVU weigh ts. Because  TCRRVs 
value services similarly  to RVUs, TCRRVs are convertible  to dollars  using the Medicare  cost factor and 
have  been  used  by [CONTACT_355432].106- 109 The second  measure  will be 
billed  amoun ts, or the to tal dollars  billed,  including patient  co-pays and deductibl es. The use of billed  
amoun ts allows  com parison between  hospi [INVESTIGATOR_355373] (open  access) and KPNC  (total cost per member)  
systems. Although  we do not antici pate significant  differences  in 
adverse  event rates post  Appy -CDS implemen tation if these do 
occu r, we will  determine  the long  term health  care  cost and 
quality  of life impact by [CONTACT_12780][INVESTIGATOR_007] a simulation  model  of the 
Appy -CDS implemen tation using established  techniques.106,[ADDRESS_442754] of the full implementation of Appy -CDS 
(Hy 2). Power estimates are based on 14 clinical sites.  We anticipate 15 sites will be available, 8 intervention and 7 control sites.  Over the 36 -month study peri od, we anticipate 24,603 
patients aged 5 -20.9  will present with acute abdominal pain, of 
whom 2,634 (11%) will have appendicitis. Based on our previous work and review of other prediction rules, we anticipate that the Triage CDS will identify about 50% of 
patients who present to the ED with acute abdominal pain as being “at risk for appendicitis”. Thus, the Table 1. Power estim ates*

 total number of patients at risk for  appendicitis, and whose outcomes we will evaluate across the 14 EDs, 
is forecasted to be 4,200 per year (or on average, 300 patients per ED ). Based on preliminary data from 
the participating EDs, we estimate that the baseline utilization of CT is 30%. We anticipate that the group 
of ED -level covariates and the temporal correlation with the error structure will  explain a significant 
proportion of variance of the dependent variable. However, power may be overestimated because 
sample sizes will vary by [INVESTIGATOR_6679].[ADDRESS_442756] with alpha set to 0 .05. Actual 
power of our intervention may vary is enrollment goals are not reached.  
 
Missing data   
Missing  data on predictors  of appendicitis  and use of diagnostic  imaging  in patien ts identified  at risk  of 
appendicit is will be handled  using multiple  impu tation  techniques  applying a regression  switching with 
predictive  mean  matching (MICE -PMM).119 Patient  characteristics,  implemen tation  variables,  and provider 
characteris tics will be used to maximize  informat ion used  for multiple  impu tations.  
b) Measurement of Outcomes   
Progress  of all eligible patien ts before and during implemen tation  will be followed  for all outcom es. 
 
Identification of a cohort of patients with acute abdominal pain at risk for appendicitis  (Hypo thesis  1): 
Using  existing  EHR data and simple promp ts implemented  at triage  at all 17 sites  over  the 6-month  pre- 
intervention  period  and 24-month  trial we  will iden tify our study  cohort  of children  and adolescen ts at 
elevated risk  for appendicitis.  The algorit hm underlyi ng this tool will exclude  patients  with  chronic 
abdominal pain,  abdominal  trauma, and/or pregnancy,  because  their manageme nt is beyond  the scope  of 
the propos ed intervention.  For patients undergoing an appendectomy  within  [ADDRESS_442757] or will review  their  pathol ogy report.  For patients undergoing 
appendectomy, a ppendicit is is defined  by [CONTACT_355433],  as in our previous  
multicenter  study  (consistent  with appendicitis,  neutrophil  invasion  of tissue, serosal inflammation,  acute  
peri-appendicitis,  or acute appendicitis).21  For patients with perfor ation undergoing drainage and or 
intravenous antibiotics and interval appendectomy, diagnosis will be based on clinical notes from the treating 
surgeon.  For pati ents transferr ed from  the ED where  they initially  sought  care  to a facility  with  pediatric  
surgical expertise, we  will seek final diagnoses  and patho logy reports  from  the receiving  insti tution. If we 
are unable to verify final diagnosis, the patient will be excluded from primary analys es.  These patients may 
be included sensitivity analyses with  the diagnosis of appendicitis or not appendicitis assigned based on provider 
impression and imaging available at the time of ED discharge / transfer.  For HPMG,  outside  of the study EDs,  
Children’s  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_355374].  Thus,  we will estab lish a registry  of patients  with  a discharge  diagn osis of appendic itis from  
Children’s  Hosp ital and use a probabilis tic method  to determine  whether  these  patients  are matches  with  
patients  receiving  care  in the HPMG  study  EDs.  KPNC  uses  a hub and spoke  system for pediatric  surgery.

codes:  [ZIP_CODE],  [ZIP_CODE],  [ZIP_CODE],  [ZIP_CODE],  7417 6, [ZIP_CODE],  [ZIP_CODE],  [ZIP_CODE],  and [ZIP_CODE].  Only  CTs ordered  in the

Appendiceal perforation, negative appendectomies, and missed appendicitis  (safety  outcomes):  
Although  it is unlik ely that the Appy -CDS will significantly  increase  rates  of adverse  events,  the following  
clinical or safety  outcomes  will be monitored  both  before  and during the full Appy -CDS interv ention.  
Appendiceal perforation will be evaluated  in patients who  undergo  appendectomy  based on chart  review  
of the surgeon’s intra- operat ive note.  As in our previous  work,  perforation  will be defined  by [CONTACT_355434] (presence  of abscess, peritonitis,  complex  appendicit is, or purulent  material).  In 
addi tion, we will review all charts  for patients  with  a discharge  diagnosis  of perforated  appendicitis  (ICD-9 
540.1)  who  do not undergo  an appendect omy during their index  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  because  a subset  of 
patients  with  appendiceal  perforation  (4% in our previous  multicenter  cohort, unpublis hed data)  will be 
admitted  for intravenous  antibio tics and undergo  an interval appendectomy  6-[ADDRESS_442761] omies  in which the  patholo gy report  reveals  no evidence  of appendiceal  
inflammation.  This will be determined  via review  of pathology  reports.  Miss ed appendici tis is when  a 
patient  presents  for the evaluation  of abdominal  pain,  is discharged  home,  and returns  with in 1 week  with  
appendici tis. Missed  appendicit is will be ident ified through  review of automated  EHR data  for all patients  
with appendici tis. As described above, under exclusion criteria, patients who are transferred for definitive 
care and whose final pathology and surgical reports are not available will not be included in the 
assessment of safety outcomes.

 7) Reporting and Data S torage  
a) Capturing Transfer P atients  
One of the unique challenges of this project at the prime site is that many children in this age group are 
transferred to another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_355375]. A subset of patients presenting to a 
HealthPartners or HealthPartners affiliated  ED who are eligible for Appy CDS will most likely be transferred 
to Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_355376]. In order to evaluate final diagnoses for 
these patients, a process for identifying and linking patients has been developed  and is outline d in Figure 
3.

  Data transfers will occur on a monthly basis. The limited data set sent from HP to Children’s  will include a 
study ID, date  of birth , sex, arrival date, discharge date, reason for encounter, disposition, and discharge 
disposition of patients that were transferred from a HealthPartners facility to Children’s.  Files will be sent 
through secure file transfer and password protect ed. The above figure  illustrates  the process for capturing 
transfer patients  and evaluating final outcomes . 
 
In other cases, if patients are transferred out of the HP or KP system for surgery and we are unable to review the operative and pathology notes we will exclude them from the primary  analys es because we 
cannot confirm appendicitis based on our definition.   In sensitivity analyses we will explore inclusion of 
these patients with classification  of final diagnosis (appendicitis versus other surgical or medical condition) 
based on diagnosis at the time of transfer.   
 
b) Ongoing reporting  
Study enrollment and use of the CDS will be monitored and reported on a weekly and/or monthly basis 
using automated data. Use reports will be shared with ED leaders and staff to encourage ongoing use of the tool. This approach has proved successful in previous projects.  
 
Internal reporting, to promote continued CDS use, will vary by [CONTACT_3725]. At HealthPartners, we will report 
responses to the Triage BPA for the 6 participating sites and risk score calculation for the interve ntion 
sites, on a monthly basis, with additional weekly reporting as needed.

 Protection of Human Subjects  
 
a) Risks  to Subjects  
Human Subjects Involvement and Characteristics   
Potentially eligible s tudy  subjects  will include  roughly 25,[ADDRESS_442762] right sided or generalized abdominal pain for <5 days, and no other 
exclusion criteria, and thus be enrolled.   
 
Study  subjects  also include  roughly  414 clinician s at the two participating  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_355377]  (17 EDs).  
To participate  in this study,  ED clinician s must  prac tice at one of the 17 EDs and be train ed in   
emergency medicine,  internal  medicine,  or family  medicine  or be a physician  exten der (nurse    
practitioner or physician assistan t).  
 Limited  clinical data  from automat ed diagnost ic, pharmacy,  and laborat ory databases  will be collected  for 
study subjects  for specified  periods  of time  to (a) identi fy eligibility  for the study  and the analysis based  on 
age, presenting  chief  complaint,  comorbid  conditio ns, and responses  to the Appy -CDS system and to (b) 
assess  the impact  of study interven tions  on implementation  of Appy -CDS on use of CT and ultrasound  and 
rates  of perforated  appendicitis,  negative  appendectomy,  and miss ed appendici tis. 
 
Sources of Materials   
All necessary  data  to determine  eligibility,  implement  and operate  the intervention,  and assess  the impact  
of the intervention  are derived  from  the EHRs  or health  plan  or medical group  administrative databases.  
  Database Design  
  A relational database  to store patient -level  data  extracted  from  administrative  and EHR databases  at 
each  site will be devel oped,  linkin g information  from  different  time  points  during the ED visit and 
retrieving  chief  complain ts, laborato ry data,  radiology  data,  disposition  final diagnos es, and resp onses  to 
any interactive  prompts  to a specific  individual  on a speci fic date  using a fixed patient  identifier.  In 
addition, diagnoses  from previous  ED visits  will be retrieved.  
 
Data Standardization and Validation Studies   
We will establish  common study  variable  definitions  drawn from  national  standards  and definitio ns used  in 
previous  studies.
[ADDRESS_442763]  variable  definitions  and data -extraction  procedu res for 
demographics,  enrollment  characteristics,  chief  complaints,  previ ous diagnos es, laboratory  values  (WBC 
count),  use of CT and ultrasound  (whether  imaging  study  was conducte d), operative and  pathol ogy 
reports,  and patient  disposition  (discharge,  admission, operation,  or transfer).  We will develop conceptual  
and operati onal definiti ons and technical specifications  for data elements  without  established definitions.  
Data from  all sources will be restruc tured into a common  format  and data  elements  combined  into 
uniform  files.  All person -level inform ation will be linked  by a unique  identi fier so data  can be compi[INVESTIGATOR_355378].  Data  integrity  will be assessed  to ensure  that observations  are valid,  reliable,  and 
consistent.  Each  variable  will be tested for completeness  and out-of-range  values.  
 
Data Security  
To prot ect patient  confidentiality,  we will crea te an analytic  dataset  that includ es only  encrypted study  
28 Appy -CDS Manual of Operations  
Version 19 –Updated February 6, 2018 ; Originated January 2016.  
  
 
 identif iers. The analytic  datas et will be created from  various databases  that include the actu al patient 
identifiers.  We will use an encryption  algorithm  to create  the encrypted  study  identifie rs. For KPNC,  only  
analytic da tasets  will be transferred  to HPMG.  These  datas ets will include the minimum  necess ary data  for 
conducting the primary  analyses.  A table  that maps  encrypted  study  identifiers  to actual patient  identifiers  
will be stored  at the Institute.  We will also adhere  to all requirements  imposed  by [CONTACT_355436]  (IRB) and all legal requirements  such  as HIPAA. 
 
Potential Risks  
Risks  to ED clinici an study  subjects are considered  minimal and princi pally involve considerati on of the 
risk of violation  of confidentiality  of study  data. If confidentiality  were  breach ed and quali ty of care  were  
seriously  out of range  for one or more  ED clinicians,  leadership  of the particip ating  hospi [INVESTIGATOR_355379]. Therefore,  no identi fying inform ation on individual  ED clinician  performance  with 
respect  to the clinical domains  addressed  in this study  or any other  aspect  of care  gathered  as part of this 
research  project  will be made  availa ble to hospi [INVESTIGATOR_355380],  com pensation,  
or discip linary  decisio ns. Furthermore,  this research  proje ct will not alter  pre-existing  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_355381] -of-care  assess ments to evaluate  the performance  of ED clinician s. Potential  risks  to study  
subjec ts who  are patien ts include  the possibility  that the intervention  may  provide  CDS advice  to ED 
clinicians  that may  be inappropriat e for a given  individual  patient  and,  if applied  without further checking 
the clinical status of a given  patient,  could lead  to erroneous  therap y, adverse  even ts, disabilit y, or death.  
Howeve r, the clinical reco mmendations  are primarily  related  to giving  clinicia ns a risk assessment  for 
appendicitis  based  on published  data and clinical  consens us among  physician  leade rs in each  participating 
instituti on. Therefore,  the risk of untoward  consequences  of such  clinic al actions  is low. Moreove r, this 
potential risk  is routi nely present  in every  clinical encoun ter in the health care  system. We have  
described  below  the methods  used  to minimize  this risk. 
b) Adequa cy of Protection  Against  Risks  
Recruitment and Informed Consent  
Potential  adverse  effects on the patien ts: We have requested and received  waivers of written  informed  
consent  from the KPNC and HP IRBs,  for patien ts for  the following reasons:  (a) All open treatment options  
identified  by [CONTACT_355437]- based  and will  have  been  agreed  to as the standard  of care by 
[CONTACT_355438] [INVESTIGATOR_600]. Furthermor e, no care  is advocated  that would  deviate 
subs tantially  from  the standard  of care  for pediatric  patien ts with abdominal  pain. Theref ore, our 
intervention  does  not represent  any additional  risk to patien ts beyond  the routine risk  that all patients 
assume  whenever  they have  contact [CONTACT_355439].  (b) At intervention training  sessions, 
we will emphasize  that it is inappropriate  for a ED clinician  to follow suggest ed treatment options  with out 
further  checking  the clinical  status  of a given  patient  and that they  must  use our CDS tools  as ad junc ts, not 
replacemen ts for clinical judgment.  (c) It would  be impractical to consent  patien ts (due  to large numbers  of 
patien ts—up to 10%  of all ED visits) and impossible  to answer  the primary  research  questions  (due to 
selec tion effects related  to consent)  if written informed  consent  of patien ts were  required. Although  
unlikely, there is a small  chance  that imple mentation  of the acute abdominal  pain CDS tool will increase  
the likelihood  of a missed  case  of appendicit is. We will monitor  for missed  cases  of appendicit is and rate  of 
perforated  appendicitis , along with other important safety outcomes thro ughout  the study and report  
missed  cases  to the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) . 
 
Potential  adverse  effects for the ED providers:  In particip ating EDs,  we have requested and received  
29 Appy -CDS Manual of Operations  
Version 19 –Updated February 6, 2018 ; Originated January 2016.  
  
 
 waivers of informed consent  from the KPNC and HPC IRBs  for the clinicians  particip ating in the CDS trial 
for the following  reasons:  (a) All treatment options included  in the CDS algorithms  will be based  on the 
best  available  clinical evidence,  and all recommendatio ns will be reviewed  with  site-based  clinical 
leade rs. Thus,  the care  recommendations  will conform  to current s tandards  of care  and ought not to 
represent  any additional  risk. 
 
Because  clinicians will  main tain autonomy  regarding  the decision  to obtain a CT or ultrasou nd, we do not 
expect legal consequences  related  to recommen dations  given as part of the CDS.  Clinicians’  nam es will not 
be transmitted  to the  data collection  center. Drs. Anupam Kharb anda,  Elyse  Kharbanda,  Dustin  Balla rd, 
David  Vinson,  Mich ael Zwank  and Patrick  O’Connor  have  no role in employing the ED clinici ans who  may  be 
involved  in this stud y. 
 
Protection against Risk  
The following measures  will be taken to prot ect ED clinic ians and patients from  the risk  of breach of 
confide ntiality:  A unique  study  ID code  unrelated  to the medical  record  number  or other  study subject -
specific information  will be assigned  to each patient  and provider  study  subject and used  to link data 
from  various  sources  and needed  for analysis.  A crosswalk  table  linking  this code  number  to a provider  or 
patient  name  [CONTACT_355469]  [ADDRESS_442764] wrongly on the basis  
of information provided through CDS developed for this study: Each project -related  communication to  
providers will include a written explanation indicating that the CDS is a suggestion, not a mandate, and that the action should be taken only if judged clinically appropriate by [CONTACT_355440]’s health, previous health care, current treatment, and other factors.  
c) Potential  Benefits  of the Proposed Research  to the Subjects  and  Others  
No claim  is made  in communications  with  ED provider  study  subjects  that any personal  benefit  will accrue  
from participating  in this project. Neither  clinician s nor other  clinical staff will have any defined benefits  
from participating  in this project aside  from small,  monetary  group  incentives  (raffles)  designed  to 
encourage familiarity  with  the Appy -CDS system. The CDS designed  to optimize  identification  and 
management  of appendicit is in children  may  familiarize  some  clinicians  with  new  and potentially  useful 
information  that can be used  to improve  the care  they  provi de. ED clinic ians at participating  sites will not 
rece ive direct  monetary compensation  for time  devoted  to the study.  All incentives will be approved by 
[CONTACT_355441].  
 Patient  study subjects  and their  parents  or legal  guardians  will have  no defined  personal  benefit  from 
participating  in this project and will receive  no compensation.  No comm unication  between  research  
team members  and study  subject  patients  is planned  as part of the study  protocol.  Although  some  
patients  may receive  better  identificat ion or management  of their  abdominal  pain  as a result  of this 
intervention,  no claim  of clin ical benefit to an individual patient can or will be made.  There will be no 
compensation  for participatio n. The minimal  risks  of study participa tion are reasonable,  despi[INVESTIGATOR_355382]. 
 
30 Appy -CDS Manual of Operations  
Version 19 –Updated February 6, 2018 ; Originated January 2016.  
  
 
 Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained  
If the interventions  significantly  improve  identifica tion of appe ndicitis  and the management  of child ren 
with acute  abdominal pain,  we expect to observe  a decrease  in the use of CT for these  patients.  This will 
have  the effect  of decreasing the exposure  to ionizing radiation  for the individual  patient and thus lowering  
the associa ted risk of canc er. If the interventions  fail to significan tly improve  identifica tion of patients  with 
appendicit is, that knowl edge will also be important  because  it will direct  the attention  of investigat ors to 
other, potentially  more  fruitful,  lines  of investigation.  Thus, regardl ess of specific findin gs, the results  of this 
trial will provide  important  new  knowledge  that will ultim ately contribute to improved  care  of pediatric  
patients  with acute  abdominal  pain.  
 
Collaborating Sites  
This study  will be conducted  at emergency  departments  operated  by [CONTACT_355442]  
(HPMG) and  Kaiser Permanente Northern  [LOCATION_004] (KPNC).  There  will be subcontracts  to KPNC  and 
Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_355349].  DSMB  members  will be selected  from institutio ns other  
than  HPMG, Children’s  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_355349],  or KPNC,  as described  below.  No other  
instituti onal subcontrac ts are antici pated.  
 
Special Populations  
The study  will include  pediatric  and adolescent patients  [ADDRESS_442765] common  surgical emergency  for this age group;  thus,  it is important  to study  this disease  in this 
population.  Furthermor e, this age group has been excluded  or underrepresented  in previous  research  
studi es that  have  examined  the utility  of CDS.  To ensure  that CDS recommend ations  for identificati on 
and manageme nt of acute  abdominal  pain  are clinically appropriate,  we will exclude pregn ant or 
post partum adolescen ts. 
9) Data  Safety  and  Monitoring   
Oversight of the trial is provided by [CONTACT_079](s) (PI), Drs. Elyse and Anupam Kharbanda at 
the HealthPartners sites and Drs. Dustin Ballard and David Vinson at Kaiser Permanente of Northern 
[LOCATION_004]. In addition, co -investigators [CONTACT_355475], [CONTACT_355476] O’Connor, [CONTACT_355477] riela  Vazquez-
Benitez, and [CONTACT_355478] will assist with oversight throughout the project.   
 This study will be conducted as a multi -site, cluster randomized trial that targets  a vulnerable population, 
childre n.  As recommended by [CONTACT_133812], we will compose an Independent Data Monitoring Committee 
(IDMC) that includes four members with expertise in clinical trials methodology and the topic areas targeted in the proposed research. In addition, our NICHD Project Offi cer, will be  invited to participate in 
conference calls . The PI(s) will participate in the DSMB meetings in a limited way as recommended in NIH 
policy.   
 
The IDMC for this study is guided by [CONTACT_355443]:  
 
1. Ensuring and enhancing the safety of the study; that is to protect the study participant from unacceptable risk; and  
 2. Assuring the scientific validity of the study; that is, to protect the data and preserve its integrity.  
 
31 Appy -CDS Manual of Operations  
Version 19 –Updated February 6, 2018 ; Originated January 2016.  
  
 
 The members of the IDMC will serve as an independent advi sory group and are required to provide 
recommendations about starting, continuing, and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_355383]. More specifically, the IDMC 
will: 
 
• Review the research protocol, and plans f or data and safety monitoring;  
 
• Review methodology used to help maintain the confidentiality of the study data and the results of 
monitoring by [CONTACT_355444];  
 
• Monitor  study  design,  procedures  and  events  that  will  maximize  the  safety  of  the  s tudy 
participants and minimize the risks;  
 • Evaluate the progress of the study, including periodic assessments of data quality and timeliness, 
rate of cohort entry, participant risk versus benefit, performance of the study site(s), and other 
factors that may affect study outcome;  
 • Consider factors external to the study when relevant information becomes available, such as scientific or therapeutic developments that may have an impact on the safety of the participants or the ethics of the study;  
 • Review serious adverse event documentation and safety reports and make recommendations 
regarding protection of the safety of the study participants;  
 • Report to the participating IRBs, if requested, on the safety and progress of the study;  
 
• Evaluate and report  to the participating IRBs on any perceived problems with study conduct, 
enrollment, sample size, and/or data collection;  
 
• Provide to the participating IRBs a recommendation regarding continuation, termination or other modifications of the study based on  the cumulative experience including the observed beneficial or 
adverse effects of the treatment under study;

IDMC Conf lict of Interest (COI)  
It is extremely important that all members of the IDMC state any real or apparent COIs at the onset of the 
study. Members of the IDMC shall read the NICHD Clinical Research Guidance Document regarding COI 
and will provide their signed summary of any COIs to the Study Project Manager, Heidi Ekstrom .  Prior to 
each meeting, all members of the Appy -CDS IDMC will have an opportunity to state whether they have 
developed any new COIs since the pr evious meeting. If a new COI is identified, it must be documented in 
the table above and a new signed summary of the COI should be provided to the Project Manager, to be shared with the  Project officer for the study.  If a new conflict is reported, the Chair and staff will 
determine if the conflict limits the ability of the IDMC member to participate in the discussion.  
 
Compensation  
All IDMC Voting members will be compensated for their role in supporting the committee. Compensation 
will be  $[ADDRESS_442766] meeting for the IDMC for EHR -based Decision Support for Pediatric Acute

It is expected that all IDMC members who are identified in the table above will attend every meeting. However, it is recognized that this may not always be possible. Therefore, the IDMC for Appy -CDS has 
established the following quorum for voting.  A quorum of this IDMC is considered to be the IDMC 
statistician and [ADDRESS_442767] manager before each 
meeting or call to allow members adequate time to prepare for the meeting. Meeting materials , once the 
full intervention has begun,  will include the following reports and data:  
 
• Adverse event data  
• Other  safety data 
• Quality and completeness of study data  
• Enrollment data 
 The IDMC will review the above information at each meeting to ensure proper conduct of the study.   
Details regarding the proposed data to be reviewed and approach to analyses are detailed below.  
 
Monitoring Procedures  
A passive surveillance strategy is proposed to monitor adverse events in the study population. Programs 
will be automated to collect appropriate safety variables and data analyzed by [CONTACT_355446]/analysts and the  study statistician, [CONTACT_355480] -Benitez.  Clinical records for all 
potential adverse events will be reviewed by [CONTACT_355447].  Reports will be 
presented at biannual meetings and summaries of IDMC recommendations will be submitted to 
participating IRBs.  
 Study data are accessible at all times for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_6254] -investigators to review. During the intervention 
35 Appy -CDS Manual of Operations  
Version 19 –Updated February 6, 2018 ; Originated January 2016.  
  
 
 period, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_6254] -investigators will monitor study conduct (subject accrual, CDS use rates) on a bi-
weekly basis.  The PIs, co -investigators, and IDMC will safety data in aggregate on a bi- annual basis.  The 
PIs will ensure that all protocol deviations, AEs, and SAEs are reported to the NICHD and IRB according to 
the applicable regulatory requirements.  
 
This is a m inimal risk study that proposes a passive safety surveillance strategy. To evaluate potential 
adverse events, we will collect and report on automated data for patients with a chief complaint of 
abdominal pain at intervention  and control ED sites. Specific safety outcomes  to be evaluate d will be 
reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_31849].  Proposed safety outcomes are listed in Tables 4 -7 below.

Missed eligibles  may occur at several stages.  First, the Triage BPA may not fire due to changes in 
workflow and timing of nurse charting of chief complaint.  Second, the Triage BPA may not be completed, thus eligibility cannot be confirmed.  Third, patients with final diagnosis unavailable, perhaps due to 
transfer to an outside facility, cannot be captured.   
 
We will compare ED visits for the target age group with abdominal pain as a chief complaint to confirm 
either cohort entry or intentional exclusion.  Those who appe ar to be eligible but not included in the 
cohort will be listed as missed eligible.  On a quarterly  basis we will review missed eligible cases and 
review for cases of appendicitis in this group . 
 
Meeting Protocol  
IDMC meetings and calls for the Appy -CDS wi ll be organized into open, closed, and executive sessions. 
Definitions for each meeting type are included below. The meeting type will be identified by [CONTACT_355449].  
 Open sessions  
 Information will be presented to the IDMC by [CONTACT_30967], with time for discussion.  
 
Closed sessions 
The IDMC, study statistician, and Study Project Manager will discuss confidential data from the study, 
including information on efficacy and s afety by [CONTACT_2939].  
 The IDMC may decide whether to remain masked to the treatment assignments at each meeting. If the 
closed session occurs on a conference call, steps will be taken to ensure that only the appropriate participants are on the call and  to invite others to re- join the call only at the conclusion of the closed 
session.  
 Executive sessions  
 Only the IDMC members are present to discuss study issues independently. Voting on recommendations 
will follow Roberts’ Rules of Order (Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised (10th Edition) by [CONTACT_86809] M. 
Robert III, William J. Evans (Editor), Daniel H. Honemann (Editor), Thomas J. Balch (Editor), Sarah Corbin 
Robert, Henry M. Robert III, General Henry M. Robert).  
  
If the executive session occurs on a confe rence call, steps will be taken to ensure that  only the 
appropriate participants are on the call and to invite others to re -join the call only at the conclusion of the 
executive session.  
 
At the conclusion of the closed and executive sessions, all particip ants will re -convene so that the IDMC 
Chair can provide a summary of the IDMC’s recommendations. This process provides an opportunity for 
study investigators to ask questions to clarify the recommendations. The meeting is then adjourned.  
 
Reporting Require ments for the AppyCDS IDMC  
Proper records will be collected at each IDMC meeting to ensure that there is a physical record of any and 
all decisions and recommendations. The required documentation for IDMC meetings for the AppyCDS includes the following:  
38 Appy -CDS Manual of Operations  
Version 19 –Updated February 6, 2018 ; Originated January 2016.  
  
 
  
Initial summary  
The Study Project Manager is responsible for assuring the accuracy and transmission of a brief summary of the IDMC’s discussion and recommendations for the NICHD Project Officer within [ADDRESS_442769] Officer will review this summary and approve/disapprove the 
recommendation(s) or request additional information. The recommendations will then be sent to the 
Study Project Manager and the clinical investigators.  
 
Formal minutes  
The Study Project Manager is responsib le for the accuracy the formal IDMC minutes within 30 days of the 
meeting or call. These minutes are prepared to summarize the key points of the discussion and debate, requests for additional information, response of the investigators to previous recommend ations, and the 
recommendations from the current meeting.  
 Action plan 
If the IDMC’s recommendations require significant changes or follow -up, the Study Project Manager and 
Study Investigators will collaborate to prepare an action plan outlining the steps required to implement 
the recommendations.  
 
Reports of IDMC Proceedings for IRBs  
As Appy -CDS is a multi- center study, this c ommittee may be required to submit reports to IRBs at each of 
the participating sites. The participating sites for this study are ou tlined in T able [ADDRESS_442770] Manager  [EMAIL_6831]

 10) Project Organization and M anagement  
The organizational chart  and project  timeline  are provided  in the budget justif ication  section  of this grant.  
As co-PIs, Drs. Elyse  and Anupam Kharbanda  will co-lead  bi-monthly meetings  of the  research  team  at 
HealthPartners  to ensure  that all necessary  tasks  are completed  in a timely  fashion  and strictly  acco rding 
to study protocol.  Study  teams  from  KPNC  will be invit ed to join these project  meetings  via Web 
confe rence.  Drs. Anupam and Elyse  Kharbanda  will meet  with  KPNC  investigato rs in-person  at least  once  
per year. Because  this project  includ es a stagger ed, 2-stage intervention  (Triage  CDS and full Appy - CDS),  
the development,  implemen tation and reporting  and analysis  phases  overlap.  In Development  or Phase  1 
(Months  0 to 32), the team will develop,  pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268],  and revise  the Appy -CDS (triage  and full) interventions, 
including both the EHR-based  algorithms  to identify  and extract  necess ary data in real time,  and the Web 
service  algorithms  that process  this information  and return  it to the EHR,  where  it is retained  and 
displayed.  In Phase  2 (Months  12 to 50), the Triage  CDS will be implemented  across  the 2 heal th systems 
and run for 12 months.  Subsequentl y, following  randomization,  the full Appy -CDS will be implemented  at 
intervention  sites and contin ue for 24 months.  Phase  3 (Months  27 to 60) includes  import of automated  
data, completion  of chart  reviews,  data analysis,  and reporting of key study  resul ts. This process will begin 
during the course  of the 2-year full intervention  and allows  an additional [ADDRESS_442771] outcomes.  Throughout  the stud y, there will be 
ongoing  analys is of data as they  become available,  and preliminary  report s on the study ’s conceptu al 
models,  intervention  strategies,  and preliminary  and final resul ts will be presented  at meetings  and/or  
reported  in peer -reviewed  articles.  
 
Strengths and Limitations of the Study  
A few limitations  to this study  should  be noted.  First,  unlike our  ongoing work  in hypertension  and 
diabetes,  the recomm endations  embedded  in Appy -CDS are evidence - based  but are not back ed by 
[CONTACT_355451]. This lack of guidelines  should  not be perceived  as a lack of consens us on best  
practices  for this population.  In fact,  surgeons  and ED providers  increasin gly agree  on the value  of risk 
stratificati on and the need to limit  CT for childr en with  acute  abdominal  pain.30,55,57,[ADDRESS_442772] acle by [CONTACT_355452]-site research  assista nts; this approach  is 
neither  feasible  for the current  multisite  study nor scalable for widespread  dissemination.20,21 In the 
current proposa l, we will use data provided  by [CONTACT_355453].  In the developmen t phase,  we will 
monitor  to ensure  that Triage  CDS is neither overly  sensitive  nor over ly specific  and that we are providing 
alerts  for the “right”  group  of patients.  
 These pote ntial limitatio ns should  be weighed  against  the strengths  of this ambitious,  timely  project.  
Namely  we are  proposing  to conduct  a large,  cluster -randomized  trial in [ADDRESS_442773]  developed  
an EHR-linked  CDS that  improved  BP and glucose  control  in type 2 diabet es patients  in a randomized  
trial,
67 and we are currently applying this strategy  to improve  the recognition  of abnormal blood  pressu re

 in adolescents  and to optimize management  for pediatric  patients  with  a head  injury. In the field  of 
appendicitis,  we have developed  and validated  a rule to identify  child ren with  acute abdominal  pain  at 
low risk for appendicitis.  In addition,  we have  successfully  pi[INVESTIGATOR_355388]-linked  time -of-ordering  alert to 
reduce  CT use in 2 large  pediat ric EDs.54 The current  proposal is a natural extension  of our team’s  
subst antial previous  work  and expertise in CDS66,[ADDRESS_442774]  implemen tation  of 
this evidence -based, point -of-care Appy -CDS system.  
a) Purpose of Document  
This document  serves as a reference guide for study operations, contacts, and describes the technical 
details of the study intervention. This document  is to be used by [CONTACT_97663] s (PI), 
Research Assistant s (RA), and/or nursing staff at each participating medical center to ensure that the study 
procedures are followed as uniformly as possible.  It includes details regarding data collection, flow, data entry, recording and encoding of data.  
b) Yearly Medical Center IRB Reviews  
It is standard policy in clinical research that all studies involving human subjects be reviewed at least annually by [CONTACT_4707] (s) for all participating sites .  These reviews are to be done on 
the anniversary of the initial reviews.  Reviews may be conducted more frequently than yearly at the discretion of the various IRBs.  It is the Site Investigators ’ with the help of site project managers or 
coordinators,  and the Institutional Review Boards ’ responsibility to ensure that yearly reviews occur.

 Appendix A: Intervention Design and Workflow at HP 
The Epic triage alert is a best practice advisory (BPA) built in the HP EHR that uses automated data to 
identif y potentially eligible study participants. Data variables include age, chief complaint, pregnancy 
status, and trauma status. If the patient meets the initial study criteria: chief complaint of abdominal pain, age [ADDRESS_442810] no history of trauma, the BPA will display in the ED triage navigator. 
The advisory prompts the user to click a link which will bring them to a flowsheet section form where they are to complete up to 3 questions that further filter eligibility.   
a) Capturing eligibilit y: Epic Triage BPA

 b) Workflow  
For patients that meet the criteria described above, a Best Practice Advisory will display.  
Best Practice Advisory prompting user for additional information.  
 
If the abdominal pain assessment link is clicked, the user will be directed to the event log in the nursing 
narrator section where up to [ADDRESS_442811] question will appear if the answer to either 1 or 2 is yes. No further action is required by [CONTACT_355461].  
 
Event log flowsheet questions  for inclusion/eligibilit y.  
  
Once the flowsheet rows are completed, responses will be stored in Epic. This information will be 
retrieved at a later point for use in the full CDS for calculating appendicitis risk.  
 Additionally, if nurses do not respond to the Appy triage quest ions, a similar alert will fire at provider 
login. The Appy alert will display in the general BPA section of the EHR until the questions are addressed, 
or an acknowledgement reason is selected, as shown below.

c) Full CDS -HP sites  
The Full CDS is a multi- component, automated intervention.  The Full CDS includes a collection of 
additional clinical parameters, including results of the CBC with differential (if available).  The Full CDS assigns an exact “risk for appendicitis” and provides targeted recommendations regarding management.

 At the intervention clinic s, if a patient meets the criteria described under the tr iage section , a BPA will 
display to the provider. The advisory prompts the user to click a link that will bring them to the full CDS 
that includes the risk prediction estimate (pARC score) . 
Best Practice Advisory prompting user to use the Full CDS . 
 
 
Once the link is clicked, the user is redirected to the Appy -CDS application. Below is the illustrated 
workflow.

 Page 4 -Calculated risk of appendicitis using pARC score, summary, and management suggestions.  
 
 
 The summary and management suggestions can be copi[INVESTIGATOR_355405]. If lab data is not available for data extraction at the time the user accesses the CDS, the option to enter a theoretical 
WBC and ANC is available and a pARC score will be calculated based on the theoretical value.  In some 
cases, there may be no data transferred from the EHR. In these instances, the user is able to enter data 
directly into the full CDS and calculate a pARC score.  
 
To account for differences in workflow and the possibility that a provider may order imaging up front  
before utilizing the full CDS tool, there is an alert that displays when abdominal imaging is ordered. The 
imaging alert also includes a link to the full CDS  and suggests to the user that using  the pARC score is 
recommended before imaging .  A screenshot of the imaging BPA is shown below.

a) Capturing eligibility: RISTRA  
The analogous triage alert at KPNC will be implemented using the RISTRA interface existing at KPNC.  For 
patients with a chief complaint of abdominal pain, ED providers will be trained to click on the RISTRA icon 
embedded within the EHR.     
 
RISTRA can be  accessed by [CONTACT_355463].

b) Full CDS -KPNC sites  
Once eligibility is confirmed for the patient the clinician is asked to verify or complete additional variables 
about the patient’s presentation (see below). The infor mation is auto populated into the form, however 
required confirmation of accuracy by [CONTACT_48368]. The Full CDS  at KP also  involves provider gestalt to assign 
calculated risk of appendicitis as a pARC score. It provides targeted recommendations regarding manag ement.  This element of the CDS is unique to KP and will provide additional knowledge to the 
overall study goals . 
 The following diagram illustrates how recommendations are assigned based on the level of provider 
Gestalt. The provider is asked to use their  clinical know ledge and expertise to assign Gestalt.

 RISTRA CDS Provider Gestalt . 
 
Once the clinician has determined a Gestalt score, they are prompted  to use  a sliding curser to mark the 
likelihood of the patient  having appendicitis . The likelihood scale is p resented as a percent ( on a scale of 1-
100). Once the clinician clicks calculate risk the CBC is pulled from the EHR.

Similar to the design at HealthPartners, RISTRA has mechanisms in place for when  the CBC has not been 
com pleted and results are not back. In these cases, the provider will see a form that gives them an option 
to refresh RISTA once the results are indicated in the EHR before they continue the CDS.  The clinician also 
has the option to use a sliding scale to visualize what the  pARC score  might be  using theore tical WBC 
values  (see below).  Once the CBC has resulted  and the provider refreshes the RISTRA form, the provider  
can continue with the CDS to get the actual  calculated  risk of appendicitis .

Provider can also gauge gestalt prior to ordering imaging.

Scientific Abstract   
Although considered a modifiab le risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD) in the 
general population, the magnitude of physical activity required to promote cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_299845] a clinically meaningful change in blood -derived biomarkers of CAD is not 
achievable in those wi th a severe physical disability, such as with immobilizing paralysis from 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828] (SCI).  During the chronic phase of SCI, a characteristic dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_299846], with mean serum high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL -C) concentrations <40 
mg/dl, a threshold level for HDL -C that is appreciated to be an independent risk factor for 
CAD, elevations in triglycerides (TG) to concentrations at, or near, target values for the general 
population that trigger clinical intervention, and low density lipop rotein cholesterol (LDL -C) 
concentrations that are within the normal range.  It should not be a surprise that 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) -related morbidity in persons with SCI occurs earlier in life, at a 
greater prevalence than that of the general popula tion, and is the primary cause of death after 
the first year of injury. Population -based epi[INVESTIGATOR_299847].  Clinical target values used to 
initiate treatment  in the general population may be inappropriate in those with SCI because of 
their unique pathophysiology.  In the absence of significant physical activity and lifestyle 
modifications, it would seem that appropriate pharmaceutical options are needed to pro perly 
manage markers of CVD -related risk in persons with SCI.  To date, there is limited empi[INVESTIGATOR_299848] -lowering treatments in persons with SCI.  
Fenofibrate is a fibric acid derivate that activates peroxisome proliferator -activated 
receptor α and lipoprotein lipase, leading to enhanced elimination of TG from plasma.  In 
clinical trials where fenofibrate was used as a monotherapy, serum TG conce ntrations fell 41 -
53%, very low -density lipoprotein (VLDL) fell 38 -52%, LDL -C decre ased 6 -20%, and H DL-C 
improved by [CONTACT_45848] 20%.  In consideration for the nature of dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_299849]  01-04-[ADDRESS_365997] clinical practice for lipid -lowering 
treatment with fenofibrate monotherapy follows a known and clinically accepted timeline to 
monitor safety and to determine therapeutic effic acy.  It is recommended that, if after 2 months 
of continuous therapy there are no beneficial changes to the lipoprotein profile, that treatment 
be discontinued (i.e., non -responders).  Similarly, several large clinical trials have 
demonst rated that the pe ak therapeutic effects of fenofibrate are observed after 12 -16 weeks of 
treatment (i.e., responders).  The proposed study will test the efficacy of administering 
fenofibrate to persons with SCI, a severely immobilized cohort that does not have established 
clinical practice guidelines to treat dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_299850] a more disease -specific approach for care.  If successful, 
the treatment will reduce clinical markers of CVD -related risk by m odifying the concentration 
and number of particles that are known to contribute to incident cardiac events and mortality.  
It is anticipated that the insight gained from this investigation will provide clinicians with a 
proof -of-concept fo r instituting app ropriate use of lipid lowering agents to treat the 
dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_299851] d escribed in persons with SCI.   
Goals and Objectives  
In individuals with spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828] (SCI):  
Primary Aim :   
1. To determine the efficacy of fenofibra te monotherapy af ter 2 months of treatment to 
improve the lipoprotein profile; a successful response will be defined as a 25% reduction in the 
serum TG concentration at 2 months.  This approach will permit the determination of the 
percent of subjects who s how drug efficacy  (i.e., responders) versus those who are non -
responders after 2 months of treatment, when drug administration will be discontinued if 
therapeutic efficacy is deemed suboptimal.  
 
2. To determine the efficacy of fenofibrate monotherapy to lo wer TG concentrat ion at 4 months 
of treatment, when the peak therapeutic efficacy to drug treatment has been reported to occur.  
Lipid profiles will be performed in the drug responder and control groups.  
 
Secondary Aim : To describe the effects of fenofibra te monotherapy on  lipoprotein particle 
number and size by [CONTACT_299856] -responders 
and responders at 2 months of treatment, when drug treatment will be discontinued for lack of 
efficacy to agent. Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_299852] g roups will be studied by [CONTACT_299857] 4 months of treatment, which will be at the termination of the proposed 
treatment period.

Participant Recruitment  
Potential participants will be recruited in accordance with local regulatory guidelines.  The 
study coordinator will use a variety of methods to approach potential participants, including 
referrals from clinical staff, in -person contact [CONTACT_299859], telephone calls, and placement of 
IRB approved flyers in authorized locations. For those participants who have previously 
signed consent document for a prior study and have requested to be cont acted for future 
research studies, these individuals will be contact[CONTACT_299860]. 
Eligible participants will be enrolled after satisfying study inclusion/exclusion criteria.  To 
offset the level of inconvenience and perceived risk of the study procedures, remuneration in 
the amount of $50 will be provided for successful completion of the screening visit, months 1, 
2, 3 and follow -up;  subjects will receive $[ADDRESS_365998] who completes all study visits will receive $[ADDRESS_365999] adverse TG concentrations (i.e., paraplegia:  
≥135 mg/dl; tetraplegia ≥115 mg/dl).  After a baseline evaluation, a comprehensive medical 
history review and  intake interview will be performed to identify demographic information, 
current health status, medications and lifestyle habits (i.e., smoking, alcohol consumption, 
recreational drug use, physical activity habits, diet etc.).   Twenty subjects with advers e TG 
concentrations will be randomized to receive once daily fenofibrate therapy (i.e., 145 mg) for 4 
months (dispensed by [CONTACT_299861] J. Peters VA Medical Center) and 
the remaining [ADDRESS_366000] does not d emonstrate an improvement of ≥25% in TG 
concentration, then he/she will be discontinued from the study drug under appropriate 
supervision and terminated from the study.  For those who respond to fenofibrate treatment, 
he/she will continue on treatment for an additional 2 months.  
 The primary study outcome will be to determine the efficacy of treatment on the serum 
lipoprotein profile (i.e., TG, HDL -C, LDL -C, total cholesterol), and the secondary study 
Version  01-04-2019                                                                                                   Page 5 of 8                                                                     outcome will be the lipoprotein particle number and size  by [CONTACT_50410] (i.e., HDL, LDL and VLDL 
subfractions). Liver (enzymes: AST, ALT, GGT) and kidney function (i.e., glomerular filtration 
rate) tests, and a complete blood count (CBC) with differential will be performed at all study 
visits, from blood samples, respe ctively, to monitor subject safety (Table 2).  To facilitate our 
understanding of the relationship between metabolic parameters, body composition and 
primary study outcome measurements associated with treatment efficacy, a 2 hour oral 
glucose tolerance tes t, and a total body dual energy x -ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan will be 
performed to quantify total body fat mass and fat -free mass at baseline, as well as to determine 
visceral adipose tissue volume ( enCoreTM software (Lunar iDXA, platform version 13.6,

Procedures  
Safet y Labs : Serum blood specimen will be obtained for the determination of the glomerular 
filtration rate (GFR).  If at screening or during the trial, GFR is <60 ml/min, the potential subject 
will not be eligible to enroll in the study, or if the GFR should fa ll to <60 ml/min during the 
trial, the participant will be discontinued from study drug; re nal function will be monitored 
for a period of at least 4 months after identifying a fall in creatinine clearance while on study 
drug.  Liver function tests [i.e., A ST, ALT (<35 IU/L), GGT (elevated for respective age and 
Version  01-04-2019                                                                                                   Page 6 of 8                                                                     gender)] and complete blood count with differential (CBC with diff) will be obtained and 
evaluated for abnormal values.  If evidence for abnormal liver function (i.e., [ADDRESS_366002] 
deviations above the  upper limit of normal) or infection (white blood cell >10,000 cells/ml), the 
subject will either be considered ineligible for the study at the time of screening or 
discontinued from study drug under appropriate supervision and monitored for a period of at  
least 4 months. These specimens will be processed by  a commercial laboratory at the time o f 
collection  (LabCorp ).  All safety labs will be reviewed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. William A. Bauman (Co -
Investigator and study physician).  He will be responsible for the oversight o f safety 
monitoring, eligibility and review of all laboratory data from screening and treat ment.  
 
Primary Study Outcomes :  Venous blood samples will be obtained after an overnight fast 
(minimum 8 hours) for the determination of lipoprotein concentrations (i.e., HDL -C, LDL -C, 
VLDL -C, TG and total cholesterol) and lipoprotein particle number and size (i.e., mean size of 
HDL, LDL and VLDL particle; the number of HDL, LDL and VLDL for the respective sub -
fraction of small, medium and large particles).  Lipoprot ein concentrations will be processed 
by a commercial laboratory at the time of collection ( LabCorp ).; lipoprotein particle number 
and size will be performed as a fee -for-service by [CONTACT_299862], Inc (Raleigh, NC, [LOCATION_003]).  
 
Additional Outcomes :  To assist in th e stratification of interventional outcomes, all participants 
who enter the study interve ntion (i.e., receive drug  or serve as control ), will provide a blood 
sample at the beginning of the treatment period so that their apolipoprotein E (Ap oE) 
genotype can  be determined by a commercial laboratory as a fee -for-service procedure 
(LabCorp ).  Venous  blood samples will be obtained after an overnight fast (minimum 8 hours) 
for the determination of fasting plasma insulin level and serum glucose concentration at ea ch 
study visit once the trial begins.  For the oral glucose tolerance test, the participant  will drink a 
glucose containing solution (i.e., 75 grams) over a 2-minute  period.   Venous blood will be 
drawn from a catheter at time 0 (same blood sample just des cribed) and 120 minutes later to 
determine plasma glucose and insulin levels.  These outcom es will be monitored for changes 
in glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity that may be associated with fenofibrate treatment.  
The Core Laboratory of the Center o f Excellence for the Medical Consequences of SCI will 
perform the glucose analyses (YSI 230 0 STAT Plus, YSI Life Sciences, Yellow Springs, OH) and 
insulin assay by [CONTACT_299863] o ur laboratory.58  For body composition analysis, subjects will be 
transferred from their wh eelchair to a semi -padded scanner bed, where a DXA total body scan 
will be performed.  To determine fat mass and fat -free mass, the scan will expose subjects to a 
very low dose of radiation (i.e., approximately 1/5th of the radiation for a standard chest x -ray).  
The scan will take no more than 20 minutes to be performed and will only be performed twice 
during the study (Table 2).  Skinfold and Girth Circumference Mea surements : a soft measuring 
tape will be used to measure various circumferences and lengths  of each subject’s body, and a 
Version  01-04-[ADDRESS_366003]’s arms, 
legs, back, and trunk. The total t ime of this procedure will not exceed [ADDRESS_366004] contains potential risks/and 
or discomfort related to study procedures:  
-Fenofibrate:  Common side effects for treatment include abdominal pain, skin rash,  and 
nausea . Less common side effects include gas, bloating, change in bowel frequency and stool 
color.  As mentioned previously participants are at risk to develop elevated and/or abnormal 
liver and kidney function from taking Fenofibrate. If abnormal levels become evide nt as 
indicated by [CONTACT_299864], the subject will be discontinued 
from study drug and monitored on a monthly basis for up to four months or until liver 
function returns to normal. In addition, if the subject develops elev ated and/or abnormal li ver 
function results, they may experience the following: yellowing of eyes/skin, dark urine, 
pruritis, swelling, and headache.  
-Blood draw/catheter placement:  The subject may experience the feeling of being lightheaded, 
dizzy, blur ry eyesight, nausea and/or syncope during the needle/catheter insertion.  There is 
also the potential risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a bruise or infection at the site of skin puncture.  
-Oral glucose tolerance test:  In addition to the listed risks for blood draw/cathe ter placement, 
the ingestion of a large volume of glucose may cause some individuals to experience nausea.  
-Dual energy x -ray absorptiometry scans:  To complete the scan, participants will be asked to 
transfer from their wheelchair to the scanning bed.  Th is will be completed independently or 
with assistance from an overhead patient lift.  The scan will take approximately [ADDRESS_366005] to 8.62 µSv  of radiation (i.e., equivalent to 1/[ADDRESS_366006] x -ray), thus each subject will receive 17.24 µSv for the two scans.  
 
Statistical A nalys es 
Separate a nalys is of variance (ANOVA) w ill be  performed to identify group differenc es 
(i.e., control, treatment ) for baseline demographic data [e.g., age, height, weight, BMI , duration 
of injury (DOI)] .  Pearson c hi-squa re tests  will be  performed to identify differences for the 
number of enrolled participants in each group based on  gende r (e.g., male, female), injury 
level (e.g., paraplegia, tetraplegia), AIS level (e.g., A, B, C), and ethnicity (e.g., African 
American, White, Hispanic).  Separate 2  (group: treatment, control) X 3 (visit : baseline, Mo2, 
Mo4 ) mixed -model repeated measures ANOVA (RMANOVA) will be  performed to determine 
if differences were present for serum lipoprot ein profile [e.g., HDL -C, LDL -C, VLDL -C, TG, 
TC], glucose, insulin, and the TG/HDL -C, LDL -C/HDL -C and TC/HDL -C ratio s. Separate

hoc tests.  Although not part of the primary analysis, results from the venous blood samples at 
months 1 and 3 visits will be  provided.  Statistical analyses will be  comple ted using IBM SPSS 
Statistics 25  (IBM, Armonk,  NY) and figures will be  created with GraphPad Prism (versi on 8.0

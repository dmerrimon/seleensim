Protocol Number: 20210034
Protocol Title: An Open Label, Two-Arm Study in Subjects with Chorioretinal Vascular 
Disease to Evaluate ABP 938 and Aflibercept (Eylea®) in a Prefilled Syringe.
Sponsor: [COMPANY_010] Inc.
Study Phase: Phase 3B
Indication: Chorioretinal vascular disease (CVD)
Study Sites: Approximately 4 sites in the [LOCATION_002] (US).
Rationale: [COMPANY_010] is developi[INVESTIGATOR_286605] 938 as a biosimilar candidate to Eylea® (aflibercept). To 
administer ABP 938 as an intravitreal (IVT) injection, [COMPANY_010] has also developed a prefilled 
syringe (PFS). The study will investigate whether the ABP 938 PFS can be used effectively and 
safely by [CONTACT_869478] t he 2 mg dose of study drug, when descriptively 
compared to the US-licensed aflibercept PFS.
Objectives/Endpoints:
Objectives Endpoints
Primary
The primary objective for this study is to 
assess the ability of retina specialists to 
successfully administer, via an IVT injection,
a 2 mg dose of ABP 938, using the ABP 938 
PFS, compared to a 2 mg dose of aflibercept 
using the aflibercept PFS.The primary endpoint for the study is the proportion of IVT injections successfully 
administered to subjects with CVD by [CONTACT_869479], utilizing the ABP 938 PFS or 
aflibercept PFS.
Secondary
The secondary objective is to assess the safety of ABP 938 administered to subjects with CVD via an IVT injection, using the ABP 
938 PFS compared to aflibercept 
administered using the aflibercept PFS.The secondary endpoint for the study is the incidence of ocular adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) in the 
study eye, and non-ocular SAEs until the 
end of study visit (Day 28 visit).
Study Design: This is an open label, two-arm, randomized, multi-site study within the US in 
adult subjects with CVD, including neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD), 
diabetic macular edema (DME), macular edema following retinal vein occlusion (RVO), or 
diabetic retinopathy (DR). Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_681888].
The study consists of a screening visit (Day -1), a baseline visit (Day 1) and an end of study 
visit (Day 28 ± 7 days). The screening and baseline visit may be combined into one visit (Day 1).

ConfidentialStudy Procedures: After providing informed consen t, subjects will be screened.  After 
screening assessments are completed and if subjec t eligibility is confirmed, the s ubject will be 
enrolled into the study and randomized to either receive a single IVT injection of ABP [ADDRESS_1213271] (IP) (test or reference product) [ADDRESS_1213272] Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) by 
[CONTACT_63365] (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study), slit-lamp biomicroscopy, intraocular pressure (IOP), and indirect ophthalmo scopy and spectral domain- optical coherence 
Tomography (SD-OCT).
Study Duration: The study duration for each subject will be approximately 28 days (± 7 days) 
excluding screening and the study will end for subjects when they complete the end of study 
visit assessments.
The start of the study will be the date on which the first subject provides informed consent, 
and the end of the study will be when the last subject has completed the assessments for the 
end of study visit. Whenever possible, all procedures listed under the end of study visit should be completed for subjects who are prematurely discontinued.
Planned Number of Subjects: Approximately 48 adult male or female subjects with a 
minimum of 32 subjects in the ABP 938 PFS arm and a minimum of 16 subjects in the 
aflibercept PFS arm (randomization ratio 2:1).
Target Population: Subjects aged ≥ 18 years old with treatment-naïve or previously treated
neovascular (wet) AMD, DME, macular edema following RVO, or DR in the study eye, in 
whom treatment (IVT) with aflibercept is indicated.

Confidential1 Introduction and Rationale
1.1 Background
1.1.1 Disease
Chorioretinal vascular disease (CVD) constitutes the most common causes of moderate and 
severe vision loss in developed countries. These commonly include neovascular (wet) 
age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic macular edema (DME), macular edema 
following retinal vein occlusion (RVO), and diabetic retinopathy (DR).(1)
AMD is a leading cause of blindness for people over the age of 65 in the [LOCATION_002] (US). In the neovascular (wet or exudative) form of AMD, choroidal neovascular membranes disrupt 
the normal architecture of retina and adjacent tissues leading to retinal edema, submacular 
hemorrhage, as well as debilitating atrophy and scarring.
(2)
The use of intravitreal (IVT) anti-vascular endothelia l growth factor (VEGF) therapy is currently 
the standard of care for CVD. The anti- VEGF agents inhibit choroidal neovascularization 
growth and fluid leakage, which enable visual improvement.(3)
1.1.[ADDRESS_1213288] Background
[COMPANY_010] is developi[INVESTIGATOR_286605] 938 as a biosimilar candidate to Eylea®(aflibercept). ABP 938
belongs to the pharmacologic class of VEGF inhibitor s and acts as a soluble decoy receptor 
that binds VEGF type A (VEGF-A), placental growth factor (PlGF), and to a lesser extent 
VEGF type B (VEGF-B), and thereby [CONTACT_869482] 1 
(VEGFR1) and VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2).
1.1.3 Nonclinical Studies
A detailed summary of analytical and nonclinical data is provided in the Investigator’s 
Brochure (IB).
1.1.4 Clinical Studies
A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of ABP 938 is 
provided in the IB. A Phase 3 study to assess effectiveness and safety of ABP 938 compared 
to aflibercept in subjects with neovascular (wet) AMD is currently ongoing.
1.1.[ADDRESS_1213289]
Aflibercept belongs to the pharmacologic class of VEGF inhibitors. In the US, it is approved 
for indicated IVT administration in the treatment of neovascular (wet) AMD, macular edema 
following RVO, DME, and DR.(4)In the EU, aflibercept is approved for the treatment of the 
above indications with the exception of DR, and is also approved for the treatment of myopic

ABP 938 PFS can be used effectively and safely by [CONTACT_869483], to administer the 2 mg 
dose of study drug, when descriptively compared to the US-licensed aflibercept PFS.
1.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment
ABP [ADDRESS_1213292], aflibercept, for which the benefit-risk 
profile, following IVT administration for appr oved indications is well unde rstood. A Phase 3 
study to assess effectiveness and safety of ABP 938 compared to aflibercept in subjects with neovascular (wet) AMD is currently ongoing.
The 2 mg dose of both study drugs and administration via PFS in this study is consistent with 
the Eylea
®prescribing information for subjects with CVD.
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits, risks, and reasonably expected AEs of ABP 938 and aflibercept can be found in the ABP 938 IB, and in the Eylea
® 
[LOCATION_002] Prescribing Information (USPI), August 2022, respectively.(4)
Considering the measures taken to minimize risk to subjects participating in this study, the 
potential risks identified in association with ABP 938 are justified by [CONTACT_869484].
[COMPANY_010] closely monitors the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic around the 
world. As part of this effort, [COMPANY_010] performs a rigorous assessment, considering the study 
design, subject safety, public health risk, benefit-risk assessment, as well as the burden on 
country healthcare systems. Decisions are made on a study-by-study and country-by-country 
basis to minimize risk to subjects and avoid undue burden on healthcare facilities.
Subjects who display symptoms consistent with COVID-[ADDRESS_1213293] igator to ensure appropriate care as well as 
documentation and management of study assessments.[COMPANY_010] considers that it is important to continue the proposed development of ABP 938 in this

proportion of IVT injections successfully 
administered to subjects with CVD by 
[CONTACT_869483], utilizing the ABP 938 
PFS or aflibercept PFS.
Secondary
The secondary objective is to assess the safety 
of ABP 938 administered to subjects with CVD via an IVT injection, using the ABP 938 PFS 
compared to aflibercept administered using the 
aflibercept PFS.The secondary endpoint for the study is the incidence of ocular adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events 
(SAEs) in the study eye, and non-ocular

Protocol Number: 20210034
Version and Date: Version 1.0, [ADDRESS_1213296] 2022 Page 21 of 61
ConfidentialAt the screening visit (Day -1), the invest igator will obt ain signed informed c onsent from the 
subject before any study procedures or assessments are performed. Once subject eligibility 
is confirmed the subject will be enrolled into the st udy. At this visit, the subject will undergo 
ocular safety procedures including the Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) scale, intraocular pressure (IOP), slit-lamp biomicroscopy, indirect ophthalmoscopy, and spectral domain 
optical-coherence tomography (SD-OCT).
At the baseline visit (Day 1), the subject will be random ized to receive a single IVT injection 
of either ABP 938 or aflibercept (open label) in a PFS administered by a retina specialist. Only 
one eye will be selected as the study eye. IOP will be measured, and indirect ophthalmoscopy 
will be performed before and after IP administration. The screening and baseline visit may be 
combined into one visit (Day 1).
At the end of study visit (Day 28 ± 7 days), the ocular safety procedures performed at the 
screening visit will be repeated.
AEs will be collected from the signing of the informed consent form (ICF) until the end of study 
visit.
The method of assigning subjects to treatment is discussed in Section 6.2.
No interim analyses are planned.

16. Participation in any interventional clinical study within [ADDRESS_1213303] Enrollment
Before subjects participate in any study-specific assessments/procedures, [COMPANY_010] requires a 
copy of the site’s written IRB approval of the protocol and ICF.
The subject or the subject’s legally acceptable representative must personally sign and date 
the IRB and [COMPANY_010] approved informed consent before the commencement of study-specific 
procedures.
A subject is considered enrolled when the investigator decides that the subject has met all 
eligibility criteria. The investigator is to doc ument the decision and date, in the subject’s 
medical records.
Each subject will receive a unique 11-digit subject identification number obtained from the 
interactive web response system (IXRS). This  will be assigned at t he screening visit before

The number will be used to identify the subject throughout the clinical study and must be used on all study documentation related to that subject. The unique 11-digit subject identification numbers will be assigned in sequential order for each site in the format 934XXXXX###, where “934XXXXX” refers to the site number, and ### refers to the sequential subject ordering as each subject at a site is entered into the IXRS system (i.e., 93412345001). If a subject withdraws from study participation, his/her unique identification number cannot be re-used for another subject. 
The subject identification number must remain constant throughout the entire clinical study 
and must not be changed after initial assignment. This number will be different from the randomization number assigned for the study. 
4.4 Screen Failures 
Screen failures are defined as subjects who consent to participate in the clinical study but who 
do not meet did not meet entrance criteria required for participation and are not subsequently entered in the study. Data for subjects who fail screening will not be collected in the electronic data capture (EDC) system. Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failure) will not be rescreened.

The definition of AEs includes worsening of a pre-existing medical condition. Worsening 
indicates that a pre-existing medical condition (e.g., diabetes, migraine headaches, and gout) 
has increased in severity, frequency, and/or duration, and/or has an association with a 
significantly worse outcome. In the case of worsening of a pre-existing condition, the start 
date of the event is the date when the first signs of worsening were observed. A pre-existing condition that has not worsened during the study or involves an intervention such as elective 
cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while on-study is not considered an AE.
Note: an AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], is
temporally associated with the use of a treatment, combination product, medical device or 
procedure.
[IP_ADDRESS] Events Meeting the Adverse Event Definition
Events that meet the AE definition are as follows:
∀Any abnormal or worsening ocular safety result that is considered clinically significant 
in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator.
∀Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.
∀New conditions det ected or diagnosed after study treatment administration even 
though it may have been present before the start of the study.
∀Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study treatment or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self-harming 
intent. Such overdoses are to be reported regardless of sequelae.
[IP_ADDRESS] Events NOT Meeting the Adverse Event Definition
Events not meeting the AE definition include:
∀Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that 
leads to the procedure is the AE.
∀Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).

∀Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].
∀Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.
∀Congenital anomaly/birth defect.
∀Other medically important serious event.
Definition of Terms
Life-threatening: an AE is life-threatening if the subject was at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred. For example, drug-induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence 
of hepatic failure would not be considered life-threatening even though drug-induced hepatitis 
can be fatal. It does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in 
a more severe form, might have caused death.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]: an AE requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_869473].
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_63805], or for procedures planned prior to the subject providing 
informed consent, or routine clinical procedures that are not the result of an AE (e.g., elective 
surgery for a pre-existing condition that has  not worsened) should not be considered AEs or 
SAEs. If anything untoward is reported during the procedure, that occurrence must be reported as an AE, either 'serious' or 'nonseri ous' according to the usual criteria. An AE would 
meet the criterion of “requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]”, if the event necessitated an admission to a health care facility (e.g., overnight stay). When in doubt as to whether hospi[INVESTIGATOR_869474], the AE should be considered serious. Complications that occur during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_286614]. If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_40030], the event is serious.
Disability/incapacity: an AE is incapacitating or disabling if the experience results in a 
substantial and/or permanent disruption of the subject’s ability to carry out normal life 
functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and 
accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life 
functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.

ConfidentialOther medically important serious event: If an investigator considers an event to be clinically 
important, but it does not meet any of the ser ious criteria, the event could be classified as a 
SAE under the criterion of “other medically important serious event.” Examples of such events could include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias, drug-induced liver injury, 
or events that necessitate an emergency room visit, outpatient surgery, or urgent intervention.
7.1.3 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions
A suspected unexpected serious adverse r eaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) is defined as an untoward and 
unintended response to a IP, which is not lis ted in the applicable produc t information, and 
meets one of the following serious criteria: results in death, is life-threatening, requires 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324], results in persistent or significant

related to the IP.

7.2 Assessment of Adverse Events
7.2.1 Severity
The terms serious and severe are not synonym ous. The general term “severe” is often used 
to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event; the event itself, however, may be of 
relatively minor medical significance (such as a grade 3 headache). This is NOT the same as 
serious, which is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or ability 
to function (see Section 7.1.2 ). A severe AE (classified as grades 3 or 4) does not necessarily 
need to be considered serious. For example, a white blood cell count of 1000/mm3to less 
than 2000/mm3is considered grade 3 (severe) but may not be considered serious.
Seriousness (not intensity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.
The investigator will make an a ssessment of severity for each AE and SAE reported during 
the study using the CTCAE, version 5.0.
7.2.2 Causality
∀The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between the IP and each 
occurrence of an AE/SAE.
∀Relatedness means that there are facts or reasons to support a relationship between the IP and the event.
∀The investigator will use their clinical judgment to determine the relationship.
∀Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relations hip of the event to study treatment 
administration will be considered and investigated.
∀The investigator will also consult the IB and/or Product Information, for marketed 
products, in his/her assessment.
∀For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.
∀There may be situations in which a SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report. Howev er, it is very important that the 
investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial 
transmission of the SAE data.

When an AE or SAE occurs, it is the respons ibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory, and diagnostics reports) related to 
the event.
The investigator must assign the following AE attributes:
∀AE diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or symptoms).
∀Dates of onset and resolution.
∀Severity.
∀Assessment of relatedness to the IP, or devices.
∀Action taken.
The investigator’s clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject should be removed 
from treatment due to an AE. A subject, or subject’s legally acceptable representative, can 
also voluntarily withdraw from treatment due to an AE. If the subject withdraws consent, the 
subject is encouraged to undergo, at a minimum, an end of study assessment.
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all documentation (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11533], 
laboratory reports, and diagnostic reports) related to an AE. Wherever possible, the investigator’s diagnosis, not the individual signs and symptoms, will be documented as the 
AE.

this protocol-required reporting period, the inv estigator will r eport the event to [COMPANY_010] within 
24 hours following the investigator’s knowledge of the event. SAEs reported outside of the protocol-required reporting period will be captured within the safety database as clinical study
cases for the purposes of expedited reporting.
7.5 Method of Detecting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open-ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning of the subject is the preferred method to inquire about AE 
occurrence.
7.[ADDRESS_1213339]’s study participation ends, all related SAEs should be evaluated for resolution.
7.7 Safety Reporting Oversight
In accordance with ICH GCP, [COMPANY_010] (or designee) will inform investigators of “findings that 
could affect adversely the safety of subjects, im pact the conduct of the study, or alter the IRB’s 
approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_43932].”

8.5 Statistical Methods
8.5.1 Primary Endpoint
The primary endpoint of the number of su ccessful IP injections with the PFS will be 
summarized using the FAS based on observed data. The number and percentage of injections 
successfully administered utilizing the PFS will be provided descriptively for separately by 
[CONTACT_21964]. P ercentages will be based upon the number of subjects in the 
FAS for each treatment group. The estimated primary endpoint success rate for each treatment group will be calculated by [CONTACT_869492]’ individual success 
rate. The variance of this estimator will be calculated as:
   ( )=
∑ (    ̅)   

 (    )
where   is the proportion of successfully IVT injections administered for the i-th retina 
specialist and  ̅is the average of proportions of successfully administered IVT injections
across all retina specialists, K is the total number of retina specialists. T-distribution with (K-1) 
degrees of freedom will be used to  calculate any corresponding confidence interval. No formal 
statistical comparisons will be performed between the two treatment groups. Missing data will not be imputed.
8.5.2 Secondary Endpoints
The secondary endpoints of ocular treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious 
TEAEs (TE-SAEs) in the study eye and non-o cular TE-SAEs will be summarized with 
qualitative descriptive statistics for all subjects and separately by [CONTACT_869493].
For each secondary endpoint, the total number of TEAEs and the number and percentages 
of subjects experiencing at leas t one TEAE will be summarized for all subjects and by [CONTACT_492781]. Summar ies will also include the number  and percentages of subjects

authors and [COMPANY_010] staff, as appropriate, as defined in the Publication Charter. Membership 
on the committee (both for investigators and [COMPANY_010] staff) does not guarantee authorship. The 
criteria described below are to be met for every publication.
Authorship of any publications resulting from this study will be determined on the basis of the 
Uniform Requirement for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals International 
Committee of Medical Journal Editors Recommendations for the Conduct of Reporting, 
Editing, and Publications of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals, which states: Authorship 
credit is to be based on: (1) substantial contributions to conception and design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; (2) drafting the article or revising it critically for 
important intellectual content; (3) final approval of the version to be published; and (4) 
agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to 
the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.
Authors need to meet conditions 1, 2, 3, and 4.
When a large, multi-site group has conducted the work, the group is to identify the individuals 
who accept direct responsibility for the manuscript. These individuals must fully meet the 
criteria for authorship defined above. Acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general 
supervision of the research group, alone, does  not justify authorship. All persons designated 
as authors must qualify for authorship, and all those who qualify are to be listed. Each author must have participated sufficiently in the work to take public responsibility for appropriate 
portions of the content. All publications (e.g., manuscripts, abstracts, oral/slide presentations, 
book chapters) based on this study must be submitted to [COMPANY_010] for review. The Clinical Trial 
Agreement among the institution, investigator, and [COMPANY_010] will detail the procedures for, and 
timing of, [COMPANY_010]’s review of publications.
[ADDRESS_1213362] has completed the assessments 
for the end of study visit.
If the study concludes prior to the end of study date originally planned in the protocol (i.e., 
early termination of the study), then the end of study will be the date when the last subject is 
assessed or receives an intervention for evaluation in the study (i.e., last subject last visit).

maternal complication is generally not considered an AE, but still must be reported to 
[COMPANY_010] or its designee as a pregnancy exposure case.
∀If the outcome of the pregnancy meets a criterion for immediate classification as a 
SAE (e.g., female subject experiences a spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or neonatal 
death or there is a fetal or neonatal c ongenital anomaly) the investigator will report the 
event as a SAE.
∀Any SAE occurring as a result of a post-study pregnancy which is considered 
reasonably related to the study treatment by  [CONTACT_1188], will be reported to [COMPANY_010]

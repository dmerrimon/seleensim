The Effect of Mindfulness-Based Stress Re duction on Pain and Function in Persons 
with Knee Osteoarthritis 
 Protocol Version Date: April 3, 2018   
2) Study Aims 
Our goals are to establish feasibility of a controlled trial at UC Davis comparing the 
effects of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reducti on (MBSR) versus online MBSR versus 
an active comparison Health Enhancement Program (HEP) (Aim 1) on measures of 
pain and function in persons with knee osteoarthritis ( OA) (Aim 2), and to collect 
preliminary data on the eff ect of MBSR on serum stress and inflammatory markers 
(Aim 3). This pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] w ill be complete in one year. 
 Specific Aim 1:  To determine the feasibility of enrolling symptomatic knee OA 
patients and performing a non-randomized study comparing MBSR vs online MBSR vs HEP.  Hypotheses 1: It will be possible in the UC Davis Medical System to enroll knee OA 
patients and perform an RCT.  Specific Aim 2:  Compare the effect of MBSR vs online MBSR vs HEP on pain and 
function limitations in knee OA.  Hypothesis 2: Compared with HEP, MBSR  will result in significantly greater 
improvement in pain intensity and function.   Specific Aim 3:  Investigate whether MBSR and on line MBSR result in decreases in 
serum cortisol level or changes in ei cosanoid parameters compared with HEP 
intervention.  Hypothesis 4: MBSR will result in decrease s in serum cortisol level and changes in 
eicosanoid parameters compared with HEP intervention.  
3) Background 
Rationale:  Current treatments for OA and pain in OA all are non-ideal. Non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are associat ed with a high risk of gastrointestinal 
bleeding and cardiovascular events1,2 and are only moderately effective for treating 
pain, while opi[INVESTIGATOR_300697] y carry other risks. There is evidence that interventions 
affecting emotional state may moderate pain  in OA, both in our work and elsewhere3-
5. MBSR6 is a secular program that trains mindfulness meditation for stress reduction 
and to increase emotional regulation skills. Meta-analyses of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have demonstrated reli able clinical efficacy, specifically in the 
reduction of symptoms of stress, depression and anxiety
7. A recent meta-analysis of 
MBIs for non-OA chronic pain patients dete rmined that mindfulness meditation is 
associated with decreases in pain, as we ll as improvement in depression and quality

Page 2 of 13   Revised: February 20, [ADDRESS_367064] and others demonstrating significant changes with  mindfulness training 
9,10; one study of a short-term MBI 
demonstrated reductions over [ADDRESS_367065] on pain and cognitive reappraisal in adults with 
primary anxiety disorders:  In a sample of [ADDRESS_367066] MBSR produced si gnificant decreases in Patient Reported 
Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measures of pain intensity 
(p<.001) and interference (p<.001). This  confirms that MBSR reduces pain 
experience in anxiety disorder patients with  a variety of secondary pain problems.  
 
Description of intervention and comparator: The intervention will be MBSR as 
described above. The online MBSR course will be offered through: http://www.breathworks-mindfulness.org.uk/ mindfulness-for-health. We propose to 
use an active control trai ning, the Health Enhancement Program (HEP), an 
intervention designed to isolate mindful ness as a testable active ingredient
12. HEP and 
MBSR are structurally equivalent, both us ing a group format that meets once a week 
for 2.5  hours for 8 weeks with an “all da y” component  after week 6, plus home 
participation. The content of the HEP intervention meet the following criteria: (1) class activities match MBSR activities as cl osely as possible, (2) activities represent 
valid, active, therapeutic ingredients in th eir own right, and (3) these ingredients do 
not include mindfulness. We will also m easure steroid and oxylipin inflammation 
markers through the UC Davis designated metabolomics core at baseline and end of intervention. 
 
Description of outcome measures: Participants will be asked at each time point to 
complete a validated, widely-used disease-  and joint-specific questionnaire-based 
knee OA symptom evaluation, the Western Ontario and McMaster University 
Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)
13. We will ask participants to record baseline and 
weekly WOMAC pain and function, the num ber of minutes of meditation practice 
and frequency of use of cognitive reapprai sal. To evaluate changes in psychological 
functioning, we will administer a brief batter of self-report que stionnaires that 
measure state emotion, emotion regulation, mindfulness skills, compassion, and pain catastrophizing before the inte rvention, midway and after the final week. For oxylipin 
and steroid profiling, usually [ADDRESS_367067] differences in 
concentrations of these mark ers for MBSR or HEP groups.

Function in Persons with Knee Osteoarthritis  
 
Page 3 of 13   Revised: February 20, 2018  Methodology, selection criteria and recruitment: We will recruit [ADDRESS_367068] month, and radiographi cally confirmed OA structural lesions 
(Kellgren/Lawrence grade ≥ 2); we expect to have  20% dropout, leaving [ADDRESS_367069] inflammatory 
arthritis or avascular necrosis. The C linical Trials arm of our Center for 
Musculoskeletal Health has successfully pa rticipated in and recruited numerous knee 
OA-related trials over a decade, and we are c onfident we will be able to achieve our 
goal. 
 
Data Analysis Approach: Given that the proposed study is a feasibility study with 
very small numbers of participants, we will likely not reach significance for the pain outcomes; however, intention to treat (ITT) an alysis will be undertaken to evaluate 
the effect of MBSR vs. HEP or vs. online MBSR. First we will compare the baseline characteristics using χ
[ADDRESS_367070] squa re regression analyses for differences in 
metabolites that are associated with pain cha nge, in addition to correlation analysis of 
metabolic changes along the different time points of blood withdrawals.  
4) Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria 
We will be enrolling [ADDRESS_367071] symptomatic knee osteoarthritis.  a) Inclusion Criteria 
 Male or female, aged 50-80 years

b) Exclusion criteria  Scheduled to have knee replacement surgery within 6 months from enrollment 
 Rheumatoid arthritis or anot her inflammatory arthritis 
 Known avascular necrosis 
 Failure to comply with run-in proc edures: poor attendance or non-compliant 
with completing the activity 
 Major psychiatric illness, cognitive impairment or alcohol/substance abuse 
 Non-English speaking 
 
PROTOCOL TITLE: The Effect of Mindfulne ss Based Stress Reduction on Pain and 
Function in Persons with Knee Osteoarthritis  
 
Page 4 of 13   Revised: February 20, 2018  Participants will be recruited by [CONTACT_300708], UC Davis Orthopaedic 
Surgery clinics, UC Davis Rheumatology Clin ics, UC Davis primary care clinics, and 
local Sacramento and Davis senior community.  We will exclude the following special populations: adults unable to consent, individuals who are not yet adults, pregnant women, pr isoners, and any UC Davis 
staff directly under the oversight of the Principle Investigators. 
 
5) Study Timelines 
The duration of an individual subject’s participation in the study will be at least [ADDRESS_367072]’s participation. However long the subject’s pa rticipation, they are only 
expected to complete 2 in-clinic visits a nd 8 weeks of class (plus 1 all-day class for 
MBSR).  Visits to the clinic may last from [ADDRESS_367073] enrollment to occur over the cour se of 6 months. Final data collection is 
anticipated at 15 months.  
6) Study Endpoints 
Anticipated results, interpretation and pi[INVESTIGATOR_30207]: We anticipate success in the 
feasibility Aim, and also that, compared with HEP, MBSR will result in greater improvement in pain and function in persons  with knee OA. If this test study finds a 
positive feasibility result, we intend to pro ceed with a formal NIH clinical trial to 
establish the basis for introduction of  MBSR practice into the standard 
armamentarium of knee OA treatment, as a primary or adjunct treatment. A negative result would also be important. If we have problems recruiting or bringing participants through the inte rvention, it will allow us to  refine our approaches. 
Finally, a completely negative result with regard to pain and function here would 
have a critically important impact as well.  MBSR is gaining significant attention in 
medicine as a potentially valuable clini cal and research tool for pain and other 
conditions. If we find no association with im portant clinical outcomes in the fastest 
PROTOCOL TITLE: The Effect of Mindfulne ss Based Stress Reduction on Pain and 
Function in Persons with Knee Osteoarthritis  
 
Page 5 of 13   Revised: February 20, 2018  growing major painful health condition ( OA), it would necessarily begin a critical 
discussion regarding the value of MBSR in the treatment of knee OA, as well as in 
other pain conditions.  
 
7) Procedures Involved 
The study will consist of two in-person clin ic visits and the 8-week MBSR or HEP 
course. 
 
Visit 1: Screening/Baseline (Clinic) 
The following procedures will be performed: 
1. Informed consent 
2. Demographics (including age, sex, race, religious affiliation) 
3. Tobacco smoking status 
4. Vital signs (heart rate) 
5. Height, weight, BMI 
6. Medical/surgical history in cluding history of preg nancies if applicable 
7. Concomitant medication review 
8. Inclusion/exclusion review 
9. Blood draw (about 1.5 ml for oxylipin, cort isol, and other metabolite analyses 
with any leftover specimens banked for fu ture use, 3 ml for CRP and 3 ml for 
ESR) 
10. Saliva collection (about 1ml for cortisol an alysis with the any leftover specimens 
banked for future use) 
11. Surveys: Western Ontario and McMaster  Universities Osteoarthritis Index 
(WOMAC), Emotion Regulation Questionn aire (ERQ), Five Facet Mindfulness 
Questionnaire (FFMQ), Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) 
 
Weeks 1 through 8 (MBSR or HEP course) 
After the participant is verified as eligible  to be enrolled and as completed all pre-
treatment (i.e., baseline) assessments, they will be assigned to either the in-person 
MBSR course, the online MBSR course or the in-person group HEP course. 
 
MBSR & HEP Courses 
The weekly in-person HEP courses will be held at UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento. The in-person MBSR course s have three locations: UCDMC, Sutter 
Health University in Sacramento, and Davis Holistic Health Center in Davis. Weekly classes will consist of didactic content, guided experiential med itation exercises, and 
group discussion. Additionally, the MBSR c ourse will have an all-day class on a 
weekend day to be completed between Weeks [ADDRESS_367074]’s 
choosing and will also consist of training in mindfulness meditation and mindfulness 
exercises. Training takes place twi ce per day, 10 minutes per session.

8) Data and/or Specimen Management and Confidentiality 
We will implement a mixed model to examine the effect of treatment (MBSR vs 
online MBSR vs HEP) on changes in pain  and psychological functioning from pre, 
weekly during treatment, post- treatment to 2-week follow-up. Because this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_300698] [ADDRESS_367076] protected and encr ypted spreadsheets. Blood samples will be 
stored in sub-zero freezers at the Center for Musculoskeletal Disorders at UC Davis medical Center in locked research labs and linked only to identification numbers (no 
names). All data will be stored for at least 7 years. All research personnel will 
complete HIPAA and confidentiality training.

Function in Persons with Knee Osteoarthritis  
 
Page 7 of 13   Revised: February 20, 2018   
9) Data and/or Specimen Banking 
Left over blood or saliva samples will be banked for future use. At the end of the 
study, the key that links the samples to th e subjects will be destroyed. All samples 
will be stored without identifiers. As this  is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we may develop novel ideas 
in the future as it relates to this study and may want to conduct additional analyses. 
The samples will be stored indefinitely in a controlled-accessed location. We do not 
intend to share these samples out side of the research group. 
 
10) Provisions to Monitor the Data to  Ensure the Safety of Subjects 
There will be continuous safety surve illance with emphasis on the potential side 
effects of each intervention, as detailed below. Partic ipation in the study will be 
discontinued if the subject fails to adhere  to the study requirements in a way that 
may cause harm to him or herself or seriously interfere with the validity of the study results; or the investig ator determines that furt her participation would be 
detrimental to the subject’s health or well-being. Subjects who are injured as a 
result of being in this study will have treatment available. The costs of such 
treatments may be covered by [CONTACT_300710] a number of factors.  
 
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP):  The Data and Safety Monitoring 
Plan for the proposed project incorporates  the policies on human subject data and 
safety monitoring specified by [CONTACT_247839]. Since this is not a NIH-defined Phase III Clinical Trial and it is a low risk trial at a single site, a formal Internal and External Review Board is not requi red, and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_300699]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_300700]/Data Manager (post-doctoral fell ow) to review issues of data quality 
or other issues that might arise. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_300701].  
 
PROTOCOL TITLE: The Effect of Mindfulne ss Based Stress Reduction on Pain and 
Function in Persons with Knee Osteoarthritis  
 
Page 8 of 13   Revised: February 20, 2018  1. Risk assessment – minimal risk: This study represents a minimal risk to 
study participants since it is a behavior al intervention study  and prior studies 
with mindfulness meditation (MBSR) have not demonstrated the occurrence of serious adverse events. 
 
2. Description of adverse event grading and anticipated adverse events:  An 
adverse event (AE) is here defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, 
symptom, injury or disease temporaril y associated with an intervention or 
procedure, regardless of whether it is c onsidered related to an intervention or 
procedure that occurs duri ng the course of the study. There is a minimal risk 
of an unfavorable psychol ogical event, which has ge nerally not been observed 
in other trials of MBSR. Th erefore, the likelihood and seriousness of this risk 
is small. 
 
3. Description of monitoring study pr ogress and safety of human subject 
participants: The principal investigator, Ba rton L. Wise, MD, MSc, FACP, 
has primary responsibility for the ove rall conduct of the study and for the 
safety of participating human subjects.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_67416] (1) the 
informed consent process is conducted appropriately and that informed consent is obtained prior to proceedi ng with any study proc edures; (2) only 
eligible subjects, per protocol eligibility  criteria, are enrolle d in the study; (3) 
data are collected and analyzed per protocol requirements; (4) procedures are implemented to ensure that the project is consistently monitored for possible 
adverse events; (5) adverse events ar e reviewed promptly and reported as 
required to the IRB; (6) the privacy and confidentiality of study subjects is maintained. Monitoring for adverse events will occur in real time at the single site, and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_300702]. When an event occurs, the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_300703]; serious adverse even ts or reportable new information will 
be reported to the IRB following local guidelines If events are minor or 
unrelated, they will be collected and reviewed on a yearly basis to examine for unforeseen patterns. While implementati on of aspects of the DSMP may be 
delegated to members of the research team, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_300704] e safety of study participants. The PI, 
[CONTACT_300715], has served in the past as designated safety officer for multiple NIH/NIAMS sponsored clin ical trials, and thus has significant experience 
with the process and with consider ation of potential adverse events. 
 
11) Withdrawal of Subjects 
The study doctor or the IRB can remove subject from the research study without 
their approval. The study doctor may stop subjects’ participa tion in the study at 
any time for any reason if, in his/her judg ment, continuation of study is not in the 
subject’s best interest. Possible reas ons for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_300705]: 
 
PROTOCOL TITLE: The Effect of Mindfulne ss Based Stress Reduction on Pain and 
Function in Persons with Knee Osteoarthritis  
 
Page 9 of 13   Revised: February 20, 2018   Subject does not meet study requirements 
 Subject does not follow the study instructions given by [CONTACT_300711]; 
 Subject does not show up for scheduled visits; 
 The study doctor determines that it is not in the best interest of the subject to 
continue in the study; 
 Administrative reasons 
 
12) Risks to Subjects 
Possible risks/inconveniences to subjects include: 1. Venipuncture: Pain, bruising, or infe ction at the site of blood draw. 
2. Loss of confidentiality: Part icipation in research can  involve loss of privacy. 
Research records will be kept confidential to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_2371]. Subjects will be identified by a code, and personal information from records 
will not be released without writ ten permission. Subjects will not be 
personally identified in any publication about the study. 
3. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Training (MBSR): There is minimal risk associated with participating in the MBSR intervention. If we or our contracted trainer observes any evidence of significant depression we will refer the participant to psychological services. 
4. Health Enhancement Program (HEP): Ther e is minimal risk associated with 
participation in the HEP alternate inte rvention. The only potential risks are the 
same as attending a series of sit down lectures. If we obs erve any unusual or 
unforeseen behavior, we will refer the participant to psychological services. 
 
13) Potential Benefits to Subjects 
There is no guaranteed benefit to subj ects who participate in this study. The 
benefits of participation in this study include social partic ipation in a group 
activity and the opportun ity to contribute to scientif ic understanding that may lead 
to treatment for an unmet health need. The information gathered in this study will be very important in learning whether targeted MBSR can improve pain or 
function in osteoarthritis. Improvement in  pain or function could promote health 
and improved social partic ipation in older adults.

18) Provisions to Protect the Pr ivacy Interests of Subjects 
Subject’s personal and medical information will be kept confidential. Each 
subject will be given a subject identifica tion number that will be used throughout 
the study on any source documents, blood samples or other study materials.  
In addition to signing a consent form s ubjects will also be signing a HIPAA 
release form, which allows the study t eam to access subject UCD medical records 
for research purposes only. On the HIPAA fo rm subjects can select what parts of 
their medical history they are giving us permission to access. 
 
During the consent process subjects will be provided with an explanation regarding how we plan on protecting thei r privacy by [CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_300706].   Only trained study staff will have access to study records, which will be stored in 
a locked cabinet in a secure building. 
 
19) Compensation for Rese arch-Related Injury 
Subjects will be provided with contact [CONTACT_300712]. If a subject is 
injured as a result of being in this study, the University of [LOCATION_004] will provide 
necessary medical treatment. Depending on the circumstances, the costs of the 
treatment may be covered by [CONTACT_300713]’s 
insurance company just like other medical costs. The University does not 
normally provide any other form of compensation for injury. 
 
20) Economic Burden to Subjects 
The investigator is paying for all study procedures and subjects will receive 
compensation for participating in the study;  therefore there will not be any costs 
that the subjects will be res ponsible for related to their participation in this study.

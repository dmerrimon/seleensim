 1. SYNOPSIS 
TITLE:   A Phase 2  Multi -center, Open -label Study of Oral ENMD -2076 for the Treatment of Patients with 
Advanced Fibrolamellar Carcinoma (FLC)  
INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT:  ENMD -2076 
INDICATION:   Fibrolamella r Carcinoma  
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT:   II 
INVESTIGATIONAL SITES/LOCATIONS:   Multi -centers,  a list of investigators and affiliated investigational 
sites/locations is maintained in the trial master file  
OBJECTIVES:    
Primary Objective :  
• To determine the Overall Response Rate (ORR) using RECIST  v 1.1 criteria when patients with advanced 
fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) are treated with daily oral ENMD -2076 
Secondary Objectives:  
• To evaluate the 6-month Progression F ree Survival (PFS6) rate when patients with FLC are treated with daily 
oral ENMD -2076.  
• To evaluate the median Progression Free Survival (PFS) , Time to Progression  (TTP) , and Overall Survival 
(OS).  
• To determine the safety of ENMD -2076 as defined by [CONTACT_828512] o ral ENMD -2076.  
• To explore biomarkers predictive of tumor response to ENMD -2076 in FLC patients. 
 
STUDY DESIGN:   This is a Phase [ADDRESS_1149533] v 1.1 criteria . Secondary endpoints will include 6-month 
progression free survival rate, median PFS , TTP, and OS and the evaluation of safety.  
Patients will be given  an oral, daily dose of ENMD -2076 based on body surface area . In case of adverse events , 
two dose  reductions at the discretion of the investigator will be allowed for each patient .  If adverse events 
resolve, the dose can be increased in 50 mg increments as tolerated.   Dosing interruptions/delays will be allowed 
at the discretion of the investigator for recovery from adverse events or inter -current illness, particularly if the 
patient is benefiting from therapy with ENMD -2076.  After a treatment interruption for adverse events , treatment 
can be resumed at a lower dose and increased in 50 mg increments  as tolerated.  
Tumor measurements will occur every two months (± 1 week) after initial study drug administration. The overall 
response rate will be determined based on RECIST v 1.[ADDRESS_1149534] 1.1 criteria after two cycles of treatment ..  The purpose of the interim analysis is to determine 
whether it is futile to continue the study .

events will be graded using the NCI CTCAE version 4.0 and recorded in the CRF.  Specific safety assessments include the following:  
 
• Treatment -emergent AEs graded accord ing to NCI CTCAE  v4. The frequency and severity of AEs will be 
evaluated following administration of oral ENMD -2076 
• Change  from Baseline  in vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and body temperature)  
• Change  from Baseline  in clinical laboratory tests from values obtained prior to treatment  
• Change  from Baseline  in electrocardiograms (ECGs)  
 
Serious adverse events require expedited reporting to the medical monitor as described in the protocol . 
 
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:    
We have designed th is study using a Simon’s Optimal two -stage design to allow for an early interim analysis to 
determine potential futility and an overall final analysis with criteria established to allow for sufficient power and 
type 1 error rate to provide results to suppo rt this Phase 2 trial.  The null hypothesis that the true response rate is 
2% will be tested against a one -sided alternative  that the true response rate is 15% . In the first stage, [ADDRESS_1149544] 1.1 criteria after two cycles of treatment. If  there are 
zero responses in these 16 patients, the study will be stopped. Otherwise, 13 additional patients will be accrued for a total of 29. The null hypothesis will be rejected if 2 or more responses are observ ed in 29 patients. This 
design yields a type I error rate of 9.4%  and power of 90% when the true response rate is 15%. The probability of 
early termination due to drug inefficacy is 72%.

4. INTRODUCTION  
4.1 Background 
Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is a rare malignant neoplasm of the liver. It has distinct clinical, 
histological and prognostic features from conventional hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It 
generally occurs in young individuals and is typi[INVESTIGATOR_828504].  FLC represents 0.6% to 8.6% of all hepatocellular carcinomas, according to 1986 to 1999 SEER data and various international series (El Serag et al., 2004; Sooklim et al., 2003; Moreno-Luna et al., 2005).
 
 FLC is often advanced when diagnosed due to lack of symptoms (Yen and Chang 2009). 
Surgical resections are the optimal treatment for localized tumors, FLC has a very high recurrence rate. In cases of postoperative recurrence, resection is not often possible. As the tumor is quite rare, there is no standard first line systemic treatment option available. The survival rate 
for FLC largely depends on whether (and to what degree) the cancer has metastasized, i.e. spread to the lymph nodes or other organs (Ang et al., 2006). Overall prognosis remains poor, because 
of its primary chemo resistance and early recurrence of metastasis. The absence of treatment 
options highlights the need for new compounds with activity in this patient population. Tumor growth relies on angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vascular 
beds, in order to receive an adequate supply of oxygen and nutrients (Semela and Dufour, 2004). 
Inhibition of angiogenesis may represent a therapeutic option in the treatment of FLC.  Recent clinical genomic research published in Science (Honeyman et al., 2014) reported the 
identification of a recurrent DNAJB1-PRKACA chimeric transcript that is expressed in 100% of 
FLC tumor tissue examined but not in adjacent normal liver, suggesting that this genetic alteration contributes to tumor pathogenesis of FLC. The chimeric RNA is predicted to code for 
a protein that is the catalytic domain of protein kinase A, which results in Aurora A kinase being 
overly expressed in FLC patients. Aurora kinases A, an important regulator in the cell 
proliferation process and often over-expressed in human cancers, is therefore believed to be a promising therapeutic target for FLC.   
 
VEGF is one of the main inducers of liver tumor angiogenesis. Increased levels of VEGF have been observed in HCC. Hepatoma cells are believed to possess a proliferation mechanism regulated by [CONTACT_828517], a paracrine mechanism, or both, which are mediated by 
[CONTACT_9266]-1/FGFR or FGF-2/FGFR (or both). In addition, a gain of FGF-R2 (IIIb), -R2 (IIIc), and -R3 
(IIIb) may be associated with malignant transformation of liver tumor and may eventually serve 
as useful diagnostic and prognostic indicators (Asada et al., 2003).  
4.[ADDRESS_1149552] the mitotic kinase Aurora A, as well as kinases involved in 
angiogenesis (VEGFRs, fibroblast growth factor receptors-FGFRs) and cell growth (Src).  
 In pre-clinical in vivo animal model studies, ENMD-[ADDRESS_1149553] cancer cell lines with minimal toxicity.   
In a pre-clinical study using three different human HCC cell lines, (SMMC-7721, QGY-7703 
and HepG 2) were used to establish the tumor xenograft models in nude mice. After the inoculated tumors grew to more than 100 mm
3, mice were randomly assigned into one of the 
groups receiving vehicle, sorafenib, ENMD-2076 alone or in combination with chemotherapy agents, including doxorubicin or 5-FU, respectively, for 20 days. After commencing 
administration, dynamic measurement was performed every 3 days to determine the tumor sizes 
and body weights of the tumor-bearing mouse to assess tumor growth inhibition and adverse effects. In the SMMC-7721, QGY-7703 and HepG 2 xenograft models, ENMD-2076 induced tumor growth inhibition significantly greater (P<0.01 in all three models) than that of sorafenib.  The tumor growth inhibition rates in the ENMD-2076 treated groups were also significantly 
higher (P<0.01 in all three models) than those seen in the groups treated with doxorubicin and [ADDRESS_1149554] failed or relapsed from other systemic treatment such as sorafenib, doxorubicin or 5 FU.  In clinical studies, clinical benefit has been observed with partial responses in one FLC patient, 
who relapsed from multiple treatments including TACE/doxorubicin, TACE/cisplatin, liver 
transplantation, and sorafenib. The patient was on ENMD-[ADDRESS_1149555] line systemic options available and few clinical trials currently under 
going to explore treatment of anti-angiogenic agents in FLC ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  The absence of current first line treatment options and the current anti-angiogenic clinical trial landscape make ENMD-2076 a viable candidate to potentially fill a currently unmet medical need in the treatment of FLC. 
 
In order to address the urgency of the needs, FDA encourage studies of drugs or biological 
products for diseases that are life-threatening or severely debilitating in pediatric patients and 
that lack adequate therapy could begin earlier than studies of other products, despi[INVESTIGATOR_828505]. (FDA Guidance for Industry: How to Comply with

Confidential    15 of 50 • To explore biomarkers predictive of tumor response to ENMD-[ADDRESS_1149558] criteria (version 1.1) as defined in Appendix C will be used to evaluate 
response. Response will be evaluated after every two cycles of treatment. Complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD) will be defined as outlined in the revised RECIST criteria, Appendix C and Section 6.3. SD is defined if the disease is stable on two measurements or longer, i.e. 4 treatment cycles or longer. Progression free 
survival (PFS) is defined as the time from the first day of treatment to the first observation of 
disease progression or death due to any cause or last follow-up. PFS will be censored for patients who are alive and free of progression at the time of last follow-up. Duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented 
(taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded on study). 
Patients who are removed from the study for reasons other than documented PD will be followed at 2 month intervals until study endpoint. 
6. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
6.1 Overall Study Design and Plan – Description 
This is a Phase 2 multi-center, open label study in 29 FLC patients.  Patients will receive a daily oral dose (fasting) of ENMD-2076 as a single treatment agent. The starting dose will be based on 
body surface area.  If adverse events, two dose reductions at the discretion of the investigator 
will be allowed for each patient. If adverse events resolve, the dose can be increased in 50 mg 
increments as tolerated.  Dosing interruptions/delays will be allowed at the discretion of the 
investigator for recovery from adverse events or inter-current illness, particularly if the patient is 
benefiting from ENMD-[ADDRESS_1149559] dose of ENMD-2076. Each cycle of 
treatment consists of a 4-week treatment period. Patients who complete the initial cycle of 
therapy (4 weeks of treatment) without evidence of significant toxicity or clinical evidence of progressive disease may receive additional 4-week cycles of treatment.   Patients who discontinue therapy for any reason other than progression will continue to receive imaging until progression or death.  All recruited subjects will be followed for safety and overall 
survival.

Group(s)  
The primary objective of this trial is to determine the overall response rate using RECIST v 1.1 
criteria when patients with advanced fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) are treated with daily oral 
ENMD-2076. Since there is no standard therapy approved to treat patients with FLC, it is appropriate for this evaluation to be conducted as a single arm, open label, non-controlled study.    The interim analysis with the initial [ADDRESS_1149560] meet the following inclusion criteria: 
1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced not amenable to curative resection 
fibrolamellar carcinoma.  
a) This review will be conducted by a pathologist at the participating site to confirm the 
diagnosis. If there is a discrepancy, a review of a different archived specimen if available (heterogeneity is common) and/or identify a liver pathologist at another site 
who can provide independent review. 
b) Archived specimens will be collected for subsequent immunohistochemistry, genomic analysis, and possibly other research. 
2. All forms of prior local therapy are allowed as long as patients have either a target lesion which has not been treated with local therapy and/or the target lesion(s) within the field of 
the local-regional therapy that has shown an increase of ≥ 20% in size. Local-regional 
therapy must be completed at least [ADDRESS_1149561] 18 years of age. Patients aged at 12~18 years may be recruited  but only at the site principle investigator's request and subject 
to IRB approval 
7. Have clinically acceptable laboratory screening results within certain limits specified below: 
• AST and ALT ≤ 5 times upper limit of normal (ULN)

6.3.3 Removal of Subjects from Therapy or Assessment 
The Investigator or the Sponsor may discontinue individual patients from the study at any time.  Patients will be encouraged to complete the study; however, they may voluntarily withdraw at any time.  The Investigator or designee will document the reason for discontinuation. Patients 
who went off therapy without evidence of disease progression will have CT scans every two 
months until disease progression or death. 
A patient will be withdrawn from treatment for the following reasons: 
• Significant adverse event: 
If a patient suffers an AE that, in the judgment of the Investigator, the Sponsor, or the 
Medical Monitor, presents an unacceptable consequence or risk to the patient, whether or 
not the AE is considered related to study medication, the patient will be withdrawn from 
treatment. 
• Pregnancy 
If a female patient becomes pregnant at any time during the study, she will be 
discontinued from further participation and treatment.  See Section 8.3.7 for further 
information on recording and follow-up of pregnancies.

baseline within 14-21 days then restart 
dosing at a dose level -2 (150mg/day) 
Third Occurrence • Discontinue study medication. 
• If patient is benefiting from therapy, 
discuss with PI. 
 
Each cycle of treatment consists of a 4-week treatment period. Patients who complete the initial cycle of therapy (4 weeks of treatment) without evidence of significant toxicity or clinical evidence of progressive disease may receive additional 4-week cycles of treatment.  If any individual patient develops ≥ 2+ proteinuria on qualitative assessment of protein on 
urinalysis, then a spot urine protein:creatinine ratio will be obtained, and a 24-hour urine collection will be obtained for quantification.  If the spot protein:creatinine ratio remains equal to 
or below 1, then patients may continue to receive study drug until the 24-hour urine collection is complete (no longer than one week is allowed).  If 24-hour urine shows greater than 3.5 g protein/24 hours then study drug will be held until the a repeat study shows a 24-hour urine

Information regarding study medication administration and compliance will be recorded in the 
CRF.  A patient may refuse to take study drug or withdraw consent from further participation in the study at any time.  Study site personnel will establish patient compliance with the study 
procedures and dosing at each visit. 
7.10 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
All prescription and non prescription concomitant medications should be recorded on the 
appropriate page of the electronic case report form (eCRF).  
 
The in vitro studies implicate the involvement of cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP3A4 in the pathways involved in the metabolism of ENMD-2076.  No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been completed with ENMD-[ADDRESS_1149572] in Appendix D will 
be excluded from enrolling in the study.  Patients who require such an agent during participation in the study may be allowed to continue if the following apply: they have stable or responding disease (as confirmed by [CONTACT_737]); no alternative treatment is available; and they have close clinical monitoring while they are enrolled in the clinical trial.  
Grapefruit juice is also a well-known inhibitor of CYP3A4 and should not be consumed during 
participation in the trial.  Concomitant treatment, in therapeutic doses, with anticoagulants such as warfarin or warfarin-related agents, heparin, thrombin or Factor Xa inhibitors, or antiplatelet agents (eg, clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]) 
are not allowed. Low dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (≤ 81 mg/day), low-dose warfarin (≤ 1 mg/day), and 
prophylactic low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are permitted. 
 Radioembolization is not allowed but will allow palliative radiation.  
Any other medication which is considered necessary for the patient’s welfare, and which is not 
expected to interfere with the evaluation of the study drug, may be given at the discretion of the Investigator.    No other investigational agents are permitted during the entire duration of treatment with study 
drug.

Tumor responses in patients will be determined by [CONTACT_828524] (version 1.1) defined 
in Appendix C.  In the absence of significant treatment-related toxicity or clinical evidence of 
progressive disease, patients will be allowed to continue on 4-week cycles of ENMD-2076.  The 
frequency and timing of the assessment of tumor burden/clinical benefit are described in Table 4.  
Unscheduled benefit assessments may be conducted when clinically indicated during the study. 
•  
8.2.2 Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease and Response 
Guidelines for evaluation of measurable disease and response are outlined in Section 4 of Appendix C.  
The same modality of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up.  Imaging-based evaluation should always be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
Details regarding method of assessment (i.e., CT scan) are outlined in Section 3.2.2 of Appendix 
C. 
8.3 Safety Variables  
Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_828514].  
All adverse events will be graded using the NCI CTCAE version 4.0 and recorded in the CRF.   
Specific safety assessments include the following: 
• Treatment emergent AEs graded according to NCI CTCAE v4. The frequency and 
severity of AEs will be evaluated following administration of oral ENMD-2076

includes adverse events commonly observed and adverse events anticipated based on the pharmacological effect of the study medication.  Any new laboratory abnormality assessed as clinically significant by [CONTACT_795626].   
A treatment emergent adverse event is any adverse event occurring after start of study 
medication and within the time of residual drug effect, or a pre-treatment adverse event or pre-existing medical condition that worsens in intensity after start of study medication and within the time of residual drug effect.   
Adverse events should be recorded as diagnoses, if available. If not, separate sign(s) and 
symptom(s) are recorded. One diagnosis/symptom should be entered per record.   Note that death is not an event, but the cause of death is. An exception is the event of sudden death of unknown cause. Note that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_162809]; however, the reason for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2138]. Procedures are not events; the reasons for conducting the procedures are. In 
general, only the reason for conducting the procedure will be captured as an adverse event. 
However, if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_737], a procedure can be captured along with the reason for conducting the procedure.  An overdose or medication error is not an adverse event unless it is temporally associated with 
an unfavourable or unintended sign or symptom.   
 Each AE is to be classified by [CONTACT_733805]-serious.  A serious adverse event  (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that occurs at any dose:   
• Results in death 
• Is life-threatening (i.e., an immediate risk of death) 
• Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
• Is associated with a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Is an important medical event 
 
[ADDRESS_1149579]’s safety or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  Serious adverse events also include any other event that the investigator or sponsor judges to be 
serious or which is defined as serious by [CONTACT_61462]. 
 The investigator is to report all directly observed adverse events and all adverse events spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_283007].  In addition, each trial subject will be questioned about adverse events.  The question asked will be “Since you 
began taking the study medication, have you had any health problems?” 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to assess the clinical significance of all abnormal 
laboratory values. The Investigator will exercise medical judgment in deciding whether abnormal laboratory values are clinically significant and represent AEs.  In some cases, significant changes 
within the range of normal will require similar judgment by [CONTACT_737]. 
 If an abnormal laboratory value or assessment is clearly related to a medically defined diagnosis or syndrome, the diagnosis or syndrome will be recorded on the AE page, not the individual laboratory values.  Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values should not be listed on the 
AE page of the eCRF, unless clinical signs or symptoms are present.  
 All clinically significant abnormal laboratory results or assessments will be followed until they return to normal or become stabilized (up to 30 days after end of study drug administration). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Procedures for Assessing, Recording, and Reporting Adverse Events 
and Serious Adverse Events 
Throughout the duration of the study, the Investigator will closely monitor each subject for 
evidence of drug intolerance and for the development of clinical or laboratory evidence of adverse events.  All adverse events (expected or unexpected) which occur during the course of the study, whether observed by [CONTACT_162837], and whether or not thought to 
be drug-related, will be reported and followed until resolution or until they become stable. 
The Investigator will evaluate AEs according to the following guidelines: 
• NCI CTCAE Version 4.0.  The Investigator must assign a CTC Grade for each AE 
(Appendix A) 
• Description of event (if the event consists of a cluster of signs and symptoms, a diagnosis 
must be recorded [e.g., flu syndrome] rather than each sign and symptom)

Confidential    29 of 50 • Onset Date  
• Stop Date  
• Seriousness (see definition of SAEs, Section [IP_ADDRESS])  
The Investigator must record whether or not the AE meets the definition of serious.  If the 
event is serious, the Investigator must complete a Serious Adverse Event report form (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  CASI Pharmaceuticals or designee will monitor the completeness and 
accuracy of these forms. 
• Relationship to Study Medication 
The Investigator must assess the relationship between the AE and the study medication as 
either not related or having a possible, probable, or definite relationship to the study 
medication.  
• Outcome 
Outcome of AEs should be recorded based on the status of the AE at discontinuation from 
the study (includes [ADDRESS_1149580] dose) as resolved, resolved with sequelae, ongoing or 
death.  If an AE is not resolved at the time of discontinuation, the AE should be followed until resolution (return to normal or baseline values) or until judged by [CONTACT_39982]. 
• Action Taken (None, AE Required Treatment, Temporarily Interrupted or Permanent 
Discontinuation of Study Medication) 
• Patient Status (i.e., Was patient prematurely discontinued due to AE?) 
Events will be coded into one of the following causality categories as defined below: 
Category Definition 
Unrelated Clearly and incontrovertibly due only to extraneous causes, and does 
not meet criteria listed under possible or probable. 
Unlikely Does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration. 
May have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or by 
[CONTACT_162839][INVESTIGATOR_191293]. 
Possible Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration, but 
may have been also produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state, 
environmental factors or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_191293]. 
Probable Clear-cut temporal association with administration with improvement 
on cessation of investigational medicinal product or reduction in dose. Reappears upon rechallenge. Follows a known pattern of 
response to the investigational medicinal product. 
 
Adverse events with the causality assessed as unrelated or unlikely are categorized as not related to study medication.

[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
An AE that is serious or potentially serious requires the following additional detailed reports and 
follow-up and should be recorded in the CRF.  The content of these detailed reports should 
address the Investigator’s (or in some cases, the Sponsor’s) estimate of causality, and whether or 
not the AE is identified in nature, severity, and frequency in the Investigator’s Brochure or in 
other risk information that has been supplied to the Investigator.  Sponsor Notification 
Any SAE that occurs after starting study drug administration must be reported to the Clinical Study Monitor or Project Manager as soon as information is available.  In turn, the Clinical Study Monitor/Project Manager must immediately inform the Medical Monitor of the event and document the notification in a telephone/contact [CONTACT_377972].  The urgency for reporting a SAE is 
three-fold:  (1) to facilitate discussion (and implementation, if necessary) by [CONTACT_828525]-up measures; (2) to facilitate Investigator reporting of unanticipated problems involving risk to human patients to the IRB/REB; and (3) to enable the Sponsor to fulfil the requirements to the appropriate regulatory authority.  
Any non-fatal or non-life-threatening SAE, regardless of expectedness or causality, or fatal or 
life-threatening SAE must be immediately reported to the Clinical Study Monitor or Project Manager by [CONTACT_130153], and a written report (Serious AE Report Form) signed by [CONTACT_828526], but no later than the timelines outlined in Table .  This documentation will be forwarded to the Medical 
Monitor immediately to facilitate the prompt detection by [CONTACT_828527], severity, or frequency of serious AEs, and allow the Sponsor to meet reporting requirements of the appropriate regulatory agency.

**The time period for notification of an SAE begins when the Investigator or any site personnel obtains 
knowledge of the event.  
 
Institutional Review Board Notification 
The Investigator must also promptly notify the IRB/REB of the SAE, including any follow-up 
information in accordance with local institutional policy. 
 
If a given SAE is associated with the study medication and is unexpected, CASI Pharmaceuticals will forward an Investigational New Drug application (IND) Safety Report to the regulatory authorities and to the Investigator(s).  In accordance with FDA regulations, it is the Investigator’s responsibility to promptly inform the IRB/REB of the IND Safety Report. 
 
Significant or Unexpected Toxicities 
CASI Pharmaceuticals, the Medical Monitor, and the involved Investigator will monitor the safety experience of all patients treated.  Significant or unexpected toxicities that, in the judgment of the Investigator, the Sponsor, or the Medical Monitor, presents an unacceptable 
consequence or risk to the patient will result in discontinuation of the patient from further study 
participation.  The Investigator will notify CASI Pharmaceuticals immediately of any significant or unexpected toxicities.  The Investigator, CASI Pharmaceuticals, or the Medical Monitor will notify other investigators and all institutional review committees of important or unexpected toxicity.  Treatment may be delayed to allow recovery from treatment-related toxicities and to 
consider if dose reductions are appropriate for continued therapy with ENMD-2076.  A delay of 
up to [ADDRESS_1149581] Study Adverse Events 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek information on AEs or SAEs in former study participants who completed the end of study visit.  However, the Investigator should promptly notify CASI Pharmaceuticals, or designee, if the Investigator learns of any SAE or death of a 
study patient within 30 days after a patient has discontinued study drug administration, and such 
event(s) is (are) reasonably related to the study medication. Investigators should promptly notify CASI Pharmaceuticals, or designee, if they become aware of a former study participant who is one of the parents of a subsequently conceived child with a congenital anomaly (see below). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Follow -up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events and Other 
Investigations 
All SAEs must be followed until they are resolved (return to normal or baseline values), 
stabilized, or the patient is lost to follow-up and cannot be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  Supplemental measurements and/or evaluations may be necessary to fully investigate the nature and/or

monoclonal clone DO-1 (1:2000), Santa Cruz; pHH3 (Ser10) mouse monoclonal (1:1000), Cell 
Signalling; Ki67 mouse monoclonal clone MIB-1 (1:200), Dako; CD31 mouse monoclonal clone JC70A (1:500), Dako.   Slides are incubated overnight with biotin conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson 
ImmunoResearch, 1:200), followed by [CONTACT_828531]-conjugated 
streptavidin (Jackson, 1:200) for 1 h. After washing in PBS, slides are developed with 3,3’ diaminobenzidine (Dako), followed by [CONTACT_828532] (Dako). All slides are digitally scanned using the ScanScope XT brightfield scanner (Aperio Technologies), with an 
Olympus 20 X/0.75NA objective lens (resolution 0.5 microns/pi[INVESTIGATOR_8070]). Images are visualized 
and analyzed using ImageScope (Aperio). Cells positive for pHH3 and Ki67 staining are counted 
using the accompanying Nuclear_v9 algorithm. The CD31 microvessel density (MVD) count is determined by [CONTACT_828533]31- dense hotspots in each section and counting the number of

will be dichotomized as responders (CR/PR versus non-responders). The null hypothesis that the true response rate is 2% will be tested against a one-sided alternative that the true response rate is 15%. In the first stage, [ADDRESS_1149595] 1.1 criteria after two cycles of treatment. If there are zero responses in these 16 patients, the

Adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_828535] (the number of subjects reporting at least one epi[INVESTIGATOR_44715] a specific adverse event), incidence of adverse events by [CONTACT_162845], incidence of adverse events by [CONTACT_828536], and incidence of 
adverse events causing withdrawal and incidence of serious adverse events.  Regarding severity 
and attribution summaries, the most extreme outcome (highest severity and closest to study drug related) will be used for those subjects who experience the same adverse event on more than one occasion.   
Written narratives will be provided for all serious, unexpected or other significant adverse events 
that are judged to be of special interest because of their clinical importance. 
10.5.2 Clinical Laboratory 
Clinical laboratory results will be summarized with descriptive statistics at baseline each study 
timepoint and with shifts from baseline.

10.6 Source Data and Records  
Source data are all the information in original records and certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_2149], observations, laboratory reports, data sheets provided by [CONTACT_162849], which are necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the study. 
The investigator will permit study-related monitoring, audit(s), IRB review(s) and regulatory 
inspection(s), with direct access to all the required source records. 
All study records will be retained for a period of time as defined by [CONTACT_828537] E6 section 4.[ADDRESS_1149596] of the investigation.  In other 
situations (e.g., where the investigation is not in support of or as part of an application for a 
research or marketing permit), a period of [ADDRESS_1149597] the Sponsor 
prior to disposal of any records related to this study.  
10.7 Reporting of Results  
The Case Report Form (CRF) is an integral part of the study and subsequent reports.  The CRF 
must be used to capture all study data recorded in the patient’s medical record.  The CRF must 
be kept current to reflect patient status during the course of the study.  Only a patient screening and randomization number and patient initials will be used to identify the patient.    The monitor is responsible for performing on-site monitoring at regular intervals throughout the 
study to verify adherence to the protocol; verify adherence to local regulations on the conduct of 
clinical research; and ensure completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data entered in the CRF.  CASI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. or a designated CRO will monitor completed Case Report Forms 
(CRFs).  A case report form will be provided for each screened patient.  All protocol-required information collected during the study must be entered by [CONTACT_737], 
or designated representative, in paper CRF or the Target e*CRF™, an Internet-based electronic 
data collection system, which is 21CFR Part 11 compliant..  All details of the CRF completion 
and correction will be explained to the investigator.  The management module of Target 
e*CRF™ , if used, includes edit check and query systems that seamlessly integrate with the data

Confidential    44 of 50 entry system.  All modifications to the data in the eCRF are tracked by [CONTACT_121755] 
(date and identity of the person making the change are instantaneously recorded). The actual date (and time, if applicable) of each assessment should always be entered in the CRFs  If the Investigator authorizes other persons to make entries in the CRF, the names, positions, and 
signatures of these persons must be indicated on the Site Delegation Log. 
 The Investigator, or designated representative, should complete the eCRF as soon as possible after information is collected, preferably on the same day that a study patient is seen for an examination, treatment, or any other study procedure.  Any outstanding entries must be 
completed immediately after the final examination.  By [CONTACT_8345], an explanation must be provided 
for all missing data, altered data, and/or out of range data.  The completed case report form must be reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_184083] a designated sub investigator after all the data was monitored and verified as 
final by [CONTACT_402998]. 
 Final monitored and audited CRFs will be provided by [CONTACT_828538] a PDF file. 
10.[ADDRESS_1149598] Data  
The investigator will ensure that the confidentiality of the subjects' data will be preserved. In the CRF or any other documents submitted to the sponsor, the subjects will not be identified by [CONTACT_2249], but by [CONTACT_2250], which consists of their initials and number in the study. The investigator will maintain documents not meant for submission to the sponsor, e.g., the 
confidential subject identification code and the signed informed consent forms, in strict 
confidence.

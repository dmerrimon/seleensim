Background, Rationale and Context  
The latest obesity treatment guidelines for all ages recommend an intensive lifestyle intervention 
involving behavioral counseling, caloric restriction, and regular exercise to achieve weight loss.1 
While this approach elicits moderate weight loss over a short period of time (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 6 -12 mos), 
weight regain is the norm.[ADDRESS_48704] weight may be especially detrimental for older adults 
who are prone to preferential ly store excess calories as fat, rather than lean mass;3-5 thus, it is 
imperative that WL interventions for older adults focus on the challenge of weight regain.  
 
The current recommendation to prevent weight re gain is performance of a high volume of physical 
activity/exercise (200 -300 min/wk),1,6 an approach that has not been highly successful , especially 
in reduced -weight older adults as they are likely less able to adhere to this recommendation.7,8 A 
key biological adaptation to weight loss is a decrease in total energy expenditure, mainly through 
declines in non -exercise activities of daily living (spontaneous physical ac tivity, SPA).9-11 SPA does 
not include structured exercise and is primarily influenced by [CONTACT_46129] (SB; defined as  
sitting or lying down12). Both the duration and the number of brea ks in SB are consistently 
associated with multiple adverse health outcomes, including weight gain, independent of exercise 
behavior.13-[ADDRESS_48705] an innovative, scalable, and acceptable behavioral intervention 
that targets this known risk factor for weight gain. We found that this intervention is feasible and 
well-tolerated by [CONTACT_21140]; if proven to be effective against weight regain, it would add 
important scientific input  for advancing treatment guidelines.  
 
We hypothesize that, in older adults, intervening on SB will be more effective for preventing weight 
regain than the conventional approach of intervening on exercise behavior. This is supported by 
[CONTACT_46130]: 1)  decreased SPA/increased SB is a consistent biological adaptation to weight 
loss31-39 and this adaptation predicts weight regain;40 2) as our data show , reducing SB with a self -
monitoring intervention enhances weight loss and may prevent weight regain41; 3) interventions 
targeting increased e xercise are less tolerated and sustained over time in older, obese adults42-50 
who may be more likely to adhere to a SB intervention; 4) initiation of exercise in older adults can 
lead to compensatory increases in SB,51-66 thus reducing total energy expenditure and limiting its 
efficacy for preventing weight regain; and 5) compensatory eating occurs in many individuals who 
exercise,56,67,68 though the effects of altering SB on appetite a nd energy intake are not known .    
Objectives  
Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_46112] a novel, highly acceptable, behavioral intervention (SitLess) 
that focuses on increased awareness of SB emplo ying accelerometry -based self -monitoring, that 
is reinforced with other self -regulatory strategies, improves weight loss during treatment and 
prevents weight regain during a short (5 -month) follow -up.[ADDRESS_48706] weight . 
This will be a n 18-month trial in up to 189  obese (BMI=30 -45 kg/m2) older (65 -85 years) adults 
randomiz ed to one of three treatment  arms, all with a caloric restriction intervention for weight loss 
(WL) plus: 1) moderate -intensity aerobic exercise (WL+EX); 2) a SB intervention (WL+SitLess); or 
 
    3 
 3) (WL+EX+SitLess) . Parti cipants will undergo a [ADDRESS_48707] , self -
managed, 9 -month follow -up phase to address these aims and hypotheses : 
Aim 1 : To determine w hether addition of an intervention that targets sedentary behavior to a 
standard WL intervention that only targets EX results in a larger 18-month reduction in body weight 
in older, obese adults.  
Primary hypothesis : WL+EX+ SitLess  will have lower 18 -mo body weight than either WL+EX or 
WL+ SitLess . 
Secondary hypothesis:   WL+ SitLess  will have lower 18 -mo body weight than WL+EX.  
 
Aim 2 : To compare the effects of the interventions on volume and pattern of sedentary behavior 
and physical activity and determine if  these factors pre dict weight regain during the 9 -month follow -
up phase.  
Hypothesis : WL+EX+ SitLess  will have higher total physical activity energy expenditure, less 
sedentary behavior, more breaks in sedentary behavior, and more minutes of light and moder ate-
vigorous activity averaged across follow -up than either WL+EX or WL+SitLess.  
Hypothesis:  Irrespective of treatment arm, greater activity energy ex penditure and fewer  minutes 
of sedentary behavior after the  WL phase will be predictive of less weight re gain during follow -up.   
 
Aim 3 : To evaluate  treatment effects on clinical outcomes (body c omposition, functional fitness,  
cardiometabolic risk, fatigue, appetite) and social cognitive measures .  
Hypothesis:  WL+EX+SitLess will improve the se tertiary outcom es more than either WL+EX or 
WL+SitLess.  
 
Methods and Measures  
Study Overview : We will use a 3 -group design in up to189  older (65 -85 years), obese  (BMI=30 -45 
kg/m2), sedentary men  and women , all of  whom will undergo a 9 -month WL interventi on ([ADDRESS_48708]  phase), followed by a [ADDRESS_48709] our overall hypothesis that intervening on SB will enhance 
long-term WL in this age group. The diet element of the intervention is ide ntical across groups, 
but groups differ by [CONTACT_46131] : 1) structured, moderate -intensity , aerobic exercise 
(WL+EX); 2) intervening on SB throughout the day (WL+SitLess ); or 3) ( WL+EX+SitLess).   
 
Recruitment  of study participants : Our recruitment  goals include: 50 % women and 20 % minority. 
We will recruit these individuals using community -based recruitment strategies, including 
newspaper and radio advertisements, and mass mailings. Specific inclusion/exclusion criteria 
(see table) are in  place to e liminate those  that may be adversely affected by [CONTACT_46132] t o comply with the interventions . To reduce adverse 
effects of dietary WL we exclude individuals that are non -obese, those with recent WL, those who 
have low bone densi ty, are being treated for osteoporosis, or taking medication that may affect 
bone density, and/or  those who have deficient levels of vitamin D (25 hydroxyvitamin D level < 20 
ng/mL) who are not taking a calcium/vitamin D supplement .   We also exclude anyon e who 
cannot walk unassisted .  
 
 
Participant screening and randomization : All individuals who respond to our recruitment 
strategies will call a toll -free phone number and a recruiter will describe the study and perform a 
brief screen for general eligibilit y. They will be asked about their age, weight, height, current 
physical activity  habits , body weight in the past year, medical history, current medications , and 
 
    [ADDRESS_48710] conform to the study’s inclusion/exclusion cr iteria 
(see table below).

 refraining from food, bev erages  (with the exception of water) , alcohol and caffeine . Before any 
data collection, participants provide written informed consent and complete a HIPAA 
authorization form in accordance with our IRB policy. At this visit, weight and height will be 
measur ed to calculate BMI. Individuals who meet the BMI criteria will undergo a medical history 
and a cognitive test (M oCA). The medical history (including blood pressure, review of 
medications, and a fasting blood draw for metabolic panel , vitamin D level,  and blood cell count) 
will exclude those with recent history of coronary heart disease, cancer, liver or renal disease, 
severe  pulmonary disease, gross physical impairment, uncontrolled hypertension, or any 
contraindications to exercise. The fasting blood prof ile will exclude those with uncontrolled 
diabetes,69 anemia, or liver, renal, or hematological dysfunction. Individuals with abnormal 
results at screening will be referred to their physicians . Prior to randomization, eligible 
participants  will be asked if they would like to participate in an MRI ancillary study. This is visit 
2.1 listed in the table on page 7.  Refusal to participate in the ancillary study will not exclude 
them from the main (parent) study.  See Appendix A for details of t he MRI ancillary study.  
Eligible participants will be randomized to treatment using a web -based randomization scheme  
developed by [CONTACT_46134] , stratified by [CONTACT_46135].  
  
Study Interventions  
Weight Loss intervention : 9-mo WL phase —All participants will undergo a dietary WL 
intervention designed to elicit behavioral changes leading to decreased caloric intake sufficient to 
yield a ~10% loss of initial body mass. The WL intervention includes nutrition education, state -of-
the-art beha vioral methods for promoting WL, and strategies that optimize self -regulation.8, 70, 71 
During the intensive phase of WL (months 1 -6), participants will meet in weekly group sessions 
delivered by [CONTACT_46136] o r staff trained on specific elements of the intervention with individual 
sessions possible on an as needed basis. These group meetings will transition to bimonthly group 
meetings during months 7 -9 and to monthly  follow -up phone/email co ntact  during the fol low-up 
phase (months 10 -18). 
 
Individual goals for caloric intake will be prescribed to achieve an energy deficit of ~400 kcal/d 
from weight maintenance energy requirements (resting energy expenditure x activity factor of 1.3). 
The macronutrient goal will target an intake range of 25 -30% from protein, 20 -35% fat, and 45 -
55% carbohydrates. The education and counseling component of the intervention will emphasize 
instruction in making healthy, lower -calorie food choices while teaching changes in eating habits  to 
lower caloric intake. Specific emphasis will be placed on the acquisition and use of self -
management skills, particularly self -monitoring of diet and weight.  
 
Throughout the 9 -month WL phase, participants will be asked to track their food and beverage  
intake daily  (via a paper diary o r an internet -based diary) ) for at least the first [ADDRESS_48712] for additional assessment and intervention. During the 
final month o f the WL treatment, emphasis will be placed on transitioning to self -managed weight 
maintenance. Particular emphasis is placed on regular self -monitoring of body weight and 
discussion of how to deal with relapse.  
 
9-mo Follow -up phase —During this phase, pa rticipants will receive a monthly phone call or 
email contact, for the purpose of emphasizing study adherence and continuity of self -regulatory 
skills for monitoring diet and body weight.  
 
    7 
 SitLess intervention : 9-mo WL phase —Participants assigned to the WL+ SitLess and 
WL+EX+SitLess groups will be encouraged and taught to reduce sedentary behavior (SB) during 
waking hours. The SitLess treatment targets increases in postural shifts and light, spontaneous 
physical activity (SPA) (MET level <3).41, 72 The intervention is individually tailored due to varied 
physical/social environments along with the heterogeneity inherent in the daily lives and capacities 
of older adults. The primary goal is to increase the number of p ostural shifts across the day by 
25% and to increase light activity to a minimum of 3000 steps each day with specific goals being 
collaborative , progressive,  and based, in part, on baselines levels of light activity  to optimize 
motivation and to accomodate  individual differences. As a general rule, we discourage bouts of SB 
that are >30 minutes at any one time; however, we also realize that this may not always be 
possible. To faciltiate achieving their goals, participants receive [ADDRESS_48713]. Each 
participant only sees his/her own data , while the interventionist has access to data on all 
participants and can encourage them  via phone or email if goals are not being met or the device is 
malfunctioning. The study website is used: 1) to track self-monitoring, 2) to assist in motivating 
participants via graphic feedback on their short - and lo ng-term progress, and 3) as a vehicle  for 
reinforcing and modifying participants’ goals. The website also provides an additional means of 
communication between participants and intervention staff . 
 
The Fitbit and website are used to induce behavior change over the course of the intervention; 
participants begin wearing the Fitbit  daily for the first [ADDRESS_48714] 6 
months and bimonthly during months 7 -9. These sessions will focus on: (1) reviewing data from 
the activity monitors, (2) reinforcement for observed changes in behavior, and (3) motivational 
interviewing and problem solving to increase commitment to change and assist with overcoming 
barriers.73 The goal is to build commitment to the use of the devices and to link the feedback  to 
improvements in personally -valued outcomes in their daily lives . 
 
9-mo Follow -up phase —During this phase, participants will receive a monthly phone call or 
email contact [CONTACT_46137].   
 
 
 
Aerobic exercise intervention : 9-mo WL phase —Participants in the WL+EX and 
WL+EX+SitLess treatment arms will be asked to perform structured aerobic exercise (mostly 
treadmill walking) of moderate -intensity for 4 -5 days/week, progressing to a duration of 200 
 
    8 
 min/week. Participants will attend center -based sessions for at least 3 d ays/week during the first 
intensive [ADDRESS_48715] one d ay/week during the second 3 -month transition phase 
(months 7 -9), with re cording of home -based exercise for the other 2 -4 days/week. The rationale 
for, background education on exercise training, and monitoring of study progress occurs in 
conjunction with the WL sessions in a manner consistent with the SitLess intervention. The level of 
exercise is based on current public health recommendations from the American Heart Association 
and American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) for optimizing cardiovascular fitness in older 
adults,[ADDRESS_48716]. Participants will keep a log of their treadmill 
speed, grade, exercise duration, and the amount of energy expended for each exercise session 
which is used for feedback and reinforcement. All participants will be instructed to wear pr oper 
footwear, will be familiarized with the treadmills prior to use and will be instructed in fall pre vention 
safety. Participants  will warm -up by [CONTACT_46138] 3 -5 min at a slow pace and will then walk at an 
intensity of 65 -70% of heart rate reserve (HRR, assessed during the VO 2peak test). In general, the 
duration of supervised walking exercise will progress from 15 -20 min at 50% HRR the 1st week to 
40-50 min at 65 -70% HRR by [CONTACT_2671] 6th week and thereafter. Each walking session will end 
with a [ADDRESS_48717] two HR 
readings (by [CONTACT_46139]) will be taken during each supervised walking session to monitor 
compliance to the prescribed intensity. Speed and grade will be adjusted individu ally to insure that 
participants exercise at their prescribed exercise intensity.  
The exercise prescription for the home -based sessions will allow the participant to perform over 
ground walking, or treadmill walking, elliptical or stationary bike if avail able. They will be 
counseled to exercise at a moderate -intensity as determined by a rating of 13 -15 using Borg’s 
Rating of Perceived Exertion.76  
Throughout the 18 month intervention period, those in the EX treatment arms will also wear a 
Fitbit device that will be integrated with the study website. Here, participants will view  receive 
daily feedback relative to sustained bouts of physical activity (i.e., greater than 10 consecutive 
minutes of movement).  As in the SitL ess intervention, participants begin wearing the Fitbit daily 
for the first [ADDRESS_48718] 2 days each week.  
9-mo Follow -up phase —During this phase, participants will receive a monthly phone call or 
email contact [CONTACT_46140] r the purpose of emphasizing adherence to their moderate -intensity exercise 
goal of 5 -6 days/week to maintain a volume of 200 min/week.    
Participants in all three groups will receive a Fitbit activity monitor, prior to the start of intervention, 
to assist  with self -monitoring of their prescribed activity (e.g., aerobic exercise and/or decreased 
daily SB). As stated above, they will be encouraged to wear the Fitbit daily during the [ADDRESS_48719] twice/week during the [ADDRESS_48720] study visit, participants will 
be allowed to k eep the Fitbit.  
 
In addition, the study interventions require the use of a smartphone to  upload data from the Fitbit 
and to  access  the study website  to receive encouragement and motivation. If a participant does 
not own a smartphone or their smartphone is not compatible with our applications, the study will 
provide them with a smartphone and a phone/data plan for the length of their participation in the 
 
    [ADDRESS_48721] study visit (V8), participants will return the smartphones and they will be 
deactivated.

Study  Measure(s)  
1. Baseline demographic data  will be  recorded based on participant self -report. Medical 
information  on prior and existing co -morbidities and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46116] -
report and confirmed by [CONTACT_46141]. We will also record 
medica tion use  by [CONTACT_46142] (including nutritional supplements).  
 
2. Adverse events  will be assessed by [CONTACT_46143] , and during 
monthly phone or email contact [CONTACT_46144] s during the 9-month follow -up phase, to report 
any health changes, injuries, etc. and these will be recorded using the Adverse Event Form .  
 
3. Body weight and composition : Body weight  (the study’s Primary Outcome ) will be measured 
in our clinic on the same scale.  Body compos ition, bone density, visceral fat will be measured by 
[CONTACT_751]-energy X -ray absorptiometry (DXA; Hologic Discovery W, Bedford, MA). All scans will be 
performed and analyzed by [CONTACT_46145] l Densitometry. Bone mineral density (BMD) will be measured using specific 
scans of the anterior -posterior spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (L1 -L4) and proximal femur. Visceral fat area will be 
measured from the whole -body scan in a [ADDRESS_48724] at a level approximate with the 4th lumbar vertebrae .77 
 
4. Resting metabolic rate  will be assessed  to determine participant’s weight -maintaining 
energy needs for prescribing the 400 kcal/d energy deficit for WL and wil l be measured again at 
6- and 18-months to determine its response to the interventions. RMR will be measured in the 
morning after a n overnight  fast (8 hour minimum of no food, beverage, alcohol, caffeine or 
strenuous exercise)  by [CONTACT_46146] .[ADDRESS_48725] 30 min  and RMR is calculated using the Weir equation.78 
 
5. Sedentary behavior, minutes of light and moderate -vigorous physical activity, and energy 
expenditure : We will us e the ActivPAL®TM monitor to assess treatment effects on daily SB and 
physical activity.79-84 Participants will be asked to wear the devices continuously (they are water 
resistant) for 7  consecutive days at each  time point . Data will be downloaded at the end of each 
7-day period and cleaned and summarized for statistical analyses . 
 
6. Physical function measures  to be conducted include:  1) Expanded  Short Physical 
Performance Battery  (SPPB) , which  is a measure of lowe r-extremity function consisting of 
walking speed, balance, and repeated chair stands .85 2) 400-meter walk , which  is a measure of 
aerobic endurance;86, 87 participants  are instructed to complete the 400m distance (on a flat 
indoor surface) as quickly as possible at a maintainable pace and the time to complete the walk 
is recorded in seconds. 3) Perce ived Fatigue/Exertion  will assess perceived fatigability at a 
given wor kload. Participants walk for 5 min at 0% grade at a fixed, comfortable sp eed of 2.0  
mph, and h eart rat e and perceived exertion are  recorded  at midpoint and end. 4)Walking 
efficien cy, will be assessed as  the number of calories used for wal king at 2.[ADDRESS_48726] will be perform ed before the assessment of  
VO 2 peak and serve s as a warm -up to accli mate participants to the treadmill.  5) Peak aerobic 
capacity (VO 2peak)  will be measured during a graded exercise  test to exhaustion and used for 
prescription of exercise intensity (at baseline) and as an outcome measure of fitness. 
 
    12 
 Additionally, a baseline, room air, oxygen saturation (SpO2) will be recorded prior to the start of 
the graded exercise test and at peak  aerobic capacity. The graded exercise test during the 
screening visit will also be used as screening for participants who would otherwise qualify for 
supplementary oxygen.  We have extensive experience measuring VO 2peak in older persons.88-
90 
 
7. Psychosocial Assessments : Since attachment -related behavior is an important facet of group -
mediated interventions and known to be associated with responsiveness to behavior change, we 
will assess anxiety and avoidance expe rienced in close relationships.91 As social cognitive 
measures, we will assess self -efficacy expectations related to physical activity92 and eating 
behavior,93 and outcome expectations for physical function and app earance.94 Perceived stress 
will be evaluated with a short -form of the perceived stress scale,95 trait mindfulness with the 
MAAS,96 and control in resisting food using the power of food scale.97  
 
8. Craving  Assessment : One tertiary goal of EMPOWER is to exam ine whether appetite and 
craving for desired foods may change  over the course of the study. At baseline and follow -up 
visits, and following an ove rnight fast, we will administer  a multidimensional state measure of 
craving.98 The measure of craving provides  subscales that assess the desire to consume highly 
valued foods, the positive reinforcement resulting from their consumption, the relief from negative 
feeling states that these foods provide, lack of control related to food consumption, and hunger.  
 
9. Cardiometabolic risk factors : A fasting venous blood sample will be collected at baseline, 6 -
months and 18 -months  to measure lipoprotein lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] , C-reactive protein, and HbA1c,  glucose and 
insulin (all will be measured by [CONTACT_46147]). Vitamin D  will only be collected at baseline.  For those 
participants that agree to blood storage, p lasma and serum will also be extracted from whole blood 
samples and stored at -80oC for future assays . We will also assess treatment effects on seated 
blood pressure , which will be  assessed in the right arm using an automated sphygmomanometer 
after res ting quietly for 10 -15 minutes  
 
10.  Fatigue measures : The following fatigue questionnaires will be administered : 1) PROMIS 
Short -form 8a ; 2) FACIT Fatigue Scale; and 3) Pi[INVESTIGATOR_46117].  
 
11. Cognitive function  will be assessed during screening using the Montreal Cognitive 
Assessment (MoCA) ; participants must score ≥[ADDRESS_48727] 
(DSST). Participants are given a series of numbered symbols and then asked to draw the 
appropriate symbols below a list of random numbers. The score is the number of correctly made 
matches in 2 minutes (120 seconds).  
12. Ecological Momentary Assessment : Increasingly researchers are recognizing the large 
degree of variability within the individual, and within the day, and the role this variability has on 
intervention efficacy. Therefore, ecological momentary assessment (EMA) will be used to study 
within -person and within -day interactions between sleep quality and duration (assessed via 
items from the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_46118]), feeling states (i.e., calmness, fatigue, 
relaxation, tiredness, assessed via items from the  exercise -induced feelings inventory), affect 
(assessed via the feelings scale), level of hunger (assessed by [CONTACT_46148]),

Prior to the start o f the intervention and following the initial [ADDRESS_48728] assessment of the d ay. 
13. A Technology survey and Intervention survey will be administered at 9 months and 18 
months assessment visits to gain insight on the participants opi[INVESTIGATOR_46119].  
 
Statistical Analyses  
 Sample size : The sample s ize chosen for this study (n=180; 60/group) provides >85 % statistical 
power (with estimated 51 completers per group,  see Table) to definitively test our Primary 
Hypothesis. In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_16080], the adjusted mean group weight difference after 10 months (5 
months of weight loss and 5 months of follow -up) was 3.6 kg (95% CI= 1.2 -6.0 kg). Thus, with the 
longer 18 -month tim e frame in the proposed study, we anticipate there could be a mean group 
difference between WL+EX+SitLess and WL+EX or WL+SitLess of ~ 4 kg; however, we will have  
power to detect a mean group difference as little as 2.7 kg. This corresponds to 3.0 -4.4% of t he 
baseline weight for a 90 kg person and is considered clinically meaningful. We also anticipate that 
the WL+SitLess group will regain less weig ht than WL+EX, and will have >85 % power to detect a 
mean group difference as small as 2.3  kg (not adjusted for multiple comparisons). Based on our 
prior [ADDRESS_48729] no more than 15% 
drop-out. In addition, with 51 /grp, we have at least 80% power to detect effect sizes of 0.49-0.52 
for our Aim 2 outcomes ( physical activity energy expenditure, and minutes of SB and SPA ), under 
ANCOVA with repeated measures (to estimate the time -averaged difference in response), 
assuming a compound symmetry covariance structure, and effect sizes of 0. 24-0.49 for our Aim 3 
outcomes under ANCOVA models as for the primary aim.  
 
Database management : All data except those generated from the activity monitors will be 
entered into the web -based study database as collected. Our data entry sy stem will protect 
confidentiality and data security and the use of text containing identifying information will be 
avoided . Activity monitor data will be downloaded to a server and the summary data merged 
with other study data. Final analysis datasets will  be stored in SAS. All data will undergo range 
checks at the time of data entry and will be examined periodically by [CONTACT_46150], unusual data needing further verification, and outliers. 
Plots of longi tudinal observations will be used to inspect for unusual changes that need to be 
verified against source documents.  
 
Data analyses : Initial analyses will follow the “intent -to-treat” principle in which data from all 
randomized participants are analyzed ac cording to their randomized groups.  We will document 
withdrawal and compliance in detail. We will attempt to identify baseline covariates that predict Table 5.   Power t o detect significant differences in mean change (α=0.05 level; [ADDRESS_48730], Bonferroni 
adjustment for multiple comparisons) between groups using ANCOVA, adjusting for sex; Baseline SD and pre -
post correlations (adjusted for sex) were calculated using data  from obese, older persons enrolled in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268].

 attrition and compliance, and if such covariates can be identified, the analyses may need to 
incorporate stratification by [CONTACT_46151]. Aim 1 hypothesis will be tested using 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to compare group differences in 18 -mo body weight, adjusted 
for baseline weight, gender (used to stratify randomization), and treatment arm. Differences in 
least -squares means and associated 95% confidence intervals will be calculated. Bonferroni 
adjustment will be used to account for multiple comparisons .  
 
Secondary analyses  (Aims 2 & 3) —Hypotheses of Aim [ADDRESS_48732] -squares means and associated 
95% confidence intervals will be calculated. Group differe nces in breaks in SB will be tested using 
a generalized linear model with repeated measures, since a Poisson distribution is a better fit for 
such count data. Linear regression will be used to examine whether total physical activity  energy 
expendit ure and sedentary behavior at 6 -months is predic tive of less weight regain at 18 -months, 
adjusted for baseline body weight and gender.  
  
Hypotheses of our Aim 3 secondary outcomes will be tested at the 0.05 significance level using 
ANCOVA techniques similar to th ose used for the primary hypothesis. All initial models will be 
adjusted only for gender and baseline variable value; however, specific factors (e.g., age, race, 
initial body weight or composition, medication or supplement use, etc.) that may influence the  
measured responses to the interventions will be evaluated and possibly included in secondary 
analyses. We expect the treatments to similarly affect responses in men and women and between 
races. Nevertheless, we will assess whether there is an interaction between gender and/or race 
and treatment group, and will report this as part of our secondary results. We will also consider 
conducting analyses adjusted for intervention compliance and process measures (such as 
average attendance at the exercise sessions,  amount of initial weight lost, social cognitive/group 
process measures, etc.) to examine the extent to which these factors moderate/alter the effect of 
the intervention on the outcomes.  
Human Subjects Protection  
Subject Recruitment Methods : We will recru it individuals using community -based recruitment 
strategies including newspaper ads and mass mailings. We will also advertise in the Aging 
Center’s  VITAL newsletter and participate in community outreach events .  
Informed Consent : The informed consent proce ss will follow the procedures of the WFSM 
Institutional Review Board. The potential participant is mailed the informed consent form and 
asked to read it before their initial screening visit. The form is written in simple easy to 
understand language.  At fi rst contact [CONTACT_46152], the study staff member will explain the purpose, methods and extent of the study. We 
require study staff to review all of the key aspects of the study verbally with the potent ial 
participants and to question potential participants to ascertain whether s/he has understood the 
information. Potential participants are encouraged to ask questions regarding the consent form 
and the study. Those who are illiterate or have impaired vis ion must have the consent read to 
them, followed by [CONTACT_46153]. A copy of the signed and dated 
consent form will be given to participants, and the original document will be placed in their 
individual study file, which will be stored in a secure location. In compliance with the Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Standards for Privacy of 
Individually Identifiable Health Information of the Department of Health and Human Services, we 
will access per sonal health information only after obtaining informed consent.  
 
Potential Study Risks : There are inherent potential risks to human subjects who participate in 
any research study and the potential risks to study participants in this study are listed below.  
 
    15 
 Any injuries or illnesses (adverse events) during the course of a participant’s enrollment in the 
study are monitored regularly as described in the Data Safety Monitoring Plan.  
Assessment risks : 
• DXA scans : There are risks with exposure to radiation from the whole body, anterior -posterior 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and proximal femur DXA scans. The total radiation dose is [ADDRESS_48733] never been associated w ith any definite adverse effects. Thus, the risk to study 
participants, if any, is estimated to be slight.  
 
• Physical function tests : There is a small risk of injury during the physical function tests, such 
as muscle strains or pulls, falls, or joint injury . Risks will be minimized by [CONTACT_46154]/trained staff conducting these assessments. A warm -up and range of motion 
practice will be conducted before testing. If a participant reports pain, dizziness, or other 
medical problem, the test will be termin ated.   
 
• Blood draw : There is a risk of discomfort, bruising, and/or infection at the sight of puncture for 
blood drawing. To minimize these risks, blood will be drawn only by [CONTACT_46155] a s possible and will use good clinical 
practice procedures to reduce risk of infection.  
 
• Maximal exercise testing  is a common procedure with risks, including fainting, dizziness, 
chest pain, irregular heartbeat, or heart attack, although the latter is extre mely rare (<1 death in 
10,000 tests) in people with no history of heart disease. The test is monitored by [CONTACT_46156]. Blood pressure, heart rate and rhythm, and 
breathing will be closely monitored  before,  throughout, and after the test .  
 
Intervention risks : 
1) Risks of weight loss  at any age include the concomitant loss of lean (muscle and bone) tissue 
along with fat mass loss. However, the clinical impact of this muscle and bone loss is not 
known. Since mos t adults with obesity have a higher muscle mass and bone density, this risk is 
mitigated by [CONTACT_46157] -obese and less likely to benefit from weight loss 
and by [CONTACT_46158] a bone density t -score less than -2.3. In addition,  we will assess 
each participant’ s 25 hydroxyvitamin D blood level at baseline, 6 - and 18 -months; if found to be 
deficient (< 20 ng/mL) a participant will be referred to his/her primary care physician for follow -
up assessment and supplementation  before begi nning the study intervention .      
During the behavioral weight loss classes, w e will also provide nutrition education regarding 
adequate intake of calcium and Vitamin D , including encouraging use of dietary  supplement s. 
Participants will be counseled to c onsume, either using food or dietary supplements, at least 
1300  mg of calcium and 1000 IU  of Vitamin D daily.  
 
Finally, if any participant experiences a bone density decline (either at hip or spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) of  ≥10%, or 
has a t -score of < -2.5, at the 6 -month DXA assessment , she/he  will be counseled to stop their 
caloric restriction and will be referred to his/her primary care physician.   
 
2) The risks of the structured exercise intervention  may include: 1) muscul oskeletal 
complications and muscle soreness in the early phases of the intervention, 2) an increased fall 
risk, and 3) increased risk of hypoglycemia  or hyperglycemia , especially in participants with type 
II diabetes on insulin or short -acting insulin secr etagogues .  
 
 
    [ADDRESS_48734] participants in proper treadmill walking and 
balance safety, proper footwear, and in selection  of safe walking areas outside of the center.   
 
Hypoglycemia/hyperglycemia risks will be mitigated by [CONTACT_46159].[ADDRESS_48735] their blood glucose checked via 
glucometer before and after exercise at the supervised sessions and will be encouraged to do 
this for their home -based exercise. If a part icipant’ s glucose is < 100 mg/dl we will require them 
to consume a snack containing about 15 grams of carbohydrate prior to exercise; if it is >300 
mg/dL they will be encouraged to hydrate and postpone exercise until their blood glucose level 
is below 300 n g/dL. We will also encourage participants to monitor their glucose after exercise 
to determine if food consumption or medication changes should be made. In some cases, we 
may ask a participant to consult with their physician about reducing medication dosag e prior to 
an exercise session.      
 
3) Risks of the SitLess intervention  are minimal, but also may include an enhanced fall risk. This 
will be minimized by [CONTACT_46160].  
 
Confidentiality and Privacy  
Confidentiality will be protected by [CONTACT_21176], minimizing to the fullest extent possible the collection of any information that could 
directly identify study participants , and maintaining all study i nformat ion in a secure manner. To 
help ensure subject privacy and confidentiality, only a unique study identifier will appea r on the 
data collection form. Any collected patient identifying information corresponding to the unique 
study identifier will be mainta ined on a separate master log. The master log will be kept secure, 
with access limited to designated study personnel. Following data collection subject identifying 
information will be destroyed at the earliest opportunity, consistent with data validation and 
study design, producing an anonymous analytical data set. Data access will be limited to study 
staff.  Data and records will be kept locked and secured, with any computer data password 
protected. No reference to any individual participant will appear in rep orts, presentations, or 
publications that may arise from the study.  
 
Data and Safety Monitoring  
The co-PIs, along with the study physician, will be responsible for the overall monitoring of the 
data and safety of study participants. In addition, all  clinic al intervention studies conducted by 
[CONTACT_46161]’s NIH -approved Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).  Finally, the 
external NIA -appointed Data and Safety Monitoring Bo ard (DSMB) will have overall 
responsibility of independently monitoring all aspects of the study, including those that require 
access to any un -blinded data. This committee acts in an advisory capacity to the NIA to 
monitor participant safety, evaluate the  progress of the study, review procedures for maintaining 
the confidentiality of data, and the quality of data collection, management, and analyses. The 
 
    [ADDRESS_48736]’s health and safety. Minor AEs will be recorded and reported within seven days. A 
description of the event, and the date and location of the event will be recorded on the AE 
Reporting Form. The PIs and the Me dical Director will meet quarterly, or as needed, to review 
all reported events and these will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_46120].  
 
Within [ADDRESS_48737] (IRB). If the event occurred as a direct result of participation in this study, an 
amendment will be made to the consent form and the co -PIs will request new IRB approval. The 
SAE will also be reported within [ADDRESS_48738] numerical study IDs 
with no personal identifiers of the participants. These are stored under the Pepper Center 
Tissue Repository (IRB#1219).

Appendix A  
Background, Rationale and Context  
Although the scientific premise of the EMPOWER Sitle ss intervention is based on research showing 
that sedentary behavior in aging has adverse effects on the regulation of body weight1,2 and functional 
decline3,4, recent evidence5,6 suggests there will be considerable within -treatment variability in weight 
loss during the  intensive phase of treatment (the first 6 -months) and in weight regain from [ADDRESS_48756] recently, using baseline brain gray and white matter volume within a support 
vector machine learning model on older adults (n = 52) enrolled in an [ADDRESS_48757] classification to the lower or upper half of the weight loss 
distribution with an average accuracy of 72.62%; a receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated 
that classification performance wa s robust based on an area under the curve of 0.82.[ADDRESS_48758] increased prediction accuracy to 93%.  
 
The ancillary study to EMPOWER will enable us to acquire baseline brain magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) scans on a random subset of n = 90 participants (EMPOWER has a total n = 160).  We 
will test the robustne ss of the brain phenotypes identified in our existing work on an independent 
cohort, examining how well these phenotypes predict (a) weight loss during the first 6 -month intensive 
phase and (b) weight regain from [ADDRESS_48759] ecological momentary assessment data on 
patterns of change in appetite, mood, and fat igue throughout the day both at baseline and again at the 
6-month assessment following the intensive phase of treatment. A secondary aim of this ancillary 
study is to examine whether daily fluctuations in appetite, mood, or fatigue mediate the relationship  
between baseline brain phenotypes and weight loss at 6 -months and/or weight regain from 6 to 18 
months of follow -up. 
 
Primary Aim:  To evaluate the classification accuracy of brain phenotypes based on both structural 
brain MRI scans and functional brain ne tworks to predict baseline -adjusted weight loss at [ADDRESS_48760] across the three treatment groups as well 
as between the three treatment groups.  
 
Secondary Aim:  To examine whether the ability of both brain structure and functional brain networks 
to predict baseline -adjusted weight loss at 6 months and weight regain from 6 to 18 months across the 
three treatment groups as well as between the three treatment groups can be explained by [CONTACT_46164], mood, and fatigue ratings assessed at both baseline and 6 -months following the 
intensive phase of treatment.  
 
 
Methods and Measures  
Our main premise is that the structural features of gray matter and white matter in combination with 
functional br ain networks constitute a brain phenotype for predicting the amount of weight that older 
adults lose following involvement in the intensive 6 -month phase of a weight loss program and the 
amount of weight regained from 6 months until the 18 -month closeout v isit. We also hypothesize that 
the effects of this phenotype on weight loss and weight regain can be explained, in part, by [CONTACT_6270] -
regulatory failure due to daily fluctuations in appetite, mood, and fatigue.  
A random subset of n = 90 participants (from the EMPOWER total n = 160)  stratified by [CONTACT_46165]. All participants must be enrolled in the EMPOWER study and must not have 
contraindications for an MRI scan. All participants selected for this MRI sub -study will be asked to 
comp lete a separate informed consent.  
 
Protocol for collecting brain images:  imaging data will be collected after medical approval to 
participate in the EMPOWER parent study but before beginning the intervention.  This baseline MRI 
scan will take place followi ng an overnight fast by [CONTACT_2299] . After completing a brief food craving 
and a regulation of eating questionnaire, p articipants will be posi tioned in the MRI scanner such that 
they can view an MR -compatible flat panel display positioned at the end of  the MRI scanner. The 
screen is connected to the computer that will be used to present experimental stimuli. The scanning 
protocol involves a resting functional scan in which participants simply lie still with their attention 
 
    26 
 focused on a cross that appear s on the display screen. Following the resting scan, there is both a food 
cue trial and a neutral cue trial that are randomly ordered. During the food cue trial, participants are 
presented with a series of words representing their favorite snack foods (the se are collected prior to 
the MRI scan) and are asked to create an image of each food in their minds -eye and to focus on the 
taste, smell, and pleasure of consuming each food. For the neutral cue trial, neutral stimuli, such the 
word “chair”, are presented  and participants are asked to create an image of each object focusing on 
the shape, color, texture and overall appearance of each object visualized. Visual analogue scales are 
presented immediately following each scan to acquire ratings of state craving f or their favorite foods, a 
rating on positive/negative affect and, following the visualization tasks, a rating of how vivid the images 
appeared in their minds -eye. 
 
Methods of data acquisition and processing: This project utilizes MRI data acquisition and 
processing techniques that our laboratory has used for the last decade. In brief, all scans will be 
performed on a research Siemens 3T Skyra MRI scanner with a 32 -channel head coil utilizing our 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_46125] .  T1 / T2 / FLAIR  structural scan s, a blood -oxygen -level-dependent (BOLD) -
weighted resting scan, and BOLD -weighted trials of food cues and neutral cues  will be collected .  
Diffusion Tensor Images (DTI) and Perfusion Images may also be acquired. The high -resolution (0.98 
x 0.98 x 1.0 mm) T1 -weighted structural scans will be acquired in the sagittal plane using a single -shot 
3D MPRAGE GRAPPA2 sequence (TR = 2.3 seconds, TE = 2.99 ms, 192 slices).  Both BOLD -
weighted image sequences will be acquired in the axial plane using an echo -planar imaging  (EPI) 
sequence (resolution = 4 x 4 x 4 mm, TR = 2.0 seconds, TE = 25 ms, flip angle = 75˚, 35 slices per 
volume, 160 volumes).  
 
Anatomical Image  processing : the T1 -weighted structural images will be first segmented into gray 
matter (GM) and white matter (WM) images using statistical parametric mappi[INVESTIGATOR_46126] 12 
(SPM12). Advanced normalization tools (ANTS) will then be used to warp the segmented images to 
standard space8. The warped images will be modulated with the Jacobian deformation field and 
masked using GM/WM masks provided by [CONTACT_46166][INVESTIGATOR_007] 
(http://www.loni.usc.edu/atlases ). Finally, the images will be smoothed using ANTS median filter 
with a radius of 1.5 mm.  The resulting images w ill serve  as the inputs into a support vector classifier in 
order to classify subjects in the low and high weight loss groups.  
 
BOLD -weighted Scans : The resting state and food cue and neutral cue functional images will be 
processed usi ng our typi[INVESTIGATOR_46127], slice -time correction, co -registration to the 
structural image, normalization, global signal adjustment, regression of signal from the superior 
sagittal sinus, and motion -correction.  The first [ADDRESS_48761] image. Confounding signals, including 6 rigid -body 
transformation parame ters generated during the realignment process and 3 mean signals (whole -
brain, white matter, and CSF) will be regressed out of the functional data. The inverse of the 
deformation field resulting from ANTS registration will be applied to transform the Yale brain atlas9 to 
each subject’s native brain space. Unlike  commonly used brain atlases which integrate functionally 
different areas into one region, the Yale atlas is a functional atlas which parcellates brain into finer 
functional unites (268 regions versu s 90 regions of automated anatomical labeling (AAL)). Finally, t he 
resulting atlas in the individuals’ brain space will be used to extract the mean time series for each 
region from the preprocessed functional images. Correlation matrices will then be thres holded to 
maintain edge density consistency across subjects. This process ensures that comparisons between 
networks are of equivalent density relative to the number of network nodes. This will be done using the 
formula N = Ks  10, with N equal to the numbe r of nodes and K equal to average degree (number of 
 
    27 
 edges per node in the network).  Networks will be thresholded at S = 2.5 based on work showing that 
brain networks fragment when S > [ADDRESS_48762] with an S between 2 and 
312. Correlation values equal to or greater than the correlation coefficient solving the threshold formula 
are preserved and all others set to 0 to produce undirected, weighted networks.  The resulting whole -
brain networks from each study participant will the n serve as the basis for the machine learning 
algorithm testing.  
 
Data Analysis  
Support Vector Machine (SVM) Learning classification :  Our recently published SVM model was 
developed to classify weight loss success and failure in an elderly cohort.[ADDRESS_48763] that this 
combined model will enhance prediction accuracy.  
 
Following this EMPOWER clinical tri al, we will assess our machine learning models by [CONTACT_46167], sensitivity, and specificity in classifying the participants’ weight loss success/failure. 
Similar to our published analyses, we will also perform receiver operator characteristic (ROC) 
analyses to investigate how efficiently the classifiers performed at different decision thresholds. 
ROC curves plot sensitivity versus ‘1 -specificity’ in a given classification decision threshold, and the 
area under the curve (AUC) is calculated to d etermine the effectiveness of the predictions and is 
considered as the best representative score to represent classification algorithm performance.  The 
AUC will be determined for the structural, resting state fMRI brain network, and task -based fMRI 
networ ks by [CONTACT_1029], as well as for the analysis combining these datasets in a single model. A 
one-way repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be performed to evaluate for 
significant differences for the AUC between the [ADDRESS_48764] a bout the study. Participant consent will be documented.  
 
Potential Study Risks  
The risks associated with MRI scans are metal objects in or on the body and fear/anxiety 
associated with being in the MRI scanner. To reduce any risks associated with metal, we will screen 
all potential participants to exclude anyone with metallic or electronic implants. In addition, all 
individuals are screened prior to entering the MRI suite to ensure that they do not have any metallic 
objects on their person. This process is p erformed by [CONTACT_46168].  
  
 
    [ADDRESS_48765] a primary care physician, they will be 
referred to the appropriate clinical practitioner based on the MRI findings. Follow up clinical 
evaluation would be required to validate any potential findings observed in the research MRI scans.  
Any medical costs associated with follow -up of an incidental finding will be the responsibility of the 
study participant and their parents.  
 
 
 
 
Reporting of Unanticipated Problems, Adverse Events or Deviations  
Any unanticipated problems, serious  and unexpected adverse events, deviations or protocol 
changes will be promptly reported by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_46128].

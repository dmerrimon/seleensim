Controlled Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of KPI -121 
1.0% Ophthalmic Suspension in Subjects with Postsurgical 
Inflammation  and Pain  
Objectives:  The prima ry objective  of the study is to i nvestigate the efficacy and 
safety of KPI -121 1.0% ophthalmic suspension  compared to 
placebo in subjects who have undergone c ataract surgery.    
Study Population:  The study populatio n will consist of subjects who  have undergone 
routine uncomplicated cataract surgery and experience ocular 
inflammation postoperatively .    
Number of 
Subjects:  Approximately [ADDRESS_775931] s: KPI-121 1.0% ophthalmic suspension or  placebo  will be supplied as 
investigational product.  
Route and Duration 
of Administration : [ADDRESS_775932] wi ll be instilled in the study  
eye two times per day ( BID) for 14 ± 1  days.  
Study Design:   
 This is a Phase 3, multicenter, double -masked, randomized, 
placebo -controlled, parallel -group study designed to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of KPI-121 1.0% oph thalmic suspension  versus 
placeb o in subjects  who require treatment of postoperative anterior 
ocular inflammation. Approximately [ADDRESS_775933] 
surgery, present at Visit 3 (Day 1) with  ≥ 2 anterior chamber cells in 
the study eye will be randomized in this study at approximately 35 
centers located in the [LOCATION_002] (US). Subjects who experience 
postoperative inflammat ion on the first day following routine , 
uncomplicated, cataract surgery  and who meet all other eligibility 
criteria  will be randomized  to one of two study groups in an 
approximate 1:1 ratio to KPI -121 1.0% ophthalmic suspension 
dosed BID or placebo dosed  BID. Investigational product  or 
placebo will be  initiated on the day following surgery  and instilled 
as one to two drops  in the study eye BID for 14 ± 1 days.

removal and intraocular lens (IOL) placement. In general, trauma to the internal structures of 
the eye is accompanied by [CONTACT_202340], an 
increase in blood flow to the affected area, and extravasations of protein and cellular blood 
e
lements. Postoperative inflammation is manifested principally as bulbar erythema, corneal 
e
dema, ciliary flush and aqueous cells and flare.   
 
If left untreated, inflammation generally resolves within 2 to 4 weeks after surgery; however 
20% to 80% of patients present with anterior chamber cells and/or flare [ADDRESS_775956] 
surgery may lead to complications such as cystoid macular edema (CME) (Apple et al., 1992; 
Tennant, 1978 ) , treatment with anti-inflammatory agents such as glucocorticosteroids is 
employed to reduce pain and discomfort, and to facilitate recovery of the blood-aqueous 
barrier. When administered at the time of surgery and during the immediate postoperative 
period, glucocorticosteroids can reverse the clinical and non-clinical manifestations of 
inflammation  (Leopold, 1985) . In the [LOCATION_002] ( US), topi[INVESTIGATOR_589160] e 
routinely prescribed for at least [ADDRESS_775957] surgery, with longer treatment 
prescribed in cases of severe or unremitting inflammation.   
 
Loteprednol etabonate (LE) is an ester corticosteroid that is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_202319], and has been reported to have fewer side effects than traditional 
glucocorticosteroids. Loteprednol etabonate was approved by [CONTACT_7214] 
(FDA) in 1998 under New Drug Application ( NDA )  20-583  (Lotemax®; Bausch & Lomb). 
Lotemax has gained wide acceptance by [CONTACT_589171]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_202320], wherein the 
drug is active at the site of administration but is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_589161], Lotemax requires frequent dosing (four times per day) which may 
reduce patient compliance.  
 
Kala Pharmaceuticals, Inc. has developed an improved formulation of loteprednol etabonate,

The randomized investigational product kit consists of a box with two dropper bottles of 
investigati
onal product.  At Visit 3, eligible subjects will receive one bottle of investigational 
produ
ct.  The second bottle will be retained at the site and provided to the subject in the event 

KPI- 121-C-[ADDRESS_775964] during the treatment period.  Both the box 
labe
l and dropper bottle labels will contain the following information: sponsor name, protocol 
a
nd randomization number, storage temperature and required statement(s) per the appropriate 
regulatory agency.   
 
The
 investigational product will be stored in a secure area with limited access at 15-25C/59 -
77F with upper limit excursions to 30 C /86F allowed.   Subjects will be instructed to shake 
the 
investigational product bottle prior to administering each dose.  On days when subjects 
re
ceive the first dose in the clinic (Visit 3), the in-clinic dose will count as one of their two 
(BI
D) daily doses. Subjects will then self-administ er an additional dose of investigational 
produ
ct later that day. Visit 3 should be scheduled in the morning to allow subjects to receive 
a
 full day of BID dosing. 
 
On all other study evaluation days, subjects will be asked to instill one “Morning Dose” and 
one
 “Evening Dose” approximately 12 hours following the previous dose.  
 
3.4.2. Methods to Minimize Bias 
 
To minimize bias, the following measures will be taken: 
 
 I nvestigational product assignment (KPI-121 1.0 % ophthalmi c suspension 
versus placebo ) will be randomized and masked to the sponsor, subjects, and 
se
lect investigative staff.   
 The  randomization schedule will be generated by [CONTACT_202342] 
(w
ho is not on the project team) or designee and maintained in a secure and 
limited-access location separate from the study Investigator and members of 
the pr
oject team.

KPI- 121-C-[ADDRESS_775978] WITHDRAWAL AND/ OR DISCONTINUATION  
 
Any subject who wishes to discontinue investigational product use or withdraw from 
pa
rticipation in the study for any reason is entitled to do so without obligation.  The 
Investigator may also discontinue any subject from investigational product use or from study 
participation, if deemed necessary.  
 
Investigational product use may be discontinued and any subject may be discontinued from 
study participation at any time during the study at the discretion of the Investigator or the 
sponsor for any reason including but not limited to: 
 
1. Oc currence of any medical condition or circumstance that exposes the subject 
to substantial risk and/or does not allow the subject to adhere to the 
requirements of the protocol. 
2. An y SAE, clinically significant AE, severe laboratory abnormality, intercurrent 
illness, or other medical condition that indicates to the Investigator that 
continued participation is not in the best interest of the subject. 
3. S ubject's decision to withdraw. 
4. Any woman who becomes pregnant while participating in the study.  
Information on the pregnancy and outcome will be requested.    
5. S ubject’s failure to comply with protocol requirements or study related 
procedures. 
6. Te rmination of the study by [CONTACT_1034], FDA, or other regulatory authorities. 
 
In the event study discontinuation of a randomized subject is necessary, the Investigator 
should make every attempt to have the subject complete Visit [ADDRESS_775979]’s final study visit, an effort will be 
made to follow up until the AE is resolved or stabilized, the subject is lost to follow-up, or 
there is some other resolution of the event.  The Investigator should make every attempt to 
follow all serious adverse events (SAEs) to resolution.  The reason for premature 
discontinuation should be entered onto the Case Report Form (CRF) and recorded in the 
subject chart. 
 
Subjects who withdraw from the study will not be replaced.

CONFIDENTIAL Additionally, the trial or parts of the trial may be discontinued by [CONTACT_589173], Inc.  This 
may be based on a significant number of AEs of a similar nature that warrant such action.    
 
5.3. COLLECTION OF DATA 
 
Source documentation for data collected in this study will be maintained at the investigative 
site.  In cases where no source will be used (e.g., subject diary), it will be noted in the 
Investigator files. The CRF will be electronic (eCRF) and data will be electronically entered 
from the source documentation in to the eCRF. After study completion, an archival copy [e.g., 
porta
ble document format (PDF)] of the eCRF data will be retained by [CONTACT_779]. 
 
5.3.1. Unscheduled Visit 
 
Any visits or procedures performed beyond those specified within the protocol must be 
documented in the Unscheduled Visit pages of the eCRF. Unscheduled visits may include but 
are not limited to reporting adverse events (AEs), changes in concomitant medications, or 
ophthalmic assessments as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_589174].  If the 
subject is discontinuing study participation at the unscheduled visit, the eCRFs for Visit 6 
should be completed rather than the eCRFs for an Unscheduled Visit. 
 
5.4. RESCUE MEDICATION USE 
 
Any subjects not responding adequately to the study medication may be rescued and placed 
on alternate therapy at the Investigator's discretion at any time. The choice of rescue 
medication is at the Investigator's discretion. Any subject placed on rescue therapy will 
discontinue use of the study medication and continue study participation through Visit 7.  
 
Rescued subjects will be considered treatment failures, but the need for rescue therapy will 
not be considered an AE. Rescued subjects experiencing an AE at the time of rescue will be 
followed through stabilization or resolution of the AE or the end of the study (whichever 
comes last).  Rescued subjects should not be withdrawn from the study, but rather followed to 
resolution of signs and symptoms or until the Investigator has deemed the subject is stable.

Concomitant treatment with antibiotics at the discretion of the Investigator is allowed (with 
the exception of besifloxacin).  Medications routinely administered and not explicitly 
prohibit
ed in this protocol used as part of an uncomplicated cataract surgery procedure are 
allowed. These medications will be collected in the source documentation and are not 
c
aptured within the eCRF unless there is a change to the standard of care as documented in 
the source document.  Further, the routine medications administered as part of routine cataract 
surge
ry are not expected to be associated with treatment for AEs unless otherwise indicated.  
Note:  Any medication administered as part of the routine surgery that is ongoing subsequent 
to t
he surgical procedure, should be captured in the eCRF as a concomitant medication.

the study. 
 
6.3. STUDY PRODUCT USE COMPLIANCE  
 
Compliance will be assessed by [CONTACT_589175]. The site will document this comparison 
along with verification of the numbers of used and unused study product bottles. The numbers 
of missed doses as assessed at each clinic visit should be documented in the eCRF. 
 
6.4. DRUG ACCOUNTABILITY  
 
Sponsor study monitors or designees will conduct accountability of study product (KPI-121 or 
plac
ebo). Accountability will be ascertained by [CONTACT_589176]. 
 
Clinical trial materials will be shipped to the investigational sites under sealed conditions.  
Study product shipment records will be verified by [CONTACT_589177] a
ctual quantity of drug received at the site. Accurate records of receipt and disposition of 
the study product (e.g., dates, quantity, subject number, dose dispensed, returned) must be 
maintaine
d by [CONTACT_21438]/her designee. Study product will be stored in a secure 
area with limited access at 15-25C/59-77F with upper limit excursions to 30 C  /86F 
allowed.  
 
At the end of the study, all study materials, including any unused study product (KPI-[ADDRESS_775981] or placebo), as well as original containers (even if empty), will be returned to 
the drug packaging vendor in accordance with sponsor or designee’s standard operations 
proc
edures (SOPs), following approval by [CONTACT_1034]. All returns of study product will be 
doc
umented.  The study monitor or designee will verify drug accountability. All drug 
ac
counting procedures must be completed before the study is considered complete. 
 
6.5. MAINTENANCE OF RANDOMIZATION AND PROCEDURE FOR BREAKING THE CODE 
 
The sponsor, the project teams at the designated Contract Research Organizations (CROs ), 
a
nd investigative staff responsible for assessments of study endpoints will be masked to study 
product assignments. In case of medical emergency, or occurrence of an SAE, the 
KPI- 121-C-005 CLINICAL PROTOCOL INCORPORATING AMENDMENT 05 FINAL  P AGE 41 OF 65 
24 FEB  2017 
CONFIDENTIAL randomization code may be unmasked and made available to the Investigator, sponsor, and/or 
other personnel involved in the monitoring or conduct of this study. In the absence of medical 
need, the randomization code will not be available to the above individuals until after the 
study is completed and the database is locked.   
 
In the event of a medical need, the Investigator will treat each subject as needed. Since there 
is no 
specific antidote to KPI-121, immediate emergency unmasking is not necessary. If the 
I
nvestigator feels it is necessary to unmask a subject’s assignment after an emergency 
sit
uation, the Investigator may call the medical monitor and notify the sponsor. The study 
produ
ct assignment will be revealed on a subject- by- subject basis with the approval of the 
medic
al monitor and sponsor, thus leaving the masking of the remaining subjects intact. 
 
A r
andomization code will be computer-generated by [CONTACT_559042], Inc. or its 
de
signee.  
 
Randomization team members will work independently of other team members at the CRO. 
Study personnel, study subjects, the sponsor, and project teams at the CROs involved in the 
study will be masked to study product assignments.

 ADVERSE EVENT DEFINITIONS  
 
Adverse Event (AE):   A ny untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an 
investigational product in humans, whether or not considered drug related.   
 
Adverse Reaction (AR) : any AE caused by a drug. Adverse reactions are a subset of all 
suspec
ted adverse reactions where there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the event.  
 
Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR) :  
Any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE. F or the 
purposes of IND safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest 
a
 causal relationship between the drug and the AE. A SAR implies a lesser degree of certainty 
about ca
usality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug.  
 
Unexpec
ted:  An AE or SAR is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the 
I
nvestigator’s Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, 
if an Investigator’s  Brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk 
information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current 
application.   
 
L
ife-threatening:  An AE or SAR is considered “life-threatening” if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. 
It does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe 
for
m, might have caused death.  
 
  
KPI- 121-C-005 CLINICAL PROTOCOL INCORPORATING AMENDMENT 05 FINAL  P AGE 44 OF 65 
24 FEB  2017 
CONFIDENTIAL A SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT (SAE) is any AE or suspected adverse reaction occurring 
at any dose that:  
 
 R esults in death. 
 I s life-threatening. 
 R esults in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions. 
 R equires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
 P rolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 I s a significant medical event (i.e.,  one that may jeopardize the subject or may 
require intervention to prevent one or more of the other outcomes listed 
above). 
 
A NON
-SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT is any AE that does not meet the definitions for 
S
AEs as described above.  
 
Each AE  will be classified as  SERIOUS or NON-SERIOUS using  the definitions provided 
above. 
 
The SEVERITY of e ach AE will be classified as  MILD, MODERATE, or SEVERE.   
The Investigator  will review each event an d assess its RELATIONSHIP  to use  of 
investigational product  (unrelated, unlikely, possibly, probably, definitely). The AE will be 
a
ssessed using the following definitions : 
 
Unrelated:  
 Event occurring before dosing.  
 Event or intercurrent illness due wholly to factors other than investigational 
produ
ct use.  
 
Unl
ikely:  
 Poor temporal relationship with investigational product use.  
 Eve
nt easily explained by [CONTACT_1130]’s clinical state or other factors.  
 
Possible: 
 Reasonable temporal relationship with investigational product use. 
 Eve
nt could be explained by [CONTACT_1130]’s clinical state or other factors.  
 
Probable: 
 Reasonable temporal relationship with investigational product use.

 Distinct temporal relationship with investigational product use. 
 Know
n reaction to agent or chemical group, or predicted by [CONTACT_25046]. 
 Event cannot be explained by [CONTACT_1130]’s clinical state or other factors.  
 
8.3. PROCEDURES FOR AE REPORTING BY [CONTACT_589178], date and time of resolution, severity, seriousness, causality (relationship to 
use of investigational product), treatment required, and the outcome.   
To elicit AEs, simple questions with minimal suggestions or implications should be used as 
the init
ial questions at all evaluation points during the trial.  For example: 
 
 How  have you felt since your last assessment? 
 Ha ve you had any health problems since your last assessment? 
 
The severity of each AE should be categorized as mild, moderate, or severe. 
 
The causality of use of investigational product in relation to the AE will be assessed by [CONTACT_941] 
P
rincipal Investigator after careful medical consideration and categorized as unrelated, 
unli
kely, possible, probable, or definite. 
 
If an AE occurs, the Investigator will institute support and/or treat as deemed appropriate.   
I
f a non-SAE is unresolved at the time of the last day of the study, an effort will be made to 
follow up unti
l the AE is resolved or stabilized, the subject is lost to follow-up, or there is 
some other resolution of the event.  The Investigator should make every attempt to follow 
S
AEs to resolution.

Evaluable ( EE) population. Rescued subjects will be included in the EE  population if they did 
not have significant protocol deviations. 
 
The primary analysis of all ophthalmic efficacy measures will be based on a single study eye 
for each subject.  Each subject’s study eye will be defined as the surgery eye.  The set of

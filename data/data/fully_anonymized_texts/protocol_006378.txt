2/25/[ADDRESS_215802] postprandial vascular dysfunction by [CONTACT_182731] (NO●) bioavailability to the vascular endothelium. Our central hypothesis  is that  dairy milk 
ingestion by [CONTACT_182732] -induced vascular dysfunction through oxidative 
stress -dependent mechanisms that increase NO● bioavailability, independent of changes in blood pressure. 
To test this, we will complete the following objectives: 1) define NO●-mediated vasoprotection of non -fat 
milk on PPH -induced vascular dysfunction, 2) define the independent vasoprotective mechanisms of milk 
proteins on postprandial vascular function, and 3) define vasoprotection by [CONTACT_182733] f at on PPH -induced 
vascular dysfunction. Upon completing these studies, we expect to provide the first direct evidence that 
dairy milk, mediated through its vasoactive protein and lipid fractions, protects against vascular dysfunction 
otherwise induced by P PH. Thus, these studies will extend epi[INVESTIGATOR_182717].milk.   
II. Background and Rationale   
Background.  Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the US, accounting for 
~830,000 deaths annually.2 Oxidative stress and inflammation are central mechanisms leading to vascular 
dysfunction due to their ro le in reducing nitric oxide (NO●) bioavailability. Although greater intakes of low -
fat dairy foods have been associated with a lower incidence of CVD -related morbidity,3, [ADDRESS_215803] CVD, 
consistent with our controlled studies and those of others demonstrating that dairy attenuates vascular 
dysfunction independent of any changes in blood pressure.8-10 In the absence of this knowledge, the 
development and validation of dairy -based strategies to improve vascular homeostasis and mitigate CVD 
risk will remain limited, and its successful management will conti nue to be problematic.  
Dairy Improves VEF Independent Of Blood Pressure.  Observational studies support greater consumption 
of dairy foods to lower CVD risk. In support, a meta -analysis shows an inverse relation indicating 6% lower 
CVD risk per 200 mL/d of  milk intake.15 Although greater dairy intakes are linked to lower blood 
pressure,16-19 its blood pressure -lowering activities do not fully explain its role in reducing CVD -related 
morbidity.15, 20 Indeed, our clinical studies8, 11, 21 and others22, 23 show that dairy and its bioactive constituents 
may lower CVD risk by [CONTACT_182734] (VEF), glucose homeostasis, 
inflammation, and oxidative stress independent of changes in blood pressure.  
VEF Can Be Evaluated Non -Invasively.  Vascul ar dysfunction is an early atherosclerotic event26-[ADDRESS_215804]  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) 
  
2/25/2015  (FMD) has emerged as a validated ultrasound technique that non -invasively assesses  VEF to predict 
CVD,34, 35 even after controlling for various risk factors.36 FMD is responsive to lifestyle modifications,37, 
38 supporting its use for defining incremental changes in vascular health and CVD risk. FMD assessment 
involves causing brief reactive hyperemia using cuff occlusion distal to the ultrasound probe, as this cuff 
position better reflects endothelium -dependent vasodilation.39 Shear stress following cuff release stimulates 
luminal mechanoreceptors to initiate a signaling cascade that increases endothelial nitric oxide synthase 
(eNOS) -mediated NO● biosynthesis and vasodilation. Percent change in vessel diameter is  calculated 
relative to baseline vessel diameter to define FMD.  
Acute Hyperglycemia Increases CVD Risk.  Chronic hyperglycemia is known to increase CVD risk.41 
However, PPH better predicts CVD -related mortality compared to fasting glucose regardless of the  
presence of diabetes.42 PPH, but not fasting glucose, also correlates with carotid intima media thickness 
(cIMT),43-45 an index of atherosclerosis. Our clinical trials and those of others support PPH as a risk factor 
for CVD as evidenced by [CONTACT_182735] y impairing VEF in normo - and hyper -glycemic adults.1 That PPH 
is implicated in CVD provides clear rationale for validating dairy -based strategies for attenuating PPH -
induced vascular dysfunction.   
The mechanism by [CONTACT_182736], but as we reviewed,1 oxidative 
stress decreases NO● bioavailability.46-48 Using FMD, we show that PPH impairs VEF by [CONTACT_182737]● 
status in an oxidative stress -dependent manner.9 In a cross -over design, healthy men ingested glucose or 
fructose (75 g) prior to assessing VEF for 3 h postprandially. Glucose ingestion, but not fructose, increased 
plasma glucose and decreased FMD. Decreases in FMD correlated highly to postprandial glycemia (r = -
0.82), supporting that reducing PPH protects against va scular dysfunction. Malondialdehyde (MDA) 
increased to a greater extent following glucose ingestion. It also correlated to glycemic responses (r = 0.87), 
and inversely correlated to FMD (r = -0.80), supporting that PPH impairs VEF in an oxidative stress -
dependent manner. We also show that oxidative stress impairs VEF by [CONTACT_182738] (ADMA) relative to arginine (ARG).9 ADMA is an endogenously produced competitive 
inhibitor of eNOS that outcompetes ARG for eNOS -mediated synthesis of NO●.1 Increases in basal ADMA 
(~0.5 µM) by [CONTACT_182739] 0.1 µM increase CVD risk up to 5.3 -fold49 due to lower NO● status and greater 
vascular dysfunction.50 Our novel evidence shows that PPH -induced vascular dysfunction is accompanied 
by [CONTACT_182740]/ARG.9 Consistent with PPH, glucose ingestion decreases ARG to a greater 
extent than fructose. Although postprandial ADMA was unaffected, glucose caused greater time -dependent 
increases in ADMA/ARG than fructose. No time or trial effects occurred f or blood pressure. Thus, PPH 
reduces NO● synthesis by [CONTACT_182741], which limits 
substrate for NO● biosynthesis while competitively inhibiting eNOS.   
Oxidative stress also decreases NO● bioavailability by o xidizing tetrahydrobiopterin (BH 4) to 
dihydrobiopterin (BH 2), which limits BH 4 binding to eNOS and prevents NO● synthesis.51 In isolated 
endothelial cells, hyperglycemia decreases the BH 4/BH [ADDRESS_215805] by [CONTACT_182742]. For example, low endothelin -1 (ET -1) levels are considered 
vasodilatory, but their increase during acute hyperglycemia56 triggers oxidative stress by [CONTACT_182743], resulting in eNOS uncoupling that reduces NO● synthesis.54, 55 Similarly, thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2) 
increases oxidative stress via protein kinase C -dependent activation of NADPH oxidase, which impairs 
eNOS -dependent NO● synthesis and VEF.[ADDRESS_215806] methylglyoxal (MGO), a precursor of advanced glycation end -
products, in increasing CVD risk.56, 57 MGO is higher in diabetics58 and increases during PPH.59, 60 It also 
promotes mitochondrial dysfunction that increases free radical generation.61 This impairs NO● synthesis by 
[CONTACT_182744] 4,[ADDRESS_215807]  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) 
  
2/25/2015  Milk Mitigates PPH -Associated Vascular Dysfunction.  Milk induces a low glycemic response,63 
highlighting its potential to limit P PH and downstream responses that impair VEF.1 Our double -blind, cross -
over trial in metabolic syndrome (MetS) adults examined the extent to which low -fat milk limits PPH -
mediated disturbances in oxidative stress and NO● bioavailability.8 Participants inges ted low -fat milk (2 
cups) or an isocaloric volume of rice milk prior to evaluating FMD and metabolic responses for 3 h 
postprandially. Plasma glucose increased by 17 -38% at 30 -120 min relative to baseline following rice milk 
ingestion.8 In comparison, low -fat milk increased plasma glucose by 11% at 30 min, which returned to 
fasting levels by 60 min. MDA increased by 17 -33% at 30 -120 min relative to baseline while FMD 
decreased by 37 -47% at [ADDRESS_215808], MDA and FMD we re 
unaffected by [CONTACT_6398] -fat milk. Relative to baseline, ADMA/ARG increased at 60 -180 min following rice milk 
suggesting a decrease in NO● bioavailability. In comparison, ADMA/ARG decreased at 30 min and returned 
to levels no different than baseline by 60 min following low -fat milk ingestion. No time or trial effects were 
observed for blood pressure. These data support that low -fat milk ingestion at a volume consistent with the 
US Dietary Guidelines37 maintains VEF, without affecting blood pressure, by [CONTACT_182745]-dependent 
oxidative stress responses that reduce NO● bioavailability.    
Milk Peptides Improve VEF.  Dairy contains bioactive constituents that improve VEF.12 Whey and casein 
represent ~20% and 80% of milk proteins,[ADDRESS_215809] vasoactive propertie s, but whey has received 
more extensive study.71-73 We showed that NOP -47, a whey -derived peptide, improves postprandial VEF.11 
In a placebo -controlled cross -over study in adults, whey peptide (5 g) ingestion increased FMD at 30 -90 
min compared to fasting levels. Improved VEF was accompanied by [CONTACT_182746]● 
metabolites, suggesting that NOP -47 improves VEF in a NO● dependent manner. In support, mesenteric 
arteries incubated with whey peptide have greater endothelium -dependent relaxati on that is abolished by 
[CONTACT_182747].[ADDRESS_215810], little is known about the vasoactivities of casein. Supplementation of a casein -
derived lactotripeptide compared to sodium caseinate improved FMD in normotensive postmenopausal 
women.81 Further compli cating are the lack of studies directly comparing vasoactivities of whey protein 
and casein, a knowledge gap this application will address by [CONTACT_182748].   
In conclusion , evidence shows that: 1) PPH increases CVD risk, 2) lowering PPH and oxidative stress 
mitigates vascular dysfunction in a NO●-dependent manner, and 3) dairy attenuates oxidative stress and 
PPH, which likely protects against vascular dysfunction by [CONTACT_182749]● bioavailability. This provides a 
compelling basis to study vasoprotective activities of dairy milk. In addition, our team has the expertise 
needed to perform controlled interventions that assess VEF, oxidative stress, and NO● homeostasis, thereby 
[CONTACT_182750].  
Anticipated Results, Significance, and Potential Benefit  
Most studies examining dairy -dependent v asoprotection have focused on its anti -hypertensive activities 
with limited regard for other mechanisms that could improve VEF. While important, and as we discuss,12 
blood pressure -lowering activities of dairy are unlikely to fully explain its role in redu cing CVD risk. Thus, 
expected findings from the proposed randomized controlled, cross -over trials are anticipated to be 
paradigm -shifting by [CONTACT_182751], and its protein and lipid 
fractions, to reductions in PP H-induced oxidative stress responses that otherwise limit NO● bioavailability 
and increase CVD risk. Findings of this application are also expected to provide the first evidence attributing 
the relative vasoprotective activities of whey protein, casein, an d dairy fat on PPHinduced vascular 
dysfunction in association with improvements in oxidative stress and NO● homeostasis. These collective 
findings are also directly translatable into evidenced -based recommendations supporting forthcoming 
revisions to the U S Dietary Guidelines regarding dairy consumption.

2/25/2015  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_182718], we do not anticipate any conceptual or technical difficulties in this 
application.   
III. Procedures  Study Design  
This IRB protocol addresses three  objectives by [CONTACT_182752] -over studies in 
two separate cohorts of participants. For clarity, Study 1  is a 4 -arm cross -over study that addresses the 
work under Objectives 1 and 2  and will utilize one cohort of participants. Study 2 is a separate 3 -arm 
cross -over study that addresses the work under Objective 3  and will utilize a different cohort of 
participants. Each study aims to enroll 24 participants for a total of 48 participants for all of the 
anticipated work.   
  
Studies un der Objectives 1 and 2 will be accomplished through a common 4 -arm crossover study. For 
Objective 1 , which will examine the inhibition of non -fat milk on PPH -induced vascular dysfunction, 
prediabetic men and women (n = 24) in the fasted state will ingest 7 5 g glucose dissolved in water or nonfat 
milk (2 cups; 473 mL) on two occasions separated by ≥[ADDRESS_215811] beverage ingestion to examine VEF and 
biomarkers re gulating NO● bioavailability. In Objective [ADDRESS_215812] glucose (75 g) with isonitrogenous quantities of 
whey protein isolate or sodium caseinate (16.5 g in 473  mL water) on two occasions separated by ≥7 d. 
Identical to Objective 1, FMD and blood samples will be obtained at 30 min intervals for 3 h. For Objective 
3, which will define vasoprotective activities of dairy fat, a separate cohort of prediabetic men and  women 
(n = 24) will complete a 3 -arm cross -over study by [CONTACT_182753] (75 g), or glucose with non -fat milk 
or whole milk (2 cups; 473 mL) on three occasions separated by ≥7 d. Identical to Objectives 1 -2, FMD 
and blood samples will be obtained at 30 min intervals for 3 h.   
Sampling Criteria and Methods  
Enrollment Criteria.  Prediabetic men and women are an ideal study population because of their underlying 
vascular dysfunction and exacerbated PPH.82 They will be required to meet these inclusion  criteria : a) 
prediabetes (fasting glucose 100 -125 mg/dL and hemoglobin A1c 5.7 -6.4%83), b) 18 -50 y of age, c) non -
dietary supplement user, c) no medications affecting vasodilation, inflammation, or energy metabolism, e) 
no CVD, and f) nonsmoker. To improve  homogeneity, we will only enroll individuals having blood pressure 
<140/90 mmHg and total cholesterol <240 mg/dL. Those having any of these exclusion criteria  will not be 
enrolled: a) unstable weight (±2 kg), b) vegetarian or dairy allergy, c) alcohol int ake >3 drinks/d or >10 
drinks/wk), d) ≥7 h/wk of aerobic activity, or e) women who are pregnant, lactating, or have initiated or 
changed birth control in the past 3 -mo. For all studies, the washout period will be 7 d for men and 1 mo for 
women because wome n require vascular testing at the same time during their menstrual cycle to account 
for known changes in vascular reactivity.84   
Recruitment . We will recruit participants through posted flyers, e -mail, electronic and newsprint 
advertisements (e.g. campus student and faculty/staff newspapers, local and regional newspapers), word of 
mouth, and through use of ResearchMatch (OSU CCTS). The posted advertisements will instruct interested 
participants to call the study center (Bruno Laboratory, Department of Huma n Sciences) to obtain further 
information. During the phone -in hours, a trained individual (i.e. project coordinator or graduate assistant) 
will be available to describe the study and determine preliminary qualification by [CONTACT_14664] a scripted 
phone inter view (e.g. do you take vitamin supplements?, are you healthy?; see attached Phone Script ). The 
individual will record answers and assess whether or not the person calling is likely or not to be an 
acceptable study participant. If the caller and the intervi ewer agree that the caller should participate, the 
prospective participant will be invited to a screening meeting, where the study will be fully described and 
the individual will be provided a consent form to complete prior to any involvement in the study procedures. 
THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY  Institutional Review Board  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) 
  
2/25/2015  Data collected during this phase will include participant’s age, health status, physical activity, and contact 
[CONTACT_3031] (see Informed Consent ). Women will be asked to complete a short questionnaire regarding their 
menstrual history (see Mens trual History Questionnaire ).  
Recruiting efforts through ResearchMatch will utilize a strategy whereby [CONTACT_182754] -identifiable volunteer profile in the system. 
Unidentified in dividuals meeting search criteria will then be forwarded an electronic recruitment message 
(see attached ResearchMatch Recruitment Message ) that identifies them as a potential match for study 
participation. The secure ResearchMatch clearinghouse will route  this standard notification that provides 
specific study content (i.e. content similar to that of a posted advertisement) to each of these potential 
ResearchMatch volunteers who will then have the option of replying “yes”, “no”, or not respond through a 
set of quick links available in this notification.  Note:  This message will not include the study’s direct 
contact [CONTACT_3031] (e.g. email, phone) as ResearchMatch will measure the response rate through the 
clearinghouse’s quick links made available in this electronic message. The response rate metrics will be 
made available to researchers through their ResearchMatch dashboard as well as the Institutional Liaison 
dashboards. By [CONTACT_182755] “yes”, the volunteer has authorized ResearchMatch to release their cont act 
information to the researcher responsible for the study. This information will be made available on the 
researcher’s ResearchMatch study dashboard. The researcher will be responsible for managing this contact 
[CONTACT_182756] -approve d study protocol. ResearchMatch will also be collecting 
aggregate data regarding the status of ResearchMatch volunteers within the study. ResearchMatch 
volunteers consent to this within the ResearchMatch volunteer agreement. The ResearchMatch enrollment 
continuum will allow researchers to indicate where the volunteer currently stands within the recruitment 
process and thus helps researchers monitor the utility and effectiveness of this recruiting tool. Research 
access to recruit through ResearchMatch will l ast only as long as the duration of IRB -study approval with 
the expi[INVESTIGATOR_182719] -date of OSU IRB approval. Researchers 
will be able to submit current IRB -approval letters for the lifetime of the study and thus pro vide evidence 
of successful continuing review applications. If an unintentional lapse in time occurs and the research is not 
able to submit this continuing review evidence via ResearchMatch, stored ResearchMatch data will not be 
deleted, but the researcher  will not have access to this information until a current IRB -approval letter is 
uploaded and routed to the Institutional Liaison for review. A complete description of ResearchMatch along 
with the most current IRB approval from Vanderbilt University (i.e. this is the site where ResearchMatch 
was developed and its secure computer servers are housed) has been attached.  
Power Calculation and Statistics.  A power calculation was performed to determine the fewest participants 
needed to complete the two separate proposed cross -over studies (i.e. Objectives 1 -2 and Objective 3 ). We 
used FMD data from our studies9, [ADDRESS_215813] the null hypothesis with 80% power ( P<0.05). Thus, 24 male and 
female prediabetics will be enrolled to improve statistical power to >90% while also accounting for study 
attrition that may  occur due to women requiring a longer washout period between trials (1 mo vs. 7 d). 
Although participants will complete all arms of each cross -over study, statistical analysis will be handled 
discretely to examine differences between trials within each Objective . Baseline comparisons between trials 
will be performed a paired t -test ( Objectives 1 -2) or [ADDRESS_215814] RM ANOVA ( Objective 3 ) to ensure no changes 
in participant health status. Other analyses will be performed by [ADDRESS_215815] RM ANOVA to define time and 
treatme nt effects, and their interaction. In the presence of any significant effects, Bonferroni's post -test will 
be used to examine pair -wise differences. To better define postprandial responses between treatments, area 
under the curve (AUC 0-3 h) will be calcula ted for each biomarker to enable more sensitive comparisons of 
postprandial responses between treatments and simplify analyses to a paired t -test ( Objectives 1 -2) or [ADDRESS_215816] ANOVA ( Objective 3 ) as we described.9, [ADDRESS_215817]  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) 
  
2/25/[ADDRESS_215818] of 75 g glucose in 473 mL water vs. 75 
g glucose in 473 mL non -fat milk. This  volume of milk was chosen to be consistent with our work8 and 
recommendations of the US Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The amount of glucose administered (75  
g) is equivalent to that of a standard oral glucose challenge. We fully acknowledge that test  beverages in 
Objective [ADDRESS_215819] of glucose (75 g; positive control) vs. glucose (75 g) ingested with non -fat milk or whole milk. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_182720], experimental evidence is lacking to support: 1) 
widespread restrictions of fat -containing dairy foods, and 2) that dairy fat, which is predominately saturated 
fat, is causatively responsible for increasing CVD risk. This approach will enable an interpretation of the 
contribution of dairy fat in protecting against PPH -induced VED whi le providing findings to fill this 
research knowledge gap.   
Dietary Control.  Participants’ basal diets will be controlled for 3 d leading into each trial, consistent with 
our other successful postprandial studies.8-10 A 3-d energy adequate, but dairy -free diet will be developed 
to provide 50 -60% of energy from carbohydrate, 15 -20% from protein, and 25 -30% from fat. To normalize 
physiologic responses to test beverages, diets will contain >150 g of carbohydrate/d. Diets will also contain 
1.5 servings per day  of fruit and 1.5 servings/d of vegetables to improve homogeneity of participants’ 
antioxidant status while also being consistent with American dietary patterns in that ~7080% of adults do 
not consume the recommended 5 servings/d of fruits and vegetables.87, 88 Fruit/vegetable choices by 
[CONTACT_182757] (e.g. standardizing citrus vs. non -citrus 
foods due to differences in vitamin C). All foods and beverages will be provided to participants for 3 d 
preceding each trial. In addition to controlling fruit/vegetable intake, participants’ dietary nitrate/nitrite will 
also be restricted to <100 mg/d by [CONTACT_182758].89, [ADDRESS_215820] for the 3 d preceding each trial. 
Accuracy will be confirmed by a dietitian and nutrient intakes assessed using NDSR dietary analysis 
software (University of Minnesota). Consistent with our work,8-10 and our experience in assessing FMD,1 
VEF assessments will be standardized by [CONTACT_182759]  (e.g. caffeine, alcohol, niacin supplements) for 48 h preceding each trial.   
Detailed Study Procedures    
Overview of Study Procedures . Potential participants who call the study center for more information as 
well as those identified through ResearchMatch will be given a brief description of the study and asked a 
few questions to determine their eligibility ( see Phone Script Study 1 (Obje ctives 1 and 2); Phone Script 
Study 2 (Objective 3) ). If they meet the initial study criteria, they will be invited to the study center for a 
screening meeting. During this meeting, the Informed Consent (attached) will be explained and provided to 
them for  their review. The participant will then have the opportunity to review the Informed Consent, and 
if he/she chooses to participate in the study, will be asked to provide written consent. Women choosing to 
participate will also be asked to self -administer a  urinary pregnancy test. If women self -report that the 
pregnancy test is negative, they will fill out a short questionnaire regarding their menstrual history ( see 
Menstrual History Questionnaire ), so that each controlled intervention is completed at the sa me phase of 
the female participant’s menstrual cycle, consistent with standardized guidelines for vascular testing.[ADDRESS_215821]. 
Participants under Objectives 1 and 2 will then complete four 3 h postp randial trials in a randomized order; 
THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY  Institutional Review Board  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) 
  
2/25/2015  participants under Objective 3 will then complete three 3 h postprandial trials, also in a randomized order. 
We estimate that completion of all study procedures will take ~4 -6 weeks for men and ~4 -6 months for 
women. E ach step of the study procedure will be discussed in detail below:  
Screening Meeting.  Potential participants who have met the initial criteria of the study (based on the 
telephone interview) will be invited to the study center at a mutually convenient tim e. During this time, the 
participant and a member of the research team will meet in a private, quiet conference room or office. The 
individual will be provided the informed consent form, and its contents will be described to the potential 
participant. The participant will then have the opportunity to review it, and if they choose to participate in 
the study, they will be asked to provide written consent. Although the participant will be asked to sign the 
informed consent, the participant will be told that t hey will not be asked to participate if their fasting serum 
chemistries do not meet the study criteria. If the participant has provided consent and is fasted for [ADDRESS_215822] if a trained individual can draw a small blood sample (15 ml; 1 T) so th at we may measure 
blood chemistries (glucose and cholesterol) as well as perform a finger prick to obtain a small drop of blood 
to measure hemoglobinA1c (HbA1c). All samples will be coded to maintain participant anonymity. We will 
also assess blood pressur e. If the blood pressure of the participant is >140/[ADDRESS_215823] strip to ensure that only non -pregnant women are included in 
this study.   
Potential participants will be called within a few days of their screening meeting to provide them with their 
blood results and inform them of their eligibility to participate in the study. Consistent with our CLIA 
exemption, blood results will be provided in a categorical manner (i.e. “normal”, “marginally high”, “high”) 
rather than providing actual bl ood concentrations of lab values. Potential participants having any blood 
values outside of the “normal range” will be directed/encouraged to follow -up with their own physician. 
Those having blood values within acceptable limits (see Inclusion/Exclusion cr iteria), will be invited to 
participate in the study. Subjects will be included or excluded based on a best fit of the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria (an example of best fit would be if a potential subject says they exercise 8 h/wk, which is 
close to our  exclusion criteria of 7 h/wk, they might still be included in the study if they meet all other 
inclusion and exclusion criteria more closely than other potential subjects). Participants will be read one 
phone script if they qualify and another phone scrip t if they do not qualify (see Participant Eligibility Phone 
Script ). Potential participants who qualify for the study will be communicated a message as follows: I have 
your screening results. Congratulations, you meet the eligibility criteria for our clini cal trial. Your fasting 
blood chemistries of glucose, hemoglobin A1c, and cholesterol were all within the specified range. Your 
glucose falls in the [category], hemoglobinA1c falls in the [category], and cholesterol falls in the [category]. 
A summary of yo ur results has been prepared for you, which you will receive when you come in for your 
trials. We look forward to and are thankful for your participation. Potential participants who do not qualify 
will be provided the following message: I have your screeni ng results. Unfortunately, you do not meet the 
eligibility criteria for our clinical trial. Your glucose, hemoglobin A1c, and cholesterol were not within the 
eligible range. Your glucose falls in the [category], hemoglobinA1c falls in the [category], and c holesterol 
falls in the [category]. A summary of your results has been prepared for you. Please let me know if you 
would like to drop by [CONTACT_182760] a hard copy of your information or if you would like them 
emailed to you. Thank you so much  for your time and effort. All individuals regardless of study eligibility 
will be encouraged to consider sharing these results with their physician.   
In the event that a participant is telephoned and is unavailable, a message will be left requesting a cal lback 
at a convenient time or that at a member of the study team will try calling again at a later time. No 
confidential or sensitive information will be shared with third parties or left on answering machines.

2/25/[ADDRESS_215824] Trials.  Each participant in studies u nder Objectives 1 and 2 will complete a 4 -arm, randomized, cross -
over study.  On 4 occasions separated by ≥7 d for men and 1 mo for women (women require vascular 
testing at the same time during their menstrual cycle to account for known changes in vascular  reactivity), 
participants will report in the fasted state (10 -12 hours) to the study center. In Objective 1, participants 
will ingest 75 g glucose dissolved in water or non -fat milk (2 cups; 473 mL). In Objective 2, participants 
will ingest 75 g glucose w ith isonitrogenous quantities of whey protein isolate of sodium caseinate (16.5 
g in 473 mL water). In Objective 3, a separate cohort of men and women will complete a [ADDRESS_215825] 75 g glucose alone or 75 g glucose dissolved in non -fat milk or whole milk (2 
cups; 473 mL). This volume of milk was chosen to be consistent with our work and recommendations of 
the US Dietary Guidelines  for Americans. For Objective 2, protein is being administered at 16.[ADDRESS_215826] total protein of non -fat milk, rather than their proportional contributions in milk. The amount of 
glucose included in each mixed beverage (75 g) is equivalent to the dose of a clinical oral glucose 
challenge, which we and others have routinely shown to induce PPH, oxidative stress, and VED. Then, at 
30 minute intervals during the 3 hour postprandial period, we will assess brachial artery flow -mediated 
dilation (FMD) via non -invasive ultrasonagraphy and blood biomarkers. To ensure that the order by [CONTACT_182761], a random sequence generator 
(http://www.random.org/sequences/) will be used to determine the order by [CONTACT_182762]. While the trials will be conducted in a randomized order, for simplicity, they 
have been listed as Trials 1 – 4 below for Objectives 1 and 2 and Trials 1 – [ADDRESS_215827] access to use the 
restroom as needed in -between collection points.  
Objectives 1 and 2   
The 4 -arm, randomized, cross -over study under these objectives will be completed by a separate cohort of 
prediabetic men and women from those described under Objective 3.  
Trial 1 : On the morning of testing, subjects will arrive at the laboratory after abs taining from food for [ADDRESS_215828] 
procedures. A finger prick will be performed to measure baseline hemoglobinA1c (HbA1c) and a flexible 
catheter will be inserted into a for earm vein. After a [ADDRESS_215829] stopcock connected to the end of the catheter. Blood will be collected with 
a syringe and transferred to appropriate tubes for processing and subsequent det ermination of fasting

and carotid intima media thickness (cIMT) using ultrasound (described below). Following these baseline 
measurements, participants will  ingest [ADDRESS_215830] -ingestion at 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 minutes. Blood samples will be

Objective 3   
The 3 -arm, randomized, cross -over study under this objective will be completed by a separate cohort of 
prediabetic men and wom en from those described under Objectives 1 and 2.  
Trial 1 : A separate cohort of participants will visit our study center for Objective 3. On the morning of 
testing, subjects will arrive at the laboratory after abstaining from food and beverage except wate r for [ADDRESS_215832] stopcock connected to the end of the catheter. Blood will be collected with a syringe and 
transferred to appropriate tubes for processing and subsequent determination of fasting biochemica l 
measurements. We will then perform fasting measurements of flow -mediated dilation (FMD) and carotid 
intima media thickness (cIMT) using ultrasound (described below). Following these baseline 
measurements, participants will ingest [ADDRESS_215833] -ingestion at 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 minutes. Blood samples will be 
collected at 0 min (immediately prior to eating) and at 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and [ADDRESS_215834] will perform all cannula insertions, needle sticks, and blood collections.  
Trial 2 : Participants will visit our study center again, and will complete the procedure as described above 
(Trial 1)  with the exception that they will ingest glucose (75 g) dissolved in non -fat milk.  
Trial 3 : Participants will visit our study center again, and will complete the procedure as described above 
(Trial 1) with the exception that they will ingest glucose (75 g) dissolved in whole milk.  
Brachial Artery Flow -Mediated Dilation (FMD).  FMD will be measured to assess vascular endothelial 
function as a functional index of the impact of each beverage’s ingestion on arterial blood flow. In brief, 
FMD is determined by a blinded, trained research assistant using an Acuson 13 MHz linear array transducer 
and a cardiac ultrasound system. Echocardiogram (ECG) is used to monitor heart rate throughout the 
procedure. Prior to testing, the participant is resting in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_19636] [ADDRESS_215835] below the antecubital 
fossa (crease of the elbow). The procedure is initiated by [CONTACT_182763] (30 sec) of the brachial 
artery, followed by [CONTACT_182764] (5 min) using the aforementioned inflatable cuff. The cuff is then 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_182721] -occlusion ultrasound images are collected for [ADDRESS_215836] -occlusion peak blood fl ow velocity will also be collected 
simultaneously to normalize FMD responses to shear -stress (i.e. post -occlusion blood flow).   
Carotid Intima Media Thickness (cIMT).  cIMT will be measured at baseline of each trial to assess vascular 
endothelial function.  While anticipated to be unchanged during the study, its assessment will allow for its 
consideration as a statistical co -variate in defining physiologic responses to test beverages. Images of the 
right - and left -sided far wall of the common carotid artery will be recorded for ~[ADDRESS_215837]  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) 
  
2/25/2015  is defined by [CONTACT_182765] ≥50% greater than that of the surrounding vesse l 
wall or ≥1.[ADDRESS_215838] the data. Only a study code w ill be used to identify participants. At 
each time point, a blood sample (15 mL; 1 tablespoons x 7 time points = 105 mL or ~0.5 cups) will be 
collected into evacuated blood collection tubes. Throughout the span of the study which consists of the 
acute inge stion of 4 types of beverages for Objectives 1 and 2 and 1 screening day, we will be collecting a 
total of ~435 mL or ~2 cups of blood. For Objective 3, occurring in a separate cohort, consists of the acute 
ingestion of 3 types of beverages and 1 screening  day, we will be collecting a total of ~330 mL or ~1.5 cups 
of blood.  
During each trial, plasma will be obtained by [CONTACT_7891], and then transferred to cryogenic storage 
tubes.  Tubes will be stored at -80° C until analysis can be completed.  Analyses  will include plasma 
glucose, insulin, triglyceride, total cholesterol, metabolites of NO (nitrite/nitrate), vasoactive markers 
(arginine, asymmetric dimethylarginine, tetrahydrobiopterin, dihydrobiopterin, endothelin -1, 11dehydro 
thromboxane B 2), antioxid ants (vitamins E and C) and markers of oxidative stress (malondialdehyde and 
methylglyoxal). Remaining plasma sample aliquots not used for these analyses will be archived for [ADDRESS_215839] the right to refuse our use of these specimens for future analyses. Lastly, 
approval from OSU IRB will be sought via a protocol amendment prior to the analysis of any additional 
biomarkers not specified herein.  
Privacy/Confidentiality . For all data and records that are a part of this study, a number (i.e. code) will be 
assigned to each participant , and will only be available to research personnel.  Any records containing the 
names of participants will be stored in a locked filing cabinet or on a password protected computer in the 
PI’s laboratory or office. Research personnel under the supervision o f the PI [INVESTIGATOR_182722]. The names of participants will not be used for 
publication in any form.  The records will be maintained until the data are published, up to a maximum of 
five yea rs. All archived samples will be coded, but the key linking the code to each participant’s identifiable 
information will have been destroyed. In addition, participants will be instructed that their participation in 
this study is voluntary and that they may  withdraw at any time without prejudice. Data (food records and 
biochemical values) obtained from this study will stored on a computer in the PI’s laboratory. In addition, 
a back up of digital data will be stored on the PI’s computer in his office. Both co mputers are password 
protected and both doors are locked when they are not in use.  
Measurement / Instrumentation  
For all Objectives, the below procedures will be utilized. All biomarkers and functional indices of vascular 
health will be assessed prior to  (0 min) and at [ADDRESS_215840] beverage unless otherwise noted. Other parameters will be measured during participant 
screening and/or at baseline (0 min) for each trial, as indicated.  
Anthropometri c Parameters and Blood Pressure.  At screening and postprandially, participants will rest 
for [ADDRESS_215841]  circumference will be assessed at the level 
of the umbilicus using a nonflexible measuring tape.   
Serum Chemistries.  Plasma triglyceride, total cholesterol, glucose, and insulin will be measured by [CONTACT_182766] (Pointe Scientific) or ELISA (ALPCO) at s creening and throughout the [ADDRESS_215842]  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) 
  
2/25/2015  be measured by [CONTACT_182767]. Insulin resistance at baseline and screening will be calculated as: [(fasting 
glucose (mmol/L) * fasting insulin (µIU/mL)/22.5].[ADDRESS_215843] the transducer during all visits. Baseline artery 
diameter will be recorded for 60 heartbeats. Then, a blood pressure cuff placed on the forearm immediately 
distal to the  olecranon process will be rapi[INVESTIGATOR_182723] (200 mmHg, 5 min). VEF will 
be measured following distal occlusion because this better reflects endothelial -dependent and NO●-
mediated vascular dilation compared to upper arm occlusion.97 Upon cuff release, arterial diameter will be 
assessed for 300 heartbeats (~5 min). Brachial artery images will be obtained using a 13 MHz linear array 
transducer and Terason T3000 ultrasound system. Image analysis will be performed using edge -detection 
softw are (Vascular Research Tools). Peak post -occlusion diameter will be calculated by [CONTACT_182768], and averaging vessel diameters ±5 frames surrounding the peak. FMD is calculated as a percentage 
of baseline diameter and normalized to shear stres s. FMD will be performed by [CONTACT_182769] a blinded manner. Our studies show 
that FMD responses between technicians are not different ( P>0.05; CV <8%).  
Ultrasound studies will a lso be performed as we describe40 to define CVD risk by [CONTACT_182770] (cIMT) using established criteria.[ADDRESS_215844] beverages. Images of the right - and left -sided far wall of the common carotid artery will 
be recorded for ~10 heartbeats and analyzed using edge -detection software to obtain mean, maximum, and 
minimum lumen diameter, and cIMT. Plaque is defined by [CONTACT_182765] 
≥50% greater than that of the surrounding vessel wall or ≥1.[ADDRESS_215845] from the 
adjacent boundary.98   
Vasoactive Markers.  Nitrite/nitrate, the stable end -metabolites of NO●, will be measured to define NO● 
status using a spectrophotometric kit (Cayman Chemical).[ADDRESS_215846] assessment of eNOS activity in humans 
is not practical because of its degree of invasiveness. Instead, it will  be assessed indirectly by [CONTACT_182771]/ARG by [CONTACT_5004] -FL as we describe11 and the BH 4/BH [ADDRESS_215847]. F. Villamena.101 
We will also asse ss inhibitors of eNOS, i.e. plasma ET -1 and 11 -dehydro -TXB 2 by [CONTACT_6428] (Cayman 
Chemical).  
Antioxidants/Oxidative Stress.  We show that PPH does not affect plasma antioxidants, but increases lipid 
peroxidation.[ADDRESS_215848] that induces oxidative 
stress, will be measured as we described by [CONTACT_5004] -FL9 and HPLC -UV59 throughout the 3 -h postprandial 
period for each trial.   
Internal Validity    
For all data and records that are a part of this study, a number (i.e. code) will be assigned to each participant. 
Test confections will be assigned a code as well. This will minimize measurement bias when performing 
analysis on dietary records, and bioch emical markers because all samples/records will be coded. The codes 
will only be broken once data analysis has been completed and verified by [CONTACT_978].  
Data Analysis  
Baseline comparisons between trials will be performed a paired t -test ( Objectives 1 -2) or [ADDRESS_215849] RM 
ANOVA ( Objective 3 ) to ensure no changes in participant health status. Other analyses will be performed by 
[CONTACT_182772]  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) 
  
2/25/[ADDRESS_215850] s, and their interaction. In the presence of any significant 
effects, Bonferroni's post -test will be used to examine pair -wise differences. To better define postprandial 
responses between treatments, area under the curve (AUC 0-3 h) will be calculated for e ach biomarker to enable 
more sensitive comparisons of postprandial responses between treatments and simplify analyses to a paired t -
test ( Objectives 1 -2) or [ADDRESS_215851] ANOVA ( Objective 3 ) as we described.9, [ADDRESS_215852] repeated measures.85

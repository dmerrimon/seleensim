This amendment is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) of 
Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and  the Council of the European Union.  
Main Rationale for the Amendment:  
Results of Part [ADDRESS_1192972] -marketing experience with both mRNA -1273 and 
mRNA -1273.222 in adolescents has not identified  any new safety concerns . Therefore, the safety 
follow -up duration for participants in Part 3 was reduced from 1 year to 6 months for those 
receiving a single dose and for those participants receiving Dose 2, from 6 months to  1 month 
following Dose  2.

Confidential  Page 17 Part 1 Overall Study Design  
This is a three -part, Phase 2/3, study: P art 1A, Part 1B, and Part 1C. The study will evaluate the safety, 
reactogenicity, and effectiveness of mRNA -1273 SARS -CoV -2 vaccine in healthy adolescents 12  to 
<18 years of age.  
Participants in Part 1A, the Blinded Phase, will be randomly assigned to rece ive injections of either 
100 µg mRNA -1273 vaccine or a placebo control in a 2:1 randomization ratio.  Part 1B, the Open -label 
Observational Phase of this study, is designed to offer participants who received placebo in Part 1A of 
this study, and who meet Emergency Use Authorization ( EUA ) eligibility criteria, an option to receive 
mRNA -[ADDRESS_1192998] a  booster dose ( BD) (50 µg) of mRNA -1273. Part 1C -2, the Heterologous Booster Phase, is 
designed to provide a BD (50  µg) of mRNA -1273 to eligible participants who completed primary  
coronavirus disease 2019  [COVID -19] vaccination  series with a non-Moderna  vaccine under EUA and 
are at least [ADDRESS_1192999] dose.  
The goal of the study is to seek an indication for use of mRNA -1273 (100 µg intramuscular [ IM], given 
as 2 injections, 28 days apart) in the 12 to <  18 years age gro up. The basis for demonstrating vaccine 
effectiveness is proposed to be met by [CONTACT_856799]  (Ab) response measured in this adolescent age 
group. The approach to inferring vaccine effectiveness will depend on whether an accepted serum Ab 
threshold conferr ing protection against COVID -19 has been established. If an Ab threshold of 
protection has been established, effectiveness will be inferred based on the proportion of adolescent 
study participants with serum Ab levels (on Day  57) that meet or exceed the Ab  threshold. If an Ab 
threshold of protection has not been established, effectiveness will be inferred by [CONTACT_856800] (i) geometric mean ( GM) value of serum neutralizing antibody ( nAb) and (ii) 
the seroresponse rate ( SRR) from a dolescent participants compared with those from young adults ( 18 
to 25  years of age) enrolled in the ongoing clinical endpoint efficacy trial (Study  P301).  
Part 1A, the Blinded Phase - Randomized, Observer -Blind, Placebo -Controlled  
This study in adolescent s will monitor all participants for a total of 12 months following the second 
dose of vaccine or placebo. Safety assessments will include solicited ARs; 7  days after each injection), 
unsolicited AEs; 28  days after each injection,  medically attended adverse  events  (MAAEs ), serious 
adverse events ( SAEs ), and  adverse events of special interest  (AESIs ) including multisystem 
inflammatory syndrome in children [ MIS-C]) throughout the study period.  
Blood samples will be collected from all participants at baseline (Day  1), Day  57 (28  days after 
Dose  2), Day  209 (6 months after Dose  2), and Day  394 for measurement of  Severe Acute Respi[INVESTIGATOR_513150] 2  (SARS -CoV -2) specific binding  antibody (bAb)  and nAb responses. Blood 
samples will also be tested for th e development of Ab directed against nonvaccine antigen (eg, Ab 
against the nucleocapsid protein), which will signify infection with SARS -CoV -2. 
The incidence of SARS -CoV -2 infection among vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_856754] s the potential for mRNA -1273 to reduce the rate of infection in vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
Part 1A comprises 8  scheduled visits including a Screening Visit and 7  scheduled visits, of which Visit 
2 and Visit 4 will be virtual/telephone visits and the other visits  will be in -clinic visits. This study will 
be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ), and all applicable 
regulatory requirements.

Part 1B, the Open -label Observational Phase of th e study, will be prompted by [CONTACT_856801] a 
COVID -19 vaccine under an EUA for any persons under the age of 18  years. Participants will be 
transitioned to Part 1B of the study as their age group becomes EUA -eligible. This transition permits 
all ongo ing study participants to eventually be informed of the availability and eligibility criteria of any 
COVID -19 vaccine made available under an EUA and the option to offer all ongoing study participants 
an opportunity to schedule a Participant Decision Visit  to know their original treatment assignment 
(placebo vs. mRNA -1273 100 µg vaccine).  
Part 1B provides the opportunity for study participants to be informed regarding the EUA, be 
unblinded to their original assignment (mRNA -1273 or placebo), and for those who previously 
received placebo to actively request to receive 2 doses of mRNA -1273 (100 µg) vaccine. EUA -eligible 
study participants will receive a notification letter summarizing the basis for EUA of a COVID -19 
vaccine to receive an EUA and will be asked  to schedule a Participant Decision Clinic Visit.  
At the Participant Decision Clinic Visit, EUA -eligible participants will:  
• Be given the option to be unblinded as to their original group assignment (placebo vs. 
mRNA -1273 vaccine [100 µg]),  
• Be counseled abo ut the importance of continuing other public health measures to limit the 
spread of disease including social distancing, wearing a mask, and hand -washing,  
• Sign a revised informed consent form ( ICF) and assent, and  
• Provide a nasopharyngeal ( NP) or nasal swab for RT -PCR for SARS -CoV -2 and a blood 
sample for serology and immunogenicity.  
Participants that decline unblinding will remain in Part 1A and follow the Part 1A schedule of 
assessment ( SoA). 
After the Participant Decision Clinic Visit, parti cipants that consent to unblinding will follow the 
Part 1A SoA or Part 1B SoA as follows:  
• Participants received placebo in Part 1A and consent to receiving 2  doses of mRNA -1273 in 
Part 1B:  These participants will proceed to Part 1B and follow the Part  1B S oA until BD is 
offered.  
• Participants received 2 doses of mRNA -1273 in Part 1A:  Due to statistical considerations,

Study Treatment:  
Investigational Product:  
The IP (mRNA -1273 vaccine) is a  lipid nanoparticle  (LNP ) dispersion of a mRNA encoding the 
prefusion stabilized sp ike (S)  protein of SARS -CoV -2 formulated in LNPs composed of 4 lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] 
(1 proprietary and 3 commercially available): the proprietary ionizable lipid SM -102; cholesterol; 
1,2-distearoyl -sn-glycero -3-phosphocholine (DSPC); and 1 -monomethoxypolyethyleneglycol -2,3-
dimyristylglycerol with PEG2000 -DMG. mRNA -1273 injection is provided as a sterile liquid for 
injection, white to off -white dispersion in appearance, at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL in 20  mM Tris 
buffer containing 87  mg/mL sucrose and 10.[ADDRESS_1193023] a volume of 0.25  mL and contain mRNA -1273 50  µg. 
The Sponsor initiated  the development of modified  COVID -19 vaccine  leveraging the mRNA/LNP 
technology platform against SARS -CoV -2 variant,  which incorporate s key mutations present in 
Omicron subvariants BA.4/BA.5. The vaccine IP, mRNA -1273.222 , contains 2 mRNAs: CX -024414 
encoding  for the S -2P of Wuhan -Hu-1 and CX -034476 encoding for the S -2P of Omicron subvariants 
BA.4/BA.5.  
mRNA -1273.222 will be provided as a sterile solution for injection at a concentration of  0.1 mg/mL in 
[ADDRESS_1193024] a volume of 0.5 mL and contain 
50 µg mRNA -1273 .222.  
Mode of Administration:  
Doses will be administered by [CONTACT_513267] -1273 -P203 Pharmacy Manual. Preferably, all doses should be administered into 
the nondominant arm.  
Procedures  and Assessments:  
Safety Assessments:  
Safety assessments will include monitoring and recording of the following for each participant:  
• Solicited local and systemic ARs that occur during the 7 days following each injection (ie, 
the day of injection and 6 sub sequent days) in Part 1A, Part 1C, Part 2, and Part 3. 
Solicited ARs will be recorded daily using electronic diaries ( eDiaries ) 
• Unsolicited AEs observed or reported during the 28  days following each injection (ie,  the 
day of injection and 27 subsequent day s) in Part 1A,  Part 1C, Part 2, and Part 3 
• AEs leading to discontinuation from dosing (except  for participants who receive  a single 
dose in Part  3) and/or withdrawal from study participation from Day  [ADDRESS_1193025] day

• Details of all pregnancies in female participants will be collected after the start of study 
treatment and until the end of their participation in the study  
Immunogenicity Assessments:  
The following analytes will be measured in blood samples for immunogenicity assessments:  
• Serum nAb le vel against SARS -CoV -2 as measured by [CONTACT_340053]/or live virus 
neutralization assays  
• Serum bAb levels against SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1193026] the 
SARS -CoV -2 S protein.  
Exploratory Assessments and Biomarkers:  
Exploratory assessments may include assessment of biomarkers for safety, reactogenicity, 
inflammatory and cardiac function. Serologic markers of disease severity, immune response to 
SARS -CoV -2, RT -PCR of NP or nasal swab or saliva samples, and genetic sequences of SARS -CoV -2 
strains isolated from participants’ samples may also be measured.  
Efficacy Assessments:  
Vaccine effectiveness for adolescents of ages of 12 to <  18 years will be inferred based o n serum Ab 
responses obtained on Day 57 (28 days after the second injection of mRNA -1273)  and Day 209 
(28 days after the second injection of mRNA1273.222) . Inference will be based on assessing the 
adolescent Ab responses against the following:  
• If available  at the time of analysis , adolescent Ab responses will be assessed against an 
accepted serum Ab threshold conferring protection against COVID -19. 
• If an accepted threshold of protection is not available , adolescent Ab responses will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_856804] (Study  P301).

Confidential  Page 30 Statistical Methods:  
Part 1  
Hypothesis Testing (Part 1A)  
If an accepted serum Ab threshold of protection against COVID -19 is established for the primary 
immunogenicity objective, the null hypothesis is that the percentage of participants on mRNA -1273 
with serum Ab equal to or above the established threshold at Day  57 is ≤70% (ie, H 0: percentage of 
participants on mRNA -1273 ≤70% with serum Ab at Day  57 equal to or above the established 
threshold).  
The study would be considered as meeting the immunogenicity objective if the 95% confidence 
interval ( CI) of percentage o f participants on mRNA -1273 rules out 70% (lower bound of the 95%  CI 
>70%).  
If an accepted serum Ab threshold of protection against COVID -19 is not available for the primary 
immunogenicity objective, the immunogenicity analysis of primary vaccine response will be performed 
using the noninferiority tests of the 2 null hypotheses based on the 2 coprimary endpoints, respectively.  
Coprimary endpoint 1: Ab GM value at Day 57  
H10: immunogenicity response to mRNA -1273 as measured by [CONTACT_856805] 57 is inferior in 
adolescents (12 to <  18 years of age) compared with that in young adults (18 to 25 years of age) using 
mRNA -1273 Study  P301 data.  
The noninferiority in Ab GM in adolescents compared with that in young adults (18 to 25 years of age) 
is demonstrated by [CONTACT_856806] 95%  CI of the GM ratio (GMR) rules out 0.667 (lower 
bound >0.667) using a noninferiority margin of 1.5. The GMR is the ratio of the GM value of 
adolescents on mRNA -1273 in this study, Study P203, at Day  57 compared with the GM value of 
young adults (18 to 25 years of age) on mRNA -1273 in Study  P301.  
Coprimary endpoint 2: Ab seroresponse rate at Day  57 
A definition of seroresponse will be provided in the SAP based on forthcoming information about 
assay performance.  
The null hypothesis:  
H20: immunogenicity response to mRNA -1273 as measured by [CONTACT_856807] 57 is inferior 
in adolescents (12 to < 18 years of age) compared with that in young adults (18 to 25 years of age) 
using mRNA -1273 Study P301 data.  
The noninferiority in sero response rate in adolescents compared with that in young adults (18 to 
25 years of age) is demonstrated by [CONTACT_856806] 95% CI of the seroresponse rate 
difference rules out -10% (ie, lower bound > -10%) using the noninferiority margin of 10%.  The 
seroresponse rate difference is defined as the rate in adolescents receiving mRNA -1273 minus the rate 
in young adults (18 to 25 years of age) receiving mRNA -1273 from Study P301.  
The study would be considered as meeting the primary immunogenicity obje ctive if noninferiority is 
demonstrated based on both coprimary endpoints.  
Details regarding the assay to be used to assess noninferiority will be provided in the SAP.

Confidential  Page 31 Power and Sample Size  
The sample size of this study is driven by [CONTACT_49874]. Approximately 3,000 participants will be randomly 
assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive mRNA -1273 or placebo. With 2,000  participants exposed to 
mRNA‑1273, the study has at least 90% probability to observe at least 1  participant with an AE at a 
true 0.25% AE rate.  
Serum sa mples from all participants will be collected and banked, a subset of participants will be 
selected, and their samples will be processed for immunogenicity testing (the Immunogenicity Subset).  
Approximately 362 participants who receive mRNA -1273 will be se lected for the Immunogenicity 
Subset, with a target of 289  participants receiving mRNA -1273 in the per-protocol ( PP) 
Immunogenicity Subset (adjusting for approximately 20% of participants who may be excluded from 
the PP Immunogenicity Subset, as they may n ot have immunogenicity results due to any reason). The 
sample size of the Immunogenicity Subset may be updated with data from other mRNA -[ADDRESS_1193027] >  90% power to rule out 70% with a 2 -sided 95% CI for 
the perce ntage of mRNA -1273 participants exceeding the acceptable threshold if the true rate of 
participants exceeding the acceptable threshold is 80%.  
If an acceptable Ab threshold of protection against COVID -19 is not available at the time of analysis, 
for the pr imary immunogenicity objective, noninferiority tests of 2 null hypotheses based on 2 
coprimary endpoints, respectively, will be performed. The sample size calculation for each of the 2 
noninferiority tests was performed, and the larger sample size was chosen for the study.  
• With approximately 289 participants in the PP Immunogenicity Subset in Study  P203 and 
289 participants in the PP Immunogenicity Subset in young adults (18 to 25 years  of age) 
from Study P301, there will be 90% power to demonstrate noninferiority of the immune 
response as measured by [CONTACT_856808] P203 at a 2 -sided α of 0.05, 
compared with that in young adults (18 to 25 years of age) from Study P301 rece iving 
mRNA -1273, assuming an underlying GMR value of 1 and a noninferiority margin of 1.5. 
The SD of the log‑transformed levels is assumed to be 1.5.  
• With approximately 289  participants in the PP Immunogenicity Subset in Study  P203 and 
289 participants in the PP Immunogenicity Subset in young adults (18 to 25 years of age) 
from Study P301, there will be at least 90% power to demonstrate noninferiority of the 
immune response as measured by [CONTACT_856809] P203 at a 
2-sided α of 0.05 , compared with that in young adults of (18 to 25 years of age) from Study 
P301 receiving mRNA -1273, assuming true seroresponse rate of 85% in young adults (18 
to 25 years of age) from Study  P301, and a true seroresponse rate of 85% in adolescents in 
Study  P203 (ie, true rate difference is 0 compared to young adults [18 to 25  years of age] 
from Study P301), and a noninferiority margin of 10%.

Immunogenicity Analyses  
The SAP will describe the complete set of immunogenicity analyses, including the approach to sample 
participants into an Immunoge nicity Subset for analysis of immunogenicity. The PP Immunogenicity 
Subset is the primary analysis set for immunogenicity unless otherwise specified. The primary 
immunogenicity objective of this study is to use the immunogenicity response to infer efficacy  in 
adolescents (12  to < 18 years in this study). The primary immunogenicity analysis is performed in 
Part 1A. 
If an accepted serum Ab threshold of protection against COVID -19 is available based on data from 
other mRNA -1273 studies or external data, the nu mber and percentage of participants with Ab greater 
than or equal to  the threshold at Day  57 will be provided with a 2 -sided 95% CI using the

The percentage of participants with serum Ab greater than or equal to the threshold with 95% CI will 
be provided at each postbaseline timepoint. The CI will be calculated using the Clopper -Pearson 
method. 
If an accepted serum Ab threshold of protection against COVID -19 is not established, the 
noninferiority of primary vaccine response as measured by [CONTACT_856810] (18 to 25 years of age) receiving mRNA -1273 will be 
assessed. The study is considered as meeting the primary immunogenicity objective if the

compared with that in young adults (18 to 25 years of age) in Study  P301 receiving mRNA -1273.  
An analysis of covariance model will be carried out with Ab value at Day 57 as a dependent variable 
and a group var iable (adolescents in Study P203 and young adults [18 to 25 years of age] in Study 
P301) as the fixed variable. The GM values of the adolescents at Day [ADDRESS_1193028] squares mean (GLSM) from the model. The GMR will be estimate d by [CONTACT_340130]. A corresponding 2 -sided 95%  CI will be provided to assess the difference in

mRNA -[ADDRESS_1193055] 2 -fold rise from baseline by [CONTACT_856822].  
The GM values for specific nAb and bAb, with corresponding 95% CIs, and GMFR from baseline with 
95% CIs will be summarized by [CONTACT_11191]. The 95% CIs will be calculated based on the t -distribution 
of the log transformed values then b ack transformed to the original scale. Descriptive summary 
statistics including median, minimum, and maximum will also be provided.  
The incidence rate of the first occurrence of symptomatic COVID -19, 14 days after Dose  1 will be 
summarized. The incidence rates with 95% CIs will be computed adjusting for person -years.  
Analysis Sets  
The analysis sets are defined in the following table:  
Analysis Set  Description  
Randomization Set  All participants who are randomized, regardless of the 
participants’ treatment status in the study.  
FAS All randomized participants who received at least [ADDRESS_1193056] 1  dose of IP. The 
Safety Set will be used for all analyses of safety except for the 
solicited ARs.  
mITT1 Set  All participants in the mITT Set excluding those who received the 
wrong treatment (ie, at lea st 1 dose received is not as randomized 
or planned).  
PP Immunogenicity Subset for 
BD phase  The PP Immunogenicity Subset for BD phase includes 
participants who received planned BD per schedule, complied 
with immunogenicity testing schedule, and have no major 
protocol deviations that impact key or critical data, with 
prebooster negative or positive SARS -CoV -2. The PP 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -[ADDRESS_1193057] key or critical data, with baseline negative 
or positive SARS -CoV -2. The PP Immunogenicity Subset for 
Part 3 with baseline -positive SARS -CoV -2 status will serve as the 
population for the primary and secondary analysis of 
immunogenicity data at Day 29 in Part  3.  
Abbreviations: AR  = adverse reaction; bAb = binding antibody; COVID -19 = coronavirus disease 
2019; FAS  = full analysis set; IP  = investigational product; mITT  = modified intent -to-treat; 
PP = per-protocol; RT -PCR  = reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ; 
SARS -CoV -2 = Severe Acute Resp iratory Syndrome coronavirus  2.  
Note: Positive SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1193058] for SARS -CoV -2, 
and/or a positive serology test based on bAb specific to SARS -CoV -2 nucleocapsid (as measured by 
[CONTACT_856823] -SARS -CoV -2 assay) on or before Day  1. Negative status is defined as a negative 
RT-PCR test for SARS -CoV -2, and a negative serology test based on bAb specific to SARS -CoV -2 
nucleocapsid (as measured by [CONTACT_856823] -SARS -CoV -2 assay) on or before Day  1. 
Multiplicity Adjustment  
A hierarchical sequential hypothesis testing (fixed -sequence) method will be used to adjust multiplicity 
to preserve the family -wise type I error rate (α = 0.05). The hypothesis testing for the 2 coprimary 
endpoints ( geometric mean titer [ GMT ] and SRR) for the primary series of mRNA -1273 in Part  1A 
was completed and statistically significant based on data snapshot dated 08  May 2021, and thus the α 
level of 0.05 can be passed to Part 1C -1 hypothesis testing. In Part 1C -1 Homologous Bo oster Phase, 
the hypothesis testing for the 2 coprimary endpoints (GMT and SRR against the ancestral  strain) after 
BD of mRNA -1273 will be tested at α level of 0.05. The testing in Part 1A and 1C -1 will continue 
through the sequence only until an endpoint is not statistically significant (did not meet specified 
noninferiority success criteria), in which case the testing will stop. If the hypothesis testing for the  2 
coprimary endpoints in Part 1C -1-Homologous Booster Phase is statistically significant (meet ing the 
noninferiority success criteria of the coprimary endpoints), the α level of 0.[ADDRESS_1193059] variant(s) of interest, the key secondary 
endpoints will be analyzed independently, given that prototype vaccine mRNA -1273 does not contain 
variant specific sequences.  
Part 3  
Since the hypothesis testing for the coprimary endpoints in Part 1C -1 was statistically significant based 
on an interim analysis ( IA) with a data cutoff dated 16 May 2022, the α level of 0.05 (two -sided) was 
passed to Part 3 hypothesis testing.  
Study Analyses:  
Interim Analyses  
More than one IA may  be performed.

1,500  participants (1,000  participants receiving mRNA -1273) have completed Day 57 
(1 month after Dose  2, Part 1A). This IA will be considered the primary analysis of 
immunogenicity for Part 1A.  
• An IA of immunogenicity and safety may be performed after all or subset of participants who 
receive BD have completed BD -Day 29 after the BD in Part 1C -1. 
• An IA of immunogenicity and safety may be performed after all or subset of participants who 
receive heterologous BD have completed BD -Day 29 after the BD in Part 1C -2. 
• An IA of immunogenicity and safety  may be performed after Day [ADDRESS_1193061] completed Day 57 (1 month after 
Dose 2, Part 2).  
• An IA of immunogenicity and safety may be performed after all or a subset of participants  who 
receive [ADDRESS_1193062] completed Day 29 (1 month after  Dose  1). 
• At the Sponsor’s discretion, a clinical study report (CSR) may be developed for an IA.  
Final Analysis  
The final analysis of all applicable endpoints will be performed after  all participants have completed all 
planned study procedures. Results of this analysis will be presented in a final CSR, including 
individual listings.

1.1. Study Rationale   
Coronaviruses are a large family of vi ruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to 
more severe diseases, such as MERS and SARS. Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are 
transmitted between animals and people. An outbreak of COVID -19 caused by [CONTACT_7544] -CoV -2 
began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019 and has spread throughout China and 
to over 215 other countries, territories, and areas including the [LOCATION_003]  (WHO  2020a ). On 
11 Mar 2020, the WHO officially declared COVID -19 a pandemic.  
Following the outbreak of COVID -19, ModernaTX, Inc.  (hereafter referred to as the Sponsor)  
applied its mRNA vaccine platform and coronavirus research experience to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_856757] -[ADDRESS_1193073] SARS -CoV -2. At the time of study i nitiation, evidence suggested 
that the burden of COVID -19 has begun to increase in younger age groups (>408000 COVID -19 
cases and 88 deaths in children less than 18 years of age as of 21 Sep 2020), particularly as 
schools in the [LOCATION_003]  started to reopen for i n person instruction ( CDC  2022a). Adolescents also 
likely represented a segment of the population contributing toward sustained community 
transmission of SARS -CoV -2 as well as spread of SARS -CoV -2 within households given their 
mobility and less likelihood of compliance with mask wearing and social distancing 
(Fontanet  et al 2020 ). 
Since then, there have been approximately 6.2 million COVID -19 cases and 772 deaths as of 
30 Aug 2022 in the US A (CDC  2022b ) in adolescents 12 -17 years of age. Since Mar 2020, 
approximately 1 in 4 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856758] (0 to 17 years old) with COVID -[ADDRESS_1193074] required intensive care ( CDC  2022c ). While rates of severe disease have not increased 
since the start of the pandemic, the increase in absolute numbers of cases has added substantial 
burden, in terms of the increased number of emergency department and urgent care clinic 
encounters and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856759] ( Klein  et al 2022 ; CDC  2022c ). 
In addition to the increased incidence and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856760], COVID -19 disease in 
children and adolescents can include MIS -C, a unique complication in conjunction with severe 
disease ( Vogel  et al 2021 ). MIS -C shares some common features with Kawasaki disease, and is 
defined as fever, laboratory evidence of inflammation, and involvement of ≥[ADDRESS_1193075] ems in 
an individual <[ADDRESS_1193076] been reported in the US A, with 71 MIS -C related 
deaths reported. The median age of patients with MIS -C was 9 years (range 5 to 13 years) 
(CDC  2022d ). 
Myocarditis has been well described as a complication of pediatric COVID -19. Children under 
[ADDRESS_1193077] 37 -fold higher risk of myocarditis than the 
uninfected age - and gender -matched control population ( Boehmer  et al 2020 ). Of note, the 
frequency of myocarditis due to COVID -[ADDRESS_1193078] a mil der clinical course than patients with classic 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 55 myocarditis or MIS -C myocarditis, with a lower likelihood of cardiac dysfunction at presentation 
and more rapid recovery ( Patel  et al 2022 ). 
Long COVID, a sequela of COVID -19, affe cting up to 20% of persons infected with 
SARS -CoV -2, has also been described in children, including in those with a mild infection. This 
syndrome is manifested by [CONTACT_856824], muscle and joint pain, insomnia, 
concentration difficultie s, respi[INVESTIGATOR_66780], persistence anosmia and ageusia, and cardiac 
palpi[INVESTIGATOR_856761] 6 months after infection ( Buonsenso  et al 2022 ;

Variants of concern such as Delta and Omicron have also emerged contributing to the substantial 
burden in the adolescent population. After the onset of the Omicron wave, the demographics of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856762] h COVID -19 shifted to younger age groups ( Abdullah  et al 2022 ; 
Goga  et al 2021 ; United  Kingdom  Health  Security  Agency  2022). Furthermore, the peak number 
of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856763] [ADDRESS_1193079] ( Delahoy  et al 2021 ; Marks  et al 2022a ; Marks  et al 2022b ). 
Taken together, a vaccine that prevents COVID -[ADDRESS_1193080] SARS -CoV -2 infection ( Section  1.2), and started a Phase 3 clinical study in the US A 
involving administration of mRNA -1273 vaccine 100  µg as both an initial dose and a second 
dose 2 8 days later ( Section  1.2.2 ). Success criteria for early efficacy were met at first IA based 
on 95 adjudicated cases with a VE of 94.5% (95% CI: 86.5% , 97.8%; one -sided p -value 
< 0.0001), and EUA was granted for mRNA -1273 in the adult population.  
Data from the ongoing pi[INVESTIGATOR_856764] -1273 -P301 (Study P301) showed that mRNA -1273 
continued to induce durable protection: clinical efficacy against COVID -19 was maintained at 
93% through a median of approximately 5 months after the second dose.  
The primary objective for the Blinded Phase 2/3 study, mRNA -1273 -P203 (Study P203), is to 
evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a single dose level (100  g) of mR NA-1273 vaccine 
administered in 2 doses 28  days apart ( Section  3.1) to an adolescent population. Specifically, the 
primary immunogenicity objective o f the study is to infer effectiveness of mRNA -1273 (100  µg, 
2 doses 28 days apart) 28 days after Dose 2 of mRNA -1273 (Day 57) by [CONTACT_856825] (aged ≥  12 through <  18 years) to the young adult (≥18 to ≤25  year of 
age) cohort  in Study P301, where efficacy was demonstrated.  
Interim data from the current Study P203 (based on a data snapshot of 08 May 2021) met the 
primary immunogenicity objective by [CONTACT_856826] (i) GM value of 
serum nAb and (ii) the seroconversion rate from adolescent participants compared with those 
from young adults (aged  18 to  25 years) enrolled in the ongoing Phase 3 efficacy study 
(Study  P301). These interim results supported administration of mRNA -1273 as two 100 µg 
doses 28 days apart in adolescents between ≥ 12 and 17 years of age. On 17 Jun 2022, the FDA 
granted EUA of the mRNA -1273 vaccine for adolescents 12 through 17 years of age. Global 
filings/authorizations down to [ADDRESS_1193081] also occurred.

50 µg of mRNA -1273 given as a 2 dose primary series as well as when given as a homologous 
and heterologous booster vaccine. The rationale for these objectives is as follows: In P art A of 
Study mRNA -1273 -P201  (Study  P201) , the time course and magnitude of antibody (both bAb 
and nAb) responses to mRNA -1273 was similar between 100 µg and 50 µg dose levels (both

although the [ADDRESS_1193082] levels and met the noninfe riority criteria stipulated in the FDA Guidance on EUA for 
Vaccines to Prevent COVID -19. Interim results from Study mRNA -1273 -P205 (Study P205) 
also show that a [ADDRESS_1193083] levels. Available data also show that heterologous 
or mixed series of COVID -19 vaccine -induced high immune response in the adult population 
(Atma r et al 2021 ). Additionally, no new safety signals emerged upon admin istration of the BD 
in Study P201. Based on cumulative evidence, the benefit -risk profile of a BD of mRNA -[ADDRESS_1193084] Dose 1 was prompted by [CONTACT_856827]:  
a) Recent disease trends support the need for pediatric vaccination strategies that induce broader 
protection against VOCs (eg, Omicron variant) in addition to the an cestral SARS -CoV -2 strain,  
b) increasing prevalence of SARS -CoV -2 infection in the community ( Clarke  et al 2022 ), 
c) Study P205  data show that Omicron containing vaccine (ie, mRNA -1273.214) elicits strong

1.2. Background and Overview   
The Sponsor’s  scalable mRNA/LNP tech nology platform allowed for a  rapid response to the 
COVID -[ADDRESS_1193087] SARS -CoV -2. The Sponsor’s mRNA/LNP  platform is based on 
the principle and observations that cells i n vivo can take up mRNA,  translate it, and then express 
protein viral antigen(s) on the cell surface. The delivered mRNA  does not enter the cellular 
nucleus or interact with the genome, is nonreplicating, and is  expressed transiently. Vaccine 
mRNA -1273 enc odes for the full -length spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531] (S) protein SARS -CoV -2(CoV S). The CoV 
S protein mediates attachment and entry of the virus into host cells, by [CONTACT_856828] 2 receptor followed by  [CONTACT_856829], making it a primary target for nAb 
that prevents infection ( Johnson  et al 2016 ; Wang  et al 2015 ; Wang  et al 2018 ; Chen  et al 2017 ; 
Corti  et al 2015 ; Yu et al 2015 ; Kim et al 2019 ; Widjaja  et al 2019 ; Corbett  et al 2020a ; 
Ju et al 2020 ; Robbiani  et al 2020 ). 
Worldwide approvals or authorizations have been issued for mRNA -1273 as a 2-dose 100  µg 
primary series or as a 50 µg BD in adults and in the adolescent age group .  
With the recent surge of a more divergen t Omicron subvariant, the development of a bivalent 
mRNA -1273.222 vaccine was accelerated to address the current SARS -CoV -2 outbreak 
(Hastie  et al 2021 ). 
In November 2021,  the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529; BA.1) emerged as the m ost antigenically  
divergent variant to date that currently has more than 30 mutations in the S 2P protein  
(Hastie  et al 2021 ). In early 2022, new Omicron subvariants BA.4/BA.[ADDRESS_1193088] 
their own unique and shared mutations with the BA.1. Leveraging the mRNA/LNP technology 
platform, the Sponsor initiated the development of modified COVID -[ADDRESS_1193089] 
SARS -CoV -2 variants including the mRNA -1273.222 which contains  2 mRNAs: CX -024414 
encoding for the S -2P of Wuhan -Hu-1 and CX -034476 encoding for the S -2P of Omicron 
subvariants BA.4/BA.5. (See IB V8 Addendum  2). 
Moderna variant -containing bivalent booster vaccines (mRNA 1273.214 and mRNA -1273.222) 
have received appro vals or authorizations globally in adults and in the adolescent age group.  
On 18 Apr 2023, the FDA amended the EUAs for the Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine (mRNA -
1273) and Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine, Bivalent (mRNA 1273.222) to simplify the vaccination 
schedule for  most individuals. In that prior authorization, individuals [ADDRESS_1193090] not yet received a bivalent COVID -19 vaccine could receive a single dose of Moderna

Biologics License Application for Spi[INVESTIGATOR_135893]® for ages 12 years and above, maintaining the 
recommendation for a single dose of the updated vaccine, Spi[INVESTIGATOR_135893] r egardless of prior 
vaccination history. Moderna's updated COVID -[ADDRESS_1193091] SARS -CoV -2 in studies in young mice 
(Corbett  et al 2020a ) and NHPs ( Corbett  et al 2020b ). 
Nonclinical studies in mice, hamsters, and NHP s assessing the monovalent mRNA -1273.529, 
bivalent mRNA -1273.214 (contains the ancestral SARS -CoV -2 and the Om icron variant BA.1 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_856765]), and bivalent mRNA -1273.222 (contains the ancestral SARS -CoV -2 and the 
Omicron variant BA.4/BA.5  spi[INVESTIGATOR_856765]) vaccines are ongoing. These studies are designed 
to assess these vaccines as a primary series (2 -dose) or as a booster (3rd or 4th dose) in animals 
previously vaccinated with mRNA -1273. Overall, interim data suggest that a primary series with 
a monovalent vaccine induces robust neutralization against the matched and closely related 
variants but does not induce  significant neutralization against highly divergent SARS -CoV -2 
lineages. A bivalent vaccine, however, induces broader neutralization across divergent lineages. 
In these studies, no significant differences were measured in CD4 or CD8 cytokine production in  
mice that received mRNA -1273, mRNA -1273.529, or mRNA -1273.214.  
Mice were vaccinated with 2 doses of monovalent mRNA -1273, BA.1 -matched monovalent 
mRNA -1273.529, or bivalent mRNA -1273.214, with 2 doses administered 3 weeks apart. At 
Day 36 (2 weeks after t he second dose), robust serum nAb responses, determined via 
pseudovirus neutralization assay, were observed against Wuhan -[ADDRESS_1193092] both the prototype strain (Wuhan -1 D614G) 
and against BA.1 and BA.2 was measured, indicating that the bivalent vaccine affords broader 
neutralization across variants.  
In addition, mRNA -1273.214 and mRNA -1273.222 were studied in mice previously vaccinated 
with primary series of mRNA -1273. Mice were boosted with original (mRNA -1273), BA.1 
Omicron bivalent Omicron mRNA -1273.214, or  Omicron  BA.4/BA.5  bivalent mRNA -1273.222 
approximately 31 weeks between primary series and booster. Data shows increased 
immunogenicity of bivalent mRNA -1273.214 and mRNA -1273.222 vaccines (7 - and 3 -fold 
increase , respectively  in BA.1 neutralization titers) & (4.2 - and 4.5 -fold increase , respectively  in

1.2.2.  Clinical Studies   
The clinical development of mRNA -1273 vaccines to support its use in the adult population  
consists of 5 ongoing clinical trials being conducted in the US A: 
• Two Phase 1, open -label, dose ranging studies (Study 20 -0003; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ; 
Study  21-0002, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) sponsored by [CONTACT_122845] . 
• Phase 2a, randomized, observer -blind, placebo -controlled, dose -confirmation study 
(Study  mRNA -1273 -P201; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ). 
• Phase 3 randomized, stratified, observer -blind, placebo -controlled study 
(Study  mRNA -1273 -P301;  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and 
immunogenicity of the vaccine . 
• Phase 3b, open -label study (Study mRNA -1273 -P304, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) to evaluate the 
safety and immunogenicity of the  vaccine in adult solid organ transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_856766].  
In addition, 2 ongoing trials are being conducted in the pediatric population:  
• Phase 2/3 randomized, placebo -controlled safety and immunogenicity study of 
mRNA -1273 in children 12 to  <18 years of age (Study mRNA -1273 -P203 [current 
study]; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ). 
• Phase 2/3, study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of mRNA -1273 in 
children 6 months to <12 years of age (mRNA -1273 -P204; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ). 
In addition, 4 ongoing trials are being conducted to support SARS -CoV -2 variants : 
• Study mRNA -1273 -P205 ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) is an open -label, Phase 2/3 study with 
multiple parts to evaluate  the safety and immunogenicity of boosters for SARS -CoV -
2 variants.  
• Study mRNA -1273 -P206 ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) is a Phase 2 , Part 1 open -label, Part 2 
randomized placebo -controlled study to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and 
immunogenicity of the bivalent mRNA1273.214 vaccine for SARS -CoV -2 variants of 
concern in infants aged 12 weeks to <6 months.  
• Study mRNA -1273 -P305 ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) is a Phase 2/3, randomized, observer -
blind, active -controlled, multicenter study to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety 
of Omicron variant vaccines in comparison with mRNA -1273 (prototype) booster 
vaccine.

[IP_ADDRESS].  Phase 1 Study DMID20 -0003  
The safety and immunogenicity of mRNA -1273 were evaluated in Phase 1 (DMID 20 -0003) and 
Phase 2 (P201) studies that were important to select and to confirm the dose of the vaccine used 
in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 study. In Study 20 -0003 (Phase 1), [ADDRESS_1193094] titers of nAb or bAb with an acceptable safety profile, and this observation was the 
basis for selecting the 100  μg dose for use in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_53881] 3 study. Importantly, the Ab 
levels after 2 doses of mRNA -1273 exceeded those from a pool of convalescent sera. 
Neutralizing activity was observed for the 100  μg mRNA -1273 dose as of Day  36 and was 
higher than that of the convalescent sera control group, and the median titers remained in the 
same range as the median titer in the convalescent sera control group at Day 119 across the age 
strata. In this study, the majority of the solicited ARs were mild or moderate. A  higher incidence 
of severe solici ted ARs was observed with the 250  μg dose (in the 18–55-year age cohort) 
compared with the lower doses (25 μg, 50 μg, and 100 μg); thus, the mRNA -1273 250  μg dose 
was not evaluated in participants ≥56 years of age. One severe unsolicited AE related to 
mRNA -1273 and 1 severe clinically meaningful elevation in serum lipase related to mRNA -1273 
were also observed with the 250  μg dose (in the 18–55-year age cohort). Additionally, in 
Study  20-0003, Th1 -directed CD4+ T -cells were observed to be induced across age  groups, with 
limited indication of a Th2 -directed response, and similar responses were observed among all 
age groups for the 100  μg dose. The predominance of a Th1 -directed T -cell profile helps mitigate 
concern of the risk of enhanced disease associated w ith Th2 -driven pathophysiology.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Phase 2 Study mRNA -1273 -P201   
Study P201 is an ongoing Phase 2a, safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity study in healthy 
adults that provided c onfirmation of the immunogenicity of both the 100  μg and 50  µg doses. 
The study was designed as a randomized, observer -blind, placebo -controlled dose -confirmation 
study (Part A). Two mRNA -1273 dose levels, 50 μg and 100  μg, and placebo were evaluated in 
2 age cohorts: Cohort  1 enrolled participants ≥ 18 to < 55 years old (300  participants), and 
Cohort  2 enrolled participants ≥  55 years old (300  participants). A total of 600 participants 
received either mRNA -1273 or placebo according to a 1:1:1  randomization ratio,  ie, within each 
age cohort, 100  participants each received mRNA -1273 50 μg, mRNA -1273 100  μg, or placebo.  
An amendment to the Study 201 protocol adapted the study design to include open -label 
interventional phases (Part B and Part C). Part B allowed  unblinding of participants and offered 
2 injections of mRNA -1273 in an open -label manner, 28 days apart, to all participants who 
received placebo in Part A. Part B also offered a single BD of mRNA -1273 (50 μg) to 
participants who received 1 or 2 doses of mRNA -1273 (50 μg or 100 μg) in Part A. Part C was 
prompted by [CONTACT_856830], including against emerging variants of SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1193095] 6 months 
prior. Part C participants received a single injection of mRNA -1273.351 (20 μg or 50 μg) or

group who received mRNA -1273.351 as a BD compared to those who received mRNA -1273 
vaccine as a BD. The majority of solicited local and systemic AEs were mild ( Grade 1) or 
moderate ( Grade 2). The frequency of any Grade 3 solicited local or systemic AE was 15% (3 of 
20 participants) after the BD of mRNA -1273 and 10.5% (2 of 19 participants) after the BD of

The Day 29 SRR (95% CI) against ancestral SARS -CoV-2 was 100% (98.9, 100 and 98.6, 100) 
28 days after in the mRNA -1273.214 and mRNA -1273 gro ups, respectively, with an SRR 
difference of 0, meeting the noninferiority criterion (lower bound of CI > -10%). In participants 
who received the mRNA -1273.[ADDRESS_1193100] BD were higher than those who were SARS -CoV -2 
negative ( Chalkias  et al 2022b ). 
The estimated Day [ADDRESS_1193101] Omicron were 2479.9 (2264.5, 2715.8) and 1421.2 
(1283.0, 1574.4) in the mRNA -1273.214 and mRNA -1273 groups, respectively. The GMR 
(97.5% CI) was 1.75 (1.49, 2.04), which met the prespecified superiority criterion (lower bound 
of CI > 1). The Day 29 Omicron SRRs (95% CI) were 100% (98.9, 100) and 99.2% (97.2, 99.9) 
in the mRNA -1273.214 and mRNA -1273 groups , respectively. The SRR difference (97.5% CI) 
was 1.5% ( -1.1, 4.0), meeting noninferiority criteria (lower bound of CI > -10%).  
All immunogenicity endpoints were also met based on an analysis that included participants with 
and without evidence of prebooste r SARS -CoV -2 infection . 
Additionally, in the primary analysis set (PPSI – Neg, reflecting participants without prior  
SARS -CoV -2 infection), the observed GMTs (95% CI) against Omicron BA.4 /BA5 GMTs 
(95%  CI) prebooster were 115.6 (98.5, 135.6) and increased to 727.4 (632.9, 836.1) at 28 days 
after the BD for mRNA -1273.214 with a GMFR (95% CI) of 6.3 (5.7, 6.9). The GMTs

On the basis of these results, the mRNA -1273.214 (50 μg) elicited superior nAb responses 
against the Omicron subvariants BA.4, BA.5 compared with mRNA -1273 (50 μg) (nominal α of

[IP_ADDRESS].  Phase 3 Study mRNA -1273 -P301   
Currently, a Phase 3 pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735], randomized, placebo -controlled, observer -blind clinical Study P301 
is being conducted in participants 18 years of age and older who are at an increased risk of 
COVID -19 disease. In addition, prespecified cohorts of participants who were either ≥65 years 
of age or 18  to <65 years of age with comorb id medical conditions were included. A total of 
[ZIP_CODE] participants were followed for a median of 92 days (range: 1 -122) for the development of 
COVID -[ADDRESS_1193110] IA based on 95 
adjudicated cases with a V E of 94.5% (95% CI: 86.5%, 97.8%; one -sided p -value < 0.0001). 
Study  P301 is expected to provide immunogenicity data where an Ab threshold of protection 
against COVID -[ADDRESS_1193111] frequently reported ARs after any dose in the vaccine group were 
pain at the injection site (92.0% any Grade; 6.1% Grade ≥ 3), fatigue (70% any Grade; 10.1% 
Grade ≥ 3), headache (64.7% any Grade; 5.7% Grade ≥3), myalgia (61.5% any Grade; 9.1% 
Grade ≥ 3) and chills (45.4% any Grade; 1.4% Grade ≥ 3). The majority of local and systemic 
ARs had a median duration of 1 to 3 days. Overall, there was a higher reported rate of some ARs 
in younger age groups: the incidence of axillary swelling/tenderness, fatigue, headache, myalgia, 
arthralgia, chills, nausea/vomiting, and fever was higher in adults aged 18 to < 65 years than in 
those aged 65 years and above. Grade 3 solicited local ARs were more frequently reported  after 
Dose 2 than after Dose 1. In the participants who received the vaccine, solicited systemic ARs 
were reported numerically more frequently by [CONTACT_856832] 2 than after 
Dose  1. Grade 3 systemic ARs (fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, and headache) were reported more 
frequently after Dose [ADDRESS_1193112] observation. Unsolicited AEs tha t occurred in ≥ 1% of study participants who received 
mRNA -[ADDRESS_1193113] 1.5 -fold higher rate than placebo, were 
lymphadenopathy -related events (1.1% of versus 0.6%). All of the lymphadenopathy events are 
similar to the axillary swelling/tende rness in the injected arm reported as solicited ARs. 
Hypersensitivity AEs were reported in 1.5% of vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_842] 1.1% of placebo 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Hypersensitivity events in the vaccine group included injection site rash and injection 
site urticaria, wh ich are likely related to vaccination. There have been no cases of severe 
hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions reported immediately after vaccination in the trial to 
date. There were 3  reports of Bell’s palsy in the mRNA -1273 vaccine group (one of wh ich was 
an SAE), which occurred 22, 28, and 32 days after vaccination, and one in the placebo group, 
which occurred 17  days after vaccination. The currently available information on Bell’s palsy is 
insufficient to determine a causal relationship with the v accine. There were 2 SAEs of facial 
swelling in vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_89278] a history of injection of dermatological fillers. The onset of 
swelling was reported 1 and 2 days, respectively, after vaccination and was likely related to 
vaccination. There was 1  SAE of intractable nausea and vomiting in a participant with prior 
history of severe headache and nausea requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. This event occurred 1 day after 
vaccination and was likely related to vaccination.

The Sponsor submitted a data package to FDA on 30 Novem ber 2020 for consideration of EUA. 
FDA granted an EUA for mRNA -1273 for use in adults 18  years of age and older on 18 
December 2020.  
Efficacy and safety results based on the final analysis of Part A with a database lock of 
04 May 2021 are provided in the I B. The results are generally comparable to the IA. On 
25 Aug 2021, Moderna announced that it had completed the rolling submission process for its 
BLA to the FDA for the full licensure of the Moderna COVID -19 vaccine (mRNA -1273) for 
active immunization to p revent COVID -19 in individuals 18 years of age and older. On 
31 Jan 2022, mRNA -1273 was granted full licensure by [CONTACT_36432] A FDA. mRNA -1273 has been 
showing durable efficacy of 93% through 6 months after the second dose.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Study mRNA -1273 -P203 - Interim Results   
Interim data from the current Part 1A of Study P203 (based on a data snapshot of 08 May 2021) 
show that the primary immunogenicity objective was met by [CONTACT_856833] (i) GM value of serum nAb and (ii) the seroconversion rate from adolescent participants 
compared with those from young adults (aged  18 to 25 years) enrolled in the ongoing Phase 3 
efficacy study (Study  P301). The GMR of adolescent (Study P2 03) to young adult (Study P301) 
nAb titers at Day 57 was 1.077 (95% CI: 0.939, 1.236), meeting the 1.5 -fold noninferiority 
criterion (ie, lower bound of the 95% CI for GMR is >0.667). The difference in adolescent to 
young adult nAb SRR s at Day 57 was 0.2  (95% CI: -1.8, 2.4), meeting the 10% noninferiority 
criterion (lower bound of the 95% of the SRR  difference is ≥ -10%). In addition, results of VE 
against COVID -19, defined using either the “Study  P301 case definition” or the “CDC case 
definition”, and condu cted starting 14 days after Dose 1 or Dose 2 were all similar to the 94.1% 
VE observed [ADDRESS_1193114] 1 to 2 days after any dose and generally persisted 
for a median of 1 to 3 days. The frequency of reporte d solicited ARs were generally similar and 
there were no notable differences in the reported rates of unsolicited AEs observed between 
participants aged ≥  12 to <  16 years and participants aged ≥ 16 to <18 years.  
Unsolicited treatment -emergent AE s (TEAEs ) up to [ADDRESS_1193115] interim results (08 May 2021). The evidence from the 08 May 2021 data cutoff infers  
effectiveness, suggesting that mRNA -1273 is effective in preventing COVID -19, and the known 
and potential benefits of mRNA -1273 when used to prevent COVID‑19 outweigh the known and 
potential risks.  
The updated data collected as of 31 Jan 2022 included: (i) VE of the blinded phase updated as of 
31 May 2021; (ii) COVID -19 cases as of 31 Jan 2022; and (iii) safety data from all mRNA -1273 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_856769]‑label phases of the study.  
Vaccine efficacy through 31 May 2021 was 100% (95% CI: 61.2%, not estimated [NE]) using 
the P301 case definition and 89.9% (95% CI: 51.0%, 98.9%) using the CDC case definition. The 
updated analysis confirms results provided in the EUA Amendment submitted on 09 Jun 2021 
based on the 08 May 2021 data cutoff). Beyond 31 May 2021, the loss of placebo participants 
precluded meaningful analysis of VE. Long -term ass essment of monthly incidence rates among 
all participants who received mRNA -1273 as randomized and remained on study up to 
31 Jan 2022 (combined blinded and unblinded) shows low monthly incidence rates of 
COVID -[ADDRESS_1193116] the Omicron variant was evaluated in a small subset (N=20 each 
study) of serum samples randomly selected from adults (≥ 18 years) in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735] P301 study, 
and from adolescents (≥ 12 to <18 years) in Study P203 following a 2 -dose regimen of 100 μg 
mRNA -1273 and from children (6 to <12 years) in Study mRNA -[ADDRESS_1193117] Omicron was present in all 
participants (100%) [ADDRESS_1193118] D614G among adolescents. Compared with adults, adolescent GMTs were 
1.5- and 3.8‑f old higher for D614G and the Omicron variant, respectively ( Girard  et al 2022 ). 
mRNA -1273 was found to be generally safe in clinical Study P203 with no new safety signals in 
either the 08 May 2021 initial EUA Amendment data cu toff or the longer -term safety cut of 
31 Jan 2022. The overall safety profile observed in the adolescent study (Study P203) was 
generally consistent with the findings to date in the Phase 3 Study P301 in adults aged ≥ 18 years. 
In the long -term safety follo w-up, SAEs were reported for 22/2577 participants (0.9%) overall. 
No SAEs were assessed by [CONTACT_856834]. MAAEs were reported for 1002/2577 participants (38.9%) overall. MAAEs considered 
by [CONTACT_856835] -1273 were reported for 26 participants (1.0%). The 
incidence of MAAEs reflects the Omicron surge. Three participants in the mRNA -1273 group 
discontinued study vaccine because of a TEAE. AESIs were reported for 13 participant s. In the 
open -label, cross over phase, there was 1 probable case of myocarditis (adjudicated by [CONTACT_856836]) observed in the Study P203 clinical program which occurred 
1 day following second dose but did not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856770]

1.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment   
1.3.1.  Potential Benefits from Participation   
The following benefits may accrue to participants:  
• The mRNA -[ADDRESS_1193132] COVID -19 
including disease caused by [CONTACT_327957].  
• Participants will have a baseline (Day  1) evaluation for SARS -CoV -2 infection and 
ongoing surveillance for COVID -19 throughout the study.  
• The study will contribute to the development of a vaccine against COVID -19 for 
adolescents.  
1.3.2.  Risks to Study Participants and Risk Mitigation   
Immediate systemic allergic reactions (eg, anaphylaxis) can occur following any vaccination. 
These reactions are very rare and are estimated to occur once per  450,000 vaccinations for 
vaccines that do not contain allergens such as gelatin or egg protein ( Zent et al 2002 ). As a 
precaution, all participants will remain under observation at the study site for at least 30 minutes 
after injection.  
Vasovagal syncope (fainting) can occur before or after any vaccination, is usually triggered by 
[CONTACT_14303]. Therefore, 
it is important that standard precautions and procedures are followed to avoi d injury from 
fainting.  
IM injection with other mRNA vaccines manufactured by [CONTACT_856837] -102 
lipid formulation commonly results in a transient and self -limiting local inflammatory reaction. 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 69 This typi[INVESTIGATOR_14264], erythema (redness ), or swelling (hardness) at the injection site, 
which are mostly mild to moderate in severity and usually occur within [ADDRESS_1193133] been mild to moderate in severity ( Section  1.2.2 ). The most 
commonly reported systemic ARs were headache, myalgia, fatigue, chills, and fever. In the 
majority of cases, the reactions resolved spontaneously within several days.  
There is a theoretical risk that active vaccination to prevent SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1193134] (formalin -inactivated whole virus) and designed to protect children 
against infection with respi[INVESTIGATOR_4345] ( Chin  et al 1969 ) or measles virus 
(Fulginiti  et al 1967 ). Disease enhancement has also been proposed as a possible explanation for 
cases of more serious disease associated with dengue vaccination ( Thomas  and Yoon  2019 ; 
WHO  2019 ). 
In order to address this theoretical risk, animal studies were performed in young and aged 
wild-type mice and rhesus macaques (NHPs). These studies were designed to capture 
immunogenicity endpoints that would be predictive of ERD and also to evaluate if, at protective 
or subprotective dose levels of mRNA -1273, evidence of disease enhancement would be 
observed after challenge of the animals with SARS -CoV -2. These noncl inical studies 
demonstrated that mRNA -1273 is safe and well -tolerated in different animal species, is 
immunogenic; drives a robust SARS -CoV -2-specific Ab, neutralization, and Th1 -directed CD4 
T-cell response; fully protects animals from challenge at dose l evels as low as 1  μg/dose in mice 
and 30  μg/dose in NHPs; and does not lead to ERD at protective or subprotective dose levels 
(Corbett  et al 2020a ; Corbett  et al 2020b ). Clinical immunogenicit y data from the DMID Phase  1 
study of mRNA -1273 demonstrated high levels of nAbs and Th1 -polarized CD4+ T -cell 
responses ( Jackson  et al 2020 ), consistent with the immunogenicity observed in these nonclinical 
studies. These da ta suggest that a paradoxical increase in the risk of disease, while not 
eliminated, is likely to be low.  
In individuals [ADDRESS_1193135] ( Gargano  et al 2021 ). One probable case of myocarditis was reported in this 
study with features consistent with this typi[INVESTIGATOR_856773], short -lived pattern 
(Study  mRNA -1273 -P203 data on file ). Recent data from an observational study ( Wong  2022 ) 
conducted in 4 large US administrative health plan claims databases covering more than 
100 million persons, (OptumServe, HealthCore, Blue Health Intelligence, and CVS Health) 
observed no statistical difference in risk rates of myocarditis/pericarditis following any dose of 
2 mRNA COVID -19 vaccines. Moreover, recently published data from a health care 
organization in Israel estimated the incidence of myocarditis due to COVID‐19 infection as 
11.0 cases per 100 ,000 persons (95% CI: 5.6 –15.8), compared to the nearly five -fold lower 
incidence of myocarditis observed following the 2nd dose of mRNA -1273 (highest incidence 
rate) at 2.17  per 100,000 person -days (95% CI: 1.55 -3.04) ( Wong  2022 ). Other studies also show 
that myocarditis cases related to COVID‐19 infection revealed a higher mortality rate and rate of 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 70 severe complications compared to myocarditis cases following vaccination with a COVID -19 
mRNA vaccine ( Patel  et al 2022 ). Moreover, infection with SARS‐CoV‐[ADDRESS_1193136] dose of mRNA -1273 are described in Section 1.2.2 . In 
general, solicited local and systemic ARs after the BD (Study P201) were comparable to what 
had been observed with the primary series (Study P301). Preliminary report from a heterologous 
booster study in adults show r eactogenicity and adverse events were similar across booster 
groups  (Atmar  et al 2021 ). 
1.3.3.  Overall Benefit/Risk Conclusion   
All participants in Part 1 will receive a single dosage of 100 g mRNA -1273 vaccine or placebo 
administered in 2  doses 28 days apart ( Section  3.1). Participants in Part 1A who received 
mRNA -[ADDRESS_1193137] 5 months from second dose in 
Part 1C -1. All participants in  Part 1C -2 will receive a single BD of 50 µg of mRNA -1273. 
Participants in Part 2 will receive a single dosage of 50 µg mRNA -1273 vaccine administered in 
2 doses 28 days apart  with or without a booster dose . Participants in Part 3 will receive 1 or 
2 doses  of 50 µg bivalent mRNA -1273.222 vaccine.  
Safety will be monitored throughout the study ( Section  7.6). 
Considering the limited number of approved vac cines for COVID -19, the participants’ risk of 
COVID -19 outside the study during a pandemic, and the nonclinical and clinical data to date, the 
Sponsor considers the potential benefits of participation to exceed the risks.

This is a three -part, Phase 2/3 study: Part 1A, Part 1B, and Part 1C. P articipants in Part 1A, the 
Blinded Phase, are blinded to their treatment assignment.  
Part 1B, the Open -label Observational Phase of this study, is designed to offer participants who 
received placebo in Part 1A of this study and who meet the EUA eligibilit y criteria an option to 
receive mRNA -1273 in an open -label fashion ( Figure  3). Participants who received mRNA -1273 
(100 µg) in Part 1A of this study will proceed to Part 1B after they are unblinded and will 
continue to follow the Part 1A SoA ( Table  10). Part 1C -1, the Homologous Booster Dose Phase,  
is designed to offer participants in Part 1A and Part 1B, and who are at least [ADDRESS_1193156] a BD of 50 µg mRNA -1273. Part 1C -2, the Heterologous Booster 
Phase, is designed to provide participants who completed non-Mod erna primary COVID -19

This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, G CP, and all applicable regulatory 
requirements . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Part 1A, the Blinded Phase   
The blinded phase of this study is a randomized, observer -blind, placebo -controlled study 
intended to i nfer the effectiveness of mRNA -1273 in an adolescent population aged 12 to 
< 18 years. The study includes 2  arms: (i) 100  µg of mRNA -1273, and (ii) placebo. 
Approximately, 3000  participants between 12  to < 18 years of age will be randomly assigned in a 
2:1 ratio to receive mRNA -1273 (n=2000) or placebo (n=1000).  
The schematic of study arms and major study events for Part 1A is illustrated in Figure  2 and the 
SoA for Part 1A is located in Table  10. 
The goal of the study is to seek an ind ication for use of mRNA -1273 (100  µg IM, given as 
2 injections, 28 days apart) in the 12  to < [ADDRESS_1193158] COVID -19 has been established. If an Ab 
threshold of protection has been established, effectiveness will be inferred based on the 
proportion of adolescent study participants with serum Ab levels (on Day 57) that meet or 
exceed the Ab threshold. If an Ab threshold of protection has not been established, effectiveness 
will be inferred by [CONTACT_856840] (i) the GM valu e of serum nAb and (ii) 
the SRR  from adolescent participants compared with those from young adults ( 18 to 25  years of 
age) enrolled in the ongoing clinical endpoint efficacy trial (Study  P301). The statistical 
parameters to infer effectiveness are describe d in Section  2. 
This study in adolescents will monitor all participants for a total of 12 months following the 
second dose of vaccine or placebo. Saf ety assessments will include solicited ARs (7  days after 
each injection), unsolicited AEs (28 days after each injection), MAAEs, SAEs, and AESIs 
(including MIS -C) throughout the study period.  
Blood samples will be collected from all participants at baselin e (Day 1), Day  57 (28  days after 
Dose  2), Day  209 (6 months after Dose  2), and Day  [ADDRESS_1193159] nonvaccine antigen (eg, Ab against the nucleocapsid

Part 1A, the Blinded Phase, comprises 8  scheduled visits including a Screening Visit and 
7 scheduled visits, of which Visit 2 and Visit 4 will be virtual/telephone visits and the other visits 
will be in -clinic visits.  
The study duration will be approximately 14 months, which includes 1 month for Screening  
(Day  ˗28 to Day 1), 1 month for dosing (on Day 1 and Day 29), and, for participants who 
received mRNA -1273 in Part 1A, 12 months of follow -up after the second dose to monitor for 
safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy. Participants who received placebo in Part 1A will still be 
in the study for approximately 14 months total but will be followed for approximately 4 months 
following their second dose of mRNA -1273 in Part 1B before receiving a BD.  
Note: Day 0 and Day 1 may be combined on the same day ( Table  10). 
After providing informed consent/assent, participants will undergo Screening  assessments to 
determine study eligibility. Screening assessments ( Table  10) must be completed after signing 
the ICF/assent form. The investigator will review study entry criteria to determine the participant 
eligibility during the Screening Period.  
Eligible participants will enter the Treatment Period.

will be captured as MAAEs and reported in an expedited time frame to the Sponsor 
(Section  7.4.3 ). 
All participants will be monitored for safety and reactogenicity and provide predose and 
postdose blood specimens for immunogenicity through [ADDRESS_1193164] dose (Day 1) and reminded on the day of the 
second dose (Day  29) how to document and report solicited local or systemic ARs in a provided 
eDiary. Solicited ARs, unsolicited AEs, MAAEs, AEs leading to wit hdrawal, AESIs, and SAEs 
will be assessed as described in Section  7.1, according to the timepoints in the SoA ( Table  10). 
Blood sampling for immunogenicity testing is scheduled throughout the study: on the day of 
injection before the first dose and 1, 6, and 12  months after the second dose.  
Participan ts may experience AEs that necessitate an unscheduled visit, including situations when 
the investigator asks a participant to return to the study clinic for an unscheduled visit following 
the report of an AE. Additional examinations may be conducted at the se visits as necessary to 
ensure the safety and well -being of participants during the study. eCRF  should be completed for 
each unscheduled visit.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Part 1B, the Open -label Observational Phase   
Part 1B, the Open -label Observational  Phase of the study, will be prompted by [CONTACT_856841] a COVID -19 vaccine under an EUA for any persons under the age of 18 years. Par ticipants 
will be transitioned to Part 1B of the study as their age group becomes EUA -eligible. This 
transition permits all ongoing study participants to eventually be informed of the availability and 
eligibility criteria of any COVID -19 vaccine made avail able under an EUA and the option to 
offer all ongoing study participants an opportunity to schedule a Participant Decision Visit to 
know their original treatment assignment (placebo vs. mRNA -1273 100 µg vaccine).  
Part 1B provides the opportunity for study participants to be informed regarding the EUA, to be 
unblinded to their original assignment (mRNA -1273 or placebo), and, for those who previously 
received placebo, to actively request to receive 2 doses of mRNA -1273 (100 µg) vaccine.

3.1.2.  Part 2 Study Design   
Part 2 is an open -label design. The study will evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and 
effectiveness of a 50 μg primary series of mRNA -1273 SARS -CoV -2 vaccine in healthy 
adolescents 12  to < 18 years of age.  
The study schema and major study events for Part 2 participants who receive the booster dose is 
illustrated in Figure  5 and the SoA is located in Table  15. The study schema for Part  2 
participants who d o not receive the booster dose is illustrated in Figure  6 and the SoA is located 
in Table  16. 
This study in adolescents will monitor all participan ts for a total of 12 months following Dose  2 
or booster dose (third dose) of vaccine. Safety assessments will include solicited ARs (7  days 
after each injection), unsolicited AEs (28  days after each injection), MAAEs, SAEs, and AESIs 
(including MIS -C) thro ughout the study period and AEs leading to discontinuation from dosing 
and/or withdrawal from study.  
Blood samples will be collected from all participants at baseline (Day  1) and at specified visits 
presented in Part 2 SoA ( Table  15 for participants who receive the booster dose  and Table  16 for 
participants who d o not receive the booster dose ) for measurement of SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1193173] nonvaccine antigen (eg, Ab against the nucleocapsid protein), which will signify 
infection with SARS -CoV -2. Blood sample will be collected 3 days after Dose 2 or booster dose 
for future biomarker analysis  (ie, inflammatory and/or cardiac biomarkers) . 
The incidence of SARS -CoV -2 infection after mRNA -1273 vaccination will be evaluated.

3.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design   
The single age cohort in this Phase 2/3 study, 12 to <  18 years of age, was established to 
understand the tolerability and immunogenicity of 100 µg (Part 1A) and 50 µg (Part 1C -1, 
Part 1C-2, and Part  2) mRNA -1273, as well as 50 µg (Part 3) mRNA -1273.22 2 in an adolescent 
population. The lower age boundary used in this study is consistent with the definition of 
adolescence provided by [CONTACT_21978] ( Hardin  et al 2017 ). 
With SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1193180] dose of IP during Part 1A, Part 2, and through 6  months 
(for partic ipants who receive Dose 2 ) or [ADDRESS_1193181] NP or nasal swab samples collected  before the injection 
on Day  1 (Part 1A, Part 1C, Part 2, and Part 3 ), Day  29 (Part 1A , Part  2, and Part 3 ), Day 149 
(Part  2 participants who receive  the booster dose) , and Day 181  (Part 3  participants  who receive 
Dose  2); additional  timepoints  are in the SoA (Table  10 and Table  12 through Table  18). 
Furthermore, with any signs or symptoms or MAAE suggesting  SARS -CoV -2 infection in a 
participant, an additional nasal or NP swab sample and a blood sample will be taken to confirm 
the diagnosis of SARS -CoV -2 via serology and RT -PCR. Additionally, clinical information will 
be carefully collected to evaluate the severity of the clinical case.  

ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 92 As it is possible that participants are naturally exposed to SARS -CoV -2 through community 
exposure, the NP or nasal sw ab samples collected before study injection and the serologic assays 
for Ab responses to nonvaccine antigen(s) may help discriminate between natural infection and 
vaccine -induced Ab responses, should such discrimination be needed.  
Part 1B, is the Open -label Observational Phase. During Part 1B of the study, all ongoing study 
participants were permitted (a) to be informed of the availability and eligibility criteria of any 
COVID -19 vaccine made available under an EUA and (b) to schedule a study visit to know their 
original group assignment (placebo vs. mRNA -1273 vaccine). Part 1B also provided the 
opportunity for eligible study participants who previously received placebo to receive 2  doses of 
mRNA -1273 vaccine under open -label conditions.  
Part 1C, the Booster  Phase and Part 2, were prompted by [CONTACT_856842] 2 study (mRNA -1273 -P201).  In Part  A of Study mRNA -1273 -P201, the time 
course and magnitude of antibody (both bAb and nAb) responses to mRNA -1273 was similar 
between 100 µg and 50 µg dose levels (both showing strong immunogenicity) at each 
postbaseline timepoint (Days 29, 43, 57, and 209), although the [ADDRESS_1193182] levels. No new safety signals emerged  upon administration of the 
BD in Study mRNA -1273 -P201. Available data (DMID 21‐0012) also show that heterologous or 
mixed series of COVID -19 vaccine -induced strong immune response in the adult population with 
persons who received an mRNA‐based booster vac cination achieving a four‐fold increase in their 
neutralization response more frequently than those who were boosted with Ad26.COV.S. 
(Atmar  et al 2021 ). 
Part 3 was prompted by [CONTACT_856843] (mRNA -1273.2 14 given as 2  dose 
primary series) showing broader neutralization across divergent lineages. Preclinical mice 
studies also show increased immunogenicity after BD of the BA.1 & BA.4/BA.5 Omicron 
Bivalent Vaccines (mRNA -1273.214 & mRNA -1273.222). Further, mRNA -1273.[ADDRESS_1193183] the 
Omicron subvariants BA.4, BA.5 compared with mRNA -1273 50 μg (nominal α of 0.05) and the 
BA.4, BA.5. nAb response was consistently higher in the mRNA -1273.214 group compared to 
the mRNA -1273 group in participants with and without prior SARS -CoV -2 infection  (although 
higher GMT titers post  BD were observed in t hose who were SARS -CoV -2 positive at pre -BD). 
Data also demonstrate antibody responses 180 days after the 50  μg mRNA -1273.211 BD were 
higher than those after a 50  μg mRNA -1273 BD ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ; Chalkias  et al 2022a ) against 
the ancestral SARS -CoV -2 and Beta, as well as Omicron BA.1 and Delta variants. In additio n, 
the bivalent Omicron BA.4/BA.[ADDRESS_1193184] BA.4/BA.5 compared to mRNA -1273, with no safety 
concerns identified ( Chalkias  et al 2022c). Given the increasing prevalence of SARS -CoV -2 
infection in the community ( Clarke  et al 2022 ), effectiveness of [ADDRESS_1193185]  primary series in unvaccinated baseline SARS -CoV -2 negative young 
adults in Study P301  (GMR of 4.322 [95% CI : 3.274, 5.707 ]). An IA conducted for Part  [ADDRESS_1193186] immunogenicity of a single 50 µg mRNA -1273.222 dose. The pre -specified 
co-primary endpoints were also met allowing inference of vaccine effectiveness of a single dose 
from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_112688] P301. The study vaccine was also well -tolerated after a median of 
~[ADDRESS_1193187], and Choice of Study 
Population   
The 100 g dose level is currently being investigated in a large Phase 3 efficacy study in adults 
18 years of age and older; therefore, based on this and the results of the studies described in 
Section  1.2.2 , the Sponsor intended to study a single dose level of 100 g in Part 1A of this 
Phase  2/3 study in the adolescents age group of 12 to < 18 years of age . 
At the time of study initiation, there were no licensed SARS -CoV -2 vaccines available, and so 
0.9% sodium chloride was used as a placebo control for the safety and immunogenicity 
assessments. The mRNA -1273 vaccine and placebo injections look different, so  administration 
was blinded  in Part 1A of this study ( Section  8.1). 
Interim data from the current Part 1A Study P203 (based on a data snapshot of 08 M ay 2021) 
show that the primary immunogenicity objective was met by [CONTACT_856844] (i) GM value of serum nAb and (ii) the seroconversion rate from adolescent participants 
compared with those from young adults (aged 18 to 25 years) enrolled in the ongoing Phase  3 
efficacy study (Study  P301).  
Following potential EUA of a COVID -19 vaccine for persons under 18 years of age, a study 
amendment was designed to give EUA -eligible participants the opportunity to transition to 
Part 1B, the Open -label Observational Phase ( Figure  3). Transitioning the study to Part 1B, 
open-label Observational Phase, permits (a) all ongoing study participants to be informed of the 
availability and eligibility criteria of any COVID -19 vac cine made available under an EUA and 
(b) the option to offer all ongoing study participants who request unblinding an opportunity to 
schedule a study visit to know their original group assignment (placebo vs. mRNA -1273 [100  µg 
vaccine]). Part 1B, the Open -label Observational Phase, also provides the opportunity for study 
participants who previously received placebo to request to receive 2 doses of mRNA -1273 
(100 µg) vaccine.  
For Part 1C (provision for the option of a single 50 µg BD for eligible participant s during the 
Open -Label Observational Phase ) and for Part 2 (evaluation of 2 doses of 50 µg given 28 days 
apart), the selected [ADDRESS_1193188] Dose 2. In Part  A of Study mRNA -1273 -P201, the time course and magnitude of antibody 
(both bAb and nAb) responses to mR NA-1273 was similar between 100 µg and 50 µg dose 
levels (both showing strong immunogenicity) at each postbaseline timepoint (Days 29, 43, 57, 
and 209), although the 100-µg dose group had numerically greater responses. In Part B of 
Study  mRNA -[ADDRESS_1193189] levels.  
Available data also show that heterologous or mixed series of COVID -19 vaccine -induced strong 
immune response in the adult population ( Atmar  et al 2021 ). In a recent DMID study 
(DMID  21-0012), interim data show Day [ADDRESS_1193190]‐boost neutralization titers ranged from 
676.1 -901.8 IU50/ml for participants boosted with 100 µg mRNA‐1273 compared to 
31.2-382.2  IU50/ml for those boosted with Ad26.COV2.S, and 341.3‐677.9 IU50/mL for those 
boosted with BNT162b2. In general, Day [ADDRESS_1193191]‐boost were highest in 
mRNA -1273 -primed partici pants, followed by [CONTACT_214326]162b2 and Ad26.COV2.S, irrespective of the 
booster vaccine administered ( Atmar  et al 2021 ). 
For Part 3, the rationale for assessment of 50 µg primary series of the bivalent Omicron 
containing vaccine mRNA -1273.222 is based on the preclinical data on bivalent vaccines given 
as primary series (mRNA -1273.214) and as BD (mRNA -1273.222) that show robust 
immunogenicity and broader neutralization across divergent lineages. Clinical data from 
mRNA -1273.214 bivalen t vaccine (given as a 50 µg BD) also show consistent robust 
immunogenicity , regardless of SARS -CoV -2 infection status  in participants (although higher 
GMT titers post  BD were observed in those who were SARS -CoV -2 positive at pre -BD), with 
acceptable safety  profile.  Data also demonstrates antibody responses 180 days after the 50  μg 
mRNA -1273.211 BD were higher than those after a 50  μg mRNA -1273 BD ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ; 
Chalkias  et al 2022a ) against the ancestral SARS -CoV -2 and Beta, as well as Omicron BA.1 and 
Delta variants. In addition, the bivalent Omicron BA.4/BA.[ADDRESS_1193192] BA.4/BA.5 compared 
to mRNA -1273,  with no safety concerns identified ( Chalkias  et al 2022 c).  
These data together with increasing prevalence of SARS -CoV -2 infection in the community

not subsequently random ly assigned to treatment. A minimum set of screen failure information is 
required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failures to meet the CONSORT publishing 
requirements and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimum information 
includes date of informed consent, demography, reason(s) for screen failure, eligibility criteria, 
and information on any SAE that may have occurred from Day  [ADDRESS_1193210] Administered   
The term IP refers to mRNA -1273 (100 g for Part 1A and Part 1B, and 50 µg for Part 1C, and 
Part 2), and 50 µg mRNA -1273 .222 (Part 3) vaccine or placebo (0.9%  sodium chloride) in this 
study.  
The mRNA -1273 is an LNP dispersion of an mRNA encoding the prefusion stabilized S  protein 
of SARS -CoV -2 formulated in LNPs composed of 4 lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (1 proprietary and 3 commercially 
available): the proprietary ionizable lipid SM -102; cholesterol; 1,2 -distearoyl -sn-glycero -
3-phosphocholine (DSPC); and 1 -monomethoxypolyethyleneglycol -2,3-dimyristylglycerol with 
polyethylene glycol of average molecular weight 2000 (1 -monomethoxypolyethyl eneglycol -2,3-
dimyristylglycerol polyethylene glycol 2000 [PEG2000 -DMG]).  
mRNA -1273 injection is provided as a sterile liquid for injection, white to off -white dispersion 
in appearance, at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL in 20 mM Tris buffer containing 87 mg/ mL 
sucrose and 10.7  mM sodium acetate at pH 7.5.  
The Sponsor initiated the development of modified COVID -19 vaccine leveraging the 
mRNA/LNP technology platform against SARS -CoV -2 variant, which incorporates key 
mutations present in Omicron subvariants BA.4 /BA.5. The vaccine IP, mRNA -1273.222, 
contains 2 mRNAs: CX -024414 encoding for the S -2P of Wuhan -Hu-1 and CX -034476 
encoding for the S -2P of Omicron subvariants BA.4/BA.5.  
mRNA -1273.222 will be provided as a sterile solution for injection at a concentratio n of 
0.1 mg/mL in [ADDRESS_1193211] 
a volume of 0.5 mL and contain 50 µg mRNA -1273.222 . 
5.2. Randomization (Part 1A Only)   
Random assignment of participants will use a centralized interactive response technology, in 
accordance with pregenerated randomization schedules.  
5.3. Dosing and Management of mRNA -1273 Vaccine   
5.3.1.  Preparation of Study Vaccine for Injection   
Each dose of IP will be prepared for each participant based on the assigned treatment, as detailed 
in the mRNA -1273 -P203 Pharmacy Manual. For Part 1A and Part 1B, the volume of IP injected 
will be 0.5 mL consisting of either 100  µg dose of mRNA -1273 or placebo (normal saline), as 
detailed in the mRNA -[ADDRESS_1193212] a volume of 0.25  mL and contain mRNA -1273 50  µg. 
For Part 3, each d ose of IP will be prepared for each participant as detailed in the 
mRNA -1273 -P203 Pharmacy Manual. The volume of IP injected will be 0.5 mL and contain 
50 µg mRNA -1273.222.

Confidential  Page 103 5.3.2.  Administration of Study Vaccine   
In the Blinded Phase, Part 1A of the study, each participant will receive 2  doses of IP by [CONTACT_856846], 28 days apart (ie, Day 1 and Day  29) into the deltoid muscle, according to their 
assigned regimen and according to the procedures specified in the mRNA -[ADDRESS_1193213] received in Part 1A. Participants who received placebo in Part 1A will receive 2 doses of 
mRNA -1273 (100 µg) on OL – Day 1 and OL -Day 29 of Pa rt 1B ( Table  12). Preferably, both 
doses should be administered into the nondominant arm.  
For Part 1C, mRNA -[ADDRESS_1193214] a volume of 0.25  mL and contain mRNA -1273 50  µg. 
For Part 2, each participant will receive 2  doses of 50 µg mRNA -1273 by [CONTACT_856847], 28  days 
apart (ie, Day 1, Day  29) into the deltoid muscle, according to the procedures specified in the 
mRNA -1273 -P203 Pharmacy Manual. Preferably, all doses should be administered into the 
nondominant arm.  
For Part 3  Protocol Amendment 5, each participant will receive 2  doses of 50 µg mRNA -
1273.222 by [CONTACT_52596], 6 months  apart (ie, Day 1, Day  181). Protocol Amendment 7 was 
implemented to remove the second dose administration ; thus, some participants will only receive 
1 dose of mRNA -1273.222. The mRNA -1273.222 will be administered into the deltoid muscle, 
according to the procedures specified in the mRNA -1273 -P203 Pharmacy Manual. Preferably, 
all doses should be administered into the nondominant arm.  
At each visit when IP is administered , participants will be monitored for a minimum of 
30 minutes after administration. Assessments will include vital sign measurements and 
monitoring for local or systemic reactions ( Table  10, Table  12, Table  13, Table  14, Table  15, 
Table  16, Table  17, and Table  18). 
Eligibility for a subsequent dose of IP will be determined by [CONTACT_856848]  6. 
The study sites will be appropriately staffed with individuals with basic cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation training/certification. Either on -site resuscitation equipment and personnel or 
appropr iate protocols for the rapid transport of participant to a resuscitation area or facility are 
required.  
5.3.3.  Study Vaccine Delivery and Receipt   
The Sponsor or designee is responsible for the following:  
• Supplying the IP  
• Confirming the appropriate labeling of the IP, so that it complies with the legal 
requirements of the [LOCATION_003]  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 104 The investigator is responsible for acknowledging the receipt of the IP by a designated staff 
member at the study site, including the following:  
• Confirming that the IP was received in good condition  
• Confirming that the temperature during shipment from the Sponsor to the 
investigator’s designated storage location was appropriate  
• Confirming that the Sponsor has authoriz ed the IP for use  
• Ensuring the appropriate dose level of IP is properly prepared using aseptic technique  
Further description of the IP and instructions for the receipt, storage, preparation, administration, 
accountability, and destruction of the IP are des cribed in the mRNA -1273 -P203 Pharmacy 
Manual.  
5.3.4.  Study Vaccine Packaging and Labeling   
The Sponsor will provide the investigator (via the study site pharmacy) with adequate quantitie s 
of IP. The sterile IP is packaged in 10R glass vials with a 5.0 -mL fill volume (Part 1A, Part 1B, 
and Part 1C), a 10R glass vial with an 8.0 mL fill volume (Part 1C and Part 2 only), or a 10R 
glass vial with a 6.3 mL fill volume (Part 1C and Part 2 only) . The IP will have all required 
labeling per regulations and will be supplied to the pharmacy in an unblinded manner. For Part  3, 
the IP will be packaged in a 2R glass vial . 
The IP will be packaged and labeled in accordance with the standard operating proc edures of the 
Sponsor or of its designee, CFR Title 21, ICH GCP guidelines, guidelines for Quality System 
Regulations, and applicable regulations.  
5.3.5.  Study Vaccine Storage   
The IP mu st be stored as per the temperature conditions printed on the IP label in a secure area 
with limited access and protected from moisture and light until it is prepared for administration 
(Section  5.3.1 ). The refrigerator and/or freezer utilized for IP storage should have automated 
temperature recording and a [ADDRESS_1193215] be connected to a backup generator(s). In addition, IP 
accountability study staff are required to keep a temperature log to establish a record of 
compliance with these storage conditions. The study site is responsible for reporting any IP that 
was not temperature controlled during shipment or during storage. Such IP will be retained for 
inspection by [CONTACT_856849].  
5.3.6.  Study Vaccine Accountability   
It is the investigator’s responsibility that the IP accountability study staff maintain accurate 
records in an IP accountability log of rec eipt of all IP, study site IP inventory, IP dispensing, IP 
injections, and return to the Sponsor or alternative disposition of used and unused IP vials.  
A study site monitor will review the inventory and accountability log during study site visits and 
at the completion of the study. Additional details are found in the mRNA -[ADDRESS_1193216] observation of medically 
qualified study staff and appropriately recorded (date and time) in the eCRF. Qualified study site 
staff will confirm that the participant has received the entire dose of IP. If a participant does not 
receive IP or does not receive all of the planned dose, the reason for the missed dose will be 
recorded. Data will be reconciled with study site accountability records to assess comp liance.  
Participants who miss the second  or third dose due to noncompliance with the visit schedule and 
not due to a safety pause will still be required to follow the original visit and testing schedule as 
described in the protocol and their regimen schedu le. Unless consent is withdrawn, a participant 
who withdraws or is withheld from receiving the second  dose will remain in the study and 
complete all safety and immunogenicity assessments required through the participant’s last 
scheduled study visit . 
The st udy site staff are responsible for ensuring that participants comply with the allowed study 
visit windows. If a participant misses a visit, every effort should be made to contact [CONTACT_14311] a visit within the defined visit window (Part 1A , Table  10; Part  1B, 
Table  12; Part 1C , Table  13 and Table  14; Part 2 , Table  15 for participants who receive the 
booster dose and Table  16 for participants who d o not receive the booster dos e; and Part  3, 
Table  17 for participants who receive Dose 2 and Table  18 for participants who receive  a single  
dose. If a participant does not complete a visit within the time window, that visit will be 
classified as a missed visit and the participant will continue with subsequent scheduled study 
visits. All safety requirements of the missed visit will be captured  and included in the subsequent 
visit.

the participant based on the time the medication was administered, the drug’s pharmacology and 
pharmacokinetics, and whether use of the medication will compromise the participant’s safety or 
interpretati on of the data. It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that details regarding the 
concomitant medications are adequately recorded in the eCRF.

Participant from Per-Protocol Analyses  
The use of the following concomitant medications and/or vaccines will not require withdrawal of 
the participant from the study (with the exception of planned or actua l receipt of a nonstudy 
COVID -19 vaccine either under EUA or licensed for Part 1A and 1B only) but may determine a 
participant’s eligibility to receive a second dose or evaluability in the PP analysis (analysis sets

PARTICIPANT WITHDRAWAL  FROM THE STUDY   
6.1. Criteria for Delay of Vaccine Administration   
6.1.1.  Individual Participant Criteria for Del ay of Study Vaccination   
Body temperature (oral) must be measured on dosing visits before vaccine administration. The 
following events constitute criteria for delay of injection, and if either of these events occur at 
the time scheduled for dosing, the participant may receive the study injection at a later date 
within the time window specified in the relevant SoA ( Table  10, Table  12, Table  13, Table  14, 
Table  15, Table  16, Table  17, and  Table  18), or the participant may be discontinued  from dosing 
at the discretion of the investigator ( Section  6.2): 
• Acute moderate or severe infection with or without fever at the time of dosing  
• Fever, defined as body temperature ≥38.0°C/≥100.4°F at the time of dosing  
Participants with a minor illness without fever, as assessed by [CONTACT_093], can be 
vaccinated. Pa rticipants with a fever of ≥38.0°C/ ≥100.4°F will be contact[CONTACT_856854] -evaluated for eligibility. If the investigator 
determines that the participant’s health on the day of dosing temporarily precludes inje ction, the 
visit should be rescheduled within the allowed interval for that visit if possible or at a time the 
participant is clinically stable according to the judg ment  of the investigator.  
If a participant takes a prohibited drug therapy, an injection co uld be delayed within the visit 
window based on the joint decision of the investigator and the CRO’s medical monitor 
(Section  5.5.3 ). 
6.2. Discontinuing St udy Vaccination   
Participants can discontinue study injection (ie, refuse the second dose) for any reason, without 
prejudice to further treatment the participant may need to recei ve. 
The investigator, in consultation with the Sponsor’s medical monitor, may withhold a participant 
from further injection if the participant experiences any of the following:  
• Becomes pregnant  
• Withdrawal of consent (not related to COVID -19) 
• Develops, during the course of the study, symptoms or conditions listed in the 
exclusion criteria ( Section  4.1.2 ) 
• Experiences an AE (other than reactogenicity)  after injection that is considered by [CONTACT_856855] ( Section  7.5.9 ) and is of Grade  3 (severe) or greater 
severity  
• Experience s an AE or SAE that, in the judgment of the investigator, requires IP 
withdrawal due to its nature, severity, or required treatment, regardless of the causal 
relationship to vaccine  
• Experiences an AESI  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 109 • Experiences a clinically significant change in vital s ign measurements, or general 
condition that, in the judgment of the investigator, requires vaccine withdrawal  
• Experiences anaphylaxis clearly related to IP  
• Experiences generalized urticaria related to IP  
The reason(s) for withdrawal from further injection will be recorded in the eCRF.  
If a participant takes a prohibited drug therapy, the investigator could withhold the second  or 
third dose based on a joint decision of the investigator and the CRO’s medical monitor 
(Section  5.5.3 ). 
Every reasonable attempt will be made to follow -up with participants for safety throughout the 
entire scheduled study period according to their regimen, even if the participant does not receive 
the second  dose or misses one or more visits. Unless participants withdraw consent, they are 
expected to remai n in the study and complete all scheduled visits and assessments.  
6.3. Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study   
Participants who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study will not be replaced. A “withdrawal” 
from the study refers to a situation wherein a participant does not return for the final visit 
planned in the protocol. The statistical management of participant withdrawals is discussed in 
Section  8. 
Participants can withdraw consent and withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason, 
without prejudice to further treatment the participant may need to receive. The investigator will 
request that the participant complete all study procedures pending at the time of withdrawal.  
If participant desires to withdraw from the study because of an AE, the investigator will try to 
obtain agreement to follow -up with the particip ant until the event is considered resolved or stable 
and will then complete the EOS eCRF.  
Information related to the withdrawal will be documented in the eCRF. The investigator will 
document whether the decision to withdraw a participant from the study was  made by [CONTACT_513293], as well as which of the following possible reasons was 
responsible for withdrawal:  
• AE (specify)  
• SAE (specify)  
• Death  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Physician decision (specify)  
• Pregnancy  
• Protocol deviation  
• Study terminate d by [CONTACT_2728]  
• Withdrawal of consent by [CONTACT_3445] (specify)  
• Other (specify)  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 110 Participants who are withdrawn from the study because of AEs (including SAEs) must be clearly 
distinguished from participants who are withdrawn for other reasons. Investigators wil l follow -
up with participants who are withdrawn from the study as result of an SAE or AE until resolution 
of the event.  
A participant who withdraws from the study may request destruction of any samples taken and 
not tested, and the investigator must docume nt this in the study site study records.  
If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the Sponsor may retain 
and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent ( Section  10.2.10 ). 
The Sponsor will continue to retain and use all research data that have already been collected for 
the study evaluation, unless the participant has requested destruction of  these samples. All 
biological samples that have already been collected may be retained and analyzed at a later date 
(or as permitted by [CONTACT_427]).  
6.4. Study Pause Rules   
During Part 1A of the study, the investigators, study medical monitor, and Sponsor will monitor 
for events that could trigger a study pause. Study pause rule criteria, events, and thresholds are 
described in Table  5. Although these pause rules are not applicable during Part 1B or Part 1C, 
Part 2, or Part 3, participants will continue to be monitored for the events in Table  5, and the 
Sponsor will be notified if any of these events occur.

Confidential  Page 111 The investigator or designee is responsible for reporting to the Sponsor, via the EDC system 
within 24 hours of  observation, each event that potentially meets any pause rule criterion. The 
Sponsor will inform the DSMB of any event that potentially meets any pause rule criterion. The 
DSMB will review all available study data to adjudicate such events in accordance w ith the 
DSMB charter.  
The Sponsor will notify the CBER within 48  hours in the event of a study pause. In the event of 
a study pause, all safety and immunogenicity assessments will continue PP. The window 
allowance for injection visits may be extended by [CONTACT_856856] 7 days (ie, +14 days) for affected 
participants at the discretion of the Sponsor.  
During Part 1B, Part 1C, Part 2, and Part [ADDRESS_1193223] be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required 
study visit:  
• The study site staff must attempt to contact [CONTACT_286175], counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the 
assigned visit schedule and ascertain whet her the participant wishes to and/or should 
continue in the study.  
• Before a participant is deemed LTFU, the investigator or designee must make every 
effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if 
necessary, a certi fied letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local 
equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_14386] (eg, dates of telephone calls and 
registered letters) should be documented in the participant’s medical record.  
• A participant who continues to be unreachable or continues to be noncompliant with 
study visits or procedures will be considered to have withdrawn from the study.  
• A participant should not be considered LTFU until due diligence has been completed.

Confidential  Page 112 7. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES   
Before performing any study procedures, all potential participants and/or participants’  
parent/LAR will sign an ICF (as detailed in Section  10.2.6 ). Participants will undergo study 
procedures at the timepoints specified in the Part 1A SoA ( Table  10), Part 1B SoA ( Table  12), 
Part 1C ( Table  13 and Table  14), Part 2 ( Table  15 and Table  16), or Part 3 ( Table  17 and 
Table  18). 
After the participant proceeds to the Participant Decision Clinic Visit (Part 1A) of the study, 
participants who received mRNA -1273 in Part 1A will continue to follow the open -label Part  1A 
SoA ( Table  10). Participants who received placebo in Part 1A will transition to the open -label 
Part 1B of the study ( Figure  10) and will follow the Part 1B SoA ( Table  12). Participants in 
Part 1A or Part 1B who transitioned to Part 1C -1, at least [ADDRESS_1193224] dose, will 
follow open -label Part 1C -1 SoA ( Table  13) until study completion.  Participants who remained 
blinded will follow Part 1A SoA. Participants who do not receive a BD will continue with their 
SoA (Part 1A or Part 1B). Eligible participants enrolled in Part 1C -2 will follow Part 1C -2 SoA 
(Table  14). Eligible participants enrolled in Part 2 will follow Part 2 SoA ( Table  15 for 
participants who receive the booster dose and Table  16 for participants who d o not receive the 
booster dose ). Eligible participants enrolled in Part 3 will follow Part 3 SoA ( Table  17 for 
participants who receive Dose 2 and Table  18 for participants who receive  a single dose ). 
A participant can also be seen for an unscheduled visit at any time during the study. An 
unscheduled visit may be prompted by [CONTACT_340097], illness visit criteria for COVID -19, 
or new or ongoing AEs. The study site also has the discretion to make reminder telep hone calls 
or send text messages to inform the participant about visits, review eDiary requirements, or 
follow -up on ongoing or outstanding issues.  
In accordance with “FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during 
COVID -19 Public Health Emergency” ( DHHS  2020 ), investigators may convert study site visits 
to home visits or telemedicine visits with the approval of the Sponsor. Such action should be 
taken to protect the safety and well -being of study partici pants and study site staff or to comply 
with state or municipal mandates.  
General considerations for study assessments and procedures include the following:  
• Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed. The study procedures and their 
timing must be follo wed as presented in  Table  10, Table  12, Table  13, Table  14, 
Table  15, Table  16, Table  17, and  Table  18. Adherence to the study design 
requirements is essential and required f or study conduct.  
• Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the Sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue study 
treatment or participation in the study.  
• All screening evaluations must be compl eted and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log 
to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record 
reasons for screening failure, as app licable.

mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 113 • Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg, 
blood count) and obtained before signing of the ICF may be utilized for screening or 
baseline assessments provided the procedures met the protocol -specified criteri a and 
were performed within the time frame defined in the SoA.  
7.1. Safety Assessments and Procedures   
In Part 1A (blinded), Part 1B (open -label), Part 1C (open -label), Part 2 (open -label), and Part  3 
(open -label) safety assessments will include monitoring and recording of the following for each 
participant, according to the SoA ( Table  10, Table  12, Table  13, Table  14, Table  15, Table  16, 
Table  17, and  Table  18): 
• Solicited local and systemic ARs ( Section  7.5.3 ) that occur during the 7 days 
following each  injection (ie, the day of injection and 6 subsequent days) in Part 1A, 
Part 1C, Part  2, and Part 3. Solicited ARs will be recorded daily using eDiaries 
(Section  7.1.1 ). 
• Unsolicited AEs observed or reported during the 28  days following each injection (ie, 
the day of injection and 27 subsequent days) in Part 1A, Part 1C, Part 2, and Part  3. 
Unsolicited AEs are defined in Section  7.5.1 . 
• AEs leading to discontinuation from dosing (except  for participants who receive  a 
single dose in Part 3) and/or withdrawal from study participation from Day  [ADDRESS_1193225] day of study participation in Part 1A, Part 1B, Part 1C, Part 2, and Part 3  (see 
Section  10.1, Appendix  1 for the SoAs) . 
• MAAEs from first dose on Day  1 through the entire study period in Part 1A, Part 1B, 
Part 1C, Part  2, and Part 3  (see Section  10.1, Appendix 1  for the SoAs) . 
• SAEs from first dose on Day  1 through the entire study period in Part 1A, Part 1B, 
Part 1C, Part  2, and Part 3  (see Section  10.1, Appendix 1  for the SoAs) . 
• AESIs through the entire study period in Part 1A, Part 1B , Part 1C, Part 2, and Part 3  
(see Section  10.1, Appendix 1  for the SoAs) . 
• Vital sign measurements ( Section  7.1.4 ). 
• Physical examination findings ( Section  7.1.5 ). 
• Assessments for SARS -CoV -2 infection  from Day  1 through study completion 
(Section  7.1.6 ). 
• Details of all pregnancies in female participants will be collected after the start of 
study tre atment and until the end of their participation in the study ( Section  7.5.6 ). 
7.1.1.  Use of Electronic Diaries   
At the time of consent/assent, participants or their caregivers must confirm they will be willing to 
complete an eDiary using either an application downloaded to their smartphon e or using a device 
that is provided at the time of enrollment. Before enrollment on Day  1, participants or their 
caregivers will be instructed to download the eDiary application or will be provided an eDiary 
device to record solicited ARs ( Section  7.5.3 ) on Day  1. Participants who were originally 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 114 randomized to placebo and who opt to receive mRNA -1273 will enter the Open -label 
Observational Phase. They  will receive Dose 1 at Day 209 (OL -Day 1), return for their second 
dose at OL -Day 29, and return again at OL -Day 57. Participants who entered the open -label 
phase, may opt to receive a BD in Part 1C -1, and will follow Part 1C -[ADDRESS_1193226] solicited 
ARs. 
In Part 1A, the Blinded Phase, Part 2, and Part 3 at each injection visit, participants or their 
caregivers will be instructed (Day  1) or reminded (Day  29 for Part 1A and Part 2, and Day 181 
for Part 3) on thermometer usage to measure body temperature, ruler usage to measure injection 
site erythema and swelling/induration (hardne ss), and self -assessment for localized axillary 
swelling or tenderness on the same side as the injection arm.  
In Part 1A,  the Blinded Phase, Part 2, and Part [ADDRESS_1193227] the following data in the eDiary:  
• Solicited local and systemic reactogenicity ARs, as defined in Section  7.5.3 , that 
occur on the day of each vaccine administration and during the 7 d ays after vaccine 
administration (ie, the day of injection and 6 subsequent days). If a solicited local or 
systemic AR continues beyond Day  [ADDRESS_1193228]; capture of details of 
ARs in the eDiary should not exceed [ADDRESS_1193229] aff either during the 
next scheduled telephone call or at the next study site visit.  
• Daily oral body temperature measurement should be performed at approximately the 
same time each day using the thermometer provided by [CONTACT_3452]. If body 
temperature i s taken more than once in a given day, only the highest temperature 
reading should be recorded.  
• Measurement, as applicable, for solicited local ARs (injection site erythema and 
swelling/induration); the size measurements will be performed using the ruler 
provided by [CONTACT_3452].  
• Any medications taken to treat or prevent pain or fever on a day of injection or for the 
next 6  days.  
The eDiary will be the only source documents allowed for solicited systemic or local ARs 
(including body temperature measuremen ts). Participants or their caregivers will be instructed to 
complete eDiary entries daily. The participant or their caregiver will have a limited window on 
the following day to complete assessments for the previous day; quantitative temperature

mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 115 recordings and measurement of any injection site erythema or swelling/induration reported on 
the following day may be excluded from the analyses of solicited ARs.  
Any new safety information reported during safety telephone calls or at study site visits 
(including a s olicited reaction) that is not already captured in the eDiary will be described in the 
source documents as a verbally reported event. An event reported in this manner must be 
described as a solicited event and entered on the solicited AR eCRF.  
Study site s taff will review eDiary data with participants at visit (s) 7 days after each injection.  
The eDiary will also be used every 4  weeks, starting at Day  71 through Day  183 and again 
starting at Day  223 through Day  363 for participants in Part 1A ( Table  10), on Day 191 through 
Day 303 and again on Day 343 through Day 455 in Part 2 for participants who receive the 
booster dose ( Table  15), and on Day  99 through Day 183 and again on Day 223 through Day  307 
in Part 2 for participants who do not receive the booster dose ( Table  16) to capture the 
occurrence of AEs, MAAEs, SAEs, AESI, or AEs leading to withdrawal. As specified in the 
applicable SoA (Table  10, Table  15, and Table  16), the eDiary will prompt the participant to 
complete an eDiary questionnai re that collects the following data:  
• Changes in health since last completing the questionnaire or since in contact [CONTACT_271076] . 
• Known exposure to someone with known COVID -19 or SARS -CoV -2 infection . 
• Any experience of symptoms of COVID -19. 
• Any MAAEs  or SAEs . 
If an eDiary record results in identification of relevant safety events according to the study 
period, or of symptoms of COVID -19, a follow -up safety telephone call will be triggered.  
Completion of eDiary questionnaires will alternate with safety  telephone calls ( Section  7.1.2) as 
the procedure for safety follow -up approximately every 4 weeks starting at Day 85 through 
Day 197 and again starting at Day  237 through Day  377 (Part 1A SoA, Table  10), every 4  weeks 
starting at Day 205 through Day 317 and starting again at Day 357 through Day 469 (Part  2, 
Table  15 for participants who receive the booster dose), every 4 weeks starting at Day  113 
through Day  197 and again starting at Day  237 through Day  321 (Part  2, Table  16 for 
participants who do not receive the booster dose), every 6 weeks starting at Day 99 through 
Day 141 (Part 3, Table  17 for participants who receive Dose  2), and every 6 weeks starting at 
Day 99 through Day 141 (Part 3, Table  18 for participants who receiv e a single dose).  
In Part 1C -[ADDRESS_1193230] the 
study site, preferably in the evening, on the day of injection and for 6 days following injection. If 
a solicited local or systemic AR continues beyond Day 7 after vaccination, the participant will be 
prompted to capture details of the solicited local or systemic AR in the eDiary until the AR 
resolves; capture of details of ARs in the eDiary should not exceed 28 days after vaccination. 
ARs recorded in eDiaries beyond Day 7 should be reviewed either via telephone call or at the 
following study visit. Review of eDiary will occur on BD -Day 8.

Based on availability, smartphone devices may be provided to tho se participants who do not 
have their own device to use for eDiary activities.  
7.1.2.  Safety Telephone Calls   
A safety telephone call is a telephone call made to the participant by [CONTACT_856858]. 
This call will follow a script, which will facilitate the collection of relevant safety information.  
Safety telephone calls follow a schedule for each participant as indicated in the Part 1A SoA

The participant will be interviewed according to the script about occurrence of AEs, MAAEs, 
SAEs, AESI, AEs leading to study withdrawal, concomitant medications associated with those 
events , and any nonstudy  vaccinations ( Section  7.5.7 ). In addition, study personnel will collect 
information on known participant exposure to someone with known COVID -[ADDRESS_1193231] will be performed at the Screening Visit (Day  0) and before 
each vaccine dose. At any time, a pregnancy test either via blood or point -of-care urine can be 
performed, at the discretion of the investigator.  
7.1.4.  Vital Sign Measurements   
Vital sign measurements will include systolic and diastol ic blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_862], and body temperature (preferred route is oral). The participant will be seated for at least 
5 minutes before all measurements are taken. Vital signs will be measured at the timepoints 
indicated in the SoAs ( Table  10, Table  12, Table  13, Table  14, Table  15, Table  16, Table  17, and  
Table  18). At dosing visits, vital sign measurements will be collected once before injection and 
at least [ADDRESS_1193232] injection (before participants are discharged from the study site).  
Febrile participants at dosing visits (fever is defined as a body temperature ≥38.0°C/≥100.4°F) 
may have visits rescheduled within the relevant study visit windows. Afebrile participants with 
minor illnesses may be injected at the discretion of the investigator.  
When procedures overlap and are scheduled to occur at the same timepoint, the order of 
procedures should be vital sign measurements and then the blood collection.

Confidential  Page 117 7.1.5.  Physical Examinations   
A full physical examination, including height and weight, will be performed at scheduled 
timepoints as indicated in the Part 1A ( Table  10), Part 1B ( Table  12), and Part 1C ( Table  13 and 
Table  14), Part 2 ( Table  15 and Table  16), and Part 3 ( Table  17 and Table  18) SoAs. The full 
examination will include assessment of skin, head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, neck, thyroid, lungs, 
heart, cardiovascular system, abdomen, lymph nodes, and musculoskeletal system/extremities. 
Any clinically significant finding identified du ring a study visit should be reported as a MAAE.  
Symptom -directed physical examinations may be performed at other timepoints at the discretion 
of the investigator. On each injection day before injection and again 7 days after injection, the 
arm receiving t he injection should be examined and the associated lymph nodes should be 
evaluated. Any clinically significant finding identified during a study visit should be reported as 
a MAAE.  
Body mass index will be calculated at the Screening Visit (Day  0) only.  
7.1.6.  Assessment for SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1193233] NP or nasal swab samples collected for SARS -CoV -2 testing at 
timepoints specified in the SoA (Part 1A, Table  10; Part 1B, Table  12; Part 1C,  Table  13 and 
Table  14; Part 2, Table  15 and Table  16; and Part 3, Table  17 and Table  18). 
For Part 1A, Part 1B, Part 1C, Part 2, and Part 3, a study illness visi t or a consultation will be 
arranged within [ADDRESS_1193234] an NP or nasal swab sample to 
ascertain the presence of SARS -CoV -2 via RT -PCR if a participant experiences any of the 
following:  
• Signs or symptoms of SARS -CoV -2 infectio n as defined by [CONTACT_6750] ( CDC  2020b ). 
• Exposure to an individual confirmed to be infected with SARS -CoV -2. 
• MAAE suggesting a SARS -CoV -2 infection . 
If the participant had known exposure to COVID -19 (eg, exposure to someone with con firmed 
COVID -19), it will be captured in the COVID -[ADDRESS_1193235] additional clinical information, including 
assessments such as medical history, physical examination, blood sampling for clinical 
laborat ory testing,  and nasal, saliva, and/or NP  swab sampling for viral PCR (including 
multiplex PCR for respi[INVESTIGATOR_573847] -CoV -2) to evaluate the severity of the 
clinical case. Radiologic imaging studies may be conducted. All findings will be recorded in the 
eCRF.  
If participants are confirmed to have SARS -CoV -2 infection, the investigator will notify the 
participant, and the participant’s primary care physician, of the diagnosis. If the study participant 
does not have a primary care physician,  the investigator will assist them to obtain one. The 
participant will also be instructed on infection prevention measures consistent with local public 
health guidance.  
Any confirmed symptomatic SARS -CoV -2 infection occurring in participants will be captur ed as 
a MAAE along with relevant concomitant medications and details about severity, seriousness, 
and outcome.  Additionally, a convalescent visit will be scheduled approximately 28  days 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 118 (+7 days) after diagnosis ( Section  7.4.3 ). At this visit, an NP or nasal swab sampling for viral 
PCR and a blood sample will be collected for potential immunologic assessment of 
SARS -CoV -2 infection.  
During the ongoing Omicron -related surge in SARS -CoV -2 infections or if any variant of 
concern -related surge may occur the following alternative process may be used for 
assessment of SARS -CoV -2 infection:  
If an illness visit is not possible due to COVID -[ADDRESS_1193236], to be recorded under an 
unscheduled visit eCRF page, can substitute for a clinic visit.  
If due to COVID -19 related restrictions in the community, the participan t’s LAR performed a 
home test rather than obtaining a test performed by a health care professional, the following 
process should apply:  
• If the participant reports symptoms but home test was negative, the investigator may 
report symptoms as ‘ upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_76099] ’ or other appropriate AE and report 
the negative home test on the local d iagnostic lab page for an unscheduled visit, and 
forego the illness visit.  
• If the participant reports symptoms and the home test was positive, the investigator 
should encourage the family to seek confirmatory PCR -based testing at a local testing 
center o r return to site for an illness visit.  
• If a local confirmatory PCR -based test is obtained, the investigator may report the 
result under an unscheduled visit and forego t he illness visit. A convalescent visit 
should be scheduled if feasible.  
• If due to COVID -[ADDRESS_1193237] under the local diagnostic lab page as an unscheduled visit and forego the illness 
visit. A convalescent visit should be scheduled if feasible.  
7.2. Immunogenicity Assessments   
Blood s amples for immunogenicity assessments will be collected at the timepoints indicated in 
the SoA (Part 1A, Table  10; Part 1B, Table  12; Part 1C, Table  13 and Table  14; Part 2, Table  15 
and Table  16; and Part 3,  Table  17 and Table  18): The following analytes will be measured:  
• Serum nAb level against SARS -CoV-2 as measured by [CONTACT_340053]/or live virus 
neutralization assays  
− Serum bAb levels against SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1193238] the SARS -CoV -2 S protein. Sample aliquots will be designed to ensure that 
backup samples are available and that vial volumes are likely to be adequate for future testing 
needs. The actual time and date of each sample collected  will be recorded in the eCRF, and 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 119 unique sample identif ication will be utilized to maintain the blind at the laboratory at all times 
and to allow for automated sample tracking and housing. Handling and preparation of the 
samples for analysis, as well as shippi[INVESTIGATOR_76818], will be provided in a separate 
study manual.  
Measurement of bAb and nAb levels will be performed in a laboratory designated by [CONTACT_429].  
According to the ICF ( Section  10.2.6 ), serum from immunogenicity testing may be used for 
future research, which may be performed at the discretion of the Sponsor to further characterize 
the immune response to SARS -CoV -2, addition al assay development, and the immune response 
across CoVs.  
The maximum planned volume of blood sampled per participant for immunogenicity 
assessments in 1 day is 21  mL. 
7.3. Exploratory Assessments and Biomarkers   
Exploratory assessments may include assessment of biomarkers for safety, reactogenicity, 
inflammatory and cardiac function. Serologic markers of disease severity, immune response to 
SARS -CoV -2, RT -PCR of NP or nasal swab or sa liva samples, and genetic sequences of 
SARS -CoV -2 strains isolated from participants’ samples may also be measured.  
7.4. Efficacy Assessments   
7.4.1.  Vaccine Effectiveness Assessments   
Vaccine effectiveness for adolescents of ages of 12 to <  18 years will be inferred based on serum 
Ab responses obtained on Day 57 (28 days after the second injection of mRNA -1273)  and 
Day 209 (28 days after the second injection of mRNA1273.222) . Inference will be based on 
assessing the adolescent Ab responses against the following:  
1. If available at the time of analysis , adolescent Ab responses will be assessed against an 
accepted se rum nAb threshold conferring protection against COVID -19. 
2. If an accepted threshold of protection is not available , adolescent Ab responses will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_856859] (Study P301). The statistical parameters to infer 
effectiveness are described in Section  2.

It is important to note that some of the symptoms of COVID -19 overlap with solicited systemic 
ARs that are expected after vaccination with mRNA -1273 (eg, myalgia, headache, fever, and 
chills). During the first [ADDRESS_1193243] an NP or nasal swab sample (for

illness visits ( Section  7.1.6 ). The NP or nasal swab sample will also be tested for the presence of 
other respi[INVESTIGATOR_18073]. Additionally, a convalescent visit will be scheduled approximately 
28 days (+7 days) after diagnosis ( for Part 1A and 1B only) ( Section  7.4.3 ). At this visit, an NP 
or nasal swab sampling for viral PCR and a blood sample will be collected for potential 
immunologic assessment of SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1193244] an 
additional respi[INVESTIGATOR_856777] -CoV -2 testing to be able to render appropriate medical 
care for the study p articipant as determined by [CONTACT_71353].  
Cases are defined as participants meeting clinical criteria based both on symptoms for 
COVID -19 and on RT -PCR detection of SARS -CoV -2 from samples collected within 72 hours 
of the study participant repor ting symptoms meeting the definition of COVID -19. Participants 
who are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_191544] -19 without the opportunity for a clinic or home visit will also 
be considered cases, assuming that the symptomology criteria for COVID -19 are met and a 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_13521] y sample is positive for SARS -CoV -2 by [CONTACT_365138] a clinical laboratory improvement 
amendments -certified laboratory. Investigators are encouraged to try to obtain a respi[INVESTIGATOR_856778], if 
feasible. The investigator should determine if the criteria for severe COVID -19 has been met.  
Severe COVID -19 is defined in Section  7.4.1 . 
All clinical findings will be recorded in the eCRF. All confirmed cases of COVID -19 will be 
captured as MAAEs, along with relevant concomitant medications and details about severity, 
seriousness, and outcome, and will be reported immediately to the Sponso r or designee 
(Section  7.5.4 ). 
7.4.3.  Follow -up/Convalescent Period After Diagnosis with COVID -19  
Any confirmed symptomatic COVID -19 occurring in a participant will be captured as a MAAE 
along with relevant concomitant medications and details about severity, seriousness, and  
outcome. A convalescent visit will be scheduled approximately 28  days (+7 days) after diagnosis 
(for Part 1A and Part 1B only). At this visit, an NP or nasal swab sampling for viral PCR and a 
blood sample will be collected for potential immunologic assess ment of SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1193245] medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in

Confidential  Page 124 Events Meeting the Adverse Event Definition  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an  
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after the first dose of IP even though they may 
have been present before the start of the study  
Events NOT Meeting the Adverse Event Definition  
• Medical or surgica l procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that 
leads to the procedure should be the AE.  
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  
An AR is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the vaccine caused the AE 
(Section  7.5.9 ). For the purposes of investigational new drug safety reporting, “reasonable 
possibility” means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the vaccine and 
the AE.  
An unsolicited AE is any AE reported by [CONTACT_46354] a solicited AR in 
the protocol or is specified as a solicited AR but starts outside the protocol -defined period for 
reporting solicited ARs (ie, for the 7  days after each dose of vaccine).  
7.5.2.  Serious Adverse Events   
An AE (including an AR) is consider ed an SAE if, in the view of either the investigator or 
Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
A death that occurs during the study or that comes to the attention of the investigator 
during the protocol -defined follow -up period must be  reported to the Sponsor, 
whether or not it is considered related to the IP.  
• Is life -threatening   
An AE is considered life -threatening if, in the view of either the investigator or the 
Sponsor, its occurrence places the participant at immediate risk of dea th. It does not 
include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12993], inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856779]/or 
treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient 
setting. The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_76821]. 
Complications that occur during inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_365099]; 
however, if a complication/AE prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_76823], the complicatio n/AE will be recorded as a separate SAE.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 125 • Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal  life functions  
This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle), which may interfere with or prevent 
everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect . 
• Medica lly important event   
Medical judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_856780]. These events should usually be considered 
serious. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiri ng 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.  
7.5.3.  Solicited Adverse Reactions   
The term “reactogenicity” refers to the occurrence and intensity of selected signs and symptoms 
(ARs) occurring after IP injection. The eDiary will solicit daily participant rep orting of ARs 
using a structured checklist ( Section  7.1.1 ). Participants will record such occurrences in an 
eDiary on the day of each dose injection a nd for the 6  days after the day of dosing (Part  1A, 
Part 1C, Part 2, and Part 3 only).  
Severity grading of reactogenicity will occur automatically based on participant entry into the 
eDiary according to the grading scales presented in Table  6 modified from the Toxicity Grading 
Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventative Vaccine Clinical 
Trials ( DHHS  2007 ). 
If a solicited lo cal or systemic AR continues beyond Day [ADDRESS_1193246]; capture of detail s of ARs in the eDiary 
should not exceed 28 days after each vaccination . ARs recorded in the eDiary beyond Day  7 
should be reviewed by [CONTACT_856860]. All solicited ARs ( local and systemic) will be considered causally 
related to dosing.

Any solicited AR that meets any of the following criteria must be entered into the participant’s 
source document and must also be recorded by [CONTACT_3433] e study site staff on the solicited AR page of the 
participant’s eCRF:  
• Solicited local or systemic AR that results in a visit to an HCP; otherwise meets the 
definition of a MAAE  
• Solicited local or systemic AR leading to the participant withdrawing from the  study 
or the participant being withdrawn from the study by [CONTACT_093] (AE leading to 
withdrawal)  
• Solicited local or systemic AR lasting beyond 7 days after injection  
• Solicited local or systemic AR that leads to participant withdrawal from IP  
• Solicit ed local or systemic AR that otherwise meets the definition of an SAE  
7.5.4.  Medically Attended Adverse Events   
A MAAE is an AE that leads to an unscheduled visit to an HCP. This would include visits to a 
study site for unscheduled assessments (eg, abnormal laboratory test results follow -up, 
COVID -19 [Section  7.4.1 ]) and visits to HCPs external to the study site (eg, urgent care, primary 
care physician). Investigators will review unsolicited AEs for the occurrence of any MAAE. 
Unsolicited AEs will be captured on t he AE page of the eCRF.  
All confirmed symptomatic COVID -19 cases ( Section  7.4.1 ) will be recorded as MAAEs and 
reported to the Sponsor or designee imm ediately and in all circumstances within 24 hours, using 
the SAE Mailbox, the SAE Hotline, or the SAE Fax line ( Section  7.5.11 ). The investigator will 
submit any updated COVID -19 case data to the Sponsor within 24  hours of it being available.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Anaphylaxis   
All suspected cases of anaphylaxis should be recorded as MAAEs and reported as SAEs 
(Section  7.5.2 ) based on criteria for a medically important event unless  the event meets other 
serious criteria. As an SAE, the event  should be reported to the Sponsor or designee immediately 
and in all circumstances within 24 hours as per Section  7.5.10  (Reporting SAEs). The 
invest igator will submit any updated anaphylaxis case data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of it 
being available. For reporting purposes, a participant who displays signs/symptoms consistent 
with anaphylaxis as shown below should be reported as a potential case o f anaphylaxis. This is

definition ( Rüggeberg  et al 2007 ). 
Anaphylaxis is an acute hypersensitivity reaction with multi -organ -system involvement that can 
present as or rapi[INVESTIGATOR_14274] a severe life -threatening reaction. It may occur following 
exposure to allergens from a variety of sources. Anaphylaxis is a clinical syndrome characterized 
by: 
• Sudden onset AND  
• Rapi d progression of signs and symptoms AND  
• Involving  2 or more organ systems, as follows:  
− Skin/mucosal : urticaria (hives), generalized erythema, angioedema, generalized 
pruritus with skin rash, generalized prickle sensation, red and itchy eyes

7.5.5.  Adverse Events of Special Interest   
An AESI is an AE (serious or nonserious) of scientific and medical concern specific to the 
Sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and immediate notification b y the 
investigator to the Sponsor is required and documentation is in the form of a case narrative. Such 
events may require further investigation to characterize and understand them. Refer to 
Section  10.4, Appendix [ADDRESS_1193247] be reported to the Sponsor or designee immediately 
and in all circumstances within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event via the EDC system. If 
a site receives a report of a new AESI from a study participant or receives updated data on a 
previously reported AESI and the eCRF has been taken offline, then the site ca n report this 
information on a paper AESI form using the SAE Mailbox, the SAE Hotline, or the SAE Fax 
line ( Section  7.5.11 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Acute Myocarditis and/or  Pericarditis   
These definitions are intended to serve as a guide to help in the reporting of suspected cases of 
myocarditis and/or pericarditis; however, the diagnosis of suspect ed cases is left to the 
investigator’s clinical judg ment . 
The investigator’s medical judgment must be applied when parent(s)/LAR(s) report that a  
participant has symptoms concerning for myocarditis and/or pericarditis per the  CDC case 
definition. Diagnosti c evaluation (eg, EKG, echocardiogram) and laboratory  testing (eg, 
troponin) per the CDC definition of myocarditis and/or pericarditis must be promptly obtained

All suspected cases of probable and confirmed myocarditis, pericarditis, or myopericarditis 
should be recorded as an AESI,  and reported as an SAE, if the event meets seriousness criteria. 
As an SAE, the event should be reported to the Sponsor or designee immediately and in all 
circumstances within 24 hours as per Section  7.5.12 . The investigator will submit any updated 
myocarditis, pericarditis, or myopericarditis case data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of it being 
available. For reporting purposes, a participant wh o displays signs/symptoms consistent with the 
CDC case definitions as described below ( Gargano  et al 2021 ), should be reported as a potential 
case of confirmed or probable myocarditis, pericarditis, or myopericarditis.

Some individual s may fulfill full or partial criteria for Kawasaki disease but should be reported if 
they meet the case definition for MIS -C. Consider MIS -C in any pediatric death with evidence of 
SARS -CoV -2 infection.  
All cases of MIS -C will be reported to the Sponsor o r designee immediately and in all 
circumstances within 24 hours, using the SAE Mailbox, the SAE Hotline, or the SAE Fax line 
(Section  7.5.11 ). 
7.5.6.  Record ing and Follow -up of Pregnancy   
Female individuals who have a positive pregnancy test at Screening should not be enrolled; 
participants who have a positive pregnancy test any time  during the study should receive no 
further dosing with IP but should be asked to remain in the study and be monitored for safety.  
Details of all pregnancies in female participants will be collected after the start of study 
treatment and until the end of t heir participation in the study.  
• If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator should inform the Sponsor within 24 hours 
of learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in this section.  
• Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abo rtion, fetal death, stillbirth, 
congenital  anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs.  
Pregnancies occurring in participants after enrollment must be reported to Sponsor or designee 
within 24 hours of the study site learning of its occurrence, using  the SAE Mailbox, the SAE 
Hotline, or the SAE Fax line ( Section  7.5.11 ). If the participant agrees to submit this information, 
the pregnancy must be followed to determine the outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary 
termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital 
abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications. This follow -up should occur even if 
intended duration of the safety follow -up for the study has ended. Pregnancy report forms will be 
distributed to the study site to be used for this purpose. The investigator must immediately 
(within 24  hours of awareness) report to the Sponsor any pregn ancy resulting in an abnormal 
outcome according to the procedures described for SAEs.  
7.5.7.  Eliciting and Documenting Adverse Events   
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs are recorded in the eCRF and 
reported to the Sponsor.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 132 Solicited ARs will be collected from Day 1 through 7 days after each dose in Part 1A, Part 1C, 
Part 2, and Part 3. Other (unsolicited) AEs will be collected from Day [ADDRESS_1193250] question to 
elicit any medically related changes in their well -being (including COVID -19 symptoms) 
according to the sc ripts provided. Participants will also be asked if they have been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], 
had any accidents, used any new medications, changed concomitant medication regimens (both 
prescription and over -the-counter medications), or had any nonstudy  vaccinations.  
In addition to participant observations, physical examination findings, or data relevant to 
participant safety classified as an AE will be documented on the AE page of the eCRF.  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively foll ow each participant 
at subsequent visits/contacts. All AEs and SAEs will be treated as medically appropriate and 
followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is 
LTFU (as defined in Section  6.4). 
7.5.8.  Assessment of Intensity   
An event is defined as “serious” when it meets at least on e of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE ( Section  7.5.2 ), NOT when it is rated as severe.  
The severity (or intensity) of an AR or AE refers to the extent to which it affects the participant’s 
daily activities. The Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy  Adult and Adolescent Volunteers 
Enrolled in Preventative Vaccine Clinical Trials ( DHHS  2007 ) will be used to categorize local 
and systemic reactogenicity events ( solicited ARs ), and vital sign measurements observed during 
this study. Specific criteria for local and systemic reactogenicity events are presented in 
Section  7.5.3 . 
The determination of severity for all unsolicited AEs should be made by [CONTACT_856861]:  
• Mild: These events do not interfere with the participant’s daily activities.  
• Moderate: These eve nts cause some interference with the participant’s daily activities 
and require limited or no medical intervention.  
• Severe: These events prevent the participant’s daily activity and require intensive 
therapeutic intervention.  
Study staff should elicit from  the participant the impact of AEs on the participant’s activities of 
daily living to assess severity and document appropriately in the participant’s source 
documentation. Changes in the severity of an AE should be documented in the participant’s 
source do cumentation to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of 
intensity to be performed. An AE characterized as intermittent requires documentation of onset 
and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. An AE that fluctuates in severity during the cours e of the event is 
reported once in the eCRF at the highest severity observed . 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 133 7.5.9.  Assessment of Causality   
The investigator’s assessment of an AE’s relationship to IP is part of the d ocumentation process 
but is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study.  
The investigator will assess causality (ie, whether there is a reasonable possibility that the IP 
caused the event) for all AEs and SAEs. The relationship will  be characterized using the 
following classification:  
Not related:  There is not a reasonable possibility of a relationship to the IP. Participant did not 
receive the IP OR temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to administration of the IP is not 
reason able OR the AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_76881].  
Related:  There is a reasonable possibility of a relationship to the IP. There is evidence of 
exposure to the IP. The temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to the administration of t he IP 
is reasonable. The AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_340116].  
7.5.10.  Reporting Adverse Events   
The investigator is responsible for reporting all AEs that are obse rved or reported during the 
study, regardless of their relationship to IP or their clinical significance. If there is any doubt as 
to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported.  
All unsolicited AEs reported or observed during the  study will be recorded on the AE page of the 
eCRF. Information to be collected includes the type of event, time of onset, 
investigator -specified assessment of severity (impact on activities of daily living) and 
relationship to IP, time of resolution of th e event, seriousness, as well as any required treatment 
or evaluations, and outcome. The unsolicited AEs resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions 
to concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent medications, or progression of disease states must 
also be reported. All AEs will be followed until they are resolved or stable or judged by [CONTACT_661718]. The MedDRA will be used to code all unsolicited 
AEs.  
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the partici pant is screened but does not 
deteriorate should not be reported as an unsolicited AE. However, if it deteriorates at any time 
during the study, it should be recorded as an unsolicited AE.  
7.5.11.  Reporting SAEs   
Prompt notification by [CONTACT_856862] a study 
intervention under clinical investigation are met.  
Any AE considered serious by [CONTACT_11770] ( Section  7.5.2 ) must be 
reported to the Sponsor immediately (within 24  hours of becoming aware of the SAE) via the 
EDC system. The investigator will assess whether there is a reasonable possibility that the IP 
caused the SAE. T he Sponsor will be responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities 
of any SAE as outlined in the [ADDRESS_1193251] information is to be used 
for SAE reporting:  
ModernaTX, Inc.

Confidential  Page 134 • SAE Mailbox:  
• SAE Fax line:  
Regulatory reporting requirements for SAE are described in Section  7.5.15 . 
The investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE, including SAEs, and remain responsible for 
following up AEs that are serious, considered related to IP or study procedures, or that caused 
the participant to discontinue the  study.  
7.5.12.  Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information   
Medical occurrences that begin before the start of IP dosing but after obtaining informed consent 
will be recorded in the Medical History/Current Medical Conditions Section of the eCRF and not 
in the AE Section; however, if the conditi on worsens at any time during the study, it will be 
recorded and reported as an AE.  
Adverse events may be collected as follows:  
• Observing the participant  
• Receiving an unsolicited complaint from the participant  
• Questioning the participant in an unbiased and  nonleading manner  
Solicited ARs will be collected from the day of injection through 6  days after each dose. Other 
(unsolicited) AEs will be collected from the day of injection through [ADDRESS_1193252] day of study participation.  
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor  or designee immediately and in all 
circumstances within 24  hours. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the 
Sponsor within 24  hours of it being available.  
An abnormal value or result from a clinical or laboratory evaluation can also indicate an AE if it 
is determined by [CONTACT_11150] (eg, leads to dose modification or 
study drug discontinuation, or meets  any serious criteria). If this is the case, it must be recorded 
in the source document and as an AE on the appropriate AE form(s). The evaluation that 
produced the value or result should be repeated until that value or result returns to normal or is 
stabi lized and the participant’s safety is not at risk.  
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs after EOS participation. However, if 
the investigator learns of any SAE (including a death) at any time after a participant has 
withdrawn from or completed the study, and the investigator conside rs the event to be reasonably 
related to the IP or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor.  
7.5.13.  Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs   
Electronic diaries hav e specifically been designed for this study by [CONTACT_1034]. The diaries will 
include prelisted AEs (solicited ARs) and intensity scales; they will also include blank space for 
the recording of information on other AEs (unsolicited AEs) and concomitant 
medi cations/vaccinations.

information adequate to determine the outcome of t he AE and to assess whether the AE meets 
the criteria for classification as an SAE requiring immediate notification to the Sponsor or its 
designated representative.  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and 
nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about the 
occurrence of AE.  
7.5.14.  Follow -up of AEs and SAEs   
After the initial AE/SAE report, the invest igator is required to proactively follow each participant 
at subsequent visits and contacts.  
All AEs and SAEs will be treated as medically appropriate and followed until resolution, 
stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is LTF U, as defined in 
Section  6.4. 
7.5.15.  Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs   
• Prompt notification by [CONTACT_856863] a study intervention under clinical investigation are met.  
• The Sponso r has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority 
and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical 
investigation. The Sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements 
relating t o safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRBs, and investigators.  
• Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reaction according to local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and forwarded 
to investiga tors as necessary.  
• An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other 
specific  safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will 
review and then file it along with the IB and will notify the IRB, i f appropriate 
according to local requirements.  
7.6. Safety Monitoring   
The CRO’s medical monitor, the Sponsor’s medical monitor, and the individual study site 
investigators will monito r safety throughout the study . 
7.6.1.  Data Safety Monitoring Board   
Safety oversight will be under the direction of a DSMB composed of external independent 
consultants with relevant expertise. Members of the DSMB will be independent from the study 
conduct and free of conflict of interest.

7.6.2.  Independent Cardiac Event Adjudication Committee   
An independent CEAC of medically qualified personnel, including cardiologists, will review all 
suspected cases of myocarditis and pericarditis to determine if they meet CDC criteria of 
“probable” or “confir med” events which are reported in ongoing interventional clinical trials per 
the CEAC charter ( Gargano  et al 2021 ). Any case that the CEAC assesses as representing 
probable or confirmed cases of myocarditis or pericarditis will be referred to the Sponsor, who 
will then determine if additional action is needed.  
The CEAC will operate under the rules of an approved charter that will be written and reviewed 
at the organizational meeting of the CEAC. Details regarding the CEAC co mposition, 
responsibilities, procedures, and frequency of data review will be defined in its charter.

This section summarizes the planned statistical analysis strategy and procedures for the study.  
The details of statistical analysis will be provided in the SAP, which will be finalized before the 
clinical database lock for the study. If changes are made to primary and/or key secondary 
objectives and hypotheses or the statistical methods related to t hose hypotheses after the study 
has begun but prior to any data unblinding, then the protocol will be amended (consistent with 
ICH Guideline E9). Changes to other secondary or exploratory analyses made after the protocol 
has been finalized, along with an e xplanation as to when and why they occurred, will be listed in 
the SAP or CSR for the study. Ad hoc exploratory analyses, if any, will be clearly identified in 
the CSR.  
8.1. Blinding and Responsibility for Analyses   
See Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  regarding the addition of a Participant Decision Visit as part of this protocol 
amendment.  
Part 1A of this study is observer -blind. The investigator, study staff, study participants, study sit e 
monitors, and Sponsor personnel (or its designees) will be blinded to the IP administered until 
study end or initiation of Part 1B or Part 1C or Part 2, with the following exceptions:  
• Unblinded pharmacy personnel (of limited number) will be assigned to v accine 
accountability procedures and will prepare and administer mRNA -1273 (or placebo) 
to all participants. These pharmacy personnel will have no study functions other than 
study vaccine management, documentation, accountability, preparation, and 
administ ration. They will not be involved in participant evaluations and will not 
reveal the identity of IP to either the participant or the blinded study site personnel 
involved in the conduct of the study unless this information is necessary in the case of 
an em ergency.  
• Unblinded study site monitors, not involved in other aspects of monitoring, will be 
assigned as the IP accountability monitors. They will have responsibilities to ensure 
that study sites are following all proper IP accountability, preparation, and  
administration procedures.  
• An unblinded statistical and programming team will perform the preplanned IA 
(Section  8.7.1 ). Sponsor team members will be  prespecified to be unblinded to the IA 
results and will not communicate the results of IA to the blinded investigators, study 
site staff, clinical monitors, or participants. This is detailed in the study Data Blinding 
Plan.  
In Part 1A, the dosing assignme nt will be concealed by [CONTACT_856865] a secure location that is not accessible or visible to other study staff. 
An opaque sleeve over the syringe used for injection will maintain the blind at the time of 
injectio n, as the doses containing mRNA -[ADDRESS_1193256] or 
execution of the subsequent course of the study. The study Data Blinding Plan provides details of 
the blinding/unblinding process and personnel. The study site staff, investigators, study monitors, 
and participants will remain  blinded until the initiation of Part 1B or Part 1C or Part 2.  
8.1.1.  Breaking the Blind   
A participant or participants may be unblinded in the event of an SAE or other severe event, or if 
there is a medical emergency requiring the identity of the product to be known to properly treat a 
participant. If a participant becomes seriously ill or pregnant during the study, the blind will be 
broken if knowledge of the administered vaccine will a ffect that participant’s dosing options. In 
the event of a medical emergency requiring identification of the vaccine administered to an 
individual participant, the investigator will make every attempt to contact [CONTACT_856866] 24  hours of opening the code. The 
investigator will be responsible for documenting the time, date, reason for the code break, and 
the names of the personnel involved.  
In addition to the aforementioned situations where the blind may be broken, the data will also be 
unblinded to a statistical team at specified timepoints for IA as outlined in Section  8.7.1 . 
8.2. Statistical Hypothesis   
8.2.1.  Part  1  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Part  1A  
If an accepted serum Ab threshold of protection against COVID -19 is established for the primary 
immunogenicity objective, the null hypothesis is that the percentage of participants on 
mRNA -1273 with serum Ab equal to or above the established threshold at Day  57 is ≤  70% (ie, 
H0: percentage of participants on mRNA -1273 ≤  70% with serum Ab at Day  57 equal to or 
above the established threshold).  
The study would be considered as meeting the immunogenicity  objective if the 95% CI of 
percentage of participants on mRNA -1273 rules out 70% (lower bound of the 95%  CI > 70%).  
If an accepted serum Ab threshold of protection against COVID -19 is not available for the 
primary immunogenicity objective, the immunogenic ity analysis of primary vaccine response 
will be performed using the noninferiority tests of the 2 null hypotheses based on the 2 
coprimary endpoints, respectively.  
Coprimary endpoint 1: Ab GM value  at Day  57 
The null hypothesis  H10: immunogenicity response to mRNA -1273 as measured by [CONTACT_856867] 57 is inferior in adolescents (12 to <  18 years of age) compared with that in young 
adults ( 18 to 25  years of age) using mRNA -1273 Study  P301 data.

of age) is demonstrated by [CONTACT_856806] 95%  CI of the GMR rules out 0.6 67 
(lower bound >0.667) using a noninferiority margin of 1.5. The GMR is the ratio of the GM 
value of adolescen ts on mRNA -1273 in this study, Study P203, at Day 57 compared with the 
GM value of young adults ( 18 to 25  years of age) on mRNA -1273 in Study  P301 . 
Coprimary endpoint 2: Ab SRR  at Day  57 
A definition of seroresponse will be provided in the SAP based on for thcoming information 
about assay performance.  
The null hypothesis  H20: immunogenicity response to mRNA -1273 as measured by [CONTACT_340056] 57 is inferior in adolescents (12 to <  18 years of age) compared with that in young adults 
(18 to 25  years of age) using mRNA -1273 Study  P301 data.  
The noninferiority in SRR  in adolescents compared with that in young adults ( 18 to 25  years of 
age) is demonstrated by [CONTACT_856806] 95%  CI of the SRR  difference rules 
out -10% (ie, lower bound >-10%) using the noninferiority margin of 10%. The SRR  difference 
is defined as the rate in adolescents receiving mRNA -1273 minus the rate in young adults (18  to 
25 years of age) receiving mRNA -1273 from Study  P301.  
The study would be considered as meeting  the primary immunogenicity objective if 
noninferiority is demonstrated based on both coprimary endpoints.  
Details regarding the assay to be used to assess noninferiority will be provided in the SAP.

8.5.3.  Immunogenicity Analyses  in Part 1   
The SAP will describe the complete set of immunogenicity analyses, including the approach to 
sample participants into an Immunogenicity Subset for analysis of immunogenicity. The PP 
Immunogenicity Subset is the primary analysis set for immunogenicity unless otherwise 
specified. The primary immunogenicity objective of this study is to use the immunogenicity 
response to infer efficacy in adolescents (12  to <18  years in this study). The primary 
immunogenicity analysis is performed in Part 1A.  
If an accepted serum Ab thresh old of protection against COVID -19 is available based on data 
from other mRNA -1273 studies or external data, the number and percentage of participants with 
Ab greater than or equal to the threshold at Day  57 will be provided with a 2 -sided 95% CI using 
the Clopper -Pearson method. If the lower bound of the 95% CI on the mRNA -1273 group is 
>70%, the primary immunogenicity objective of this study will be considered to be met.  
The percentage of participants with serum Ab greater than or equal to the threshold w ith 95% CI 
will be provided at each postbaseline timepoint. The CI will be calculated using the 
Clopper -Pearson method.  
If an accepted serum Ab threshold of protection against COVID -19 is not established, the 
noninferiority of primary vaccine response as m easured by [CONTACT_856878] ( 18 to 25  years of age) receiving mRNA -1273 will be 
assessed. The study is considered as meeting the primary immunogenicity objective if the 
noninferiority of the immune resp onse to mRNA -1273 as measured by [CONTACT_856879] 57 is demonstrated in adolescents in this study at a 2 -sided α of 0.05, compared with that 
in young adults ( 18 to 25  years of age) in Study  P301 receiving mRNA -1273.  
An ANCOVA model will be carr ied out with Ab value at Day 57 as a dependent variable and a 
group variable (adolescents in Study P203 and young adults in Study  P301) as the fixed variable. 
The GM values of the adolescents at Day 57 will be estimated by [CONTACT_340077]. 
The GMR (ratio of GM values) will be estimated by [CONTACT_76854]. A 
corresponding 2 -sided 95% CI will be provided to assess the difference in immune response for 
the adolescents in Study P203 compared to the young adults ( 18 to 25  years of age) i n Study 
P301 at Day  57. The noninferiority of immune response to mRNA -1273 as measured by [CONTACT_856880] 95%  CI of the GMR is >0.667 
based on the noninferiority margin of 1.5.

and young adults ( 18 to 25  years of age) receiving mRNA -1273 in Study P301  will be calculated 
with 95% CI. The noninferiority in SRR  of adolescents in Study P203 compared to young adults 
(18 to 25  years of age) in Study P301 will be considered demonstrated if the lower bound of the 
95% CI of the SRR  difference is >-10%, based on  the noninferiority margin of 10%.  
In addition, the GM level of specific nAb and bAb with corresponding 95% CI will be provided 
at each timepoint. The 95% CIs will be calculated based on the t -distribution of the log 
transformed values then back transforme d to the original scale. The GMFR of nAb and bAb with 
corresponding 95% CI will be provided at each timepoint with Day  [ADDRESS_1193282]. Descriptive summary statistics including median, minimum, and maximum will also 
be provided.

incidence rate will be provided by [CONTACT_43108], calculated as the numb er of cases divided 
by [CONTACT_129264] -time. The incidence rate ratio of mRNA -1273 versus placebo may be 
provided with its 95% CI computed using the exact method conditional upon the total number of 
cases adjusted by [CONTACT_129264] -time.  
For SARS -CoV -2 infection (serologically confirmed SARS -CoV -2 infection or COVID -19), 
regardless of symptomatology or severity, infection rate will be provided by [CONTACT_43108]. 
The infection rate ratio of mRNA -1273 versus placebo may be provided with its 95% CI using  
the exact method conditional upon the total number of cases adjusted by [CONTACT_129264] -time. 
The incidence rate of asymptomatic SARS -CoV -2 infection will also be provided.  
The secondary efficacy analyses will be performed in the PP set, with sensitivity  analyses in the 
FAS, mITT Set, and mITT1 Set.  
8.5.5.  Long -term Analysis (Including Part 1B)   
Long -term analysis will be performed including data collected in the Open -label Observationa l 
Phase (Part 1B), and prior to BD if a BD is received. The analysis will include participants who 
are randomized to mRNA -1273 in Part 1A and remained in the study with or without unblinding, 
and participants who are originally randomized to placebo and la ter crossed over to receive 
mRNA -1273 in Part 1B after unblinding. Long -term analysis of applicable safety, efficacy, and 
immunogenicity endpoints will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_856881]  9 without treatment group comparison.  
In the long -term safety analysis, unsolicited AEs (SAE, AESI, MAAE, and AE leading to 
discontinuation) and deaths will be summarized.  
In the long -term immunogenicity analysis, nAb and bAb values will be summarized at specified

Omicron BA.4/BA.5 and the ancestral  strain at Day 29 after Dose 1 of 50 µg m RNA -1273.222 in 
baseline SARS -CoV -2 positive adolescents in Study P203 compared with those at Day 57 after 
Dose 2  of 100 µg mRNA -1273 in baseline SARS -CoV -2 negative adults 18 to 25 years of age in 
Study P301), the following analyses will be performed for the respective hypothesis testing:  
An ANCOVA model will be carried out with Ab value at Day 29 in P203 and Ab value at 
Day 57 in P301 as a dependent variable and a group variable ( baseline SARS -CoV -2 positive 
adolescents in Study P203 and baseline negative  SARS -CoV -2 young adults in Study  P301) as

8.5.9.  Exploratory Analyses   
Exploratory analyses will be described in the SAP before database lock.  
8.5.10.  Subgroup Analyses   
Subgroup analyses will be performed as described in the SAP.  
8.6. Multiplicity Adjustment   
A hierarchical sequential hypothesis testing (fixed -sequence) method will be used to adjust 
multiplicity to preserve the family -wise type I error rate ( α = 0.05). The hypothesis testing for the 
2 coprimary endpoints (GMT and SRR) for the primary series of mRNA -1273 in Part 1A was 
completed and statistically significant based on data snapshot dated 08 May 2021, and thus the α 
level of 0.05 can be passed to P art 1C -1 hypothesis testing. In Part 1C -1 Homologous Booster 
Phase, the hypothesis testing for the 2 coprimary endpoints (GMT and SRR against the ancestral  
strain) after BD of mRNA -1273 will be tested at α level of 0.05. The testing in Part 1A and 1C -1 
will continue through the sequence only until an endpoint is not statistically significant (did not 
meet specified noninferiority success criteria), in which case the testing will stop. If the 
hypothesis testing for the 2  coprimary endpoints in Part 1C -1-Homo logous Booster Phase is 
statistically significant (meeting the noninferiority success criteria of the coprimary endpoints), 
the α level of 0.[ADDRESS_1193290] variant(s) of interest, the 
key secondary endpoints will be analyzed independently, given that prototype vaccine 
mRNA -1273 does not contain variant specific sequences.  
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 153 Part  3 
Since the hypothesis testing for the coprimary endpoints in Part 1C -1 was statistically significant 
based on an IA with a data cutoff dated 16 May 2022, the α level of 0.05 (two -sided) was passed 
to Part 3 hypothesis testing.  
8.7. Study Analyses   
8.7.1.  Interim Analyses   
More than one IA may  be performed.  
• The IA of immunogenicity, safety, and e fficacy will be performed after Day  [ADDRESS_1193291] 
1500  participants (1,000  participants receiving mRNA -1273) have completed Day  57 
(1 month after Dose  2, Part 1A). This IA will be considered  the primary analysis of 
immunogenicity for Part 1A.  
• An IA of immunogenicity and safety may be performed after all or subset of 
participants who receive BD have completed BD -Day 29 after the BD in Part 1C -1. 
• An IA of immunogenicity and safety may be perfor med after all or subset of 
participants who receive heterologous BD have completed BD -Day 29 after the BD in 
Part 1C -2. 
• An IA of immunogenicity and safety may be performed after Day [ADDRESS_1193292] completed Day 57 
(1 month after Dose 2, Part 2).  
• An IA of immunogenicity and safety may be performed after all or a subset of 
participants who receive [ADDRESS_1193293] completed Day 29 
(1 month after Dose  1). 
• At the Sponsor’s discretion, a CSR may be developed for an IA.  
8.7.2.  Final Analysis   
The final analysis of all applicable endpoints will be performed after all participants have 
completed all planned st udy procedures. Results of this analysis will be presented in a final CSR, 
including individual listings.

Note : In accordance with FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during COVID -19 Pub lic Health Emergency (DHHS  2020 ), investigators may convert 
study site visits to home visits or telemedicine visits with the approval of the Sponsor.  
Note: If during the Participant Decision Visit (Table  11) the participant is unblinded and determined to have received 2 doses of mRNA -1273 in Part 1A, due to statistical 
considerations, they will be c onsidered in the Open -label Observational Phase but will continue to follow the Part 1A SoA. 
1. Day 0 and Day 1 may be combined on the same day. Additionally, the Day 0 Visit may be performed over multiple visits if preformed within the 28 -day Screening windo w. 
2. All scheduled study visits should be completed within the respective visit windows. If the participant is not able to attend a study site visit due to the  COVID -19 pandemic 
(self-quarantine or disruption of study site activities following business continuity plans and/or local government mandates for “s tay at home” or “shelter in place”), a safety 
telephone call to the participant should be made in place of the st udy site visit. The safety telephone call should encompass all scheduled visit assessments that can be 
completed remotely, such as assessment for AEs and concomitant medications (eg, as defined in scheduled safety telephone call s). Home visits will be perm itted for all

7. Physical examination: A full physical examination, including height and weight, will be performed at Day  1, Day  29, Day  57, Day  209, and Day  394. BMI will be calculated 
only at Screening Visit (Day  0). Symptom -directed physical examinations may be performed at other timepoints at the discretion of the investigator. On each injection day 
before injection and again 7 days after injection, the arm receiving the injection should be examined and the associated lymp h nodes should be evaluated. Any clinically 
significant finding identi fied during a study visit should be reported as a MAAE. Vital signs are to be measured predose and postdose on days of injection (Day  1 and 
Day 29). When applicable, vital signs should be measured before blood collection. Participants who are febrile (body  temperature ≥  38.0°C/100.4°F) before injection on 
Day [ADDRESS_1193326] b e collected prior to dosing of injection on Day  1. 
10. The nasopharyngeal or nasal swab sample will be used to ascertain the presence of SARS -CoV -2 via RT -PCR.  
11. An unscheduled visit may be prompted by [CONTACT_340097], illness visit criteria for C OVID -19, or new or ongoing AEs. If a participant meets the prespecified criteria of 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_340004] -19 (Section  7.1.6 ), the participants will be asked to return within 72 hours or as soon as possible to the study site for an unscheduled illne ss visit, to 
include an NP or nasal swab sample (for RT -PCR testing)  and other clinical evaluations. If a study site visit is not possible, a home visit may be arranged to collect the NP or 
nasal sample and conduct clinical evaluations. If a home visit is not possible, the participant will be asked to submit a sal iva sampl e to the study site by a Sponsor -approved 
method. At this illness visit, the NP or nasal swab samples will be collected to evaluate for the presence of SARS -CoV -2 infection. NP or nasal swab samples will also be 
tested for the presence of other respi[INVESTIGATOR_233815]. If due to COVID -19 related restrictions in the community, the participant’s LAR performed a home test rather than 
obtaining a test performed by a health care professional, see Section  7.1.[ADDRESS_1193327] an additional NP or nasal sample for SARS -CoV -2 testing to 
be able to render appropriate medical care for the study participant as determined by [CONTACT_856887]. Additionally, clinical information will be carefully collected to 
evaluate the severity of the clinical case.  
12. A convalescent visit will be scheduled approximately 28 days (+7 days) after diagnosis. At this visit, an NP or nasal swab sa mpling for vir al PCR and a blood sample will be 
collected for potential immunologic assessment of SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1193328]; capture of details of ARs in the eDiary sho uld not exceed [ADDRESS_1193329] information on known participant exposure to someone 
with know n COVID -19 or SARS -CoV -2 infection and on participant experience of COVID -19 symptoms.  
15. All concomitant medications and nonstudy  vaccinations will be recorded through 28 days after each injection; all concomitant medications relevant to or for the treatm ent of 
an SAE or MAAE will be recorded from Day  1 through the final visit (Day  394).

1. A BD may be administered to all participants who are currently enrolled in Part 1A or Part 1B provided there are no current c ontraindications for further 
dosing ( Section  6). A participant who is currently in the Convalescent Period may come in for a BD -1 visit and receive a BD as long they are no longer 
symptomatic, an d this includes the possibility for a Convalescent Visit Day 28 to overlap and be combined with a BD -1 visit.  
2. Symptom -directed physical examination will be performed at the BD -Day 1. On dosing day before injection, the arm receiving the injection should be  
examined and the associated lymph nodes should be evaluated. At visits BD -2 (BD -D29), BD -3 (BD -D181) and BD -4 (BD -D361), a symptom -directed 
physical examination may be performed at the discretion of the investigator. Any clinically significant finding ide ntified during a study visit should be 
reported as a MAAE. Vital signs are to be collected predosing  and postdosing (participant will be seated for at least 5 minutes before all measurements are 
taken per Section  7.1.4 ) on the day of injection (BD -D1). Participants who are febrile (body temperature ≥  38.0°C/100.4°F) before dosing (BD -D1) must be 
rescheduled to receive the injection. Afebrile participants with minor illnesses can be vaccinated at the discretion of the investigator.

site for an unsched uled illness visit, to include an NP or nasal swab sample (for RT -PCR testing) and other clinical evaluations. If a study site visit is not 
possible, a home visit may be arranged to collect the nasal swab sample and conduct clinical evaluations. If a home visit is not possible, the participant will 
be asked to submit a saliva sample to the study site by a Sponsor -approved method. At this illness visit, the NP or nasal swab samples will be collected to 
evaluate for the presence of SARS -CoV -2 infection. Nasal  swab samples will also be tested for the presence of other respi[INVESTIGATOR_13531]. If due to

Note: In accordance with FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during COVID -19 Public Health Emergency ( DHHS  2020 ), 
investigators may convert study site visits to home visits or telemedicine visits with the approval of the Sponsor.  
Note: All scheduled study visits should be completed within the respective visit windows. If the participant is not able to attend a study site visit due to the 
COVID -19 pandemic (self -quarantine or disruption of study site activities following business continuity plans and/or local government mandates for “stay at 
home” or “shelter in place”), a safety telephone call to the participant should be made in place of the study site visit. The  safety telep hone call should 
encompass all scheduled visit assessments that can be completed remotely, such as assessment for AEs and concomitant medicati ons (eg, as defined in 
scheduled safety telephone calls). Home visits will be permitted for all nondosing visits, except for Screening, if a participant cannot visit the study site due to

• Consensus ethical principles derived from international guidelines including the 
Declaration  of Helsinki and Council for International Organizations of Medical 
Sciences International Ethical Guidelines.  
• Applicable ICH GCP Guidelines.  
• Applicable laws and regulatory requirements.  
• The protocol, protocol amendments, ICF, IB, and other relevant documents (eg, 
advertisements) must be submitted to an IRB by [CONTACT_365153].  
• Any amendments to the protocol will require IRB approval before implementation of 
changes made to the study d esign, except for changes necessary to eliminate an 
immediate hazard to study participants.  
• The investigator will be responsible for the following:  
− Providing written summaries of the status of the study to the IRB annually or 
more frequently in accordance with the requirements, policies, and procedures 
established by [CONTACT_1201]  
− Notifying the IRB of SAEs or other significant safety findings as required by [CONTACT_27491]  
− Providing oversight of the conduct of the study at the site and adherence to 
requirements of  21 CFR, ICH guidelines, the IRB, European regulation 536/2014 
for clinical studies (if applicable), and all other applicable local regulations.  
10.2.2.  Study Monitoring   
Before an invest igational site can enter a participant into the study, a representative of the 
Sponsor or its representatives will visit the investigational study site to do the following:  
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities  
• Discuss with the investigator(s) and other  personnel their responsibilities with regard 
to protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of the Sponsor or its representatives. 
This will be documented in a clinical study agreement between the Sponsor, the 
designated CRO, and the investigator.  
Accord ing to ICH GCP guidelines, the Sponsor of the study is responsible for ensuring the 
proper conduct of the study with regard to protocol adherence and validity of data recorded on 
the eCRFs. The study monitor’s duties are to aid the investigator and the Spo nsor in the 
maintenance of complete, accurate, legible, well -organized, and easily retrievable data. The 
study monitor will advise the investigator of the regulatory necessity for study -related 
monitoring, audits, IRB  review, and inspection by [CONTACT_856889], Inc.  
mRNA -1273 -P203 Protocol Amendment 7 mRNA -1273  
Confidential  Page 195 data/documents. In addition, the study monitor will explain to and interpret for the investigator 
all regulations applicable to the clinical evaluation of an IP as documented in ICH guidelines.  
It is the study monitor’s responsibi lity to inspect the eCRFs and source documentation 
throughout the study to protect the rights of the participants; to verify adherence to the protocol; 
to verify completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data; and to confirm adherence of study 
conduct  to any local regulations. Details will be outlined in the Clinical Monitoring Plan. During 
the study, a monitor from the Sponsor or a representative will have regular contacts with the 
investigational site, for the following:  
• Provide information and suppo rt to the investigator(s).  
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable.  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that the data are 
being accurately recorded in the eCRFs, and that IP accountability checks are being 
performed.  
• Perfor m source data verification. This includes a comparison of the data in the eCRFs 
with the participant’s medical records at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7117], and other records 
relevant to the study. This will require direct access to all original records for each 
participant (eg, clinical charts or electronic medical record system).  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent . 
• Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on eCRFs and confirm any 
SAEs have been forwarded to the SAE Hotline, and  those SAEs that met criteria for 
reporting have been forwarded to the IRB.  
The monitor will be available between visits if the investigator(s) or other staff needs 
information or advice.  
10.2.3.  Audits and Inspections   
The Sponsor, their designee(s), the IRB, or regulatory authorities will be allowed to conduct 
study site visits to the investigational facilities for the purpose of monitoring or inspecting any 
aspect of the study. The inve stigator agrees to allow the Sponsor, their designee(s), the IRB, or 
regulatory authorities to inspect the IP storage area, IP stocks, IP records, participant charts and 
study source documents, and other records relative to study conduct.  
Authorized representatives of the Sponsor, a regulatory authority, and any IRB may visit the 
study site to perform audits or inspections, including source data verification. The purpose of a 
Sponsor audit or inspection is to systematically and independently examine a ll study -related 
activities and documents to determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were 
recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, ICH E6(R2) GCP, and any 
applicable regulatory requirements. The investigato r should contact [CONTACT_340147] a regulatory agency about an inspection.  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_7118]. Initial IRB approval,

overriding safety rea sons warrant immediate action, in which case the IRB(s) will be promptly 
notified.  
Any modifications to the protocol or the ICF, which may impact the conduct of the study, 
potential benefit of the study, or may affect participant safety, including changes of study 
objectives, study design, participant population, sample sizes, study procedures, or significant 
administrative aspects will require a formal amendment to the protocol. Such an amendment will 
be released by [CONTACT_1034], agreed by [CONTACT_093]( s), and approved by [CONTACT_56335](s) 
prior to implementation. A signed and dated statement that the protocol, any subsequent relevant 
amended documents, and the ICF have been approved by [CONTACT_33149](s) must  be provided to 
the Sponsor before the study i s initiated.  
Administrative changes of the protocol are minor corrections and/or clarifications that have no 
effect on the way the study is to be conducted. These administrative changes will be released by 
[CONTACT_1034], agreed by [CONTACT_473], and noti fied to the IRB(s).  
10.2.8.  Protocol Deviations   
The noncompliance may be either on the part of the participant, the investigator, or the study site 
staff. As a result of protocol deviati ons, corrective actions are to be developed by [CONTACT_512233].  
After a participant proceeds to the Participant Decision Visit (Part 1A) of the study, participants 
who received mRNA -1273 will continue to follow the open -label Part 1 A SoA ( Table  10). 
Participants who received placebo will transition to open -label Part 1B of the study and will 
follow the Part 1B SoA ( Table  12). Participants who transitioned to Part 1C -1, at least [ADDRESS_1193386] dose, will follow the Part 1C -1 SoA ( Table  13). Eligible participants that completed 
their primary COVID -19 vaccination series under EUA and choose to receive a BD will follow 
Part 1C -2 SoA ( Table  14). Participants enrolled in Part 2 will follow Part 2 SoA (Table  15 and

retention policy is less than 2 years. No records may be destroyed during the 
retention period without the writt en approval of the Sponsor. No records may be 
transferred to another location or party without written notification to the Sponsor.  
Quality assurance includes all the planned and systematic actions that are established to ensure 
that the clinical study is performed and the data are generated, documented (recorded), and 
reported according to ICH GCP and local/regional regulatory standards.  
A QA representative from the Sponsor or a qualified designee , who is independent of and 
separated from routine monitorin g, may periodically arrange inspections/audits of the clinical 
study by [CONTACT_46389]. These inspections may include 
on-site inspections/audits and source data checks. Direct access to source documents is required 
for the purpose of these periodic inspections/audits.  
10.2.13.  Data Collection and Management   
This study will be conducted in compliance with ICH CGP guidelines. This study will also be 
conduc ted in accordance with the most recent version of the Declaration of Helsinki.  
This study will use electronic data collection to collect data directly from the study site using 
eCRFs. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all sections of each e CRF are completed 
promptly and correctly and that entries can be verified against any source data.  
Study monitors will perform source document verification to identify inconsistencies between 
the eCRFs and source documents. Discrepancies will be resolved i n accordance with the 
principles of GCP. Detailed study monitoring procedures are provided in the Clinical Monitoring 
Plan.  
Adverse events will be coded with MedDRA. Concomitant medications will be coded using 
WHO  - Drug Dictionary.  
10.2.14.  Source Documents   
Source documents are original documents or certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and include, but are not limited to, 
eDiaries, medical and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], screening logs, informed consent/assent forms,  telephone 
contact [CONTACT_29543], and worksheets. Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the 
participant and substantiate the integrity of the data collected. Source documents are filed at the 
investigator’s study site.  
Data reported on the CRF or e ntered in the eCRF that are transcribed from source documents 
must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. The 
ModernaTX, Inc.  
mRNA -[ADDRESS_1193390] be available.  
The Sponsor or its designee requires that the investigator prepare and maintain adequate and 
accurate records for each participant treated with the IP. Source documents such as any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],

Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)  
Females of childbearing potential are those who are considered fertile following menarche and 
until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently sterile (see below). If fertility is unclear (eg, 
amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cycle ca nnot be confirmed before first 
dose of study treatment, additional evaluation should be considered.  
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP:  
1. Premenarchal  
2. Premenopausal,  surgically sterile female with 1 of the following:  
• Documented comple te hysterectomy  
• Documented surgical sterilization  
For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the above, 
(eg, Mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), investigator discretion should be applied in 
determining study entry.  
Note: Documentation can come from the study site personnel’s review of the participant’s 
medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
Contraception Guidance:  
A highly  effective method of birth control is defined as one which results in a low failure rate 
(eg, less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly, such as implants, injectables, 
combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices, sexual abstinence or vasectomized 
partner. For participants using a hormonal contraceptive method, information regarding the 
product under evaluation and its potential effect on the contraceptive should be addressed.  
Adequate female contraception is defined as consistent and correct use of an FDA -approved 
contraceptive m ethod in accordance with the product label. For example:  
• Barrier method (such as condoms, diaphragm, or cervical cap) used in conjunction 
with spermicide  
• Intrauterine device  
• Prescription hormonal contraceptive taken or administered via oral (pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]), transde rmal 
(patch), subdermal, or IM route  
• Sterilization of a female participant’s monogamous male partner prior to entry into 
the study  
Note that periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) 
and withdrawal are not acceptab le methods of contraception.

Main Rationale for the Amendment:  
To provide a 50 μg BD of mRNA -1273 to participants. This change is prompted by [CONTACT_856897] 2 s tudy, mRNA -1273 -P201 (Study P201). Adult 
participants in Study mRNA -[ADDRESS_1193417] levels and met the noninferiority 
criteria stipulated in the US A FDA  Guidance on EUA  for Vaccines to Prevent COVID -19. 
Additionally, no new safety signals emerged u pon administration of the BD in Study P201. 
Based on cumulative evidence, the benefit -risk profile of a BD of mRNA -1273 is favorable, 
particularly in light of increasing breakthrough disease with the emergence of the Delta variant.

Amendment 2, 27 Jul 2021  
Main Rationale for the Amendment:  
The main rationale for this amendment is to increase awareness of possible cases and to add a 
case definition for myocarditis and pericarditis as well as guidance for rep orting and assessing 
suspected cases for this study, given the recent reports in the E UA experience of cases with a 
temporal association between COVID -19 mRNA vaccine administration and signs and 
symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis.

Confidential  Page 220 Amendment 1, 23 Mar 2021  
Main Rationale for the Amendment:  
The primary rationales for this amendment are as follows:  
• To update the primary endpoints and null hypotheses (or success criteria) for establishing 
immunobridging and assumptions for the sample size calculations, as recommended by 
[CONTACT_21652].  
•  Following the authorization of a COVID -19 vaccine under an EUA, this study 
amendment is designed to transition to Part B, the Open -Label Observational Phase. 
Transitioning the study to Part B, the Open -label Observational Phase permits all ongoing 
study part icipants (a) to be informed of the availability and eligibility criteria of any 
COVID -19 vaccine made available under an EUA and (b) for EUA -eligible study 
participants, the opportunity to schedule a study visit to know their original group 
assignment (pla cebo versus mRNA -1273).  
• Part B, the Open -label Observational Phase also provides the opportunity for study 
participants who previously received placebo to request to receive 2 doses of the 
mRNA -1273 vaccine.  
The Summary of Changes table provided here descr ibes the major changes made in Protocol 
Amendment 1 relative to the original protocol, including the sections modified and the 
corresponding rationales. The synopsis of Protocol Amendment 1 has been modified to

Protocol Synopsis – Objectives and 
Section 2 (Objectives and 
Endpoints)  The primary endpoints were 
redefined. Secondary and 
exploratory endpoints were 
refined. An additional secondary 
objective and corresponding 
endpoint were added. A new 
exploratory objective and endpoint 
were added.  If an accepted threshold of 
protection is  not available, using 
coprimary endpoints based on nAb 
geometric mean and SRR  (added) in 
the noninferiority test was 
recommended by [CONTACT_21652], 
as it is considered standard in 
immunobridging. A secondary 
objective/endpoint to evaluate 
asymptomatic SARS -CoV -2 
infection was added to be separate 
from the objective/endpoint of 
SARS -CoV -2 infection in 
participants with SARS -CoV -2 
negative at baseline. An exploratory 
objective/endpoint was added to 
evaluate asymptomatic SARS -CoV -
2 infection in participant s 
seropositive at baseline.

Title of Study:  Phase 1/2, Open -Label, Single -Arm, Safety  and Efficacy  Dose -Finding,  Systemic Exposure, and 
Device Technical Effects of PRV111 (Cisplatin Transmucosal System) in Subjects with Oral Squamous Cell 
Carcinoma  
Phase of Development:  Phase 1/2  
Objectives:   
Primary Objectives  
• Determine a safe and efficacious dose of PRV111 (Cisplatin Transmucosal System) (cisplatin drug -loaded 
patch + permeation enhancer [PE]) under the conditions of the trial.  
Secondary Objectives  
• Evaluate tumor response   
• Assess the safety and tolerability  of the treatment  
• Evaluate systemic , tumor and lymph node (if a vailable) platinum levels following administration  
• Evaluate device technical success including the residual cisplatin level in the patch after the applicatio n 
period  
Methodology: This is a Phase 1/2, open -label, prospective, single -arm study of the safety  and efficacy dose -
finding , systemic exposure, and device technical success  of PRV111 (Cisplatin Transmucosal System) (cisplatin 
drug-loaded patch+PE) in sub jects with oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) amenable to surgery.  
 
Study Design:  This is a 2-stage adaptive study. For Stage 1, u p to [ADDRESS_343389] stage of the  study  to determine a saf e and efficacious dose . For Stage 2 , the target 
goal is 11 evaluable subjects for the efficacy analysis of the final dose. If the dose remains the same as Stage 1, 
Stage 2 will target 6 additional evaluable subjects but up to 21 subjects will be recr uited if the dose is changed 
between Stage 1 and 2.   
For the purpose of dose selection, tolerable dose is defined as a dose where fewer than 33% of subjects being 
evaluated within the safety population present with dose-limiting toxicities ( DLTs ). Effectiv e dose is determined 
based on the evaluable populatio n as described in the Statistical Methods  section.  
The 2 stages of the study are described below :   
 
Stage 1:  Up to [ADDRESS_343390] patch application (see Pharmacy Manual for details) . Starting approximately 5 
minutes after application of the PE, 1 or 2 patches (depending on tumor size) will be applied. A total of 3 
treatment applications of patches will o ccur. These successive applications will span approximately 35 
minutes. The 3 applications provi de a total of 6 mg of cisplatin per visit (12 mg if 2 patches are applied at the 
same time). The 4 treatment visits will be separated by 2 to 6 days (at least 4 8 hours  apart ).  
The following decisions  will be made  based on safety and efficacy of the dose : 
Dosing Rules for Stage 1 : 
1) If fewer  than 2 subjects experience DLT s, then the following scheme will be considered for stage 2 
dosing: 
a. If fewer than or equal to  [ADDRESS_343391] a response  (Tumor volume change from 
baseline (CFB) expressed as  percent change from baseline (PCFB)  complete response [ CR], strong 
response [SR]  or partial response  [PR]) the dose will be escalated  from [ADDRESS_343392] -001 Amendment 5

Name [CONTACT_3261]:  Cisplatin  
b. If [ADDRESS_343393] a response  (as tumor volume PCFB  complete response [CR] , 
strong response [SR]  or partial response [PR]) , the dose will remain the same for Stage 2 (3 
applications  per treatment visit).  
2) If 2 or more  subjects experience DLT s at any time during Stage 1, the following scheme will be 
considered for dose de -escalation  in Stage 2 : 
a. If there are 5 evaluable subjects in Stage 1:  
- If out of [ADDRESS_343394] a response  (as tumor volume PCFB  complete 
response [CR] , strong response [SR]  or partial respons e [PR] ), the dose will be de -escalated to [ADDRESS_343395] a response  (as tumor volume PCFB  complete 
response [CR] , strong response [SR]  or partial response [PR]) , the dose will be cons idered 
ineffective  and the study will be stopped . 
b. If Stage 1 dosing was stopped prior to having 5 evaluable subjects, the dose will be de -escalated from 3 
applications to 2 applications per treatment visit . 
Stage 1 Dose Determination Scheme : 
 
 
Stage 2:  In case of dose escalation or de -escalation, Stage 2 will be conducted in 2 parts: Stage 2a and Sta ge 
2b. 
Subjects will receive 2, 3, or 5  treatment applications at each of the 4 planned treatment visits, depending on 
the results of Stage  1.  
  
 
Stage 2a:  This stage will include 5 subjects (Stage 2a flowcharts). In this stage, only safety out comes will be 
considered for determining the dosing regimen for the set of subjects to be enrolled in Stage 2b. All subjects 
enrolled in this stage will be monitored for possible DLTs.

1) If fewer  than [ADDRESS_343396] s required in Stage 2b at the same dose.  
2) If 2 subjects experience  DLTs in Stage 2a, dosing w ill be re -considered. It may be stopped or, when 
possible, decreased for the remaining subjects enrolled in Stage 2b: 
a. If “St age 2a - Escalated Dose”, the original dose will be used for up to 10 additional evaluable 
subjects enrolled for Stage 2b.  
b. If “Stage 2a - De-escalated Dose”, the study will stop, as no safe dose could be determined .

 4 INTRODUCTION  
4.1 Background of Di sease  
Squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the head and neck include tumors that occur in the oral 
cavity (lips, buccal mucosa, anterior tongue, floor of the mouth, hard palate, upper gingiva, lower 
gingiva, buccal mucosa  and retromolar trigone) ( Brockstein, 2016 ). Most lip and oral cavity 
cancers originate in squamous cells, the thin flat cells that line the lips and oral cavity. Risk 
factors for oral cancer include chronic heavy use of alcohol and tobacco, long periods of 
exposure to natural or artificial su nlight , and exposure to human papi[INVESTIGATOR_28597]  (HPV) . Statistics 
also show that males and those of low socioeconomic background are at a higher risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_281780] ( Brockstein, 2016 ; da Silva, 2012 ).  
In 2017, an estimated 50,000  new cases of oral and pharynx cancer will be reported in the United 
States ( US); approximately 11.1 adults per 100,000 will develop oral and pharynx cancer per 
year ( National Cancer Institute, 2016 ). The median age of diagnosis is 62 years. The inci dence 
of oral cancer increases with age ( National Cancer Institute, 2016 ; National Institute of Dental 
and Craniofacial Research, 2016 ).  
The 5 -year survival rate for oral cancer is approximately 60%; diagnosis at an early stage 
significantly increases the  5-year survival rate (83% for Stage  I versus 10% –22% for Stage IV) 
(da Silva, 2012 ; National Cancer Institute, 2016 ; National Institute of Dental and 
Craniofacial Research, 2014 ). Approximately 30% of subjects have early ( Stage I or II) 
localized disease , with most subjects diagnosed with advanced disease ( Brockstein, 2016 ; da 
Silva, 2012 ; National Cancer Institute, 2016 ).  
Oral cancer has a high rate of recurrence (18% –76% for subjects who undergo standard 
treatment), and is considered the major c ause of  poor survival rates. Recurrence can vary by 
[CONTACT_281794], with a median time to recurrence of 9. 5 months (range 2 –79 months) for tongue, 
8 months (range 2 –120 months) for buccal tumor, and 5 –8 months for lip tumors ( da Silva, 
2012; Gurudutt, 2011 ; Kelne r, 2014 ). The median time to recurrence across all oral cancer sites 
is 7.[ADDRESS_343438] recurrences (86%) occurring within 24 months ( da Silva, 2012 ). 
Approximately 1/3 of subjects treated with surgery and adjuvant therapy will experience loca l or 
regional recurrence and/or distant metastasis. Local and regional recurrences account for up to 
90% of treatment failures post -surgery and radiotherapy ( da Silva, 2012 ). An estimated 9,700 
deaths will occur due to oral and pharynx cancer in the US in 2017 ( National Cancer Institute, 
2016 ).  
The treatment and management of oral cancer is dependent upon the stage of disease. Standard 
treatment for localized early disease is surgery with or without radiation ( Brockstein, 2016 ). For 
subjects with pathologi cally l oco-regionally advanced disease ( Stage III/IV), or for those treated 
with surgery for early stage disease identified to have close or positive margins, or positive 
lymph nodes, adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy is 
recommended  (Brockstein, 2016 ). Typi[INVESTIGATOR_281781] -regionally advanced 
disease will include neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy, primary surgery followed by 
[CONTACT_281795], or chemotherapy or chemoradiotherap y witho ut

 surgery ( Brockstein, 2016;  da Silva, 2012; Gregoire, 2010; Marta, 2015;  Seiwert, 2007 ). 
Salvage surgery, adjuvant radiation, re -irradiation, and/or palliative chemotherapy is 
recommended for subjects with locally recurrent disease ( Milano, 2015 ). For su bjects with 
locally recurrent metastatic disease, palliative chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and/or supportive 
care are recommended ( Brockstein, 2016 ). The most common chemotherapy drugs for advanced 
oral cancer includes cisplatin, methotrexate, carbop latin, 5-fluorouracil, paclitaxel, and 
docetaxel, which when administered alone or in combination have been shown to provide 
clinical benefit with demonstrated improvement in overall survival ( da Silva, 2012;  Gregoire, 
2010;  Vermorken, 2010 ).  
4.2 Privo’s PRV111 Patc h 
PRV111 (Cisplatin Transmucosal System) is a thin, 2 -layer, matrix -type, non -sterile 
transmucosal patch consisting of a  matrix layer embedded with cisplatin loaded  
particles (CLPs) and a non -woven fabric adhesive unidi rectional backing, which is applied to the 
matrix layer during manufacturing ( Figure 1). The patch is self -adhesive.  
  
Figure 1. PRV111 (Cisplatin Transmucosal System)  
In addition to the PRV111 drug product,  a separately packaged Permeation Enhan cer (PE) 
Powder for Reconstitution (a vial   to be reconstituted at the clinical site 
with 1 mL of Water for Injection) is used in conjunction with the PRV111 drug product. The 
reconstituted PE Solution is intended to improve the abso rption of the cisplatin active ingredient  
and will be applied pre and post patch application (see Pharmacy Manual for details) .  
4.[ADDRESS_343439]  
Privo’s PRV111 is intended as a local induction chemoth erapy, to improve the local control of 
the disease prior to surgery by [CONTACT_281796]. Local cisplatin delivery may result in 
larger and more effective doses of cisplatin delivered to the tum or while significantly reducing or 
eliminating the syst emic toxicities and side effects traditionally associated with intravenous ( IV) 
cisplatin chemotherapy. If proven safe and effective for the treatment of SCC of the oral cavity, 
PRV111, in association with the standard care, may decrease the risk of local tumor recurrence.

Page 25 of 59 
 Cisplatin (cis -diamminedichloroplatinum) has been approved in the US for [ADDRESS_343440] of care 
chemot herapy for the treatment of oral cancer, alone and in c ombination with other 
chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ( da Silva, 2012 ; Vermorken, 2007 ; Vermorken, 2010 ). However, systemic 
treatment with cisplatin can lead to dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) and significant side effe cts, 
including renal toxicity, ototoxicity, and myelosu ppression, which can limit the extent and 
duration of treatment ( WG Critical Care, 2015 ). These side effects of IV cisplatin 
administration can be dose -limiting, reducing the dosage and length of cispl atin treatment for 
subjects. Treatment with cisplatin w hich is targeted to the tumor site and not administered 
systemically may reduce the dose -limiting systemic toxicities that are observed with IV cisplatin 
administration.  
The antineoplastic activity of  cisplatin can be primarily attributed to its ability t o bind and 
modify nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, forming multiple intrastrand and interstrand DNA 
adducts, which leads to the activation of the p53 apoptotic pathway and subsequently cell death 
(Galluz zi, 2014; Johnstone, 2015 ). Cisplatin has also been lin ked to inducing chemokine and T -
cell infiltration of tumor sites, thereby [CONTACT_281797] ( Hong, 2011 ). 
4.4 Rationale for Dose Selection  
The maximum total planned PRV111 cisplatin dose if dose escal ation proceeds as planned in 
Stage 2 (10 mg per treatme nt visit for 5 single patch applications, and 20 mg per treatment visit 
for 5 double patch applications) is approximately 9 to 18 times lower than the recommended 
dose of IV cisplatin (180 mg for an 80  kg person) ( WG Critical Care, 2015 ). 
Version [ADDRESS_343441]  will be used for this clinical trial since it has shown good safety 
and efficacy in 4 nonclinical studies . This version has the optimal dose per patch as 2 mg 
(0.5 mg/cm2) that balances the quality, drug release and uniformity of the patch.  
5 TRIAL OBJECTIVES  
5.1 Primary Objective  
• Determine a safe and efficacious dose of PRV111 (Cisplatin Transmucosal System) 
(cisplatin drug -loaded patch + PE) under the conditions of the trial.  
5.2 Secondary Objectives  
• Evaluate tumor response   
• Assess the safety and tol erability  of the treatment  
• Evaluate systemic , tumor , and lymph nodes (if available) platinum levels follow ing 
administration  
• Evaluate device technical success including the residual cisplatin level in the patch after 
the application period  
6 INVESTIGATIONAL  PLAN  
6.1 Overall Trial Design and Plan: Description  
Privo Technologies, Inc.  Protocol CLN -001 Amendment 5  
 
Confidential Property of Privo Technologies, Inc.  
Page 26 of 59 
 Study Design:  This is a [ADDRESS_343442] stage of the study to determine a safe and 
efficacious do se. For Stage 2, the target goal is 11 evaluable subjects for the efficacy analysis of 
the final dose. If the dose remains the same as Stage 1, Stage 2 will target 6 additional evaluable 
subje cts but up to 21 subjects will be recruited if the dose is  changed between Stage 1 and 2.  
For the purpose of dose selection, tolerable dose is defined as a dose where fewer than 33% of 
subjects being evaluated within the safety population present with DLT s. Effective dose is 
determined based on the evaluable pop ulation as described in the Section  10.2.  
The 2 stages of the study are described below:   
Stage 1:  Up to [ADDRESS_343443] patch application (see Pharmacy Manual for details)  (One ml vial of PE per visit, see 
Pharmacy Manual ). Starting approximately 5 minutes after application of the PE, 1 or 2 
patches (depending on tumor size) will be applied. A total of 3 treatment applications of 
patches will occur. These successive applications will span approximately 35  minutes. Th e 3 
applications provide a total of 6 mg of cisplatin per visit (12 mg if 2  patches are applied at 
the same time). The 4  treatment vis its will be separated by 2 to 6 days (at least 48 hours  
apart ).  
The following decisions will be made based on safety and efficacy of the dose:  
Dosing Rules for Stage 1:  
1) If fewer than 2 subjects experience DLTs, then the following scheme will  be considered 
for Stage 2 dosing : 
a. If fewer than or equal to [ADDRESS_343444] a response  (as tumor volume 
PCFB  complete response [CR] , strong response [SR]  or partial response [PR]) ) the 
dose will be escalated from [ADDRESS_343445] a response  (as tumor volume PCFB  complete 
response [CR] , stro ng response [SR]  or partial response [PR]) ), the dose will remain 
the same for Stage 2 (3 applications per treatment vis it). 
2) If 2 or more  subjects experience DLTs at any time during Stage 1, the following scheme 
will be considered for dose de -escalation in  Stage 2:  
a. If there are 5 evaluable subjects in Stage 1:  
- If out of [ADDRESS_343446] a re sponse  (as tumor 
volume PCFB  complete response [CR] , strong response [SR]  or partial response 
[PR]) ), the dose will be de -escalated to [ADDRESS_343447] a response  (as tumor volume 
PCFB  complete response [CR] , strong response [SR]  or partial response [PR]) ), 
the dose will be considered intolerable and the study will be s topped.  
b. If Stage [ADDRESS_343448] -001 Amendment 5

Figure 2. Stage 1 dose determination scheme  
 
Stage 2:  In case  of dose escalation or de -escalation, Stage 2 will be conducted in 2 parts: 
Stage 2a and Stage 2b.  
Subjects will re ceive 2, 3, or 5  treatment applications at each of the 4 planned treatment 
visits, depending on the results of Stage  1. Up to 21 additional s ubjects will be enrolled in 
Stage 2 if necessary, for the purpose of 11 total evaluable subjects at the final dose for the 
efficacy analysis.  
Stage 2a:  
This stage will include 5 subjects (Stage 2a flowcharts). In this stage, only safety outcomes 
will be considered for determining the dosing regimen for the set of subjects t o be enrolled in 
Stage 2b. All subjects enrolled in this stage will be monitored for possible DLTs.     
1) If fewer than 2 subjects with DLTs in Stage 2a, enrollment will continue for t he 
remaining number of subjects required in Stage 2b at the same dose.  
2) If 2 subjects experience DLTs in Stage 2a, dosing will be re -considered. It may be 
stopped or, when possible, decreased for the remaining subjects enrolled in Stage 2b:  
a. If “Stage 2a - Escalated Dose”, the original dose will be used on the remaining 
patients .

9.3.5 Electrocardiograms  
Electrocardiog rams ( ECGs ) will be evaluated for clinically relevant changes from Baseline.  
9.3.6 Adverse Event Definitions/Reporting Requirements  
An AE (also known as an “adverse experience”) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence 
assoc iated with the use of a drug in h umans, whether or not considered drug related ( US Code of 
Federal Regulations [ CFR ] 312.32) .  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease tempor ally associated with the use of t he drug, without any 
judgment about causality.  
All clinical AEs noted during the study will be reported on the appropriate AE page of the CRF.  
AEs that are serious, unexpected, and at least possibly related to study partic ipation will be 
reported to the I RB and to the US FDA within the timelines described below. All other AEs, 
such as those that are expected, or definitely not related to the study participation, are to be 
reported per the  IRB’s policy  and to FDA as part of regular data submission at the ti me of annual  
Investigational New Drug report .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Expected Events  
Expected events are those that have been previously identified as resulting from administration 
of the study drug . An AE is considered unexpected, for expedited  reporting purposes only, when 
either the type of event or the severity of the event is not listed in the current Investigator’s 
Brochure  (IB). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A suspected adverse reaction is a subset of all AEs for which there is a reasonable possibility (ie, 
evidence to sugge st a causal relationship between the drug and the AE) that the drug caused the 
event. Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than 
adverse reaction .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Reaction  
An adverse reaction is a subset of all suspected adverse reactions, and is defined as any AE 
caused by a drug .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Device Effects  
Privo Technologies, Inc.  Protocol CLN -[ADDRESS_343479], which by [CONTACT_5942], 
incidence, severity or outcome has not been identified in available information on the dev ice.  
Additional device issues, malfunctions or misuse wil l be documented in the electronic CRF .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious Adverse Event Definitions / Reporting Requirements  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Serious Adverse Event or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either the 
Investiga tor or Sponsor , it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death . This includes any death that occurs while the subject  is on stu dy and/or within 
[ADDRESS_343480] dose of study drug. An aut opsy will be requested, and if performed, 
results will be submitted to the Sponsor .  
• A life -threatening AE. An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered life -threatening 
if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor , its occurrence places the subject  at 
immediate risk of death . It does not include a reaction that had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death.  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] . In the absence of an 
AE, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_281784] a  serious 
AE ( SAE ) in the following situations:  
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_112041] a procedure required 
by [CONTACT_89191].  
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318] i s part of routine procedure 
followed by [CONTACT_91294].  
o Hosp italization for survey visits or annual physicals.  
o For a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_281785] (and documented) before the start of the study for a pre -
existing condition which has not worsened.  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ab ility to conduct 
normal life functions.  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_281786], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the subject  and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition . Examples include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Privo Technologies, Inc.  Protocol CLN -001 Amendment 5

Page 43 of 59 
 [IP_ADDRESS].2  Pregnancy  
For safety reporting purposes, any pregnancy occurring during the study wi ll be considered an 
“important medical event” ( Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 ). If a study subject  becomes pregnant while 
participating in the study, the study drug will be discontinued immediately and the pregnancy 
will be reported to the Sponsor. The Investigator wil l then report  follow -up information to the 
Sponsor regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal outcome, 
regardless of the fact that the subject  has discontinued the study. Once the newborn is determined 
to be healthy, as defined  by [CONTACT_281804] d upon by [CONTACT_89951], additional follow -
up will no longer be required.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Serious Unexpected and Suspected Adverse Reaction  
An unexpected AE (or serious and unexpected suspected adverse reaction  [S[LOCATION_003]R] ) is any AE 
or suspected adverse reacti on that is not listed in the IB or is not listed at the specificity or 
severity that has been observed, if an IB is not required/available, is not consistent with the risk 
information described in the general investigational plan. T his also refers to AEs o r suspected 
adverse reactions mentioned in the IB as occurring with a  class of drugs or as anticipated from 
the pharmacological properties of the drug but  are not specifically mentioned as occurring with 
the study drug. A S[LOCATION_003]R  requires mandatory expedited  reporting to the applicable regulatory 
authority(ies)  (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). The Sponsor will forward the formal notification describing the 
S[LOCATION_003]R to Investigators. Each Investigator must then notify his/her IRB of  the S[LOCATION_003]R, in 
accordance with the IRB’s policy.  
The Sponsor should be notified within 24 hours of the Investigator becoming aware of a S[LOCATION_003]R 
and the event documented on the CRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Recording Adverse Events  
All AEs (including SAEs) within  the 5 pre -surgery vi sits are to be accurately recorded on the 
AE/SAE  page(s) of the CRF. In addition, any SAEs within 30 day s of visit 5 will need to be 
recorded. The Investiga tor will carefully evaluate each AE to determine:  
• Duration (start and end dates)  
• Severity (grade)  
• Seriousness  
• Relationship to study drug (Not Related , Possible, Definite)  
• Action taken (none, study drug modification, medical intervention)  
• Outcome (resolved without sequelae, resolved with sequelae, ongoing)  
 
The Investigator will evaluate the recorded  AEs and SAEs with regard to maximum intensity and 
relationship to study drug. Maximum intensity should be assigned using one of the severity 
grades as outlined in the NCI CTCAE v4.0. If the AE is not specifically listed in CTCAE v4.0, 
the following grades will  be used:  
• Grade 1: mild  
• Grade 2: moderate  
Privo Technologies, Inc.  Protocol CLN -001 Amendment 5  
 
Confidential Property of Privo Technologies, Inc.  
Page 44 of 59 
 • Grade 3: severe  
• Grade 4: life -threatening or disabling  
• Grade 5: death  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Determining Relationship of Adverse Events t o Study Drug  
The Investigator must attempt to determine if an AE or SAE is related to the use of th e study 
drug. This relationship should be described as follows:  
Possible  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
study d rug and the event follows a known response pattern to the study drug 
BUT the event could have been p roduced by [CONTACT_281805], based on the pathophysiology of the condition and the pharmacology of 
the study drug, would be unlikely to be related to the use of the study drug OR 
the event could be the effect of a concomitant therapy . 
Definite  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
study drug, the event follows a known response pattern to the study drug and 
based on the known pharmacology of the study drug, the event is clearly related 
to the effec t of the study drug.  
Not R elated  Based on the evidence available, causality is not possible . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting Deaths and Other Serious Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_343481] be promptly reported to the Sponsor ( within 24 ho urs (of a working day)  of the Investigator 
becoming aware of the event ) by [CONTACT_281806].  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_343482] for prompt reporting is essential in that the Sponsor is responsible 
for informing th e FDA and other regulatory authorities as well as all other participating 
Investigators of the event.  
Under FDA ruling (US CFR , Title 21 CFR P art 312.32) and the International Co uncil  on 
Harmonisation ( ICH) Guidelines for Clinical Safety Data Management D efinitions and 
Standards for Expedited Reporting, the Sponsor is required to submit written documentation, in 
the form of an IND Safety Report,  on the following:  
• S[LOCATION_003]Rs  
• Unexpected fatal or life -threatening suspected adverse reactions  
• Findings from other st udies that suggest a significant risk to humans exposed to drug  
Privo Technologies, Inc.  Protocol CLN -001 Amendment 5  
 
Confidential Property of Privo Technologies, Inc.  
Page 45 of 59 
 • Findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk to hum ans exposed 
to drug  
• Increased rate of occurrence of serious suspected adverse reactions from what is reported 
in the IB or the Protocol  
Written submission must be made by [CONTACT_281807]/other regulatory authorities (and 
by [CONTACT_95876] I RB) as soon as possible, and in no event later than 15 calendar days  
after the Sponsor determines that the inform ation qualifies for reporting. The Sponsor shall also 
inform all Investigators.  
In addition, the Sponsor is further required to report, by [CONTACT_281808]/other regulatory authorities the occurrence of an y 
unexpected fatal or life -threatening event associated with the use of the drug (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) no later 
than 7 calendar days  after notification of t he event, followed by a written report no later than 
15 calendar days  after the initial report receipt date. The Sponsor shall also inform all 
Investigators.  
The Sponsor will provide expedited reports of the following S[LOCATION_003]Rs to the Investigators for 
report ing to their IRB:  
• S[LOCATION_003]Rs that have arisen in the clinical trial that was assessed by [CONTACT_1201].  
• S[LOCATION_003]Rs that have ar isen in other clinical trials of the same Sponsor and with the same 
medicinal product, and that could have consequences for the safety of the subject s 
involved in the clinical trial that was assessed by [CONTACT_1201].  
Investigators are required to promptly repor t to the IRB all unanticipated problems involving risk 
to human subject s, including AEs that should be considered unanticipated problems (21 CF R 
312.53(c)(1)(vii), 312.66, and 21 CFR 56.108(b)(1)).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Initial Information Provided by [CONTACT_281809] (or designee) should 
an SAE report meet the criteria for completion of an I ND Safety Report. As much of the 
following information about the subject  and the event will be requested:  
• Subject  identification code, gende r, and age or date of birth  
• Underlying diagnosis and extent of disease  
• Lot number and expi[INVESTIGATOR_281787] (if available)  
• Dose, route, frequency, and dura tion of study drug administered  
• Date of last study drug administra tion 
• Description of event, inclu ding date of onset and duration  
• Date of death (if applicable)  
• Intervention(s) required  
• Concomitant therapy  (including regimens and indications)  
• Pertinent laboratory data/dia gnostic study (including dates)  
• Pertinent medical h istory  
• Study drug status ( dose interrupted, discontinued)

 • Did event abate after interruption of study drug administration (if applicable)?  
• Did event recur after study drug was reintroduced (if applicable)?  
• Severity of the AE  
• Relationsh ip of the AE to study  treatment  
• Outcome of the AE  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Follow -up Information  
Follow -up data concerning the SAE ( eg, diagnostic test reports, physician's summaries,  etc.) 
must also be submitted to the Sponsor as they become available  by [CONTACT_281810], and u ntil the event resolves or stabilizes.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious Adverse Event that are Unexpected and related Serious Adverse 
Reaction  Review that have a Potential Impact on Trial Conduct  
The Investigator will review each SAE report and evaluate further the relationship of  the SAE to 
study drug and to the subject ’s underlying disease.  
Based on the Investigator’s and Sponsor’s assessment of causality of the AE and discussions 
with the Medical Monitor, a decision will be made by [CONTACT_281811]. The primary consideration 
governing further action is whether new findings affect the  safety of other subject s participating 
in the clinical study. If the discovery of a new SAE related to study drug rai ses concern over the 
safety of its continued administration to subject s, the Sponsor will take immediate steps to notify 
FDA, other regula tory authorities, and all Investigators participating in clinical studies with the 
study drug.  
Further action required  may include any of the following:  
• Alteration of the existing research program by [CONTACT_281812]  
• Discontinua tion or suspensi on of the study  
• Alteration of the informed consent process by [CONTACT_281813]  
• Modification of previously identified expected suspected adverse reaction lists to include 
SAEs newly i dentified as study drug -related

 At the end of Stage 2, the following is a statistical analysis of the sample size as it pertains to 
efficacy:  
Power and Sample Size  
  
Based on Simon's 2-stage procedure, the null hypothesis that the true response rate is 0.[ADDRESS_343497] stage, 5 evaluable subjects will be accrued. If 
there are 2 or fewer responses in these 5 subjects, the dose will be es calated. Otherwise, the dose 
will remain the same or de -escalated based on safety data. Additional subjects will be accrued for 
a total of 11 evaluable subjects at the final dose. The null hypothesis will be rejected if 7 or more 
responses are observed  at the final dose. This design yields a type I error rate of 0. 018 and power 
of 96.44% when the true response rate is 0. 85. 
Null response rate: P 0 Alt. response rate: P 1 Alpha one -tailed  Power  n1 r1 N R 
 0.30 0.85 0.018 96.44% 5 2 11 6 
N is the total number of evaluable subjects at the final dose  
n1 is the number of evaluable subjects accrued during Stage 1  
r1, if r1 or fewer responses are observed during stage 1, escalate the dose if safety requirements are met  
R, if R or fewer resp onses are observed by [CONTACT_281818] 2 in N subjects, then an effective dose is not found  
10.3 Note: If the dose is not increased after Stage 1, the test will be performed using 
all evaluable subjects from Stage [ADDRESS_343498]  75% 
of the total dose required for that stage will be included in the Evaluable Population.  This 
population will be used for the  efficacy  analysis.  
10.[ADDRESS_343499] completion status, dose modification, and study terminations will be summarized for 
each of the study stages and for the study overall. Subjects with major protocol violations will be  
listed. Demographics will be summarized along with baseline characteristics such as medical 
history, and baseline physical examination , weight, VS, ECOG PS, and concomitant therapy .  
10.5.3  Primary Endpoints  
The primary endpoints for the study involve  determinat ion of a safe and efficacious dose of 
PRV111 (Cisplatin Transmucosal System) ( cisplatin drug -loaded patch + PE) under the 
conditions of the trial.  
Therefore, the primary endpoint is based on the incidence of DLTs  and tumor volume CFB . 
10.5.4  Secondary Endpoints  
Based on secondary objectives, the secondary endpoints are:  
• Evaluate tumor response   
o  
o   
• Assess short and long -term safety of the treatment  
o Loco -regional control: sub jects will be followed -up for disease recurrence and safety 
following surgery  
o Incidence of recurrence at 6 months  
• Total platinum  assessment  in blood, tumor and lymph nodes  (if available)  
• Technical success:  
o Successful adhesion of the patch to the target les ion 
o Successful delivery (including release and permeation) of the drug to the target 
lesion, without getting to surrounding oral surfaces  
o Successful peel of the used patch after 10 minutes without damaging the target lesion 
underneath  
o Adhesion of the back ing to the polymeric matrix embedded CLPs  
o Taste of the PE solution  
o Taste of the PRV111 patch  
o Residual cisplatin level in the patch after the application period  
10.5.5  Efficacy Data  
Efficacy outcomes include:  
• Response to treatment evaluated by [CONTACT_281819] (CFB ) 
•  
• Incidence of recurrence at 6 months

 10.5.6  Safety Data  
Safety observations and measurements including study drug exposure, AEs, laboratory data, 
physical examination fin dings, VS, weight, and concomitant therapy  will be summarized and 
presented in tables and listings.  
Laboratory parameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics and data listings. The 
incidence of clinically significant abnormalities will be summa rized. Physical examinations, VS, 
and weight will be summarized by [CONTACT_22247].  
AEs occurring after the start of treatment are TEAEs. The severity of the TEAEs will be graded 
according to the CTCAE criteria, ve rsion 4.0 3. The severity of oral mucositis will be graded 
according to the WHO grade ( Section  8.2).  
The number and percentages of subjects experiencing TEAEs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_281820] d term. Assessments of TEAEs will include characterization of the type, 
incidence, severity, seriousness, and relationship to treatment. Summary subject listings will be 
provided for su bjects with dose modification, SAEs, TEAEs resulting in study discontin uation, 
and deaths. The rates of local tolerability and oral mucositis will be reported.  
10.5.7  Pharmacokinetics Data  
 
10.5.8  Technical Data  
Technical success is defined as:  
• Successful adhesion of the patch to t he target lesion.  
• Successful delivery (including release and permeation) of the drug to the target lesion, 
without getting to surrounding oral surfaces.  
• Successful peel of  the used patch after 10 minutes without damaging the target lesion

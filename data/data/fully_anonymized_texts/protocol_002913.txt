Trial site(s) Multi -centre trial conducted in approximately  10countries
Clinical phase II
Trial rationale Currently  the onl y generally  approved medication for treatment of 
PTSD are the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI s) 
sertraline and paroxetine. These medications produce reduction in 
symptom severit y rather than symptom remission, do not treat all 
symptoms, and have a relatively  low usage in patients with PTSD. 
Currently  most national guidelines recommend psy chotherapy  as 
first line treatment for PTSD in adults and medications to be used as 
second line treatment. Thus there is a significant unmet medical 
need for more efficacious medications for first -line treatment of 
PTSD.
Trial objective(s) The main objective of this trial is to provide proof of concept (PoC) 
of orall y administered BI 1358894 125mg after eight weeks 
treatment in patients with PTSD compared to placebo.
Trial endpoints Primary  Endpoint: 
Change from baseline in Clinician- Administered PTSD Scale for 
DSM -5 (CAPS -5) total severit y score at Week 8
Secondary  Endpoints:
Response defined as ≥30% CAPS -5 reduction from baseline at 
Week 8
Response defined as ≥50% CAPS -5 reduction from baseline at 
Week 8
Change from baseline on the PTSD Checklist for DSM -[ADDRESS_96961]-

Duration of treatm ent 8 weeks
Statistical m ethods Restricted maximum likelihood (REML ) based approach using a 
mixed effects model with repeated measures (MMRM) will be 
utilized as the main estimator of the primary  estimand on the 
primary  endpoint. Intercurrent events will be handled as specified in 
Section 7. The MMRM model will include the fixed categorical 
effects of treatment at each visit, fixed categorical effect of the 
stratification factor of presence of significant childhood trauma (y es 
vs. no) according to investigator ´s judgement, assessed b y CTQ at 
screening visit , and the fixed continuous covariates of time since 
index event (in y ears) and baseline CAPS -[ADDRESS_96968] measurements.
Sensitivity  analy ses for the primary  estimand and anal yses based on 
supplementary  estimand(s) are planned to assess the robustness of 
the results from the primary  estima nd analy sis, for details please see 
Section 7.2.3.
An interim anal ysis is planned for internal planning of the PTSD 
indication with BI 1358894. PoC could be established and the trial 
may be stopped earl y if at the interim analy sis an impressive 
standardized effect size is observed. For more details, please refer to 
Section 7.2.8.

Ideally, the patients should attend all remaining visits and perform all study related procedures according to Flow Charts and section 6.2.2 .An early EoT (eEOT) Visit shall be conducted 
within [ADDRESS_96976] regularly scheduled visits after premature drug discontinu ation (if consistent with the planned visit 
schedule, the eEOT can replace the next regularly scheduled clinic visit). After this e arly EOT visit, patients should be followed up according to the regularly scheduled visit for both 
clinic and phone visits including Visit 10 and should be encouraged to complete the FUP Visit 28+2 days after the drug discontinuation date. All procedures s hould be completed, with the 
exception of trial drug procedures and . If a regular planned visit is completed prior to the initially planned Visit10 (early drug discontinuation date + 28+2 days), no 
additional FUP Visit may be needed. Howeve r, end of study participation (EOS) must be completed.
If the patient does not agree to return for all remaining scheduled visits, the patient should be encouraged to return at lea st for an early EoT (eEOT) Visit within [ADDRESS_96977] dose of 
trial me dication, for the regularly scheduled Visit 10 and FUP. If FUP visit (early drug discontinuation date + 28 +2 days) can be co mpleted prior to the date of the planned Visit 10, no 
additional FUP Visit may be needed. However, end of study participation (EOS) must be completed.
[ADDRESS_96978] be scheduled at minimum 8 days  prior to V2 to allow for 7 days of E cMA assessments before 
randomization . The randomization visit V2 should be planned shortly (preferably within the same week) after completion of the 7 day EcMA baseline assessment period.

1.[ADDRESS_97015]-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a serious debilitating disorder that may  occur in 
people who have experienced or witnessed a traumatic event such as a natural disaster, a 
serious accident, a terrorist act, war/combat, rape or who have been threatened with death, 
sexual violenc e or serious injury . The lifetime prevalence is estimated at nearly  4% globall y 
and over 8% in the [LOCATION_003][ R21-1545, R21 - 0924 ].Symptoms of PTSD include unwanted and 
intrusive thought and memories, avoida nce of trauma -related thoughts, feelings, and 
reminders, negative thoughts or feelings following the trauma, and increased arousal and 
reactivit y. 
Most treatment guidelines generall y recommend cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as 1st 
line treatment for PTSD in adults and pharmacotherapy  as 2nd line treatment [R21-1276 ].
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_88776], there are limited licensed pharmacological treatment options; 
only two medications are currentl y approved for the treatment of PTS D by [CONTACT_55257], 
EMA and PMDA, sertraline and paroxetine. However, pharmacotherap y is widely  
acknowledged to be ineffective for many  people with PTSD [R21-1829]. There is currentl y 
an urgent need to find novel effective pharmacologic treatments for PTSD [ R21-1828 ]
1.2 DRUG PROFILE
Transient Receptor Potential Cation (TRPC) channels 4 and 5 are involved in the regulation 
of neuronal excitabi lity. They  are highl y expressed in the amy gdala, frontal cortex, 
hippocampus, and h ypothalamus [R15-3888] which are the brain regions involved in 
modulation and processing of emotion and affect.
BI 1358894 is a TRPC4/5 inhibitor that is being developed for s ymptomatic treatment of 
Major Depressive Disorder and for the treatment of Borderline Personality  Disorder (BoPD) 
and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).
Therefore, it is expected that treatment with BI [ADDRESS_97016] of care (SSRI ; SNRI ) and in patients with BoPD, where no 
approved treatment is currently  available.
Mode of action
BI 1358894 is a highl y potent and selective TRPC4/5 Inhibitor (transient receptor potential 
cation channel, subfamily C, members 4 and 5). It has the potential to address cor e symptoms 
of PTSD, MDD and BoPD as it targets TRPC4/5 ion channels. TRPC4 and TRPC5 are highl y 
expressed in py ramidal neurons of the amy gdala in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and 
hypothalamus, brain areas that are involved in circuits contributing to e motional control. It is 
hypothesized that in patients with mood disorders, an overactive am ygdala is a major 
contributor to attentional bias to negative stimuli, pessimistic thoughts and anxiety

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_97017] -03(19.0) /Saved on:05Nov 2020[R16-5473 ].BI 1358894 is thought to decrease neuronal excitability  leading to normalization 
of the activation state of limbic circuits which are known to be important for emotional 
control. Therefore, it is expected that augmentation treatment with BI 1358894 has the 
potential to improve symptoms of patients with PTSD addressing and improving core 
debilitating sy mptoms of the disease and helpi[INVESTIGATOR_88777].
Data from non -clinical studies
Pre-clinicall y, it has been demonstrated that lack of TRPC4 and TRPC5 or its 
pharmacological inhibition with BI 1358894 attenuated fear and anxiety  without impairing 
other behaviours in mice.
BI 1358894 is a potent inhibitor of TRPC4 and TRPC5 containing channels. I n vitro studies 
confirmed the high selectivity  of the compound. In vivo the compound demonstrated efficacy  
in various rodent tests used to investigate circuits associated with depression and anxiety  
[c10354149].
BI 1358894 -related effects on the central nervous sy stem of rats were limited to an early  and 
transient increase of motility  at dose levels of 10, 30, and 100 mg/kg (nocturnal motility  test). 
This is considered to reflect an increased arousal or decreased anxiety  in a novel environment 
associated with the intended efficacy .
The toxicology  profile of BI 1358894 has been evaluated so far in a comprehensive set of in
vitro and in vivo studies. Doses and concentrations were adequately  high to explore the full 
range of potential adverse effects following exposure to BI 1358894. The studies support 
clinical trials of up to 13 weeks duration in adults, including women of childbearing potential.
The single dose toxicity  of BI 1358894 was low in mice and rats and moderate in dogs. 
Repeat dose toxicity  studies up to 13 weeks in mice, rats and dogs revealed toxicologically  
relevant effects on the skin (mice), Harderian glands (mice), hepatic function (mice), the 
vascular s ystem (rats) male genital track (rats), the Central Nervous S ystem (CNS) function 
(dogs), and the digestive tract, renal function, and white blood cell parameters in all three 
species. Further details on specific toxicity  are available in the Investigator’s Brochure 
[IB,c10354149]. I n addit ion, clinical pathology  evaluation showed mild inflammatory  
response at high dose levels in rodents (for details including safet y margins refer to section 
4.1.2)
BI [ADDRESS_97018]. However, the weight of male sex organs was slightl y reduced in rats after 
dosing for 13 weeks.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_97019] -03(19.0) /Saved on:05Nov 2020Testing for embry o-fetal development in rats revealed no findings related to BI 1358894. The 
highest dose tested, 1000 mg/kg/day , represented the NOAEL (No Observed Adverse Effect 
Level )for maternal and embry o-fetal toxicity . Safety  margins derived thereof were 5.[ADDRESS_97020] tested dose
(10 mg/kg/day ) was defined a s the NOAEL for embry o-fetal toxicity  in rabbits.
Oral administration of BI 1358894 to the pregnant Goettingen minipi[INVESTIGATOR_88778] o-fetal 
survival (due to a reduced number of in
trauterine implantations and an increased number of 
early resorptions) and decreased fetal weights, compared to control. In addition, there were 
higher incidences of skeletal malformations and/or variations. The NOAEL for embry o-fetal 
development (100 mg/k g/day ) corresponded to a mean Cmax of 1,980 nmol/L  and a mean 
AUC0 -24h of 31,300 nmol ∙h/L of BI 1358894, therefore providing safety  margins of 1.4 and 
1.6, respectivel y (compared with the predicted exposure at the human dose of 125 mg).
Data from clinical studies
Overall, [ADDRESS_97021] frequentl y reported adverse event (AE) with a higher f requency  in the BI 1358894 
treated groups than in placebo. There was no evidence of a dose dependency based on the 
available data. Overall, BI 1358894 was well tolerated in health y male patients, in male and 
female patients with MDD.
A comprehensive packa ge of safety  pharmacology and toxicology  studies has been conducted 
and demonstrated that BI 1358894 can be safel y administered to humans for up to 13 weeks.
Key pharmacokinetic characteristics
After administration of BI 1358894 tablets, maximum plasma concentration of BI 1358894 
occurred around 1 to 5 hours after dosing.
A long BI 1358894 terminal half -life of 188 hours with low plasma concentrations was found 
when blood samples were taken up to 672 hours. The terminal half -life was 41 to 52 hours for 
blood sampling up to 200 hours. Steady state was reached after 11 to 14 days of BI 1358894 
dosing, which is more in line with the half-life of 50 to 70 hours. Accumulation ratios for 
Cmax ranged from 1.6 to 1.8 and for AUC from 2.3 to 2.6.
Drug interactio ns
Based on in vitro Cytochrome (CYP ) inhibition data and in perspective with clinical BI 
1358894 exposure data, no restriction of concomitant therap y with sensitive substrates of 
CYP enzy mes were defined. No restrictions of concomitant therapy  were defined based on in 
vitro UGT inhibition da ta of BI 1358894.

Coadministration with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole increased BI 1358894 total 
exposure (<2-fold). As the increase is less than 2- fold, there are no restrictions for the use of 
concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors. 
In vitro data show that BI [ADDRESS_97024] study  contained mainly  the main metabolite, i.e. the carbox ylic acid me tabolite. Yet 
contained onl y minor amounts of other metabolites. Under stead y state conditions, on day  14, 
for the 50 mg dose, onl y 1.6% glucuronide metabolite was found, which is formed via UGT 
enzy mes. Since this is only  a minor metabolic pathway , inhibi tors of UGT enzy mes can be 
included as concomitant therap y.
Strong CYP3A4 inducers are excluded from concomitant therapy due to potential lowering of 
BI [ADDRESS_97025] on drug transporter substrates. BI 1358894 may  cause mild inhibition on P -
gp (probe substrate dabigatran, 1.2 -fold mean increase in AUC and Cmax). The mild 
inhibition was assessed as clinically  not relevant. Hence, the use of substrat es for the drug 
transporters P -gp is not restricted. However, results from 1402- [ADDRESS_97026] C ancer Resistance P rotein (BCRP )/OATP1B1/OATP1B3, 
which results in an increase of rosuvastatin levels (1.8- fold mean increase in AUC and Cmax) 
when concomitantl y taken with BI 1358894. The interaction could affect BCRP and Organic 
Anion Transporting Polypeptide ( OATP )channels and could impact all statins, since these 
transporters play a significant and general role in statin metabolism. I f statins are 
concomitantly  used during the trial, the highest dose of the statin should not be taken together 
with the investigational compound. Patien ts concomitantly  taking statins in this trial should 
be monitored for statin related toxicity  including my opath y.

1.3 RATIONALE FOR PERFOR MING THE TRIAL
Currently  the onl y generally  approved medication for treatment of PTSD are the selective 
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI s) sertraline and paroxetine. These medications produce 
reduction in sy mptom severity  rather than s ymptom remission, do not treat all sy mptoms, and 
have a relativel y low usage in patients with PTSD. Currently most national guidelines 
recommend ps ychotherapy as first lin e treatment for PTSD in adults and medications to be 
used as second line treatment. Thus there is a significant unmet medical need for more 
efficacious medications for first -line treatment of PTSD.
TRPC4/5 channels modulate the excitability  of the amy gdala /cortico -limbic sy stem. As a 
TRPC4/[ADDRESS_97029] decrease in the 
Blood -oxygenation -level -dependent (BOLD) activation of the am ygdala in an emotional face 
task. I n an emotional scene task the BOLD signal was also significantl y and robustly reduced 
in amy gdala and additional brain areas. BI 1358894 is currentl y being tested in Phase II 
clinical trials in patien ts with MDD and BoPD. Thus the MoA of this compound in principle 
holds significant potential benefit for individuals with PTSD.
For the PTSD patient trial population, a cut- point on the CAPS -5 of ≥ 30 was selected with 
the following rationale: I n literatu re, the cut -point on the CAPS -5 of ≥ 30 has been postulated 
to represent a reasonable lower score representing moderate PTSD, being roughl y in the 
middle of the moderate severit y range (23 -34) [R21-0830] . The cutoff criteria for CAPS - 5 
were largel y extrapolated from the empi[INVESTIGATOR_60519] y derived severit y score ranges determined in 
the CAPS version based on DSM -IV (CAPS -IV), adjusting for the changes in the number of 
symptoms and the new metric for CAPS- 5 item severities. The cutoff criterion of ≥ 30 is also 
acknowledged b y PTSD experts to be clinically meaningful in terms of selecting for 
moderate severit y of PTSD. I t is further supported by  [CONTACT_88811] -5 suggesting that
our selected cut-offon CAPS -5of ≥ 30 
is a reasonable cut- off for inclusion of patients in a 
treatment intervention trial.
In order to be able to address future scientific questions, patients will be asked to voluntarily  
donate biospecimens for banking (please see Section 5.7). If the patient agrees, banked 
samples may  
be used for future biomarker research and drug development projects, e.g. to 
identify  patients that are more likely  to benefit from a treatment or experience an adverse 
event (AE), or to gain a mechanistic or genetic understanding of drug effects and thereb y 
better match patients with therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].

The overall safet y profile of BI 1358894 is outlined in the current IB c10354149 .
1.4.1 Benefits
This is an experimental drug at an early stage of testing and therefore an individual benefit 
cannot be guaranteed. Potential efficacy  has been demonstrated in pre-clinical and PoCP data.
1.4.2 Risks
In a comprehensive pa ckage of safet y pharmacology, genetic toxicology , general toxicology , 
and nonclinical studies, BI 1358894 was demonstrated to be safe in humans for up to 13 
weeks. Based on the mode of action, the pharmacological target, non -clinical toxicology  data 
and cl inical data, BI 1358894 is not considered a high -risk compound for clinical studies. As 
in other clinical trials, trial patients are exposed to the risks related to the exposure to the trial 
medication and to the risks of the trial procedures.
In one completed pi[INVESTIGATOR_88779] o-fetal development study  in Goettingen minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], embry o-
fetal development toxicity  was identified (decreased number of implantations, increased 
number of earl y resorptions, decreased fetal weight, skeletal malformations) at relevant
human exposure levels. Maternal toxicity  was not seen at human relevant doses. The NOAEL 
shows that the findings are relevant for the maximum dose (125 mg once daily ) tested in the 
ongoing clinical trials.
Therefore, a risk for teratogenicity  in humans c annot be excluded. To mitigate this risk, 
women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) who are heterosexually  active must agree and 
adhere to contraceptive measures consisting of one highl y effective method of birth control 
per ICH M3 (R2) that results in a low failure rate of less than 1% plus one additional barrier 
method during the treatment and follow
-up period of the trial. Pregnancy  testing has to be 
performed at every  site visit. Additionally , investigators must counsel WOCBP with regard to 
the importance of contraception and confirmation of appropriate contraception use at all visit s
as per Flow Chart 1(including phone visits).
While there are no precedent clinical data implicating association between TRPC4/5 
antagonism an d Suicidal Ideation and Behavior (SIB), in the interest of ensuring patient 
safet y, trial patients will be proactivel y screened and monitored throughout the trial for SIB 
in accordance with available regulatory  guidance.
Because ps ychoactive drugs may  impair thinking, judgment, and/or motor skills, patients 
should be cautioned about operating machinery, including automobiles, until they  are 
reasonabl y certain that the study  medication does not adversel y affect their abilit y to engage 
in such activities. I t is recommended that patients should exercise caution when driving or 
operating machinery .
Patients will be closely  monitored during the trial participation (including AE monitoring 
beyond clinic visits and assessment of suicidal ideation during clinic visits) to ensure that

The trial will be monitored by  [CONTACT_88812] (DMC), independent 
from the sponsor; refer to section 8.7 for further DMC details.
BI 1358894 is a highl y specific inhibitor of TRPC 4/5 channels, which are predominantl y 
located in the CNS. All investigation into distribution and function of TRPC 4/5 (preclinical 
and clinical) so far have not identified any  interference with the immune sy stem, the 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_88780] -vascular s ystem.
For the Phase II trial, the benefit -risk for the trial patients treated with BI 1358894 remain 
unchanged in relation to the COVID -19 pandemic since:
The mode of action does not appear to have a substantial effect on clinically  relevant 
organs (e.g. respi[INVESTIGATOR_88781] s ystem) critically  affected by  [CONTACT_4113] -19
There is currentl y no evidence that intake of BI 1358894 leads to immunosuppression
There is currentl y no evidence that their underl ying disease ( PTSD ) makes the patients at 
higher risk to SARS -CoV -2 infection or to develop severe COVID-19
The PTSD patient s are relatively  young patients (30 – 50 years) and in general without 
common co-morbidities associated with severe course of COVID-19
Therefore, the risk for patients or patients participating in these studies will not differ from 
the current general ris k for humans of SARS -CoV 2 infection with all its potential 
consequences. A specific SARS -CoV 2 PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) serving as a tool 
for inclusion or exclusion of trial patients during the screening phase is not foreseen, since it 
is not belie ved that study substance or comparator imply  an elevated risk for the patient to 
develop COVID -19. It is also not believed that a SARS -CoV2 infection or clinical apparent 
COVID -[ADDRESS_97032] of SARS -CoV2 infection. The investigators will take the totality  of 
information related to each single patient, including but not limited to physical exam, vitals, 
ECG, safet y labs, etc., and the local COVID-19 situation into consideration when performing 
the individual benefit -risk assessment. Considering all aspects, the investigator will decide 
upon each patient’s inclusion and continued participation in the trial. BI as the sponsor, where 
required, will support the investigator in their decision finding. It is acknowledged that the 
investigator may  decide to implement protocol deviations where this protects the safet y, 
wellbeing and/or is in the best interest of the patient and the site environment.

Considering this patient population, and the need to adequatel y monitor suicidality, frequent 
clinic and phone visits, which include C- SSRS assessments, are planned in this trial to 
monitor patients.
Additionally , all patients will be allowed to continue antidepressants and other ps ychiatric 
medications (i.e. non -benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_88783]) if on stable treatment at the time of trial 
entry  and throughout the whole trial performance. Conside ring the mechanism of action of 
BI1358894 and the adverse events reported in clinical trials to date, there is no undue risk 
related to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_88784], nor an y major risk related t o potential aggravation of the side effect profile/s of the 
background medication/s.
After patients have completed trial participation, they  should return to treatment as prescribed 
by [CONTACT_88813].
Embry o-fetal development toxicity  has been identified in a pre -clinical study  in minipi[INVESTIGATOR_88785]. Therefore, a risk for teratogenicity  in humans cannot be 
excluded. I t is of high importance that WOCBP strictly  adhere to contraceptive measures 
consisting of one highl y eff
ective method of birth control per ICH M3 (R2) that results in a 
low failure rate of less than 1% plus one additional barrier method during the treatment and 
follow -up period of the study . Sexual abstinence as a contraceptive method will not be 
allowed for WOCBP who are heterosexually  active. Pregnancy  testing has to be performed at 
every  site visit. Additionally , WOCBP will be repeatedl y counselled with regard to the need 
for contraception at all visits as per Flow Chart 1 (including phone visits).
Considering the acceptable and manageable safet y profile of BI 1358894 as demonstrated in 
nonclinical and toxicology studies, good tolerability in clinical studies performed to date,  
close monitoring (including the above -mentioned risk mitigation activities to minimize the 
risk of pregnancy  during the trial) planned during the trial visits and the involvement of an 
independent external DMC, the potential risks to the patients will be minimized and 
outweighed b y a potential therapeu tic benefit of the trial drug and more effective treatment 
for patients with PTSD.

total, app roximately  286 male and female patients with PTSD meeting the entry  criteria are 
planned to be randomized into this trial.
V = Visit, W = Week, EOT = End of Treatment, EOS = End of study, = Telephonic Visit
Figure 3.1: 1 Trial design
Patients are enrolled into the trial after informed written consent has been obtained. Eligible 
patients will be randomized to double -blind treatment with either placebo (approx. n=143) or 
BI 1358894 at 125 mg QD (approx. n=143). Total treatment duration w ill be eight weeks, 
refer to Figure 3.1: 1.
After the completion of the 8 -week double -blind treatment period or following earl y 
discontinuation of the trial at an y timepoint, patients will complete the 4 -week follow -up 
period with the end of study  (EOS) visit. All (S)AEs, including those persisting after 
individual patient’s end of study  must be followed up until they  have resolved, have been 
assessed as “chronic” or “stable”, or no further information can be obtained. I ndividual 
patient participation is concluded when the patient has completed their last planned visit (end

CONTROL GROUP(S)
This is a randomized double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -design trial. This design is 
appropriate for providing proof-of- concept and assessing the safet y and efficacy of 
BI1358894 compared to placebo in p atients with PTSD. I t is important to have a placebo 
control to address potential confounding factors. This is acceptable as patients will remain on 
their stable background treatment and the duration of the placebo treatment will be limited to 
8 weeks.
The design of the trial will provide efficacy  and safety  of BI 1358895 on PTSD patients to 
support proof of concept. 
Data at Week 8 will provide evidence of efficacy  and safety of BI 1358894 compared to 
placebo. In addition, safety  data will also be obtain ed through the end of observation period 
(early drug discontinuation date / EOT+28+2 days). Exploratory  outcomes from Ecological 
Momentary  Assessments (EcMAs) are intended to assess the disease status in the patients’ 
natural environments. Collectively , this information will help facilitate the design of the 
Phase III program.
BI [ADDRESS_97049] in class compound, hence, it was decided to include the 
review of data b y an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), independent from the 
spons or, to review the trial data as a general safety measure. The purpose of the DMC is to 
ensure that the safet y of the patients participating in this trial is maintained by  [CONTACT_88814] s afety  events of trial 
drugs based on emerging data.
The DMC will evaluate and anal yse accrued patient data in order to recommend whether the 
trial or program should continue, be modified or stopped for safet y concerns. 
The DMC will review pertinent tria l data, including SAEs, AEs and laboratory  data. DMC 
meeting frequency  and logistics will be specified in a separate DMC Charter.

complete, and will not be allowed to recruit additional patient s for this trial. Patients alread y 
in screening at this time will be allowed to continue to randomisation, if eligible.
A log of all patients enrolled into the trial (i.e., who have signed informed consent) will be 
maintained in the Investigator Site File (ISF) irrespective of whether they have been treated 
with investigational drug or not.
If retrospectivel y it is found that a patient has been randomized < in error (=did not meet all 
inclusion criteria or me tone or more exclusion criteria), the sponsor or delegate should be

made whether continued trial participation is possible or not.
Retesting
Retesting applies in situations when the issue can be resolved within the screening period of 
28 day s.For example patients that are testing positive on urine drug screen for cannabis or 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_88786] 1 can be retested once (consider long half -life of cannabis) within the 
screening period of [ADDRESS_97052] or has stable treatment 
with medically  prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], both at the discretion of the investigator.
In case of retesting, the patient will keep the same patient number. The results of all retests
should be available within the 28 day s of screening period. Once retests are available and 
negative for the retested parameter /eligibility confirmed, and in case all other eligibility  
criteria are met, the patient can be randomized on the planned Visit [ADDRESS_97053] become eligible.
Potential reasons for rescreening could be: 
Active infection with SARS -CoV -2 
Suicidal ity once the required exclusion period is over
Clinically  significant findings per Investigators judgement 
Restricted medications like CYPs/ alternative or traditional medicine 
Positive urine drug test at screening visit, if longer wash -out period needed
Background therapy  must be stable prior to re -screening.
For other potential reasons, please contact [CONTACT_88816] (CTL).
In case of re -screening, the patient will receive a new patient number. The patient must sign 
the current, approved version of the informed consent before an y stud y specific procedures 
are performed.

3.3.4 Discontinuation of patient s from treatment or assessments
Patients may  discontinue trial treatment or withdraw consent to trial participation as a whole 
(“withdrawal of consent”) with very  different implications; please see sections [IP_ADDRESS] and 
[IP_ADDRESS] below.
However, if the patient agrees, they  should stay  in the trial: even if continued trial treatment 
is not possible, they  should attend further trial visits to ensure their safet y and to collect 
important trial data.
After premature stud y drug discontinuation, patients will be asked to further attend scheduled 
trial visits unless they  withdraw consent to participate in the study . 
It is vital to explain to patients the importance of continuing trial participation and the value 
of collecting data for all randomized patients. 
Measures to control the withdrawal rate include careful patient selection, appropriate 
explanation of the trial requirements and procedures prior to trial enrolment, as well as the 
explanation of the options for early  discontinuation and explanation of the consequences in 
case of withdrawals.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_97067] -03(19.0) /Saved on:05Nov 2020The decision to discontinue trial treatment or withdraw consent to trial participation and the 
reason must be documented in the patient files and CRF. If applicable, consider the 
requirements for Adverse Event collection reporting (please see section [IP_ADDRESS]).
[IP_ADDRESS] Discontinuation of trial treatment
Ideally, the patient should attend all remaining visits and perform all stud y related procedures 
according to Flow Chart 1, Flow Chart 2 and section 6.2. 2An ear ly EoT (eEOT) Visit shall 
be conducted within [ADDRESS_97068] regularl y scheduled visits after premature drug discontinuation (if consistent with the 
planned visit schedule, the eEOT can replace the next regularl y scheduled clinic visit). After 
this early  EOT visit, patients should be followed up according to the regularly  scheduled visit 
for both clinic and phone visits including Visit 10 and should be encouraged to complete the 
EOS Visit 28+2 day s after the drug discontinuation date. All procedures should be 
completed, with the exception of trial drug procedures and PK collections. If a regular 
planned visit is completed prior to the initially planned Visit10 (earl y drug discontinuation 
date + 2 8+2 day s), no additional FUP Visit may be needed. However, end of study  
participation (EOS) must be completed.
If the patient does not agree to return for all remaining scheduled visits, the patient should be 
encouraged to return at least for an earl y EoT (eEOT) Visit within [ADDRESS_97069] dose of 
trial medication, for the regularl y scheduled Visit 10 and EOS. If EOS visit (earl y drug 
discontinuation date + 28 +2 day s) can be completed prior to the date of the planned Visit 10, 
no additional FUP Visit may beneeded. However, end of study  participation (EOS) must be 
completed. 
Should the patient not agree to an y further clinic visits, at least phone contacts should occur 
at the scheduled visit time points, should that not be acceptable, a phone contac t at the end of 
the planned observation period (i.e. [ADDRESS_97070] 
dose) should occur to collect the most relevant information: vital status (please see section 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 )adver se events, or last contact [CONTACT_88818] -up. 
Patients who refuse all of the above are considered to have fully withdrawn consent to 
participate in the trial. In this case, the patient does not need to justify  the decision and should 
be w ithdrawn from the trial and all follow -up assessments (please refer to section [IP_ADDRESS]).
Withdrawal from the trial of an individual patient may  be considered also in case of 
administrative reasons, such as but not limited to multiple important protocol violations and 
persistent non -compliance. No patient should be withdrawn from the trial befo re discussion 
with the sponsor.
An individual patient will discontinue trial treatment if:
The patient wants to discontinue trial treatment. The patient will be asked to explain the 
reasons but has the right to refuse to answer.
The patient has repeatedly shown to be non -compliant with important trial procedures

The patient needs to take concomitant medication that interferes with the investigational 
medicinal product or other trial treatment; refer to the I SF.
The patient undergoes an ECT .
Patient receives Ketamine /S- Ketamine treatment during the course of the trial .
The patient can no longer receive trial treatment for serious medical reasons (such as 
surgery , adverse events, other diseases, or pregnancy), per investigator’s clinical 
judgement. In case of a temporary  reason, trial treatment should be res tarted if medically  
justified.
Pregnancy  occurs during the trial. (Once a patient has been enrolled in the clinical trial 
and has taken trial medication, the investigator must report an y drug exposure during 
pregnancy  which occurred in a female trial patie nt to the Sponsor immediately  (within 24 
hours) b y means of Part A of the Pregnancy Monitoring Form to the Sponsor’s unique 
entry  point).
The patient must discontinue treatment with trial medication if the patient develops 
suicidal ideation of ty pe 4 or 5 in the C-SSRS (i.e., active suicidal thought with intent but 
without specific plan, active suicidal thought with plan and intent) or suicidal behaviour 
(i.e. actual attempt, interrupted attempt, aborted attempt or preparatory  acts or behavior).
In additio n to these criteria, the phy sician may  discontinue treatment at any time based on his 
or her clinical judgment. For all patients the reason for withdrawal from trial treatment (e.g. 
AEs) must be recorded in the CRF. These data will be included in the trial database and 
reported.
If new efficacy /safet y information becomes available, Boehringer Ingelheim will review the 
benefit -risk-assessment and, if needed, pause or discontinue the trial treatment for all patient s 
or take an y other appropriate action to en sure the safet y of the trial patients.
Even if the trial treatment is discontinued, the patient
sremain in the trial and, given their
agreement, will undergo the procedures for early  treatment discontinuation and follow -up as 
outlined in the Flow Chart 1,Flow Chart 2 andsection 6.2.3 .
[IP_ADDRESS] Withdrawal of consent totrial participation
Patients may  withdraw their consent totrial participation at an y time without the need to 
justify  the decision.
If a patient wants to withdraw consent, the investigator should be involved in the discussion 
with the patient and explain the difference between trial treatment discontinuation and 
withdrawal of consent totrial participation , as well as explain the options for continued 
follow -upafter trial treatment discontinuation , please see section [IP_ADDRESS] above.

4.1.2 Selection of doses in the trial anddose modifications
The dose of 125 mg BI 1358894, once dail y, is selected for this trial based on the results of
the PK and safet y data obtained in the trials 1402 -0001 (Single Rising Dose (SRD) and Food
Effect), 1402 -0002 (Multiple Rising Dose (MRD)), and 1402- 0010 (rel Bioavailability  (BA);
formulation selection) combined with the preclinical efficacy  data.
In the SRD trial, single dose levels u p to [ADDRESS_97074] trial,
multiple dose levels up to 200 mg were well tolerated. The 125 mg was selected to account
for potential larger variability  in PK in Phase II due to a more heterogeneous population that
is expected compared to Phase I. This dose is expected to deliver a 5 -fold concentration of
the target C 16,ss in 49.8 % to 96.6 % of patient s depending on the food condition.
Therefore it is concluded that the dose of 125 mg once dail y has an acceptable safet y margin

BI 1358894 was tested in several Phase I studies:
evaluation of safet y, tolerability  and PK after single and multiple dose
evaluation of relative bioavailability  under fasted and fed conditions of different solid 
oralformulations
evaluation of drug- drug interaction with strong index CYP3A4 inhibitor
evaluation of ph ysiological response and circuit engagement in a Cholecy stokinin
Tetrapeptide (CCK- 4) challenge in health y volunteers
evaluation of ph ysiological response and circuit engagement in a functional MRI  
study  indepressed patients after single dose
BI [ADDRESS_97076] dose tested (200 mg under fed
conditions) after a single dose (after a high calorie/high fat breakfast) a s well as after 14 day
qd dosing (after continental breakfast). BI 1358894 (single dose of 100 mg administered
under fed conditions) also demonstrated ph ysiological response b y attenuation of CCK -4
induced panic s ymptoms, attenuation of CCK -4 induced stres s hormone elevation 
(Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and Cortisol) and reduction in the score of the 
emotional Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).
Within preclinical research, the forced swim test in mice was evaluated to test potentially
efficacious concentrations. This test resulted in an EC50 of 77 nM (and a corresponding
EC90 of 165 nM). This target concentration of [ADDRESS_97077] would lead to exposures that lie
somewhere in -between those predicted. Of note, exposure of BI 1358894 incr eases less than
dose-proportionally. The current Pop PK model over predicts Cmax , hence, predicted exposure
may be higher than exposures to be observed in Phase II.
Repeat -dose toxicity  testing with dail y administration for 13 weeks revealed a NOAEL of
1000 mg/kg/day  in rats. This NOAEL is considered to represent the most relevant NOAEL
for repeat -dose toxicity  testing in rats, as detailed in the IB [ c10354149]. This dose resulted 
inmaximum plasma levels and exposures that rep resented sufficient multiples of the same
parameters as predicted for a 125 mg dose in humans and fed conditions. Cmax and AUC 0-24h
at the NOAEL in rats are also higher than the 95th percentile of the respective parameter at
the maximum dose of BI  1358894 in Phase II under fed conditions (for details see IB).
Repeat dose toxicity  testing for up to 13 weeks in dogs revealed an overall NOAEL of 
30mg/kg/day , as described in detail in the IB [ c10354149 ]. This dose resulted in maxi mum

in dogs were also higher than the 95th percentile of the prediction of the resp ective parameter
at the maximum dose of BI 1358894 in Phase II under fed conditions (for details see IB
[c10354149].
In conclusion, results of repeat- dose toxicity  testing support the conduct of Phase II clinical
trials at the 125 mg dose once dail y at fasted or fed conditions and for a maximum duration of
treatment of 13 weeks.
4.1.3 Method of assigning patient s to treatment groups
After the assessment of all in- and exclusion criteria, each eligible patient will be randomized 
to treatment groups according to a randomisation plan at Visit 2 via I nteractive Response 
Technology  (IRT). Note that the medication number is different from t he patient number (the 
latter is generated during screening via the IRT System). To facilitate the use of the IRT, the 
Investigator will receive all necessary  instructions.
Patients will be randomly  assigned with an allocation ratio of 1:1 to the following treatment 
groups:
125 mg BI 1358894
Placebo matching BI 1358894
Patient assignment to the treatment groups will be determined b y a computer -generated 
random sequence. Randomization sequence will be generated using validated randomisation 
softwar e. Access to the randomization code will be controlled and documented.
Randomization into each treatment group will be stratified by :
-presence of significant childhood trauma (YES/NO, according to investigator´s judgement, 
assessed b y CTQ at screening v isit)
The kit(s) corresponding to the assigned medication number(s) should be given to the patient
and entered in the eCRF. Using this procedure, relevant parties will be blinded to the 
treatment group assignment.
4.1.4 Drug assignment and administration of dos es for each patient
The medication assignment will be provided through IRT. The assigned medication 
number(s) must be entered in the eCRF, and the corresponding medication kit(s) must be 
given to the patient. The duration of treatment is [ADDRESS_97079] dose of trial medication 
should be taken on the day before the EOT Visit. Dosing per treatment assignment is noted in 
Table 4.1.4:1.
At Visit 2, after randomization, patient s will receive medication kits for the double -blind 
treatment period. The morning dose of trial medication will be taken at the trial site under 
supervision of the investigator or site staff. P atient s will bring trial medication (used/unused 
blister and covering packages) to site visits for compliance ch eck (V4/V6/V8/V10). At visits 
V4, V6 and V8, patients will return used/unused medication kits and receive new supplies.

No formal interim report will be generated. Final PK and PK/PD analyses will be reported 
once after availability  of data from DBL.
The access to the randomisation code will be kept restricted until its release for anal ysis.
The randomisation codes will be provided to bioanalytics before the last patient completed 
the trial to exclude placebo or comparator samples from the PK anal ysis. Bioanaly tics will 
not disclose the randomisation code or the results of their measurement s until the database 
lock.
[IP_ADDRESS] Unblinding and breaking the code
Emergency  unblinding will be available to the investigator via IRT. It must only  be used in 
an emergency situation when the identity  of the trial drug must be known to the investigator 
in order to provide appropriate medical treatment or otherwise assure safety  of trial patients. 
The reason for unblinding must be documented in the source documents and/or appropriate 
CRF page.
Due to the requirements to report Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse R eactions 
(S[LOCATION_003]Rs), it may  be necessary  for a representative from BI’s Pharmacovigilance group to

Patients on statins should be monitored for statin -related toxicity  including signs of 
myopath y,weakness, muscle pain, etc. along with clinical lab results. If statins are 
concomitantly  used during the trial, the highest dose should not be taken together with the 
investigational compound. If a patient in this trial is on the highest reco mmended statin dose, 
investigator should consider changing the statin dose to the next lower dose recommended for 
the respective statin if appropriate.
Please note:
Investigators may  use their clinical discretion to wash out (at least 3 half
-lives of 
referenced medication) the restricted medications during the screening period. The patient 
must adhere to the screening visit dose of the allowed background medication for the 
entire duration of the trial. 
Patients who are on stable treatment with low -dose antipsy chotics for treatment of 
insomnia or similar for at least 2 months prior to randomization should continue without 
change for the entire trial duration. Antipsy chotic treatment for ps ychiatric sy mptoms is 
disallowed.
Patients who are on stable treatment with ongoing antidepressants for at least 2 months 
prior to randomization should continue without change for the entire trial duration.
Patients who are on stable treatment with ongoing benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (including Z -drugs) or 
non-benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_88791] s for at least 2 months prior to randomization should

[IP_ADDRESS] Contraception requirements
Women of ch ildbearing potential (WOCBP -for the definition please refer to section 3.3.2 )
must use two methods of contraception, which include one highl y effective methods of birth 
control per ICH M3 (R2) that result in a low failur e rate of less than 1%, plus one additional 
barrier method. Contraception must be used during the treatment and follow -up period. 
Women of child- bearing potential must agree to periodic pregnancy  testing during 
participation in the trial. If a urine preg nancy  test is positive, a serum test needs to be 
performed for confirmation.
Counseling about the importance of having birth control measures in place will be performed 
at study  entry  visit (during consenting process), informing women about the risk of 
medication -induced births defects when exposed to potentially  teratogenic medication. 
Investigator must ensure that the patient understands the contraception requirements for the 
study  and must confirm that the patient can reliably  compl y with contraception use during the 
study . Patients not expected to comply  with contraception requirements should not be 
included in the study .
The importance of continuing with their chosen forms of birth control during study  conduct 
will be emphasized to mitigate this risk and it must be reiterated at all visits as per Flow Chart
1(including phone visits). This must include confirmation from the patient that she is using 
required contraception consistently  and appropriately . If contraceptive protection cannot be 
confirmed, as judged b y the investigator, the patient must be discontinued from the study  
drug. Stud y drug can be restarted onl y when contraception is used again, and sufficient 
protection is reached. Counseling and contraception confi rmation must be recorded in CRFs.

5.1 CONFIRMATION OF DIAG NOSIS
Eligibility  of patients for the trial will be evaluated using the Clinician -Administered PTSD 
Scale for DSM -5 (CAPS -5) during screening for confirmation of the diagnosis of Post-
Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). To exclude patients with other psy chiatric d isorders as 
described in the exclusion criteria, the Mini International Neurops ychiatric Interview will be 
performed.
The CAPS- 5 and MINI will be audio recorded at the screening v isit 1 and the recordings will 
be reviewed b y an independent external clinic al reviewer from .
MINI - Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview
The MINI is a structured diagnostic interview designed to provide a brief standardised 
evaluation of mental health disorders in line with DSM -5 criteria [R07-1303 , R07-1261 ,R07-
1263 , R07-1262 ].Each of the independent 17 diagnostic modules consists of screening and a 
series of secondary  questions to be answered with “yes” or “no” responses. If the patient 
answers “no” to a screening question, the clinician starts asking questions from the next 
module. A clinician can use the MINI after a short training session. It takes approximately  20 
minutes to administer the MI NI.
In this study , the MINI for psychotic disorders studies (English verison 7.0.2 for DSM -5) 
customized for Boehringer Ingelheim International will be used. The customization comprise s
the following two modifications:
Module Y “Borderline Personality  Disorder” will be added to the MINI to assess comor bid 
BoPD.
Module B “suicidality ” will not be administered, all evaluations in relation to suicidality 
will be performed with the C
-SSRS (please refer to section [IP_ADDRESS] ).
The Ohio State University  TBI Identificat ion Method Short Form will be used to assess an y 
history  of traumatic brain injury  for patients.
OSU TBI- ID-SF –Ohio State University TBI Identification Method Short Form
The Ohio State University  TBI Identification Method Short Form (OSU -TBI-ID-SF) is a 
structured clinic al interview designed to detect lifetime history  of exposure to TBI [R21-
2334 , R21-2333 ]. Multiple dimensions of history  are available, including number of injuries 
without or with loss of consciousness; duration of loss of consciousness from none, < 30 
minutes, 30 minutes to 24 hours to > 24 hours; age at (first) TBI, worst injury  and repeated 
injuries.
A scoring s ystem is used to quantify  these dimensions and to categorize the likelihood of TBI 
expo sure as: improbable -possible - mild - moderate - severe TBI. 
It takes approximately  5 minutes to complete and score the OSU TBI -ID-SF.

CAPS -
5 -Clinician -Administered PTSD Scale for DSM - 5
The Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS -5) is a 30- item structured 
interview designed to make a current and lifetime diagnosis of PTSD evaluating the past 
month period as well as to assess PTSD sy mptoms over the past month or past week,
depen ding on the version used. [R21-2327 , R21-0830 , R21-2548 ].
In addition to assessing the [ADDRESS_97100] of sy mptoms on social and occupational 
functioning, improvement in sy mptoms since a previous CAPS administration, overall 
response validity , overall PTSD sever ity, and specifications for the dissociative subty pe 
(depersonalization and derealization). Administration requires identification of an index 
traumatic event to serve as the basis for s ymptom inquiry .
Each of the 20 s ymptom items is rated on a 5- point se verity  rating scale ranging from 0 
(absent) to 4 (extreme/incapacitating) with a single severit y score combining information 
about frequency /amount and intensity  according to detailed scoring rules. A CAPS -5 total 
symptom severit y score is y ield by  [CONTACT_88823]. The total severit y score 
ranges from 0 to 80 with higher scores indicating higher s ymptom severity .
CAPS -5 symptom cluster severit y scores are yield by  [CONTACT_88824] (sometimes also referred to as domain) : Criterion B (re -
experiencing), Criterion C (avoidance), Criterion D (negative alterations in cognitions and 
mood) and Criterion E (hy perarousal). A s ymptom cluster can also be calculated for 
dissociation by  [CONTACT_88825] 29 and 30.
Two formats of the CAPS -5 measure will be used in this trial:
CAPS -[ADDRESS_97101] month version for confirmation of PTSD diagnosis and evaluation of 
eligibility (for screening visit only ) [R21-2327].
CAPS -[ADDRESS_97102] week version for efficacy  measurement (all subsequent trial visits) [R21-

The Clinical Global I mpression Severity  Scale (CGI -S) is a single item rating scale designed 
to measure the clinician's impression of the severity of illness exhibited by  a patient that takes 
into account all available information, including knowledge of the patient's history , 
psychosocial circumstances, s ymptoms, behavior, a nd the impact of the s ymptoms on the 
patient's abilit y to function. The CGI -S evaluates the severit y of ps ychopathology  on a seven-
point scale [ R03-0520, R19 - 1932 ]. 
The CGI -S question states “Considering your total clinical experience with this particular 
population, how ill is the patient at this time (at the visit and over the course of the past 7 
days) (Note that the subject’s illness is the disease under study ; in this case, Post-Traumatic 
Stress Disorder – NOT other conditions/co- morbidities.) ”, and is rated on the following 
seven -point scale: 1=normal, not at all ill; 2=borderline ill; 3=mildly  ill; 4=moderatel y ill; 
5=markedl y ill; 6=severely  ill; 7=among the most extremely  ill patients.
In the FlowChart 2this is referred to as CGI -S (total). 
In addition, domain level CGI- S versions covering DSM -5/CAPS -5 domains (intrusion 
symptoms , persistent avoidance, negative alterations in cognitions and mood and alterations 
in arousal and reactivit y) assessing clinicians’ impression on domain level severit y at this 
time (at the visit and over the course of the past 7 days) will be performed. The domain level 
CGI-S are rated on the following five -point scale: 1=none; 2=mild ; 3=moderate ; 4=severe
and 5=very severe .
In the FlowChart 2this is referred to as CGI -S (domain) . 
The Clinical Global I mpression Change Scale (CGI -C) is a single item rating scale designed 
to measure the clinician's impression of change of the patient’s condition since start of 
medication intake [R03-0520].
The CGI -C question states “Please choose the response that best describes the overall change 
in the patient’s condition si nce he/she started taking the stud y medication. (Note that the 
subject’s illness is the disease under study ; in this case, Post -Traumatic Stress Disorder –

STAI -The State -Trait Anxiety Inventory
The State- Trait Anxiety  Inventory  (STAI) for adults has been used extensively  in research 
and clinical practice. It comprises separate self- report scales for measuring state and trait 
anxiety . The S -Anxiety  scale (STAI Form Y- 1) consists of twenty  statements that evaluate 
how respondents feel “right now, at this moment.” The T -Anxiety  scale (STAI Form Y -2) 
consists of twenty  statements that assess how people generally  feel [R98-0762].
Each STAI item is rated o n a four -point scale, from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much so). A 
rating of 4 indicates the presence of a high level of anxiety for ten S -Anxiety  items and 
eleven T- Anxiety  items (e.g., “I feel frightened,” “I feel upset”). A high rating indicates the 
absen ce of anxiety  for the remaining ten S -Anxiety  items and nine T -Anxiety  items (e.g., “I 
feel calm,” “I feel relaxed”). 
A total score for the S -Anxiety  and T -Anxiety  scales is y ield by  [CONTACT_88827] 20

descriptive s ystem and the EQ Visual Analogue scale (EQ VAS). 
The EQ -5D- 5L descriptive sy stem comprises 5 dimensions of health (mobility , self care, 
usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety
/depression). Each dimension has 5 levels: no 
problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. The 
EQ VA S records the patient’s self -rated health status on a vertical visual analogue scale 
graduated from 0 (worst) to 100 (best health the patient can imagine) [R12-1920 ]. 
It is a generic measure, rather than disease- specific, and i s therefore applicable to a wide 
range of health conditions and treatments. It provides a simple descriptive profile and a single 
index value for health status.
It takes approximately  5 minutes to complete the EQ -5D- 5L.

5.4.4 Electrocardiogram
The 12- lead ECGs will be performed as scheduled in the Flow Chart 1. Twelve - lead ECGs (I, 
II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1 – V6) will be recorded using equipment provided by  a central 
ECG vendor. The ECGs will be recorded for at least 10- second duration after the patient s 
have rested for at least 5 minutes in a s upi[INVESTIGATOR_35921]. Electrode 
placement will be performed according to the method of Einthoven/Goldberger (ankles and 
wrists). At 
all-time points indicated in the Flow Chart 1, single ECGs will be record ed. ECG 
recordings at planned time points may  be repeated for quality  reasons like alternating current 
artefacts, muscle movements and electrode dislocation. I n this case the repeated ECG 
recordings will be used if quality  was better.
The investigator or a designee will evaluate whether the ECG is normal or abnormal and 
whether it is clinically  significant, if abnormal. The electronic version of the ECG is regarded 
as source data. Dated and signed printouts will be stored in the patient ’s medical file if there 
is no validated and certified e -medical record for ECG data.
Additional ECGs may  be collected b y the investigator for safet y reasons. Clinically  relevant 
findings (in accordance with the central ECG report) noticed at screening (V isit 1) should be 
reported as baseline condition. Clinically  relevant abnormal findings noticed at subsequent 
assessment swill be reported as AEs and followed up and/or treated as medically  appropriate 
until normal or stable condition.
All ECGs will be transmitted electronically  to the central ECG vendor in order to enable a 
centralized and independent re- evaluation of all 12 -lead ECGs. A centralized and 
independent re -evaluation will be done. Abnormalities detected during this centralized ECG 
evaluation will not necessarily  qualify  as AE.
Central evaluation on individual ECG level will be performed b y the vendor and a report will 
be provided to the site. Decisions on eligibility for the trial and treatment or further follow -
up 
of an y findings are in the responsibility  of the investigator , based on the central ECG report.

[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Suicidality
C-SSRS -Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale
Suicidal risk assessed b y the C -SSRS. The C -SSRS is a semi -structured, investigator -rated 
interview, developed b y clinical experts in cooperation with the FDA, assessing both suicidal 
behavior and suicidal ideation. I t does not give a global score, but provides some categorical 
and some severity  information specificall y for behavior and ide ation.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_97122] -03(19.0) /Saved on:05Nov 2020The C -SSRS is completed by  [CONTACT_88831]/tablet 
provided b y the vendor.
The C -SSRS has been widely  used in large multinational clinical trials. The C -SSRS will be 
administered first at screening (Visit 1) (using the ‘Baseline / Screening’ version) with the 
aim to exclude patient s with active moderate or severe s ymptomatology  within a specified 
time prior to screening (i.e. 3 months for suicidal ideation and 1 y ear for suicidal behavior) . 
The lifetime history of suicidal ideation and behavior will also be recorded.
After screening (Visit 1) the assessment ‘since last visit’ will be performed at each trial visit
i.e. clinic and phone visits as per Flow Chart 2 (‘Since Last Visit version’). The investigator 
is to review/consider the C -SSRS results for plausibility  and clinical relevance. If the positive 
report is confirmed, appropriate actions for the patient’s safet y have to be initiated.
An experienced clinic ian can use the C -SSRS after a short training session. I t takes 
approximately  5 minutes to administer and rate the C- SSRS. At a minimum, the interview 
consists of 2 screening questions related to suicidal ideation and 4 related to suicidal 
behavior, and ma y be expanded to up to 17 items in case of positive responses. Freetext 
entries are allowed; the investigator has to directly evaluate the scale and write a report.
All C -SSRS reports of suicidal ideation ty pe [ADDRESS_97123] be reported as separate SAEs b y the investigator.
For ‘Self -
injurious behavior, no suicidal intent’ standard AE/SAE reporting rules are to be 
applied.
For each report of suicidal ideation ty pe 1, [ADDRESS_97124] be reported accordingl y.Please note that AEs, that get
coded to terms like su icidal depression, suicidal ideation, suicidal threat or similar, are on the 
“Alway s serious AE L ist” and therefore must be report ed as SAEs (refer to section [IP_ADDRESS].3).
Any lifetime history  of suicidal ideation , self -injurious behavior, no suicidal intent’ or 
suicidal behavior at the sc
reening visit that is not an exclusion criterion, should be considered
as bas eline condition/medical history .

laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether considered related or not.
The followin g should also be recorded as an AE in the CRF and BI SAE form (if applicable):
Worsening of the underly ing disease or of other pre -existing conditions Changes in 
vital signs, ECG, phy sical examination and laboratory  test results, if they  are judged 
clinically  relevant by  [CONTACT_88832] ,they will be considered as baseline 
conditions and should be collected in the eCRF only.
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Serious adverse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an y AE ,which fulfils at least one of the 
following criteria :
-results in death,
-is life -threatening, which refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hy pothetically  might have 
caused death if more severe,
-requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15574]
- results in persistent or signif icant disability  or incapacity ,
-is a c ongenital anomal y /birth defect,
-is deemed serious for any other reason if it is an important medical event when based 
on appropriate medical judg ement which may  jeopard isethe patient and may  require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
above definitions. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  
room or at home for allergic bronch ospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_88796]. 
[IP_ADDRESS].3 AEs considered “Alway s Serious”
In accordance with the European Medicines Agency  (EMA) initiative on Important Medical 
Events, Boehringer Ingelheim has set up a list of AEs, which by  [CONTACT_15623], can alway s be 
considered to be “serious” even though they  may  not have met the criteria of an SAE as 
defined above.
The latest list of “Alway s Serious AEs” can be found in the eDC sy stem. A copy  of the latest 
list of “Alway s Serious AEs” will be provided upon request. These events should alway s be 
reported as SAEs as described in section [IP_ADDRESS].
Cancers of new histology and exacerbations of existing cancer must be classified as a serious 
event regardless of the time since discontinuation of the drug and must be reported as 
described in [IP_ADDRESS], subsections “AE Collection” and “AE reporting to sponsor and 
timelines”.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_97127] -03(19.0) /Saved on:05Nov [ZIP_CODE].[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse events of special interest
The term adverse events of special interest (AESI) relates to an y specific AE that has been 
identified at the project level as being of particular concern for prospective safet y monitoring 
and safet y assessment within this trial, e.g. the potential for AEs based on knowledge from 
other compounds in the same class. AESIs need to be reported to the sponsor’s 
Pharmacovigilance Department within the same timeframe that applies to SAEs, please see 
section [IP_ADDRESS].2.
The following are considered as AESIs:
Hepatic injury
A hepatic injury  is defined by  [CONTACT_716] a lterations of hepatic laboratory  parameters:
an elevation of AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase) and/or ALT (Alanine 
Aminotransferase) ≥[ADDRESS_97128] combined with an elevation of total bilirubin ≥2-fold 
ULN measured in the same blood draw sample, or
aminotransf erase (ALT, and/or AST) elevations ≥10-fold ULN.
These lab findings constitute a hepatic injury  alert and the patient s showing these lab 
abnormalities need to be followed up according to the “DILI checklist” provided in the 
ISF.
In case of clinical symptoms of hepatic injury  (icterus, unexplained encephalopathy , 
unexplained coagulopathy , right upper quadrant abdominal pain, etc.) without lab results 
(ALT, AST, total bilirubin) available, the investigator should make sure these parameters are 
analysed, if necessary  in an unscheduled blood test. Should the results meet the criteria of 
hepatic injury  alert, the procedures described in the DILI checklist should be followed .
No other AESIs have been defined for this trial.
[IP_ADDRESS].5 Intensit y (severit y) of AEs
The intensity  (severit y) of the AE should be judged based on the following:
Mild: Awareness of sign(s) or sy mptom(s) that is / are easily  tolerated .
Moderate: Sufficient 
discomfort to cause interference with usual activity .
Severe: Incapacitating or causing inability  to work or to perform usual activities .
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_97129] that there is a reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship 
could be :
The event is consistent with the known pharmacology  of the trial drug.
The event is known to be caused b y or attributed to the drug class.

Evidence that the event is reproducible when the drug is re- introduced.
No medicall y sound alternative aetiologies that could explain the event (e.g. pre -
existing or concomitant diseases, or co -medications).
The event is t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y drug-related and infrequent in the general population not 
exposed to drugs (e.g. Stevens- Johnson sy ndrome).
An indication of dose -response (i.e. greater effect size (ES) if the dose is increased, 
smaller effect size if dose is reduced ).
Arguments that may  suggest that there is no reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship 
could be:
No plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure is evident 
(e.g. pre -treatment cases, diagnosis of cancer or chronic disease within days /week s 
of drug administration; an allergic reaction weeks after discontinuation of the trial 
drug concerned) .
Continuation of the event despi[INVESTIGATOR_15576], taking into 
account the pharmacological properties of the compound (e.g. after 5 ha lf-lives).
Of note, this criterion may not be applicable to events whose time course is prolonged 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_15577].
There is an alternative explanation , e.g. situations where other drugs or underly ing 
diseases appear to provide a more likely explanation for the observed event than the 
drug concerned.
Disappearance of the event even though the trialdrug treatment continues or remains 
unchanged.

In the event of force majeure or other disruptive circumstances (e.g. pandemic, war) the 
investigational plan as per this clinical trial protocol may  not be feasible at a site. With the 
consent of the patient, sponsor and investigator may agree on alternat ive, back- up or rescue 
methodology .
The implementation of these measures will depend on patient’s consent, operational 
feasibility , local law and regulations. If alternative methodology  is implemented, the 
deviations from the original plan will be precisel y documented.
6.[ADDRESS_97146] to adhere to the visit schedule as specified in the Flow Chart 1 and Flow 
Chart 2. Each visit date (with its window) is to be counted from Day  1. If any  visit has to be 
rescheduled, subsequent visits should follow the original visit date schedule. Additional visits 
for the purpose of re -testing of laboratory  parameters or AE monitoring may  be included as 
deemed necessary  by [CONTACT_093].
During the COVID -19 pandemic, there might be situations when patients might not be able to 
come to the site for the scheduled visit. This might be e.g. due to restrictions set by  
[CONTACT_15628]/institution, because the patient is quaranti ned, or 
because of an y patient-specific situation that the investigator judges as being not safe for the 
patient to come to the site. 
For details on potential modifications of the trial conduct related to the COVID -[ADDRESS_97147] of the PTSD assessments need to be followed:
•The site staff must be properly
 trained on all trial procedures and training documentation 
filed in the I SF.
•At all visits, following screening, it must be reiterated that WOCBP must  use the 
appropriate methods of contraception.
•Qualification, training, remediation (if needed) and central reading of the scales will be 
provided b y a specialized vendor. The training standards and standards for the conduct of 
the assessments will be defined for each assessment individually  and can be found in the 
ISF; It is the responsibility  of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_88797] g by [CONTACT_55899] (please also refer to section 5.3).

SAMPLE SIZE
7.1 NULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES
This trial is designed to assess the effects of BI 1358894 and placebo on patients with PTSD. 
There will be no formal hy pothesis testing performed. I nference concerning the efficacy  of 
BI1358894 will be assessed based on the estimated mean difference(s) between the treatment 
and placebo arm on the change from baseline to Week 8 in CAPS -5 total score, as well as 
other efficacy  endpoints.
7.2 PLANNED ANALYSES
7.2.1 General considerations
The following patient analysis sets are defined for this trial:
Full Anal ysis Set (FAS): includes all randomized patients who received at least one 
dose of trial medication during the trial and had a baseline and at least one post -
baseline observation for the primary  or secondary  endpoints. The FAS is used for 
efficacy analyses and patients in FAS are anal ysed under the randomized trial 
medication . 
Treated Set (TS): includes all patients who signed informed consent and were treated 
with at least one dose of the trial medication. Patients in TS are anal yzed under the 
actual trial medication received at randomization. The TS is used for safet y anal yses 
as well as demographics and baseline characteristics.
Data from patients who were screened but not randomized will be listed but not included in 
any summary  or inferential statistics.
In general, baseline values are the last measurements taken prior to the first administration of 
trial medication at randomization (Visit 2), (see Flow Chart 1). Further details (e.g., the 
handling of randomized patients that receive the wrong treatment ) will be provided in the 
TSAP.
7.2.2 Handling of Intercurrent Events
Inthe analyses of the primary  endpoint, the following intercurrent events (ICEs) are of 
interest:
1.Change in background CNS active medication (e.g., non-SSRI antidepressant, 
anxioly tics)
2.Change in pharmacological therap y (SSRI )
3.Change indrug testresult from negative to positive (Cannabis, Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] , 
Barbiturates, Opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], Cocaine, Amphetamines, Methadone, PCP)
4.Change in non -pharmacological th erapy –trauma -focused ps ychotherap y

are not considered to be part of the treatment effect of interest
. ICEs are therefore handled b ya 
hybrid estimand that combines the treatment policy  and hy pothetical approaches, where ICEs 
1-5are handled using the treatment policy  approach, and measurements taken after the 
occurrences of these ICEs are included in the primar y analysis
;ICEs 6-9are handled using the 
hypothetical approach ,andmeasurements after the iroccurrences are 
therefore censored inthe

7.2.3 Primary objective 
analyses
The primary  anal ysis of the primary  efficacy  endpoint uses the Full Anal ysis Set. I ntercurrent 
events are handled as specified in Section 7.2.2 above and missing data as a result from the 
strategy  (including both actual missing outcomes and excluded outcomes) will be handled 
using a mixed effects model with repeated measures (MMRM) under the assumption of 
missing at random (MAR) . For change from baseline to Week 8 in CAPS -5 total score, a 
restricted maximum likelihood (REML ) based approach using MMRM will be conducted to 
compare the adjusted mean between BI 1358894 125mg QD vs. placebo QD. The MMRM 
includes the fixed categorical effects of treatment at each visit, fixed categorical effects of the 
stratification factor of pres ence of significant childhood trauma (y es vs. no), and the fixed 
continuous covariates of time since index event (in years) and baseline CAPS -[ADDRESS_97171] errors. The point estimates of the adjusted mean difference between 
treatment arms at each visit, together with the corresponding two -sided 95% confidence 
intervals and p -values will be presented. The p-values and 95% confidence intervals are 
considered descriptive statistics. The primary  treatment comparison will be the contrast 
between treatment and placebo at Week 8.
Procedures to follow if the MMRM analysis fails to converge will be described in the Trial 
Statistical Analy sis Plan.

DSM -
5 (PCL -5) total score at Week 8, the same strategy  for handling the intercurrent events 
in the primary  estimand analy sis and a similar MMRM analy sis used for the pri mary  efficacy  
endpoint will be conducted to obtain the adjusted mean treatment effect between BI and 
placebo in terms of change from baseline to Week 8. This MMRM model includes the 
discrete fixed effects of treatment at each visit, fixed categorical covar iate of the stratification 
factor ofpresence of significant childhood trauma (y es vs. no), and continuous fixed effects

visit. Visit will be treated as the repeated measure with an unstructured covariance structure 
to model the within -subject measurements. Subjects will be considered as a random effect. 
The primary  treatment comparison is the contrast between treatment and placebo at Week 8.
A logistic regression ad justed for treatment and stratification factor of presence of significant 
childhood trauma (yes vs. no) will be used for binary  endpoints.
7.2.6 Safety analyses
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary  for Drug Regulatory  Activities 
(Med DRA) coding dictionary . Standard BI summary  tables and listings will be produced. 
All treated patients will be included in the safet y analysis and will be summarized under the 
actual trial medication received at randomization . In general, safety  anal yseswill be 
descriptive in nature and will be based on BI standards. No h ypothesis testing is planned. 
Statistical analy sis and reporting of adverse events will concentrate on treatment -emergent 
adverse events. To this end, all adverse events occurring betw een the start of treatment and 
the end of the residual effect period will be considered ‘treatment -emergent’. The residual 
effect period is defined as [ADDRESS_97174] drug intake and d eteriorate under treatment will also be considered as 
‘treatment -emergent’.
Frequency , severit y, and causal relationship of adverse events will be tabulated b y system 
organ class and preferred term after coding according to the most updated version of the
MedDRA at the time of reporting.
Frequency  tables for all adverse events, protocol-specified adverse event of special interest 
(AESI), serious adverse event (SAE), adverse event leading to death, adverse event leading to 
discontinuation, investigator ass essed drug -related adverse event and serious related adverse 
event will be generated for treatment -emergent adverse events. In addition, summary  
statistics and descriptive anal yses will be conducted for other safet y parameters that are 
assessed using dedic ated scales, including suicidality  as assessed b y C-SSRS.

interim will be specified in a separate document. 
During the conduct of the interim anal ysis, recruitment into the trial will continue. If the trial 
is stopped at interim, there will be a final anal ysis of the complete data set that will include 
all the patients that we re enrolled during the conduct of the interim anal ysis period. In order 
to support the double -blinded conduct of the trial, the trial team will be kept blinded to the 
individual patients’ treatment group assignment at interim. A separate team will perform the 
interim analy sis. Details will be specified in 
a separate logistic plan.
More details about the interim anal ysis and final analy sis will be specified in the TSAP and 
(or) in the interim logistic plan.

consent, even for subjects who terminated trial medication prematurely . For the primary  
analysis in the primary  estimand, m issing data will not be imputed. The MMRM analy sis will 
handle missing data based on a likelihood method under the “missing at random” assumption. 
Please refer to section 3.3.4 for patient retention strategy  to minimize missing data. For more 
details regarding missing data handling, please refer to the TSAP.
7.4 RANDOMISATION
Eligible patient s will be randomised in equal ratio to BI 1358894 125mg arm and the placebo 
arm. The randomisation will be implemented in blocks to achieve balanced allocation to each 
treatment arm. In addition, randomisation will be stratified by  [CONTACT_88841] (y es vs. no) , according to investigator´s judgement, assessed by  [CONTACT_88842]) .
The randomization will be conducted via an interactive response technology  (IRT). BI will 
arrange for the randomization and the packaging and labelling of trial medication. The 
randomization list will be generated using a validated system, which involves a
pseudorandom number generator so that the resulting treatment will be both reproducible and 
nonpredictable. The block size will be documented in the Clinical Trial Report. Access to the 
codes will be controlled and documented.
7.5 DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE
It is planned to randomize a maximum of 286 patient s in this trial, since this sample size is 
considered sufficient to provide a reasonable chance to achieve the aims of this trial (Please 
refer to Table 7.5: 1 for more details). Assuming an earl y stud y drop -out rate of 30%, this is 
equivalent to a total of [ADDRESS_97179] when the 120th
evaluable patient (about 172 pati ents randomized, assuming an earl y drop -out rate of 30%) 
has completed the 8 -week treatment duration. If the trial is not stopped at interim, then 
patient enrolment will continue to the pre -planned maximum of 286 patient s (200 evaluable 
patients).

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_97180] -03(19.0) /Saved on:05Nov 2020The sa mple size calculation is based on a target SES of BI [ADDRESS_97181] that an 
estimated standardized ES around 0.38 
–0.53 could be expected (assuming equal varia nces 
of the treatment and the placebo groups) [ R21-1623] . The assumed SES of 0.35 is based on 
the expectation that BI 1358894 has competitive efficacy  with other drugs under 
development.
Based on these sample sizes, the probabilities of observing a (1) ES >= 0.5 at interim, and (2) 
ES <0.5 at interim, and ES < 0.25, between 0.25 and 0.32, or >= 0.32 at the final stage with 
200 evaluable patients are presented in Table 7.5: 1. The estimated ES is between treatment 
and placebo on the change from baseline to Week 8 in CAPS- 5 total score. In addition, the 
overall probability of observing an ES >=0.[ADDRESS_97182] 
0.32 at the final stage are presented in Table 7.5: 1.
Table 7.5: 1 Probabilities of observing a standardized ES at different stages of the study  for 
treatment relative to placebo under different scenarios (60 and 100

P(obs SES < 0.5 at interim & 
final obs ES < 0.25)0.024 0.066 0.230 0.488 0.755 0.854

interim or observed SES >

The calculation was performed using R studio version 3.5.1, based on [ZIP_CODE] simulations.
Hence, under the trul y positive scenario of true standardized ES = 0.53, the probability  of 
observing ES >= 0.5 at interim is 57.9%, and the probability  of observing a standardized ES 
>= 0.5 at interim, or observing a standardized ES >= 0.32 at the final anal ysis stage is 93.5%. 
Assuming the true standardized effect size is 0.35, there is a 20.4% probability  to observe a 
stand
ardized ES between the treatment and placebo arm to be >= 0.5 at interim, and an 
overall 59.9% probability  to observe a standardized ES >= 0.[ADDRESS_97183] 0.32 at the final anal ysis stage. And an overall 77% prob ability  to 
observe a standardized ES >= 0.[ADDRESS_97184] 0.25

only 0.1, there is an 85.4% probability  of observing an E S < 0.5 at interim and observing an 
ES < 0.25 at the final analy sis stage. And the overall probability  of observing a standardized 
ES >= 0.5 at interim or observing a standardized ES >= 0.32 at the final analy sis stage is 
6.3%.

8.3.1 Source documents
In accordance with regulatory  requirements, the investigator should prepare and maintain 
adequate and accurate source documents and trialrecords that include all observations and 
other data pertinent to the investigation on each trialpatient . Source data as well as reported 
data should follow the “AL COA principles” and be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, 
original and a ccurate. Chan ges to the data should be traceable (audit trail).
Data reported on the CRF must be consistent with the source data or the discrepancies must 
be explained.
Electronic records, i.e., c linician administered assessment data , related audio recordings (for 
central review) and patient reported outcome data entered into the tablet computer (Rater

The electronic version of the ECG is regarded as source data. Dated and signed printouts will
be stored in the patient’s medical file.
The current medical history  of the patient may not be sufficient to confirm eligibility  for the 
trialand the 
investigator may need to request previous medical histories and evidence of any  
diagnostic tests. In this case ,the investigator must make at least one documented attempt to 
retrieve previous medical records. If this fails ,a verbal history  from the patient, documented 
in their medical records, would be acceptable.

Under these circumstances, the below modifications can be considered. 
Safety  lab, other laboratory  tests
If taking blood samples for central lab is not possible, blood anal ysis for safety  lab can be 
done in a local lab. The results of the lab tests are to be reported and transferred to the 
investigator, who has to ensure medical review and proper documentatio n. 
Safety  lab parameters should at least include liver enzy mes and Bilirubin, haematology  
including differential test, blood glucose, sodium, potassium, creatinine, urea (BUN) and 
eGFR. It is important that alway s the reference values of the local lab ar e also provided. 
Dispensation of Trial medication (IMP)
If a participant is not able to come to visit 4, visit [ADDRESS_97207] for participant to continue with I MP, IMP can be shipped 
from si te directl y to the participant (if legally acceptable according to local regulations).
If home visits by  [CONTACT_15644] e.g. “Home Healthcare Nurse” are possible, further 
assessments can be done like e.g. vital sign s, blood draw for safety  lab and biomarkers as 
well as collection of urine samples to be sent to central lab, or compliance check.

In one completed pi[INVESTIGATOR_88779] o-fetal

embry o-fetal development toxicity  was 
identified (decreased number of implantations, 
increased number of early resorptions, 
decreased fetal weight, skeletal malformations) 
at relevant human exposure levels. Maternal 
toxicity  was not seen at human relevant doses. 
The NOAEL shows that the findings are 
relevant for the maximum dose (125 mg once 
daily ) tested in the ongoing clinical trials.
Therefore, a risk for teratogenicity  in humans 
cannot be excluded. To mitigate this risk, 
women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) 
who are heterosexually  active must agree and 
adhere to contra ceptive measures consisting of 
one highl y effective method of birth control 
per ICH M3 (R2) that results in a low failure 
rate of less than 1% plus one additional barrier 
method during the treatment and follow-up

EVIDENCE Study                                                                                                                        PI: [INVESTIGATOR_16102] [ADDRESS_15383] on  peripheral resistance, which is increased in individuals with endothelial 
(vascular) dysfunction  [1-3].  Recently, n ebivolol, a third generation β -blocker, 
was approved for use in the [LOCATION_002].   
 Nebivolol is a highly selective β
1-blocker with vasodilating effects that reduce 
peripheral  resistance.  Vasodilation is mediated by [CONTACT_16118]’s action at multiple 
points in the nitric oxide (NO) pathway  [4].  The NO -mediated vasodilation of 
nebivolol is novel among β -blockers and is particularly promising as impaired 
vascular function in patients with cardiovascular disease may be due in part to 
decreased endothelial NO bioavailability  [5].  Studies in patients with 
hypertension and/or coronary artery disease have shown that nebivolol improves endothelial function while non-vaso dilating  β-blockers do not  [6, 7] .  The efficacy 
of nebivolol on endothelial function in low to moderate  risk populations has not 
been well documented.  
 
We propose to study nebivolol in subjects with early vascular  disease, using 
atenolol as an active comparator, as both drugs are selective β
1-blockers with no 
α-blocking capabilities .  These drugs differ in the fact that atenolol does not have 
vaso dilating properties  [6]. We hypothesize that  both drugs will likely lower  blood 
pressure  through β1-receptor blocking but  only nebivolol will improve impaired 
endothelial function, presumably through NO -mediated vasodilation .  A placebo 
arm will also be employed to further differentiate these two treatment strategies.  
 
2. STUDY DESIGN  
 
This is a randomized, double -blind , placebo -controlled study  comparing the 
efficacy of nebivolol and atenolol at improving small artery elasticity and reducing cardiovascular disease risk in subjects with  early vascular disease.   
Approximately 75 subjects with borderline /elevated  blood pressures and impaired 
endothelial function, as measured by [CONTACT_16119], will be recruited and assigned to treatment groups using a block randomization scheme.  Patients 
will be randomly allocated to nebivolol , atenolol or placebo, and then followed for 
9 months.   
3. METHODOLOGY  
 The Rasmussen Disease Score (RDS)  test panel is the chosen methodology  for 
this study.  The 10 parameters of the RDS were selected because of their ability 
EVIDENCE Study                                                                                                                        PI: [INVESTIGATOR_16102] 5 of 19 5 to quantify early structural and functional abnormalities  in the vasculature and left 
ventricle which appear long before cardiovascular disease  is present  [8].   
 
The RDS tests include: large and small artery elasticity (measured by [CONTACT_16117]), resting blood pressure, mild treadmill exercise test, carotid 
IMT, left ventricle mass, ECG, retinal vasculature evaluation, as well as quantification of serum NT-proBNP, and microalbuminuria.   Please see Section 8 
for a more detailed description of these parameters.   Quantitative r esults from 
these tests are converted into categorical classifications based on values 
stratified by [CONTACT_16120].  The categorical data is scored  as 
follows: normal = 0 points, borderline = 1 point, abnormal = 2 points.  Point 
values from all parameters are summed to create the RDS , with values ranging 
from 0 -20.  Scores of 0- 2 are classified as normal, 3- 5 as early disease, and 6+ 
as advanced disease.   Previous research has shown that the RDS  is a powerful 
predictor of future cardiovascular events  [9].   
 
The small artery elasticity (C
2) parameter is of particular interest as it is 
responsive to changes in NO levels [10] and is an effective and reliable predictor 
of future hypertension [11]  and other cardiovascular events [12] .  Changes in C [ADDRESS_15384] found significant improvem ents 
in C2 values [13, 14] . 
 
Brachial artery flow -mediated dilation (FMD) measurements will also be 
measured as an index of  endothelial function [15], although this method appears 
to be less sensitive to functional changes related to NO bioavailability than  C2 
[10].  Utilizing both FMD and C [ADDRESS_15385] improvement in left ventricle (LV) mass values.  LV mass 
measurements  are a critical  component of  a comprehensive assessment of 
cardiovascular health and have improved within this temporal window as a result of anti -hypertensive intervention [14, 16] .  
 
4. OBJECTIVES 
4.1. Primary Objective  
This study will compare the effects of neb ivolol against atenolol and  
placebo on endothelial function.   Endothelial function will be measured by 
[CONTACT_16121] a 9 month study period.  
 
EVIDENCE Study                                                                                                                        PI: [INVESTIGATOR_16102] 6 of 19 6 4.2. Secondary Objectives  
4.2.1  Evaluate the effects of nebivolol as compared to atenolol and 
placebo on c ardiovascular health in subjects with early vascular 
disease as measured by [CONTACT_16122] 
(RDS) over a 9 month study period.  
 
4.2.2  Evaluate changes in each RDS component  over the 9 month study 
period in all treatment groups.  
 
4.2.3  Evaluate the changes in risk factor and biomarker measurements 
from baseline to 3 and 9 month time points in all treatment groups.  
 
4.2.4  Compare the sensitivity of pulse contour analysis and flow -

5. SELECTION OF PATIENTS  
 
Study entry is open to patients regardless of gender or ethnic background.   
Patients will be recruited from the Rasmussen Center for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention at the University of  Minnesota, Fairview Clinics, and through 
advertisements or  flyers posted at the University of Minnesota and surrounding 
communities.    
 
5.1 Inclusion criteria 
 Males and females 18-80 years of age  
 Borderline blood pressure (120 -145/80-90 mm Hg ) 
 Borderline or abnormal small artery elasticity (C
2) as measured 
by [CONTACT_16123]   
 Treatment -naïve for all blood pressure medications including 
diuretics for at least 30 days prior to baseline visit  
 Able to walk on a treadmill for 3 minutes  
 Female patients with reproductive potential must use an 
approved contraceptive method if appropriate (for example, 
intrauterine device [IUD], birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], or barrier device) 
during and for [ADDRESS_15386] dose of study  drug.   
 Voluntary written informed consent before performance of any study -related procedure not part of normal medical care, with 
the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by [CONTACT_16124].  
 
EVIDENCE Study                                                                                                                        PI: [INVESTIGATOR_16102] 7 of 19 7 5.2 Exclusion criteria 
 History of intolerance to β -blockers or clear contraindications to 
their use  
 Current pharmaceutical treatment of blood pressure  
 Known history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, 
coronary artery by[CONTACT_9292], unstable angina, uncontrolled 
arrhythmias, stroke, etc.)  
 Known history of diabetes  
 Known history of hepatic, renal, or gastrointestinal disorder  
 Known history of any illness that may cause additional risk (as determined by [CONTACT_16125])  
 Pregnant or lactating women.  When used during pregnancy,  β-
blockers may cause fetal harm . 
 Participation in a concomitant clinical trial  
5.3 Concomitant Therapy  
Concomitant medications may include aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], 
lipid lowering agents, anti -platelet medications, psychotropic 
agents, vitamins or warfarin.  The following medications may not be taken during the trial:  
 
 Anti-hypertensive medications  
 Vasoactive medications  
 Cardiac medications  (including ß -blockers) 
 Since statins are known to positively influence arterial elasticity, it is 
necessary to control their use.  Any study subject taking statins 
must be on a stable dose for 8 weeks prior to the baseline visit.  
This time window was chosen based on a previous study 
examining the effects of statin combined with an anti -hypertensive 
medication on C
2 [13].  There was not a significant improvement in 
C2 between the 8 week and 28 week time points in the groups 
receiving a statin.   
 
Subjects will be instructed to maintain their established statin regimen throughout the duration of the study.    
 
6. RANDOMIZATION PROCEDURES  
Randomization will occur after informed consent has been obtained and after 
eligibility is confirmed  by [CONTACT_16126].   
Two 1:1:[ADDRESS_15387] s (one for subjects taking a statin and one for 
subjects without statin therapy ) generated by [CONTACT_16127] a study arm  at the time of enrollment.   This 
method will allow stratification of statin therapy.  
 
EVIDENCE Study                                                                                                                        PI: [INVESTIGATOR_16102] [ADDRESS_15388] month.  At the 1 month visit, atenolol will be 
increased to 50 mg per day and will be taken for up to 8 months . 
 Placebo  will be taken in the same manner as nebivolol and 
atenolol treatment groups.   
 
Patients will return to clinic at 1, 3, 6 and 9 months (+/ - 1 week) for 
evaluation and a compliance check.   
 
Patients will be instructed to return all study drug bottles and any 
remaining tablets to each appointment where subject compliance 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_16128].   
 Patients  who demonstrate non- compliance during the study will be 
counseled regarding proper administration of study medication.  In cases of continued and/or extreme non- compliance, study 
participation may be discontinued.   
 
7.2 Dose Modification  
 If subjects develop i ntolerable side effects during the study, the 
investigator may down- titrate to the starting dose with patient 
permission.  
 
7.3 Study Drug Dispensing  
Study medications and placebos will be dispensed by [CONTACT_16129], Fairview Investigational Drug Service 
(IDS)  according to the specified blinded randomization protocol at  
the baseline, 1 month, 3 month and 6 month visits.  Study patients

patient s only in case of an emergency where the further treatment 
of the patient is dependent upon knowing the study medication that 
the patient has been receiving.  In the event of pregnancy, the 
patient’s treatment assignment will  be unblinded due to the 
potential effect of active medication on the developi[INVESTIGATOR_16103].  
 
7.5 Supportive Care Guidelines  
All supportive measures consistent with optimal patient care will be 
given throughout the study.  
 
7.6 Duration of Therapy  
Patients will  receive protocol therapy for 9 months unless any of the 
following occurs:  
 Patient withdraws consent,  
 C ontinued and/or extreme non- compliance, 
 Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of study 
drugs , 
 Study physician feels study treatment is not in  the best interest 
of the patient,  
 Unacceptable adverse events(s) . 
 
7.7 Follow -up 
Subjects not experiencing adverse events will be considered completed at the 9 month study visit.  For patients experiencing 
adverse events or if treatment related toxicity is pr esent at t he final  
visit, an additional follow -up visit will occur in 30 days (± one week).  
Patients may continue on treatment beyond study  using 
commercially available drug(s) at the discretion of the treating physician; however drug assignment will not be unblinded until the 
last patient completes study drug treatment.

8.2 Description of Study Parameters 
 
Resting Blood Pressure:  Sitting blood pressure (BP) is meas ured 
by [CONTACT_16130].   Blood pressure will be 
measured [ADDRESS_15391] average will be used to obtain future  resting blood pressure 
values .  
EVIDENCE Study                                                                                                                        PI: [INVESTIGATOR_16102] 11 of 19 11  
Small and Large Artery Elasticity:  Radial artery pulse waves are 
registered with the CV Profiler (Hypertension Diagnostics, Eagan, 
Minnesota). Small artery (C 2) and large artery (C 1) elasticity are 
derived from the pulse contour analysis.  
 
Treadmill Exercise Test:  
Standing blood pressure is measured before exercise, at the end of 
a 3-minute workload at 5 METS on the basis of a treadmill speed of 
2.3 mph at a slope of 7%, and after a 1 -minute recovery period.  
 
Carotid Intimal -Media Thickness:  Ultrasound with a Sonosite 
MicroMaxx unit  is employed to measure intimal- media thickness 1 
cm distal to the carotid bulb and to identify localized carotid 
plaques.  
 
Electrocardiogram:  A standard 12 -lead electrocardiogram is 
evaluated for evidence of hypertrophy, repolarization abnormalities, 
or conduction abnormalities . 
 
Left Ventricular Mass Index:  Left ventricular (LV) ultrasound is 
performed with Sonosite ultrasound equipment, and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) is  calculated according the formula of Devereux.  
 
Optic Fundus Photo:  A retinal photo of each eye will be acquired 
using a digital camera.  Each photo will be used to measure and record vascular structure in the retina.  
 
Flow -Mediated Dilation:   Endothelium -dependent flow -mediated 
dilation (FMD) of the right brachial artery will be measured using a SonoSite MicroMaxx ultrasound unit.  Reactive hyperemia will be 
induced by [CONTACT_16131] a blood pressure cuff on the forearm for 5 
minutes.  The brachial artery will be scanned continuously  in M-
mode 30s before and 90s after cuff deflation.  These recorded 
images will be used to obtain artery diameter measurements and 
compared to a scan taken during resting conditions.  This procedure will be repeated after a 10 minute recovery  period and 
the measurements will be averaged. 
 
Blood and Urine Analysis:  Blood and urine samples will be tested 
by [CONTACT_16132].  
Fairview Labs normal and abnormal test ranges will be used to 
evaluate test results.  
 
Physical Examination : A study physician will perform a standard 
physical examin ation to assess the general health of the subject.  
EVIDENCE Study                                                                                                                        PI: [INVESTIGATOR_16102] 12 of 19 12  
Medical History:   Each subject will be asked questions pertaining 
to their own and familial medical history.  Special care will be used 
to collect any information related to cardiovascular events  and ris k 
factors .

10.1 Definitions  
Federal regulations [45CFR46.103(b)(5) and 21CFR56.108(b)(1)] require the IRB to ensure that researchers promptly report “any 
unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others” 
(UPI[INVESTIGATOR_16104]).  The IRB defines a UPI[INVESTIGATOR_16105], reflects new and increased risk to the subjects, and 
was possibly related to the research procedures . 
 
 
Problems/events that are unanticipated and involve new or 
increased risk to subjects should be reported only if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_16106], probably or definitely

10.4 Events Not  Requiring Reporting Until Time Of Annual Review   
Those unanticipated problems/events  that reflect new or increased 
risk to the subjects  that the local investigator deems unlikely or not 
related to the research procedure DO NOT meet the IRB’s definition of UPI[INVESTIGATOR_16111] 
(using a table or spreadsheet) only at the time of IRB continuing 
review.  Accompanying documentation (sponsor report forms, etc.) 
should NOT be included with this summary.  If received, such 
accompanying documentation will be returned to the investigator.

Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is one that:  
 Results in death  
 Is an immediate threat to life  
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or prolongation of existing 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
 
Causality Assessment  
For all AEs, the Investigator must provide an assessment of causal 
relationship to the IP. Causal relationship must be assessed by 
[CONTACT_16134]:  
EVIDENCE Study                                                                                                                        PI: [INVESTIGATOR_16102] 15 of 19 15 Is there a reasonable possibility the IP caused the event?  
 Yes:  There is a possible or probable relationship (ie, there 
is a reasonable or strong temporal relationship, and 
the events are unlikely to be attributable to other 
drugs, underlying diseases, or other factors). 
Dechallenge and/or rechallenge (if available) is 
positive. 
 No: The relationship is unlikely or nonexistent (ie, there is 
no strong temporal relationship and/or the use of 
other drugs, underlying diseases, or other factors 
provide plausible explanations for the event), or the 
patient did not take the IP.  
 
The Sponsor (Principal Investigator) is required to inform Forest Global Drug Safety of all SAEs. Forest Global Drug Safety must be 
notified immediately regarding any SAE that occurs after informed 
consent is obtained.  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16112] [ADDRESS_15395] transmit the SAE report form to the SAE fax 
number 
(631) 858- 7906) within [ADDRESS_15396] report every pregnancy on a pregnancy report form as soon as possible (within [ADDRESS_15397] 
awareness of the pregnancy to the pregnancy fax number, 
(631) 
858-7906), even if no AE has occurred, and follow it to term. If, 
however, the pregnancy is associated with an SAE (eg, if the mother is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16113]), in addition to the pregnancy 
report form, a separate SAE report form must be filed.

Weekly  meetings of the  study's principal investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_16114], validity and integrity of the data, enrollment rate, retention of participants, 
adherence to protocol, and data completeness.  
 
12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
This is a randomized, double- blinded, placebo -controlled Phase II study to 
obtain a preliminary estimate of the eff ects of  nebivolol compared to 
atenolol and placebo on endothelial function (measured by [CONTACT_16135]) and cardiovascular disease risk (measured by [CONTACT_16136]).  
 
12.1  Statistical Methodology  
The primary analysis of the study is descriptive, to obtain a point 
estimate and 95% confidence interval  of the difference in small 
artery elasticity (C 2) between nebivolol  and atenolol  treatment  arms  
and nebivolol and placebo at the end of the observation period ( 9 
months ). Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals for the 
improvement in C 2 within each t reatment will also be presented.  
 Secondary  analysis estimating difference in Rasmussen Disease 
Score (R DS) improvement between the nebivolol  and atenolol  
treatment groups  along with nebivolol and placebo groups at the 
end of the observation period ( 9 months ) will also be completed.  
 
Other s econdary analyses include estimates of the associations 
among changes in RDS as well as risk factor and biomarker 
measurements from baseline to the 3, and 9 month time points in 
the two positive comparator  groups.  
 
Unpaired t -tests will be used to compare the means of C 2 (small 
artery elasticity) as well as all RDS test component and biomarker 
values for each subject group at each time point.  Paired t -tests will 
be used to compare baseline values and values from subsequent time points within one group.  A P -value of < 0.05 will be 
considered statistically significant.

difference in small artery elasticity of 3.3 units (ml/mm Hg x 100) 
between positive comparators when power = 0.9 and α = 0.05.  This 
is assuming a standard deviation of ± 3.57 units.  This assumption 
is made based on a previous clinical trial measuring small artery 
elasticity in patients undergoing anti -hypertensive therapy [14] .  
 Subjects in the previous study  were not selected on the basis of C
[ADDRESS_15401] deviation will be much smaller than our 
estimate giving us a conservative population sample of 75.  
Assuming a smaller deviation of 3.0 (instead of 3.57) we would still 
have an adequate sample with a dropout rate of 7.6%.  If rates of 
attrition exceed 7.6%, subjects will be replaced 
 
 
13. ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS

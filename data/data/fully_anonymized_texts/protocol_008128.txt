Placebo Randomized Controlled Trial.

BACKGROUND & SIGNIFICANCE  
 
The reported prevalence of disproportionate pain and disability among patients 
recovering from a fracture of the distal radius varies widely, between 1% and 37% 
in published series,1-7 perhaps in part because it is poorly defined, known by [CONTACT_635804], subjective, and unverifiable. In general, ph ysicians ascribe 
disproportionate pain and disability to a poorly understood pathophysiologic 
process currently labeled “complex regional pain syndrome”, while psychologists 
understand this as ineffective copi[INVESTIGATOR_4262].8 Studies consistently identify 
psychological factors (catastrophic thinking in particular) as the most important 
determinants of pain intensity, finger stiffness, and magnitude of disability after 
distal radius fractures. 8,9  
Along these lines, it is difficult to interpret the trials su ggesting that vitamin C limits 
the occurrence of complex regional pain syndrome, given that the diagnosis is 
subjective and variably defined, and the only published trials were performed by 
[CONTACT_635805] C.6,10  We see this reflected in clinical pra ctice, as only 11% of 
the orthopaedic surgeons always prescribes vitamin C after a distal radius fracture, 
making it one of the least adhered to recommendations of the AAOS clinical practice 
guidelines.11. In addition, there is a lack of clarity regarding the mechanism by [CONTACT_635806] C would decrease the incidence of complex regional pain syndrome.[ADDRESS_849623] of vitamin C after distal radius fractures on objective 
measurement of finger motion, patient reported outcome measures, and  pain 
intensity, instead of the previously used, subjective and imprecise Veldman criteria 
for complex regional pain syndrome13, i.e., (i) unexplained diffuse pain, or (ii) 
edema, (iii) difference in skin color, or (iv) temperature, or (v) limited active r ange 
of motion.  
 
SPECIFIC AIMS  
 
Primary null hypothesis  
There is no difference in finger stiffness  (distance to palmar crease)  between 
patients taking vitamin C or placebo  after six weeks after a distal radius fracture.  
 
Secondary null hypotheses  
There i s no difference in PROMIS upper extremity function and pain score between 
patients taking vitamin C or placebo after a distal radius fracture.  
 
[ADDRESS_849624] SELECTION  
 
Patients will be enrolled in the outpatient clinic at the Hand & Trauma Service s at 
[LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
 
Inclusion Criteria:   
 All adult (age 18 or greater) patients presenting to the Hand and Orthopaedic 
Trauma Services of the [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (MGH) within two 
weeks of a fracture of the distal radius, either operatively or nonoperatively 
treated.  
 
Exclusion criteria : 
 Patients with severe kidney failure or kidney stones, known allergy for 
vitamin C or pregnancy , or patients who are not fluent in either English or 
Spanish . 
 Wrist fracture within the last year on the newly fractured side  
 Confounders (baseline characteris tics): fracture on the dominant side, 
current vitamin C supplements.  
 
 
SUBJECT ENROLLMENT  
 
The treating surgeon  at the Hand or Orthopedic Trauma service will determine if the 
patient is eligible to participate in the study .  The surgeon  will introduce the study to 
the patient and answer any questions that the patient may have  about the study or 
about randomization . If the patient agrees to participate, a trained research 
coordinator (pre -med student) or trained research assistant (PhD or medical 
student) no t involved in clinical care, will obtain consent and begin enrollment 
procedures.  As with the other research studies in this department, there will be no 
coercion. The research coordinator or research assistant will explain to the patient 
that participati on in this study is completely voluntary and that the patient may 
withdraw at any time. The research coordinator or research assistant will offer all 
subjects the opportunity to speak with a licensed physician Investigator during the 
consent process.  
Subje cts will be given a copy of the informed consent form, and be informed 
that their participation is voluntary and that they can withdraw at any time during 
the study.  Subjects make take as long as they like to consider participation, 
provided they still me et all enrollment criteria.  
Study staff will provide the patient with a box of medication, containing 
either vitamin C or placebo (both completely similar in appearance, taste and smell).  
The pharmacist involved in preparing the placebo will randomize the boxes of 
medication according to a list of generated random numbers (Stata 13). The 
[ADDRESS_849625] will be the only person with access to the code until conclusion of the 
trial.  
 
STUDY PROCEDURES  
 
 
Eligible patient, after informed consent, will be randomly assigned , double -blind,  to 
take either placebo or vitamin C 500 mg for 6 weeks.  
At enrollment and 6 weeks (5 -8 weeks acceptable) after fracture we will measure: 
DPC (dig II -V), PROMIS UE CAT, PROMIS pain interference and VAS score; all 
questionnaires will  be filled out in REDCap .  If the researcher misses the subject at 
the [ADDRESS_849626] each patient via email and via telephone to 
complete the 6 week fol low-up questionnaires.  To address, one of the secondary 
hypotheses, patients will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]  6 months after injury  by [CONTACT_6968]; unresponsive 
patients will be contact[CONTACT_635807].  Three attempts will be m ade to contact [CONTACT_635808] -up. 
 
Measured variables  
At enrollment and 6 weeks (5 to 8 weeks acceptable) after fracture:  
 Finger tip distance to palmar crease of fingers II -V (DPC)  
 PROMIS Upper Extremity Function ( Short form ) 
 PROMIS Pain Interference Short form  
 0-10 ordinal rating of pain intensity  
 
At 6 months (5 to 8 months acceptable) after fracture:  
 PROMIS UE – Short form  
 0-[ADDRESS_849627] size of similar magnitude to previous studies10, power analysis 
suggests 134 patients provide 80% power to detect a difference with an alpha of 
0.05 (effect size 0.50, two tailed Wilcoxon -Mann -Whitney test). As trauma patients 
are notoriously hard to track, halfway through the study we will assess enro llment 
and adjust sample size accordingly to account for lost to follow -up. 
 
RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS  
 
Although controversy exists regarding the value of prescribing vitamin C to patients 
with distal radius fractures, there appears to be limited downside with  its use. 
[ADDRESS_849628] will be inconvenienced by [CONTACT_635809] a nd physical examination (about 2 0 minutes).  
 
POTENTIAL BENEFIT  
 
There may or may not be any direct benefits to the individual subjects. Subjects may 
benefit from the Vi tamin C treatment by [CONTACT_635810]. It is also possible that the subjects will not directly benefit from the 
treatment, and will recover from their injury as they would under the standard of 
care treatment outside o f this research. Either outcome will contribute to the 
understanding of the role of vitamin C in the healing of distal radius fractures.  
 
MONITORING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
 
Any adverse events will be recorded by a full time research coordinator involved in  
this project and discus sed with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_97318].  An overview of all adverse 
events will be discussed at th e monthly research meeting at which the PI [INVESTIGATOR_635802]/stop the trial.   
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_635803]. The research coordinator has an assistive role and will monitor 
outcomes on a daily basis. The research coordinator will have an assistive role and  
will be responsible for monitoring outcomes  on a daily basis and the research 
coordinator will discuss all outcomes with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a monthly basis at the research 
meeting.  No independent monitoring will occur.  All investigators and study staff will 
be responsible for reporting adverse effect s to the research coordinator. Should any 
adverse events occur, the research coordinator will report such events to the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_97318] .  The research coordinator will report adverse events to the IRB in 
accordance with the IRB adverse event reporting procedures.  
 
There will be a full -time research coordinator responsible for adherence to all IRB 
rules and guidelines and for the accuracy and completeness of all forms, entries, and 
[ADDRESS_849629] access.  
 
All participants are given a participation number/code at the time of enrollment 
matching with their received medication  box.  This code is kept on all data sheets 
instead of the patient name.  Subject information is only accessible by [CONTACT_635811].   The final 
results after statistical analysis will not be shared w ith the any institution.

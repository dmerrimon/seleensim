Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE): A novel technique for spi[INVESTIGATOR_822432]  
 
I.3 Short Title  (optional):

DO NOT cut and paste  technical  abstracts  from  funding  applications  that may not be understood  by 
a general  audience.  
The aim of this prospective  observational  study  is to assess  whether  transesophageal  echocardiography  (TEE)  can be 
used to identify the structures within the vertebral foramen of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_822433]. Data will be collected from both pediatric and adult patients undergoing 
cardiothoracic and interven tional cardiac surgeries under general anesthesia. Because use of TEE is a standard 
surgical procedure and because TEE will already be in place to visualize the heart, no additional processes will be 
required  to collect  data, minimizing  patient  risk. TEE will be monitored  and controlled  by a trained  anesthesiologist  or 
TEE technician  and visualization  of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_822434].  Real-time TEE images  will then be captured  and 
later graded by a trained sonographer as high, medium or low quality. Starting at the level of the tracheal 
bifurcation,  corresponding  to thoracic  vertebral  level T5 (Mirajalili  2012),  the TEE probe  will be advanced  cranially  to 
determine the spi[INVESTIGATOR_822435] T5 and caudally in order to determine the spi[INVESTIGATOR_822436] T5 that 
can be seen on TEE. At  each level seen on TEE,  pi[INVESTIGATOR_822437].  
 
I.5 Specify  your research  question(s),  study  aims  or hypotheses  (do not indicate  "see protocol")  
The primary  outcome  is to identify  the spi[INVESTIGATOR_822438]-time TEE image,  as well as to 
determine the range of spi[INVESTIGATOR_822439]. 
The secondary  outcomes  include  classification  of the captured  TEE image  as high, medium  or low quality  as 
determined by a trained  sonographer.  
H0: The null hypothesis is that the spi[INVESTIGATOR_822440] -time TEE image. 
H1: The alternative  hypothesis  is that the spi[INVESTIGATOR_822441]-time 
TEE image in all  individuals.  
To test this hypothesis,  both pediatric  and adult patients  undergoing  cardiothoracic  or interventional  cardiac 
surgeries under general anesthesia will be included in the study  population.  
 
I.6 Background  and significance  and/or  Preliminary  studies  related  to this project. 
(do not indicate "see  protocol")  
Transesophageal echocardiography is a semi -invasive, monitoring and analytic tool used to generate reproducible 
images  of the heart and mediastinum.  TEE is routinely  used in cardiothoracic  and interventional  surgeries  as well as 
in detecting  thromboses,  valvular  defects  and congenital  heart  disease.  There  has been expanding  utilization  of TEE 
outside  of cardiac  surgery  as a potential  haemodynamic  monitor  both intraoperatively  and postoperatively  (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_822442] 
2012). While TEE is not regularly used to visualize the spi[INVESTIGATOR_158407], it can be done with relative ease when 
consciously attempted (Chitilian 2006). To our knowledge, this prospective observational study will be the first 
attempt  to deliberately  image  the structures  within  the vertebral  foramen,  to scan the spi[INVESTIGATOR_822443] a trained  sonographer.  Given  the nearly  universal  use of TEE in cardiac 
surgical  operating  rooms,  in combination  with the low risk of complications(Daniel  1991),  potential  outcomes  include 
the use of TEE in the placement  of thoracic  epi[INVESTIGATOR_822444],  in identification  of spi[INVESTIGATOR_822445] a monitor 
of intraoperative perfusion and pressure surrounding the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831] (Godet 1994). This could lead to improved 
precision, success and safety of regional  anesthesia.

VII.B.32  Provide a summary of prior investigations with this  device.  
Transesophageal echocardiography is a semi -invasive, monitoring and analytic tool used to 
generate reproducible images of the heart and mediastinum. TEE is routinely used in 
cardiothorac ic and interventional surgeries as well as in detecting thromboses, valvular defects 
and congenital heart disease. There has been expanding utilization of TEE outside of cardiac 
surgery as a potential haemodynamic monitor both intraoperatively and postoper atively (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_822442] 
2012). While TEE is not regularly used to visualize the spi[INVESTIGATOR_158407], it can be done with relative 
ease when consciously attempted (Chitilian 2006). To our knowledge, this prospective 
observational study will be the first attempt to deli berately image the structures within the 
vertebral foramen, to scan the spi[INVESTIGATOR_822452] a trained sonographer. Given the nearly universal use of TEE in cardiac surgical 
operating rooms, in combinat ion with the low risk of complications(Daniel 1991), potential 
outcomes  include  the use of TEE in the placement  of thoracic  epi[INVESTIGATOR_822444],  in identification  of 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_822445] a monitor  of intraoperative  perfusion  and pressure  surrounding  the spi[INVESTIGATOR_36232] (Godet 1994). This could lead to improved precision, success and safety of regional 
anesthesia.

made with regard to this  device?  
Yes 
 
VII.B.34  Provide a discussion of these  reviews/determinations.  
Yes, as TEE is a standard  intraoperative  monitor,  multiple  studies  have demonstrated  a low 
rate of complications  associated  with TEE, deeming  it safe for use in surgery  (Daniel  1991).

TEE is routinely used in cardiothoracic and interventional surgeries as well as in detecting 
thromboses,  valvular  defects  and congenital  heart disease.  In this study,  TEE will not be used in a 
similar manner but to visualize the spi[INVESTIGATOR_822453]  (Chitilian  2006).  To our knowledge,  this prospective  observational  study  will 
be the first attempt to deliberately image the structures within the vertebral foramen, to scan the

In most cases we will approach the patient's guardian in the Thoracic Surgery Clinic, Pediatric Intensive Care Clinic or 
Anesthesia  Pre-Surgical  Evaluation  Clinic  at least 24 hours  before  surgery.  We will introduce  ourselves  as members  of the 
research study team. We will explain the study, including benefits and risks, to the the patient's guardian and provide 
them a copy of the consent document. Guardians will have the opport unity to ask questions and discuss the subject's 
participation  with family  or friends.  Guardians  will also receive  a copy of the consent  form to take home  with them.  
Guardians  who agree  to patient  participation  will sign the consent  document  and will be provided  with a copy of the 
consent.  The consent  document  will contain  contact  [CONTACT_822473].  
Those patients who are consented the day of surgery will have their  guardian approached by a nurse and handed a card 
which  states  that the patients  is eligible  to participate  in a research  study.  If they are interested  in participating,  a member 
of the research  team will explain  the study  to the patient.  We will explain  the study,  including  benefits  and risks,  to the the 
patient and provide them with a copy of the consent document. The guardian will have the opportunity to ask questions 
and discuss their participation with family or friends. Guardians who agree to patient  participation will sign the consent 
document  and will be provided  with a copy of the consent.  The consent  document  will contain  contact  [CONTACT_822474]. Patients will have be tween one and five 
hours  after consent  is obtained  before  their surgery.  No sedation  will be given  before  the consent  is obtained.  
For children/minors who will sign an assent document or are old enough to sign a consent document:

VII.D.36  Provide  a detailed  description  and rationale  for each  of the procedures  chosen  above  and describe  the 
child/minor populations to which they apply in y our study.  
For those children/minors who are too young (younger than 7 years old) to assent on their own or their capability is so 
limited  they cannot  reasonably  do so, their parent  or guardian  will consent  on their behalf.  All procedures  and information 
will be explained  by a member  of the research  team and all questions  will be answered  before  consent  is obtained.  
For those  children/minors  that are old enough  to sign an assent  (7-12 years  old) or consent  (>12 years  old) document, 
they will also have all procedures and information explained by a member of the research team and will be given the 
opportunity to ask questions before assent/consent is  obtained.  
 
VII.D.37  Does  the study  include  any form  of deception  (e.g.,  providing  participants  with false  information,  misleading 
information, or withholding information about certain study  procedures)?  
Examples:  
Procedure  includes  a cover  story  that provides  a plausible  but inaccurate  account  of the purposes  of the 
research.  
Participants  will be provided  with false  information  regarding  the particular  behaviors  of interest  in the 
research.  
Procedures include a confederate pretending to be another participant in the study.  
Participants  will be told that the research  inclu des completion  of a particular  task,  when  in fact, that task 
will not be  administered.  
Study  is designed  to introduce  a new procedure  (or task)  that participants  are not initially  told about. 
If yes, a waiver of informed consent must be requested under question  IV.3.  
No

What subjects will be asked to do/what happens in the study (in sequential order) 
The time per iod over which procedures will occur  
The time commitment for the subject for individual visits/procedures 
Long -term followup and how it occurs  
The subjects  of the study,  scheduled  to undergo  cardiothoracic  or interventional  cardiac  surgeries,  will only be asked  to 
come to their surgery. The day of surgery the patients will not be required to do anything different from standard 
anesthesia  and surgical  practice  at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Subjects  will come  to the operating  room suite and the usual  monitors 
(electrocardiogram, non -invasive blood pressure, and oxygen saturation) will be  placed.  
Following  the routine  induction  of anesthesia,  the Mini-Multi TEE probe  (Model  T6207  (21381A),  Philips,  Bothell,  WA, [LOCATION_003]) 
will be advanced  to mid esophageal  level in order  to visualize  the heart,  this is standard  surgical  procedure  in these  cases. 
Rotation of the probe by [CONTACT_3450] [ADDRESS_1140475] the follow ing data: height, weight, age, any known history of esophageal 
abnormalities, lesions or disease and current procedure. Ten minutes is the approximate additional time that may be 
required  intraoperatively  to observe  the spi[INVESTIGATOR_822457]. No additional visits or extra time is required of the subject. There will be no necessary 
long-term follow up or data collection. When the patient leaves the operating room,  nothing additional is  required.  
 
VII.E.[ADDRESS_1140476] to  follow -up? 
No - followup is not required in this study  
 
VII.E.9  Will subjects be provided any compensation for participating in this  study?  
No 
 
VIII.  Risks 
VIII.1  What are the risk s to subjects  including  
- emotional or  psychological  
- financial  
- legal or  social  
- physical?  
The care the patient will receive is standard practice at UIHC for thoracic or interventional cardiac surgeries and are 
necessary procedures regardless of this research study. Thus, no additional physical risk is involved. Patients may be 
under  slightly  elevated  emotional  stress  knowing  that they are part of a research  study.  There  is a very low risk of loss of 
confidentiality of the patient's medical information, yet this is unlikely as patients will be given identification numbers a t 
the earliest date pos sible and these will only be accessed by [CONTACT_8362]. Only the data necessary to 
answer the research question will be collected upon reviewing patient information. There are no other known financial, 
physical or legal risks to the  patient.  
 
VIII.[ADDRESS_1140477] you done to minimize the  risks?  
If applicable to this study ALSO include:  
How you (members  of your research  team  at Iowa)  will monitor  the safety  of individual  subjects. 
Include  a description  of the availability  of medical  or psychological  resources  that subjects  might 
require  as a consequence  of participating  in this research  and how referral  will occur  if necessary 
(e.g. availability of emergency medical care, psychological counseling,  etc.)

Healthcare professionals will monitor the subject at all times during the operation. The patient will be reassured that 
although  they are participating  in the study,  everything  that happens  during  the case is already  standard  practice  at UIHC 
for thoracic  and cardiac  surgery  patients.  All patients  will be given  an identification  number  and be referred  to by [CONTACT_88318].  To 
prevent  loss of confidentiality  of the patient's  medical  information,  we will keep all records  used for this study  in a locked 
office or on password protected computer system. Only members of the research team will have access to the records 
used in this study.  No key will be kept as patients  will not need to be contact[CONTACT_734411].

This novel confirmation method of visualizing the spi[INVESTIGATOR_822458],  vascular  events  surrounding  the spi[INVESTIGATOR_822459].  It could  also be used in thoracic  epi[INVESTIGATOR_822460]. 
 
X. Privacy &  Confidentiality  
X.[ADDRESS_1140481] the  privacy  interests of the  subjects?  
To protect  patient  privacy,  researchers  will be conducting  the consent  and study  procedures  in a private  setting.  Further, 
the research team will only be collecting the information necessary to comple te the  study.  
 
X.2 Are you collecting the Social Security Number of any subjects for any  purpose?  
No 
 
X.4 How will information/data be collected and stored for this study (check all that  apply):  
Electronic records (computer files, electronic databases, etc.) - Electronic records will be kept on the password 
protected Anesthesia department server. The members of the research team will be the only people with access to 
the files. No records will be kept on personal computers. Further, patients will be assigned a unique identification 
number. They will always be referred to by [CONTACT_9127]. The patient's hospi[INVESTIGATOR_822461], but will not be disclosed to anyone outside th e research team. We will record the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_822462]' chart later if needed. The database that contains the identifiers will be password protected so 
that the only the investigators  needing  it can access  it. No unnecessary  patien t identifiers  will be recorded,  and those 
that are needed will be deleted at the earliest possible time. Only data necessary to collect for the study will be 
recorded.

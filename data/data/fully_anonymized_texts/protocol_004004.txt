surgeon’s research staff will review the patient’ s KSS, clinical dictati on, and electronic health 
record (EHR), and he will approve or reject the patient as a candidate for the study. During 
review of medical files, the research staff w ill utilize the CMR Recruitment/Enrollment checklist 
(Attachment 6) to ensure that each potential subject meets all eligibility requirements prior to 
being contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. This sheet included a checklist of the inclusion criteria, as well as a field for the

5/3/[ADDRESS_1015848]’s eligibility can once again be 
confirmed on the day of data collection. Once this  sheet has been completed by [CONTACT_15228], it will 
be submitted to a UT Research Coordinator, lead  researcher or PI/Co-PI/Sub-I to review and 
authorize recruitment and enrollment. After a poten tially eligible subject has been identified and 
authorized to be enrolled in the study, s/he will be contact[CONTACT_5365] a visit to the surgeon’s office to 
be consented. The subject will then be consen ted and scheduled for fluoroscopy data collection 
at the Tennessee Orthopaedic Cl inic in Knoxville, TN.  All testing collecti on at Tennessee 
Orthopaedic Clinic will be schedul ed after normal clinic hours so as not to interfere with the 
patient treatments occurring during the day.  
 
Data Collection 
University of Tennessee researchers with experi ence conducting fluoroscopic research studies, as 
well as either a PI/Co-PI/Sub-I for the study, and possibly [CONTACT_743050]’ staff will be present during 
the fluoroscopy procedure to walk subjects through the activities. A radiation technician (RT) 
employed by [CONTACT_743042] w ill collect fluoroscopic video while subjects 
perform the following activities: walking up a nd down a ramp, deep knee bend and rising from 
the DKB position.  
   Prior to starting data collection, UT researcher s will complete the second portion of the CMR 
Recruitment/Enrollment checklist to ensure subjects meet elig ibility requirements to document 
inclusion criteria for compliance purposes. Age and weight will be verified at the time of 
fluoroscopy to ensure eligibility. If  a subject does not meet the inclusion criteria, s/he will not be 
tested. If the participant still m eets all study criteria, s/he will be  asked to practice the activities 
to ensure s/he can comfortably complete them and experience no pain with  the clinic fluoroscopy 
machine off (no radiation).  The practice portion of the data collection without radiation will not 
be video-recorded. During the fluoroscopy pro cedure, the RT will follow the motion of the 
implanted knee with the fluoroscopy machine;
 only the knee joint (from the fluoroscopy 
machine) will be recorded on the fluoroscopy footag e. The participant will be allowed to rest as 
necessary and be instructed  to stop the activity at th e first sign of pain.  
 Multiple trials of each activity ma y be conducted to ensure usable images have been acquired to 
complete the study. Radiation time will be kept as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) and 
will not exceed two minutes. The RT will start the fluoroscope just prior to the subject beginning 
each activity trial and will stop the fluoroscope  immediately after the subject completes each 
activity trial to ensure that the subj ect is not exposed during idol periods. 
 The fluoroscopic footage for these activities will be stored on digital video files on a secure computer workstation, uploaded onto the secure  CMR database by [CONTACT_743043], where identifiable da ta will be removed and substituted for data that 
cannot identify the subject (e.g., dates of birth will be removed and replaced with number of 
months the individual has been alive). Subjects will be assigned study and subject-specific 
identifiers which is how the system  will distinguish the datasets.   
   
SPECIFIC RISKS AND PROTECTION MEASURES 
 
1. Fluoroscopic Procedures

As with every clinical study, there may be some risks.  Ho wever, doses of radiation exposure 
received will be much lower than those known to produce detectable health effects.  Previously 
reported literature shows that fluoroscopy-ba sed procedure (angiogra phy) on the lower limb 
result in a typi[INVESTIGATOR_743035] 0.83 mSv per min (0.0083 rem per min) (Verdun1).  Mettler, 
et al have reported that the typi[INVESTIGATOR_532274] a conve ntional knee pro cedure is 0.005 mSv 
(0.[ZIP_CODE] rem)2.  According to either estimate, the a dditional risk of a fluoroscopic procedure 
involving the knee ranges between "Negligible" to "Low" for a 2 minute exam (Verdun).  A 
previous fluoroscopy TKA study conducted at anot her hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4791] a 2 minute on-time limit 
shows that the average effective dose was 0.14 mSv (0.0014 rem) with a maximum dose of 0.27 
mSv (0.0027 rem).  The additional risk for all subjects in this prev ious study would be 
considered "Negligible".  To account for subj ect variability and differences in imagining 
techniques, all subjects enrolled in this study will receive less than 4 rem.  4 rem is considered "Very Low" risk.  It is unlikely that anyone in this study will approach the [ADDRESS_1015849] for the entire experiment (Attachments 3 and 
4).  The participant's knee joint will be fluoroscoped using minimal risk levels of radiation according to published litera ture (Attachment 2).  
  The participant has the right to stop the procedure at any time; researchers or the RT can end the 
procedures at any time if they feel the participant is at risk, but the participan t can choose to 
remain in the study if she/he f eels that there is no risk to her/his surgical procedure or 
recuperation.   We are estimating a total maximum time of [ADDRESS_1015850] time to complete the IC form, ask any questions s/he may have, practic e the activities or repeat any activities that 
could not be completed, and collect all necessary fluoroscopy data from each subject.   
2. Participant Confidentiality  
The investigator will ensure subject confidentiality to the extent that is permissible by [CONTACT_532285]. Co mplete confidentiality cannot be guaranteed.

Clinical Observations: 
There are no clinical observati ons made during this data collec tion or from the images obtained 
through data collection. There will be no radiology report generated for this procedure conducted 
as a result of this study. Therefore, no RT will review such a report for the procedures, which would be the only way such a “significant problem ” would be determined. It is not anticipated 
that the imaging collected during this study would pot entially provide benefit to specific subjects 
by [CONTACT_743045]’s treatment plan.
 
 
BENEFITS 
The potential benefits from this study include, but are not limited to: 
• Better understanding of the joints analyzed  with the same technique in the past. 
• Future implant design improvements based on the kinematic findings. 
• New and advanced surgical techniqu es for TKA based on the results.

able to see their implant on the video monito r and the fluoroscopic video will be assessed 
by [CONTACT_5051].  
 
The researchers have been conducting fluoroscopi c exams for [ADDRESS_1015852] led to implant design 
improvements with the knee implant systems.  Theref ore, like those subjects who participated in 
previous studies, data from this study will lead to results that will continue to improve the longevity of future knee implants. 
 
METHODS TO OBTAIN "INFORMED CONSENT" FROM PARTICIPANTS 
Once a patient is identified as potentially e ligible by [CONTACT_11065]’s staff (TOC: [CONTACT_688584], JJ 
Campbell or Peggy Adams; Erlanger Orthopaedics - TBD), the patient’s KSS, clinical dictation, 
and EHR will be reviewed by [CONTACT_743046] a candidate 
for the study. As indicated in the Recruitment sec tion of this protocol, in order to ensure and 
document compliance of eligibility, during review of  medical files, the research staff will utilize 
the CMR Recruitment/Enrollment ch ecklist to ensure that each potential subject meets all 
eligibility requirements prior to being contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. This sheet includes a checklist of the inclusion 
criteria, as well as a field for research staff to include a subject identifier so the subject’s eligibility can once again be confirmed on the day of data collection. Once this sheet has been 
completed by [CONTACT_743047], it will be submitted to a UT Research Coordinator, 
lead researcher or PI/Co-PI/Sub-I to review a nd authorize recruitment and enrollment. After a 
potentially eligible subject has been identified and authorized to be enrolled in the study,
 the 
research staff will then contact [CONTACT_423], and if  interested, the subject will be scheduled for a 
meeting with the research staff at their office.  After a thorough explana tion of the study and the 
activities that the subject will be doing, making sure the subject has asked all questions and 
received answers, if the subject agrees to participate, s/he will sign the Informed Consent and the 
HIPAA release. A research staff member will then schedule the fluoroscopic testing session 
during after-hours at the Tenness ee Orthopaedic Clinic. These c onsent forms will be securely 
transmitted and stored at the University of Te nnessee, as well as the Research Foundation and 
Erlanger Orthopaedics and w ill be accessible by [CONTACT_532290].  
 [CONTACT_743050] nor [CONTACT_743054] will be present during the consenting process to avoid possible subject coercion to participate. Subjects may c ontact their surgeon’s o ffice with any questions 
they may have.  From previous studies, we have determined that  it takes approximately [ADDRESS_1015853] and answer any questions that s/he may have. We have also estimated approximately [ADDRESS_1015854] to practice the activities and then to actually pe rform the activities under fluoroscopic 
surveillance; actual radiation exposure will be up to, but not more than two minutes. Fluoroscopy 
on-time and any fluoroscopy unit measurements w ill be indicated on each subject’s IC/HIPAA 
form.

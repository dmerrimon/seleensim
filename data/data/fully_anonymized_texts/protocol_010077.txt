Title:  A Multicenter, Single -Treatment Study to Assess the Safety and 
Tolerability of Lyophilized L ucinactant in Adults with COVID- 19 
Associated A cute L ung Injury 
Phase:  2a 
US IND Number:  149624 
Sponsor:  Windtree Therapeutics, Inc. (Windtree) , Warrington, PA, [LOCATION_003]  
ClinicalTrials.gov No.:  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] 
Committees:  DMC  
Study Drug:  Lyophilized l ucinactant  reconstituted with sterile water for injection 
and administered  at a dose of 160 ml ( ~80 mg total phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] 
(TPL)/kg lean body weight ), delivered as a liquid . 
Rationale:  The coronavirus that was first detected in China in 2019 and which 
has been detected in over 190 countries on every continent, has 
infected over 150 million people worldwide (including approximately 
3 million deaths), including approximately 35 million in the United 
States (including over 600,000 deaths). The virus  has been named 
“SARS -CoV -2” and the disease it causes has been named 
“coronavirus disease 2019” (abbreviated “COVID -19”).  
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people 
and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, 
and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then 
spread between people such as with MERS -CoV, SARS -CoV, and

Clinical Study Protocol   Version 2.1, [ADDRESS_1167907] ant is a synthetic surfactant that is approved by [CONTACT_55257] 
(NDA 021746) for the prevention of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (RDS) in premature infants at high risk for RDS. It has been safely administered to over 1000 children and adults. Preliminary dat a from 
animal and human adult studies indicate that lucinactant could benefit those with acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS) in the context of COVID -[ADDRESS_1167908]
ant could potentially 
decrease the duration of ventilation or extracorporeal membrane 
oxygenation (ECMO).  
ARDS, as a consequence of COVID -[ADDRESS_1167909] on surfactant related lung function. SARS -
CoV -2 uses the SA RS-coronavirus receptor, angiotensin- converting 
enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entry into the host cells. ACE2 is a surface molecule on alveolar Type [ADDRESS_1167910] lung injury caused by [CONTACT_4113] -19, there is a  
subsequent damage to the lung through triggering and activation of the 
inflammatory cascad e, similar to  that involved in the development of  
Protocol 02- CL-2001a  - CONFIDENTIAL - Windtree Therapeutics, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol   Version 2.1, 18 June 2021 
 
 
Page 7 of 69  bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ). There is data supporting benefit 
of lucinactant  to decrease the incidence and severity of BPD, 
supporting the rationale for use of exogenous surfactant in the 
treatment of pulmonary disease caused by [CONTACT_4113] -19. 
Lucinactant significantly reduced mortality in a related pre -clinical 
model of H5N1 in ferrets infected with highly pathogenic avian 
influenza. Results showed 
that surfactant treatment significantly improved 
survival, as well as viral - 
and inflammation -related 
lung damage. 
 
Clinical evidence in patients with acute lung 
injury (ALI) showed potentially beneficial results in children on 
mechanical ventilation due 
to severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_4345] (RSV) infection, incl uding 
pneumonia. Many studies in clinical ARDS have substantiated that 
damage to surfactant and inadequate quantities of functioning 
surfactant contribute to the pathophysiology of ARDS. Several studies 
in adult ARDS have established that lucinactant can b e safely 
administered to critically ill patients and potentially replenish the 
surfactant pool.  
In many animal models, surfactant replacement therapy of pneumonia 
has been studied showing decreased intrapulmonary bacterial 
proliferation, decreased bacteri al growth, and improved pulmonary 
function with increased pulmonary compliance. Clinical studies of 
surfactant in subjects with pneumonia have shown improvements in 
oxygenation and mean airway pressure, with one study showing a 
reduced need for ECMO. A ser ies of in vitro  studies  have shown that 
a synthetic surfactant containing KL4 peptide tends to be more 
resistant to inhibition by [CONTACT_840485] (fibrinogen, C -

known to inhibit s urfactant activity when compared with an animal 
derived surfactant.  
A study on r ecombinant surfactant protein C –based surfactant,  
indicat ed that among patients with ARDS caused by a direct lung 
injury, those who received surfactant tended to have a higher  survival 
rate than those  who received standard therapy. In fact, an oxygenation 
benefit was found across the entire population of patients who 
received surfactant.  
Lucinactant has an extensive safety profile and has been safely 
administered to over 1000 subjects in different patient populations 
(adults, infants, toddlers) for different indications  (eg, respi[INVESTIGATOR_840432] ( RDS ), acute hypoxem ic respi[INVESTIGATOR_7518] (AHRF), ARDS) . In almost all cases, there were no safety 
signals of concern with rates of adverse events (AEs) being similar to 
control (placebo and active) . An increase in AEs was noted in one 
study when using bronchoalveolar lavage  to administer SURFAXIN ; 
however, bronchoalveolar lavage is no longer used and lyophilized 
lucinactant has a much lower viscosity then SURFAXIN, which also should minimize any temporary airway obstruction. 
It is hypothesized that lucinactant may improve th e respi[INVESTIGATOR_840433] -19. 
Study Des cription : This is a multicenter , single -treatment  study. Subjects will consist of 
adults with COVID -19 associated acute lung injury who are being 
cared for in a critical care environment.

causes has been named “coronavirus disease 2019” (abbreviated “CO VID-19”).  
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS -CoV, SARS -CoV, and now with this new 
virus. The SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1167923] been studied in acute hypoxemic respi[INVESTIGATOR_840438]. It is hypothesized that lucinactant may improve t he respi[INVESTIGATOR_840439] -19.  
Lucinactant is a synthetic surfactant that is approved by [CONTACT_55257] (NDA 021746) for the 
prevention of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (RDS) in premature infants  at high risk for RDS . It 
has been s afely administered to over 1000 children and adults. Preliminary data from animal and 
human adult studies indicate that lucinactant could benefit those with acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS) in the context of COVID -19 infection, improving oxygenat ion and lessening 
lung damage. When given after intubation, lucinactant could potentially decrease the duration of 
ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

associated with COVID -19 is approximately 5%. This is lower than the 10% and 36% fatality rates 
seen during the SARS and MERS coronavirus outbreaks , respectively. The characterization of 
COVID- 19 is still evolving. COVID -19 has some similarity to SARS including that it may be able 
to use the ACE2 receptor in the lung. However, the spread of infection appears to be more rapid with COVID- 19 compared to SARS ( over 150 million cases in 15 months  for COVID -19 vs 8098 
cases in 8 months  for SARS). Most reported cases have been in adults  and m ost hospi[INVESTIGATOR_759684] 02- CL-2001a  - CONFIDENTIAL - Windtree Therapeutics, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol   Version 2.1, [ADDRESS_1167925] pneumonia . Many patients develop an ARDS -like clinical presentation,  some 
develop a secondary infection, and many require intensive care for respi[INVESTIGATOR_840440]. The fatality rate for COVID -19 patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840441] 7- 10% (from CDC June  20, 2020). 
COVID- 19 uses the SARS -coronavirus receptor, angiotensin- converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for 
entry into the host cells. AC E2 is a surface molecule highly expressed in AT2 cells of lung, along 
with esophageal upper epi[INVESTIGATOR_840442] a potential route for COVID -19 
infection  (1). AT2 cells are the cells that produce surfactant in the lung. It stands to reason that if 
they are damaged by [CONTACT_4113] -19, that surfactant production would be impaired. Recent 
publications suggest that lung fibrosis a nd severe interstitial changes occur in COVID -19 patients 
who developed ALI/ARDS. These changes resemble those seen in premature infants who are initially ventilated due to RDS and later develop BPD, which also presents with similar lung 
interstitial and f ibrotic changes  (2,3,4) . These observations may support the of use of exogenous 
surfactant in the treatment of ALI/ARDS caused by [CONTACT_4113] -19. 
Lucinactant significantly reduced mortality in a related pre -clinical  model of H5N1 in ferrets 
infected with highly pathogenic avian (H5N1) influenza. Results showed that surfactant treatment significantly improved survival, as well as viral - and inflammation -related lung damage (Figure 
2-1).

Page 21 of 69  2.2.1 Unmet Medical Need in Treatment of COVID- 19 Associated ARDS  
Currently, when patients’ breathing deteriorates, they are placed on a mechanical ventilator (MV) 
to help them breathe while they are symptomatic. However, MV cannot correct the underlying issue involved with breathing difficulties , known as acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_840443] (ARDS), 
and in many cases cannot prevent death. 
ARDS is a sudden, progressive pulmonary disorder characterized by [CONTACT_840490]-
cardiogenic pulmonary edema in association with refractory hypoxemia, decreased lung complianc e, and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates on the chest radiograph  (5). It may occur as a direct 
result of injury to the lung such as with gastric content aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], pneumonia (both bacterial and 
viral), toxin inhalation or it may be  associated with a wide variety of systemic processes such as 
sepsis, non- thoracic trauma, acute pancreatitis, multiple blood transfusions, fat embolism or shock  
(6). The pathophysiology of ARDS involves injury to the alveolar -capi[INVESTIGATOR_45075], atelectasis, 
intrapulmonary shunting of blood flow and surfactant dysfunction. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_840444], mortality from ARDS can be as high as 40%, and current 
therapy remains entirely supportive with no therapi[INVESTIGATOR_840445]  (7,8,9,10,11,12,13) . 
The primary goal of ARDS treatment is to identify and correct the underlying etiology. For 
coronavirus this is supportive care until the virus is cleared by [CONTACT_27639]. Prevention of 
potential adverse effects of mechanical ventilation such as barotrauma and volutrauma is also critical. Using mechan ical ventilatory support as safely as possible and improving lung compliance 
can contribute to avoiding these complications.   
There is an unmet medical need for a therapy that will improve the patients’ respi[INVESTIGATOR_840446] o n mechanical ventilators.  
2.2.2 Lucinactant   
Since the initial report of ARDS by [CONTACT_840491]. (14), abnormalities of the surfactant system 
have been recognized. In subsequent studies, Petty and colleagues reported both qualitative  and 
quantitative alterations in surfactant obtained from patients with ARDS  (15,16) . It is now widely 
accepted that surfactant abnormalities play a major role in the pathophysiology of ARDS, favoring alveolar collapse, ventilation/perfusion mismatch, and increased pulmonary shunt fraction (17,18,19,20) . Not only have these chemical and functional changes been described in patients 
Protocol 02- CL-2001a  - CONFIDENTIAL - Windtree Therapeutics, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol   Version 2.1, [ADDRESS_1167926] been described in patients at -risk to develop 
ARDS  (20,21) .  
Degradation of native surfactant by [CONTACT_840492], and 
inhibition of surfactant functional activity plasma proteins have been implicated in impairment of alveolar surfactant. One of the hallmarks of ARDS is damaged alveoli and airways that are filled 
with fluid containing inflammatory cells, protein, inflammatory mediators and other debris. In 
addition, damage to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_840447]/or release of altered surfactant.  
The biophysical change in the surfactant system that occurs with ARDS is an increase in minimum 
surface tension  (20), while the biochemical changes in the surfactant system that occur with ARDS 
include:  
1) a decrease in the total phospholipid content  (20) ,  
2) an alteration in the phospholipid profile as demonstrated by a decrease in the percenta ge 
of phosphatidylcholine  (PC), dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine  (DPPC), and 
phosphatidylglycerol  (PG) (17,18,19,20) ,  
3) an alteration in the fatty acid composition of the phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]  (17,22) , 
4) a reduction in large surfactant aggregates  (23,24) , and 
5) a decrease in the surfactant associated proteins SP -A, SP -B, and SP -D (20,21,23) . 
Since many of the major pulmonary consequences of ARDS may be directly influenced by 
[CONTACT_840493], replacement treatment with exogenous surfactant is potentially efficacious 
in this disor der. In addition, damaged alveoli and airways are filled with fluid containing 
inflammatory cells, protein, inflammatory mediators and other debris.  
In a series of in vitro  studies, liquid lucinactant for intratracheal instillation (SURFAXIN
®) has 
been shown to be more resistant than natural lung surfactant and exogenous, commercially 
available animal -derived surfactant to the inhibitory effects of plasma proteins (including 
fibrinogen (25,26) ), and inactivation by [CONTACT_840494]  (27). This 
is especially relevant in the milieu of the inflamed lung that leads to natural surfactant inactivation 
and degradation. 
Additionally , lucinactant has been shown to modulate the inflammatory response in various 
models of lung injury. In addition to studies in a murine H1N1 influenza model, we have also 
generated data showing that lucinactant administration significantly attenuates protein leak and 
neutrophil migration into the  alveolar space in a hyperoxic and LPS lung injury model in mice

In addition, c linical evidence in children with acute hypoxic respi[INVESTIGATOR_7518] (AHRF) showed potentially beneficial results of lucinactant in a group of patients with mild to moderate RSV infections, including pneumonia. 
Windtree has completed 13 clinical studies with lucinactant for intratrache al 
administration: 4 studies in adult subjects with ARDS ( Studies KL4-ARDS -01, 
KL4-ARDS -02, KL4 -ARDS -03, and KL4- ARDS -04), 1 study in children up to 2 years of age with 
acute hypoxemic respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] ( AHRF ) (Study KL4-AHRF -01), 1 study in premature 
neonate s with RDS  (Study KL4-IRDS -01 [CP -1/CP -2]), 3  studies in premature neonate s at risk 
for developi[INVESTIGATOR_840449] ( Studies KL4-IRDS -02, KL4 -IRDS -05, and KL4- IRDS -06), 1 study in very 
low birth weight ( VLBW ) premature neonates for the prevention of BPD ( Study KL4-BPD-01), 
and 3 studie s in full -term neonates with MAS ( Studies KL4-MAS -01, KL4-MAS -02, and KL4 -
MAS -03). Additionally three c linical studies with lucinactant for inhalation (reconstituted 
lyophilized lucinactant delivered via an investigational medical dev ice) have been completed in 
preterm neonates with RDS (Studies 03- CL-1201, 03- CL-1401 and 03 -CL-1202). There is 1 
ongoing clinical study with lucinactant for inhalation (Study 03- CL-1702) for premature neonates 
with RDS. Enrollment for this study has been terminated but data analysis is ongoing. A summary of selected studies is presented below.  
1. The KL4 -ARDS -[ADDRESS_1167928] 
attempted  to utilize bronchopulmonary segmental surfactant lavage of the entire lung to 
treat ARDS  (32). Bronchoscopic administration of dilute (2.5 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL) 
concentrations of lucinactant, when administered as two or three 30 mL aliquots followed 
by [CONTACT_840495] 19 bronchopulmonary segments, was safe and well tolerated in all 12 patients tested. A similar safety profile was observed in 4 of the 12 patients who received retreatment of the three 30 mL aliquot dosing regime n of lucinactant 6 -24 hours 
later. A second, similar trial was performed in 14 patients with ARDS. Nine of these

Page 24 of 69  received bronchoscopic administration of lucinactant. In these patients, the therapy was 
safe and well -tolerated.  
2. The KL4-ARDS -03 study was a  phase 2 , open- label, controlled, multi -center, 
international study of surfactant lavage for the treatment of ARDS in adults. Patients 
were randomized to receive either surfactant administered in low concentrations and 
large volumes via a bronchoscopic segm ental lavage technique (lung wash), or the 
current standard of care (SOC), which is MV and other supportive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Surfactant was delivered with a bronchoscope to each of the 19 segments of the lung and was intended to cleanse and remove inflammatory s ubstances and debris from the lung, while 
leaving sufficient amounts of surfactant
 behind to help re -establish an adequate lung 
function and capacity to absorb oxygen. The primary efficacy endpoint was the incidence 
of patients alive and off mechanical ven tilation for ≥  48 hours at the end of Day 28. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included mortality rate at the end of Day 28 and number 
of days alive and off mechanical ventilation for ≥  [ADDRESS_1167929] that a transient incre ase in oxygenation occurred in both of the 
lucinactant treatment groups during the dosing period. This increase in oxygenation 
appeared to be more sustained in the higher lucinactant dose group compared to the lower 
lucinactant dose group.  
3. The KL4 -ARDS -04 study was a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, open- label controlled 
study designed to assess the tolerability, safety, and efficacy of lucinactant delivered via 
bronchopulmonary segmental lavage to adult patients with ARDS.  The study population 
consisted of adult patients between the ages of 16.4 and 76.4 years (inclusive) who were 
intubated and required mechanical ventilation and who met the criteria for a diagnosis of 
ARDS . 
The study was conducted in 2 parts: Part A was designed to evaluate the safety and  
tolerability of 4 lucinactant treatment regimens; Part B was designed to evaluate the 
safety and effectiveness of [ADDRESS_1167930] manifested as improved oxygenation. This was demonstrated by [CONTACT_840496] 2/FiO 2 (P/F) ratio after patients received surfactant lavage.

Page 25 of 69  Clinically  and statistically significant increases were observed in the P/F ratio at 24 hours 
after surfactant lavage, compared with SOC.  
All-cause m ortality at the end of Day 28 was not different between the l ucinactant groups 
and SOC (14.3%; 23.7%; 13.9%, respecti vely). The mean number of days that subjects 
were alive and off mechanical ventilation through Day 28 was slightly less for subjects 
in lucinactant Group B.2 (10.6 days) compared with lucinactant Group B.1 (14.4 days) 
and SOC (13.9 days).  
There were no meaningful differences noted in the clinical outcomes in patients classified as having direct or indirect ARDS . 
4. The KL4-AHRF -01 study was a phase 2, multicenter, masked, placebo- controlled trial 
in 165 infants up to 2 years -of-age. Infants were randomized to receive either lucinactant 
or placebo (33). For the primary outcome, duration of MV through 14 days, t here was no 
difference in the duration of MV between subjects treated with lucinactant and placebo 
treatment. There were no significant differences in other efficacy endpoints: ventilator 
free days, duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, duration of s upplemental oxygen or 
duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_151400] [ADDRESS_1167931] randomization. Similarly, there were no significant differences in fraction of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_1401], P/F ratio and oxygenation index 
(OI) at any time point. There was a trend for improved oxygenation with lucinactant 
based on improvement in P/F from eligibility to [ADDRESS_1167932] dose . Subjects with milder 
disease seemed to respond better to lucinactant treatment , and statistically fewer 
lucinactant subjects required a second treatment; however , more lucinactant subjects 
required reintubation compared to placebo.  
Safety evaluations included assessment of adverse events during dosing (peri -dosing 
events), adverse events associated with endotracheal intubation and MV, and any other adverse event t hat occurred throughout the duration of the study. As expected, peri -
dosing events were more frequent in the lucinactant -treated subjects, since placebo 
subjects only received sham air. In general, peri -dosing events were transient and 
resolved when lucina ctant instillations were slowed. There were no significant difference 
in overall mortality between groups. All deaths were deemed to be not related to study treatment by [CONTACT_941] P rincipal Investigators. In summary, i n this study in ventilated infants 
with AHRF , treatment with intratracheal lucinactant appeared to be generally safe and 
well-tolerated despi[INVESTIGATOR_840450] -dosing events observed. An 
improvement in oxygenation and the observation that significantly less requirement for

5. The KL4 -IRDS -02 (CP1/CP2) study was  a phase 1/2 clinical trial in premature neonates 
demonstrated that lucinactant is effective in the treatment of RDS in such patients (34). 
A total of 47 pre -term neonate s (750- 1750 g birth weight) were enrolled within the first 
four hours of life. All enrolled patients were treated with a bolus intratracheal injection 
of lucinactant (133 mg/kg or 200 mg/kg). 
Treatment with lucinactant rapi[INVESTIGATOR_840451], improved lung expansion as 
demonstrated radiographically, and reduced ventilation support. The fraction of inspi[INVESTIGATOR_218686] (FiO 2) fell in conjunction with a rise in the ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen 
in arterial blood compared to the alveoli (a/A O 2). There were no deaths related to RDS 
among the study neonate s, although two of 47 (4.3%) died of unrelated abnormalities : 
aortic  atresia and sequelae of extreme immaturity.  
6. The KL4 -MAS -01/KL4- MAS -02 study was a  multicenter , randomized, controlled phase 
1/[ADDRESS_1167934] of care for 
treatment of MAS in full- term newborn neo nates was performed (35). Results indicated  that 
the procedure was well tolerated in the 15 patients treated with lucinactant . There were two 
serious adverse events (SAEs) related to the drug:  one report of hypoxia which was 
considered by [CONTACT_840497]. The neonate s lavaged with lucinactant  exhibited mo re rapid and sustained improvement in 
oxygenation compared to control neonate s. Moreover, the lavaged neonates were 
disconnected from mechanical ventilation (MV) an average of three days sooner than 
control neonate s. 
7. The KL4-IRDS -06 study was  a phase  3, pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735], multinational, multicenter, randomized, 
masked, controlled, event -driven, prophylaxis study in premature neonates  that 
demonstrated  lucinactant is significantly superior to colfosceril palmitate (Exosurf
®) in 
preventing and ameliorating RDS, reduci ng death due to RDS, and keepi[INVESTIGATOR_840452], and  lucinactant is generally safe and well tolerated compared with colfosceril palmitate and beractant (Survanta
®) (36). In this study, a total of 1294 
neonates  less than 32 weeks of gestational age and weighing between 600 and 1250 
grams at birth were randomized at 50 study centers, 527 to the lucinactant group, 509 to the colfosceril palmitate group , and 258 to the beractant group. Efficacy analyses were

Page 27 of 69  based on the intent -to-treat population (all randomized neonates). Safety analyses were 
based on all treated neonates (n=1288).  
Lucinactant was significantly superior to colfosceril palmitate in the primary outcomes 
and associated clinically important complicati ons of prematurity and mechanical 
ventilation. Compared with colfosceril palmitate treated neonates, significantly fewer 
lucinactant treated neonates had RDS at 24 hours (39.1% vs. 47.2% p=0.005) or died 
from an RDS -related death within 14 days of birth (4.7% vs. 9.4% p=0.002). All -cause 
mortality rates at [ADDRESS_1167935] conceptual age (PCA) for lucinactant, colfosceril 
palmitate and beractant were 21.1%, 23.8% and 26.4% respectively.  
The incidence of adverse experiences in the study were those expected in this population 
and did not differ from those observed with colfosceril palmitate or beractant. 
8. The KL4-IRDS -02 study was  a phase 3, supportive, masked, multicenter, randomized, 
controlled study comparing lucinactant to poractant alfa (Curosurf®), lucinactant was 
shown to be non- inferior to poractant alfa for the endpoint of alive and not having BPD 
at 28 days of age in neonates with birth weight between 600 and 1250 grams, and 24 to < 29 weeks gestational age  (37). All-cause mortality rates throughout the course of the 
study were consistently lower in the lucinactant group but did not reach statistical 
significance. Lucinactant event rates for other key secondary outcome measures were 
similar to those in the poractan t-treated group.  
Adverse events ( AEs) and SAEs were reported generally with the same frequency in both 
treatment groups. Although significantly more instances of transient peri -dosing events 
were reported with lucinactant compared with poractant alfa, they  did not appear to lead 
to excess deaths, air -leak, or other neonatal complications. Interruption of administration 
of study drug in those neonates was very infrequent and no neonates discontinued 
lucinactant because of an AE.  
9. The KL4-BPD -01 study was a phase 2, multicenter , masked, placebo- controlled trial (38) 
assessing safety and efficacy of  lucinactant , in very low birth weight neonate s at risk for 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_840453] ( BPD ) randomized  [ADDRESS_1167936] dose (175 mg/kg), lucinactant low dose (90 mg/kg), or sham air as a control.  
Protocol 02- CL-2001a  - CONFIDENTIAL - Windtree Therapeutics, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol   Version 2.1, [ADDRESS_1167937] 175 mg/kg lucinactant dosing compared with controls (57.8% vs. 65.9%, 
respectively) was observed.  This study also showed a higher survival rate through [ADDRESS_1167938] -menstrual age (PMA)  in neonates receiving the standard 175 mg/kg 
lucinactant dos ing compared  with controls (88.9% vs. 84.1%, respectively) a nd a 
reduction in duration of mechanical ventilation (approximately four less days) and need for supplemental oxygen in neonate s receiving the standard 175 mg/kg lucinactant dosing 
compared with c ontrols. 
Lucinactant therapy was generally safe and well tolerated  with generally no differences 
between the lucinactant treatment groups and the control group in common complications of prematurity. There were no differences noted in tolerability of  drug between the 
lucinactant  standard dose of 175 mg/kg (given at a volume of 5.8 ml/kg) and the 
lucinactant  low dose of 90 mg/kg (given at a volume of 3.0 ml/kg) .

MV is associated with morbidities such as ventilator -associated lung injury and 
volutrauma/barotrauma resulting in air leak syndromes such as pneumothorax and/or pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE) . Surfactant instilled intratracheally has been associated with peri -
dosing events such as transient hypoxemia, bradycardia, and hypotension. These are usually not severe, are transient, and typi[INVESTIGATOR_40167] 30 minutes . 
Studies in adults with ARDS administered lucinactant using bronchopulmonary surfactant lavage 
of each segment of the lungs to attempt to remove alveolar debris and effectively deposit functional 
surfactant . Safety results show that this procedure was general ly safe and well tolerated ; however, 
this procedure was more invasive than other delivery methods and required more time and skill to 
complete dosing and may have contributed to the increased treatment -emergent AE  in the 
lucinactant -treated subjects . A total of 44 of 110 lucinactant patients (40%) and [ADDRESS_1167940] 
of care patients (33%) experienced an SAE . A total of 15 of 88 lucinactant patients (17%) in KL4-

were observed in the ARDS studies. In the KL4- ARDS -04 Study, all -cause m ortality at the end of 
Day 28 was numerically, but not statistically significantly , higher in lucinactant Group B.2 ( 24%)  
compared with lucinactant Group B.1 and SOC ( 14% in each ).

by a far less invasive procedure. Close safety review has been incorpora ted to monitor the safety 
profile and identify any findings that might merit a change to the study. The program is designed 
to be a rigorous, iterative process.

This is a multicenter , single -treatment  study in adults with COVID -19, who are being cared for in 
a critical care environment.  
Subjects will be enrolled into the lucinactant treatment group if they meet all the screening c riteria. 
Enrolled subjects will receive reconstituted lyophilized lucinactant ([ADDRESS_1167945]/mL) as a 
liquid at 160 ml (~ [ADDRESS_1167946]/kg lean body weight [~ 2.7 ml/kg lean body weight] ). Sites  from  the

4.[ADDRESS_1167947] ranged from very mild (including some with no reported 
symptoms) to severe, including illness resulting in death. The lungs appear to be affected in nearly 
all cases, with t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_840454].  
Surfactants, specifically lucinactant, have been studied in acute hypoxemic respi[INVESTIGATOR_840438]. Preliminary data from animal and adult human studies indicate that lucinactant could benefit those with  ARDS in the context of COVID -19 infection, improving oxygenation and 
lessening lung damage. Furthermore, lucinactant, given early in the course of the disease, could 
potentially decrease the need for endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventil ation.  
It is hypothesized that lucinactant may provide relief of the respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856], allowing patients to recover while suffering from COVID -19. 
4.3 Justification for D ose 
SRT has been proposed to treat ARDS in children and adults. SRT was initially successful in adult 
ARDS patients  (5) and later in pediatric patients  (39). These studies used a dose volume of 2–4 
ml/kg.  
Survanta
® (25 mg phospholipid [PL]/ml) was administered to adul t ARDS patients by 
[CONTACT_840498]  (5). Three dose groups were studied: up to [ADDRESS_1167948]/kg (4 
ml/kg) , up to [ADDRESS_1167949]/kg  (2 ml/kg) , and up to [ADDRESS_1167950]/kg (4 ml/kg) . The 
Protocol 02- CL-2001a  - CONFIDENTIAL - Windtree Therapeutics, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol   Version 2.1, [ADDRESS_1167951] /kg as compared with control patients (p =0.011). Mortality in the same group of 
patients was 18.8%, as compared with 43.8% in the control group (p =0.075). Intratracheal bolus 
instillation of Survanta was generally well tolerated, and no safety concerns were identified. Data 
did suggest that after [ADDRESS_1167952]/kg , further doses were accompanied by [CONTACT_840499][INVESTIGATOR_840455].  
Infasurf
® ([ADDRESS_1167953]/ml) was administered to children, 1 week to 21 years of age, with ARDS by 
[CONTACT_840498]  (39). Two doses of 80 ml/m2 were administered to patients ≥ 10 kg. 
Infants < 10 kg received 3 ml/kg (equivalent to the premature infant dose). The Infasurf  group 
experienced a decrease in oxygenation index from 20 to 13.9 after 12 hours compared with the 
placebo group’s decrease from  20.5 to 15.1 ( p=.01). Mortality was significantly greater in the 
placebo group compared with the Infasurf group ( 36% vs 19.5%) . No significant decrease in  
duration of ventilator therapy and ICU or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_840456]. There were no differences 
in long-term complications.  
Future studies in ARDS patients switched to a lower dose volume of approximately 1 mL/kg. This change in dose volume result ed in a failure of SRT in adults  (40,41,42) . 
Venticute
® ([ADDRESS_1167954]/ml) was administered to a dult ARDS patients by [CONTACT_840498]  
(41). Up to 4 doses of 50 mg/kg (1 ml/kg) were administered to patients. O verall survival at 28 
days after treatment was 66 % and the median number of ventilator -free days was [ADDRESS_1167955] the p ossible need for a prolonged treatment period, possibly with 
greater intervals between doses , with a larger number of doses , or with a larger dose volume . Up 
to 3 treatments (dose = 30 mg [[ADDRESS_1167956]/ml] per centimeter of height) were allowed if retreatment criteria were met. Infasurf administration was not associated with improved survival, length of 
stay or oxygenation. The authors speculated that the lack of response could be related to 
insufficient dosing of surfactant, since they choose not to administer a second dose of surfactant if the first was w ithout clear benefit. They also concluded that the lack of oxygenation benefit may

Page 34 of 69  be due to ineffective timing of instillation and/or administration technique rather than lack of 
efficacy of exogenous surfactant  (40) . 
Based on previous clinical studies, as well as studies in several animal models of ARDS, the 
proposed dose of lucinactant ([ADDRESS_1167957]/ml) is 160 ml ( 80 mg/kg lbw, based on an estimated 
60 kg lbw patient similar to those enrolled in the Survanta and Venticute studies ). Windtree 
believes that this dose addresses both the amount of PL required to sufficiently restore alveolar surface tension and the volume of lucinactant required to adequately coat the alveolar surface.

Page 36 of 69  5.3 Lifestyle Considerations  
The use of lucinactant in women of childbearing potential not using contraceptive measures should 
be avoided; women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test ( β-hCG) 
recorded prior to administration of lucinactant  and at the end of the study. Men and premenopausal 
women will be required to use double -barrier methods of birth control from enrollment through 30 
days following discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
Subjects should not smoke or use illicit drugs, including marijuana. 5.4 Screen Failures  
Screen failures are defi ned as patients who consent to participate in the clinical trial but are not 
subsequently assigned to a study intervention or entered in the study. A minimal set of screen 
failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure pa rticipants, to meet 
the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements , and to 
respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information will include the reason for 
screen failure and may include demography, eligibil ity criteria, and any serious adverse event 
(SAE).  
5.5 Strategies for Recruitment and Retention  
Subjects will be recruited from each institution  based upon inpatient admission for COVID -19. 
Patients or their legal guardians who wish to enroll will go through t he informed consent process; 
patients or their legal guardians will be reminded they may withdraw consent at any time. Informed 
consent will be administered in paper or electronic format.  
No overall recruitment strategies are planned; any strategies employ ed by a site must be approved 
by [CONTACT_840500] /IEC  and be included in their site regulatory binder (with a copy sent to 
Windtree).

Page 37 of 69  6 STUDY DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION 
6.1 Treatment s Administered  
6.1.1 Study Intervention Description 
Lucinactant will be provided as a lyophilized powder in a 30 ml vial. Lucinactant will be 
reconstituted with 10 ml sterile Water for Injection (WFI). Reconstituted lyophilized lucinactant will be given at a volume of 160 ml, delivered as a liquid  in the tr achea. 
Lyophilized lucinactan t will be appropriately labeled with the investigational caution statements 
required by [CONTACT_1586] (eg, [LOCATION_002] [US] Food and Drug Administration  
[FDA], the National Administration of Drugs, Foods and M edical Devices [ANMAT] ) to ensure 
that users are aware that the product is limited by [CONTACT_1587] . Additional 
information can be found in the investigator’s brochure and in the package insert for SURFAXIN. 
6.1.[ADDRESS_1167961] to the pharmacy to prepare study drug has been made . Enrollment 
should occur within 7 days of endotracheal intubation and MV. 
Initial Dose  
Reconstituted lyophilized lucinactant i s administered using the following instillation procedure: 
a. The ventilator will be set at an FiO 2 of 1.00. 
b. To prevent cough and throat closure, the patient may receive a short- acting paralytic.  
c. Lucinactant will be administered via a number 10 French end- hole suction catheter 
positioned in the trachea at the end of the endotracheal tube. The suction catheter will be 
inserted into the ventilator’s inspi[INVESTIGATOR_840457] a side-port connector.  
d. The total dose of lucinactant will be divided into four quarter-doses (40 ml) . Each 
quarter -dose will be further sub-divided into aliquots of 20 ml. Each quarter-dose will be 
instilled in one of the four positions listed below, one aliquot at a time. After each quarter dose, ensure the patient is stable before continuing the dosing.

Page 38 of 69  1. Quarter -dose administered with the patient supi[INVESTIGATOR_840458] 45° to the right. 
Each aliquot will be followed by 1 minute of ventilation. 
2. Quarter -dose administered with the patie nt supi[INVESTIGATOR_840458] 45° to the left. Each 
aliquot will be followed by 1 minute of ventilation. 
3. Quarter -dose administered with the patient supi[INVESTIGATOR_840458] 45° to the right. 
Each aliquot will be followed by 1 minute of ventilation. 
4. Quarter -dose ad ministered with the patient supi[INVESTIGATOR_840458] 45° to the left. Each 
aliquot will be followed by 1 minute of ventilation. 
During the administration of the lucinactant, the investigator should monitor the patient's oxygen 
saturation by [CONTACT_117682] -oximetry. If the subject does not tolerate one of the 40 ml quarter doses, the 
dosing for that dose may be terminated at that time. It is recommended that the other quarter doses 
remain 40 ml; however, a lower dose may be administered for the remaining aliquots at the  
Investigator’s discretion. The investigator will remain with the patient during the first [ADDRESS_1167962]- treatment. No ventilator changes are to be made during this 10- minute period unless cyanosis 
or bradycardia occur. At the end of this 10- minute perio d, the patient’s FiO
2 should be weaned to 
the patient’s pre -treatment FiO 2. The patient should not be suctioned for one hour following 
dosing. 
If, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the patient experiences clinically significant desaturations, 
hypoxia and/or bradycardia, the lucinactant administration should be temporally suspended to allow the patient to recovery. If the patient doesn’t not recovery in a reasonable time, the administration should be terminated. If the administration procedure is re -starte d and the patient 
experiences a second epi[INVESTIGATOR_840459], hypoxia and/or bradycardia, 
the lucinactant administration should be immediately terminated.  
Retreatment  Doses  
Up to 3 retreatment doses are allowed no sooner than 6 hours apart (from completion of previous 
dose). Subjects are eligible for retreatments if they remain on MV, there is no evidence of 
pneumothorax, the P/F ratio is under 300 (or S/F ratio is under 315 (43), if no arterial line is 
present) , and there are no safety concerns that would prevent retreatment (in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070]). Retreatments are given at the discretion of the investigator , but it is encouraged  that 
retrea tments be given at the recommended time interval if the patient is still receiving MV and 
meets all retreatment criteria . 
Retreatment should be performed in the same manner as the initial treatment.

Page 40 of 69  6.2.4 Preparation  
Details for study drug preparation can be found in the study manual. Briefly, lyophilized 
lucinactant is reconstituted immediately before use by [CONTACT_1583] 10 m l of sterile WFI  to the vial of 
lucinactant, after which the vial is gently inverted to mix the suspension; no warming is necessary.  
Each vial is drawn up into a single -use syringe . The syringe  should be  labeled with the subject’s 
identification number.  
6.3 Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding  
For this study, the study drug (lyophilized lucinactant) is being delivered in an open- label manner  
and no randomization will occur; thus, no procedures to minimize bias relative to randomization 
or blinding will be employed. 
6.4 Study Interventio n Compliance  
Study treatments will be administered in an in -patient setting (ie, ICU) by  [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a person 
approved for dosing by [CONTACT_840502] . Completion of drug delivery for each treatment and re -treatment 
will be monitored; no other compliance measurements  will be employed. 
6.5 Concomitant Therapy  
Applicable concomitant medications (sedatives, paralytics, vasopressors, anti -coagulants, 
COVID- directed antiviral and anti -inflammatory therapy) will be recorded from enrollment until 
the final subject assessment.

Page 41 of 69  7 STUDY INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION AND PARTICIPANT 
DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL  
7.1 Discontinuation of Study Intervention  
Study treatment may be interrupted at any time as circumstances dictate (eg, peri -dosing event ). 
In all cases, emergent care of the subject takes precedence over study treatment; however, it is 
important to complete SRT as soon as possible. If study treatm ent is interrupted or stopped, the 
reason for doing so must be recorded, especially in regard to peri -dosing events (bradycardia, 
desaturation, hypotension, pallor , gagging/regurgitation/vomiting).  
Discontinuation from study treatment does not mean discont inuation from the study, and the 
remaining study procedures should be completed as indicated. If a clinically significant finding is 
identified after enrollment (including, but not limited to changes from baseline), the investigator 
or qualified designee w ill determine if any change in participant management is needed. Any new 
clinically relevant finding will be reported as an AE.  
7.2 Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study  
The subject is free to withdraw consent from subject participation in the study at any time. An 
investigator may discontinue or withdraw a participant from the study i f any clinical AE or other 
medical condition or situation occurs such that continued participation in the study would not be in the best interest of the subject.  
The reason for subject discontinuation or withdrawal from the study will be recorded on the end 
of study e CRF  page . Subjects who are enrolled and subsequently withdraw, or are withdrawn or 
discontinued from the study, will not be replaced.

Page 45 of 69  8.4 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
8.4.1 Definition of Adverse Events  
An adverse event ( AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of 
an intervention, whether or not considered intervention related . An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of an investigational product  [21 CFR 312.32(a) , ICH E6(R2) ]. 
8.4.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “ serious ” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life -threatening 
adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or 
signifi cant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm re quiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
8.4.3 Classification of an Adverse Event  
[IP_ADDRESS] Severity of Event  
The severity of an AE is assessed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_840466]:  
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the subject’s daily 
activities.  
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some inter ference with functioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a subject ’s usual activity level and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment. Severe events may be potentially life -threatening or 
incapacitating. Of note, the term “severe” does not necessar ily equate to “serious .” 
Protocol 02- CL-2001a  - CONFIDENTIAL - Windtree Therapeutics, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol   Version 2.1, 18 June 2021 
 
 
Page 46 of 69  [IP_ADDRESS] Relationship to Study Intervention  
All AEs must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_978], based on temporal 
relationship and his/her clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about causality will be graded 
using the categories below. In a clinical trial, the study product must always be suspect.  
• Related – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnor mal laboratory 
test result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to study intervention administration , 
follows a known response pattern to the study intervention, and cannot be explained by 
[CONTACT_9153]. An AE that is d etermined to be due to the 
subject’s underlying disease state or is common for this patient population generally should not be considered related.  
• Possibly Related – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (eg, the event 
occurred within a r easonable time after administration of the trial medication)  and/or 
follows a known response pattern to the study drug. However, other factors may have contributed to the event (eg, the participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant events). Although an AE may rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it can be flagged 
as requiring more information and later be upgraded to “related ,” if appropriate. An AE 
that is determined to be due to the subject’s underlying disease state or is common for this patient population generally should not be considered possibly related.  
• Unlikely Related – A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose 
temporal relationship to study intervention administration makes a causal relationship improbable (eg, the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the study intervention) and in which other drugs or chemicals or underlying disease provides plausible explanations (eg, the subject’s clinical condition, othe r concomitant treatments).  
• Not Related – The AE is completely independent of study intervention administration, 
and/or evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There should be an alternative, definitive etiology documented by [CONTACT_15370].]  
[IP_ADDRESS] Expectedness  
The Windtree Medical Monitor  or designee  will be responsible for determining whether an AE is 
expected or unexpected. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent w ith the risk information previously described for the study 
intervention (ie, as per the Investigator’s Brochure) .

regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution. 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be considered 
as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorat es 
at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. 
The site will record all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after informed consent 
is obtained until [ADDRESS_1167974] day of study participation  or Day 30  (whichever occurs first) . 
Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization , or for 30 days 
after study participation . When possible, information collection should continue for subjects that 
withdraw or discontinue treatment early.  
8.4.5 Adverse Event Reporting  
All AEs are to be assessed in all subjects throughout D ay 30 (from enrollment to study withdrawal 
or completion) and documented in the study eCRF. Each AE should be reported spontaneously or 
in response to general, non- directed discussion with the attending nurse or physician (eg, “has 
there been any change in subject status since the last assessment period?” ). For each AE, the 
investigator should obtain all information required to complete the AE page of the eCRF, in accordance with eCRF completion guidelines (provided separately by [CONTACT_840502]).  
All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severity, or relationship to study participation, must be recorded (using medical terminology) in the source document and on the AE page of the eCRF. Whenever 
possible, diagnoses should be given when signs and symptoms are due to a common etiology.

Clinical Study Protocol   Version 2.1, [ADDRESS_1167975]’s last day in the study if an AE is ongoing at the time the subject 
completes the study.  
Documentation of AEs in the eCRF must include the following parameters; (1) duration (time of 
onset and resolution), (2) severity or grade, (3) outcome, (4) action taken, and (5) rel ationship to 
study drug. AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). 
8.4.[ADDRESS_1167976] be notified as 
soon as possible (and no later than 24 hours after the event has occurred) by [CONTACT_756], regardless 
of the relationship (or lack thereof) of the SAE to study participation. 
SAEs should be reported to Windtree’s reporting line. When reporting SAEs, the following 
information should be provided:  
1. Study identifier  
2. Study center  
3. Subject number  
4. A description of the event  
5. Date of onset  
6. Current status  7. Clarification on whether infusion 
therapy was discontinued 
8. The reason why the event is 
classified as serious  
9. The Investigator’s assessment of  the 
association between the event and study participation 
  
All reports of SAEs must be followed up within 24 hours (or sooner at the request of the medical 
monitor) by [CONTACT_840505].  
Safety report distribution is the responsibility of Windtree or designee (ie, CRO), which coordinates distribution of safety reports to applicable regulatory authorities and ECs. Finalized safety reports are distributed by [CONTACT_840506], “Responsible Team,” within a department 
that has responsibil ity to coordinate the distribution/submission activities, either directly or via a 
Local Submitting Party on behalf of Windtree.  
The Responsible Team receives finalized safety reports (eg, CIOMS -I form/MedWatch 3500A/

Clinical Study Protocol   Version 2.1, [ADDRESS_1167995].  
The FDA has issued regulations (21 CFR  Part 54, Financial Disclosure by [CONTACT_840519] ) 
that require sponsors to submit complete and accurate certification or disclosure statements to 
certify the absence of certain financial interests of clinical investigators, when clinical studies are submitted to FDA in support of market ing approval. These regulations are intended to ensure that 
financial interests and arrangements of clinical investigators, that could affect reliability of data 
submitted to FDA in support of marketing approval, are identified and disclosed by [CONTACT_456] . 
Clinical investigators will be asked to disclose proprietary (eg, patent, licensing agreement) and 
financial (eg, stock options, royalty) interests as they pertain to Windtree, before participating in the study. In addition, clinical investigators will be required to consult with Windtree before 
acquiring any financial interest in the company and must disclose any change in their proprietary or financial interests, if it occurs during the course of the study and for [ADDRESS_1167996] of the clinical investigator.  
If FDA determines that the financial interests of any clinical investigator raise serious questions 
about the integrity of the data, FDA will take any action it deems necessary to ensure the reliability 
of the data, including:  
1. Initiating agency audits of the data derived from the clinical investigator in question. 
2. Requesting that the sponsor submit further data analyses (eg, to evaluate the effect of the clinical investigator’s data on overall study outcome) . 
3. Requesting that the applicant conduct additional independent studies to confirm the results 
of the questioned study.

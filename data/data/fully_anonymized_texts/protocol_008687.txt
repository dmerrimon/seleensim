Title of Study:
Relative Bioavailability of [ADDRESS_601871] Formulations Compared to the Commercial Formulation in Healthy 
Subjects
Rationale: 
Changes in buffer composition are being investigated as a potential way to address injection -site pain reported for 
ixekizumab .  Study I1F -MC -RHCT is therefore being conducted to compare the relative bioavailability and 
tolerability of ixekizumab administered using 2 new formulations compared to the marketed formulation.  
Objective(s)/Endpoints:   
Objectives Endpoints
Primary
To evaluate the relative bioavailability of a single 
80mg subcutaneous ( SC)dose of ixekizumab Test 
Formulation [ADDRESS_601872] Formulation 2 compared to the 
commercial formulation (Reference)Maximum observed drug concentration (C max), area 
under the concentr ations versus time curve from time 
zero to infinity (AUC[0 -∞]), area under the 
concentration versus time curve from time zero to time 
t, where t is the last time point with a measurable 
concentration (AUC [0-tlast])
Secondary
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single 
80mg SC dose of ixekizumab Test Formulation [ADDRESS_601873] Formulation 2 compared to the commercial 
formulation (Reference)Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious 
adverse events (SAEs), injection -site reactions (ISRs), 
and visual analog scale (VAS) pain score immediately 
after injection
Summary of Study Design :  
Study I1F -MC -RHCT is a Phase 1, subject -blind, 3-arm, randomized, parallel -design study in healthy subjects.  
Eligible subjects will be admitted to the clini cal research unit (CRU) on Day  -1 and randomized 1:1:[ADDRESS_601874] the CRU after completing the 4 -hour safety assessments on 
Day 1, at the investigator’s discretion, and will return for pharmacokinetic ( PK) and immunogenicity sampling and 
safety assessments at predefined times up to [ADDRESS_601875] of telephone assessment.
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by [CONTACT_469491], vital sign measurements, temperature, recording 
of adverse events ( AEs), physical examination/medical assessments, Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale
(C-SSRS), Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12845] (HADS), immunogenicity, and injection -site ass essments.  Pain 
assessments will be made using an injection -site VAS . 
I1F-MC-RHCT (b)Clinical Pharmacology Protocol Page 8
Ixekizumab (LY2439821)Treatment Arms and Planned Duration for an Individual subject :  
All subjects will be screened within 28 days prior to enrollment .  On Day 1, subjects will receive a single 
subcutaneous (SC)dose of 1 of the following treatments, according to the randomization sch edule:  
80mg ixekizumab Test Formulation 1
80mg ixekizumab Test Formulation 2
80mg ixekizumab Commercial Formulation (Reference).  
Subjects will participate in the study fo r up to 12 weeks postdose.  
Number of Subjects:
Up to 99subjects may be enrolled so that 78 subjects (26 in each treatment arm) complete the study.  
Statistical Analysis:
Pharmacokinetic parameters will be evaluated to estimate relative bioavailability .  Log-transformed C maxand AUC 
parameters will be evaluated in a linear mixed -effects model with fixed effects for formulation, and a random effect 
for subject.  The treatment differences will be back -transformed to present the ratios of geometric means a nd the 
corresponding 90% CI.  
The t maxwill be analyzed using a Wilcoxon rank sum test.  Estimates of the median difference based on the 
observed medians, 90% CIs and p -values from the Wilcoxon rank sum test will be calculated.
Safety parameters will be listed and summarized using standard descriptive statistics , where possible .  Injection -site 
assessments, including induration, swelling, pruritis, bleeding/bruising, and erythema/redness , will also be assessed .  
The parameters will be listed and summarized using descriptive statistics.  Suicidal ideation and/or behavior and 
self-injurious behavior with no suicidal intent, based on the C -SSRS, will be listed by [CONTACT_1130].  HADS item scores 
will be listed for subjects with HADS depression s ubscale ≥[ADDRESS_601876] descriptive statistics.  In addition, the severity of pain will be categorized by [CONTACT_469492]: mild 
pain ( ≤ 30), moderate pain (> 30 and ≤ 70), and severe pain (> 70).  The nu mber and percentage of the subjects in 
each pain severity categ ory will summarized by [CONTACT_469493].
The frequency and percentage of subjects with preexisting anti-drug antibodies ( ADA) and with treatment -emergent 
ADA ( TE ADA )to ixekizumab wi ll be tabulated.  Treatment -emergent ADAs are defined as those with a titer 2 -fold 
(1 dilution) greater than the minimum required dilution if no ADAs were detected at baseline (treatment -induced 
ADA) or those with a 4 -fold (2 dilutions) increase in titer c ompared to baseline if ADAs were detected at baseline 
(treatment -boosted ADA).  For the TE ADA+ subjects the distribution of maximum titers will be described.  The 
frequency  of neutralizing antibodies will also be tabulated in TE ADA+ subjects.
Additional analy sis will be performed if warranted upon review of the data.

Ixekizumab (LY2439821)3.Introduction
3.1. Study Rationale
Ixekizumab is administered subcutaneously (SC), and is available as an injectable solut ion in 
either a m anual prefilled syringe (PFS) or a nautoinjector (AI).   Each PFS or AI contains [ADDRESS_601880] ion-site reacti ons (ISRs) 
following administration of ixekizumab via marketed AI (fast inject ion speed, visible needle ),a 
modified AI (slow inject ion speed, hidden needle ), the m arketed PFS, andplacebo administered 
using a device similar to the marketed AI ( fast injection speed, visible needle) .  The resul ts 
showed no statist ically significant difference in int ensity of inject ion-site pain foll owing single 
inject ions administered via any of the methods tested.  Safety  profiles, including the frequency of 
inject ion-site reacti ons (ISRs) were also similar between treatments.  
Several so lution-associated factors may  contribu te to pain percept ion associ ated wi th injectable 
therapeuti cs, incl uding act ive pharmaceut ical ingredient, pH, bu ffer composit ion, and tonicit y 
(Laursen et al. 2006) .
Two new formulat ions of ixekizumab have therefore been developed using alternat ive 
approaches for buffer and tonicit y agent ;
 
 
Study  I1F-MC-RHC T (Study  RHC T) is therefore being conducted to compare the relative 
bioavailabilit y and tol erabilit y of ixekizumab administered using the 2new form ulations, 
compared to the marketed formulat ionwhen administered using a PFS .  
Study  RHCT i s being conducted i n parallel wit h Study  I1F-MC-RHCS which will provide
further assessment of inject ion-site pain and ISRs associ ated wi th administrati on of  the 
3ixekizumab formulat ionsin a crossover study  design.  
3.2. Background
Ixekizumab (LY2439821, Taltz ®) is a humanized immunoglobulin (Ig)G subclass 4 monoclonal 
antibody  that binds wit h high affinit y and specificity  to interl eukin (IL) -17A, a proinflammatory  
cytokine.  Ixekizumab is marketed in the US and EU for the treatment of moderate -to-severe 
plaque psori asis (Ps) ata dose of 160 mg at Week 0, fo llowed by 80 mg every 2 weeks up to 
Week 12, then maintenance dosing of 80 mg every 4 weeks, and for psoriatic arthrit isat a dose 
of 160 mg at Week 0 followed by 80 mg every 4 weeks. 
3.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment
As thi s study  will enro lhealt hy subjects, t here is no anticipated therapeutic benefit for the 
subjects.   

I1F-MC-RHCT (b)Clinical Pharmacology Protocol Page 15
Ixekizumab (LY2439821)As of the cut- off date for the current invest igator’s brochure (IB ; 22 March 2018 ),more than 
[ADDRESS_601881] 1 dose of ixekizuma b ([ADDRESS_601882] imated 869 patients with axial spondyloarthrit is).  
Forty -one heal thy subjects were administered ixekizumab by  [CONTACT_16625] (1 60 m g [2 × 80 m g] followed 
by 80 mg 2 weeks later) in Study  I1F-MC-RHCA (Study  RHCA).  All AEs in Study  RHCA were 
mild in severit y.  The m ost comm only reported AEs were headache, injection -site ery thema, and 
fatigue.  With the except ion of fat igue, this is consistent wi th commo nly reported AEs reported 
in Phase 3 studi es.  An addit ional 78 healt hy subjects were administered ixekizumab by [CONTACT_16625], 
marketed AI, and modified AI (3 single 80 mg doses) in Study I1F-MC-RHCK.  All TEAEs 
were mild in severit y and the m ost comm only reported TEAEs were ISR, inject ion-site pruri tus, 
nausea, diarrhea, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_39738], and inject ion-site ery thema.   
More informat ion about the known and expected benefits, risks, serious adverse events (SAEs) 
and reasonably anticipated AEs of ixekizumab are to be found in the IB and the Package Insert.

5.1. OverallDesign
Study I1F -MC-RHCT is a Phase 1, subject -blind , 3-arm, rando mized, parallel -design study  in 
healt hy subjects.  
All subjects will be screened within 28 days prior to enrollment .  Eligible subjects will be 
admitted to the clinical research unit (CRU) on Day  -1 and rando mized 1:1:1 to 1 of 3 possible 
treatm ents. On Day  1, subjects will receive a single SC dose of one of the f ollowing treatm ents, 
according to the randomization schedule :  
80mg ixekizumab Co mmercial Formulation (Reference)
80mg ixekizumab Test Form ulation 1
80mg ixekizumab Test Formulation [ADDRESS_601887] igator’s discret ion,and will return for pharmacokinet ic(PK) and 
immunogenicit y sampling and s afety assessments at predefined t imes up to [ADDRESS_601888] of  telephone assessment.
Safety and tol erabilit y will  be assessed by  [CONTACT_90258], vi tal sign measurements, 
temperature, recording of AEs, physical examinat ion(PE)/medical assessments, Columbia 
Suicide Severi ty Rating Scale (C -SSRS) ,immunogenicit y, and inject ion-site assessments.  Pain 
assessments will be made using an inject ion-site visual  anal og scale (VAS) .
Study  governance considerations are described in detail in Appendix 3 .
5.2. Number of Participants
Up to 99subjects may be enro lled sothat 78 subjects (26 in each treatment arm) complete the 
study .  For the purposes of this study , a subject completes the study  when all scheduled 
procedures shown in the Schedule of Act ivities (Secti on 2) have been completed .
5.3. End of Study Definition
End of the study is the date of the last visit or last scheduled procedure shown in the Schedule o f 
Activities(Secti on 2) for the last subject.
5.4. Scientific Rationale for Study Design
Conducting the study  in healt hy subjects mit igates the potenti al confounding effects of the 
disease state and concomitant medi cations in pat ients.  A populat ion of healt hy subjects is 
frequently used in the assessment of the relative bioavailabilit y of both sm
all and l arge 
molecules.  
Single doses of ixekizumab and the PK sampling time points have been selected to generate P K
profiles sufficient to fulfill the study  object ives.  
I1F-MC-RHCT (b)Clinical Pharmacology Protocol Page 18
Ixekizumab (LY2439821)A parallel -group desi gn ischosen because a crossover design is impract ical for ixekizumab, 
which has a half -life o f approximately  13 days .  Addi tionally , a crossover study  coul d confound 
PK data if subj ects develop neutralizing antidrug ant ibodies (ADAs) .  
5.5. Justification for Dose
The recommended dose for Pspatients is [ADDRESS_601889] ion (two [ADDRESS_601890] ions) at 
Week 0, fo llowed by [CONTACT_1629] 80- mg injection at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12, then [ADDRESS_601891] (b)Clinical Pharmacology Protocol Page 19
Ixekizumab (LY2439821)6.Study  Population
Eligibilit y of subjects for the study  will be based on the results of a screening medical history , 
PE, vital s igns, clinical laboratory  tests, and ECG .  
The nature of any condit ions present at the time of the PEand any preexist ing condit ions will be 
docum ented.   Screening and/or Day  -1laboratory  testing may  be repeated once at the di scret ion 
of the invest igator for any out of range results.  
Screening may occur up to 28 day sprior to enrollment .  Subj ects who are not enrolled within 
28days of screening may  be subjected to an addit ional medical assessment and/or clinical 
measurements to confirm their eligibilit y.
Prospective approval o f protocol  deviati ons to recrui tment and enro llment criteria, also known as 
protocol  waivers or exempt ions, are not permitted.
6.1. Inclusion Criteria
Subject s are eligible for inclusio n in the study  only if they  meet all  of the f ollowing criteria at 
screening and /orDay -1:
[
1] a re overtly healt hy males or females, as determined by  [CONTACT_469494], or m ales and females with chronic stable medi cal problems 
that, in the invest igators opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n, will not place the subject at increased risk by 
[CONTACT_469495], and will not interfere with interpretation of the data .
[1a] male subjects:
agree to use a reliable method of birth control and to not donate sperm 
during the study  and f or [ADDRESS_601892] dose of ixekizumab.
Examples of reliable methods of birth control are condoms wit h spermicide, 
oral contraceptives or intrauterine device used by  [CONTACT_9283], and 
male sterilizat ion.
Subjects who are abstinent (if this is complete abstinence, as their preferred 
and usual lifest yle) or in a same -sex relati onship (as part of their preferred 
and usual lifest yle) must agree to either maintain abst inence or stay  in a 
same -sex relationship wi thout sexual relat ionships with females.  Periodic 
abstinence, declarat ion of abst inence just for the duration of the trial, and

[1b] female subjects:
1)Women of childbearing potentia lmust test negative for pregnancy prior 
to init iation of treatment as indicated by  a negat ive serum pregnancy test at 
the screening visit fo llowed by a negat ive urine pregnancy  test on Day  
-1.
2) Wom en of  child bearing potenti al who are abstinent (if this is co mplete 
abstinence, as their preferred and usual lifest yle) or in a same sex 
relationship (as part of their preferred and usual lifest yle) must agree to

relationships wit h males,and agree to use a condom wit h spermicide should 
the situation change .  Peri odic abst inence (eg, calendar, ovulat ion, 
symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), decl aration of abst inence just for 
the duration of a study ,and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of 
contraception.
3) Otherwise, women of child bearing potenti al must agree to use [ADDRESS_601893] ive method (less than 1% failure rate) of contraception, or a 
combinat ion of [ADDRESS_601894] ive methods of co ntracepti on (such as male or 
female condo ms with spermicide, diaphragms wit h spermicide, or cervical 
sponges) will be used.  The subject may  choose to use a doubl e
-barrier 
method of contraception.  Barrier protection methods without concomitant 
use of a spermicide are not a reliable or acceptable method.  Thus, each 
barrier m ethod m ust include the use of a spermicide.  It should be noted that 
the use of male and female condo ms as a double -barrier m ethod is not 
considered acceptable due to the high failure r ate when these methods are 
combined.
4) Wom en not of child bearing potenti al may participate and include those 
who are:

Unblinded Site Personnel will be responsible for handling and administering IP.  Unblinded Site 
Personnel are also responsible to make sure subjects remain blinded to treatment (i.e., subjects 
must not see the sy ringe before, during or after the drug admin istrati on).
7.2. Method of Treatment Assignment
Subjects will be rando mly assigned to [ADDRESS_601906]’s electronic case report form 
(eCRF).
7.3. Blinding
Blinding will be in place for subjects and for site staff conduct ing inject ion-site assessments and 
inject ion-site bleeding /bruising assessments.
7.4. Dose Modification
Dose m odificat ion is not permitted in this study .
7.4.1. Special Treatment Considerations 
All biological agents carry  the risk of systemic allergic/hypersensit ivity reacti ons.  Clinical  
manifestations of these reactions may include, but are not limit ed to skin rash, pruritus (itching), 
urticaria (hives), angioedema (eg, swelling of the lips and/or tongue), and anaphylact ic react ion.  
Sometimes these react ions can be life -threatening.  Proteins may  also cause redness, itching, 
swelling, or pain locally at the inject ion site.  Therefore, all subjects should be closely  monitored 
for signs or symptoms that could result from such reactions, be educated on the signs or 
symptoms of these ty pes of  react ions, and be instructed to contact [CONTACT_469500] m the CR U.  If a subject experiences an 
acute allergic/hypersensit ivity react ion after an injection of IP, he or she should be managed 
appropriately  and receive rel evant supportive care.  The event should be recorded as an AE.  
7.5. Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accou ntability
Invest igational product will be stored refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) in its original 
carton to protect from light.  Invest igational product should not be frozen or shaken.  
Sites will be required to monitor thetemperature of the on -site storage condi tions of  the IP.  The 
investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature condit ions have been maintained, 
I1F-MC-RHCT (b)Clinical Pharmacology Protocol Page 28
Ixekizumab (LY2439821)as communicated by [CONTACT_456], during transit for all IP received and ensure any discrepancies 
are reported and resolved before use of the study  treatm ent.
Only participants enro lled in the study  may receive IP or study  materials, and only authorized 
site staff may supply IP.  All IP should be stored in an environmentally  controlled and m onitored 
(manual  or autom ated) area in accordance with the labeled storage condit ions wit h access limited 
to the invest igator and authorized site staff.
The invest igator is responsible for study treatment accountabilit y, reconciliat ion, and record 
maintenance (such as receipt, reconciliat ion, and final disposit ion records).
7.6. Treatment Compliance
The IPwill be administered at the clinical site, and documentation of treatment admini strati on 
will occur at the site .
7.7. Concomitant Therapy
Subjects on stable conco mitant m edicat ion at th e time of study  entry  shoul d cont inue their 
regul ar, unchanged dose throughout the study .  Permi tted concomi tant m edicat ions include oral 
contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy , and thyroid replacement at the discret ion of the 
investigator.   In addit ion, o ccasional acetaminophen is acceptable at the di scret ion of the 
investigator. However, acetaminophen should not be administered on the dosing day  within 
4hours prior to the inject ion and until at least [ADDRESS_601907] ion.  No m ore than 3 g o f 
acetaminophen will be permitted in any  24-hour peri od.  Inclusio n of subjects on any  other 
concomitant medicat ion (for exam ple, statins and ant i-hypertensives) is contingent upon 
approval  following consultat ion with the Sponsor.
Subjects will be restrict ed fro m applying any  creams or l otions on the abdo minal skin the 
morning pri or to inject ion and for [ADDRESS_601908] (CP)or Clinical Research Physician ( CRP ).  Any  medicati on used during the 
course of the study  must be docum ented.
7.8. Treatment After the End of the Study
This sect ion is not applicable for this study .
I1F-MC-RHCT (b)Clinical Pharmacology Protocol Page 29
Ixekizumab (LY2439821)8.Discontinuation Criteria
Subjects discont inuing fro m the study  prematurely for any  reason shoul d com plete AE and other 
Day 85/ED procedures per Section 2of this protocol .
8.1. Discontinuation from Study Treatment
Not applicable in this single -dose study .
8.1.1. Discontinuation of Inadvertently Enrolled Subjects
If the sponsor or invest igator ident ifies a subject who did not m eet enrollment cri teria and was 
inadvertent ly enro lled, a discussio n must occur between the Lilly  CP/CRP and the invest igator to 
determine if the subject may cont inue in the study .  If both agree i t is medically appropriate to 
continue, the invest igator must obtain documented approval fro m the Lilly CP/CRP to allow the 
inadvertent ly enro lled subject to continue in the study .  
8.2. Discontinuation from the Study
Subjects will be discont inued in the fo llowing ci rcum stances:
Enrollment in any other clinical study  involving an IPor enrollment in any other ty pe of 
medical research judged not to be scient ifically or medically co mpat ible with this study
prior to recei ving IP in this study .  If the subject has received IP, they  will cont inue to be 
monitored for safet y for the pl anned durati on of  the study   
Parti cipation in the study  needs to be stopped for medical, safet y, regul atory , or other 
reasons consistent with a pplicable l aws, regul ations, and Good Clinical Practice
Invest igator Decisio n
othe invest igator decides that the subject should be discontinued from the study
Subject Decisio n
othe subject ,or legal representative ,requests to be withdrawn from the study .
8.3. Subjects Lost to Follow -up
A subject will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedly  fails to return for scheduled 
visits and is unable to be con tacted by  [CONTACT_4145].  Site personnel are expected to make 
diligent attempts to contact [CONTACT_469501] a scheduled visit or were otherwise 
unable to be fo llowed up by  [CONTACT_779].

Secti on 2lists the Schedule of Act ivities, detailing the study  procedures and their timing 
(including tolerance limit s for timing).
Appendix [ADDRESS_601909] igator.
After the informed consent form ( ICF) is signed, s tudy site personnel  will record ,initially via 
source documents and then via eCRF ,the occurrence and nature of each subject’s preexist ing 
condi tions.  Addit ionally , site personnel  will record any  change in the condi tion(s) and the 
occurrence and nature of any AEs.  
The invest igator will interpret and document whether or not anAE has a reasonab lepossib ility 
of being related to study trea tmentor a study  procedure, taking into account the disease, 
concomitant treatment or pathologies.  
A “reasonable possibilit y”means that there is a potenti al cause and effect relat ionship between 
the IPand/or study procedure and the AE.
Planned surgeries should not be reported as AEs unless the underlying medical condit ion has 
worsened during the course of the study .
I1F-MC-RHCT (b)Clinical Pharmacology Protocol Page 31
Ixekizumab (LY2439821)9.2.1. Serious Adverse Events
An SAE is any  AE from this study  that resul ts in one of the fo llowing:
death
initial or prolonged inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094]
a life- threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying)
persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y
congenital ano maly/birth defect
important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death 
or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_469488] m ay jeopardi zethe subject or may requi re interventi on to prevent 
one of the other outcomes listed in the definit ion above.
Study  site personnel  must al ert the Lilly  CRP/CP, or i ts desi gnee, of  any SAE as soon as 
pract ically possible.
Addi tionally, study site personnel  must al ert Lilly Global Patient Safet y,or its desi gnee ,of any 
SAE wi thin [ADDRESS_601910] igators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in subjects once they hav e 
discontinued from and/or com pleted the study  (the subject summary electroni c case report form 
[eCRF]has been co mpleted).  However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, 
at any  time after a subject has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event 
reasonably  possibly  related to the study  treatm ent or study  parti cipat ion, the investigator must 
prom ptly notify Lilly .  
Pregnancy (maternal or paternal exposure to IP) does not meet the definit ion of an AE.  
However, to fulfill regulatory  requi rements any  pregnancy  should be reported following the SAE 
process to collect dat a on the outcome for both mother and fetus.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events of Special Interest
The fo llowing AEs of special interest will be used to determine the safet y and tol erabilit y of 
ixekizumab inject ions administered by [CONTACT_469502] .
Adverse events of special interest for ixekizumab are:
cytopeni as (leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocy topeni a)
liver funct ion test changes/enzyme elevat ions (alanine aminotransferase [ ALT ], aspartate 
aminotransferase [ AST ], total bilirubin level [ TBL ], and alkaline ph osphatase [ ALP])
infect ion
I1F-MC-RHCT (b)Clinical Pharmacology Protocol Page 32
Ixekizumab (LY2439821)ISRs
allergic reactions/hypersensit ivities
cerebrocardiovascular events
malignancies
depressio n
inflammatory  bowel  disease (Crohn’s disease and ulcerat ive co litis)
interstitial lung disease
If infections, or allergic/hypersensit ivity react ions are reported, these will be recorded as AEs .  
Invest igators will also educate subjects about the symptoms of allergic/hypersensit ivity reacti ons 
and will provide instructions on dealing with these reactions.  A blood sample will be co llected
when possible for any subject who experiences an AE of allergic/hypersensit ivity react ion during 
the study .
Inject ion-site reacti ons will  be recorded as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]
Data on cerebrocardiovascular events (defined as death, myocardial infarct ion, stroke, 
hospi [INVESTIGATOR_34069], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19934], coronary  revascularizat ion 
proce dure, peripheral revascularization procedure, cardiogenic shock due to myocardial 
infarction, resuscitated sudden death, serious arrhythmia, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_469489], and 
peripheral  arteri al event) will be collected and the events may be adjudicate d by [CONTACT_469503] (CEC) m ade up of a chair, [ADDRESS_601911].  
Data on suspected inflammatory  bowel  disease, as ident ified by [CONTACT_223973]’s disease, will be co llecte d.  The events may be adjudicated by  [CONTACT_469504].  
The rol e of the CECs is to adj udicate defined clinical events, in a blinded, consistent, and 
unbiased manner throughout the course of a study.  The importance of the CECs is to ensure that 
all events that have been reported are evaluated uniformly by a single group.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
Suspected unexpected serious adverse react ions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are seri ous events that are not listed 
in the IB and that the investigator reports as related to IPor procedure.  Lilly  has procedures that 
will be fo llowed f or the recording and expedited reporting of S[LOCATION_003]Rs that are consistent with 
global regulat ions and the as sociated detailed guidances.
9.2.2. Complaint Handling
Lilly co llects product complaints on IPsand drug delivery  systems used in clinical studies in 
order to ensure the safet y of study  partici pants, m onitor quali ty, 
and to facilitate process and

Ixekizumab (LY2439821)9.4.3. Electrocardiograms
For each subject, a single 12 -lead ECG should be collected according to the Schedule of 
Activities (Section 2).  
Electrocardiograms must be recorded before collecting any blood samples.
  Subjects must be 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_17044]  [ADDRESS_601914] igational site.
Electrocardiograms will be interpreted by  a qualified physician ( the investigator or qualified 
designee) at the site as soon af ter the time of ECG collect ion as possible, and ideally while the 
subject is st ill present, to determine whether the subject meets entry criteria at the relevant 
visit(s) and for immediate subject management, should any clinically relevant findings be 
identified.  
9.4.4. Temperature
Body  temperature (oral) will be assessed at the times indicated in the Schedule of Act ivities 
(Secti on 2).
9.4.5. Other Tests
[IP_ADDRESS]. Injection- Site Assessments
Inject ion-site assessments will be performed at the times indicated in the Schedule of Activit ies 
(Secti on2).
If the invest igator deter mines that the ISR is clinically significant, or if a subject indicates 
symptoms are indicat ive of an ISR (unsolicited event; vo lunteered by  [CONTACT_1130]) , the event will be 
captured as an AE.  
Induration, swelling, prurit us, and ery thema/redness associated wi th study  inject ion sites will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_1719].
[IP_ADDRESS]. Bleeding/Bruising Assessment
All injecti on si tes will  be observed at the times indicated in the Schedule of Act ivities (Section 2) 
by [CONTACT_1719], and the presence of visible bleeding/bruising will be recorded on 
the eCRF.  A bandage may be placed on the inject
ion site after assessment.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Injection- Site Pain
Pain m easurements will be quant ified using the 100- mm VAS pain score for all subjects.  The 
VAS is a well -validated tool (Wi lliamso n and Hoggart 2005) to assess injection -site pain; i t is 
presented as a 100 -mm line anchored by  [CONTACT_469505], usually  “no pain” and “wors t 
imaginable pain.”  The subject will be asked to relate any  pain at the inject ion site on a scale of 
1to 100 mm on the line immediately (within 1minute) fo llowing inject ion and at the addit ional
time points listed in the Schedule of Act ivities (Section 2).  
I1F-MC-RHCT (b)Clinical Pharmacology Protocol Page 35
Ixekizumab (LY2439821)[IP_ADDRESS]. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale
Columbia Suici de Severi ty Rating Scale (C -SSRS):  A scale that captures the occurrence, 
severit y, and frequency  of suicidal ideation and/or behavior during the assessment period.  The 
scale includes suggested questions to solicit the type of informat ion needed to determine if 
suicidal ideation and/or behavior occurred.  Any  occurrence of suicide -related th oughts and 
behaviors will be assessed at the times indicated in the Schedule of Act ivities (Section 2) using 
the C-SSRS.  The C -SSRS is administered by  [CONTACT_469506] 1 y ear of pati ent care/clinical experience.
The nonleading AE collect ion shoul d occur pri or to the collect ion of the C -SSRS.  If a 
suicide-related event is discovered during the C -
SSRS but was not captured during the 
nonleading AE collect ion, sites shoul d not change the AE form.  If an event is serious or leads to 
discontinuat ion, this is an except ion where the SAE and/or AE leading to discont inuat ion should 
be included on the AE form and the process for reporting SAEs should be fo llowed.  The fi rst 
time the scale is administered in this study , the C -SSRS ‘Baseline –Screening’ versi on will be 
used, and the findings will const itute the baseline assessment.  The C -SSRS ‘Since Last Visit ’ 
scale will be used for all subsequent assessments.  The Lilly Self -Harm  Supplement shoul d be 
completed every  time the C -SSRS is administered.  If ther e are posit ive findings on the 
Self-Harm Suppl ement, then the Lilly  Self-Harm  Follow-Up form will be used to collect 
additional information to all ow for a m ore com plete assessment of these behaviors.

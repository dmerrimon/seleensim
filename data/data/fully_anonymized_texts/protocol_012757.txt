6. Evaluate the pathologist -to-pathologist precision overall and within diag nostic category  within each site 
and for each modality (inter -reader/intra- site/intra -modality precision).  
PRIMARY ENDPOINT  
• The primary endpoint is the indicator of major discordance in primary diagnosis between ground truth 
case diagnosis and case diagno sis by [CONTACT_392861], WSI and Glass.  
METHODOLOGY  
Cases will be selected in consecutive order by [CONTACT_392862] , and the case distribution for that site.  Upon confirmation 
of enrollment, the slides necessary to make the diagnosis will be selected and included in the set of slides 
available to the reading pathologists.  Additional slides for the case will be excluded .  The original primary 
diagnosis reported in the clinical file for each case will be the Ground Truth (GT) diagnosis.  
Each pathologist will read each case enrolled at their site by [CONTACT_392863] (Glass) and by 
[CONTACT_392864], including the correct subtype of the lesion/neoplasm, and related

 parameters (e.g. , tumor subtype, tumor grade, margin status, lymph node involvement ), if appropriate.  The order 
of reading by [CONTACT_392865] ; and, readings by [CONTACT_392866] a 
minimum of 4 weeks washout period.  
Upon completion of a reading at a site, two independent adjudicating pathologists will compare the primary 
diagnosis obtained using WSIs and using Glass to the GT diagnosis to determine if there is any discrepancy.  Any 
mismatch will be further judged as major or minor based on pre-specified case rules cited in the literature to 
categorize a “ discordance” into pre -designated categories and to decide if the dis cordance  would have led to a 
change in patient treatment  (i.e., major) or non e at all (i.e., minor) .  If the two  adjudicating pathologists  do not 
agree  on a “major” discordance , a 3rd independent pathologist shall review the case  to determine m ajority 
agreement or  if a consensus meeting of all three  adjudicators is required.  
NUMBER OF CASE S 
A total of [ADDRESS_493060] 90% power to demonstrate non -inferiority of WSI to Glass with a non -
inferiority margin of δ= 4% and type I error of 5%,  if in fact WSI is non -inferior to Glass.

DEVICE DE SCRIPTION  
Hamamatsu S360 MD NanoZoomer Slide Scanner Digital Pathology System (NanoZoomer) is an automated 
digital slide creation, viewing, and management system.  
The H amamatsu NanoZoomer S360 MD Digital Slide Scanner creates diagnostic quality digital images of glass 
slides containing FFPE tissue.  Each image typi[INVESTIGATOR_264513], creating a digital image of 
the tissue on the original glass slide.  The NanoZoomer captures digital images of entire slides for duplication, 
annotation, storage, retrieval, image sharing and viewing to permit the pathologist to make a primary diagnosis 
without needing to view those glass slides through a light microscope.  
STATISTICAL METHODS  
All Available Population (AAP)  is defined as all cases for which at least one out of four  reader s provides an 
evaluable outcome for either the  WSI or Glass modalit y and will be used for the primary analysis.   
For the primary objective of demonstrating the WSI major discordance rate to be non -inferior to the Glass major 
discordance rate, a Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) logistic regression will be conducted.  The 
dependent variable will be the major discordance status (yes/no) and the independent variables will include 
modality (WSI or Glass) as a fixed effect and site, reader, and case as random effects.  From this model a two -
sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference in major discordance rate ( πWSI – πGlass) will be 
constructed.  If the upper bound of the 95% CI is less than the non- inferiority margin of 4%, then WSI would be 
considered non -inferior to Glass.

2. INTRODUCTION  
2.1 Background  
Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) has emerg ed as an alternative way to view pathology slides for primary 
diagnosis instead  of the conventional method of viewing slides of tissue under a traditional light 
microscope.  There is growing adoption of the use of WSI for primary diagnosis in many countries (1-4).  
WSI is  particularly advantageous for remote consultation over vast geographical regions where 
pathologist s are not available, and for easier archiving of images of slide material that may have longer 
shelf life in digital form.  In the U nited States, WSI is increasingly used for teaching, archiving, 
consultation , and research .  Furthermore,  the College of American Pathologist s (CAP) has published 
recommendation s to pathologists who wish to validate WSI in their clinical practices (5 ).  
However, quite recently, in a de novo authorization letter (6) and device summary (7 ), the Food and Drug 
Administration ( FDA) has announced the authorization  of the Philips IntelliSite Pathology Solution 
(PI[INVESTIGATOR_58027])  for use of WSI for primary diagnosis , specifically permitting WSI  for in -vitro diagnostic use as an 
aid to the pathologist to review and interpret digital images of surgical pathology slides prepared from 
formalin -fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue, but not intended for use with frozen section, cytology, 
or non-FFPE hematopatholog y specimens.

 Thus, the authorization of the Philips device for primary diagnosis, PI[INVESTIGATOR_264516] , serves as the predicate 
device for any future 510( k) submissions for WSI system s seeking clearance for intended use of WSI, 
and, further, the FDA has indicated t hat a clinical study to prove non-inferiority of WSI device is a 
“special control ” required to acquire that clearance.  
Hamamatsu is developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a digital slide scanner system, the NanoZoomer S360 MD Digital Slide Scanner 
System (NanoZoomer) , for the same in tended use  as the PI[INVESTIGATOR_264516] .  Thus, Hamamatsu will make the 
submission in the form of a 510(k) premarket notification with the P IPS device as the predicate device 
and will accordingly adhere to the special controls that are established .  Hamamatsu  will f ollow similar 
study designs to test the NanoZoomer  system , and intends to use the data from this non-significant risk 
study for the 510(k ) submission to clear its NanoZoomer system for the same intended use.  Additional 
study design input became available from FDA presubmission review of protocol ( 20-25)  
2.[ADDRESS_493061] review  of light microscopy (LM) of glass slide s (8-10).   Many 
variations of experiment al design are discussed encompassing topi[INVESTIGATOR_392848], 
concordance comparison, time necessary for washout period, targets for assessment of non -inferiority, 
sample size, choice of organ systems, effects of pre-training, adjudication of ma jor and minor 
discrepancy, etc.  
The CAP  has published guidelines for pathology practices interested in using such technology for primary 
diagnosis ( 5).  This society tried to standardize the metho dologies for pathologist s to consider for 
validation of WSI  for primary diagnosis, further touching on the same study factors for consideration.  
The FDA has been in close communication with leading pathologi sts in the field of digital pathology on 
the design of studies to support WSI for primary diagnosis, as well as the major vendors interested in 
pursuing that application, mainly through the Digital Pathology Association (DPA ).  The FDA has 
published guidance for technical specification ( 11).  Yet, for clinical validation, the FDA has presented 
the Agency thinking on clinical validation protocol considerations in two PowerPoint presentations ( 12-
13), touching on the kinds of cases to be tested, as well as the number of sites, pathologists and cases to 
be tested.  
Quite recently, the FDA has announced the de novo authorization of the PI[INVESTIGATOR_392849] a clearance letter (6 ) and device summary ( 7), which included more information 
on the design, conduct , and acceptance criteria for the non -inferiority study used to acquire clearance.    
Hamamatsu is closely following the scientific study design and performan ce targets that were used by 
[CONTACT_191731].  
2.3 Risk/Benefit:  
Since this is  a retrospective examination of cases, there is no apparent risk or benefit to the patient whose 
case is being used for the study.    
Because this study design does not call for the re -assessm ent of the primary diagnosis of the retrospective 
case, we do not envision a situation in which the original diagnosis will be questioned and reassigned.  
Hamamatsu NanoZoomer S360MD Digital Slide Scanner System

©[ADDRESS_493062] 1 year old, we do not see any n eed to 
notify the patient as protocol does not call for any change in diagnosis.   
In the future, the device itself offers significant potential benefits, particularly for remote viewing of case 
material in geographies where pathologists are sparsely present.  
3. OBJECTIVES  AND ENDPOINTS  
3.1 Primary Objective :   
1. To evaluate the safety and accuracy of the Hamamatsu WSI test method compared to that of the 
reference method (conventional light microscope  [Glass] ) under clinical use conditions.

each pathologist  
• The percentage agreement for each  diagnostic category and overall between each pair of readers 
within a site for a given modality (WSI or Glass).  
4. STUDY DESIGN 
4.1 Overall Design  
The study is  a multi-site, randomized -read order, retrospective, paired -design evaluation of the 
Hamamatsu NanoZoomer S360MD Slide Scanner system consisting of a review of archived, de-identified 
and previously signed-out  slides representing main organ systems within surgical pathology.  Cases will 
include retrospective hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained formalin fixed tissue, and special stains 
and/or immunohistochemical stains (most commonly used is the brown chromophor e) from the pathology 
practice, but will not include frozen sections, or cytological and hematological cases.  
A total of 2000 cases consisting of multiple organ and tissue types will be enrolled.  Cases will be divided over four (4) site s.  At each site, f our pathologists will read all the cases assigned to their site using both 
WSI and Glass modalities in a randomized order and with a washout period of  at least  four weeks 
between  readings , resulting in a total of 8000 planned WSI reads and 8000 planned Gla ss reads.  A fter 
any completed reader diagnosis case report form ( CRF ) at a site has been collected and cleaned and the 
CRF  is completed , two adjudicators will review the reader’s diagnosis against the original diagnosis 
(ground truth) to determine whether the new and original diagnos es were concordant, minor discordant , or 
major discordant.   A third adjudicator will be used, if disagreement occurs between the first two  
adjudicators  on the classification of a “major” discrepancy . If all three adjudication results differ, a 
meeting will be held to reach consensus among the three adjudicators.  Figure [ADDRESS_493063] ( 14), Digital

5. ADJUDICATION COMMITTEE  
A panel of expert pathologists will convene to establish a charter with clear pre-established rules of 
adjudication for each type of case listed in Table 2.  Each case category from FDA list will have an 
adequate description of what constitutes a match, a minor discordance and a major discordance according 
to the definitions of major and minor discordance provided in Table 3. These pre-adjudication rules shall 
also specify that all deferrals shall be considered as minor or major discordances per application of 
adjudication rules for deferral s. A panel of adjudicators independent of the site  shall be selected and 
trained on these rules.  
The committee to establish the pre -adjudication rules shall classify discordant results according to the 4 
harm  categories ( 18) as shown in Table [ADDRESS_493069] led to a 
change in patient care or treatment plan.  Any discordance not leading to a change in treatment will be 
considered as a “minor” discordance and considered a match.  Any discordancy leading to a change in 
treatment plan for the patient would be judged as a “major” discordance, and therefore considered to not 
be a match.   
6. INCLUSION A ND EXCLUSION CRITERIA

Sponsor should include a sufficient number of difficult and challenging diagnoses in the larger (>100) groups  
 
The total number of cases is to be 2000.  The total cases are to be subdivided among the  four (4) 
independent clinical sites (academic, community hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and private laboratories.)  E ach site will be 
assigned cases consistent with the types of cases read at that site and from the cases listed in Table 2.  The 
cases will be selected from actual cases diagnosed at that practice and taken from  that site’s own database.  
However, it may be impractical for some sites to have sufficient cases of all  types required under the 
protocol.   In such eventuality, the PI s will review any gaps in cases enrolled across the study and propose 
adjustments of allotted cases at certain sites where some unbalance with  respect to all numbers of cases 
for certain sites may occur. However, each site will enroll at least [ADDRESS_493075] been collected.  
6.2.1 Inclusion criteria:  
Cases are eligible to be included in the study only if all of the following criteria apply:  
• Cases originating from and that w ere diagnosed at that local site  
• Cases are available in the  site’s archive  
• Cases are at least 1 year old since accessioning  
• Cases are selected because their primary diagnosis is consistent with the assigned target 
categor ies listed in Table 2 
• Cases have a set of slides representative of the primary diagnosis for which it has been selected 
(see below for slide selection  criteria ). 
Slide selection for a given case must meet the following criteria:  
• Slide is obtained by [CONTACT_392877]  
• Slides must be stained with H&E and accompanying special stains (histochemical and/or immunohistochemical)  
• All special stains slides (histochemical and/or immunohistochemical) where the slide and stain  is 
used for diagnosis, not prognosis.

©2018  Hamamatsu Photonics K.K.       Confidential        23 of 46 
 
 • A chosen slide must demonstrate and be representative of the primary diagnosis; 1 H&E slide 
selection may suffice for biopsy cases,   
• For resection cases, a minimum o f 5 H&E slides must be selected, which r epresent the primary 
diagnosis. If represented with less than 5 H&E slides, additional H&E slides (primary, secondary, 
or benign slides) from same case may be used to fulfill minimum number  
• Slide is intact, has correct size/thickness, good edges, undamaged coverslip, without pen 
markings  that can’t be removed , no air bubbles, tidy labels , and fulfills the quality checks per the 
general clinical practice  
6.2.2 Exclusion criteria:  
Cases are excluded from the study if any of the following criteria apply:  
• Case does not have r elevant slides or if case information necessary for the study is missing  
• Case i s still active  (less than 1 year old) at the local site  
• Cases for which the control slid es for i mmunohistochemistry and special stains are not available  
• Two cases from same individual  
• Gross-only cases that have no slides 
• Cases that are frozen section, cytology or hematology or immunofluorescence specimens only  
• Case where t he only available set of slides have evidence only of secondary or no diagnoses and 
not the primary diagnosis for which the case is being screened . 
Slides for a given case will be excluded if they meet the following criterion:  
• Glass slide that is broken, has abnormal size/thi ckness, beveled edges, poor coverslip  (cracks, 
waviness, scratches) , is sticky, has many pen markings or dirt  that cannot be removed, contain s 
air bubbles and overhanging labels  that can’t be corrected , and if stain is severely faded . 
6.3 Withdrawal or Discont inuation  
6.3.1 Slide Withdrawal 
It is unlikely that slides will be withdrawn from the study after they satisfy inclusion and exclusion 
criteria.  However, if during the trial a slide somehow gets damaged or misplaced and cannot be used, or 
an inadvertent mix-up is discovered, this slide (or case) may be withdrawn and a protocol deviation noted.  
Such occurrence is expected to be very low. If necessary, another slide from the same case may need to 
be added or a new case may need to be enrolled in order to satisfy  the overall number of cases examined 
for the trial.  As long as the new slide does not change the recorded ground truth primary diagnosis and 
synoptic information of subtype, grade, margin and lymph node involvement, then the RP will not be 
asked to re -read cases already read. These events will be documented.

where the other pathologist left off, as long as the prior pathologist had completed reads for both 
modalities.  Th e primary analysis will use all readings by [CONTACT_392878]/previous pathologist, with the 
readings by [CONTACT_392879]/pre vious  reading 
pathologist did not read with both modalities . Such occurrence is expected to be very low, but there is 
some possibility of staff turnover at any location.  
7. DEVICE UNDER STUDY

 Figure 4.  Communication between Scanner and Display  
 
The Slide Scanner consists of the following blocks as shown above in Figure 4. 
• Slide Feeder: The slide feeder is manually loaded with glass slides and then transfers glass slides 
from the slide cassette to the macro scanning position using the mechanical hand.  
• Macro Scan: When the glass slide has moved to the macro image scanning position, the macro 
LED illuminates the slide and acquires the macro image of both specimen and barcode label.  The 
scanning area is automatically determined based on the macro imag e. 
• Micro Scan: After acquiring the macro image, the glass slide is moved to the micro image scanning position.   Then the micro LED illuminates the slide, and focusing points are 
automatically detected, and the scanning of micro images starts.  After the scanning has finished, 
the glass slide is moved back to the slide cassette.  
• Control Board: The control board controls both the micro and macro cameras together with the focusing lenses.

 7.2 General Principles of Operation  
The Hamamatsu NanoZoomer S360 MD Digital Slide Scanner (Figure 5) creates diagnostic quality digital 
images of glass slides containing FFPE tissue (11).   Each image typi[INVESTIGATOR_264523], creating a digital image of the tissue on the original glass slide.  The NanoZoomer captures digital 
images of entire slides for dup lication, annotation, storage, retrieval, image sharing , and viewing to permit 
the pathologist to make a primary diagnosis without needing to view those glass slides through a light 
microscope.  
The NanoZoomer can be loaded with as many  as [ADDRESS_493078] disc.  After scanning, the fully digitalized image can be observed with the 
viewing software.  
The computer controls the scanner via camera link and universal serial bus ( USB ) interface.  It also stores 
the images on a hard disk.  After the scanning has finished, the images can b e displayed on the 
computer’s monitor.  
The system software does not have any software application that does automated image analysis to aid in 
computer -aided detection of diagnosis.

The pathologist will be allowed to conduc t this trial diagnosis on [ADDRESS_493081] feels comfortable with 
the self -familiarization process, he or she may begin the study.  
8.3 Selection of C ase S lides  
The site coordinator and/or EP shall search through the site’s database to locate and withdraw from the 
archive the assigned number of consecutive cases starting with archival cases at least [ADDRESS_493082] -P001  Clinical Protocol for WSI Primary Diagnosis Non -Inferiority Study  
 
©[ADDRESS_493083] the FDA category information (i.e., organ, procedure, subtype, and 
category),  record the basic patient case note(s) that the reader pathologist will be presented with, to select 
the slides indicative of primary diagnosis  and to collect the supplemental diagnostic information and 
synoptic checklist information, where available in site pathology report , and relevant  to classification, 
subtype, grade, margin, status, etc .  The EP may c onsult with other pathologists within the site practice 
who may be subject matter experts in certain case categories, as long  as those pathologists are not r eader 
pathologists or VEPs.  This supplemental information will be in accordance with truncated CAP  cancer 
protocols (17) developed to highlight the key synoptic information to take into account later when reader 
pathologist makes study diagnosis . 
GT diagnosis is the primary diagnosis based on the original sign-out (reported) primary  diagnosis of cases 
that are enrolled in the study.   The ground truth will not be reestablished, and should not include 
secondary diagnoses.   Only a review of the final sign -out report (and not a review of the glass slides) will 
be used to record this information .  The original sign -out primary diagnosis (reported clinically) , as well 
as any supplemental diagnostic information, will be captured verbatim.  If site uses synoptic checklists in 
their pathology report, that information , too,  will be recorded.  
From those cases, the EP will choose the H&E slide  or set of H&E slide s in the case that are consistent 
with the primary diagnosis.  The followin g rules will be followed when selecting slides:  
• For biopsy cases, the EP will select at least the H&E slides representative of the primary 
diagnosis.  In most biopsy cases, this can be done with just 1 H&E slide , but the EP may choose 
more if needed to defi ne the diagnosis . To minimize selection bias, the EP shall select the first 
H&E slide that encompasses that primary diagnosis.   
• For resection cases, the EP  shall select the set of slides that are necessary to indicate the primary 
diagnosis, inclusive of the key CAP checklist abridged metrics of cancer type, grade, margins and 
if metastasized to  lymph node s.  
o If there are multiple levels, the EP may select on ly the level of the same block slide that is 
germane to the primary diagnosis.  
o To minimize selection bias, the EP shall choose the first available H&E slide that describes 
that condition (s), rather than the best slide.  
o A minimum of 5 H&E slides will be s elected. If the set of slides selected to define the 
prim ary diagnosis is < 5, then the EP shall continue to pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696] H&E slides until a minimum of [ADDRESS_493084].  
In addition, for any case where there are extra slides with special and/or immunochemical stains, the EP 
shall enroll all those, as long as th ese extra stains are used for making/confirming the diagnosis and not 
for prognosis  or to guide treatment (e.g. h uman epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] 2  [HER2 ] stain in breast 
cancer) . 
For enrolled slides, the EP shall remove all markings from the coverslip. If not possible, the slide shall be 
excluded, and another slide must be chosen.  
A priori  defined slide and case data rejection criteria have been  developed per the defined inclusion and 
exclusion criteria in section [ADDRESS_493085] -P001  Clinical Protocol for WSI Primary Diagnosis Non -Inferiority Study  
 
©2018  Hamamatsu Photonics K.K.       Confidential        31 of 46 
 
  
For every case enrolled, the EP shall make a determination if this case can be considered to be a “difficult 
and challenging” case. The EP will select “ difficult and challenging” when one or more of the following 
apply:  
• It’s professional opi[INVESTIGATOR_392853] “difficult and challenging”  
• Case used special stains or immunohistochemical stains to aid in diagnosis 
• Case used molecular tests to aid in diagnosis 
• Case used tumor boards to review case to aid in diagnosis 
• Other reason, and brief narrative to elaborate.  
The EP shall cap ture this information for every one of the [ADDRESS_493086] 
(VEP)  shall review and confirm the screening and enrollment selection of the EP.  If the VEP disagrees 
with the case or slide selection of the EP, then both the EP and VEP shall meet for consensus decision.  If 
agreement cannot be reached, then that case shall be disqualified.  
All enrolled ma terial and information shall be provided to the site coordinator for secure storage and to be 
kept blinded from reading pathologists . 
8.5 Storage of case slides   
The site coordinator shall :  
a. Collect and store the cases, slides and medical notes, clinical histo ry of the case, and final 
pathology report in a secure location,  
b. Place proper de-identification labels (e.g.,  hide names, numbers, barcodes) on slides with a code 
known only to the site coordinator, and confirm those labels will not interfere with the sca nning 
process nor affect the integrity of the tissue on the slide. The printer and label operations shall be 
validated before the study to prove the study labels do not interfere with the scanning process and 
are robust for the duration of the study, when the study labels can finally be removed and the material returned to the archive.  
c. Remove all patient identifiers and assign coded subject ID to protect patient privacy, and  
d. Ensure the traceability code -defining patient ID with study assigned code shall be kept only at the 
site, stored in a secure location, not shared outside the practice, and kept blinded to reading pathologists. 
8.6 Whole slide scanning o perations  
The SC shall deliver the slides to be scanned to the scanning technician.  
The scanning technician shall  receive the batch  of de-identified case slides to be scanned  from the site 
coordinator .  Then the technician shall : 
Hamamatsu NanoZoomer S360MD Digital Slide Scanner System  
HCT -P001  Clinical Protocol for WSI Primary Diagnosis Non -Inferiority Study  
 
©[ADDRESS_493087] shall read each case on a conventional light 
microscope (Reference Method; Glass) and on the Hamamatsu system (Test Method; WSI)  in an order 
randomly determined.  
RPs will receive from the site coordinator the slides and/or WSI images to be read. T he case study 
identification, patient age and gender, relevant supplemental clinical history, part and procedure 
information , and specimen gross description  in the EDC system in addition to corresponding slides (either 
glass or WSI ) will be available for RP viewing , but RP will never hav e access to the final sign -out 
diagnosis or GT information.  Pathologists  may not request re-scans of any slide. No additional slides 
from the case can be requested.  Reading Pathologists will not be permitted to order additional re -cuts or 
stains outside of what was cut /stained  during the original clinical review process (i.e., no additional slides 
will be created for the purpose of this study ) and selected by [CONTACT_392882] . 
All RPs will perform randomized (read -order) glass and WSI reads with a minimum [ADDRESS_493088] using glass slides and LM and then (following a 4 -week wash -out period) via WSI or vice 
versa.  All digital reads will be executed using the Hamamatsu Pathology workstation.  Pathologists will 
access the Hamamatsu system via secure login/password.   For viewing  by [CONTACT_392883], the pathologist shall use 
the light microscope that they normally use at that sit e.  
When the RP  reads the cases, all WSI and glass diagnoses, as well as supplement al information  based on 
truncated  CAP checklists developed for this study, will be entered into an eCRF using an EDC system.   
The RP will write a primary diagnosis in a nar rative text in their words .  
Next, the reader pathologist shall fill in an abridged CAP c hecklist to capture supplemental diagnostic 
information specif ic to each of the organ malignancy types in the study, if applicable .  The abridged 
checklist  will includ e only those items most relevant  to the patient’s management,  i.e., type, grade, 
margin and whether infiltration into lymph nodes .  The pathologist  may use information from an abridged

©[ADDRESS_493089]’s  diagnosis.  
Possibility of Deferral:  Reader must do her or his best effort to det ermine  a primary diagnosis . However 
if the reading pathologist feels strongly that he or she is not able to make a diagnosi s, then the  reader 
pathologist may rec ord that in the case report for m. The recording can be “defer ral to Glass”  in the case of 
WSI, or “ defer ral to speci alist” in either case of Glass or WSI.   
RPs will not be able to review eCRFs for which a diagnosis is finalized (case signed -out).  
8.[ADDRESS_493090] (AP) is part of an independent board of subject matter expert, board certified 
pathologists, who shall review and compare d iagnos es on WSIs and on Glass to the GT,  the original 
diagnosis that was rendered in the clinical practice.   The AP(s) shall not be presen ted with the slides or 
WSI images. The adjudicators shall be presented only with the ground truth primary diagnosis  and 
synoptic information, the patient case notes available to the reading pathologist, and the reading 
pathologist primary diagnosis  and supplemental CAP checklist  records . 
When the adjudicator is presented with a case to adjudicate, the 1st and 2nd adjudicator  will independently 
review the case.   If a disagreement involving a major discordance is present between the [ADDRESS_493091] member, the 
majority choice will be selected . If there is no majority from the rulings of the 3 adjudicators, then the 
adjudi cation will proceed to a consensus meeting for final decision .

 where 𝜋𝜋𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊 and 𝜋𝜋𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺  are the major discordance rates for WSI and Glass respectively.  
9.2 Sample Size Calculations  
Assuming E{𝑑𝑑𝐺𝐺𝑙𝑙}=∆ and variance Var {𝑑𝑑𝐺𝐺𝑙𝑙 }=𝜎𝜎2 where 𝑑𝑑𝐺𝐺𝑙𝑙 is equal to average over differences of error 
rates between WSI and Glass compared to GT diagnosis  for case 𝑖𝑖 in site  𝑙𝑙, the following expression is 
applicable: 𝑛𝑛=�𝑍𝑍𝛼𝛼+𝑍𝑍𝛽𝛽�2(𝜎𝜎2)
(𝛿𝛿+∆)2�  
=�𝑍𝑍𝛼𝛼+𝑍𝑍𝛽𝛽�2𝜋𝜋′𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊(1−𝜋𝜋′𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊)𝜋𝜋′𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺 (1−𝜋𝜋′𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺 ){1−𝜆𝜆+(𝑟𝑟−1)(𝜉𝜉−𝜂𝜂)}
𝑟𝑟(𝛿𝛿+∆)2 
For which 𝜋𝜋′𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊 and 𝜋𝜋′𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺  are the probabilities that WSI and Glass methods agree (or minor 
discordance) with the GT  diagnosis classification retrospectively ; 𝜆𝜆 = Corr(𝑎𝑎 𝐺𝐺𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙1,𝑎𝑎𝐺𝐺𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙2) , the correlation 
between the classifications for the two modalities by [CONTACT_336601] ; 𝜉𝜉  = Corr(𝑎𝑎 𝐺𝐺𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙,𝑎𝑎𝐺𝐺𝑙𝑙𝚥𝚥′̇𝑙𝑙), the 
correlation between two reader s for a given modality;  and, η = Corr(𝑎𝑎 𝐺𝐺𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙1,𝑎𝑎𝐺𝐺𝑙𝑙𝚥𝚥′̇2), the correlation between 
two modalities and between two read ers. 
Assuming power = (1−β)=0.90, α = 5% two -sided, a non-inferiority margin of 𝛿𝛿, a true difference 
between proportions of WSI and Glass equal to ∆ in favor of Glass, number of readers r = 4 and number

This table shows, a total of 2000  cases will provide more than  90% power to demonstrate non-inferiority 
of WSI to Glass with a non -inferiority margin of 4% as long as the proportion of agreements with Ground 
Truth is at least 60%, λ is at least 0.5, (ξ -η) is at most 0.1 5, and ∆ ≥ -1.5%.   
9.3 Populations for Analyses  
All Available Population (AAP) : AAP includes all cases for which at least one reader provides an 
evaluable outcome for either  the WSI or Glass modalit y where an outcome is considered evaluable if the 
adjudication committee is able to classify the diagnosis as concordan t, minor discordant,  or major 
discordan t with the Ground Truth diagnosis .  If a reading pathologist is unable to complete study reads, a 
replacement pathologist may be selected by [CONTACT_392884], the re-reads by [CONTACT_392885], and the primary analysis will use all readings by [CONTACT_392878]/previous pathologist, with

9.4.2 Primary Analysis of Non -inferiority of WSI Relative to Glass  
The AAP will be used for the primary analysis.  To evaluate the major discordance rates between WSI 
and Glass, a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) logistic regression will be performed.  The indicator of major discordance (yes/no) will be the dependent vari able with modality (WSI or glass) , as a 
fixed effect; and site, reader and case entered into the model as random effects; glass will be the reference

 group. From this model , a two -sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference in major discordance 
rate (𝜋𝜋𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊 - 𝜋𝜋𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺 ) will be constructed.  If the upper bound of the 95% CI is less than the non-inferiority 
margin of 4%, then WSI will be considered non-inferior to Glass.  
A summary table will provide the number of  deferrals  and reasons for defe rral (e.g., deferral to 
specialist, deferral to glass, etc.). Cases with diagnosis deferred for at least one modality (excluding 
missing observations) will be excluded from the primary analys es. 
The point estimates and the corresponding two-sided 95% confidence intervals of the major discordance 
rates will be provided  separately for WSI and glass.  To support the clinical performance of NanoZoomer, 
the major discordance rate for WSI should not exceed 7%.    
 Sensitivity Analysis  
Sensitivity analyses will  be performed to evaluate the robustness of the results . All deferred plus missing 
data cases will be assumed as having major discordance with GT and included in the same MMRM 
logistic regression analysis as that of the primary analysis.   
 Generalizability for Readers and Sites

intervals for the major discordance rates and differences between the major discordance rates within each 
subgroup of interest  (site, organ, diagnostic category, and procedure type) will be provided . 
To evaluate the Intra-reader/Inter -modality (within reader, between modality) precision, with glass as the 
comparat or method, the percentage of overall agreement and 95% confidence intervals between the WSI 
and the Glass diagnostic  categories will be computed for each reader at each site separately.    
To evaluate the Inter -reader/Intra -modality (between reader, within modality) precision, with glass as the 
comparat or method, the percentage of agreement and 95% confidence intervals will be computed for each 
pair of readers at each site separately (6 pairwise comparisons per site).

11.1 Protocol Deviations  
A protocol deviation is defined as any change or alteration from the procedures stated in the clinical 
investigation plan, consent document, recruitment process, or study materials (e.g. questionnaires) that 
were originally approved by [CONTACT_392896].  
All protocol deviations must be reported to Hamamatsu or their authorized representatives ( CRO study 
monitors) through the protocol deviation log form. In addition, the Investigator is required to adhere to 
IRB of records’ procedures for reporting protocol deviations.  Deviations shall be documented in writing 
and maintained in the Investigator and clinical study management files.   
Per 21 CFR §812.140 (a) (4), Investigators are required to maintain accurate, complete and current 
records, including documentation showing the dates of, and reasons for, each deviation from the CIP.  
Failure to comply with the CIP may result in Investigator termination of participation [21 CFR §812.46 
(a)] in the current study.  
Repeated protocol deviations will lead to site retraining.  Continued deviation from the CIP may result in 
site or investigator suspension or disqualification and is at the discretion of the Sponsor.  Suspension and/or disqualification actions, including the rationale, will be documented . 
For protocol deviations, s tudy processes, including washout, modality read order , and matching of slides 
with correct case information will be closely managed.   A deviation will be filed for any case part that has 
missing, da maged , or broken slides.  These cases will be reviewed for consistency with the protocol 
across all Reading Pathologists.

PI [INVESTIGATOR_579566]-[ADDRESS_761329] cancer -related lymphedema (BCRL) 
is a common complication from breast ca ncer treatment, with reported frequencies 
ranging from 6% to 65% (1). This insufficiency in the lymphatic system leads to 
limb edema in early stages and progresses to thickened skin or fibrosis over time. As a result, persons afflicted with lymphedema are prone to develop impaired extremity function, recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_579567], lymphorrhea, unsatisfactory cosmesis, and a variety of psychological and social issues (2).  
There is currently no cure for lymphedema, thus treatme nt focuses on symptom 
management and improved patient-reported outcomes. Using a multimodal approach, accepted interventions include: limb elevation, MLD, compression therapy, skin hygiene, and in very severe cases , lymphatic exchange (3). Pneumatic 
Compre ssion  Devices  (PCDs) are a fairly recent addition to the armamentarium 
clinicians offer patients in the treatment of lymphedema. Studies have demonstrated continual use of PCDs is associated with a significant patient-reported improvement in overall symptoms, decreased limb -girth, decreased limb volume, increased 
elasticity of tissues, and fewer epi[INVESTIGATOR_496421] (4- 7).
  
Adherence to prescribed, at -home self -care is a critical factor in the treatment of 
lymphedema (8-9). Research shows PCD compliance diminishes over time (10). This study seeks to determine if active monitoring of device use information and patient reminders affects compliance. Additionally, there is limited data on how various compliance rates impact health outcomes. Therefore, this study also seeks to identify the impact compliance rates have on swelling, quality of life, and symptoms. 
 Device Description  
The Flexitouch Plus system (FT) (Tactile Medical ™, Minneapolis, MN, [LOCATION_003]) is an 
advanced pneumatic compression device clinically proven to stimulate the 
lymphatic system and is cleared for market in the [LOCATION_003] ( K203178, K170216, 
HCPCS code E0652). The device helps direct and move excess fluid from an impaired lymphatic region to healthy regions, where fluid can be absorbed and processed naturally by [CONTACT_10489]. Flexitouch Plus garment chambers inflate sequentially with each chamber inflating before the adjacent distal chamber fully deflates. This creates a dynamic wave of therapy that directs fluid into the lymphatic capi[INVESTIGATOR_579568] s while maintaining distal pressure to prevent distal backflow.  
The Flexitouch Plus system consists of two primary components: the controller unit and garments.  
The controller unit is a programmable pneumatic compressor with four connector 
outlets. Each connector has eight outflow ports that garment hoses plug into. Air passes through the hoses, delivering treatment through the sequential inflation and deflation of up to 32 air chambers in the garments. By [CONTACT_579578], calibrated gradient pressure is delivered to the chambers and assists in moving excess fluid out of the affected limb(s).  
  Version 4.0 
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 9 of 25  
 
The air -chambered garments are made of soft,  pliable fabric. They are designed to 
fit the contours of the body by [CONTACT_6406][INVESTIGATOR_579569](s) and attaching with hook 
and loop fasteners. A variety of upper and lower extremity treatment options are available. The pressure setting is variable between “decreased,” “normal ,” and 
“increased.” Individual chamber pressures may also be individually adjusted. 
The novel FT-CC is identical to the Flexitouch Plus with the exception of an addition of a cellular communication module to the controller unit which tra nsmits 
device usage data to a cloud -based database accessible to the study sponsor. This 
data will be used by [CONTACT_579579]-CC ACTIVE group that have not used their device for 2 consecutive day s.   
The FT -CC will be labeled, “CAUTION – Investigational Device, Limited by 
[CONTACT_12201]” and each unit will have a unique serial number. The FT -CC is investigational only in that it has the cellular communication module; 
in all oth er aspects, including cleared intended use, FT- CC is the same as the 
currently marketed FT.  
 Study Objective  
The objective of the study is to demonstrate the feasibility of using the FT- CC to actively 
monitor device use data to: 
• Determine if patient reminde rs impact the rate of compliance  
• Identify the impact device compliance has on arm girth , quality of life, and 
symptoms.  
 Study Design  
This is a  multi-center, on label, prospective, randomized, two-arm, feasibility study (Figure 
1) comparing the PASSIVE FT- CC to ACTIVE FT -CC. A multi-center design is used to 
expedite the enrollment period and provide a broader sample of the study population. 
Randomization was incorporated into the study to determine if ACTIVE FT- CC affects 
device use.

 Point o f Enrollment and Randomization 
Subjects will be considered enrolled in the study once the Informed Consent Form (ICF) is signed and all inclusion/exclusion criteria are met. The investigator will keep a record, the subject screening log, of subjects who enter screening.  Any 
subjects who do not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be considered screen failures.  
Randomization codes will be generated by a statistician in a permuted block design. The block size will be balanced within each block and will maintain a 1:1 ratio between the treatment groups. The randomization assignment will be obtained from the electronic data capture (EDC) database and assigned sequentially as soon as a subject is considered enrolled.  
If a subject does not meet all the eligibility criteria or meets any of the exclusion 
criteria but is randomized in error, or incorrectly started treatment, the Investigator should inform Tactile Medical immediately.  
 Subject Discontinuation or Withdrawal  
Subject participation may be discontinued prior to study completion for any of the 
following reasons: 
• Withdrawal of Consent   Subjects may withdraw their cons ent to participate at any time.  If a subject 
withdraws consent, previous information that has already been obtained will be available for analysis.  
• Discretion of the Principal Investigator 
  [CONTACT_15261] 4.0 
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 12 of 25  
 
Subjects may be withdrawn at the investigator’s discretion in the event of 
changes in the subject’s health, or other reasons based on the investigator’s 
clinical judgment.  
When a subject withdraws prior to completing the study, the reason for withdrawal will be recorded . 
 Randomization Assignment and Treatment Duration 
Eligible patients will be randomized (1:1) to one of the following groups for 60 
days:   
• ACTIVE FT-CC – Text message reminders will be sent if subject does not 
use device for 2 consecutive days 
• PASSIVE FT-CC – Text message reminders will not be sent to subjects 
The FT -CC prescripti on will be a daily 60- minute U1 unilateral treatment at normal 
pressure. Settings and programs may be modified by [CONTACT_72076], if needed, and these modifications will be documented. If subjects are assigned to the ACTIVE FT-CC group and their device is not used for [ADDRESS_761331] to use their device and will be documented on the Case Report Form (CRF).  
 Study Timeline  
The ex pected study duration is approximately 10 months with 2-3 months spent on 
activation, 5 months enrolling and following subjects, and 2 months completing the data analysis.   
 Study Assessments  
In an effort to reduce potential exposure to COVID-19, all study assessments are intended to be performed in a contact[CONTACT_579580] (i.e., telephone, video conference, etc). If an assessment is done in -person, the reason will be documented, (e.g., required for adverse 
event assessment, requested by [CONTACT_1130], risk for COVID- 19 eliminated, assessment 
performed in conjunction with another clinic visit, etc.).  
CRFs and Data Clarification Forms (DCFs) will be used for data collection and query 
handling. The Investigator will ensure the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data recorded and responses to data queries according to the Clinical Trial Agreement (CTA).   
All data entry, storage, transmission, and management will be conducted using iMedNet, a 21 code of federal regulations (CFR) Part [ADDRESS_761332] of care or approved/cleared for use

Randomization will occur via entering the randomization CRF in the EDC system. The randomization assignment should not be shared with the research subject.  
The randomization assignment cannot be changed or chosen by [CONTACT_579585].  
 Quality of Life Assessments  
7.10.1 LYMQOL ARM  
The LYMQOL ARM is an assessment tool designed for measuring quality of life (QoL) in patients with upper limb lymphedema. It is a 21 -item 
questionnaire which has been designed and validated in patients with chronic edema and covers four domains: function, appearance, symptoms, and mood, and in addition, has an overall QoL s core (11). The subject will 
have a unique user account and can complete the assessment online via secure connection to the study database. If subject is not able to complete the questionnaire electronically, they can also be mailed to them for completion.  
7.10.2 SF-36 
The SF -36 is an assessment of functional status and quality of life. This 
questionnaire is a validated QoL tool that has been widely utilized and has 

  Version 4.0 
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 17 of 25  
 
been found to be appropriate for use in evaluating health related quality of 
life impacts. The SF -36 consists of 36 questions that evaluate eight health 
concepts including physical functioning, role functioning-physical, bodily 
pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role functioning – emotional, and mental health. 
 Symptom Assessment  
The LSIDS -A is a [ADDRESS_761336] cancer -related 
lymphedema (12). The subject will have a unique user account and can complete the assessment online via secure connection to the study database. If a subject cannot complete the questionnaire electronically, a paper version may be mailed to them for completion. 
 FT-CC Garment Measurements  
The subject’s chest, arm inseam, biceps, and hips will be measured to determine the appropriate size for the arm -shoulder and trunk garment. 
 FT-CC Training  
After all baseline assessments have been performed, the subject will be contact[CONTACT_426] a Tactile Medical trainer to schedule a training visit on how to use the FT- CC. 
This t raining may occur virtually, at the clinic, or in the subject’s home. Training 
may be conducted up to 21 days after the baseline visit.  
 AE & Device Observation Assessment  
AE assessment will occur after randomization and continue throughout the study. 
Repo rtable events, as defined below, will be recorded in the subject’s medical 
record and on the CRFs. All device related AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_579586].   
7.14.[ADDRESS_761337] which may or may not be related to the use of the medical device under investigation.  
Adverse events will be reported to the IRB in accordance with IRB policy. 
7.14.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) A serious adverse event is  an untoward medical occurrence where the 
outcome is:  
• Death;  
• Life-threatening event (places the subject at immediate risk of death 
from the experience as it occurred);  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (initial or prolonged) if admission to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_579571] a result of an adverse event;  
  Version 4.0 
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 18 of 25  
 
• Disability or permanent damage (substantial disruption of one’s 
ability to carry out normal life functions);  
• Congenital anomaly or birth defect; 
• Required intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage ; 
or 
• Important medical event that required medical or interventional treatment to prevent one of the previous outcomes. 
Investigators must report all Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) to Tactile 
Medical within [ADDRESS_761338] (UADE)  
A UADE is a serious adverse effect on the health or safety or any life-
threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the product labeling, published literature, or Investigational Plan, or any other unanticipated serious problem associ ated 
with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
Investigators must report all UADEs to Tactile Medical within 10 work ing 
days of becoming aware of the event. UADEs will be summarized in writing and reported to the IRB in accordance with IRB policy. 
7.14.4 Device Observations  
Device observations will be recorded and reported to Tactile Medical and assessed by [CONTACT_579587].  
7.14.5 Adverse Event Severity  
Severity will be asse ssed by [CONTACT_130691]: 
• Mild: Subject aware of sign of symptom, but easily tolerated. 
• Moderate: Interferes with normal activities.  
• Severe: Incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities.  
 Accountability   
The FT -CC and FT garments will be provided at no cost to the subject and be utilized with 
the assistance of study personnel. The FT-CC and FT garments will be shipped directly to the subject and will be returned to Tactile Medical upon study exit. The subject may ship the controller back to Tactile Medical (Tactile Medical will provide a box and label) or return the FT- CC to the site. Tactile Medical will provide all shippi[INVESTIGATOR_579572]. The record wi ll include the receipt, 
location, use, and final disposition of all controllers and garments. Subjects may keep the FT garments at the end of the study. Study devices will be stored in a secure area with 
  Version 4.0 
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 19 of 25  
 
restricted access. At the conclusion of the study al l FT-CCs will be returned to Tactile 
Medical.  
 Risk Analysis  
This study does not present risks above and beyond those normally associated with the use 
of the Flexitouch Plus.  
Theoretically, massage and mechanical compression could mobilize dormant tumor cells in 
some patients; however, this is expected to have limited impact on prognosis such that the benefits of reduction in morbid edema will likely outweigh those theoretical risks. 
Pneumatic compression is a minimal risk therapy with nominal complicatio ns or adverse 
events. Known reactions to sequential pneumatic compression therapy include: 
Likely: 
• Local skin irritation  
• Pain or discomfort 
• Increased swelling  
Less Likely:  
• Cellulitis  
• New or increased edema in the trunk and/or genital region 
Highly Unlikely: 
• Electric shock (if device is not maintained or used properly) 
Risk analysis assessments determined the probability of occurrence for these potential device risks are at the lowest level. Thus, the residual risks for these types of hazards is acceptable with the benefits to treating patients outweighing the risks.  
Use of the Flexitouch Plus may not improve lymphedema symptoms, such as: 
• Increased edema  
• Pain or discomfort 
• Redness, swelling/inflammation, and blistering  
• Skin breakdown, including pressure ulcers  
• Cellulitis infection  
• Stasis dermatitis  
The addition of cellular connectivity does not introduce any new risks to the patient regarding treatment. Risk is limited to a potential cybersecurity breach given its cellular connection; however, the device data that is being transmitted does not contain any protected health information (PHI).  
If the subject is randomized to the FT-CC arm, they must consent to receiving text 
messages from Tactile Medical. The text messages will not include any of the subject’s PHI. 
Subjects will be made aware of known complications and adverse events at the time of consent and monitored closely throughout the study. Subjects will be informed of any significant new findings that develop during the course of the study that m ay affect their 
willingness to continue participation. Should a subject choose to terminate his or her 
  Version 4.[ADDRESS_761339] the Privacy of Study Participants/Information Security Plan 
The most likely risk posed to participants would be a breach of confidentiality if someone 
other than the research team obtained access to the data.  
There are security measures in place to prevent a breach of confidentiality from happening including a password protected electronic database and the use of su bject codes to de-
identify data. 
Precautions will be taken to make sure that only authorized individuals will be accessing 
subject research records. The collection of sensitive information about subjects is limited to the amount necessary to achieve the aims of the research study, so that no unneeded 
sensitive information is being collected.   
 Deviations from Study Plan  
All deviations will be documented and reported to the IRB as required by [CONTACT_11222].    
 Regulatory Assessment  
The investigational device used in this study meets the requirements of a nonsignificant 
risk (NSR) device given the FT-CC is used for its intended purpose and: 
• Is not an implant 
• Is not used to support or sustain human lif e  
• Is not of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health 
• Does not otherwise present a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject  
Per [ADDRESS_761340] follow the abbreviated requirements at 21 CFR 812.2(b) which address labeling, IRB approval, informed consent, monitoring, records, reports, and prohibition against promotion. There is no need to make progress reports or final reports to FDA. In addition, Sponsors and IRBs do not have to report the IRB approval of an NSR device study to FDA. The IRB serves as the FDA’s surrogate for review, approval, and continuing review of the NSR device 
studies. The IRB application should state that the study is NSR and be supported with the rationale in the preceding paragraph. An NSR device study may start as soon as the IRB reviews and approves the study, without prior approval by [CONTACT_8415]. 
Importantly, the investigational software present on the FT- CC was built in accordance 
with 820.30 Design Controls, with the controller and garments being manufactured in full 
compliance with 21 CFR 820.

Report Forms (CRFs) for accuracy, completeness, and compliance with GCP.  
 Data Safety Monitoring  
The Principal Investigator (PI) will be responsible for the monitoring of study data 
and subject safety. Due to the small number of research subjects, the most 
comprehensive and effective method of monitoring will be an individual case review by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_579574]. As this has always been the policy of the PI, the researchers and study team are under specific instructions to make the PI [INVESTIGATOR_579575], expected or unexpected; therefore, the responsibility for reporting adverse events is shared with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_44200].  
Additionally, a periodic review may be completed by a designated member of the Sponsor’s Scientific Advisory Board. The frequency of the review wil l be 
determined on a number of parameters including, but not limited to: the rate of 
enrollment, number of AEs and/or SAEs, and number of significant deviations from the protocol. At the conclusion of the review, the reviewer may provide recommendations pertaining to study continuation, modification, or termination of the study or investigational site .

 Statistical Methods   
 Sample Size Determination  
  Version 4.0 
 
CONFIDENTIAL   Page 24 of 25  
 
No power calculations were used to derive a sample size for this study given this 
study seeks to identify which health outcomes should be used for a larger 
randomized controlled trial in the future. The desired target sample size for this feasibility study is 10 analyzable data sets for each group. It is estimated that up to 30 subjects will need to be enrolled to achieve 60 day follow-up data on 20 subjects.  
 Statistical Analysis  
For continuous variables, descriptive statistics will include the number of subjects (n), mean, standard deviation, median, inter-quartile range, minimum, and maximum, based upon subjects with reported data for the variable being analyzed.  Frequencies (numerator and denominator), percentages, and 95% confidence intervals will be displayed for categorical data. Percentages by [CONTACT_579593] (unreported) data for the specific variable being analyzed and the count of the patients for each individual level of the categorical variable (the level specific numerators). Percentages will add up to 100%, unless otherwise indicated. 
There are no plans to impute missing data and there are no plans to explicitly report 
missing data (counts and/or percentages) in the tables for all variables as part of the planned study report content. Variations in the reported sample sizes within and/or between relevant tables can be used to as certain insights into unreported data. In 
some cases, unreported data may be the result of it not being clinically relevant to a particular patient or may represent expected data that was not collected. Selected analyses pertaining to unreported and/or missing data may be discussed and considered as future findings warrant.  
The feasibility  nature of the study suggests that the statistical focus will be on 
estimation and hypothesis generation. Thus, formal statistical tests of hypotheses are not planned. 
All data processing, summarization, and analyses will be performed using R 
Version 3.6.[ADDRESS_761343] be obtained before disclosing any information related to this study. All publications (e.g., manuscripts, abstracts, and slide presentations) based on this study must be submitted to Tactile Medical for review and approval before submission or according to the individual site clinical trial agreement and Publication Plan.

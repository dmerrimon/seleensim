 1.0 STUDY OBJECTIVE  AND BACKGROUND  
 
Study Objective:  
The objective s of this study are to evaluate , in trigeminal nerve block procedures for painful trigeminal 
neuropathy  adult patients between 18 and 80 years of age , 
1. The efficacy of guanfacine in combination with lidocaine compared to li docaine alone  in extending the 
pain relief duration.  
2. The safety and tolerability of a single  dose of guanfacine in combination with lidocaine compared to 
lidocaine alone.  
 
Background:  
Painful trigeminal neuropathy  is a severely painful condition affecting cranial nerve  V (trigeminal nerve) that 
transmits sensation from the face. Painful trigeminal neuropathy  affects one or more branches of the trigeminal 
nerve, most  often  the second  (V2, maxillary)  or third  (V3, mandibular)  division. The latest classification  (ICHD -
3) by [CONTACT_404833] (IHS) distinguishes trigeminal nerve pain into trigeminal neuralgia and 
painful trigeminal neuropathy.[ADDRESS_510447] -radiation therapy neuritis, and 
space occupying  abnormalities. The pain associated with painful trigeminal neuropathy is highly variable in 
quality and intensity .1 Painful trigeminal neuropathy  is characterized  by [CONTACT_404834] -continuous facial pain  
often described subjectively as  burning , squeezing , electrical,  or likened to pi[INVESTIGATOR_5625] .  
 
The current treatment strategy for trigeminal neuralgia and painful trigeminal neuropathy includes  the use of 
neuropathic pain medications  (carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], oxcarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], gabapentin, lamotrigine)  and interventional 
procedures ranging from conservative local  blocks  to more invasive ablative procedures.2–[ADDRESS_510448] medical therapy fails .6,7 The decision to perform interventional or surgical pro cedu res are based on many 
factors, including the patient’s age, their overall health and ability to tolerate the procedure, the duration and 
intensity of pain and its impact on quality of life, and on patient preference.[ADDRESS_510449] -order neurons will adequately relieve the patient’s pain. Further subsequent, 
standard treatments include  repeat regional blocks  with addition of adjunctive medications (i.e. steroids, 
clonidine, or botulinum toxin ), or  progression to t rigeminal nerve ablation via radio -frequency or balloon 
compression , or radiotherapy.    
 
Trigeminal nerve block using local anesthetic with or without adjuvants have been effective in relieving pain 
temporarily in some trigeminal neuralgia patients.8–12 2% lidocaine  perineural  injection (2-4 ml) in combination 
with neuropathic pain medication s has been shown to be safe and effective in reduc ing pain, lower ing the  
frequency of pain attack s, and reported improvement in the quality of life in  classical trigeminal neuralgia  
patients.13 High concentration (10%  lidocaine ) perineural injection with no adjuvant has been shown to be safe 
Last updated: 03/07/[ADDRESS_510450] previously been shown to extend the duration of the block  in other regional anesthesia 
techniques .14,15  The proposed therapeutic approach is ultimately intended to generate durable relief of neuropathic 
pain without the potential side effects of steroids.  
 
Alpha -2-adrenergic receptor function in managing pain  
The a lpha-2 adrenoreceptor has important roles in signaling within and between both the peripheral and central 
nervous system s. Stimulation of the alpha -2 adrenoreceptor suppresses calcium entry into the nerve terminal; it 
has been  postulated  that this dynamic is responsible for its inhibitory effect on secretion of neurotransmitters, 
leading to interruption of the propagation of pain signals .[ADDRESS_510451] been  shown to be involved in  antinociceptive  activity .17 Alpha -
2 adrenergic agonists mitigate postope rative neuropathic pain in rats.18–[ADDRESS_510452] been successfully used as adjuvant s to 
local anesthetics to extend by [CONTACT_342912], regional blocks used for surgical analgesia or acute and chronic pain 
treatment .14 Clonidine (30 to 300  µg) is a well -known  adjuvant for extending  and enhancing  the effect of local 
anesthetics .15 Dexmedetomidine dose-dependently  (4.5 to 13.5µg)  enhance s the local anesthetic action of 
lidocaine  in inferior alveolar nerve block s (IANB) .22 Clonidine ( 75 µg) with (10 ml)  lidocaine , bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], and 
fentanyl  has been  used in trigeminal nerve block  to manage pain in  trigeminal neuralgia patient s without 
significant adverse events .[ADDRESS_510453] rate of sedation .25 Guanfac ine is currently approved  in tablet form f or the treatment of 
hypertension (1 to 2 mg)  and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( 1 to 4 mg ). Guanfacine is readily absorbed 
with around 80% oral bioavailability  and has an elimination  half-life of ~17 h with renal excretion accounting  for 
~50%.[ADDRESS_510454]  in comparison to clonidine (8  h vs. 5 h) due to 
slower elimination of guanfacine from spi[INVESTIGATOR_404813]. In a rat model, intrathecal guanfacine has shown  anti-
nociceptive  effect for greater than 18  h (both 25 mcg and 50 mcg) in comparison  to clonidine injection (50 mcg) 
which declined to baseline within [ADDRESS_510455] tissue compared  to clonidine. Highly concentrated g uanfacine (75 mcg in 15 µl saline ) solution 
administered through an intrathecal route has been shown to be  nontoxic in the subarachnoid space , establish ing 
the safe use  of guanfacine for perineural  block ade.30 Guanfacine as studied in animals and used in humans has a 
safe risk profile, suggesting that repurposing it for other indications. Guanfacine has the potential to be developed 
as a safe, non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] , analgesic  for acute and chronic debilitating pain. Guanfacine  in combination with  1% 
lidocaine  is expected  to be safe and to provide  an extended  duration of pain relief in painful trigeminal neuropathy 
patient s who are not able to obtain pain relief  from  standard neuropathic pain medication .

PheWAS.  PheWAS not only replicates known genetic -phenotypic associations  but also reveals new phenotypic 
associations with genetic variants, enhancing analyses of the genomic basis of human diseases and providing 
genetic support for drug discovery and drug repurposing efforts.35–[ADDRESS_510458]  an increased 
likelihood of being diagnosed with trigeminal nerve disorders .  
 
 
2.0 STUDY DESIGN

 Trigeminal nerve block will occur with the patient supi[INVESTIGATOR_404816]. Based upon  landmark and 
fluoroscopic image, the needle insertion site will be located  and infiltrated with 1ml of 1%  lidocaine . A 22 -gauge 
stimuplex  needle will be advanced  under fluoroscopic guidance to the pterygoid  fossa. Active stimulation at 0.75 
mV will be used to confirm needle tip approaching the V2 maxillary branch of the trigeminal nerve and  reduced 
to 0.3mV upon patient sensation. After confirming that the needle tip is in position with no sensation  felt by [CONTACT_404836] <0.3mV, and after negative aspi[INVESTIGATOR_404817] (CSF), 0.25ml of iodinated 
contrast (Omnipaque 300) or gadolinium -based contrast agent (Omniscan) if allergic to iodinated contrast will be 
injected under digital subtraction fluoroscopy  to ensure no vascular uptake. If vascular uptake  occurs, the needle 
tip will be adjusted, and tested again for vascular uptake. After confirmation of the needle placement, 3ml of the 
study drug or active control will  be delivered . The needle will be retracted and angled toward the V3 mandibular 
branch of the trigeminal nerve and confirmed in the same method with fluoroscopy and stimulation as above. 
After confirmation of needle placement , the remaining  3ml of  the study drug or active control will be deposited . 
The needle will then be removed . The patient will be taken to the recovery room and monitored for 60 minutes.

 Study Visit 1:  Consent and Screening  (Day -15 to Day 0)  
Patients with facial pain will be evaluated  in clinic ; those deemed to have a diagnosis of painful trigeminal 
neuropathy will be considered  for enrollment. Informed consent will be obtained prior to collecting data. Those 
patients that meet eligibility (inclusion/exclusion criteria outlined above) will be introduced to the study.  
Consented patients will become enrolled as study participants and will complete baseline measurement  prior to 
randomiz ation . Baseline data that will be collected includes demographics (name, age, sex), physical examination; 
heart rate and rhythm, blood pressure; comorbid health conditions and prior surgeries or treatments; current and 
past medications within [ADDRESS_510464] care. The targeted pain history will include pain duration, 
frequency of exacerbations, location, radiation, severity (VAS), quality, instigating event, exacerbations, 
alleviations, pain treatment frequency and duration of use (non -medical and medical treatments) and changes in 
pain over time. The targeted pain physical exam will include assessment of light touch test for allodynia and 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_404819] V1 -[ADDRESS_510465] care prior to nerve block. Participants 
will be asked if there is a  possibility they are pregnant. Women of childbearing potential will be educated on birth 
control methods and will agree to 2 methods of birth control that they will plan to use during the study period 
(abstinence is an appropriate method). A  urine drug screen for illicit use of controlled substances will be obtained. 
Patient -reported outcome forms to be completed in clude the PROMIS Global -10 SF and Pain Interference forms . 
Current and average 24 -hour pain (VAS) before procedure will also be recorded . Assessments will be recorded 
according to the patient’s preference, either on paper or via electronic forms using REDCap. All data will be 
entered  into REDCap.  
 
Study Visit 2: Procedure 1 (Day 1)  
Participants  will be asked to record their pain intensity, 24 - hour VAS and current VAS, before the procedure to 
establish a baseline pain score . Other data will be collected  for secondary measures: frequency of pain attacks, 
basal and breakthrough opi[INVESTIGATOR_9787] -opi[INVESTIGATOR_404820] .  Overall quality of life (PROMIS 
Global -10 short form ) will be assessed .[ADDRESS_510466] trigeminal nerve block procedure:  Participant will receive either  study drug (guanfacine and lidocaine 
combination) or active control (lidocaine alone) for the trigeminal nerve block based on randomization. 
Participants will be monitored for pain intensity at [ADDRESS_510467] 8 hours while in the recovery (first 60 minutes) and after discharge home , with responses allowed all the way 
until the next time point  and actual time of the response being used in analysis . Assessments will be recorded 
according to the patient’s preference, either on paper  or via text message ) using  the Twilio application linked to  
REDCap.  Patients will also receive a sheet with contact [CONTACT_404843] . 
 
First follow -up period (Day 2 to Day 14)  
Participants will be monitored once daily at approximately the same timepoint for 14 days using text message 
generated using the Twilio app lication  or recorded on a paper diary . Participant s will also be monitored  for any 
use of rescue medication (analgesics) once daily. The study nurse will monitor  participant s once weekly for 
overall  quality of life via phone call using the PROMIS global [ADDRESS_510468]

the first nerve block. At the second study visit, participants  will record [ADDRESS_510470] prior to receiving the nerve block.   
 
 If VAS < 5 on the pain scale, participants will not be eligible for second trigeminal nerve block during the visit. 
Study  nurse will continue monitoring the participant’s pain intensity (daily through day  15, and weekly thereafter ) 
to see if the participant pain is above 5 on the pain scale and eligible for the second block. In general, the study 
intends that participants would receive both treatments unless they experience intolerable toxicity. If a participant 
is unable or ineligible to receive second tr igeminal nerve block, then the participant’s data collected during the 
first nerve block will be included in the analysis. In addition, a replacement participant will be enrolled so that

6.0  RISKS  
 
During  the consent process, study personnel will address potential discomfort and risks associated with the 
protocol. These will be included in  the consent form.  
 
Based on the known common side effects of the study drugs and the trigeminal block procedure, the following 
risk associated with participation in the study are perceived  as low:  
- Bradycardia  
- Hypotension  
- Dry Mouth  
- Sedation  
- Dizziness  
- Headache  
- Bruising, redness, itching, or swelling at the site of injection  
- Intravascular injection resulting in seizure or stroke  
- Bleeding  
- Increased pain  
 
In the event sedation or dizziness is observed after the procedure, standard  of care practices for managing side 
effects will be performed , and the event will be documented and recorded according to the regulation .  
 
It is understood  that there may be as -yet unknown  or unanticipated adverse effects of this study treatment.  The 
study team will continually monitor for these effects  and consider altering the protocol  if needed  to ensure patient 
safety . Changes  in the procedures of the study, as well as any change(s) in the risks and/or  benefits  will be 
presented to and discussed with the subjects upon approval from the appropriate regulatory bodies for 
implementation of such revision(s).  
 
Safety Monitoring:  
Patients are examined on the day of the procedure to confirm the source of pain, vital signs are stable and in 
normal range, and female patients are confirmed not -pregnant through point of care pregnancy test s. During the 
procedure continuous pulse oximetry is used to monitor oxygenation, blood pressure is obtained every 2 minutes, 
and 3 -lead electrocardiogram is monitored for heart rate and rhythm. Following the procedure, patients are taken 
to the recovery room adjacent to the procedure room to be monitor ed for 1 hour with continuous pulse oximetry, 
blood pressure (measured every 5 minutes), and continuous ECG to ensure stable vital signs.   The patients are 
discharged home with a responsible adult after recovery.   Before, during, and after the procedure patients are 
monitored by a registered nurse skilled in the evaluation of vital signs and familiar with the procedure. [CONTACT_404867] is an An esthesiologist and will be present for the duration of patient care.   
 
Data Monitoring:  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_404821] -time monitoring of all trial -related activities. [CONTACT_404867]  will assure that the study is conducted according to Good Clinical Practice Guidelines and according to 
FDA requirements.  The study team will meet bi -weekly to review recruitment, enrollment, retention, status of 
each participant currently enrolled, adve rse events.  Targets will be established for enrollment and completion 
and reviewed at each meeting where strategies will be discussed to assure  that the study is on track.  Enrollment 
tables will be developed by [CONTACT_404847] .  Adverse and serious 
adverse events reports will be monitored in real -time by [CONTACT_978], project manager, and study coordinator.  All final

and manages a software toolset and workflow methodology for electronic collection and management of research 
and clinical trial data. All study data will be entered via a password protected, study unique REDCap da tabase 
website. REDCap servers are housed in a local data center at Vanderbilt and all web -based information 
transmission is encrypted. REDCap was developed specifically around HIPAA Security guidelines and is 
recommended by [CONTACT_404848]. REDCap has 
been disseminated for use locally at other institutions and currently supports more than 2,700 academic/non -profit 
consortium partners and over 657,000 research end -users (www.project -redcap.org).  Data will be accessed via  
password protected and secured Web -based interface for data entry and data cleaning. REDCap contains an audit 
trail for tracking all activities within the system.  
 
To ensure data is accurately and completely collected during the study, periodic monitoring will occur by [CONTACT_404849], protocol changes have been implemented 
appropriately, data are being captured per protocol, and are accurate, complete, and current for study subjects. 
Per best practice guidelines, the monitor will compare a representative number of subject records and other 
supporting documents with the investigator’s reports. Specifically, monitoring  activities will include:  
  
[1] A Technical Review  annually which will consist of the Project Manager examining the quality and accuracy 
of data, regulatory documents, and other essential documents. Data quality and accuracy will be reviewed through 
a CRF data and source document review. The Project Manag er will randomly select a pre -determined number of 
study participants to serve as a representative sample. Regulatory Document Review will consist of a review of 
IRB approvals, informed consents, critical documents, and protocols/amen dments.  
 
[2] The Scientific Review  will occur biennially and will consist of a review of the study’s organizational structure, 
patient recruitment, staff training, and quality control procedures by [CONTACT_21124]. Site monitoring 
progress reports will be submitted to the DSMB and othe r regulatory bodies (IRB, FDA and NIH) as requested 
and/or required. This Monitoring Plan will serve as a method for identifying systematic problems and provide a 
means in which to institute resolution and follow -up and therefore i ncrease data quality.  
 
Any omissions and corrections to data submitted to REDCap are noted and queries are generated by [CONTACT_404850]’s automated system. Data are checked and verified by [CONTACT_21124].  A green 
check is placed beside items that have been  verified as accurate when compared to source documentation. For 
those items that are not initially verified, a query will be issued using the Data Quality Tool in REDCap. Users 
will then be able to pull up a list of queries using the Resolve Issues Applic ation. Queries will be responded to 
directly on each respected eCRF page.  Furthermore, there is an option to upload additional documentation if 
requested by [CONTACT_21124]. Once a query has been answered, the Project Manager will review the new 
infor mation and choose to either re -query the data point or close the query by [CONTACT_404851]. Once all data points on the eCRF page have been reviewed and verified as accurate, a 
green verification check will be placed a t the bottom of the page and the page will be locked, to show that the 
data on the page is acceptable and ready to be signed off on by [CONTACT_079].  If a data point is revised 
after it was verified and accepted as accurate by [CONTACT_404852] a red exclamation mark will appear 
Last updated: 03/07/[ADDRESS_510473] the 
option to issue a new query regarding the change or to verify the new data as accurate and complete. All queries 
will be stored in REDCap’s logg ing and audit trail so that all data revisions are tracked and permanently recorded 
in order to verify data accuracy.  The audit trail will contain a time stamped record of revisions and data entry 
within the database.  All data points entered for the firs t two patients enrolled at each site will be thoroughly 
monitored. Thereafter, specific data points that support the primary and secondary endpoints (ex. 
Inclusion/Exclusion criteria, informed consent, and randomization strata) will be thoroughly reviewed by a 
Project Manager.  20% to 100% of all additional data points will then be randomly monitored for accuracy.  
Queries will be issued no later than one month after completed eCRF pages are reviewed.  Review will be 
expedited in cases of urgent concern.  O pen queries must be answered within [ADDRESS_510474] come from an original source. Study coordinators will upload all 
related source documents and medical records that contain information (including Protected Health Information 
for verification purposes) used in c ompleting the eCRFs into the secure REDCap system. If original source is 
given verbally and/or if study procedures were documented outside of the medical record, an original source 
document must be created (which includes applicable signatures and dates) t hat provides an accurate account of 
the information that was exchanged.  All applicable study source documentation will be uploaded into REDCap 
for monitoring purposes then shredded.  
 
7.0 REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS OR UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS INVOLVING RISK 
TO PARTICIPANTS OR OTHERS  
 
Adverse Event  
An AE is “ any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment .” An adverse 
event can, therefore,  be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) 
product.  
AEs include any of the following:  
• Worsening (change in nature, severity or frequency) of conditions present at the onset of the trial  
• Subject deterioration due to the primary illness  
• Intercurrent illnesses  
• Drug interactions  
• Events related or possibly related to concomitant medications  
• Changes of vital signs, as well as significant shifts from baseline within the range of normal, which the 
Investigator considers to be clinically significant  
 
Adverse Drug Reaction  
In the pre -approval clinical experience with a new medicinal product or its new usage, particularly  as the 
therapeutic dose(s) may not be established, an adverse drug reaction is defined  as: 
All noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should be considered adverse 
drug reactions (ADR) . 
 
Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction  
An unexpected ADR is:  
An adverse drug reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable product 
information, also known as reference safety information.  The reference safety information is the package insert 
of the individual drug.  
Last updated: 03/07/2022

Serious Adverse Event/Serious Adverse Drug Experience  
During clinical investigations, serious  AEs may occur,  if the event is suspected to be drug -related, the event  may 
be significant enough to lead to important  changes in the way the medicinal product is developed  (e.g., change in 
dose, population, needed monitoring, consent forms). This is particularly true for reactions, which, in their most 
severe forms, threaten life or function.   
 
A serious AE (SAE) or serious adverse drug experience (SADE) is any untoward medical occurrence that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening.  ‘Life -threatening” refers to an event in which the subject is at risk of death at the time 
of the event ; it does not refer  to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe (ICH E6).  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/ incapacity (as per reporter’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649])  
• Is a congenital anomaly/ birth defect  
• Is another medically important condition.   Important  medical conditions that may not result in death,  be 
life-threatening or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_404822], based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one 
of the outcomes listed in the definition above. Exa mples of such events are intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result 
in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse [Code of Federal Regulations Title 
21, Volume 5, 21CFR312.32, revised April 1, 2006].  
 
Please note:  Serious is not synonymous with severe. An event may be severe  (e.g., severe  headache) but still be 
of minor medical significance. Serious  refers to an event  that poses a threat to the subject’s life or functioning.  
 
Assigning Severity to an Adverse Event  
Mild:         Causing no limitation of usual activities ,             
      the subject may experience slight discomfort.  
Moderate:  Causing some limitation of usual activities ,         
      the subject may experience annoying discomfort.  
Severe:      Causing inability to carry out usual activities;      
      the subject may experience intolerable  discomfort or pain.  
 
Assigning Relationship of Adverse Event to Study Drug (Causality)  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_404823] (i.e., causality) by [CONTACT_404853] ‘not related,'  ‘possibly related’,  or ‘probably related’.  Descriptions of the three classification 
categories are as follows:  
 
Not Related  
Exposure to study drug has not occurred; administration of study drug and the adverse event are not reasonably 
related in time; or the SAE is considered by [CONTACT_404854] a pre -existing condition, a known 
manifestation of the target disease,  a recurrent condition, or is likely explained by [CONTACT_404855] -existing and did not deteriorate.  
Possibly Related  
The SAE occurred during or within a reasonable period of time  after administration of the study drug, or a pre -
existing event worsened within an appropriate period of time  after administration of study drug, but the SAE 
Last updated: 03/07/[ADDRESS_510475] one 
of the following criteria is applicable:  
• the event  could not be explained  by [CONTACT_404856], environmental or toxic 
factors, or other diagnostic or therapeutic measures;  
• the event  was an expected ADR associated with study treatment or a class -labeled drug effect;  
• the SAE subsided or disappeared after withdrawal or dose reduction of study treatment; or  
• the SAE recurred after re -exposure to study treatment . 
 
Adverse Event Recording  
Each adverse event occurring to a subject, either spontaneously revealed by [CONTACT_404857], whether believed to be related or unrelated to the study drug, must be recorded on the AE Case 
Report Form and the subject’s file.  
 
Adverse Event Reporting  
All adverse events (AEs) recorded on the adverse  event form and will be sent  to the Principal Investigator (PI) 
within 72 hours of the event . AEs will be reported  to the IRB according to the IRB policies and procedures. Any 
unanticipated problems involving risk to the participants or others will be discussed  with the Principal Investigator 
(PI). 
 
Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
All SAEs will be recorded on the adverse event case report form and will be reported to the Principal Investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_874] 24 hours after becoming aware of their occurrence. All SAEs will be reported  to the IRB and FDA in 
accordance with  applicable regulations and policies. Our procedures for reporting the serious adverse events will 
be as follows: 1. SAEs will be recorded in the patient’s study chart and reported to the Principal Investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_874] 24 hours of the study team’s awareness of the occurrence b y email or text message and will be reported to 
Vanderbilt’s IRB according to IRB policies (5 working days). The Study Coordinator  will report the event within 
[ADDRESS_510476] the opportunity to review 
and agree (or not) with the Safety Monitor’s determination on each event.  When the Safety Monitor  suspects an 
event is study -related, he/she will have the opportunity (if he/she chooses) to access additional data in order to 
conduct appropriate safety monitoring. The Safety Monitor  will determine if any necessary actions need to occur 
as result of the event in order to increase the safety of the protocol.  
 
Safety Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_2121]:  
The trigeminal block procedure is standard of care in the pain clinic. Expected effects of successful block include 
transient numbness, transient facial weakness including ipsilateral eyelid lag, and rare visual changes all of which 
resolve with the resolu tion of the effects of lidocaine over the typi[INVESTIGATOR_404824] 2 hours. Rare risks of the block 
procedure include infection, bleeding, nerve injury from the mechanical placement of the block needle. Rare risks 
of using lidocaine during the block procedure inc lude intravascular or subdural injection resulting in transient 
unresponsiveness and/or seizure, mild sedation, bradycardia, and arrhythmias. These rare risks and side -effects 
must be differentiated from potential side -effects due to the addition of guanfa cine. As all eligible patients are in 
Last updated: 03/07/[ADDRESS_510477] 20% of patients in either group is greater than anticipated either by 
[CONTACT_404858], study enrollment will be stopped and the safety monitor en gaged for an interim review of 
data comparing the study groups. If oversedation is occurring in only one group, an adjustment will be made to 
maintain monitoring for more than an hour (as is standard) until complete recovery.  
 
Potential adverse events (AE) including any occurrence of the above listed procedural or medicine -related side -
effects and risks will be documented as AE’s, described and categorized as mild -, moderate -, severe - AE and 
submitted for review by [CONTACT_404859]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_404825]. Severe AEs would include the occurrence of a seizure, severe sedation 
requiring ventilation support; bradycardia, unstable arrhythmias, or h ypotension requiring resuscitation (medical 
or mechanical).  The occurrence of a severe AE that is deemed study related would result in a stop of enrollment 
to report the data to the IRB, and FDA guidance would be obtained prior to study restart.  
 
 
8.0 STUDY WITHDRAWAL/DISCONTINUATION  
 
Participants will be advised  that they have the right to withdraw from the study at any point in time for any reason.  
During the study,  if the participants no longer wants to participate, they will be withdrawn  from the study. Contact 
[CONTACT_71722] [INVESTIGATOR_404826].  
 
Subjects will be withdrawn from the study if the PI’s medical judgment  is that participation places  the subject  at 
risk for harm.  
 
 
9.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
The effects of guanfacine adjuvant (intervention) versus active control on the time to return to baseline pain 
(primary) will be assessed using linear mixed -effects regression, adjusting for randomization order group and its 
interaction with the intervention/control indi cator. A random intercept indexed by [CONTACT_404860] -participant correlation of the pre - and post -crossover measurements. The linear model 
assumptions will be assessed by [CONTACT_404861], conditional on the empi[INVESTIGATOR_98599] l Bayes estimates of random 
effects. If there is evidence that the linear model assumptions are violated (e.g., non -normal residuals or the very 
unlikely possibility of right censoring), alternative model formulations will be considered as necessary. The 
overall effect of intervention on the primary outcome will be tested using a two degree -of-freedom chunk test 
against the null hypothesis of no intervention main effect and no order -by-intervention interaction. The effects of 
intervention on the mean time t o return to baseline will be summarized using estimates and 95% confidence 
intervals, stratified by [CONTACT_404862]. The effects of guanfacine adjuvant versus active control on secondary 
outcomes will be assessed using similar mixed -effects regression techniqu es as appropriate for the type of 
outcome (including proportional hazards, cumulative logit, logistic, and linear regression methods), adjusting for 
Last updated: 03/07/2022 
 
18 
 randomization order group and its interaction with the intervention/control indicator. A random intercept indexed 
by [CONTACT_404863] -participant correlation. Quantitative and/or graphical 
regression diagnostics will be examined, and alternative model formulations will be considered as appropriate. 
Intervention effects will be tested and summarized as described above. No familywise hypotheses will be tested; 
no adjustments will be made to control any familywise type -I error probability. The type -I error rate will be fixed 
at 5%. All statistical analyses will be implemented in R ( www.r -project.org ; latest version) and the add -on 
package “lme4” and other packages as necessary.  
 
9.1 Statistical power and sample size . Evidence from the medical literature and expert opi[INVESTIGATOR_404827] (active control group) is approximately [ADDRESS_510478] 80% power to detect a 20% or 
greater  increase in the duration of pain relief after 
treatment with lidocaine plus guanfacine as an adjuvant 
(treatment group). This corresponds to a mean difference 
of [ADDRESS_510479] deviation 30 
minutes. Under these conditions, 30 participants will ensure approximately 90% power to detect a significant 
mean difference (28 minutes or greater  in pain relief duration). Figure [ADDRESS_510480] sizes (i.e., 15%, 20%, and 25% increase in pain relief duration), for a 
variety of sample sizes.   
Dropout and intent -to-treat: If VAS < 5 on the pain scale, participants will not be eligible for second trigeminal 
nerve block during the visit. Study  nurse will continue monitoring the participant’s pain intensity daily (days 15 -
28) to monitor when the participant pain is above 5 on the pain scale and eligible for the second block. In general, 
the study intends that participants would receive both treatments unless they experience intolerable toxicity. If a 
participant is unable or ineligible to receive se cond trigeminal nerve block, then the participant’s data collected 
during the first nerve block will be included in the final analysis. In addition , a replacement participant will be 
enrolled  so that the minimum number of [ADDRESS_510481] to consent  70 subjects with 30 completing the 
full study.  
Although 28 -70 incremental/additional minutes of pain relief would be clinically significant by [CONTACT_5071], the study 
finding would validate the pain relief mechanism of guanfacine in the trigeminal nerve and show that enhanced 
pain relief can be achieved by t he combination of drugs, and therefore extends the utility of the mechanism into 
further clinical development.

 10.0 PRIVACY/CONFIDENTIALITY ISSUES  
 
A database will be designed  for this study using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) tools. REDCap is 
a secure, web-based  application designed to support data capture for research studies and was developed 
specifically around HIPAA -Security guidelines.  PI [INVESTIGATOR_404828]. All reasonable efforts will be made to keep a patient’s protected health information (PHI) private and 
confidential.  Participants  will be identified  with a study identification number.  There will be limited access to 
medical records and de -identification of all records .  Federal privacy guidelines will be follo wed when using or 
sharing any protected health information.  
 
Much like email, text messaging is not considered a secure form of communication.   These surveys use a third -
party service called Twilio to deliver the text messages and collect your answers.  REDCap goes to great lengths 
to ensure that text transcripts d o not stay in Twilio’s records but are removed shortly after being completed and 
transferred to REDCap. This is done for privacy and security concerns –answers and phone number do not get 
permanently logged in Twilio’s computers but instead remain securely  in REDCap.

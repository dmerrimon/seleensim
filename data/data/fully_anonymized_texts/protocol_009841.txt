I. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY AND BACKGROUND  
 
Purpose  
The purpose of the proposed study is to evaluate the effects of administering intravenous 
tranexamic acid (TXA) to  patients undergoing high tibial osteotomy (HTO) and tibial tubercle 
osteotomy (TTO) to minimize hemarthrosis within the knee joint and post operative pain  and 
swelling . 
 
Rationale  
High tibial osteotomy is a procedure performed to correct varus malalignment and slow  the 
progression of medial osteoarthritis  or correct knee instability caused by [CONTACT_256589]1. 
Tibial tubercle osteotomy is a procedure performed to treat patellar instability or overload of the 
patella2. The tibial tubercle is a bony prominence where the patella attaches found on the anterior 
tibia, inferior to the knee joint.  Both patients requiring HTO and TTOs suffer from chronic knee 
pain.  During the process of an osteotomy, extensive bone bleeding can occur due to the opening 
gap3. As a result,  complications of both procedures in clude p ostoperative bleeding and swelling  
of the knee joint , which prolong s healing and the rehabilitation process . 
 
Tranexamic acid (TXA) has been proposed as a solution to decrease these postoperative 
complications . TXA is a synthetic anti -fibrinolytic a gent that competitively inhibits the 
activation of plasminogen to plasmin  by [CONTACT_256590]4,5. Plasmin, an enzyme that degrades fibrin clots, 
fibrinogen, procoagulant factors V and VIII4. Inhibition of plasmin decreases proteolytic action 
thus leading to clot formation and stabilization4. TXA is indicated in patients with hemophilia for 
short -term use (two to eight days) to reduce or prevent hemorrhage and reduce the n eed for 
replacement therapy during and following tooth extraction6. Administering TXA during the 
surgery will reduce the amoun t of plasmin in the system decreasing blood loss during  and after 
the surgery . One gram of intravenous tranexamic acid (TXA) will be administrated before 
tourniquet inflation and before closure of the incision, as 1 g has been shown to be a safe amount 
with minimal side effects7.TXA has already been s hown to decrease perioperative bleeding in 
total knee arthroplasty  and total hip arthroplasty , without increasing the risk of deep vein 
thrombosis8-14. 
 
This study is not being conducted under an IND number and will be conducted under IND 
exemption. This investigation is not intended to be reported to th e FDA in support of a new 
indication for use nor support any other significant change in the labeling or advertising for the 
drug. The investigation does not involve a route of administration or dosage level or use in a 
patient population or other factor t hat significantly increases the risks (or decreases the 
acceptability of the risks) associated with the use of the drug product. The route of administration 
(IV) and dosage of 1 g has been shown to be safe and effective6,7. The investigation is conducted 
in compliance with the requirements for institutional  review set forth in part 56 and with the 
requirements for informed consent set forth in part 50; and The investigation is conducted in 
compliance with the requirements of 312.7.  
 
Reducing Hemarthrosis  After High Tibial Osteotomy and Tibial Tubercle Osteotomy by [CONTACT_256587][INVESTIGATOR_256584]-articular  Tranexamic Acid  (6/4/18) 
 
[ADDRESS_311958] eotomy patients to tibial tubercle osteotomy  patients, we will determine 
if there is a difference in efficacy o r if both cohorts will be similarly affected.  
 
Study Design  
This is a single -center, prospective cohort study . Patients will be assigned to their cohorts based 
on diagnosis and appropriate treatment as determined by [CONTACT_11065]. Patients will be consented 
in the study once they are scheduled for either a HTO or TTO, therefore this will not be a 
randomized study. The study  is comparing blood loss and postoperative pain after TXA 
administration in patients receiving a  high tibial osteotomy  (HTO)  to patients receiving  a tibial 
tubercle osteotomy (TTO) with or without medial patello -femoral ligament (MPFL) 
reconstructio n. One gram of  intravenous tranexamic acid will be administered  before tourniquet  
inflation  and [ADDRESS_311959] their 
knee swelling measured immediately postoperatively and at their one -week follow up visit.  The 
swelling ratio is defined as the postoperative mean circumference of upper pole of patella and 
lower pole of patella divided by [CONTACT_246859].  
 
Primary Objective  
The primary objective of the study is to determine if there are any differences in blood loss  
between patients undergoing high tibial osteotomy (HTO) and tibial tubercle osteotomy (TTO) 
with or without medial patello -femoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction . 
 
Secondary Objective  
Secondary objective of the study is to determine if there is a differen ce in post operative pain and 
swelling between patients undergoing HTO compared to patients undergoing TTO . 
 
II. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RESEARCH POPULATION

III. METHODS AND PROCEDURES  
 
Methods and Procedures   
Patients indicated and scheduled for a high tibial osteotomy or tibial tubercle osteotomy with or 
without medial patello -femoral ligament reconstruction will be identified from faculty surgeon 
case logs at the NYU Langone Health, Langone Orthopedic Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l Sports Medicine Division.   
After informed consent is obtained, a chart review of patients’ medications and past medical 
histories will be reviewed  based on their electronic medical records to identify any current pain 
medications or exclusion criteria. Patients will be in the study for [ADDRESS_311962] follow 
up visit.

5 
 Patients will be given 1 gram of intravenous tranexamic aci d (TXA) before tourniquet  inflation  
and [ADDRESS_311963] -operative 
treatment.  
 
Information to be recorded pre -operatively includes age, sex, height, weight, BMI, and American 
Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) classification. Intra -operative information will also be 
recorded, including ope rative time, and estimated blood loss . During the surgery, a suction 
device is utilized to remove excess blood from the surgical site and sucked into the suction drain 
and placed into a measuring cup. We will measure the perioperative blood loss by [CONTACT_256591].   Knee swelling postoperatively will  be 
measured using the swelling ratio . The swelling ratio was defined as the circumference of the 
operative limb divided by [CONTACT_246862]. Pain severity scores at rest 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_2363] a visual analog scale (VAS; 0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain imaginable) 
at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 24, and 48 hours as well as 7 days after surgery. Percocet  consumption will 
be recorded at 24 hours, 1 day, 2 days and 7 days after surgery. Incidence of TXA -related side 
effects (nausea/vomiting, itching, anxiety, increased thirst, rap id heartbeat ) in the first [ADDRESS_311964] -anesthesia care unit (PACU) and time to 
discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15349].  
 
 
 Analysis and Data Monitoring  
Data monitoring will be done by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Michael Alaia, the  principal investigator . He will review the 
following accumulated data quarterly.   
He will monitor whether or not:  
1. Collection and storage of patient data was performed in a sensitive and secure 
manner, as defined in the informed consent form and protocol , ensuring information 
is stored on REDCap.  
2. All study activities were conducted with primary emphasis on patient care and 
wellbeing, ensuring the patients are not in discomfort and have an abnormally high 
VAS following the surgery.  
3. If there were an y adverse events, and if so were addressed appropriately and per 
protocol  
4. The risk/benefit to patients has remained the same throughout the course of the study.  
 
The study will be stopped if there are unexpected severe AE’s in more than one patient. Adver se 
events will be defined as negative reactions to the intravenous TXA during or after surgery, 
including seizures , vision problems. We will submit summaries of data and safety monitoring 
annually.   
 
Data Analysis   
According to a post hoc power analysis calculating the effect size using our preliminary data, 
>15 patients are required with d=0.6 to obtain a power of 0.80 and an alpha value of 0.05. 
Therefore we are including an additional 5 patients per group to accou nt for patients that may be 
Reducing Hemarthrosis  After High Tibial Osteotomy and Tibial Tubercle Osteotomy by [CONTACT_256587][INVESTIGATOR_256584]-articular  Tranexamic Acid  (6/4/18) 
 
[ADDRESS_311965] to follow up. Statistical analysis will be performed using chi -squared and/or fisher’s exact 
testing depending on size for binary variables.  Continuous variables will be compared with 
paired t -tests if the data is approxim ately normally distributed.  If the data is not normally 
distributed, Mann -Whitney tests will be used.  All protected health information will be removed 
prior to statistical analysis. We will use patient subjective pain, perioperative blood loss and knee 
swelling data as statistical endpoints.  Subjective pain will be measured with the VAS (visual 
analogue scale), perioperative blood loss will be measured looking at blood loss from the suction 
drain after surgery. The swelling ratio is defined as the postoperative mean circumference of 
upper pole of patella and lower pole of patella divided by [CONTACT_256592]. The endpoints must be statistically significant between the two cohorts to 
show TXA is effective.  
 
 
Data  Storage and Confidentiality  
Data recorded from th is study will be organized in  RedCap  and maintained on the department’s 
secure password -protected research drive until the data are de -identified. Participant medical 
information will only be available to t he principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_256585]. All patient health information will be de -identified and assigned a code. 
Information linking participants’ names, social security numbers and medical record numbers 
will be store d in a secure location separate from the medical information. This information wil l 
be destroyed at study closure.  
 
Adverse Event Reporting  
Information about any breach of confidentiality  will be documented in the electronic data 
collection system and/or on the paper CRFs, as appropriate. It will be the responsibility of the 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_15359] (SAE) that occurs during the  data 
collection  to the Insti tutional Review Board (IRB) within the timeframe specified by [CONTACT_15371].  
 
IV. RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT  
 
Risk

• blurred vision  
• changes in vision  
• chest pain  
• confusion  
• cough  
• dizziness or lightheadedness  
• fainting

 • numbness of the hands  
• pain, redness, or swelling in the arm or leg  
• sudden shortness of breath or troubled breathing  
 
Rare side effects include:  
• Convulsions or seizures  
• Orthostatic hypotension  
• sweating  
• trouble seeing  
• unusual tiredness or weakness .  
 
Protection against Risks   
The patients will stay in the recovery unit a minimum of [ADDRESS_311966] seven days following 
surgery.  
 
All patients will be de -identified and given a code. Information linking the patient codes to the 
participants’ nam es and medical record numbers will be stored in a secure location separate from 
the medical information.  Access to the information linking the linkage codes with participant 
identifiers shall be restricted.    
 
Potential Benefits to the Subject s  
Patients may experience less pain post -operatively, and may require less narcotics use, which has 
a steeper side -effect profile. However, these benefits cannot be guaranteed.  
 
Additionally, it is the hope of the research team that results of this study wil l benefit future 
patients and their physicians by [CONTACT_256593].  This will allow for a more open and informed dialogue, and possibly a change in 
standard of care .

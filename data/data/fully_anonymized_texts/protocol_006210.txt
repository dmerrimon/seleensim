1.0 Objectives  
 
1.1 Primary Objective:  
 
1.1.1  - To compare postoperative pain control and quality of life in 
patients undergoing liver and/or pancreatic resection between those 
receiving thoracic epi[INVESTIGATOR_232922] (TEA) versus intravenous patient -
controlled analgesia (IVPCA).  
 
1.2 Secondary Objectives : 
 
1.2.1 - To compare postoperative/surgical outcomes between TEA and 
IVPCA groups.  
 
1.2.2  - To validate survey  instruments in the assessment of 
postoperativ e quality of recovery /satisfaction .  
 
1.2.[ADDRESS_1141720] few decades due to 
improvements in surgical techniques and perioperative care. [1-4] The advent of 
minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery has led to decreased postoperative pain 
compared to traditional open surgical procedures. [5, 6]  However laparoscopy is 
not technically feasible and is oncologically inappropriate in the vast majority of 
these patients. Th us improved methods to limit the morbidity of postoperative 
pain and its sequelae are in critical need. Inadequate pain control after open 
abdominal procedures can result in increased complications, length of stay, and 
delay in overall recovery. This is of  particular importance in cancer patients, 
many of whom require further intensive oncologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_823346]. It has been found that a significant proportion of patients who may 
benefit from adjuvant therapy are unable to proceed due to prolongation of care 
secondary to surgical complications. [7, 8]  An effective regimen of postoperative 
analgesia based on current evidence -based protocols, may attenuate the 
detrimental physiologic responses to resection, and contribute to improvement in 
patient outcomes and lower complications. As an example, uncontro lled 
postoperative pain may contribute to cardiac morbidity through activation of the 
sympathetic nervous system, surgical stress response, and coagulation cascade 
which can increase myocardial oxygen demand by [CONTACT_823428], 
contractility, arteria l blood pressure, and enhance perioperative 
hypercoagulability. [9] Despi[INVESTIGATOR_823347], postoperative 
pain c ontinues to be undertreated. [10] Currently the two major analgesic options 
after inpatient abdominal surgery in the [LOCATION_002]  are intravenous patient -
controlled analgesia (IVPCA) using narcotics and thoracic epi[INVESTIGATOR_44187] 
(TEA) using local anesthetics and/or narcotics. There has been considerable 
debate regarding the advantages and disadvantages between these two 
Protocol [ADDRESS_1141721]. [11] The 
analgesic effects of narcotics are due to decreased perception and reaction to 
pain.[12] By [CONTACT_823429], 
IVPCA is considered to be the accepted standard by [CONTACT_285799][INVESTIGATOR_823348]. IVPCA provides significantly superior 
analgesia compa red with conventional “as needed” (intravenous, intramuscular, 
or subcutaneous) opi[INVESTIGATOR_40499]. [13]  
 
- However, all systemic narcotic -based methods have certain drawbacks. The 
side effects in postoperative patients include significant nausea, sedation, cough 
suppression, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], constipation, and delayed recovery of bowel 
function. [14] These effects  may lead to increased postoperative complications 
and delayed recovery, particularly in older, higher -risk patients. Furthermore 
IVPCA has been found to have a higher incidence of interruptions in an algesic 
delivery due to system -related events compared to other forms of continuous 
analgesic delivery. [15] 
 
2.3 Epi[INVESTIGATOR_13904]  
 
- Unlike that seen with systemic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], epi[INVESTIGATOR_823349]  (pain) input into the central nervous system and with the addition of a 
low-dose epi[INVESTIGATOR_823350], may provide an even greater analgesic effect. [16] Due 
to the potential reduced need for narcotics, post -operative epi[INVESTIGATOR_823351].  A 
recent systematic review found consistent evidence that TEA reduces risk of 
cardiovascular and pulmonary complications and hastens return of postoperative 
gastrointestinal function compared to other forms of intravenous narcotic 
regimens after abdominal surgery in subsets of high -risk patients. [9] As most 
adult solid c ancer s are diagnosed in the elderly , these  can be at higher risk of 
operative complications. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_823352] , particularly for dynamic pain, and improves 
postoperative recovery with a lower incidence of adverse effects compared with 
IVPCA. [17] Epi[INVESTIGATOR_823353].  In patients receiving regional epi[INVESTIGATOR_44187], the 
neuroendocrine response has been found to be  attenuated while  NK-cell a ctivity 
is preserved  compared to those patients receiving IVPCA .[18, 19]  Regional 
analgesia has been shown to markedly attenuate the neuroendocrine response 
to surgery, as eviden ced by [CONTACT_823430] -
induced plasma catecholamines and cortisol. [20, 21]  Similarly. NK and Th1 -cell 
activity is better preserved with epi[INVESTIGATOR_823354]. [22, 23]  
 
- Epi[INVESTIGATOR_823355], motor block, hypotension, catheter malfunction, and 
local infection. [24] Epi[INVESTIGATOR_823356], although very rare, can be a 
catastr ophic complication of epi[INVESTIGATOR_823357]. The risk is theoretically

increased in patients with impaired hemostasis because of coagulopathy or 
therapeutic anticoagulation. However, the results of several studies looking at 
over 3000 patients undergoin g TEA found the incidence of epi[INVESTIGATOR_823358] 0.001%. [25-27] Early recognition of these problems can improve 
outcome and these low -frequency complications need to be balanced against the 
potentially serious hypoxemia and other postoperative complications associated 
with intravenous  opi[INVESTIGATOR_823359]. [28] Epi[INVESTIGATOR_823360]. Overall, thoracic epi[INVESTIGATOR_823361]. [29]  
 
2.[ADDRESS_1141722] shown that TEA results in improved pain scores  compared to 
IVPCA. These studies evaluated analgesic outcomes in a variety of operative 
procedures: thoracic, spi[INVESTIGATOR_1304], orthopedic, gynecologic, and abdominal 
surgery. [30-36] A recent meta -analysis found that f or all types of surgery and 
pain assessments, all forms of epi[INVESTIGATOR_44187] (both continuous epi[INVESTIGATOR_823362] -controlled epi[INVESTIGATOR_44187]) provided significantly superior 
postoperative analgesia compared with intravenous patient -controlled 
analgesia. [13] The authors concluded that almost without exception, epi[INVESTIGATOR_76199], regardless of analgesic agent, epi[INVESTIGATOR_823363], and type and time of 
pain assessment, provided superior postoperative analgesia compared to 
intravenous patient -controlled analgesia (IVPCA).  Although none of these studies 
included patients specifically undergoing liver and/or pancreatic surgery.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_1141723] found that there is reduc ed sedation 
with less respi[INVESTIGATOR_11800], improved out -of-bed mobilization, faster 
return of bowel function (ileus) with improved food intake, long -lasting effects on 
exercise capacity, as well as significant reductions in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], all of whic h 
led to the added benefit of cost effective healthcare with decreased hospi[INVESTIGATOR_117253]. [37-42] Epi[INVESTIGATOR_823364] a recent meta -analysis. [43] One of the 
more recent measures of pos toperative recovery has to do with patient 
satisfaction and overall perioperative quality of life. Several recent studies found 
improved impact on overall patient satisfaction and superior perioperative quality 
of life (QOL) scores in those receiving TEA c ompared to IVPCA. [31, 39]  
Additional research is needed to validate these claims in patients undergoing 
liver and/or pancreatic surgery as well as to develop optimal measures of 
postoperative recovery and satisfaction  in all surgical patients . 
 
2.[ADDRESS_1141724] ays resulting in significantly 
lower hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14051]. [38, 44]  There is also recent speculation that opi[INVESTIGATOR_823365] a significant role in cancer recurrence with clinical data 
suggesting that methods of analgesic  technique may play a role in tumor 
dissemination and recurrence. [45-47] In an animal model of surgical -induced 
tumor seeding and metastasis, researchers found that the addition of regional 
analgesia (spi[INVESTIGATOR_823366]) reduced retention of shed tumor cells by [CONTACT_46431] 70%. A 
similar benefit was observed when studying the actual development of 
metastas is.[48] In addition to the clinical observations, there is also evolving 
basic science literat ure suggesting that narcotics  affect tumor growth. [49] 
Considerable evidence suggests that narcotics  facilitate metastasis both via 
suppression of critical anti -tumor immune functions and by [CONTACT_823431]. Acute and chronic administration of opi[INVESTIGATOR_823367] a combination of central and 
peripheral mechanisms. Peripherall y exogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_823368], NK -cell 
activity, cytokine secretion, lymphocyte proliferative responses to mitogens, and 
phagocytic activity. [50] Signals of central origin may be relayed through 1) the 
hypothalamic -pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] -adrenal axis resulting in the production of glucocorticoids, 
which are immunosuppressive, and 2) the sympathetic nervous system eliciting 
the release of biologic amines, which in turn, also reduces 
immunocompetence. [51] Alternative mechanisms by [CONTACT_285799][INVESTIGATOR_823369]: induction of nitric -oxide  (NO) upregulation and 
angiogenesis by [CONTACT_5060][INVESTIGATOR_2438]. NO also mediates increased vascular permeability, 
which could both increase the release of cancer cells into the circulation and 
increase extravasation of circulating tumor cells and the formation of new 
meta stases. Nitric oxide also regulates endothelial cell proliferation, migration, 
and protease release – all of which are important for angiogenesis. [52] Vascular 
Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) plays a key role in angiogenesis. Recent 
evidence indicates that opi[INVESTIGATOR_823370] -induced angiogenesis, an effect  
that is nearly completely blocked by [CONTACT_5060][INVESTIGATOR_40500]. [53] A large, multicenter, 
prospective, randomized trial investigating the influence of type of analgesia 
(intravenous narcotics versus epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873] a nalgesia) on cancer recurrence is 
currently underway. [54]  
 
2.7 Analgesia in Liver and Pancreatic Surgery  
 
- Despi[INVESTIGATOR_823371] a variety of other 
surgical procedures, postoperative epi[INVESTIGATOR_823372] /or pancreatic surgery at most centers. This is 
due for a variety of reasons such as concerns of longer procedure times, greater 
initial costs, invasiveness of the procedure, fear of increased complications  in this 
unique subset of patients , and clinical benef its that may in fact be 
underwhelming. No randomized controlled trials have been performed evaluating 
the efficacy or safety of epi[INVESTIGATOR_823373].  
 
- There is little data available regarding epi[INVESTIGATOR_823374]. 
In a retrospective analysis of patients undergoing pancreatic resection epi[INVESTIGATOR_823375] a modest reduction in postoperative pain  scores , 
Protocol 2011 -0146  
November 12, 2015  
Page 8 
 
however those patients were more likely to require intensive care un it admissions 
and required more frequent alterations of analgesics. In that series epi[INVESTIGATOR_823375] a non -significant increase in blood losses and 
fluid requirements. The groups (TEA vs. IVPCA) did not differ in bowel function, 
length s of stay, morbidities, or mortalities. [55] Others found, also retrospectively, 
that epi[INVESTIGATOR_823376], which may theoretically compromise enteric 
anastomoses, gastrointestinal recovery, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_4806]. [56] In contrast, 
another analysis in those undergoing pancreatic procedures found that patients 
treated with epi[INVESTIGATOR_823377], comp ared with 
subjects receiving IV analgesia  who demonstrated a higher incidence of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -
related adverse effects such as sedation and respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341]. [57] 
 
- The data on epi[INVESTIGATOR_823378] . 
In a retrospective analysis of patients comparing epi[INVESTIGATOR_823379], epi[INVESTIGATOR_823380]. [58] Data from li ver 
transplantation literature has identified a high prevalence of hemostatic 
abnormalities in patients undergoing major hepatic resection while receiving 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_44187]. [59] In contrast, a recent study found that epi[INVESTIGATOR_823381], but only promotes 
redistribution of blood, thus decreasing both venous return and portal vein 
pressure, which in fact may contribute  to reduced hepatic congestion and 
reduced surgical blood loss. [60] None of these studies evaluated effective pain 
control.  
 
 2.8 Current Institutional Practice  
 
- The primary indication for TEA should be pain relief for open abdominal or 
thoracic surgery as there is sufficient Level 1 evidence that it may provi de 
improved  analgesia than intravenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. In our current practice the decision 
for epi[INVESTIGATOR_823382]. Based on our 
institution’s extensive experience, the use of perioperative epi[INVESTIGATOR_823383]. Observed 
advantages of this approach are higher patient postoperative pain satisfaction, 
increased efficiency, less sed ation, lower opi[INVESTIGATOR_375324], and decrease in 
postoperative complications, particularly in higher -risk patients. We believe as 
others, that the clinical advantages of TEA outweigh the greater initial cost and 
invasiveness of this technique. [61] Due to our significant experience with both 
local-regional anesthetic techniques (>2000 TEA/year) and systemic opi[INVESTIGATOR_50352], as well as our established dedicated inpatient Acute Pain Service, 
patients undergoing liver and/or pancreatic sur gery at this institution currently 
receive either IVPCA or TEA for management of their postoperative pain as 
standard of care.  
 
- The choice of postoperative analgesic regimens has implications for our current 
analgesic practice, particularly when consider ing the use of an indwelling 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_823384]/or  pancreatic resection. We 
currently understand that disorders of coagulation occur after hepatic resection 
Protocol [ADDRESS_1141725] normal preoperative coagulation and liver  function 
tests. In our experience, the PT returns to normal within 5 days. Transiently 
impaired hepatic synthesis after major liver resection may account for this 
imbalance in hemostatic mechanisms. [62] In addition, due to prolonged biliary 
obstruction in patients with pancreatic head malignancies, abnormalities in 
vitamin K dependent coagulation factors are common. [63] The safe conduct of 
care for liver an d/or pancreatic resection patients must take into accoun t the 
possibility of these phenomena. Until these hemostatic abnormalities are better 
understood, the anesthesiologist and surgeon caring for patients undergoing liver 
and/or pancreatic surgery must weigh the theoretical risk of epi[INVESTIGATOR_823385]. 
Further studies to characterize the hemostatic abnormalities after liver and /or 
pancreatic resection are warranted. Important considerations include discussion 
with the surgical team, m easuring perioperative coagulation, and heightened 
clinical monitoring in the postoperative period. In our experience we have not had 
any significant epi[INVESTIGATOR_823386] a single epi[INVESTIGATOR_823387] 20,000 catheter placements.  
 
- The decrease in the use of TEA for patients undergoing liver and/or pancreatic 
resection at other institutions may paradoxically result in more complications, as 
loss of expertise in this technique becomes an issue, thus a critical need for level 
1 data to  support the use of this modality in these patients . Our hypothesis is that 
TEA is improves pain control compared to IVPCA in patients undergoing liver 
and/or pancreatic resection with improved patient satisfaction and perioperative 
quality of life without  significant risk of epi[INVESTIGATOR_823388]. In addition 
the limitation of systemic opi[INVESTIGATOR_823389], As a result of the following 
motivational factors: concerns about the effectiveness of TEA  and safety in those 
patients undergoing liver or pancreatic resection, the lack of randomized 
controlled data supporting its use in this patient population , the increasing 
evidence regarding potential immunologic benefits of regional analgesia in 
cancer patients, the recent national demand for assessment of optimal patient 
recovery and perioperative satisfaction, our considerable experience and 
expertise wit h both modalities of postoperative analgesia, and the appropriate 
infrastructure and organizational leadership already in place at this institution, we 
have proposed a novel and much needed clinical postoperative analgesic trial 
with associated laboratory and patient -directed correlates in this subset of 
patients.  We have designed this study to reflect the current clinical practice 
standards of postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing liver/and or 
pancreatic surgery.

Numeric /Visual  Pain Scale  (0-10) at various time points in the clinical 
record per current inpatient policies (Appendix F).  Beginning in the PACU 
after surgery, pain will be assessed  by [CONTACT_823433]. In the 
overnight recovery suite and general floor pain will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_823434] [ADDRESS_1141730] 6hrs postop, the next 18hrs, and each 
24hr period thereafter. The pain scores for each 24 hour period after this 
will be averaged (as many as are collected). Pain will re -assessed by 
[CONTACT_823435] 1 hour after every anal gesic intervention per 
current practice on all nursing floors. All dosing alterations, changes, and 
total narcotic/analgesic use will be documented in the clinical record per 
current practice.

6.5.2 - The Acute Pain Service team/nurse will assess all pati ents in 
both groups (TEA and IVPCA). Therapeutic analgesic interventions in the 
TEA group will be per discretion of the Acute Pain Service per current 
practice. Therapeutic interventions in the IVPCA group will be per 
discretion of the primary surgical tea m per current practice  and the 
primary surgical team will be blinded to the Acute Pain Service 
assessment of patients in IVPCA group . 
 
 6.6 Postoperative Quality of Life and Recovery Questionnaires  
 
- Several postoperative Quality of Life and Surgical Recovery instruments 
will be filled out by [CONTACT_823436]. Please refer to 
7.2.2 for details.  
  
7. Measured Outcomes (TEA and IVPCA)  
 
7.1 Primary Endpoints  
 
 7.1.1  - Pain scores ( Numeric/Visual Pain Scale ) 
 
Pain score AUC within the first [ADDRESS_1141731] 48 hours will 
be compared between TEA and IVPCA g roups for the primary 
analysis.  
 
 7.1.2  - Quality of Life  
 
- Patients will complete a validated SF -8, Acute Recall 
QOL survey ( preoperatively and then at approximately 
24hrs after surgery) (Appendix G)  
 
- Patients will complete a validated SF-36v2, Acute Recall 
QOL survey  (preoperatively and then prior to discharge or

  7.2.2  - Quality of Recovery/Patient Satisfaction  
 
- Several short (5 -10 minute), simple survey instruments 
will be utilized in this study to assess patient -centered 
perioperative pain control, and overall recovery, 
satisfaction. Although all of these survey instruments have 
been validated in other studie s, none have been applied in  
the evaluation of patients undergoing liver and/or 
pancreatic surgery. The use of multiple instruments with 
some overlap in measures allows  for redundancy in 
assessments and the determination of the accura cy of 
patient  reportin g. Such data will  assist in comparing the 
efficacy of these various instruments in capturing the “true” 
quality of recovery in this subset of patients. Any variations 
and discrepancies in the reported redundant measures will 
assist in the formulation of a subsequent improved 
instrument for validation on a greater scale . 
 
- The Health Outcomes Recovery Questionnaire (HORQ), 
a validated postoperative recovery instrument, will be 
administered daily for the first 5 postoperative days and 
includes questions rega rding patient satisfaction, daily 
activities, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related symptoms (Appendix I).[64] 
 
- The Postoperative Pain Survey  (PPS) , an outcome -
oriented validated survey to assess quality improvement in 
postoperative pain management , will be administered daily 
for the first  5 postoperative days (Appendix J).[65] 
 
- The Opio id-related Symptom Distress Scale (SDS), a 
validated and reliable measurement tool  that measures  
twelve opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] -related symptoms , will be administered  daily 
for the first 5 postoperative days (Appendix K).[66] 
 
- The Quality of Rec overy Survey (QoR), a useful and 
validated summary measure of recovery after anesthesia 
and surgery, will be administered daily for the first 5 
postoperative days (Appendix L).[67]

assays will be from optional blood collected as described in 
5.2.2.  
 
7.2.4 - Pain score at each time point  
 
- Mean pain scores at various  time points will be compared 
between groups (TEA vs. IVPCA). There will be 6 specific 
timepoints that will be used for secordary  analysis as each 
timepoint will be an independent measure and may differ 
between groups dependent on duration from surgery as 
was found in previous studies : 1). mean pain scores 
compared  between groups at 6 hrs postop; 2). mean pain 
scores compared  between groups for subsequent 18hrs 
postop; 3). mean pain scores compared  between groups 
over 24hrs on postop day #2;  4). mean pain scores 
compared  between groups over 24hrs on postop day #3;  
5). mean pain scores compared  between groups over 
24hrs on postop day #4; and 6). mean pain scores 
compared  between groups over 24hrs on postop day #5.   
  
8.0 Statistical Considerations  
 
 8.1 Methodology  
 
- This is a two -arm randomized non -blinded study whose primary 
objectives are to compare postoperative pain scores and quality of life 
(QOL) scores in patients undergoing liver and/or pancreatic resection 
between those receiving TEA versus IVPCA. Eligible pa tients will be 
randomized in a 3:1 allocation ratio to the treatment group of TEA or 
IVPCA group (to represent our current institutional practice as well as 
to allow a more accurate determination of overall TEA failures and 
complications). Randomization wi ll be stratified by [CONTACT_823438] 
(liver or pancreatic - 1:1). The randomization will be conducted by [CONTACT_823439]. Pain will be 
assessed using a numeric/visual pain score at various timepoints. The 
pain scores will be averaged for each patient and be compared 
between TEA and IVPCA groups at specific time points as follows: 
pain scores for the first 6 hours after surgery, pain scores for the next 
18hrs after surgery, pain scores for each subsequent 24hr p eriod after 
surgery until postoperative day #[ADDRESS_1141733]. QOL will be assessed pre - and postoperatively using SF -
8 and SF -36v2. These validated instruments will score 8 domains that 
will be reduced to two summary measures scales, Physical 
Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Health Component 
Summary (MCS). Scoring will be performed utilizing proprietary 
certified scoring software from the vendor. QOL scores will be 
calculated and compared between the two groups of patient s. 
 
- Categorical data will be tabulated with frequency and percentages, 
and continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics mean, standard deviation, median and range. The primary 
Protocol [ADDRESS_1141734] or 
Fisher’s exact test will be used to compare the binary outcomes 
between the two arms, which are related to effects of pain on patie nts’ 
movement or mood, such as pain’s influence on mobility or 
movement, cough or breath deeply, sleep and mood. Generalized 
estimating equation (GEE)  regression models will be fit to estimate 
the treatment effects on the listed binary outcomes. Chi -square test 
will be used to compare the categorical items of QOL pre and post 
surgery between the two treatment arms, the same method will also 
be used to c ompare the changes pre -postoperative  in items of QOL 
between the two arms as well.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_1141735] a successful resection , which may bias  their 
response to pain and quality of recovery and bias the questionnaire 
responses.  Based on p revious work at our and other institutions , it is 
expected that up to 30% of  patients will not be evaluable due to various 
reasons, including ineligibility, patient withdrawal from the study, 
unresectable disease, and failure to complete or inaccurate comp letion of 
questionnaires.   Based on historical information, if the difference in mean 
pain score between the two evaluable treatment groups of patients is [ADDRESS_1141736] deviation is 1.5, with a total of 140 evaluable  
patients ( 105 in TEA group and 35 in IVPCA group), the study will yield a 
92% power to detect the difference , using a two -sample t-test at a two -
sided significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_1141737] a 99% 
power to detect a difference of [ADDRESS_1141738] deviation of 9 using a two -sided Student’s t -test with a type I 
error of 0.05.  All statistical analyses will be performed with an intent t o 
Protocol [ADDRESS_1141739], since they are at higher risk of perioperative complications.  
Major hepatectomy is define d as resection of 3 or more segments of the 
liver, while minor hepatectomy is resection of 1 or 2 segments.  With a 
target accrual to 200 patients and 140 evaluable patients, we anticipate 
enrolling 70 patients undergoing major hepatectomy.  Based on our 
previous work it is expected that half of the 140 patients will undergo 
major hepatectomy.  With 70 patients who undergo major hepatectomy 
and assuming a 3:1 randomization to the experimental arm and control 
arm (51 in TEA group and 17 in IVPCA group), this  sample size will have 
80% power to detect an effect size of 0.796 (i.e. 0.796 -SD) in the mean 
pain scores between the two treatment arms, using a two -sample t -test at 
a two -sided significance level of 0.05.  Two -sample t -tests or Wilcoxon 
rank sum test wi ll be used to compare mean pain scores within 48 hours 
postoperatively between TEA and IVPCA arms.  
 
9. Data and Protocol Management  
 
After obtaining informed consent, patients will be registered by [CONTACT_823440]/Surgery Research Nurse, who will register them on the MDACC 
computerized Protocol System. The PI, [CONTACT_823449], and [CONTACT_823450] at Mayo 
Clinic College of Medicine will analyze  the data once the study is closed. Only 
Limited Data Sets (LDS) will be sent to [CONTACT_823451] at Mayo Clinic College of 
Medicine, however, Mayo Clinic will not participate in the analysis or in any part 
of the study. LDS is Protected Health Information that e xcludes the sixteen (16) 
direct identifiers listed in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability  Act (HIPAA). A Data Use 
Agreement will be used to send the data to [CONTACT_823451]. All data obtained will be d e-
identified after the conclusion of the study.  
 
10. Data Safety and Monitoring Board  
 
This study will be monitored by [CONTACT_823441] (DSMB), 
through routine reviews and/or institutional audits. The DSMB reports to the 
President, or his designee, as the on -campus representative of The University of 
[LOCATION_007] Board of Regents. It oversees the data and patient safety issues for 
randomized Phase III clinical trials that originate at UTMDACC; that are 
coordinated or analyzed by [CONTACT_823442] e not being monitored by [CONTACT_823443]; or has been designated as the DSMB for any trial at the request of the 
IRB, the CRC, or institution. The primary objectives of the DSMB are to ensure 
that patients’ rights pertaining to participation in a research s tudy are protected, 
and that patients’ interests are prioritized over the interests of the scientific 
investigation. Responsibilities include :  
 
(a) Review interim analyses of outcome data after 60 evaluable patients 
are enrolled (prepared by [CONTACT_823444]) approved by [CONTACT_823445], and to 
Protocol 2011 -0146  
November 12, 2015  
Page 19 
 
recommend, if necessary, whether the study needs to be changed 
or terminated based on these a nalyses;  
 
(b) Determine whether, and to whom, outcome results should be 
released prior to the reporting of study results;  
 
(c) Review interim toxicity data and efficacy of treatment;  
 
(d) Review major research modifications proposed by [CONTACT_823446] (e.g., 
termination, droppi[INVESTIGATOR_823401], increasing target sample size).  
 
The DSMB consists of not more than 15 members (including the Chai r) as 
recommended by [CONTACT_584747], or his designee, for each fiscal year. The 
committee includes physicians, statisticians and lay member(s), and will be 
selected based on their experience, reputation for objectivity, absence of conflicts 
of interest (or the appearance of the same), and knowledge of good clinical trial 
methodology.  The committee meets [ADDRESS_1141740] access to the identifiable information from 
this study.   
 
- Identifiers (such as name [CONTACT_39650]) will be collected but will 
be replaced by [CONTACT_823447]. The key linking to these 
numbers will  be retained in a secure computer file. Access to this file will be 
limited to the Principal Investigator, Study Co -Chairs, and the authorized 
research team. All computer files are password -protected and stored on 
institution computers behind the instituti on firewall to further ensure database 
security and all records are kept confidential.  Any reports or publications resulting 
from this study will not include any personal identifiers.

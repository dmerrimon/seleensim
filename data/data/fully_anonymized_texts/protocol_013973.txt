Version 8-15-2024    Summary/Abstract  
 
Study Title:  Vapocoolant Application for Pain Reduction during Office -based Gynecologic 
Procedures: a Randomized Controlled Trial (VAPOR)  
 
Background: Gynecologic office procedures are common and painful. For office -based 
procedures, providers routinely use a lidocain e injection into the cervix, known as a paracervical 
block, to decrease pain. However, the paracervical block itself is painful. Vapocoolant spray has 
been found in other specialties to decrease pain with injections, but it has not yet been 
investigated in  gynecologic procedures. Vapocoolant spray is easy to us e, rapi[INVESTIGATOR_575288] , 
inexpensive (approximately 5 dollars for a single use vial) and readily available.  
 
Objective: To determine if vapocoolant spray reduces pain associated with paracervical block.  
 
Methods/Design: We propose a randomized, placebo -controlled, single -blinded trial among 
patients receiving a paracervical block. All patients will receive ibuprofen prior to the procedure 
per current standard of care in our clinic. Vapocoolant or placebo (st erile water) will be sprayed 
on the cervix prior to administering a paracervical block. Exclusion criteria includes previous use 
of a vapocoolant prior to an injection, use of an anxiolytic, narcotic or sedation prior to the 
procedure, or contraindication to receiving ibuprofen. Our primary outcome is pain at the time of 
the paracervical block using a 100 -mm visual analog scale (VAS). Secondary outcomes include 
pain at tenaculum placement, pain the remainder of the procedure, patient satisfaction, provider 
rating of ease of vapocoolant use.   
 
Outcomes: We hypothesize that the vapocoolant spray will decrease patients’ pain at the time of 
the paracervical block and tenaculum placement. We hypothesize that the vapocoolant spray will 
have no effect on pain for t he remainder of the procedure. Patients who receive the vapocoolant 
will have high satisfaction and providers will find it easy to use.  
 
Sample size and population : A difference of 30% or 13 -20 mm on a 100 mm pain VAS 
is  considered clinically significant [1-3]. Based on existing research, we estimate mean pain with 
paracervical block to be between [ADDRESS_1182745] deviation of 25mm [1, 
4, 5] . To detect a 30% difference in pain scores between the two groups with an alpha of 0.05 
and 80% power and accounting for 10% participant drop -out, we will recruit 98 total 
participants, with 49  participants in each group.

Version 8-15-2024    Section 1: Background and Objections  
1.[ADDRESS_1182746] -trimester 
procedural abortion are commonly done in the [LOCATION_002] under local anesthetic. Local 
anesthetic is safer and less expensive than moderate sedation, particularly for these very brief 
procedures ; however , local anesthetic may not adequately manage pain for some patients. The 
majority (78 -97%) of patients report at lea st moderate pain with first trimester procedural 
abortion  [6]. 
 
Many providers routinely use a lidocaine injection known as a paracervical block (PCB) to 
decrease pain with first trimester procedural abortion, and occasionally with other gynecologic 
procedures such as IUD insertions and endometrial biopsies  [1, 5, 6] . However, the PCB itself is 
painful. Renner et al noted PCB administration was more painful than a sham (mean 55 mm 
compared with sham 30 mm, P<.001 using a 100  mg Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) 5. Chin et al 
evaluated pain at the time of   PCB with buffered and plain lidocaine and noted median VAS 
scores for the PCB injection to be 30 (interquartile range (IQR) 15 .3-64.5) for buffered lidocaine 
and and 44.5 (IQR 18.3 -65) for plain lidocaine (p=0.32) 4.  
 
Before the PCB can be placed, the clinician applies a tenaculum, which is a single -toothed 
instrument that punctures the cervix so that it can be moved and stabilized during the procedure. 
Placement o f the tenaculum is painful. Providers routinely place 2 ml of anesthetic via 
intracervical injection at the anterior lip of the cervix to reduce pain as the tenaculum punctures 
the cervix, which has been shown to reduce pain associated with the tenaculum, however the 
injection itself is also painful  [7].  An intervention to reduce pain prior to tenaculum and PCB 
placement could reduce the pain experienced during the procedure and improve the overall 
patient experience.    
 
Vapocoolant spray consists of pentafluoropropane and tetrafluoroethane which causes the skin or 
mucosa to become cold and thereby [CONTACT_850734]  [8]. Cold decreases pain through multiple 
channels, including stimulation of peripheral neural receptors, alteration of neural transmission 
velocity, deceleration of transmission of pain signal to central nervous system and distraction 
from pain [9, 10] . Vapocoolant spray is currently being used across other fields of medicine to 
decrease pain during injections, IV starts, blood draws, and nerve blocks  [7, 8, 10 -16]. 
Vapocoolant spray has been used in dental procedures, demonstrating safety when used on 
mucosal areas  [17, 18] .  
 
Vapocoolant spray is easy to us e, acts rapi[INVESTIGATOR_850726]. A single 
use vial costs approximately $5.00  [19]. Vapocoolant spray represents a novel intervention for 
the management of pain during gynecologic procedure s of any kind.   We were unable to identify 
any previous studies evaluating the use of vapocoolant spray in the vagina or on the cervix to 
reduce pain with gynecologic procedures, however existing research using vapocoolant in dental 
procedures has confirme d the safety of their use in mucosal areas  [17, 18] . Therefore, we plan to 
evaluate if vapocoolant decreases pain with paracervical block insertion. The vapocoolant spray 
has a lasting effect of one minute, therefore, we hypothesize that it will reduce pain with the 
Page [ADDRESS_1182747] it to reduce pain 
with the abortion procedure (dilation and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]).   
 
Our primary outcome is to determine if vapocoolant spray reduces pain at the time of 
paracervical block placement. Our secondary outcomes are to e valuate if vapocoolant spray 
reduces pain with tenaculum placement, pain with the remainder of the procedure,  patient 
satisfaction, side effects and provider’s perception of ease of use of the vapocoolant spray.  
 
The study will be conducted in compliance w ith the protocol approved by [CONTACT_850735], and according to Good Clinical Practice standards, applicable 
federal regulations, and Queen’s M edical Center (QMC) institutional policies and procedures.   
 
1.2 Objectives and Hy pothesis   
Our study objective is to determine if vapocoolant spray reduces pain at the time of paracervical 
block placement.   
 
Our secondary outcomes are to evaluate if vapocoolant spray reduces pain with tenaculum 
placement, pain with dilation, pain with aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]. We will also evaluate patient satisfaction, 
side effects and provider’s perception of ease of use of the vapocoolant spray.  
 
Before the procedure, we will collect demographic information from the patient and have the 
patients complete a baselin e anxiety measure on a visual analog scale (VAS) (all data collection 
forms can be found in Appendix 5). Before, during and immediately after the procedure, we will 
use the VAS to evaluate patients' pain. We will also use the VAS immediately after the 
procedure to determine the patient’s satisfaction and the provider’s perception of ease of use of 
the vapocoolant spray (all data collection forms can be found in Appendix 5).  
Section 2: Criteria for Subject Selection  
2.1 Sample Size and Duration  
A difference of 30% or 13 -20 mm on a 100 mm pain VAS is considered clinically significant  [1-
3]. Based on existing research, we estimate mean pain with paracervical block to be between [ADDRESS_1182748] deviation of 25mm  [1, 4, 5] . To detect a 30% difference in 
pain scores between the two groups with an alpha of 0.05 and 80% power and accounting for 
10% participant drop -out, we will recruit [ADDRESS_1182749] -trimester pregnancy or an early pregnancy loss. Chin 202 0 study was 
performed with this same physician group in their prior practice location, which had nearly 
identical set -up and patient flow as the Queen's POB1 office. Th at study took 15 months for 
participant enrollment. Currently, at our clinic, we do about eight procedures requiring 
paracervical block per week. Assuming a 50% enrollment rate, enrollment would take about [ADDRESS_1182750] of patients who are having a procedure requiring a paracervical 
block.  This study will be conducted at The Queen’s Medical Center POB1 Clinic 1004.  
 
2.3 Eligibility Criteria  
 Inclusion Criteria  
o Age 18 years of age or older  
o Undergoing a procedur e requiring paracervical block in the  Queens’s POB1 Suite 
1004 office  (e.g. abortion <13weeks 6days, IUD insertion, laminaria placement)  
o English -speaking  
o Able and willing to sign the informed consent form and agree to terms of the 
study  
 Exclusion Criteria  
o Required or requested narcotics, anxiolytics, IV sedation, or general anesthesia 
for the procedure   
o Declines or has a contraindication/allergy to ibuprofen   
o Previously received vapocoolant spray in a medical setting   
o Contraindications or allergies to lidoc aine for paracervical block or vapocoolant 
spray components (1,1,3,3 -pentafluoropropaine or 1,1,1,2 -tetrafluroethane)  
 Of note, the manufacturer does state not for use in diabetic patients or patients with poor 
circulation. This is due to cooling/freezing effects on areas with poor vascularization like 
fingers. As the cervix is well perfused, we believe it is safe to use t he vapocoolant spray 
on diabetics.

Section 3: Methods and Procedures  
 
3.1  Overall Study Design  
 Prospective, Single Blind, Randomized, Placebo Controlled Trial study of patients 
receiving paracervical block for a gynecologic procedure   
 This prospective randomized control trial will consist of two study arms. As participants 
are enrolled they will randomly be assigned to Arm 1, vapocoolant spray, or to Arm 2, 
normal saline placebo spray.   
 Allocation 1:1  

Page 9 of 25 
 
Version 8-15-2024     Participants will be randomized to recei ve Num Vapocoolant Spray versus Nature’s 
Tears Spray Placebo (Sterile water).   
 Settings and locations  
o  Queen’s Medical Center POB1 Suite [ADDRESS_1182751] counseling for that procedure 
and complete informed consent for that procedure. All these steps will be completed prior to the 
patient being informed of their potential eligibility for the research study.  
 The doctor  will then evaluate if the patient meets inclusion/exclusion criteria for this 
study. If patient is a candidate for the study, the OBGYN resident/CFP Fellow/Attending 
will approach the patient about being in the study  and consent the patient if they  desir e to 
participate in the study,  
 The  patient receive their pre -procedure medications (ibuprofen 600 mg and whatever 
other medications are required for the specific procedure the patient is having). After the 
ibuprofen 600 mg  is given, the patient waits 10 minutes  to 4 hours  before the procedure 
to ensure the medications are working for the procedure.  
 During this 1 0 minute -4 hour  wait period, the research coordinator will introduce 
themselves to the patient  to complete the Data Collection sheet .  
 
The resea rch coordinator will be present  to the room for the procedure.  
 
Allocation: if a patient opts to participate in the study, they will be randomly assigned to either 
vapocoolant spray or placebo spray. They will be assigned by [CONTACT_850736][INVESTIGATOR_850727].  
 
3.3 Screening/Preoperative Evaluation  
Potential participants will be identified at their office visits at POB1 Suite 1004 at The Queen’s 
Medical Center.  If a patient  in the clinic  decides to  undergo a procedure which requires a 
paracervical block, the patient will be first consented for their procedure. T hen OBGYN 
resident/CFP fellow/attending will evaluate if the patient meets  inclusion/exclusion criteria  for 
this study . The doctor will dire ctly ask the patient is she has taken anxiolytic that day, desires an 
anxiolytic for the procedure, taken a narcotic or other sedative that day, if the patient has any 
medical condition that forbids them from taking ibuprofen, if the patient does not desir e 
ibuprofen, if the patient has used vapocoolant spray previously.  
 
Based on the answers to these above questions,  the patient’s eligibility for our study will be 
determined . Provider will inform the patient they are eligible for a research study and ask  if they 
are interested in learning more about the study. If they opt to hear more, study physician  will 
meet with the patient and complete the consent process.   
 
Page [ADDRESS_1182752] -procedural care, and their relationship 
with their physician or QMC .   Consent for the study will be obtained by [CONTACT_850737]/or physicians following the informed consent standard operating procedure. After 
enrollment, a copy of the study consent will be given to the subject (see Consent Form 
attachment).  At this time, participants will also receive $[ADDRESS_1182753].  
 
 
3.4 Procedure Setting and Providers  
At The Queen’s Medical Center POB1 Suite 1004 office, one of four complex family planning 
trained providers (all listed as study co -investigators) will perform all procedures. Fellows and 
residents may participate in the  procedure under direct supervision. In study documents, we will 
record the name [CONTACT_850744].  
 
All patients will received standard of care for the procedure they have consented to that requires  
a paracervical block. In terms of the research, the patient will receive standard of care + a spray 
after speculum placement. The spray being either the vapocoolant spray or placebo Nature’s 
Tears. All other aspects of the procedure will remain the same.  
 
Study team will collect pertinent demographic and medical history information (as indicated in  
the data collection form) directly from the patient prior to the procedure  during the [ADDRESS_1182754] 
data from the patient  during the procedure . The provider will ensure that the spray used is not 
visible to the participant or the research assistant throughout the dat a collection period . The spray 
will be placed in the drawer between the patient’s legs, only visible to the doctor performing the 
procedure.  
 
3.8 Blinding  
The participants and the research assistants collecting data from the participant during the 
procedu re will be blinded to study allocation.  
 
The providers performing the procedure will not be blinded. In prior research conducted with 
vapocoolant, the studies were designed to be double blinded, however through personal 
communication with those studies’, D r. Mace, we learned that to provide blinding was almost 
impossible. Even with identical packaging, the providers could determine which product was 
being applied because the vapocoolant is cold on the provider's hand when they spray and turns 
the skin white , while the normal saline drips on contact [CONTACT_8124]  [11, 12] . Based on this, we 
determined we would not be able to blind providers to study group allocation and have used 
other techniques (described below) to reduce the potential bias this lack of blinding may 
introduce.  
 
3.[ADDRESS_1182755] at any point in the study. After study 
consent and randomization but prior to the procedure, patients may be discontinued from study 
participation if the provider deems it necessary, the patient chooses to discontinue, or if 
exclusion criteria are newly identified.   
 
We will follow intention -to-treat principles and analyze all data base d on its allocation regardless 
of whether or not the intervention was received.   
 
3.10 Standardization of Procedure  
Preprocedural  counseling and evaluation are consistent with clinic protocols. All participants will 
receive premedication of 600 mg oral ibu profen before ( 10 minutes to 4 hours) the procedure.   
 
All patients who consent to the study will receive standard counseling prior to their procedure. 
The provider will wear a face mask  during the procedure as is standard of care. The procedure 
will start with a bimanual exam by [CONTACT_13917]. Next, the provider will place a speculum. At this 
Page 12 of 25 
 
Version 8-15-2024    point, participants assigned to Arm 1 will receive vapocoolant spray (treatment), while 
participants assigned to Arm 2 will receive normal sali ne spray (placebo).  
 
The vapocoolant spray is a single -use spray bottle containing (8.5 grams) vapocoolant spray. 
Providers will follow the manufacturer's brochure for the vapocoolant application (Appendix 
6.1). To use the spray, the provider will twist to  break the tamper evident label,  pull off the base 
cap, and then  pull off the sterile barrier tab on the nozzle. From [ADDRESS_1182756] of 1 minute ( [19], Appendix 6.1)   
 
We will plan to use Nature’s Tears  for placebo  in the same method, spraying from [ADDRESS_1182757] from the cervix for 4 -6 seconds.  
 
Clinicians will all be trained to use both the Num vapocoolant spray and Nature’s Tear prior to 
first study patient encounter. Additional supplies will be purchased to allow for all doctors 
involved in the study to practice consistent use of the device fol lowing the Num Vapocoolant 
Application Guide (Appendix 6). Natures Tears is a standard spray can. The provider simply 
needs to hold down the nozzle. To ensure standardization between the two groups, the provider 
will also spray the cervix with Natures Tear  from [ADDRESS_1182758] practices [1, 4, 20]  
 
Paracervical Block Standard Administration:  The providers will inject two ml at the tenaculum 
site, 12 o'clock superficially into the cervix. The provider will then place the tenaculum, using a 
standardized “slow” placement of   the tenaculum (e.g. counting to 10 while placing the 
tenaculum).  
 
Prior  to the procedure, as is standard office protocol, t he MA will prepare a syringe loaded with 
20 ml of 0.5% lidocaine,  [ADDRESS_1182759] the remaining 18 mL 
slowly over 60 seconds into the cervicovaginal junction in two equal  aliquots at 4 and 8 o'clock 
1. We will perform a continuous injection from superficial to deep (3cm) to superficial (injection 
with insertion and withdrawal)  
 
The providers will standardize language during the PCB application to reduce bias or priming of 
the patient. Each provider will use the following language: “You may or may not feel a sharp 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_850728] I am injecting numbing medicine”. This will be repeated as  necessary throughout 
injection of the paracervical at 4 and 8 o'clock 1. 
Page 13 of 25 
 
Version 8-15-2024     
During the procedure, the research assistant will ask the patient to verbally report their level of 
pain based on the 100 mm vis ual analog scale (VAS) at the following points of the procedure:  
1. Prior to the start of the procedure (baseline)  
2. After tenaculum placement  
3. After paracervical block  
4. After gynecologic procedure complete   
5. Five minutes post -procedure  
6. Post procedure: Physician E ase of Use  
 
Post Procedure evaluation  
After the procedure, which is usually about [ADDRESS_1182760] of care. Besides evaluating for bleeding, the provider will 
also evaluate for any side effects from the vapocoolant/placebo,  including second and third 
degrees burns, cryogenic injury, failure of the cannister, bruising, blistering, bleeding, 
pain, blister, cryogenic burn, infection, discharge . 
 
Physician Ease of Use  
We will submit waiver of consent for provider physician inves tigators to collect their evaluation of 
ease of use for each subject. We anticipate ease of use will be uniform, but perhaps the ease of 
use will vary based on patient characteristics, which is why we want to ask the question for each 
subject. Collection o f such data is considered standard in our field whenever a new pain 
management technique is evaluated.  
 
 
3.11 Follow up  
One to two days after the procedure, one of the study investigators will text  and/or call  the 
patient to see if they have any concerns or concerning symptoms. If the patient does report 
concerning symptoms and need for evaluation, the patient will be scheduled for an appointment 
as soon as possible back in the clinic for a physical exam (pelvic exam to evaluate the 
vagina/cervix, if neces sary).  
3.11 Description of the intervention to be studied  
Num is a sterile vapocoolant topi[INVESTIGATOR_850729]. It is made by 623 Medical in Morrisville, NC.   
3.12 Vapocoolant Supply, Packaging, Labeling and Storage  
Num (Vapocoolant Spray) is not currently stocked by [CONTACT_850738]. We will order it as 
part of the research study and have it stocked in our clinic. Num can be ordered in cases of 50 
units. We plan to order 1 -2 cases over the course of the s tudy – as our planned project is a 
sample size of [ADDRESS_1182761] is temperature sensitive 
Page 14 of 25 
 
Version 8-15-2024    and needs to be stored in an environment <140 Degree Fahrenheit. Our clinic has central air 
conditioning and is usually betwe en 65 -85 Degrees Fahrenheit. Num has a shelf life of 3 years.   
 
The placebo (Nature's Tears) is not currently stocked by [CONTACT_850738]. Will will also 
order this medication and have it stocked in our clinic. We plan to order about [ADDRESS_1182762]. Nature’s Tears has a shelf life of 5 years.  
3.13 Data Analysis and Statistical Methods  
We will assess the primary objective by [CONTACT_850739]. If VAS scores are 
normally distributed, we will report means as primary outcomes and use student ’s t-test to 
compare groups. If VAS scores are non -normally distributed, we will report median scores as 
prima ry outcome and use nonparametric testing (i.e. Mann Whitney U test) to compare the two 
groups.   
 
Secondary Outcomes:  
 Patient pre procedure anxiety – VAS  
 Patient pre procedure pain score – VAS  
 Pain with tenaculum placement – VAS  
 Pain with procedure - VAS – 
 Pain 5 minutes after procedure – VAS  
 Satisfaction with pain control during procedure – VAS  
 Satisfaction with procedure – VAS  
 Provider ease of use of product – VAS  
 
We will also use the Student T -test or Mann Whitney U test to assess our secondary objectives  
by [CONTACT_794798]/median difference in pain during other time points in the procedure and 
overall satisfaction with pain.   
 
No interim analysis is planned. [CONTACT_850746] and [CONTACT_850747] will be responsible for protecting and 
monitoring the rights, safety and w elfare of the subjects and can perform an interim analysis if it 
is deemed necessary for determining the safety of continuing the trial.  If more than 5 participants 
note side effects at the 1 -2 day text /phone call  follow up, we will perform an interim 
analysis.  Statistical analysis will be performed with either Excel or SPSS .   Data will be 
analyzed using intention to treat principles.

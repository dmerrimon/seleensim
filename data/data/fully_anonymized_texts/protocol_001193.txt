TITLE: An Open Label Phase II Study of Tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884903] T -Cell Lymphoma  
SPONSOR: Kura Oncology, Inc 
PROTOCOL NUMBER: KO- TIP-002 
STUDY SITES : Multiple centers  
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT: Phase II  
STUDY PERIOD: This  trial was planned to initiate enrollment in the third quarter of 2015. This 
amendment was instituted in July, 2019.  It is estimated that an additional 12 months  may  be 
required to complete all its study objectives . 
OBJECTIVES:  
Primary Objective:  To determine the antitumor activity in terms of ob jective response rate 
(ORR) of tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884905] T -cell l ymphoma (PTCL) . 
Secondary Objective 1 :  To determine the antitumor activity in terms of progression free 
survival (PFS) and duration of response (DOR) of tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884906] s with relapsed or 
refractory PTCL . 
Secondary Objective 2 :  Safety and tolerability of tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884906] s with relapsed or 
refractory PTCL . 
Exploratory Objective:  To explore the feasibility of collecting tissue biopsies , buccal swabs 
and blood samples and analysing these samples for the detection of biomarkers potentially 
related to tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884907] .  The b iomarker analyses may include oncogene panel sequencing 
from tumor tissue samples, immune cytokine profiling from serum samples and Killer cell 
Immunoglobulin- like Receptor ( KIR) genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_884908].  
 
STUDY DESIGN: 
This Phase II study will investigate the antitumor activity in terms of ORR of tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884909] s with relapsed or refractory PTCL. 
Eligible subjects  will receive tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884910] a starting dose of 300 mg, orally with 
food, twice a day ( bid) on Days 1-21 in 28 day cycles (i.e. 3 weeks on / 1 week off). Stepwise 
100 mg dose reductions to control treatment- related, treatment- emergent toxicities are also 
allowed.  In the absence o f unmanageable toxicities, subjects may continue  to receive  tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884911] 12 months in the absence of disease progression and unmanageable toxicity. 
Treatment may continue beyond 12 months upon agreement of the Investigator and Sponsor.

Protocol Amendment 7, 12 JULY 2019 
CONFIDENTIAL   Tumor assessments will be performed at screening , at the Day 22 visit (± 5 days) performed 
during Cycles 2, 4, 6 and once every approximately 12 weeks (cycles 9, 12, 15, etc.) thereafter, 
until disease progression . Additional tumor assessments may be conducted if deemed necessary 
by [CONTACT_737]. Subjects who  discontinue tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884912], withdrawal of subject’s 
consent to study procedures or in itiation of another anticancer therapy. 
Determination of objective tumor response will be performed based on the Lugano Classification 
(Cheson 2014, Appendix II: The Lugano Classification ) and/or measurable cutaneous disease 
according to the modified Severity Weighted Assessment Tool (mSWAT, Olsen 2011, Appendix 
III: Modified Severity Weighted Assessment Tool ).  Subjects who have experienced a complete 
response may be considered for transplantation. Information on this intervention and other subsequent anti -cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_884913].  
Upon disease progression, subjects will be followed approximately every [ADDRESS_1237999], whichever occurs firs t. 
Information on subsequent anticancer therapy will be collected. 
All subjects will be followed -up for safety during treatment and  for approximately 30 additional 
days after treatment discontinuation  (or until immediately before the administration of another 
anticancer treatment) .  Additional safety follow up may be conducted if unresolved toxicity is 
present at the End of Treatment visit.

STATISTICAL METHODS:  
As part of Amendment 6, up to 42 evaluable subjects could be enrolled (re ceived tipi[INVESTIGATOR_7734]), 
with the first [ADDRESS_1238012] the null hypothesis of ORR less than 10% vs alternative 
hypothesis is at least 30%.   
Up to [ADDRESS_1238013] s will be enrolled; if 2-[ADDRESS_1238014] if the 
true ORR is higher than 10%. T o determine the total trial size, a response of interest of 30% is 
assumed.  This design provides 80% power to detect a difference between 10% and 30% ORR at 
one-sided significance level of 0.087. Using this design, the probability of terminating the study at the end of stage 1 if the true ORR is 10% is 0.697 while the probability of terminating the 
study at the end of stage 1 if the true ORR is 30% is 0.113. 
Based on the observed antitumor activity during stage 1 and stage 2 of the study (2 subjects 
enrolled with AITL and both subjects achieved a partial response), an AITL cohort will be 
enrolled (N = 12) according to  Amendment [ADDRESS_1238015] 30% is 82.6 %.   

Tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598690]-TIP-[ADDRESS_1238016] high levels of CXCL12  gene expression by [CONTACT_884989] a longer PFS compared to subjects with low expression, a CXCL12+  cohort will be 
enrolled (N = 12) according to  Amendment 6  to the protoc ol.  With this sample size, if 2 or more 
responses are observed, the probability that the true response rate in CXCL12+ subjects is 10% 
or higher is at least 8 9%. 
Upon the observation of 5 confirmed responses in the AITL cohort, and 5 confirmed responses in 
the CXCL12+  cohort , including 2 of them in subjects with tumors of AITL histology, the trial 
was amended to include up to 20 additional subjects with AITL and related T follicular helper cell tumors  in the AITL cohort in order to further characterize the safety and tolerability of 
tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884914]. The choice of 20 additional subjects was empi[INVESTIGATOR_884915] n o statisti cal hypotheses will be tested in this 
extension. Including Amendment 7, up to 70 evaluable subjects in total may be enrolled.

T1/[ADDRESS_1238022] specific inhibitor of farnesyl transferase (FTase)  to 
enter clinical studies  and has been evaluated in over 70 clinical oncology and hematology 
studies.  
Brief information on tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884919]; more extensive i nformation is 
provided in the Investigator’s Brochure (Tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598725]’s Brochure, Edition 13, March 
2017) .  
5.1.1 Mechanism of Action  
Tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598727] a potent and selective nonpeptide inhibitor of  FTase. FTase is an enzyme that 
couples an isoprenyl group, the 15 carbon farnesyl moiety, to proteins for membrane localization 
including the Ras family of oncoproteins. The Ras family (KRAS, NRAS and HRAS) are among 
the most frequently mutated oncogenes in human cancer.  Although FTase inhibitors were originally developed to target Ras mutant cancers, tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884920], likely due to the 
observation that KRAS and NRAS undergo an alternate prenylation, geranylgeranylation, when FTase is inhibited (Baines 2011,  Takashima 2013).  
The correlative biology of FTase inhibition by [CONTACT_105925][INVESTIGATOR_884921]. FTase inhibitors likely exert their cy totoxic effects by [CONTACT_884990], Rheb and 
CENP families.  In vitro, the concentration resulting in 50% of maximum inhibition values for 
isolated human FTase depends on the nature of its substrate, ranging from 0.86 nM for lamin B, a nuclear protein, to 7.9 nM for KRAS.  
Tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884922] a variety of cancers including 
hematological cancers such as AML, MDS and certain lymphomas in multiple clinical trials (Martinelli 2008) . Defining the patient subset or biomarker-defined subset where tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884923] a key focus in the tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884924]. 
5.1.2 Clinical Pharmacology  
Tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884925] 2 to 4 hours after dosing. The absolute bioavailability of tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884926] 29.3% in cancer patients and similar in healthy subjects. Concomitant intake of a 
high fat meal increases the extent of absorption by [CONTACT_5554] 26.8% compared with 
administration under fasting conditions.  
Tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884927] -life of about 36 minutes, followed by a dominant 
elimination half -life of about 2.4 hours, and a slower terminal half-life of about 19 hours.

Protocol Amendment 7, 12 JULY 2019 
CONFIDENTIAL   Tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884928]. Linear pharmacokinetics are observed for 
tablets over the dose range of 100 mg through 600 mg. Metabol ism and elimination are primarily 
hepatic. Steady state is reached within 2 to 3 days, with no evidence of drug accumulation or 
induction of drug metabolism over time. In adults, the apparent oral clearance of tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884929], sex, body weight, body surface area or the presence of liver metastases.  
Tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884930] 100 mg bid.  Following a single 600 mg dose, both total  and 
unbound plasma concentrations of tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884931] a 12- hour interval exceed those req uired to 
inhibit farnesylation.  Inhibition of FTase is reversible within 3 to 7 days upon discontinuation of tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598721].  
Increases in tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884932]  18% to 34% have been consistently observed after its 
administration with food and therefore, tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884933].  H owever,  the magnitude of the food effect is small 
compared to the variability of pharmacokinetic parameters.  
Pharmacokinetic data suggest that H2 antagonists and proton pump inhibitors do not alter the 
exposure to tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884934] a clinically significant extent. Subjects may use proton pump inhibitors 
or H2 antagonists during the treatment portion of this study. However, subjects should be instructed to use antacids (magnesium or aluminum containing products) at least 2 hours before or after intake of oral study drug. 
Tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598727] a substrate for cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes and glucuronosyltransferase. 
Inhibitors of CYP 450 enzymes, including azole antifungals and omeprazole, did not reduce the 
clearance of tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884935]. However, antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_884936]450 enzymes (e.g. phenytoin, phenobarbital and carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) reduce plasma 
concentrations of tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884937].  Therefore,  it is recommended that subjects use non-enzyme-inducing anti-
convulsants (e.g., gabapentin, topi[INVESTIGATOR_052], valproate) if necessary while taking tipi[INVESTIGATOR_7734].  
In addition, population pharmacokinetic analyses evaluated the influence of various concomitant medic ations on the pharmacokinetics of tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884938]. Amphotericin, antiemetics, 
5HT3 antagonists (dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron, and tropi[INVESTIGATOR_14960]), antifungal azoles (econazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, and miconazole), benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], ciprofloxacin, and corticosteroids appeared to have no discernible impact on the plasma concentrations of tipi[INVESTIGATOR_7734].  
5.2 Clinical Experience

acute leukemia s, in which clinical responses occurred in 10 (29%) of the 34 evaluable patients, 
including 2 complete remissions (Karp 2001). Subjects we re dosed at doses ranging from 100 
mg to 1200 mg twice daily for 21 days. In a second phase 2 trial in subjec ts with MD S, tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884940]-TIP-002           Page 19

CONFIDENTIAL   showed activity in 3 of 27 subjects , resulting in two complete remission s and one partial 
remission  (Kurzrock 2004). The drug was administered at a dose of [ADDRESS_1238023]. Subsequent phase 2 and 3 studies in acute myeloid leukemia 
and MDS  failed to confirm a clinical benefit derived from tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884941]. 
A phase 2 study of tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884942] 93 adult subjects with relapsed or refractory 
lymphoma (Wi tzig 2011) . Subjects received tipi[INVESTIGATOR_7734] 300 mg twice daily on days 1-21 of each 
28-day cycle. The median number of prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26615] 5 (range, 1-17). For the aggressive B-cell, indolent B -cell, and T -cell and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL/T) groups, the response rates were 
17% (7/42), 7% (1/15), and 31% (11/36), respectively. Of the 19 responders, 7 were diffuse large 
B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), 7 T-cell NHL, 1 follicular grade 2, and 4 HL. The 
median response duration for the 19 responders was 7.2 months (mean, 15.8 months; range, 1.8-62). Safety findings included ( grade 3, 4) 37% neutropenia, 31% thrombocytopenia, and 11% 
anemia. 
Of the 11 responses observed in the T-cell and Hodgkin lymphoma group, 6 were complete 
(CR). Two responses were observed in 4 subjects with mycosis fungoides and 4 in 8 subjects 
with PTCL, including 3 CRs. Median time to progression and DOR for this group were respectively 2.5 and 11.3 months. Median overall survival was 19.7 months. Eighty one percent of the subjects enrolled in the T-cell and Hodgkin lymphoma group had 4 or more prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_203257] 67% (24/36) a prior stem cell transplant  (Witzig 2011). 
A preliminary  assessment of the first 50 s ubjects enrolled into the current trial was recent ly 
published ( Witzig 2019).  In the initial stages of the study, a retrospective assessment had 
suggested a high- degree of anti -tumor activity of tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884943]- NOS subjects 
whose tumors expressed high levels of CXCL12 and carried  reference CXCL12 3’UTR 
sequences of the CXCL12 gene ( Witzig 2017) .  The median progression- free survival (mPFS) in 
subjects with reference 3’UTR sequences (n = 8) was 134 days, vs. a median PFS of 50 days (n = 7) in subjects whose tumors expressed the rs2839695 A>G variant of the gene, which result ed in 
low levels of CXCL12  expression.  Based on those findings, a cohort of PTCL NOS subjects 
with reference CXCL12 3’UTR and a cohort enrolling AITL  subjects were added to the trial. 
These cohorts investigated  prospectively whether selection for subjects with  high CXCL12 
expressing tumors enriches for the activity of tipi[INVESTIGATOR_7734]. Of 15 subjects enrolled into the PTCL 
expansion cohort, 12 were evaluable for efficacy at the time of the report.  In the per protocol set 
(PPS, or all subjects who received at least [ADDRESS_1238024]- baseline efficacy 
assessment) the objective response rate (ORR) was 41.7% (3 CR, 2 PR) and the clinical benefit 
rate (CBR) was 91.7% (3 CR, 2 PR and 6 SD).  Fo ur subjects of AITL histology were enrolled in 
the cohort.  Of the 3 CRs observed, 2 were experienced by [CONTACT_884991].

Protocol Amendment 7, 12 JULY 2019 
CONFIDENTIAL   In the AITL expansion cohort, 16 patients were enrolled with  11 being evaluable for efficacy.  
The ORR in the PPS was 45.4% and the CBR was 72.7% (3 CR, 2 PR, 3 SD).  If all AITL 
subjects enrolled in the study are considered  (expansion cohort subjects plus the AITL subjects 
in the early phases of the trial, n = 23, 17 evaluable), the ORR was 52.9% and the CBR was 70.6% (5CR, 4PR, 3 SD). 
5.3 Rationale for the Study  
Lymphomas derived from mature ( post-thymic) T- cell clone s with T- cell receptor gene 
rearrangement are referred to as PTCL. Multiple subtypes have been identified . Lymphomas that 
do not fit into a defined category are referred to as PTCL NOS and comprise the largest group with 34% of all subjects with PTCL. PTCL, with the exception of the ALK- positive ALCL , is 
associated with a poor prognosis with a 5 -year overall survival of less than 32%. The majority of 
these subjects experience recurrence of their disease. Pralatrexate, romidepsin and belinostat have been  recently approved in the US and other countries for the treatment o f subjects with 
relapsed  PTCL; however, responses with these agents are generally seen only in less than one 
third of the subjects and overall progression free survival is short lived. Consequently, additional treatment options are still needed  for these subjects.  
Tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884944] a small cohort of subjects with 
PTCL (Witzig 2011). The present study is designed to provide further evidence of safety and efficacy in this patient population. In addition, based on the observed antitumor activity during 
stage 1 and stage 2 of the present study (2 subjects enrolled with AITL and both subjects 
achieved a partial response), an AITL cohort will be enrolled (N = 12) according to Amendment 4 to the protocol in order to further explore the antitumor activity of tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884945].  
In Amendment 6, a cohort (n=12) of subjects with CXCL12+ PTCL was added based on 
preliminary tumor mutational data and outcomes from 16 subjects enrolled in stage 1 and 2 of 
the current study which suggested that subjects with high levels of CXCL12 gene expression 
and/or absence of 3'UTR CXCL12 gene variation derive clinical benefit from tipi[INVESTIGATOR_7734].  In those 16 subjects, a high rate of CXCL12 3’UTR single nucleotide variation (SNV) was observed. 
Seven of 16 pts carried the rs2839695 variant while an additional patient carried a novel variant. 
The presence of 3’UTR SNVs was associated with low levels of CXCL12 gene expression and disease progression while all pts deriving clinical benefit  from tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884946] (wild 
type) 3’UTR CXCL12 and had tumors that expressed high levels of mRNA for this chemokine (Witzig 2017). 
Given the results shown in Section 5.2 above, in the current amendment, additional subjects with 
AITL, nodal PTC L with T -follicular helper phenotype and follicular PTCL will be added to 
further assess the safety and tolerability of tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884914] .

additional subjects with tumors of AITL and related T follicular helper cell histologies in order 
to further characterize the safety and tolerability of tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884949]. 
The selection of  20 subjects was empi[INVESTIGATOR_884950]. 
Descriptive statistics will be used to report response rate.  
Eligible subjects will receive tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598710] a starting dose of 300 mg, orally with food, bid on days 1  - 21 in 28 day cycles. Stepwise 100 mg dose reductions to control treatment-
related, treatment -emergent toxicities are allowed  and further detailed in Section 9.5. Subjects 
who received tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884951] 1 – 7 and days 15 – [ADDRESS_1238041] may transition to receive a dose of 300 mg, orally with 
food, bid on days 1-21 of 28 day treatment cycles beginning on Day 1 of their next cycle. 
Subjects may use proton pump inhibitors or H2 antagonists during the treatment portion of this 
study. However, subjects should be instructed to use antacids (magnesium or aluminum containing products) at least [ADDRESS_1238042]’s enrol lment . Treatment may continue beyond 12 months upon

Tumor assessments will be performed at screening, at the Day 2 2 visit (± 5 days) performed 
during Cycles 2, 4, 6 and once every approximately 12 weeks (cycles 9, 12, 15, etc.) thereafter, 
until disease progression. Tumor assessments will be performed more frequently if deemed 
necessary by [CONTACT_093]. A tumor assessment will be performed upon  treatment 
discontinuation (End of Treatment visit) if the reason for discontinuation is other than disease 
progression and no tumor assessment was performed in the prior [ADDRESS_1238043]’s consent or initiation of another 
anticancer therapy.  Dete rmination  of objective tumor response will be performed by [CONTACT_884994]/or mSWAT criteria.   Subjects who have 
experienced a complete response may be considered for transplantation.  
Efforts will be made to collect information on the subject’s response and duration of response to 
the last prior therapy.  
Upon disease progression , all subjects will be followed approximately every [ADDRESS_1238044] . Information on survival and subsequent anticancer therapy 
may be collected by [CONTACT_648].  
All subjects will be followed -up for safety during treatment and up to approximately 30 days (+/ -

This trial may be discontinued prematurely in the event of any of the following: 
• New information leading to a judgment of unfavorable risk -benefit of tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884953], e.g. due to: Evidence of inefficacy of tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884954] , occurrence of 
significant previously unknown adverse reactions or unexpectedly high intensity or 
incidence of previously known adverse reactions, or other unfavorable safety findings in 
the PTCL patient population. Evidence of inefficacy may arise from this trial or from other trials; unfavorable safety findings may arise fr om clinical or non -clinical 
examinations, e.g. toxicology. 
• Sponsor’s decision that continuation of the trial is unjus tifiable for medical or ethical 
reasons.  
• Poor enrollment of subjects making completion of the trial within an acceptable time frame  unlikely.  
• Discontinuation of development of tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884955].  
• Request by a Health Authority. 
Health Authorities and IRBs/IECs  will be informed about the discontinuation of the trial in 
accordance with applicable regulations. In the case of premature discontinuation of the study, the 
investigations scheduled for the End of Treatment assessment should be performed and the 
appropri ate eCRF section completed.

10 EFFICACY AND SAFETY VARIABLES  
Table 1 summarizes the study required  evaluations. 

Tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598690]-TIP-002           Page 40  
 
 
Protocol Amendment 7, 12 JULY 2019 
CONFIDENTIAL   10.1 Efficacy Variables 
Radiological and/or physical assessments of the tumor lesions  will be made at screening ([ADDRESS_1238069] ug administration ) and at regular intervals as indicated in the 
schedule of activities ( Table 1). Additional tumor assessments may be conducted at the judgment 
of the investigator. The imaging schedule (approximately every [ADDRESS_1238070]’s first 
6 months on study, thereafter every 12 weeks) should be maintained regardless of dosing delays or additional imaging assessments performed. Subjects who discontinue treatment for reasons 
other than disease progression must continue tumor assessments until disease progression, 
withdrawal of their consent to study procedures or initiation of another anticancer therapy.  
Efficacy assessments may also be co nducted at treatment discontinuation (End of Treatment 
visit) if the reason for the treatment termination is other than disease progression and a tumor assessment was not done within 8 weeks before treatment discontinuation ( assessment must be 
conducted before additional anti-tumor the rapy is started) . Scans at the End of Treatment visit 
will be also conducted if required to confirm response to treatment. 
Lesions to be included in the t umor assessments should follow the Lugano Classification criteria  
and/or mSWAT. In subjects with FDG a vid lymphomas, PET -CT is the preferred  scanning 
method for screening and all subsequent tumor assessments (Cycle 2, Cycle 4, Cycle 6, etc.).   In 
subjects with low or variable FDG avid lymphomas, Spi[INVESTIGATOR_884974] (Cycle 2, Cycle 4, Cycle 6, 
etc.).   Subjects with contrast allergy may use non-contrast CT or MRI, whichever is required t o 
adequately assess all disease. The same method of imaging must be used throughout a subject’s 
participation on this study.   
Bone marrow assessment (biopsy or PET assessment) will be performed at screening within 28 
days of Cycle 1 day 1. If baseline bone marrow assessment was positive for  lymphoma, a bone 
marrow biopsy or PET evaluation would be mandatory to confirm a complete response (i.e. after radiographic assessment).  
Objective response (complete response and partial response) as determined by [CONTACT_423]’s best tumor response, duration of response, and time to progress ion will be assessed using the Lugano 
Classification  and/or mSWAT.  
Upon disease progression, all subjects will be followed approximately every [ADDRESS_1238071]’s signature [CONTACT_43998]. Trial site personnel will report any adverse event (AE), whether observed by [CONTACT_19007]. 
The Investigators and Sponsor clinicians or designees will review all relevant safety data by 
[CONTACT_884999] a regular basis  (at least monthly or more frequently if required to monitor 
emerging adverse events) . No external  independent data safety monitoring board is planned for 
this study. Any decisions affecting the conduct of the study will be minute d. Institutional IRBs 
and regulatory authorities will be informed of any major changes that might require a modification of the study protocol. 
10.[ADDRESS_1238072] a causal relatio nship 
with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. In cases of 
surgical or diagnostic procedures, the condition/illness leading to such a procedure is considered as the AE rather than the procedure itself.  In case of a fatality, the cause of death is considered as 
the AE, and the death is cons idered as its outcome. 
The Investigator is required to grade the severity/intensity of each adverse event.  Investigators 
will reference the NCI -CTCAE version 4.03. This is a descriptive terminology that can be used 
for adverse event reporting. A general grading (severity/intensity) scale is provided at the beginning of the referenced document, and specific event grades are also provided. If a particular AE’s severity/intensity is not specifically graded by [CONTACT_43970], the Investigator is to 
revert to the general definitions of Grade [ADDRESS_1238073] medical judgment. 
The 5 general grades are:  
• Grade 1: Mild  
• Grade 2: Moderate  
• Grade 3: Severe ; disabling  
• Grade 4: Life -threatening  
• Grade 5: Death related to AE. Note: Death (Grade 5 as defined by [CONTACT_12134]- CTCAE version 
4.03) is mainly regarded as an outcome, to be documented as described below.  

Tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598690]-TIP-002           Page 42  
 
 
Protocol Amendment 7, 12 JULY 2019 
CONFIDENTIAL   According to the Sponsor’s convention, if a severity/intensity of Grade [ADDRESS_1238074] also report the event as a serious adverse event (SAE; see 
definition below) according to Section 10.5. However, a laboratory abnormality with a severity/intensity of Grade 4, such as anemia or neutropenia, is considered serious only if the condition meets one of the serious criteria described below.  
In the case of death, the primary cause of death (the event leading to death) should be recorded and reported as an SAE. “Fatal” will be recorded as the outcome of this respective event; death  
will not be record ed as separate event. Only if no cause of death can be reported (e.g., sudden 
death, unexplained death), the death per se might be reported as an SAE. 
Investigators must also systematically assess the causal relationship of AEs to the IPs, other 
medicinal products using the following definitions. Decisive factors for the assessment of causal 
relationship of an AE to the trial treatments include, but may not be limited to, temporal relationship between the AE and the trial treatments, known side effects of the trial treatments,  
medical history, concomitant medications and procedures, course of the underlying disease, trial procedures. 
Relatedness of an AE will be evaluated as follows:  
• Not related: Not suspected to be reasonably related to the IPs. AE could not medically  
(pharmacologically/clinically) be attributed to the IP s under trial in this clinical  trial 
protocol. A reasonable alternative explanation must be available. 
• Related: Suspected to be reasonably related to the IP s. AE could medically 
(pharmacologically/clinically) be attributed to the IP s under trial in this clinical  trial 
protocol. 
10.4 Abnormal Laboratory Findings and Other Abnormal 
Investigational Findings  
Abnormal laboratory findings and other abnormal investigational findings (e.g. on an ECG trace)  
should not be reported as AEs unless they are associated with clinical signs and symptoms, lead  
to treatment discontinuation or are considered otherwise medically important by [CONTACT_737].  
If an abnormality fulfills these criteria, the identified medical condition (e.g. anemia, increased 
ALT) must be reported as the AE rather than the abnormal value itself. 
10.[ADDRESS_1238075] medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death.  
• Is life -threatening. NOTE: The term “lif e-threatening” in this definition refers to an event 
in which the subject is at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might cause death if it were more severe.  

Tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598690]-TIP-002           Page 43  
 
 
Protocol Amendment 7, 12 JULY 2019 
CONFIDENTIAL   • Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. 
• Results in  persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Is otherwise considered as medically important.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening , or require  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_107922], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm  
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
For the purposes of reporting, any suspected transmission of an infectious agent via an IP  is also 
considered a serious adverse reaction and all such cases should be reported in an expedited  
manner. 
10.6 Events that Do Not Meet the Definition of an SAE  
Elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43930], or to simplify trial treatment or trial procedures (e.g. an  
overnight stay to facilitate chemotherapy and related hydration therapy application) are not considered as SAEs. However, all events leading to unplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43931] (e.g., undesirable effects of any administered treatment) must be documented and reported as SAEs. 
10.7 Events Not to Be Considered as AEs/SAEs  
Medical conditions are present at the initial trial visit that do not w orsen in severity or frequency 
during the trial are defined as Baseline Medical Conditions, and are NOT to be considered AEs.  
Progression of underlying disease is not an AE and therefore not an SAE per se, rather an 
efficacy end -point, unless deemed to be causally related to administration of IP s. However, if 
adverse signs or symptoms occur in association with disease progression then these should be 
recorded as AEs and reported as SAEs if meeting any seriousness criteria.  
10.[ADDRESS_1238076] will be queried on changes in his/her condition. During the reporting period of the trial any unfavorable changes in the subject’s condition will be recorded as AEs, whether reported by [CONTACT_280635]. 
Complete, accurate and consistent data on all AEs experienced for the duration of the reporting 
period (defined below) will be reported on an ongoing basis in the appropriate section of the 
eCRF. Among these AEs, all serious AEs must be additionally documented and reported using

event, its duration (onset and resolution dates (/times “/times” to be completed when it is 
important to assess the time of AE  onset relative to the recorded treatment administration time)), 
its severity, its relationship with  the trial treatment, any other potential causal factors, any 
treatment given or other action taken  (including dose modification or discontinuation of the IP s) 
and its outcome. In addition, serious cases should be identified and the appropriate seriousness criteria documented.  Specific guidance can be found in the eCRF completion and monitoring 
conventions provided by [CONTACT_1034].  
10.[ADDRESS_1238077] is included  
into the trial (date of first signature [CONTACT_43998]) and continues through the trial’s post-treatment follow -up period, defined as [ADDRESS_1238078] 
immediately (i.e. within a maximum 24 HOURS after becoming aware of the event) inform the 
person (s) identified in the Serio us Adverse Event Report Form by [CONTACT_756], by [CONTACT_152478] e mail.  
When  an event (or follow-up information) is reported by [CONTACT_756], a written report must be sent 
immediately thereafter by [CONTACT_3719] e -mail.  Reporting procedures and timelines are the same for any 
new information on a previously reported SAE. For names, addresses, telephone and fax numbers for SAE reporting, see information included in the Adverse Event Report Form. All 
written reports should be transmitte d using the Adverse Event Report Form, which must be 
completed by [CONTACT_885000]. 
The AE section of the eCRF must be completed and a copy of the information transmitted with the Adverse Event Report Form. Other relevant pages from the eCRF  may also be provided (e.g., 
medical history, concomitant drugs). The Investigator/Reporter must respond to any request for 
follow-up information (e.g. additional information, outcome and final evaluation, specific 
records where needed) or to any question the Sponsor may have on the AE within the same 
timelines as described for initial reports. This is  necessary to permit a prompt assessment of the 
event by [CONTACT_885001].

CONFIDENTIAL   requirements related to the  reporting of SAEs (and in particular deaths) involving his/her 
subjects to the IRB/IEC that approved the trial. 
In acco rdance with ICH GCP guidelines , the Sponsor will inform the Investigator of “findings 
that could adversely affect the safety of subjects, impact the conduct of the trial or alter the 
IRB/IEC’s approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_150831].” In particular and in line with 
respective regulations, the Sponsor will inform the Investigator of AEs that are both serious and unexpected and are considered to be relate d to the administered product (“suspected unexpected 
serious adverse reactions”, S[LOCATION_003]Rs). The Investigator should place copi[INVESTIGATOR_884975] e. National regulations with regard s to s afety  reporting notifications to 
Investigators will be taken into account.  When specifically required by [CONTACT_885002], the Sponsor will provide appropriate safety reports directly to the concerned lead IRB/IEC and will maintain records of these  notification s. When direct reporting by [CONTACT_885003], the Investigator will be responsible 
for promptly notifying the concerned 
IRB/IEC of any Safety reports provided by [CONTACT_152483][INVESTIGATOR_884976].  
10.[ADDRESS_1238080] is documented as “lost to follow- up”. Reasonable attempts 
to obtain this information must be made and documented. It is also the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that  any necessary additional therapeutic measures and follow -up 
procedures are performed. The Sponsor will actively follow -up and collect information on any 
AE that occurs during the course of a clinical trial, however while this activity will continue for any serious AEs until stabilization or until the outcome is known, it will be discontinued at the  
time of database lock for non- serious AEs.  
10.13  Pregnancy and In Utero Drug Exposure 
Only pregnancies considered by [CONTACT_152484] (e.g., resulting from a drug interaction with a contraceptive medication) are considered as adverse events. However,  
all pregnancies with an estimated conception date during the study safety period must be 
recorded by [CONTACT_43978]/section of the e- CRF. The same rule applies to  
pregnancies in female subjects and in female partners of male subjects. The Investigator must  
notify the Sponsor in an expedited manner of any pregnancy using the Pregnancy Report Form, 
which must be transmitted  according to the same process as described for SAE reporting. 
Investigators must actively follow up, document and report on the outcome of all these pregnancies, even if the subjects are withdrawn from the trial.  The Investigator must notify the

11.6 End of Treatment Visit  
The following assessments will  occur approximately 30 days (± 7 days) after the last 
administration of study drug or immediately before the administration of a nother anti -cancer 
drug, whichever takes place first: 
Complete physical examination. Record subject weight and temperature. Record weight, 
temperature and other physical examination parameters as AE if they meet AE criteria.  
• ECOG performance  status.  
• 12-lead ECG  
• Hematology 
• Coagulation 
• Chemistry (fasting  not required ) 
• Pregnancy test  (serum or urine) for females of child -bearing potential only 
• Circulating biomarkers samples (one plasma, one serum) 
• Tumor a ssessments for subjects who have not previously demonstrated disease 
progression in the study unless completed within the previous 8 weeks. 
• Assessments of adverse event and concomitant medications.

12 STATISTICAL METHODS  
This section outlines the statis tical analysis strategy and procedures for the study. Specific details 
of the primary and key secondary analyses will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). If, after the study has begun, but prior to the final analysis, important changes are made to 
the protocol that affect principal features of the primary or key secondary analyses, then the 
protocol and/or SAP will be amended, as appropriate. Any other changes made to the planned analyses after the protocol and SAP have been finalized, along with an  explanation as to when 
and why they occurred, will be listed in the Clinical Study Report (CSR) for the study. Post hoc exploratory analyses will be clearly identified in the CSR. 
12.1 Populations 
12.1.1  Efficacy Analysis  
The FAS population will serve as the prim ary population for the analysis of tumor response and 
other efficacy -related data. Subjects will be excluded for FAS for the following reasons: 
• No baseline data  
• Failure to receive at least one dose of tipi[INVESTIGATOR_7734]  
• No post- baseline endpoint data subse quent to at least 1 dose of study drug

Protocol Amendment 7, 12 JULY 2019 
CONFIDENTIAL   12.1.2  Safety Analysis  
The All Subjects as Treated (ASaT) population will be used for the analysis of safety data.  The 
ASaT population consists of all enrolled subjects who receive at least one dose of tipi[INVESTIGATOR_7734] . At 
least one laboratory or vital sign measurement obtained subsequent to at least one dose of study 
drug is required for inclusion in the analysis of a speci fic safety parameter. To assess change 
from baseline, a baseline measurement is also required.  
12.2 Endpoints 
12.2.1  Efficacy  
The objective response rate will be estimated for each tumor histology type evaluated.  The estimate of the objective response rate will be calcu lated based on the maximum likelihood 
estimator (i.e., crude proportion of subje cts whose best overall response is CR or PR). The 
estimate of the objective response rate will be accompanied by 2-sided 95% exact binomial 
confidence intervals. 
The duration of objective response will be calculated for subjects who achieve CR or PR.  For 
such subjects, the duration of objective response is defined as the number of days from the start 
date of PR or CR (whichever response is achieve d first) to the first date that progressive disease 
is objectively documented. Disease pr ogression will be determined by [CONTACT_885004]/or mSWAT. The duration of objective response will be right- censored 
for subjects who achieve CR or PR and meet 1 of the following conditions: 1) non-protocol 
anticancer treatment started before documentation of disease progression, 2) death or documented disease progression after more than 1 missed disease assessment visit, or 3) alive and does not have documentation of disease progression before a data analysis cutoff date.  
The duration of obje ctive response will be summarized descr iptively using the Kaplan- Meier 
method. The 50th percentile of the Kaplan- Meier distribution will be used to estimate the median 
response duration. Progression free survival will be defined as the time (in months) from enrollment to either first 
observation of progressive disease or occurrence of death due to any cause within 126 days 
(approximately 2 time intervals for tumor assessments) of either first administration of tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884981]. In sub jects without a progression date or with a death date  more 
than [ADDRESS_1238096] administration  of 
study tipi[INVESTIGATOR_7734] . Progression free survival analyses should consider tumor assessments after  
treatment discontinuation or metastatic surgery.  
The PFS will be summarized descr iptively using the Kaplan- Meier method. The 50th percentile 
of the Kaplan- Meier distribution will be used to estimate the median PFS.

Protocol Amendment 7, 12 JULY 2019 
CONFIDENTIAL   12.2.2  Safety and Tolerability  
Safety and tolerability of tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884982]: 
• Incidence, duration, and severity of treatment- emergent adverse events, serious adverse 
events, adverse events resulting in permanent discontinuation of study drug, and deaths 
within approximately [ADDRESS_1238097] dose of study drug (or immediately before the administration of another anti- cancer treatment)  
• Changes in vital signs including blood pressure, pulse, and temperature 
• Changes in electrocardiogram results 
Adverse events will be coded using the latest available versio n of the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Treatment -emergent adverse events are def ined as adverse 
events that start on or after the first dose of study drug and within approximately [ADDRESS_1238098] exposure (e.g., total 
number of treatment cycles administered). AEs will also be summ arized by [CONTACT_12134]-CTCAE version 
4.[ADDRESS_1238099] listings. 
The incidence of grade 3 and 4 hematological toxicities (including neutropenia, 
thrombocytopenia, and anemia) will be provided by [CONTACT_885005]. The toxicity grades for laboratory tests will be based on NCI- CTCAE version 4.03 
criteria. The use of blood transfusions (platelets, red blood cells) and/or gr owth factor support 
will be reported. Similar analyses will be do ne for selected chemistry tests (including liver and 
renal function tests).  
Vital sign results (blood pressure, pulse, and temperature) will be summarized descriptively for each scheduled and  unscheduled protocol time point. Changes will be calculated relative to the 
assessments at baseline and on the first day of each cycle of therapy.  

Tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598690]-TIP-[ADDRESS_1238100] subjects are evaluated in a Full Analysis Set (FAS) 
basis.  
A two -stage desi gn will be employed. Eleven initial study subject s will be enrolled; if 2-[ADDRESS_1238101] if the true ORR is higher than 10%.  To determine 
the total trial size  of the initial cohort of subjects, a response of interest of 30% is assumed. This 
design provides 80% power to detect a difference between 10% and 30% ORR at one-sided 
significance level of 0.087. Using this design, the probability of terminating the study at the end 
of stage 1 if the true ORR is 10% is 0.697 while the probability of t erminating the study at the 
end of stage 1 if the true ORR is 30% is 0.113.  
An AITL
 cohort will be enrolled (N = 12) according to  Amendment [ADDRESS_1238102] 30% is 82.6 % (Table 6 ).  
Based on the observed antitumor activity during stage [ADDRESS_1238103] high levels of CXCL12 gene expression and reference CXCL12 
3’UTR by [CONTACT_885006]12 expression and CXCL12 3’UTR variant seque nces, a CXCL12+ 
cohort will be enrolled (N = 12) according to Amendment 6 to the protocol.  With this sample size, if 2 or more responses are observed, the probability that the true response rate in CXCL12+ subjects is 10% or higher is at least 87% ( Table 7 ).  
It is assumed that the presence of CXCL12 3’UTR gene variants is of germinal, not somatic, origin. By [CONTACT_15094], CXCL12+ subjects are defined as those who present w ith reference CXCL12 
reference gene sequence in a buccal swab assay and in whom no CXCL12 3’UTR variant or

enrolled in the CXCL12+ cohort based on CXCL12+ status in the buccal swab test and later 
demonstrated to have a somatic tumor 3’UTR CXCL12 sequence variant will be allowed to continue treatment but may be replaced and not included in the evaluable study population for efficacy analyses.  
Upon the observation of 5 confirmed responses in the AITL cohort, and 5 confirmed responses in 
the CXCL12+  cohort, including 2 of them in subjects with tumors of AITL histology, the trial 
was amended to include up to 20 additional subjects with AITL and related T follicular helper cell tumors in the AITL cohort in order to further characterize the safety and tolerability of tipi[INVESTIGATOR_884914].  The choice of 20 additional subjects was empi[INVESTIGATOR_884983].  Including Amendment 7, up to 70 evaluable subjects in total may be enrolled (dosed).   
12.[ADDRESS_1238104]’s safety is compromised without 
immediate action. In these circumstances, immediate approval of the chairman of the IRB/I EC 
must be sought, and the Investigator should inform the Sponsor and the full IRB/I EC within 2 
working days after the emergency has occurred.  
The IRBI /EC must review and approve all protocol amendments. Protocol ame ndments that have 
an impact on subject risk or the study objectives, or require revision of the ICF, must receive 
approval from the IRB/I EC prior to their implementation.  
When a protocol amendment substantially alters the study d esign or the potential risk s or burden

the trial is performed in accordance with the clinical trial protocol and with the ethical principles  
that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, as well as with the ICH Note for Guidance 
on Good Clinical Practice (ICH Topic E6, 1996) and applicable regulatory requirements. In 
particular, the Investigator must ensure that only subjects who have given their informed consent are included into the trial.  

Tipi[INVESTIGATOR_598690]-TIP-[ADDRESS_1238106]’s participation in the trial is his/her written informed  
consent. The subject’s written informed consent to participate in the trial must be given before 
any trial- related activit ies are carried out.  
Adequate information must therefore be given to the subject by [CONTACT_885007] (a person designated by [CONTACT_152497], if permitted by [CONTACT_427]).  
With the cooperation of the Sponsor, and in accordance with the Note for Guidance on Good Clinical Practice (ICH Topic E6, 1996), and the ethical principles that have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki, the Investigator will prepare the informed consent form and other 
written information to be used in obtaining informed consent from the trial subjects. The 
investigator should cooperate with the sponsor for preparation of aforementioned written information. 
Before the consent may be obtained, the potential subject (or the potential subject’ legally  
acceptable representative) should be provided with sufficient time and opportunity to be accessed 
to the details of clinical trial and to decide if they would participate in the trial. All the queries  
related to the tria l from the potential subject or legally acceptable representative should be 
answ ered by [CONTACT_885008]. 
In addition to providing this written information to a potential subject, the Investigator or his/her 
designate will inform the subject verbally of all pertinent aspects of the trial. The language used 
in doing so must be chosen so that the information can be fully and readily understood by [CONTACT_391510]. 
Depending on local  regulations, a person other than the Investigator may inform the subject  and 
sign the Informed Consent Form. Where the information is provided by [CONTACT_737], the 
Informed Consent Form must be signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_43987]. 
The signed and dated declaration of informed consent will remain at the Investigator’s site, and  
must be safely archived by [CONTACT_152498], auditing and inspection purposes. A copy of the signed and dated information and Informed Consent Form should be provided to the subject prior to participation. 
Whenever important new information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject’s 
consent, the written subject information sheet and any other written information provided to 
subjects will be revi sed by [CONTACT_885009]/IEC for review and 
favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. The agreed, revised information will be provided to each subject in the trial 
for signing and dating. The Investigator will explain the changes to the previous version.

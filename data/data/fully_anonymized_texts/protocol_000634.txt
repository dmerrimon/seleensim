SECTION V: RESEARCH P LAN
1.Statement  of Purpose: State the scientific aim(s) of the study, or the hypotheses to be tested. 
To investigate whether the daily glucose profiles as assessed by [CONTACT_455222] 1 week of normal weight, obese, and diabetic individuals relate to hunger levels and food 
intake.
2.Background:  Describe the background information that led to the plan for this project. 
Provide references to support the expectation of obtaining useful scientific data.
The rising incidence  of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and obesity has paralleled the increased 
consumption of sugar, which has been associated with numerous adverse metabolic effects 
including weight gain, insulin resistance, cognitive decline, and stroke 1-3.
Human studies using  nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), a powerful, non-invasive 
tool to determine the concentration of metabolites in living tissue, have shown that glucose 
transport across the BBB is not rate limiting during hyperglycemia 4,5. Furthermore, in previous

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 10/24/2018 VALID THROUGH 11/17/2019Page [ADDRESS_581976] also shown 
using microdialysis probes and hyperglycemic clamp in human subjects undergoing 
electrophysiological evaluation for epi[INVESTIGATOR_455216]-epi[INVESTIGATOR_455217] a 200% rise in glucose levels from baseline during a hyperglycemic clamp 7. 
Glucose has  traditionally been considered a satiety signal in the brain. More than [ADDRESS_581977] to stimulate 
hunger and subsequent food consumption 8-12. While our knowledge of the signals from the 
periphery to the brain that regulate eating behavior has expanded exponentially, much remains 
unknown about the mechanisms by [CONTACT_455223]. 
Furthermore, previous  published data from our lab13, subjects using a 2-step clamp, i.e. 
euglycemia (~90 mg/dL) followed by [CONTACT_455224] (~65 mg/dL) in conjunction with fMRI 
and visual stimuli of food/non-food, showed that euglycemia was associated with activation of 
prefrontal cortex (PFC) and anterior cingulate (p<0.05), while during hypoglycemia there was 
activation of hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, insula, caudate and putamen in response to 
visual food cues (p<0.05). In addition, hunger was increased during hypoglycemia as compared 
to the euglycemic phase (5.7 ± 0.5 vs 4.5 ± 0.5; p<0.01). The study also included a small group 
of obese subjects (n=5). When this group was compared to lean subjects, they failed to show 
activation of the medial pre-frontal cortex during euglycemia and showed greater bilateral 
activation of the hypothalamus, striatum and insula in response to high-calorie food images 
during mild hypoglycemia (p <0.05). Taken together the data suggest that during euglycemic 
phase of the clamp study there was activation of PFC in lean individuals, a region involved in 
complex cognitive behaviors, decision making and moderating correct social behavior14, whereas 
during hypoglycemic phase limbic regions were activated; which are involved in physiological 
and emotional responses15. Of particular interest these preliminary data suggest that the neural 
response to food consumption and food cues is altered in obese individuals in a way that could 
contribute to overeating behavior, namely increased stimulation of reward centers in response to 
nutrients (glucose) and/or food cues. This differentiated brain response could be a contributing 
factor to the pathogenesis of human obesity. We also plan to study patients with diabetes, who 
have chronic high glucose levels.  Preliminary work from our group showed that obese unlike 
lean subjects suppressed activity in the ventral medial PFC (executive-control area) in response 
to food images; with a preferential liking/wanting for high-calorie food during hyperglycemia16.  
Therefore, we want to investigate if changes in circulating glucose levels can interfere with 
eating behavior and food intake in lean, obese subjects and patients with diabetes. 
Continuous glucose  monitoring (CGM) is used in people with diabetes for better glycemic 
control as well as in non-diabetic individuals to characterize glucose patterns 17-19. No study thus 
far has looked into glucose profiles normal weight, obese, and diabetic individuals in a normal, 
outpatient setting in relation to hunger and food intake. In a preliminary study of 8 individuals 
who wore a CGMS for 1 week and recorded their food intake and hunger levels, we found that 
increasing subjective hunger levels are more related to pre-prandial glucose peaks as opposed to 
nadirs. Furthermore, declines in glucose are correlated with caloric intake as well as the

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 10/24/2018 VALID THROUGH 11/17/2019Page [ADDRESS_581978] that glycemic excursions 
following a meal may play a role in hunger and food choices for the subsequent meal.
3.Research Plan: Summarize the study design and research procedures using non-technical 
language that can be readily understood by [CONTACT_20894]. Be sure to 
distinguish between standard of care vs. research procedures when applicable, and include 
any flowcharts of visits specifying their individual times and lengths. Describe the setting in 
which the research will take place.
Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (CGMS): To evaluate the effect of blood glucose levels 
on eating behavior in a population of patients with diabetes in a free-living environment; we plan 
to study 15 lean healthy control subjects (BMI <25 kg/m2), 15 obese non-diabetic subjects (BMI 
> 30 kg/m2), 15 T2DM subjects who will be age and BMI-matched to obese, non-diabetic 
subjects, and 15 T1DM subjects who will be age and BMI matched to control, non-diabetic 
subjects. The participants will come to the research unit for a screening visit to review their 
medical history and receive a physical examination. Blood tests will be collected for exclusion of 
anemia (hematocrit), diabetes (A1c), untreated thyroid disease (TSH), or any other major health 
problems (liver enzymes and creatinine). The total amount of blood drawn will be less [ADDRESS_581979] been done within the 3 months prior to 
the screening visit. The participants who qualify will be invited to use the CGMS (DEXCOM G4 
Platinum) for up to 7 days. On the visit for placement of the CGMS: 1) the participants will be 
explained by [CONTACT_455225] a glucometer (FreeStyle or Accu-Check), 2) 
they will have the CGMS inserted under the skin, and 3) they will be instructed how to fill up the 
food log (using informational brochures). On the second visit (up to 7 days after the initial visit)  
the CGMS will be removed from the skin and the glucose meter and food log will be returned to 
the investigators. The first visit will last approximately 1 hour and the second visit about 30 
minutes. The CGMS consists of 3 parts: sensor, transmitter and monitor. The small sensor 
measures the glucose levels from the interstitial tissue. The transmitter is attached on top of the 
sensor and connects wirelessly to the monitor. The sensor is sterile and comes in an unopened 
package. It has a plastic wire-like tip that is placed under the skin and continuously measures the 
glucose levels. One of the study physicians will insert the CGMS wire-like tip under the 
volunteer’s skin with the use of the DEXCOM sensor insertion kit. The transmitter is snapped to 
the sensor pod and the sensor/transmitter unit will be attached to the skin with an adhesive patch. 
The monitor is the size of a small hand-held device with a digital screen that displays a graph 
showing the glucose levels from the previous 4-[ADDRESS_581980] will ask about amount and type of food 
consumed throughout the day. The participants will also register how hungry they are before the 
meal and how full they feel after they ate, and type and duration of physical activity After 
completing the CGMS session, the sensor will be removed by [CONTACT_54858]. To 
remove the sensor, the adhesive patch will be gently peeled off from the skin, together with the 
sensor pod and transmitter. Removal of the sensor is a painless procedure. The sensor and sensor

The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_22413], assuring protocol 
compliance, and conducting the safety reviews at the specified frequency, which must be 
conducted at a minimum of every 6 months (including when reapproval of the protocol is 
sought).  During the review process, the principal investigator (monitor) will evaluate whether 
the study should continue unchanged, require modification/amendment, or close to enrollment. 
Either the principal investigator, the IRB or [enter the names of other oversight bodies that have 
this authority, e.g., Yale Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC)] have 
the authority to stop or suspend the study or require modifications.
2. The risks associated with the current study are deemed greater than minimal for the 
following reasons: (choose those that apply)
1. We  do not view the risks associated with the CGM and Glucose monitoring __________ 
as minimal risks.
Although we have  assessed the proposed study as one of greater than minimal risk, the potential 
exists for anticipated and/or unanticipated adverse events, serious or otherwise, to occur since it 
is not possible to predict with certainty the absolute risk in any given individual or in advance of 
first-hand experience with the proposed study methods. Therefore, we provide a plan for 
monitoring the data and safety of the proposed study as follows:
3. Attribution of Adverse Events:
Adverse events will be monitored for each subject participating in the study and attributed to the 
study procedures / design by [CONTACT_458] (Insert Investigator Name) according to 
the following categories:
a.) Definite: Adverse event is clearly related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
b.) Probable: Adverse event is likely related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).

APPROVED BY [CONTACT_20891] 10/24/2018 VALID THROUGH 11/17/2019Page 13 of 29c.) Possible: Adverse event may be related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
d.) Unlikely: Adverse  event is likely not to be related to the investigational 
procedures(s)/agent(s).
e.) Unrelated: Adverse event is clearly not related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
4. Plan for Grading Adverse Events:
The following scale will be used in grading the severity of adverse events noted during the study:
1. Mild adverse event
2. Moderate  adverse event
3. Severe  
5. Plan for Determining Seriousness of Adverse Events:
Serious Adverse Events:
In addition to grading the adverse event, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_96081] a Serious Adverse Event (SAE).  An adverse event is considered serious if it 
results in any of the following outcomes:
1. Death;
2. A  life-threatening experience in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929]; 
3. A  persistent or significant disability or incapacity; 
4. A  congenital anomaly or birth defect; OR
5. Any  other adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize 
the subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the other outcomes listed in this definition. 
An adverse event may be graded as severe but still not meet the criteria for a Serious Adverse 
Event.  Similarly, an adverse event may be graded as moderate but still meet the criteria for an 
SAE.  It is important for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_22415] “seriousness” 
when determining whether reporting to the IRB is necessary.
6. Plan for reporting UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865] (including Adverse Events) to the IRB
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_22416]: 
Any incident, experience or outcome that meets ALL 3 of the following criteria:
1. Is  unexpected (in terms of nature, specificity, severity, or frequency) given (a) the 
research procedures described in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-
approved protocol and informed consent document and (b) the characteristics of the 
subject population being studied; AND 
2. Is  related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means 
there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have 
been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); AND

physical, psychological, economic, legal, or social harm) than was previously known 
or recognized.
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]) may be medical or 
non-medical in nature, and include – but are not limited to – serious, unexpected, and related 
adverse events and unanticipated adverse device effects.  Please note  that adverse events are 
reportable to the IRB as UPI[INVESTIGATOR_22417] 3 criteria listed above.
These UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]/SAEs will be reported to the IRB in accordance with IRB Policy 710, using the 
appropriate forms found on the website. All related events involving risk but not meeting the 
prompt reporting requirements described in IRB Policy [ADDRESS_581983] to oversight by a DSMB (or other monitoring 
entity that is monitoring the study on behalf of an industry sponsor).
7. Plan for reporting adverse events to co-investigators on the study, as appropriate the 
protocol’s research monitor(s), e.g., industrial sponsor, Yale Cancer Center Data and 
Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), Protocol Review Committee (PRC), DSMBs, study 
sponsors, funding and regulatory agencies, and regulatory and decision-making bodies.
For the current study, the following individuals, funding, and/or regulatory agencies will be 
notified (choose those that apply):

Authorization
 for either the entire study, or for recruitment purposes only.  Note: if you are collecting 
PHI as part of a phone or email screen, you must request a HIPAA waiver for recruitment purposes.)
Choose one: For entire study: ______ For recruitment purposes only: __X____
i. Describe  why it would be impracticable to obtain the subject’s authorization for 
use/disclosure of this data;
We will need the volunteers’ full name, address, date of birth, and phone numbers to 
schedule a screening visit at the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_96051]. We also would like to be 
able to review clinic appointments to see if any of the scheduled patients meet the 
inclusion criteria prior to calling them on the phone. This would include reviewing 
their diagnosis for DM, their age to be between 18-65 years, and their Body Mass 
Index (BMI). By [CONTACT_455236], we will be able to avoid 
contact[CONTACT_455237].
ii. If  requesting a waiver of signed authorization, describe why it would be 
impracticable to obtain the subject’s signed authorization for use/disclosure of this 
data;
By [CONTACT_25253], the investigator assures that the protected 
health information for which a Waiver of Authorization has been requested will not 
be reused or disclosed to any person or entity other than those listed in this 
application, except as required by [CONTACT_2371], for authorized oversight of this research 
study, or as specifically approved for use in another study by [CONTACT_2717].
Researchers are reminded that unauthorized disclosures of PHI to individuals outside of the Yale 
HIPAA-Covered entity must be accounted for in the “accounting for disclosures log”, by [CONTACT_55470], purpose, date, recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], and a description of information provided.  Logs are to be 
forwarded to the Deputy HIPAA Privacy Officer.

8. Process  of Consent/Assent: Describe the setting and conditions under which consent/assent will 
be obtained, including parental permission or surrogate permission and the steps taken to ensure 
subjects’ independent decision-making. 
The study  will be described to the subject in detail, including the purpose and potential risks 
associated with the study. This will be explained by [CONTACT_099], including the intervention and 
process for the study day. The subject will be required to read and sign the consent form 
approved by [CONTACT_20907], and the patient will retain a copy of this consent to review. Additionally, 
the patient will have sufficient time to ask questions during the screening and will be encouraged 
to contact [CONTACT_455238]. All subjects who will be asked to 
volunteer are informed that no immediate personal medical benefits will be derived from 
participation. Any subject who appears incapable of providing informed consent (e.g., due to 
apparent cognitive impairment) will be excluded. Subjects will be informed that they can decline 
to participate in the study without penalty, and given the opportunity to withdraw from the study 
prior to analysis of their data. All subjects will be given a copy of the consent form enclosed with 
this protocol outlining the risks and benefits of participation in this study. Following the 
resolution of any questions, the subjects will be asked to sign the consent form, if he/she agrees 
to participate.
9.E valuation of Subject(s) Capacity to Provide Informed Consent/Assent: Indicate how the 
personnel obtaining consent will assess the potential subject’s ability and capacity to consent to the 
research being proposed. 
We do not plan to recruit subjects with limited decision-making capacity. Potential subjects will 
undergo a face-to-face interview.  At that time, a study physician will meet the subject, review 
the informed consent form, explain the purpose of the study and risks associated with 
participation, and will be available for questions. To ensure that the study subject understands the 
study, the subject will be asked questions about the study procedures and the risks associated 
with participation. If any concern arises that the study subject did not fully understand the study, 
the study physician may decide that the subject is not suitable for participation.  If the subject is 
still interested after all questions have been answered, a study physician will ask the subject to 
sign the informed consent form.
10. Documentation  of Consent/Assent: Specify the documents that will be used during the 
consent/assent process. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_25156], in the same 
format that they will be given to subjects.

Address
Phone  number
Age
Medical  record number
Race
Past medical, and surgical history, allergies, medications taken.
Family  and social history
Body mass index, vital signs
Labs,  including A1c, ALT/AST, creatinine, TSH, pregnancy test, and CGMS results
b. How  will the research data be collected, recorded and stored? 
Research data  will be collected directly from the subject as well as via the electronic medical 
record. Subjects will be assigned a study number. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_261601] a 
computer worksheet where the name [CONTACT_81835]’s medical information is linked to the 
coded information.  This will be housed on a password protected computer on a secured 
network. Only the investigators will have access to the computer records, which include the 
subject's identity, in order to evaluate the information generated by [CONTACT_1758].  No further

the identifiable  study data and the storage media indicated above during and after the 
subject’s participation in the study?
Do all portable devices contain encryption software?  Yes    No
         If no, see http://hipaa.yale.edu/guidance/policy.html
All identifiable  subject information that is collected during recruitment, screening, and 
participation will appear only on the initial paper forms, which will be kept under lock and 
key in the academic office of one of the study investigators. All digital files that could link a 
code number to an individual study subject will be password protected and stored on CD, 
which will be kept locked in the PI’s office.
e. What  will be done with the data when the research is completed? Are there plans to destroy     
the identifiable data? If yes, describe how, by [CONTACT_22467]. 
If no, describe how the data and/or identifiers will be secured.
Procedures to ensure  confidentiality follow the regulations and policies of the Yale 
University School of Medicine. The security mechanisms specified above in section d will 
continue to be in place to protect study data.
f.   Who will have access to the protected health information (such as the research sponsor, the  
investigator, the research staff, all research monitors, FDA, Yale Cancer Center Data and Safety 
Monitoring Committee (DSMC), SSC, etc.)? (please distinguish between PHI and de-identified 
data) 
The NIDDK will be the only external agency that will have access to de-identified study data. 
Only the investigators will have access to PHI and de-identified data. The Yale University HIC 
will have access to study files.
g.   If appropriate, has a Certificate of Confidentiality been obtained? N/A
h.   Are  any of the study procedures likely to yield information subject to mandatory reporting   
requirements? (e.g. HIV testing – reporting of communicable diseases; parent interview -

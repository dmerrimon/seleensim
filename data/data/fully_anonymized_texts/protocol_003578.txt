UCHN -12-001 Page 8 of 38 03APR2018  1.1 Locally Advanced Cutaneous Cancer  
Cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas are very common malignant neoplasms in the 
[LOCATION_002], frequently associated with sun expo sure and fair complexions.  Other risk 
factors include advanced age and acquired immunosuppression after solid organ 
transplantation or treatment for leukemia/lymphoma.   
 
Squamous cell carcinomas of the skin are considered aggressive non -melanoma skin 
cancers.  Cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (CSCCHN) occur 
commonly, and this is reflected in the AJCC seventh edition 2010 staging, which created 
new staging for non -melanoma skin cancer staging that correlates with the head and neck 
mucosal staging1.   
 
Within CSCCHN, poor prognosis has been associated with involvement of the parotid 
gland, advancing cervical nodal me tastases, immunosuppression , and bony involvement .  
Overall survival at 2 years i n retrospective studies2-3, was 70 -80% f or N1 parotid and/or 
neck involvement, whereas it was 25 -50% for N 2-[ADDRESS_1261246] a 7.2 fold increased risk of local recurrence and a 5.3 
fold increased risk of any recurrence after treatment for CSCC HN.  Mortality is also 
increased with skin cancer; skin cancer was the fourth most common cause of death in a 
reported renal transplant cohort 4.  Additionally, single institution series have reported that 
histopathology of CSCC in immunocompromised patien ts is more aggressive, with tumor 
size being less important  5.  The [ADDRESS_1261247] -operative radiotherapy, approximately 25% patients 
will experience loco -regional failure, 25% will develop distant metastases and the 2 year 
overall survival is several large series is repo rted to be 40 -55%[ADDRESS_1261248] -operative 
radiotherapy alone has been 68%  (unpublished) .  
 
While these numbers could certainly be  improved upon, there have been  no pros pective 
trials to date looking at the  addition of chemotherapy or targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_899443].

1.3 Epi[INVESTIGATOR_14907] (EG FR) 
 
In mucosal SCCHN, a recent important area of advance has been the study of epi[INVESTIGATOR_33927] (EGFR).  EGFR is expressed at very high levels in the majority of 
human mucosal head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCCHN). Furthermore, pre -
Complion Document ID: 459969
UCHN -12-001 Page 9 of 38 03APR2018  clinical data indicate that it is not merely a ‘by[CONTACT_112815]’ but is intimately associated with the 
malignant phenotype of SCCHN. EGFR activation in response to a ligand (e.g., EGF or 
TGF-alpha) results in phosphorylation of its intracytoplasmic tyrosine kin ase domain, 
leading to a cascade of signal transduction within the cell. This ultimately leads to DNA 
synthesis, cell proliferation, anti -apoptosis, and transcription of growth factors such as pro -
angiogenic molecules. Blockade of this pathway is an effect ive anti -neoplastic strategy; 
furthermore, EGFR blockade appears to result in radiosensitization. This hypothesis was 
proven in a randomized trial by [CONTACT_899455], et al. (2006)9. In that study, patients with locally 
advanced, non -operative mucosal SCCHN were ra ndomized to RT alone or RT with 
weekly cetuximab.  Local -regional control and survival were significantly improved with 
cetuximab. 2 -year locoregional control was increased significantly with cetuximab by 9% 
(from 41 to 50%), and this translated into an ov erall survival advantage at 5 years.  5 -year 
overall survival was 45% for RT/cetuximab, compared with 36% for RT alone. Interestingly, 
the development of > grade [ADDRESS_1261250] little toxicity when given  concurrently with 
radiotherapy for mucosal SCCHN and 93% of patients received the prescribed cetuximab 
dose [Bonner 2006]. Furthermore, the Bonner study showed no evidence that cetuximab 
increased the rate of ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_1261251]-operative setting for mucosal intermediate risk SCCHN in RTOG 0920.  In platinum -
refractory recurrent/metastatic mucosal SCCHN, single agent cetuximab has a response 
rate of app roximately 11%10,  providing further clinical evidence th at it is working via a 
pathway (or pathways) distinct from DNA damaging agents such as platins or RT. In first -
line therapy for recurrent/metastatic SCCHN, the addition of cetuximab to 5 - FU/platinum 
significantly improved overall survival 11. 
 
In locally a dvanced unresectable C SCCHN, cetuximab has been investigated as a single 
agent, demonstrating 69% disease control rat e at [ADDRESS_1261252] of care for these patients (RT alone).  
 
1.5 Safety of Cetuximab in  SCCHN Clinical Studies  
Cetuximab has been evaluated in 208 patients with locally or regionally advanced SCCHN 
who received cetuximab in combination with radiation and as monotherapy in 103 patients 
with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN. Of the 103 patients r eceiving cetuximab 
monotherapy, 53 continued to a second phase with the combination of cetuximab plus 
Complion Document ID: 459969
UCHN -12-001 Page 10 of 38 03APR2018  chemotherapy. Patients receiving cetuximab plus radiation therapy received a median of 8 
doses (range 1 -11 infusions). The population had a median age of 56; 81% were male and 
84% Caucasian. Patients receiving cetuximab monotherapy, received a median of 11 
doses (range 1 -45 infusions). The population had a median age of 57; 82% were male and 
100% Caucasian. The most serious adverse reactions associated with  cetuximab in 
combination with radiation therapy in patients with head and neck cancer were : infusion 
reaction (3%);  cardiopulmonary arrest (2%);  dermatologic toxicity (2.5%);  mucositis (6%);  
radiation dermatitis (3%); confusion (2%); diarrhea (2%).  
 
Fourtee n (7%) patients receiving cetuximab plus radiation therapy and 5 (5%) patients 
receiving cetuximab monotherapy, discontinued treatment primarily because of adverse 
events. The most common adverse events seen in 208 patients receiving cetuximab in 
combinati on with radiation therapy were acneiform  rash (87%), mucositis (86%), radiation 
dermatitis (86%), weight  loss (84%), xerostomia (72%), dysphagia (65%) , asthenia (56%), 
nausea (49%), constipation (35%), and vomiting (29%).  
The most common adverse events see n in 103 patients receiving cetuximab monotherapy 
were acneiform  rash (76%), asthenia (45%), pain (28%), fever (27%), and weight loss 
(27%).  
 
The data in the table below are based on the experience of 208 patients with 
locoregionally advanced SCCHN treated  with cetuximab plus radiation therapy compared 
to 212 patients treated with radiation therapy alone (Cetuximab [Erbitux™] package insert, 
2006).

UCHN -12-001 Page 11 of 38 03APR2018  
 
 
Late Radiation Toxicity  
The overall incidence of late radiation toxicities (any grade) was higher in cet uximab in 
combination with radiation therapy compared with radiation therapy alone. The following 
sites were affected: salivary glands (65% versus 56%), larynx (52% versus 36%), 
subcutaneous tissue (49% versus 45%), mucous membrane (48% versus 39%), 
esopha gus (44% versus 35%), skin (42% versus 33%), brain (11% versus 9%), lung (11% 
versus 8%), spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831] (4% versus 3%), and bone (4% versus 5%). The incidence of 
Grade 3 or 4 late radiation toxicities were generally similar between the radiation therapy 
alone and the cetuximab plus radiation treatment groups.  
 
 
Clinically Relevant Adverse Events Related to Cetuximab  
Pooled adverse event data  are available for 2,127 patients treated with cetuximab alone or 
in combination with chemothe rapy and/or radiation ther apy  (2 1 ImClone studies, 9 [COMPANY_006] 
KgaA, 2 BMS, and 1 ECOG study ). A total of 90.3% of the patients reported adverse 
events (AEs). Approximately two -thirds (64.8%) of patients reported at least one Grade 3 
or 4 event. Cetuximab -related AEs were observed in 1,817 patients (85.4%). The most 
common composite groupi[INVESTIGATOR_899444] (N = 1,817)  include acneiform rash (76.2%), acne -
like rash (72.4 %), fatigue/malaise/lethargy (30 .1%), nausea/vomiting (24%), 
mucositis/stomatitis (17.5 %), infusion -related symptoms (15.6%), diarrhea (15.4 %), and 
hypersensitivity reaction (5.3%).  
Acne -Like Rash  
In clinical studies of cetuximab, dermatologic toxicities, including acneiform rash, skin  
drying and fissuring, and inflammatory and infectious sequelae (e.g., blepharitis, cheilitis, 
Complion Document ID: [ADDRESS_1261253]) were reported. In patients with advanced colorectal cancer, acneiform rash 
was reported in 89% (686/774) of all treated patients, and was sever e (grade 3 or 4) in 
11% (84/774) of these patients. Subsequent to the development of severe dermatologic 
toxicities, complications including S. aureus sepsis and abscesses requiring incision and 
drainage were  reported. Non -suppurative acneiform rash descri bed as “acne”, “rash”, 
“maculopapular rash”, “pustular rash”, “dry skin”, or “exfoliative dermatitis” was observed in 
patients receiving cetuximab plus irinotecan or cetuximab monotherapy. One or more of 
the dermatological adverse events were reported in 8 8% (14% grade 3) of patients 
receiving cetuximab plus irinotecan and in 90% (8% grade 3) of patients receiving 
cetuximab monotherapy. Acneiform rash most commonly occurred on the face, upper 
chest, and back but could extend to the  extremities and was chara cterized by [CONTACT_899456] - or pustular -appearing lesions. Skin drying and fissuring were common in some 
instances, and were associated with inflammatory and infectious sequelae (e.g., 
blepharitis, cellulitis, cyst). Two cases of S. aureus sepsis were  reported. The onset of 
acneiform rash was generally within the first two weeks of therapy. Although in a majority 
of the patients the event resolved following cessation of treatment, in  nearly half of the 
cases, the event continued beyond 28 days.  
 
Nail D isorder  
A related nail disorder, occurring in 14% of patients (0.4% Grade 3), is characterized as a 
paronychial inflammation with associated swelling of the lateral nail folds of the toes and 
fingers, with the great toes and thumbs as the most commonly aff ected digits.  
 
Infusion Reactions  
In clinical trials, severe, potentially fatal infusion reactions were reported, one leading to 
death. These events include the rapid onset of airway obstruction (bronchospasm, stridor, 
hoarseness), urticaria, and/or hypote nsion. In studies in advanced colorectal cancer, 
severe infusion reactions were observed in 3% of patients receiving cetuximab plus 
irinotecan and 2% of patients receiving cetuximab monotherapy. Grade [ADDRESS_1261254] day of initial 
dosing, were observed in 16% of patients receiving cetuximab plus irinotecan and 19% of 
patients receiving cetuximab monotherapy. A [ADDRESS_1261255] dose did not reliably identify patients at risk for severe allergic reactions. Severe 
infusion reactions occurred with the administration of cetuximab in approximately 3% of 
patients, rarely  with fatal outcome (<1 in 1000). Approximately 90% of severe infusion 
reactions were associated with the first infusion of cetuximab despi[INVESTIGATOR_899445]. These reactions were characterized by [CONTACT_899457] n (bronchospasm, stridor, hoarseness), urticaria, and/or hypotension.  
 
Pulmonary Toxicity  
Interstitial lung disease (ILD) was reported in 3 of 774 (< 0.5%) patients with advanced 
colorectal cancer receiving cetuximab. Interstitial pneumonitis with non -cardiogenic 
pulmonary edema resulting in death was reported in one case. Two patients had pre -
existing fibrotic lung disease and experienced an acute exacerbation of their disease while 
receiving cetuximab in combination with irinotecan. In the clinical invest igational program, 
an additional case of interstitial pneumonitis was reported in a patient with head and neck 
cancer treated with  cetuximab and cisplatin. The onset of symptoms occurred between the 
fourth and eleventh doses of treatment in all reported ca ses. 
 
Complion Document ID: [ADDRESS_1261256]  when possible .  
Otherwise, tissues may be requested from pathology. These samples may be used for 
future exploratory analysis of other molecular factors in CSCCHN. Presently, while much 
has been learned about the relationships among EGFR, ce tuximab, and SCCHN, there is 
marked uncertainty regarding if and how this biological information should be used 
clinically in mucosal or cutaneous SCCHN.  
 
1.7 Quality of Life an d Function Assessments  
It is now well established that cancer of the head and neck often has profoundly 
debilitating effects on quality of life (QOL), function, and performance. In a recently 
reported phase III trial of cetuximab and radiation therapy (RT) for mucosal head and neck 
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), cetuximab did not significantly increase acute RT-
associated adverse effects (Bonner 2006). This study  also found that addition of cetuximab 
to RT significantly improved locoregional control and increased overall survival without 
adversely affecting QOL (Curran 2007)13.  
 
1.7.1 Quality of Life (QOL) Assessments  
Quality of life will be assessed using two  validated, multidimensional patient reported QOL 
measures including: the FACT HN  and the Dermatology Life Quality  Index  (DLQI) . Both of 
these QOL validated tools are currently  being used by [CONTACT_899458] , and the 
FACT HN  is being used in the UCCI Prospective Head and Neck Oncology 
Comprehensive Database that is set to go live 1/1/[ADDRESS_1261257] -H&N is a multidimensional, patient self -report QOL instrument specificall y 
designed and validated for use with head and neck cancer patients. The FACT -HN 
consists of a 27 -item core scale (FACT -G) and is supplemented with a 12 -item head and 
neck subscale targeting head and neck related symptoms and side effects14.  
The Dermatolog y Life Quality Index (DLQI) will be used to explore the impact of cetuximab  
induced  rash on quality of life. It is expected that rash (acneiform; maculo -papular), pruritis,  
and other vi sible consequences  associated with cetuximab -induced rash will  have a 
significant negative im pact quality of life15,16. The DLQI17 is designed to assess the impact 
of a wide range of skin  disease on patient quality of life 18,19, and it is currently being used 
in RTOG [ADDRESS_1261258] of cetuximab -induced rash on QOL  in m ucosal 
SCCHN . The DLQI consists of 10  items and covers 6 domains including symptoms and 
feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and  school, personal relationships, and treatment. 
Response categories i nclude "not at all," "a little, "a lot," and "very much ," with 
corresponding scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3 respectively; the response  "not relevant" (and 
unanswered items) are scored as "0". A total score is calculated by  [CONTACT_899459], resulting in a maximum score of 30 and a minimum score of 0.  Scale scores are 
calculated for each domain. Higher scores indicate poorer HRQL (i.e., more  impairment). 
The FACT HN and DLQI will be administered a baseline and at 3, 12, and 24 months after 
the start of radiation therapy.  
 
1.7.2 Timeframe of Assessments  
These patient -reported QOL and function measures and the clinician -assessed measures 
will be administered at baseline and at 3, 12, and 24 months from the start of radiation. 
Complion Document ID: [ADDRESS_1261259] of radiation therapy +/ - cetuximab on QOL. The [ADDRESS_1261260] all acute  toxicities related to radiation will be resolved, and they are interested 
in assessing the patient’s  QOL at that time. These 2 assessment  time points for patient 
reported  outcomes are routinely used in RTOG and other head and neck studies. PRO 
assessment has been added at 24 months from RT completion.  That time point was 
chosen because 80 to 90% of the patients who will progress do so by 2  years. For patients 
who are disease free then, the issue, it is felt,  
becomes the long -term sequelae of the treatments.

10% below ideal body weight) within 4 weeks prior to the start of treatment;  
4.2.[ADDRESS_1261268] begin within 3 weeks after registration.  
6.1  Dose Specifications  
The prescr ibed radiotherapy dose will be 60 -66 Gy in 2 Gy once -daily fraction size (total of 
30-33 fractions). Radiotherapy should begin on a Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. The 
daily dose of 2 Gy will be presc ribed such that 95% of the PTV  volume receives at least 
95% of prescribed dose . The sp inal cord dose may not exceed 45  Gy to any volume larger 
than 0.03 cc.  
6.2  Technical Factors  
Treatment Planning/Delivery: Megavoltage energy phot on beam irradiation is required, but 
may also include electron therapy as necessary to include superficial disease areas.  3D 
conformal or IMRT tr eatment planning may be may be used, and treatment verification 
films must be taken a least once weekly.

Slice thickness should be 0.3 cm  or less .  
6.4 Target and N ormal Tissue Volume Restrictions  
6.4.1 Definition of Target Volumes  
[IP_ADDRESS] CTV60: This volume will receive 2 Gy per day. CTV60 will include the p rimary 
tumor bed  (based on preoperative imaging, preoperative physical exam/endoscopy, 
operative findings, patholo gic findings) plus the post -operative neck . This volume may 
include the skin . It is recognized that after surgery, there can be considerable d istortion of 
normal anatomy. If pos sible, preoperative GTV(s) should be fused onto the postoperative 
radiation th erapy planning CT scan, and appropriate margins added for microscopic 
spread (1.5 -2 cm).  
CTV60 also will include the ipsilateral pathologically  positive hemineck (if both sides of the 
neck are proven pathologically positive, CTV60 will include both sides). This generally 
means encompassing nodal levels 2a, 3, and [ADDRESS_1261271]. Mierzwa.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  CTV56: This will include all other regions felt to be at risk for harboring 
microscopic cancer that do not meet the criteria for CTV60. For example, this would apply 
to the contralateral hemineck b eing irradiated electively for a midline primary cancer . This 
volume will receive approximately 1.85 - 2 Gy per day.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  CTV66 Optional: This may be defined at the discretion of the treating radiation 
oncologist. This would  include a region or regions felt to be at especially high risk for 
recurrence (e.g., an area of very close margin of resection  or nodal extracapsular 
extension ). This area will be receiving a daily fraction size of 2- 2.2 Gy and thus, the 
volume of CTV66 should be kept as small as possible.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Planning Target Volumes (PTVs): In general, the PTV should not go outside of the 
skin surface; if it does exceed the skin surface, the application of bolus material over this 
portion of the PTV may be consider ed to treat skin to full dose .  
[IP_ADDRESS].1   PTV Expansion The mini mum CTV -to- PTV expansion is 3  mm (a larger 
expansion may be necessary for a target volume subject to significant intra -fraction 
variability, such as the non -immobilized oral tongue).   In gen eral, the CTV -to-PTV 
expansion should not exceed 10  mm.  
6.4.2 Definition of Normal Tissues/Organs at Risk (OARs) - adapted from RTOG 1016  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_35406]: The cord begins at the cranial -cervical junction (i.e ., the top of the C1 
vertebral body). Super ior to this is brainstem and inferior to this is cord. The inferior border

addition, however, a Planning Risk Volume (PRV) spi[INVESTIGATOR_181589]. The 
PRVcord = cord + 5 mm in each dimension. This is irrespective of whether or not IGRT is 
Complion Document ID: 459969
UCHN -12-001 Page 19 of 38 03APR2018  used.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Brainstem: The inferior most portion of the brainstem is at the cran ial-cervical 
junction where it meets the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]. For the purposes of this study, the superior most 
portion of the brainstem is approximately at the level of the top of the posterior clinoid. The 
brainstem shall be defined based on the treatment planni ng CT scan. In addition, however, 
a Planning Risk Volume (PRV) brainstem shall be defined. The PRVbrainstem = brainstem 
+ 3 mm in each dimension.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Lips and Oral Cavity: These should be contoured as 2 separate structures as the 
goal is to keep the lip dose much lower than the oral cavity dose. The definition of lips is 
self explanatory. The oral cavity will be defined as a composite structure consisting of the 
anterior 1⁄2 to 2/3 of the oral tongue/floor of mouth, buccal mucosa, and palate.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Parotid Glands: Parotid glands will be defined based on the treatment planning CT 
scan.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  OARpharynx: This will be defined as the “uninvolved” posterior pharyngeal wall 
plus adjacent constrictor muscles. This extends from the superior constrictor region (the 
inferior pterygoid plates level) to the cricopharyngeal inlet (posterior cricoi d cartilage level). 
This should not overlap the PTVs.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Cervical Esophagus: This will be defined as a tubular structure that starts at the 
bottom of OARpharynx and extends to the thoracic inlet.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Glottic/Supraglottic Larynx (GSL): Obviousl y, for patients who have had a total 
laryngectomy, this structure is not applicable. This will be defined as a “triangular prism 
shaped” volume that begins just inferior to the hyoid bone and extends to the cricoid 
cartilage inferiorly and extends from the  anterior commissure to include the arytenoids. 
This includes the infrahyoid but not suprahyoid epi[INVESTIGATOR_24050].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Mandible: This includes the entire boney structure of the mandible from TMJ 
through the symphysis. It is recognized that for oral cavity c ancers, this may overlap with 
CTVs and PTVs.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Unspecified Tissue Outside the Targets: This will be defined as tissue located 
between the skull base and thoracic inlet that is not included in either the target volumes or 
the normal tissues describe d above.  
6.5 Treatment Planning and Delivery  
Dose Prescription to PTV s 
 As described in Section 6.1, prescribed radiotherapy dose will be 60 Gy in 2 Gy once -daily 
fraction size. For inverse planning IMRT, the goal is for 95% of the PTV60 to receive 95% 
of 2 Gy with a minimum dose (cold spot) of no less than 56 Gy. It is recognized that 
portions of the PTV60 close to /within  the skin may receive significantly less than 56 Gy. 
Bolus should be considered for these cutaneous areas deemed to be at risk for 
micro scopic disease. Electron cones may also be employed to provide adequate dose to 
PTVs which emcompass cutaneous tissues.  
Complion Document ID: [ADDRESS_1261272]: The PRVcord (as defined in Secti on [IP_ADDRESS]) should not exceed 45  Gy to any 
volume in excess of 0.03 cc (approximately 3 mm x 3 mm x 3 mm). The spi[INVESTIGATOR_899446] [ADDRESS_1261273] priority.  
Brainstem: The PRVbrains tem (as defined in Secti on [IP_ADDRESS]) should not exceed 50  Gy to 
any volume in excess of 0.03 cc (approximately 3 mm x 3 mm x 3 mm). In treatment 
planning, the PRVbrainstem should be given less priority than the PRVcord but more 
priority than the other criti cal structures listed below.  
Lips: Reduce the dose as much as possible  unless lips involved with primary tumor . The 
mean dose should be < 20 Gy.  The maximum dose will be < 30 Gy.  
Oral Cavity: Reduce the dose as much as possible . The mean dose should be <  30 Gy .  
Parotid Glands: In most cases, it will be easier to spare one parotid than the other. The 
treatment planning goal will be for this individual parotid gland to receive a mean dose of < 
26 Gy. Additional planning goals may include: 1) At least 50% o f one parotid will receive < 
30 Gy; and/or 2) At least 20 cc of parotid tissue (from the combination of both glands) will 
receive < 20 Gy.  
OARpharynx: Reduce the dose as much as possible. Some recommended (but not 
mandatory) treatment goals include: 1) No  more than 33% of the OARpharynx exceeds 50 
Gy; 2) Mean dose < 45 Gy; 3) No more than 15% of the OARpharynx exceeds 60 Gy.  
Cervical Esophagus: Reduce the dose as much as possible. For oral or oropharyngeal 
cancer, some recommended (but not mandatory) trea tment goals include: 1) No more than 
33% of the esophagus exceeds 45 Gy; 2) Mean dose < 35 Gy; 3) No more than 15% of 
the esophagus exceeds 54 Gy. For larynx cancer, higher doses are expected and 
permitted. Some recommended doses (but not mandatory) treatm ent goals include: 1) No 
more than 33% of the esophagus exceeds 50 Gy; 2) Mean dose < 45 Gy; 3) No more than 
15% of the esophagus exceeds 60 Gy.  
Glottic and Supraglottic larynx (GSL): Reduce the dose as much as possible.  
Mandible: Reduce the dose as much  as possible , hot spots within the mandible should be 
avoided. It is recommended that maximum dose within the mandible be < 66 Gy. For 
tumors that were not clinically or pathologically involving the mandible, the CTV should be 
contoured off the mandible.  
Unspecified Tissue Outside the Targets: For the typi[INVESTIGATOR_306398]66, 
no more than 5% of unspecified tissue can receive greater than 58 Gy and no more than 
1% or 1cc of unspecified tissue can receive [ADDRESS_1261274] is used to  
increase the dose to high risk regions to as much as 66 Gy, these numbers can be 
increased. In this case, no more than 5% of the unspecified dose should exceed the level 
Complion Document ID: [ADDRESS_1261275] dose, and no more than 1% or [ADDRESS_1261276] dose value plu s 
10%.  
6.[ADDRESS_1261277] along with the 
reason(s) for the treatment break(s). Treatment breaks, if necessary, ideally should not 
exceed five treatment days at a time and ten treatmen t days total. Treatment breaks 
should be allowed only for resolution of severe acute toxicity and/or for intercurrent illness 
and not for social or logistical reasons.  
 
6.7  Radia tion Therapy Adverse Events  The descriptions and grading scales found in 
the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4 .03 
will be utilized for grading all adverse events .  Placement of a feeding tube should be 
recorded as should use of a feeding tube during and after treatment (e.g., greater than  or 
less than 50% of nutrition by [CONTACT_181616]). Other common radiation adverse events include: 
fatigue, weight loss, regional alopecia, xerostomia, hoarseness, tra nsient ear discomfort , 
and skin erythema and desquamation within the treatment fields. Less common l ong-term 
treatment adverse events include: hypothyroidism, loss of hearing, chronic swallowing 
dysfunction requiring permanent feeding tube, and skin/soft tissue  fibrosis. Much less 
common radiation adverse events include: mandibular osteoradionecrosis , and cervical 
myelopathy (< 1%  with restriction of spi[INVESTIGATOR_306399]  45 Gy).  
7.[ADDRESS_1261278] begin within 2 weeks after registration.  
7.1 Cetuximab Initial Dose (Prior to RT): Patients will receive an initial dose of ce tuximab, 
400 mg/m2, intravenously (i.v.) over 120 minutes. No chemotherapy or radiation will be 
given this day, and the 400 mg/m2 initial dose of cetuximab will precede the first 250 
mg/m2 dose of cetuximab and the first radiation treatment by [CONTACT_2669] 5 d ays (the day of 
the loading dose is not included in these 5 days). The infusion rate of cetuximab must 
never exceed 5 mL/min.  
7.2 Cetuximab subsequent dosing  
Cetuximab weeks 2  through 7 or 8  (concurrent with RT  depending on standard of care 
RT): Patients w ill receive cetuximab, 250 mg/m2, intravenously (i.v.) over [ADDRESS_1261279] never exceed 5 mL/min. Cetuximab 
will be given once a week prior to RT  for a total of 6 -7 doses concurrent with radiation 
thera py.  
In cases of delay in the completion of radiation therapy, then the concurrent doses of 
cetuximab may continue beyond week 8 without dose interruption until rad iation therapy is 
completed . The total of number of cetuxima b doses should not exceed 11 . 
7.2.1 Safety  
CAUTION: Infusion reactions may occur during or following cetuximab 
administration. Most infusion reactions occur with the first infusion of cetuximab, 
Complion Document ID: 459969
UCHN -12-001 Page 22 of 38 03APR2018  but some patients’ first infusion reactions have been reported following subsequent 
doses (a severe reaction occurred in one patient following the 8th dose). The 
infusion reaction may occur during the infusion or be delayed until any time after 
the infusion. Premedications are recommended and per discretion of the treating 
physician.  
The medical s taff must closely observe patients for treatment -related adverse events, 
especially infusion reactions during the cetuximab infusion and during a post -infusion 
observation hour. For the initial cetuximab infusion, vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and temperature) should be monitored prior to the administration of 
cetuximab, a half hour into the infusion, at the completion of the infusion, and [ADDRESS_1261280] the infusion in an area with resuscitation equipment and other agents (epi [INVESTIGATOR_238], 
prednisone equivalents, etc.) available. A nurse must be present in the immediate 
treatment area throughout the infusion and observation period. A physician must be in 
close proximity to the patient treatment area.  
For subsequent infusions, vita l signs should b e taken pre - and post -infusion.  
7.2.2  Formulation   Cetuximab is an anti -EGFR receptor humanized chimeric monoclonal 
antibody. Cetuximab is expressed in SP2/[ADDRESS_1261281] be admi nistered with the use of a low protein binding 0 .22-
micrometer in -line filter.  Cetuximab is supplied as a 50 -mL, single -use vial containing 100 
mg of cetuximab at a concentration of 2 mg/mL in phosphate buffered saline. The solution 
should be clear and co lorless and may contain a small amount of easily visible white 
amorphous cetuximab particulates.  Cetuximab can be administered via infus ion pump or 
syringe pump.  
. Infusion Pump:  
 Draw up the volume of a vial using a sterile syringe attached to an appropri ate 
needle (a vented spi[INVESTIGATOR_333485]).  
 Fill cetuximab into a sterile evacuated container or bag such as glass containers, 
polyolefin bags (e.g., Baxter Intravia), ethylene vinyl acetate bags (e.g., 
Baxter Clintec), D EHP plasticized PVC bags (e.g., Abbott Lifecare), or PVC 
bags.  
 Repeat procedure until the calculated volume has been put in to the container. 
Use a new needle for each vial.  
 Administration must be through a low protein binding 0.22 -micrometer in -line fil ter 
(placed as proximal to the patient as practical).  
Complion Document ID: 459969
UCHN -12-001 Page 23 of 38 03APR2018   Affix the infusion line and prime it with  normal saline before starting the infusion.  
 Maximum infusion rate should not exceed 5 mL/min.  
 Use 0.9% saline solution to flush line at the end of infusion.  
. Syringe Pump:  
 Draw up the volume of a vial using a sterile syringe attached to an appropriate 
needle (a vented spi[INVESTIGATOR_762489]).  
 Place the syringe into the syringe driver of a syringe pump and set the rate.  
 Administration must be through a low protei n binding 0.22 -micrometer in -line filter 
rated for syringe pump use (placed as proximal to the patient as practical).  
 Connect up the infusion line and start the infusion after priming the line with 
cetuximab.  
 Repeat procedure until the calculated volume has been infused.  
 Use a new needle and filter for each vial.  
 Maximum infusion rate should not exceed 5 mL/min.  
 Use 0.9% saline solution to flush line at the end of infusion.  
. Cetuximab should be pi[INVESTIGATOR_483916]’s infusion line. Following the cetuximab 
infusion, a one -hour observation period is recommended.  
. 7.2.5  Storage Requirements/Stability  Store vials under refrigeration at 2 C to 8 C (36 F 
to 46 F). DO NOT FREEZE. Increased particulate formation may occur at 
temperatures at or below [ADDRESS_1261282] contains no preservatives. Preparations 
of cetuximab in infusion containers are chemically and physically stable for up to 12 
hours at 2 C to 8 C (36 F to 46 F) and up to 8 hours at controlled room temperature 
(20 C to 25 C; 68 F to 77 F). Dis card any remaining solution in the infusion

7.3.5 Cetuximab Special Instructions    If cetuximab is omitted for more than four 
consecutive infusions for adverse events due to cetuximab, or  for an intercurrent illness 
(e.g., infection) requiring interruption of therapy, the subject should be discontinued from 
further cetuximab therapy. Cetuximab doses held due to toxicity should not be made up. If 
a cetuximab dose is missed for reasons unrel ated to drug toxicity, then the missed dose 
may be made up at th e discretion of the Medical Oncologist , at the next appropriate time 
point . If adverse events prevent the administration of cetuximab, the subject may continue 
to receive radiation therapy.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Management of Cetuximab Infusion Reactions  Severe or life threatening (grade 
3 or 4) infusion reactions require the immediate interruption of cetuximab therapy and 
permanent discontinuation from further treatment. Appropriate medical therapy includi ng 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], corticosteroids, intravenous antihistamines, bronchodilators, and oxygen 
should be available for use in the treatment of such reactions. Patients should be carefully 
observed until the complete resolution of all signs and symptoms.  In clin ical trials, mild to 
moderate infusion reactions were managed by [CONTACT_899460] -medications (e.g., diphenhydramine) in subsequent 
doses. If the patient experiences a mild or moderate (grade 1 or 2) infusion reaction, the 
infusion rate should be permanently reduced by 50%. For grade 1 or 2 reactions 
manifesting only as delayed drug fever, see below.  Cetuximab should be immediately and 
permanently discontinued in patients who experience  sever e (grade 3 or 4) infusion 
reactions.  
Complion Document ID: 459969
UCHN -12-001 Page 27 of 38 03APR2018  [IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment of Isolated Drug Fever   In the event of isolated drug fever, the 
investigator must use clinical judgment to determine if the fever is related to the study drug 
or to an infectious etiology.  If a pat ient experiences isolated drug fever, for the next dose, 
pre-treat with acetaminophen or non -steroidal anti -inflammatory agent , repeat antipyretic 
dose [ADDRESS_1261285] - dosing with an appropriate antipyretic, the infusion rate for 
subsequent dosing should be 50% of previous rate. If fever recurs following infusio n rate 
change, the treati ng Medical Oncologist should assess the patient’s level of discomfort 
with the event and use clinical judgment to determine if the patient should receive further 
cetuximab.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Cetuximab -related Rash  
Manifestations  Rash associated with EGFR -inhibit ors is a relatively new dermatologic 
condition. It appears to be “acneiform” but it is NOT considered a form of acne; rather, it is 
a form of folliculitis. Skin changes may be manifested in a number of ways: erythema; 
follicle based papules, which may ulce rate; pain; itching; cosmetic disturbance; and/or nail 
disorders. The rash may become infected and transform into cellulitis.  
Grading of Cetuximab -induced Ras h According to physician judgment, if a patien t 
experiences grade 3 rash , cetuximab treatment adj ustments should be made. In patients 
with mild and moderate skin adverse events, cetuximab should continue without 
adjustment. NOTE: Rash intensity (i.e., the size and number of papules or the level of 
discomfort and extent of erythema) may be an important  consideration. However, the 
absolute number of lesions, without associated physical discomfort, does not 
necessarily constitute a basis for a dose reduction or delay.  
Skin and nail changes should be graded as follows, with dose modification for > grade 3  
changes.

[IP_ADDRESS].1  Drug Related Rash Management  
Patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_453717], and appropriate  
treatment of these symptoms initiated. Below are suggestions for managing cet uximab - 
induced rash adapted from :  Perez -Soler R, Delord J, Halpern A, et al. HER1/EGFR 
inhibitor -associated rash: Future directions for management and investigation outcomes 
from the HER1/EGFR Inhibitor Rash Management Forum. The Oncologist. 10:345 –356, 
2005.  
Antibiotics: The benefit of routine antibiotics in unco mplicated (uninfected) rash is 
unclear. Some clinicians have used oral minocycline (Minocin), mupi[INVESTIGATOR_19190] (Bactroban), or 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_47288] (Cleocin). Rash complicated by [CONTACT_899461].

UCHN -12-001 Page 29 of 38 03APR2018  Antihistamines: Benadryl or Atarax may be helpful to control itching.  
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_899447]: The benefit of topi[INVESTIGATOR_193574].  
Retinoids: No data to support use. Use is not advised.  
Benzoyl peroxide: Should NOT be used --may aggravate rash.  
Makeup: Rash can be covered with makeup; this should not make it worse (use a 
dermatolog ist-approved cover -up, e.g., Dermablend, or any other type of foundation). 
Remove makeup with a skin -friendly liquid cleanser, e.g., Neutrogena, Dove, or Ivory Skin 
Cleansing Liqui -Gel.  
Moisturizers: Use emollients to prevent and alleviate the skin drynes s, e.g., Neutrogena 
Norwegian Formula Hand Cream or Vaseline Intensive Care Advanced Healing Lotion.  
Sunlight: It is recommended that patients wear sunscreen and hats and limit sun 
exposure while receiving cetuximab as sunlight can exacerbate any skin rea ctions that 
may occur.  
Over -the-counter medications: Over -the-counter acne vulgaris medications (e.g., 
benzoyl peroxide) are not advised. This rash is not like acne vulgaris and these treatments 
could make it worse.  
7.4 Adverse Events  
The descriptions a nd grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4 .03. will be utilized for AE reporting. All 
serious adverse events will be reported to the IRB per institutional protocol.  
 
8.0 TISSUE/SPECIMEN SUB MISSION  
8.1  Tissue/Specimen Submission    
Tumor tissue and blood will be collected from all patients  when possible .  Tumor tissue will 
be collected at the time of resection and will include specimens from the primary tumor and 
nodal disease as available.  All University of Cincinnati specimens will be maintained in the 
UCCI Tumor Bank per institutional protocol  or will be requested from pathology.  A ll 
University of Michigan specimens will be maintained  at University of Michigan . Tissue and 
blood submissio n is encouraged but not required for protocol enrollment.  
8.2  Buccal swab collection  
For University of Michigan patients  ONLY , buccal swabs will be collected from the area 
within the anticipated radiation field pre -cetuximab (between days -7 to 0), after the first 
dose of cetuximab (between days 3 and 7), and during radiotherapy (between days 22 and 
30). Specimens will be collected as follows: After subject rinses his/her mouth with water, 
buccal cells (mucosal cells), will be scraped using sterile Cell Li fter (Manufacturer: 
CORNING LIFE SCIENCES PLASTIC 3008).  
Complion Document ID: 459969
UCHN -12-001 Page 30 of 38 03APR2018  In order to obtain enough cells for analysis of proteins, cell lifer will be twirled 3 -4 times 
gently. Total time will be about 20 -30 seconds.  The cells will be collected from the cell 
lifter into 50 ml sterile collection tube containing ice cold 5 ml of sterile PBS with protease 
and phosphatase inhibitor. These collection tubes will be transported to research 
laboratory located in Med Sci I (Room # 4311) on ice as soon as possible.  The swabs will 
be transfer to freezer until testing.  
 
Objective of Study:  
1. Deep sequencing of DNA from normal and tumor specimen to identify driver 
oncogenes in given patient.  
2. Analyze pharmacodynamic changes in the normal tissue collected before and 
during (total 3 time p oints/patient) radiotherapy for driver molecules identified by 
[CONTACT_899462].  
Correlate findings from objective 1 and 2 with clinical outcome in terms of toxicity and 
response  
 
9.0 PATIENT ASSESSMENTS  
9.1 Study Parameters :  
Gross total resection/surgical pathology (for post -operative patients) or biopsy (for 
definitive patients) must be com pleted within 7 weeks prior to registration.  
A general history & physical by a Radiation Oncologist and/or M edical Oncologist must be 
done within 2  weeks prior to registration, and an examination by [CONTACT_445179] & Neck 
Surgeon  must be done within [ADDRESS_1261286] of care .  
9.2 Evaluation During Radiotherapy  
A general history & physical by a Radiation O ncologist and/or M edical Oncologist must be

Patients must have CBCw/diff, CMP, and Mg every other week  during radiation therapy  
per routine standard of care for cetuximab administration . 
Biopsy of any lesion(s) su spi[INVESTIGATOR_899448].  
9.3 Evaluation in Follow Up  
A history and physical by [CONTACT_080]: a  Radiation Oncologist, Medical Oncologist, 
an ENT, or a Head and Neck Surgeon must be performed at [ADDRESS_1261287] of care practice 
in follow -up for head and neck cancers.  This should include a complete head and n eck 
and cutaneous exam and review of systems focusing on head and neck, cutaneous and 
pulmonary complaints.

Month 3, Month [ADDRESS_1261288] imaging will be performed as indicated clinically.  
Biopsy of any lesion(s) suspi[INVESTIGATOR_899449].   
9.4 Outcomes Criteria  
No evidence of disea se (NED): All patients must have not measurable tumor following 
surgery. Local -Regional Relapse: Recurrent cancer in the tumor bed and/or neck not 
clearly attributable to a second primary neoplasm; both  imaging and biopsy confirmation 
are recommended but n ot required . LRR will be further subdivided into three 
subcategories:  
In-Field Local -Regional Relapse - Review of the imaging of the local -regional relap se and 
the patient’s previous RT treatment data reveals that the “epi[CONTACT_384]” of the local -regional 
relap se is within CTV60 and received an es timated dose of at least 50 Gy.  
Marginal Local -Regional Relapse - Review of the imaging of the local -regional relapse and 
the patient’s previous RT treatment data reveals that the “epi[CONTACT_384]” of the local -regional 
relaps e was “near” CTV60. This is defined as an estimated dose to this region that is 
between 20 and 50 Gy.  
Out-of-Field Local -Regional Relapse - Review of the imaging of the local -regional relap se 
and the patient’s previous RT treatment data reveals that the “e pi[CONTACT_384]” of the local -
regional relapse was not near CTV60 or CTV56 and received an estimated dose < 20 Gy.  
Distant Relapse : For clinical e vidence of distant metastases (lung, bone, brain, etc.); 
biopsy is required . A solitary lung mass/nodule should be c onsidered a second primary 
upper aerodigestive neoplasm unless proven otherwise . 
Second Primary Neoplasm : All second primary neoplasms will be biopsy proven with 
documentation of specific histology. Modified rigorous criteria for a second primary (below) 
have been adapted from the definition by [CONTACT_899463] (1932 ). 
A distinct lesion separated from the primary tumor site by > 2 cm of normal epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130]; a  
new c ancer with different histology; Any cancer, regardless of head and neck mucosal 
subsite, occurri ng 5 or more  years after initial treatment; In the lung, new primary tumors, if 
squamous cell cancer, must have histologic findings of dysplasia or CIS.  
Second Primary Upper Aerodigestive Neoplasm: The emergence of a new, invasive 
malignancy in the upper a erodigestive tract as a second primary should be documented. 
These neoplasms include lung cancer, esophageal cancer (including GE junction cancer), 
or 2nd primary head and neck cancer that is clearly remote from the index cancer . 
9.5 Quality of Life a nd Fu nctional Assessments  
The assessments will be completed  prior to the start of cetuximab  (baseline) and at 3, 12, 
and 24  months from the end of RT.  
Complion Document ID: 459969
UCHN -12-001 Page 32 of 38 03APR2018  9.5.1 The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy -Head & Neck (FACT HN ) is a 
multidimensional, patient -self re port quality of life (QOL) instrument specifically designed 
and validated for use with head and neck patients.  
9.5.2  The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) consists of 10 items and covers 6 
domains including symptoms and feelings (e.g., felt itchy, sor e, painful, embarrassed), 
daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment .  
9.[ADDRESS_1261289] to withdrawal  of patient consent (including patients lost to follow -up).  A patient may 
withdraw consent partially or fully at any time during the study.  Pa rtial withdrawal  of 
consent will be defined as patient refusal to continue protocol therapy while continuing to 
consent to follow -up on study.  Full withdrawal  of consent will be defined as refusal of any 
further participation in the study.     
 
 
10.[ADDRESS_1261290] 80% of the radiotherapy dose prescribed will be 
considered to have completed protocol therapy. Patients who complete therapy but 
become non -evaluable for toxicity before the post -treatment observation period ends will 
be counted as evaluable in the final analysis, and weighted in statistical analyses by [CONTACT_899464] 18 -week toxicity observation period for which they were evaluable.  
 
Patient accrual is projected to be 20 -25 ca ses per year based on current estimates of the 
number of patients with locally advanced CSCCHN diagnosed/treated annually at the 
University of Cincinnati and the University of Michigan . Otolaryngology billing records from 
University of Michigan suggest that 65-75 patients annually  undergo resection of locally 
advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and all would be potential trial candidates.  
It is expected that this trial will be open to accrual for 24 -36 months.   
 
This is a Simon 2 -stage design with 40 patients in stage 1 and an additional 70 in stage 2. 
Complion Document ID: [ADDRESS_1261291] -operatively improves 2 year loco-regional control (LRC) 
compared to radiotherapy alone. Using Simon’s optimal two stage design with locoregional 
control as the primary efficacy point , 2 year loco-regional control for patients with locally 
advanced CSCCHN has historically been 55 -70 % with resection and post -operative 
radiotherapy alone at 2 years, with 5 year overall survival of approximately 40 -55% and 
median survival of 20 -25 months.  In the multi -center, randomized trial of mucosal SCCHN 
by [CONTACT_262504] ., the additional of cetuximab to radiotherapy increased 2 yr LRC from 41 to 
50% and correspondingly increased 5 yr OS from 36 to 45%.  Based on these results, our 
target loco -regional control would be 78% based on the University of Cincinnati experience 
achieving 65% loco -regional control with post -operative RT alone. We would reject the null 
hypothesis if greater than if Kaplan Meier curves estimated greater than 72% loco-regional 
control.  
 Initial statistical design was formed with the help of Jareen Me izen-Derr, PhD, MPH in the 
Division of Biostatistics and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_899450].  Data collection would be completed 
by [CONTACT_899465] a 
biostatistician within the De partment of Radiation Oncology.  C hangchun Xie, PhD in the 
Dept of Epi[INVESTIGATOR_899451] . The trial will also be opened at the University 
of Michigan.   
Loco -regional control and ov erall survival will be estimated by [CONTACT_8761] -Meier method.  
 
Definitions of Endpoints  
2 year LRC will be defined as the absence of tumor appearance in the primary site or neck 
within 2 years, as assessed and documented through clinical exam and imaging 
completed q3 months by [CONTACT_899466] -up period.   Loco -regional 
recurrence should be confimed by [CONTACT_899467], and the precise location 
documented (primary site versus neck).   
 
[ADDRESS_1261292] deviation of 
these scales will be calculated and the mean change summarized for each time point.  
 
11. Data collection and Data and Safety Monitoring  
Complion Document ID: [ADDRESS_1261293] and data will be stored securely wi thin OnCore. The 
University of Michigan will utilize Velos .  
Per our data use agreement, de -identified study data may be shared between University of 
Cincinnati and University of Michigan.  
11.2 Data and Safety Monitoring  
UCCI: All cancer related therapeu tic clinical trials conducted at the University of Cincinnati 
Cancer Institute (UCCI) require monitoring by a safety committee as part of their Data 
Safety and Monitoring Plan. The internal UCCI Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will 
monitor all investig ator initiated studies. The DSMB is an independent group of experts 
who will advise the study investigators  and report relevant findings to IRB or other 
appropriate authorities.  
  
Study  parameters may vary depending on the type and risk of the study under  evaluation. 
Each study will be evaluated at least twice a year.   The DSMB will focus on the analytic 
plan to include: hypothesis, primary objective, endpoints and will monitor study conduct 
including accrual, protocol required tests, IND, toxicities and e fficacy. The DSMB will use 
case report forms, and data points to complete their safety assessment and make 
recommendations for a continued monitoring plan. All meetings are recorded by [CONTACT_899468].   
  
DSMB initial study evaluation will occur after  previous Protocol Review and Monitoring 
committee (PRMC) and Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval. If the DSMB 
recommends a study design amendment or the PI [INVESTIGATOR_899452], PRMC 
approval will be required.  
  
All serious adverse events wil l be reported immediately to the DSMB Chair and other 
members of the DSMB by [CONTACT_306428]. The DSMB Chair or DSMB 
Administrator will notify the Study Sponsor (or sponsor designee) directly of any findings of 
a serious and immediate nature or recommendations to discontinue all or part of the trial. 
An Immediate Action report will be created and submitted to the UCCI CTO Regulatory 
Coordinator for appropriate dissemination to regulatory authorities.  
UM: This trial will be locally monitored in  accordance with the NCI approved University of 
Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Plan.  
 
The study team will meet quarterly  or more frequently depending on the activity of the 
protocol. The discussion will include matters rela ted to the safety of study participants 
(SAE/UaP reporting), validity and integrity of the data, enrollment rate relative to 
expectations, characteristics of participants, retention of participants, adherence to the 
protocol (potential or real protocol dev iations) and data completeness. At these regular

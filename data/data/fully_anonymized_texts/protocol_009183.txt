POINT PROTOCOL VERSI ON 2.1 (1 6 FEB 2017)  Abstract │ 9 
 
P:\Doc\MUST \POINT \protocol \17 02 16_2.1 \[ADDRESS_823967] frequently used 
treatments specifically for uveitic macular edema but there is a lack of high quality evidence to 
guide choice of drug  (e.g., triamcinolone acetonide, dexamethasone) and route  of 
administration (e.g. periocular, intravitreal).  The question of how to approach regional treatment of uveitic macular edema is a key question for ophthalmologists treating these patients.   The 
Perio cular and I ntravitreal Corticosteroids for Uvei tic Macular Edema (POINT) Trial  is a 
randomized trial designed to compare the relative efficacy  of three regional corticosteroids  
commonly utilized  for the initial regional treatment of uveitic macular edema, periocular 
triamcinolone (Kenalog
® , Bristol -Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) , intravitreal  
triamcinolone (Triesence™, Alcon Pharmaceuticals, Fort W orth, TX) , and the intravitreal  
dexamethasone implant  (Ozurdex®, Allergan, Irvine CA ).   The design outcome is the percent 
change in central subfield macular thickness on OCT from baseline to the 8 week visit.  Follow -
up through 24 weeks will allow evaluation of the duration of response and the need for additional injections.  Secondary outcomes include resolution of macular edema, IOP elevation, 
visual acuity, complications of treatment, and cos t-effectiveness .

1.6. Background and significance 
Macular edema (ME) is the most common structural complication and cause of visual 
impairment and legal blindness in patients with uveitis.1-3 In a retrospective study from two 
uveitis referral centers in the Netherlands in the early 1990s, 40% of patients with intermediate 
uveitis, posterior uveitis, or panuveitis had ME, and it was the most common cause of visual 
loss among all patients with uveitis, accounting for 41% of visual impairment.3 In the Multicenter 
Uveitis Steroid Treatment (MUST) Tria l, ME was present in approximately 40% of eyes with 
uveitis with a similar frequency for patients with intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis .

anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors and methotrexate (MTX).
11, 14-[ADDRESS_823972] is often variable with a 
limited duration.18, 19 Pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) and PPV in combination with intravitreal 
corticosteroids have been investigated as treatment options for inflammatory ME unresponsive to medical therapy; however, the impact of this intervention is not yet clear.
20, [ADDRESS_823973] on visual function underscores the need to identify effective alternative medical therapeutic options. 
 
The pathophysiology of ME associated with uveitis is thought to be a consequence of increased vascular permeability from mediators released by [CONTACT_619708], retina, and retinal pi[INVESTIGATOR_43698] (RPE) cells with subsequent accumulation of fluid into the macula, characteristically distributed in the outer plexiform layer of 
the retina.

22, 23 Models of experimental 
autoimmune uveoretinitis in rats and studies in humans with uveitis and ME show an increased 
concentration of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the aqueous humor.24-27 VEGF is 
suspected to play a role in the loss of vascular integrity in the eye and is known to be induced by [CONTACT_15457], such as interleukin (IL) -[ADDRESS_823975] included the use of regional

increased.45 A study from the Johns Hopkins Medical Institution of 126 patients (156 eyes) with 
uveitic ME who received a single periocular injection of corticosteroid reported clinical resolution of ME among 53% and 57% of eyes at 1 month and 3 months respectively. 
46 Of the 83 eyes 
that had resolution of ME at 1 month, 50 (60%) had no recurrence of the ME at [ADDRESS_823979] injection.   Of the 21 
eyes treated with a second periocular injection, 81% and 43% had no ME at one and 3 months , 
respectively , after the second injection.   Overall, a 3- line improvement in visual acuity was 
observed in 52% at one month and in 57% at 3- months.   Side effects attributed to periocular 
corticosteroid injections included IOP rise to >30 mm of Hg in 19% (rate = 0.14/eye- year [EY]), 
newly diagnosed cataract in 10% (rate = 0.13/EY), and ptosis in 14% (rate = 0.09/EY).

 and 0.35mg) has been recently reported from the HURON study, a large, 26 week, phase III, 
prospective, multicenter, masked, sham -controlled randomized clinical trial among 229 patients 
with no ninfectious intermediate or posterior uveitis.68  Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive 
either a high dose dexamethasone  (0.7mg) implant, low dose dexamethasone (0.35mg) implant, 
or sham injections.  While both implant doses were shown to be effective in controlling vitreous 
inflammation and in improving visual acuity, the higher dose implant proved to have a longer duration of action without a significant increase in untoward ocular side -effects and is the dose 
currently in clinical use.   Vitreous haze scores of zero were achieved in 47% and 36% of the 
high and low dose implants respectively as compared with 12% among sham treated eyes at 8 
weeks, a benefit which persisted among the high dose group to 26 weeks when compared to 
sham.  At 8 weeks, 43% of treated eyes versus 7% in the sham group had at least a 15 letter 
improvement from baseline BCVA while the proportion of eyes achieving this level was 2- to 6- 
fold greater in the dexamethasone implant groups as compared to the sham group throughout 
the study period.  The central macular thickness as measured by [CONTACT_7349] 
(OCT) was significantly lower at weeks 8 and 26 in both dexamethasone  implant groups 
compared to baseline but not statistically different among the sham group.  While the mean 
reduction in macular thickness from baseline was significantly greater in the dexamethasone 
implant  treated eyes at week 8, this was not sustained at week 26.   The percentage of eyes with 
IOP ≥25 mm Hg peaked at 7.1% for the high dose implant, 8.7% for the low dose implant, and 
4.2% for the sham group with the ≤ 23% of eyes in the high dose group requiring antiglaucoma 
medication and none requiring surgical intervention.   Likewise, at [ADDRESS_823987] between treatment groups (15% high dose, 12% low dose, 7% sham) with no patient requiring surgery.  
 
Subsequent small, retrospective case series confirm the safety and efficacy of the 
dexamethasone implant in eyes with noninfectious posterior uveitis with an improved 
inflammatory activity, visual acuity and a reduction in mean central retinal thickness; however, the durability of the effect may be shorter (3- 4 months) in clinical practice than that reported in 
the HURON trial and require repeated injections.
69-[ADDRESS_823988] measure somewhat different aspects of macular edema, vascular 
leakage and retinal thickness, respectively.  Although the two methods correlate, the correlation 
is moderate, as compensated leakage may not result in thickening, and thickening may occur 
without  evident leakage.
4  Of the three methods (OCT, fluorescein angiography, clinical 
examination), clinical examination is least likely to detect macular edema.4  Visual acuity loss 
correlates better with retinal thickness than with the two- dimensional area of  leakage.73  Even

comparative measure may be adequate to evaluate relative efficacy.  Somewhat longer -term 
follow -up (e.g. 6 months) will be needed to evaluate the duration of response and the need for 
additional injections.  The POINT Trial was designed to compare  the relative efficacy of 
periocular triamcinolone, intravitreal triamcinolone, and intravitreal  dexamethasone as the initial  
regional approach to treatment of macular edema using central  subfield  macular thickness on 
OCT as the primary outcome measure with assess ment of the relative efficacy  at 8 weeks  and 
evaluation of the duration of response and the need for additional injections over 24 weeks of follow -up.

2. Objective and study hypothesis  
 
2.1. Objective 
To evaluate the relative efficacy of three commonly utilized regional corticosteroids for  the 
regional treatment of uveitic macular edema:  periocular triamcinolone acetonide; intravitreal  
triamcinolone acetonide; intravitreal dexamethasone implant.   The primary efficacy measure will 
be percent change in central subfield thickness as measured by [CONTACT_214627] 8 weeks. Participants 
will continue in the study for 24 weeks in order to evaluate relative effects of the 3 treatm ent 
strategies on the duration of treatment effects, requirement for additional  injections, and adverse 
effects.  
 
 
2.2. Hypothesis 
  Primary hypotheses:  
(1) Intravitreal triamcinolone injections will have greater efficacy than periocular 
triamcinolone as a treatment for uveitic macular edema. 
(2) Intravitreal injections of the dexamethasone pellet  will have greater efficacy than 
periocular triamcinolone injections as a treatment for uveitic macular edema. 
(3) Intravitreal injections of the dexamethasone pellet will be non-inferior to intravitreal 
triamcinolone as a treatment for uveitic macular edema. 
  Secondary hypothesis:  
(1) Intravitreal injections of the dexamethasone pellet will have a lower rate of IOP elevation 
than intravitreal triamcinolone injections  over the 24 weeks of follow -up.

assignment result in real time.  Receipt of treatment assignment will be confirmed by [CONTACT_619716] -
entry of the treatment assignment.  Beginning at this point, the patient’s  data will be included for 
primary analyses, regardless of subsequent actual treatment and/or extent of adherence to 
therapy. Randomization will be accomplished using an auditable, documented scheme generating a reproducible order of assignment. Randomization schedules will be developed by

 4. Study treatment  schedule and administration  
 
 
4.1. Treatment overview  
• The timing and administration of initial injections and earliest permissible second injections of assigned treatment are specified by [CONTACT_760].  Treatment administration 
instructions and pre- injection  IOP criteria are included in sections 4.2 and 4.3. 
• Additional guidance is provided for treatment of non- responders and simultaneous 
enrollment  of eligible patients in the  MERIT Trial at certain  time points .  
• The protocol  does not prescribe treatment options for every situation  
• Treatment according to the best medical judgment of treating study ophthalmologist is  
permitted as deemed necessary.  Repeat injections given before the protocol specified 
time points  (section 3.3.) or other deviations from the treatment protocol should be 
reported expeditiously to CC on Unanticipated Event (UA) form, usually within a few days.    
  
4.2. Treatment schedule  
 
4.2.1. Initial injections of assigned treatment  
• Patients will be randomized to receive an injection of one of three treatments; doses and 
routes of administration are those standardly used in clinical care:   
- Triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg given by [CONTACT_619718]  
- Triamcinolone acetonide 4 mg given by [CONTACT_619719]  
- Intravitreal placement injection of  the 0.7 mg dexamethasone implant  
• Injection of assigned treatment should be given on the day of randomization or as soon 
after randomization as possible 
• IOP requir ements for injec tion of initial study treatment must be met on the day the 
treatment is administered : 
-   ≤21 or mm Hg and treatment  
-  ≤ 3 IOP -lowering agents  (combination meds, e.g., Cosopt, count as 2 agents)  
 
Note that the IOP requirements for the initial injection are the same as for eye eligibility 
for the trial. If study treatment is initiated on the same day as eligibility is confirmed and 
treatment assigned, no additional IOP measurements are needed. If circumstances 
require patient to return to clinic for injection at a later date, IOP must be checked and 
IOP-lowering agents evaluated prior to  injection.  If the eligibility requirements are not 
met, the injection should not be given.  If the treating ophthalmologist elects to proceed

A serious adverse event (SAE) is an adverse event that results in one of the following 
outcomes: death, a life- threatening adverse drug experience, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8448], a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or congenital anomaly/birth defect. Also, important medical events that may not result in death, 
be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse event 
when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may  jeopardize the patient or subject 
and may require medical or surgical intervention (treatment) to prevent any of the outcomes previously listed in this definition.  
 Clinical centers will report a ll SAEs  to the Coordinating Center expeditiously  regardless  of the 
relationship to study  treatment.  When an investigator or clinical center staff member becomes 
aware of an SAE , it will be reported to the Coordinating Center (CC)  within [ADDRESS_824002]  officer,  the FDA, the pharmaceutical supplier  (where appropriate),  
and all clinical centers in accordance with FDA regulations.  The CC  and clinical centers  will 
submit  all safety  reports  as expedi ted reports  to their IRBs.   Reports  of SAEs not deemed  to be 
unexpected will be submitted to the CC’s  IRB, to the IRB of the clinical center in which  the 
event was  reported,  as well as to any other  study  center  IRBs  which  require such re ports.

 6. Sample size and statistical methods  
The primary outcome measurement for the POINT Trial is percent change from baseline in 
retinal thickness at 8 weeks.  The primary analysis will be based on the assigned treatment 
and all randomized individuals will be included in the analysis (intention- to-treat) with 
additional sensitivity analyses based on treatment received.  Individuals will be randomized to treatment groups, i.e., all eligible eyes from an individual will receive the same treatment.  
  
6.1. Sample size, power and detectable differences 
The units of analysis for the primary outcome for POINT are eyes as opposed to individuals .  
Since we expect approximately 25% of individuals to have bilateral disease, our sample size 
calculations take advantage of the information from both eyes by [CONTACT_619723], multiple measurements from the same individual.  To arrive at the target sample 
sizes, we first calculated the number of independent eyes needed to power a specific aim (i.e. 
act as though each participant had only one study eye) and then used the following 
adjustment to calculate the required number of individuals:  
 
 NS = NIE * [(1 + r)/ (2*p + (1+r)(1 -p))] 
 
where NS denotes the required number of individuals, N IE denotes the number of independent 
eyes, p denotes the percentage of individuals with bilateral disease (and so two study eyes), 
and r denotes the correlation between eyes86. Estimates for the correlation (r) between 
outcome measurements f or an individual are based upon preliminary data from the MUST 
Trial and FS.  
 
Power calculations for the primary hypotheses are based upon pair -wise comparisons of the 
three treatment arms: intravitreal injection of triamcinolone, dexamethasone pellet, and periocular injection of triamcinolone.  A Bonferroni correction will be used to adjust for multiple comparisons, i.e. a two- sided type I error rate of 0.05/3 = 0.[ZIP_CODE] will be used to determine 
statistical significance.  The sample sizes needed to provide 90% power for the superiority hypotheses (intravitreal injection or dexamethasone pellet versus periocular injection) and 80% 
power for the non- inferiority hypothesis (intravitreal injection versus dexamethasone pellet) were 
computed separately for each comparison and then the maximum sample size was selected.  
The primary outcome is the change in retinal thickness at the central subfield at 8 weeks.  Given 
the skewness in the distribution of retinal thickness, a log- transformation will be used to analyze 
the primary outcome
74, 87; hence, the comparisons will be represented on a relative scale (i.e. 
percent of baseline) and transformed to obtain the percent change from baseline.   A 20% 
change in retinal thickness is associated with clinically meaningful changes in visual acuity.[ADDRESS_824003] Trial, approximately 25% of individuals had bilateral macular edema and the 
correlation between- eyes was 0.[ADDRESS_824004] Trial; a conservative estimate since the treatment of macular edema was not standardized and the timing of the 
assessment, at [ADDRESS_824005] Trial, we allow ed for 
a 10% loss to follow -up. 
For the first two superiority hypotheses, we evaluated the power to show that each of the 
treatment methods for intravitreal corticosteroids (triamcinolone injections and dexamethasone pellets) is superior to periocular triamcinolone injections  at 8 weeks .  In previous studies, 
treatment with the dexamethasone pellet has resulted in a decrease in retinal thickness of 30%-
POINT PROTOCOL VERSI ON 2.1 (16 FEB  2017)  Sample size and statistical methods  │ 31 
 
P:\Doc\MUST \POINT \protocol \17 02 16_2.1 \17 02 16 POINT protocol 2 1.docx  
 50%, so a 40% decrease or log change in retinal thickness of log (0.60) = -0.[ADDRESS_824006] a similar level of improvement; whereas periocul ar 
triamcinolone is expected to have a smaller but clinically meaningful change, i.e. a 25% 
reduction or log change of log(0.75) = -0.2877.  Based upon a standard deviation of log- retinal 
thickness of 0.33, a sample size of 89 independent eyes per treatment group, i.e. 89 individuals with one eye for each individual, provides 98% power to detect a 40% reduction in retinal thickness for an intravitreal corticosteroid treatment as compared to a 25% reduction for 
periocular triamcinolone at 8 weeks with a two -sided type I error rate of 0.[ZIP_CODE] (i.e. 0.05/3).  
This number increases to 99 individuals after inflating it for a 10% loss to follow -up.  By [CONTACT_619724] (assuming a between 
eye correlation of 0.4 and 25% bilateral disease), we can reduce our sample size to 89 individuals enrolled in each arm (267 total).  That is, [ADDRESS_824007] hypothes is, we evaluated the power to show that the dexamethasone pellet is non-
inferior to injected triamcinolone. Previous research has indicated that the threshold for reproducibility is 10% and that a 20% change is associated with changes in visual acuity
.74, 88 
Therefore, we chose a non- inferiority margin of 10%, i.e. we would consider the dexamethasone 
pellet to be non -inferior if the percent reduction in retinal thickness was 30% or more (log [0.7]) 
as opposed to a 40% (log [0.60]) in the intravitreal injection group, i.e. the difference in the log 
retinal change was at most 0.15 (log[0.7] – log[0.6]) .  A sample size of 89 independent eyes per 
treatment group will provide 80% power to demonstrate non -inferiority with a one -sided type I 
error rate of 0.[ZIP_CODE].  We would reject the null hypothesis of inferiority if the upper bound of the 96.7% confidence interval of the difference in log retinal change from baseline at 8 weeks was 
less than 0.15 (log[0.7] – log[0.6]) or equivalently if the ratio of the percent of baseline for the 
two groups was less than 1.16 (0.7/0.6).  Assuming a between- eye correlation of 0.4, 25% 
bilateral disease, and a 10% loss to follow -up, we will need to enroll 89 individuals in each 
treatment arm to attain 80% power, i.e. the inclusion of both eyes for bilateral disease off -sets 
the sample size inflation necessary to account for losses to follow -up. 
An important secondary outcome for the comparison of intravitreal triamcinolone injection versus the dexamethasone pellet will be change in IOP .  In prior studies, treatment with 
intravitreal triamcinolone resulted in IOP elevation for 40% of study eyes.
33, [ADDRESS_824008] been more variable but consistently lower, ranging from 5% to 17%.
62, 68 A sample size of 89 independent eyes per treatment group, which 
is equivalent to 89 individuals per arm allowing for bilateral disease and losses to follow -up, will 
provide 99% power to detect an increase in the percent of eyes with an IOP elevation from 12% 
in the dexamethasone pellet arm to 40% in the intravitreal triamcinolone injection arm with a [ADDRESS_824009] triamcinolone injection 
resulted in clinical improvement for 50 -55% of eyes between one and three months.30, 46 
Intrav itreal triamcinolone and the dexamethasone pellet are expected to result in improvements 
of 35% and 25%, respectively.  Based upon the assumptions outlined above, the sample size of 
[ADDRESS_824010] an increase from 50% to 
85% or 75% with 99.9% or 93% power, respectively, assuming a 2- sided type I error rate of 0.05 
for this important secondary outcome.

Evaluation of continuous outcomes over time (such as log change in retinal thickness or best 
corrected visual acuity) and binary outcomes over time (such as normal/abnormal IOP) will use 
a repeated measures analysis with Gaussian or logit links that account for the nested 
correlations between observations over time and between eyes of the same patient.[ADDRESS_824012] -order, auto- regressive process (an AR(1) model) along with a 
random intercept, will be considered if the unstructured covariance model is unstable.  This 
struc ture allows for correlation to decrease with increasing time- separation down to a level set 
by [CONTACT_464881].  
Significance for superiority hypotheses in POINT will be determined by [CONTACT_17921] p -value of 
the interaction term for the week 8 visit with 0.[ZIP_CODE] (i.e. 0.05/3).  Significance for the non -
inferiority hypothesis in POINT will be assessed by [CONTACT_619725] 96.7% 
confidence intervals for estimate of the difference in change in log retinal thickness  at 8 weeks , 
which is esti mated by [CONTACT_941] 8 -week interaction term, with the defined non-inferiority boundary  of  
0.15 on the log scale, which is equivalent to a 10% difference in percent reduction (40% vs 30% 
reduction) for the two groups.    
Evaluation of risk factors for time-to-event outcomes such as incidence of cataracts, as well as 
time to remission will be performed using Cox proportional hazards regression as well as 
parametric time -to-failure models, such as gamma models
91. Implementatio n of these models 
that allows for clustering (within patients and within eyes), assessment of recurrent events, and 
incorporation of time -dependent covariates  will be used .  When the relevant follow -up time in the 
analysis reflects the clinical time scale (e.g. time since diagnosis of uveitis), it is necessary to 
incorporate the prevalent cases (longstanding diagnosis of uveitis) into the analysis.  To 
accommodate the prevalent cases we will use the staggered entry technique92, which is one 
method of adjusting for potential survival bias.  The analysis compares the event rates among 
patients with similar duration of disease and then combines over these comparisons.  Event 
rates for multiple recurring events, e.g. the number of adverse events, will be modeled using Poisson regression or Negative Binomial regression
93, including a random effects term to 
account for the between eye correlation.   
All analyses will be performed both unadjusted, except for the stratification variable, and 
adjusted for potential confounders.  Effect modification due to factors such as disease location 
or uveitis activity, fluorescein leakage in the centeral subfield, systemic disease, gender and 
race also will be explored when appropriate.  Robust standard errors will be computed using statistical program -based approaches when available and a bootstrap with the individual as the 
sampling unit, when a pre- programmed approach is not available.  
POINT has a focused set of primary research questions and related analyses.  Bonferonni corrections will be applied to control the type I error rates for the primary hypotheses within each 
study.  However, a large number of comparisons are planned for secondary outcomes and 
caution is needed in the reporting of interpretation of the results.  Our primary focus for analyses of these outcomes will be on the parameter estimates and confidence intervals as opposed to p-
values as recommended by [CONTACT_38874]
94. Several methods of adjusting P- values for multiple 
comparisons exist, however no clear consensus as to the most appropriate method is available 
and it is difficult if not impossible to quantify ahead of time the number of comparisons that will 
be performed.  In general, issuing cautions is sufficient, but for identifiable and related sets of

P:\Doc\MUST \POINT \protocol \17 02 16_2.1 \[ADDRESS_824013], ‘best’ and ‘worst’ case single imputation techniques will be implement.  In addition,  more sophisticated 
approaches  (e.g. multiple imputation and pattern mixture ) will also be used to assess the impact 
of missing data
95, 96.  For the principal sensitivity analysis, we will retain all features of the 
primary analysis other than how missing values for visits beyond the last one with a measured 
value are handled.  As is implicit in the primary analysis where missing data indicators are used 
(e.g. “.” in SAS, “NA” in R), we will treat all missing values  as Missing at Random (MAR).  We 
will impute other missing values to generate 10 pseudo- complete records for each such 
individual by [CONTACT_461835] a joint predictive distribution for the missing data given the observed 
data.  We will use a covariance matrix equal to the estimated covariance matrix from the primary 
analysis, but will “take control” of the prediction mean.  Varying the mean of the predictive 
distributio n allows us to assess the sensitivity of our results to a variety of missing data 
scenarios.  The pattern mixture model approach stratifies participants on their pattern of missing data, estimates stratum -specific parameters and then combines estimates over strata using 
inverse variance weights.  The approach is similar to stratified analysis to adjust for potential 
confounders and allows for comparison of stratum -specific estimates.  We stratify by [CONTACT_619726]: complete data, at least one internal measurement missing, and closeout weight missing (along with any other missingness).

 7.2.3. Inclusion of children  
Patients  under  18 years  of age will not be included; the intravitreal dexamethasone pellet is not 
approved for use in pediatric patients. 
 
7.2.4. Data and safety monitoring  
Treatment effects  and safety  monitoring will be conducted by a study Data and Safety 
Monitoring Committee (DSMC).   The DSMC will consist mostly of members of the standing 
DSMC , which monitored the Multicenter Uveitis Steroid Treatment (MUST) Trial and now is 
monitoring the MUST Follo w-up Study.  However, the Chair of the MUST DSMC, who is a 
biostatistician, is unable to serve because of potential conflicts of interest.  Hence a new 
biostatistician has been appointed and the Chair of the DSMC for this protocol will be one of the clinic al experts.  The committee consists of voting members  with expertise in biostatistics, 
clinical trial design, ophthalmology, and medical ethics who were appointed by [CONTACT_15496]-
voting members (i.e., Study Officers).  Initially, the DSMC will meet  at least  twice a year, once 
in-person and once by [CONTACT_15498].   For each DSMC meeting,  data will be  summarized in a 
report prepared by [CONTACT_122456].    These reports will include information related to monitoring the 
safety and effectiveness of the study treatments and will include tables and graphs that summarize baseline,  outcome, and adverse event  data by [CONTACT_15500], and if 
indicated, within specific subgroups .  Analyses will be included as  requested by [CONTACT_6802].  
Pertinent information from outside sources such as a reprint of a recent publication reporting on 
results of other, related studies  will also be included as available. The DSMC report will also 
include an overall study performance report, designed for monitoring the effectiveness of the particip ating centers.   
 
The DSMC Safety Officer will be appointed from among the physician voting members of the 
DSMC, who periodically will review summaries of serious adverse event data prepared by [CONTACT_619734] a determination as to whether the event is unexpected 
and possibly related to treatment.

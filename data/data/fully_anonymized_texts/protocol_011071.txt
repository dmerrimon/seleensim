1.0 PROTOCOL SUMMARY AND/OR SCHEMA 
 
This is a single-arm, Phase II study of regorafenib in combination with 5-Fluorouracil, Leucovorin 
and Oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) as first line therapy in patients with metastatic esophagoga stric 
adeno carcinoma. 
 
Primar y Objective: To determine the six months progression free survival (PFS) in the first-line 
treatment of patients with metastatic or unresectable esophagoga stric  adeno carcinoma. With a 
total  of  [ADDRESS_415639]  80%  power  to  detect  an 
improvement in the 6-month progression free survival (PFS) from a historical control of  40% to 
61% with type I error rate of 5%. 
 
Secondary Objective: To determine overall survival (OS), response rate, toxicity rates in the 
first-line treatment of patients with metastatic or unresec table esophagoga stric adenocarcinoma. 
 
Study popul ation: Patients with newly diagnosed metastatic or unresectable esophagoga stric 
adeno carcinoma. Patients must be untreated for metastatic esophagoga stric adeno carcinoma, 
except for perioperative therapy > 6 months prior to recurrence. 
 
Study design: Single institution, open-label, non-randomized, single-arm phase II 
 
Number of patients: 36 
 
Study drugs: Regorafenib, administered orally 
 
Dose and regimen:   Regorafenib 160 mg daily on days 4 to 10 and days 18 to 24 as four 40 mg 
coprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_336421] + mFOLFOX on Day 1 and Day 15 of each cycle. Each cycle consists of 28 
days. Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis.  All patients will receive systemic 
chemotherapy with the mFOLFOX regimen and regorafenib. There are several variations of the 
basic FOLFOX regimen. The specific version of the FOLFOX regimen used at MSKCC is 
mFOLFOX6. mFOLFOX6 will be given on Day 1 of each cycle.  Patients will receive Oxaliplatin 
85 mg/m2 IV (over 120 minutes), leucovorin 400 mg/m2 IV (over 120 minutes), 5-FU 400 mg/m2 
IVP, and 5-FU 1200 mg/m2/day CIVI x 2 days, every two weeks.  Treatment will be performed on 
the schedule d day ± 7 days.  In case of discontinuation of FOLFOX due to cumulative toxicity and 
administration as a single agen t during the study, regorafenib for patient convenience will be 
administered 160 mg daily for 3 weeks on/1 week off.  The 3 weeks on/[ADDRESS_415640].

3.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
 
3.1 Esophagogastric cancer 
 
In the [LOCATION_002], approximately  21,600 and 17,990 new cases  of gastric  and esophagea l 
cancer respectively are diagnosed annually with ~26,200 deaths attributable to the disease.1  For 
locally advanced disease, outcome hinge s on the ability to achieve complete resection and 
multidisciplina ry treatment approaches include perioperative systemic chemotherapy and/or 
radiotherapy.  Most esophag ogastric  cancers are locally advanced at the time of diagno sis, with 
the overall 5-year survival rate for distant or metastatic disease of ~ 3%.[ADDRESS_415641] aggressive regimen, median survival is only 9.2 months.2 
 
3.2 5-Fluo rouracil, Leucovorin and Oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) in esophagogastric cancer 
 
In advanced esophag ogastric cancer, 5-fluoruracil has been the cornerstone of chemotherapy 
regimens and as a single agen t results in response rates of 20-30%.[ADDRESS_415642] shown that 
when 5-fluorouracil is combined with other cytotoxics, there is a significant improvement in 
response rate and time to progression at the expense of increased toxicity.4  The addition of 
docetaxel to cisplatin and 5-flurouracil has demonstrated an improved overall survival in 
advanced esophag ogastric cancer patients (9.2 vs 8.6 months).[ADDRESS_415643] demonstrated similar outcomes when 
compared to other reference regimens in advanced esophago gastric cancer. 5-9  The substitution 
of oxaliplatin for cisplatin has been shown to be non-inferior in terms of overall survival, with 
significantly less grade 3 and 4 neutropenia , neph rotoxicity, nausea, renal toxicity, 
thromboembolism and alope cia. 5,10,11Aproximately 40% of the FOLFOX-treated patients were 
progression free at [ADDRESS_415644] improved median PFS and overall survival with 
5FU/Oxaliplatin versus 5FU/Cisplatin (5.8 v 3.9 months, respectively; P= .077) and  (10.7 v 8.8 
months, respectively). 5 
 
FOLFOX is well tolerated, has proven activity in advanced esopha gogastric cancer12  and is safe in 
combination with other biologic agen ts. The tolerability and safety of mFOLFOX in 
esophagoga stric cancer is well established and compares favorably to 5-Fu/Cisplatin 
regimen.5,13,14  This regimen is increasingly used as a chemotherapy backbone in studies exploring 
novel biologic agen ts (e.g.  NC I 8376 rando mized Phase II study in gastric and gastroesophage al 
junction cancer of FOLFOX +/- hedgeho g inhibitor GDC 0449 ). 
 
Because there are preliminary safety data combining regorafenib with FOLFOX in colon cancer, 
a phase I study is not required (Bayer data on file). FOLFOX is a well tolerated, effective regimen

3.[ADDRESS_415646] therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].15   Furthermore regorafenib provides a significant 
improvement in progression-free survival compared with placebo in patients with metastatic 
gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) after progression on standa rd treatments with imatinib and 
sunitinib.[ADDRESS_415647] (data 
described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
 
 
Regorafenib, the first small-molecule multi-kinase inhibi tor with proof of efficacy in colorectal 
cancer15, is being studied in 1st  line setting in colorectal cancer combination with FOLFOX  and has 
a potential for new standa rd of care in patients with advanced esophagoga stric cancer. MSKCC 
investigators have a track record over several decades in performing such trials, including two 
multicenter studies evaluating bevacizumab in metastatic disease.17,18    There is a clear rationale to 
study more than one VEGF targeted agen t in esophage al cancer, as has been indicated by 
[CONTACT_336441][INVESTIGATOR_336423] t sorafenib in 2nd/3rd  line setting in patients with metastatic esophagoga stric cancer. The 
phase II study of single agent sorafenib in patients with metastatic esophagoga stric cancer 
finished accrual at MSKCC (IRB# 09-016, Janjigian et al manuscript in preparation).  Patients 
receive sorafenib 400mg daily BID x [ADDRESS_415648] line setting until disease 
progression or unacceptable toxicity or serious intercurrent illness. The primary endpoi nt of the 
trial is to assess progression free survival (PFS). Seconda ry endpoin ts include response and 
therapy tolerance.  Thirty-five patients have been accrued, with 34 evaluable; median number of 
prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] 2. One (3%) ongoing complete response (40+ months) was observed in a patient 
with Stage IV esophagea l adeno carcinoma biopsy proven metastatic neck lymphadenopa thy, 
recurrence after prior chemoradiotherapy and surgery. A second patient with GE junction 
adeno carcinoma had protracted stable disease in bulky celiac node disease (26+ months).  23 
patients (68%) had stable disease. Median PFS is 3.6 months (95% CI 1.8 to 3.9 months), with 
median overall survival 8.8 months (95% CI 5.9 to 11.1 months). Overall, sorafenib is well 
tolerated in this patient population. Significant grade 3 toxicities included hand foot reaction (3 
patients), rash (1 patient), dehydration (3 patients) and fatigue (2 patients). Twenty-seven of 33 
tumors (82%) tested positive for phospho-ERK by [CONTACT_336442]. 
 
Encouraging response and survival were observed in a phase II trial combinin g sorafenib with 
chemotherapy in patients with metastatic gastroesophagea l junction cancer.19  Forty-four 
chemotherapy-naïve patients with Eastern Coope rative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 
1, of whom 80% had metastatic disease and two thirds had poorly differentiated gastric or GEJ 
adeno carcinoma were enrolled. The treatment regimen was sorafenib 400 mg orally twice a day 
for 21 days, docetaxel 75 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1, and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 intravenou sly on 
day 1, repeated every 21 days. The primary end point was response rate to the combination. 
Toxicity, overall survival, and progression-free survival were assessed as seconda ry end points. 
Eighteen of the 44 eligible and treated patients showed partial responses (41%; 90% C I, 28% to 
54%). The median progression-free survival was 5.8 months (90% CI, 5.4 to 7.4 months). The 
median overall survival was 13.6 months (90% CI, 8.6 to 16.1 month). The major toxicity of this 
regimen was neutropenia , which reached grade 3 to 4 in 64% of patients. One patient 
experienced hemorrhage at the tumor site.

metastatic potential and aggressive tumor biolog y.20  Platelet-derived growth factor receptor 
(PDGFR) has a role in promoting angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastasis. Along with the 
fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), PDGFR regula tes the migration and adhe rence of 
pericytes and smooth muscle cells to endo thelial cells, providing suppo rt and stability to vessel 
walls. Chemotherapy potentiates the effects of targeted agents, as sugge sted by [CONTACT_336443] a recent Phase II study of sorafenib in combination with chemotherapy. 
Therefore the proposed study combines FOFLOX and regorafenib. 
 
3.3.[ADDRESS_415650] been achieved clinically.  In vivo models, regorafenib demonstrated anti- 
angioge nic activity in a rat tumor model, and inhibition of tumor growth as well as anti -metastatic 
activity in several mouse xenog raft models including some for human colorectal carcinoma.21
 
 
The rationale for the dose of regorafenib in this study is based upon the phase I data from 
Study 1165 0 (in which escalating doses from 10 mg to 220 mg per day of regorafenib was 
administered on a discontinuou s schedul e [3 weeks out of every 4]). Signs of antitumor 
activity were observed in subjects receiving doses from 60 mg to 220 mg per day on a 
discontinuou s schedul e (3 weeks out of every 4). However, of the 220 mg/day cohort, [ADDRESS_415651] of 12 on the 
160 mg/day cohort required such a dose reduction. Thus, based upon the efficacy and 
toxicity data, 160 mg was chosen as the dose for this study. 
Preliminary data from an ongoing phase I study, evaluating the safety, efficacy, and PK of 
regorafenib in combination with chemotherapy (mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIR I) in patients with 
metastatic CRC, suppo rt the feasibility of the combination therapy. From a clinical and PK 
perspective, the proposed combination of regorafenib with mFOLFOX6 (with 85 mg/m2 
oxaliplatin) is expected to be tolerable. A PK interaction is not expected.

In vivo, regorafenib exhibited anti-angiog enic and anti-proliferative effects in human colon and 
breast xenog rafts as demonstrated by a reduction in microvessel area, reduced Ki-67 staining , 
and reduced pERK1/2 staining in tissue sections from tumor xenog rafts, and dose-dependent

[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical experience 
 
Two phase III global randomized studies have evaluated the efficacy of regorafenib. [ADDRESS_415654] (Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with regorafenib or placebo after 
failure of standa rd therapy) trial is an international, multicenter, randomized, doubl e-blind, 
placebo-controlled study that enrolled [ADDRESS_415655] suppo rtive care (BSC) or placebo plus BSC. Treatment cycles consisted 
of 160 mg of regorafenib (or matching placebo) once daily for three weeks on / one week off plus 
BSC. The primary endpoin t of this trial was overall survival. Seconda ry endp oints included 
progression-free survival, objective tumor response rate and clinical benefit. The safety and 
tolerability of the two treatment groups were also compared. 
 
At a preplann ed second interim analysis, there was a statistically significant survival bene fit for 
regorafenib. The estimated hazard ratio for overall survival was 0.773 (95% confidence interval 
[CI], 0.635 to 0.941; 1-sided p = .0051). Patients treated with regorafenib had a median overall 
survival of 6.4 months, compared with 5.0 months for placebo — a 29% increase in survival. In 
addition to improved overall survival, progression-free survival was superior; median progression- 
free survival was 1.9 months (95% CI, 1.88 to 2.17) for regorafenib and 1.7 months (95% CI, 1.68 
to 1.74) for placebo. The estimated hazard ratio for progression-free survival was 0.493 (95% C I, 
0.418 to 0.581; 1-sided p< .000001 ). There was a substantial difference in disease control rate in 
the regorafenib and placebo groups (44% vs. 15%; p<.000001 ).  Regorafenib 
demonstrated comparable efficacy bene fits across patient subgroups analyzed including age, 
number of mets, number of lines of prior therapy, and KRAS status. 
 
The most freque nt grade 3+ adverse events in the regorafenib group were hand–foot skin 
reaction (17%), fatigue (15%), diarrhea (8%), hyperbilirubine mia (8%), and hypertension (7%). 
The efficacy and safety from the CORRECT study suppo rted FDA approval in September 2012 . 
The efficacy and safety of regorafenib were examined in the Phase III GRID trial in patients with 
gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) who had exhausted all other treatment options.16  The 
study involved 199 patients with metastatic and/or unresectable GIST that had become resistant 
to imatinib and sunitinib. Patients were rando mized 2:1 to regorafenib (160 mg orally once daily 
on a 3 weeks on/1 week off cycle) or placebo, plus best supportive care. 
 
The results showed that treatment with regorafenib led to a statistically significant 3.9-month 
improvement in progression-free survival (PFS), compared with placebo (4.8 months vs. 0.9 
months; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.27; p <.0001 ). Overall survival was statistically similar between 
groups as expected due to a trial design that allowed crossover to regorafenib for disease 
progression.  The median survival period without tumor growth among patients on regorafenib 
was 4.[ADDRESS_415656] 12 weeks 
was 53% with regorafenib compared with 9% in the control group. The most common grade ≥3 
adverse events associated with regorafenib were hand-foot skin reaction (56.1%), hypertension 
(48.5%), and diarrhea (40.9%).   The efficacy and safety of the GR ID study data suppo rted FD A 
approval February 2013. 
 
4.0 OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN/INTERVENTION 
 
4.1 Design 
 
This will be a single institution, single arm study of regorafenib 160 mg daily on days 4 to 10 and 
days 18 to 24 as four 40 mg coprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_336421] + FOLFOX on Day 1 and Day 15 of each cycle.

Each cycle consists of 28 days. Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis.  All 
patients will receive systemic chemotherapy with the FOLFOX regimen and regorafenib. There 
are several variations of the basic FOLFOX regimen. The specific version of the FOLFOX 
regimen used at MSKCC is mFOLFOX6. mFOLFOX6 will be given on Day 1 of each cycle. 
Patients will receive Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 IV (over 120 minutes), leucovorin 400 mg/m2 IV (over 
120 minutes), 5-FU 400 mg/m2 IVP, and 5-FU 1200 mg/m2/day CIVI x [ADDRESS_415657]. Treatment will be 
performed on the schedule d day ± 7 days.  In case of discontinuation of FOLFOX due to 
cumulative toxicity and administration as a single agen t during the study, regorafenib for patient 
convenien ce will be administered 160 mg daily for 3 weeks on/1 week off.  The 3 weeks on/[ADDRESS_415658] be able to provide informed consent prior to enrollment. 
See Section 10 for treatment table. 
4.2 Intervention 
 
Up to 36 patients will be enrolled on this clinical trial. Patients will receive regorafenib 160 mg daily 
on days 4 to 10 and days 18 to 24 as four 40 mg tablets + FOLFOX on Day [ADDRESS_415659] evaluable or 
measurable disease and will unde rgo a computerized tomography (CT) or magne tic resonan ce 
imaging (MRI) scan of the chest,  abdo men, and pelvis  within 28 days of start of therapy, at eight 
weeks, and every eight weeks thereafter (every 2 cycles), with a schedulin g window of up to one 
to fourteen (1-14) days. Response assessment will be by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 criteria22.The same imaging 
modali ty performed at baseline (CT or MRI) will be repeated at subsequen t imaging . Intrapatient 
dose reduction to regorafenib will be allowed depe nding on the type and severity of toxicity 
encountered provided that criteria for patient withdrawal from study treatment have not been met. 
Once regorafenib is dose reduced, the patient should not go back to the starting dose. In case of

5.0 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC AGENTS 
 
For dose modification and manage ment of adverse events see Section 11.0 
5.1  Regorafenib (Bay 73-4506)  
Regorafenib 40-mg tablets contains regorafenib and the inactive excipi[INVESTIGATOR_336424], croscarmellose sodium, magne sium stearate, povidone , colloidal anhydrous silica, 
polyvinyl alcohol-part hydrolyzed, talk, titanium dioxide E171 (color index [ZIP_CODE] ), Macrogol/PEG 
[ZIP_CODE] , lecithin (soy), iron oxide yellow – E172 (color index [ZIP_CODE] ), iron oxide red – E172. 
Regorafenib tablets will be packaged in high density polyethylene bottles with a white child 
resistant closure and induction seal.  Each bottle includes 30 tablets and a 3-gram desiccant.  The 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center  
IRB Number: 13 -080 A(4) 
Approval date: [ADDRESS_415661] be stored in its original bottle at a temperature not above 25°C (77°F). 
The study drug must be exclusively used for the investigation specified in this protocol and it will 
only be accessible to authorized staff. 
Dosage and administration 
Regorafenib will be provided by [CONTACT_336446] 40-mg tablets, which are coated, not divisible, gray- 
orange-red, oval (length 16 mm, width 7 mm, thickness 4.9-5.6 mm), and [ADDRESS_415662] conditions. 
Four 40-mg regorafenib tables should be taken in the morning with approximately 8 fluid ounces 
(240 mL) of water after a low-fat (<30% fat) breakfast.   Some examples of low fat breakfasts are: 
 
•   Two slices of white toast with 1 tablespoon of low-fat margarine and 1 tablespoon of jelly and 8 
ounces (240 mL) of skim milk (approximately 319 calories and 8.2 g of fat). 
 
•   One cup of cereal  8 ounces (240 mL) of skim milk, one pi[INVESTIGATOR_115082] (no butter or 
marmalade ), apple juice, and one cup of coffee or tea (2 g fat, 17 g protein, 93 g of 
carbohydrate, 520 calories.)Patients with emesis should not take a replacement dose. A study 
diary will be completed by [CONTACT_336447] 
(GCP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) requirements and the instructions given by [CONTACT_336448] s depa rtment of the Institution and will be inaccessible to unau thorized personnel . 
Accountability 
The investigator, or a responsible party designated by [CONTACT_093], must maintain a careful 
record of the inventory and disposition of the agent (investigational or free of charge) using the 
NCI Drug Accountability Record or another comparable drug ac countability form. (See the CTEP 
website at http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment  for the ―Policy and Guidelines for 
Accountability and Storage of Investigational Agents‖ or to obtain a copy o f the drug accountability 
form.) 
Destruction and Return 
At the end of the study, unused supplies of regorafenib (Bay 73-4506) should be destroyed 
according to institutional policies. Destruction will be documented in the Drug Accountability 
Record Form. The certificate of destruction should be sent to Bayer. 
A completed ―Unused Study Drug Disposition Form Destruction or Return Confirmation‖ should 
be sent to Bayer at the following address:

[ADDRESS_415663] may be discontinued from the trial for non-compliance with 
follow-up visits or study drug. 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center  
IRB Number: 13 -080 A(4) 
Approval date: [ADDRESS_415664]‘s welfare, and which is not expected to 
interfere with the evaluation of the study treatment, may be given at the discretion of the 
investigator.  All medications (including contrast media) taken within [ADDRESS_415665]‘s source documentation and in the 
CRD B (includin g start/stop dates, dose frequen cy, route of administration, and indication). 
Specific caution should be taken when considering or adm inistering a concomitant medication 
that is metaboli zed by [CONTACT_39705]2C8, CYP2B6 and CYP2C9.  Such 
concomitant medication should be avoided , if possible. 
 
There is no clinical information on the effect of CYP3A4 inhibitors on the PK of regorafenib. 
Substances that are inhibi tors of CYP3A4 activity such as ketoconazole are expected to decrease 
metaboli sm of regorafenib and thus increase regorafenib plasma concentrations.  There are no 
clinical data evaluating the effect of chronically coadministered CYP3A4 inhibitor on regorafenib 
efficacy.  Since there is a possibility of increased regorafenib toxicity upon chronic 
coadministration of CYP3A4 inhibitors with regorafenib, chronic coadministration of CYP3A4 
inhibi tors with regorafenib should be avoided , if possible. 
Permitted concomitant therapy includes: 
•   Standa rd therapi[INVESTIGATOR_39674]. 
•   Suppo rtive care for any unde rlying illness. 
•   Palliative radiation therapy is allowed if the target lesion(s) are not included with in the 
radiation field and no more than 10% of the bone marrow is irradiated. 
•   Granulo cyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and other hematopoietic growth factors may 
be used in the manage ment of acute toxicity, such as febrile neutropeni a, when clinically 
indicated or at the investigator‘s discretion. However, they may not be substituted for a 
required dose reduction. 
•   Treatment with nonconventional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (such as acupun cture), and vitamin/mineral 
supple ments are permitted provided that they do not interfere with the study endpoin ts, in 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]. 
•   Bisphosphona tes 
•   For subject receiving regorafenib in combination with chemotherapy consider addin g the 
following: 
o  A standa rd antiemetic regimen for the prophylaxis of acute emesis is recommende d 
on the day of chemotherapy at least 30 minutes prior to the administration of 
chemotherapy.  Such a regimen may include a serotonin (5-HT3) antagoni st (e.g. 
granisetron or ondan setron) with or without a corticosteroid (e.g. dexamethasone). 
The investigators should also consider providing subjects with a standa rd antiemetic 
regimen for treatment of delayed or breakthrough emesis as needed . 
5.2 5-FU, leucovorin and oxaliplatin 
 
Qualified personne l who are familiar with procedures that minimize undu e exposure to them and 
to the environment should undertake the preparation, handling, and safe disposal of 
chemotherapeutic agen ts in a self-contained , protective environment. 
The total administered dose of cytotoxic chemotherapy may be rounded up or down within a 
range of 5% of the actual calculated dose. 
It is not necessary to chang e the doses of 5-FU, leucovorin or oxaliplatin due to change s in weight 
unless the calculated dose change s by ≥10%. 
 
5.2.1 Oxaliplatin 
Oxalipla tin will prepared and administered as per MKSCC guideline s. Please refer to the FDA- 
approved package insert for additional information. 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center  
IRB Number: 13 -080 A(4) 
Approval date: [ADDRESS_415666] been seen: acute sensory neuropathy 
develops within hours to [ADDRESS_415667] also been noted. 
Acute sensory neuropathy symptoms may be exacerbated by [CONTACT_334886]. Symptoms are reversible, usually resolving within 14 days and commonly recurr ing 
with further dosing. This syndrome has been observed in abou t 56% of patients receiving 
oxaliplatin with 5-FU and leucovorin. 
Acute pharyngolaryngea l dysesthesia is reported to occur in 1-2% of patients. This syndrome is 
characterized by a subjective sensation of difficulty breathing or swallowing without laryngospasm 
or bronchospasm or objective evidence of hypoxia. Avoidan ce of cold drinks, food and air is 
sugge sted in order to minimize pharyngolaryngeal dysesthesia. Antianxiety agents (e.g., 
lorazepam) may be used to treat pharyngolaryngeal dysesthesias once oxygen saturation has 
been documented to be normal. 
Peripheral neuropathy persisting > [ADDRESS_415668] been used in an attempt to minimize neurotoxicity of oxaliplatin (e.g. 
carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] , Mg+, Ca++). Calcium and magne sium infusions appea r to be bene ficial in 
preventing neurotoxicity. Contrary to preliminary findings described in 2007 , calcium and 
magne sium do not appea r to interfere with tumor response to FOLFOX. Calcium and magne sium 
infusions are gene rally given before and after oxaliplatin, and should not be prepared in the same 
infusion solution as FOLFOX componen ts. 
Gastrointestinal toxicities include nausea, vomiting (oxaliplatin is considered to be moderately 
emetogeni c) and diarrhea. 
Neutropenia is reported in 73% of patients receiving oxaliplatin with 5-FU and leucovorin (44% 
grade 3 or 4). Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopeni a is reported to occur in 4% of patients receiving the 
combination. 
Allergic reactions, similar to those seen with other platinum compound s, have also been observed 
in patients treated with oxaliplatin. Reactions range from rash to anap hylaxis. 
Rarely, oxaliplatin has been associated with pulmonary fibrosis, which may be fatal. Oxaliplatin 
should be discontinued in the presence of unexplained pulmonary symptoms (e.g. nonproductive 
cough , dysphagia ) or pulmonary infiltrates until interstitial lung disease or pulmonary fibrosis have 
been ruled out. 
Recent reports of oxalipla tin extravasation sugge st that tissue necrosis may result and that 
oxaliplatin should be considered a vesicant. No standa rd treatment exists for oxaliplatin 
extravasation although heat and sodium thiosulfate have both been sugge sted. 
Veno-occlusive disease (VOD) of the liver is a rare complication associated with oxaliplatin and 5- 
FU. Clinical manifestations of VOD include hepa tomegaly, ascites, and jaundi ce. Histologi cally, 
VOD is characterized by [CONTACT_336449]. Sequela e of VOD 
include hepa tomegaly, spleno megaly, portal hypertension, and esopha geal varices. A rec ent 
analysis of resected liver metastases in 153 patients indicated histological findings consistent with 
VOD in 6/27 patients who received 5-FU alone, 4/17 patients who received 5-FU and irinotecan, 
20/27 patients who received 5-FU and oxaliplatin, and 14/16 who received 5-FU, oxaliplatin and 
irinotecan. The remaining 66 patients had not received chemotherapy prior to resection. There 
were no such finding s in these patients. 
For more information on toxicities associated with oxaliplatin, please see the pac kage insert.

5.2.2 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU; fluorouracil) 
 
5-FU will prepared and administered as per MKSCC guideline s. Please refer to the FDA- 
approved package insert for additional information. 
. 
Toxicity 
Nausea, diarrhea, vomiting (mild); stomatitis: 5-8 days after treatment initiation; 
myelosuppression: granulo cytopeni a (9-14 days); thrombocytopeni a (7-14 days); Alopecia; loss of 
nails; hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371]; photosensitivity; maculopapula r rash; palmar–plantar 
erythrodysesthesia: (42-82% receiving continuou s infusion); C NS effects: cerebral ataxia (rare); 
cardiotoxicity: MI, angin a; asymptomatic S–T change s 68%; ocular effects: excessive lacrimation 
and less commonly, tear duct stenosis. 
Drug Interactions 
Leucovorin enhances the cytotoxicity of 5-FU by [CONTACT_12789] a more stable tertiary complex with 
thymidylate synthase. Concomitant Adminstration of 5-FU with warfarin has been reported to 
result in increased INR/prolonged prothrombin time. Patients on warfarin should be converted to 
enoxaparin or rivaroxaban therapy. 
 
5.2.3 Leucovorin Calcium (Folini c Acid) (calcium folinate; citrovorum factor; N 5- 
formyltetrahydrofolate; 5-formyl-FH4; folini c acid) 
 
Leucovorin will beprepared and administered as per MKSCC guidel ines. Please refer to the FD A- 
approved package insert for additional information. 
 
Toxicity 
The only adverse reactions associated with leucovorin are allergic reactions. These are extremely 
uncommon.

7.0 RECRUITMENT PLAN 
 
This will be a single institution, phase II study. Patients with metastatic or recurrent esophageal , 
gastric and gastroesophagea l (GE) junction cancer that are eligible will be identified for enrollment 
from MSKCC clinical practice and clinic lists. All patients with metastatic or recurrent disease that 
have not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease will be offered the study. The study 
information will be posted on clinicaltrials.gov and the MSKCC website. No additional measures, 
e.g. advertisement, payment to patients, will be employed to recruit patients. Patients will be 
accrued to this study without regard for gender or minority status. 
 
Inclusion of women and minorities 
The investigators take due notice of the NIH policy concerning inclusion of women and minorities 
in clinical research popula tions. There will be no limitation with regards to race or gende r. 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center  
IRB Number: 13 -080 A(4) 
Approval date: [ADDRESS_415681] the national incidence of this disease: 10-15% of our patients have been 
women; African-American males comprise 3-5% of patients treated on protocol. Given that our 
protocol accrual closely reflects the national incidence of this disease, no specific strategy will be 
unde rtaken to recruit women or persons of color on this trial. 
 
This protocol does not include children because the number of children with esophageal, gastric 
and GE junction cancer is very small and because the majority are already accessed by a nation- 
wide pedia tric cancer research network. This statement is based on exclusion 4b of the NIH 
Policy and Guidelines on the Inclusion of Children as Participants in Research Involving Human 
Subjects. 
 
8.0 PRETREATMENT EVALUATION 
 
Pretreatment evaluation will be performed within 2 weeks (14 days) of study entry and will 
include: 
• History, concomitant medications, and toxicity assessment. 
• Physical exam, vital signs (blood pressure, weight, heart rate, temperature), and 
performance status. 
• Serum pregnan cy test for women of childbea ring potential (WOCP) 
In addition, all WOCP should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_176279] (e.g. late or missed period) at any time during study 
participation. 
• Labo ratory evaluation including complete blood count, and comprehensive chemistry 
panel (includes BUN, creatinine, ALT, AST, albumin, glucose, total protein, calcium,

The starting dose of regorafenib is 160 mg once daily on days 4 to 10 and days 18 to 24 as 
four 40 mg coprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_336421] + FOLFOX on Day 1 and Day 15 of each cycle. Each cycle 
consists of 28 days. In case of discontinuation of FOLFOX due to cumulative toxicity and 
administration as a single agen t during the study, regorafenib for patient convenience will be 
administered 160 mg daily for 3 weeks on/1 week off.  The 3 weeks on/[ADDRESS_415690]. 
 
Doses will be delayed or reduced for clinically significant hematologic and non-hematologic 
toxicities that are related to protocol therapy according to the guidelines shown in the Dose 
Delays/Dose Modifications table that follows.  Dose modifications will follow predefined dose 
levels. Dose adjustments for hematologic toxicity are based on the blood counts obtained in 
preparation for the day of treatment.

Hypertension 
 
Hypertension is a known AE associated with regorafenib treatment.  Subject will have their blood 
pressure measured  at MD visits weeks 1 to 3 and additional BP monitoring per investigator 
discretion.  If additional blood pressure measurements are done outside the study site, and the 
blood pressure is > 140 mm Hg systolic or > 90 mm Hg diastolic (NCI CTCAE v4.0), then the 
subject must contact [CONTACT_3462] .  The manage ment of hypertension, including the choice of 
antihypertensive medication, will be performed according to local standa rds and to the usual 
practice of the investigator.  Every effort should be made to control blood pressure by [CONTACT_336453].  If necessary, Table 11.1.4outlines sugge sted 
dose reductions. 
Liver Function Abnormalities 
For patients with observed worsening of serum liver tests considered related to regorafenib (i.e. 
where no alternative cause is evident, such as post-hepa tic cholestasis or disease progression), 
the dose modification and monitoring advice in Table below should be followed. 
 
Regorafenib is a UGT1A1 inhibi tor.  Mild, indirect (unconjuga ted) hyperbilirubinemia may 
occur in patients with Gilbert‘s syndrome.

Prevention/management strategies for diarrhea 
 
Diarrhea can be a common side effect of regorafenib (Bay 73-4506).  The same dose- 
modification algorithm used for skin toxicities can be used to address these toxicities.  However, 
the preventive/manage ment strategies for diarrhea should be consistent with local standa rds 
(e.g., anti-diarrheals and optimized hydration status). 
 
Anti-diarrhea medications may be introduced if symptoms occur.  Previous trials have shown that 
the diarrhea could be manage d with loperamide.  The recommende d dose of loperamide is [ADDRESS_415701] onset, followed by 2 mg every 2 to 4 hours until diarrhea-free for 12 hours. 
 
11.2 FOLFOX 
 
Initiation of the next cycle of therapy may be delayed by [CONTACT_23818] 4 weeks to allow recovery 
from toxicity.  Treatment delay of > 4 weeks due to toxicity may lead to removal from study. 
 
Dose reduction of oxaliplatin or 5-FU/folinic acid should be based on the worst toxicity 
demonstratedduring the preceding cycle.. Subjects who require more than [ADDRESS_415702] permanen tly discontinue either oxaliplatin, or 5-FU/folinic acid, or both depen ding 
on the specific toxicity.  Regorafenib may continue at investigator‘s discretion. 
 
If cycle start date is delayed due to toxicity related to FOFLOX, regorafenib will be held and 
resume on Day 4 of the cycle.  In case of discontinuation of FOLFOX due to cumulative toxicity 
and administration as a single agent during the study, regorafenib for patient convenience will be 
administered 160 mg daily for 3 weeks on/1 week off.

11.4 Definitions of Adverse Events. 
 
Adverse event 
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence, including an exacerbation 
of a pre-existing condition, in a patient in a clinical investigation who received a pharmaceutical 
product. The event does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. 
Serious adverse event 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any AE which results in death, is immediately life- 
threatening, results in persistent or significant disability / incapacity, requires or prolongs patient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], is a congen ital anomaly / birth defect, or is to be deemed serious for any other 
reason if it is an important medical event when based upon appropriate medical judge ment which

Approval date: 18 -Apr-2017  
Page 28 of 43  
  
 
 
may jeopa rdise the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes listed in the above definitions. 
 Severity of adverse event 
The severity of the AE should be judge d based on the following: 
The severity of adverse events should be classified and recorded according to the Common 
Terminolog y Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version [ADDRESS_415705] be recorded for each adverse event. 
 
Causality will be reported as either ―Yes‖ or ―No‖. 
 
Yes:  There is a reasonabl e causal relationship between the investigational product 
administered and the AE. 
No:  There is no reasonabl e causal relationship between the investigational product 
administered and the  AE. 
 
 
11.[ADDRESS_415706] one of the following criteria is met: 
−  Worsening of the disease constitutes an SAE, 
−  Additional treatment is required, i.e. concomitant medication is adde d or changed . 
−  An unexpected deterioration from baseline has occurred in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070]. 
 
11.6 Worsening of pre-existing condi tions 
 
A pre-existing condition present at baseline, which remains unchange d during the trial, does not 
need to be recorded as adverse event. Any worsening of any pre-existing baseline condition 
should be reported as an adverse event. Examples of worsening of a preexisting condition that 
should be recorded as an AE are given below; 
• Worsening of condition meets the criteria for an SAE 
• Action is taken with the investigational drug (i.e. dose is reduced or treatment is 
discontinued ) 
• Treatment is required (concomitant medication is adde d or changed ) 
• The investigator believes a patient has shown a clear deterioration from baseline 
symptoms 
 
 
12.0 CRITERIA FOR THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESS MENT 
 
All patients who receive at least one dose of FOLFOX and began regorafenib therapy will be 
evaluable for toxicity and response. Patients who are did not begin regorafenib therapy will not be 
evaluated for toxicity or response and will be replaced by a new patient. 
 
The primary endpoi nt of the study is the efficacy of the combination of FOLFOX and regorafenib 
in terms of progression free survival (PFS) at [ADDRESS_415707] overall 
clinical bene fit defined as stable disease (SD), complete response (CR), or partial response (PR). 
Confirmatory scans should be obtained no less than four weeks following initial documentation of 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center  
IRB Number: 13 -080 A(4) 
Approval date: [ADDRESS_415708] 1.1 criteria. The same imaging modali ty performed at baseline (CT or 
MR I) will be repea ted at subsequen t imaging . 
 
Seconda ry endpoi nts include toxicity, safety and tolerability. The type, frequency, severity, timing, 
and relationship of each adverse event will be determined as per the NC I Common Toxicity 
Criteria, version 4.0. Toxicity during cycle [ADDRESS_415709] 1.1 criteria. 
 
 
13.0  CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY 
 
If at any time the patient develops progressive disease he/she will be taken off study and referred 
for alternative therapy. If at any time the patient develops unacceptable toxicity that fails to 
resolve after a maximum treatment delay of 4 weeks, he/she will be removed from study. Before 
being removed from the study, patients will be scanne d to assess the response. If the off study 
scan shows progression of disease then the patient will be considered as a non responde r, while 
a CR or PR will be considered as response. 
 
A patient will be withdrawn from the study treatment in the following circumstances: 
 
● the patient is no longer able to participate in the study (e.g., AE, surgery, concomitant 
diagno ses, concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_336429]); in such a case the Investigator‘s 
reason for a patient‘s removal must be recorded in CRD B. 
● Patient withdrawal of consents or election to discontinue participation in the trial 
● Significant deviation from the protocol or eligibility criteria; such patients will be considered 
protocol violations and removed from study 
● Non-complian ce with study or follow-up procedures 
● Drug related AE(s) have not resolved after 4 weeks of treatment interruption. Exception to this 
in patients who derive obvious clinical benefit according to the investigator‘s judgment could be 
considered upon discussion with Principal Investigator. The dose reduction scheme provided 
should be followed in this case. 
● repea ted epi[INVESTIGATOR_336430] 11. 
● documented progressive disease 
 
As soon as a patient is withdrawn from the study treatment, the End of Treatment (EOT) visit 
has to be performed within 1-14 days after off study date. Every effort should be made to follow- 
up patients in case an adverse event has still ongoing at the time of withdrawal. Patients who 
show a clinical bene fit from treatment with regorafenib (i.e., with either an objective tumor 
response or the absence of disease progression), may continue to receive additional treatment 
courses. Patients with radiologi cally documented progressive disease should be removed from 
the study unless the investigator judges it to be of clinical bene fit for the patient to continue on trial 
therapy.

14.0  BIOSTATISTICS 
 
The primary endpo int is progression free survival (PFS), as measured from the start of the 
treatment to the date of either documentation of disease progression or death.  W e will define 
progression of disease as per RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_415716] single 
stage binomial design, we will accrue 36 Stage IV or unresectable esophagoga stric 
adeno carcinoma patients to differentiate between 6-month PFS of 40% and 61% with type I of 5% 
and power of 80%.  If 20 or more patients are progression free at 6 months, FOLFOX 
+Regorafenib will be considered worthy of further investiagaion.  Patients who come off study 
before 6 months without documented progression will be considered as events for the primary 
endpoin t of 6 months PFS. We anticipate enrollment to be 2-3 patients/ months with completion of 
accrual in approximately [ADDRESS_415717] to follow up or withdrew consent before 6 months without 
documented progression will be counted as events for the primary endpo int; however this is 
expected to be a rare occurrence. The patients who completed at least one cycle of FOFLOX and 
regorafenib will be considered evaluable.

study design includes early termination of the trial in the event of excessive grade 4+ 
neutropen ia, grade 3+ diarrhea despi[INVESTIGATOR_336431] (loperamide and 
diphen oxylate/atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) or grade 3+ neuropathy. In addition, the safety analysis will assess the

toxicity rates that may arise related to regorafenib of grade 4+ LFT abno rmality, grade 3 hand 
food syndrome (HFS)  (despi[INVESTIGATOR_336432]) or persistent grade 3+ 
hypertension despi[INVESTIGATOR_336433]. Furthermore, presence of grade 3+ 
events which in the clinical judgment of the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_336434], 
unexpected, and a side effect likely due to regorafenib, will give evidence to reduce the dose 
as well.  Only adverse events (possibly, probabl y, or definitely) related to the study treatment in 
the first 2 cycles (i.e. 8 weeks) will count towards the excessive toxicity bounda ries below. The 
stoppin g rules are derived using repeated significance testing are given in the table below. 
  
 
Seconda ry endpoi nts: Overall survival will be measured from the start of treatment to death or 
last follow-up and will be estimated using the Kaplan- Meier method. Response rate will be 
estimated using binomial proportions along with 95% confidence intervals. Toxicity will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics.

Weekly registration reports will be gene rated to monitor patient accruals and 
completeness of registration data. Routine data quality reports will be gene rated to assess 
missing data and inconsistencies. Accrual rates and extent and accuracy of evaluations 
and follow-up will be monitored periodically throughout the study period and potential 
problems will be brough t to the attention of the study team for discussion and action. 
Rando m-sample data quality and protocol compliance audits will be condu cted by [CONTACT_58860], at a minimum of two times per year, more frequen tly if indicated. 
 
16.2  Data and Safety Monitoring 
 
The Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) Plans at MSKCC were approved by [CONTACT_331125] 2001 . The plans address the new policies set forth by [CONTACT_293712] ―Policy of the National Cancer Institute for Data and Safety 
Monitoring of Clinical Trials‖ which can be found at: 
http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/dsm/index.html. The DSM Plans at MSKCC 
were established and are monitored by [CONTACT_30591]. The MSKCC Data 
and Safety Monitoring Plans can be found on the MSKCC Intranet at: 
http://mskweb2.mskcc.org/irb/index.htm 
 
There are several different mechanisms by [CONTACT_30592], 
safety and quality. There are institutional processes in place for quality assurance (e.g., 
protocol monitoring, complian ce and data verification audits, therapeutic response, and 
staff education on clinical research QA) and departmental procedures for quality control, 
plus there are two institutional committees that are responsible for monitoring the activities 
of our clinical trials programs. The committees: Data and Safety Monitoring Committee 
(DSMC) for Phase I and II clinical trials, and the Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
(DSMB) for Phase III clinical trials, report to the Center‘s Research Council and 
Institutional Review Board. 
 
During the protocol development and review process, each protocol will be assessed for 
its level of risk and degree of monitoring required. Every type of protocol (e.g., NIH 
sponsored, in-house sponsored, industrial sponsored, NCI coope rative group, etc.) will be 
addressed and the monitoring procedures will be established at the time of protocol 
activation.

Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center  
IRB Number: 13 -080 A(4) 
Approval date: [ADDRESS_415718] text should be used: 
 
 
Definition of adverse event (AE) 
 
In a clinical study, an AE is any untoward medical occurrence (i.e. any unfavorable and 
unintended sign [including abno rmal laboratory findings], symptom or disease) in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject after providing written informed consent for participation in the 
study.  Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product. 
 
A surgical procedure that was plann ed prior to the start of the study by [CONTACT_336455] (however, the condition for which the surgery is required may 
be an AE if worsens compared to baseline ). 
 
The clinical manifestation of any failure of expected pharmacological action (lack of efficacy) is not 
recorded as an AE if it is already reflected as a data point captured in the CRF.  If, however, the 
event fulfills any of the criteria of an SAE,  it must be recorded as and AE and reported as an SAE.  
 
 
•   Conditions that started before signing of informed consent and for which no symptoms or 
treatment are present until signing of informed consent are recorded as medical his tory (e.g. 
seasonal allergy without acute complain ts). 
 
•   Conditions that started before signing of informed consent and for which symptoms or 
treatment are present after signing of informed consent, at unchange d intensity, are recorded 
as medical history (e.g. allergic pollinosis). 
 
•   Conditions that started or deteriorated after signin g of informed consent will be documented 
as adverse events. 
 
 
Definition of serious adverse event (SAE) 
 
An SAE is classified as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, meets any of the following 
criteria (a – f): 
 
a.  Results in death. 
b.  Is life-threatening. 
The term ‗life-threatening‘ in the definition refers to an event in which the patient was at risk 
of death at the time of the event, it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might 
have caused death if it were more severe. 
 
c.  Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. 
 
A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_336435]: 
 
- The admission results in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8932] 12 hours. 
 
- The admission is pre-planned.  
(i.e. elective or schedule d surgery arranged prior to the start of the study) 
 
- The admission is not associated with an AE. 
(e.g. social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8933]). 
 
However, it should be noted that invasive treatment during any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_336436] ‗medically important‘ and as such may be reportable as an SAE depe ndent on 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center  
IRB Number: 13 -080 A(4)

clinical judgment.  In addition, where local regulatory authorities specifically require a more 
stringen t definition, the local regulation takes preceden ce. 
 
d.  Results in persistent or significant disability / incapacity. 
 
Disability means a substantial disruption of a person‘s ability to conduct normal life‘s functions. 
 
e.  Is a congeni tal anomaly / birth defect. 
 
f.  Is another medically important serious event as judged by [CONTACT_093]. 
 
Serious adverse events 
In addition to the SAE criteria specified in the standa rd text above, further criteria may be defined; 
e.g. all Grade-4 laboratory toxicities according to the Common Terminolog y Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE, version to be specified) may have to be recorded as SAEs. 
 
Classifications for adverse event assess ment 
 
The following classifications should be used: 
• Seriousness 
 
• Intensity 
As an alternative to the grading system described in the standa rd text below (mild, 
moderate, severe), other systems for intensity may be used (e.g. CTCAE, Grade 1 to 
Grade 5).  If used, this need s to be stated and definitions of the grades should be 
provided.  If applicable, a “translation” between the CTCAE system and the standa rd 
system of intensity grading may have to be provided. 
 
• Causal relationships to study drug: 
To be assessed separately for concomitant agen ts 
 
 
 
 
Example 1 
Doxorubicin (open 
regorafenib  (blinded) 
Versus 
Doxorubicin (open label) 
+ matching placebo 
(blinded ) The relationship to study drug will assume that both 
active entities (regorafenib or doxorubicin) are suspect 
drugs if both drugs are given in combination.  Due to 
regorafenib, regorafenib and placebo being blinded , the 
assumption is that both compound s could be in causal 
relationship as long as doxorubicin and regorafenib 
/placebo (blinded) are given in combination.  In 
exceptional cases, the investigator can state in the 
comment field that he/she believes that the event is more 
likely to be caused by [CONTACT_140647]. 
 
 
 
 
Example 2 
Dose-escalation trial, 
open -label study 
regorafenib  + 
bevacizumab  
The assessment of the relationship of an AE to the 
administration of study drug is the investigator’s clinical 
decision based on all available information at the time of 
the completion of the CRF.  Study drug refers to 
regorafenib and/or bevacizumab and the assessment of 
relationship to study drug will be done for each drug 
separately.  If the investigator feels such a distinction 
canno t be made (e.g. due to a suspected unde rlying 
interaction) the same assessment will be documented for 
both drugs

• Causal relationship to protocol-required procedures(s) 
 
• Outcome 
 
 
All AEs will be assessed and documented by [CONTACT_336456]. 
 
Seriousness 
 
For each AE, the seriousness must be determined according to the criteria given in Section 0. 
 
Intensity 
 
The intensity of the AE is classified according to the CTCAEv4.0.  Grade refers to the severity 
(intensity) of the AE: 
 
CTCAEv4 Grade 1: mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagno stic observations 
only; intervention is not indicated. 
 
CTCAEv4 Grade 2: moderate; minimal, local, or nonin vasive intervention is indicated; limiting to 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL; instrumental ADL refers to 
preparing meals, shoppin g for groceries or clothes, using the telepho ne, managin g money, 
etc). 
CTCAEv4 Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_336437]; disabling; limiting to self care 
ADL (self care ADL refers to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, 
taking medications, and not bedridden ). 
 
CTCAEv4 Grade 4: life-threatening consequen ces; urgent intervention is indicated. 
 
CTCAEv4 Grade 5: death due to an AE. 
 
Causal relationship 
 
The assessment of the causal relationship between an AE and the administration of treatment is a 
clinical decision based on all available information. 
 
If appli cable for trials with more than one study agen t, the following sentence should be included . 
 
The causality assessment should be done separately for each study treatment. 
 
The assessment is based on the question whether there was a ―reasonabl e causal relationship‖ to 
the study treatment in question. 
 
Possible answers are ―yes‖ or ―no‖. 
An assessment of ―no‖ would include: 
1.  The existence of a clear alternative explanation, e.g. mechanical bleeding at surgical site. 
or 
2.  Non-plausibility, e.g. the subject is struck by [CONTACT_336457]; cancer developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a few 
days after the first drug administration.

IRB Number: 13 -080 A(4) 
Approval date: 18 -Apr-2017  
Page 37 of 43  
  
 
 
An assessment of ―yes‖ indicates that there is a reasonabl e suspi[INVESTIGATOR_336438]. 
 
Factors to be considered in assessing the relationship of the AE to study treatment include: 
 
- The temporal sequen ce from drug administration:  The event should occur after the drug is 
given.  The length of time from drug exposure to event should be evaluated in the clinical 
context of the event. 
 
- Recovery on drug discontinuation (de-challenge), recurrence on drug re-introduction (re- 
challenge ): 
 
- Subject‘s response after de-challeng e or subjects response after re-challeng e should be 
considered in the view of the usual clinical course of the event in question. 
 
- Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases: 
Each event should be evaluated in the context of the natural history and course of the disease 
being treated and any other disease the subject may have. 
 
- Concomitant medication or treatment: 
The other drugs the subject is taking or the treatment the subject receives should be examined 
to determine whether any of them may be suspected to cause the event in question. 
 
- The pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of the study treatment: 
The pharmacokinetic properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) of the study 
treatment, couple d with the individual subject‘s pharmacodynamics should be considered. 
 
 
[Causal relationship to protocol-required procedure(s)] 
 
The assessment of a possible causal relationship between the AE and protocol-required 
procedure(s) is based on the question whether there was a ―reasonabl e causal relationship‖ to 
protocol-required procedure(s). 
 
Possible answers are ―yes‖ or ―no‖. 
 
Action taken with study treatment 
 
Any action on study treatment to resolve the AE is to be documented using the categories listed 
below. 
 
 
If appli cable for trials with more than one study agen t, the following sentence should be included . 
 
The study treatment action should be recorded separately for each study treatment.

Assess ments and documentation of adverse events 
 
Reporting of serious adverse events 
 
Each serious adverse event must be followed up until resolution or stabilization, by [CONTACT_336458]. An isolated laboratory abno rmality that is assigned grade 
4, according to CTC definition, is not reportable as an SAE; unless the investigator assesses that the 
event meets standa rd ICH criteria for an SAE.  CTC grade 4 baseline laboratory abnormalities that 
are part of the disease profile should not be reported as an SAE, specifically when they are allowed 
or not excluded by [CONTACT_39719]/exclusion criteria. 
 
When required, and according to local law and regulations, serious adverse events must be reported 
to the Ethics Committee and Regula tory Authorities. 
 
All serious adverse events should be reported to Bayer within [ADDRESS_415719] for reporting 
procedures. 
 
The Investigator may report serious adverse drug reactions (SADRs) using either:

Expected adverse events 
 
For this study, the applicable reference document is the most current version of the investigator‘s 
brochure (IB) / summary of product characteristics. 
 
 
If appli cable, the following sentence should be included . 
 
Overview listings of frequen t events that have occurred so far in the clinical development are shown 
in the current IB.  If relevant new safety information is identified, the information will be integrated 
into an update of the IB and distributed to all participating sites. 
 
The expectedne ss of AEs will be determined by [CONTACT_336459]. 
 
Adverse events of special safety interest 
 
This optional subsection may be used to pre-define certain AEs that are of particular interest for a 
given drug development program.  All pertinent details (e.g. reporting procedures) are to be 
specified as appropriate. 
 
If not needed, this subsection should be deleted. 
 
As with any new chemical entity, there is always potential for unexpected adverse events, including 
hypersensitivity reactions. 
 
Based on data studies with regorafenib and from current knowledge of the pharmacologi cal 
properties of other small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors in this drug class, as soon as there is 
reasonabl e suspi[INVESTIGATOR_39681], the investigator should immediately notify the 
sponsor. 
 
Reportable adverse events include: 
 
•   Acute renal failure (NC I-CTCAE version 4.0 ≥ grade 3) or severe proteinuria (NCI-CTCAE 
version 4.0 ≥ grade 3) 
 
•   Interstitial lung disease

Pregnancies 
 
The investigator must report to Bayer any pregnancy occurring in a study subject, or in his partner, 
during the subject‘s participation in this study.  The report should be submitted within the same 
timeline s as an SAE, although a pregnancy per se is not c onsidered an SAE. 
 
For a study subject, the outcome of the pregnancy should be followed up carefully, and any 
abno rmal outcome of the mother or the child should be reported. 
 
For the pregnan cy of a study subject‘s partner, all efforts should be made to obtain similar 
information on course and outcome, subject to the partner‘s consent. 
 
For all reports, the forms provided are to be used. 
 
Further safety 
 
Consider addin g following additional language : 
 
 
Progressive disease 
 
If progressive disease leads to signs and symptoms that meet the criteria for an SAE 
(i.e., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], disability, death, or important medical event), the signs and symptoms should 
be reported as an SAE and not the underlying progressive disease. 
 
Death 
 
If any subject dies during the trial or within [ADDRESS_415721] the cause of death in detail (using the SAE Form) within [ADDRESS_415722] sign an IRB/PB-approved consent form 
indicating their consent to participate. This consent form meets the requirements of the Code 
of Federal Regulations and the Institutional Review Board/Privacy Board of this Center. The 
consent form will include the following: 
 
1.  The nature and objectives, potential risks and bene fits of the intended study.

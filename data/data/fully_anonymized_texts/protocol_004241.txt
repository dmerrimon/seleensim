1. OBJECTIVES  
1.1 Study Design  
This is a single arm, non -randomized, phase I/II, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]/feasibility study, to determine the 
recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and toxicity and efficacy of MLN0128 in metastatic/recurrent 
Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC), an orphan disease . Between [ADDRESS_627478] 3+3. The starting dose will be 3 mg QD. Each cohort will 
be evaluated  for tolerability after completing 1 cycle of treatment before proceeding to escalation 
(4 mg QD or 5 mg QD) or de -escalation (2 mg QD or 2mg 5 days a week). Escalation/de -escalation 
w i l l not proceed beyond 5 mg QD or below 2 mg 5 days a week respective ly. The phase II portion 
of the study will be conducted according to a two -stage phase II design. The phase II part of the 
study will use the RP2D determined during the phase I part of the study.  
1.2 Primary Objectives  
Phase I: To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D)  
Phase II: To evaluate response rate (ORR)  
1.3 Secondary Objectives  
To evaluate overall survival (OS)  
To evaluate progression -free survival (PFS)   
To evaluate safety/adverse events  
Identification of biomarkers predictive of response to therapy with MLN0128  
2. BACKGROUND  
2.1 Study Disease  
Although uncommon, Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC) incidence has tripled in US from [ADDRESS_627479] of 
care is available for patients with recurrent or metastatic disease.  Given histologic and biologic 
similarities between MCC and Small Cell Lung Cancer, platinum/etoposide combination therapy 
is commonly used.  Although response rates can b e as high as 60%, median duration of response 
is 8 months (less than 3 months for those with partial response) [1].  Response rates to second and 
third line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_488415] (40% and 20%, respectively), with most patients dying 
within a ye ar with metastatic disease.  In addition, toxic death rate from chemotherapy for this 
patient population has been described as 4 -8% [1].  
Protocol #: Amendment 4  
Version Date: March 18, 2016  
5  More recently, a human polyomavirus (MCV) was implicated in the pathogenesis of MCC. It is 
constituted by 5,387 base pairs, encoding for the large T (LT) antigen and small T (ST) antigen, 
which act differently and sinergistically to promote cell proliferat ion and transformation.  
Shuda et al. [2] showed that MCV ST antigen reduced turnover of hyperphosphorylated 4E -BP1, 
which in turn increased eIF4E activity. Expression of a constitutively active 4E -BP1 that cannot 
be phosphorylated reversed MCV ST –induced c ell transformation, which showed that the 
proliferative effects of MCV ST are caused by [CONTACT_488440]. These findings indicate that MCV ST targets cap -dependent translation though a 
mechanism that contributes to Mer kel cell tumorigenesis.  
Lin et al. [3], using tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry, found that mTOR pathway was 
activated as indicated by [CONTACT_488441] -4E-BP1, phosphorylation -S6K, and 
phosphorylation -mTOR regardless of MCV sta tus. Two primary human MCC cell lines from two 
patients with lymph node metastases were established, demonstrating mTOR pathway 
upregulation and decreased autophagy in both MCC cells. Inhibition of mTOR pathway decreased 
cell proliferation and induced auto phagy and cell death in MCC cells. Furthermore, cell death 
induced by [CONTACT_488442], suggesting a rationale for potential new therapeutic targets.  
Finally, Nardi et al. [4] r etrospectively profiled [ADDRESS_627480] PIK3CA gene activating mutations. Sanger sequencing of the primary MCC tumors 
detec ted one additional PIK3CA mutation (R19K) that had not been previously described in 
cancer. MCV was detected in 38 (66%) MCC cases. With one exception, the presence of MCV 
and activating mutations in PIK3CA appeared mutually exclusive. We observed that sig naling 
through the PI3K/pAKT pathway was active in one MCV -positive and in all MCV -negative MCC 
cell lines, as evidenced by [CONTACT_488443].   
Based on the above data, we propose a phase I/II study evaluating the activity of MLN0128 in 
patients with me tastatic/recurrent MCC.  
2.2 IND Agent  
Millennium has developed MLN0128, which is a novel, highly selective, orally bioavailable 
adenosine 5’ triphosphate (ATP) -competitive inhibitor of the serine/threonine kinase referred to as 
the mechanistic target of ra pamycin (mTOR). MLN0128 (formerly INK128) targets [ADDRESS_627481] 
multiprotein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. MLN0128 is being developed for both oncology 
and non -oncology indications. In oncology, MLN0128 is being investigated as a treatment for 
advanced solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, either as monotherapy or in combination 
with chemotherapy, other molecularly targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], or antihormonal agents. Non -oncology 
indications being investigated include fibrotic and inflammatory diseases in the lung  or bronchioles 
such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). 
MLN0128 is also being developed in combination with MLN1117 (an oral phosphoinositide -3
nonhematologic

6  malignancies; information regarding this novel c ombination is provided to relevant investigators 
in the MLN0128 + MLN117 Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  
MLN0128 selectively and potently inhibits mTOR kinase (IC50 = 1.1 nM), inhibits mTORC1/2 
signaling, and prevents cellular proliferation. The mTOR is a ki nase that regulates cell growth, 
translational control, angiogenesis, and cell survival by [CONTACT_259780]. 
mTOR kinase plays a key role in several pathways that are frequently dysregulated in human 
cancer [5]. mTORC1 is best know n as a key regulator of protein translation through 
phosphorylation of 4EBP1 (the eukaryotic translation Initiation Factor 4E -binding Protein 1) and 
ribosomal protein S6 (known as S6) kinase. mTORC2 is best known for its ability to fully activate 
protein k inase B (AKT) by [CONTACT_432363] S473 site, which regulates proliferation and 
survival pathways [6].  
The mTOR complex (mTORC) is an important therapeutic target that is generally stable (ie, low 
tendency to mutate) and is a key intracellular point of convergence for a number of cellular 
signaling pathways. Inhibiting mTOR may inhibit abnormal cell proliferation, tumor angiogenesis, 
and abnormal cellular metabolism, thus providing the rationale for mTOR inhibitors as potential 
agents in the treatment  of a number of indications including solid tumor and hematological 
malignancies, as either monotherapy or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. Like 
rapamycin, several newly approved rapalogs (temsirolimus and everolimus) are specific and 
allosteric inhibitors of mTORC1, and only partially inhibit mTORC1 signaling pathways. They do 
not directly inhibit mTORC2, which has shown to be an emerging target in cancer research. 
MLN0128 was developed to address the incomplete inhibition of the mTOR pat hway by [CONTACT_380683].  
2.3 Nonclinical Summary  
2.3.1  Pharmacology  
MLN0128 selectively and potently inhibits mTOR kinase (the concentration inhibiting 50% of 
enzyme activity [IC50] is 1.1 nM), inhibits mTORC1/2 signaling, and prevents cellular 
proliferation.  
MLN0128 inhibited phosphorylation of downstream modulators of mTORC1and mTORC2 in 
human U87 glioblastoma tumor xenograft models in mice and showed strong tumor growth 
inhibition (TGI) at tolerable oral (PO) doses in all [ADDRESS_627482] the human ether -à-go-go related gene (hERG) potassium 
ion channel and did not affect cardiovascular (CV) parameters in vivo in telemeterized monkeys.  
2.3.3  Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics  
Protocol #: Amendment 4  
Version Date: March 18, 2016  
7  MLN0128 was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_432342], rats, dogs, and monkeys, with 
high oral bioavailability. [14C]MLN0128 was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_432343] -Evans rats; radioactivity was eliminated from most tissues at  48 hours postdose.  
MLN0128 displayed dose -proportional plasma exposures, a moderate propensity to cross the 
blood -brain barrier, and was modestly bound (70.5%) to human plasma proteins. MLN0128 
distributed mainly to the plasma of human blood. There was n o obvious concentration -dependent 
red blood cell (RBC) distribution of MLN0128 in human blood.  
MLN0128 did not inhibit P -glycoprotein, but did inhibit breast cancer -resistance protein (BCRP), 
organic cation transporter (OCT)1 and (OCT)2.  
M1, the single m etabolite (monohydroxylation product) observed in human microsomal 
incubations, was also observed in rats and monkeys. The main isozymes responsible for phase 1 
metabolism appear to be cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4. MLN0128 did not induce 
CYP1A2 , 2B6, and 3A4 activity and expression at concentrations up to 10 µM. MLN0128 
displayed low potential for inhibition and is not a time -dependent inhibitor of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 
2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4/5.  
Oral administration of MLN0128 in humans has a low p otential for metabolic and transporterbased 
drug-drug interactions (DDIs), especially given clinical exposures observed to date after 
administration of the highest anticipated therapeutic dose to be used in the clinic in oncology 
indications (total maximum  plasma concentration [Cmax] of 0.48 µM [free Cmax of 0.14 µM] at 
30 mg once weekly [QW]).  
2.3.4  Toxicology  
The toxicologic profiles obtained in the Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) -compliant and non -
GLPcompliant studies in rats and monkeys were generally consistent with pharmacologic 
inhibition of mTORC1/2 activity.  Observed toxicities were mostly consistent between sexes. 
MLN0128 repeatdose GLP studies include completed 28 -day and preliminary 3 -month toxicology 
studies in rat and monkeys, and embryo -fetal studies in rats and rabbits.  
The dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) of MLN0128 in rats and monkeys were secondary to an 
exaggerated pharmacologic response and consisted of body weight loss and associated clinical 
observations that included gastrointestinal (GI) distress and decreased activity, appetite, and body 
temperature. In addition to the previously mentioned effects, a single monkey in the [ADDRESS_627483] exposures tolerated in the preliminary 3 -month rat and monkey toxicology studies were 
1233 and 194 ng hr/mL, respectively.  
Adverse effects in rats included body weight loss, decreased activity, increased glucose and insulin 
levels, alterations in white blo od cells, bone marrow and lymphoid depletion, thymic necrosis, 
oligospermia, testes degeneration/atrophy, nonglandular stomach epi[INVESTIGATOR_488416]/ulceration/hyperplasia, pancreatic islet degeneration and fibrosis, lens fiber 
degeneration with cataract  correlate, adrenal cortex hypertrophy, pi[INVESTIGATOR_488417] #: Amendment 4  
Version Date: March 18, 2016  
8  body weight loss, liver hepatocellular vacuolation, retinal dysplasia with or without optic nerve 
atrophy, and alveolar histiocytosis. The alveolar histiocytosis was only present in the  28-day rat 
study and was absent in the 3 -month rat study. Both retinal dysplasia and alveolar histiocytosis are 
thought to be potential background findings. The pancreatic islet degeneration and fibrosis, as well 
as the other findings of lens fiber degene ration, pi[INVESTIGATOR_488418], and liver vacuolation, were 
consistent with the mechanism of action (MOA) and effects observed with other rapalogs. The 
microscopic findings observed in the testes, epi[INVESTIGATOR_26612], and eyes in the 28 -day and/or 3 -month 
rat studies were not resolved after a 14 -day recovery period, while partial to complete resolution 
was seen in the lungs, thymus, nonglandular stomach, and bone marrow.   
The adverse effects in monkeys included decreased activity, appetite, and body weight; increased 
glucose and insulin; lymphoid and bone marrow depletion; adrenal hypertrophy/hyperplasia; 
pancreatic and salivary gland acinar cell secretory depletion; GI tract erosion and ulceration; skin 
ulceration/epi[INVESTIGATOR_85783]; acanthosis and hyperkeratosis; and adipose tissue depletion. 
Additionally, there were sporadic inflammatory findings among some animals that were of 
uncertain association to the test article. The findings in the pancreas, adrenal glands, and salivary 
glands may have been related to a st ress response or reduced food consumption. The findings were 
generally reversible after a 14 -day recovery period.  
The findings in rat and monkey repeat -dose toxicology studies with MLN0128, including bone 
marrow and lymphoid depletion, GI and skin effects , and effects on glucose and insulin levels, can 
be monitored in clinical trials. The toxicities seen in the repeat -dose toxicology studies, such as GI 
effects and glucose and insulin increases, are consistent with the treatment -emergent adverse 
events (TE AEs), including mucositis and hyperglycemia, observed to date in patients receiving 
MLN0128.  
Rat and rabbit range -finding embryo -fetal studies demonstrated teratogenic, fetotoxic, and 
abortive effects with MLN0128. Embryo -fetal lethality and/or teratogeni c effects have been 
reported with the mTORC1 inhibitors rapamycin and the rapalogs.  
MLN0128 was negative for genotoxicity in an in vitro bacterial mutagenesis (Ames) assay, an in 
vivo rat micronucleus assay, and an in vivo rat comet assay. An in vitro chro mosomal aberration 
assay with MLN0128 in human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) was positive for 
chromosomal aberrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation.  
However, the weight of evidence from the combined results of a negative mutage nicity assay and 
negative genotoxicity assessments in 2 in vivo assays in 3 tissues (bone marrow, liver, and 
duodenum) demonstrate that MLN0128 does not present a genotoxic risk.  
MLN0128 was negative for phototoxicity in the 3T3 fibroblast assay.  
2.4 Summary of Effects in Humans in Advanced Solid Malignancies and Hematologic 
Malignancies  
Protocol #: Amendment 4  
Version Date: March 18, 2016  
9  MLN0128 is in clinical development as a single agent in 3 phase 1 studies including study INK128 -
01 in patients with advanced solid malignancies, study INK128 -002 in patients with multiple 
myeloma [MM], non -Hodgkin lymphoma [NHL] and Waldenström macroglobu linemia [WM]) 
and study C31002 to measure the effect of MLN0128 on QTc interval in patients with advanced 
solid malignancies.  It is also being investigated in combination with paclitaxel (with or without 
trastuzumab) in patients with advanced solid tumors  (Ph1 study INK128 -003), and in combination 
with exemestane or fulvestrant in women with ER+/HER2  (estrogen receptorpositive /human 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] 2 protein -negative) advanced or metastatic breast cancer (Ph1b/2 
study C31001)  
MLN0128 do sing regimens tested thus far include QD, QW, QD×3days per week (once daily for 
3 consecutive days followed by a 4 -day dosing holiday every week), and QD×5days per week 
(once daily for 5 consecutive days followed by a 2 -day dosing holiday every week).  
Please note that the data described in this section was obtained with the original unmilled  
MLN0128 active pharmaceutical ingredient (API); current manufacturing process produces milled  
MLN0128 API.  
2.4.[ADDRESS_627484] -in-human, dose -finding study in patients with advanced 
solid malignancies (Study INK128 -001) and in a completed phase 1 study (Stu dy INK128 -002) in 
patients with MM and WM. A third study (INK128 -003) is being conducted in patients with solid 
tumors to evaluate the preliminary safety and efficacy of the combination of MLN0128 with 
paclitaxel, with or without trastuzumab.  
 [ADDRESS_627485] study drug 
dose had been reported to the clinical database as of the data cutoff; of these events, 1 (cardiac 
arrest; Study INK128 -001) was considered related to MLN012 8 (see section [IP_ADDRESS] of the IB Ed  
8)  
At least 1 treatment -emergent SAE, regardless of causality, had been reported in 125/335 patients 
(37%). Across the studies and regardless of causality or dosing regimen, the most common TEAEs 
included nausea, fatig ue, hyperglycemia, vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis, and decreased appetite.  
2.4.[ADDRESS_627486] -in-human, dose -escalation study of single -agent MLN0128 
administered to patients diagnosed with advanced solid malignanc ies, including, but not limited 
to, colorectal, renal, endometrial, and urothelial tumors. Four dosing schedules are being evaluated 
(QD, QW, QD × 3d QW, and QD × 5d QW). Each schedule is administered in 28 -day cycles.  
Protocol #: Amendment 4  
Version Date: March 18, 2016  
10  As of 09 December 2014, a total of 19 4 patients had been enrolled. Median age at baseline was  
60 years (range, 24 -89 years), most (95%) patients are white, and 54% are women. As of data 
 dose of MLN0128 in 2 treatment cycles, while 8% had entered 3 
cycles, and 10% had entered [ADDRESS_627487] number of cycles that had been initiated as of 
data cutoff was 46.   
The maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) for the 4 schedules investigated in INK128 -001 were 
determined to be 6 mg for QD dosing, 16 mg for QD × 3d QW dosing, 10 mg for QD × 5d QW 
dosin g, and [ADDRESS_627488] was the only case considered study drug -related; details are provided in section 
[IP_ADDRESS]. of the I B Ed8.  
As of the clinical database cutoff date, treatment -emergent SAEs had been reported for  
82  patients, overall) preferred 
terms were stomatitis in 7 patients (4%), pneumonia in 6 patients (3%), abdominal pain or 
anemia in 5, each (3%), and vomiting , asthenia, or renal failure acute in 4, each (2%).   
 
commonly reported TEAEs were nausea or hyperglycemia, which were each reported in 125 
patients (64%). The second most common TEAE was vomiting (54% of patients), followed by 
[CONTACT_29429] (51%).   
3 had be en reported for 68% of 
treated  
3 TEAEs, regardless of causality, 
that  
s as of the data cutoff were hyperglycemia (14% of patients),  
fatigue or hypophosphatemia (8% each), asthenia (7%), anemia or stomatitis (6% each), and 
lymphopenia or nausea (5% of pa tients each).  
Of the 194 patients treated in Study INK128 -001 as of the clinical data cutoff, 110 (57%) 
discontinued because of disease progression, 20 (10%) withdrew consent, and 15 (8%) were lost 
to follow -up or discontinued for other reasons.   
A total  of 68 AEs led to study discontinuation among 35 patients (18%). Of these events,  
32 (47%), including 16 nonserious AEs, were reported as severity Grade 3, and 6 SAEs were Grade 
5. No Grade 4 events were reported as resulting in study discontinuation. Mos t (71%) events were 
considered study drug -related and had resolved as of the data cutoff date.  

Protocol #: Amendment 4  
Version Date: March 18, 2016  
11  A total of 12 preferred terms were reported as leading to discontinuation for >1 patient, including 
rash (9 patients, including the terms maculopapular [5 patien ts], rash [2], and rash erythematous 
or rash pruritic [1 each]), nausea or stomatitis (7 patients each), pruritus or pruritus generalized (4 
patients total), and asthenia, fatigue, renal failure/renal failure acute (3 patients, each). Events 
reported in 2 patients included hyperglycemia, pain or pain in extremity, performance status 
decreased, and vomiting.   
2.4.3  Study INK128 -002  
Study INK -002 is a completed phase 1, open -label, dose -escalation study of oral MLN0128 
administered as a single agent in patients with relapsed or refractory hematologic malignancies 
(MM or non -Hodgkin lymphoma, including WM). A total of 39 patients recei ved MLN0128 in 1 
of 2 regimens: 26 patients received QD doses (range, 2 -7 mg) and 13 patients were dosed on a QD 
× 3d QW schedule (range, 9 -12 mg). The MTD for the QD schedule was 4 mg. The MTD for the 
QD × 3d QW schedule was 9 mg.  
A total of 21 of the pa tients (54%) in this study were male and 87% were white. The median age 
at baseline was 61 years (range, 46 -85 years).  
Two patients died during Study INK128 -002. One death was due to a subdural hemorrhage, and 
the other was due to disease progression. Both  events were considered by [CONTACT_488444]0128.  
Details of the subdural hemorrhage case, taken from the Final Clinical Study Report INK128 -002, 
are as follows:  
 
Treatment -emergent SAEs were reported in Study INK128 -002 for 11 pat ients (28%). No SAE 
occurred in more than [ADDRESS_627489] SAEs were considered severity Grade 2 or 3. Grade 
4 SAEs were reported in 2 patients: hyperviscosity syndrome and hyponatremia were reported in 

Protocol #: Amendment 4  
Version Date: March 18, 2016  
12  1 patient in the 2 -mg QD dose group (both eve nts resolved); and acute renal failure was reported 
in 1 patient in the 12 -mg QD × 3d QW dose group (resolved with sequelae).  
No SAEs were considered to be related to MLN0128 treatment, with the exception of 3 events that 
were reported in 1 patient. This patient experienced Grade 2 pneumonia on Day 58 that resolved 
without sequelae on Day 60. On Day 121, the same patient experienced SAEs of pneumonia (Grade 
2) and hypoxia (Grade 3). The [ADDRESS_627490] 
frequently reported preferred term (in 56% of patients), followed by [CONTACT_29429] (49%), hyperglycemia 
(38%), thrombocytopenia (36%), and diarrhea (28%).  
 
Overall, a to tal of 20 patients (51%) in Study INK128 -002 discontinued due to progressive disease, 
11 patients (28%) withdrew consent, and 6 (15%) discontinued due to investigator decision or 
other reasons.  
Most events leading to study discontinuation were considered nonserious. Fatigue was reported 
as resulting in study discontinuation in 2 patients; all other events were reported as leading to 
study discontinuation in 1 patient only.

14  A total of 57% of the treated patients are female, and 93% are white. At baseline, the median age 
was 60 years (range 21 -81 years).  
On the basis of dose escalation data, 8 mg of MLN0128 on the QD × 3d QW schedule was selected 
for the dose expansion phase in breast cancer patients. The QD × 5d QW an d QW schedules were 
abandoned before MTDs were declared, as they were viewed as less convenient relative to the QD 
× 3d QW schedule from the perspective of administering the paclitaxel and trastuzumab 
combination.   
Overall in the dose expansion phase, pat ients entered a median of 3.0 treatment cycles (range, 1 -
19 cycles) and a mean (SD) of 5.6 (6.07) cycles. The overall median duration of exposure was 7.5 
weeks, with a duration over 2 -fold greater (11.1 weeks) in the MLN0128 8 mg QD×3days per 
week HER2 - treatment group relative to the MLN0128 8 mg QD×3days per week HER2+ plus 
trastuzumab group (5.2 weeks). The median cumulative dose was 189.0 mg. Across treatment 
groups, patients received approximately 75% of their planned dose of MLN0128.

Overall, pharmacokinetic (PK) data from Studies INK128 -001, INK128 -002, and INK128 -[ADDRESS_627498] oral absorption (first time to maximum plasma concentration 
[Tmax], generally between 1 -4 hours after dosing); dose -linear PK, with a mean plasma half -life 
(t½) of approximately 8 hours; and that MLN0128 does not accumulate meaningfully i n plasma 
when dosed as frequently as once daily and under any of 4 tested dosing regimens. The PK of 
MLN0128 was generally consistent, with no appreciable differences across the 3 clinical studies. 
Neither paclitaxel nor MLN0128 appeared to alter the PK of  the other agent when co -administered.  
A capsule containing milled active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) is available for clinical studies 
in 1 mg, 3 mg and 5 mg strengths. The milled API, may result in faster absorption profile with 
possibly higher maxim um concentration (Cmax), which could result in a different safety profile 
compared to the previous unmilled API [INVESTIGATOR_259722]. Therefore, [COMPANY_005] has ongoing studies with the 
new milled API [INVESTIGATOR_488419] 2 dose (RP2D) for single agent MLN012 8 
and in combination with paclitaxel.  
Protocol #: Amendment 4  
Version Date: March 18, 2016  
17  2.5 Rationale  
Recently, a human polyomavirus (MCV) was implicated in the pathogenesis of MCC. MCV is 
constituted by 5,387 base pairs, encoding for the large T (LT) antigen and small T (ST) antigen, 
which act different ly and synergistically to promote cell proliferation and transformation [7].  
A key step in cap -dependent translation is the binding of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E  
-methylguanosine GTP cap [8]. Ribosome recruitment  
to capped mRNAs is initiated by [CONTACT_488445] -subunit eIF4F, composed of eIF4E, 
eIF4A, and eIF4G, on the cap. A key regulator of this process is the eukaryotic translation initiation 
factor 4E -binding protein 1 (4E -BP1), which sequesters eIF4E to prevent eIF4F formation on 
capped mRNA [9]. Induction of cap -dependent translation may play a role in tumor cell growth, 
since eIF4E overexpression causes rodent cell transformation [10,11].   
Shuda et al [7] showed that MCV ST antigen reduced turnover of hyperphosphorylated 4E -BP1, 
which in turn increased eIF4E activity. Expression of a constitutively active 4E -BP1 that cannot 
be phosphorylated reversed MCV ST –induced cell transformation, which showed that the 
proliferative effects of MCV ST are caused by [CONTACT_488440]. These findings indicate that MCV ST targets cap -dependent translation though a 
mechanism that contributes to Merkel cell tumorigenesis.  
Lin et al [8] using tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry, found that mTOR pathway was 
activated as indicated by [CONTACT_488441] -4E-BP1, phosphorylation -S6K, and 
phosphorylation -mTOR regardless of MCV status. Two primary human MCC  cell lines from two 
patients with lymph node metastases were established, demonstrating mTOR pathway 
upregulation and decreased autophagy in both MCC cells. Inhibition of mTOR pathway decreased 
cell proliferation and induced autophagy and cell death in MC C cells. Furthermore, cell death 
induced by [CONTACT_488442], suggesting a rationale for potential new therapeutic targets.  
Finally, Nardi et al [9] retrospectively profiled [ADDRESS_627499] PIK3CA gene activating mutations. Sanger sequencing of the primary MCC tumors 
detected one additional PIK3CA m utation (R19K) that had not been previously described in 
cancer. MCV was detected in 38 (66%) MCC cases. With one exception, the presence of MCV 
and activating mutations in PIK3CA appeared mutually exclusive. We observed that signaling 
through the PI3K/pAK T pathway was active in one MCV -positive and in all MCV -negative MCC 
cell lines, as evidenced by [CONTACT_488443].   
MLN0128 is a novel, highly selective, orally bioavailable ATP -competitive inhibitor of the mTOR. 
The mTOR is a kinase that regulates cel l growth, translational control, angiogenesis, and cell 
survival. MLN0128 selectively and potently inhibits mTOR kinase, inhibits mTORC1/[ADDRESS_627500] known for 
its ability to fully activate AKT by [CONTACT_432363] S473 site, which regulates proliferation 
and survival pathways [6].

Based on the above data, we propose a run -in phase I prior to the phase II study, to evaluate the 
RP2D; and phase II to determine activity of MLN0128 in patients with metastatic/recurrent MCC.  
PK samples will be obtained on days 8, [ADDRESS_627501] tumor tissue collected (upto 40 unstained slides or one tumor block). A vial 
of EDTA blood will also be obtained. Whole exome sequencing will be performed on tumor and 
normal genomic DNA of all patients. All patients will undergo Oncopanel testing which analyzes 
300 cancer relevant genes. Patients with accessible tumors may undergo sequential biopsies prior 
to, at 4 weeks of therapy and upon progression. Analysis of p4EBP1, pSK6, pCAD, pMTOR and 
MCV LT/ST will be performed retrospectively to  correlate with disease response.  
PATIENTS WHO PROGRESS ON THERAPY WILL BE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO 
UNDERGO ANOTHER BIOPSY. WHOLE EXOME SEQUENCING WILL BE PERFORMED 
ON THIS SAMPLE TO ELUCIDATE POTENTIAL RESISTANCE MECHANISMS.  
3. UPDATED MANUFACTURING PROCES S 
A new MLN0128 capsule containing milled active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) is available 
for new clinical studies in 1 mg, 3 mg and 5 mg strengths.   
The milled API, may result in faster absorption profile with possibly higher maximum 
concentration ( Cmax), which could result in a different safety profile compared to the previous 
unmilled API [INVESTIGATOR_259722]. Therefore, ongoing studies (C31001, C31002 and , MLN0128 -1004 – A

4. CLINICAL SUMMARY OF SAFETY  
4.[ADDRESS_627502] self -monitoring of blood glucose, a finding of closer 
monitoring of serum glucose and possible intervention. Subjects with Grade 1 hyperglycemia 
(fasting serum glucose [FSG] > the upper  limit of the normal range mg/dL) are treated with oral 
hypoglycemic agents (eg, metformin), and subjects with mg/dL) are treated aggressively with oral 
Protocol #: Amendment 4  
Version Date: March 18, 2016  
19  hypoglycemic agents and/or insulin as clinically indicated. Daily home monitoring and early 
treatment, have resulted in good control of glucose levels for the majority of MLN0128 -treated 
subjects who developed hyperglycemia.   
4.1.2  Cardiac Effects  
Cardiac events (including QT interval corrected for heart rate prolongation and arrhythmias) have 
been infrequ ently observed in clinical studies of MLN0128. To date, there has been [ADDRESS_627503] postdose that had a fatal outcome and was assessed as 
related to MLN0128. Routine cardiac monitoring with baseline electrocardiog ram (ECG) or 
multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan and on -study ECGs and physical examination constitute the 
core cardiac safety monitoring in all MLN0128 studies.  
For subjects showing any signs of cardiac instability after MLN0128 dosing, additional monitor ing 
onsite before clinic discharge should be considered.  
4.1.3  Renal Function  
Elevations in creatinine (regardless of causality) have been observed in subjects receiving  
MLN0128, all of which have been reversible with drug interruption and/or supportive care with 
IV hydration. Further evaluation of the renal insufficiency with urine electrolytes suggested a 
prerenal etiology with a low fractional excretion of sodium < 1%. However, the adverse event 
cases were confounded by [CONTACT_488446], vomiting, hyperglycemia, concomitant 
medications with GI side effects such as metformin, and hydronephrosis, any of which may have 
also contributed to dehydration and elev ated creatinine. Subjects should be encouraged to drink at 
least 20 ounces of fluids a day, especially on days requiring fasting (per protocol), with 
administration of IV fluids in the clinic as indicated to avoid dehydration.  
Baseline macroscopic urinaly sis and routine serum chemistries along with other safety laboratory 
assessments are performed in all MLN0128 studies. Additionally, microscopic urinalysis, a [ADDRESS_627504] part, rash and pruritus improve with antihistamines, topi[INVESTIGATOR_299687], and/or dose interruption. Some subjects have required pulse systemic steroids, dose 
reduction, and/or study treatment d iscontinuation.

are no known drug interactions. In vitro data, including cytochrome P450 induction/inhibition and 
transporter inhibition studies conducted for MLN0128, suggest a low risk for MLN0128 to 
precipi[INVESTIGATOR_047] a drug -drug interaction. Altho ugh potential drug -drug interactions with MLN0128 
cannot be ruled out based on the known metabolism characteristics of MLN0128, the potential risk

7.1 Treatment Regimen  
MLN0128 milled API [INVESTIGATOR_208751] (phase I starting dose, 3mg and phase II starting at 
RP2D), orally, daily at the same time of the day, until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity 
or withdrawal of consent. Dose reduction beyond 2 mg is not allowed. Treatment will be 
administered on an outpatient basis.  Reported adverse events and potential risks are described in 
Section 9.  Appropriate dose modifications are described in Section 8.  No investigatio nal or 
commercial agents or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_488421]'s malignancy.  
The participant will be requested to maintain a medication diary of each dose of medication.  The 
medication d iary will be returned to clinic staff at the end of each cycle.  
7.2 Pre-Treatment Criteria  
As long as the screening lab results meet eligibility criteria, some lab value variance may be 
allowed by [CONTACT_51199] 1 Day 1, as long as toxicity criteria are not met. In th e event that the participant’s 
condition is deteriorating, laboratory evaluations should be repeated within [ADDRESS_627520] b e met and documented before 
drug administration. Study drug will be administered only to eligible patients under the supervision 
of the investigator or identified subinvestigator(s).  
MLN0128 capsule will be taken orally, once daily, approximately at the s ame time each day, on 
an empty stomach. The patients should be instructed to refrain from eating and drinking (except 
for water and any other prescribed medications), for two hours before and one hour after each dose. 
It is recommended that each dose of ML N0128 be given with 8 ounces (240 mL) of water.  
Patients should be instructed to take their study medication at approximately the same time on 
each scheduled dosing day and not to take more than the prescribed dose at any time. Patients 
should swallow the  study medication whole and not chew it, open it, or manipulate it in any way 
before swallowing. If a patient does not take their MLN0128 dose within the time frame 
specified (+/ - 8h of the QD or QD×3days per week schedule), then the dose should be skipped  
and considered a missed dose. Patients should record any missed doses in their diary  and resume 
drug administration at the next scheduled time with the prescribed dosage. Under no 
circumstance should a patient repeat a dose or double -up doses.  
In the phase I part of this study, the starting dose of 3 mg QD was chosen to account for the 
possibility of increased absorption with MLN0128 capsules based on preliminary MLN0128 
milled API [INVESTIGATOR_488422]. Each cohort should be evaluated for tolera bility after completing 
1 cycle of treatment before proceeding to escalation (4 mg QD or 5 mg QD) or deescalation (2 mg

adverse event or abnormal laboratory value assessed as unrelated to disease, disease progression, 
inter-current illness, or concomitant medications, and occurs < [ADDRESS_627521] dose of 
MLN0128, and meets any of th e criteria listed below.  
Whenever a patient experiences toxicity that fulfills the criteria for a DLT (or a potential DLT), 
treatment with MLN0128 will be interrupted (if not otherwise specified) and the toxicity will be 
followed up as described in sectio n 7.3. 5.  The criteria for dose -limiting toxicities are outlined

lower grade AE leads to a dose interruption of more than 7 doses of MLN0128, this AE will be 
considered as DLT.  
If the 2nd occurrence of an initially non -dose limiting toxicity (e. g., grade [ADDRESS_627528] occurrence) leads to a dose reduction (Section 8) within

develop Grade 1 hyperglycemia (FSG > ULN  160 mg/dL) or, al ternatively, consider initiating 
treatment with an oral hypoglycemic agent, such as metformin.  All s  
hyperglycemia (FSG > 160 mg/dL) must be treated aggressively with oral hypoglycemic agents 
and/or insulin as clinically indicated while continuing on MLN 0128.  The investigator should 
consult an endocrinologist if needed to aid in optimizing the subject’s hyperglycemia treatment 
plan.  
It is recommended that subjects be treated initially with a fast acting, insulin sensitizer, such as 
metformin at 500 mg P O QD, and titrate up to a maximum of 1000 mg PO BID as needed.   
Concurrent addition to metformin of DPP -4 inhibitors (eg, sitagliptin or vildagliptin) and/or insulin 
should also be considered.  Oral sulfonylureas (eg, glipi[INVESTIGATOR_53289]) should be use d with 
caution due to the higher risk of inducing hypoglycemia in subjects.  The dose of oral 
hypoglycemic agents should be adjusted in subjects with renal insufficiency.  
8.1.2  Management of Noninfectious Pneumonitis  
Pneumonitis is a known potential risk of mTOR inhibitors. Early recognition, prompt 
intervention, and a conservative risk management approach are recommended due to

Version Date: April 15, [ADDRESS_627553] be reported in routine study data submissions to the Overall PI [INVESTIGATOR_52458]. AEs reported through expedited processes (e.g., reported to the IRB, 
FDA, etc.) must also be reported in routine study data submissio ns. 
AEs may be spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_5363]/or in response to an open question from 
study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination, or other diagnostic 
procedures. Any clinically relevant deterioration in laboratory assessmen ts or other clinical 
finding is considered an AE. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common 
underlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event. AEs which are serious must 
be reported to Millennium Pharmacovigilance (or designee) fr om the time of consent up to and 
including [ADDRESS_627554] of MLN0128. Any SAE that occurs at any 
time after completion of MLN0128 treatment or after the designated follow -up period that the 
sponsor -investigator and/or sub -investigator considers to be related to study drug must be 
reported to Millennium Pharmacovigilance (or designee). Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_488435] t o be considered AEs unless the condition deteriorated in an unexpected manner 
during the trial (e.g., surgery was performed earlier or later than planned). All SAEs should be 
monitored until they are resolved or are clearly determined to be due to a patien t’s stable or 
chronic condition or intercurrent illness(es).  
Since this is an investigator -initiated study, the sponsor -investigator Guilherme Rabinowits, MD, 
also referred to as the sponsor -investigator, is responsible for reporting serious adverse event s 
(SAEs) to any regulatory agency and to the sponsor - investigator’s IRB. Regardless of 
expectedness or causality, all SAEs must also be reported to Millennium Pharmacovigilance or 
designee:  
Fatal and Life Threatening SAEs: within 24 hours but no later tha n 4 calendar days of the sponsor -
investigator’s observation or awareness of the event.  
All other serious (non -fatal/non life threatening) events: within 4 calendar days of the 
sponsorinvestigator’s observation or awareness of the event. See below for cont act information 
for the reporting of SAEs to Millennium Pharmacovigilance.  
The SAE report must include at minimum:  
Event term(s) Serious criteria; Intensity of the event(s): Sponsor -investigator’s or 
subinvestigator’s determination. Intensity for each SAE,  including any lab abnormalities, will be 
determined by [CONTACT_128751], as a guideline, whenever 
possible. The criteria are available online at http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html.Causality of 
the event(s): Spon sor-investigator’s or sub -investigator’s determination of the relationship of the 
event(s) to study drug administration.  
Follow -up information on the SAE may be requested by [CONTACT_20555].

A list of the adverse events and potential risks associated with the investigational agent 
administered in this study can be found in Sec tion 9.1. The DFCI INV 100 policy will be followed 
in handling the IP and the destruction of patient returns.  
 10.1 MLN0128  
Protocol #: Original  
Version Date: April 15, 2015  
45 10.1.1 Description  
A new MLN0128 capsule is available in 3 dose strengths, 1 mg, 3 mg, and 5 mg, each containing 
1 mg, 3 mg, and 5  mg of MLN0128, respectively, in addition to the milled active pharmaceutical 
ingredient (API), the following inactive ingredients: microcrystalline cellulose (solid 
filler/diluents), magnesium stearate (lubricant) are found in the, and hard gelatin capsul e. All 3 
dose strengths are formulated into size 2 capsules, and each dose strength is differentiated by [CONTACT_68458], 
as listed below:  
MLN0128 capsules, 1 mg - white opaque color  
MLN0128 capsules, 3 mg – orange opaque color; and/or  
MLN0128 capsules, 5 mg – grey opaque color   
The milled API, may result in faster absorption profile with possibly higher maximum 
concentration (Cmax), which could result in a different safety profile compared to the previous 
unmilled API [INVESTIGATOR_259722]. Therefore, ongoing studies (C31001,  C31002 and , MLN0128 -1004 – 
A Phase I, open label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of 
MLN0128 as a single agent and in combination with paclitaxel in adult patients with advanced 
non-hematologuical malignancies -), with the new milled API [INVESTIGATOR_432354] 2 dose (RP2D) for single agent MLN0128 (QD and QW) and QD×3days per week in 
combination with paclitaxel, as well as the effect of high -fat meal on the PK of milled API .  
10.1.2 Form  
MLN0128 capsules are packaged in 60 -cc HDPE bottles with polypropylene, child -resistant caps 
and induction seal. For all 3 dose strengths, each bottle contains 30 capsules.  
10.1.3 Storage and Stability  
MLN0128 should be stored at controlled room temperature 15°C to 30°C (59°F  to 86°F). All study 
supplies must be kept in a restricted access area.  
MLN0128 will be packaged and labeled according to all regulations. Sites must store according to 
the labeled conditions.   
10.1.[ADDRESS_627557] with the powder (eg, from a broken capsule), skin should be washed immediately 
with soap and copi[INVESTIGATOR_12666] [ADDRESS_627558] with the eyes, 
Protocol #: Original  
Version Date: April 15, [ADDRESS_627559] 15 minutes. Medical 
personnel should be notified.  
10.1.5 Availability  
MLN0128 will be supplied free -of-charge, by [CONTACT_24312].  
10.1.6 Preparation  
MLN0128 study drug will be provid ed in 60 cc high -density polypropylene (HDPE) bottles with 
polypropylene, child -resistant caps and induction seal. Study drug will be dispensed with dosing 
instructions for home use, including the requirement that capsules are stored in their original 
containers and that capsules be swallowed whole and not opened, chewed, or manipulated in any 
way. Materials provided by [CONTACT_488453].  
MLN0128 is an anticancer drug and , as with other potentially toxic compounds, caution should be 
exercised when handling MLN0128 capsules.  
10.1.7 Administration  
MLN0128 will be administered once daily, approximately at the same time each day, on an empty 
stomach. The patients should be in structed to refrain from eating and drinking (except for water 
and any other prescribed medications), for two hours before and one hour after each dose. It is 
recommended that each dose of MLN0128 be given orally with 8 ounces (240 mL) of water. 
Missed or vomited dose should not be made up. If patient forgets MLN0128 dose until after 6:00 
pm, he/she should wait until the next day. If the patient vomits MLNM0128 after taking and whole 
capsule is visible in the vomitus, replacement capsule should be taken, ot herwise the dose should 
not be re -administered, and patient should simply adhere to the dosing schedule and resume dosing 
at the next scheduled time with the prescribed dosage. Under no circumstance should a patient 
repeat a dose or double -up doses.

11. BIOMARKER STUDIES  
We plan to analyze the p4EBP1, PSK6, pCAD and Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV) Large T 
antigen (LT) and small T antigen (ST) of patients’ biopsy -tumors pre -treatment and correlate with 
treatment benefit. Original archival biopsy can be used instead of the fresh biopsy at baseline, if 
enough tissue is available, otherwise those with easily accessible tumor tissue from minimally 
invasive biopsy sites (e.g. superficial nodes, cutaneous lesions, bone biopsies, superficial soft 
tissue, abdomi nal ascites and pleural effusions) will be eligible for these biopsies. Formalin fixed 
paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples will be scored for p4EBP1, PSK6, pCAD and MCV LT and 
ST. Clinical efficacy of MLN0128 treatment will then be correlated to high and low expressing 
levels pre -treatment. Upon progression of disease, patients will be asked to provide another biopsy 
(if easily accessible, through minimally invasive procedure) to repeat the above correlative studies. 
This biopsy will be optional and not a requ irement to participate on this study.  
MCC  sample processing  
All MCC tumor specimens have been handled by [CONTACT_488455], in 
Dermatology.  A protocol is already in place to request tumor blocks and whole blood for research 
purposes. This mig ht be the best way to coordinate this study with earlier MCC studies. MCC 
specimens will have reviewed by [CONTACT_488456] (IHC) stains for CK20.  
FFPE blocks of MCC tumor specimens will be requested and delivered to the DF/HCC Specialized 
Histopathology Services Core facility at Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The BWH core or 
another laboratory will perform IHC from MCC specimens and will prepare section s or cores to 
extract DNA.  
IHC 
Staining will be performed in non -CLIA format by [CONTACT_488457]. Five unstained [ADDRESS_627561] response to treatment. In case archival biopsy 
sample is not available, patients would be asked for an optional fresh tumor biopsy sample during 
screening and at progression. Whole exome sequencing will be performed/coordinated at Broad 
Institute. The goal is to obtain 100 -500ng of genomic DNA from FFPE blocks. To obtain sufficient 
amount of DNA, we need on e of the following:  
Protocol #: Original  
Version Date: April 15, 2015

b) 2-3 30 micron scrolls (3 ideal)  
c) 2 x 1mm cores or equivalent (3 x 0.6mm cores, 1 x 2mm core, etc)  
In addition, one tube of whole blood (frozen at – 80°C or fresh) needed for isolation o f normal 
blood.  
12. STUDY CALENDAR

condition is deteri orating, laboratory evaluations should be repeated within [ADDRESS_627563] be performed prior to administration of study agent. Study assessments and 
agent should be administered within + [ADDRESS_627564] 3 
patients. This evaluation can also be ob tained from DFCI protocol 14 -223 (PHASE II STUDY OF 
MLN0128 IN THYROID CANCER), which has the same trial design and the same experimental 
agent under investigation, for thyroid cancer patients. Therefore, for example, if there have been [ADDRESS_627565], and then documented in the patient’s visit note. These patients will be closely 
monitored with weekly visits for 4 weeks, with the following p rocedures performed at each weekly 
visit (+/ - 3 days): PE, concurrent medication assessment, vital status, weight, AE assessment, 
performance status, and fasting lab tests which include CBC w/ diff, serum chemistry, phosphorus, 
LDH, PT/INR, PTT, and urinal ysis. After completing the 4 week safety monitoring period, these 
patients will then resume the protocol required visit schedule.

For the purposes of this study, participants should be re -evaluated for response every 8 weeks.  In 
addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be obtained 8 weeks following initia l 
documentation of objective response.  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_8225] (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) 
[Eur J Ca 45:228 -247, 2009].   Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of 
the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the 
RECIST criteria.  
13.1.[ADDRESS_627572] their response classified ac cording to the definitions stated below.  
Protocol #: Original  
Version Date: April 15, 2015  
52 (Note:  Participants who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 
will also be considered evaluable.)  
Evaluable Non -Target Disease Response .  Participants who have lesions present at basel ine 
that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at 
least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated will be considered 
evaluable for non -target disease.  The response assessment is based on the  presence, 
absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.   
13.1.[ADDRESS_627573] one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as  [ADDRESS_627574] be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
Note: Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or might not  be 
considered measurable.  
Malignant lymph nodes.   To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be [ADDRESS_627575] scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only 
the short axis will be measured and followed.  
Non-measurable disease .  All other lesions (or sites of diseas e), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with 10 to <15 mm short axis), 
are considered non -measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmon itis, inflammatory breast disease, 
abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), and cystic lesions are all considered 
nonmeasurable.  
Note: Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should 
not be considered as malignan t lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they 
are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. Ho wever, if noncystic 
lesions are present in the same participant, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
Target lesions.   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved org ans, should be identified as target lesions 
and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of 
their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but 
in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It 
may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible 
Protocol #: Original  
Version Date: April 15, [ADDRESS_627576] lesion which can be measured 
reproducibly should be  selected. A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, 
short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the 
baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short 
axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further 
characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.   
Non-target lesions .  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measura ble lesions 
over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non -target lesions and should 
also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the 
presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted 
throughout follow up.   
13.1.3 Methods for Evaluation of Disease  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler, calipers, 
or a digital measurement tool.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as close ly as 
possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning 
of the treatment.  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize

evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being 
followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
Clinical lesions. Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and 10 mm in diameter as 
assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by 
[CONTACT_164943], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.   
Chest x -ray. Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are  
clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]; however, CT is preferable.  
Conventional C T and MRI. This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan 
based on the assumption that CT thickness is 5mm or less. If CT scans have slice thickness 
greater than 5 mm, the minimum size of a measurable lesion should be twice the slice 
thickn ess. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans).    
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which 
greatl y impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the 
availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical 
specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation  of the 
type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow -up should 
Protocol #: Original  
Version Date: April 15, 2015  
54 be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the 
same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines t o prescribe specific 
MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the 
same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed 
as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans should  be performed with breath -hold 
scanning techniques, if possible.  
FDG -PET/CT Imaging.    
Patient Preparation  
Patients should avoid any strenuous exercise for [ADDRESS_627577] a fasting blood  
 200 mg/dL prior to FDG injection. An attempt should be initially made to  
control the blood glucose level, which will require the rescheduling of the injection. If the 
glucose level cannot be controlled (i.e. > 200 mg/dL), the patient will not be included in 
the FDG -PET/CT imaging. Patients should be adequately hydrated with pla in water. 
Weight (kg), height (cm), and blood glucose (mg/dL) will be measured and recorded prior 
to the injection of FDG. Sedation (alprazolam, 0.5 -1 mg, po, 30 minutes pre -FDG 
injection) is allowed, but not mandatory and should be used consistently by [CONTACT_3433] e patient for 
all scans. Filgrastim, pegfilgrastim, and epoetin are known to affect FDG uptake, and their 
use by [CONTACT_488459]. Patients should wait in a warm room to avoid false 
positive brown fat FDG uptake. Patients will lie supi[INVESTIGATOR_105683] a  quiet room during the FDG 
uptake period. FDG will be synthesized and prepared in accordance with the institution’s 
standard procedures or obtained from a commercial supplier.  
FDG Dosing and Administration  
The administered activity of FDG should be based on the PET/CT system manufacturer’s 
recommendation. The recommended FDG dose is 0.14 -0.21 mCi/kg. The actual FDG dose 
should be a bolus of 8 -20 mCi, followed by a saline flush (per institutional procedure). 
Preinjection FDG Syringe dose, FDG dose injected and Post -injection FDG dose residual 
and corresponding time should be documented.  
FDG -PET/CT Imaging Acquisition    
Whole body PET/CT acquisition at both pre -therapy (baseline) and on follow ups MUST 
start 70 (± 10) minutes after FDG injection. The timing should stay the same for followup 
PET/CT scans from the baseline (no more than a ± 10 minute difference). It is critical that 
follow -up PET/CT scans will be performed in an identical way to the baseline scan, with 
the same scanner, same scan direction (sku ll to thighs or thighs to skull), and consistent 
arm positioning (arms up or arms down). Preferably, schedule the patient for both baseline 
and follow -up scans at the same time of day (AM or PM) to improve reproducibility. The 
field of view is to encompass  the region between the scalp and toes. Patient will be scanned 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_488437], if possible. Oral and/or IV 
contrast is optional. Patient should empty his/her bladder immediately before the 
acquisition of images. For  the emission scanning, the acquisition should be performed in 
2D or 3D mode in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations. The emission 
Protocol #: Original  
Version Date: April 15, [ADDRESS_627578] be corrected for scatter, random events, and dead -time losses using the 
manufacturer’s recommended pr ocedure. The image reconstruction will be performed 
using the manufacturer recommended parameters. Images should be attenuation corrected 
using CT data (note that if IV contrast is used, blood FDG SUV may be altered; therefore 
attenuation correction must b e done without contrast).  
13.1.4 Response Criteria  
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 m m.  
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
Progressive Disease (PD) :  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as re ference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum 
if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum 
must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of 
one or more n ew lesions is also considered progressions).  
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study.  
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Non -Target L esions  
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization 
of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm 
short axis).  
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize 
for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenance 
of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or m ore new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non -target lesions.  Unequivocal progression should not 
normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall disease status 
change, not a single lesion increase.     
Protocol #: Original  
Version Date: April 15, 2015  
56 Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_343], and the progression status 
should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal Investigator).  
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of New Lesions  
The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal (i.e. not due to difference in 
scanning technique, imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something 
other than tumor (for example, some ‘new’ bone lesions may  be simply healing or flare 
of pre -existing lesions). However, a lesion identified on a follow -up scan in an 
anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered new and will indicate 
PD. If a new lesion is equivocal (because of small size et c.), follow -up evaluation will 
clarify if it truly represents new disease and if PD is confirmed, progression should be 
declared using the date of the initial scan on which the lesion was discovered.  
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best  overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment 
until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best 
response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and 
confirmation criteria.

13.1.5 Duration of Response  
Duration of overall response :  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date 
that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for 
progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, or 
death due to any cause. Participants without events reported are censored at the last disease 
evaluation).  
Duration of overall complete response : The duration of overall CR is measured from the 
time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease 
is objectively documented, or death due to any cause. Participants without events reported 
are censored at the la st disease evaluation.  
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until 
the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded 
since the treatment started, including the bas eline measurements.  
13.1.6 Progression -Free Survival  
Overall Survival : Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization (or 
registration) to death due to any cause, or censored at date last known alive.  
Progression -Free Survival : Progression -Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from 
randomization (or registration) to the earlier of progression or death due to any cause. 
Participants alive without disease progression are censored at date of last disease 
evaluation.  
Time to Progression : Time to Progression (TTP) is defined as the time from randomization 
(or registration) to progression, or censored at date of last disease evaluation for those 
without progression reported.  
14. DATA REPORTING / REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS  
Protocol #: Original  
Version Date: April 15, [ADDRESS_627580], manage, and perform quality checks on the data for this study.  
14.2 Data Safety Monitoring  
The DF/HCC Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will review and monitor toxicity 
and accrual data from this st udy. The committee is composed of clinical specialists with experience 
in oncology and who have no direct relationship with the study. Information that raises any 
questions about participant safety will be addressed with the Overall PI [INVESTIGATOR_36749].  
The DSMC will review each protocol up to four times a year or more often if required to review 
toxicity and accrual data. Information to be provided to the committee may include: up -to-date 
participant accrual; current dose level information; DLT information;  all grade [ADDRESS_627581] been reported; summary of all deaths occurring with 30 days 
of intervention for Phase I or II protocols; for gene therapy protocols, summary of all deaths while 
being treated and during active foll ow-up; any response information; audit results, and a summary 
provided by [CONTACT_3476]. Other information (e.g. scans, laboratory values) will be provided 
upon request.   
15. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
15.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
Phase I Component   
The MTD of MLN0128 will be determined using a standard 3+3 dose escalation design with three 
doses (3, 4, and 5 mg QD) and six patients treated at the proposed MTD. In the dose escalation 
design, [ADDRESS_627582] been exceeded. Patients will 
be treated through the two cycles for DLT assessment.  
With this esc alation strategy, the table below gives the probability of escalation as a function of 
the true underlying DLT rate for a variety of true rates. There will be 6 patients treated at the MTD 
before moving to the phase II component of the study. That is, if o nly 3 patients had been treated 
at the recommended dose, a second cohort of 3 patients will be added. The phase I component of

Version Date: April 15, 2015  
60 this study will therefore accrue a potential total of 18 patients. See also section 7.3 for additional 
details on the dose escala tion design, proposed dosing and definition of DLT.  
True rate of DLT  10%  20%  30%  40%  50%  60%  70% 
Probability of escalation  .91 .71 .49 .31 .17 .08 .03 
Phase II Component   
The primary objective of this trial is to assess MLN0128 activity in patients with 
recurrent/metastatic MCC. MLN0128 will be considered an active drug for recurrent/metastatic 
MCC if there is evidence that the true objective response rate is at least 40% ( against a null of 10% 
in this heterogeneous population). We will adopt a two -stage design in this study whereby [CONTACT_488460] [ADDRESS_627583] the null hypothesis. We will consider MLN0128 to be 
an active drug in this patient population.   
With this design, the probability of concluding  the proposed treatment is promising is 0.91 if the 
true but unknown response rate is 40% (power) but 0.06 if the true disease control rate is 10% 
(type I error). The probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_488438] 53%. The operating 
characteris tics of this design are calculated using the exact binomial distribution.  
Progression -free (PFS), disease control rate (DCR) and overall survival (OS) of patients receiving 
MLN0128 for MCC will be described using the method of Kaplan and Meier. Survival a nd 90% 
confidence intervals for OS and PFS will be reported, although the precision for these estimates is 
expected to be low given the small sample size, hence these analyses will be largely descriptive.  
Toxicity is an important secondary endpoint. Assumi ng the trial moves to the second stage, with 
[ADDRESS_627584] 56% probability of observing one or more rare (5% true 
probability) events, and over 90% probability of observing toxicities that have a true occurrence 
of at least 14%. A 9 0% two -sided exact binomial confidence interval on any given adverse event 
rate will be no wider than 45 percentage points.  
Continuous Toxicity Monitoring:   Due to anticipated treatment -related toxicities, continuous 
monitoring of serious treatment -related toxicities will be performed. The study will be terminated 
early if excessive incidence of treatment related toxicity is observed.  
15.2 Sample Size, Accru al Rate and Study Duration  
The planned sample size is 6 -34 patients total. The anticipated annual accrual is approximately 6 
patients. The anticipated period of active accrual is expected to be 24 -36 months depending upon 
the enrollment required for the ph ase I component.

64 APPENDIX B  INFORMATION ON POSSIBLE DRUG INTERACTIONS  
MLN0128 is metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2C19, CYP3A4, and CYP2C9.  
There are no known strong specific CYP2C9 inhibitors or inducers. Examples of moderate 
inhibitors of CYP2C9 are fluconazole and miconazole; moderate inducers of CYP2C9 are 
carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_423096]. These agents show some degree of overlap with their modu lation of 
CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 activity and should hence be considered with similar caution.  
Strong inhibitors of CYP2C19 include fluconazole, fluvoxamine, omeprazole, and ticlopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325]. 
Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 include ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavi r, mibefradil, indinavir, 
and clarithromycin. Strong inducers of CYP3A4 include phenobarbital, phenytoin, 
carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], St. John’s wort, and rifampin (also a moderate CYP2C19 inducer).

preparation -dependent.  Studies have shown that it can be classified as a “strong CYP3A 
inhibitor” when a certain preparation was used (eg, high dose, double strength) or as a 
“moderate CYP3A inhibitor” when another preparatio n was used (eg, low dose, single 
strength).

 1 1  PROTOCOL SUMMARY 1.1 SYNOPSIS  Title:  Pharmacist Provision of Medication Abortion Pi[INVESTIGATOR_813491]: A pi[INVESTIGATOR_813492] [ADDRESS_1126521] provision of medication abortion in the future.     Aims: 1. To pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] a toolkit for pharmacist provision of medication abortion.  2. To understand patient and provider satisfaction with pharmacist provision of medication abortion.     Study Population: Patients desiring a medication abortion   Description of Sites Enrolling Participants: University of [LOCATION_004], San Diego (UCSD)    Study Duration: 1 year  Participant Duration: [ADDRESS_1126522] provision of medication abortion in the future.   2.2 BACKGROUND  Approximately 90% of counties in the [LOCATION_002] do not have a single clinic offering abortion care, and 39% of women ages 15-[ADDRESS_1126523], more than 90% of Americans live within [ADDRESS_1126524] expanded evening hours and are open to patients on the weekends. Although the overall abortion rate in the [LOCATION_002] has decreased, the proportion of abortions that are medication abortion has increased from 5% of all abortions in 2001 to 39% of all abortions in 2017.1    With the goal of increasing access to medication abortions, a sample protocol for “no touch” medication abortion was recently published, which includes recommendations for appropriate patient selection, Rh evaluation, treatment regimen and follow up care.[ADDRESS_1126525] safely provided care in other aspects of reproductive health in the U.S. including provision of hormonal contraception.7  Pharmacy dispensing of medication abortion drugs from pharmacies  in Australia has led to improved access to medication abortion, specifically in rural areas.8 Pharmacists regularly review prescriptions to ensure safety and efficacy in addition to providing patient counseling.  Recently a study in [LOCATION_004] and Washington states, including UCSD as a site, investigated the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of pharmacy dispensing of mifepristone. This study used qualitative surveys to explore pharmacists’ perspectives on dispensing mifepristone.[ADDRESS_1126526] Provision of Medication Abortion Pi[INVESTIGATOR_813490] 210175  
 3 Provision of medication abortion in pharmacies could lead to increased access to medication abortion in the [LOCATION_002] especially in rural areas without physician or other abortion providers.12   2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT    2.3.1 KNOWN POTENTIAL RISKS  Potential medical risks to medication abortion patients participating in the study are the same as those they would incur by [CONTACT_54215] a medication abortion outside of the study. However, this study will determine eligibility of gestational age by [CONTACT_102]’s last menstrual period without confirmation by [CONTACT_813502]. This is sometimes done in clinical practice and supported by [CONTACT_790178].  However, there is a risk that any patient who does not complete an ultrasound could undergo medication abortion beyond [ADDRESS_1126527] discovered that less than 1% of patients who are certain of their last menstrual period present at gestational ages beyond their reported dating by [CONTACT_190068].16 Additionally, the mifepristone and misoprostol regimen included in this protocol has been shown to be safe and effective to 77 days gestational age, allowing for the possibility of a small underestimate in dating.17  In addition, there is potential risk of loss of confidentiality. Other risks to consider include:  1. Pain experienced during medication abortion 2. Heavy vaginal bleeding 3. Known side effects of mifepristone/misoprostol including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and headache 4. Unknown risks  These risks are related to the medication abortion and not unique to provision by [CONTACT_813503], there is a risk of emotional discomfort. Interviews will be performed in a private room. Patients and pharmacists will have the option to decline to answer any questions or to stop the interview at any point. Additionally, patients will be offered additional mental health and wellbeing resources such as social work referral or connection to the All-Options support line.   2.3.[ADDRESS_1126528] a ‘proof of concept’ pi[INVESTIGATOR_813493] a previously created toolkit4, followed by [INVESTIGATOR_2993]-depth interviews with the patients and the pharmacists providing their care to understand their experiences. We will be adapting an existing toolkit, created by [CONTACT_65570], to assist primary care providers in their provision of medication abortion13. The toolkit will be finalized following analysis of pharmacist interviews assessing the acceptability and feasibility of pharmacist provision of medication abortion. These interviews and subsequent toolkit adaptations will take place under a separate IRB application. The final toolkit is expected to contain the no test protocol to be followed; medication abortion basics, such as information on mifepristone restrictions and appropriate patient criteria and selection; tools to assist in setting up abortion care clinics; implementation guidance, such as guidance on dispensing and distributing medications; protocols for follow up of patients receiving abortion care; and additional considerations, such as local abortion laws and restrictions. We will recruit patients calling to schedule medication abortion at the University of [LOCATION_004], San Diego (UCSD) Family Planning Clinics. We have one central scheduler for the Division of Family Planning at UCSD, who has been trained in and is responsible for phone recruitment for studies.  This scheduler has experience discussing patients’ preferred method of abortion. Patients will be offered participation in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_813494] a pharmacist. The visits with the pharmacist will take place in a private room within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-affiliated outpatient clinical pharmacy at the UCSD outpatient clinic in the same building as the family planning physicians provide medication abortion in the Women’s Health clinic.  The goal for recruitment is [ADDRESS_1126529] misoprostol dose. For pain control, 20 tablets of 600 mg Ibuprofen will be dispensed and 20 tablets of 650mg Acetaminophen will be provided.  Patient’s will be instructed to alternate the Ibuprofen and Tylenol, with each medication take each medication 6 hours apart from itself.   In congruency with a “no test” protocol published by [CONTACT_813504], Rh typi[INVESTIGATOR_813495]-D immunoglobulin will not be performed if the patient reports a positive Rh type, if the patient does not desire future childbearing or if the patient declines. For all other patients, they will be offered Rh typi[INVESTIGATOR_813496]-D immunoglobulin as indicated. The blood typi[INVESTIGATOR_813497]. Patient participants will be provided with two high sensitivity urine pregnancy tests to be used four weeks after the abortion as well as a patient instruction sheet that will include symptoms for which to call their abortion provider. These symptoms will include severe pain, pain not responsive to provided analgesics, bleeding soaking 2 maxi pads an hour for two consecutive hours, multiple clots the size of an egg or greater, dizziness or vomiting lasting more than 2 hours, an increase in bleeding or pain 24 hours after taking the misoprostol, fever of 100.4°F or higher [ADDRESS_1126530] for oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], contraceptive rings, the contraceptive patch or Depo Provera. Patient electing for intrauterine devices, contraceptive implants or sterilization will be scheduled for an appointment with a physician. Participants will be reimbursed a $[ADDRESS_1126531] method for follow up supported by [CONTACT_252109].14  If the participant’s first high sensitivity urine pregnancy test is positive but they have no symptoms concerning

UCSD has an established history of CPAs across a variety of clinical services including HIV care, anticoagulation and transplant medicine. Under the agreement with a supervising physician, pharmacists can prescribe provide care for specified conditions.  CPAs are utilized in some form in all states except for Delaware, and [ADDRESS_1126533] provision of medication abortion in the future. We will follow a prepared interview guide (See Appendix A and Appendix B) The interviews will be analyzed using directed content analysis.  4.[ADDRESS_1126534] meet the following inclusion criteria:  1.

Any contraindications to medication abortion, as reported on their medical history. These contraindicated include:  a) Hemorrhagic bleeding disorder b) Current anticoagulation therapy c) Chronic adrenal failure d) Long-term systemic corticosteroid therapy e) Inherited porphyria d) Allergy to misoprostol or mifepristone 2. Any patient with complex medical conditions will also be excluded from this initial pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]. These medical conditions include:  a) Poorly controlled hypertension as defined a history of systolic blood pressure >160 or diastolic blood pressure >[ADDRESS_1126537] exclusion criteria for medication abortion   b) Poorly controlled diabetes as defined by a known history of Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes with history of finger stick blood sugar >200 or HbA1c>[ADDRESS_1126538] exclusion criteria for medication abortion   c) Hepatic or renal failure d) History of solid organ transplant e) 4 or more cesarean sections f) Allergy to NSAIDs.   5.3 SCREEN FAILURES For individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this trial (screen failure) due to not meeting eligibility requirements, they will be schedule within one week in a UCSD Family Planning physician clinic for pregnancy evaluation and options counseling. No identifying information will be collected from screen failures.

If the second, high sensitivity urine pregnancy test is also positive, the patient will be evaluated by a physician and ultrasound or serial serum HCGs will be utilized if indicated.     
Pharmacist Provision of Medication Abortion Pi[INVESTIGATOR_813490] [ADDRESS_1126544] (DSMB) is not planned for this small pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. 8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  8.3.1 DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS (AE) The FDA definition of an Adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an intervention in humans, whether or not considered intervention-related (21 CFR 312.32 (a)).   8.3.2 DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE)  An adverse event (AE) or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.   8.3.3 CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT  [IP_ADDRESS] SEVERITY OF EVENT For adverse events (AEs) not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines will be used to describe severity.   • Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily activities.  • Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning. • Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life-threatening or incapacitating.  Of note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”.   [IP_ADDRESS] RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION All adverse events (AEs) must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_61186]/her clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. In a clinical trial, the study product must always be suspect.   • Related – The AE is known to occur with the study intervention, there is a reasonable possibility that the study intervention caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study intervention and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study intervention and the AE. 
Pharmacist Provision of Medication Abortion Pi[INVESTIGATOR_813490] 210175  
 10 • Not Related – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study intervention caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study intervention and event onset, or an alternate etiology has been established.  OR  • Definitely Related – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to study intervention administration and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_9153]. The response to withdrawal of the study intervention (DE challenge) should be clinically plausible. The event must be pharmacologically or phenomenologically definitive, with use of a satisfactory rechallenge procedure if necessary. • Probably Related – There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs within a reasonable time after administration of the study intervention, is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). Rechallenge information is not required to fulfill this definition. • Potentially Related – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication). However, other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant events). Although an AE may rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it can be flagged as requiring more information and later be upgraded to “probably related” or “definitely related”, as appropriate. • Unlikely to be related – A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose temporal relationship to study intervention administration makes a causal relationship improbable (e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the study intervention) and in which other drugs or chemicals or underlying disease provides plausible explanations (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments). • Not Related – The AE is completely independent of study intervention administration, and/or evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There must be an alternative, definitive etiology documented by [CONTACT_15370].   [IP_ADDRESS] EXPECTEDNESS   The PI [INVESTIGATOR_21190] (AE) is expected or unexpected.  An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study intervention. 8.3.4 TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW-UP  The occurrence of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study participant presenting for medical care, by [CONTACT_187334], or upon review by a study monitor.  
Pharmacist Provision of Medication Abortion Pi[INVESTIGATOR_813490] 210175  
 11 All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured. Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_8703] a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE. Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  At each study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit.  Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  8.3.5 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING   All adverse events will be reported to th UCSD IRB. The management of information that is relevant to the protection of participants including adverse events, UPRs, protocol violations/deviations, interim results and protocol modifications will be the responsibility of the PI.  8.3.6 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING   All serious adverse events will be reported to th UCSD IRB. The management of information that is relevant to the protection of participants including adverse events, UPRs, protocol violations/deviations, interim results and protocol modifications will be the responsibility of the PI.  8.3.7 REPORTING EVENTS TO PARTICIPANTS   The UCSD IRB provide guidance to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_187324].   8.4 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  8.4.1 DEFINITION OF UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UP)  Unanticipated problems involving risks to participants or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  • Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol-related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the participant population being studied; • Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and 
Pharmacist Provision of Medication Abortion Pi[INVESTIGATOR_813490] 210175  
 12 • Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.   8.4.2  UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM REPORTING   The investigators will report unanticipated problems (UPs) to the reviewing Institutional Review Board (IRB) and to the lead principal investigator (PI). The UP report will include the following information:  • Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project number; • A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;  • An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome represents an UP;  • A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or are proposed in response to the UP.  To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported to the IRB within reasonable timing of the investigator becoming aware of the problem.     8.4.3 REPORTING UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS TO PARTICIPANTS   The IRB at each site will provide guidance to PIs on informing participants regarding UPs as needed.   9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES Not applicable  9.2 SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION The sample size (N=10) was chose as a sample of convenience as this was a proof concept pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]  9.3 POPULATIONS FOR ANALYSES All patients (N=10) will be included in the single sample   9.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  9.4.1 GENERAL APPROACH  9.4.2 ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT(S)  Participants will be contact[CONTACT_813505].

If the second, high sensitivity urine pregnancy test is also positive, the patient will be evaluated by a physician and ultrasound or serial serum HCGs will be utilized if indicated.    9.4.3 ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S) Following completion of study recruitment and patient visits, we will continue our study by [CONTACT_74394]-depth semi-structured interviews with the participating patients and pharmacists to understand their experiences. The interviews will be analyzed using directed content analysis. 9.4.4 SAFETY ANALYSES  AEs and SAEs will be recorded by [CONTACT_187335]. Adverse events leading to premature discontinuation from the study intervention and serious treatment-emergent AEs will be presented in a table.  9.4.5 BASELINE DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS  Not applicable   9.4.6 PLANNED INTERIM ANALYSES  Interim analyses are not planned during this short pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].    10 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS  10.1 REGULATORY, ETHICAL, AND STUDY OVERSIGHT CONSIDERATIONS  10.1.1 STUDY DISCONTINUATION AND CLOSURE This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable cause.  Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be provided by [CONTACT_21224], investigator and funding agency. If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Principal Investigator (PI) will promptly inform study participants, the Institutional Review Board (IRB), and sponsor and will provide the reason(s) for the termination or suspension.  Study participants will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], as applicable, and be informed of changes to study visit schedule.   Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to: • Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants

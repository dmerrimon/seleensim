Title of Study: A Multicenter, Open-Label Study Evaluating the Safety, Tolerability, and 
Pharmacokinetics  of Brexanolone in the Treatment of Adolescent Female Subjects with Postpartum 
Depression  
Study center(s):  A global study at up to 50 sites  
Phase of development: 3 
Objectives:  
Primary Objective:  
• The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of brexanolone  when 
administered to adolescent female subjects diagnosed with [COMPANY_003].  
Secondary Objectives:  
• To assess the plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of brexanolone and, when appropriate, 
metabolites of brexanolone  
 
  
  
Methodology:  
In previous Versions 1 through 3 of this protocol, subjects were randomly assigned to active or 
placebo study drug  in a blinded manner. With the current Amendment 3/Version 4, the study has been 
converted to an open -label study where all subjects will receive brexano lone. 
This is a Phase 3, open-label study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and PK , of 
brexanolone  in adolescent  female subjects diagnosed (by [CONTACT_88188] -5 
Axis I Disorders [SCID -5]) with [COMPANY_003].  Subjects will be  administered a single, 60 -hour continuous IV 
infusion of brexanolone .

Version 4.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
 6 Screening Period:   
The Screening Period begins with the informed consent process  at the Screening Visit, which can 
occur on any one calendar day of a 14-day window (from Day -14 through Day -1, inclusive).  
Subjects will undergo procedures at the Screening Visit to determine eligibility, including completion 
of the  
Treatment Period:   
The Treatment Period is the period from the start of the assessments on Day 1 prior to initiation of 
brexanolone  through the 72-hour assessments on Day 3 . The 60-hour infusion will be administered as 
follows: 30 mcg/kg/hour (Hour 0 to 4), then 60 mcg/kg/hour (Hour 4 to 24), then 90 mcg/kg/hour 
(Hour 24 to 52), followed by 60  mcg/kg/hour (Hour 52 to 56), and 30 mcg/kg/hour (Hour 56 to 60).  
A programmable perist altic infusion pump will be used to ensure accurate delivery of  brexanolone . 
Due to the risk of excessive sedation and sudden loss of consciousness, for the duration of the 
infusion, subjects will be monitored for hypoxia using continuous pulse oximetry equipped wi th an 
alarm, and will be assessed for excessive sedation by a healthcare provider every [ADDRESS_266673] be 
accompanied during any interaction s with their child(ren) that occur during the infusion.  
If excessive sedation occurs at any time during the infusion, the infusion will be stopped until the 
symptoms resolve. The infusion may be resumed a t the same or lower dose as clinically appropriate. 
The infusion will be i mmediately stopped if pulse oximetry reveals hypoxia. After an epi[INVESTIGATOR_221908], the infusion should not be resumed.  Subjects will remain confined through the completion of 
the brexanolone infusion  and Hour [ADDRESS_266674].  
Safety and efficacy assessments will be performed as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments  (Table 
2); blood samples will be collected and will be ana lyzed for concentrations of brexanolone  and may 
be analyzed for concentrations of brexanolone metabolites.   
Follow-up Period:  Follow-up visits will be conducted through Day 30. Psychiatric review for 
worsening symptoms of depression will be available during the study and psychiatric follow -up after 
the end of the study will be arranged as needed by [CONTACT_221923].  
An independent data safety monitoring boa rd will monitor the clinical data for safety signals 
throughout the study. In order to perform their monitoring function , the board will have access to all 
safety data as necessary.  
Number of subjects (planned):  
Qualified subjects 15 to 17 years old (inclusive) will be enrolled in the study. Enrollment will 
continue until approximately  [ADDRESS_266675] been treated  with brexanolone . The planned sample 
size of 20  includes those subjects who received brexanolone as blinded study  drug during earlier 
versions of the protocol when the study  was a randomized , double-blind, placebo-controlled study.

 20 5. INTRODUCTION  
5.1. Background of Postpartum Depression and Unmet Medical Need  
Postpartum depression  ([COMPANY_003]) is a serious mood disorder estimated to affect approximately 10 to 
20 percent of women giving birth globally. In the U nited States , estimates of new mothers 
identified with [COMPANY_003] each year vary by [CONTACT_221924] 8 to 20 percent with an overall average of 11.5 
percent (Ko et al 2017 ). Postpartum depression is defined in both the International Classification 
of Diseases (ICD) -10 and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual  of Mental Disorders ( DSM-5 2013) 
as a major depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_221910] . 
[COMPANY_003] often co-occurs with anxiety.  [COMPANY_003] is a leading cause of maternal mortality ( Savitz 2011)  
and, by [CONTACT_221925], poses serious risks to the emotional, cognitive, 
behavioral, and physical development of the in fant and siblings ( CPS 2004 ; Noorlander 2008 ).  
Findings from several studies implicate that peripartum fluctuations in reproductive hormones 
(in particular, the major progesterone metabolite , allopregnanolone) have a pi[INVESTIGATOR_221911]. There is no evidence that the pathophysiology of [COMPANY_003] in 
adolescents differs from that in adults.  
Current standard of care for [COMPANY_003] includes pharmacological therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] , most often antidepressants 
approved for major depressive d isorder (MDD) , combined with counseling, behavioral, and other 
nonpharmacological interventions (Altshuler 2001 ). While tricyclic antidepressants and/or 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors  (SSRIs) are both commonly used, SSRIs tend to be 
preferred due to better safety data while breastfeeding ( Altshuler 2001). However, the evidence 
for efficacy of MDD antidepressants in [COMPANY_003] is generally based on data from the MDD 
population ( Austin 2013 ). Limited randomized data are available evaluating the effectiveness of 
MDD antidepressants in [COMPANY_003] (De Crescenzo, 2014 ). Thus, based on the level of available 
evidence, there is a considerable need for improved pharmacological therapy for [COMPANY_003].   
Allopregnanolone  is a potent positive allosteric m odulator of synaptic and extrasynaptic 
γ-aminobutyric acid -ligand gated chloride channel ( GABA A) receptors. Plasma allopregnanolone 
concentrations rise in concert with progesterone throughout pregnancy, reaching the highest 
physiological concentrations in the third trimester  (Maguire 2009). After childbirth, these 
concentrations decrease abruptly ( Nappi 2001 ). Failure of GABA A receptors to adapt to these 
changes at parturition has been postulated to have a role in tr iggering postpartum  depression 
(Maguire 2008). Allopregnanolone and pharmacologically similar compounds have been shown 
to have profound effects on anxiety and depression in animal models ( Paul 1992; Maguire 2008 ). 
5.2. Brexanolone  
The brexanolone  drug product is a proprietary formulation of brexanolone drug substance (also 
referred to as allopregnanolone ) and excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  Allopregnanolone is an endogenous, naturally 
occurring neuroactive steroid formed in the corpus luteum of the ovary, adrenal cortex, and 
central nervous system ( Holzbauer 1985; Paul 1992; Ottander 2005 ). Allopregnanolone  is a 
metabolite of progesterone created by [CONTACT_221926] 5 -α reductase and 3 -α hydroxy -steroid 
dehydrogenase. Allopregnanolone is a potent positive allosteric modulator of both synaptic and 
extra-synaptic GABA A receptors.   
Protocol 547 -[COMPANY_003]-304 Sage Therapeutics  
Version 4.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
21 Nonclinical toxicology studie s largely illustrate the se dative and anesthetic effects of 
allopregnanolone and/o r brexanolone at high er equivalent doses t han the proposed dose for the 
cur
rent study. Pharmacokinetic data in animals indicate a short half-life of brexanolo ne and rapid 
clearance with a moderate volume of distribut ion and cerebral levels higher than plasma. Clinical 
evidence to date demonstrates a clinically meaningful improvement in depressive symptoms in 
subjects with [COMPANY_003] following a 60-hour i nfusion of brexanolone compar ed with placebo. 
Brexanolone (brand name [CONTACT_221942]) was ap
proved by [CONTACT_221927] 19 March 2019 for the treatment of [COMPANY_003] in adults. Refer to the Investigator’ s 
Brochure for detailed description of clinical and nonclinical studies with brexanolone. 
5.3. Dose Justification  
Sage has completed three placebo -controlled studies of brexanolone in adult women with [COMPANY_003] , 
all of which demonstrated statistical improvement in de pressive symptoms for brexanolone as 
compared with placebo (see Investigator’s Brochure ). All three studies employed a maintenance 
dose of 90 mcg/kg/h and this dose was well tolerated. Because the 90 mcg/kg/h maintenance 
dose was safe and effective in adul t women with [COMPANY_003], this dose has been chosen for this study of 
brexanolone in adolescents with [COMPANY_003] .

 24 7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1. Overall Study Design 
In previous Versions 1 through 3 of this protocol, subjects were randomly assigned to active or 
placebo study drug  in a blinded manner. With the current Amendment 3/Version 4, the study has 
been converted to an open -label study where all subjects wi ll receive brexanolone .  
This is a Phase 3, open-label study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK , of 
brexanolone  in adolescent  female subjects diagnosed (by [CONTACT_88188] -
5 Axis I Disorders [SCID -5]) with [COMPANY_003].  Subjects will be administered a single , 60-hour 
continuous IV infusion  of brexanolone .  Each subject’s involvement is up to 47 days, including a 
maximum 14-day Screening Period, a 3 -day Treatment Period (60  hours of treatment and an 
additional 12 hours for completion of 72 -hour assessments), and a Follow -up Period  through Day 
30 (± 3 days). 
The Screening Period begins with the informed consent  process at the Screening Visit, which can 
occur on any one calendar day of a 14-day window (from Day -14 through Day  -1, inclusive ). 
Depending on age at screening and local regulations, subjects will either sign an informed 
consent form, or will sign an adolescent assent form and their parent/guardian will sign a 
parental informed consent form.  Subjects will undergo pr ocedures at the Screening Visit to 
determine eligibility, including completion of the . 
The Treatment Period is the period from the start of the  assessments on Day 1 prior to initiation 
of the brexanolone  intravenous (IV) infusion through the 72-hour assessments on Day 3. The 60-
hour infusion will be administered  as follows: 30 mcg/kg/hour (Hour 0 to 4), then 60 
mcg/kg/hour (Hour 4 to 24), then 90 mcg/kg/hour (Hour 24 to 52), followed by 60  mcg/kg/hour 
(Hour 52 to 56), and 30 mcg/kg/hour (Hour 56 to 60). A programmable peristaltic infusion pump 
will be used to ensure accurate delivery of brexanolone.  
Due to the risk of excessive sedation and sudden loss of consciousness, for the duration of the 
infusion, patients will be monitored for hypoxia us ing continuous pulse oximetry equipped with 
an alarm, and will be assessed for excessive sedation by a healthcare provider every [ADDRESS_266690] be accompanied dur ing any interactions with their child(ren) that occur during the infusion.  
If excessive sedation occurs at any time during the infusion, the infusion will be stopped until the 
symptoms resolve. The infusion may be resumed at the same or lower dose as clini cally 
appropriate. See Section  7.[ADDRESS_266691].  
Safety and efficacy assessments will be performed as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments  
(Table 2). Blood samples will be collected and will be ana lyzed for concentrations of 
brexanolone  and may be analyzed for concentrations of brexanolone metabolites.  
Follow-up visits will be conducted on Day 7, Day 14, Day 21, and Day 30.  Psychiatric review 
for worsening symptoms of depression will be available d uring the study and psychiatric follow -
up after the end of the study will be arranged as needed by [CONTACT_221928].  
An independent data safety monitoring board ( DSMB) will monitor the clinical  data for safety 
signals throughout the study. In order to perform their monitoring function , the DSMB will have 
access to all safety data as necessary.  
7.2. Number of Subjects  
Qualified subjects 15 to 17 years old (inclusive) will be enrolled in the study. Enrollment will 
continue un til approximately  [ADDRESS_266692] been treated  with brexanolone . The planned 
sample size of 20 i ncludes those subjects who received brexanolone as blinded study  drug during 
earlier versions of the protocol when  the study was a  randomized , double-blind, placebo-
controlled study.  
7.3. Treatment Assignment  
In this open -label study, subjects will be administered  a single, continuous, 60 -hour intravenous 
(IV) infusion  of brexanolone  starting on Day 1. 
7.4. Dose Adjustment Criteria  
If excessive sedation o ccurs at any time during the infusion, the infusion will be stopped until the 
symptoms resolve. The infusion may be resumed at the same or lower dose as clinically 
appropriate.  The infusion will be i mmediately stop ped if pulse oximetry reveals hypoxia. Aft er 
an epi[INVESTIGATOR_221912], the infusion should not be resumed.   
• For subjects who do not tolerate  the 90 mcg/kg/hour dose, a reduction to 60 
mcg/kg/hour may be considered  during the time period when the 90 mcg/kg/hour is 
scheduled to occur . 
Any sedation-related AEs that lead to dose interruption, termination, or reduction should be 
recorded as AEs of special interest (AESIs), and should be reported in an expedited manner as 
outlined in  Section 12.2.7. 
If other intolerable adverse events occur, the infusion will be stopped until the symptoms resolve. 
The infusion may be resumed at the same or lower dose as clinicall y appropriate . 
A plasma sample for PK analysis should be drawn at the time that the dose is adjusted or the 
pump is stopped.

12.1. Safety and Tolerability Assessments
Safety and tolerability of study drug  will be evaluated by [CONTACT_65102] -emergent 
adverse events  as well as  changes from baseline in vital signs measurements, clinical laboratory 
measures, ECGs, conco mitant medication usage, and    
The following assessments will be performed at the time  points specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 2). 
12.1.1.  Demographic/Medical History  
Medical history will be collected and listed by [CONTACT_1130]. Age, race, and ethnic origin will be 
recorded. The diagnosis of [COMPANY_003] will be determined using the SCID -5. Subjects will be 
specifically asked about the following depression , anxiety, and other  diagnoses  per DSM-5: 
generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive -compulsive disorder, panic disorder, posttraumatic stress 
disorder, major depressive disorder, persistent d epressive disorder, postpartum depression, 
bipolar disorder, seasonal affective disorder, psychotic depression, premenstrual dysphoric 
disorder, situational depression, atypi[INVESTIGATOR_221918] , menstrual migraine, other Axis 1 and Axis 2 
disorders, pregnancy h istory (including number of pregnancies, number of births, methods of 
delivery, and birth complications ) and [COMPANY_003] epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].    
12.1.2.  Vital Signs  
Vital signs include oral temperature (°C), respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], heart rate, and blood pressure. Heart 
rate and blood pressure to be collected in supi[INVESTIGATOR_221919] 2. 
Additionally, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], heart rate, and blood pressure  should be collected for any subject 
that experiences an AESI (defined in  Section 12.2.7) as soon as is feasible after  the onset of the 
event and recorded as unscheduled in the eCRF . Collection of vital signs should occur per local 
clinical practice , at a minimum until the subject regains consciousness . 
12.1.3.  Weight, Height and Body Mass Index  
Body weight and height will be measured ; body mass index will be programmatically calculated 
in the eCRF.   
12.1.4.  Physical Examination  
Physical examination s of major body systems will be undertaken and recorded . Any clinically 
significant finding  present at the post -screening physical examination that was not present at or 
worsened since the screening e xamination will be d ocumented as an  AE. Major body systems to 
be included in the screening physical examination  are head, eye, ear, nose and throat, heart, 
lungs, abdomen,  and extremities ; as well as cognitive and neurological examination , and mental 
status examination. Post-screening physical examinations may be symptom directed.  

Protocol [ADDRESS_266706] if the ECG is normal; 
abnormal, not clinically significant;  or abnormal, clinically significant (CS) . If Abnormal, details 
of the abnormality will be provided  (ie, first-degree AV block, bundle branch block) . The 
standard intervals (heart rate, PR, QRS, QT , and QTcF ) will be recorded  for all ECGs .   
12.1.6.  Laboratory Assessments  
Blood samples will be collected for hematology, serum chemistry, and coagulation. Analytes to 
be evaluated are summarized in Table 5.  
All blood samples will be sent to the central laboratory.  Subjects may be considered eligible for 
the study based on results reported by a local laboratory;  however, screening samples must also 
be sent to the central laboratory. Both local and central screening laboratories must adhere to the 
visit window provided in Table 2.

(fasting or non -fasting) 
All clinical laboratory test results outside the reference range will be interpreted by [CONTACT_7194], not clinically significant ; or abnormal, CS.  Screening results 
considered abnormal  and CS at the Screening Visit may make the subject ine ligible for the study 
pending review by [CONTACT_221930] . Clinically significant abnormal results 
after screening will be considered and reported as AEs.   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pregnancy Test  
All subjects will be tested for pregnancy by [CONTACT_221931].  Subjects may be considered eligible for the study based on serum pregnancy test results 
reported by a local laboratory; however, screening samples must also be sent to the central 
laboratory. Both local and central screening laboratories must adhere to the visit w indow 
provided in Table 2.   
Protocol [ADDRESS_266707]. In clinical studies, an AE can include an u ndesirable medical condition occurring at any 
time, including baseline or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered.  
A treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) is an AE that occurs after the first administration of 
any study drug .  The term study drug  includes any Sage Therapeutics study drug , a comparator, 
or a placebo administered in a clinical trial.  
Laboratory abnormalities and changes from baseline in vital signs (including ECGs) are 
considered AEs if they result in discontinuati on or interruption of study treatment, are clinically 
significant and require therapeutic medical intervention, meet protocol specific criteria (if 
applicable) and/or if the Investigator considers them to be clinically significant and adverse 
events. Labor atory values and vital signs that meet the criteria for a serious adverse event (SAE) 
should be reported in an expedited manner.  
Laboratory values and vital signs that are clearly attributable to another AE do not require 
discrete reporting (e.g. electrol yte disturbances in the context of dehydration, chemistry and 
hematologic disturbances in the context of sepsis, etc.) . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Serious Adverse Event  (SAE) 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose : 
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life -threatening  (Note: The term “life threatening ” refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an 
event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
An SAE may also be any other medically important event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], 
may jeopardize the subject or may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above.  (Examples of such events include allergic bronchosp asm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or convulsions occurring at home that do not require an 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).  
All SAEs that occur from the signing of the consent form(s)  through the end of study 
participation , whether or not th ey are related to the study drug, must be recorded on forms 
provided by [CONTACT_135482].  Serious adverse events occurring after the subject’s final study 
visit should be reported to the Sponsor or Sponsor’s designee only if the investigator considers 
the SAE to be related to study drug . 
A prescheduled or elective procedure or a routinely scheduled treatment will not be considered 
an SAE, even if the subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. The site must document all of the following:  
• The prescheduled or elective procedur e or routinely scheduled treatment was 
scheduled (or on a waiting list to be scheduled) prior to obtaining the subject’s 
consent to participate in the study.  
Protocol 547 -[COMPANY_003]-304 Sage Therapeutics  
Version 4.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
 41 • The condition requiring the prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled 
treatment wa s present before and did not worsen or progress, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_684], between the subject’s consent to participate in the study and at the time 
of the procedure or treatment.  
• The prescheduled or elective procedure or a routinely scheduled t reatment is the sole 
reason for the intervention or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063].  
If a subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_221920], the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_221921].  
12.2.2.  Relationship to Study Drug  
The Investigator  must make the determination of relationship to the study drug  for each AE (not 
related, possibly related or probably related).  The Investigator should decide whether, in his or 
her medical judgment, there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by 
[CONTACT_5257] . If no valid reason exists for suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be 
classified as “ not related.” If there is any valid reason, even if undetermined, for suspecting a 
possible cause -and-effect relationship between the study drug  and the occurrence of the AE, then 
the AE should be considered at least “possibly related.”   
 
Not 
Related: No relationship between  the experience  and the administration of study drug; related to 
other etiologies  such as concomitant medications or subject’s clinical state.  
Possibly 
Related: A reaction that follows a  plausible temporal sequence from  administration of the study 
drug and follows a known response pattern to the suspected study drug.  
The reaction might have  been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or other modes 
of therapy  administered to the subject, but this is not known for sure.  
Probably 
Related: A reaction that follows a  plausible temporal sequence from  administration of the study 
drug and follows a known response pattern to the suspected study drug.  
The reaction cannot be  reasonably  explained by [CONTACT_78456]’s clinical state or  other modes of therapy  administered to the subject. 
If the relationship between the AE/SAE and the study drug  is determined to be “possible” or 
“probable”, the event will be considered related to the study drug for the purposes of expedited 
regulatory reporting.  
12.2.3.  Recording AEs 
Information about AEs will be collected from the signing of the consent form(s)  until the final 
visit of the study for that subject.  All AEs will be followed until the event is resol ved, 
considered stable, or the Investigator determines the event is no longer clinically significant.   
Adverse events spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_3184]/or in response to an open question 
from the study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_7235].   The AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology when 
possible.  For each AE, the Investigator will evaluate and report the onset (date and time), 
resolution or clinical plateau (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken, outcome, and 
whether or not it caused the subject to discontinue the study drug or withdraw early from the 
study.   
Protocol 547 -[COMPANY_003]-304 Sage Therapeutics  
Version 4.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
 42 Intensity will be assessed according to the following scale:  
• Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated)  
• Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)  
• Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform norm al activities)  
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_31468] [IP_ADDRESS]. An AE of severe intensity 
may not be considered serious.  
12.2.4.  Pregnancy  
Based on findings from animal studies of other drugs that enhance GABAergic inhibition, 
brexanolone may cause fetal harm . Should a pregnancy occur, it mu st be reported  within [ADDRESS_266708] interfered 
with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication.  
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or 
congenital abnormality) must be followed up and documented even if the subject was 
discontinued from the study. All reports of congenital abnormalities/birth def ects are SAEs. 
Spontaneous miscarriages should also be reported and handled as SAEs. Elective abortions 
without complications should not be handled as AEs.  
12.2.5.  Overdose  
An overdose is any dose of study treatment given to a subject or taken by a subject that exceeds 
the dose described in protocol. Overdoses are not considered AEs and should not be recorded as 
an AE on the eCRF; however, all overdoses must be recorded on an Overdose form and sent to 
Sage or designee within [ADDRESS_266709] be recorded.  
12.2.6.  Immediate Reporting SAEs 
All SAEs (regardless of causality) will be recorded from the signing of the consent form(s)  until 
the final visit of the study for that subject. Serious adverse events occurring after the subject’s 
final study visit should be reported to the Sponsor or Sponsor’s d esignee only if the investigator 
considers the SAE to be related to study drug . 
All SAEs must be reported to Sage Therapeutics , or designee, immediately . A written account of 
the SAE must be sent to Sage Therapeutics within [ADDRESS_266710] awareness of the event by 
[CONTACT_11219]/or his/her staff. The Investigator must complete, sign and date the SAE 
report form , verify the accuracy of the information recorded on the SAE report form  with the 
corresponding source documents, and send a copy to Sage  Therapeutics , or designee .   
Additional follow -up information, if required or available, must be sent to Sage Therapeutics , or 
designee.  within 24 hours of receipt; a follow -up SAE form shou ld be completed and placed with 
the original SAE information and kept with the appropriate section of the eCRF and/or study file.   
Protocol 547 -[COMPANY_003]-304 Sage Therapeutics  
Version 4.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
 43 Sage Therapeutics , or designee,  is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of 
certain events. It is th e Principal Investigator’s responsibility to notify the IRB/EC of all SAEs 
that occur at his or her site. Investigators will also be notified of all suspected, unexpected, 
serious, adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) that occur during the clinical stud y or from oth er studies 
with brexanolone . Each site is responsible for notifying its ethics committee of these S[LOCATION_003]Rs.  
Sage or designee  will submit S[LOCATION_003]Rs  to regulatory agencies according to local law.  
12.2.7.  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
The following events are considered AESIs and should be reported on the AESI form within 72 
hours.  
• Excessive sedation  
• Loss of consciousness  
• Any sedation-related AE that leads to dose reduction, interruption, or termination  
If the AESI also qualifies as a n SAE an SAE form should be submitted per the guidelines per

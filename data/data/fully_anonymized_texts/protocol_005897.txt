4/12/[ADDRESS_268790] been associated with greater serum urate.16-18 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_223276], there is a paucity of studies that evaluated the blood 
pressure lowering effects of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) in humans.19 In one early study, significant 
reductions in blood pressure were demonstrated in adolescents with hyperuricemia and hypertension after 
treatment with allopurinol. Similar blood pressure reductions after ULT with the uricosuric drug probenecid 
favors the hypothesis that urate reduction leads to blood pressure lowering independent of xanthine-oxidase 
inhibition.20 The trials, however, were small (n=30 and n=60),19 did not investigate the mechanisms underlying 
the blood pressure reduction, and did not evaluate differential responses to ULT by [CONTACT_545]/ethnicity. This latter 
point is particularly relevant, since racial/ethnic differences in the pathophysiology of hypertension are 
known.21-24 Translational research studies to define the mechanisms through which urate lowering might 
contribute to hypertension control in humans are scarce. Given the high burden of hyperuricemia and 
hypertension among US adults, particularly among those with gout, understanding the blood pressure 
lowering effects of ULT and its underlying mechanisms has important public health implications.  
 
A.1. Hypertension is a common disorder that impacts patients with hyperuricemia and gout 
Persons with gout and hyperuricemia suffer from hypertension and other cardiovascular outcomes at 
disproportionately greater rates compared with the general population and independently of other 
demographic considerations and traditional cardiovascular risk factors.25-29 Since hyperuricemia is a necessary 
precondition for the development of gout, the demonstration that lowering serum urate confers the 
additional benefit of lowering blood pressure (BP) has special relevance for patients with gout. Hypertension 
affects about 37% of US adults.[ADDRESS_268791] costs associated with 
hypertension exceeded $37 billion.34 Several mechanisms contribute to the etiology of hypertension, including 
the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone hormonal system (RAAS), the sympathetic nervous system, and the 
endothelin-nitric oxide system.35 Approaches to hypertension management are based on pharmacological 
therapy to target these systems: angiotensin-converting enzyme blockers and blockers of the angiotensin 
receptor or the mineralocorticoid receptor for the RAAS, alpha and beta adrenergic blockade for the 
sympathetic nervous system, calcium channel blockers for calcium stimulated peripheral vasoconstriction, and 
diuretics for volume expansion.[ADDRESS_268792] 2: The Effects of Urate Lowering Therapy on Inflammation, Endothelial Function, and Blood Pressure (NIAMS: 
CORT) 
 
 
4/12/2018 Protocol Version 9  Page 6 of 64 
 
 hypertensive patients who are adherent with therapy fail to achieve BP goals.37 There is a clear need to 
develop novel approaches to hypertension control, particularly among persons with gout, and to better 
understand the pathophysiology of hypertension in the setting of hyperuricemia. 
 
A.2. Elevated serum urate is independently linked to hypertension 
The association between levels of serum urate and BP has been described for many decades.1,2,4,6-10,25,26,38-48 
This association has been reported even with serum urate levels within the “normal” range.  49 Animal models 
provided additional support for a causal hypothesis by [CONTACT_223340], induced 
artificially in rats through administration of oxonic acid, lead to glomerular hypertension.14,50-52 These changes 
were fully reversible after the administration of ULT.53-55 Administration of 200 mg of twice daily allopurinol as 
ULT for one month resulted in a significant reduction in casual and ambulatory BP among 30 adolescents with 
hypertension and hyperuricemia when compared with placebo in a crossover trial.19 Although this study had a 
very strong design and good medication compliance, it suffered from small sample size, lack of translational 
outcomes related to the mechanisms mediating the BP lowering, generalizability issues (large proportion of 
obese patients), and inability to explore outcomes by [CONTACT_55494]. Another study evaluated the effect of 
urate lowering with 300 mg of allopurinol daily for 3 months on BP among 48 hyperuricemic adult patients in 
Turkey compared to 21 normouricemic age and sex-matched controls that received no treatment. Decreases 
in systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and serum urate were noted in the 
hyperuricemic patients but not in the control group.56 Significant study limitations include the lack of an 
adequate placebo-controlled group, BP outcome based on casual measurements, and a limited sample-size. 
An additional study demonstrated that the uricosuric drug probenecid is also effective in reducing BP in 
children and adolescents, supporting the notion that BP reduction is associated with urate-lowering by 
[CONTACT_223341]-oxidase inhibition.20  We will make further progress in addressing these 
questions by [INVESTIGATOR_3086] a larger sample size of mixed race/ethnicity, mechanistic and translational studies of 
the effect of ULT on BP, a careful methodology with a crossover design, and a placebo-control group.  
 
A.3. Serum urate lowering is an innovative approach to BP lowering 
 
A.3.1. Serum urate effects on inflammatory markers and hypertension 
Serum urate concentrations have been associated with levels of inflammatory markers in individuals without 
gout.57,[ADDRESS_268793] been associated with a decrease in levels of CRP and 
high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP).59,60 Given their importance in the pathophysiology of endothelial 
dysfunction and cardiovascular disease, changes in inflammatory markers are important candidate 
mechanisms to better understand the action of urate-lowering on endothelial function and BP. A study done 
in a small number (n=30) of hyperuricemic adults (mean age 54 years) showed a reduction in hsCRP after 
treatment with allopurinol but no correlation with BP change.[ADDRESS_268794] 2: The Effects of Urate Lowering Therapy on Inflammation, Endothelial Function, and Blood Pressure (NIAMS: 
CORT) 
 
 
4/12/[ADDRESS_268795] found that urate lowering 
by [CONTACT_223341]-oxidase inhibition was effective at reducing BP in adolescents. 20 A study 
done in a small number of hyperuricemic older adults (n=30) reported that ULT with allopurinol improved 
endothelial function.[ADDRESS_268796] widely used 
method in children and adults, and is reflective of the integrity of the nitric oxide (NO)-mediated vasodilation 
mechanisms. This tool will allow our group to test whether there is an association between serum urate 
lowering, NO-dependent endothelial function, and BP lowering in young adults.  
 
A.3.3. Decreases in serum urate reduce blood pressure 
 This hypothesis has been tested only in small groups of patients.19,56,61 In all cases, reducing urate levels led to 
statistically significant decreases in BP. Given that hypertension is associated with anatomical changes leading 
to an increase in the wall/lumen ratio of the resistance arteries62,63, we expect that our innovative approach 
will show its maximum effect in a population of young adults in whom chronic vascular remodeling induced by 
[CONTACT_223342]. In addition, we expect our proposed translational study to be 
beneficial even in individuals that do not meet the formal biochemical definition of hyperuricemia (greater or 
equal than 6.8 mg/dL).69 This is supported in part by [CONTACT_14198][INVESTIGATOR_223277]. 25,26 Our own findings showed an increased risk for incident 
hypertension over 20 years of follow-up for women with serum urate concentrations greater or equal to 4.0 
mg/dL and men with serum urate concentrations greater or equal to 5.0 mg/dL.  [ADDRESS_268797] not examined the question of racial/ethnic differences. It 
is well established that hypertension disproportionately affects African Americans70 and that African 
Americans have differential responses to hypertension therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].21-[ADDRESS_268798] 2: The Effects of Urate Lowering Therapy on Inflammation, Endothelial Function, and Blood Pressure (NIAMS: 
CORT) 
 
 
4/12/2018 Protocol Version 9  Page 8 of 64 
 
 is more sensitive to serum urate and that this may be a mechanism to partially explain the higher prevalence 
of hypertension among African Americans. Given these reported differences, we will investigate differences in 
hsCRP, FMD, and BP in response to ULT. 
 
B. SPECIFIC AIMS 
In the context of a prospective, randomized study with crossover, our specific aims are to:  
 
1. Determine in young adults with pre- or stage I hypertension whether ULT with 300 mg of allopurinol once 
daily over 4 weeks will:  
 
1a. Lower blood pressure 
Hypothesis 1: Four weeks of ULT therapy will induce a greater reduction in ambulatory blood pressure levels 
when compared to four weeks on placebo 
Hypothesis 2: ULT will induce a greater reduction in ambulatory blood pressure levels in African Americans 
when compared with other races/ethnicities. 
 
1b. Induce a change in endothelial function  
Hypothesis 3: Four weeks of ULT will induce an improvement in endothelial function as indexed by [CONTACT_1603]-
mediated arterial vasodilation (FMD) compared to placebo. 
Hypothesis 4: ULT will induce a greater increase in FMD in African Americans when compared with other 
races/ethnicities. 
 
1c. Induce a change in serum levels of high sensitivity C-reactive protein  
Hypothesis 5: Four weeks of ULT will induce a greater reduction in serum levels of high sensitivity C-reactive 
protein (hsCRP) than placebo. 
Hypothesis 6: ULT will induce a greater reduction in hsCRP in African Americans when compared with other 
races/ethnicities. 
 
 
2. Determine if the impact of ULT on hsCRP, FMD, and blood pressure is associated with the change in 
serum urate achieved  
Hypothesis 7: Changes in hsCRP, FMD, and blood pressure will be associated with the serum urate change 
observed after four weeks of ULT with allopurinol compared to placebo. 
 
We initially aimed to recruit 112 young adults (ages 18-40 years) with pre-hypertension or JNC 7 stage I 
hypertension37 not taking antihypertensive medication. Recruitment includes men, women, African 
Americans, and other races/ethnicities in equal numbers. To increase generalizability and add novelty to the 
research question, participants will not be required to be hyperuricemic, but to have serum urate levels > 5.[ADDRESS_268799] 2: The Effects of Urate Lowering Therapy on Inflammation, Endothelial Function, and Blood Pressure (NIAMS: 
CORT) 
 
 
4/12/2018 Protocol Version 9  Page 9 of 64 
 
 mg/dL for men and 4.0 mg/dL for women. Participants will be randomized to receive allopurinol or placebo in 
a four-week study with crossover. This novel translational study will generate knowledge about the 
mechanism by [CONTACT_223343]-normal urate levels and other cardiovascular risk factors, including 
hypertension. 
 
C. RESEARCH STRATEGY 
We propose a novel intervention for reducing BP that could have a preferential impact in patients with 
hyperuricemia and gout. There is a great need for new anti-hypertensives, particularly among those with gout. 
The proposed study is novel in its plans to investigate the physiologic mechanisms through which urate 
contributes to vascular disease and by [CONTACT_223344]. Also innovative, we will: 1) 
determine to what extent the described benefit of lowering serum urate extends beyond the adolescent 
population previously studied into young adults, 2) test whether a urate-lowering approach will benefit 
individuals that do not yet meet the current definition of hyperuricemia and do not have gout, and 3) begin to 
explore potential mechanisms for the higher prevalence of hypertension among African Americans. If 
successful, this work could translate to the standard of clinical care and to health care recommendations for 
the population as a whole.  
 
D. Subject Selection 
Similar to past successful recruitment for hypertension studies at our institution, announcements will be 
placed in the web page www.researchmatch.org  , Birmingham metro area local newspapers, UAB publications 
(e.g. UAB reporter, distributed to all UAB campus), websites, and flyers that will be posted on UAB campus. 
Given the inclusion age range with this trial, participants will be also be recruited utilizing social media ads 
(e.g., Spotify, Facebook, and Instagram). The flyers and ads will request adults, ages 18-40, that are interested 
in participating in a clinical study for hypertension, to call the recruitment coordinating center. Additionally, 
participants will also be recruited directly from the UAB [ADDRESS_268800] a screen fail rate of ≥66%, thus we anticipate screening roughly 3 or more persons by [CONTACT_223345]. From our previous 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_223278] a population of similar age, we estimate that 30% of adults, 18-[ADDRESS_268801] hyperuricemia as defined by a level of > 6.8 mg/dL.[ADDRESS_268802] increased, it is likely that over 
50% of the population of men and women will have serum urate levels > 5.0 and > 4.0 mg/dL, respectively. 
Also, based on NHANES 1999-2006 data, 53% of men and women age [ADDRESS_268803] serum urate ≥ 5.0 mg/dL (≥4.0 mg/dL for women). When considering this and the 
past experience of the UAB Hypertension group in screening, we anticipate that about 50% of the laboratory-
Project 2: The Effects of Urate Lowering Therapy on Inflammation, Endothelial Function, and Blood Pressure (NIAMS: 
CORT) 
 
 
4/12/[ADDRESS_268804] carefully accounted for these recruitment challenges in our study design and 
budget and anticipate enrolling 30 individuals per year. 
 
*Study was amended on  10/2014 and 07/2015 to allow inclusion of individuals ages 36-40 and 18, respectively. 
**Study was amended on 10/2015 to allow of inclusion of individuals on stable doses of calcium channel blockers. 
 
E. Participant Retention 
Retention of participants is central to the internal validity of the proposed study and will be an extraordinarily 
high priority.  To increase retention, we hire engaging, attentive, and responsive staff and provide participants 
with as much flexibility as we can to complete their study visits.  Other features used to promote high 
retention rates will include tracking systems and collection of information (i.e., names and telephone 
numbers) for two friends/family members who do not live with the study participant but would know where 
to find them. Once enrolled, a proactive plan for retention will be implemented that includes in person visits Table 1. Enrollment criteria. 
Inclusion criteria

 every 4 weeks, and phone calls in between each visit. The following major principles and commonly used 
strategies to maximize retention and minimize loss to follow-up will be employed during the trial: 
 Stressing the idea that participants have an active role in the research and are part of the research 
team 
 Enhancing participant’s understanding of the study’s mission and the protocol 
 Stressing that retention efforts begin with recruitment and are an ongoing process 
 Building patient relations and patient satisfaction, with the study staff taking a central role on this 
effort 
 Emphasizing the importance of congeniality, respectfulness and friendliness in interactions with 
participants 
 Actively discuss with patients any questions and concerns pertaining to their condition 
 Identifying potential problems and key retention factors and developi[INVESTIGATOR_98457] 
 Assessing each patient’s drop out potential and intervening as needed to keep patients interested in 
continuing to participate 
 Subjects will be paid $25 for each completed clinic visit and flow mediated dilation procedure. In 
addition, subjects will receive $100 for each complete 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure recording 
session. Payments will be made at the completion of each study visit’s procedures. Should subjects 
withdraw from the study, they will be paid for the completed visits up to the date of withdrawal.

  Administration of single-blind run-in placebo – 2-4 weeks duration (2 week minimum, but longer duration 
for pre-menopausal women).  
Screening visits and study entry criteria assessment. At the screening visit, the study objectives will be 
explained to potential participants and once interest in participating is confirmed, they will be offered an 
initial informed consent for the screening evaluation.  Three BP measurements will be performed following 
the recommendations published in the report of the Joint National Committee on Hypertension [ADDRESS_268807] five minutes with feet on the floor and arms supported at heart level, appropriate 
cuff sizes will be used, restrictions on alcohol and caffeine consumption for a specified time period prior to 
obtaining BP measurements will be imposed, and appropriate maintenance of all equipment will be 
performed. We will use automated BP devices for measurement of clinic BP (Omron, Bannockburn, IL, Model 
HEM-705CP).  If the average of the second and third systolic and diastolic BP measurements taken 3 minutes 
apart is found to be within the pre-hypertension or stage I hypertension range (SBP ≥ 120 and <160 mmHg or 
DBP ≥ 80 and < 100 mmHg) the participant will be allowed to continue with the full screening procedures to 
assess for study entry criteria (Table 3). Before randomization, participants will participate in a single blind 
run-in period lasting 2-4 weeks during which they will receive a 21-45 day supply of the daily dose of placebo.   
 
Focused history and physical examination: Information collected will include date of birth, self-reported 
race/ethnicity (defined as in previous studies investigating its role in rheumatic diseases)74, medical conditions 
that might preclude study participation including current or recent infections and gout, medication history 
(including use of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], gout medications, losartan, fenofibrate), duration of hypertension, weight, and 
height. Gynecological history will include last menstrual date. This information will help assess the balanced 
allocation of participants during randomization, estimate glomerular filtration rate, establish phase of 
menstrual cycle for women, and identify exclusion criteria.  
 
Laboratory: Serum urate, transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, serum creatinine, complete blood count, 
bilirubin, cotinine test, and pregnancy test for women. Blood samples will be analyzed at UAB lab facilities in 
the Kirklin clinic. Pregnancy and cotinine tests will be performed by [CONTACT_223346]. All lab samples will be discarded if the participant is deemed not eligible for the study. 
Informed Consent 
The process of informed consent will be carried out by [CONTACT_223347]-person study visit. During the screening visit, the consent form will be read 
by [CONTACT_223348]. The participant will be given as much time as they need to read and ask questions about the consent 
form. The individual will be informed that he/she is not obligated to participate in the study and that it is 
strictly voluntary. The informed consent process will ensure that there is no penalty for not participating in a 
clinical trial and that treatment will not be compromised if individuals do not participate or if they cease 
participation at any time.

 By [CONTACT_17317], the participant authorizes the use of their personal health information, that they 
understand the study and its benefits and risks, and agree to all other aspects of the study outlined in the 
form. It allows the participant the opportunity to decide whether they want to participate in a study. During 
this process, individuals will be informed of all aspects of the study so that they can make an informed 
decision. Participants will then confirm their willingness to participate in the research study by [CONTACT_223349].  
 
After the participant has signed the consent form, the study coordinator/research assistant conducting the 
visit must countersign and date the Informed Consent Document, along with a third party witness to the 
consent. A signed version of the consent form will be kept by [CONTACT_223350].  
 
The informed consent document contains the following: 
 Disclosure of relevant information to prospective participants about the research; 
 The participant’s comprehension of the information; 
 The participant’s voluntary agreement to participate in a research study without coercion or undue 
influence. 
 An optional participation in future research by [CONTACT_223351]. 
 Complete disclosure of any appropriate alternative procedures and their risks and benefits 
 Disclosure of the extent of confidentiality that will be maintained 
 Statement of compensation and/or medical treatment available if injury occurs 
 Name, address, and telephone number of the Principal Investigator

24-hour Ambulatory Blood Pressure Measurements (ABPM) 
 
All patients had 24-hour ABPM evaluations with an automated, noninvasive, oscillometric device (Spacelabs 
Healthcare, Inc., [ADDRESS_268813], Snoqualmie, WA [ZIP_CODE], U.S.A). An appropriate sized cuff is used with 
a cuff bladder encircling at least 80% of the arm, according to guidelines.[ADDRESS_268814] 
study staff immediately should they not any abnormalities in cuff or monitor function (e.g., cuff failure to 
inflate fully, repeat error codes). The first measurement will be obtained at the end of the clinic visit to ensure 
proper fit and function.  ABPM monitors will be outfitted with new AA batteries for each participant and will

 be programmed to obtain blood pressure recordings every 20 minutes for the daytime (awake) and every 30 
minutes for the nighttime (asleep) for a 24-hour period. For the purposes of this study, daytime will be defined 
as 06:00-21:59 and nighttime will be defined as 22:00-05:59. Compliant 24-hour ABPM will be defined as a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_268815]. Should a non-compliant ABPM be unattainable, missing data will 
be handled with multiple imputation analysis.  Normal ABP is defined as mean 24-hour BP <130/80 mmHg 
with a daytime (awake) BP of <135/80 mmHg and a nighttime (asleep) BP of <120/70 mmHg by [CONTACT_223358]. 36,37. Average ABPM will be weighted for the proportion of daytime and nighttime 
blood pressure readings. At the time of data analysis, manual readings will be discarded when there is a 
concurrent automated reading within the same 5-minute period. In instances where the ABPM was recorded 
outside of the appropriate time (e.g., the participant did not follow instructions as to the timing of the test), 
each ABPM will be evaluated by [CONTACT_223359]-Mediated Dilation analyses (FMD) 
 
At visits 2, 3, 4, and 5, vascular endothelial function is measured by [CONTACT_1603]-mediated dilation (FMD) of the 
brachial artery performed by a study investigator who is blinded to treatment assignment. In women 
participants, FMD is performed within the first 7 days after onset of menstrual cycle to avoid known cyclic 
variations in FMD.  76,77 after an 8-hour fasting period, FMD is measured by [CONTACT_5019]-resolution ultrasound with an 
11-3 MHz linear-array probe (Philips HP Agilent Technologies, Sonos 5500, Andover, MA, [ZIP_CODE]). Prior to 
testing, participants were asked to rest for 10 minutes in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_33197] a quiet room. Ultrasound of 
the brachial artery was taken at approximately 5 cm proximal from the elbow in longitudinal section on the 
right arm. The probe was maintained in a fixed position at a fixed angle, and baseline artery diameter is 
recorded for 1 minute. Blood flow was estimated by [CONTACT_223360], and baseline artery diameter was 
assessed with simultaneous ECG recording for baseline assessment at every study visit. Reactive hyperemia 
was induced by [CONTACT_57094] a BP cuff around the forearm to 50 mmHg above resting systolic BP. The cuff 
remained inflated for a five-minute period, and then was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_223287]. The longitudinal image of the 
brachial artery was recorded continuously from 30 seconds before to 3 minutes after cuff deflation. A mid-
artery pulsed Doppler signal was obtained at an < 60° angle upon immediate cuff release and no later than [ADDRESS_268816] diameters after deflation 
were averaged, and FMD was expressed as the percentage increase in diameter from the baseline average 
measurement to the peak average dilation. Brachial arterial flow-mediated dilation related parameters were 
analyzed with edge detection software and Doppler flow analyzer (Vascular Research Tools 5 Software, 
Medical Imaging Applications, LLC, Coralville, IA). The calculation of FMD as a percentage change utilizes the 
peak diameter in response to reactive hyperemia in relation to the baseline diameter, and was calculated 
utilizing the following equation: Flow mediated dilation (%) = (Peak diameter-Baseline diameter)/Baseline 
diameter, and when multiplied by 100, FMD is expressed as a percent change in vessel caliber. An increase in

4/12/2018 Protocol Version 9  Page 22 of 64 
 
 the % change is considered positive. Mean and standard deviations were calculated at the beginning and end 
of allopurinol and placebo phases for FMD. 
 
G. Study Drug 
The subjects will be randomized to receive allopurinol as ULT, at a daily dose of [ADDRESS_268817] 80% will be 
required to consider the participant compliant. A non-compliant participant will continue in the study and 
enter analyses as mandated by [CONTACT_44266]-to-treat study design. At the end of the study, biobanked plasma 
samples (1.0-1.5 mL) will be evaluated for levels of allopurinol and the metabolite, oxypurinol, to determine 
an objective measure of study drug adherence. An amendment approved by [CONTACT_223361]  
2017 allowed for testing oxypurinol and allopurinol prospectively on all participants enrolled (previously 
restricted to biobanked samples). 
 
Individuals with transaminases or alkaline phosphatase values more than double the upper limit of normal will 
be excluded. The initial plan was to exclude subjects taking hypertension medications (including diuretics, that 
some participants do not regard as hypertension treatments), as this will have an unpredictable effect on the 
study outcomes. An amendment approved in 10/[ADDRESS_268818] a severe interaction with allopurinol.78 Participants with serious medical conditions that in 
the investigator’s judgment pose an unacceptable risk for exposure to a fixed dose of allopurinol (e.g. 
advanced heart failure, advanced liver disease or cirrhosis) will also be excluded. 
 
H. Data collection and Statistical Analyses (see also Data Analysis plan) 
Measures of central tendency (sample mean, sample media) and dispersion (sample variance, sample 
standard deviation) will be calculated for all outcome variables  (e.g., hsCRP, endothelial function, and BP on 
ABPM) and covariates (e.g. age, race, etc.). For outcome variables, distributional properties will be evaluated 
using histograms and normal probability plots.  When the assumption of normality is questionable, outcome

4/12/2018 Protocol Version 9  Page 23 of 64 
 
 variable tranformations will be examined to determine if the transformed variables approximate a normal 
distribution.  will be transformed to achieve normality.  Of the main study measures, we anticipate the 
distribution of hsCRP to be highly skewed. Consistent with prior studies, we will log transform hsCRP values for 
analysis.  Possible outlying or inconsistent values will be detected and explored 
 
Aim 1a: ULT and change in BP. The change in the average weighted 24-hour mean SBP and DBP will be 
compared among participants during the active treatment and placebo phases by [CONTACT_54959] t-test analysis.  
 
Aim 1b: ULT and change in FMD. The change in the FMD will be compared among participants during the 
active treatment and placebo phases by [CONTACT_54959] t-test analysis.  
 
Aim 1c: ULT and change in hsCRP. For each participant, we will first calculate the change in log transformed 
hsCRP from the beginning to the end of each crossover phase.  The lack of an effect for the treatment 
sequence on the relative treatment responses will be confirmed using a treatment by [CONTACT_223362]. Next, the within-participant change in hsCRP will be compared during the allopurinol treatment and 
placebo phases by [CONTACT_54959] t-test analysis.  
 
Assessing differential treatment effects by [CONTACT_545]/ethnicity 
Comparison in the mean change achieved in the allopurinol treatment minus placebo phase between African 
Americans and other races/ethnicities will be performed initially using a t-test for independent samples. If 
differences are identified in the distribution of covariates, then the analysis will be completed with analysis of 
variance. 
 
Assessing change in serum urate on change in hsCRP, FMD, and blood pressure 
For this aim, the independent variable is change in serum urate and the outcome is change in hsCRP, FMD, 
and BP.  First, participant factors associated with a significant change in serum urate will be identified using 
unadjusted age, race/ethnicity, and gender adjusted linear regression models. The correlation between 
change in serum urate with change in hsCRP, FMD, and SBP and DBP will be calculated using Spearman 
correlation coefficients. Using linear regression models, the association between changes in serum urate with 
changes in levels of each outcome, separately, will be determined.  Models will include initial adjustment for 
age, gender, and race/ethnicity with subsequent models adjusted for other potential confounders (e.g. 
estimated glomerular filtration rate). In analyzing the association of change in serum urate on change in BP, 
we will additionally adjust for hsCRP and FMD, individually and together. The reduction in the association (i.e. 
beta coefficient) between change in serum urate and change in BP from before to after adjustment for these 
variables will provide insight into the degree that these mechanisms mediate the relation between ULT and BP 
reduction.

 With 56 African Americans and 56 other races/ethnicities, we will be able to detect a difference in the increase 
of FMD of 1.48% for allopurinol versus placebo in African Americans compared to other participants. 
 
The primary analyses will be on an intent-to-treat basis. All statistical analysis will be performed using SAS 
statistical software (SAS, Cary, NC) by [CONTACT_223363]. All study related 
information will be entered into a study database.  This database will be maintained on a secure computer 
with access limited to study personnel only.   
 
Research information that identifies subjects will be shared with the UAB Institutional Review Board (IRB) and 
others who are responsible for ensuring compliance with laws and regulations related to research, including 
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA); and the Office for Humans Research Protections (OHRP). The 
results of this study may be published in scientific journals or presented at medical meetings, but study 
participants identity will remain confidential.  
 
 
Calculation of sample size. 
Power and sample size for aim 1c 
In a prior study, a standard deviation of 8.[ADDRESS_268819] deviation and similar assumptions as 
outlined above (alpha of 0.05 and a correlation of 10% between pairs of SBP measurements for each subject), 
we will have 90% statistical power to detect a 3.7 mmHg difference in the change in SBP with allopurinol 
treatment versus placebo.  An intra-individual variation (standard deviation) of the difference between two 
values on a same patient in DBP by [CONTACT_223364] 6.[ADDRESS_268820] deviation and 90% statistical power, we will be able to detect a 
change in DBP of 2.0 mmHg for treatment with allopurinol versus placebo. For comparing African Americans 
versus participants of other race/ethnicities (assuming 46 participants in each group), we will have 90% 
statistical power to detect a difference in SBP and DBP of 5.[ADDRESS_268821] deviation of the difference between two values obtained in the same patient has been reported 
to be 2.5%. 80 With an alpha of 0.05, statistical power of 0.90, assuming a 10% within-period correlation of 
change in FMD and the sample size of [ADDRESS_268822] a change in 
FMD of 1.15% between allopurinol treatment and placebo. With 46 African American s and 46 other 
races/ethnicities, we will be able to detect a difference in the increase of FMD of 1.48% for allopurinol versus 
placebo in African Americans compared to other participants. 
 
Power and sample size for aim 1a.

4/12/2018 Protocol Version 9  Page 25 of 64 
 
 As mentioned above, it is anticipated that the distribution for hsCRP will be skewed, and thus, we will log 
transform hsCRP.   The sample size for the study is based on having 90% statistical power, assuming a two-
tailed alpha error of 5% and a within person correlation of log transformed hsCRP between measurements of 
10%.  The intra-person standard deviation for log transformed hsCRP has been reported to be 0.52 log mg/L 
on serial measurements extending into a one year period.[ADDRESS_268823] a difference in log transformed hsCRP of 
0.25 (log mg/L) will require a sample size of 93 participants with complete hsCRP measurements (i.e., from 
baseline and closeout visits for each of the study phases).  This is equivalent to a net reduction of hsCRP of 
25% (e.g., from 2 mg/L to 1.5 mg/L or from 1 mg/L to 0.75 mg/L).  This difference was chosen as it represents 
approximately half of one standard deviation in log-transformed hsCRP and is a meaningful decline to be 
observed over a four week period.  Although we expect minimal loss to follow-up, we have taken the 
conservative step of increasing the sample size to account for 20% of participants not having complete data.  
Thus, we will recruit and randomize 112 participants for the proposed trial. For comparing differences in the 
net reduction in hsCRP for African Americans in comparison to other races/ethnicities, with 46 African 
Americans and 46 other races/ethnicities, we will have 90% statistical power to detect a differential reduction 
in log transformed hsCRP of 32 log mg/L (e.g., a 10 log mg/L reduction in whites and a 42 log mg/L reduction in 
African Americans).   
 
 
Table 4. Statistical Power for Aim [ADDRESS_268824] various incremental increases in R2 due to the addition of change 
in serum urate in various regression models.  For example, 92 individuals will provide 87% power using a Type 
I error rate of 0.[ADDRESS_268825] an increase of 7.5% in R2 by [CONTACT_223365] a regression model 
that already explains 20% of the variability in the change in BP with 5 control variables (age, sex, 
race/ethnicity, body mass-index, glomerular filtration rate).  Due to the nature of multivariable linear 
regression, identical results hold for changes in hsCRP and FMD.

 1.Risks associated with phlebotomy  
Subjects may experience pain from the needle used during phlebotomy, as well as possible bruising and 
soreness at the phlebotomy site. 
 
2.Twenty-four hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring 
The procedure may cause some mild discomfort during cuff inflation, but otherwise has no associated risk. 
 
3.Ultrasonographic measurement of flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery   
The procedure requires the subject to be supi[INVESTIGATOR_17044] [ADDRESS_268826] of these side effects are mild and reversible, but severe cutaneous reaction of the Stevens-Johnson type 
and bone marrow suppression, events that are reported in less than 1% of allopurinol recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], may not be 
reversible.  
 
Allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome (AHS) is a very rare (occurs in less than 1 in 1000 patients), life 
threatening idiosyncratic reaction that is commonly preceded by [CONTACT_932]. published prior report mentions a crude 
incidence rate of .69 per 1000 person years for severe AHS cutaneous reactions.  83 It should be noted that 
during the course of this study we will expose to allopurinol a total 112 (<30 participants/year) ambulatory 
young adults aged 18-40, with normal kidney function. The rate of AHS in younger ambulatory patients with 
normal kidney function has not been established but is possibly lower than in individuals with gout and other 
medical comorbidities. Allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome has principally been observed in individuals that 
are HLAB5801 positive (primarily individuals of Han Chinese or Thai descent). As recommended in the recently 
released American College of Rheumatology guidelines, we will test for HLAB5801 during initial screening in 
individuals of Han Chinese or Thai descent.  [ADDRESS_268827] added a safety monitoring rule. When patients are seen at 
visits 2-5, if present with high blood pressure >160/110, first it will be rechecked [ADDRESS_268828] 2: The Effects of Urate Lowering Therapy on Inflammation, Endothelial Function, and Blood Pressure (NIAMS:

methods, inter-uterine device, a double-barrier method (diaphragm with spermicide, condom with 
spermicide) or abstinence.   
 
If participants suspect that they may have become pregnant during the study, the study coordinator must 
contact [CONTACT_9154] [INVESTIGATOR_223288].  If it is 
confirmed that the participant is pregnant, they will be withdrawn from the study. The study PI [INVESTIGATOR_223289] a follow up visit and may choose to follow the outcome of the pregnancy.  Additionally, taking 
allopurinol may involve unknown risks to a nursing infant.  If it is discovered that participants are 
breastfeeding, they are not eligible to participate in the study and their participation will be discontinued 
immediately.  
 
The rate of AHS is estimated at 1/1000, and may be a particular concern for those with reduced renal function 
or caring the HLA B5801 allele. We will expose [ADDRESS_268832], we believe it is very unlikely, but possible that we could witness one severe 
cutaneous adverse reaction including AHS. Our stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_223290]-evaluation would occur if we 
register more than one of such cutaneous adverse reaction (toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194], Steven-Johnson’s 
syndrome, AHS).  We would then stop the study to comprehensively review safety and allopurinol dosing 
protocols.  Other severe adverse reaction or deaths may or may not be related to the study drug and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_223291].  
 
L. QUALITY and Safety ASSURANCE

The DSMB will discharge itself from its duties when the last participant completes the study. 
 
Membership 
The DSMB will include experts in or representatives of the fields of: 
 rheumatology,  
 cardiovascular disease  
 biostatistics.  
 
The Chair is the contact [CONTACT_100092]. The University of Alabama at Birmingham shall provide the 
logistical management and support of the DSMB.  
 
Board Process  
At the first meeting the DSMB will discuss the protocol, suggest modifications, and establish guidelines to 
study monitoring to be reported.  The DSMB Chairperson ([CONTACT_223440]) in consultation with the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_223293], 
modifications to the study protocol and informed consent document, initiation of the trial, reporting of 
adverse events, statistical analysis plan including interim analysis, etc.  
 
Meetings of the DSMB will be held at the call of the Chairperson. The study investigators or designee will 
attend most of the meetings. An emergency meeting of the DSMB may be called at any time by [CONTACT_223368] [INVESTIGATOR_223294]. 
 
 
Meeting Format  
DSMB meetings will consist of open and closed sessions. Discussion held in both sessions is confidential. The 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_223295].  Open session discussion 
will focus on the conduct and progress of the study, including participant accrual, protocol compliance, and 
problems encountered. Unblinded data are not presented in the open session.  
Project 2: The Effects of Urate Lowering Therapy on Inflammation, Endothelial Function, and Blood Pressure (NIAMS: 
CORT) 
 
 
4/12/2018 Protocol Version 9  Page 31 of 64 
 
  
The closed session  will be attended by [CONTACT_223369](s). The study 
statistician may be present, at the request of the DSMB. Any data by [CONTACT_223370], as necessary, 
unblinded data, are presented during the closed session.  
 
Each meeting must include a recommendation to continue or to terminate the study and whether the DSMB 
has any concerns about participant safety made by a formal DSMB majority or unanimous vote. Should the 
DSMB decide to issue a termination recommendation, the full vote of the DSMB is required. In the event of a 
split vote, majority vote will rule and a minority report should be appended. The DSMB Chair provides the 
tiebreaking vote in the event of a 50-[ADDRESS_268835] of two parts:  
 
 Part 1 - Open Session Report and  
 Part [ADDRESS_268836] 
mailing of the reports from the study to the DSMB. 
 
1. Part 1 - Open Session Reports:  Open session reports generally include administrative reports by 
[CONTACT_223371], enrolled, completed, and discontinued, as well as baseline 
characteristics of the study population. Other general information on study status may also be 
presented. Listings of adverse events and serious adverse events as well as any other information 
requested by [CONTACT_223372], but none of the data should be 
presented in an unblinded manner. The DSMB may direct additions and other modifications to the 
reports on a one-time or continuing basis.

CORT) 
 
 
4/12/2018 Protocol Version 9  Page 32 of 64 
 
  
2. Part 2 – Closed Session Report:  Closed session reports generally present the same information as 
presented in the open session but by [CONTACT_47123] (e.g., A/B, etc.). The reports may 
also contain data on study outcomes, including safety data, and depending on the study, perhaps 
efficacy data. The Closed Session reports should be destroyed at the conclusion of the meeting. If 
the meetings are held by [CONTACT_756], printed copi[INVESTIGATOR_223296].  If a study has an interim analysis, it is also discussed in the 
closed session.  
 
Additional Reports 
1.  Mailings to the DSMB:  On a scheduled basis (as agreed upon by [CONTACT_4318]) blinded safety data could be 
communicated to all DSMB members and to the designated Safety Officer (VIA KAI). The study may provide 
these data directly to the DSMB, if such communication procedures are approved by [INVESTIGATOR_678]. 
 
Reports from the DSMB 
A formal report containing the recommendations for continuation or modifications of the study will be 
prepared by [CONTACT_184465], Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1461]. The draft report will be sent to the 
DSMB members for review and approval. It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_223297]-investigators and to ensure that necessary reports are submitted to the UAB 
IRB. 
 
As previously stated, the formal DSMB report must include a recommendation to continue or to terminate the 
study. This recommendation should be made by [CONTACT_7558]. A termination recommendation may be 
made by [CONTACT_93534]. In the event of a split vote in favor of continuation, a 
minority report should be contained within the regular DSMB report. The report should not include unblinded 
data or discussion of the unblinded data.  
 
Confidentiality  
All materials, discussions and proceedings of the DSMB are completely confidential. Members and other 
participants in DSMB meetings are expected to maintain confidentiality.

 investigators, and senior UAB researchers who meet periodically to discuss all facets of the CORT and its 
projects. Any concerns voiced by [CONTACT_223374]. 
 
 
 
2d. UAB Pharmacy 
The UAB Investigational Drug Service (IDS) is responsible for the storage and preparation of both the study 
drug and placebo for this study. Placebo run-in medication will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_223298] a 
participant is deemed eligible. The labeled study drug is pi[INVESTIGATOR_140467] a research assistant to dispense to study 
participants (depending on assigned group) at visits 2 and 4. A drug log will be used to track the study drug 
from pharmacy to study participant. Further questions about pharmacy activities can be directed to: Rebecca 
Quinn, PharmD. IDS Pharmacy, University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], [PHONE_4726]. 
 
3. Training Plan 
Each study staff member will be trained in the protocol by [CONTACT_223375]. The investigators 
and all staff involved in the study will have completed their required IRB / human participants training.  New 
study staff members will be trained on the protocol and spend a visit shadowing another trained staff member 
before carrying out visits independently. If necessary, any non-MD study personnel will be trained to take a 
blood pressure reading, height, and weight; those with additional phlebotomy training will be permitted to 
draw blood labs. Any study personnel tasked to enter participant information/data will be certified to enter 
data utilizing the using the REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) system. Prior to study start up, the 
project manager and Data Work Group Leader will certify study personnel to enter in study data and they 
have completed REDCap training.  
 
Prior to conducting visits, the investigator will be asked to sign off that the staff member has been 
appropriately trained in the study protocol.  
 
If a staff performance problem arises, several steps will be taken to resolve the problem. First, the project 
manager will communicate the problem to the PIs. At this stage, the PIs will work with study personnel to 
identify causes of the problem and offer solutions. If the problem continues, additional training will be 
considered. In cases of problems of sufficient severity or intractable problems that are not resolved by [CONTACT_223376], the under-performing team member may be removed from active participation 
in the study.  
 
4. Communications plan 
As this protocol is currently only being carried out at one site (the University of Alabama at Birmingham-UAB), 
meetings will be held between the entire study staff on a monthly basis to communicate the on-going 
progress of the study.

 Recruitment progress 
 Adverse events 
 Issues or concerns with the study and possible solutions 
 Any data available at that time 
 Safety reporting 
 Other study updates 
 
Additionally, study personnel will keep investigators informed of the weekly progress of the study with weekly 
study work group meetings and email updates that include the following information: 
 Number of patients screened that week 
 Number of patient visits overall 
 Prospective study participants to speak with the following week 
 A recap of any adverse events (which, if classifies as a severe adverse event or requiring additional 
review, would have already been reported immediately following the event) 
 Other study updates 
 Any recent data collection that is useful for viewing or necessary to see for safety monitoring 
 
Finally, routine progress and safety reports will be provided to NIAMS-KAI within the intervals requested, but 
no less than quarterly.  
 
5. Recruitment and Retention Plan 
 
5a. Recruitment Plan 
The target population to be recruited is patients with Pre-hypertension or stage I hypertension. Similar to past 
successful recruitment for hypertension studies by [CONTACT_6283]. Calhoun and Oparil, announcements will be placed in 
the web page www.researchmatch.org , Birmingham metro area local newspapers, UAB publications (e.g. UAB 
reporter, distributed to all UAB campus), and flyers that will be posted on UAB campus requesting adults, ages 
18-40, that are interested in participating in a clinical study for hypertension, to call the recruitment 
coordinating center. Given the inclusion age range with this trial, participants will be also be recruited utilizing 
social media print and radio ads (e.g., Spotify, Facebook, and Instagram). Patients will also be recruited directly 
from the UAB 700 physician outpatient care facility, The Kirklin Clinic, through brochures distributed to 
physicians and from the Hypertension clinic. The inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed during a 
telephone interview (pre screening), and if the participant wishes to proceed, a screening visit will be 
scheduled (section 7). Informed consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_458], one of the co-
investigators, or a trained member of the study staff. Study procedures will not begin until signed informed 
consent has been obtained (section 8).

5b. Participant Retention 

Project 2: The Effects of Urate Lowering Therapy on Inflammation, Endothelial Function, and Blood Pressure (NIAMS: 
CORT) 
 
 
4/12/[ADDRESS_268838] an 80% retention rate. During the screening and enrollment process, 
contact [CONTACT_223377] a variety of ways (letters, staff contact [CONTACT_223378]) for 
optimal retention. To increase retention, we hire engaging, attentive, and responsive staff and provide 
participants with a flexible time to complete their study visits.  Other features used to promote high retention 
rates will include tracking systems and collection of information (i.e., names and telephone numbers) for two 
friends/family members who do not live with the study participant but would know where to find them. Once 
enrolled, a proactive plan for retention will be implemented that includes in person visits every 4 weeks, 
phone calls between each visit, and transportation vouchers to encourage participants to come to their visits. 
The following major principals and commonly used strategies to maximize retention and minimize loss to 
follow-up will be employed during the trial: 
 
 Stressing the idea that participants have an active role in the research and are part of the research 
team 
 Enhancing participant’s understanding of the study’s mission and the protocol 
 Stressing that retention efforts begin with recruitment and are an ongoing process 
 Building participant relations and participant satisfaction, with the study staff taking a central role on 
this effort 
 Emphasizing the importance of congeniality, respectfulness and friendliness in interactions with 
participants 
 Actively discuss with participants any questions and concerns pertaining to their condition 
 Identifying potential problems and key retention factors and developi[INVESTIGATOR_98457] 
 Assessing each participant’s drop out potential and intervening as needed to keep participant 
interested in continuing to participate

 7. Screening and eligibility criteria 
 
During the screening phase, potential participants will be determined as described in the Recruitment Plan in 
section 5A. Study personnel following instructions outlined in the study binder will carry out screenings.  
The set of screening questions will be asked prior to starting any study procedures and immediately after 
obtaining consent. These questions will be based on eligibility and exclusion criteria described below (see 
Appendix 2 for REDCap screenshots). Screening logs will be kept in electronic format and saved in a password 
protected file folder in the REDCap system (See Appendix 2 for REDCap screenshots) and updated as needed 
during recruitment. 
 
7. Criteria 
7a. Eligibility criteria 
A screening visit will occur to confirm study eligibility, explain procedures, and sign an informed consent for 
screening. For men and women in days 1-7 of the menstrual cycle eligible for the study, randomization and the 
baseline visit will occur 2 weeks after the screening procedures and signing of the consent form. Women after 
day 7 of the menstrual cycle will be invited to return after the onset of their menses and no later than day 7 of 
the next cycle for standardized measurements of FMD (4 week placebo run-in ±3 days) in the UAB 
Hypertension Clinic. 85,84 Participants will be randomized following confirmation of eligibility. We anticipate an 
additional 10% that initially fulfill inclusion criteria will fail to randomize because their BP will be outside the 
study range at visit 1. In conclusion, we project the need to perform screening laboratory assessments in 236 
individuals. Enrollment and participant follow-up will continue until 112 participants are enrolled. We 
anticipate recruiting 30 persons per year based on the following inclusion criteria.  
1. Pre-hypertension or stage I hypertension, defined as the following after the mean of two clinic 
measurements: 
o -Systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 120 and <160 or; 
o -Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 80 and < 100 
2. Serum urate ≥ 5.0 mg/dL for men or ≥ 4.0 mg/dL for women 
3. Age 18-[ADDRESS_268840] 2: The Effects of Urate Lowering Therapy on Inflammation, Endothelial Function, and Blood Pressure (NIAMS: 
CORT) 
 
 
4/12/[ADDRESS_268841] use an effective form of birth 
control during this study.  Acceptable methods of birth control include hormonal control methods, inter-
uterine device, a double-barrier method (diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide) or abstinence.   
 
If participants suspect that they may have become pregnant during the study, the study coordinator must 
contact [CONTACT_9154] [INVESTIGATOR_223288].  If it is 
confirmed that the participant is pregnant, they will be withdrawn from the study. The study PI [INVESTIGATOR_223289] a follow up visit and may choose to follow the outcome of the pregnancy.  Additionally, taking 
allopurinol may involve unknown risks to a nursing infant.  If potential participants are breastfeeding, they are 
not eligible to participate in the study. 
 
If participants suffer from very high BP >160/[ADDRESS_268842] it will be rechecked 24hrs later, if blood pressure is still 
elevated, they will excluded from the study, received consultation by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or Co-PI, and referred to their 
primary care provider.  
 
8. Informed Consent and HIPAA 
 
8a. Overview of the informed consent process 
 
During the screening visit, the form will be read by [CONTACT_223379]. The participant will be given as much time as 
they need to read and ask questions about the consent form. After the participant has signed the consent 
form, the Principal Investigator, and the research assistant conducting the visit must each sign and date the 
Informed Consent Document. A signed version of the consent form will be kept by [CONTACT_223380]. 
 
The individual will be informed that he/she is not obligated to participate in the study and that it is strictly 
voluntary. The informed consent process will ensure that there is no penalty for not participating in a clinical 
trial and that treatment will not be compromised if individuals do not participate or if they cease participation 
at any time. 
 
By [CONTACT_17317], the participant authorizes the use of their personal health information, that they 
understand the study and its benefits and risks, and agree to all other aspects of the study outlined in the 
form. Participants can withdraw their consent at any time.

CORT) 
 
 
4/12/2018 Protocol Version 9  Page 41 of 64 
 
  
8b. Overview of the Informed consent document 
The process of informed consent will be carried out by a study coordinator or the research assistant involved 
in the screening visit after the participant appears to meet the pre-screening criteria. It allows the participant 
the opportunity to decide whether they want to participate in a study. During this process, individuals will be 
informed of all aspects of the study so that they can make an informed decision. Participants will then confirm 
their willingness to participate in the research study by [CONTACT_223381] (see Appendix 1 for 
the complete informed consent). After the participant has signed the consent form, the research coordinator 
conducting the visit must sign and date the Informed Consent Document.  
 
The informed consent document contains the following: 
 Disclosure of relevant information to prospective participants about the research; 
 The participant’s comprehension of the information; 
 The participant’s voluntary agreement to participate in a research study without coercion or 
undue influence. 
 An optional participation in future research by [CONTACT_223351]. 
 Complete disclosure of any appropriate alternative procedures and their risks and benefits 
 Disclosure of the extent of confidentiality that will be maintained 
 Statement of compensation and/or medical treatment available if injury occurs 
 Name, address, and telephone number of the Principal Investigator 
 
[INVESTIGATOR_223281] a change in any of the study procedures that may affect the participant, the informed 
consent document will be revised and approved by [CONTACT_1201]. Any participants active in the study 
prior to a change in procedures will sign the amended consent form. Per NIH policy, the signed consent forms 
will be kept as part of the study record for at least 7 years after completion of the study. 
 
Important Steps for the Study Staff: 
 Provide participants with adequate information concerning the study procedures and scope 
 Provide adequate opportunity for the participant to consider all available options 
 Respond to the participant’s questions and concerns 
 Ensure that each participant understands all information provided 
 Obtain the participant’s written voluntary consent to participate 
 Countersign the consent form  
 Obtain a third-party witness signature 
 Provide participants with a copy of the consent form 
 Keep the signed form in the study binder

 8c. HIPAA Authorization 
The privacy requirements, as outlined by [CONTACT_223382] & Accountability Act (HIPAA) to 
protect the participant’s confidentiality, are met by [CONTACT_223383] a signature. Additionally, the following HIPAA Specific requirements are met in 
the last section of the consent form:  
 The form contains language that satisfies the HIPAA requirements and outline the 
protection of health information utilized in the study 
 That participants are authorizing investigators, IRBs, research administrators, and others to 
share and disclose their Protected Health Information (PHI) for research purposes.

 Further questions about pharmacy activities can be directed to: Rebecca Quinn, PharmD. IDS Pharmacy, 
University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], [PHONE_4726]. 
 
 
 
10. Randomization 
Randomization will occur using a random number generator. Specifically, permuted block randomization will 
be used allowing for balance between crossover arms throughout the investigation.  Block sizes will be 
variable to prevent research staff from anticipating subsequent crossover arm allocations.  The sequence of 
treatment assignment will be held by [CONTACT_223384][INVESTIGATOR_223300]. The 
pharmacist will maintain the master list and securely store the randomization files. The study coordinator will 
initiate the randomization procedure after a subject has consented. The coordinator will let the pharmacist 
know that a study pi[INVESTIGATOR_223301].  If any concerns arise 
during the randomization procedures, both the pharmacist and study coordinator will contact [CONTACT_191478]. 
 
 
11. Blinding and unblinding 
All study investigators and participating coordinators will be blinded to treatment assignment. If there is a 
serious adverse event, then unblinding will be discussed and if deemed necessary to unblind the participant, 
then the ID of the unblinded participant, reasons for unblinding, name [CONTACT_223433] a list of 
whomever becomes unblinded will be kept in the study binder. The pharmacist will contact [CONTACT_154776]'s 
primary physician about the exposure. If necessary, the participant will be withdrawn from the study. The 
pharmacist will hold the randomization codes securely until the completion of the study.  
 
12. Study Intervention 
This study meets the criteria of a clinical trial but it is not a NIH-Defined Phase III Clinical Trial as defined by 
[CONTACT_4289]. The UAB IDS pharmacy is responsible for the preparation and labeling of allopurinol and the placebo. 
Participants will be asked to take 4 weeks of allopurinol or placebo, then will crossover to the other drug (after 
2-4 week washout period) and take either allopurinol or placebo for an additional 4 weeks. Allopurinol will be 
prescribed in 300mg tablets. At visit 2 and 4, participants will be given a 5-week (with an additional 7 days to 
account for variability in appt availability) supply of medication. During visits 3 and 5 study staff will count pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] 
(any extra will be discarded) to determine compliance. Allopurinol and placebo prescriptions will be 
administered by [CONTACT_223385], daily doses will be administered by [CONTACT_223386].

14c. General Instructions for Completing Forms in REDCap 
All data recorded in REDCap will be maintained according to FDA and ICH Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
guidelines. Instructions for completing eCRFs to ensure quality and consistency in data collection are below.  
 
Sample instructions:  When completing electronic study forms participants should only be identified by [CONTACT_223400]. Identification (ID) numbers will be used to reference the participant in all other 
eCRFs. 
 
Header: Complete the header information in every field, including fields for which no study data are recorded. 
From the drop down box choose Not Applicable, Unknown, or UNK for fields where no data can be provided.  
 
Participant ID:   The participant ID will be prepopulated in the header of each page.  
 
Time: Use a 24 hour clock (e.g., 14:00 to indicate 2:00 p.m.) unless otherwise specified. 
 
Dates: All dates will be verified by [CONTACT_9137]. Historical dates are sometimes not known (e.g., date 
of first symptom); in this case, chose Not Applicable, UNKNOWN or UNK to indicate missing data. 
 
Abbreviations:  Do not use of abbreviations not specifically noted in the instructions for completing the forms. 
Comments should only be written where text fields to do so are provided. 
Correcting errors:  Errors can be corrected within the REDCap system where a timestamp and date are 
associated with each entry and revision.

CORT) 
 
 
4/12/2018 Protocol Version 9  Page 50 of 64 
 
  
Completion of forms: 
All forms must be completed and saved in REDCap. The study team member responsible for the entry of data 
into the REDCap system must ensure that all fields have been entered and that the form has been saved and 
marked as complete. If a form cannot be completed or data cannot be verified the form should be marked 
incomplete or unverified. Forms should only be marked unverified if PI [INVESTIGATOR_223303]. This 
may include questions surrounding lab or FMD values recorded in REDCap.  
 
14d. Missing or Incomplete data 
Data may not be available to complete the eform for various reasons. Electronic forms that are missing or not 
complete should be noted, in the REDCap system as INCOMPLETE and saved. Forms with missing data in fields 
or sections should be marked as INCOMPLETE in the REDCap form. Indicate the reason for the missing data in 
the text field when available. If the evaluation was not done, type NOT DONE or ND and provide a reason in 
the available text field or from the dropdown.  
 
Incomplete or Illegible forms:  
If any section or an entire page of the forms cannot be completed (e.g., no parts have any responses), and it is 
unlikely that it will be completed, choose or type NOT DONE/ND, NOT AVAILABLE/NA or NOT APPLICABLE, as 
appropriate in the text field. Do not leave forms incomplete or unused without explanation.  
 
All form header information must be completed even though no data are recorded on the electronic form. If 
an electronic form can only be partially completed at the time of visit, but will be completed when the 
information becomes available, note this in the MISSING FORMS / INCOMPLETE FORMS field and follow the 
direction of the study coordinator and principal investigator.  
 
Every effort should be made to obtain and ensure that the electronic forms are being completed correctly.  
 
14e. Retention of Study Documentation 
Investigators will adhere to rigorous requirements and should retain forms and all other study documents for 
a period of no less than [ADDRESS_268854] manager and 
study statistician. All data will be entered into electronic case report study forms using the REDCap (Research 
Electronic Data Capture) system. REDCap is a secure web application for building and managing online surveys 
and databases. REDCap provides audit trails for tracking data manipulation and user activity, as well as 
automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to Excel, PDF, and common statistical packages 
(SPSS, SAS, Stata, R). From REDCap all data will be exported into SAS files and stored on a secure and

CORT) 
 
 
4/12/[ADDRESS_268855] (IRB) policies, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, and Federal regulations. 
Since this is a single site study, no data will be transmitted between sites.  
 
15a. External Data 
The UAB Arthritis Clinical Intervention Program (ACIP) and Hypertension Clinic will handle all laboratory data 
collection. No external data will be collected. All Serum and DNA will be processed and stored in the lab of S. 
Louis Bridges, MD, PhD-the UAB CORT co-director. Serum and DNA processing and storage will be done by [CONTACT_223401] (see Appendix 3). The study coordinator will be 
responsible for the labeling and transport of all blood samples. The study coordinator will collect the lab 
results and record in the eCRFs for each study participant. 
 
15b. Data Entry  
A database will be designed for the current study in the REDCap system. These computerized templates, are 
accessible through a secure web interface. Data entered into the system will be downloaded weekly and the 
database will have range and validity checks built in. All abnormal values will be flagged for further 
investigation.  Research staff performing data entry will be trained in the use of the REDCap system and the 
study database. The study statistician will develop validity checks for outlier values, consistency, and 
completeness and will notify the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_223304].  Discrepancies will be 
adjudicated by [CONTACT_223402]. Once data entry is complete, the study data will 
be transferred to SAS statistical software and reviewed by [CONTACT_30165].   
 
16. Safety Monitoring and Reporting 
The following defines the types of adverse events that study staff should inquire about at each visit. The type 
and possible causes of the adverse event will be discussed with the principal investigator, an examination will 
be conducted if deemed necessary, and it will be reported to the required parties. It is the responsibility of 
each and every study staff member to determine the appropriate line of action, to take the action agreed 
upon with the participant, and to subsequently report the event. 
 
 Adverse Event (AE) - An AE is any unfavorable and unintended diagnosis, sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporarily associated with the study intervention, which 
may or may not be related to the intervention. AEs include any new events not present during the pre-
intervention period or events that were present during the pre-intervention period which have 
increased in severity.

  Serious Adverse Event (SAE) - An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that results is life-
threatening, requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], causes persistent or significant disability/incapacity, 
results in congenital anomalies/birth defects, in death, or, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_7372], 
represents other significant hazards or potentially serious harm to research participants or others. All 
SAEs will be reported to the Safety officer (via KAI), Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB), and IRB 
within 48 hours of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_223305]. 
 Unexpected adverse event: Any adverse event, the specificity, frequency or severity of which is not 
consistent with either: 
o the known or foreseeable risk of adverse events associated with the procedures involved in the 
research that are described in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved 
research protocol, any applicable investigator brochure, the current IRB-approved informed 
consent document, and other relevant sources of information, such as product labeling and 
package inserts; or 
o the expected natural progression of any underlying disease or condition of the participant(s) 
experiencing the adverse event . 
 
 
All AEs should be collected, analyzed, and monitored by [CONTACT_223403] 
(REDCap). All laboratory abnormalities identified in the protocol as critical to participant safety must be 
reported. All AEs experienced by [CONTACT_223404], as outlined in the protocol. The following delineates specific responsibilities of 
staff members:  
 
 The research coordinator will complete the Adverse Event Form and AE Tracking Log in REDCap; assist 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_12344], and Safety Officer of all the SAEs, and assist them to prepare SAE reports to 
IRB, and Safety Officer. 
 The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_223306]; be available to answer any questions that the coordinators may have concerning AEs; 
notify the IRB, FDA of all SAEs and AEs as appropriate. 
 
The study coordinator will confirm that the AEs are correctly entered into the Adverse Event form and log in 
REDCap. They will confirm that the adverse events are reported to the appropriate regulatory bodies, as 
required. Additionally the project Safety Officer will receive safety tables every [ADDRESS_268856] 2: The Effects of Urate Lowering Therapy on Inflammation, Endothelial Function, and Blood Pressure (NIAMS:

Medical Journal Editors guidelines (N Engl J Med 1991;324:424-8). First authors are expected to delete names 
from the final list of authors if those individuals have not satisfied criteria for authorship in accordance with 
those guidelines. The first author on proposed or active writing projects will be decided on by [CONTACT_46776]’s 
Publication Working Group. The project’s Publication Working Group will develop a listing of first (lead), 
second and senior (last) author for all potential reports. In general, the researcher who first conceived of the 
project and submitted a plan for the manuscript should have the option of serving as first author. Conflicts in 
first authorship should be resolved by [CONTACT_223414]. In the event that the 
Publication Working Group is unable to resolve a conflict, the UAB CORT Executive Committee will adjudicate 
and may assign the first authorship. 
 
All project manuscripts must be approved by [CONTACT_223415]. The UAB CORT Executive Committee will assist in the review of all manuscripts or scientific 
presentations with the goal to ensure their content and face validity.  
 
UAB CORT project investigators are required to inform and submit copi[INVESTIGATOR_223318], posters, presentations, slides and manuscripts. It is the responsibility of the first 
(lead) author to ensure that appropriate journal submission procedure is adhered to. Any substantial changes 
to an approved manuscript prior to publication whether required by [CONTACT_223416], must be discussed 
with the co-authors. The co-authors should receive the proposed re-submissions at least [ADDRESS_268862] 2: The Effects of Urate Lowering Therapy on Inflammation, Endothelial Function, and Blood Pressure (NIAMS:

placebo or a dose (300mg) of allopurinol. You  will not know whether you are  receiving  allopurinol or the 
inactive placebo. All  participants will receive  placebo at some  point in the  study. During the screening  visit, 
you will be  given a two-week supply of study medication. You  will take one pi[INVESTIGATOR_223325] 8 
and 10 am. 
Blood Tests: Blood will be drawn five times during this study. Needle sticks are painful for  short period of time  
and sometimes will bruise at the spot  for a couple  of days. You might  feel dizzy  or faint during a
blood draw  but this generally  passes within a few minutes. Each time we  draw blood,  we will take
approximately about 1½ tablespoons  of blood.  We will do several tests including ones to make  sure it is safe to 
use the  study medicines,  to look  for any side  effects of the study medicine and to measure several chemicals 
in the  blood  that  control blood vessels  and blood pressure.
Urine Test and Collection:  Women capable  of becoming pregnant will have a urine pregnancy test to exclude 
pregnancy at the beginning  of the study before enrollment. The study doctor or study staff will tell you if the 
pregnancy test results  are positive.  The results of  the pregnancy test must be negative  in order for you to be in 
the study. At  visits 1-5, urine  will be collected from men and women using a collection cup.   Will  do several 
tests including ones  to make sure  it is safe to use  the study medicines, to look for any  side effects  of the study 
medicine and to measure  several chemicals in the urine that affect blood  pressure.
Blood Pressure Tests: We  will do two  types of blood pressure  tests during this study.  The first will use a
common blood pressure cuff just like in any doctor's office. At each visit we will measure blood
pressure twice on each arm. The second blood pressure test is called  ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. 
You will wear a blood pressure cuff on one arm for [ADDRESS_268868] blood pressure 2-3 times an hour while  you are at home,  work, or school. 
Flow Mediated Dilation  (FMD): At visits 2-5 a FMD will be done  to measure the  function  of your blood vessels. 
You will wear a cuff, similar  to a blood  pressure cuff, on your  upper and lower arm  while an  image of your 
blood vessel is  recorded. 
Survey: At visits  2-5, you will complete a survey that asks questions about your feelings and  behavior.  The 
survey will  take approximately  5 minutes to complete.
Screening Visit (Visit 1)
Before the study starts, you will be  asked to  sign this consent form  and give your  health  history.  The study 
doctor will perform  procedures and  tests to  find out if you can  be in the  study. These tests include:
Version 04/12/2018 Page  3 of 9Review inclusion and exclusion criteria  to assess your eligibility for the  study.
Recording of  your personal information, such as your name, age, race, etc.
Recording of  your medical  and surgical history including documentation of blood  pressure.
Recording of  all prior and current prescription medications, over  the counter medications,  vitamins and  
herbs. The study doctor may  instruct  you  not to take certain medications within 48 hours of the  next 
visit.
Measurement of your pulse rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_2842] (your breathing rate), temperature, height, and 
weight.
A complete physical  exam. You  should ask  the study doctor about what will happen during this exam.
Collection  of urine  and blood samples (about 1½ tablespoons of blood)  for clinical  laboratory analysis 
and pregnancy screening for women of childbearing potential. The study  doctor or study staff will tell 
you if the pregnancy test results  are positive. The results of the pregnancy test must be negative in 
order for you  to be in the  study
Visits 2, 3, 4, 5
You will return to the UAB Hypertension Clinic every  2-4 weeks (weeks 3, 6, 9, and 12) for scheduled clinic 
visits. These clinic visits will last about 60 minutes  (1 hour). During these visits you will have your blood drawn, 
urine collected, blood  pressure measured  and a flow mediated dilation  will be performed  to evaluate 
endothelial function. You  will be given  a 24-hour blood pressure monitoring device and will have the  
opportunity to report any problems or  concerns  you have. Additionally, you will be given a survey that  will 
take approximately 5 minutes to  complete.
Starting at Visit 2 (week  3) you will be  given  a 4-week supply of allopurinol  or placebo. You will take one pi[INVESTIGATOR_223326] 8 and 10 am.  Neither the physician  nor you will know  if you are taking 
allopurinol or placebo. At  visit 4 you  will receive a new 4-week supply of supply of allopurinol or placebo. All  
participants will receive  placebo at some point in the study.
The following procedures will  be performed at Visits 2, 3, 4, 5:
Confirm you did not exercise, smoke,  drink any caffeinated  beverages, or eat or drink  grapefruit for at 
least two  hours  prior to this visit
Review of your current medications and  any medical complaints or improvements  you may have had 
since your  last visit.
Measurement of your blood pressure and heart  rate between 6:30 am and 10 am.
Collection  of fasting blood samples (about 1.5  tablespoons of blood) for  clinical laboratory analysis. If 
you are not fasting  at least [ADDRESS_268869] 8 hours before  the 
study visit.
A flow mediated dilation  will be  performed. 
You will be assigned a 24-hour  blood  pressure  monitor and provided materials to return it to the  UAB  
Hypertension Clinic in the provided stamped addressed box.  
You will complete a brief  survey.

POSSIBLE HAZARDS, RISKS,  AND  DISCOMFORTS OF PARTICIPATING IN  THE STUDY
Participation in this study may involve  some inconvenience, risks, or discomforts.  The most  common  side 
effect for allopurinol is stomach upset. Allopurinol can also rarely irritate the liver or cause blood counts to fall 
and changes to blood, skin, and liver are not always  reversible.
Another uncommon side effect of allopurinol is skin rash.  Very rarely (less than  one in one-thousand people)  
this skin rash may  be followed by a severe reaction known as  allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome  (AHS), a 
condition that may become life-threatening.   You should not  take part  in the  study if you have  ever had a  
serious reaction to allopurinol.  You  should tell the study  doctor immediately if you have a rash or another 
allergic reaction during the study.   
Version 04/12/2018 Page  5 of 9Other side effects  of allopurinol include:
• diarrhea
• nausea
• Drowsiness (sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]) 
Ask the study doctor if you have  questions about these  or other risks  of taking allopurinol.
Venous blood  sampling will rarely  cause bruising or a  superficial skin infection.  
The 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure  monitoring can cause some mild discomfort  during cuff inflation. The 
[ADDRESS_268870] use an effective 
non-hormonal form of birth control during this  study  and for  30 days  after  completion of the study.   
Acceptable methods of  birth control  include  a double-barrier method (diaphragm with spermicide, condom  
with spermicide) or abstinence.  
If you suspect that  you may have  become pregnant  during the study, you must contact [CONTACT_223420].   If it is confirmed that you are pregnant, you will be 
withdrawn from the study.  Your study  doctor  may  want to follow you and the outcome  of your pregnancy.  
Your pregnant partner may be asked  for permission  for the study doctor to follow the pregnancy to its 
outcome.  
Taking allopurinol may involve unknown risks  to a nursing infant.  If you are breastfeeding,  you cannot 
participate in the  study.
ALTERNATIVE 
The alternative  is to not participate in this study and receive standard care for  high blood pressure.
SIGNIFICANT NEW  FINDINGS
All new  findings discovered  during this research study that may reasonably  influence your  willingness  to 
continue participation in  this study  will be  provided  to you when they become  available.

MOOP Appendix 3- Revised 4/12/[ADDRESS_268874] Operating Procedure - Obtaining Consent  
1. The informed consent will be obtained before any study procedures are performed 
(including washout from any medications). 
2. Study coordinator will check the shared drive to ensure the correct and current IRB  
approved consent form is used for consenting. 
3. Use the most recently approved consent form to give to the patient. 
4. All patient will be given adequate time to read the informed consent in a quiet room. 
5. Study coordinator will administer the informed consent and will provide an opportunity  
to discuss any questions the patient might have. [CONTACT_223445] will also be available 
to answer any questions prior to or on the day of enrollment of the patient into a study. 
 
Review the following details with the patient: risks, benefits, alternative treatments,  
length of the study, interval of visits including time involvement, purpose of the study,  
any placebo use, FDA approval of medication, procedures to be performed along with 
risks, side effects of drug(s) used, need for compliance in the study, and benefits. 
 
6. Any patient who states either they cannot see or cannot read will have the consent read 
to them 
7. After the consenting process is completed the patient will sign and date each required 
page. Verify participant signatures and authorization to store lab samples for future use  
(not required for participation). 
8. Review the consent for completeness of signatures and dates. 
9. After the participant has signed the consent form, the Principle Investigator and/or the  
study coordinator must sign and date the Informed Consent document. 
10. A signed version of the consent form will be kept by [CONTACT_223425]. 
11. An additional copy of the signed consent form will be given to the patient the same day  
along with the visit reminder brochure and instruction for ambulatory blood pressure  
monitor. 
MOOP Appendix 3- Revised 4/12/[ADDRESS_268875] 5 minutes. The patient’s legs should be 
uncrossed with his or her feet flat on the floor. The arm to be used for assessing blood 
pressure must be exposed and free of constrictive clothing and supported by a table or  
armrest.  The patient should remain quiet during the examination process. 
 
2. Sphygmomanometer Placement 
 
The sphygmomanometer should be at the eye level of the examiner. The cuff when 
placed on the  patient’s arm should be at his or her heart level. 
 
3. Proper Cuff Size 
 
The arm circumference is measured at the midpoint of the upper arm, between the  
olecranon and the acromion processes.  Arm circumferences of 22 cm-26.9 cm require use  
of a small adult/pediatric cuff; arm circumferences between 27cm-32.9 cm require a regular 
adult cuff; circumferences between 33 and 40.9 cm require use of a large adult cuff; arm  
circumferences between 41cm and 52cm require use of a thigh cuff. 
 
4. Cuff Placement 
 
Locate the patient’s brachial artery at the midpoint of the upper arm. Wrap the cuff 
smoothly and snugly around the arm with the bladder center directly over the palpated  
artery and lower edge of the cuff 2.5 cm above the antecubital fossa. 
 
5. Procedure 
 
Press the START/STOP button. The cuff will inflate automatically. The patient should remain 
still and not move their arm prior to measurement completion. Inflation stops automatically 
and the measured is started. When complete, the arm cuff automatically deflates and 
SBP/DBP and HR are displayed. A minimum of [ADDRESS_268876] 
MOOP Appendix 3- Revised 4/12/[ADDRESS_268877], ensure proper placement of stethoscope directly 
over the brachial artery, attempt using the diaphragm of the stethoscope instead of the  
bell, and/or have the patient hold his or her arm upright for a few minutes before repeating  
procedures. 
 
C. Standard Operating Procedure – Brachial Artery Ultrasound Protocol (Flow Mediated  
Dilation) 
FMD are recorded on tapes, but simultaneously digitalized all recording can be electronically 
emailed and archived. This ensures that all investigators can easily exchange recordings, peer- 
review recordings, analyze data over the study period. Project Co-investigator [CONTACT_223446] will administer and monitor all FMDs. 
 
Ultrasound machine: Philips Agilent SONOS 5500, the ultrasound head is 15-6L. 
Software system to be used: Vascular Research Tool 5, by [CONTACT_223426], LLC. 
Steps: 
1. Baseline 
 Acquire 15 baseline 2D images 
 Acquire 10 cycles of baseline Doppler 
 
2. Inflation 
Inflate cuff pressure 50 mm/Hg>SBP (or until vessel occludes) for 5 minutes 
 
3. Deflation 
 Acquire 10 cycles of hyperemic Doppler 
 Acquire [ADDRESS_268878] Operating Procedure- 24-hour Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring  
Twenty-four hour ABPM monitors (Spacelabs Healthcare, Snoqualmie, WA) are to be worn by 
[CONTACT_223427] 24-hour period. 
Software system: Reports of 24-hour ABPM are available as PDF and can be easily exported to 
an EXCEL database. 
Monitor: [ZIP_CODE], [ADDRESS_268879] cuff size before beginning. 
 Wrap the cuff around the patients upper arm without sliding the arm through 
the sleeve 
 Use the color coded RANGE indicator on the inside of the cuff and the bold 
INDEX marker to check that the arm circumference falls within the cuff range 
 If the arm is within range, this cuff is the correct. If the measurement is outside  
the RANGE indicator, select a new cuff size as indicated by [CONTACT_68458]. 
2. Apply the Cuff 
 Simply slide the sleeve up the patients arm, ensuring the artery arrow points 
MOOP Appendix 3- Revised 4/12/[ADDRESS_268880] between the elbow and shoulder. 
 Be sure the artery indicator is over the patient’s brachial artery, between the 
biceps and triceps muscles (see illustration below) 
 
 Wrap the cuff snugly around the patients upper arm 
 Take the initial BP reading and ensure hook up is working properly. 
 
3. Prepare the Patient 
Preparing the patient is the most important step in obtaining accurate, reliable blood 
pressure measurement. 
The following must be reviewed with all participants: 
 
 Avoid excess movement during readings 
 Relax the instrumented arm, slightly away from body 
 Avoid hand movement 
 Avoid flexing muscles during reading 
 Do not remove the cuff between readings 
E. Standard Operating Procedure- Adverse And Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
1. Definition 
The International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Good Clinical Practice defines an 
adverse event as an “untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a 
causal relationship with this treatment.” An Adverse Event can become a Serious 
Adverse Event. A Serious Adverse Event is defined by [CONTACT_189458] “any untoward medical 
occurrence that at any dose: 
 results in death, 
 is life-threatening, 
 requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4967], 
 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
or 
 is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 
2. Observation 
At each visit after screening during the study, a patient will be queried and observed in 
an objective manner for any changes in signs or symptoms or any new signs or  
symptoms that may have occurred since the preceding visit. If any adverse event has 

MOOP Appendix 3- Revised 4/12/2018 Page 5 of 11  
 occurred, the investigator or a designated member of his staff will determine the  
following in regards to the adverse event: 
 the location of the sign or symptom 
 
 the time of the start and end of the sign or symptom 
 
 the clinical description and measurement of the sign or symptom 
 
 how the sign or symptom came about in terms of setting, activity, or previous 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] 
 possible causes of the sign or symptom 
 
 the intensity of the sign or symptom 
 
 the degree to which the sign or symptom may be related to the study drug. 
 
 
3. Management 
The investigator or a designated staff member will take action to assure that patient  
receives whatever treatment for the adverse event is required or appropriate, either by  
[CONTACT_223428] a physician of the  
patient’s choice, such as the patient’s primary care physician. The investigator or a 
designated staff member will continue to follow the patient with regard to the progress  
and/or resolution of the adverse event. 
Whether the study medication should be interrupted or discontinued in response to an 
adverse event is a determination made at the investigator’s discretion unless it is 
specified in the study protocol. If an acute emergency arises in the patient’s condition, 
the randomization code may be broken, if this is required for the welfare of the patient. 
 
4. Documentation 
The description of the adverse event, including all of the above observations and 
management, will be recorded in Adverse Event Form, in REDCap and printed for the  
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_223332]. This 
signed document will be archived electronically and in hard copy in the study binder. 
 
5. Reporting 
It is the responsibility of the investigator to report any adverse event to the sponsor and 
the institutional review board (IRB) of the study as soon as possible or “within 10 
working days after the investigator learns of the adverse event.” (ICH) If the Adverse  
Event is determined to be a Serious Adverse Event (SAE), it is the responsibility of the  
investigator to report the Serious Adverse Event to the sponsor immediately, and no 
later than 48 hours. Appropriate reports will be filed or faxed to the sponsor according  
to the study protocol. 
 
F. General Instructions for Completing Forms in REDCap  
 
MOOP Appendix 3- Revised 4/12/2018 Page 6 of 11  
 All data recorded in REDCap will be maintained according to FDA and ICH Good Clinical Practice  
(GCP) guidelines. Instructions for completing eCRFs to ensure quality and consistency in data  
collection are below. 
 
When completing electronic study forms participants must not be identified by [CONTACT_223429] (e.g. lab reports). Replace the participant name [CONTACT_223439] (ID) number. 
 
Participant ID:  The participant ID will be prepopulated in the header of each page. 
 
Dates: All dates will be entered using the calendar feature in REDCap. For AEs historical dates  
are sometimes not known (e.g., date of first symptom); in this case, chose Not Applicable,  
UNKNOWN or UNK to indicate missing data. 
 
Abbreviations: Do not use abbreviations not specifically noted in the instructions for  
completing the forms. Comments should only be written where text fields are provided. 
 
Correcting errors: Errors can be corrected within the REDCap system where a timestamp and 
date are associated with each entry and revision.  
 
Missing or Incomplete data  
Data may not be available to complete the eform for various reasons. Electronic forms that are  
missing or not complete should be noted, in the field INCOMPLETE/UNVERIFIED field and 
brought to the attention of the investigator. Forms with missing data in fields or sections should 
be marked as such. Indicate the reason for the missing data in the field. If the evaluation was 
not done, type NOT DONE or ND and provide a reason in the available text field or from the  
dropdown. 
 
Incomplete or Illegible forms:  
If any section or an entire page of the forms cannot be completed (e.g., no parts have any  
responses), and it is unlikely that it will be completed, choose INCOMPLETE/UNVERIFIED, as 
appropriate. Do not leave forms incomplete or unused without explanation in the MISSING 
FORMS / INCOMPLETE FORMS field. 
 
All form header information must be completed even though no data are recorded on the  
electronic form. If an electronic form can only be partially completed at the time of visit, but  
will be completed when the information becomes available, note this in the  
INCOMPLETE/UNVERIFIED field and follow the direction of the study coordinator and principle 
investigator. 
 
Every effort should be made to obtain and ensure that the electronic forms are being  
completed correctly.

 H. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) Assay for Allopurinol and Oxypurinol in Plasma 
 
Allopurinol and oxypurinol in plasma (extraction protocol above) were analysed by [CONTACT_223432] 
(UV) detection. Plasma (0.1 ml) was mixed with 0.1 ml of water, vortexed briefly and 0.1 ml of 1 M 
perchloric acid added to precipi[INVESTIGATOR_223337]. After centrifugation, 20 l of supernatant was injected 
into the HPLC system. Chromatographic separation was performed on a C8 column (Agilent Zorbax 
Eclipse XDB-C8 5 m, 150 x 4.6 mm i.d.). The mobile phase was 0.01 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 3.5 
containing 0.8% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Eluting peaks were detected at [ADDRESS_268887] curves were linear ( r2>0.99) up to 294 µmol/L. Absolute recoveries from plasma 
were >90% for both allopurinol (at 1.2, 37 and 294 µmol/L) and oxypurinol (at 1.0, 33 and 263 µmol/L). 
Intra- and inter-day coefficients of variation at the above concentrations were <9%, and the limit of 
quantification was 0.2 mol/L, for both allopurinol and oxypurinol. All the plasma samples were analysed 
in duplicate and the mean values used in subsequent analyses.

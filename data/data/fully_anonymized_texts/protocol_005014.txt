Device Deficiencies  
A device deficiency is inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, 
durability, reliability, safety, or performance. A device deficiency may or may not be 
associated with patient harm (i .e., ADE or SADE); however, not all ADEs or SADEs are due 
to a device deficiency. The Investigator should determine the applicable category listed in the 
Device Deficiency eCRF for the identified or suspect device deficiency and report any patient 
harm separa tely. Examples of device deficiencies include the following:  
• Failure to meet product specifications (e .g., incorrect lens power/diameter/base 
curve/color)  
• Lens/solution cloudy  
• Lens surface/edge defect  
• Torn lens during handling/in pack  
• Packaging deficit (e.g., mislabeled product, tampered seal, leaking bottle/container)  
• Suspect product contamination

biomicroscopy findings, subjective ratings questionnaires)  evaluated during the study are to 
be reviewed by [CONTACT_737]. Any untoward (unfavorable and unintended)  change in a 
protocol -specific parameter or questionnaire response  that is clinically relevant, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], is to be reported as an AE. These clinically relevant changes will 
be reported regardless of causality.   
11.3 Procedures for Reco rding and Reporting  
AEs are collected from the time of informed consent Any pre -existing medical conditions or 
signs/symptoms present in a subject prior to the start of the study (i.e., before informed 
consent is signed) are not considered AEs in the study  and should be recorded in the Medical 
History section of the eCRF.  
In addition, temporary lens awareness or visual changes during the fitting process are not 
considered AEs if the Investigator assesses that the symptom(s) can reasonably resolve within 
the anticipated adaptation period.  
For each recorded event, the ADEs and SAEs documentation must include: date of 
occurrence, severity, treatment (if applicable), outcome, and assessments of the seriousness 
and causality. In addition, the Investigator must d ocument all device deficiencies reported or 
observed with test and comparator products on the Device Deficiency eCRF. The site must 
submit all available information on ADEs, SAEs, and device deficiencies to the study sponsor 
immediately as follows:  
• ADEs or  SAEs  are documented on the Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Device 
Effect eCRF within 24 hours of the Investigator ’s or site ’s awareness .  
• Device deficiencies are documented on the Device Deficiency eCRF within 24 hours 
of the Investigator ’s or site ’s awareness .  
• Additional relevant information after initial reporting must be entered into the eCRF as 
soon as the data become available.   
• Document any changes to concomitant medications on the appropriate eCRFs.  
• Document all relevant information from Disch arge Summary, Autopsy Report,

Any AEs and device deficiencies for non -study marketed devices/products ( i.e., CLEAR 
CARE  Cleaning & Disinfecting Solution , will be considered and processed as spontaneous 
(following the post -market vigilance procedures) and should be communicated to the 
device ’s/product ’s manufacturer as per local requirements.  
Study sponsor representatives may be contact[CONTACT_271455].  
Further, depending upon the nature of the AE or device deficiency being reported, the study 
sponsor may request copi[INVESTIGATOR_13271] ’s medical records. The 
Investi gator must also report all AEs and device deficiencies that could have led to a SADE 
according to the requirements of regulatory authorities or IRB/IEC.  
Intensity and Causality Assessments  
Where appropriate, the Investigator must assess the intensity (seve rity) of the AE based on 
medical judgment with consideration of any subjective symptom(s), as defined below:  
Intensity (Severity)  
Mild  An AE is mild if the subject is aware of but can easily tolerate the sign 
or symptom.  
Moderate  An AE is moderate if the  sign or symptom results in discomfort 
significant enough to cause interference with the subject ’s usual 
activities.  
Severe  An AE is severe if the sign or symptom is incapacitating and results in 
the subject ’s inability to work or engage in their usual ac tivities.  
For every AE in the study, the Investigator must assess the causality (Related or Not Related 
to the medical device or study procedure). An assessment of causality will also be performed 
by [CONTACT_432574], as shown below:

Alcon – Business Use Only  Causality  
Related  An AE classified as related may be either definitely related or possibly 
related where a direct cause and effect relationship with the medical 
device or study procedure has not been demonstrated, but there is a 
reasonable possibili ty that the AE was caused by [CONTACT_271457].  
Not Related  An AE classified as not related may either be definitely unrelated or 
simply unlikely to be related (i .e., there are other more likely causes 
for the AE).  
The study sponsor wi ll assess the AEs and may upgrade the Investigator ’s assessment of 
seriousness and/or causality. The study sponsor will notify the Investigator of any AEs that is 
upgraded from non -serious to serious or from unrelated to related .

Alcon – Business Use Only  11.6 Follow -Up of Subjects w ith Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for adequate and safe medical care of subjects during the 
study and for ensuring that appropriate medical care and relevant follow -up procedures are 
maintained after the study.  
The Investigator should provide the study sponsor with any new safety information (which 
includes new AEs and changes to previously reported AEs) that may affect the safety 
evaluation of the device. For AEs that are unresolved/ ongoing at time of discontin uation, any 
additional information received at follow -up should be documented in the eCRFs up to study 
completion (i.e., database lock).  Any additional data received up to [ADDRESS_548116] 
completed the study should be documented and available upon the study sponsor ’s request.    
All complaints received after this time period will be considered and processed as 
spontaneous (following the post -market vigilance procedures) and should be communicated 
to the medical device ’s manufacturer as per local req uirements.  The Investigator should also 
report complaints on non -Alcon products directly to the manufacturer as per the 
manufacturer ’s instructions or local regulatory requirements . 
11.7 Pregnancy in the Clinical Study

12.2.1  Safety Analysis Set  
Safety analyses will be conducted using the safety analysis set on a treatment -emergent basis. 
As such, the safety analysis set will include all subjects/eyes exposed to any study lenses 
evaluated in this study.  
. , any AE or device 
deficiency occurring after Informed Consent and prior to the initial exposure to the study 
lenses (test or comparator) under evaluat ion in this clinical protocol will be listed as pre -
treatment.  
For treatment -emergent safety analyses, subjects/eyes will be categorized under the actual 
study lenses exposed in the corresponding lens sequence.  
12.2.2  Full Analysis Set  
The full analysis set (FAS ) is the set of all randomized subjects who are exposed to any study 
lenses evaluated in this study, except for lenses used for lens fitting at Visit 1 . 
12.2.3  Per Protocol Analysis Set  
The per protocol (PP) analysis set is a subset of FAS and excludes all data/subjects that have 
met any of the critical deviation or evaluability criteria identified in the Deviation and 
Evaluability Plan.

12.4.1  Analysis of Primary Effectiveness Endpoi nt(s)  
The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate noninferiority in visual acuity at 
distance when wearing  MF contact [CONTACT_432577], 
after 30 days of wear.  
The primary endpoint is binocular HC/HI VA at distance  (4 m or 3 m) at Day 30.  This VA is 
collected with study lenses, on the logMAR scale.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Statistical Hypotheses  
The null and alternative hypotheses are formulated in terms of the predefined margin of 0.05 
for noninferiority : 
H0: μ(T) – μ(C) ≥ 0.05  
Ha: μ(T) – μ(C) < 0.05  
 
where μ(T) and μ(C) denote the mean distance binocular HC/HI V A at Day 30 for  MF 
and AOHG MF , respectively, on the logMAR scale.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis Methods  
A mixed effects repeated measures model will be utilized to test these hypotheses. The model 
will include terms for lens, visit, lens by [CONTACT_23259], period, sequence , and habitual lens 
stratum . Within -subject correlation due to the crossover design will also be accounted for in 
the model. Lens difference (  MF minus AOHG MF)  and the corresponding one -sided 
95% upper confidence limit will be computed at Day 30. Noninferiority in distance VA will 
be declared if upper confidence limit is less than 0.05.

 [ADDRESS_107324] cancer (BC) is the second leading cause of cancer death for women in the [LOCATION_002].1 However, an 
estimated 6- 15% of women are at high (≥20%2) lifetime risk based on personal health factors, family BC histo ry, or 
pathogenic genetic mutations (e.g., BRCA1/2 ). Compared to the general population, these women are nearly twice 
as likely to develop BC. For them, screening guidelines include annual supplemental magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI).3-[ADDRESS_107325] MRI significantly increases cancer detection compared to 
mammography alone6 However, estimated uptake of MRI in high risk women is only 1- 7%.7-[ADDRESS_107326] MRI among women with high BC risk.  
 Prior research on BC screening in the general population has identified patient, provider, and system -level 
barriers.
14-17 However, there are unique barriers/facilitators to screening breast MRI, above and beyond those for 
population -level BC screening.[ADDRESS_107327] MRI utilization to inform future 
interventions.  The Health Services Utilization Model (HSUM)
21 will guide the selection of specific patient -level factors 
for examination, including predisposing characteristics (knowledge, health/cultural beliefs), enabling resources 
(social support, cost/insurance coverage), and perceived need (perceived susceptibi lity, provider recommendation). 
Using a mixed methods approach, the aims of this study are to:  
 
Aim 1: Assess HSUM factors influencing screening breast MRI utilization in a community -based sample 
(N=300). Approach: Women with high (≥20%) lifetime BC risk (N= 300) will be recruited at Moffitt Cancer Center 
(MCC) and Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC). To identify specific factors impacting breast MRI utilization, we will sample women who are adherent to mammography  screening (6 -15% of whom have 
≥20% risk). Patients will self -report predisposing characteristics, enabling resources, perceived need  for, and receipt 
of MRI in the past 12 months. Hypothesis : Lack of MRI uptake will be associated with predisposing charact eristics 
related to lower preventive service use (less knowledge, higher fatalism), fewer enabling resources (less social 
support, higher cost/less insurance coverage), and less perceived need for screening breast MRI (lower perceived 
susceptibility, lack of provider recommendation for screening) . 
 
Aim 2: Confirm, refine, or expand our conceptual model of screening breast MRI utilization  through in-depth 
semi -structured qualitative interviews with  a subset of Aim 1 patients (N=30).  Approach : We will purposi vely 
select information- rich cases from Aim 1 (N=30) for semi -structured qualitative interviews exploring factors impacting 
utilization of screening breast MRI. Research Question: Are there additional barriers/facilitators of MRI uptake not 
specified in the HSUM ? 
 Our long- term goal is to develop and test a community -based, multilevel intervention to increase screening breast 
MRI among high risk women. This study represents the first step in a new line of research, specifically focusing on  
developi[INVESTIGATOR_97334], risk -based cancer screening approaches. Successful completion 
of this study will provide an explanatory framework for screening breast MRI utilization. This explanatory framework 
will inform our program of research, ultimately leading to the development and testing of a community -based, 
multilevel intervention to increase screening breast MRI among high risk women. Given that early detection through 
screening MRI is a novel, important, and underutilized approach to prevention in high- risk populations, this research 
has potential for wide impact to improve guideline- concordant care and subsequent public health outcomes.  
 
   
 [ADDRESS_107328] cancer (BC) screening modalities are recommended for women at elevated BC risk.  
In screening mammography populations, an estimated 6- 15% of patients are at elevated BC risk (lifetime risk 
≥20%2) based on personal health factors, family BC history, or pathogenic genetic mutations (e.g., BRCA1/2 ).22-
25 Statistical models incorporating these risk factors are used to estimate lifetime BC risk,26-28 and national 
guidelines support their routine use to identify those with elevated BC risk.5,29 Once identified, the National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), American Cancer Society (ACS), and American College of Radiology 
(ACR) recommen d that high risk women receive annual mammography and supplemental breast magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI).4,5,30 In high risk women, MRI significantly increases BC detection (20 -30 additional 
cancers per 1,000 women screened) compared to mammography alone.6 MRI has high sensitivity (71- 100% v. 
16-40% for mammography) in high‐ risk populations, and detects small and node- negative invasive tumors and 
higher grade DCIS that are less likely to contribute to over -diagnosis.  
 
Breast MRI is underutilized among high risk women.7,11 Among identified BRCA1/2  carriers – a very select 
subpopulation of high risk women receiving personalized genetic risk information and screening recommendations – uptake of breast MRI is significantly lower than other breast screening options (e.g., 24- 48% 
versus 43- 82% for annual mammography).
11-[ADDRESS_107329] MRI: estimated uptake of MRI in the overall population of high risk women ranges from 1 -7%.7-[ADDRESS_107330] MRI.  
 
The proposed research is theoretically driven. The Health 
Services Utilization Model  (HSUM; Figure 1)21 states that 
health- related service use is a function of an individual’s 
predisposing factors , enabling factors, and perceived need. Our 
team has successfully used this model in prior studies31,[ADDRESS_107331] at each of the HSUM levels.  Predisposing factors  associated with lower screening rates include less 
knowledge about BC and certain health/cultural beliefs (i.e., higher fatalism).33-[ADDRESS_107332] a curvilinear 
relationship between screening and anxiety; adherence improves with increasing anxiety until the anxiety 
becomes too intense, resulting in avoidance.36-[ADDRESS_107333]/better 
insurance coverage, and greater access to care significantly predict higher screening rates.34,39- 42 Finally, BC 
screening may be influenced by [CONTACT_97353], a social phenomenon that includes perceived susceptibility to 
BC, social norms (e.g., others’ expectations for screening and one’s willingness to adhere to these expectations), 
provider recommendation for screening, and attitudes towards screening; lower perceived need may deter 
utilization.43,[ADDRESS_107334] focused specifically on barriers/facilitators of breast MRI in 
high risk populations.  Screening breast MRI is unique for three reasons. First, it is a supplemental procedure, 
to be done in addition to annual mammograms. Women who are adherent to mammography screening still have low rates of screening breast MRI.
[ADDRESS_107335] utilization, including medical 
contraindications, fewer MRI facilities, and significantly greater costs.10,18,19 Furthermore, existing studies are 
limited; they are retrospective in nature and include homogeneous populations.  
 This project is based on rigorous prior research demonstrating (a) established risk factors f or BC,
22-25 
(b) a proven modality for screening this population (e.g., breast MRI),6 and (c) under -utilization of 
screening breast MRI in women at high BC risk.7,[ADDRESS_107336] a comprehensive quantitative and qualitative assessment of barriers to MRI 
utilization. In Aim 1, community -based high risk women (N= 300) will be surveyed regarding HSUM factors and 
breast MRI utilization. Results will identify patient -level HSUM factors significantly associated with screening 
outcomes . In Aim 2, a subset of Aim 1  patients (N=30), will complete semi- structured interviews to identify gaps 
in our theoretical conceptualization of breast MRI utilization. Successful completion of  this study will provide an 
explanatory framework for screening breast MRI utilization. This explanatory framework will inform our program 
of research, ultimately leading to the development and testing of a community -based, multilevel intervention 
incorpor ating individual (e.g., education, motivational interviewing), provider (e.g., education, 
reminders/notifications), and/or systems -level (e.g., patient navigation, screening voucher) components.  
 The proposed research is a considerable shift from dominant current research on BC early detection.  
(1) This study extends the existing literature by [CONTACT_97354], risk -based cancer 
screening approaches . Most of the extant work in this area has been quantitative. (2) Our novel sampling 
plan for Aim [ADDRESS_107337] information -rich cases that are both concordant and discordant with our conceptual 
model, enabling us to refine current theoretical models. (3) Previous studies of screening MRI utilization are retrospective and observational.
8-[ADDRESS_107338]. Vadaparampil (MCC) and [CONTACT_97373]  (LCCC)  have experience working in 
cancer prevention research, including high risk populations. Support will be provided by a team of  co-
investigators  with expertise in epi[INVESTIGATOR_97335] ([CONTACT_97374]) and biostatistics ([CONTACT_97375]).  
 C.[ADDRESS_107339] (CAB).  Our CAB will be comprised of patients (n=3), primary care providers 
(n=3), and systems- level representatives (n=3, representatives from the American Cancer Society -Southeast 
Region [see LOS]). The CAB will work with the research team to: (1) develop study materials; (2) interpret results; and (3) disseminate findings. To achieve these goals, the CAB will have biannual, in- person meetings. 
CAB members will be compensated for their contributions ($35/meeting, for a total of $140).  
 
C.3 Preliminary Studies.  As demonstrated by [CONTACT_97355] 3.a- 3.c, our team has the abi lity 
to identify, accrue (46- 54% consenting), and retain (69 -93% completing follow -ups) diverse samples of women 
with high BC risk.  
C.3.a Intentions for Risk Reducing Behaviors in Women with High BC Risk. [CONTACT_97373] led a study to 
assess intentions for BC  risk-reduction among high risk women.
46 Of 103 participants, only 25% reported 
intentions for future mastectomy, 11% for oophorectomy, and 23% for chemoprevention. Lifetime risk predicted intentions for oophorectomy only, such that BRCA1/[ADDRESS_107340] screening (mam mography, screening MRI) was not assessed as a potential outcome . 
 
C.3.b Screening Behaviors in High Risk BC Survivors Following Genetic Testing. [CONTACT_97376] 
recently completed an ACS funded grant to examine the impact of genetic counseling/testing on BC recurrence 
risk management behaviors among Black women with invasive BC diagnosed age ≤50 years prospectively recruited via the [LOCATION_012] Cancer Data System. One year after genetic testing, 50% had not received a 
physician recommendation for breast MRI and only 33% received breast MRI in the past 12 months.
45 Further, 
BRCA1/2  status was unrelated to MRI receipt (30% positive v. 33% negative/variant of uncertain significance; 
p=0.85).  
 
C.3.c Screening Behaviors in Unaffected High Risk Women Following Risk Notification. In 2017, our 
team conducted a pi[INVESTIGATOR_97336] -management behaviors among women presenting for routine 
mammography.47 Of 66 high risk women, 80% had not received a physician recommendation for breast MRI [ADDRESS_107341] -mammography; only 8% had received screening breast MRI. Of those who obtained a breast MRI 
(n=6), 4 (67%) indicated that they did so because of a physician recommendation.  
 5 C.3.d Summary.  Findings support the need for additional research to assess barriers/facilitators of screening 
breast MRI . 
 
C.4 Study Design and Methods. 
We apply a sequential mixed 
methods design (Table 1);[ADDRESS_107342], and the qualitative aim that 
follows is used to explain/extend 
the quantitative findings. The 
integration of qualitative and quantitative will occur at two time 
points: (1) Aim 1 quantitative data 
will be used to selectively sample 
participants and design interview guides for Aim 2; and (2) in final data interpretation.  
 C.4.a Aim 1 Overview. The survey employed in this aim will be based on the HSUM and iteratively revised 
based on CAB feedback. Measures will be selected and adapted for relevance to MRI screening; potential measures are listed below (Section C.4.a.4 ). The Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) Population Research, 
Interventions, and Measurement (PRISM) Core will assist with survey design and production. The PRISM Core 
has expertise in developi[INVESTIGATOR_97337] -to-understand, which subsequently 
enhances the quality of survey data.
[ADDRESS_107343] MRI . 
 C.4.a.1 Aim 1 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria.  Biological females; able to speak/read English; within [ADDRESS_107344] screening mammogram. Women will self -report BRCA1/2  status; women with a pathogenic BRCA1/2  
mutation are eligible. Non- carriers, women with a variant of uncertain significance, and women with unknown 
carrier status will then be screened for lifetime BC risk using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Breast Cancer 
Risk Assessment Tool  (BCRAT) .
26 For the proposed study, women with estimated lifetime risk ≥20% will be 
eligible. We will exclude women with a prior diagnosis of BC.  
 
The inclusion criterion of age will vary based on BRCA1/2  status. For women with  a pathogenic BRCA1/[ADDRESS_107345] MRI screening is recommended to be initiated at age 25 
for this population. For women without  a pathogenic BRCA1/[ADDRESS_107346] (CAB). The language in the advertisements will indicate that the study is open to women with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer. In addition, we will target women 
age 25-85. This method has been used successfully in the area of health- related research.
50-53 Potential 
participants who click on the Facebook advertisement will be redirected to a secure web site (Qualtrics)  with 
eligibility screening questions  based on the BCRAT. Women who screen eligible will be able to continue on to 
provide electronic informed consent and complete the web- based survey.  
 Second, we will approach potentially eligible patients in- person at mammography and primary care clinics in 
the catchment areas for MCC and LCCC. We have successfully recruited from clinics such as these in prior 
studies.
46,47 Working with clinical staff, we will screen clinic schedules for potentially eligible patients.  A 
research assistant will approach these patients prior to their scheduled appointment, provide information about 
the study, and answer women’s questions about the study. If interested, the research assistant will screen 
women for eligibility using the BCRAT. Eligible women will complete written informed consent, confirm their 
mailing address , and be given a survey packet (including a cover letter, paper survey, URL for the web- based 
survey, and postage paid return envelope) . Follow -up mailings will occur as described below (see section 
C.4.a.3 ).  
Table 1. Study Design.  
 [ADDRESS_107347], we will recruit participants via CAB members at community -based outreach events (e.g., health fairs).54-
[ADDRESS_107348] information to CAB members, who will give this 
information to study staff. P otential participants will be contact[CONTACT_28136], provided information about the 
study, and assessed for eligibility . Eligible women will confirm their mailing address and be mailed the survey  
as described below (see section C.4.a.3 ). Informed  consent will be documented on forms mailed and returned 
with the survey  or via electronic signature [CONTACT_97372] -based forms, as preferred.  
 
Fourth, we will partner with the group Facing Our Risk of Cancer Empowered (FORCE) to advertise the study 
on their e- mail list. FORCE is a non -profit organization with the mission of improving the lives of individuals and 
families affected by [CONTACT_97356], ovarian, and related cancers. The FORCE e- mail list is comprised of 
men and women with an interest in issues related to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. E -mail 
advertisements will describe the study and include contact [CONTACT_97357]. Potential participants will 
contact [CONTACT_97358] e- mail, be assessed for eligibility, confirm their mailing address or e -mail 
address, and be sent the survey as described below. Informed consent will be documented on forms mailed and returned with the survey  or via electronic signature [CONTACT_97372]- based forms, as preferred. 
 
Finally, we will advertise the study using flyers placed in mammography and primary care clinics  and 
distributed by [CONTACT_97359] (M -POWER) at community 
outreach events. Flyers will include a brief description of the study and contact [CONTACT_97360]. 
Potential participants will contact [CONTACT_97358] e- mail, be assessed for eligibility, confirm their 
mailing address or e- mail address, and be sent the survey as described below. Informed consent will be 
documented on forms mailed and returned with the survey  or via electronic signature [CONTACT_97372]- based forms, as 
preferred . 
 
We will monitor survey responses to ensure adequate representation (≥25%) of women reporting MRI receipt. 
If we are not on track for adequate accrual by [ADDRESS_107349] to deal with potential online scammers: (1) We will include several attention check items throughout the 
online survey. (2) Qualtrics can use cookies to prevent individuals from completing a survey more than once. A 
cookie is placed on the participants’ browser when they submit a response. The next time the respondent 
clicks on the survey link, Qualtrics will see this cookie and not permit them to take the survey.  (3) We will 
monitor the length of time that it takes participants to complete the survey; data from participants who complete 
the survey too quickly will be assumed to be invalid. (4) For online eligibility screening, ineligible participants will be excluded at the end of all screening items. This will prevent potential scammers from identifying how 
their responses disqualified them from study participation.  
 
Participants recruited via mammography and primary care clinics will be given the option of completing the 
survey online or on paper. If they prefer to complete the survey online, they will be given a handout with instructions for accessing the online survey. If they prefer to complete a paper survey, they will be given a copy  
at the ti me of approach and informed consent. They will be asked to complete the survey, put it in the postage 
paid return envelope, and mail the survey back  to MCC  or LCCC (depending on site of recruitment). Follow -up 
mailings will be based on Dillman’s Tailored Design Method (TDM). The TDM reduces errors related to survey 
coverage, sampling, measurement, and nonresponse.
57 Based on the TDM and our prior experience with 
survey studies,58,59 we will use t he following approach: (1) 1st thank you/reminder postcard; ( 2) replacement 
survey; ( 3) 2nd thank you/reminder postcard; and ( 4) a final survey with a letter stating a final date for survey 
submission. Materials will be mailed every 2 weeks.  
 Participants recruited via community -based outreach events, FORCE, or flyers will be given the option of 
completing the survey online or on paper. If they prefer to complete the survey online, they will be sent an e-
mail with instructions for accessing the online survey. If they prefer to complete a paper survey, w e will use the 
 7 TDM to distribute the survey. We will use the following approach: (1) mailed packet including a cover letter, two 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_1076], paper survey, URL for the web- based survey, and postage paid return 
envelope; (2) 1st thank you/reminder postcard; (3) replacement survey; (4) 2nd thank you/reminder postcard; 
and (5) a final survey with a letter stating a final date for survey submission. Materials will be mailed every 2 
weeks.  
 
Upon completion, all survey respondents will receive a $[ADDRESS_107350]. 
 
C.4.a.4 Aim 1 Measures.  Predisposing factors: Sociodemographics, medical contraindications for MRI, BC 
Awareness Scale,60 Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale61and Medical Outcomes Study 12-Item 
Short Form Health Survey ( SF-12)62. Enabling factors : Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey,[ADDRESS_107351]/insurance factors (employment, income, insurance), site of care, access t o on-site MRI, and travel time to 
site of care. Perceived need: Perceived susceptibility,64 perceived norms,65 provider recommendation for 
screening, and attitudes towards screening.46 Health Behaviors: Patient -reported receipt of BC screening 
(mammogram, ultrasound, and MRI) and other BC risk management behaviors (chemoprevention, genetic counseling/testing) in the last 12 months.  
 C.4.a.5 Aim 1 Analytic Approach.  
 
Data Management and Analysis: We will calculate descriptive statistics for predisposing factors, enabling 
factors, perceived need and health behaviors. We will use multivariable logistic regression to estimate odds 
ratios (ORs) for the relationships of the HSUM predictors with health 
behaviors. In the event that data is missing, we will use multiple imputation (with data assumed to be missing at random) to assess the 
robustness of results based on participants with complete data.  We will 
account for site of recruitment (e.g., MCC or LCCC) in all analyses.  
 
Sample Size:  With N= 300, we will have >80% power for multivariable 
logistic regression examining ORs at α=0.05 (two- tailed). We can detect 
OR=1.8 when the predictor (X) is continuous and normally distributed, 
the probability of screening at the mean of X is 0.2, and the coefficient 
of determination between X and a continuous covariate (Z) is 0.05. 
When X and  Z are binary with 50% and 25% prevalence, respectively, 
we will have 75% power to detect OR=2.5, when the probability of 
screening is 0.25 when X=0 and 
Z=0. 
 
Expected Outcomes : We expect to 
identify [ADDRESS_107352] semi -structured qualitative interviews with a sub- sample of Aim 1 
participants (N=30). We will select information -rich cases from Aim 1 for in- depth qualitative analysis in Aim 2 
(Figure 3). To do so, we will categorize Aim 1 participants based on expected and actual MRI receipt (see 
C.4.b.1). From participants in each group, we will gather in- depth information about their breast MRI screening 
decisions. The goals of Aim 2 are to (a) obtain an in- depth understanding of barriers/facilitators to MRI from the 
patient perspective, and (b) identify gaps in our theoretical conceptualization of breast MRI utilization.  
 
Table 2. Operational Definitions of HSUM Factors.  
Figure 2. Sample Composition.  
 [ADDRESS_107353] -hoc modification of the 
conceptual model. For each HSUM category (predisposing factors, enabling factors, perceived need), Aim 1 
participants will be categorized as “high” or “low” based on a priori operational definitions (Table 2). If a woman 
is “high” in ≥2 HSUM categories, she will be categorized as “yes” for expe cted MRI receipt (and vice versa for 
“no”). From expected and self -reported MRI receipt, we will create 4 utilization categories (Table 3). 
 C.4.b.[ADDRESS_107354] informative for refining our theoretical model, we will over -sample women in these groups 
(n=10 per group) compared to the concordant groups (n=5 per group). If there are insufficient numbers in any 
group to allow for examination in Aim 2, we will continue Aim [ADDRESS_107355] via phone. All interviews  will be conducted by a research 
assistant (RA) with prior experience conducting qualitative interviews. The  site PIs ([CONTACT_97373]  and [CONTACT_97377]) will review 10% of interview recordings at random to ensure high quality/fidelity in the data 
collection . The interviews will be guided by [CONTACT_97361] (Table 4).  We will start with a broad overview of patients’ 
experiences with screening breast MRI, followed by [CONTACT_97362]. Patients will also be queried regarding Aim 1 survey responses. Upon completion, interview participants will 
receive a $[ADDRESS_107356]. Our team has extensive experience in conducting qualitative interviews
68,69 and will be 
supported by [CONTACT_97363]’s PRISM Core.  
 Upon completion of both study aims, all participants will be sent (via mail or email) educational materials about 
breast MRI and screening recommendations, as well as a list of American College of Radiology (ACR) 
accredited breast MRI screening facilities in the greater Tampa Bay region or the Washington DC metro area, 
as appropriate. 
 C.4.b.4  Aim 2 Analytic Approach.  
 
Data Management and Analysis : 
Interviews will be transcribed verbatim. The research team will analyze the transcript themes 
through open coding, axial coding, 
and selective coding.
70 The PI [INVESTIGATOR_97338], 
drawing on the conceptual model, 
to produce a codebook. We will 
present themes and codebook to our interdisciplinary team and the CAB, then iteratively revise our approach 
to enhance validity.
71 Once consensus is reached, this codebook will be uploaded into MAXQDA (a qualitative 
data analysis software program) and be systematically applied to the data. To ensure coding scheme reliability, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_97339] 10% of transcripts independently, and Krippendorff’s alpha will be calculated with the goal of achieving α≥0.70 (an acceptable level of agreement).
72 Following achievement of α≥0.70, the 
remainder of the data will be split between the two coders for analysis.  
 
Sample Size. We will follow the principle of theoretical saturation and 
continue interviews until no new information is obtained.73 Based on our 
prior research68,69 we anticipate 5- 10 interviews will be required to reach 
saturation. Thus, we aim to interview 10 participants per discordant group and 5 participants per concordant group, for 30 interviews total.

 9 Expected Outcomes : Upon completion of Aim 2, we expect to identify additional bar riers/facilitators of MRI 
uptake that are not specified in the HSUM. This will allow us to refine the conceptual model in Aim 1.  
 
C.4.c Integration of Findings.  Qualitative and quantitative findings will be integrated during the post -hoc 
modification of the conceptual model. We will use the merging approach, which combines qualitative and quantitative data to compare and analyze.
74,75 Data display tables will be constructed so that corresponding 
qualitative and quantitative data can be juxtaposed, discussed, compared, and interpreted.76 This will allow the 
team to use the qualitative and quantitative findings to inform modifications of the conceptual model.  
 
D. Human Subjects.  
 
D.1 Risks to Human Subjects  
 D.1.a  Human Subjects Involvement, Characteristics, and Design  
 Aim 1 involves a one -time survey of women at high risk (n= 300) for breast cancer (BC). The survey will assess 
predisposing characteristics, enabling resources, perceived need  for, and receipt of MRI in the past [ADDRESS_107357] MRI referral and uptake will be the primary outcome measures investigated in Aim 1. The survey will be 
completed on paper or via internet (as preferre d). We will also utilize minimal intensity, low resource effective 
strategies including thank you/reminder post cards. Materials will be mailed every 2 weeks. Surveys are estimated to take 30 -45 minutes. Upon completion, survey respondents will receive a $[ADDRESS_107358] be: (a) biological females; (b) able to speak/read English or Spanish; (c) within [ADDRESS_107359] screening mammogram; and ( d) able to give informed consent. Women will self -report 
BRCA1/2  carrier status; women with a pathogenic mutation in these genes are eligible. Non- carriers will then 
be screened for lifetime BC risk using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool 
(BCRAT; https://bcrisktool.cancer.gov/calculator.html
), an interactive web- based tool based on the Gail 
model26; women with estim ated lifetime risk ≥20% are also eligible. We will exclude women with a personal 
history of BC.  
 
The inclusion criterion of age will vary based on BRCA1/2  status. For women with  a pathogenic BRCA1/[ADDRESS_107360] MRI screening is recommended to be initiated at age 25 
for this population. For women without  a pathogenic BRCA1/2  mutation, women ages 35- 85 will be eligible.  
 Aim 2 involves qualitative interviews with a sub- sample of participants from Aim 1 (N=30). The interviews will 
be completed via telephone. Guided by [CONTACT_97364]’s Health Services Utilization Model, interviews will assess multilevel factors promoting or limiting breast MRI utilization. Each interview is expected to last 45 -60 minutes 
and will be audio- recorded. Upon completion, interview participants will receive a $[ADDRESS_107361] (IRB)  and the 
MedStar/Georgetown University Joint Oncology IRB . All recommendations made by [CONTACT_97365] s will be 
honored.  
 
For Aim 1, we will use Dillman’s Tailored Design Method (TDM) to distribute the survey to the full sample 
(N=300). The TDM reduces errors related to survey coverage, sampling, measurement, and nonresponse. 
Based on the TDM and our prior experience with survey studies, we will use the following approach: (1) mailed packet, addressed to the patient, including a cover letter, two copi[INVESTIGATOR_1076], paper 
survey, URL for the web- based survey, and postage paid return envelope; (2) 1
st thank you/reminder postcard; 
(3) replacement survey; (4) 2nd thank you/reminder postcard; and (5) a final survey with a letter stating a final 
 10 date for survey submission. Materials will be mailed every 2 weeks. Upon completion, survey respondents will 
receive a $[ADDRESS_107362] achieved our desired sample size (N=30). Participants will be contact[CONTACT_97366]. Upon confirmation of interest, participants will be sent two copi[INVESTIGATOR_97340], one of which will be signed and returned  to MCC or LCCC (depending on site of 
recruitment) . Consenting participants will be scheduled for an individual interview via telephone. 
 
Sources of research mat erial (to be used for research purposes only) include the following:  
 
a) Self-report inventories assessing: sociodemographic, clinical, and cultural characteristics; BC 
awareness, psychological well -being, perceived social support, perceived BC susceptibility, perceived 
norms, provider recommendation for BC screening, attitudes towards BC screening, receipt of BC screening in the last [ADDRESS_107363] 12 months.  
 
b) Audio- tapes and transcripts of interviews.  
 
There are no physical risks to the participant posed by [CONTACT_15365], and no adverse events are anticipated. 
Participation in this project will require the investment of time in responding to interviews and survey questionnaires. This is a minimal risk study. We are using standard interview and survey techniques. Study 
participants will not encounter risk greater than those ordinarily encountered in daily life, including clinical encounters in the primary care and BC screening settings. These minimal risks are described in detail below.  
 
a) Confidentiality and loss of privacy. Subjects may provide personal information about themselves during 
the in- depth interviews, as well as on screening or demographic questionnaires. Disclosure of personal 
or health -related information may affect a participant’s employability or reputation.  
 
b) Psychological distress and cancer risk data, which is sensitive and personal information, will be 
collected in this study. Participants may feel embarrassed or uncomfortable with disclosing such 
information.  
 
D.[ADDRESS_107364] Risks  
 D.2.a Informed Consent  
 These studies do not involve any deception. Informed consent and consenting procedures will adhere to the 
Advarra IRB and the MedStar/Georgetown University Joint Oncology IRB  guidelines. All subjects will sign 
consent forms prior to their participation. They will be asked to review the consent form prior to signing and will 
be provided the opportunity to ask any questions. Participant consent is ongoing, and all will be informed that 
they do not have to participate. If a person is not eligible or if she decides that she is no longer interested, the 
informed consent (or the remainder of the assessment) will end. Consent in minors is not applicable, as 
participants less than 25 years old are not eligible for the present study.  
 In Aim 1, participants will be self -identified. We will use five  different recruitment strategies to enroll 300 
participants, as described in Section 2.5 (“Recruitment and Retention Plan”). Once identified, potential 
participants will be assessed for eligibility using the NCI BCRAT; this method has been successfully used to 
identify high risk women in our prior studies and by [CONTACT_21123], [CONTACT_97378], in her large, population- based 
studies of women at high r isk for BC.
46,47 Eligible women will provide informed consent via  forms mailed and 
returned with the survey materials or via electronic signature [CONTACT_97372]- based forms, as preferred.  
 
In Aim 2, participants  will be selectively sampled from Aim 1. Women will be randomly sampled and invited to 
participate in Aim 2 interviews until we achieve n=[ADDRESS_107365], participants 
will be sent two copi[INVESTIGATOR_97341], one of which will be signed and returned to MCC or LCCC 
(depending on site of recruitment) . Thus, informed consent will be documented by [CONTACT_97367]/Georgetown University Joint Oncology IRB . 
 Key elements of the informed consent procedure that are explained to participants  for both study aims include: 
(1) the research status of the study; (2) the confidentiality of the participant’s responses; (3) the voluntary nature of the study; and (4) the freedom to withdraw from the study or refuse to answer specific questions at 
any time. All participants who consent will be provided with a copy of the informed consent form and may 
contact [CONTACT_97368]/concerns.  
 D.2.b Protections Against Risk  
 Planned strategies for minimizing potential risks are described in detail below.  
 
a) Risk: Confidentiality and loss of privacy.  
 
Minimization: The risk of inappropriate disclosure of the participant’s identity or sensitive data is 
appropriately minimized. We will make every effort to inform participants about  the steps we are taking 
to ensure the confidentiality and privacy of their responses. In order to protect confidentiality, data will be securely stored and protected as described below.  
 
For Aim 1, participants will have the option of completing the inventories via a secure website 
(Qualtrics.com) using a unique login ID or password hosted by [CONTACT_97369]. Qualtrics, an 
online data collection website, has SAS 70 Certification and meets rigorous privacy standards. All 
Qualtrics accounts are hidden behind passwords and all data is protected with real -time data replication 
(see https://www.qualtrics.com/security -statement
/ for additional information).  
 For Aim 2, participants will be audio recorded. Once the interviews are recorded, they will be 
transcribed verbatim by a study team member. Each transcript will be reviewed for accuracy by a 
second, independent study team member, after which the audio recordings will be destroyed. Audio 
recordings of interviews will not be used for educational or training purposes.  
 
Data collected at MCC will be maintained at MCC, and data collected at LCCC will be maintained at 
LCCC. Data sharing will take place as described in section D.[ADDRESS_107366] number (001, 002, etc.) that is unique to the study in question, and all data will be stored under 
that subject number. Participants are only identified by [CONTACT_97370]/publications. One master list of subject names and corresponding subject numbers will be 
kept electronically. Only the study coordinator and key research personnel will have access to this list. 
The list will be password protected and stored on a password protected server that is firewall protected. 
All research data will remain separate from the master list and identifiers. De- identified data will be kept 
on file for at least 5 years from the time the IRB accepts the final review and closes the study. At the 
end of the 5
th year of study closure, the de -identified data will be deleted.  
 
b) Risk:  Psychological distress, embarrassment, or discomfort.  
 Minimization:  In conducting self -report assessments and interviews, we make every effort to obtain 
data in a humane, effective, and professional manner. The questions to be employed are standardized and have been used extensively and successfully in prior research. Participants will be informed that 
they can omit answers to any questions that make them feel uncomfortable without consequence. 
Participants will be told that they may discontinue a single assessment or participation in the study at any time. Contact [CONTACT_97371] s (PIs) is provided should participants 
 [ADDRESS_107367] experience 
managing participant discomfort in the rare situations it arises. 
 
Finally, we note that all members of the research team and personnel involved in recruitment will 
complete and maintain the necessary Human Subjects and HIPAA Training (e.g. CITI Courses), and copi[INVESTIGATOR_97342].

Member, Cancer Prevention and Control Program  
 Only de -identified data will be shared via secure file sharing service (ShareFile). Elements of dates will be shared; 
however, outside collaborators will not have access to our EMR system that would allow for direct identification of 
patients/participants. A data sharing agreement between Moffitt Cancer Center and Georgetown University 
Lombardi Cancer Center will be established through Moffitt’s legal office.  
 D.[ADDRESS_107369] in a program of research specifically focusing on  developi[INVESTIGATOR_97343], risk -based cancer screening. Data will be used to inform the next critical steps: (1) examine 
provider - and systems -level factors impacting utilization of breast MRI; (2) development and pi[INVESTIGATOR_97344] a 
community -based, multilevel intervention aimed at increasing breast MRI among high risk women; and (3) a 
fully powered RCT testing this intervention against practice as usual.

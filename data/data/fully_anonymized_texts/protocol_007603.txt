 SYNOPSIS 
Title of Study:  A Phase I /II Study of the Combination of Panobinostat and Carfil zomib in Patients with 
Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma  
Protocol Number:  MM 27  Study Phase:  I -II 
Study Centers:  Multicentered  
Objectives:  Primary Objectives:  
 To establish the optimal dose s of carfilzomib in and panobinostat that can be 
administered  to patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. (Phase  I)  
 To evaluate the overall response in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple 
myeloma treated with the combination of panobinostat and carfilzomib.  (Phase II)  
Secondary Objectives:  
 To eva luate time -to-progression (TTP)  
 To evaluate progression -free-survival (PFS)  
 To evaluate overall -survival (OS)  
 To evaluate safety  
Study Design:  This is an open -label, non -randomized Phase I/II study of patients with relapsed or 
refractory multiple myeloma . 
The Phase I study will determine the MTD of the combination of carfilzomib and 
panobinostat.  The Phase I portion will follow a standard dose escalation design, 
beginning with dose level 1 (see Table 2).  Patients will be assessed for dose -limiting 
toxicity (DLT) at each visit during Cycle 1 prior to receiving treatment.  Dose 
modifications will not be permitted during Cycle 1 unless a patient experiences a DLT 
(see Section 5.2.2.). Treatment cycles will be administered at 28 -day intervals.  
Panobinostat will be administered orally three times weekly during weeks 1 and 3 of 
each cycle (Days 1, 3, 5, 15, 17, 19).  Carfilzomib will be administered intravenously on 
Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 of each cycle.  During Cycle 1, the carfilzomib dose will be 
escala ted after the Day 2 dose, if well tolerated.  
A maximum of four dose levels will be evaluated.  Approximately 24 patients will be 
enrolled during the Phase I portion to establish the MTD.  
In the Phase II portion of this study, patients with relapsed/refract ory multiple myeloma 
will receive treatment with the panobinostat and carfilzomib combination established 
during Phase I.  Patients will be reevaluated for response to treatment after each  cycle 
(4 week).  Patients with objective response or stable disease  will continue treatment, 
with subsequent reevaluations every 4 weeks, until disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity occurs.  
Number of Patients:  Up to 80 eligible patients will be treated in this study.

Statistical 
Method:  MM 27 is a Phase I/II st udy of carfilzomib in combination with panobinostat in the treatment 
of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.  The total number of patients expected to be 
accrued is 80. 
The Phase I objective is to establish the optimal dose of carfilzomib with panobinosta t that 
can be administered to patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.  In this part of 
the trial, the optimal dose combination to be administered will be determined as described in 
Section 5.2.  Since 3 -6 patients will be treated in each cohort,  the maximum number of 
patients treated in this phase will be 24.

SYNOPSIS 
Statistical 
Method:  The Phase II efficacy objective is to evaluate the overall response in patients with 
relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma treated at the optimal dose level i n the first 4 
dose levels established during the Phase I portion . In addition,  the overall response in 
patients at any additional dose level s will be evaluated .  The response rates in the two 
dose levels will be evaluated separately.  When used in the trea tment of patients with 
relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, the historical carfilzomib overall response rate is 
approximately 18%.  It is hypothesized that the overall response rate for the treatment 
regimen of carfilzomib plus panobinostat is greater tha n that for patients treated with 
carfilzomib alone.  A sample size of 27 achieves 80% power to detect an increase in 
the overall response rate to 36% (representing a 100% relative improvement) based on 
a one -sided test of proportion at an alpha level of 0. 10.  The sample size will be 
increased by 10% to account for potential non -evaluable patients and adjusted relative 
to the actual number of patients in the Phase I portion who are treated at the optimal 
dose level.

1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Background  
Multiple myeloma accounts for approximately 20,000 new cancer diagnoses in the US 
each year (Jemal et al. 2010).  Although myeloma patients usually benefit from initial 
therapy, sooner or later, treatment will be required for refractory or resistant disease.  
1.2. Panobinostat 
Panobinostat (LBH589) is a potent histone deac etylase ( HDAC ) inhibitor belonging to a 
structurally novel cinnamic hydroxamic acid class of compounds.  It is a potent class I/II 
pan-DAC inhibitor that has shown anti -tumor activity in pre -clinical models and cancer 
patients.  Deacetylases (DAC) target l ysine groups on chromatin and transcription 
factors and various non -histone proteins such as p53, tubulin, HSP90 and Rb.  
Panobinostat is formulated as an oral capsule and a solution for intravenous ( IV) 
injection.  Both the oral and IV formulations are cu rrently being investigated in ongoing 
phase I and phase II studies in advanced solid tumors and hematological malignancies.   
1.2.1. Overview of the Clinical Experience  
In clinical studies, both oral and intravenous ( IV) formulations of panobinostat are being 
explored for further development.  As of December 31, 2010, 32 clinical studies, 
inclu
ding clinical pharmacology, phase I and/or phase II, have either been completed or 
are ongoing.  A total of 1,[ADDRESS_548211] included fatigue and vomiting.   
With the exception of thrombocytopenia, grades 3 and 4 adverse events were 
u
ncommon.  The occurrence of thrombocytopenia appears to be related to the 
underlying disease (incidence is higher in patients with malignancies that involved the 
bone marrow e.g., acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, multiple 
myeloma, myelodysplastic syndrome, etc.) as well as the mode and interval of 
administration, with oral every other week schedules producing the least amount of 
toxicity. 
The most common electrocardiogram ( ECG ) findings adjud icated  by [CONTACT_432665] -baseline increase in frequency of sinus tachycardia, T -wave changes (flat, 
biphasic, inverted), as well as depressed ST segment findings.  
The most frequently encountered laboratory abnormalities were thrombocytopenia, 
neutropenia, some degree of anemia, and fluctuations in electrolytes that might not be 
clinically relevant. 
 
  
Page 26 of 101 
MM 27 AMD 5/03 AU G 2015 
 Thyroid function, as monitored by [CONTACT_432666] T4, did not reveal 
overt hyper- or hypothyroidism, with fluctuations in TSH values being within normal 
limits. 
1.2.2. Single Dose Panobinostat Administration and ECG Monitoring 
In the initial Phase I study utilizing the IV formulation of panobinostat administered on 
consecutive days, significant QTcF interval abnormalities were noted, with one patient 
experiencing Torsade de pointes.  With the introduction of the oral formulation and the 
three-times-weekly (TIW) administration, extensive monitoring has been conducted in 
all clinical trials of panobinostat. 
As of December 31, 2009 cardiac safety data were available for 532 patients receiving 
TIW dosing and 70 patients TIW every other week (QOW ).  All of these patients 
u
nderwent intensive pre- and post-dose ECG recording to monitor the occurrence of 
QTcF changes as well as to capture other ECG abnormalities.  There is increasing 
evidence that the most common finding is a QTcF increase of ≤60 msec (CTCAE grade 
1) from baseline in both schedules.  QTcF prolongation to >[ADDRESS_548212] oral dose of 60 mg given TIW.  There were no cases of Torsade 
de pointes with either schedule for oral panobinostat.  
To date, an increase from of ≤60 msec (CTCAE grade 1) was observed in 98 patients 
(16.7%) in TIW schedule.  An increase of >60 msec from baseline in 12 patients (2%) is 
less frequently reported.  QTcF prolongation translating in an absolute value above 
baseline to ≤480 msec or to ≤500 msec occurred in 61 patients (10.4%) and in 5 
patients (0.8%), respectively.  Absolute QTcF prolongation above 500 msec was 
reported in 3 patients (0.5%) treated at doses of 20 and 60 mg (2 and 1 patients, 
respectively). 
To date, an increase from baseline of ≤60 msec (CTCAE grade 1) was observed in 15 
patients out of 70 patients (21.4%) in the TIW QOW schedule.  An increase of >60 msec 
from baseline in 4 patients (5.7%) was less frequently reported.  QTcF prolongation 
translating in an absolute value above baseline to ≤480 msec or to ≤500 msec occurred 
in 9 out of 70 patients (12.9%) and in 1 out of 70 patients (1.4%), respectively.  Absolute 
QTcF prolongation above [ADDRESS_548213] 
a
bnormalities (flat, inverted, or biphasic T-waves) and depressed ST segment.  An 
increased frequency of sinus tachycardia was also observed. 
In addition, an assessment of grade 3 or 4 cardiovascular events of clinical relevance 
(angina pectoris, cardiac failure, cardiac arrest, CHF, pericardial effusion, DVT, and 
pulmonary embolism) was conducted for both dose schedules.  The events are 
described by [CONTACT_214961]. 
In Group 1 (N= 229) treated with 20 mg TIW, angina pectoris was reported in 4 cases 
(1.7%), cardiac failure, CHF and DVT in 2 cases (0.9%) each, cardiac arrest and 
pericardial effusion in 1 case (0.4%) each.  At 40 mg, T IW pericardial effusion and 
pulmonary embolism were reported in 2 cases (1.3%) each (N=153).  None of these 
 
  
Page 27 of 101 
MM 27 AMD 5/03 AU G 2015 
 events were noted in the few patients (N=5) treated at the dose of 60 mg TIW.  For 
group 2 at the dose of 20 mg TIW (N=64), DVT and pulmonary embolism, cardiac 
failure and pericardial effusion were noted in 1 instance (1.6%) each.  A second event of 
cardiac failure was reported at the dose of 30 mg TIW in 8 treated patients (12.5%). 
For group 1 at 50 mg TIW QOW (N=15), cardiac failure and CHF were reported in 1 
case (6.7 %) each.  For group 2 at 45 mg TIW QOW (N-9), MI was reported in 1 case 
(11.1%).  
Given the nature of the disease under treatment, patients with such events have many 
risks factors such as underlying cardiovascular disease and concomitant medications.  
As such, it is yet to be determined whether panobinostat is causally related to these 
cardiovascular adverse events.

.2.3. Phase Ib Study in Patients with MM 
The primary objective of the CLBH589B2207 trial is to determine the maximum-
tolerated dose (MTD) of oral panobinostat when combined with bortezomib in patients 
with relapsed or refractory MM.  A total of [ADDRESS_548214] been enrolled into five 
completed dose cohorts: (I) 10 mg panobinostat (TIW) + 1.0 mg/m2 bortezomib (IV, 
Days 1, 4, 8, 11) q 21-days, (II) 20 mg panobinostat + 1.0 mg/m2 bortezomib, (III) 20 mg 
panobinostat + 1.3 mg/m2 bortezomib and (IV) 30 mg panobinostat + 1.3 mg/m2 
bortezomib, (V) 25 mg panobinostat +1.3 mg/m2 bortezomib .  Enrollment into Cohort VI 
at 20 mg panobinostat + 1.3 mg/m2 bortezomib has enrolled [ADDRESS_548215]-
03 cutoff.  In Cohorts I-V, the median number of prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_432635] (range 1-7); 
[ADDRESS_548216]. Out of 22 bortezomib pre-treated patients 
13 were refractory to prior bortezomib therapy (10 PD and 3 SD on bortezomib 
according to IMWG’08). Median time on study was longest in Cohort 3 at 109 days 
(range 7- 424) (Anderson et al. 2010).  
The combination of panobinostat and bortezomib was safe and tolerated in Cohorts I, II, 
III and IV.  Dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) were reported in cohorts II (one patient with 
Grade 4 afebrile neutropenia) and cohort IV (4 DLTs: 2 Grade 4 TCPs, requiring 
2 consecutive platelet transfusions), Grade 3 pneumonia and Grade 3 fatigue.  In cohort 
V, the dose of panobinostat was de-escalated to 25 mg. In this Cohort, one DLT has 
been seen to date (Gr ade 4 thrombocytopenia, Grade 3 asthenia, Gr ade 3 dizziness).  
Hematological AEs have been common, including Grade 3/4 TCP (30 in 38 patients) , 
neutropenia (23) and anemia (6).  Non-hematological AEs (all grades) included diarrhea 
(23), fever (17), nausea (18), fatigue (16), and asthenia (13). A total of 2,[ADDRESS_548217] been analyzed: no QTcF prolongations from BL >60 msec nor absolute QTcF time 
duration >480 msec were noted. No QTcF prolongation ≥Grade 1 were seen.  
Although Grade 3/4 TCP occurred frequently it was manageable with dose 
reduction/interruption and platelet transfusion. TCP (Grade 4) was to be managed by 
[CONTACT_432667]/reduction was allowed. 
Thrombocytopenia as the DLT in three patients in cohorts IV and V. No patients 
experienced hemorrhagic events in association with Gr ade 3/4 TCP. A detailed review 
 
  
Page 28 of 101 
MM 27 AMD 5/03 AU G 2015 
 of dose reductions and interruptions as well as timing of dose modifications and platelet 
transfusions relative to time to and duration of TCP in patients enrolled in cohorts I - IV 
revealed the following findings:  
The majority of patients experienced TCP within the first 2 cycles. This resulted in dose 
reductions, interruptions and/or dose delays. The time course of TCP appeared 
predictable with the platelet count nadir in most cases occurring at the end of the 
second week, or during the 3rd, i.e. last week of the first or second treatment cycle. No 
dose relationship was seen with a similar number of Grade 3/[ADDRESS_548218] cohorts. A similar number of patients receiving platelet transfusions (n=1/7, 
5/7, and 3/8 in cohorts I, II, and III), and administrations of platelet transfusion (n=15 in 
cohorts I-V). With 109 days (compared to 52 and 76 days in cohorts I and II) median 
panobinostat exposure time was longest in cohort III in spi[INVESTIGATOR_432636]/interruptions. Anecdotal cases have been reported in which patients were 
clinically benefiting from panobinostat, but were unable to maintain the QW dosing 
sch
edule even after dose reduction.  
Clinical efficacy was observed in all 5 cohorts with 26 responses (MR or better) in [ADDRESS_548219] PR (58%) including 
2 VGPR, and immunofixation (IF) - negative CR in 4 pts. Responses were seen in the 
subset of patients refractory to prior bortezomib suggesting a strong clinical correlate of 
the preclinical synergism of the combination of panobinostat and bortezomib: 8 of 13 
bortezomib-refractory patients responded, including 6 with a PR (46%) and 2 with a MR 
(Figure 1).   One patient had received bortezomib as part of an induction regimen prior 
to autologous SCT, and experienced a VGPR (cohort I).  
According to the protocol Dex could be introduced in cycle 2 (or 3) and this was done in 
9 patients including 8 out of 18 responders (2 in cohort I, 2 in cohort II, 1 in cohort III 
and 3 in cohort IV). Five patients received Dex after first documentation of response and 
3 patients before. Eleven of 18 patients with a response did not receive Dex at all, 
including several patients refractory to bortezomib. In cohort III all 8 patients 
experienced a clinical benefit with 7 responding [immunofixation-negative CR (n=2), PR 
(n=3) including one bortezomib refractory patient, MR (n=2) including one bortezomib 
refractory patient] and one with SD. Dose modifications did not affect efficacy since the 
highest number of responders seen to date was in cohorts III, IV and V where a higher 
dose of bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 biweekly) were used.

1.3. Carfilzomib 
Carfilzomib (PR-171) is a tetrapeptide ketoepoxide-based inhibitor specific for the 
chymotrypsin-like active site of the 20S proteasome.  Carfilzomib is structurally and 
mechanistically distinct from the dipeptide boronic acid proteasome inhibitor bortezomib 
(Velcade®).  In addition, when measured against a broad panel of proteases including 
metallo, aspartyl, and serine proteases, carfilzomib demonstrated less reactivity against 
non-proteasomal proteases when compared to bortezomib (Demo et al. 2007 and 
Arastu-Kapur et al. 2008). 
1.3.1. Carfilzomib Phase 2 Single Agent Experience 
Two Phase 2 clinical studies are ongoing with carfilzomib in multiple myeloma ( MM) 
patients, PX-171- 003-A0 (N=46) in relapsed and refractory MM and PX- 171-004 (N=3 9) 
in relapsed MM.  In both studies, patients were treated with 20 mg/m2 on Days 1, 2, 8, 
9, 15, and 16 every 28 days.  In these studies there were four cases of suspected or 
do
cumented tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) prior to institution of the prophylaxis 
guidelines.  Since these guidelines were implemented, no further cases of TLS have 
been reported.  In both studies, the most common adverse events were fatigue, anemia, 
thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal, and dyspnea.  There were reported cases of 
increased in serum creatinine that were primarily < Grade 2 .  A very low rate of 
treatment-emergent peripheral neuropathy ( 2.2% Grade 3/4), was observed in PX- 171-
003-A0 despi[INVESTIGATOR_75154] 78% of patients had Grade 1/2 neuropathy upon study 
entry (Jagannath et al. 2009).   
P
atients in the PX-171-003-A0 study had progressive myeloma   and were refractory to 
their most recent therapy, often including bortezomib and/or an immunomodulatory drug 
 
  
Page 30 of 101 
MM 27 AMD 5/03 AU G 2015 
 (usually lenalidomide).   In this study, 18% of patients had partial responses, with 7% 
minor responses and 41% stable disease.   The median time to progression on the PX-
171-003-A0 study was 5.1 months with duration of response of 7.4 months (Jagannath 
et al. 2009) .   
A
 “stepped up” dosing schedule, referred to as 20/27 mg/m2, has subsequently been 
incorporated into the PX- 171-003 study in order to maximize the clinical benefit of 
carfilzomib.  Patients receive 20 mg/m2 for the first cycle and 27 mg/m2 thereafter.  The 
study completed enrollment of 266 patients by [CONTACT_5638] 2009 and may form the basis 
for an accelerated approval NDA filing by [CONTACT_5638] 2010.  To date, this dosing 
schedule has been well tolerated (Alsina et al. 2007).  An independent Safety Oversight 
Group (SOG) evaluated the safety data from the 40 of 250 patients to be enrolled on the 
20/27 schedule and agreed that the trial should proceed without modification.  No cases 
of TLS were observed and rates of BUN and creatinine elevation dropped sharply, with 
Grade 3/4 renal impairment droppi[INVESTIGATOR_86286] 2.2%, most likely due to hydration and very low 
dose dexamethasone.  Treatment-emergent peripheral neuropathy remains low on this 
portion of the study with 15% Grade 1/2 and one (0.7%) Grade 3/ 4 event reported to 
date on PX- 171-003- A18.  In addition, anemia rates in the PX- 171-003-A1 (higher dose) 
were lower than those reported in the PX- 171-003–A0 portion of the study, possibly 
indicating that the higher dose of carfilzomib is achieving better clearing of neoplastic 
cells in the bone marrow allowing superior normal marrow reconstitution.   Rates of 
th
rombocytopenia and neutropenia were similar in the two cohorts, with Grade 3 
neutropenia in ~5% without any Grade 4 neutropenia to date (Jagannath et al. 2009) 
In the PX-171-[ADDRESS_548220] cohort of patients received 20 mg/m2.  The subset of 
p
atients (N=54) that had not previously received bortezomib had an overall response 
rate (ORR) of 46% (2% CR, 9% VGPR and 35% PR), while the bortezomib treated 
patients (N=33) had an ORR of 18% (3% CR, 3% VGPR and 12% PR) (Wang et al. 
2009 and Seigel et al. 2009).  The median time to progression ( TTP) was 7.6 and 5.3 
months in these two groups, respectively.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Carfilzomib PX-171-007 Trial  
The PX- 171-003-A1 study enrolled 269 patients with relapsed and refractory multiple 
myeloma by [CONTACT_5638] 2009.  The Phase I single agent carfilzomib dose escalation 
study was ongoing as of July, 2009 with over 65 solid tumor patients starting treatment 
in the initial Phase II at the 36 mg/m2 dose.  A review of the tolerability of 36 mg/m2 
carfilzomib in the se patients  indicates that this regimen was very well tolerated with 
only one DLT (fatigue) and an overall adverse event profile similar to that seen with the 
27mg/m2 carfilzomib experience with bolus dosing (see IB for details). Three patients 
completed > 12 cycles of therapy at 36 mg/m2 with no evidence of cumulative toxicity.  
There were no significant DLTs observed; the majority of discontinuations on the study 
were due to progressive disease. Because of the long -term tolerability carfilzomib, the 
Phas e 1b portion of this study was reopened, and a separate arm for multiple myeloma 
was added.  
 
  
Page 31 of 101 
MM 27 AMD 5/[ADDRESS_548221] been treated with carfilzomib given as a 
30-minute infusion in order to minimize C max-related infusion events. The PX-171-007 
trial was amended and does of 20/36 (20 mg/m2 given on Days 1 and 2 of cycle 1 only; 
followed by 36 mg/m2 for all subsequent doses), 20/45, 20/56 mg/m2 and so forth are 
being investigated.  Doses of 20/56 mg/m2 are currently being given in two separate 
cohorts of patients with advanced MM and advanced solid tumors; the lower doses 
were well tolerated.  Preliminary tolerability information at this dose level (20/56 mg/m2) 
indicated that it is reasonably well tolerated, with minimal infusion reactions.  In some 
cases at 20/56mg/m2, dexamethasone was increased from 4mg/dose to 8mg with the 
56mg/m2 doses in order to reduce fevers and hypotension.  As of March 20, 2010, 
seven patients have received 20/56mg/m2 with tolerability.  Patients with advanced, 
refractory MM being treated at 36mg/m2 and 45mg/m2  have shown very good 
tolerability (>6 months in some cases) with documented minimal and partial responses 
in these heavily pretreated patients. These data indicate that carfilzomib 30-minute 
infusion can be given at very high levels, with >95% inhibition of blood proteasome 
levels achievable and with (at least) acute tolerability.  As a result, carfilzomib is now 
administered as a 30-minute infusion if the dose is ≥36mg/m2.  
In addition to the above observations, a phase I study of carfilzomib in patients with 
relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma was reported in abstract form at the 2009 
American Society of Hematology meeting which demonstrated that carfilzomib can be 
safely administered to patients with substantial renal impairment (CrCl < 30, including 
patients on dialysis) without dose adjustment (Badros et al. 2009).   These data indicate 
that carfilzomib does not exacerbate underlying renal dysfunction, and confirm the “pre-
renal” etiology of the BUN/creatinine elevations observed with IV bolus carfilzomib. 
1.4. Rationale for the Study 
Relapsed/refractory MM is an incurable disorder with a poor prognosis.  Carfilzomib is a 
novel proteasome inhibitor with activity in this setting.  Panobinostat is a pan-
deacetylase inhibitor which has shown synergistic cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo with 
proteasome inhibitors.  The combination should enhance the activity of both agents 
against myeloma cells.  In the Phase I part of the trial, the optimal doses of the 
combination of carfilzomib and panobinostat will be determined.  Assuming this 
combination is feasible, the Phase II portion will proceed, using the doses determined in 
Phase I.   This study will be conducted at multiple study sites by [CONTACT_432668], LLC (SCRI Innovations).

MM 27 AMD 5/03 AU G 2015 
 this decision in the patients’ medical records and as a comment on the Case Report 
Form (CRF). 
All patients who have CTCAE grade [ADDRESS_548235] returned to grade 1 or 2, or

missed or late menstrual period should be reported to the treating investigator).   
If an investigator suspects that a patient may be pregnant prior to administration of trial 
drug(s), the trial drug(s) must be withheld until the result of the pregnancy test is 
confirmed.  If a pregnancy is confirmed, the patient must not receive any trial drug(s), 
and must be discontinued from the trial.   
If an investigator suspects that a patient may be pregnant after the patient has been 
receiving trial drug(s), the trial drug(s) must immediately be withheld until the result of 
the pregnancy test is confirmed.  If a pregnancy is confirmed, the trial drug(s) must be 
immediately and permanently stopped, the patient must be discontinued from the trial, 
and the investigator must notify the SCRI Innovations study chair as soon as possible.  
If a patient becomes pregnant while enrolled in the trial, a Pregnancy Form (a paper 
report form, not available within EDC system) should be completed and faxed to the 
sponsor or designee.  For more details regarding handling and reporting of pregnancies 
that occur during treatment, see Section 11.5. 
4. STUDY REGISTRATION

the experimental nature of the treatment, potential benefits, alternatives, side-effects, 
risks and discomforts.  Human protection committee approvals of this protocol and 
consent form are required prior to patient enrollment .  Registration must occur prior to 
th
e initiation of protocol therapy.   
Eligible patients will be enrolled through SCRI Innovations.  Participating sites may call 
1-877-MY-1-SCRI for assistance, or fax a completed and signed Enrollment Form to the 
SCRI Innovations Enrollment Desk.  The SCRI Innovations fax registration number is

 5. STUDY DESIGN 
This is an open-label, non-randomized Phase I/II study of patients with relapsed or 
refractory multiple myeloma. 
The Phase I study will determine the MTD of the combination of carfilzomib and 
panobinostat.  The Phase I portion will follow a standard dose escalation design, 
beginning with dose level 1 (see Table 2).  Patients will be assessed for dose-limiting 
toxicity (DLT) at each visit during Cycle 1 prior to receiving treatment .  Dose 
modifications will not be permitted during Cycle 1 unless a patient experiences a DLT 
(see Section 5.2.2.).  Treatment cycles will be administered at 28-day intervals.  
Panobinostat will be administered orally three times weekly during weeks 1 and 3 of 
each cycle (Days 1, 3, 5, 15, 17, 19).  Carfilzomib will be administered intravenously on 
Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 of each cycle.  During Cycle 1, the carfilzomib dose will be 
escalated after the Day 2 dose, if well tolerated. 
A maximum of four dose levels were evaluated.  No DLTs were seen during the Phase I 
portion. 
In the Phase II portion of this study, patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma 
will receive treatment with the dose level 4 panobinostat and carfilzomib combination .  
Patients will be reevaluated for response to treatment after each cycle (4 weeks).  
Patients with objective response or stable disease will continue treatment, with 
subsequent reevaluations every [ADDRESS_548237] dose escalation design at additional dose levels  of 
th
e combination of carfilzomib and panobinostat (see Table 3 ).   
If additional dose levels  are found to be tolerable, then additional patients will be 
recruited into an expansion cohort which will be open at all sites - a maximum total of 36 
patients (including the ones recruited into the parallel Phase I study) will be treated at 
this dose level.  Sites will be notified about the expansion cohort and patients will enter 
in the dose level confirmed in their enrollment confirmation from SCRI Innovations. 
Up to 80 eligible patients will be treated in the Phase I/II study.  The treatment schema 
for the study is shown in Figure 2.

5.1. Treatment Plan 
Panobinostat and carfilzomib will be administered in the Phase I and Phase II portions 
of this trial as follows: 
5.1.1. Panobinostat  
PO TIW during weeks 1 and 3 of each 28-day cycle (i.e. D1, 3, 5, 15, 17, 19)   
Dose levels are defined in Table 2. 
Panobinostat will be self-administered (by [CONTACT_102]).   Patients should be instructed to 
ta
ke their once-a-day oral dose of panobinostat at the same time of each scheduled 
treatment day .  Panobinostat should be taken with a glass of water; the entire dose 
should be taken over as short a time as possible.  Patients should swallow the capsules 
as a whole and should not chew them.   Patients must avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice 
and Seville (sour) oranges during the entire study. 
If the patient forgets to take his/her dose, the patient may be instructed to take the dose 
up to [ADDRESS_548238] the vomited 
d
ose.  No missed doses should be made-up.   
5
.1.1.1. Panobinostat Administration – Electrolyte Monitoring and Cardiac 
Precautions 
Electrolyte Monitoring 
All patients must have an assessment of serum potassium, magnesium, and calcium 
(total corrected for albumin, or ionized calcium) ≤[ADDRESS_548239] all be ≥LLN before the first 
dose of panobinostat is administered. Throughout the study serum biochemistry values 
including serum potassium, calcium, phosphorus and ma gnesium will be monitored 
closely. Whenever serum potassium, calcium, phosphorus and magnesium are 
assessed, if the value is <LLN, then the patient’s potassium, calcium, phosphorus or 
magnesium should be immediately supplemented following the availability of that 
laboratory result, in order to minimize the time patients have low values. Patients must 
then undergo a repeat biochemistry test to demonstrate values ≥LLN. These values 
must be ≥ LLN before the patient is re-dosed with oral panobinostat. 
Patients must be instructed to not take panobinostat if their most recent biochemistry 
values demonstrate potassium, calcium, phosphorus or magnesium <LLN. At a 
minimum, potassium, magnesium, phosphorus and calcium will be checked according 
to the protocol. More frequent testing should be done if clinically indicated (e.g. patient 
 
  
Page 39 of 101 
MM 27 AMD 5/03 AU G 2015 
 has had prior low values; patient is taking medications that can result in lowering of their 
potassium, magnesium, phosphorus or calcium levels.  
 
ECG QTcF Monitoring 
Because of the observed QTc prolongation in several patients receiving panobinostat, 
to be eligible for this trial, the patient must have a mean QTc interval ≤ 450 at baseline .  
During Cycle 1 of panobinostat, ECG’s will be monitored intensively (see Table 1).  Prior 
to C1D1 and C1D5 dosing of panobinostat, all patients will have [ADDRESS_548240] a single ECG prior to the Day 1 panobinostat dose 
(assuming no QTc prolongation occurred during Cycle 1).

Carfilzomib will be administered over 30 minutes (see Section 6.4).    Dose levels to be 
te
sted are defined in Table 2 .  
Treatment cycles will be repeated every 28 days.  Patients will be evaluated for 
response to treatment every 4 weeks (i.e. after every cycle).    Patie nts with stable 
disease or better may continue on study treatme nt until evidence of disease 
progression.    
Hydration and Fluid Monitoring 
Oral hydration - All patients must be well hydrated (i.e., volume replete).  Begin oral 
hydration equal to approximately 30 mL/kg/day (~6–8 cups of liquid per day), starting 
[ADDRESS_548242] be reviewed 
with the patient and documented by [CONTACT_432671]; treatment is to be delayed or withheld if oral hydration is not deemed to b e 
satisfactory.   
Intravenous Fluids - 250–500 mL of IV normal saline (or other appropriate IV fluid 
formulation) must be given before and after each carfilzomib dose during Cycle 1.  If 
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or uric acid is elevated at Cycle 2, Day 1, then the 
recommended IV hydration should be repeated for Cycle 2 and all subsequent cycles 
until progression disease at the study doctor’s discretion to monitor TLS.  The goal of 
the hydration program is to maintain robust urine output, (e.g., ≥ 2 L/day).  Patients 
should be monitored periodically during this period for evidence of fluid overload.   
In patients considered to remain at risk for tumor lysis syndrome at completion of

oral and IV fluid hydration is contraindicated, e.g., due to pre-existing pulmonary, 
cardiac, or renal impairment, will not be eligible to participate in the clinical trial. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Carfilzomib Safety Considerations 
Based on previous Phase I and II carfilzomib studies, the following observations have 
been noted: 
 A “first dose effect” has been seen, which is notable for fever, chills, rigors, and/or 
dyspnea occurring during the evening following the first day of infusion and an 
 
  
Page 41 of 101 
MM 27 AMD 5/03 AU G 2015 
 increase in creatinine on Day 2, which may be the clinical sequelae of rapid tumor 
lysis and/or cytokine release.    
 Should a “first dose” effect occur at any point during Cycle 1 or 2, treatment with 
h
igh dose glucocorticoids (e.g. methylprednisolone 50–100 mg) is recommended.  I n 
addition, intravenous fluids, vasopressors, oxygen, bronchodilators, and 
acetaminophen should be available for immediate use and instituted, as medically 
indicated.  
 Dexamethasone 4 mg PO/IV will be administered prior to all carfilzomib doses 
during the first cycle and prior to all carfilzomib doses during the first dose-escalation 
(for example from 20 mg/m2 to 27 mg/m2) cycle.  If treatment-related fever, rigors, 
chills, and/or dyspnea are observed post any dose of carfilzomib after 
dexamethasone has been discontinued, dexamethasone (4 mg PO/IV) should be re-
started and administered prior to subsequent doses.  
 Patients should receive acyclovir or similar (famiciclovir, valacyclovir) anti-varicella 
(an
ti-herpes) agent prophylaxis.   In addition, patients may receive antibiotic 
p
rophylaxis with ciprofloxacin or other fluoroquinolone (or 
timethroprim/sulfamethoxazole if fluoroquinoles are contradicted) if clinically 
indicated.    
 CrCl changes are mostly transient, reversible, and non-cumulative. All patients 
should be well hydrated.  Clinically significant electrolyte abnormalities should be 
co
rrected prior to dosing with carfilzomib.  Renal function must be monitored closely 
during treatment with carfilzomib.  Serum chemistry values, including creatinine, are 
strongly encouraged prior to each dose of carfilzomib during Cycles [ADDRESS_548243] be held 
for subjects with a CrCl < 15 mL/min at any time during study participation. 
5.1.3. Window for Holidays and Vacations 
Fo
r holidays and vacations it is preferred to plan ahead and adjust D1 of treatment +/-  
[ADDRESS_548244] D1, the 
carfilzomib infusion days may be adjusted +/- 48 hours after cycle 1 for a holiday or 
vacation.  There is no window allowed during cycle 1 and for the panobinostat doses 
except for D1 with the window described above.

Page 43 of 101 
MM 27 AMD 5/[ADDRESS_548246] received one full cycle (28 days) of study drug 
treatment.  The following dose-escalation rules will be used: 
 Initially, 3 subjects will be entered into a dose level. 
 If 2 or more of the initial subjects experience dose-limiting toxicity 
(DLT) (see Section  5.2 .2), then the MTD ( see Section 5.2.3) has been 
exceeded. 
 If none of the 3 subjects initially enrolled into this dose level cohort 
experiences DLT, then subsequent subjects will be enrolled in the next 
higher dose level. 
 If 1 of the initial subjects experiences DLT, then 3 additional subjects 
(to a total of 6 subjects) will be enrolled in the dose level. 
 If it is found that 1 of the 6 subjects in the dose level encounters DLT, 
then subsequent subjects will be enrolled into the next higher dose 
level cohort. 
 If it is found that 2 or more of the 6 subjects in a dose level encounter 
DLT, then the MTD has been exceeded.   If ≥[ADDRESS_548247] dose level tested (Dose Level 1, Table 2), dose level -1 will 
be evaluated.  If dose level -1 is too toxic (≥2 of 6 patients with DLT), 
the study will continue only after discussion by [CONTACT_432672]. 
No 
intra-patient dose escalation is permitted. 
 
When the MTD has been exceeded: 
When the MTD has been exceeded, the next lower dose previously studied will be 
evaluated for the MTD criteria.  If only [ADDRESS_548248] been 
treated. 
 Once [ADDRESS_548249] been enrolled and evaluated at this dose level, if 
there was ≤1 DLT, this dose level will be declared the MTD. 
 If >1 DLT occurred, then the MTD has been exceeded, and the next 
lower dose level will be similarly evaluated. 
 Dose level -1 will only be tested if dose level 1 exceeds MTD.

MM 27 AMD 5/03 AU G 2015 
 5.2.2. Definitions of Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) 
For the purpose of determining the MTD ( see Section 5.2.3), DLT is defined as 
any of the following that are determined to be related to study treatment during 
Cycle 1:    
 Grade 4 neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] <500/µL) for 
>7 days. 
 Febrile neutropenia (ANC <1000/ µL with fever >101°F [38.5°C]). 
 Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with ≥ Grade 2 bleeding. 
 Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25,000/µL) > 7 days (patients 
may receive platelet support/transfusion ). 
 ≥ Grade 2 neuropathy with uncontrolled pain 
 ≥ Grade 3 non-hematologic drug-related toxicity (excluding alopecia) 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_432637] >[ADDRESS_548250] cycle. 
 Patients who are unable to receive 75% of the required doses of both 
agents secondary to toxicity. 
 
Adverse events will be graded using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common 
Toxicity Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 (CTCAE v4.0). 
Dose modifications are not permitted during Cycle [ADDRESS_548251] 
experiences a DLT.  Subjects in dose level -1 (see Table 2) who develop a DLT during 
Cy
cle [ADDRESS_548252] the assessment of the MTD for the given cohort; however, the subject may 
continue on therapy if the toxicity resolves and dose modifications can be implemented 
according to the dose modification guidelines in Section 6.0. 
Patients who withdraw from the study before receiving 75% of their scheduled 
Cycle 1 doses due a non-drug related AE (i.e., tumor progression) will be considered 
inevaluable and will be replaced.     
Patients without clinical evidence of progressive disease at the end of the first cycle of 
study therapy will continue treatment.  Patients will be reevaluated for response after 
completing 2 cycles (8 weeks) of treatment.  Patients with objective response or stable 
disease according the International Myeloma Working Group Uniform Response Criteria 
(see Appendix C) will continue treatment, with reevaluations until disease progression 
occurs, unacceptable toxicity develops, or the subject chooses to discontinue study 
treatment.  
 
  
Page 45 of 101 
MM 27 AMD 5/03 AU G 2015 
 5.2.3. Definition of Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) 
The MTD of carfilzomib and panobinostat when given as a combination therapy will be 
defined as the highest dose level at which ≤1 of 6 subjects experiences dose-limiting 
toxicity (DLT). 
When the MTD has been determined: 
When the MTD has been determined, the trial will continue to enroll patients with 
relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma at the established MTD established during th e 
Phase I portion.   
5.3. Phase II 
If a dose level in the parallel Phase I study is found to be tolerable, then additional 
patients will be recruited  into an expansion cohort of 30 patients for Phase II for a total 
of 60 Phase II patients (including 30 patients for dose level 4 )..  A maximum of up to 8 0 
total patients may be enrolled in this study (including patients from the dose escalation 
Phase I studies ).  
5.4. Concomitant Medications 
Patients must be instructed not to take any additional medications (including over-the-
counter products) during the trial without prior consultation with the study physician.  All 
medications taken within [ADDRESS_548253] be added or changed, the reason and name [CONTACT_18467]/therapy should be 
recorded. 
In general, the use of any concomitant medication/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_432638], including drugs given prophylactically (e.g. antiemetics) 
with the following exceptions: 
 Any medications which may cause QTc prolongation or induce Torsades 
d
e Pointes should not be used (see Appendix F).  Dolasetron is 
contraindicated while on treatment with Panobinostat. 
 Any medications that have the potential to alter serum electrolytes 
(e.g. diuretics) should be monitored very closely for electrolyte 
abnormalities as these can contribute to the risk of QTc prolongation and 
v
ent. 
 No other investigational therapy should be given to patients. 
 Allopurinol (in subjects at risk for TLS due to high tumor burden) is optional 
and will be prescribed at the study physician’s discretion.  These  patients 
may receive allopurinol 300 mg PO BID (Cycle 1 Day -2, Day -1), 
continuing for 2 days after Cycle 1 Day 1 (total of 4 days), then reduce 
dose to 300 mg PO QD, continuing through Day 17 of Cycle 1.  Allopurinol 
dose should be adjusted according to the package insert.    
 
  
Page 46 of 101 
MM 27 AMD 5/03 AU G 2015 
  No anticancer agents other than the study medications administered as 
p
art of this study protocol should be given to patients. If such agents are 
required for a patient then the patient must first be withdrawn from the 
study. 
 Leukocyte growth factors (e.g. G-CSF and GM-CSF) are not to be 
administered prophylactically but may be prescribed by [CONTACT_432673].  
 Medications known to be substrates of the isoenzyme CYP2D6 should be 
avoided if possible, as panobinostat can inhibit isoenzyme CYP2D6 at low 
micromolar ranges (see Appendix G).  
 Medications, food, and herbal preparations known to be strong inducers or 
i
nhibitors of CYP34A should be avoided if possible ( see Appendix G). 
6. 
DOSE MODIFICATIONS 
The criteria for interruption and resumption of treatment due to toxicity are outlined in 
the following tables. Dose re-escalation will not be allowed in any patient.  All toxicities 
will be graded utilizing the NCI CTCAE v4.0.  If toxicity occurs, the toxicity will be 
graded, and appropriate supportive care treatment will be administered to decrease the 
signs and symptoms thereof.  If one drug is held, treatment may continue with the other 
study drug as appropriate.  If study medication is held for over [ADDRESS_548254] a toxicity requiring dose reduction, the offending agent 
should be discontinued.  Either or both drugs may be adjusted according to the dose 
modification tables below.

 6.2.1. General Monitoring Principles 
The following cardiac monitoring guidelines are required for this study: 
1. Patients in screening will have a baseline ECG performed to determine eligibility.  
2. Enrolled patients will have ECGs collected as defined in Table 1.   
3. On treatment days when ECGs are to be obtained, the patient will take their 
medication in the clinic.  Prior to the first dose of panobinostat (Cycle 1, Day 1), the 
QTcF interval from each of the [ADDRESS_548279] be ≤[ADDRESS_548280] be ≤450 msec before the patient is dosed.  This 
real-time assessment will be based on the QTc intervals as determined at the clinical 
center.  
4. If the patient does not meet the QTc criteria for dosing,  the patient’s serum 
potassium, magnesium, calcium and phosphorus must be measured immediately, 
and the patient must receive supplements to correct any low values.  
5. If the patient experiences a QTcF >[ADDRESS_548281] a treatment 
cycle with no QT prolongation.  
6. At any time, if any ECGs (baseline or post-dose) demonstrate a QTc value 
≥ [ADDRESS_548282] notify the Sponsor immediately.  In addition, the 
patient’s serum potassium, magnesium, calcium and phosphorus must be measured 
immediately, and the patient must receive supplements to correct any low values.   
7. All ECGs will be reviewed by [CONTACT_432676].    
8. In general, panobinostat dose reductions or discontinuations will occur in the 
following circumstances:  
 Repeat dosing delays due to prolonged QTc intervals 
 QTc ≥ 480 msec but < 500 msec (in absence of electrolyte abnormalities). 
 Any QTc ≥ 500 msec (discontinuation). 
Fo
r patients requiring a dose reduction, 3 pre-dose ECG’s will be done on the first 
day of the new lower dose, and 3-hours post-dose (x 3).    
If however, it was determined that the QTc prolongation was secondary to electrolyte 
a
bnormalities or concomitant medications , panobinostat may be continue at the 
same dose level.   ECGs will be repeated - pre-dose (x3), 3-hours post-dose (x3), on 
the next scheduled dosing day. 
9. Any QTc ≥ [ADDRESS_548283] by [CONTACT_093] (if clinically indicated).

MM 27 AMD 5/[ADDRESS_548284] 8 cycles, the QT 
monitoring is no longer required and may be performed at the Investigator’s 
discretion. 
Any patient who has an ECG with a QTc  [ADDRESS_548285] the patient’s serum potassium, magnesium, calcium, and 
phosphorus immediately.   
If any QTc interval is ≥[ADDRESS_548286] at a minimum, hourly ECG 
monitoring until the QTc is <480 msec. In addition to the minimum hourly ECG 
monitoring, telemetry monitoring is strongly recommended. Prior to a patient with a QTc 
interval >[ADDRESS_548287] 6 hours after dosing that demonstrate a 
QTc interval of ≤480 msec. 
If any patient has a QTc interval ≥ [ADDRESS_548288] 
be discontinued from the study. 
6.3. Carfilzomib Dose Modifications for Non-Hematologic Toxicities 
Treatment with carfilzomib and panobinostat should be held for ≥ gra de 3 events until 
resolved to ≤ grade 1 or return to baseline.  If the adverse event was not treatment-
related, or was attributable to panobinostat, subsequent treatment with carfilzomib may 
be resumed at full dose after resolution to ≤ grade 1 or return to baseline. 
If the event was carfilzomib-related, subsequent treatment with carfilzomib will resume 
a
t one level dose reduction (see Table 3).  If toxicity continues or recurs, a 2nd 
carfilzomib dose reduction is permitted unless the patient is already receiving the lowest 
dose level shown in Table 3.   If toxicity continues, the patient should be discontinued 
f
rom treatment. 
If there is no resolution of carfilzomib-related toxicity after 2 weeks of withholding 
carfilzomib (up to 3 weeks for infection treatment), carfilzomib will be discontinued. 
Specific carfilzomib-associated non-hematologic toxicities are addressed in Table 7.

6.4. Management of Carfilzomib-Related Events 
6.4.1.  Cardiopulmonary Disorders 
New or worsening cardiac failure (e.g., congestive cardiac heart failure, pulmonary 
edema, and decreased ejection fraction), myocardial ischemia, and myocardial 
infarction have occurred following administration of carfilzomib.  Death due to cardiac 
arrest has occurred within a day of carfilzomib administration, and fatal outcomes have 
been reported with cardiac failure and myocardial infarction.   
While adequate hydration is required prior to dosing in Cycle 1, all subjects should be 
monitored for evidence of volume overload, especially subjects at risk for cardiac failure.  
The total volume of fluids may be adjusted as clinically indicated in subjects with 
baseline cardiac failure or who are at high risk for cardiac failure. 
Withhold carfilzomib for Grade 3 or 4 cardiac events until recovery and consider 
whether to restart carfilzomib at 1 dose level reduction based on a benefit/risk 
assessment. 
6.4.2. Pulmonary Hypertension 
In Phase 2 studies, pulmonary arterial hypertension was reported in 2% of subjects 
treated with carfilzomib and was Grade 3 or greater in less than 1% of subjects.  In the 
pooled safety data from studies where carfilzomib was used in combination with 
lenalidomide-dexamethasone and in monotherapy studies (with or without 
dexamethasone) (N = 1581), events within the narrow pulmonary hypertension 
standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) query were 
reported in 1.1% of subjects.  However, the incidence of pulmonary hypertension was 
similar across treatment groups in randomized, controlled studies where carfilzomib was 
used in combination with lenalidomide-dexamethasone and also in monotherapy studies 
(with or without dexamethasone).  Therefore, a causal relationship with carfilzomib has 
not been demonstrated and pulmonary hypertension is considered an important 
potential risk.  
 
  
Page 58 of 101 
MM 27 AMD 5/03 AU G 2015 
 Patients with [LOCATION_001] Heart Association Class III and IV heart failure, myocardial 
infarction in the preceding 6 months, and conduction abnormalities uncontrolled by 
[CONTACT_432677], as they may be at 
greater risk of cardiopulmonary complications. 
Monitor subjects for signs and symptoms of pulmonary hypertension .  Evaluate with 
cardiac imaging and/or other tests as indicated .  Withhold carfilzomib until resolved or 
returned to baseline and consider whether to restart carfilzomib based on a risk/benef it 
assessment. 
6.4.3. Acute Renal Disorder 
Cases of acute renal failure have been reported in subjects who received carfilzomib.   
Acute renal failure was reported more frequently in subjects with advanced relapsed 
and refractory multiple myeloma who received carfilzomib monotherapy.  This risk was 
increased in subjects with a decrease in estimated creatinine clearance, calculated 
using Cockcroft and Gault equation, prior to receiving carfilzomib .  Monitor renal 
function with regular measurement of the serum creatinine and/or estimated creatinine 
clearance.   Reduce or withhold dose as appropriate. 
[ADDRESS_548290] tightness, or angina .  These reactions can occur immediately following 
or up to 24 hours after administration of carfilzomib.  Administer dexamethasone prior to 
carfilzomib either as premedication or as part of combination therapy to reduce the 
incidence and severity of reactions. 
6.4.6. Thrombocytopenia 
Carfilzomib causes thrombocytopenia with platelet nadirs observed between Day 8 and 
Day 15 of each 28-day cycle with recovery to baseline platelet count by [CONTACT_432678].  Monitor platelet counts frequently during treatment with carfilzomib.  Reduce 
or withhold dose as appropriate. 
 
  
Page 59 of 101 
MM 27 AMD 5/[ADDRESS_548291] been reported.  Carfilzomib can 
cause elevations of serum transaminases .  Monitor liver enzymes regularly .  Reduce or 
withhold dose as appropriate. 
6.4.8. Thrombocytopenic Thrombotic Purpura/Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome 
Cases of thrombocytopenic thrombotic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS) 
including those with fatal outcome have been reported in subjects who received 
carfilzomib.  Monitor for signs and symptoms of TTP/HUS.  If the diagnosis is 
suspected, stop carfilzomib and manage per standard of care including plasma 
exchange as clinically appropriate.  If the diagnosis of TTP/HUS is excluded, carfilzomib 
can be restarted .  The safety of reinitiating carfilzomib therapy in subjects previously 
experiencing TTP/HUS is not known.  
6.4.9. Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome 
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), formerly termed reversible 
posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS), is a rare neurological disorder, which 
can present with seizure, headache, lethargy, confusion, blindness, altered 
consciousness, and other visual and neurological disturbances, along with 
hypertension. 
The diagnosis is confirmed by [CONTACT_114890]-radiological imaging.  If diagnosed early and 
treated, the symptoms of PRES may be reversed.  Cases of PRES have been reported 
in subjects receiving carfilzomib.  Discontinue carfilzomib if PRES is suspected.  The 
safety of reinitiating carfilzomib therapy in subjects previously experiencing PRES is not 
known.

After withdrawal from or completion of protocol treatment, patients must be followed for 
adverse events for [ADDRESS_548295] dose of study drug during years 1 and 
2, every 6 months during years 3-5, and annually thereafter for toxicity, disease 
progression, and survival.  Appropriate disease assessments will be performed every

After disease progression is documented, patients will be followed every 3 months.  
A
ssessments during this time will be performed as described in Appendix E. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy test 
All females of childbearing potential should complete a serum or urine pregnancy test 
within [ADDRESS_548296] been amenorrheic for ≥ 12 months in order to be 
considered “of non-childbearing potential”.  
8. DRUG FORMULATION, AVAILABILITY, ADMINISTRATION, AND TOXICITY 
INFORMATION  
8.1. Panobinostat 
8.1.1. Panobinostat Formulation 
Panobinostat (also known as LBH589) will be provided by [CONTACT_5343]. Oral panobinostat 
will be supplied as 5- mg, 15-mg, or 20-mg pi[INVESTIGATOR_8745]/opaque-colored, hard gelatin capsules. 
8.1.2. Panobinostat  Drug Supply 
Panobinostat for use in this study will be supplied to the Sponsor, SCRI  Development 
Innovations , LLC (SCR I Innovations) , by [CONTACT_5343] .  Study sites will obtain panobinostat 
from Sponsor designee(s) at SCRI Innovations  per instructions provided to participating 
study sites.   
Accountability for the drug at all study sites is the responsibility of the principal 
inv
estigator at each study site.  The investigator will ensure that the drug is used only in 
accordance with this protocol.  Drug accountability records indicating the drug’s delivery 
date to the site (if applicable), inventory at the site (if applicable), use by [CONTACT_6904], 
and return to SCRI Innovations or disposal of the drug  (if applicable and  if approved by  
[CONTACT_432680] ) will be ma intained by [CONTACT_977].  Accountability records will 
include d ates, quantities, lot numbers, expi[INVESTIGATOR_1659] (if applicable), and patient 
numbers.  Once panobinostat is shipped to a site, it may not be shipped or shared with 
another site or patient.  
All material containing panobinostat will be treated and disposed of as hazardous waste 
in accordance with governing regulations. 
 
  
Page 65 of 101 
MM 27 AMD 5/03 AU G 2015 
 8.1.3. Storage and Stability 
The storage conditions for study drug will be described on the medication label. 
8.1.4. Administration 
Oral panobinostat capsules should be administered as follows:  
 Patients should be instructed to take their three times a week oral dose of 
panobinostat at the same time on each dosing day (e.g. day 1, 3, and 5).  Doses 
should be separated by a minimum of 30 hours.    
 Dose may be taken with or without food.  
o In the event that the patient does not take the daily dose at the specified 
routine time, unrelated to toxicity (for example, the patient forgets), but the 
dose can be taken within 12 hours of the specified time, then s/he may 
take the daily dose at that time.  If more than [ADDRESS_548297] passed, that 
day’s dose should be withheld, and the patient should wait to take 
panobinostat until the next scheduled treatment day.  The patient should 
then continue treatment with the original dosing schedule.  This should be 
clearly documented on the Dosage Administration Record CRF by a 
member of the research team. 
o Each dose of panobinostat should be taken with a glass (approximately 
240 mL) of water.  Patients should be instructed to swallow the capsules 
whole and not chew them.  
o If vomiting occurs during the course of treatment, then no re-dosing of the 
patient is allowed before the next scheduled dose.  
o Patients must avoid grapefruits, grapefruit juice, Seville (sour) oranges 
and Seville orange juice during the entire study period. 
Note:  Food influence on panobinostat PK was evaluated in patients with advanced 
cancer who received [ADDRESS_548298] conditions CLBH589B2111.  The overall exposure and inter-patient 
variability (CV 59%) in 34 patients remained unchanged with or without food, whereas 
Cmax was transiently reduced (<45%) by [CONTACT_8208] (i.e., both normal and high fat breakfast). 
 Since the overall extent of absorption was not altered by [CONTACT_8208], food is unlikely to 
significantly impact panobinostat systemic exposure in cancer patients.  
8.1.5. Panobinostat Toxicities 
Most frequently reported adverse events (occurred in at least 30% of patients): 
1. Fatigue and weakness 
2. Decreased appetite, anorexia or altered taste 
3. Diarrhea which can lead to dehydration, loose stools, abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
4. Nausea and vomiting  
 
  
Page 66 of 101 
MM 27 AMD 5/[ADDRESS_548299] been observed in ongoing clinical trials: 
1. Weight loss 
2. QTc prolongation, atrial fibrillation 
3. Changes in thyroid function 
4. Changes in blood electrolytes and glucose 
5. Increase in creatinine levels  
6. Other side effects reported include:  back, extremity, muscle, joint and bone pain, 
headache, coughing, breathing problems including shortness of breath, anxiety, 
depression, dizziness, constipation, fever, abdominal pain, swelling in the legs or 
eye, itchiness, peripheral ischemia, chest pain, loss of feeling or tingling in the 
arms and legs, inflammation of nose, throat and lining of the mouth. 
8.1.6. Panobinostat Precautions and Risks 
Patients must avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice and Seville (sour) oranges or juice 
during the entire study. 
Medications known to be substrates of the isoenzyme CYP2D6 should be avoided if 
possible, since panobinostat can inhibit isoenzyme CYP2D6 at low micromolar ranges. 
Drugs that can inhibit/induce CYP3A4/5  
Drugs that can inhibit CYP3A4/5  
Panobinostat is metabolized in vitro  by [CONTACT_097]3A4/5. A clinical drug-drug interactio n 
study with ketoconazole and panobinostat has recently been completed.  The less 
than 2-fold increase in panobinostat AUC upon co-administration with 
ketoconazole suggests that CYP3A contribution to the total clearance of 
panobinostat is low.  The observed interaction is not considered clinically relevant, 
as panobinostat doses at least 2-fold greater than 20 mg (40 and 60 mg) have 
been safely administered in patients.  CYP3A4 inhibitors should have no major 
impact on the exposure of panobinostat and may be co-administered when 
medically necessary.  
Drugs that are potent CYP3A4/5 inducers  
As it is with other medications that are metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4, clinical judgment 
is to be exercised when potent CYP3A4 inducers are concomitantly taken with 
panobinostat .  
 
  
Page 67 of 101 
MM 27 AMD 5/[ADDRESS_548300] the potential to alter serum 
electrolytes (e.g. diuretics) should be monitored closely for electrolyte abnormalities as 
these can contribute to the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias. 
Anti-Coagulant Therapy 
Panobinostat therapy is commonly associated with mild to moderate degree 
thrombocytopenia, which may increase the risk of bleeding with concomitant sodium 
warfarin (Coumadin).  It is recommended that patients who require anticoagulation 
therapy while on panobinostat therapy use low molecular weight heparin (LMWH).  
However, if the use of LMWH is not feasible, patients on sodium warfarin may continue 
such therapy while on panobinostat but for such patients, PT/INR should be closely 
monitored and maintained with in a therapeutic range.  The dose of sodium warfarin may 
be adjusted as needed while on panobinostat. If the patient’s platelets drop below 
50,000 consideration should be given to suspending treatment with anticoagulation. 
8.2. Carfilzomib 
8.2.1. Carfilzomib Formulation 
Carfilzomib for injection will be provided as a lyophilized powder which, when 
reconstituted, contains 2 mg/mL isotonic solution of carfilzomib free base in 10 mM 
sodium citrate buffer (pH 3.5) containing 10% (w/v) sulfobutylether- -cyclodextrin 
(SBE--CD, Captisol®).   
8.2.2. Drug Supply of Carfilzomib 
Carfilzomib for use in this study will be supplied to the Sponsor, SCRI Innovations  by 
[CONTACT_159474] .  Study sites will obtain carfilzomib from Sponsor designee(s) at SCRI Innovations  
per instructio ns provided to participating study sites.   
Accountability for the drug at all study sites is the responsibility of the principal 
inv
estigator at each study site.  The investigator will ensure that the drug is used only in 
accordance with this protocol.  Drug accountability records indicating the drug’s delivery 
date to the site (if applicable), inventory at the site (if applicable), use by [CONTACT_6904], 
and return to SCRI Innovations or disposal of the drug  (if applicable and  if approved by  
[CONTACT_432681] s) will be ma int ained by [CONTACT_977].  Accountability records will 
include dates, quantities, lot numbers, expi[INVESTIGATOR_1659] (if applicable), and patient 
numbers.  Once carfilzomib is shipped to a site, it may not be shipped or shared with 
another sit e or patient.  
All material containing carfilzomib will be treated and disposed of as hazardous waste in 
accordance with governing regulations. 
 
  
Page 68 of 101 
MM 27 AMD 5/[ADDRESS_548301] be stored at 2–8ºC, in a securely locked area 
to 
which access is limited to appropriate study personnel. 
8.2.4. Administration   
Carfilzomib for Injection is supplied as a lyophilized parenteral product in single-use 
vials. The lyophilized product is reconstituted with water for injection to a final 
ca
rfilzomib concentration of 2.0 mg/mL prior to administration.  The dose will be 
calculated using the subject’s actual BSA at baseline.  Subjects with a BSA > 2.[ADDRESS_548302] 48 hours before Cycle 1 Day 1, oral hydrati on should be given as follows:  
30 mL/kg/day (approximately 6 to 8 cups of liquid per day) continuing up to the time of 
treatment.  Subject compliance must be assessed before initiating treatment, which is to 
be delayed if oral hydration is not adequate.  In subjects considered at risk for TLS, oral 
hydration should be continued in Cycle [ADDRESS_548303]’s 
medical condition and at the Investigator’s discretion.  
IV hydration will be given immediately prior to carfilzomib during Cycle 1.  This will 
consist of 250 to 500 mL normal saline or other appropriate IV fluid.  If lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH) or uric acid is elevated (and/or in subjects considered still at risk 
for TLS) at Cycle [ADDRESS_548304] urine output (e.g., ≥ 2 L/day).  Subjects should be monitored periodically 
during this period for evidence of fluid overload.  
If the subject has a dedicated line for carfilzomib administration, the line must be flushed 
with a minimum of 20 mL of normal saline prior to and after drug administration.     
Carfilzomib will be given as an IV infusion over approximately 10 minutes.  For doses > 
27 mg/m2, carfilzomib should be infused over [ADDRESS_548305] dose IV hydration  (between 250 mL and 500 mL normal saline 
or other appropriate IV fluid formulation) will be given.  Subjects should be monitored 
periodically during this period for evidence of fluid overload. 
8.2.5. Carfilzomib Toxicities 
Most frequently reported adverse events are reported in the current carfilzomib 
Investigator’s Brouchure (IB) . 
8.2.6. Carfilzomib Precautions and Risks 
The precautions and risks that are related to carfilzomib are pulmonary hypertension, 
cardiopulmonary disorders, acute renal failure, tumor lysis syndrome, infusion reactions, 
 
  
Page 69 of 101 
MM 27 AMD 5/03 AU G 2015 
 thrombocytopenia, hepatic toxicity, thrombocytopenic thrombotic purpura/hemolytic 
uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS), and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome 
(PRES
).  Management of carfilzomib-related toxicities is addressed in Section 6.3 and 
6.4 and in the current carfilzomib IB. 
9. RESPONSE EVALUATIONS AND MEASUREMENTS 
Response to treatment and disease progression will be evaluated using the 
International Myeloma Working group Uniform Response Criteria: Disease Progression 
and Relapse (see Appendix C). 
 
CR  Complete Response 
sCR subcategory: stringent complete response 
VGPR  Very good partial response  
PR  Partial response 
SD  Stable disease 
PD  Progressive disease 
 
All response categories (CR, sCR, VGPR, PR, PD) require two consecutive 
asse
ssments made at any time before the institution of any new therapy, as well as no 
known evidence of progressive or new bone lesions if radiographic studies were 
performed. Radiographic studies are not required to satisfy these response 
requirements. Bone marrow assessments are not required to be confirmed by [CONTACT_86617]. 
Complete Response should be confirmed with a bone marrow biopsy for morphology 
and a bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_171760], FISH and cytogenetics performed 
locally.  Additional confirmatory studies include SPEP, UPEP, immunofixation of blood 
and urine and serum free light chains (see Appendix E).  
MR  Minimal Response 
Minimal Response (MR) should be reported for patients with relapsed refractory 
myeloma.  When reported, the specific rate of MR should be distinguished from PR or 
better. 
10. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE  
10.1. Determination of Sample Size 
MM 27 is a Phase I/Phase II study of carfilzomib in combination with panobinostat in the 
treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. The total number of patients 
expected to be accrued is up to 80. 
 
  
Page 70 of 101 
MM 27 AMD 5/03 AU G 2015 
 The Phase I efficacy objective is to establish the optimal dose of carfilzomib with 
panobinostat that can be administered to patients with relapsed/refractory multiple 
myeloma . In this part of the trial, the optimal dose combination to be administered will 
b
e determined as described in Section 5.2.  Since 3-6 patients will be treated in each 
cohort, the maximum number of patients treated in this phase will be 24. 
The Phase II efficacy objective is to evaluate the overall response in patients with 
relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma treated at the optimal dose level in the first 4 dose 
levels established during the Phase I portion. In addition, the overall response in 
patients at any additional dose levels  will be evaluated. The response rates in the two 
d
ose levels will be evaluated separately. When used in the treatment of patients with 
relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, the historical carfilzomib overall response rate is 
approximately 18%.  It is hypothesized that the overall response rate for the treatment 
regimen of carfilzomib plus panobinostat is greater than that for patients treated with 
carfilzomib alone.  A sample size of 27 achieves 80% power to detect an increase in the 
overall response rate to 36% (representing a 100% relative improvement) based on a 
one-sided test of proportion at an alpha level of 0.10.  The sample size will be increased 
by 10% to account for potential non-evaluable patients and adjusted relative to the 
actual number of patients in the Phase I portion who are treated at the optimal dose 
level. 
10.2. Statistical Analyses 
10.3. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized using descriptive 
sta
tistics for continuous variables, and frequencies and percentages for categorical 
variables. 
10.4. Efficacy Analyses 
Efficacy will be evaluated for patients treated at the optimal dose level from the first 4 
dose levels during Phase I together with those entered in the Phase II dose expansion 
portion of the study, and at any additional dose levels (if found to be tolerable and 
p
atients are recruited into the expansion cohort). The data from the two dose levels will 
be evaluated separately, and no formal statistical comparisons will be made between 
the two dose levels .  
The efficacy endpoints are overall response rate (primary endpoint ), time- to-
progression, progression-free survival , and overall survival. 
1
0.4.1. Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s) 
The overall response rate (CR, VGPR, or PR) will be presented along with 95% 
confidence intervals calculated using both asymptotic normal approximation and exact 
binomial methods. 
 
  
Page 71 of 101 
MM 27 AMD 5/03 AU G 2015 
 10.4.2. Secondary Efficacy Endpoint(s) 
Time- to-progression (TTP), progressi on-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) 
will be analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods. Time- to-progression will be measured 
from the date of first protocol treatment until the date of tumor progression is 
documented (event), or date of last adequate tumor assessment (censored).  
Progression-free survival will be measured from the date of first protocol treatment until 
the date of tumor progression is documented or death occurs (event), or date of last 
adequate tumor assessment (censored). Overall survival will be measured as the 
interval from first study treatment until date of death (event), or date last known alive 
(censored). Median progression-free survival and median overall survival will be 
reported using the respective point estimate and 95% confidence intervals. 
10.5. Safety Analyses 
Safety will be evaluated for patients entered in the Phase I and Phase II portions of the 
study. The primary safety endpoint is tolerability of combination panobinostat and 
carfilzomib. 
The analyses of safety will be based on the frequency of adverse events and their 
severity for patients in each cohort who received at least one dose of study treatment.  
Worst toxicity grades per patient will be tabulated for select adverse events and 
laboratory measurements by [CONTACT_241561] v4.0. 
11. SAFETY REPORTING AND ANALYSES 
11.1. Safety Analyses 
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording protocol-defined adverse 
events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs); measurement of protocol specified 
hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis variables; measurement of protocol-
specified vital signs; and other protocol-specified tests that are deemed critical to the 
safety evaluation of the trial drug. 
11.2. Adverse Events 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_432639].  If 
not delegated it is the Sponsor’s responsibility to report relevant SAEs to the applicable 
local, national, or international regulatory body. 
11.2.1. Definitions of Adverse Events 
An adverse event is the development of an undesirable medical condition, or the 
deterioration of a pre-existing medical condition following or during exposure to a 
medicinal product, whether or not considered causally related to the product.   
 
  
Page 72 of 101 
MM 27 AMD 5/03 AU G 2015 
 An undesirable medical condition can be symptoms (e.g., nausea, chest pain), signs 
(e.g., tachycardia, enlarged liver), or the abnormal results of an investigation 
(e.g., laboratory findings).   
11.2.2. Recording of Adverse Events 
All adverse events of any patient during the course of the trial will be reported in the 
case report form, and the investigator will give his or her opi[INVESTIGATOR_432640] (i.e., whether the event is related or unrelated 
to trial drug administration).  If the adverse event is serious, it should be reported 
immediately to the sponsor or designee.  Other untoward events occurring in the 
framework of a clinical trial are also to be recorded as AEs (i.e., AEs that occur prior to 
assignment of trial treatment that are related to a protocol-mandated intervention, 
including invasive procedures such as biopsies, medication washout, or no treatment 
run-in). 
All AEs regardless of seriousness or relationship to trial drug(s), spanning from the start 
of trial treatment, until 30 calendar days after discontinuation   of protocol-specific 
treatment as defined by [CONTACT_56485], are to be recorded on the 
corresponding   case report form (CRF).  
11.2.3. Abnormal Laboratory Values and Vital Signs 
The reporting of abnormalities of vital signs as adverse events should be avoided.  
Abnormalities of vital signs should not be reported unless any criterion for an SAE is 
fulfilled, the vital signs abnormalities cause the patient to discontinue trial treatment, or 
the investigator insists that the abnormality should be reported as an AE.  Any grade 
3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities or any clinically significant grade 1 or 2 hematology or 
biochemistry laboratory value(s) should be recorded as an AE.  If an abnormal 
laboratory value or vital sign is associated with clinical signs and/or symptoms, the sign 
or symptom should be reported as an AE, and the associated laboratory value or vital 
sign should be considered additional information that must be collected on the relevant 
CRF. 
11.2.4. Handling of Adverse Events 
All adverse events resulting in discontinuation from the trial should be followed until 
resolution or stabilization.  Patients must be followed for AEs for 30 calendar days after 
discontinuation   of protocol-specific treatment (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation, oral 
medications, targeted therapy, and surgery).  All new AEs occurring during this period 
must be reported and followed until resolution unless, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], 
these values are not likely to improve because of the underlying disease.  In this case, 
the investigators must record his or her reasoning for this decision in the patient’s 
medical record and as a comment on the CRF.  After 30 days, only AEs, SAEs, or 
deaths assessed by [CONTACT_283585]. 
 
  
Page 73 of 101 
MM 27 AMD 5/03 AU G 2015 
 11.3. Serious Adverse Events 
11.3.1. Definitions of Serious Adverse Events 
The definitions of serious adverse events (SAEs) are given below.  The principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_432641]. 
An SAE or reaction is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that: results in 
death, is immediately life-threatening, requires at least a 24-hour in-patient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], results in persistent or 
significant disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
The definition of SAE also includes any important medical event.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in 
other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the patient or may 
require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the previous 
definition.  These should also usually be considered serious.  Examples of such events 
are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.  Death due to disease progression will be recorded on 
the CRF and as an SAE up to [ADDRESS_548306] dose of trial drug. 
Treatment within or admission to the following facilities is not considered to meet the 
criteria of “in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” (although if any other SAE criteria are met, the 
event must still be treated as an SAE and immediately reported): 
 Emergency Department or Emergency Room 
 Outpatient or same-day surgery units 
 Observation or short-stay unit 
 Rehabilitation facili ty 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_64341] 
 Nursing homes, Custodial care or Respi[INVESTIGATOR_432642] a pre-planned surgical or medical procedure (one 
which was planned prior to entry in the trial), does not require reporting as a serious 
adverse event to the Sponsor. 
11.3.2. Serious Adverse Event Reporting by [CONTACT_241573] “serious” and “severe” adverse events, as the 
terms are not synonymous.  Severity is a measure of intensity; however, an AE of 
severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For  example, nausea 
which persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but may not be 
considered an SAE.  On the other hand, a stroke which results in only a limited degree 
of disability may be considered only a mild stroke, but would be considered an SAE.  
 
  
Page 74 of 101 
MM 27 AMD 5/[ADDRESS_548307] knowledge of 
the event by [CONTACT_14209].   
To report a SAE, the appropriate CRF pages should be completed with the necessary 
information.  The CRF pages required for SAE reporting include: 
 Adverse Event and Safety Complementary pages 
 Trial drug dosing 
 Concomitant Medications 
 Demographics  
 Medical History 
 
 
All SAEs and medically confirmed deaths (regardless of causality assessment) 
occurring on trial treatment or within [ADDRESS_548308] be reported to 
the sponsor as SAEs within the CRF and followed until resolution (with autopsy report if 
applicable). 
Deaths occurring [ADDRESS_548309] trial treatment that are deemed ‘possibly’ or 
‘probably’ related to trial drug must be reported as SAEs within the CRF (with an 
autopsy report if available). 
Deaths occurring [ADDRESS_548310] trial treatment and not attributed to trial treatment 
(e.g., disease progression) need not be reported as SAEs, but simply captured on the 
appropriate CRF. 
The investigator must review and sign off on the SAE data within the CRF.   The SAE 
will be reported to the sponsor or designee as outlined in the Safety Monitoring Plan.   
Follow-up information for SAEs and information on non-serious AEs that become 
serious should also be reported to the sponsor or designee as soon as it is available; 
these reports should be submitted using the CRF.   The detailed SAE reporting process 
will be provided to the sites in the Safety Monitoring Plan.  
Investigators must report SAEs and follow-up information to their responsible 
Institutional Review Board (IRBs)/Ethics Committee according to the policies of the 
responsible IRB/IEC.

 11.3.3. [COMPANY_001] Instructions for Rapid Notification of Serious Adverse Events 
The Sponsor has the obligation to report all SAEs to [COMPANY_001] Pharmaceuticals Clinical 
Safety and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_066] (CS&E), and to report SAEs to the FDA and IRB 
as applicable.  All events reported to the FDA are to be filed utilizing Form FDA 3500A 
(MedWatch Form), or other approved form. 
All events must be reported by [CONTACT_432683]&E Department 
within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.  This includes serious, related, unlabeled 
(unexpected) adverse experiences.  All deaths during treatment or within [ADDRESS_548311] be reported within 1 business day 
of learning of its occurrence.  Reports should be faxed to:

Any SAE occurring until [ADDRESS_548312] medical treatment given to a patient (e.g., treatment withdrawal during 
washout period, change in treatment to a fixed dose of concomitant medication). 
Serious adverse events occurring more than 4 weeks after study discontinuation need 
only be reported if a relationship to the [COMPANY_001] study drug (or therapy) is suspected.

11.3.6. Sponsor SAE Reporting Requirements 
The sponsor is responsible for reporting relevant SAEs to the competent authority, other 
applicable regulatory authorities, and participating investigators, in accordance with ICH 
guidelines, FDA regulations, and/or local regulatory requirements. 
The Sponsor is responsible for reporting unexpected fatal or life-threatening events 
associated with the use of the trial drugs to the regulatory agencies and competent 
authorities via telephone or fax within 7 calendar days after being notified of the event.  
The sponsor will report all related but unexpected SAEs including non-death/non-life-
threatening related but unexpected SAEs associated with the use of the trial 
medications to the appropriate competent authorities (according to local guidelines), 
investigators, and central IRBs/IECs (except in the [LOCATION_002] where investigators 
are responsible for reporting to their IRBs per local requirements) by a written safety 
report within [ADDRESS_548314] medical terminology/concepts when recording AEs or 
SAEs on the SAE Report Forms and AE CRF.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations. 
All AEs, including those that meet SAE reporting criteria, should be recorded on the AE 
CRF; AEs that meet the definition of an SAE should additionally be reported following 
the procedures noted in Section 11.3.2. 
11.4.1. Diagnosis vs. Signs and Symptoms 
All AEs should be recorded individually in the patient’s own words (verbatim) unless, in 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_432644], the AEs constitute 
components of a recognized condition, disease, or syndrome.  In the latter case, the 
condition, disease, or syndrome should be named rather than each individual sign o r 
symptom.  If a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically 
characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual 
event should be recorded as an AE or SAE as appropriate on the relevant form(s) (SAE 
Report Form and/or AE CRF).  If a diagnosis is subsequently established, it should be 
reported as follow-up information is available.  If a diagnosis is determined subsequent 
to the reporting of the constellation of symptoms, the signs/symptoms should be 
updated to reflect the diagnosis. 
 
  
Page 77 of 101 
MM 27 AMD 5/03 AU G 2015 
 11.4.2. Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events 
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between patient 
evaluation time points.  Such events should only be recorded once on the SAE Report 
Form and/or the AE CRF.  If a persistent AE becomes more severe or lessens in 
severity, it should be recorded on a separate SAE Report Form and/or AE CRF.   
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves between patient evaluation time points, 
and subsequently recurs.  All recurrent AEs should be recorded on an SAE Report 
Form and/or AE CRF. 
11.4.3. Abnormal Laboratory Values 
Any grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities or any clinically significant grade 1 or 2 
hematology or biochemistry laboratory value(s) should be recorded as an AE.   If an 
a
bnormal laboratory value or vital sign is associated with clinical signs and/or 
symptoms, the sign or symptom should be reported as an AE, and the associated 
laboratory value or vital sign should be considered additional information that must be 
collected on the relevant CRF.  If the laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or 
syndrome, only the diagnosis needs to be recorded on the SAE Report Form or AE 
CRF. 
11.4.4. Deaths 
For this protocol, progression-free survival is the primary efficacy endpoint; time to 
treatment-failure, overall survival, and response rate are secondary endpoints.  Deaths 
that occur during the protocol-specified AE reporting period that are attributed by [CONTACT_206855] “Trial 
Discontinuation”  CRF and reported as SAEs for up to [ADDRESS_548315] “Death NOS” on the 
CRF Adverse Event page.  During post-trial survival follow-up, deaths attributed to 
progression of disease will be recorded only on the “After Progressive Disease Follow-
Up” CRF. 
11.4.5. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or Surgery 
Any AE that results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58170] >24 hours or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_432645].  There are some hospi[INVESTIGATOR_432646] (refer to Section 11.3.1).   
 
  
Page 78 of 101 
MM 27 AMD 5/03 AU G 2015 
 11.4.6. Pre-Existing Medical Conditions 
A pre-existing medical condition is one that is present at the start of the trial.  Such 
conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History CRF.  A pre-existing 
medical condition should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, severity, 
or character of the condition worsens during the trial.  When recording such events on 
an SAE Report Form and/or AE CRF, it is important to convey the concept that the pre-
existing condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672]. 
11.4.7. Pregnancy, Abortion, Birth Defects/Congenital Anomalies 
Pregnancy, abortion, birth defects, and congenital anomalies are events of special 
interest.  Please refer to Section 11.[ADDRESS_548316], and will need to be reported expeditiously 
(see Section 11.2.1): 
Pregnancy, Abortion, Birth Defects/Congenital Anomalies: 
If a patient becomes pregnant while enrolled in the trial, a Pregnancy Form (a paper 
report form, not available within EDC system) should be completed and faxed to the 
sponsor.  The sponsor should be notified expeditiously, irrespective of whether or not it 
meets the criteria for expedited reporting.  Abortions (spontaneous, accidental, or 
therapeutic) must also be reported to the Sponsor. 
Congenital anomalies/birth defects always  meet SAE criteria, and should therefore be 
expeditiously reported as an SAE, using the previously described process for SAE 
reporting.  A Pregnancy Form should also have been previously completed, and will 
need to be updated to reflect the outcome of the pregnancy. 
Trial Drug Overdose  
Symptomatic and non-symptomatic overdose must be reported in the CRF.  Any 
accidental or intentional overdose with the trial treatment that is symptomatic, even if 
not fulfilling a seriousness criterion, is to be reported to the sponsor immediately (within 
one working day) using the corresponding screens in the CRF, and following the same 
process described for SAEs (see Section 11.3). 
12. ETHICAL, FINANCIAL AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
This trial will be conducted according to the standards of Good Clinical Practice outlined 
in the ICH E6 Tripartite Guideline and CFR Title 21 part 312, applicable government 
regulations, institutional research policies and procedures and any other local applicable 
regulatory requirement(s).

advertisements), information about payments (i.e., PI [INVESTIGATOR_20971]) and compensation 
available to the patients and documentation evidencing the PI’s qualifications should be 
submitted to the IRB for ethical review and approval if  required by [CONTACT_427], 
prior to the trial start.   
The Sponsor will follow all necessary regulations to ensure appropriate, initial, and 
ongoing, IRB trial review. The Sponsor must submit and, where necessary, obtain 
approval from the IRB for all subsequent protocol amendments and changes to the 
informed consent document.  Investigators will be advised by [CONTACT_432685]-substantial and whether it 
requires submission for approval or notification only to an IRB.  
12.2. Regulatory Approval 
As required by [CONTACT_427], the Sponsor will ensure all legal aspects are covered, 
and approval of the appropriate regulatory bodies obtained, prior to trial initiation. If 
required, the Sponsor will also ensure that the implementation of substantial 
amendment to the protocol and other relevant trial documents happen only after 
approval by [CONTACT_64379]. 
Safety updates for panobinostat ([COMPANY_001]) and carfilzomib (Onyx) will be prepared by 
[CONTACT_432686], for submission to the 
relevant regulatory authority. 
12.3. Insurance and Indemnity 
Details of insurance and/or indemnity will be contained within the written agreement 
between the PI [INVESTIGATOR_95936].   
12.4. Informed Consent 
Informed consent is a process by [CONTACT_9444] a subject voluntarily confirms his or her 
willingness to participate in a particular trial, after having been informed of all aspects of 
the trial that are relevant to the subject's decision to participate.  Informed consent is 
documented by [CONTACT_3553] a written, signed and dated informed consent form. 
The informed consent form will be submitted for approval to the IRB that is responsible 
for review and approval of the trial.  Each consent form must include all of the relevant 
elements currently required by [CONTACT_1622], as well as local county authority or state 
reg
ulations. 
Before recruitment and enrollment into the trial, each prospective candidate will be 
given a full explanation of the trial.  Once the essential information has been provided to 
the prospective candidate, and the investigator is sure that the individual candidate 
 
  
Page 80 of 101 
MM 27 AMD 5/03 AU G 2015 
 understands the implications of participating in this trial, the candidate will be asked to 
give consent to participate in the trial by [CONTACT_21006].  A notation 
that written informed consent has been obtained will be made in the patient’s medical 
record.  A copy of the informed consent form, to include the patient’s signature, will be 
provided by [CONTACT_21007].   
If an amendment to the protocol substantially alters the trial design or the potential risks 
to the patients, the patient’s consent to continue participation in the trial should be 
obtained. 
12.5. Confidentiality 
12.5.1. Patient Confidentiality 
Confidentiality of patient’s personal data will be protected in accordance with  Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ( HIPPA)  require that, in order to 
participate in the trial, a patient must sign an authorization from the trial that he or she 
has been informed of following:  
 What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from patients in 
th
is trial; 
 Who will have access to that information and why; 
 Who will use or disclose that information;  
 That health information may be further disclosed by [CONTACT_1955][INVESTIGATOR_432647], and that if the information is disclosed the information may no 
longer be protected by [CONTACT_96025];  
 The information collected about the research trial will be kept separate 
f
rom the patient’s medical records, but the patient will be able to obtain the 
research records after the conclusion of the trial; 
 Whether the authorization contains an expi[INVESTIGATOR_320]; and 
 The rights of a research patient to revoke his or her authorization.  
 
In
 the event that a patient revokes authorization to collect or use his or her PHI, the 
investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the 
revocation of patient authorization.  For patients that have revoked authorization to 
collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital 
status (i.e., that the patient is alive) at the end of their scheduled trial period. 
In compliance with ICH GCP guidelines and applicable parts of [ADDRESS_548317] access to review the patient’s 
original medical records at the site for verification of trial-related procedures and data.  
Measures to protect confidentiality include: only a unique trial number and initials will 
identify patients on the CRF or other documents submitted to the Sponsor.  This 
information, together with the patient’s date of birth, will be used in the database for 
patient identification. Patient names or addresses will not be entered in the CRF or 
 
  
Page 81 of 101 
MM 27 AMD 5/03 AU G 2015 
 database. No material bearing a patient’s name [CONTACT_96044] [CONTACT_2728].  Patients 
will be informed of their rights within the ICF. 
12.5.2. Investigator and Staff Information 
Personal data of the investigators and sub-investigators may be included in the 
SCRI Innovations database, and shall be treated in compliance with all applicable laws 
and regulations.  When archiving or processing personal data pertaining to the 
investigator or sub-investigator, SCRI Innovations shall take all appropriate measures to 
safeguard and prevent access to this data by [CONTACT_171812]. 
12.6. Financial Information 
SCRI Innovations is sponsoring this study.  The pharmaceutical company [COMPANY_001] will 
provide funding to SCRI Innovations for this study, and will also provide the study drug 
panobinostat for all study participants.  Onyx Pharmaceuticals provide funding to SCRI 
Innovations for this study, and will provide carfilzomib for all study patients.  The 
physicians participating in this study will receive compensation from the SCRI Oncology 
Research Consortium. 
13. RECORD RETENTION AND DOCUMENTATION OF THE STUDY

delegated trial duties and should ensure that all persons assisting in the conduct of the 
trial are informed of their obligations. All persons authorised to make entries and/or 
corrections on the CRFs are to be included on this document. All entries in the patient’s 
CRF are to be supported by [CONTACT_64385]. 
Source documents are the original documents, data, records and certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_163503], observations and activities from which the patient’s 
CRF data are obtained. These can include, but are not limited to, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], 
clinical and office charts, laboratory, medico-technical department and pharmacy 
records, diaries, microfiches, ECG traces, copi[INVESTIGATOR_14848], photographic negatives, microfilm or 
magnetic media, X-rays, and correspondence. 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_95938] a comprehensive and centralised 
filing system (Site Trial File/SSF or ISF) of all trial-related (essential) documentation, 
suitable for inspection at any time by [CONTACT_10574]/or 
applicable regulatory authorities.  The ISF/SSF must consist of those documents that 
individually or collectively permit evaluation of the conduct of the trial and the quality of 
the data  produced.  The ISF/SSF should contain as a minimum all relevant documents 
and correspondence as outlined in ICH GCP Sectio n [ADDRESS_548320], at a minimum, should contain PI [CONTACT_2300], date drug 
shipped/received, date, quantity and batch/code, or lot number for identity of each 
shipment.  In addition, all original source documents supportin g entries in the CRF must 
be maintained and be readily available.  
The Sponsor shall maintain adequate investigational product records and financial 
interest records as per 21CFR Part 54.[ADDRESS_548321] marketing application has been approved by [CONTACT_8415]; or, in the event that the 
marketing application has not been approved by [CONTACT_8415], for no less than [ADDRESS_548322] shipment / delivery of the drug for investigational use is discontinued and FDA has 
been notified of the discontinuation.

marketing application has not been approved by [CONTACT_8415], for no less than [ADDRESS_548325] shipment / delivery of the drug for investigational use is discontinued and FDA has 
been notified of the discontinuation. 
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or from the Sponsor or 
its representative, the investigator additionally agrees to keep records, including the 
identity of all participating patients (sufficient information to link records e.g., CRFs and 
medical records), all original, signed informed consent forms, and copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], 
SAE Reporting forms, source documents, detailed records of treatment disposition, and 
related essential regulatory documents.  The documents listed above must be retained 
by [CONTACT_432689] (generally [ADDRESS_548326] 
marketing approval).  The Sponsor will notify the investigator(s)/institutions(s) when the 
trial-related records are no longer required.   
If the investigator relocates, retires, or for any reason withdraws from the trial, both the 
sponsor and its representative should be prospectively notified.  The trial records must 
be transferred to an acceptable designee, such as another investigator, another 
institution, or to sponsor.  The investigator must obtain the sponsor written permission 
before disposing of any records, even if retention requirements have been met.  All trial 
files will be maintained by [CONTACT_1034] <or its representative> throughout the trial, and 
will be transferred to the Sponsor at the conclusion of the trial. 
13.4. Data Collection 
The trial CRF is the primary data collection instrument for the trial. CRFs will be 
completed using the English language and should be kept current to enable the monitor 
to review the patients’ status throughout the course of the trial. 
In order to maintain confidentiality, only trial number, patient number, initials and date of 
birth will identify the patient in the CRF.  If the patient’s name [CONTACT_145258] (e.g. laboratory report), it must be obliterated on the copy of the document to 
be supplied to SCRI Innovations and replaced instead with the patient number and 
patient’s initials.  The investigator will maintain a personal patient identification list 
(patient numbers with corresponding patient identifiers) to enable records to be 
identified and verified as authentic. Patient data/information will be kept confidential, 
and will be managed according to applicable local, state, and federal regulations.   
13.5. Trial Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting 
The investigator will permit trial-related monitoring, quality audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_103], government regulatory authorities, the Sponsor or its representative(s) of all 
trial-related documents (e.g., source documents, regulatory documents, data collection 
instruments, case report forms).  The investigator will ensure the capability for 
inspections of applicable trial-related facilities.  The investigator will ensure that the trial 
 
  
Page 85 of 101 
MM 27 AMD 5/03 AU G 2015 
 monitor or any other compliance or QA reviewer is given access to all trial-related 
documents and trial-related facilities.   
Participation as an investigator in this trial implies the acceptance of potential inspection 
by [CONTACT_64376], the sponsor or its representative(s).  
At the Sponsor’s discretion Source Document Verification (SDV) may be performed on 
all data items or a percentage thereof.   
13.6. Quality Assurance and Quality Control 
Each trial site shall be required to have Standard Operating Procedures (SOP’s) to 
define and ensure quality assurance/control processes for trial conduct, data generation 
& collection, recording of data/documentation and reporting according to the protocol, 
GCP and any applicable local, national or international regulations. 
13.7. Disclosure and Publication Policy 
All information provided regarding the trial, as well as all information 
collected/documented during the course of the trial, will be regarded as confidential.  
The Sponsor reserves the right to release literature publications based on the results of 
the trial.  Results from the trial will be published/presented as per the Sponsor’s 
publication strategy. 
The financial disclosure information will be provided to the Sponsor prior to trial 
participation from all PIs and Sub-Investigators who are involved in the trial and named 
on the FDA 1572 form .

in 24 -hour urine M -protein by 50 -89% 
AND  
 If present at baseline, 25 -49% reduction in the size of sort 
tissue plasmacytomas is also required  
 No increase in size or number of lytic bone lesions 
(development of compression fracture doe s not exclude 
response  
aAll response categories require two consecutive assessments made at any time before the institution of any new therapy; all 
categories also require no known evidence of progressive or new bone lesions if radiographic studies were performed. Radiographic 
studies are not required to satisfy these response requirements. 
bConfirmation with repeat bone marrow biopsy not needed. 
cAt any point in this treatment, patients suspected of PD will have response assessed again to confirm disease progression (i.e. [ADDRESS_548329] 1 week apart). The outcomes will be reviewed by [CONTACT_432692]. Consensus recommendations for the uniform reporting of clinical trials:  report of the

 Appendix E: Schedule of Assessments for MM 27 Phase I Portion (continued) 
A    The physical examination, ECOG PS, CBC, CMP, PT/I NR, urinalysis, and pregnancy test should be done <7 days prior to initiation of treatment. However, if 
these initial examinations are obtained ≤[ADDRESS_548330] to be repeated.   
B Vital signs are defined as height, blood pressure, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1520], weight.   Only a t the baseline visit, height will be recorded.    
C CMP includes the following laboratory tests:  glucose, B UN, creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, CO 2, alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT, total 
bilirubin, total protein, and albumin  plus m agnesium  and phosphorus .  Uric acid and LDH  will also be collected  during Cycle 1.   Cycle 2 and beyond (and end 
of study) Uric acid and LDH will be obtained if clinically indicated.   Labs may be obtained ≤72 hours of any or all assessments.  
D Update of the medical history and physical examination should be obtained on  D1 (+/- 72 hrs) of each   cycle after Cycle [ADDRESS_548331] will be performed only for women of childbearing  potential (see Section 3.3.1). 
F     Evaluation should be performed at screening visit and repeated at investigator’s discretion, if medically indicated.  If patient is receiving warfarin or other anti -coagulant therapy, 
coagulation parameters should be m onitored as indicated.     
G On Cycle 1 Day 1,  and Cycle 1 Day 5,  three ECGs will be obtained 5 -10 minutes apart before the patient takes panobinosta t, and will be repeated (x 3 , 5-10 
minutes apart ) approximately 3 hours after the panobinostat dose is taken  orally.     
H If no problems with QTc prolongation occur during Cycle 1, a single  pre-dose  ECG on Day 1 of each subsequent cycle is required.  
I Oral hydration – (6-8 cups of liquid per day) starting [ADDRESS_548332] dose of carfilzomib ( i.e. Day -2 and Day -1, Cycle 1), and prior to all carfilzomib 
doses during Cycle 1.  In patients  considered at risk for TLS, oral hydration should be continued in Cycle 2 and beyond as required by [CONTACT_102]’s  medical 
condition and at the study doctor ’s discretion . 
J IV hydration – 250-500 mL of NS (or other IV formulation) before and after each carfilzomib dose during Cycle 1 (Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16).  I f LDH or uric 
acid is elevated at Cycle 2, Day 1, the recommended hydration should be repeated for Cycle 2.  
K     MUGA or ECHO must demonstrate LVEF> the lower limits of the institutional normal.  
L  Bone marrow should be sent for flow cytometry, cytogenetics and FISH for 1q amplification, 1p del, t(4;14), t(11;14), t(14;16) and 17p del) .  Repeat if clinically 
indicated  or only to document a CR .   
M    Repeat if abnormal at baseline .   
N   Skeletal survey need only be repeated if clinically indicated (i.e. bone pain).  
O    After patients are discontinued from the study , they will visit the study center ≤[ADDRESS_548333] dose of study drug for end -of treatment -
assessments.  
P     Patients who discontinue study treatment prior to the occurrence of disease progression will be followed every 3 months durin g years 1 and 2, every 6  months 
during years 3 -5, and annually thereafter for toxicity, disease progression, and survival.   
Q      After disease progression is documented, patients will be followed every 3 months  for survival assessme nt. 
R     UPEP requires the collection of a 24 -hour urine sample.  
S     Evaluation should be performed at screening visit and C1 as indicated to monitor for TLS. If LDH and uric acid were normal du ring Cycle 1, repeat at study 
doctor’s  discretion, if clinically appropriate from C2 to progression (e.g. patients considered still  at risk for TLS).  
T     Restaging must be done ≤ 7 days Day 1 of each cycle.

 BACKGROUND AND STUDY RATIONALE  
 
This study will be conducted in full accordance all applicable University of Pennsylvania Research Policies and Procedures and all applicable Federal and state laws and regulations including 45 CFR 46
, 
21 CFR Parts 50, 54, 56, and Good Clinical Practice : Consolidated Guidelines approved by [CONTACT_20417] (ICH).  
Narrow band ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) phototherapy is a first line standard of care treatment for psoriasis. 
While being highly preferred by [CONTACT_159635]’s  office about [ADDRESS_185418] estimates of effectiveness, or generalizability of the results to the intended treatment population
1. We hypothesize that 
NB-UVB phototherapy treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis at home will be non- inferior to office 
treatment according to outcomes that matter to patients, providers, and payers . It is possible that home 
vs. office based phototherapy will be associated with differences in tolerability (i.e., burns) in those with 
very fair skin type (i.e., type I/II) due to increased penetration of ultraviolet rays, and may be associated 
with differ ences in effectiveness in darker skin types (type V/VI) due to decreased penetration of 
ultraviolet rays.  Therefore, the study will be stratified by [CONTACT_159636]- inferiority in specific 
patient sub groups.  
1.[ADDRESS_185419] of psoriasis amounted to approximately $[ADDRESS_185420] 
commonly occurs in young adulthood but may start at any age ranging from the perinatal period to 
patients in their nineties4. Psoriasis affects  all races and ethnicities. It is slightly more common in 
Caucasians compared to African Americans; however, African Americans are reported to have more severe disease
5. Once psoriasis starts , it is a chronic, incurable, life- long disease, with durable 
spontaneous remissions being rare. Psoriasis is characterized by [CONTACT_159637], inflamed, red patches (called 
plaques), with silver adherent scale. Plaques may be painful, itch, or burn and frequently bleed resulting 
in stains to clothes and bedding. Any area of the body can be affected including the face, trunk, extremities, palms, soles, genitals, and nails. Psoriasis is not “just a skin disease”. It has profound impacts on health related quality of life that are similar to or more significant than other major disorders such as cancer, cardiovascular  disease, and depression
6, 7. Indeed, patients with psoriasis, particularly 
when disease is more extensive, have an increased risk of diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and major cardiovascular events independent of traditional risk factors, culminating in an estimated 5- year reduction 
in life expectancy
8-12.  
The cause of psoriasis is unknown. There is genetic susceptibility with 40% of patients having a positive family history
13. Over [ADDRESS_185421] commonly implicated13. Psoriasis is a prototypi[INVESTIGATOR_159608] a Th1/Th17 
inflammatory disease characterized by [CONTACT_159638], antigen presenting cells, monocytes, and neutrophils resulting in dramatic increases in epi[INVESTIGATOR_159609]
14. For example, in normal skin it takes 30 days for keratinocytes (the primary cell of the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196]) to turn over, whereas this process takes only 2- 3 days in a patient with psoriasis.  
Treatment of psoriasis includes topi[INVESTIGATOR_159610], ultraviolet light phototherapy , oral medications such as 
methotrexate, and injectable biologics15. Treatment selection is based on objective factors (extensiveness 
of disease and anatomic areas involved) and subjective factors such as symptoms and impacts on health related quality of life. When disease is more extensive, typi[INVESTIGATOR_159611] 3- 10% (moderate) or >10% 
(severe) of the body surface area, topi[INVESTIGATOR_159612]
15. It is estimated that about 20% of patients with 
[ADDRESS_185422] moderate to severe disease,  culminating in over 1.5 million people  in the [LOCATION_002]2. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_159613], psoriasis, particularly when moderate to severe, remains widely 
untreated and patients remain dissatisfied with their level of disease control16. For example, it is estimated 
that 70- 90% of patients with severe psoriasis are currently not receiving systemic or phototherapy17, 18. 
Thus, the overwhelming majority of patients with moderate to severe psoriasis in the US live for decades 
with their disease poorly controlled19.  Moreover, disparities exist in that African Americans are more likely 
to experience moderate to severe psoriasis compared to whites yet are 70% less likely to receive treatments for moderate to severe psoriasis
5, 20.  
Phototherapy is a preferred first line treatment because oral medications can result in serious organ 
damage and/or significant gastrointestinal intolerance and biologics suppress the immune system and have warnings for infections and malignancy
[ADDRESS_185423] of care23. In the 1980’s split body studies demonstrated that NB-
UVB (311 nm) was more efficacious than traditional broadband (290- 320 nm) ultraviolet B (UVB) 
phototherapy23. It is important to distinguish narrowband phototherapy, which can be delivered via 
medical devices in the home or office, from commercial tanning beds which deliver predominantly ultraviolet A radiation and are ineffective for psoriasis. Guidelines of care issued by [CONTACT_159639]-UVB phototherapy is a widely accepted, first line, standard of 
care treatment and also indicate that patients with psoriasis who are compliant, motivated, and adherent with instructions and follow -up examinations could, under dermatologist supervision, be cons idered 
appropriate candidates for home NB-UVB therapy
23. Phototherapy remains a critical therapeutic modality 
that is much more widely prescribed by [CONTACT_159640] (which are prescribed only by [CONTACT_159641] 20% of dermatologists)
24. Although phototherapy does not treat 
psoriatic arthritis (PsA), it is often used to augment response to systemic agents and the majority of patients do not have PsA
23, 25. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_159614], as 
summarized by a recent review of psoriasis treatment for UptoDate, “uncertainty regarding the safety of 
home units has led to a reluctance to prescribe them .”26 NB-UVB requires treatments three times per 
week for 12 weeks in order to achieve optimal skin clearance. Treatment may then continue on a 
maintenance basis (1- 2 times per week) or be stopped and then restarted when psoriasis recurs and is 
symptomatic enough that the patient desires another course of phototherapy27. As a result, office based 
phototherapy is highly burdensome for patients who need to take time off from work and family to receive treatment. Moreover, only about 10% of counties in the US offer office based phototherapy

with a door, and measure  21” wide, 74.5” tall, and 23.5”. The unit will have a dosimetry controller, a UV 
sensor built in that measures the intensity of the light.  This unit is a class II device with an FDA 510K 
indication for psoriasis, vitiligo and atopic dermatitis/eczema.  
1.2.[ADDRESS_185425] of care for patients with psoriasis as evidenced by [CONTACT_159642]
23. A recent systematic 
review identified nine randomized controlled trials of office -based NB-UVB phototherapy involving a total 
of 293 patients. The average response rate based on a 75% improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI  75) was 65% (95% CI 45- 79) (PASI  75 is similar clinically to being clear/almost clear 
by [CONTACT_159643])
29. Home phototherapy was introduced in the 1970’ s; however , rigoro us published studies are 
scant. There is only one controlled trial of home narrowband phototherapy versus office- based 
phototherapy (no other randomized controlled studies exist)30. The study was conducted in the 
Netherlands at [ADDRESS_185426] 4 centers. 94 patients were treated at home and 91 in the office. 41% of patients achieved a PASI75 in both groups and the authors concluded that UVB phototherapy administered at home is

31-[ADDRESS_185428] been 
2 prospective studies of office- based UVB therapy in pediatric patients with psoriasis . Twenty children 
between the ages of 6 and 14 years old were enrolled in a single- center  trial of twice weekly NB -UVB in a 
dermatology clinic in India, with 12 (60%) showing PASI 90, 3 (15%) showing PASI 70- 90, 1 (5%) 
showing PASI 50 -70, and 2 (10%) showing less than PASI 50 or worsening disease after 12 weeks35.  
The only reported adverse event was mild erythema in 2 (10%) patients . The same center also performed 
a prospective single- blinded trial comparing twice weekly NB- UVB versus NB -UVB with mineral oil 
pretreatment in a split -body design; of the 18 patients analyzed, both groups had large reductions in the 
mean modified PASI score (mean baseline score of 15.3 to scores of 0.64 and 0.14 at 12 weeks in the NB-UVB and NB -UVB m ineral oil pret reated groups, respectively)
36. 
The majority of efficacy and safety data for UVB use in pediatric psoriasis in the literature are based on retrospective reviews . In one of the largest reviews to date, 79 children with psoriasis were treated with 
NB-UVB at a s ingle institution in Israel between 1998- 2006; among them, 40 (51%) achieved complete 
clearance, 33 (41%) at least 75% improvement, and 6 (8%) less than 75% improvement . Side effects 
were minor and included 13 (15%) patients with mild erythema, 2 (1%) with i tch, and 3 (3%) with 
burning
37.  In other smaller retrospective reviews, response rates have ranged from 63- 88% of patients 
achieving clear or almost clear skin; 45- 86% of patients achieving 90% improvement in PASI or BS A; 17 -
40% of patients achieving 70- 90% improvement in PASI or BSA; 20- 22% of patients achieving 50- 70% 
improvement in PASI; and 9- 15% of patients with minimal or no improvement38-43. There have been no 
published studies of home UVB phototherapy for pediatric psoriasis ; however, home phototherapy is 
widely accepted by [CONTACT_159644] .   
1.3 Dose Rationale   
The initial dose of  NB-UVB phototherapy is based on skin type. The dose is then gradually increased as 
tolerated based on an easy to follow algorithm (see Appendix  A for examples). The initial treatment may 
only require 20 seconds of phototherapy exposure, which then may range to up to  approximately  5-10 
minutes of exposure time. The ideal dose causes mild transient pi[INVESTIGATOR_159615] < 24 hours. There are six skin types which are grouped into 3 sub- groups based on the anticipated minimal erythema 
dose response to phototherapy: Type I and II (white; very fair; red or blond hair; blue or green eyes; 
freckles, usually or always burns, never tans or tans with difficulty), Type III and IV (cream white to olive 
brown skin, sometimes to rarely burns, gradually tans or t ans with ease), Type V and VI (dark brown, 
black, very rarely or never burns, tans very easily). We will therefore pre- specify three groups for analysis 
(type I/II, type III/IV, and type V/VI). It is possible that home vs. office based phototherapy will be 
associated with differences in tolerability (i.e., burns) in those with very fair skin type (i.e., type I/II) due to 
increased penetration of ultraviolet rays, and may be associated with differences in effectiveness in 
darker skin types (type V/VI) due to decreased penetration of ultraviolet rays.  An example of the dosing 
regimen can be found in the A ppendix  A. 
2 Study Objectives  
2.1 Primary Objective  
To compare the effectiveness, safety (tolerability), and duration of treatment response at [ADDRESS_185429] of phototherapy delivered at home or in the office on:  
• Body surface area  (BSA)  affected by [CONTACT_159645] (BSAxPGA)  
• Phototherapy number and dose  
7 
 • Concomitant  topi[INVESTIGATOR_159606]  
• Concomitant oral or biologic psoriasis treatment  
• Patient reported time spent on phototherapy  
• Patient reported time and cost  associated with travel   
• Duration of treatment response during observation period  
[ADDRESS_185430] of care 
and thus this would be classified as a Phase IV study. Dosing of phototherapy will be based on a standardized protocol ( see APPENDIX  A) or a standard protocol that is routinely used by [CONTACT_159646]. The study will include up to 1050 patients stratified 
by [CONTACT_159633] ( 350 skin type I/II, 350 skin type III/IV, we anticipate that approximately 80 
participants will be enrolled in  Skin type V/VI). We hypothesize that home phototherapy will be non-
inferior to office based phototherapy. There will be a recommended screening period of up to 28 days, to 
allow for obtaining informed consent and administrative procedures necessary for office based or home phototherapy , as well as  randomization . Patients will b e randomized (1:1) to home vs . office -based 
phototherapy  within [ADDRESS_185431] (or PA or NP or other qualified clinician  as appropriate to the clinical practice) at baseline 
and at 12 (plus or minus 2) weeks  after start of phototherapy , or at the time of discontinuation of 
photot herapy, whichever comes first . Patients will receive phototherapy treatments  about 3 times per 
week for 12 weeks. They will then be observed for an additional 12 weeks.  With each phototherapy 
treatment, patient response to prior phototherapy treatment will be collected by [CONTACT_159647] . Patients will complete a survey every 4 weeks for the 
duration of the study that captures patient reported outcomes.    
3.1.1  Screening Phase  
Patients will be recruited from the sites’ clinical practice. Patients being considered for phototherapy will 
be offered the opportunity to participate in this study at the discretion of the clinician. Electronic consent 
will be obtained before any study specific procedures are conducted. Electronic assent will be obtained from children eligible to participate and written consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_159648].  Consent  and assent can be obtained remotely or in person.   
 The screening phase begins at the time of obtaining informed consent and continues until  the patient is  
randomized (up to a total of [ADDRESS_185432] of care).  The length of 
time between screening and randomization will be allowed to vary based on local practice standard of care as this is a pragmatic trial and thus we aim to reflect usual clinical practice. In usual practice, clinicians vary on the duration of time between when they evaluate a patient and when the patient actually 
starts phototherapy. This period can be delayed due to administrative issues (i.e., obtaining insurance approvals, etc), availability of phototherapy appointments, and patient schedule issues . The baseline visit 
will occur during the screening phase.  Information collected at the baseline visit will be collected again if 
the patient sees the local provider again for routine care prior to randomization.  The site will confirm that 
the patient is eligible for randomization by [CONTACT_159649]  (such as 
required co- pays or other cost sharing agreement ). Patient s are then randomized, and should receive 
their first treatment within [ADDRESS_185433] treatment  (or [ADDRESS_185434])  and continue for 84 days. Patients 
will be evaluated by [CONTACT_159650] (during the baseline visit)  and at the 
conclusion of phototherapy treatment or by [CONTACT_4475] 84 (plus or minus 14 days), whichever comes first.  
3.1.[ADDRESS_185435] treatment is received (or [ADDRESS_185436]) by [CONTACT_159651] 84 days.    
3.1.4  Allocation to Interventional Group  
Randomization will be implemented using randomly permuted blocks of size two or four, stratified on clinic 
and skin type. This will maximize blinding of investigators  to the randomization schema and achieve 
balanced groups  within study sites and skin types.  A randomization table will be created by [CONTACT_159652] (“app”) by [CONTACT_159653] (CRCU) . The app will be loaded on iPads used to collect data by [CONTACT_81564]. When a new patient is enrolled in the study, the app will generate a new patient id and provide a 
treatment assignment. The master list of patient ids and treatment assignments will be stored 
electronically a t the CRCU.  Data analysts will be blinded as to group assignment by [CONTACT_159654].  
  
3.[ADDRESS_185437] primary effectiveness outcome is treatment response, a dichotomous indicator of whether a 
patient has achieved clear/almost clear skin (score of 0 or 1), based on the Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA ) at the earlier of week 12 or discontinuation of phototherapy . See Appendix B for PGA  
tool.   
 The second co- primary outcome is the patient -reported Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)  at week 
12. We will dichotomize DLQI at a score of 0-5 (corresponding to no to small impact on quality of life) 
versus a score ≥ 6
44. 
 
3.2.2  Secondary Study Endpoints  
• DLQI score of ≤1 (no impact on HrQOL)  
• Achievement of a Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) on the DLQI    
• Concomitant  topi[INVESTIGATOR_159606]  
• Concomitant oral and biologic psoriasis treatment  
• Patient reported time spent on phototherapy  
• Patient reported time and cost associated with travel for phototherapy treatments  
• Change in the product of BSA times PGA relative to baseline (BSAxPGA) . See Appendix B for 
BSA tool.  
• Duration of treatment response during observation period  
• Phototherapy  number and dose  
9 
 3.2.3  Primary Safety Endpoints  
The primary safety outcome is the proportion of patients reporting treatment -emergent adverse events. 
Adverse events include patient reported burns and their severity.  Patients will be queried about these 
events immediately prior to each phototherapy treatment by [CONTACT_49885] (for patients assigned to 
office base phototherapy) or by [CONTACT_159655]. We will also evaluate all serious 
adverse events regardless of their relationship to treatment. All patients will be queried about SAEs by [CONTACT_159656] 2. Patients can spontaneously report SAEs at any point during the study.

5 Study Intervention  
5.1 Description 
The comparator devices are the Daavlin 7 series 3 panel narrow band phototherapy home units ( with 8-
12 bulbs and a smaller, flat surface with door, measuring 21” wide, 74.5” tall, and 23.5” ). This unit is a 
class II device with a FDA 510K indication for psoriasis, vitiligo and atopic dermatitis/eczema.  The unit will 
have a dosimetery controller, a UV sensor built in that measures the intensity of the light.   This sensor will 
adjust the treatment time to compensate for  any variation in output due to aging of the lamps or other 
factors.   
 
The reference device is office based narrow band phototherapy (units typi[INVESTIGATOR_159605] 24 bulbs in a 
surround structure) . 
5.2 Intervention Regimen  
Starting dose will be based on Fitzp atrick skin type (as ascertained by [CONTACT_159658] ) and will 
increase based on the patient ’s response to the treatment. The clinicians will be allowed flexibility in 
deviating from this regimen based on their local practice. See Appendix  A for example  standardized 
protocol . 
 
5.[ADDRESS_185441] wear protective eyewear during the treatment and ensure 
that other family members or pets are not exposed to incidental ultraviolet radiation from the device.  
5.5 Preparation and Packaging  
The home phototherapy  device will be shipped to the patient in a re- usable shippi[INVESTIGATOR_159617] 80” x 23” x 16” . It will be packed at the manufacturer’s facility in Bryan, Ohio. 
[ADDRESS_185442] the number of treatments a 
participant can receive based on a unique PIN system. At the conclusion of the LITE Study or upon a 
participant’s withdrawal from the LITE Study, whichever first occurs, at the direction of the PI, Daavlin will 
provide home participants with a prepaid shippi[INVESTIGATOR_159618]. The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_159619].   
5.[ADDRESS_185443] 
The investigational device will be returned to the manufacturer upon the patient’s completion of their treatment regimen and at the direction of the investigators . The device manufacturer will call the patient to 
provide instruction and answer any questions as to how to re- pack the device, affix the shippi[INVESTIGATOR_159620] .

 Study Evaluations and Measurements  
The data collected in this study are all considered relevant  for routine clinical care. In routine clinical care, 
there is some variation in which assessments are conducted and thus we will standardize assessments for the purpose of the study.    
 
Investigator reported measures:  
 1. Physicians Global assessment  (PGA):  This is a three item measure that asks the physician or his or 
her designee to assess the thickness, redness, and scale of psoriasis plaques.  
2. Body Surface Area (BSA) : This is a measure that asks the physician or his or her designee to assess 
the body surface area affected by [CONTACT_159660] 1% of the body surface area.  To do this, the patient’s handprint, including the entire 
area of the palm and all 5 digits with the fingers close together but not overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] , is used as a guide to 
estimate 1% of the BSA  
3. Number of phototherapy treatments and dose received: This data is routinely collected in cli nical 
practice. It will be reported by [CONTACT_159661]  
4. Copay for office- based phototherapy  
5. Concomitant treatment  
 
Patient reported measures:  
 1. Dermatology Life Quality Index : (DLQI): DLQI is a 10 item survey that asks patients questions about 
their health related quality of life on a 0- 3 scale. DLQI is routinely used in clinical trials of psoriasis 
treatments and can also be used routin ely in clinical practice.  
14 
 2. Patient reported response to phototherapy : This is a standard question asked to the patient to 
document the degree and duration of erythema induced by [CONTACT_159662]. It is 
standard of care.  
3. Patient reported time spent on travel, cost of travel, and time spent on phototherapy  
4. Patient reported concomitant psoriasis  topi[INVESTIGATOR_71831]  
5. Photograph of target psoriasis lesion  (at a subset of study sites)  
 
7.[ADDRESS_185446] (source document) as part 
of routine documentation. Some data may be abstracted from the medical record or documented as part 
of completing the electronic case report forms (CRF ) for the study. Below are examples of some variables 
which may already be present in the medical record.  
 
• Demographics (y ear, date  of birth, sex, marital status, education, employment status, annual 
household income, insurance type, race, ethnicity)  
• Height 
• Weight  
• PGA, BSA  
• Prior and concomitant psoriasis treatment  
• Psoriasis date of onset  
• Psoriatic arthritis presence and date of onset if present  
• Major medical comorbidity  
• Family history of psoriasis   
• Fitzpatrick skin type  (description of skin and eye color and skin’s reaction to sunlight) 
• Psoriasis response to sunlight  
• Smoking history  
• Alcohol history  
 
7.2 Physical Examination  
A complete examination of the skin will be conducted at visit 1 and 2 as well as at any unscheduled visits  
if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_8130]’s  clinician . A physician global assessment and body surface area 
affected by [CONTACT_159663].  
7.3 Vital Signs  
Vital signs may or may not be taken as part of routine evaluation but will not be collected by [CONTACT_941] s tudy.   
7.4 Other Evaluations, Measures  
All evaluations are described above and in cluded on the schedule of events , see Appendix D.  
.  
7.5 Effectiveness Evaluations  
Measurements of effectiveness include PGA, BSA, and the DLQI.  
 
7.6 Safety Evaluations  
Safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_159664] .  
 
Patients will be queried about the reaction to phototherapy (i.e., burns) immediately prior to each 
phototherapy treatment  as is standard practice. Patients will contact [CONTACT_159665] (a burn which requires medical attention such as one associated with significant 
pain that interrupts usual activities or skin blistering) . Patients will be queried about SAE’s at visit 2 . 
Patients can spontaneously report SAEs at any point during the study.

 8 Statistical Plan  
8.1 Primary Endpoint  
Primary analyses will be based on the intent to treat (ITT) population defined as all patients meeting 
eligibility requirements who are randomized to one of the two study arms. In the ITT population, we will compare the two treatment arms with respect to two primary effectiveness outcomes. The first primary effectiveness outcome is treatment response, a dichotomous indicator of whether a patient has achieved clear/almost clear skin (score of 0 or 1), based on the Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA) at the earlier of week 12 (visit 2) , defined as the twelfth week after the start of treatment, or the time of discontinuation 
of phototherapy. In our primary analyses, patients who drop out of the study prior to achieving clear/almost clear skin or week 12, whichever comes first, will be classified as treatment failures (i.e., failure to achieve clear/almost clear skin). The second primary outcome is the patient -reported 
Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) assessed at week 12. We will dichotomize DLQI at a score of 0- 5 
(corresponding to no to small impact on quality of life) versus a score >5. Patients failing to complete the week [ADDRESS_185447] DLQI >5 and therefore classified as a non- responder 
on this measure.  
 We hypothesize that effectiveness of home- based UVB phototherapy will not be inferior to that of office-
based phototherapy on either of the two primary effectiveness outcomes.  At the conclusion of the trial we 
will report the response rate, i.e. the proportion of patients achieving clear/almost clear skin on the PGA at 
the earlier of 12 weeks after initiating home or office- based phototherapy  or discontinuation of phototherapy  
and the proportion of patients with no to small impairment on quality of life (DLQI 0- 5) at week 12 for each 
treatment arm with 95% confidence intervals.   These measures will be reported for the complete study 
cohort and separately for two of the three skin type sub- groups. We will not be able to test the hypothesis 
of non- inferiority of home vs.  office treatment in skin type V/VI . We will accumulate additional data in this 
group which will improve the precision of our estimates of efficacy in this patient p opulation as well as gather 
additional data about barriers patients with skin type 5/6 face in accessing home or office base phototherapy that lead to inequities and health disparities in patients with psoriasis.  
To account for stratification by [CONTACT_159666], which induces non- independence across strata, pooled analyses 
will be conducted using logistic regression adjusted for treatment arm and skin type. Skin- type adjusted risk 
differences between home and office- based phototherapy will be computed from odds ratios using marginal 
standardization. Statistical inference will be based on adjusted risk differences according to non- inferiority 
principles. Home- based phototherapy will be determined to be non- inferior relative to office based 
phototherapy if the lower bound of the adjusted two- sided 95% confidence interval for the risk difference is 
greater than the pre- specified non- inferiority margin of 15%.   
 
8.2 Secondary Endpoints  
In addition to pooled analyses described above, separate analyses will be conducted for each skin type 
using a non- inferiority margin of 15%. The estimated risk difference in dichotomized DLQI at week [ADDRESS_185448] (HTE) across the three skin types using logistic regression.  In this analysis, we will fit models for 
each of the two primary outcomes with skin type, treatment arm, and their interaction as predictors. HTE 
will be assessed using an omnibus Wald test of all interaction regression parameters for each outcome of 
interest in order to minimize multiple testing and consequent alpha inflation.  
In secondary analyses , we will investigate additional outcomes:  
• Total number of phototherapy treatments received  
• Cumulative dose of phototherapy  
• Frequency of topi[INVESTIGATOR_159621]  
• Changes in initiation, dosing, or discontinuation of oral or biologic psoriasis treatments  
• Patient -reported amount of time spent on phototherapy  
• Patient reported travel  (cost and time)  
• DLQI score of ≤1at week 12 
16 
 • MCID on DLQI at week 1245 
• Physician reported change in the product of body surface area (BSA) times PGA  (both as a 
continuous measure and as a dichotomous measure evaluating a 75% and 90% reduction in the 
BSAxPGA) .  
• Duration of treatment response 
• Percentage of patients receiving ≥ 80% of assigned treatments  
 
Because we have no a priori hypothesis of equivalence between treatment arms on these outcomes, these analyses will be conducted using standard hypothesis testing principles. We will report the mean (for continuous measures) or frequency (for binary measures) and 95% CIs for each measure within 
treatment arms as well as the difference in means  or frequencies  between treatment arms and the 95% 
CI of the difference. Secondary outcomes  will be measured with a frequency as described in Appendix D, 
Schedule of  Study Procedures . We will analyze these measures using linear or logistic regression models 
with robust variance estimators via Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) to account for within- patient 
correlation that occurs with repeated measures. Regression models will include terms for treatment arm, 
time since randomization (categorical), skin type, and the treatment arm/time interaction. Inclusion of the 
interaction term will allow us to assess possible variation in effectiveness of home phototherapy relative to 
office -based phototherapy over time.   Physician reported outcomes (PGA times BSA) will be measured at 
baseline and at the earlier of week [ADDRESS_185449] of DLQI > 5  or time of initiation of a new 
systemic treatment or dose escalation of an existing systemic treatment, with patients who maintain DLQI 
≤ [ADDRESS_185450] pre- specified two primary effectiveness outcomes 
and assume a type I error rate for each outcome at the one- sided alpha = 2.5% level which is standard for 
a non- inferiority trial and analogous to the more familiar two- sided alpha = 0.05.   Although this alpha level 
does not explicitly account for multiple comparisons, we believe that doing so would be unnecessarily 
conservative as both our patient -report ed and physician- reported outcome measures assess the same 
outcome and are expected to be very highly correlated
46. Assuming a 50% response rate in both the 
office based phototherapy group and the home- based group and a non- inferiority margin of 15% (i.e. the 
95% two- sided confidence interval on the difference in response rates between office and home- based 
groups excludes 15%), we calculated that [ADDRESS_185451] 80% power to establish non- inferiority of home based phototherapy at a one-
sided significance level of 2.5%. In the pooled sample, we will have 99% power for a non- inferiority 
17 
 margin of 15%. Our non- inferiority margin has been iterated with our patient research partners and expert 
dermatologists. It is well within previous suggestions of non- inferiority for psoriasis treatments47. We also 
note that the FDA accepts a 15%  margin or greater for the study of biosimilars of biologics for moderate 
to severe psoriasis48, 49. Additionally, our estimates are more conservative (i.e., require a larger sampl e 
size) than the non- inferiority margin specified in  the pragmatic trial of home versus office based 
phototherapy conducted in the Netherlands which only required [ADDRESS_185452] set 
a higher bar for effectiveness. Based on preliminary data, the rate of DLQI ≤[ADDRESS_185453] clear skin, providing 80% power for the same non- inferiority 
margin for this outcome15. 
8.[ADDRESS_185454] deviations. Categorical variables will be 
summarized using counts and proportions. Summary statistics will be generated for the full study cohort 
as well as stratified by [CONTACT_2939], skin type, and the combination of treatment arm and skin type. Imbalance in covariates between the home and office based phototherapy arms will be described by [CONTACT_159667] 95% confidence intervals . 
8.4.2  Efficacy Analysis  
The primary efficacy endpoint is both physician reported (the physician global assessment) and patient 
reported (DLQI) The efficacy analysis  approach is detailed in section 8.1 and 8.2. 
 
8.4.3  Safety Analysis  
The primary safety outcome is the proportion of patients reporting treatment -emergent adverse events. 
Adverse events include patient reported burns and their severity. We hypothesize that safety of home 
based UVB phototherapy will not be different from office based phototherapy. We anticipate based on 
extensive experience, that the number of clinically significant burns (i.e., which may require the patient to seek advice from the treating physician and occur due to human error) will be rare (affecting <1% of patients) and typi[INVESTIGATOR_159622].    
 As ultraviolet light does not have adverse effects beyond the skin, our stakeholders believe that safety 
asse ssments should focus on skin related events such as burns and serious adverse events . We will 
summarize the number, severity, and type of adverse events experienced by [CONTACT_159668]. We will compute the proportion of patients experiencing adverse events by [CONTACT_2939], with 95% CI. Similar to analyses for our effectiveness outcomes, we will also fit skin type- adjusted logistic 
regression models and use standardization to estimate adjusted risk differences between treatment arms. In addition to pooled safety analyses, we will also compare the proportion of patients experiencing 
adverse events between office- based and home- based phototherapy arms within each skin type sub-
group  
8.4.[ADDRESS_185455] an “as treated” analysis in order 
to evaluate those who completed the study and received at least 80% of treatments. We will evaluate the 
effects of indirect costs (i.e., co- pays), treatment center, season, geography, and psor iasis characteristics 
(such as plaque thickness) on response rate. Additional exploratory analysis will be conducted by [CONTACT_159669] (these will be designated post hoc). Exploratory and post hoc analyses will be interpreted with caution and taking into consideration the total number of post hoc comparisons that have been conducted. 
18 
 8.4.5  Missing Data Strategy  
Our analysis strategy for the primary outcome of clear/almost clear skin and the patient reported DLQI (no 
impact on quality of life) uses an ITT strategy by [CONTACT_159670] s who discontinue treatment prior to 
achieving clear/almost clear skin as treatment failures. Thus, for these outcomes there will be no missing 
data. For secondary and exploratory analyses of longitudinal outcome measures that require data from 
follow -up assessments, such as dosing of phototherapy, frequency of concomitant psoriasis treatment, 
and amount of time spent on treatment, our analysis strategy  incorporates all available baseline and 
longitudinal information. The GEE estimator  is only unbiased if data are missing completely at random 
(MCAR). If the total proportion of observations with missing data in a given analysis exceeds 10%, we will  
addres s loss of efficiency due to missing data and possible bias arising from violation of the assumption 
of MCAR missingness by [CONTACT_159671] (MI) implemented using multiple imputation via 
chained equations (MICE) . Using MICE, we will create [ADDRESS_185456] additional sensitivity analyses to explore the sensitivity of our results to possible missing 
not at random  missingness. We will use the “tippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]- point” approach to identify combinations of values for 
missing measures  that would change the conclusion of our study and will summarize the results using 
graphical displays . 
8.[ADDRESS_185457] Population(s) for Analysis  
The primary analysis will be based on all subjects randomized into the study, regardless of whether t hey 
received the assigned treatment. We will also conduct an “as treated” analysis in order to evaluate those 
who completed the study and received at least 80% of treatments   
 
[ADDRESS_185458] the front-line responsibility of reviewing patient -reported 
response to phototherapy, identifying and documenting treatment emergent adverse events, and adjusting phototherapy dosing accordingly . The Sponsor/Study Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_159623], if required, to the IRBs and other investigators. For this 
pragmatic study, where intervention is standard of care and performed by [CONTACT_102]’s clinician or the patient themselves (in the case of home treatment), AE’s not related to phototherapy are not required to 
be recorded or followed by [CONTACT_4676] ’s clinician and will not be recorded for study purposes.    
.  
9.1 Definitions  
9.1.1  Adverse Event  
 
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or  worsens in severity 
during the course of the study.  For the purpose of this pragmatic trial, for which the intervention occurs 
during standard of care visits, we will only record and collect data on adverse events that are specifically 
related to phototherapy treatment, except for serious adverse events which will be collected regardless of relationship to phototherapy . 
 
9.1.2  Serious Adverse Event  
 
Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non- serious.   A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
19 
 • results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major 
clinical significance . They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the 
other serious outcomes noted above. For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result 
in in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_159624].  
 All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as  non-serious 
adverse events.   
 
9.[ADDRESS_185459] of care treatments, home and 
office -based phototherapy . All treatments will be administered and monitored by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical care 
provider  (dermatologist) and designated staff (typi[INVESTIGATOR_159625]) . Recording of reported 
adverse events will be completed by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical care provider (s) prior to the administration of 
each treatment (3 times per week) and the clinical course of each event will be followed until resolution, 
stabilization, or until it is determined that phototherapy is not the cause. Adverse events will be 
documented in the patient’s medical record by [CONTACT_159672](s) throughout the 12 week 
intervention period and the subsequent 12 week observation period per local practice or medical center 
requirements . Only phototherapy -emergent adverse events will be abstracted from medical records 
and/or home phototherapy equipment and recorded for study objective purposes . 
 Serious adverse events will be recorded and monitored by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical care provider(s), per 
standard of care pract ices, and will also be recorded, tracked, and reported by [CONTACT_159673] [ADDRESS_185460] conform to the serious adverse event 
reporting timelines, formats and requirements of the various entities to which they are responsible. If the 
report is supplied as a narrative, the minimum necessary information to be provided at the time of the initial report includes:  
• Study identifier  
• Study center  
• Subject number  
• A description of the event  
• Date of onset  • Current status  
• Whether study intervention was discontinued  
• The reason why the event is classified as serious  
• Investigator assessment of the association between the event and study intervention  
 
 
9.4.1  Follow -up report 
SAEs that are ongoing at the time of initial report will be followed until resolution by [CONTACT_159674] a follow up report documenting final outcome. If new information arises that changes the 
20 
 investigator’s assessment of a SAE, a follow -up report including all relevant new or reassessed 
information (e.g., concomitant medication, medical history) should be submitted to the various entities  to 
which they are responsible.  
 
9.4.2  Investigator reporting: notifying the study sponsor  
Any study -related unanticipated problem posing risk to subjects or others, and any type of serious 
adverse event, will be reported to the study sponsor by [CONTACT_16470] 24 hours of the event. Report 
serious adverse events by [CONTACT_159675]:

Within the following 48 hours, the local site investigator will document and provide further information, if 
available,  on the serious adverse event or the unanticipated problem in the form of a written narrative 
report .  Significant new information on ongoing serious  adverse events should be provided promptly to 
the study sponsor.  The local site investigator will keep a copy of the  SAE report  on file at the study site.  
9.4.3  Investigator Reporting: Notifying the Penn IRB  
As adverse events will be reported, record ed, and followed per standard of care practices for patients 
receiving office- based and home phototherapy, study sites will not be required to report AEs to Penn.  Any 
SAE or study -related unanticipated problem posing risk to the subject or others, will be reported to the 
Penn IRB, per Penn IRB requirement and timelines ( http://www.upenn.edu/IRB/mission- institutional -
review -board- irb/reportable -events ), as a written report of the event, including description per Section 
12.4.2 above and need for revision to consent form or other study documentation).   Copi[INVESTIGATOR_159626]’s regulator binder .   
9.4.4  Sponsor reporting: Notifying participating investigators  
Investigators,  who are not Penn faculty and not relying on Penn IRB for regulatory review, are responsible 
for safety reporting to their local IRB. Investigators are responsible for complying with their local IRB’s 
reporting requirements, Copi[INVESTIGATOR_159627]’s study file.    
9.5 Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the Site Investigator to oversee the safety  of the study at his/her site. This safety 
monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted above. The local  clinical team (such as phototherapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], medical assistants, etc.) will monitor patient safety as is 
routine in clinical practice.  
9.5.1  Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
The Data and Safety Monitoring Plan will be maintained by [CONTACT_26848]  ([CONTACT_159681]).  
The DSMP  describes approaches to ensuring complete and accurate data through ongoing monitoring of 
site data and additional monitoring as needed for sites not achieving pre- specified data quality metrics  
(Appendix  F).    
[ADDRESS_185461] of 1996 (HIPAA) . Those regulations require a 
signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why 
21 
 • Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], 
retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization. For 
subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain 
permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.  
10.2 Data Collection and Management  
Patients will complete an electronic consent  and HIPAA  form and data will be collected via an app 
developed using Medable software. The app will reside on a tablet device at each site (for site entered 
data) and on the patient’s  smart phone (a smart phone will be provided for the purposes of the study to 
patients who do not have one) . Data will be encrypted and housed on a cloud- based server operated by 
[CONTACT_159676] 21 CFR Part 11, HIPAA and international privacy  
regulations and laws. Personally identifiable information (PII) and protected health information (PHI) will 
be housed in the app’s account record which is separate from the study database (task and step responses from electronic case report forms (eCRFs)). Access to data collected via the app is  only 
granted to the researchers who create the App and if other researchers would like to access the data, only the aforementioned App creators may grant this through user authentication. Authentication is available through session- based, signature- based, and single -factor authentication. Access to data, once 
authenticated, is managed via fine- grained access control lists. The research team may securely 
download and transfer data from Medable.   PII and PHI will not be available to access with standard 
tools of data exports.  PII and PHI will only be accessible to research team members with administrator roles and assignments of scripts to pull the select PII and/or PHI as needed.   
 All participants will receive a random identification num ber that will be used to identify  participants’ data.   No 
direct identifiers will be used.   
10.2.1  Source Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.   Source data are contained in 
source documents . Examples of these original documents, and data records include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], 
clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, 
pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_19093], microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, subjec t files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at 
medico- technical departments involved in the clinical trial.  
10.2.2  Case Report Forms (CRFs)  
The study electronic case report form ( eCRF) on the Medable app is the primary data collection 
instrument for the study . All data requested on the eCRFs must be recorded . All missing data must be 
explained.   If a space on the eCRF is left blank because the procedure was not done or the question was 
not asked, validation rules will trigger a flag and require entry to cite reason. If the item is not applicable to 
the individual case, the item will not be viewable to on the eCRF for that participant .   
10.3 Records Retention  
As required by [CONTACT_159677], it is the investigator’s responsibility to retain study essential 
documents for 3 years after the final study results are presented in a public forum.     
 
22 
 11 Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting  
11.1 Study Monitoring Plan  
The study will be monitored according to the Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  (Appendix F).  
11.2 Auditing and Inspecting  
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_1383]/IRB, the funding 
source, PCORI, government regulatory bodies, and University compliance and quality assurance groups 
of all study related documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, data collection 
instruments, study data etc.).  
 Participation as an investigator in this stud y implies acceptance of potential inspection by [CONTACT_28832].  
 
12 Ethical Considerations  
This study is to be conducted in accordance with applicable US government regulati ons and international 
standards of Good Clinical Practice, and applicable institutional research policies and procedures.  
 
This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to a properly constituted independent Ethics Committee (EC) or Institutional Review Board (IRB), in agreement with local legal prescriptions, for formal approval of the study conduct . The decision of the EC/IRB concerning the conduct of the study will be 
made in writing to the investigator and a copy of this decision will be provided to the sponsor before 
commencement of this study.  
12.[ADDRESS_185462] compensation for completing study questionnaires and a 50% chance of receiving home phototherapy for [ADDRESS_185463] compensation and 50% will benefit by [CONTACT_159678].  
12.4 Informed Consent Process / HIPAA Authorization  
All participants , or legally authorized representatives, must sign an electronic  informed consent form for 
participation in this study prior to screening or performing any screening procedures . Participants will be 
informed that their participation in this study is voluntary and does not affect their usual  clinical care. 
Subjects will be given appropriate time after the informed consent discussion to decide on their 
participation in the study.  Study staff will obtain consent at Visit [ADDRESS_185464] is capable of doing so, he/she should indicate assent by [CONTACT_159679] a separate assent form.  In determining whether participants are capable of 
assenting, the investigator shall  take into account the age, maturity, and psychological state of the subject 
[ADDRESS_185465] sign an electronic  informed consent form. Electronic 
assent and informed consent will be obtained in accordance with the provisions of Subpart D, 45 CRF 46. 
The process of obtaining informed consent should be documented by [CONTACT_159680].  
 
 Electronic informed consent  and HIPAA  and assent  forms  will be collected via an app developed using 
Medable software   The app will reside on a tablet device at each site . The signed consents  will be 
encrypted and housed on a cloud- based server  operated by [CONTACT_159676] 
21 CFR Part 11, HIPAA and international privacy  regulations and law s. Consents obtained remotely will 
be done through RECap. A secure linkto the appropriat e consents/HIPAA documents will be emailed to 
the participant. Study staff will set up a time to review the ICF /HIPAA  remotely via telephone or video 
call, and answer any questions the participant may have. Once the consent is signed and confirmed, the 
consent document will be saved as a PDF in R EDCap’s file repository. The patient can download a copy 
of their PDF after signing Access to the signed ICF  and HIPAA s via fine -grained access control lists  will 
be granted to the research staff.

Title of Protocol: 
A Phase 2, Randomized, Double -blind, Placebo -Controlled 
Study to Evaluate Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy of 
TAK -079 in Patients With Persistent/Chronic Primary 
Immune ThrombocytopeniaEudraCT No.: 2019 -004103 -12
Study Number: TAK -079-1004 Phase: 2
Study Design:
This is a randomized double -blind, placebo -controlled, phase 2 study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and 
efficacy of TAK -079 in patients with persistent/chronic primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). This study is 
organized in 2 parts, Part A and Part B.
Part A
In Part A, patients are randomized to 1 of 3 study arms (including placebo) for a double -blind 8-week dosing period 
and 8-week blinded safety follow -up period (SFP). 
Arm A1: Matching placebo added to stable background therapy (n = 8 - 12 patients)
Arm A2: TAK -079 100 mg added to stable background therapy (n = 8 -12 patients).
Arm A3: TAK -079 300 mg added to stable background therapy (n = 8 -12 patients)
Safety assessments, including safety laboratory tests, will be performed each week before subsequent dosing. Patients 
may have study drug (TAK -079 or matching placebo) doses modified (eg, withheld or delayed) for safety reasons. 
Platelet levels will be assessed on Day 3 of Week 1 ([ADDRESS_947231] dose) and on each weekly visit, be fore 
administration of the subsequent doses.
After an 8 -week dosing period, patients will be followed for an 8 -week blinded SFP. At the completion of SFP, study 
dosing will be unblinded and patients who were dosed with TAK -079, will continue to a 16 -week l ong-term follow -up 
period (LFP) for continued observation of safety and efficacy. Those patients previously randomized to placebo will 
have the option to continue on to LFP or continue on to the open -
label extension (OLE) phase.
Part A Open -label Extension
Additional laboratory evaluations and assessments will be performed at the Week [ADDRESS_947232] dosing day in Part A open -label extension 
(OLE -A) phase (on Extension Week 1 [EW1 ]) is to occur less than 4 weeks after the Week 16 visit.
In OLE -A, patients will be randomly assigned to 1 of the following study arms:
Arm A1- E1: TAK -[ADDRESS_947233] background therapy.
Arm A1- E2: TAK -[ADDRESS_947234] background therapy.
Patients in Arms A1 -E1 and A1 -E2 will proceed through the 8 -month protocol in an open -label fashion (2 months of 
open -label dosing, 2 months of open -label SFP, and 4 months of LFP).
Part B
Part B enrollment wil l not be initiated until a decision to continue on to Part B is determined based on an unblinded 
safety data review after a minimum of 24 patients (8 patients per arm) exit the dosing period with a minimum of 4 
study doses. 
In Part B, a minimum of 12 and up to approximately 18 eligible patients will be randomized after screening in a 
double -blind 1:2 ratio to 1 of the following treatment groups:
Arm B1: Matching placebo added to stable, standard background therapy (n = 4 -6).

CONFIDENTIALArm B2: TAK -[ADDRESS_947235] background therapy (n = 8 -12).
Similar to Part A, safety assessments, including safety laboratory tests, will be performed each week before 
subsequent dosing. Patients may have study drug (TAK -079 or matching placebo) doses modified ( eg, withheld or 
delayed) for safety reasons. Platelet levels will be assessed on Day 3 of Week 1 ([ADDRESS_947236] dose) and on each 
weekly visit, before administration of the subsequent doses.
After an [ADDRESS_947237] the optio n to continue 
on to LFP or continue on to the OLE.
Part B Open -label Extension
Additional laboratory evaluations and assessments will be performed at the Week 16 visit (at the end of Part B) to 
ensure all OLE eligibility criteria are met for those patients continuing on to OLE. The first dosing day in Part B 
open -label extension (OLE -B) phase (on EW1) is to occur less than [ADDRESS_947238] backgroun d therapy (Arm B1-E). 
Patients in Arms B1 -E will proceed through the 8 -month pro tocol in an open -label fashion (2 months of open -label 
dosing, 2 months of open -label SFP, and 4 months of LFP).
Note: At any point in the study, patients may receive rescue t herapy, defined as additional dosing of concomitant 
medications, administered in accordance with institutional practices or the physician’s best medical judgment, to 
control and manage ITP. Patients who receive rescue therapy during the dosing period will stop study treatment and 
enter the SFP, unless the patient is administered a specific dosing period –permitted rescue treatment as defined in 
Section 8.2.5 .
 Additiona l assessments and evaluations may be performed as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_697883].

excluded on the basis of positive hepatitis C antibody alone.
18.Has a history of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions to recombinant proteins or excipi[INVESTIGATOR_4018] -079/placebo formulation.
Main Criteria for Evaluation and Analyses:
The primary endpoint is the percentage of patients with treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) includin g Grade 
3 or higher events, serious adverse events, and adverse events (AEs) leading to TAK -079 discontinuation. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints assess the effects of TAK -079 administration on the changes in platelet count, 
through the following 4 endpoi nts:
1.Percentage of patients with a platelet response. Platelet response is defined as a platelet count ≥50,000/µL and 
≥20,000/µL above baseline on at least 2 visits without a dosing period –permitted rescue treatment in the previous 
4 weeks and without any other previous rescue therapy.
2.The percentage of patients with a complete platelet response. Complete platelet response is defined as a 
platelet count ≥100,000/µL on at least 2 visits without a dosing period –permitted rescue treatment in the previous 
4 wee ks and without any  other previous rescue therapy.
3.The percentage of patients with a clinically meaningful platelet response. A clinically meaningful platelet 
response is defined as a platelet count ≥20,000/µL above baseline on at least 2 visits without a d osing period –
permitted rescue treatment in the previous 4 weeks and without any other previous rescue therapy.
4.The percentage of patients with a hemostatic platelet response. A hemostatic platelet response is defined for 
patients with a baseline platelet c ount of <15,000/µL who achieve a platelet count of ≥30,000/µL and ≥20,000/µL 
above baseline on at least 2 visits without a dosing period –permitted rescue treatment in the previous 4 weeks and 
without any other previous rescue therapy.
Statistical Consider ations:
Safety analysis : The safety  analy sis will include all patients who have received at least 1 dose of study drug. 
Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_4118], severity and types of AEs, and by [CONTACT_4119]’ 
vital signs, wei ght, and clinical laboratory results using the safety analysis set. Exposure to study drug and reasons for 
discontinuation will be tabulated. 
AEs that occur after administration of the first dose of TAK -079 or placebo and through the end of the SFP will b e 
tabulated and followed until resolution. 
Related AEs and coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID -19)- related AEs that occur during the LFP will also be 
summarized.
AEs will be tabulated according to the latest version of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, and data will be 
summarized using Preferred Term and primary System Organ Class. All safety analyses will be performed using the 
safety analysis set.
Efficacy Analysis :
Efficacy endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_697884]. Where appropriate, efficacy endpoints may be analyzed with the following methods:
The number and percentage of subjects attaining each type of response will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. 
Binary  responder endpoints will be analyzed using a Fisher exact test.
Change f rom baseline endpoints measured repeatedly over time will be analyzed using a mixed -model 
repeated- measures analysis, which includes treatment, visit, and (treatment × visit) interaction terms as the 
factors, with baseline values as covariates.
All tests of treatment effects will be conducted at a 2 -sided α level of 0.05, and 95% CIs for the differences in 
proportions and least squares means will be provided. No inferential hypothesis was tested in these endpoints, so CIs 
and p-values are not adjusted for multiplicity.

Protocol Incorporating Amendment No. 5 28 April 2022
CONFIDENTIALOne unblinded safety review and one interim analysis will be conducted before the final database lock of this study.
Unblinded Safety Review : An unblinded sa fety review will take place once a minimum of 24 evaluable patients are 
available for analysis in Part A. For the purposes of this unblinded safety review, an evaluable patient is defined as a 
patient w ho exits the dosing period in Part A having received a minimum of 4 study doses, regardless of the reason for 
exit (eg, completion of Part A dosing period, early discontinuation, study drug discontinuation). This unblinded safety 
review will include all unblinded safety data from all patients from Part A avai lable at the data -cut (data up to the 
Week 16 visit). 
Interim Analysis : After all patients in Part B (Arms B1 and B2) complete the blinded SFP (complete the Week 16 
visit), an unblinded interim analysis with Part A and Part B data will take place to evalu ate safety and efficacy. If it is 
deemed not appropriate to continue onto Part B after the unblinded safety review, then this interim analysis will not be 
conducted.
Sample Size Justification:
This study is exploratory and not powered to address any prede fined hypothesis. 
Part A : At least 24 and up to 36 patients will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1:1 to treatment groups (TAK -079 100 mg, 
TAK -079 300 mg, or matching placebo).
Part B : At least 12 and up to 18 patients will be randomized 1:2 to treatment gr oups (matching placebo or TAK -079 
600 mg).

CONFIDENTIAL4.0 INTRODUCTION
4.1 Background
Primary immune thrombocy topenia (ITP) i s a rare autoimmune disease characterized by 
[CONTACT_250212] -mediated destruction of platelets. The annual incidence o f ITP is approximately 1 to 
5 per 100,000 adults and prevalence in the [LOCATION_002] (US) is 8 per 100 ,000 children and 12 per 
100,000 adults (Terrel l et al. 2012 ). The main clinical manifestation of ITP is thrombocytopenia 
(platelet count <100,000/µL) with normal platelet morphol ogy in the absence of other hematologic 
findings (such as abnormalit ies in the coagulat ion cascade, appearance of schistocytes or abnorma l 
leukocy tes). While many pat ients may be asymptomat ic, thrombocytopenia causes bleeding in 
most pati ents. Bleeding may mani fest in a spectrum o f petechiae, nonpalpable purpura, epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], 
and severe hemorrhage. The greatest risk of severe bleeding occurs when the platelet count drops 
below 10,000 to 20,000/µL. Finally, fat igue and associated reduced qualit y of life are commo n 
features of ITP; however, the mechanisms of these effects are not well -understood (Hill and 
Newl and 2015 ; McMillan et al. 2008 ; Newton et al. 2011 ).
ITP is caused by  [CONTACT_697885]. Production of autoantibodies involves both autoreactive CD4 -positive T hel per

Treatment for ITP is divided into first -line and second-l ine treatments (Provan et al. 2010 ). 
First-line treatments include corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and ant i-D 
immunogl obulin (anti -D). These agents generally  work by  [CONTACT_697887]. 
Second- line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_697871]. Medical therapy includes azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporin A, danazo l, 
dapsone, mycopheno late mofetil, and rituximab. These drugs are limited by [CONTACT_697888], 
toxicities, and transient response. Other forms o f therapy are splenectomy  and the use of 
thrombopoi etin receptor agonists (TPO- RAs). Splenectomy, although highly efficacious, is 
associ ated wi th a high com plicati on rate (Kojouri et al . 2004 ), and in many pract ice settings is 
deferred because of the surgical risk and patient and physician preference. 
TPO -RAs (romiplost im, eltrombopag, and avatrombopag), which increase platelet production by 
[CONTACT_697889], are also highly efficaci ous, but often require chronic treatment and 
are associ ated wi th an increase in bone marrow reticulin formation, which has been described for 
both romiplost im and eltrombopag (Bussel et al. 2009; Kuter et al. 2008 )while abnormalit ies in 
liver funct ion tests have been observed in 11% of patients on eltrombopag (Cheng et al. 2011 ). 
Eltrombopag has a boxed warning for severe and potentially  life-threatening hepatotoxicit y. 
Addit ionally , wide swings in the platelet coun t can be seen with TPO- RAs, wi th platelet counts

Approximately  20% o f patients do not respond to the therapeut ic approaches listed above (Provan

responses wit h a favorable safet y profile to help achieve a hemostati c platel et count and improve

4.2 Rationale for the Proposed Study
TAK -079 i s a fully  human ant i-CD38 immunoglobulin ( Ig) G1 m onocl onal ant ibody  (mAb), 
which depletes cells expressing high levels o f target by  [CONTACT_20983], ant ibody -depen dent 
cell-mediated cy totoxici ty, com plement -dependent cy totoxici ty, and ant ibody -dependent cellular 
phagocy tosis. CD38 i s a cell  surface m olecule that is expressed at high levels on short -and 
long-lived plasma cells, plasmablasts and natural killer (NK) c ells, and is induced on activated B -
and T -cells. Deplet ion of plasma cells and plasmablasts would lead to a reduction in the levels o f 
immunogl obulins (Ig) and pathogenic autoantibodies, thereby  [CONTACT_697890] -mediated destruction of platelets and improving the platelet count.

evaluate d in a thorough, comprehensive nonclinical safet y program  com prising single -and 
repeat -dose toxico logy studies in cyno molgus mo nkeys of up to 13 weeks in duration. In these 
studi es, TAK -079 has demo nstrated an acceptable safet y profile and dose -dependent 
pharmacodynamic effects consistent with the mode of action, supporting continuing clinical 
development ( see Module 2.6.2 and TAK -079 Investigator’s B rochure [IB]). 
4.2.1 Rationale for Dosing Regimen
This study is organized in 2 parts (Part A and an optional Part B, each consisting of the main study 
and open -label extensio n [OLE] phases, see Section 6.0, Figure 6.a, Figure 6.b, and Figure 6.cfor 
details). In Part A of this study, doses of 100 and 300 mg of TAK -079 or matching placebo will be 
administered by
 [CONTACT_6567] (SC) inject ion in a d ouble-blinded study  design. Each study  arm 
will enro ll at least 8 and up to 12 patients (for a total of 24 to 36 patients across 3 dosing arms of 
Part A). The study drug or matching placebo is administered once weekly (QW) during the 8 -week 
dosing period, for a m aximum  8 study  doses. After a minimum o f 24 pati ents (8 pati ents per arm ) 
exit the Part A dosing period with a minimum of 4 study doses, an unblinded safety data review 
will be performed ( see Section 6.1.2 for details) to decide whether to move forward with study Part 
B. Part A enro llment will end once Part B enrollment is init iated. Part B consists of a dosing cohort 
of TAK -079 600 mg and a pla cebo arm. A total of 12 -18 patients will be enro lled and rando mized, 
with a rati o of 2:1, into the TAK -[ADDRESS_947247] ion in a double -blinded manner QW during the 8-week

will be available for all placebo patients who wish to obtain access to active study  drug fo llowing 
the com pletion of  the m ain study  dosing peri od and a 2-month safety  follow -up peri od (SFP). 
Please note the information presented below reflects the data used to support the dosing rationale 
included in the original protocol (dated 06 November 2019).
The cri teria for sel ecting the doses and schedule of TAK -[ADDRESS_947248] ivity. The clinical experience to date has demonstrated that TAK -079 is safe 
and well tolerated in 3 different popul ations (ie, healthy subjects, patients with relapsed/refractory 
multiple myelo ma [RRMM], and patients with systemic lupus ery thematosus [SLE]) and across a 
broad range of doses (up to 1200 mg), vascular concentrations and exposures. 
In healthy subjects in Study  TAK -
079_101, single SC doses of TAK- 079 up to 0.6 m g/kg (fixed 
dose equivalent of approximately  45 mg) were well  tolerated, adverse events (AEs) were mild to 
moderate in intensit y, wi th most of  the AEs being mild. There were no serious AEs (SAEs) or
deaths reported in the study, and no AEs led to either study or visit discont inuat ion. No remarkable 
findings for laboratory  tests, el ectrocardi ogram s (ECGs), vi tal signs, or phy sical examinat ions 
were reported that were related to the administration of T AK-079 (see TAK -079 IB).
In the ongoing study  in RRMM, [ADDRESS_947249] been enro lled across 5 dose -escalat ion 
cohorts (4 patients in 45 mg; 3 patients in 135 mg; 12 patients in 300 mg; 12 patients in 600 mg and 
2 patients in 1200 mg). A maximum durat ion of exposure is [ADDRESS_947250] been reported. At the IB data -cut off (20 
March 2019), the safet y profile was co mparable for all tested doses (45 mg [n = 4], 135 mg [n = 3], 
300 m g [n = 6] and 600 mg [n =6]. No pati ents have experienced dose -limiting toxi cities, 
inject ion site react ions (ISRs), or systemic infusio n reactions. No drug- related SAEs, AEs that led 
to study  discontinuation, or on- study  deaths, have been reported. As of June 2019, wi th addit ional 
enrollment to the [ADDRESS_947251] commo nly reported (at least 
20% of all pat ients) treatment -emergent AEs (TEA Es) by [CONTACT_697891] y at 
doses up to [ADDRESS_947252] been scored according to the Co mmo n Termino logy Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) scale as Grade 1 or 2 other than 2 events that were reported as drug -related Grade 
3 events (decreased neutrophil count and anemia [in 1 pat ient each]), both of which were transient. 
In the ongoing study  in SLE, [ADDRESS_947253] been enro lled and treated with 45 m g TAK -079 or 
placebo (in a blinded manner). As of the IB data cutoff (N = 3 patients) fro m March 2019, 1 patient

10.0 ADVERSE EVENTS
10.1 Definitions
10.1.1 Pretreatment Event Definition
A pretreatment event (PTE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient who has signed 
inform ed cons ent to parti cipate in a study  but before administration of any  study  medicati on; it 
does not necessarily  have to have a causal relat ionship wit h study  parti cipat ion.
10.1.[ADDRESS_947307]; 
the untoward medical occurrence does not necessarily have a causal relat ionship with this 
treatm ent.
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unint ended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  
finding), symptom, or disease temporally
 associated wi th the use of a m edicinal  (invest igational) 
product whether or not it is related to the medicinal product.
For non-commercial use only
TAK -[ADDRESS_947308] finding generally may:
Indicate a new diagnosis or unexpected worsening of a preexist ing condit ion. (Intermittent 
events for preexist ing condit ions or underlying disease should not be considered PTEs or 
AEs.)
Necessitate therapeutic intervent ion.
Requi re an invasive diagnostic procedure.
Requi re discontinuation or a change in dose of study medicat ion or a concomitant medicat ion.
Be considered unfavorable by [CONTACT_4168].
Diagnoses versus signs and symptoms:
Each event should be recorded to represent a single  diagnosis. Acco mpanying signs (including 
abnorm al laboratory  values or ECG findings) or symptoms should NOT be recorded as 
additional AEs. If  a diagnosis is unknown, sign(s) or symptom(s) should be recorded 
appropriately  as a PTE(s) or an AE(s).
Laboratory  values and ECG findings:
Changes in laboratory  values or ECG param eters maybe considered AEs if they a re judged to 
be clinically  significant, that is, if some act ion or intervent ion is required or if the invest igator 
judges the change to be beyo nd the range of normal physio logic fluctuation. A laboratory retest 
and/or continued mo nitoring of an abnormal va lue are not considered an intervent ion. In 
addition, repeated or addit ional noninvasive testing for verificat ion, evaluat ion or m onitoring 
of an abnorm ality is not considered an intervention.
If abnormal laboratory values or ECG findings are the result of pathol ogy for whi ch there is an 
overall diagnosis (eg, increased creat inine in renal failure), the diagnosis only should be 
reported appropriately  as an AE.
Preexist ing condit ions:
A preexist ing condit ion (present at the time of signing of informed consent ) is consi dered a 
concurrent medical history condit ion and should NOT be recorded as a PTE or AE. A baseline 
evaluat ion (eg, laboratory test, ECG, x -ray) should NOT be recorded as a PTE unless related to 
a study  procedure. However, if the patient experiences a worsening or complicat ion of such a 
concurrent medical history  condi tion, the worsening or complicat ion should be recorded 
appropriately  as a PTE (worsening or complicat ion occurs before start of study medicat ion) or 
an AE (worsening or complicat ion occurs after start of study medicat ion). Investigators should 
ensure that the event term recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening 
of…”).
If a patient has a preexist ing epi[INVESTIGATOR_45283] (eg, asthma, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]), any occurrence of an 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_4069]/AE if the epi[INVESTIGATOR_4070], serious, 
or severe in nature; that is, invest igators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the 
change from baseline in the condit ion (eg “worsening of…”).

Protocol Incorporating Amendment No. 5 28 April 2022
CONFIDENTIALIf a patien t has a degenerat ive concurrent condit ion (eg, cataracts, rheumatoid arthritis), 
worsening of the condit ion shoul d only  be captured as a PTE/AE if occurring to a greater 
extent than that which would be expected. Again, investigators should ensure that the AE term 
recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening o f…”).
Worsening of AEs:
If the pat ient experiences a worsening or complicatio n of a PTE after the first administration of 
study  medicat ion or a worsening or complicat ion of an AE after any change in study 
medicat ion, the worsening or complicat ion should be recorded as a new AE. Investigators 
shoul d ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening 
of…”).
Changes in severit y of AEs:
If the patient exper iences a change in the severit y of an AE that is not associated with a change 
in study  medicati on, the event shoul d be captured once with the maximum severit y recorded.
Prepl anned surgeries or procedures:
Prepl anned procedures (surgeries or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) that were scheduled before signing of informed 
consent are not considered AEs. However, if a preplanned procedure is performed early (eg, as 
an emergency) because of worsening of the preexisting condit ion, the worsening o f the 
condi tion shoul d be captured appr opriately  as an AE. Com plicat ions result ing from any 
planned surgery  should be reported as AEs.
Elect ive surgeries or procedures:
Elect ive procedures performed where there is no change in the pat ient’s medical condit ion 
shoul d not be recorded as AEs but sh ould be documented in the patient’s source documents. 
Com plicat ions result ing from an elect ive surgery should be reported as AEs.
Overdose:
An overdose is defined as a known deliberate or accidental administration of investigational 
drug, to or by  a study  patient, at a dose above that which is assigned to that individual pat ient 
according to the study  protocol . 
All cases of overdose (with or without associated AEs) are to be documented on the Overdose 
page of the eCRF to capture this important safet y info rmation consistent ly in t he database. AEs 
associ ated wi th an overdose will be documented on the AE CRF(s) according to Section 10.5.
SAEs of overdose shoul d be reported according to the procedure outlined in Sect ion10.2.
If an overdose does occur, close monitoring and supportive treatment as medically required.

CONFIDENTIAL2.Is life-threatening (refers to an AE in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the 
event. It does not refer to an event which hy pothetically might have caused death if it were 
more severe).
3.Requi res inpat ient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324].
4.Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity .
5.Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect .
6.Is a medic ally important event that sati sfies any  of the fo llowing:
–May require intervent ion to prevent items 1 through 5 above.
–May expose the patient to danger, even though the event is not immediately life threatening 
or fatal  or does not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n.
Note: Some clinical centers may  only be able to provi de certain dosing period –permitted rescue 
therapi [INVESTIGATOR_014] (eg, IVIg) via inpat ient hospi [INVESTIGATOR_3094]. Therefore, the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4073] n itself (in an 
otherwi se clinically  stable patient) specifically for acce ss and administration of rescue therapy  
does not count automat ically as an SAE, unless there are other circumstances that fulfill SAE 
criteria.
AEs that fulfill 1 or more of the serious criteria above are to be considered SAEs and should be 
reported and fo llowed up in the same manner. An inpat ient hospi [INVESTIGATOR_697878], as described in Section
 8.2.5 , in 
an otherwise clinically  stable pati ent is not considered a fulfillment of criterion 2, above.
Clarificat ion should be made between an SAE and an AE that is considered severe in intensit y 
(Grade 3 or 4) because the terms seriou s and severe are NOT synonymous. The general term 
severe is often used to describe the intensit y (severity ) of a specific event; the event itself, however, 
may be of relat ively minor medical significance (such as a Grade 3 headache). This is NOT the 
same as seri ous, which is based on pat ient/event outcome or action criteria described above and is 
usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or abilit y to funct ion. A severe 
AE (Grade 3 or 4) does not necessarily need to be considered serious. For example, a white blood 
cell count of 1000/mm3to less than 2000/mm3is considered Grade 3 (severe) but may not be 
considered serious. Seriousness (not intensit y) serves as a gui de for defining regul atory  reporting 
obligat ions.
10.2 Procedures for Recording and Reporting AEs and SAEs
All AEs spontaneously reported by  [CONTACT_4170] m study  
personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examinat ion, or other diagnostic procedures will be 
recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF (see Section 10.3 for the period of observat ion). Any

Protocol Incorporating Amendment No. 5 28 April 2022
CONFIDENTIALProtocol Amendment 1 and Rationale
This document describes the changes to the protocol in corporating Amendment 01. The primary  
reason for this amendment is to address [LOCATION_002] (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
feedback on the primary immune thrombocy topenia (ITP) Invest igational New Drug (IND).This 
feedback indicated that all patien ts should have either phenotype or genotype testing prior to study 
drug treatment with no except ions. This is because there is a potential that TAK -[ADDRESS_947348] 
blood bank serologic testing should a patient require a red blood cell (RBC) transfusio n. Whi le the 
inform ed consent form  specified that thi s test i s requi red for all  patients, the language in the 
protocol  was inconsistent with this. This amendment revises the protocol language to accurately 
reflect that the RBC phenoty pe or genoty pe assessment is requi red for study parti cipat ion. 
Extended RBC ant igen typi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (assessed by [CONTACT_165769][INVESTIGATOR_697882]) is required before 
initiation of study dosing.
Correcti on of  FEV 1 tobe defined as forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_6003] 1 second; previously 
erroneously defined as forced expi [INVESTIGATOR_4034] 1 minute.
Correcti on of Appendix B Schedule of Events: OLE -A and OLE -B; indicat ing postmedicatio n 
dosing is to be conducted during EW1, previously it  was erroneously indicated to be performed 
during EW1D3.
Minor grammat ical, editorial, formatting, and administrative changes not affect ing the conduct of 
the study  are included for clarificat ion and administrative purposes only.

 0.0 Amendment Information  
0.1 Rationale for the Amendment:  
The initial protocol proposes a randomized controlled trial of rapid -start hepatitis C (HCV) treatment 
intervention co -located at a syringe service program. Due to the  impact of the COVID -[ADDRESS_486060] drugs (PWID) will 
be very di fferent. Foremost, the impact of COVID -19 on syringe service programs may limit the ability to 
offer co -located interventions. A recent national survey showed that 43% of programs have reduced 
services and nearly all had eliminated HCV and HIV testing due to the need for person -to-person 
contact.[ADDRESS_486061].2 It is not clear whether telemedicine is 
equitably accessible across different patient populations.3 Telemedicine has been found to be 
acceptable for hepatitis C management in patients in several healthcare settings.4,5 Our interve ntion 
serves a unique population not covered by [CONTACT_48347]: they are currently injecting and recruited from 
the community, and so may face significant healthcare access barriers. On the other hand, they are a 
young population (<30 years old) that may be  technologically equipped to embrace telemedicine -based 
HCV treatment. Understanding how to adapt existing community -based healthcare intervention for 
populations with limited healthcare access will be critical in the po st-COVID era.   
In this amendment, we will change the enrollment and analysis plans of our randomized study (called 
part A). This will involve conducting the analysis and reporting of comparative data between 
intervention and control arms, with the same study endpoints as the ini tial proposal. The main reason 
for ending enrollment at this time is the long delay we are likely to face before a co -located intervention 
can be offered in a physical syringe service program space. Instead, we will adapt our intervention to be 
telemedicin e-based for continued enrollment into a nonrandomized treatment group (Part B). After the 
end of follow -up for part B, we will describe outcomes and compare to the previously randomized 
control population, to test if telemedicine -based engagement is feasib le, safe, and noninferior to the co -
located intervention.    
0.2 Protocol Changes : 
 
1. Section 1.2  
Change:  Addition of: In Part B, all participants will be enrolled to the   intervention group, modified to 
allow telemedicine delivery.    
2. Section 1.4: Interventio n Arm  
Change:  For participants entering in Part B, the co -located rapid start intervention will be converted to 
telemedicine rapid -start intervention. Consented participants will have same -day or next -
day  telemedicine visits with a hepatitis C provider an d baseline blood testing will be arranged on a 
personalized basis utilizing convenient community -based laboratory facilities (including current co -
located SSP and commercial laboratories).   For participants found to be HCV PCR positive, personal 
delivery o r pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696] -up of a 28 -day supply of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir   (Epclusa ®) will be 
HCV ST&RT – Trial Protocol – Amendment 1   6/17/2020  
7 
 arranged.   Telemedicine visits will be arranged two weeks after treatment delivery.   For participants 
who confirm treatment initiation, side effects will be assessed, delivery/pic k-up of the final 56 -day of 
medication will be arranged, and week 4 monitoring labs will be offered (no longer required) and 
arranged.  
3. Section 1.7:  Secondary Objectives  
Change:  To assess the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of a telemedicine -based rapid start 
intervention for hepatitis C treatment in young people who inject drugs.   
4. Section 3:  Study Design  
Change: For participants entering in Part B, randomization will not occur. All participants will be 
assigned to the intervention arm, which we wi ll call the telemedicine arm in this document.  
Rationale: The part B telemedicine arm will not be randomized, and instead will be compared to 
previously randomized arms. This is in order to maximize sample size exposed to the intervention with 
the availabl e remaining budget and grant period.  
5. Section 4 :  Participant Selection and Enrollment  
Change: For participants entering in Part B, enrollment may occur in person or remotely (no person -to-
person contact [CONTACT_387775])  
Rationale: Remote enrollment procedures will  allow continued referral and enrollment even without 
the physical location of the syringe service program. Informed consent will be converted to electronic 
informed consent using a RedCAP survey, a procedure we have successfully implemented at Weill 
Corne ll for COVID -related studies.  
6. Section  5.1 : Schedule of Study Events  
Change: Week [ADDRESS_486062]. The frequency of medical visits will be unchanged but physical 
exams will no longer be performed except as possible through telemedicine. Weekly telephone or video 
check -ins will also continue.   
7. Section 5.8 : Storage of samples for future analysis  
Change: Storage samples collected only when feasible for Part B.  
Rationale: Since we will now be  utilizing clinical laboratories, storage of samples for research purposes 
will occur when feasible, but not required for all participants and all timepoints.  
8. Section 8.1  Sample size   
Change:    Data on the randomized controlled portion of the study (Part A ) will be analyzed based on 
enrollment through March 1, [ADDRESS_486063] a difference between the 2 groups will be 
reduced from what was calculated for a sample size of 54 patients..    
Rationale: The COVID pandemic created a natural break in enr ollment and inability to continue study as 
planned.  
HCV ST&RT – Trial Protocol – Amendment 1   6/17/2020  
8 
 9. Section 8:  Statistical and Analytic Considerations  
Change: Adding the Part B analysis for comparing the telemedicine arm to the previously enrolled study 
arms.  
Rationale for change: We will compare the pr oportion of patients who achieve SVR12 in each Part B 
telemedicine to   (1)Part A intervention   (2) Part A control,   using Chi -square or Fishers’ exact testing, 
using an intention -to-treat approach in which participants are analyzed in the group to which th ey are 
randomized. Participants with negative confirmatory HCV RNA PCR tests on study entry will not be 
included in the analysis, consistent with our existing approach.  
10. Consent form : 
The consent form was revised to reflect the addition of Part B.   Part A p articipants do not need to be 
reconsented.  
1.0 Synopsis  
 
1.1 Purpose of Study:  
The purpose of this randomized study is to determine whether a community -based test and treat model 
of hepatitis C (HCV) care delivery will be superior to the usual care practice of referral to specialist clinics 
for the outcomes of sustained virologic response at [ADDRESS_486064] drugs ( PWID) between ages 18 and 29 who are naïve to HCV treatment  
1.2 Design:  
ST&RT is a randomized open -label clinical trial conducted in two parts. In part A, whic h HCV infected 
PWID between ages 18 and 29 will be randomized to either receive the same -day treatment initiation of 
the FDA-approved  fixed dose combination of sofosbuvir 400mg and velpatasvir 100mg (SOF/VEL) with 
follow up and medical monitoring at a community site (Intervention arm) or to receive referral to an 
HCV treatment provider’s office (Usual Care Arm) . In Part B, participants will be enrolled to receive 
hepatitis C rapid treatment initiation in a telemedicine  model . 
1.3 Participant selection:  
1.3.1 Inclusion Criteria  
Persons are eligible for study inclusion if they: (a) are HCV antibody positive, (b) are 18 to 29 years of 
age, (c) have injected drugs in the past 30 days , (d) are HCV treatment naïve , (e) are English speaking  
1.3.2 Exclusion Criteria  
Persons excluded from the study will be (a) HIV coinfected persons (b) pregnant women , or wo men  
planning on becoming pregnant  (c) participants with end -stage renal disease (d) participants with 
decompensated cirrhosis (c) participants on medications with t reatment limiting interactions with 
SOF/VEL  (detailed below) . In part B only, participants who cannot participate in telemedicine visits (lack 
of telephone, smart phone or computer or internet connection) will be excluded.   
1.4 Study procedures  
1.4.1 Enrol lment and sampling  
Potential research participants will be recruited by [CONTACT_387776] t injectors (R01DA041501), hereafter referred to as the parent 
HCV ST&RT – Trial Protocol – Amendment 1   6/17/[ADDRESS_486065] a randomized, controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of a 
“Staying Safe” prevention intervention in reducing injection -related risk behavior and HCV incidence 
among [ADDRESS_486066] opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (heroin and/or POs) and test HCV and HIV antibody -negative 
at screening. The parent study is continuing to enroll participants and perform HCV testing. Whereas 
previous procedures would have required that the participant be referred physically to the syringe 
service program, we are now allowing for remote enrollment by [CONTACT_387777].  Since the parent study is still operating, we expect to continue to receive referrals of HCV -
infected people. Candidates for the parent study who test HCV antibody positive at the screening visit, 
will be immediately offered enrollment in ST&RT.  The target sample size of 27 participants per arm is 
selected to show a hypothesized difference in SVR 12 rates of about 35% with 80% power at a level of 
0.05. Participants who are enrolled but negative on confirmatory testing (an expected 25% of 
participants) will be replaced.  These participants will not receive treatment interventions but continue 
to be f ollowed for monitoring of HCV re -infection incidence.  We anticipate enrolling 36 participants per 
arm to achieve the target of 27 confirmed infections per arm.  
1.4.2 Intervention Arm  
In Part A: Participants randomized to the intervention arm will have a s ame -day visit with a study 
physician.  Those who are interested in being treated for their HCV, and have no contraindication, will 
(a) have standard of care baseline laboratory testing drawn and be given a one -week ‘Starter -Pack’ (7 
day supply ) of sofosbuv ir 400mg/velpatasvir 100mg. Subsequent supplies of DAA therapy will be 
distributed  to HCV RNA test positive participants  as one [ADDRESS_486067] y to complete a 12-
week treatment course . Those participants with negative confirmatory HCV RNA testi ng will be 
contact[CONTACT_387778] , and will not be given additional 
medication supplies.  
Participants will  be contact[CONTACT_387779]/velpatasvir by [CONTACT_387780], potential  adverse effects, and offered other tele -support as needed.  Scheduled study visits 
will occur at 4 weeks, upon treatment completion or discontinuation (study week 12), study week 16 
(corresponding to SVR4), study week 24 (corresponding to SVR12), study week 36, and study week 48. 
Each study visit will consist of laboratory testing, semi -structured interview, and physician visit. 
Additional medical visits may be scheduled at the participants’ request. Additionally, each participant 
will be scheduled  for a one -time counseling session for prevention of reinfection during their course of 
treatment . Referral to harm reduction and /or opi[INVESTIGATOR_387762], but utilization of these services is n ot a condition of enrollment in the study 
or of HCV treatment provision . 
In Part B: Participants will be enrolled in the telelmedicine arm, and will have a same -day or next -day 
telemedicine visit with the hepatitis C provider. Initial evaluation will be ei ther via telephone, video, or 
in-person at the syringe service program depending on patient preference. Blood testing will be 
arranged at local community laboratory facilities. Participants with positive HCV RNA will have delivery 
of a 28 day supply of sof osbuvir/velpatasvir, and a [ADDRESS_486068] clinical laboratory monitoring at week 4 (optional), week 12, 
every [ADDRESS_486069]&RT – Trial Protocol – Amendment 1   6/17/2020  
10 
 1.4.3 Usual Care Arm  
During Part A: Participants randomized to the usual care arm will have a same -day lab draw for 
confirmatory HCV RNA testing. Those wh o test  RNA  positive will be referred to local clinic or community 
based HCV medical providers.  
Participants will be contact[CONTACT_387781] a short questionnaire. Scheduled study visits 
will occur at study weeks 12, 24 , 36 and 48 for semi -structured interviews  and HCV RNA testing .  
During Part B: no participants will be assigned to  the usual care  arm

 2.0 Introduction   
2.1 Background  
Our proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_387765] a novel rapid) treatment 
initiation strategy that if found effective could be further studied as part of a new model for HCV 
treatment delivery in young PWID, namely: Seek, Test a nd Rapid Treat (HCV ST&RT, a modification of 
the well-known  Seek, Test and Treat model for HIV). This strategy has potential to avoid the attrition 
observed on the HCV care cascade and reach the population most important for treatment as 
prevention, young PWID.  This study focuses on Rapid Treatment initiation and will not study the Seek 
and Test components, however we will refer to the strategy as HCV ST&RT throughout this proposal for 
simplicity.  
The [LOCATION_002] has been experiencing a dramatic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] e pi[INVESTIGATOR_387766] a 
decade. Between 2002 and 2013, heroin use in the [LOCATION_002] has increased by 63%, with the largest 
increase (109%) in individuals aged [ADDRESS_486076] acting antivirals (DAAs) with high efficacy and tolerability has 
revolutionized treatment of HCV.16,17 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], PWID are faced with multiple b arriers to successful 
treatment: in addition to the effects of substance use and its comorbid conditions, PWID face mistrust 
within the medical system, explicit sobriety requirements from insurers, and a lengthy prior 
authorization process which necessitat es extensive medical workup before initiating treatment.18-[ADDRESS_486077] that only 38% of HCV -diagn osed PWID are engaged in care, and 
only 12% have initiated treatment.[ADDRESS_486078] them for 
more than a decade.22 
Overcoming the barriers to treat young PWID is ess ential: DAA therapy has the potential to impact the 
HCV epi[INVESTIGATOR_901], and among young PWID, it has the potential to prevent incidence, reduce prevalence, 
and potentially eradicate HCV infections entirely.23-[ADDRESS_486079], the demonstration of this concept 
helped to change the paradigm of HIV treatment, supporting early initiation of treatment before CD4 
count reductions.  
Rapid initiation of therapy in individuals at high risk of tran smitting disease can help to minimize 
transmission. In a San Francisco study of HIV, the same -day initiation of antiretroviral therapy led to 
significantly faster time to viral suppression without sacrificing effectiveness.31   This outco me was 
accomplished using an intervention consisting of (a) same -day access to an HIV provider, (b) accelerated 
insurance approval process (c) pre -approved regimens (d) 5 -day starter packs, (e) observed 
administration of first dose, and (f) telephone follo w-up.  A similar model is now being implemented in 
sexually transmitted infection clinics in [LOCATION_001] City (JUMPSTART program).  In contrast to HIV where 
HCV ST&RT – Trial Protocol – Amendment 1   6/17/[ADDRESS_486080] allowed for increased decentralization of HCV management and 
treatment: tele -consultation with specialists is allowing treatment prescriptions by [CONTACT_387783],32 and the ease of DAA therapy can facilitate treatment to be located at community sites 
rather than in specialty clinics.33,34 Our group, among others, has demonstrated the safety and 
effectiveness of medical evaluation and treatment with DAAs located at a syringe services program (SSP) 
in [LOCATION_001] City, with sustained virologic response at 12 weeks (SVR12) of 85%.35, and low rates of r e-
infection [unpublished data]. We are now studying this model on a larger scale in a randomized control 
trial comparing accessible SSP -based care with standard of care (R01 DA041298).  However, our 
experience suggests that accessible care may not be suffi cient incentive for young PWID to seek HCV 
treatment.  This is especially true for suburban, housed, young PWID who are less likely to frequent 
existing harm reduction services than their older counterparts. To truly impact the prevalence and 
incidence of HCV, models of HCV treatment delivery and prevention need to focus on young, active 
PWID (where ongoing transmission is most concentrated).  
Evidence suggests that high rates of HCV treatment engagement of young PWID is not possible without 
aggressively ad dressing the various barriers complicating the treatment cascade, specifically the delay 
between HCV confirmation and treatment initiation that currently results not only from the need for 
linkage to an HCV provider but also from (a) extensive pre -treatmen t lab testing (genotype, fibrosis 
assessment, and resistant testing) and (b) lengthy insurance prior authorization process.   
Our proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_387767], Test and Rapid Treatment (HCV 
ST&RT) and the effectiveness of  Rapid Treatment Initiation in young PWID involving (1) immediate 
initiation of DAA treatment at time of diagnosis using starter packs, (2) community based treatment 
location, and (3) minimal in -person monitoring with text message -based support during the treatment 
process. We will achieve this using DAA treatment with a pan -genotypic treatment regimen, leveraging 
our existing community partnerships with local SSPs, and using mobile health technology to 
communicate with participants without necessitating fr equent office visits.  
2.[ADDRESS_486081]&RT – Trial Protocol – Amendment 1   6/17/[ADDRESS_486082] chosen one such regimen, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, as our 
drug of choice for this study.  
2.2.[ADDRESS_486083] for liver fibrosis (imaging or laboratory) , and a pregnancy test (for female 
patients)  will be ordered.  HCV RNA positive patients in the intervention arm will be asked to start 
medications after results of laboratory testing are reviewed.  After medication start, one laboratory visit 
will be scheduled at [ADDRESS_486084] on substance use 
behaviors  and injec tion risk , and to refine future iterations, we will solicit participant outcomes via 
survey and interview.  
2.3 Summary of Risks and Benefits  
Potential risks of the study include:  
• Breach of confidentiality regarding drug use behaviors and hepatitis C diseas e status  
• Adverse events from HCV treatment  
• Adverse events from study related laboratory and imaging tests  
• In the event of treatment failure, there is a risk of resistance developi[INVESTIGATOR_387768]  
• Emotional distress from survey and interview ques tions pertaining to sensitive topi[INVESTIGATOR_387769], sexual health, and substance use behaviors.  
HCV ST&RT – Trial Protocol – Amendment 1   6/17/2020  
16 
 Potential benefits of the study include:  
• In the intervention arm, easily accessible HCV treatment that by[CONTACT_387784]  
• Linkage to harm reduction services for PWID, with facilitated referral to substance use 
treatment if interested  
• Public health benefit of HCV treatment in PWID, in terms of theoretical reduction in 
transmission  potential.  
• Financial compensation for participation in study procedures  
3.[ADDRESS_486085] access to technology that 
allows telemedicine interventions ( eg telephone, smartphone,  or internet connection).  
The goal of the study is to provide same -day, easily accessed medical evaluation and treatment to the 
intervention arm. During part A, pa rticipants randomized to the intervention will receive medical 
evaluation, laboratory assessment in cluding confirmatory HCV RNA testing, baseline 
questionnaire/interview, and distribution of a 7 -day medication “starter pack” on the day of enrollment. 
Participants who are HCV RNA negative will be notified by [CONTACT_25600], be asked to return their 
medicatio ns but  continue to be followed for research visits  every [ADDRESS_486086] adherence. They will receive one follow -up medical visit at 4 weeks with laboratory 
evalua tion, with distribution of the remainder of medications, and another visit at the end of treatment.  
One of these two visits  (the participants’ choice) will include counseling for prevention of reinfection.  
They will then have HCV RNA PCR testing at end of treatment and [ADDRESS_486087]&RT – Trial Protocol – Amendment 1   6/17/2020  
17 
 During part B, HCV RNA positive participants will hav e a 28-day supply of medications delivered, or 
available for pi[INVESTIGATOR_9107], as they prefer. The schedule of visits will be similar except that laboratory testing at 
week 4 will be optional, and all visits will be offered through telemedicine.  
The three arms will be compared for the main outcome of SVR12 using a modified intention to treat 
analysis in which participants will be analyzed in the group they are randomized except for those who 
are (a) discontinued due to HCV RNA negative status or (b) found to have pre viously undiagnosed HIV at 
enrollment. Secondary outcomes will be compared using the same  modified  intention to treat design.  
4. Participant Selection and Enrollment  
Participants will be recruited by [CONTACT_387785]. The parent study a ims to 
prevent HCV among young current PWID (R01DA041501). Potential enrollees for the parent study will 
receive baseline HCV antibody testing, and those that test positive will be referred to ST&RT. 
Participants willing to enroll may be of fered a same -day or next  business day visit to assess for eligibility. 
If eligible for ST&RT, participants will receive informed consent. Ineligible participants may be offered 
enrollment into other ongoing studies. We do not expect to enroll participants fr om other referral 
sources for this study ; however, participants meeting the inclusion criteria from other sources will also 
be considered if otherwise eligible  For participants enrolling in part B, enrollment may occur in person 
or remotely (i.e. without p erson to person contact).

 5.2 Laboratory evaluations  
5.2.1 HCV RNA PCR  
HCV RNA PCR will be collected and performed at a clinical laboratory  ([COMPANY_002] Diagnostics COBAS 
TaqMan) . HCV RNA PCR will be performed for all participants at each study visit, regardless of 
randomized treatment arm.  
5.2.2 HIV -1/[ADDRESS_486094]&RT will be required to have a positive HCV antibody and negative HIV 
antibody test prior t o consent and randomization. On -site HIV testing will be offered prior to entry  to 
participants who do not already have a documented negative antibody. HIV retesting will be every 6 
months thereafter, in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_387770].   As 
necessar y, patients will be referred for  additional HIV testing, including testing for acute retroviral 
infection using HIV -1 RNA PCR  
5.2.3 FIB -4 
The FIB -4 score will be calculated from laboratory testing using the following formula:36 
Fib-4 = Age (years ) * AST Level (U/L)  
             Platelet count (109/L)*sq.rt.(ALT(U/L))  
With a score of >3.[ADDRESS_486095] e of participants at the end of therapy (week 12), and 
at week 24, and 48. Participants will be asked to identify factors that promote or hinder engagement in 
HCV treatment, harm reduction services or substance use treatment.  We will also inquire about 
participants substance use , sexual,  and injection risk behaviors pre -, during and post - treatment.  
Participants who refuse interview will still be offered the HCV treatment.  At the end of therapy, 
participants will be asked about changes in these factors, about uptake of safer injecting p ractices, 
engagement in harm reduction or substance use treatment, and the acceptability of the Seek, Test, and 
Rapid Treatment intervention.  
 5.[ADDRESS_486096]&RT – Trial Protocol – Amendment 1   6/17/[ADDRESS_486097] HCV RNA PCR testing at 24 and 48 weeks, but it is expected that these may not be “post -
treatment,” as we expect treatment initiation to be delayed for the control p articipants.  
True r einfection will be defined as a positive HCV RNA PCR  with a different HCV genotype, occurring 
anytime after a documented SVR 12 (negative HCV RNA PCR 12 weeks or more after treatment 
completion).  
Participants who (1) did not have a docu mented SVR [ADDRESS_486098] a positive HCV RNA PCR  OR (2) have a positive HCV RNA PCR 
after documented SVR12 with the same genotype as the initial infection , will be classified as possib le 
reinfections. These participants will then be reclassified as either true reinfections or relapses based on 
viral sequencing of their baseline HCV infection compared to subsequent positive HCV RNA PCRs.38  
5.6 Monitoring for incident HCV infection  
Participants who had a negative  HCV RNA PCR at baseline (or whose HCV RNA PCR became negative 
without treatment), who subsequently have a positive HCV RNA PCR will be considered incident HCV 
infections , but not reinfections.  
5.7 Reinfection Prevention Counseling  
All HCV RNA positive participants  in the intervention arm  will be scheduled for a harm reduction 
counseling session focusing specifically on HCV reinfection prevention. Participants will receive a 
condensed version of Staying Safe (Ssafe). Ssafe is an innovative, strengths -based,  socio -behavioral HCV 
prevention intervention for young PWID. Ssafe addresses multi -level “upstream” determinants of risk 
that occur relatively early in the causal chain of risk, including eco -social conditions, social relations and 
risk situations, in add ition to directly targeting risky injection practices. Ssafe trains and motivates PWID 
to better manage drug use to avoid situations and practices that promote risky injection (e.g., “binging” 
on drugs), and to implement health -protective behaviors (e.g., promoting risk -reduction norms in 
injection networks).  Additionally, referral to existing LESHRC services will be encouraged including 
syringe exchange, overdose prevention, substance use treatment, and social services  
5.[ADDRESS_486099] plasma samples and/ or dried blood spots  (in event phlebotomy 
unavailable or unsuccessful)  stored at the Weill Cornell Clinical and Translational Science Center 
laboratory. Future analyses will include HCV genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_387771], 
and phylogenetic analyses of HCV virus. Participants in Part B will have sample s stored when feasible, 
which we expect to be uncommon as laboratory testing will largely occur at community sites.  
6. Clinical Management Issues  
6.1 Chronic Kidney disease  
Estimated GFR will be calculated based on the CKD -EPI [INVESTIGATOR_387772]. 
Participants with chronic kidney disease stage 4 or 5, defined as estimated GFR < 30 mL/min, or those 
reporting hemodialysis will be discontinued from the s tudy.   Participants with any amount of chronic 
renal impairment will be counseled about the potential for a higher degree of side effects that may be 
observed in these groups, in accordance with national guidelines39  
HCV ST&RT – Trial Protocol – Amendment 1   6/17/[ADDRESS_486100] evidence of chronic HBV infection (positive HBV surface antigen) will be 
monitored for signs of reactivation includin g elevation of liver enzymes or clinical symptoms such as 
jaundice. Those who do have signs of reinfection will be provided with facilitated referral to an HBV 
treatment provider for treatment. Those who do not have evidence of HBV immunity (negative HBV 
surface antibody and negative HBV surface antigen) will be referred for HBV vaccination.  
6.[ADDRESS_486101] office for management of t heir HCV.  
6.8 Incident hepatitis  C infection  
Participants with incident hepatitis C as defined in section 5.6 will be given options for treatment of their 
HCV. These may include enrollment in other studies (if eligible) or referral to an external provide r for 
management of their HCV.  
6.9 Drug Intera ctions  
Participants will be assessed for the following drug interactions based on commonly observed co -
administered medications: H2 -receptor antagonists in doses exceeding famotidine 40mg twice daily, 
proton -pump inhibitors in doses exceeding omeprazole 20mg daily, amiodarone, digoxin, topotecan, 
phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], oxcarbazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifampin, rifapentine, rifabutin, St John’s 
Wort, rosuvastatin at doses exceeding 10mg. Where alternatives can be found, they will be utilized in  
HCV ST&RT – Trial Protocol – Amendment 1   6/17/[ADDRESS_486102]. They may also be 
discontinued from the study if, at any time, they are considered by [CONTACT_387787] (e.g. due to severe illness, incarceration, change of 
residence). However, in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_387773], participants who are unwilling 
to partake in interviews or questionnaires, or undergo  blood tests , will still remain in  the study.  
8 Statistical and analytic considerations  
8.1 Sample size  
Our own data (and others) suggests a SVR12 rate of 85% in active PWID (30), and existing literature 
suggests the control arm will have a very low uptake of HCV treatment (12% initiate t reatment). (16) 
Using these estimates and an alpha =0.05, we have 100% power to detect a difference. However given 
the available referral and linkage programs, the control arm may have better HCV uptake and SVR 12 
rates than predicted by [CONTACT_387788]. Assumi ng 41% (11/27) of participants in the control arm achieve 
SVR12, we will have 80% power to detect an SVR of 78% in the intervention arm.  
In addition to have an adequate sample size to compare the primary end point of SVR12 rates with the 
control arm, a sam ple size of 27 HCV infected participants in Rapid Treatment arm allows for 90% power 
to show with reasonable certainty that the underlying true SVR12 rate is greater than 60% in the Rapid 
Treatment arm, assuming that this true rate is actually 85%.  
The tab le below also shows two -sided exact Blyth -Still-Casella (BSC) 90% CIs for potential observed SVR 
proportions for 27 enrolled participants. With a HCV infected sample size of 27 participants, the CI for 
the true SVR12 rate will be entirely above 60% if [ADDRESS_486103] detectable HCV RNA will be replaced. Assuming 75% of HCV 
antibody positive individuals will be infected with HCV (positive HCV RNA), we anticipate have to enroll 
roughly [ADDRESS_486104]&RT – Trial Protocol – Amendment 1   6/17/2020  
26 
 Observed SVR12 Rate  90% CI for True SVR12 Rate  
85% (23/27)  (71%, 93%)  
81% (22/27)  (65%, 90%)  
78% (21/27)  (62%, 90%)  
74% (20/27)  (58%, 85%)  
70% (19/27)  (54%, 84%)  
67% (18/27)  (50%, 80%)  
 
As of this amendment, data from part A will be analyzed based on enrollment through March [ADDRESS_486105] a difference will be reduced from the above calculation. This is due to the break in 
enrollment that was necessary during the COVID -19 pandemic.  
8.2 Randomization  
Participants will be randomly assigned to the intervention or control condition in a 1:1 ratio using 
randomly permuted blocks.  Participants randomized in the intervention arm will receive medical 
evaluation  and distribution of  “starter pack.” Participants in the control arm will be provided referral to 
community HCV providers . 
8.3 Data Analysis  
8.3.1 Analysis of clinical outcomes data  
For the primary analysis, after the completion of part A, we will compare the proportion of pa tients who 
achieve SVR12 in each arm using Chi -square or Fishers’ exact testing, using an intention -to-treat 
approach in which participants are analyzed in the group to which they are randomized. Participants 
with negative confirmatory HCV RNA PCR tests on  study entry will not be included in the analysis.   
For secondary analyses, we will:  
- Compare the proportion of patients who achieve end -of-treatment response using Chi -square or 
Fishers’ exact testing  
- Compare the proportion of patients who complete treatme nt, using Chi -square or Fishers’ exact 
testing  
- Compare the proportion of patients who have HCV reinfection, using Chi -square or Fishers’ 
exact testing  
- Describe adherence for participants in the Intervention arm only  
- Describe demographic, clinical and behavioral factors for participants who have HCV reinfection  
or incident HCV infection  
We will also perform the same analyses using an “as -treated” approach, in which participants in the 
intervention arm will not be included if they failed to initiate HCV treatment, or discontinued treatment 
for reasons clearly unrelated to the treatment intervention (e.g. relocation, incarceration) .  
After the completion of part B, we will compare the proportion of patients who achieve SVR12 in each 
Part B telemedicine to   (1)Part A intervention   (2) Part A control,   using Chi -square or Fishers’ exact 
testing, using an intention -to-treat approach in which participants are analyzed in the group to which 
they are randomized. Participants with negative confirmatory HCV RNA PCR  tests on study entry will not 
be included in the analysis.

 8.3.2 Analyses for qualitative data  
A subset of patients will be selected for qualitative interview from each arm. Participants will be 
recruite d using purposive sampling, aiming for diversity of demographic characteristics, HCV risk factors, 
and treatment outcomes. Qualitative interviews will be analyzed using content analysis, creating codes 
and synthesizing them into dominant themes.

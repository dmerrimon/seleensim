Title: Study 1 Replication and Extension of Prior Work  
Study ID: [REMOVED]

The objective of this study was  to see whether autistic and non-autistic children learn new words 
when they are presented in one of two conditions: as part of speech directly addressed to the 
child (Addressed condition), as part of speech they overhear (Overheard condition). Children participated in the experimental task in both conditions (within-subject design). The method was a behavioral experiment in which children were exposed to a novel word (e.g., “toma”) in the 
context of one of three objects. The exposure either occurred with the experimenter looking 
directly at the child (Addressed condition) or looking at another adult (Overheard condition). They were then shown the three objects and given a prompt to identify which object is labeled by [CONTACT_820502] (e.g., “where is the toma?”). Children’s eye gaze was coded as a measure of which object they preferred to look at after the prompt. After a delay of a few minutes, the test was repeated as a measure of retention.  The primary dependent variable reported here is the number of children who look at the target 
object more than would be expected by [CONTACT_820503]; 
because there are three objects, chance is 33.33%.   The primary statistical analysis involves ask ing whether children in each condition (Addressed or 
Overheard) look at the target significantly more than chance levels. Binomial tests are used to see if the number of children who do so is significantly greater than would be expected by [CONTACT_3364].

assessments and used in data analysis to evaluate the drug being 
tested in the study .
Withdrawal of consent 
(WoC)/ Opposition to 
use of data/biological 
samplesWithdrawal of consent from the study  occurs when the participant 
explicitly requests to stop use of their data and biological samples 
(opposition to use data and biological samples) AND no longer wishes to 
receive study treatment, AND does not agree to further protocol required 
assessm ents.  This request should be in writing (depending on local 
regulations) and recorded in the source documentation.  Opposition to 
use data/biological samples occurs in the countries where collection and 
processing of personal data is justified by a differ ent legal reason than 
consent.

Amendment 02
Rationale for Amendment
Although IgM and IgG are assessed at baseline, this does not indicate if participants’ values 
were declining, were stable or were inclining when entering the trial.  Collection of historical 
values will allow us to observe trends prior to initiating treatment with ofatumumab.
The purpose of the Amendment 2 is to amend the Schedule of Assessments to include:
Table 8-1:  Addition of “Historical IgM and IgG” collection to the screening visit
Footnote #25 added : Historical IgM and IgG results if available from pre -baseline of 
IV anti-CD20 treatment (one result pre -infusion) and then any  testing done following 
IV anti-CD20 initiation.  This should be recorded on ce for all participants enrolled or 
completed and may  be collected at any  visit.
Footnote #14:  Addition of the word “safet y” in front of assessments
Section 8.4.5: Added “If available, historical IgM and IgG values that have been collected 
prior to screening visit, inclu de one pre -anti- CD20 infusion value, should be recorded 
including the collection date.  This should be recorded for all new, existing, and completed 
participants, and may  be entered at any time -point during the stud y.
Section 12.5.2 under Clinical laboratory  evaluations: Added “In addition, historical change of 
IgM and IgG will be summarized.”
Section 15: Added reference “ Agarwal S and Cunningham- Rundles C (2007) Assessment and 
clinical interpretation of reduced IgG values. Annals of allergy , asthma & immunology . 99(3): 
281-283.”
All relevent section(s) of the protocol are updated to reflect all changes.
Additionally , other administrative changes include the following:
Under Table 8 -3 (Severity  of MS Relapse) removed “By [CONTACT_7943] 2003”
Amendment 01
Rationale for Amendment
The purpose of Amendment 1 is to amend the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Changes to the Inclusion criteria in protocol summary  and section 5.1
Inclusion #
2: Increased age limit to 60 y ears of age.
Inclusion #5:  Re moved “no more than 5 courses” limit and updated to at least 1 fully

The primary  endpoint will be no change or a reduction from Baseline (assessed 
at Screening Visit) in the number of gadolinium enhancing lesions observed by 
[CONTACT_188619] 12, a binar y outcome (yes, no).
The number (and percentage) of participants with no change or a reduction will 
be presented. The 95% confidence interval for the proportion of participants with 
no change or a reduction will be calculated by [CONTACT_188620].
The above analyses will be conducted using the Full -Analysis -Set (FAS).
Sample size calculations were based on the proportion of participants with no 
change or a reduction from Baseline in the number of gadolinium -enhancing 
(GdE) MRI lesions 12months after initiating ofatumumab therapy. Three 
precision estimates were considered for this study: 
A sample size of 100 participants will provide an 8.5% precision (half -width of 
95% confidence interval), a 7.8% precision, or a 7.0% precision corresponding to 
estimated proportions of 75%, 80%, and 85% , respectively, of participants
achieving the primary  endpoint.
For the purpose of earlier dissemination of data, an interim analy sis will be 
performed on all enrolled participants who either meet the criteria of at least 6 
months treatment or discontinued treatment prematurely. For this analy sis, only 
primary  variables, demographics, basel ine characteristics, adverse events and 
serious adverse events will be summarized.
Since there will be no hypothesis testing involved, statistical adjustment for the 
interim analy sis will not be made at the stage of final analy ses of efficacy  and 
safety.

1 Introduction
1.1 Background
Multiple sclerosis (MS), one of the most co mmon causes of neurological disability in young 
adults, is the prototypic acquired inflammatory demyelinating condition of the central nervous system (CNS), characterized by [CONTACT_2898], demyelination and axonal/neuronal destruction, ultimately leading to severe disability in the majority of patients.
While traditional research has focused on the role of T cells for MS, pathogenic B cells are 
known to play an early role in theimmune-mediated pathogenesis ofMS ( Archelos et al 2000, 
Frohman et al 2006, McFarland 2008 ).  B cells, acting in concert with T cells have beenfound 
to be required for full disease expression ( Genain and Hauser 1996) , with essential functionsin 
regulating immune response.  B cells may contribute to disease pathogenesis by [CONTACT_6270]-antigen presentation, serving as cellular adjuvants for cluster of differentiation (CD) 4+ T-cell activation (Bouaziz et al 2007 ) and by [CONTACT_52361] T-cell function and inflammation via cytokine 
production (Lund 2008), in addition to producing autoantibodies. B-cells are present in chronic

et al 2013).These observations have provided a new theoretical framework for the use of B
cellbased therapeutics in MS.
Selectively targeting B cells with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies has been proven highly 
effective at limiting disease activity in patientswith relapsing forms of MS
1. Rituximab and 
ocrelizumab are anti-CD20-directed cytolytic antibodies that have been investigated in MS. Clinical evidence from randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 studies with the chimericmouse/human anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) rituximab( Hauser et al 2008 )and the
humanized anti-CD20 mAb ocrelizumab ( Kappos et al 2011 )showed B-cell depletion by [CONTACT_188621]-measured inflammatory activity in RMS participants.  Recently,the efficacy of ocrelizumab was confirmed in two Phase 3 trials in  participants with 
RMS(Hauser et al 2017 ). These studies showed that ocrelizumab significantly reduced relapse 
rates, reduced MRI disease activity and delaye d the time to disability worsening versus 
interferonbeta 1a over 2 years. Ocrelizumab was well tolerated with no major safety findings reported inthese clinical trials.
While ocrelizumab has received FDA approval in 2017(Ocrevus prescribing information; 
Hauser et al 2017 )for the treatment of adult patientswith relapsing or primary progressive 
forms of multiple sclerosis, rituximab has not.  Nonetheless, rituximab has been utilized in the real-world setting as off-label treatment for MS patients in the US. Both rituximab and ocrelizumab are delivered in a clinical setting by [CONTACT_33980] (iv) infusion. Rituximab is given off-label in a range of doses. A typi[INVESTIGATOR_188582] 500-1,000 mg infusions on Day 1 and Day 15 followed by a 1,000 mg infusion every six months. Ocrelizumab is initiated with 300 mg infusions on Day 1 and Day 15, and maintained with a 600 mg infusion every six months. The real-world utilization of both rituximab and ocrelizumab in the US is common and ocrelizumab use has continued to increase since its 2017 approval for relapsing and primary progressive forms of MS. However, the real world safety, tolerability and continued access to these anti-CD20 (aCD20) therapi[INVESTIGATOR_188583]. Furthermore, clinical evidence demonstrating whether MS patientscan be transitioned from IV aCD20 antibody therapy to ofatumumab is not yet available.

Ofatumumab isa fully human aCD20 mAb that induces B cell lysisvia complement -depe ndent 
cyto
toxicity  (CDC) and antibody -dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity  (ADCC) (Teeling et al 
2006).  Ofatumumab recognizes an epi[INVESTIGATOR_188584] 2 
extracellular domains of the CD20 molecule, N
-proximal of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_188585]–CD20mAb 
rituximab.  Preclinical differentiation between aCD20 mAb suggests a favorable profile of 
ofatumumab including 
higher CDC (Pacheco- Fernandez et al 2018), direct lymph node 
targeting (Torres et al 2019 ) and potential sparing of marginal zone B cells, which are relev
ant 
for host defense (Theil et al 2019 ).  The clinical correlates of these preclinical findings remain 
to be explored in Ph3b/[ADDRESS_222648] on inflammatory  lesions when 
given subcutaneousl y
(Sorensen et al 2014, Bar-Oret al 2018 ).In the head -to-head phase III 
clinical trials, ASCLEPI[CONTACT_70112] I and II (COMB157G2301 and COMB157G2302, respectivel y), 
monthly  subcutaneous ofatumumab 20mg demonstrated superiorit y over once daily  oral 
teriflunomide 14mg in participants with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. Both studies met 
the primary  endpoints where ofatumumab showed a highl y significant and clinically  meaningful 
reduction in the number of confirme d relapses, evaluated as the annualized relapse rate (ARR). 
Specificall y, RMS participants on ofatumumab had a reduction in annualized relapse rate 
(ARR) by 50.5% (0.11 vs. 0.22) and 58.5% (0.10 vs. 0.25) compared to teriflunomide (both 
studies p<0.001) inASCL EPI[CONTACT_70112] I and II studies respectivel y (Hauser et
al2019). Key 
secondary  endpoints were also met, where ofatumumab showed a relative risk reduction of 
34.4% in 3-month confirmed disability  (CDW) (p=0.002) and 32.5% in 6-month CDW
(p=0.012) versus teriflunomide in a pre
-specified pooled anal yses.
In the ASCL EPI[INVESTIGATOR_188586] ,ofatumumab was subcutaneousl y administered via pre-filled 
syringe (PFS). In the APLIOS Phase II study  (COMB157G2102), the autoinjector (AI) pen was 
compared with the pre-filled syringe (PFS) in a 12 week randomized open label multicenter 
study  to demonstrate bioequivalence (Bar-Or et al 2020). The current study  will utilize the 
ofatumumab 
AIpento facilitate impro ved self -and home -administration and hence reduce the 
participant burden of treatment.
Notably , theASCLEPI[INVESTIGATOR_188587] (~60% and 40%, respectively ), but excluded participants with prior aCD20 mAb exposure
(including rituximab and ocrelizumab) from study  participation. Therefore, an evidence gap 
remains whether RMS participants discontinuing aCD20 mAb therap y might experience 
therapeutic benefit from treatment transition to ofatumumab. This study aims to explore 
whether ofatumumab is e ffective, safe , tolerable ,and has better Participant satisfaction in these 
RMS participants.
1.2 Purpose
The purpose of the study  is to complement theofatumumab Phase 3 program by [CONTACT_188622] , participant retention and satisfaction, as well as safet y and 
tolerability  for ofatumumab 20mg subcutaneous administered via 
the AI pen once monthly in 
participants with relapsing forms of MS who transition from aCD20 mAb therap y.
The primary  outcome will be to explore maintenance of efficacy  evaluated by [CONTACT_188623]
(gadolinium enhancing T1 lesions) at 12months after initiating ofatumumab therap y vs baseline
in RMS participants transitioning to ofatumumab from aCD20 therap y (for reasons other than

relapsing MS participants as measured by [CONTACT_188624] 12months after switching from an intravenous aCD20 mAb for reasons other than efficacy  
or safet y.
The justification for the primary  estimand is that it will capture whether or not participants can 
be maintained on subcutaneous ofatumumab after documented stable, effective treatment with 
an intravenous aCD20 mAb, a scenario that is a real life question in the MS community  where 
continued access to an infusion suite may  not be possible or desired.
The primary  estimand is described by  [CONTACT_6570]:
Population : relapsing MS 
Participants currentl y treated with an infused aCD20 mAb, 
specificall y ocrelizumab or rituximab, that have received at least 2 courses of therap y, that 
are switching due to reasons other than safety  or efficacy . Further details abo ut the 
population are provided in Section 5.
Variable :no change or a reduction in gadolinium enhancing lesions on MRI at Month 12
(yes/no).
Treatment of interest : following a loading dose regimen consisting of once daily  doses
on day s 1, 7 and 14
, ofatumumab is given once mont hlystarting at Month 1 . All doses of 
ofatumumab will be given subcutaneousl y via an autoinjector at a dose of 20mg. Further 
details about the investigational treatment are provided in Section 6.

this study , participants may enroll only if discontinuing aCD20 therapy  for reasons other than 
lack of efficacy  or due to certain treatment -emergent adverse events. Reasons for switching 
may include but are not limited to physician/ participant preference, access to commercial drug 
(e.g. insurance coverage issues) or for other logistical reasons (such as geographical relocation, 
travel, etc.) A total of approximately  100eligible participants will receive open label 
ofatumumab 20 mg subcutaneous once monthly for 12 months following initial loading regimen 
of 
20 mg subcutaneous doses on Day s 1, 7 and 1 4.  
Assessments will be done per the assessment schedules ( Table 8
-1and Table 8 -2).
For participants who discontinue study  treatment prematurel y for any reason before the end of 
the treatm ent phase, an End of Study  visit must beperformed within 7 days of study 
discontinuation.
Upon completing the study ,
participants may continue ofatu mumab therap y on commercial

Safety follow -up: 
The Safet y follow- up (FU) period will be applicable for the following participants: 
participants who complete the Treatment period on the study drug and do not 
continue on any MS DMT .
participants who prematurely  discontinue study  drug and do not continue on any  
MS DMT.
All Safety  FU visits must be scheduled relative to the End of Study  (EOS) Visit.
Participants that do not continue into the ofatumumab commercia l patient services hub within 
onemonth of the EOS Visit or that do not switch to another

[ADDRESS_222653] routine clinical setting and care, especiall y for RMS participants transitio ning 
from intravenous aCD20 mAbs to ofatumumab.  To further elucidate the effectiveness of 
transitioning to ofatumumab , additional data from participant registries or other data sources 
may be utilized.
Rationale of study population:
The study  includes RMS participants who are transitioning from rituximab or oc relizumab for 
reasons other than lack of efficacy (defined as documented relapse while on previous aCD20 
treatment, or signs of MRI  activity , defined as ≥ 2 active Gd+ T1 lesions, or any  new or newl y 
enlarging T2 lesions or change in EDSS ) or due to certain treatment -
emergent adverse events. 
These criteria have been implemented to further characterize the benefits of treatment with 
ofatumumab in a RMS population who alread y have achieved st able disease activit y with other 
anti-CD20 mAbs which have demonstrated strong reductions in relapses and Gd T1 lesions and 
new and/or enlarging T2 lesions on MRI . 
Exclusion of participants who have breakthrough disease with rituximab or ocrelizumab
redu
ces the potential forenrolling participants who may not respond to aCD20 mAb therap y . 
Additional exclusion criteria, relating to certain treatment -emergent adverse events on 
rituximab or ocrelizumab , concomitant diseases, laboratory  parameters, and previous 
medications help to ensure participants safet y in the study .
Rationale of chosen end p
oints:
The proposed stud y endpoints are widel y accepted as clinicall y relevant and have been used in 
numerous pi[INVESTIGATOR_169579]
s in relapsing MS. The primary  endpoint for the study  will be no 
change or a reduction in the number of gadolinium enhancing lesions observed by [CONTACT_66577] 12
months of ofatumumab treatment vs baseline . Key secondary  endpoints will include participant
retention, immune biomarkers, treatment satisfaction, and safet y and tolerability  at 6 and 12 
months after transitioning to ofatumumab. In two large phase 3studies, ofatumumab 
demonstrated a significant reduction in disease activity  (reductions in relapses, Gd T1 lesions 
and new and/or enlarging T2 lesions) versus an active compa rator.
This study  aims to provide clinical evidence supplementing the phase 3 program by  [CONTACT_188625] y data of ofatumumab in aRMS participant population that is switchin g 
aCD20 treatment . This evidence is highly  relevant for neurologists and treating healthcare 
practitioners in the real world setting.   Aplanned analy sis for the primary  endpoint at six months 
will provide earl y and important data to the health care community  about the effectiveness and 
safet y of ofatumumab in 
participants transitioning from other aCD20 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].

4.2 Rationale for dose/regimen and duration of treatment
Ofatumumab dose
The dose regimen for ofatumumab for this study  is aloading dose regimen of 20 mg at Day  1, 
Day 7and Day 14, followed by a  monthl y maintenance dose regimen of 20 mg administered 
once monthly starting at Month 1 . 
This dose regimen is consistent with the USPI [INVESTIGATOR_188588] 3 
development program of ofatumumab in RMS.
Duration of treatment
Treatment duration within the study  will be 12 months. 
4.3 Rationale for choice of control drugs (comparator/placebo) or 
combination drugs
No comparator arm will be implemented.
4.4 Purpose and timing of i nterim analy ses/design adaptations
The sponsor will conduct a ninterim analysis once 100% of enrolled participants have reached 
approximately  [ADDRESS_222654] been 
exposed to ofatumumab in total.No unexpected safet y findings were observed in MS 
participants who received ofatumumab in the completed studies. 
In the 48-week, placebo -controlled, cross - over study  (cross- over at 24 weeks) of intravenous 
doses of ofatumumab up to 700 mg, adverse events reported more frequently  on ofatumumab 
vs placebo included: rash, throat irritation, erythema, fatigue, viral infection and flushing
(Sorensen et al 2014 ). In the placebo- controlled, dose-ranging study  of ofatumumab 
administered at subcutaneous doses up to 60 mg every  4 weeks for up to 24 weeks, injection 
related reactions were observed more frequently  in the overall ofatumumab group 
(Bar-Oret al 2018 ).  A 12-week study  performed to demonstrate bioequivalence between 
ofatumumab 20mg administered subcutaneous via either pre-
filled s yringe or autoinjector pen
exposed 284 RMS participants to study  drug. This study  also showed that adverse events and 
serious adverse events were overall low in ofatumumab -treated participants and there were no 
unexpected safety  signals (Bar-Or 2020). Inthe ASCL EPI[CONTACT_70112] I and II studies, ofatumumab 

[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 29
Amended Protocol Version No. 0 2 (clean ) Protocol No. COMB157GUS07
demonstrated a favorable safet y profile with no unexpected safet y signals, and no imbalance in 
adverse events or serious adverse events, rates of infection (including serious infection) or 
malignancy  when compare d to teriflunomide. In the studies, systemic injection -related 
reactions were reported in 20.6% of participants on ofatumumab and in 15.3% of participants
on teriflunomide. Nearl y all ( 99%) reported s ystemic injection reactions were mild to moderate 
(Grade 1 -2) and were generall y limited to the first injection.
Ofatumumab subcutaneous has demonstrated profound suppression of new MRI  lesion activity 
(≥ 90% versus placebo over Weeks 4-12) in relapsing MS participants in a Phase 2 study . In 
the Phase 3 studies, ofatumumab showed a highl y significant and clinically  meaningful 
reduction in the number of confirmed relapses, evaluated as the annualized relapse rate (ARR). 
Participants treated with of atumumab had an ARR of 0.11 and 0.10 compared to teriflunomide 
(ARR of 0.22 and 0.25) in ASCL EPI[CONTACT_70112] I and II respectivel y, corresponding to a reduction in 
ARR by 50.5% and 58.8% with ofatumumab (p<0.001 in both studies). Ofatumumab showed 
highl y significant suppression of both Gd+ T1 lesions and new or enlarging T2 lesions 
compared to teriflunomide, demonstrating a profound suppression of new inflammatory  activit y. 
Additionally , ofatumumab showed a relative risk reduction of 34.4% (p=0.002) in 3-month 
confir med disability  worsening 
(CDW†) and 32.5% (p=0.012) in 6-month CDWversus 
teriflunomide in pre-
specified pooled analy ses (Hauser et al 2019). Taken together, available 
information of relevant clinical and MRI  outcome s
supports the potential efficacy  of 
ofatumumab in participants with relapsing MS.
In the study  described here, RMS participants transitioning to ofatumumab , will have been 
previous ly expos ed to a minimum of
[ADDRESS_222655] that rituximab safety and efficacy in a heterogeneous RMS 
population areconsistent with randomized controlled trials 
(Salzer et al 2016; Hauser et al 2008) . 
The most common ty pes of AEs and SAEs were infections
; infusion- related reactions occurred 
in 7.8% of infusions and most commonly  during the first 3 infusions (Salzer et al2016).  In 
RRMS, rituxumab also demonstrated clinical efficacy  in the form of
alow ARR of (0.044), a 
low incidence of contrast -enhancing lesions (4.6%) and the 
median EDSS remained stable from 
baseline.
Ocrelizumab safet y and efficacy  has been previously  published (Hauser et al2017 ) 
demonstrating that infusion- related reactions occur in 34.3% of participants, serious infections 
occurred in 1.3% of participants and neoplasms occurred 0.5% of participants . Efficacy 
outcomes from the ocrelizumab pi[INVESTIGATOR_188589], 
risk of confirmed disability  progression, and MRI  lesions were significantly  decreased 
compared to interferon beta -1a in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_6518].
While RMS participants in this study  must be discontinuing rituximab or ocrelizumab treatment 
for reasons other than safety , thepotential safet y risks associated with those therapi[INVESTIGATOR_188590].
There is currently no information about whether the transition from aCD20 mAbs to 
ofatumumab can be performed safel y with acceptable efficacy  outcomes for RMS participants.

discussed with the participant and investigator. Participants who terminate prior to the endof 
the treatment period or who withdraw permanently  due to ofatumumab related AE or SAE 
should follow up with their primary  neurologist for continued treatment options as quickly  as 
possible.
6.2 Other treatment(s)
6.2.[ADDRESS_222669] the participant to notify  the study  site about any new 
medications he/she takes after study  enrollment. All medications, procedures, and significant 
non-drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (including physical therap y and blood transfusions) administered after the 
participant was enrolled int o the study  must be recorded on the appropriate Case Report Forms.
Each concomitant drug must be individually  assessed against all exclusion criteria/prohibited 
medication. If in doubt, the Investigator should contact [CONTACT_188629] a participant or allowing a new medication to be started. If the participant is alread y 
enrolled, contact [CONTACT_188630] .
If a participant is receiving dalfampridine (Ampy ra®/Fam pyra®)concomitantly  with study 
treatment, the participant should have been on a stable dose at least [ADDRESS_222670] study  
drug administration and remain on that dose throughout the study  wherever possible.
Premedication prior to subcutaneous injection
Premedication is not required. Premedication with acetaminophen and/or antihistamines (or 
equivalent) is optional and may be administered at the discretion of the Investigator . For the 
first injection of treatment period (Day  1), the addition ofpremedication with steroids 
(methy lprednisolone 100 mg iv or equivalent) is an additional consideration. If Investigator s 
choose to administer premedication, it should be administered [ADDRESS_222671] (refer to Section 6.7.2). 
Based on the experience with the injection (s)administered at the site and with the use of any 
premedication, the Investigator will evaluate whether or not premedication (such as 
acetaminophen and/or antihistamines) should be used before injections administered at home. 
If premedication is prescribed, the study  staff must ensure that the participant will receive a 
sufficient suppl y of premedication for home -use (i.e. 
to last at least until the next study  office 
visit) and clear inst ructions (oral and written) about ty pe and dose of premedication, and when 
to take it (i.e. 30-60 min before the injection). The Investigator will evaluate the need for 
premedication, or a change in the prescription, at each visit (scheduled and unschedule d) 
including at the monthly  
participant contacts during the study  (contact [CONTACT_188631] -
related symptoms and the use of premedication). I f, based on the 
remote contacts, a change in pre- medication may  be needed, the participant should be asked to 
return to the site for an unscheduled visit.

[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 37

The participants must be informed (through the participant information and consent process) 
about the possibility  that injection related reactions might occur despi[INVESTIGATOR_188594] a systemic injection reaction and their management. 
Furthermore, p articipants must be informed that the use of steroid premedication may  increase 
the occurrence of premedication related adverse events i.e.flushing, chest discomfort, 
hypertension, tach ycardia, and abdominal pain. Participants must be reminded to always carry 
their Participant Card, which includes the Invest igator and site telephone contact [CONTACT_188632] .

6.2.3 Recommended treatment of MS Relapse
The decision to treat MS relapses should be based on the Investigator 's judgement and/or local 
clinical practice. If MSrelapses require treatment, the standard treatment should consist of a 
short course of corticos teroids of 3-5days and up to 1000mg methy lprednisolone/day  or 
equivalent on an inpatient or outpatient basis.Standard of care will be followed during 
treatment as per local clinical practice.
Taper with oral steroids is not permitted. Plasmapheresis may be used only if participant does 
not respond to standard treatment with corticosteroids.
Investigator s should consider the added immunosuppressive effects of corticosteroid therap y 
and increase vigilance regarding infections during such treatment and in the weeks following 
administration.
Use of steroids for treatment of MS attack/relapse must be recorded on the Concomitant 
Medications eCRF. 
Please refer to restrictions for MRI  inSection 8.3.1 concerning the use of

MRI  scans will be read by [CONTACT_188648]. Prior to the start of the study , MRI 
technician from each center will receive an MRI Manual, outlining technical implementation, 
image quality  requirements and MRI  administrative procedures.
The site will be asked to program the MRI scanne r that is designated for evaluation of the study 
participants. Site will be asked to perform and submit a dummy scan (so called “dummy or dry 
run”) to the central MRI  reading center to assess the image quality  and to evaluate the 
compatibility  of the elect ronic data carrier. Once the dummy  run has been accepted, all the 
parameter settings for the study  specific MRI sequences must remain unchanged for the 
duration of the study . Finally , if the site is already pre-approved for performing conventional 
MRI  scan sequences b y the imaging vendor the dummy  or dry  run may  be skipped.
Each MRI scan performed for the study  needs to be previewed by a
 local neuro radiologist. 
During the study , the quality  of each scan performed will be assessed by [CONTACT_188649]. The MRI  scan should be sent to the central MRI  reading center upon completion of each 
individual scan. As soon as the scan is received by [CONTACT_188648], it will be 
evaluated for qualit y, completeness and adherence to the protocol. Confirmation of MRI quality 
or a description of the quality  problems, if detected, will be communicated to the site. I f a scan 
is incomplete or incorrectly  performed, the study  center will be asked to repeat it as soon as 
possible. After completion of thequality  check, all scans will be analy zed according to the MRI 
protocol.
Restrictions to MRI schedule
To avoid interferences caused by [CONTACT_188650] (inregards toGd+-enhancing lesions) for the 
treatment of MS relapse, the following restrictions apply  for this study :
In case of relapse, if an MRI has been scheduled within 30days of the initiation of steroid 
treatment, MRI (with Gd+ enhancement) should be performed before steroid treatment is 
initiated.
No MRI  should be performed while a participant is on steroid therap y and within the 
following 
30days upon termination of steroid treatment.
Because of these restrictions, MRI scheduling can be adjusted accordingly. In case a visit is 
performed outside the visit window, any subsequent visits should be performed according to 
the original visit schedule.
Scanning
All sequences/scans will be performed according to the study  MRI manual.
MRI  scan sequences ,such as but not limited to, will include conventional MRI measures of T1 
hypointense images (with and without contrast medium, i.e., gadolinium -DTPA), and  
 
The gadolinium contrast medium may occasionally  cause nausea and vomiting. Allergic 
reactions may also occur ver y rarely and, in extremely rare instances, can be potentially serious 
and require immediate anti anaphy lactic treatment. Any AE experience due to the contrast 
medium should be recorded on the AE eCRF.

8.3.5 Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication TSQM - 9
The Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM -9) will be used to evalua te 
the participants’ s atisfaction with Ofatumumab.  The TSQM -9 is a ps ychometricall y sound and 
valid participant reported outcome to measure participants’ satisfaction with medication and a 
good predictor of adherence across different types of medication a
nd participant population .  
The TSQM -9 is a 9 item questionnaire having a global satisfaction score ranging from 0-100. 
The questionnaire consists of 3 domains: satisfaction
,convenience and effectiveness (3 items 
each). The domain scores range from 0 to 100 with higher scores representing higher 
satisfaction on that domain. ( Bharmal et al. 2009 )

an Adverse Event must be recorded on the adverse events eCRF.
8.4.2 Electrocardiogram (ECG)
All ECG swill be locally  collected a nd evaluated for the eligibility  assessment at the Screening 
visit. Another ECG will be performed at thebaseline and EOS visit.   Additional unplanned 
ECGs may be performed at the Investigator's discretion if clinically  indicated . Interpretation of 
the tracing must be made by a qualified physician and documented on the appropriate CRF. 
Each ECG tracing should be labeled with the study  number, participant initials (where 
regulations permit), participant number, date, and kept in the source documents at the study  site. 
Clinically  significant abnormalities present at screening should be reported on the appropriate 
CRF. Clinically  significant findings must be discussed with [COMPANY_001] prior to enrolling the 
participant in the study. New or worsened clinically  significant findings occurring after 
informed consent must be recorded as adverse events.
Single 12 lead ECGs are collected.  The ECG should be recorded (after [ADDRESS_222682] in the 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_188597] a stable reading) according to the local site practice. 
Clinically significant ECG findings at Screening must be discussed with the [COMPANY_001] Medical 
Advisor before administration of study  drug.  
The preferred sequence of cardiovascular data collect ion during study  visits are ECG c ollection 
first, followed by [CONTACT_188651].  The Fridericia's QT correction formula 
(QTcF) should be used for clinical decisions.
The original ECGs on non- heat- sensitive paper (or a certified copy on non- heat- sensitive paper), 
appropriatel y signed must be archi ved at the study site.  
Findings and clinicall y significant abnormalities must be recorded on the relevant section of the

8.4.3 Vital Signs
Vital signs will include siting pulse rate (measured as radial pulse for 60 seconds), sitting 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure and body  temperature (oral, or per local practice and should 
be recorded in the relevant CRF page in Celsius) which will be assessed at the visits indicated 
inTable 8-1 andTable 8 -2.

[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 58
Amended Protocol Version No. 0 2 (clean ) Protocol No. COMB157GUS07
After the participant has been sitting for five minutes, with back supported and both feet placed 
on the floor, systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be measured three times using an 
automated 
validated device, e.g. OMRON, with an appropriatel y sized cuff. At thebaseline
visit only , systolic and diastolic blood pressure should be measured 3 times. The repeat sitting 
measurements will be made at 1 - 2 minute intervals and the mean of the three measurements 
will be used.  In case the cuff sizes available are not large enough for the participant 's arm 
circumference, a sph ygmomanometer with an appropriatel y sized cuff may be used.
Vital signs should be obtained 30-60 (+/-10min) minutes before the subcutaneous injection
(study  drug).  If premedication is required , the vital signs should be taken prior to premedication 
administration.
8.4.4 Height and Weight

9 D iscontinuation and completion
9.1 Discontinuation from study  treatment and study
9.1.1 Discontinuation of study treatment
Discontinuation of study  drug for a participant occurs when study  drug is permanently  stopped 
for any reason (prior to the planned completion of study  drug administration, if any), and can 
be initiated by  [CONTACT_188652].
The Investigator must discontinue study treatment for a given participant if he/she believes that 
continuation would negatively  affect the participant's well -being.
Discontinuation from s
tudy treatment is required under the following circumstances:
Participant /guardian decision ( Section 9.2) 
Pregnancy (Section 10.1.6 and Section 10.1.7) 
Use of prohibited treatment ( Section
6.2.2)
Diagnosis of PML
Participants with active serious infections or reactivation (e.g. tuberculosis, hepatitis B or 
C)
Skin and/or mucosal reactions which raise the suspi[INVESTIGATOR_188598] (Stevens -Johnson sy ndrome, or toxi cepi[INVESTIGATOR_188599]
-Lyell's sy ndrome)
Hypersensitivity  to the study  medication
Any situation in which continued study  participation might result in a safety  risk to the 
participant
Protocol violation that results in a significant risk to the participant 's safety
Emergence of certain advers e events, such as malignancy  (except successfully  treated 
basal cell carcinoma, in situ squamous cell carcinoma and in situ carcinoma of cervix of 
uterus), liver failure or serious chronic infection (such as human immunodeficiency  virus 
(HIV))
Laboratory  abnormalities (e.g. liver functions tests (LFTs) and abnormal test procedure 
defined in Appendix 1 ( Section 16.1)
Severe h ypoproteinemia
Interstitial lung disease or new onset or worsening of pulmonary  symptoms, such as 
persi stent cough and d yspnea, with or without associated fever, suspi[INVESTIGATOR_188600]
Non-compliance with study  drug or study  procedures
Study  treatment discontinuation should be considered under the following circumstances:
For participants who meet the criterion for 6 -month confirmed disability  worsening 
onEDSS (see Section 10.1.5 )during the study , the Investigator must reassess the benefits 
and risks of continuing study  treatment.  
The Investigator will also discuss the further 
treatment with the participant , including an y other MS treatment options that may be 
available to the participant.  The outcome of the discussion with the participant must be 
documented in the participant 's source information

[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 62
Amended Protocol Version No. 0 2 (clean ) Protocol No. COMB157GUS07
In case the Investigator deems the benefit- risk of continuing study  treatment to be 
unfavorable or if the participant does not wish to continue study  treatment and the 
participant does not initiate a commercial MS disease modify ing therapy , the participan t 
will be discontinued from the study  and will enter the Safet y Follow -up period           
(Table 8
-2).  
If discontinuation fromstudy  treatment occurs, the Investigator should make a reasonable effort 
to understand the primary reason for the participant ’s discontinuation fromstudy treatment and 
record this information.
Participants who discontinue from study  treatment agree to return for the end of treatment and 
follow -up visits indicated in the Assessment Schedule (see Table 8-1). Participants that 
discontinue treatment and do not initiate a commercial MS disease modify ing therap y should 
complete the EOS visit and move to the Safety  Follow -
up as perTable 8-2.  If they fail to return 
for these assessments for unknown reasons, every effort (e.g. telephone, e
-mail, letter) should 
be made to contact [CONTACT_2299] /pre-designated contact [CONTACT_188653] 9.1.3.  This 
contact [CONTACT_18616].
If the participant cannot or is unwilling to attend any visit(s), the site staff should maintain 
regular contact [CONTACT_6635] , or with a person pre-designated by [CONTACT_2299] .  This 
contact [CONTACT_37283] y be done according to the study visit schedule for up to 6months post 
last study  drug administration.
After discontinuation from study  treatment at a minimum, in abbreviated visits, the following 
data should be collected at clinic visits or via telephone/email contact:
New / concomitant treatments
Adverse Events / Serious Adverse Events
The Investigator must also contact [CONTACT_6637] ’s discontinuation from 
study  drug.
9.1.2 Discontinuation from study  
Discontinuation from study  is when the participant permanentl y stops receiving the stud y 
treatment, and further protocol- required assessments or follow -up, for an y reason. If the 
participant agrees, a final evaluation at the time of the participant’s study  discontinuation
should be made as detailed in the assessment table ( refer to Section 8 )
.
9.1.[ADDRESS_222687] to follow -up
For participants whose status is unclear because they  fail to appear for study  visits without 
stating an intention to discontinue from study  treatment or discontinue from study  or 
withdraw consent/oppose to the use of their data/biological samples, the Investigator must 
show "due diligence" b y documenting in the source documents steps taken to contact [CONTACT_2416] , e.g. dates of telephone calls, registered letters, etc. A participant should not be 
considered as lost to follow -up until due diligence has been completed or un til the end of the 
study .

[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 63
Amended Protocol Version No. 0 2 (clean ) Protocol No. COMB157GUS07
9.2 Withdrawal of informed consent /Opposition to use
Participants may voluntarily  withdraw consent to participate in the study  for any  reason at any 
time. Withdrawal of consent occurs onl y when a participant :
Does not want to participate in the study  anymore, and
Does not allow further visits or assessments, and 
Does not want an y further study related contacts
This request should be in writing (depending on local regulations) and recorded in the source 
documentation.
In this situation, the Investigator should make a reasonable effort (e.g. telephone, e -mail, letter) 
to understand the primary  reason for the Participant ’s decision to withdraw his/her 
consent /opposition to use data/biological samples and record this infor mation.
Where consent to the use of personal and coded data is not required, participant therefore cannot 
withdraw consent.  Howev
er, they  still retain the right to object to the further collection or use 
of personal data.
Study  treatment must be discontin ued and no further assessments conducted, and the data that 
would have been collected at subsequent visits will be considered missing.
Further attempts to contact [CONTACT_131359] -up.
All efforts should be made to complete the assessments prior to study withdrawal. If the 
participant agrees, afinal evaluation at the time of the participant ’s withdrawal of 
consent/opposition to use data/biological samples should be made as detailed in the assessment 
table (section 8 )
[COMPANY_001] will continue to retain and use all research results (data) that have alread y been 
collected for the study  evaluation including
processing of biological samples that has alread y 
started atthe time of consent withdrawal/opposition.  No new Personal Data (including
biological samples) will be collected following withdrawal of consent/opposition according to 
applicable law.
For US: All biological samples not yet analyzed at the time of withdr awal may  still be used for 
further testing/anal ysis in accordance with the terms of this protocol and of the informed consent 
form.

End of Study  (EOS) visit is mandatory  for all participants. For participants that complete the 
study , the next (and last) scheduled visit is the EOS visit and should align with the overall visit 
schedule. Participants will then enter the Safety  Follow -
up according to the assessment 
schedule inTable 8-2if they do not initiate a commercial MS disease modify ing therapy.   
Participants who prematurely discontinue study  treatment will have their EOS visit as soon as 
possible and continue into the Safet yFollow -up for 6months according to the assessment 
schedule in Table [ADDRESS_222689] refer them for appropriate ongoing care.
9.4 Early study  termination by  [CONTACT_188654]. This may  include reasons 
related to the benefit/ risk assessment of participating in the study , practical reasons (including 
slow enrollment), or for regulatory  or medical reasons. In taking the decision to terminate, 
[COMPANY_001] will alway s consider the participant welfare and safet y. Should early  termination be 
necessary , participants must be seen as soon as possible and treated as a prematurely  withdrawn 
participant .
The Investigato r may be informed of additional procedures to be followed in order to ensure 
that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the participant
’s interests. The 
Investigator or sponsor depending on the local regulation will be responsible for inform ing 
IRBs/IECs of the earl y termination of the trial
10 Safety  monitoring and reporting
10.1 Definition of adverse events and reporting requirements
10.1.1 Adverse events
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g. any unfavorable and 
unintended sign [i ncluding abnormal laboratory findings], sy mptom or disease) in a participant
or clinical investigation participant after providing written informed consent for participation 
in the study . Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally  or causall y associated with the 
use of a medicinal (investigational) product.
In addition, all reports of intentional misuse and abuse of the product are 
also considered an 
adverse event irrespective of if a clinical event has occurred.
[COMPANY_001] qualified medical personnel will be readily  available to advise on trial related medical 
questions or problems.
The occurrence of adverse events must be sought by [CONTACT_105]-directive questioning of the participant
at each visit during the study . Adverse events also may  be detected when they  are volunteered 

[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 65
Amended Protocol Version No. 0 2 (clean ) Protocol No. COMB157GUS07
by [CONTACT_6643], laboratory 
test findings, or other assessments.
Abnormal laboratory  values or test results constitute adverse event only if they fulfill at least 
one of the following criteria:
they induce clinical signs or sy mptoms
they are considered clinically  significant
they require therapy
Clinically  significant abnormal laboratory  values or test results must be identified through a 
review of values outside of normal ranges/clinically  notable ranges, significant changes from 
baseline or the previous visit, or values, which are considered non-typi[INVESTIGATOR_188601]. Investigator s have the responsibility  for managing the safet y of 
individual participant and identify ing adverse events. Clinically notable laboratory findings are 
defined according to the Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) (the 
most current version will be used and can be found on the following web-site: 
http://
ctep.cancer.gov).
Adverse events must be recorded under the signs, symptoms, or diagnosis associated with them, 
accompanied by [CONTACT_6644] (as far as possible) (if the event is serious refer to 
Section 10.1.2):
The Common Toxicity  Criteria (CTC) AE grade (1
-4)
If CTCAE grading does not exist for an adverse event, use:
1 = mild: usually  transient in nature and generall y not interfering with normal activities
2 = moderate: sufficiently  discomforting to interfer e with normal activities
3 = severe: prevents normal activities
4 = life -threatening
Its relationship to the study  treatment.
Its duration (start and end dates) or if the event is ongoing, an outcome of not 
recovered/not resolved must be reported
Whether i t constitutes a SAE (see Section 10.1.2 for definition of SAE) and which 
seriousness criteria have been met
Action taken regarding with study  treatment
All adverse events must be treated appropriately . Treatment may include one or more of the 
following:
No action taken (e.g. further observation only )
Drug interrupted/withdrawn
Concomitant medication or non- drug therap y given
Participant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/ participant 's hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18533] (see Section 10.1.2 for 
definition of SAE)
Its outcome (not recovered/not resolved; recovered/resolved; recovered/resolved 
with sequelae; fatal; or unknown).

[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 66
Amended Protocol Version No. 0 2 (clean ) Protocol No. COMB157GUS07
Conditions that were alread y present at the time of informed consent should be recorded in 
medical history  of the participant .
Adverse events (including lab abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be described using a 
diagnosis whenever possible, rather than individual underly ing signs and s ymptoms.
Adverse event monitoring should be continued following the last dose of study  treatment until 
the 
participant starts a commercially  available MS disease modify ing therapy  or until their B 
cells are repleted.  Repletion is defined as a concentration > the participant ’s baseline value
prior to starting the IV anti-CD20 mAb or > thelower limit of normal, whichever is observed 
first.
Once an adverse event is detected, it must be followed unt il its resolution or until it is judged to 
be permanent (e.g. continuing at the end of the study ), and assessment must be made at each 
visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of an y changes in severity, the suspected relationship to 
the interventions requ ired to treat it, and the outcome.
Information 
about adverse drug reactions for the investigational drug (ofatumumab) can be 
found in the Investigator 's Brochure (IB). This information will be included in the participant
informed consent and should be disc ussed with the participant during the study as needed. An y 
new information regarding the safet y profile of ofatumumab that is identified between IB 
updates will be communicated as appropriate, for example, via an Investigator Notification or 
an Aggregate Safety Finding. New information might require an update to the informed consent 
and has then to be discussed with the participant .
The Investigator must also instruct each participant to report any new adverse event (beyond 
the protocol observation period) that the participant , or the participant 's personal physician, 
believes might reasonably  be related to study  treatment. This information must be recorded in 
the Investigator ’s source 
documents; however, if the AE meets the criteria of an SAE, it must 
be re ported to [COMPANY_001].
10.1.2 Serious adverse events
An SAE is defined as any adverse event [appearance of (or worsening of any pre-existing)] 
undesirable sign(s), symptom(s), or medical conditions(s) which meets any one of the following 
criteria:
fatal
life-threate ning
Life-threatening in the context of a SAE refers to a reaction in which the participant was at risk 
of death at the time of the reaction; it does not refer to a reaction that hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe (please refer t o the I CH-E2D Guidelines).
results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity
constitutes a congenital anomaly /birth defect
requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], unless 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_062]: 
routine trea tment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any  
deterioration in condition (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_188602])

[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 67
Amended Protocol Version No. 0 2 (clean ) Protocol No. COMB157GUS07
elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to the 
indication under study and has not worsened since signing the informed consent
social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_157050] ’s 
general condition
treatment on an emergency  outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any  of the 
definition
s of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]
is medically  significant, e.g. defined as an event that jeopardizes the participant or may  
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above
Medical and scien tific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other situations should 
be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be immediately 
life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_157051]. Such events should be 
considered as “medicall y significant.” Examples of such 
events are intensive treatment in an 
emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospa sm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that 
do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37209] (please refer to the ICH-
E2D Guidelines).
All malignant neoplasms will be assessed as serious under “medically  significant” if other 
seriousnes s criteria are not met.
Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also considered a 
serious adverse reaction.
All reports of intentional misuse and abuse of the product are also considered serious adverse 
event irrespecti ve if a clinical event has occurred, and are to be reported as appropriate 
according to Section 10.1.[ADDRESS_222690] be reported separatel y as a new event.
Information about all SAEs is collected and recorded on the Serious Adverse Event Report 
Form; all applicable sections of the form must be completed in order to provide a clinically 
thorough report. The Investigator must assess the relationship of each SAE to each specific 
component of study treatment ( if study  treatment consists of several components) complete the 
SAE Report Form in English, and submit the completed form within 24 hours to [COMPANY_001]. 

[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 68

Detailed instructions regarding the submission process and requirements for signature [CONTACT_188670].
Follow -up information is submitted as instructed in the Investigator folder. Each re-occurrence, 
complication, or progression of the original event must be reported as a follow -up to that event 
regardless of w hen it occurs. The follow -up information should describe whether the event has 
resolved or continues, if and how it was treated and whether the participant continued or 
withdrew from stud y participation.
If the SAE is not previously documented in the Investigator ’s Brochure or Package Insert (new 
occurrence) and is thought to be related to the study  treatment, a CMO & PS Department 
associate may urgentl y require further information from the Investigator for health authorit y 
reporting. [COMPANY_001] may need to issue an Investigator Notification (IN) to inform all 
Investigator s involved in any study with the same study  treatment that this SAE has been 
reported.
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be collected and reported to 
the 
competent authorities and relevant ethics committees in accordance with EU Guidance 
2011/C 172/01 or as per national regulatory requirements in participating countries.
Any SAEs experienced after the B cells are repleted following final study  drug administration

10.1.4 Reporting MS relapse as a SA E
MS relapses are one of the efficacy  endpoints in this study ; hence, they  are exempt from SAE 
reporting although they may meet the SAE definition on the basis that they are considered 
medically  significant and are frequentl y associated with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. These events will 
therefore be reported on the MS relapse eCRF instead of the SAE form. However, if, in the 
judgment of the Investigator , a MS relapse is unusually  severe or medically  unexpected and 
warrants specific notification, then an SAE form must becompleted and submitted according 
to SAE reporting procedures outlined above.

10.1.8 Reporting of study treatment errors including misuse/abuse
Medication errors are unintentional errors in the prescribing, dispensing, administration or 
monitoring of a medicine while under the control of a healthcare professional, patient or 
consumer (EMA) definition).
Misuse refers to situations where the medicinal product is intentionally  and inappropriatel y used 
not in accordance with the protocol.
Abuse corresponds to the persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of a medicinal product, 
which is accompanied b y harmful ph ysical or ps ychological effects.
Study  treatment errors and uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol will be recorded on 
the appropriate CRF irrespective of whether or not associ ated with an AE/SAE and reported to 
Safety  only if associated with an SAE. Misuse or abuse will be collected and reported in the 
safet y database irrespective of it being associated with an AE/SAE within 24 hours of 
Investigator ’s awareness.

10.2 Additional Safety  Monitoring
10.2.1 Liver safety monitoring
To ensure participant safety  and enhance reliability  in determining the hepatotoxic potential of 
an investigational drug, a standardized process for identification, monitoring and evaluation of 
liver events has to be followed.
The following two categories of abnormalities / adverse events have to be considered during 
the course of the study  (irrespective of whether classified/reported as AE/SAE):
Liver laboratory  triggers, which will require repeated assessments of the abnormal 
laboratory  parameter
Liver events, which will requ ire close observation, follow -up monitoring and contributing 
factors are recorded on the appropriate CRFs
Please refer to Table 16-1 in Appendix 1 for complete definitions of liver laboratory  triggers 
and liver events.

[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 71
Amended Protocol Version No. 0 2 (clean ) Protocol No. COMB157GUS07
Every  liver event defined in Table 16-1 should be followed up by [CONTACT_188656], as summarized below. Additional details on actions required in case 
of liver events are outlined in Table 16-
2.
For all liver event triggers, liver chemistry  tests (i.e. ALT, AST, TBL, PT/INR, ALP and y -GT) 
must be repeated within the next week to confirm elevation.
These liver chemistry  repeats will be performed using the central laboratory. If results will 
not be available from the central laboratory , then the repeats can also be performed at a 
local laboratory  to monitor the safet y of the participant .
If a liver event is subsequently  reported, any  local liver chemistry  tests prev iously  
conducted that are associated with this event should have results recorded on the 
appropriate CRF. Repeat laboratory  examinations must then be performed at central 
laboratory  as soon as possible.
If the initial elevation is confirmed, close observat ion of the 
participant will be initiated, 
including consideration of treatment interruption if deemed appropriate.
Discontinuation of the investigational drug (refer to Section 9.1.1), if appropriate
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_188603]
Causality  assessment of the liver event
Thorough follow -up of the liver event should include 
These investigations can include based on Investigator ’s discretion: serology  tests, 
imaging and pathology  assessments, hepatologist’s consultancy ; obtaining more 
detailed history  of sy mptoms and prior or concurrent diseases, history  of concomitant 
drug use, exclusion of underly ing liver disease
All follow -up information and procedures performed must be recorded as appropriate in the 
CRF.
10.2.[ADDRESS_222694] to be considered during 
the course of the study :
Serum creatinine (sCR) increase ≥ 25% compared to baseline during nor mal hy dration 
status, confirmed after 24 hours

10.2.3 Prospective suicidality assessment
The C-SSRS is a paper questionnaire that prospectively  assesses suicidal ideation and suicidal 
behavior. The C-SSRS canbe administered at each visit (as per Table 8-1), including unplanned 
visits.
At the screening visit, the “baseline/screening” version of the C
-SSRS will be administered. 
This version assesses suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior during the participant ’s lifetime 
and during a predefined period. At subsequent visits, the “since last visit” version will be 
administered.
If, at any time after screening, the score is “yes” on item 4 or item 5 of the suicid al ideation 
section of the C-SSRS or “yes” on any item of the suicidal behavior section, the participant
must be referred to a mental health care professional for further assessment and/or treatment. 
The decision on whether the study  drug should be discont
inued is to be taken by [CONTACT_188659].
In addition, all life -threatening events must be reported as SAEs. For example, if a participant
answers “ yes” to one of the q uestions in the suicidal behavior section, an SAE must be reported 
if the event was life-threatening. All events of “Non -Suicidal Self-Injurious Behavior” 
(question 
also included in the suicidal behavior section) should be reported as AEs and assigned 
the appropriate severity  grade.

10.2.5 Steering Committee
The Steering Committee (SC) will be established comprising Investigator s participating in the 
trial, i.e. not being members of the [COMPANY_001]/sponsor representative from the Clinical Trial Team.  
The SC will ensure transparent management of the study  according to the protocol through 
recommending and approving modifications as circumstances require.  The SC will review 
protocol amendments as appropriate.  Together with the clinical trial team, the SC will also 
develop recommendations for publications of study  results including authorship rules.  The 
details of the role of the steering committee will be defined in the “Steering Committee Charter”.  
A study  steering committee will be appointed prior to first patient first visit (FPFV) .
11 Data Collection and Database management
11.1 Data collection
Designated Investigator staff will enter the data required by [CONTACT_37290] (eCRF). The eCRFs have been built using fully validated secure web-
enabled software that conforms to [ADDRESS_222697] been trained. Automatic validation programs

Amended Protocol Version No. 0 2 (clean ) Protocol No. COMB157GUS07
check for data discrepancies in the eCRFs, allow modification and/or verification of the entered 
data b y the Investigator staff.
The Investigator /designee is respons ible for assuring that the data (recorded on CRFs) (entered 
into eCRF) is complete, accurate, and that entry  and updates are performed in a timely  manner. 
The Investigator must certify  that the data entered are complete and accurate.
Allother data capture d for this study  will have either the eCRF as source oran external 
originating source (either written or electronic) with the CRF not being considered as source. 
In cases where electronic source data capture devices experience faults, for example, digital
device used for ePROs, paper back -up source will be permitted.
After final database lock, the Investigator will receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_157052].
All data should be recorded, handled, and stored 
in a way that allows its accurate reporting, 
interpretation, and verification.
11.2 Database management and quality  control
[COMPANY_001] personnel (or designated CRO) will review the data entered by [CONTACT_49432] . Electronic data queries stating the nature of the problem and 
requesting clarification will be created for discrepancies and missing values and sent to the 
investigational site via the EDC system. Designated Investigator site staff are required to 
respond promptly  to queries and t o make an y necessary  changes to the data.
Concomitant treatments and prior medications entered into the database will be coded using the 
World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Reference List, which employ s the Anatomical 
Therapeutic Chemical classification system. Medical history /current medical conditions and 
adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA) 
terminology .
Laboratory  samples will be processed centrall y and the results will be sent electronicall y to 
Sponsor. MRI  scans will be analyzed centrall y the derived results will also be sent electronicall y 
to Sponsor.
Enrollment codes and data about all study  treatment(s) dispensed to the participant will be 
tracked using an Interactive Response Technology  (IRT)
. The system will be supplied by a 
vendor, who will also manage the database. 
For electronic COAs, devices will be supplied by a vendor, data will be processed centrall y, 
and both raw and processed data will be sent electronically  to [COMPANY_001] (or a design ated CRO).
Once all the necessary  actions have been completed, including determining the occurrence of 
relevant protocol deviations, and the database has been declared to be complete and accurate, it 
will be locked and made available for data analysis . Any changes to the database after that time 
can onl y be made after written agreement by [CONTACT_188660].
11.3 Site monitoring
Before study  initiation, at a site initiation visit or at an Investigator’s meeting, a 
[COMPANY_001] representative will review the protocol and data capture requirements (i.e. eSource 

[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 74
Amended Protocol Version No. 0 2 (clean ) Protocol No. COMB157GUS07
DDE or eCRFs) with the Investigator s and their staff. During the study , [COMPANY_001] employ s 
several methods of ensuring protocol and GCP compliance and the quality /integrit y of the sites’ 
data. The field monitor will visit the site to check the completeness of participant records, the 
accuracy  of data capture / data entry , the adherence to the protocol and to Good Clinical Practice, 
the progress of enrollment, and to ensure that study  treatment is being stored, dispensed, and 
accounted for according to specifications. Key study personnel must be available to assist the 
field monitor during these visits. Continuous remote monitoring of each site’s data may be 
performed by a centralized [COMPANY_001] CRA organi zation. Additionally , a central analytics 
organization may analyze data & identify  risks & trends for site operational parameters, and 
provide reports to [COMPANY_001] clinical teams to assist with trial oversight.
The Investigator must maintain source document s for each participant in the study , consisting 
of case and visit notes (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5320]) containing demographic and medical 
information, laboratory data, electrocardiograms, and the results of any other tests or 
assessments. All informa tion on CRFs must be traceable to these source documents in the 
participant ’s file.The Investigator must also keep the original informed consent form signed by 
[CONTACT_2416] (a signed copy  is given to the p articipant ).
The Investigator must give the monitor access to all relevant source documents to confirm their 
consistency  with the data capture and/or data entry . [COMPANY_001] monitoring standards require full 
verification for the presence of informed consent, adherence to the inclusion/ex clusion criteria, 
documentation of SAEs, and of data that will be used for all primary  variables. Additional 
checks of the consistency  of the source data with the CRFs are performed according to the 
study -specific monitoring plan. No information in source documents about the identity  of the 
participants will be disclosed.

16.3 Appendix 3: Safety  Monitoring Guidance
16.3.1 Guidance on monitoring of Participants with sy mptoms of 
neurological deterioration suggestive of PML
Should a participant develop any  unexpected neurological or psy chiatric symptom/signs in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_118362] (e.g. cognitive deficit, behavioral changes, cortical visual disturbances 
or an y other neurological cortical s ymptoms/signs any  symptom/sign suggestive of an increase 
of intracranial pressure) or accelerated neurological deterioration, the Investigator should 
schedule a complete physical and neurological examination and an MRI as soon as possible 
before beginning an y steroid treatment. Conventional MRI as defined in the protocol as well as 
additional scanning such as FLAIR and Diffusion
-weighted imaging (DWI) sequences are 
recommended to aid in differential diagnosis. The local neuro -radiologist must evaluate the 
MRI . The Investigator will contact [CONTACT_188665] a clinical trial team 
(CTT) member to discuss findings and diagnostic possi bilities as soon as possible. A copy  of 
the unscheduled MRI should be sent to the MRI Evaluation Center designated by [CONTACT_188666]. AE/SAEs need to be filed as appropriate.
If the MRI shows new MS lesions consistent with an MS relapse, asse ssment and treatment of 
the relapse will be performed as described in the protocol ( Section 6.2.3 andSection 8.3.1).  In 
case of new findings in the MRI  images in comparison with the previous available MRI , which 
are not 
compatible with MS lesions, the study  drug will be discontinued and other diagnostic 
evaluations need to be performed at the discretion of the Investigat or. If new lesions are detected 
on the MRI, which may be infectious in origin, it is recommended to collect a cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_188608]. Anal ysis of the Cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_17106] (CSF) sample including cellular, 
biochemical, Polymerase Chain Reacti on, and microbiological analysis (e.g. herpes 
virus, JC 
virus) to confirm/exclude an infection should be performed. In the event of suspected CNS 

[COMPANY_001] Confidential Page 90
Amended Protocol Version No. 0 2 (clean ) Protocol No. COMB157GUS07
infection (PML), a CSF aliquot should be sent to a central laboratory  (designated by  [CONTACT_5343]) 
for confirmator y testing.
Only  after the evaluations have excluded diagnoses other than MS and after discussion with the 
Medical Advisor at [COMPANY_001] and a CTT member, the study  drug may  be restarted.
16.3.[ADDRESS_222710] (with site contact [CONTACT_188667] a clinical stud y with investigational and control agents 
with potential immunosuppressive effects) and to show this to any local healthcare provider 
they may  consult and ask that the Investigator be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].
In the case of suspected or confirmed serious (CTCAE, Grade 3 -4) or aty pi[INVESTIGATOR_188609], study  
drug interruption should be considered. The Investigator should inform the [COMPANY_001] Medical 
Advisor and/or a CTT member of any  such cases.
When evaluating a participant with a suspected infection, the most sensitive tests available 
should be used (i.e. that directly  detect the pathogen, as with poly merase chain reaction).
The Investigator should consider early treatment with specific antimicrobial therap y based on 
clinical diagnosis or suspi[INVESTIGATOR_188610], as 
appropriate. The Investigator should inform the [COMPANY_001] Medical Advisor and CTT of any such 
cases.
Investigator s should consider the added immunosuppressive effects of corticosteroid therap y 
for treatment of MS attack/relaps e and increase vigilance regarding infections during such 
therap y and in the weeks following administration.
In participants with known malignancies treated with ofatumumab, cases of fatal hepatitis B 
virus (HBV) reactivation and 
fatal infection due to hepatitis B in participants who have not been 
previously  infected have occurred (refer to local Arzerra®prescribing information). The MS 
participants enrolled in the study  who are at potential risk of HBV reactivation (e.g. Participants
with evidence of prio
r HBV infection (antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBc) 
positive and Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) negative) and whose HBV deox yribonucleic 
acid (DNA) test is negative at Screening, should be closely  monitored for signs of active HBV 
infection or reactivation during the study . In participants with suspi[INVESTIGATOR_188611] 
(active/reactivation), laboratory  testing for HBV should be done. For participants who show 
evidence of hepatitis B infection (HBsAg positive [regardless of antibody status] or HBsAg 
negative but anti-HBc positive), the Investigator is advised to consult with physicians with 
expertise in managing hepatitis B regarding monitoring and consideration for HBV antiviral 
therap y.
In participants who develop reactivation of HBV while receiving study drug, immediatel y 
discontinue study  drug and institute appropriate treatment and follow-up.

16.3.3 Guidance on immunization
The safety of and ability to generate a primar y or anamnestic (recall) response to immunization 
with live, live-attenuated or inactivated vaccines during ofatumumab treatment has not been 
investigated. The response to vaccination could be impaired when B -cells are depleted.
It is recommended that the In vestigator review the participant 's immunization history  as part of 
the initial Screening procedure for a participant being considered for treatment with 
ofatumumab. 
Administration of live or live-attenuated vaccines must be avoided during and 
after 
treatment with ofatumumab and until B -cell counts are normalized.
There is presentl y no contraindication for the use of an inactivated, viral-vector -, or mRNA 
based Sars -CoV -[ADDRESS_222711] Sars-CoV - 2 should be considered on a 
case-by-case basis at the discretion of the treating physician taking into account the individual 
benefit -risk assessment and local vaccination recommendations
16.3.4 Guidance on monitoring of Participants with low  immunoglobulin 
levels
During the stud y, the immunoglobulin levels (IgG and IgM) will be measured according to the 
schedule inTable 8-1and Table 8-2. If IgG levels were to drop below 300mg/dL 
(Agarwal andCunningham- Rundles 2007), study  drug treatment should be interrupted and the 
Investigator should evaluate participant for any potential infecti ons and monitor on a regular 
basis. I mmunoglobulin substitution therapy  as per local medical practice is allowed. In case of 
treatment interruption, re-initiation of the study  drug can only be considered once the 
immunoglobulin levels are back within norma l limits.

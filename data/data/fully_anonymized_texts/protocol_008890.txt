Protocol Title:   A Phase 3 Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Elagolix in Combination with 
Estradiol/Norethindrone Acetate in Subjects with Moderate to Severe Endometriosis -Associated Pain
Objectives:   The objectives of the study are to 1) assess the safety and efficacy of elagolix 200 mg 
administered twice daily (BID) in combination with estradiol 1 mg/0.5 mg norethindrone acetate 
(E2/NETA 1 mg/0.5 mg) once a day (QD) compared to placebo at 6 and 12 months; 2) to assess the effect of elagolix 200 mg BID in combination with E2/NETA (1 mg/0.5 mg) QD, on bone mineral density (BMD) compared to elagolix 200 BID alone at 6 months, and compared to placebo at 6 months and at 12 months of treatment and 3) to evaluate the continued safety and efficacy of elagolix 200 mg BID plus E2/NETA (1 mg/0.5 mg) QD for up to 48 months in the management of premenopausal women with moderate to severe endometriosis -associated pain.
Investigators:   Multicenter Trial:  Investigator information is on file at [COMPANY_013]
Study Sites:   Approximately 200 sites
Study Population:   Premenopausal female subjects (aged 18 to 49 years, inclusive) with a surgical 
diagnosis of endometriosis within 10 years prior to screening and with moderate to severe endometriosis -associated pain.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately 700
Methodology:
This Phase 3 study includes a 48- month Treatment Period and is designed to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of elagolix in combination with concomitant hormonal add- back therapy (E2/NETA 
1 mg/0.5 mg) in the management of endometriosis -associated pain in premenopausal women.  The 
first12 months of the Treatment Period will employ a randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled 
design (12 months), an elagolix 200 mg BID alone arm (the first 6 months followed by [CONTACT_530407] 200 mg 
BID plus E2/NETA [1 mg/0.5 mg] QD for 6 months), and an elagolix 200 mg BID plus E2/NETA 
(1mg/0.5 mg) QD arm.  The last 36 months of the Treatment Period will be open- label, such that all 
subjects, will receive active treatment with elagolix 200 mg BID plus E2/NETA (1 mg/0.5 mg) QD.  
Protocol specific rescue analgesics will be allowed for all subjects throughout the Screening and 
Treatment Periods.
Approximately 700 subjects will be randomly assigned on Study Day 1 in a 4:1:2 ratio of elagolix 
treatment in combination with E2/NETA or elagolix alone or placebo as follows:
•elagolix 200 mg BID plus E2/NETA (1 mg/0.5 mg) QD (n = 400)
•elagolix 200 mg BID (n = 100)
•placebo (n = 200)

Methodology (Continued):
Study Duration:
The total duration for a subject's participation in this study is approximately 51 to 74 months consisting 
of 4 study periods:
•Washout Period – up to 10 months prior to Screening (only applicable if subject is taking 
exclusionary medication at the time of consent; duration of washout depends on the type of exclusionary medication being taken).
•Screening Period – approximately 1.[ADDRESS_688727] dose of study drug.
•Treatment Period – up to 48 -month treatment duration.
•Follow -Up Period – [ADDRESS_688728] prematurely discontinues 
from the Treatment Period at the time of or after Treatment Month 6.
Washout Period:
After signing the informed consent, subjects, who have been taking exclusionary medications prior to 
screening that require protocol specified discontinuation, must enter a Washout Period.  The duration of the washout period is based on the excluded medication as described in the protocol.  The following study procedures may be performed:  medical, social and gynecological history (including documentation of diagnosis of endometriosis via surgical visualization or histologic diagnosis), a physical examinati on with vital signs, and urine pregnancy testing; protocol -related adverse event review 
and documentation of current medications.  Subjects must complete the Washout Period and have had at least 1 menstrual period (menses) prior to entering the Screening P eriod.  Contraceptive counseling will 
be provided, and non -hormonal contraceptives dispensed, as necessary.

Methodology (Continued):
Screening Period:
Following informed consent (if Washout was not required), subjects will enter into the approximately 
1.5- to 4-month Screening Period to establish eligibility based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, 
including the following safety baseline assessments:  a dual energy x- ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan; an 
endometrial biopsy and transvaginal ultrasound (TVU); a Papanicolaou (Pap) test; a mammogram in subjects 40 years of age or older if one has not been performed within 3 months prior to Screening.  An 
electr onic daily diary (e -Diary) will be provided to subjects to begin recording dysmenorrhea (DYS) and 
non-menstrual pelvic pain (NMPP) via the [ADDRESS_688729] Diary (no pain, mild 
pain, moderate pain, severe pain coded as 0 – 3); dyspar eunia via a 4 -point scale, plus a choice of "not 
applicable;" and the presence and intensity of uterine bleeding.  A minimum of [ADDRESS_688730] 2 menstrual cycles with 
cycle length of 21 – [ADDRESS_688731] 1 full menstrual cycle (i.e.,  2 menses or menstrual periods) 
must be documented in the e -Diary during Screening.  Subjects are required to use dual non- hormonal 
contraception (as applicable).  Contraceptive counseling will be provided and contraceptives dispensed, 
as necessary.  Subjects will be allowed to take protocol defined analgesic rescue medication for endometriosis -associated pain.  Protocol allowed analges ic rescue medication for endometriosis -
associated pain will include multiple non -steroidal anti- inflammatory drug (NSAID) choices and 
2 opi[INVESTIGATOR_530341]:  codeine plus acetaminophen or hydrocodone plus acetaminophen; use of other rescue 
analgesic or prophyla ctic analgesic medications for endometriosis -associated pain will not be allowed 
during this period.  NSAID and opi[INVESTIGATOR_530342]'s preference and historical use of analgesics for endometriosis -associated pain and 
Investigator judgment.  Subjects will record use of protocol allowed analgesic rescue medications for endometriosis -associated pain in the daily e -Diary.
Treatment Period:
The Treatment Period begins on Day 1, which will occur between Cycle Days [ADDRESS_688732] day 
of menses (defined as first day with full menstrual flow) for all subjects who meet eligibility criteria during the Screening Period.
Subjects entering the Treatment Period will visit the site monthly (28 -day months) through Month 6 of 
the Treatment Period.  After the Month 6 visit and through Month 12, on- site visits will be conducted at 
Treatment Months 8, 10, and 12; phone contacts will be made at other monthly timepoints.  Subsequent 
to the Month 12 visit, on- site visits will be conducted every three months at Treatment Months 15, 18, 
21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, and 48; phone contacts will be made at other monthly time points.   
Months 13 – 48 of the Treatment Period will be open- label such that all subjects (including those 
previously randomized to elagolix 200 mg alone or placebo) will receive active treatment with elagolix 200 mg BID plus E2/NETA (1 mg/0.5 mg) QD.  Study drug kits will be dispensed to subjects at each on-site visit with the exception of the final visit at Treatment Month 48.

Methodology (Continued):
Treatment Period (Continued):
Subjects will use the daily e -Diary to continue recording DYS and NMPP; dyspareunia, if applicable; the 
presence and intensity of uterine bleeding; and the use of protocol specific analgesic rescue medication 
for endometriosis -associated pain through Treat ment Period Month 12.  During Months 13 to 48, 
information regarding subjects' use of rescue analgesic medications for endometriosis -associated pain 
will be collected at monthly study visits and recorded in source documents and eCRF.  At the Day 1 visit (prior to dosing) and at all monthly visits (on- site and phone contacts), site staff will administer to 
subjects a questionnaire assessing overall endometriosis -associated pain over a 7 -day recall period 
(11-point NRS).
Throughout the 48- month Treatment Period, all subjects will continue to be able to take protocol specific 
analgesic rescue medications for endometriosis -associated pain.  Use of non -protocol specific rescue 
analgesic or prophylactic analgesic medications f or endometriosis -associated pain will not be allowed 
during the Treatment Period.
All subjects will self -administer study medication or matching placebo (through Treatment Month 12) 
twice daily (once in the morning and once in the evening approximately 12 hours apart), orally without 
regard to food or meals throughout the 48- month Treatment Period.
Subjects will complete various patient- reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires at study visits.
Pregnancy (serum and/or urine) tests will be performed at each visit throughout the Treatment Period.  Urine pregnancy test kits will be provided to subjects for use at home for the study visits when subjects are not required to come into the clinic/site. Subjects will self -administer the tests and report the results 
to the site at the phone contact [CONTACT_41995].  A positive urine pregnancy test must be confirmed with a serum pregnancy test.  If a serum pregnancy test result is positive at any time during the Tr eatment Period, 
study drug will be discontinued.
During the Treatment Period, blood samples will be collected for Clinical Safety Labs and vitamin D 
testing.  In addition, blood samples will be collected for assay of serum estradiol, and to measure plasma concentrations of elagolix and norethindrone, at designated study visits.  For subjects who consent, a DNA and RNA pharmacogenetic (PG) blood sample will be collected on Day 1, Month 6 and Month 12.
Vitals signs assessments will be conducted at designated time points throughout the Treatment Period.  
Additional safety assessments including TVUs, mammograms, Pap tests, endometrial biopsies and DXAs are completed as appropriate throughout the Treatment Period.  Adverse event and concomitant medication review will be conducted at all visits (on -site and phone contacts) during the Treatment 
Period.
Bone Mineral Density (BMD) Assessment and Study Specific Safety Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_530343]:
DXA scans of the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], total hip, and femoral neck will be obtained at Treatment Months 6, 12, 
18, 24, 30, 36, 42, and 48.  If the results of any post -baseline DXA prior to Month 48, as read by [CONTACT_530408], document a Z-score (for subjects < 40 years of age at the time of the 
Screening DXA) or T -score (for subjects ≥ 40 years of age at the time of the Screening DXA) of < – 2.5 
or BMD decrease from baseline of > 8% in the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], total hip or femoral neck, the subje ct must 
be discontinued from study drug dosing and will enter the Follow -Up Period.

Methodology (Continued):
Follow -Up Period:
Subjects will enter the Follow -Up Period for 12 months to assess bone recovery after up to 48 months of 
treatment.  Subjects who prematurely discontinue from the study at the time of or after the Treatment 
Period Month 6 visit will enter the Follow -Up Period.  DXA scans of the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], total hip, and 
femoral neck will be obtained at Follow -Up Months 6 and 12.
Vital signs and pregnancy testing will be performed at designated study visits.  Adverse events and concomitant medication use will also be reviewed.
Central Laboratory and Central Imaging Vendors:
DXA, TVU, endometrial biopsy and clinical safety lab samples will be analyzed/evaluated using central 
laboratories or vendors.  Assays for pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and pharmacogenetics will be analyzed at [COMPANY_013].

•Change from baseline for the WPAI:SHP.
•HCRU at each scheduled assessment.
•Change from baseline for the PROMIS Fatigue short Form 6A T -Score.
Safety Assessments:
Safety assessment will include BMD measurements including Z - and T -scores and percent change from 
baseline as measured by [CONTACT_530415] 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, and 48 of the Treatment Period.  Other safety evaluations will include physical examinations, mammograms, Adverse Events (AEs), 
clinical laboratory tests (including hematology, chemistry, urinalysis, and lipid panel), the C -SSRS, vital 
sign measurements (including electrocardiogram).  Endometrial assessments will include TVU and endometrial biopsy.
Statistical Methods:
Efficacy:
All subjects who receive at least [ADDRESS_688735] as a pain responder at Month 6 
of the Treatment Period will be a reduction of 'X' or greater from Baseline in pain as well as no increased rescue analgesic use for endometriosis -associated pain.  The threshold X will be determined based on 
ROC analysis at Month 6 using the Month 6 PGIC as an anchor.  The use of protocol specified rescue analgesics at Month 6 of the Treatment Period for endometriosis -associated pain will be included in the 
responder definition.  The primary analysis of the co- primary endpoint will be based on a logistic 
regression model including treatment as the ma in factor and baseline pain scores as a covariate and the 
elagolix 200 mg BID plus E2/NETA dose will be compared to placebo.
Analysis details for Months 1 – 12 and Months 13 – 48 of the treatment period will be specified in the 
statistical analysis plan (SAP).  No statistical tests will be performed following the 12 -month placebo-
controlled portion of the 48 -month Treatment Period.  Data from subjects randomized to the elagolix 
200mg BID alone will be su mmarized separately from subjects randomized to the elagolix 200 mg BID 
plus E2/NETA (1 mg/0.5 mg) QD arm.  Unless otherwise specified, no statistical tests will be performed 
to evaluate potential differences between the two elagolix dose groups.
The mean change from baseline in key secondary endpoints will be analyzed using a mixed- effects 
model with repeated measures.  Key secondary endpoints will be assessed at Month 3, Month [ADDRESS_688736] dose of elagolix in Months 13 – [ADDRESS_688737] dose of elagolix at the time of randomization.

Statistical Methods (Continued):
BMD Assessments:
The key BMD comparisons are in lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_112700] 6 and Month 12.  Secondary BMD endpoints 
include total hip and femoral neck.  The elagolix 200 mg BID plus E2/NETA (1 mg/0.5 mg) QD dose will be compared to placebo at Months 6 and 12 and will be compared to elagolix 200 mg BID alone at Month 6 based on percent change from baseline.  Percent change in BMD from baseline values, as well as Z-scores and T- scores at all time points will also be summarized.  Analysis details will be provided in 
the SAP. 
Safety Assessments:
All subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study medication will be included in the safety analyses.  
Hematology, chemistry (including lipid panel), urinalysis, vital signs, endometrial assessments and uterine bleeding variables will be summarized.  Changes from Baseline to each Treatment Period visit during the first 12 months of treatment will be analyzed using an ANOVA or ANCOVA model as appropriate as specified in the SAP.
Safety analysis for Months 1 – 12 and Months 13 – 48 of the treatment period will be specified in the 
statistical analysis plan.  No statistical tests will be performed to evaluate potential differences between 
dose groups following the 12- month placebo- controlled portion of the 48 -month Treatment Period.
Safety data from subjects randomized to the elagolix 200 mg BID alone treatment group will be summarized separately from subjects randomized to the elagolix 200 mg BID plus E2/NETA (1mg/0.5 mg) QD arm.
Other safety analyses will be pre- specified in the SAP.
Pharmacokinetic:
Exposures of elagolix and norethindrone will be summarized and elagolix concentrations may be used to 
develop a population pharmacokinetic model.  Additional parameters may be calculated if useful for the interpretation of the data.
Pharmacodynamic:
Concentrations of estradiol (E2) will be obtained throughout the Treatment Period.  Additional 
pharmacodynamic parameters may be calculated if useful in the interpretation of the data.

3.2.2 Clinical Experience
The current Investigator Brochure provides details of the pharmacology and 
pharmacokinetics of elagolix in humans, in addition to a summary of elagolix clinical studies in Phases 1, 2 and 3.

In two replicate Phase 3 endometriosis studies, elagolix met its primary efficacy endpoints of a statistically significant and clinically meaningful decrease in dysmenorrhea (DYS) and non-menstrual pelvic pain (NMPP) at 3 months with continued efficacy at 6 months for both the 150 mg QD and 200 mg BID dose levels.  The 150 mg QD dose demonstrated efficacy in 3 of 7 key ranked secondary outcome measures while the 200 mg BID dose showed a statistically significant improvement in all 7 key ranked secondary outcome measures.  Also consistent with estradiol (E2) suppression and previous elagolix studies, there was a dose dependent effect on BMD, such that a longer duration of treatment with the higher elagolix dose (200 mg BID) would likely require concomitant use of hormonal add back therapy to mitigate BMD loss. 
Elagolix is not contraceptive and can change the menstrual bleeding pattern.  A 
folliculogenesis study with elagolix revealed a dose-dependent suppression of ovulation.  Although there is no evidence of fetal abnormalities in preclinical studies, there hav e been 
[ADDRESS_688749] on BMD, such that longer duration of treatment with the higher elagolix dose (200 mg BID) would likely require concomitant use of hormonal add back therapy to mitigate BMD loss, which is the hypothesis being tested in this study.  The current study evaluates the safety and efficacy of the elagolix 200 mg BID dose in combination with estrogen/progestin hormonal add-back therapy for a [ADDRESS_688750].  Menstrual cycle changes are also observed in indiv iduals 
administered elagolix, and include lengthening of the cycle, and in some subjects, oligo- or amenorrhea and/or irregular bleeding or spotting.  Pregnancies have been observed in subjects exposed to elagolix, which is consistent with the dose-depende nt effect on 
suppression of ovulation.  To date, the benefit/risk profile of elagolix appears to remain favorable for the management of endometriosis-associated pain, and will be further defined by [CONTACT_530416] 3 trial.

Considering the Coronavirus Disease- 19 (COVID -19) pandemic, the benefit and risk to 
subjects participating in this study has been re-evaluated.  The use of elagolix plus 
E2/NETA addback provides a viable option to treat the chronic pain of women with endom etriosis.  Based on the limited information to date, no additional risk to study 
participants is anticipated with the use of  elagolix in combination with E2/NETA in 
subjects who may contract COVID-19. 
4.0 Study Objective
The objectives of this study are to: 
●Assess the safety and efficacy of elagolix 200 mg administered twice daily 
(BID) in combination with estradiol 1 mg/0.5 mg norethindrone acetate (E2/NETA 1 mg/0.5 mg) QD compared to placebo at 6 months and 12 months; 
●Assess the effect of elagolix 200 mg BID in combination with E2/NETA (1 mg/0.5 mg) QD on bone mineral density (BMD) compared to elagolix 
200 mg BID alone at 6 months and compared to placebo at 6 months and 
12 months; 
●Evaluate the continued safety and efficacy of elagolix 200 mg BID plus 
E2/NETA (1 mg/0.5 mg) QD for up to 48 months in premenopausal women 
with moderate to severe endometriosis- associated pain
5.0 Investigational Plan
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description
COVID-[ADDRESS_688751] from the study 
for a reason other than "planned per protocol," (refer to Section 5.4) to ensure all acceptable mitigation steps have been explored. 
This Phase 3 study includes a 48-month Treatment Period and is designed to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of elagolix in combination with concomitant hormonal add- back 
therapy (E2/NETA 1 mg/0.5 mg) in the management of endometriosis-associated pain in premenopausal women.  The first 12 months of the Treatment Period will employ a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design (12 months), an elagolix 200 mg BID alone arm (the first 6 months followed by [CONTACT_530407] 200 mg BID plus E2/NETA [1 mg/0.5 mg] QD), and an elagolix 200 mg BID plus E2/NETA (1 mg/0.5 mg) QD arm.  
The remaining 36 months of the Treatment Period will be open- label, such that all 
subjects will receive elagolix 200 mg BID plus E2/NETA (1 mg/0.5 mg) QD. 
Approximately 700 subjects will be randomly assigned on Study Day 1 in a 4:1:2 ratio as 
follows: 
●elagolix 200 mg BID plus E2/NETA (1 mg/0.5 mg) QD (n = 400) 
●elagolix 200 mg BID (n = 100) 
●placebo (n  = 200) 
The study was designed to enroll approximately [ADDRESS_688752]'s participation in this study is approximately 51 to 74 months, consisting of the following 4 study periods: 
●Washout Period – up to 10 months prior to Screening (only applicable if subject 
is taking exclusionary medication  at the time of consent; duration of washout 
depends on the type of exclusionary medication being taken) 
Elagolix
M14 -702 Protocol Amendment 7

●Screening Period – approximately 1.[ADDRESS_688753] dose of study 
drug 
●Treatment Period – up to 48- month treatment duration
●Follow-Up Period –[ADDRESS_688754] prematurely discontinues from the Treatment Period at the 
time of or after Treatment Month 6 .

Washout Period 
Following informed consent, subjects, who are or were taking exclusionary 
hormonal/anti-hormonal medications prior to screening that require discontinuation (washout), must enter a Washout Period.  The duration of the required washout period is based on the excluded medication that the subject is or was taking.  Additional details about washout intervals for exclusionary medication is provided in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  Study procedures to be performed during the Washout Period are specified in Appendix C, Study Activities and described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  Subjects must complete the Washout Period and have had at least 1 menstrual period (menses) prior to entering the Screening Period.  Subjects will also begin the use of non-hormonal dual contraception during the Washout Period and receive counseling on the importance of consistent, appropriate and effective use of contraception, and contraceptives dispensed, as necessary. 
Screening Period
Subjects who do not require washout will enter directly into the Screening Period 
(approximately 1.5 to 4 months) and will provide written informed consent before any study related procedures are performed.  Subjects will undergo screening procedures as specified in Appendix C, Study Activities and described in Section [IP_ADDRESS], to establish 
eligibility based on inclusion and exclusion criteria including the following safety assessments:
●a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan to document baseline bone 
mineral density (BMD)
●a transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) to rule out any exclusionary gynecological 
disorders such as ovarian cysts, large fibroids, endometrial polyps 
●an endometrial biopsy to rule out other endometrial pathology 
● a Papanicolaou (Pap) test in subjects ≥ 21 years of age, to rule out significant 
cervical/gynecological pathology 
●a mammogram in subjects 40 years of age or older if one has not been performed within 3 months prior to the time of entry into Screening 
Elagolix

An electronic daily diary (e-Diary) will be provided to subjects at screening to begin 
recording:  
●endometriosis-associated pain (dysmenorrhea [DYS] or non- menstrual pelvic 
pain [NMPP]) using the [ADDRESS_688755] Diary scale 
(no pain, mild pain, moderate pain, severe pain coded as 0 – 3) 
●dyspareunia via a 4-point scale (no pain, mild pain, moderate pain, severe pain 
coded as 0 – 3, and not applicable) 
●the presence of uterine bleeding (menstrual period and other uterine bleeding) 
and intensity of bleeding (spotting, light, medium, heavy) 
A minimum of [ADDRESS_688756] 2 menstrual cycles with cycle length of 21 – [ADDRESS_688757] 1 full menstrual cycle (i.e., 2 menses or menstrual periods) must be documented in the e-Diary during Screening.  Subjects are required to use appropriate non-hormonal contraception throughout the Screening Period.  Contraceptive counseling will be provided and contracept ives 
dispensed, as necessary.  Subjects will be allowed to take protocol allowed analgesic rescue medication for endometriosis -associated pain which includes multiple NSAID 
choices and opi[INVESTIGATOR_530341].  Use of other rescue analgesic or prophylactic analgesic 
medications for endometriosis-associated pain will not be allowed.  NSAID and opi[INVESTIGATOR_530342]'s preference and historical use of analgesics for endometriosis- associated pain  and 
Investigator judgment.  Subjects will record use of protocol allowed analgesic rescue medications for endometriosis-associated pain in the daily e- Diary.  Sites will record the 
use of protocol- allowed rescue analgesics in the source documents and eCRF . 
Subjects who have signed informed consent and did not complete the Day [ADDRESS_688758] be repeated upon re-screen.  The following screening procedures do not need to be repeated upon re- screen:
●Endometrial biopsy, PAP and/or mammogram if completed within 12 months 
for the study, 
●DXA, TVU, Clinical/Safety Labs, Vitamin D Testing, Hepatitis/HIV Screen, if 
completed within [ADDRESS_688759]'s menstrual cycle (Cycle Day [ADDRESS_688760] day with full menstrual flow), for all subjects following determination of eligibility during the Screening Period.  Randomizations beyond Cycle Day [ADDRESS_688761]'s menstrual cycle must be discussed with the [COMPANY_013] Therapeutic Area Medical Director (TA MD) prior to randomizing the subject and will be evaluated on a case by [CONTACT_413], including whether additional procedures are required.
On Day 1 of the Treatment Period, subjects will be randomly assigned (in a 4:1:2 ratio) to 
receive either elagolix 200 mg BID plus E2/NETA (1 mg/0.5 mg) QD (n = 400), elagolix 
200 mg BID alone (n = 100), or placebo (n = 200).  The first dose of study drug will be administered at the study site on Day 1.  Thereafter, subjects will self-administer study medication or matching placebo twice daily (once in the morning and once in the evening, approximately 12 hours apart) orally without regard to food or meals throughout the 48-month Treatment Period.  Subjects will visit the site monthly (28 -day months) through 
Month 6 of the Treatment Period.  After the Month 6 visit and through Month 12, on- site

visits will be conducted at Treatment Months 8, 10, and 12; phone contacts will be made 
at Treatment Months 7, 9, and 11. 
Months 13 – 48 of the Treatment Period will be open- label such that all subjects 
(including those previously randomized to elagolix 200 mg BID alone or placebo) will 
receive active treatment with elagolix 200 mg BID plus E2/NETA (1 mg/0.5 mg) QD.  On-site visits will be conducted at Months 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, and 
48; phone contacts will be made at Months 13 – 14, 16 – 17, 19 – 20, 22 – 23, 25 – 26, 28 – 29, 31 – 32, 34 – 35, 37 – 38, 40 – 41, 43 – 44, and 46 – 47. 
Study drug kits will be dispensed to subjects at each on- site visit with the exception of the 
final visit at Treatment Month 48.  Subjects randomized to elagolix plus E2/NETA on 
Day 1 of the Treatment Period will continue with the same dosing regimen (dose and 
frequency) throughout the entire Treatment Period; subjects randomized to elagolix [ADDRESS_688762] 6 months will be reassigned to receive elagolix 200 mg BID plus E2/NETA (1 mg/0.5 mg) QD for the remainder of the Treatment Period (Months 7 – 48); subjects randomized to placebo will be reassigned at Treatment 
Month 12 to receive elagolix 200 mg BID plus E2/NETA (1 mg/0.5 mg) QD for the remainder of the Treatment Period.  All subjects will know they are receiving elagolix 200 mg BID plus E2/NETA (1 mg/0.5 mg) QD during Months 13 – 48. 
Through Treatment Month 12, subjects will use the daily e-Diary to continue recording: 
●endometriosis-associated pain (DYS and NMPP via the [ADDRESS_688763] Scale) (no pain, mild pain, moderate pain, severe pain coded 
as 0 – 3) 
●dyspareunia via a 4- point scale (no pain, mild pain, moderate pain, severe pain 
coded as 0 – 3, and not applicable) 
●the presence of uterine bleeding (menstrual period and other uterine bleeding) and intensity of bleeding (spotting, light, medium, heavy) 
●use of protocol specific analgesic rescue medications for endometriosis-associated pain

At the Day 1 visit (prior to dosing) and at all monthly visits during the Treatment Period 
(on-site and phone contacts), site staff will administer to subjects the overall 
endometriosis-associated pain questionnaire, an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS). 
Information regarding the use of rescue analgesic medications for endometriosis-
associated pain will be collected at monthly study visits and recorded in source documents and eCRF.
At select study visits, subjects will be asked to complete various patient-reported outcome 
(PRO) questionnaires, including a Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC).  Vital signs assessments will be conducted at designated time points.  Additional safety assessments including mammograms, TVUs, Pap tests, endometrial biopsies, and DXAs are completed as appropriate throughout the Treatment Period. 
Blood samples for clinical safety labs and vitamin D testing and will be obtained.  In 
addition, blood samples will be collected for assay of serum estradiol prior to dosing on Day 1 and at designated study visits, and to measure plasma concentrations of elagolix and norethindrone at designated study visits.  For subjects who consent, 3 separate DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (Ribonucleic acid) pharmacogenetic (PG) blood samples and [ADDRESS_688764] kits will be provided to subjects for use at home for the study visits when subjects are not required to come into the clinic/site.  Subjects will self -administer the tests and report the results to 
the site at the phone contact [CONTACT_41995].  Subjects will be counseled at each visit on consistent, appropriate and effective forms of dual non-hormonal contraception to promote pregnancy prevention.  A positive urine pregnancy test must be confirmed with a serum pregnancy test.  A positive serum pregnancy test at any time will necessitate discontinuation from the Treatment Period.

5.2.4 Contraception Recommendations and Pregnancy Testing
Contraception Counseling/Dispensing Contraceptives
Investigators and study staff will be trained by [CONTACT_112753].  Subjects (excluding those subjects who have had a bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral tubal occlusion) will be counseled by [CONTACT_530422]. 
Subjects must agree to use two forms of non-hormonal contraception (dual contraception) 
consistently throughout the Washout (if applicable), Screening and Treatment Periods, and the first month of the Follow-Up Period.  Subjects may begin the use of hormonal contraception (e.g., oral or IUD) after completion of the Follow-Up Month [ADDRESS_688798] has a documented menstrual period after the Treatment Period and prior to that visit. 
Acceptable methods of dual non-hormonal contraception include the following 
combinations: 
●Condom with spermicide (e.g., cream, spray, foam, gel, suppository or polymer 
film)
●Diaphragm with spermicide (condom may or may not be used) 
●Cervical cap with spermicide (condom may or may not be used) 
●Vaginal sponge impregnated with spermicide; used with a condom 
Subjects are not required to use dual contraception methods if: 
●Sexual partner(s) is vasectomized at least 6 months prior to Screening.
●Subject had a bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral tubal occlusion at least 4 months prior to the start of Screening. 
Elagolix
M14 -702 Protocol Amendment 7

●Subject is not sexually active with men; however, periodic sexual 
relationship(s) with men requires the use of dual non-hormonal contraception 
as indicated above.
●Subject practices total abstinence from sexual intercourse as the preferred 
lifestyle of the subject; periodic abstinence is not acceptable and requires use of 
dual contraception. 
●Subject has begun the use of hormonal contraception after the Follow- Up 
Month [ADDRESS_688799] has not returned to menses by [CONTACT_31051]-Up Month 1, the investigator would use acceptable medical practice to reinitiate hormonal contraceptive (e.g., pregnancy test, serum FSH, induction of withdrawal bleed). 
The following measures will be taken to help promote pregnancy prevention during the 
study. 
1. The informed consent form will include an attestation requiring the subject to 
confirm in writing (via signature) her full awareness that the potential risks of study drug on the unborn child are unknown and therefore she must not get pregnant during the entire time of study participation, and that she agrees to consistently use protocol required non-hormonal contraception throughout her study participation. 
2. The Investigator or designated study staff will counsel the subject that the study 
drug is not contraceptive, that ovulation may occur even though the study drug may have altered menstrual cycle patterns, and that fetal abnormalities have been reported in pregnant women who have received elagolix in clinical studies; however, it is unknown whether these abnormalities were the result of taking elagolix.

3. The Sponsor will provide training materials to the sites for instructing subjects on 
the types of protocol-allowed contraception methods, their effectiveness and proper 
use.
●The Sponsor will provide all investigative sites with a supply of materials to 
promote pregnancy prevention, including contraceptives (e.g., condoms and 
spermicides) to provide to subjects at no charge.   
●Subjects will be allowed to choose an acceptable contraception method of their 
choice from the contraceptive options provided by [CONTACT_530423].  The site will assess the subject's basic understanding of proper contraceptive use 
through discussion and demonstration of proper techniques, if needed, 
including proper diaphragm use. 
●The site will provide contraceptives and other supplies (e.g., lubricants) to 
subjects throughout the Washout (if applicable), Screening, and TreatmentPeriods , as needed.  If necessary, the subject may obtain protocol- allowed 
contraceptives apart from the study site.  In this situation, the study site still 
must document the form/type of contraceptives obtained, and subjects' 
attestation of consistent use of these non-hormonal contraceptives throughout study participation. 
●The source documents will capture the date initial contraception counseling was performed, whether the subject meets protocol criteria for not requiring use of dual contraception, and the type of contraceptive provided to the subject (as 
applicable).  At subsequent study visits, the source doc uments will capture if 
there was a change in contraceptive method and whether additional 
contraceptives were provided to the subject. 
●The subject will be asked to attest by [CONTACT_112756], and subsequently in a stand- alone attestation form at all on- site study visits that 
allowable methods of contraception, as described during the pregnancy 
prevention counseling, are being pr acticed.
●For subjects who have had a bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral tubal occlusion 
(including Essure
®), attestation is only required to be collected once during the 
study prior to randomization, ideally at the time of consent.  Additionally, these 
Elagolix
M14 -[ADDRESS_688800] s do not require contraception counseling at any study visit or the 
associated documentation of that counseling. 
4. The e-Diary will be designed to include a daily reminder to use non-hormonal 
contraception. 
5. Monthly study contacts are used to promote frequent interaction with site staff and 
opportunities for continued education. 
6. At each Treatment Period visit (on -site and phone contacts), the proper use of 
contraception will be reinforced to address possible ineffective use and the risk of 
unexpected pregnancy due to unprotected sexual activity. 
COVID-[ADDRESS_688801] is unable to come on- site, contraception 
counseling should be conducted during phone visits (as applicable).  The site should ship a reasonable quantity of contraceptive supplies to the subject for use until the next on- site 
visit.  The type and quantity of contraceptives shipped to the subject must be documented in source along with the shippi[INVESTIGATOR_530359].  When the subject can return to the site, the site should make sure that adequate contraceptives are dispensed to the 
subject.
Pregnancy Testing
Urine and serum pregnancy tests will be performed as specified in Appendix C in all 
subjects regardless of sexual activity status or method of contraception, including subjects 
who are surgically sterilized.
The urine pregnancy test result on Day [ADDRESS_688802] kits will be provided to subjects during the Treatment and 
Follow-Up Periods for use at home when subjects are not required to come into the clinic/site (e.g., phone contact [CONTACT_530424]).  Subjects will self-administer the tests and report the results to the site during phone contacts.  Subject 
reported test results will be entered into the source and eCRF. 
A positive urine pregnancy test result (including a home urine pregnancy test) must be 
confirmed with a quantitative serum pregnancy test.  The subject should temporarily discontinue study drug administration while waiting for the results of the serum pregnancy test.  If a serum pregnancy test result is positive at any time during the 
Treatment Period, the site will immediately inform the subject to discontinue study drug dosing (Section 6.1.6).  If a subject is confirmed as pregnant, the subject will be prematurely discontinued from the study. 
If the subject becomes pregnant at any time after randomization up through [ADDRESS_688803]'s fetus, pregnancy outcome and infant.

Pharmacogenetic and Safety Assessments/Variables
5.3.1 Efficacy and Safety Measurements Assessed and Flow Chart
Study procedures described are listed in the following section of this protocol and are 
summarized in tabular format in Appendix C. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Procedures
The study procedures outlined in Appendix C are discussed in detail in this section, with 
the exception of study drug dispensing/compliance/accountability (Section 5.5.7), 
contraception counseling/contraceptive dispensing (Section 5.2.4), the collection of concomitant medication (Section 5.2.3) and adverse event information (Section 6.0).  All study data will be recorded on the eCRF with the exception of the e- Diary, select PRO 
data and data from central lab/imaging vendor. 
The Screening Period will occur within approximately 1.[ADDRESS_688805] dose of study drug on Day 1 (randomization).  For procedures repeated during the Screening Period (as allowed per protocol or at the discretion of the [COMPANY_013] TA MD), the procedure performed closest to dosing will serve as a baseline for clinical assessment.
Study procedures during the Treatment and Follow-Up Periods may be performed within 
the visit windows specified in the applicable sections of the protocol.  Scheduled monthly visits during the Treatment and Follow-Up Periods are based on a 28-day month.  All scheduled study visits during the Treatment and Follow-Up Periods should occur within ± [ADDRESS_688806] and endometrial biopsy may be performed within approximately ± [ADDRESS_688807] of care and clinical judgment, then clinical judgment should prevail and the [COMPANY_013] TA MD should be notified afterwards. 
Informed Consent
The IRB/IEC approved informed consent will be signed by [CONTACT_530425]/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_530360]- specific procedures.  Pharmacogenetic (PG) testing is optional and 
a subject must be provided a separate informed consent form for this blood and endometrial biopsy sample collection.  Details about how informed consent will be obtained and documented are provided in Section 9.3. 
Subjects who have signed informed consent and did not randomize on Day 1 because they 
either did not complete the Washout Period (if applicable), did not complete the study-specific procedures during the Screening Period or did not meet all entry criteria will be considered Screen Failures.  The reason(s) for screen failure will be recorded in the source documents and will be captured in the eCRF.  Subjects who re- screen will be 
required to sign a new informed consent form. 
Medical/Social History
A complete medical history, including documentation of any clinically significant medical 
conditions and medications, and history of tobacco and alcohol use, and licit/illicit drug abuse will be collected during the Washout Period (if applicable) or during the Screening Period for those subjects who do not require washout.  The medical history will be reviewed and should be updated if significant clinical findings are noted on Day 1 prior to dosing and will serve as the baseline for clinical assessment.
Elagolix
M14 -702 Protocol Amendment 7 
58
Gynecological and Endometriosis History 
A gynecological and endometriosis history will be collected either during the Washout 
Period (if applicable) or during the Screening Period for those who do not require washout. 
The gynecological and endometriosis history will be reviewed and should be updated if 
needed prior to dosing on Day 1 and will serve as the baseline for clinical assessment. 
Physical Examination 
A complete physical examination will include height (at Screening only) and weight 
measurements (the subject should wear lightweight clothing and not wear shoes) and will serve as the baseline for clinical assessment.
A brief, symptom-directed physical examination will be performed at Washout (if 
applicable).
Visits requiring either the complete physical examination (including weight) or a brief, 
symptom-directed physical examination are outlined in the Study Activities Table in Appendix C. 
Clinically significant physical examination findings prior to randomization will be 
recorded as medical history.  Any clinically significant physical examination findings after initiation of dosing will be recorded in the source documents and in the eCRFs as adverse events.  The complete physical examination performed during Screening will serve as the baseline for clinical assessment.
COVID-[ADDRESS_688808] is unable to go on site for the physical 
exam, it can be delayed up to one month from its scheduled time.  Should the delay be longer, [COMPANY_013] should be notified for further guidance.

12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG)
A resting 12-lead ECG will be conducted during the Screening Period.  The ECG should 
be obtained prior to any blood collection. 
For any abnormal screening test results, the ECG may be repeated one time prior to/on 
Day 1, however the subject may not be enrolled if any clinically significant findings are noted on the repeat ECG.  Final results (i.e., results used to determine eligibi lity) will be 
entered into the eCRF.
The Investigator or qualified designee at the study site will determine if any findings are 
clinically significant (in consultation with a cardiologist, if necessary), and document this on the ECG tracing/report, sign and date it.  The original ECG tracing or a certified copy of the original tracing with the physician's assessment will be retained in the subject's source records at the study site.

In this case, the local ultrasound reports will be maintained in the subject's source documents and copi[INVESTIGATOR_530362].  Data from the local ultrasound report will not be reported in the eCRF unless associated with an adverse event. 
The Screening TVU should ideally be performed during the subject's early proliferative 
phase of the menstrual cycle (approximately Days 4 – 8 of the cycle).  The Screening TVU may be repeated per protocol (e.g., ovarian cyst criteria) or as clinically appr opriate.
During the Treatment Period, a TVU will also be performed at Month 12, Month 24, Month 36, and Month 48 or the Premature Discontinuation (PD) visit (for subjects who prematurely discontinue at the time of or after their Treatment Month [ADDRESS_688816] had a study TVU within approximately 6 months prior to the PD visit).

changes in bone mineral density (BMD) at study visits as outlined in Appendix C.  Subjects will be asked about modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors, e.g., smoking and alcohol use, exercise habits, and dietary intake of calcium.  Information about exercise habits will be collected via the IPAQ.
[ADDRESS_688835] appropriately or subjects will be asked to enter their responses via an electronic tablet device.
Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)
The C -SSRS is a systematically administered instrument developed to track suicidal 
adverse events across a treatment study.  The instrument is designed to assess suicidal 
behavior and ideation, track and assess all suicidal events, as well as the lethality of attempts.  Additional features assessed include frequency, duration, controllability, reason for ideation, and deterrents.  The Screening- Baseline C -SSRS questionnaire will be 
administered by [CONTACT_530437] 1 (prior to randomization).  The C-SSRS, Since Last Visit questionnaire should be administered by [CONTACT_530438] C . 
During Screening or at the Day [ADDRESS_688836] year, either via answering "yes" to question 4 and/or question [ADDRESS_688837] (including possible discontinuation from the study and referral for appropriate psychiatric care).  The C -SSRS administered at the Day 1 visit will serve 
as the baseline for clinical assessment.

Opi[INVESTIGATOR_27310] (ORT)15
The Opi[INVESTIGATOR_27310] (ORT) is a self-report screening tool designed to assess risk for 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_530371].  The ORT will be administered to subjects and scored by [CONTACT_530439].  Subjects with a score of 8 or higher are not eligible for randomization. 
Health Care Resource Utilization (HCRU)
The Health Care Resource Utilization tool captures subject visits to non -study Health 
Care Practitioners prior to randomization and during the Treatment Period.  On Day 1, 
subjects will be asked to provide information on any visits to non-study Health Care Practitioners for non-study health visits over the last 4 weeks.  At subsequent Treatment Period study visits (on-site and phone call), subjects will be asked to provide information on any visits to non-study Health Care Practitioners for non-study health visits since their last scheduled monthly study visit (Treatment Month 1 to Treatment Month 24) or in the last six months (Treatment Month 25 to Treatment Month 48).  The subject's responses will be recorded on the HCRU worksheet by [CONTACT_7893]. 
COVID-[ADDRESS_688838] visits may be conducted via phone or video conference.  The PRO questionnaires and other scales (i.e., Overall Endometriosis Associated Pain C- SSRS, 
EHP -30, EQ-5D-5L
™ [version for interviewer administration must be used], WPAI:SHP, 
PROMIS Fatigue Short Form 6a, PGIC, and HCRU) may be administered by [CONTACT_530440]. 
In this situation, sites will read the PRO (or other questionnaire) questions and response 
options to the subject, record the subject's responses in the source, and transcribe into the electronic device provided to the site, as applicable.  The subject's a bility to view the PRO 
to understand the questions and response options should be preserved.  Sites may share the questionnaire by [CONTACT_340261] (email or hard copy) to 
Elagolix
M14 -[ADDRESS_688839] to allow them to read/understand the questions and responses when the subject 
is providing responses over the phone.  The date and time of PRO data collection should be recorded in the source along with who collected the information. 
Post-Treatment Assessment of Menstruation
Subjects will be asked about post-treatment to menses using the Return to Menses 
Questionnaire (Appendix H) in the Follow-Up Period, as outlined in Appendix C .  Site 
staff will ask subjects if they have had a menstrual period since discontinuation of study drug and record subjects' responses directly onto the paper questionnaire (which will then be entered into the eCRF).  If the subject indicates she has not r eturned to menses, site 
staff will continue to assess return to menstruation and repeat the questionnaire at subsequent follow-up visits, as applicable.  The date when menses returned will be documented in the source documents and eCRFs. 
Assignment of Subject Numbers
The site will contact [CONTACT_15017] (IRT) during the Washout or 
Screening Period to obtain a subject (Screening) number after the subject has signed the informed consent.  Consecutive and unique subject numbers within each site will be assigned.  The same subject number will be used to identify the subject throughout the study (Screening, Treatment and Follow-Up Periods).  If the subject is not randomized into the study on Day 1, the reason for screen failure will be documented in the eCRF and the site will register the subject as a screen failure in IRT.
Randomization/Study Drug Kit Assignment
Subjects are to be randomized between Cycle Days 1 – 10 of her menstrual cycle (Cycle 
Day [ADDRESS_688840] day with full menstrual flow); however, randomizations beyond Day [ADDRESS_688841]'s menstrual cycle must be discussed with the [COMPANY_013] TA MD prior to randomizing the subject and will be evaluated on a case by [CONTACT_413], including whether additional procedures are required. 
Elagolix
M14 -[ADDRESS_688842] session, a unique randomization number and study drug kit number will be assigned by [CONTACT_530441] a randomization schedule generated by [CONTACT_530442].  However, the randomization number will not be provided to the site and is strictly used within the system for tre atment 
assignment.  In order to maintain the blind through Treatment Month 12 for all subjects, at Month 6 subjects randomized to elagolix 200 mg BID alone on Day 1 will be re-assigned (in a blinded manner) to the elagolix 200 mg BID plus E2/NETA (1 mg/0.5 mg) QD treatment group via IRT and continue with this dosing regimen throughout the remainder of the Treatment Period (Months 7 – 48). 
During the Treatment Period, sites will register each on -site monthly visit in IRT in order 
to obtain the appropriate amount of scheduled re-supply of study drug to dispense to each 
subject.  (For example, the site will register the Treatment Month [ADDRESS_688843] 2 months' worth of study drug dispensed until the next on- site study visit at 
Treatment Month 10). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Collection and Handling of Exploratory Research Samples
Exploratory Research Samples
Subjects will have the option to provide samples for exploratory research.  Subjects may 
still participate in the main study even if they decide not to participate in this optional exploratory research. 
[COMPANY_013] (or people or companies working with [COMPANY_013]) will store the exploratory 
research samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality.  The samples will be retained while research on elagolix (or drugs of this class) o r this disease and related conditions continues, but for no longer than 20 years 
after study completion.  The procedure for obtaining and documenting informed consent

Section 9.3. 
Samples for Pharmacogenetic Exploratory Research
Two optional whole blood samples, one for DNA and a second for RNA will be collected on Day 1, Month 6, Month 12 and Premature Discontinuation Visit (if applicable) from each subject who consents to provide samples for exploratory research.  An endometrial sample for pharmacogenetic testing will be collected during Screening and at Month [ADDRESS_688844] who consents to provide samples for exploratory research. 
Samples will be shipped frozen to [COMPANY_013] or a designated laboratory for DNA and RNA 
extraction and long-term storage.  Instructions for the preparation and shipment of the pharmacogenetic exploratory research samples will be provided in a study- specific 
laboratory manual. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Collection and Handling of Pharmacodynamic Variables
A single blood sample will be collected at each timepoint as indicated in Appendix C to be used for the analysis of estradiol and potentially for additional testing (e.g., re- testing 
of hormone levels with an alternative methodology or for testing and potential validation of exploratory biomarkers for endometriosis).  The blood samples for assay of estradiol will be collected by [CONTACT_530443] 7 mL evacuated collection tube without anticoagulant (red cap, no gel separators to be used).  Sufficient blood volume will be collected to provide approximately 3 mL serum from each sample.  Refer to the study specific laboratory manual for detailed instructions on sample collection, processing and shipment. 
The date and time of collection will be recorded in the source documentation.  The Day 1 
sample will be obtained pre- dose; samples collected at all other visits can be drawn at any

These procedures should not interfere with the initiation of any new treatments or therapeutic modalities the Investigator determines are necessary to treat the subject's condition.  The reason(s) for the discontinuation from the Treatment Period will b e recorded.  Subjects who 
prematurely discontinue at the time of or after the Month [ADDRESS_688851] and fetus/infant. 
If a subject requires surgery (e.g., laparoscopy, hysterectomy, ovarian cystectomy) for the 
management of their endometriosis during the Treatment Period, study drug should be discontinued and the Premature Discontinuation visit should be completed prior to surgery, if possible. 
If a subject is discontinued from the study with an ongoing adverse event or an unresolved 
laboratory result that is clinically significant (as determined by [CONTACT_737]), the Investigator will attempt to provide follow -up until a satisfactory clinica l resolution of the 
laboratory result or adverse event is achieved. 
If a subject is being discontinued from the study prior to the completion of Treatment 
Month 6 time point, a mammogram (only for subjects ≥ 40 years of age), DXA, TVU, Pap test, or endometrial biopsy does not need to be performed. 
In addition, if a subject is being discontinued from the study due to a documented Z- score 
or T- score result of < –2.5, BMD decrease from baseline of > 8%, or TA MD assessment, 
an additional DXA scan does not need to be performed as a part of the Premature 
Discontinuation visit procedures. 
Upon discontinuation from the Treatment Period, all used and unused study drug 
containers should be returned to the study site.

[IP_ADDRESS] Blinding of Investigational Product
The active elagolix dose will be identical in appearance to its matched placebo; each 
active E2/NETA dose will be identical in appearance to its matched placebo.  The study site personnel and subject will remain blinded to each subject's treatment throughout the course of the study. 
The IRT will provide access to blinded subject treatment information during the study.  
[COMPANY_013] must be notified before the blind is broken, unless identification of the study drug is required for medical emergency; i.e., situation in which the knowledge of the specific blinded treatment will affect the immediate management of the subject/patient's conditions (e.g., antidote is available).  [COMPANY_013] must then be notified within [ADDRESS_688858] be recorded in the source documents and eCRF, as applicable.
5.5.6 Treatment Compliance
The Investigator or his/her designated and qualified representatives will 
administer/dispense study drug only to subjects enrolled in the study in accordance with the protocol.  The study drug must not be used for reasons other than that described in the protocol. 
Subjects will be instructed to return all study drug kits (even if empty, unused or 
damaged) to the study site personnel at study visits throughout the Treatment Period, or Premature Discontinuation visit (if applicable).  The study site personnel will ass ess 
compliance at on -site visits.
Subjects should be advised of the importance of treatment compliance.  Study drug should be taken consistently at approximately the same time in the morning and evening each day.

Through the Open Label Treatment Period, compliance packaging blister cards will not be used and blister cards without compliance packaging will be used instead.  Study site personnel will assess study drug compliance after review of the study drug blister cards returned by [CONTACT_530455]-site visits.  The subject will be asked at each study visit (on-site and phone) to provide the dates and approximate times of the last [ADDRESS_688860] access to the dosing and compliance 
data; sites are expected to scan all returned compliance packaging blister cards to obtain the dosing information at each of the on-site treatment Period visits when study drug is returned to the site by [CONTACT_423].  Any unused/unopened compliance packaging blister cards should be documented as such in the scanning technology source documentation.  Sites are expected to use the compliance data to guide them in discussions with the subject regarding the importance of treatment compliance.  Upon reviewing the dosing data, if the date(s) and time(s) for any of the last 4 doses of study drug (elagolix or E2/NETA or placebo) prior to the monthly Treatment Period visit or Premature Discontinuation visit are missing, the subject will be asked to confirm whether doses were taken and to provide the dates and approximate times of the last [ADDRESS_688861] subjects not to remove extra or multiple tablets/capsules from the 
blister cards all at once (e.g., transferring multiple doses into a separate pi[INVESTIGATOR_279551]) and should only remove the study drug from the blister when it is the time to take the dose.  If the compliance data shows incidence of removing a number of extra tablets/capsules, sites

DXA is a standard accepted measure of bone mineral density, and will be utilized to 
assess the effect of elagolix following therapy.  Given the known relationship between estradiol levels and bone loss, serum E2 measurements will also be utilized to assess potential bone effects of elagolix. 
Subjects will be counseled at every visit on the importance of pregnancy prevention and 
use of appropriate and effective methods of contraception throughout the study as outlined in Section 5.2.4.

development program supports the ability of elagolix to reduce endometriosis- associated 
pain at both the 150 mg QD and 200 mg BID dose levels in a dose-dependent fashion 
(higher responder rate for 200 mg BID than for 150 mg QD).  Also consistent with E2 suppression and findings from previous elagolix studies, there was a dose dependent 
effect on BMD, such that longer duration of treatment with the higher elagolix dose (200 mg BID) would likely require concomitant use of hormonal add back therapy to mitigate  BMD loss.  Furthermore, data from the Phase 2b study of elagolix in subjects 
with heavy menstrual bleeding due to uterine fibroids demonstrated the effect of E2/NETA on mitigating the BMD decrease associated with elagolix 300 mg BID.  E2/NETA is approved for the prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal (estrogen -deficient) women.
As such, the elagolix 200 mg BID dose, in combination with E2/NETA add-back therapy was selected for this Phase [ADDRESS_688868]/device after it is released for distribution.

6.1.1 Definitions
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can th erefore 
be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product. 
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  Any worsening of a pre-existing condition or illness is considered an adverse event.  Any worsening of a subject's endometriosis-associated pain during the course of the study will not be captured as an adverse event unless it meets the criteria for a serious adverse event (Section [IP_ADDRESS]), at which point, it will be reported as such.  Worsening in severity of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse event.  Laboratory abnormalities, changes in BMD (during the Treatment Period) and changes in vital signs 
Elagolix
M14 -702 Protocol Amendment 7 
105
are considered to be adverse events only if they result in discontinuation from the study, 
necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, and/or if the Investigator considers them to be adverse events.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an 
adverse event if the surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre-existing condition and the surgery/procedure has been pre-planned prior to study entry.  However, if the pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly during the study (e.g., surgery performed 
earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an adverse event. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to [COMPANY_013] as a 
serious adverse event (SAE) within [ADDRESS_688870]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  This does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in fetal loss.
Persistent or Significant Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject.  Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively 
minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarr hea, influenza, and accidental trauma 
(e.g., sprained ankle).

hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital anomaly, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity).  Additionally, any elective or spontaneous abortion or 
stillbirth is considered an important medical event.  
Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events of Special Interest
Some adverse events, such as SAEs and adverse events of special interest (AESI), may 
require additional information to be collected, including family history.  AESIs include, but are not limited to rash/hypersensitivity, fracture, neuro-psychiatric (depression, mood swings, etc.) and vasomotor symptoms (hot flush, night sweats). 
6.1.2 Adverse Event Severity
The Investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity of each adverse 
event:
Mild The adverse event is transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423].
Moderate The adverse event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the 
subject's usual activities.
Severe The adverse event causes considerable interference with the subject's usual activities and may be incapacitating or life -threatening. 
Elagolix

6.1.3 Relationship to Study Drug
The Investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of study drug: 
Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative 
causes, there is sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a 
causal relationship.
No Reasonable PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, 
biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative 
causes, there is insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship.
For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being 
related to the study drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug will be considered "not as sociated."  
In addition, when the Investigator has not reported a causality or deemed it not assessable, [COMPANY_013] will consider the event associated. 
If an Investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1101] "no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug" is 
given, an Other cause of event must be provided by [CONTACT_530457].

Diary using the daily e-Diary.  The elagolix plus E2/NETA dose group will need to 
demonstrate a statistically significantly greater proportion of responders for both co-primary endpoints (DYS and NMPP) in order for the elagolix plus E2/NETA dose group to be considered more efficacious than placebo for the co-primary endpoints.   
For each of the co -primary endpoints, the criterion for defining a subject as a responder at 
Month 6 of the Treatment Period will include a reduction of X or greater from baseline in 
pain as well as no increased analgesic rescue use for endometriosis -assoc iated pain.
The specific drugs allowed for rescue analgesic use will be the following:
●NSAIDs (Naproxen 200 mg, ibuprofen 200 mg, diclofenac 25 mg, celecoxib 
50 mg ) 
●opi[INVESTIGATOR_530374] (5 mg Hydrocodone + 300 or 325 mg 
acetaminophen, 30 mg codeine + 300 mg acetaminophen) 
The subjects will record use of these rescue analgesic medications on a daily basis in the 
e-Diary.
The definition of increased analgesic use is as follows: 
●The average pi[INVESTIGATOR_530375] [ADDRESS_688886] dose of study medication. 
●For the primary endpoints of DYS and NMPP, subjects will be considered nonresponders if they have a 15% or greater increase in average pi[INVESTIGATOR_530376] I . 
The rescue analgesic use for any defined period will be based on the average pi[INVESTIGATOR_530377] (endometriosis -associated):  NSAID and opi[INVESTIGATOR_530378] 
(NSAID or opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]).  The total pi[INVESTIGATOR_530379], as reported in the e- Diary 
during the time period of interest.  For the purposes of the rescue analgesic analysis, the 
Elagolix
M14 -702 Protocol Amendment 7 
118
number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_530380] (NSAID or opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]) will be 
considered equivalent for the primary analysis, regardless of specific pi[INVESTIGATOR_530381], e.g., average NSAID pi[INVESTIGATOR_530382]  3and will 
not be conducted separately by [CONTACT_530461]. 
The pain threshold X will be determined at the end of the placebo- controlled treatment 
period prior to any unblinded analysis.  The calculation of the threshold will be based on a 
receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis described below.
For both DYS and NMPP, responses of "None," "Mild," "Moderate," and "Severe" will be 
assigned a score of 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. 
The average pain score for DYS or NMPP for Month [ADDRESS_688887]'s mean score for dysmenorrhea is undefined numerically for a time point because her d aily 
e-Diary reports indicate she did not experience her period on any days during the 35 calendar day time period, then mean score for DYS for that time point will be set equal to zero (which reflects the absence of any dysmenorrhea during that reporting time period). 
For each of the co -primary endpoints, the criterion for defining a subject as a pain 
responder at Month 6 will be a reduction of X or greater from baseline.  The threshold for 
response in the responder analysis (i.e., the value of X) will be chosen to repr esent a 
clinically meaningful reduction in pain.  The threshold will be determined based on a ROC analysis using the PGIC at Month 6 as an anchor and change from baseline at Month 6.  The PGIC is a 7-point response scale:  "Since I started taking the study medication, my endometriosis related pain has:  very much improved (1), much improved (2), minimally improved (3), no change (4), minimally worse (5), much worse (6), very much worse (7)." 
The responses of "much improved" and "very much improved" on PGIC will be used to 
define responders, and the threshold for response (the value of X) will be chosen to 
Elagolix
M14 -[ADDRESS_688888] to 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity.  No other covariates will be included in the ROC analysis.  All available subjects will be included in the ROC analysis.  For subjects who prematurely discontinue before Month 6, the last available observation prior to discontinuation (Last Observation Carried Forward) will be used in the ROC analysis. 
The ROC analysis may identify different response thresholds for DYS and NMPP.  The 
results of the ROC analysis, containing the determined threshold, will be included in the final Statistical Analysis Plan prior to blind break.
The primary analysis of the co -primary endpoint will be based on a logistic regression 
model including treatment as the main factor and baseline pain score as a covariate to 
compare the elagolix plus E2/NETA dose group to placebo.  For subjects who prematu rely discontinue before or at Month [ADDRESS_688889] (LOCF) will be used in the primary responder analysis. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Sensitivity Analyses of the Primary Efficacy Variable
The following sensitivity analyses for each of the co-primary endpoints of the proportion 
of responders at Month 6 in pain scores will be conducted: 
1. The difference between the elagolix plus E2/NETA and placebo in response rates 
will be analyzed using a chi-square test with a corresponding 95% CI for the difference in response rate based on normal approximation to the binomial distribution. 
2. All subjects who prematurely discontinue the study drug at or before Month 6 will 
be considered as non-responders and the primary analysis will be repeated.  Subjects who discontinue after Month 6 will be categorized as responders/non-responders in the same manner as done in the primary analysis. 
Elagolix

3. The primary analysis will be repeated using mixed-imputation.  In particular, 
subjects who discontinue prior to or at Month 6 due to an adverse event (AE) or 
lack of efficacy will be considered non-responders, while subjects who discontinue prior to or at Month [ADDRESS_688890] following the LOCF rules previously described.  Subjects who do not discontinue before Month 6 will be categorized as responders/non-responders in the same manner as done in the primary analysis.
4. All subjects who switched NSAIDs use at Baseline or Month 6 will be considered 
as non- responders and the primary analysis will be repeated.
5. All subjects who switched NSAIDs use at Baseline or Month 6 will be excluded 
from the primary analysis.
6. The following rules will be used to standardize different NSAIDs use and opi[INVESTIGATOR_173942].  The standardized rescue analgesic use will be re-evaluated based on Table 1
and the primary analysis will be repeated.
●NSAID:  1 pi[INVESTIGATOR_530383] = 1 pi[INVESTIGATOR_530384] = 1 pi[INVESTIGATOR_530385] = 4 pi[INVESTIGATOR_530386] = 1 pi[INVESTIGATOR_530387] 
●Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]:  1 pi[INVESTIGATOR_530388] + acetaminophen = 1 pi[INVESTIGATOR_530389] + 
acetaminophen = 1 pi[INVESTIGATOR_530390] 
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Efficacy Variables
A pre -specified multiple testing approach will be applied to maintain the family -wise 
type I error rate for the co -primary and key secondary endpoints.  In order to test the key 
secondary endpoints, the null hypothesis for the co-primary endpoints for elagolix 
200 BID plus E2/NETA versus placebo must be rejected.  Subsequently, the key secondary endpoints may be tested following the multiple-testing procedure defined in the statistical analysis plan.
The key secondary measures of the Treatment Period that will be tested will include the

●Change from baseline for the PROMIS Fatigue short Form 6A T- Score.
The analyses for those other efficacy endpoints will be conducted at an alpha level of 0.05 
without multiplicity adjustment.  95% CIs will be constructed as needed.  Analysis details will be specified in the SAP.
Statistical Analyses for Secondary and Other Efficacy Variables
Generally, for continuous variables, including change from baseline analyses, treatment 
group differences will be analyzed as appropriate using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models with treatment group as the main effect and baseline score as a covariate.  The mixed model with repeated measures (MMRM) method for change from baseline to each post-baseline assessment during the placebo controlled Treatment Period will be conducted as appropriate. 
Categorical data will be analyzed using CMH test, chi -square, Fisher's exact test or 
logistic regression as appropriate. During Months 13 – 48, visit values and change from baseline to each visit will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_530463] 8.1.1.  No statistical tests of data from Months 13 – 48 will be performed. 
Analysis details will be specified in the SAP.
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_688891] 12 months of the placebo 
controlled treatment period in DYS and NMPP will be analyzed for each monthly visit.  Monthly mean scores will be the average of the daily values reported during the 35 calendar days prior to and including the reference study day as defined in the SAP for the specific time point.
Elagolix
M14 -702 Protocol Amendment 7 
123
The proportion of responders in DYS and NMPP at Months 1 – 12 will be compared 
between the elagolix plus E2/NETA dosing group and the placebo group, based on the threshold for response determined for the primary analysis. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Dyspareunia
For dyspareunia, responses of "None," "Mild," "Moderate," and "Severe" will be assigned 
a score of 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively.  The dyspareunia monthly mean scores will be calculated as described above for DYS and NMPP.  Responses of "Not applicable" wil l be 
excluded from the calculation.  If a subject's mean score is not defined because all reports in that month are "Not applicable," then that mean score will be treated as a missing value and will not be included in analyses. 
The proportion of responders at each post-baseline Months 1 – 12 visit will be compared 
between the elagolix plus E2/NETA dosing group and the placebo group.  The threshold for defining responders will be determined using the same ROC method described for DYS and NMPP.
The mean change from baseline to each visit during the first 12 months of the Treatment 
Period in dyspareunia will be summarized similar to the method for DYS and NMPP.  Monthly mean scores will be the average of the daily values reported during the 35 cal endar days prior to and including the reference study day as defined in the SAP for 
the specific time point.
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_688892] will be calculated for the following analgesic categories:  (a) NSAID or opi[INVESTIGATOR_530391], and (b) opi[INVESTIGATOR_530392].  The perc entage of 
Elagolix
M14 -[ADDRESS_688893] 12 months of the treatment 
period in percentage of days as well as monthly average dose of endometriosis analgesic use for each analgesic category will be compared between the elagolix plus E2/NE TA 
dosing group and the placebo group.  Baseline will be calculated as percentage of days of endometriosis analgesic use for each analgesic category during the last [ADDRESS_688894] 12 months of the placebo controlled treatment period will be calculated by [CONTACT_530464][INVESTIGATOR_530393] 35 calendar day period immediately prior to and including the day of the reference study day, except for Month 1, and dividing over the length of the window, generally equal to 35.  For Month 1, average values will be based on data collected between Study Day 1 and the Month 1 reference study day. 
[IP_ADDRESS].4 Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)
The number and percentage of subjects in each PGIC response category will be 
summarized monthly for the first 12 months of the placebo controlled treatment period for each treatment group and compared between the elagolix plus E2/NETA treatment group and the placebo group. 
The percentage of subjects with response of "Much Improved" or "Very Much Improved" 
will be summarized.
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_688895] 12 months of the placebo controlled treatment period, the mean change from 
baseline to each visit average NRS scores will be summarized for each treatment group and compared between the elagolix plus E2/NETA treatment group and the placebo

group.  The change in overall endometriosis-associated pain questionnaire NRS during 
Months 13 – 48 will be summarized.
[IP_ADDRESS] Multiple Comparisons
The co -primary endpoint for the elagolix 200 BID plus E2/NETA group will be tested 
versus placebo and an α = 0.050 level.
The key secondary endpoints will be tested following a pre -specified multiple testing 
procedure to control the Type I error rate and will be described in the Statistical Analysis 
Plan.
8.1.7 Safety
[IP_ADDRESS] General Considerations
All randomized subjects who took at least one dose of the study drug will be included in 
the safety analyses.
During the placebo-controlled treatment period (Months 1 – 12), baseline for all subjects 
will refer to the data obtained prior to Day 1.  During the non- placebo controlled 
treatment period (Months 13 – 48), baselines will be defined as follows.  For subje cts 
randomized to elagolix or elagolix plus E2/NETA on Study Day 1, baseline for these subjects will refer to the baseline prior to the first dose of elagolix at the time of randomization.  For subjects randomized to placebo in the first 12 months of the t reatment 
period, their baseline will be reset to the data collected prior to reassignment at Month 13. 
In general, for continuous variables, descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, 
median, minimum and maximum) will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  The treatment group differences in change and percent change from baseline will be analyzed using a one-way ANOVA with treatment as the main effect, or in some cases, one- way ANCOVA 
with treatment as the main effect, and baseline as a covariate.  This will be detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan.
Elagolix
M14 -702 Protocol Amendment 7 
126
Categorical data will be summarized with frequencies and percentages by [CONTACT_6490].  Fisher's exact test (or its generalization to r × c tables) will be used to analyze treatment group differences for qualitative categorical variables.
Unless specified otherwise, missing safety data will not be imputed. Analysis details will be specified in the SAP.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events
Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) dictionary.  Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be 
summarized for each treatment group.  TEAEs are defined as AEs with a start date on or after t he first dose of the study drug and within [ADDRESS_688896] dose of the study drug.  
AEs starting more than 30 days following discontinuation of the study drug will not be included in the summaries of TEAEs. 
Frequencies and percentages of subjects with TEAEs will be calculated for each treatment 
group as follows: 
●Any event 
●By [CONTACT_9313], and preferred term 
●By [CONTACT_9313], preferred term and maximum relationship 
●By [CONTACT_9313], preferred term and maximum severity 
●Any event and by [CONTACT_112796] 
●Any event and by [CONTACT_112797] 
●Any event and preferred term for AESI's (e.g., hypoestrogenic adverse events)

●ovarian cysts 
8.1.8 Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics
Plasma concentrations of elagolix and norethindrone and serum concentrations of estradiol will be listed for each subject by [CONTACT_112799], as applicable.  Pharmacokinetic data may be combined with data from other studies in women.  Exposure-response analyses may be conducted as appropriate.  For example, if pharmacokinetic exposures are estimated, analyses may be conducted to assess the relationship of pharmacokinetic parameters and estradiol concentrations, versus efficacy and safety.  Additional analyses will be performed if useful and appropriate. 
8.2 Determination of Sample Size
Approximately 700 subjects will be randomized in a 4:1:2 ratio to elagolix 200 mg BID 
plus E2/NETA (N = 400), elagolix 200 mg BID alone (N = 100) or placebo (N = 200).  Assuming NMPP responder rates of 54% for the elagolix with E2/NETA therapy dose group and 35% for placebo, and DYS responder rates of 59% for the elagolix with E2/NETA therapy dose group and 23% for placebo, these sample sizes provide greater than 90% power to detect a difference in response rate between elagolix with E2/NETA and placebo, based on a 2- sided test at the significance level of α = 0.05.  The above 
sample size was calculated using nQuery advisor 7.0.

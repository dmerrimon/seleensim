This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study will be carried out in accordance with the applicable U nited States  government regulations and Mayo Clinic research 
policies and procedures.  
1.1 Background 
Monoclonal gammopathy (MG) are well known to cause kidney damage. The most common 
example is light chain deposition disease that occurs commonly in the setting of multiple myeloma.
[ADDRESS_90942] the 
term monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance (MGRS) has been introduced to capture kidney lesions associated with monoclonal gammopathy (MG) in the absence of multiple myelom a.
3 One of the lesions commonly encountered in patients with MGRS is proliferative 
glomerulonephritis with monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition (PGNMID) were damage is caused by [CONTACT_83394].
4-6 Another is C3 
glomerulopathy (C3 GN) in the setting of MG where the monoclonals result in activation of 
complement pathway and indirectly result in renal injur y.7-[ADDRESS_90943] a progressive course with loss of renal function over time. Up to 70% of patients with PGNMID may have negative serum electrophoresis with immunofixation, normal serum free light chains and no clone may be identified on bone marrow biopsy.
[ADDRESS_90944] or second line agent in patients 
with PGNMID and C3GN associated with MG.  
1.2 Investigational Agent 
Daratumumab is an IgG1 -kappa human monoclonal antibody that binds to the CD38 
transmembrane glycoprotein on the surface of tumor cells and induces apoptosis. This process is 
mediated through Fc mediated cross linking and immune- mediated cell lysis through 
complement dependent cytotoxicity, antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity and antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis . It has an elimination half -time of 18 days and volume of 
distribution of 4.7L. Daratumumab is FDA approved for use in treatment of multiple myeloma, however is not approved for treatment of  the condition under study, PGNMID and C3 GN 
associated with MG .  The study was submitted by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_83375].   
Daratumumab in PGNMID/C3GN   Version 2.0 
 Revised 6/[ADDRESS_90945] was a phase 1 -2 study published in NEJM which 
evaluated the efficacy and safety of daratumumab in 42 patients. Overall 36% of patients had complete or partial response. The second study was an open label phase [ADDRESS_90946] common adverse events but no drug-
related adverse events led to tr eatment discontinuation. 
 
1.4 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits 
The dose of daratumumab that has proven to be effective in patients with multiple myeloma is 16 
mg/kg started once weekly for 8 weeks followed by [CONTACT_83395] 16 weeks, and then once every 4 weeks thereafter. We will be using similar dose (16 mg/kg) and similar dosing interval for a total of [ADDRESS_90947] is infusion -related reaction 
(48%). We aim to use the same pre and post treatment regimen (including corticosteroid, 
diphenhydramine and acetaminophen) as has been done in the previous trials.  Serious adverse effects include anemia , grade 3 or 4 (19%), lymphocytopenia grade 3 or 4 (40%), neutropenia, 
grade 3 or 4 (20%), t hrombocytopenia, Grade 3 or 4 (18%), and increased risk of infection 
specifically p neumonia (11%) .  Common adverse effects include nausea (27% ), anemia all 
grades (45% ), lymphocytopenia a ll grades (72%), neutropenia all grades (60% ), 
thrombocytopenia all grades (48%), b ackache (23%) , cough (21%), upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416] 
(20%), fatigue (39% ), fever (21% ). 
 The treatment options for patients with PGNMID or C3GN associated with monoclonal gammopathy are limited with variable success. If untreated, majority of patients will progress to endstage renal disease. The current therapeutic options include rituximab vs. cyclophosphamide and prednisone with or without bortezomib. Daratumumab has a similar if not better side- effect 
profile to the above-mentioned treatment options and therefore we believe the risks associated with daratumumab are acceptable.   
2 Study Objectives  
Primary Objective  
To assess the safety of daratumumab in patients with PGNMID or C3GN associated with monoclonal gammopathy.  Secondary Objective  To assess the efficacy of daratumumab in inducing complete or partial remission in patients with PGNMID or C3GN associated with monoclonal gammopathy as measured by [CONTACT_83396].

3.1 General Design  
 
This study is an open- label phase 2 trial of the safety and efficacy of daratumumab , in the 
treatment of PGNMID and C3GN associated with monoclonal gammopathy.  Subjects will be screened at outpatient  Nephrology Clinic visit appointments and interested qualified subjects will 
be consented and offered participation in this trial.  Once consent has been obtained baseline values will be established and subjects will begin treatment and follow -up for the next 12 
months.  Daratumumab will be administered once weekly for 8 weeks and then once every 2 weeks for 8 additional doses.  Patients will be followed for a total of 12 months ([ADDRESS_90948] infusion).   A final visit for evaluation and collection of lab samples will be conducted at the end of the study.  
3.[ADDRESS_90949] consented to the 
OLE  and achieved complete or partial remission, will be followed for 24 months 
following completion of the main trial. In the OLE, patie nts will be assessed  every 3 to 6 
months. Relapse is defined as a 30% increase in proteinuria from the lowest level the 
patient has achieved and will be documented with two 24 hour urine collections two weeks apart.  If there is evidence of relapse, patients will receive 12 additional doses of  daratumumab(16 mg/kg).  The first [ADDRESS_90950] 4 doses will be administered every other week.  Primary Endpoints 
Incidence of major infection (defined as the development of pneumonia, severe urinary tract infection/pyelonephritis, sepsis, meningitis), grade 3 or 4 anemia, leukopenia or thrombocytopenia and changes in HgB, WBC count and platelet count from baseline to 6 month and 12 month timepoints. 
3.3 Secondary   Endpoints

5.4 Preparation and Administration of Study Drug  
 
Study drug will be prepared in the research pharmacy.   Pretreatment:  Fifteen minutes prior to the first infusion, [ADDRESS_90956] Infusio n and those part of OLE being retreated due to relapse (16 mg/Kg): IV infusion 
in 1000 mL 0.9% NaCl  via 0.2 or 0.22 micron in-line filter, beginning at 50 mL/hr. Increase by 
50 mL/hr every 60 minutes, as tolerated, to a maximum rate of 200 mL/ hr. Vital signs will be 
taken every [ADDRESS_90957] hour, then every hour until end of infusion, and then again after IV flush.    
 Second Infusion (16mg/Kg):  IV infusion in 500 mL 0.9% NaCl  via 0.2 or 0.22 micron in- line 
filter, beginning at 50 mL/hr. Increase by 50 mL/hr every 60 minutes, as tolerated, to maximum rate of 200 mL/hr. If the first infusion was not well tolerated (infusion- related reaction > Grade 
1), then instructions for the first infusion should be used. Vital signs will be taken every [ADDRESS_90958] hour, then every hour until end of infusion, and then again after IV flush.    Subsequent Infusions (16 mg/Kg) : IV infusion in 500 mL 0.9% NaCl  via 0.2 or 0.22 micron in-
line filter, beginning at 100 mL/hr. Increase by 50 mL/hr every 60 minutes, as tolerated, to 
maximum rate of 200 mL/hr. If the previous infusion was not well tolerated (infusion- related 
reaction > Grade 1), then instructions for the second infusion will be us ed. Vital signs will be 
taken every [ADDRESS_90959] hour, then every hour until end of infusion, and then again after IV flush.    
 Infusion related reactions:  Diphenhydramine [ADDRESS_90960]-infusion:  All patients should receive dexamethasone [ADDRESS_90961] daratumumab infusion, 
patients will also start single strength Bactrim  once  a day (or its equivalent) to prevent 
opportunistic infections, including pneumocystis pneumonia . Treatment with Bactrim will 
continue for six months after the last daratumumab infusion.    A worksheet will be created specifically for this study, which would include a dose calculation with a double check by [CONTACT_83400].  The drug will be prepared in the following steps.

5.[ADDRESS_90963] as part of the research study with blood and urine studies and clinic visits to ensure safety.     
5.6 Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
 
The patient should be off of all immunosuppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (cyclophosphamide, MMF, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, azathioprine, ACTH) within three months of enrollment in the study. If patient has received rituximab prior to the study there should be evidence of B- cell reconstitution 
prior to enrollment (CD 20 count>5).  The subject should be off of prednisone or glucocorticoid equivalent in the last  6 weeks  prior to enrollment, unless they are being treated with low dose 
oral prednisone or glucocorticoid for a condition unrelated to PGNMID or C3GN (e.g., asthma, gout) at a daily dose of 10mg or less. Patients can receive ACE -I or ARB while enrolled in the study but dose adjustment is not 
allowed unless down titration for safety reasons.   Rescue treatment is not permitted while receiving daratumumab. If patient is  failing treatment 
with evidence of disease progression (> 50% increase in proteinuria and > 30% reduction in GFR based on creatinine clearance) on visit day 77, the subject will be withdrawn from the study and can then receive ot her immunosuppressive therapy per discretion of the treating physician.  
Management of Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation 
Primary antiviral prophylaxis is permitted as per local standard of care.  Per protocol, HBV DNA 
testing by [CONTACT_83401] 6. 
For subjects who are diagnosed with HBV reactivation while on treatment, study treatment should be interrupted until the infection is adequately controlled. If the benefits outweigh the risks, study 
treatment may  be resumed with concomitant antiviral prophylaxis as per local standard of care. 
Consult a liver disease specialist as clinically indicated.

5.7 Packaging 
 
Commercially available supplies of daratumumab will be obtained for use in this study.  Daratumumab is supplied in glass vials containing daratumumab at a concentration of 20 mg/mL. These will remain in the commercial packaging until prepared by [CONTACT_56636].  After infusion preparation by [CONTACT_56636], the final infusion wi ll be 
labeled as follows: "Caution: New Drug-- Limited by [CONTACT_4496] (or [LOCATION_002]) law to 
investigational use." 
 
5.8 Masking/ Blinding of Study  
 This is an open-label study and all participants will be receiving the study drugs. There will be no blinding or masking.    
5.9 Receiving, Storage, Dispensing and Return 
5.9.1 Receipt of Drug Supplies  
Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC  will ship the study medication directly to the Mayo Clinic 
Research Pharmacy.  Mayo Clinic Research Pharmacy will
 ensure maintenance of complete and 
accurate records of the receipt, dispensation, and disposal of all the study drug in compliance with 
regulatory and institutional requirements. .  Any discrepancies, damaged or unusable study drug in 
a given shipment (active drug or comparator) will be documented in the study files. The sponsor-
investigator will be notified immediately of any discrepancies, damaged or unusable products that are received.   
5.9.2 Storage 
Research Pharmacy will store the study medication in a refrigerator specifically delegated for Research use only.   The temperature is monitored electronically 24/7, 365 days/year. All study 
drug vials will be  stored in in a refrigerator ranging from 2°C to 8°C (36ºF to 46ºF) and will not 
be utilized after the expi[INVESTIGATOR_83379]. The product must be protected from light so it will be kept in the boxes that it is shipped in until its use . The drug must not be frozen. 
Daratumumab does not contain preservatives; therefore any unused portion remaining in the vial must be discarded. The Research Pharmacy is a separate area within the Central Pharmacy.   To 
enter the pharmacy, it requires identification badge scanning.  Only pharmacy personnel have access to the pharmacy. 
 
5.9.3 Dispensing of Study Drug

Daratumumab in PGNMID/C3GN   Version 2.0 
 Revised 6/[ADDRESS_90967] the 
hypotheses described below.  Twelve subjects will be enrolled in the study.  
 7.2   Statistical Methods  
Descriptive Statistics  
Univariate descriptive statistics and frequency distributions will be calculated, as appropriate for 
all variables.  Baseline values for demographic, clinical, and outcome variables (primary and secondary)  in each response category  will be tabulated. Time -to-response will be analyzed 
descriptively with Kaplan -Meier method.   
 For the primary endpoint, the number and proportion of patients w ith treatment- emergent major 
infections, grade 3 or 4 anemia, leukopenia or thrombocytopenia will be summarized. Changes in Hgb, WBC count and platelet count from baseline (Day 0) will be analyzed through a paired t-test by [CONTACT_83403]- baseline to basel ine values. The secondary endpoint of the proportion of 
patients with complete or partial response will be summarized in a similar manner.  
 It is expected that [ADDRESS_90968] complete data available.   
   Primary Hypothesis: Daratumumab is safe and well -tolerated in patients with PGNMID and 
C3GN associated with monoclonal gammopathy  
 To test this hypothesis, the incidence of major infection will be examined, specifically the development of pneumonia, severe urinary tract infection/pyelonephritis, sepsis, meningitis will be reported.  In addition, anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia will be examined by [CONTACT_83404], WBC count and platelet count , respectively . Statistical significance will be 
assessed using paired t -test comparing 6 months and 1 year value compared to baseline. The

 Revised 6/[ADDRESS_90969] (drop in blood counts, 
infection) will also be reported.  Second ary Hypothesis:  Daratumumab is effective in inducing remission (defined as 
improvement in proteinuria and eGFR) in patients with PGNMID and C3GN associated with monoclonal gammopathy  A paired t -test will be performed to assess change in  proteinuria and renal function at 6 months 
and 12 months compared to baseline (screening visit).  
      
Daratumumab in PGNMID/C3GN   Version 2.0 
 Revised 6/[ADDRESS_90970] (DSMB) comprised of clinical re searchers not 
affiliated with the study will be established and responsible for evaluating the ongoing progress of the study.  The DSMB will communicate by [CONTACT_83405] [ADDRESS_90971] in an advisory capacity to 
the PI’s to monitor participant safety,  data quality and evaluate the progress of the study.  
7.[ADDRESS_90972] Population(s) for Analysis  
All-treated population:  Any subject that received at least one dose of study drug. 
8 Safety and Adverse Events  
The primary side effects associated with daratumumab include anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia and these will be evaluated initially by [CONTACT_83406] 21, 49, 77, 105, 133, 161 and then every 3 months done on Day 264, 365. Further, the se will be evaluated 
during OLE laboratory assessments.  Other side effects include risk of infection specifically pneumonia and patients will be asked about any sings of symptoms suggestive of infection (e.g fever, cough) or any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], emergency department visits or other doctor visits at the clinical visits on Day 49, 77, 133, 161, 264, 365 and during OLE when laboratory assessments are completed or an infusion is administered Other side effects include symptoms of nausea and fatigue and similarly patients 
will be asked regarding these symptoms at the time of clinic visits  and during OLE when 
laboratory assessments are completed or an infusion is administered.  
8.1 Definitions  
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to S ubjects or Others  (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845])  
Any unanticipated problem or adverse event that meets the following three criteria:  
• Serious: Serious problems or events that results in significant harm, (which may be 
physical, psychological, financial, social, economic, or legal) or increased risk for the 
subject or others (including individuals who are not research subjects). These include: ( 1) 
death; (2) life threatening adverse experience; (3) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] - inpatient, new, or prolonged; (4) disability/incapacity - persistent or significant; (5) birth defect/anomaly; (6) breach of confidentiality and (7) other problems, events, or new information (i.e. publications, DSMB reports, interim findings, product labeling change) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_14846], safety, or welfare of the subjects or others, or substantially compromise the research data, AND  
• Unanticipated: (i.e. unexpected) problems or events are those that are not already 
described as potential risks in the protocol, consent document, not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure, or not part of an underlying disease. A problem or event is 
Daratumumab in PGNMID/C3GN   Version 2.0 
 Revised 6/272019  
  Page 24 of 40 "unanticipated" when it was unforeseeable at the time of its occurrence. A problem or 
event is "unanticipated" when it occurs at an increased frequency or at an increased severity than expected, AND  
• Related : A problem or event is "related" if it is possibly related to the research procedures.  
Adverse Event  
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject administered a medicinal (investigational or non- investigational) product. An adverse event does not necessarily 
have a caus al relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non - investigational) product, whether or not related 
to that medicinal (investigational or non -investigational) product. (Definition per International 
Conference on Harmonisation [ICH])  This includes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or frequency from t he 
baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory test abnormalities.  
 Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event based on ICH and EU Guidelines on Pharmacovigilance for Medicinal Products for Human Use is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening 
(The subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal 
product 
• Is medically important*  
 and/or per protocol may be problems/events that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_37021]-investigator may have adversely affected the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects or others, or substantially compromised the research data.  
 *Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is also appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31348]. These should usually be considered serious.  NOTE: DEATH FOR ANY REASON SHOULD BE REPORTED AS A SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT.

administration of study treatment.   
 Preexisting Condition A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period.  General Physical Examination Findings At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At the end of the study, any new clini cally significant findings/abnormalities that 
meet the definition of an adverse event must also be recorded and documented as an adverse event.   
 Post-study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_456]- investigator until th e events are 
resolved, the subject is lost to follow-up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the sponsor-investigator should instruct each subject to report, to the sponsor-investigator, any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.   Abnormal Laboratory Values A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if :  
- Monthly CBC shows that Hgb is < 8.0 g/dL  
- Monthly CBC shows that WBC is < 3.0  
- Monthly CBC shows ANC < 500 
- Monthly CBC shows that platelet count is < [ADDRESS_90974] be reported as a serious adverse event, except hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23741]:

[CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all adverse events should be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event section  of the case report form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal 
diagnostic, laboratory or procedure results should recorded in the source document.  All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recorded.  The clinical course of each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been ultimately determined that the study treatment or participation is not the  probable cause.  Serious adverse 
events that are still on going at the end of the study period must be followed up, to determine the 
final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to be at least possibly related to the study treatment or study participation should be recorded and reported immediately.

checks,  audit trails, controlled access, and undergoes frequent back-up.   
 
  Data Security and Confidentiality  
All clinical data will be processed in a secure electronic environment that includes virus protection, and restricted access. Electronically stored data are subject to extensive security measures including virus detection, and restricted access.  Security measures in place for the database management sy stem proposed for this study include: browser security, firewall 
protection, user name/password protection, user re- authentication, and inactivity time -out. 
   Data Quality Assurance Quality control will take place at time of data entry (range, consistency checks) and will be 
ensured by [CONTACT_83416] P.I. Before the enrollment of any subject in this study, designated study personnel will review with the investigator and personnel the following documents: protocol, Investigator’s Brochure, eCRF s and procedures for their completion, informed consent 
process, and the procedure for reporting SAEs.  Information recorded on the eCRFs will be verified against source documents and requests for clarification or correction may be made. After the eCRF data is entered, safety information will be reviewed for completeness, accuracy, and logical consistency. Computer programs that identify data inconsistencies may be used to help monitor the clinical study. If necessary, requests for clarification or correction will be sent to investigators.  By [CONTACT_12142], the Mayo Clinic agrees to be responsible for implementing and maintaining quality control and quality assurance systems with written standard operating procedures to ensure that studies are conducted and data are generated, documented, and reported in compliance with the protocol and accepted standards of Good Clinical Practice.    Data Clarification Process 
Data queries generated by [CONTACT_83417] [INVESTIGATOR_2993] a timely manner. Corrections or changes in the data management system are tracked with the retention of the original data and the corrected data with the date of data entry and submitting personnel.

10 Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting  
10.1 Study Monitoring Plan 
 The investigator will allocate adequate time for such monitoring activities.  The Investigator will also ensure that the monitor or other compliance or quality assurance reviewer is given access to all the study -related documents an d study related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, 
etc.), and has adequate space to conduct the monitoring visit.  Data and safety monitoring provides a clinical investigation with a system for appropriate oversight and attention to the protection of human subjects by [CONTACT_093], research team, or an independent reviewer. A Data and Safety Monitoring Plan is a quality assurance plan for a research study.  A written Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) prospectively identifies and documents monitoring activities intended to protect the safety of the subjects, the validity of the data and the integrity of the research study. The DSMP may also identify when to terminate a subject’s participation (i.e. individual stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]) and/or the appropriate termination of a study (i.e. study stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]). 
10.2 Auditing and Inspecting  
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_1201], the 
sponsor, and government regulatory agencies, of a ll study related documents (e.g. source 
documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data etc.).  The investigator 
will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study- related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, 
diagnostic laboratory, etc.).  Particip ation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by 
[CONTACT_5152].

PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
Study Number:  
EB001- SR201 
Study Title:  
A Phase [ADDRESS_575938]:  
EB-001 (Botulinum Neur otoxin Serotype E, BoNT/E) for i njection  
Study Objectives:  
Safety Objective : To determine the safety and tolerability of single treatment of EB -001 when 
injected into forehead muscles underlying a surgical wound during Mohs surgery.  
Efficacy Objective : To evaluate the efficacy of EB -001 intramuscular ( IM) injection into the 
forehead  muscles underlying the surgical wound in improving wound healing, and reducing 
scar formation.  
 
Phase of Trial:  
Phase 2  
Clinical Hypothesis:  
Safety : In patients undergoing Mohs surgery for skin lesions in the forehead area, a single 
treatment with EB-001 when injected into the muscles underlying the incision area will ha ve 
an acceptable safety and tolerability profile.  
Efficacy : In patients undergoing Mohs surgery for skin lesions in the forehead area, a single 
treatment with  EB-001 when injected into the muscles underlying the incision area will 
improve wound healing and reduce scar formation . 
Study Population:  
Healthy subjects  18 to 75 years of age , inclusive , undergoing dermatological surgical 
procedures to remove  single  skin lesions  in the forehead . 
Outcome Measures:  
Safety Measures:  
• Incidence and severity of treatment  emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious 
adverse events (SAEs)  
• Focused n eurologic examination  for potential spread of toxin  (SOT)  
• Incidence of abnormal findings in laboratory tests, electrocardiogram (ECG), physical 
exam, and vital signs (pulse rate, r espi[INVESTIGATOR_114129])  
• Urine p regnancy test for women of childbearing potential

Efficacy Measures:  
• Scar assessment using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) 
  
  
  
 
 
Study Design:  
This will be a randomized, placebo -controlled, single  blind  (to subject and study site 
personnel ), parallel arm study with placebo or  active treatment with IM  injections . Subjects 
will be randomized to receive either a single dose (treatment) of EB -001 or placebo.   
The study will be conducted at one center that specializes in dermatological surgical 
procedures. The study will include a visit for the surgical procedure (Day 1). Follow up visits will be scheduled at Days 2, 8, 30, and 90 ( Table 1). The study will enroll approximately 12 
subjects, random ly assigned to EB -001 or placebo in a 2:1 ratio for a total of 8 subjects in the 
EB-001 arm, and 4 subjects in the placebo arm ( Figure 2 ). 
Investigational (Study) Sites:  
One dermatology site specialized in Mohs surgery . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Duration:  
The expected duration for each subject participation is approximately [ADDRESS_575939] visit.   
Inclusion Criteria:  
An individual must meet ALL the following criteria  to participate in this study :

a. a highly effective method of contraception with failures rates less than 1% per 
year such as implant, intrauterine device (IUD), or sterilization from the day of dosing for 3 months (subjects who underwent sterilization must have initiated the procedure at least 3  months prior to the day of dosing) or  
b. dual methods of contraception with overall failures rates less than 1% per year such as injectable, pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], patch, ring, and diaphragm from the day of dosing for  
3 months (subjects using oral contraception must  have initiated treatment at 
least 2  months prior to the day of dos ing) 
8. Willing and able to complete  and comply with procedures, protocol requirements and 
instructions, which includes completion  of all required visits  
9. Willing and able to sign and date  IRB-approved informed consent  
10. Able to speak, read, and understand the language of the informed consent form (ICF)  
and study questionnaires  
Exclusion Criteria:  
An individual who meets ANY of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in 
this study:  
1. Pregnant or breast feeding, or planning a pregnancy  
2. Body weight less than 50 kg (110 pounds)  
3. Reported use of any botulinum toxin of any serotype within last 6 months before study drug administration  
4. Anticipated use of any botulinum toxin of any serotype during the study  
5. Known hypersensitivity to any botulinum toxin serotype  
6. Known allergy or sensitivity to any of the components of the study treatments, or any materials used in the study procedures  
7. Aminoglycoside intake within 48 hours prior to or during surgery

Pre-Surgery  Assessments: 
Written informed consent form (ICF), demographics, inclusion/exclusion criteria, medical 
history, physical and focused neurological examination s, height/weight, prior and 
concomitant medications, triplicate ECG, clinical laboratory tests (serum chemistry, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], hematology), immunogenicity sample  collection , blood collection  for human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B and C, urine collection  for drugs of abuse,  and 
urine  pregnancy test  for premenopausal women .  
Safety Assessments:  
Adverse events, physical and focused neurologic examinations, prior and concomitant 
medications, triplicate ECG, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, medical history, and urine pregnancy test. 
Efficacy Assessments

General Statistical Considerations:  
Analysis will be performed when all patients have completed the Day 90 visit or exited early 
from the study. The statistical analysis plan detailing all analyses will be signed off before 
the primary database lock.  
For efficacy analysis, modified intent to treat (mITT) population including all randomized and treated patients with at least one post -injection efficacy assessment will be used. The 
safety anal ysis will be performed using safety population including all  randomized and 
treated patients. All analysis will be performed on “as treated” basis.  
For main safety analysis, incidence of all adverse events, TEAEs, and serious adverse events 
will be summari zed for each treatment group.  The efficacy variable s are scar assessment 
multiple scales . The data will be summarized by [CONTACT_451706] 95% confidence 
interval (based on t -test) for treatment group will also be presented.  
The planned sample size will be approximately 12  subjects ( 8 for EB -001 and 4  for placebo , 
Figure 2). For this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], no formal sample size computations were made.  
 
All statistical analysis will be descriptive summary statistics.

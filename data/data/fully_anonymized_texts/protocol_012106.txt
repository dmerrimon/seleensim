Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease experience a complex physiologic derangement 
marked by [CONTACT_840865].  
Ultimately, this leads to impaired ventilation and difficulti es with gas exchange, producing hypercapnia, and 
in some cases leading to hypoxia. While the chronic disease typi[INVESTIGATOR_840827], 
patients experience several intermittent rapid decompensations per year, in the form of acute exace rbations. 
The etiology of these acute exacerbations is multi -factorial, but they are often hallmarked by [CONTACT_840866], discomfort/shortness of breath, and the more severe exacerbations progress to hypercapnic 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_77180], hypoxia, a nd ultimately respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399].1  
 
Treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD is multimodal; these modalities often include bronchodilators, 
steroids, and antibiotics. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_840828] (AHRF) 
secondary to an Acute Exacerbation of Chron ic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (AECOPD) is most commonly 
provided through non -invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), or in some cases mechanical 
ventilation (MV). A recent Cochrane meta -analysis by [CONTACT_840867] 2017 compared the efficacy of NIP PV 
when applied in conjunction with usual care practices versus usual care without MV in adults with AHRF 
secondary to AECOPD.2 Data from 17 randomized controlled trials containing 1264 patients, this Cochrane 
meta -analysis demonstrated that NIPPV decreased the risk of mortality by 46% and decreased risk of 
requiring intubation by 65%, which resulted in an associated reduction in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_95156], reduced incidence of 
complications, and improvement in pH & PaO [ADDRESS_1168268] hoc  analysis showed a positive statistical 
result. The  authors concluded that NIPPV  is “beneficial as a first -line intervention in conjunction with usual 
care for reducing the likelihood of mortality and intubation in patients admitted with AHRF secondary to 
AECOPD,” and the benefits “appear similar for patients with mild acidosis  (pH 7.30 to 7.35) versus a more 
severe nature (pH < 7.30), and when NIV is applied within the intensive care unit (ICU) or ward setting. ” 
 
Ventilatory therapy  has historically been delivered  via various devices that provide positive pressure  (MV, 
NIPPV , and continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP] ).  The goal of using these devices is to have an effect 
on the volume component of the alveolar ventilation equation:  Alveolar ventilation = (Volume -Dead Space) 
X Respi[INVESTIGATOR_13581].   Flow-based therapy, particularly High -Velocity Nasal Insufflation [HVNI],  support s 
oxygenation and ventilation  by [CONTACT_840868].3,4 
Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that  NIPPV & HVNI  provide comparable therapeutic support.  5-[ADDRESS_1168269] purge  is important to alveolar gas exchange as the gas that is drawn to the 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_840829] . This 
mechanism operates  similarly to  that  of oxygen conservation masks (re-breathers).  These masks create an

demonstrated the noninferiority of HVNI to NIPPV in the treatment of undifferentiated respi[INVESTIGATOR_840830] . 5 The current study is an extension of the prior 
published studies’ outcomes. The goal of this randomized control trial is to evaluate , the  relative e fficac y of

Rev 1.2 – Updated Dec 23, [ADDRESS_1168272] COPD with moderate -to-severe  
hypercapnic respi[INVESTIGATOR_840831] .  
 
The hypothesis : HVNI is comparable to NIPPV in the stabilization and relief of moderate -to-severe 
hypercapnic respi[INVESTIGATOR_840832], by [CONTACT_840870]’s dyspnea (breathlessness) 
within 4 hours to a comparable degree to NIPPV.  
Ho: µ T <= µ C – 1 
Ha: µ T > µ C – 1, 
where µ T and µ C are the improvement in modified BORG at 4 hours for treatment (Vapotherm) and 
control (NIPPV), respectively , and the non -inferiority margin is 1.  
 
To test this hypothesis , the study will be conducted with the following specific aims:  
 
Aim #1: Primary Outcome.  The primary endpoint is to evaluate the patient’s relief of dyspnea, as measured 
by [CONTACT_840871], rated perceived dyspnea [RPD 0 -10], during the [ADDRESS_1168273] -therapy initiation  
interval.  These measurements will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_840833] – baseline, 30min, 1h, and 
4h. 
 
Aim #2: Secondary Outcomes.  The secondary endpoints evaluate treatment failure (need for intubation), 
indices of Work of Breathing (patient vitals [HR, RR, SpO 2]), patient’s clinical stability during hypercapnic 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506], as measured by [CONTACT_840872] [Patient Stability Index: 0 -
10], venous blood gases (pH, PCO 2, PO 2, bicarbonate, base excess), basic metabolic panel* (lactate, Na+, K+, Cl-, 
glucose ), and patient disposition (length of stay [LOS]). These measurements will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_840834] – baseline*, 30min, 1h, and 4h.  The Patient Stability Index is described in the protocol.  
 
*Basic metabolic panel (BMP) will be collected at baseline only.  
Aim #3: Tertiary Outcomes.  The tertiary endpoints evaluate patient and clinician assessment of therapy . 
For the patient perception/satisfaction these include: (1) relief of symptoms, and (2) comfort/tolerance. For 
the clinician perceptions these include: (1) expected/perceived patient outcomes, (2) patient comfort & 
tolerance, and (3) ease of use.  
 
These endpoints  will establish comparability of HVNI to NIPPV in Acute Hypercapnic Respi[INVESTIGATOR_68661].

This will be performed as a prospective, unblinded (by [CONTACT_108]), multicenter, 1:1 randomized non -
inferiority design clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy  of HVNI compared to NIPPV (two approved 
interventions for the management of acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506]) in the clinical stabilization and relief of 
moderate -to-severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_840839]. Patients deemed 
to fit  the criteria for inclusion will perform the study procedures for one of the study arms of the  randomized 
study design. Patient completion of either of the study arms will provide an evaluation of the efficacy of HVNI 
or NIPPV in stabilization and relief of respi[INVESTIGATOR_840840]/WOB indices, 
treatment failure, dis position, and physiologic parameters during a 4 -hour therapy -response window. 
Additionally, tertiary outcomes will provide an evaluation of patient comfort, and therapeutic response, per 
the study aims.  Patients are expected to complete the study in one s ession, per the noted parameter 
sampling intervals (baseline, 30min, 1hr, 4hr). After the patient completes the randomized study arm (HVNI 
or NIPPV) , the clinicians and patients will complete perception score assessments.  The clinical management 
will otherwise remain unchanged, based on individual study site standard of care and practice.  
 
This study will utilize  two arms.  Patients presenting with acute hypercapnic respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]  (per 
Inclusion criteria, in need of clinical stabilization and relief of moderate -to-severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506]  ) who 
are escalated to treatment with a non -invasive respi[INVESTIGATOR_840841] : 
• Vapotherm high flow nasal cannula therapy (H VNI) administered as defined below ( HVNI  arm)  
• Non -invasive positive pressure ventilation ( NIPPV ) delivered via single -limb circuit  with a full face 
mask using a pressure suppo rt mechanical ventilator  system (e.g., Respi[INVESTIGATOR_840842], V60) 
administered as defined below ( NIPPV  arm)  
 
The study design will focus on six distinct phases  for each study arm , which will be identical except for the 
therapy randomization (HVNI or NIPPV): (1) Study Start, (2) Baseline Characterization, (3) Therapy 
Evaluation Interval 1, (4) Therapy Evaluation Interval 2, (5) Therapy Evaluation Interval 3, and (6) Study 
End. Primary , secondary , and tertiary  outcomes will be completed upon the completion of  all study phases.  
 
The Study Start Phase will follow screening and consent, and will confirm  randomization to either study arm, 
and gather the patient background, history,  health, demographics,  and current respi[INVESTIGATOR_294456] . For 
Phase 2, Baseline Characterization will provide the  initial clinical evaluatio n along with the baseline 
physiologic parameters, ventilation parameters, Patient Stability Index, and blood gases. For Phase 3, the 
Therapy Interval [ADDRESS_1168275] randomized  therapy interval 
and will include this interval’s physiologic parameters, ventilation parameters, Patient Stability Index, and 
venous blood gases. For Phase 4, the Therapy Interval [ADDRESS_1168276] 
randomized therapy  interval and will include this interval’s physiologic parameters, ventilation parameters, 
Patient Stability Index, and venous blood gases. For Phase 5, the Therapy Interval [ADDRESS_1168277] randomized therapy interv al and will include this interval’s physiologic 
parameters, ventilation parameters, Patient Stability Index, and venous blood gases. Following the 3rd 
Therapy Evaluation Interval at 4hours, Phase 6 will be implemented, which concludes with Study End. Phase 
6 will include Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for both patient and clinician assessment scores . The clinician and 
the patient will complete VAS perception scores for their randomized study arm (HVNI or NIPPV) at 
designated intervals.

of 1.0.   
 
Allowing for up to 20% attrition, approximately 80 subjects (40 per arm) will be enrolled in order to achieve 
64 subjects with an endpoint.  
 
From Doshi et al , comparable moderate -to-severe hypercapnic respi[INVESTIGATOR_840844] d ata was 
analyzed, which informed  this sample size calculation’s  assumed difference and standard deviations in

NOTE:   As this is an Emergency Department or inpatient acute care study, and treatment is often 
immediate due to need for maintaining patient safety, there is an expected patient dropout (i.e. 
incomplete or unusable subject number) of randomized & enrolled patients into this study. After 
presenting to the ED  or inpatient acute care setting , should the patients be transferred to another 
area of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], the study procedures will continue until complete.

This head -to-head non -inferiority randomized control trial is non -blinded by [CONTACT_100827], as the devices are 
different in size, apparatus, and appearance, when viewed by [CONTACT_387291]. Patients may 
prefer HVNI over NIPPV or NIPPV over HVNI; ho wever, this will not play a role in patient randomization. The 
study is a 1:1 randomized control design trial that will measure & compare the physiologic effect of the 
tested devices, specifically the effect on relieving patient dyspnea, and the stabilizat ion and improvement of 
patient pH and PCO 2 (venous blood gas). In addition, patient physiologic outcomes (e.g. HR, RR, BP, SpO 2), 
patient disposition (LOS), patient venous blood gases (pH, PCO 2, PO 2, bicarbonate, base excess  ,) and patient 
& clinician assessment scores will be assessed and documented. Figure 1 illustrates a flowchart of overall 
study procedures. Except for the randomized study arm (HVNI or NIPPV device), the study procedures are 
identical.  
 
Screening, Enrollment, & Management  
Upon screening  and fitting subject selection criteria, known at time of presentation to the ED or Acute Care 
unit for treatment , subjects may or may not  be able to be asked to be randomized and enrolled  into this 
study . In ED or Acute Care settings, there is a need to treat immediately to maintain patient safety. As such, 
consent in this study will take place through verbal consent prior to participation/randomization followed 
by [CONTACT_530933] (when respi[INVESTIGATOR_840835]), or written consent prior to 
participation/randomization. Patients will be reassured that their medical care will not be impacted in any 
way and their medical providers will not change. All patients randomized, but not included in the fi nal study 
population, will be accounted for in a CONSORT diagram, noting the dropout criteria (i.e. refused consent, 
met exclusion criteria, incomplete dataset, etc.). All study procedures will be explained to the subject.    
 
Subjects will be managed by [CONTACT_840877] (Table 
1).  All decision making for patient participation will be made per standard practice /care  at the  trial  site, 
relying on  the judgment of qualified medical professionals on staff .

Phase 1 – Study Start/Setup & Patient Background  
Upon enrollment  and randomization , the Study Start Phase will confirm  inclusion criteria, record 
randomization to either study arm (HVNI or NIPPV), and will collect/record appropriate patient background, 
history,  health, demographics,  anthropometrics, and  current respi[INVESTIGATOR_840845] .  
 
Appropriate Patient Background  data will be collected (see below under Data Collection), including patient 
demographics  (e.g. age, gender, ethnicity, race) , anthropometrics  (e.g. weight, height, BMI), COVID -19 status,  
and applicable medical history including a detailed focus on the patient’s current respi[INVESTIGATOR_82219] (LTOT 
user, positive -airway pressure therapy user, current respi[INVESTIGATOR_135733]). Patient medication data will be 
recorded and tracked for this study. Patient data necessary for calculating the  severity index score of BAP -65 
will be recorded at this time.  
 
Phase 2 – Baseline Characterization  
The baseline characterization will provide the  initial clinical evaluatio n. Upon enrollment, randomization, 
and patient background collection, an venous blood gas sample will be drawn to establish the patient 
baseline at the time just prior to placing the patient on either of the study arm therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (HVNI or NIPPV). 
Patient bas eline for physiologic parameters (RR, HR, SpO2, BP, RPD) and venous blood gas parameters 
(PCO 2, PO 2, pH, bicarbonate, base excess,) will be collected at this time, prior to the initiation of the 
assigned/randomized therapy. A basic metabolic panel (BUN, CO 2, Creatinine, Glucose, Chloride, Potassium, 
Sodium, Calcium)  will also be collected at this time. For the RPD, the clinician will record patient scores . 
Patient Stability Index evaluation will be evaluated by [CONTACT_840878], described as 
follows: to assess patient clinical stability using a continuous VAS score on a scale from unable to speak, due 
to severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506], up to  speaks in full sentences without severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506].  
 
At baseline, only patient perception scores will take place. During the noted study phases, the clinician and 
the patient will complete VAS perception scores (annotated on 100mm line with an “X”) for their 
randomized study arm (HVNI or NIPPV). Patient & Clinician Perception Assessment will be performed by [CONTACT_840879][INVESTIGATOR_840846]. The Perception Assessments will 
be completed for each of the three  endpoints for clinician assessment and the two endpoints  for the patient 
assessment.  For the patient perception/satisfaction these include: (1) relief of symptoms, and (2) 
comfort/tolerance . For the clinician perceptions these include: (1) expected/perceived patient outcomes, (2) 
patient comfort & tolerance, and (3) ease of use.   
 
The assigned therapy  per randomization  will be implemented  per the initial settings identified below, after 
which settings will be titrated per standard practice for o ptimal effect. Patients will  be managed by [CONTACT_840880] 1.  Note: All decision making for 
intubation, treatment regimen,  discharge, and disposition will be made per standard practice at each center 
using the judgment of the PI, Sub -I or their designee .   
 
Initial Settings for Comparative Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] – HVNI and NIPPV  
The initial settings in the two arms are designed as a standardization of usual medical treatment for the 
respective  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_840847].  Once the patient has been placed upon the initial settings, the medical staff 
may, and should, manipulate and titrate the settings to optimize effect iveness  and subject’s tolerance . Overall

stabilizing and reliving moderate -to-severe hypercapnic respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506] .  
 
HVNI  will be initiated  per the settings identified here , after which settings will be titrated per 
standard practice for optimal effect.  Patients will be fit ted with a Vapotherm nasal cannula that will 
be applied by a respi[INVESTIGATOR_840848] (not to exceed 
50% occlusion of the nares) . When appropriate cannula  are placed, the HVNI initial settings will be 
the following:  FiO 2 = 0.50  (unless the patient is receiving supplemental O 2, and then FiO [ADDRESS_1168283] 
amo unt of O 2 patient is receiving provided that the SpO 2 monitor reflects sufficient oxygenation), 
Flow = 30 L/min, and Temperature = 37°C. The flowrate can be decreased/increased as rapi[INVESTIGATOR_840849] , after a 5min acclimatization . Starting 
temperature will be 37°C; if patients find the gas temperature to be uncomfortable (warm), it can be 
lowered as necessary down to 33°C to enhance tolerance. The FiO 2 will be set initially to approximate 
the likely previous dosage (if any) to initially to assure adequate oxygenation, but this should be 
adjusted (range 0.21 to 1.0) to maintain an SpO 2 88-94%, per normal clinical management. If 
possible, FiO 2 should be weaned to 0.30 or lower  while maintaining SpO 2 88-94%. NOTE: The flow 
rate is expected to be increased to the maximum rate of 40 L/min before a patient is removed from 
HVNI therapy.   
 
NIPPV  will be initiated  per the initial settings identified here , after which settings will be titrated per 
standard practice for optimal effect. When patients are placed, the NIPPV initial settings will be the 
following: 12 cmH 2O / 6 cmH 2O (IPAP/EPAP), such that IPAP is 6 cmH 2O above EPAP, with Backup 
Ventilation Rate = 0 -4 breathes/min (lowest), and applied at the site’s standard of care (SOC) for 
humidification (settings to be recorded). Patients will be fit with an oronasal mask using a fitting 
gauge th at will be applied by a respi[INVESTIGATOR_840850] . Initial pressures will be at low end of suggested range  but can be increased as rapi[INVESTIGATOR_840851]. Targeted  tidal volumes of 6 -8 ml/kg ideal body weight  
will be the volume goal . If patients find pressures uncomfortably high /low , they can be adjusted  as 
necessary by 1 to 2 cmH 2O decrements to enhance tolerance. EPAP (PEEP) can also be adjusted 
upward as needed to reduce triggering effort (by [CONTACT_840881] -PEEP) or to improve 
oxygenation.  FiO2 will be 0.50  initially to assure adequate oxygenation  (unless the patient is 
receiving supplemental O 2, and then FiO [ADDRESS_1168284] amount of O 2 patient is receiving provided that 
the SpO 2 monitor reflects sufficient oxygenation) , but should be adjusted promptly to maintain an 
SpO 2 88-94%, per normal clinical management . If possible,  FiO 2 should be weaned to 0.30 or lower 
while maintaining SpO 2 88-94%.  
 
Treatment failure will be defined as:  
1. Failure to tolerate  device  if the patient is unable to tolerate the mask, nasal prongs, air flow or 
pressure, has persisting asynchrony and is unable to cooperate with the therapy . 
2. Failure to oxygenate  if the modality is unable to sustain an SpO2 sat > 88 - 92% or PaO 2 > 60 – 65

other conditions interpreted by [CONTACT_102]’s clinicians as constituting evidence of deterioration.  
 
Intubation Criteria  will be at the discretion of the treating physician . Researchers will not interfere with 
clinical management decision. Researchers will attempt to ascertain the physician’s rationale for intubation 
and categorize as one of the following: (may include multiple reasons, or other) : 
1. Intubation will be undertaken for unremitting respi[INVESTIGATOR_840854]/or crossover therapy as manifested by [CONTACT_840882] > 88% despi[INVESTIGATOR_840855] 2 1.0 and 
optimization of flow and/or PEEP settings . 
2. Progressive increase > 10 mmHg in PCO 2 and concomitant drop in pH despi[INVESTIGATOR_840856] . 
3. Inability to cooperate with therapy in the face of persisting evidence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] .  
4. Unremitting agitation interfering with ability to cooperate and with persisting evidence of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] . 
5. Deteriorating mental status despi[INVESTIGATOR_840857] H VNI and/or NIPPV.  
6. Worsening hemodynamic status (systemic SBP <90 mmHg or MAP < 60 mmHg despi[INVESTIGATOR_840858]), unremitting life -threatening arrhythmias, cardiac or 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_840859], in the judgment of the clin ical care team, warrants 
intubation.  
 
 
Phase 3 – Therapy Evaluation Interval #1  
The Therapy Evaluation Interval 1 at 30 -minutes will be used to perform a VBG draw for all patients to 
determine if patients need emergent intubation or if Flow/FiO 2 or IPAP/EPAP/FiO [ADDRESS_1168286] -initiation of randomized therapy (HVNI or NIPPV), the patient will be evaluated. 
Patient Stability Index evaluation will be evaluated by [CONTACT_840878] . At [ADDRESS_1168287] initiation of randomized therapy, a venous blood gas sample will be drawn to establish the patient 
status. Patient status for physiologic parameters (RR, HR, SpO 2, BP, RPD) and venous blood gas parameters 
(PO 2, PCO 2, pH, bicarbonate, base excess ) will also be collected at this time.  For the RP D, the clinician will 
record patient scores . For VAS, at this time, only patient assessment scores will take place.  
 
Any changes in the assigned therapy settings will be recorded at this interval. Record any relevant treatment 
intolerance and failure, need for endotracheal intubation, time spent under positive -pressure ventilation  , 
patient mortality, elevation of patient status, and transfer to other inpatient ward/units. Should the patient 
be placed on intubation prior to this therapy evaluation interval, the physiologic parameters and venous 
blood gas parameters will be subsequent ly collected at intubation time. Should the patient be designated by 
[CONTACT_840883], the physiologic 
parameters, venous blood gas parameters, and final assessment scores (per Phase 6)  will be subsequently 
collected at this time.  
 
Phase 4 – Therapy Evaluation Interval #[ADDRESS_1168288] -initiation of randomized therapy (HVNI or NIPPV), the patient will be evaluated. Patient

VIII. Statistical Analysis  
The data analysis will be “per protocol,” and per the “intention -to-treat” model. Baseline patient 
demographics and characteristics will be summarized, compared, and appropriate statistical testing will be 
performed for the continuous and categorical varia bles. Primary outcomes will be analyzed for statistical 
significance to test the null hypothesis. Assuming a non -normal data distribution for this randomized study 
design, the non -parametric Wilcoxon Signed Rank Sum test will be performed with significance  interval of 
0.05 on all applicable variables. Parametric analytical analogues (e.g. t -test) will be used if the measurements 
present a normal distribution. Otherwise, for the categorical variables, the Fisher’s Exact test will be 
performed and shown by [CONTACT_840886]. Data for patient parameters will be compared across treatment arms and 
time -period using Repeated Measures analysis ANOVAs to assess dependence on treatment and interactions 
with time. Data will be compared and graphed accordingly for a visual comp arison with accompanied 
statistical notations. Significance will be accepted where p < 0.05. Analyses will be performed using SAS 
version 9.[ADDRESS_1168294]/routine practice in the 
study hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] . 3,4,17,[ADDRESS_1168295] NIPPV v HVNI

XI. Monitoring and Quality Assurance  
The clinical trial site will be monitored in accordance with policies at Vapotherm and federal regulations that 
pertain to clinical research, namely 21 CFR Parts 50, 54, 56 and 812 and others as applicable.  Monitoring 
will occur at regular frequency by [CONTACT_3433] e PI [INVESTIGATOR_1461] , such as to allow ongoing review of data collected, site 
qualifications and compliance with the protocol.  All investigators will be appropriately trained to ensure 
compliance with the protocol.  Audit of the study CRF’s will be regularly c onducted by [CONTACT_1034]. The 
clinical trial site will follow all IRB regulations.  
 
XII. Protocol Deviations  
Any deviations from the Data Collection plan identified during monitoring or through other means will be 
documented on case report forms. These include, but are not limited to items such as the following:  
• Deviation from the procedural sequencing , per the protocol  
• Failure to comp lete the Baseline characterization  
• Failure to complete all sections of the Study Phases  
• Failure to capture time and place  in trial  of any device failure  
• Failure to capture/record data included in the protocol  
• Subject inability to complete either of the randomized  study arms  
If the study site demonstrates a pattern of consistent and frequent deviations, the sponsor will undertake 
appropriate activities (e.g. re -training) to attempt to bring the site into compliance with the protocol. A 
pattern of repeated serious deviations from the protocol may result in site termination from the study.  
 
XIII. Adverse Event Reporting  
During the course of the subject’s participation in the study, the investigator will determine whether any 
adverse events have occurred.  For the purposes of this protocol, an adverse event is any undesirable event  
experienced by  a subject , that is or is not attributed to the device or procedure required by [CONTACT_3181].  If

XIV. Confidentiality  
Rigorous procedures will be followed to maintain confidentiality of subject identification and test -related 
information and to adhere to government regulations concerning privacy.  Methods to protect the privacy of 
subjects and clinical information are employed and built into the trial .  A unique identification number 
designed to protect the identity of subjects will be used to identify the subject on case report forms, 
recruitment logs, data forms or other reports.  
 
This unique identification number will not be linked to identifiable data; no personal or identifiable patient 
data will be collected.  The Vapotherm clinical research staff member managing the study will be the only 
person to have knowledge pertaining to the link between the unique identifiable number and the subject.  All 
other Vapotherm representatives involved in this study will only have access to the patients’ unique

Basic investigations suggest that CRF and nociceptin facilitate andinhibit anxiety-like behaviors, respectively. Convergent with this is data from animal models ofalcoholism that support increased CRF and decreased nociceptin levels in the extendedamygdala as the reason for anxiety-like behaviors that underlie relapse in addiction. Thispostulation is further supported by [CONTACT_894095]1 receptor antagonists and NOP receptoragonists to blunt the reinforcing and motivational effects of alcohol on a range of addictivebehaviors. Thus, it is of considerable interest to develop a methodology to examine CRF-NOPi[INVESTIGATOR_894050]. Here, we will evaluate healthy humans with [C-11]NOP-1A andPET to determine if hydrocortisone-induced increases in amygdala CRF leads to altered NOPreceptor binding. This experiment will for the ﬁrst time document an in vivo interaction betweenCRF and NOP, and set the stage for evaluating if this interaction is abnormal in addiction infuture investigations.

In rodents, an injection of CRF into the lateral cerebroventricle results in increased NOP receptorexpression (Rodi et al., 2008). We will test the existence of such an interaction in 20 healthyhuman subjects by [CONTACT_35755] [C-11]NOP-1A VT under control conditions and following theadministration of intravenous cortisol (hydrocortisone, 1 mg/kg). Note: Intravenous CRH is notused as a challenge, because it is not transported from the blood to the brain (Martins et al.,1996). Intravenous hydrocortisone (1mg/kg) will be used as the challenge, because in vivomicrodialysis studies in sheep have demonstrated that it can cross the blood-brain barrier andincrease CRF levels in the amygdala by ~ 200% (Cook, 2002; Schwartz et al., 1972).Hydrocortisone increases amygdala CRF levels via its action on type 2 glucocorticoid receptors(Cook, 2002). The hypothesis is that hydrocortisone-induced increases in amygdala CRF will result in higher [C-11]NOP-1A VT. This would suggest that transmission at NOP receptors is increased tocounteract hydrocortisone’s activation of CRF and the brain stress system. If successful, futurestudies will be proposed with this hydrocortisone- [C-11]NOP-1A PET imaging paradigm toexamine CRF-NOP interactions in addictive disorders.  1.31.3Background: Brieﬂy describe previous ﬁndings or observations that provide theBackground: Brieﬂy describe previous ﬁndings or observations that provide thebackground leading to this proposal.background leading to this proposal. A1. Nociceptin: a functional CRF antagonistThe endogenous neuropeptide, nociceptin, and its target NOP receptor are structurally similarto dynorphin A and its target kappa opi[INVESTIGATOR_8328] (Meunier et al., 1995; Reinscheid et al.,1995). However, nociceptin has no afﬁnity for the classical mu, kappa and delta opi[INVESTIGATOR_894063], and endogenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], such as endorphins, enkephalins, dynorphin, etc., do notbind to the NOP receptor. Nociceptin and neuropeptide Y are postulated to be components ofan anti-stress system in the brain that counteracts stress and anxiety, which is typi[INVESTIGATOR_894064], norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238], orexin, vasopressin and dynorphin (Koob, 2008). Consistentwith this notion, nociceptin has been shown to block stress-induced analgesia, anorexia, andanxious behaviors in rodents (Ciccocioppo et al., 2002; Jenck et al., 1997; Mogil et al., 1996).Also, nociceptin knockout mice show increased anxiety-like behaviors and are unable to adaptto repeated stress, compared to wild-type mice (Koster et al., 1999). Nociceptin also has no appreciable afﬁnity for CRF receptors. However, nociceptin has beenshown to oppose the functions of extra-hypothalamic CRF and, thus, exert an anti-stress effect(Ciccocioppo et al., 2004a). Studies have convincingly demonstrated that the administration ofnociceptin in the extended amygdala inhibits CRF -induced anorexia and anxiety-like symptomsin rodents (Ciccocioppo et al., 2002; Ciccocioppo et al., 2004a; Ciccocioppo et al., 2003;Ciccocioppo et al., 2001; Rodi et al., 2008). Furthermore, studies that have evaluated restraint-

Page 12 of 58https://www.osiris.pi[INVESTIGATOR_32887].edu/osiris/CustomLayouts/SmartFormPrint/Pri…ction=true&PrintHeaderView=true&PrintHeaderInfo=true&PrintLogo=truestress in rodents show an ~ 70% increase in NOP receptor protein expression in the extendedamygdala to counteract increases in CRF (Ciccocioppo et al., 2014a). This increase in NOPreceptor expression is detectable in animals ~ 6 hours following exposure to restraint stress.However, this increase in NOP receptors is not detectable 20 minutes following restraint stress(personal communication with [CONTACT_894144]), and is not accompanied by [CONTACT_894105] (Ciccocioppo et al., 2014a). This suggests that the restraint-stressinduced increase in amygdala NOP receptors is not due to endogenous competition between theligand and the receptor site, but rather indicative of new receptor synthesis or recycling ofinternalized receptors to the cell membrane. Increased NOP receptor expression is likely anadaptive response to stress. Consistent with this nociceptin has been shown to block CRF-induced increases in GABAA mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) more strongly inrestraint stress animals with increased NOP receptors compared to control animals (Ciccocioppoet al., 2014a). In a more direct documentation of CRF-NOP interactions, an injection of CRF intothe lateral cerebroventricle led to a 2-fold increase in NOP receptor expression in the bednucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) after six hours (Rodi et al., 2008). Again, consistent withthe notion that increased NOP receptor expression is an adaptive response to increasedCRF/stress, an injection of nociceptin into the BNST (or lateral cerebroventricle) blocked CRF-induced anxiety-like behaviors (Rodi et al., 2008). Based on these data, it is tempting tospeculate that abnormal CRF-NOP interactions underlie the anxiety-like symptoms in severalpsychiatric and addictive disorders. For example, it is possible that the inability to effectivelyupregulate NOP receptors to counteract increased CRF in stress-related conditions might bepredictive of risk and relapse in alcoholism. It may also be predictive of risk for anxiety disorderssuch as post-traumatic stress disorder –another disorder in which both the CRF and NOPreceptors have been implicated (Zhang et al., 2012). Finally, there are other non-CRF mediatedmechanisms that contribute to the anti-stress effects of nociceptin as well. They include itsability to modulate the release of multiple neurotransmitters including dopamine, serotonin,acetylcholine, glutamate and GABA via stimulation of NOP receptors that are located pre-synaptically on the axon terminals of these neurons (Schlicker and Morari, 2000). These non-CRF mechanisms will not be the focus of this application.A2. CRF-NOP interactions: relevance in addictionThe three phases of addiction are intoxication, withdrawal and craving. In contrast to dopaminerelease that drives positive reinforcement in the intoxication phase, an imbalance between thebrain stress (CRF, orexin, vasopressin and dynorphin) and anti-stress systems (neuropeptide Yand nociceptin) has been postulated to drive negative reinforcement in the withdrawal andcraving phases (Koob, 2008). Studies by [CONTACT_894106]-stress systems work in series or in parallel in theextended amygdala to impact emotional states and contribute to relapse. Within the extendedamygdala, stress-mediators such as CRF increase GABAA inhibitory post-synaptic potentials(IPSCs), whereas anti-stress mediators such as nociceptin decrease GABAA IPSCs (Roberto andSiggins, 2006). Because most neurons in the extended amygdala are GABA-ergic inhibitoryinterneurons or projection neurons, the GABA-ergic tone in this region regulates the ﬂow ofinformation through the intra-amygdala circuits. This in turn inﬂuences both local and outputneurons to downstream regions that mediate a behavioral response. To summarize, stimulationof CRF receptors: increases GABA transmission in the extended amygdala; promotes anxiety-likebehaviors; and increases alcohol consumption (Roberto et al., 2010). In contrast, stimulation ofNOP receptors: blocks CRF-induced increases in GABA transmission in the extended amygdala;diminishes anxiety; and prevents conditioned reinstatement in animals that self-administeralcohol (Ciccocioppo et al., 2014a; Ciccocioppo et al., 2004b; Cruz et al., 2012; Rodi et al.,2008). These basic studies have led investigators to postulate a therapeutic role for increasingtransmission at NOP receptors to counteract an overactive CRF system and, by [CONTACT_66250], blocknegative reinforcement and stress-induced relapse in alcoholism (Witkin et al., 2014).Furthermore, intracerebroventricular administration of nociceptin has also been shown to

Page 13 of 58https://www.osiris.pi[INVESTIGATOR_32887].edu/osiris/CustomLayouts/SmartFormPrint/Pri…ction=true&PrintHeaderView=true&PrintHeaderInfo=true&PrintLogo=trueattenuate positive reinforcement by [CONTACT_894107] a drug reward(cocaine and morphine). Microdialysis studies have demonstrated decreased cocaine- andmorphine- induced DA release in the nucleus accumbens following intra- ventral tegmental area(VTA) and intra-nucleus accumbens nociceptin administration (Di Giannuario and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_74737], 2000;Di Giannuario et al., 1999; Lutfy et al., 2001; Murphy et al., 1996; Vazquez-DeRose et al.,2013). It is likely that nociceptin directly modulates midbrain DA neurons to impact DA releasebecause 50-90% of tyrosine hydroxylase positive cells (TH +) in the VTA (and substantia nigra)express NOP receptors (Maidment et al., 2002; Norton et al., 2002). Alternatively, an effect forpre-synaptic NOP receptors on DA terminals cannot be ruled out because administration ofnociceptin into the nucleus accumbens reduces DA release as well (Vazquez-DeRose et al.,2013). The mechanisms by [CONTACT_894108].Increased transmission at NOP receptors not only blocks the rewarding properties of alcohol inthe conditioned place preference behavioral paradigm (Ciccocioppo et al., 1999; Kuzmin et al.,2009), but also reduces alcohol consumption (Ciccocioppo et al., 1999). It is also effective inpreventing the somatic and affective signs of alcohol withdrawal in alcohol-dependent rodentsduring both acute and protracted withdrawal (Economidou et al., 2011). Highly relevant to theclinic is its ability to block cue- and stress-induced alcohol reinstatement following prolongedabstinence in rodent models of alcoholism (Ciccocioppo et al., 2004b; Martin-Fardon et al.,2000). Most of the aforementioned studies were conducted in rodents that prefer andconsume large amounts of alcohol. These alcoholic animals demonstrate increased NOP receptorexpression (mRNA) and receptor density (Bmax) in the extended amygdala, ventral tegmentalarea (VTA), and cortex compared to controls (Economidou et al., 2008). Thus, it is tempting tospeculate that an increase in NOP receptors in alcohol-preferring rodents is a compensatoryadaptation to increased CRF and related stress in alcoholism. This is supported by [CONTACT_894109]-administration (Economidou et al., 2008; Gustafsson et al., 2005).The only human study to date that has evaluated NOP receptors in postmortem brains found a1.4-fold reduction in NOP receptor mRNA in the CeA in alcoholics compared to controls (Kuzminet al., 2009). No such differences were evidenced in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.These human data are in sharp contrast to the upregulation of NOP receptors reported inalcohol preferring rodents. The exact reasons for the discrepancy between rodent and humanresults with respect to NOP receptor gene expression are unclear. One possibility is thatdecreased NOP receptor expression may indicate a failure to adequately compensate forincreased CRF transmission in human alcoholics with more severe and chronic disease relative tothat in the alcohol-preferring rodents. This would indicate a more effective compensatoryupregulation of NOP receptors in response to increased CRF transmission in alcohol-preferringrodents. Finally, the importance of abnormalities in nociceptin and NOP receptors is furtherhighlighted by [CONTACT_894110] a link between alcoholism andpolymorphisms in the genes encoding for them (Huang et al., 2008; Xuei et al., 2008). A majorgap in the existing addiction literature is that no in vivo methodology exists to examine CRF-NOP interactions. Thus, the development of a methodology to examine CRF-NOP interactions invivo in the living human brain will have a major impact in understanding addictive disorders inwhich stress is linked to relapse. A3. Imaging of NOP receptors with [C-11]NOP-1A and PET In a major advancement, the imaging group at NIMH recently radiolabeled and successfullyvalidated a NOP receptor antagonist radiotracer [C-11] (S)-3-(2'-ﬂuoro-6',7'-dihydrospi[INVESTIGATOR_2152][pi[INVESTIGATOR_119510]-4,4'-thieno[3,2-c]pyran]-1-yl)-2-(2-ﬂuorobenzyl)-N-methylpropanamide(NOP-1A) for use in humans (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_110069]., 2011). [C-11]NOP-1A binds with relatively high afﬁnityto NOP receptors (KD, 0.15 nM). [C-11]NOP-1A total uptake in various brain regions (VT) isconsistent with the known distribution of NOP receptors in human and primate brain (relatively

[C-11]NOP-1Ademonstrates desirable pharmacokinetics in humans: brain uptake peaks relatively quickly (~ 10min) and washes out rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375]; brain data is modeled well by a 2-tissue compartment kineticanalysis; VT values in brain regions range from 7 to 15; VT remains stable following 70 min ofdata acquisition; and the test-retest variability for VT is an acceptable ≤ 15% in all brain regions(Lohith et al., 2014; Lohith et al., 2012).[C-11]NOP-1A has been administered to approximately [ADDRESS_1252674] been reported with its use. A4. Summary: A wealth of pre-clinical literature implicates the stress and anti-stressneuropeptides CRF and nociceptin in negative reinforcement and relapse in alcoholism. If theproposed experiments were successful in showing increased NOP receptor binding in responseto greater amygdala CRF levels induced by a hydrocortisone challenge, this would support theuse of this imaging paradigm to examine in vivo interactions between CRF and NOP in humans.Such results would have far reaching implications in efforts to characterize the brain stress andanti-stress systems in addiction (Koob, 2008)., and other psychiatric disorders (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder, major depression, etc.,). Characterizing CRF-NOP interactions inhumans with drug and alcohol use disorders is an important step in informing the ﬁeld of thetherapeutic potential for CRF antagonist and NOP agonist medications to treat addiction. Forexample, if we show that there is a smaller compensatory increase in NOP receptors in responseto CRF release in alcoholics compared to controls, this would support the clinical developmentof novel NOP agonist compounds (MT-7716 and Ro 64-6198) that have shown promise inrodent models of alcoholism (Ciccocioppo et al., 2014b; de Guglielmo et al., 2014; Kallupi [CONTACT_2297].,2014; Kuzmin et al., 2007).  1.41.4Signiﬁcance: Why is it important that this research be conducted?

However, its use in thisresearch study is considered to be generally safe and effective as determined by [CONTACT_894113][INVESTIGATOR_894069] (RDRC) in accordance with FDA regulations.[C-11]NOP-1A will be prepared according to the information and protocols described in therespective Drug Master File approved by [CONTACT_32928][INVESTIGATOR_894070]. The amount of radioactivity injected for [C-11]NOP-1A will be 12 mCi/scan basedon previously published reports (Lohith et al., 2012). A radioactive dose of approximately 12mCi will provide adequate signal to noise ratio to quantify NOP receptors (Lohith et al., 2012).[C-11]NOP-1A has been previously administered to humans and documented to have “nopharmacological effects” at the mass dose levels that will be administered (Note: the masslimits for this study will be the same as in RDRC approved Drug Master File for [C-11]NOP-1A).II).

The proposed dose of hydrocortisone (1mg/kg, IV, i.e., ≤ 100 mg) thatwill be used in this imaging study is far below the FDA approved maximum IV dose of 500 mg.In previously published research studies, IV hydrocortisone has been administered to healthyhumans at doses ≤ 200 mg with no serious side effects (Jung et al., 2014; Symonds et al.,2012; Wachtel et al., 2001; Wachtel and de Wit, 2001). Intravenous hydrocortisone 1 mg/Kgwill be formulated as listed in the FDA package and dispensed in a ﬁnal volume of 50mL normalsaline by [CONTACT_894114] (IDS). STUDY DAYS (EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES)No more than [ADDRESS_1252677] will receive a venous line for infusion of the radiopharmaceutical and an arterial linefor blood sampling.The entire PET/CT scanning session will require about [ADDRESS_1252678] as long as 10 hours (if the MR and PET are done in the same day). In the unlikely event that the experimental PET/CT procedures cannot be completed in a singleday (due to a non-functional MRI scanner, PET camera or cyclotron or any other unavoidablereason), the subject may be given the option to return within 30 days to complete the study.On this “completion” day, participant preparation again consists of intravenous and arterialcatheterization. The scanning protocol will continue from the point that the protocol wasaborted on the initial day. No subject will receive more than 2-[ADDRESS_1252679] scans, two [C-11]NOP-1A PET scans and one hydrocortisone challenge, regardless of whether the study iscompleted in one or two days. That is, the total radiation exposure over the two-PET scanningdays will not be signiﬁcantly greater than if the entire procedure had been completed in oneday, however the participant would receive an additional intravenous, arterial catheterization,low-dose CT scan and additional urine drug and pregnancy screens. All tests for this research study will be performed at either the MR Research Center (MRRC) onthe 8th ﬂoor of UPMC Presby[CONTACT_497529][INVESTIGATOR_307] (PUH) or the PET Facility on the 9th ﬂoorof UPMC PUH (directly above the MRRC).The goal of the study is to determine if [C-11]NOP-1A receptor binding (VT) can be altered by[CONTACT_894115] (cortisol) challenge through CRF-NOP interactions.

Each participant will receive both a baseline [C-11]NOP-1A PETscan and post-hydrocortisone [C-11]NOP-1A PET scan following hydrocortisone administrationin order to examine CRF-NOP receptor interactions.Subject Preparation:A). Baseline review of medical and medication history (to document no change from screening).B). A urine pregnancy test is done on females of child bearing potential (i.e., females who havenot undergone a surgical sterilization procedure or who are not at least one year post-menopausal) to conﬁrm that pregnancy has not occurred between the time of the screeningand the PET. In addition, a statement of use of a method of contraception for all subjects in thepast 15 days (abstinence, barrier methods, oral contraceptive medications, etc.) is obtained.C). A urine drug screen and alcohol breath analyzer to ensure the subject did not abuse anyillicit drugs or alcohol prior to the PET scan (this test will occur prior to the placement of thevenous and arterial catheters). Subjects will be informed that this test will occur. D). The preparation of the subject will include the placement of a venous line and an arterialline. An anesthesiologist will place the arterial line. The purpose of these lines is as follows:Arterial line (all subjects):1. Blood sampling for [C-11]NOP-1A arterial concentration.2. The arterial line will be placed after completion of the Allen test and inﬁltration of the skinwith 1 to 2% lidocaine.If the arterial line cannot be obtained for any reason, the PET study will NOT proceed as anarterial input function is necessary for the derivation of the primary outcome measure, totaldistribution volume (VT). Note: As the radiotracer [C-11]NOP-1A does not have a referenceregion (i.e., region devoid of NOP-1A speciﬁc binding), it is necessary to have the arterial inputfor appropriate quantitation of NOP-1A binding (Kimura et al., 2011).Venous line (all subjects):1. [C-11]NOP-1A (single bolus).E). Blood pressure, heart rate and temperature will be documented prior to the PET scan. F). Before the PET and CT scan procedures are initiated, a wrist band (Empatica, E4) will beplaced on the subject’s wrist that does not have the arterial line. This wrist band which lookssimilar to ‘apple watch’ will continuously monitor and record the subjects’ heart rate, inter-beatinterval, and electrodermal activity. Subjects will wear this wrist band till the completion of boththeir PET/CT scans.

A low-dose CT scan to correct the PET scan measurements for attenuation will beperformed in a few minutes.H). Following this CT scan, 12 mCi of [C-11]NOP-1A will be injected intravenously. Dynamic PETdata will be collected for 70 min. I). At the end of this scan, the subject will be a provided a brief (~5 to 10 min) break to relaxout of the scanner.J). Subjects will then be administered 1 mg/kg of intravenous hydrocortisone as a bolus over90 seconds. Following this, subjects will be monitored by [CONTACT_894116] (see monitoring listed below).K). A second low-dose CT scan and [C-11]NOP-1A scan will be acquired a minimum of 3.5-hourspost hydrocortisone, identical to the methods outlined previously. The timing of the second [C-11]NOP-1A administration and subsequent PET scanning (i.e., ~ 3.5 to 4.5 hours) is based onprevious basic science studies that have documented CRF-NOP interactions (Ciccocioppo et al.,2014a; Rodi et al., 2008). The proposed timing will also ensure that the maximum increase inamygdala cortisol and CRF (Tmax ~ 25 to 30 min) following intravenous hydrocortisone(1mg/kg) has occurred prior to the PET scan (Cook, 2002). Blood Sampling during [C-11]NOP-1A PET scans: Periodic arterial blood sampling will beperformed during the PET studies for the quantitative data analyses (i.e. measurement of theradiotracer and its metabolites in the blood). These blood draws will not exceed 130 ml (about9 tablespoonfuls) of blood in total. For each PET scans, hand-drawn arterial blood samples (0.5ml) will be collected throughout the scan with no more than [ADDRESS_1252680] 2 minand no more than 15 collected at intervals of increasing duration minutes (no more than 35total samples). Also, larger blood samples (3-5 ml) will be obtained at no more than 8 timesduring each PET scan for the determination of radiolabeled metabolites and protein binding. Thiswould amount to no more than 43 arterial samples and a blood volume loss of no more than 60ml (4-5 tablespoonfuls)/scan (60 * 2 scans = 120 mL). In addition to this two 3-[ADDRESS_1252681]-hydrocortisone scan (2* 5* 1 scan =10 mL). The timing of these cortisol blood samples will be t=[ADDRESS_1252682]-hydrocortisone L). Following this scan, all subjects will receive:1. Physical Exam.2. Mental Status Exam.3. EKG.4. Vital Signs measurement.M). The subject will be evaluated by a physician to ensure they meet the following dischargecriteria:1. a blood pressure of > 90/60 and < 150/90.2. a heart rate > 50 or < 110.3. no reported subjective or objective side effects from the hydrocortisone at discharge.4. a normal EKG (or not clinically signiﬁcant, or no change from baseline EKG as determined by [CONTACT_134985])5. a normal physical exam.6. a normal mental status exam.N).

If the participant voices any difﬁculty or desires to be removed fromthe scanner, or if the technician sees any indication that the participant is experiencingdiscomfort, the participant will be immediately removed from the scanner and verballyreassured.C). Subject monitoring on hydrocortisone 1. The hydrocortisone will be administered by a physician investigator familiar with the protocol.The physician investigator will also be available in the PET facility to monitor the subject onhydrocortisone.2. Blood pressure and heart rate will be recorded once prior to hydrocortisone and followinghydrocortisone every ten minutes for the ﬁrst 60 minutes, then every 15 minutes thereafter(up to at least 120 min).3. Subjects will be assessed once at baseline (time 0), once at [ADDRESS_1252683]-hydrocortisone(t=60 min), and once before the second [C-11]NOP scan with visual analog scales such as thePSS, HAM-A and CES D (scales attached in 2.8) to evaluate their subjective feelings while onhydrocortisone.

To that extent, the studies that are being proposed in this protocol will allow forthe computation of effect size and planning for an adequately powered future investigation. Inthe absence of these data, we used published data from basic investigations to makeassumptions for an effect size and power calculations.In the study by [CONTACT_894119]., infusion of 1µg CRF in rodents was associated with a 100% increasein NOP mRNA (Rodi et al., 2008). Based on prior microdialysis studies, we postulate a 2.2-foldincrease in amygdala CRF following the 1 mg/kg IV hydrocortisone challenge (Cook, 2002). Thisis physiologically meaningful because it is in line with increases in amygdala CRF (~1 to 4-foldincrease) that have been reported in animal models of addiction (Merlo Pi[INVESTIGATOR_806869]., 1995;Richter et al., 1995; Richter and Weiss, 1999; Richter et al., 2000). However, the exactmagnitude that this will translate to increased NOP receptor binding as measured by [C-11]NOP-1A is unknown. Assuming a relatively modest 10% increase in binding to NOP receptors(VT) in response to CRF released by [CONTACT_894120], and a 10 - 14% within-subject test-retest variability for [C-11]NOP-1A VT (Lohith et al., 2014), the study is poweredat 0.[ADDRESS_1252690] at the p < 0.[ADDRESS_1252691] with asample size of n = 16. It is possible that some subjects may not tolerate the hydrocortisoneinfusion to complete the PET scans. Thus, we request permission to study an additional 4subjects, for a total n=20. Note: If we observe an effect on [C-11]NOP-1A VT as reported inRodi et al. (100% increase in NOP mRNA), the study will be powered at 1.0.

Risk of HydrocortisoneThe proposed dose of hydrocortisone (1mg/kg, IV, i.e., ≤ 100 mg) in this study is far below theFDA approved maximum IV dose of 500 mg. This will reduce the risk of these serious adverseeffects. Furthermore, IV hydrocortisone has been administered to healthy humans at doses ≤200 mg with no serious side effects in several previous research studies (Jung et al., 2014;Symonds et al., 2012; Wachtel et al., 2001; Wachtel and de Wit, 2001). Speciﬁc measures and precautions to prevent medical and psychiatric effects:Subjects will be screened for absence of signiﬁcant past and current medical conditions with acomplete medical history, physical examination, routine blood tests (that will include CBC withdifferential counts, electrolytes, liver, thyroid, adrenal, kidney function tests, and creatinekinase) urine toxicology and EKG. They will be excluded if they have any history ofcardiovascular disease, arrhythmias, or an abnormal EKG. In addition, subjects with a prior orcurrent history of immune-compromise, HPA-axis dysfunction, Cushing’s syndrome, obesity,hyperglycemia, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], cataracts, glaucoma, and osteoporosis will be excluded. Finally,subjects with a family history for mood, anxiety and psychotic disorder will be excluded as well.

Administration ofhydrocortisone will take place in the presence of a physician. A twelve lead EKG, a code cart,and deﬁbrillator are available in the room in case of complications. If there is a drop in bloodpressure, IV ﬂuids will be used to control the blood pressure response. In case of chest pain,chest tightness or other symptoms suggestive of cardiac ischemia, the experiment will becanceled and a twelve lead EKG will be immediately obtained to rule out angina (ST segmentelevation or depression as compared to the baseline EKG) or arrhythmia. If serious medical signsand symptoms persist > [ADDRESS_1252696] > 10 minutes (example,depression, anxiety, etc.), the subjects will be managed by [CONTACT_978] (starting with re-assurance,and if need oral lorazepam 1-2 may be administered). If these symptoms persist and are acause for a concern then a referral will be made to a higher level of care, example WPI[INVESTIGATOR_894085]. All subjects who receive hydrocortisone will be monitored for aminimum of 6 hours in the PET facility, following hydrocortisone administration. Subjects will beevaluated by a physician and discharged home only if they meet the following criteria: (a) ablood pressure of > 90/60 and < 150/90 (b) a heart rate > 50 or < 110 (c) no reportedsubjective or objective side effects from the hydrocortisone at discharge (d) a normal EKG (ornot clinically signiﬁcant, or no change from baseline as determined by a physician) (e) a normalphysical exam (f) and a normal mental status exam.5.25.2What steps will be taken in the event that a clinically signiﬁcant, unexpectedWhat steps will be taken in the event that a clinically signiﬁcant, unexpecteddisease or condition is identiﬁed during the conduct of the study?disease or condition is identiﬁed during the conduct of the study?* *  Addressed below: Addressed below:If a clinically signiﬁcant, unexpected disease or condition occurs during the conduct of the studythat is directly related to study intervention, it will be evaluated and managed by [CONTACT_894132].

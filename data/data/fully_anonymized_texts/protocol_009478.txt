Study Title: Tissue Concentrations of Vancomycin Achieved With Bier Block Administration versus 
Intravenous Prophylaxis in Upper Extremity Surgery: A Randomized Controlled Trial    
 
Protocol version number and date: Protocol v.1.0 - 8/23/20     
 
Research Question and Aims 
 
Hypothesis: Vancomycin administered intravenously via a Bier Block achieves superior soft tissue and 
cancellous bone concentrations compared with systemic IV administration for prophylaxis in upper extremity 
reconstruction without a higher rate of complications. 
 
Aims, purpose, or objectives: To quantify and compare vancomycin concentration in bone and soft tissue: (1) 
after Bier Block administration, (2) after systemic intravenous vancomycin administration, (3) determine if 
there is any difference in complication rate between Bier Block and systemic intravenous administration of 
vancomycin and (4) determine what complications are associated with Bier Block administration of 
vancomycin. 
 
Background ( Include relevant experience, gaps in current knowledge, preliminary data, etc .):  Infections in the 
hand and upper extremity are commonly encountered in clinical practice. Depending on region of practice 
current literature estimates 25-[ADDRESS_1214860] in alternative interventions for hand and upper

Minimal Risk Protocol Template [IRB [ZIP_CODE].010]  Effective: 9/20/[ADDRESS_1214861] shown significantly higher tissue and bone 
concentrations of a comparatively lower dose of Vancomycin administered by [CONTACT_870110] (IORA) when compared to systemic IV administration. These differences remained significant 
through the following day, despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a period of tourniquet deflation, and have also been shown to be significantly 
higher in patients with high BMI regardless of dose adjustment. Regional administration of teicoplanin in the 
lower extremity has also been reported for TKA prophylaxis, resulting in a [ADDRESS_1214862] not been an increased rates of complications reported 
with local administration of these antibiotics. Specifically “red man syndrome” or nephrotoxicity,  is no more 
common with IORA of vancomycin than with systemic IV therapy.  
 
Certain types of hardware or implants may limit the feasibility of IORA in the upper extremity, where smaller 
volumes of cancellous bone are available for injection. However, the cost and availability of supplies for Bier 
Block administration are favorable compared to IORA making this an appealing option for administration of 
high doses of vancomycin within a localized tissue area. In addition, the Bier Block method is commonly 
performed by [CONTACT_870111], is broadly taught, and may have a greater utility for 
clinical use than IORA. There are several complications of Bier Block reported in the literature, although rare, 
they include potential for nerve damage, compartment syndrome, skin discoloration or petechiae, and 
thrombophlebitis. Tissue concentration of antibiotics after administration via Bier Block is currently unknown. 
To assess tissue concentrations our study will analyze patients undergoing reconstructive procedures of the 
hand/wrist. These procedures require removal of bone and soft tissue and will have no detrimental effect on the 
patient. 
 
Bier block administration of regional vancomycin has multiple theoretical advantages. As vancomycin carries a 
high risk of systemic toxicity, local administration will limit the site of action and minimize systemic 
complications of the medication. This method should and allow for a lower dose of medication to achieve an 
equal or greater effect based on previous studies examining IORT. Although the exact pharmacokinetics of 
vancomycin are not completely described, higher concentrations of vancomycin have been associated with a 
greater clinical effect. This may provide greater coverage against resistant organisms as well as lower the 
amount of medication that must be administered to prevent infection. Traditionally vancomycin is administered 
over one hour with high systemic concentrations and can cause a histamine release known as “red man 
syndrome” mirroring symptoms of anaphylaxis. Theoretically, administration to a local area will not activate a 
similar histamine release and will not require the prolonged administration of the medication pre-operatively.

 Patients undergoing upper extremity reconstruction by a single surgeon will be included. Patients will be 
randomized to two arms, with target accrual of 10 cases in the Bier block and systemic intravenous IV groups 
respectively (20 cases total). Surgical cases will include Trapeziectomy/suspensionplasty (30-60 mins duration), 
PI[CONTACT_33263]/MPJ arthroplasty (60-90 min duration), proximal row carpectomy (60 min), and distal ulnar resection (30-
45 mins). The estimated case collection period is approximately [ADDRESS_1214863] or forearm. Sample collection times will be recorded from time of skin incision to equalize for any delays 
in administration of antibiotic via Bier block administration after tourniquet inflation. Time from tourniquet 
inflation to incision will also be documented for both groups. 5 tissue samples (0.5 cm3) from each patient in 
both groups will be obtained: subcutaneous fat (1) and cancellous bone (2) 5-10 minutes after skin incision, 
subcutaneous fat (3) and cancellous bone (4) 20-25 minutes after skin incision, and subcutaneous fat (5) at skin 
closure (45-60 minutes after skin incision).  In the Bier Block group, after the dressing is applied the tourniquet 
will be briefly deflated for 30 seconds and then re-inflated. If there are no signs of “red man syndrome” within 5 
minutes (skin rash of face/neck/or torso, hypotension, tachycardia), then the tourniquet will again be deflated. 
Samples will be stored the Mayo Clinic Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_870109] -90°C, before being transported to Christchurch, New 
Zealand for analysis using a previously validated technique. Bone samples will be crushed with pliers, finely cut 
further with a scalpel, then weighed and immersed in phosphate buffered saline pH 7.[ADDRESS_1214864] Information

Data Analysis 
 
 
Power analyses may not be appropriate if this is a feasibility or pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], but end-point analysis plans are 
always appropriate even if only exploratory. Provide all information requested below, or provide justification if 
not including all of the information.  
 
Power Statement: Previous studies examining IORA of vancomycin show approximately a 4.5 fold increase in 
tissue concentration compared to systemic administration. A priori analysis shows that 10 patients per study arm 
will be required to achieve 80% statistical power with a type I error rate of 0.05.  
 
 
Data Analysis Plan: Means, standard deviations, and the 95% confidence limits will be calculated for the 
concentrations in the different samples. Different tissue samples will be pooled according to collection time. 
Coefficient of variations (CV) of concentration level will be summarized at each time interval for the 
comparison between two arms. Repeat measure analysis of variance will be used to compare the average level 
of concentration across time between groups adjusted by [CONTACT_44207], age, and length of surgical procedure; Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152]-
Wilk test will be used to assess the normality of the residuals. Adverse event will be recorded by [CONTACT_870112]. 
 
 
Endpoints 
Primary: Tissue concentrations of vancomycin in the hand and wrist following Bier Block administration versus 
systemic IV administration 
Secondary: Complications rate of Bier Block administered vancomycin, modes of adverse events, safety of Bier 
Block administered vancomycin ,. which rarely can cause a reaction that includes low blood pressure and skin 
redness or flushing. This is temporary and can usually be treated effectively with an antihistamine. In previous 
studies using a similar technique of intraosseous administration followed by [CONTACT_870113], this has not been 
seen.  Antihistamine will be on hand so that it can be administered should this reaction occur. Additionally,

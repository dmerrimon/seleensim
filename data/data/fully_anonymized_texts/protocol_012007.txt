information (PI)  compared to a titrated dose , in combination with a 
basal insulin in adult subjects (≥18 years of age)  with T1DM or 
T2DM.  
Eligible subjects will be on a stable regimen consisting of a 
basal -bolus insulin therapy  prior to screening . 
The stu dy is composed of up to 4 clinic visits (screening, 2 treatment 
visits, and a follow -up visit) : 
 Screening (Visit 1):  Informed consent will be obtained and 
eligibility confirmed. Eligible subjects will be enrolled at Visit 1.  
 Visit  2: The first dose of Afrezza will be based on the dose of 
subcutaneous rapid -acting insulin analog (RAA)  that the subject 
would normally take, converted according to the guidelines 
provided in the current Afrezza PI . If the subject’s normal RAA 
dose is <[ADDRESS_903700] wi ll be asked to consume enough 
nutritional shake, per their normal insulin:carbohydrate ratio, to 
cover an RAA dose of ≥[ADDRESS_903701]’s glucose excursion at Visit [ADDRESS_903702] 
should proceed to Visit  3 where a second  dose of Afrezza will be 
administered.  
 Visit 3: The second dose of Afrezza will be based on the dose of 
subcutaneou s RAA that the subject would normally take, 
converted by [CONTACT_669034] [ADDRESS_903703] Afrezza cartridge size .  
 Follow -up (Visit 4): Subjects will return for safety assessments 
[ADDRESS_903704] dose of Afrezza . 
Treatment Period  
Subjects will come into the clinic in a fasting state for Visits 2 and 3, 
with exception of treating hypoglycemia. Fasting will be defined as 
no intake of drink or food, with exception of water, for ≥ [ADDRESS_903705] FEV 1 measurements taken in the 
clinic.  
Before each dose of Afrezza, subjects will be trained on proper 
inhalation technique with BluHale® PRO.  
Each meal challenge will con sist of [ADDRESS_903706]’s SMBG value must be between 100 and 200 mg/dL 
without requiring a correction dose of bolus insulin in order to 
receive the Afrezza dose and complete the meal challenge. Subjects 
  Protocol MKC -TI-[ADDRESS_903707] is within the required SMBG range (100 to 200  mg/dL). 
If the subject’s SMBG value is <100 mg/dL at the start of the visit, 
the Investigator can provide [ADDRESS_903708] should 
proceed to the meal challenge. The SMBG value obtained 
immediately before each dose of Afrezza (t=0) will be used to 
determine if the subject can proceed to the meal challenge and will 
serve as the basel ine value  for that visit . 
Subjects will be monitored by [CONTACT_12103] [ADDRESS_903709] additional food for the 2 hours they are in the 
clinic for observation, wit h exception of treating hypoglycemia ; any 
treatment for hypoglycemia (e.g., snack or glucose) will be 
documented .  
Subjects will take SMBG measurement s 15 minutes before their 
Afrezza dose and at t=0  (baseline) , 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 
[ADDRESS_903710] to their Afrezza dose , where t=[ADDRESS_903711] an FEV 1 measurement after completion of  each

1  INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background  
Diabetes constitutes one of the fasting growing global health emergencies.  The prevalence of 
type 1 diabetes mellitus  (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are rising, with nearly half 
a billion people living with diabetes worldwide ( IDF 2019 ). Among adults aged [ADDRESS_903718] diabetes  (~9.3% of all adults in this age group) . 
In both T1DM  and T2DM , the therapeutic ob jective is to optimally control blood  glucose levels 
and this objective is fundamentally the same in all subjects with diabetes , with individual 
circumstances and needs dictating what those optimal levels should be . In order to delay or 
prevent complicatio ns associated with diabetes, it is critical that patients adhere to their diabetes 
treatment regimen. Among patients treated with a multiple daily injection regimen  of insulin , 1 
in 5 (~20%) mealtime injections are intentionally missed , leading to challeng es in achieving 
effective glycemic control  (Peyrot et al. 2010 ). Reasons for omitting insulin injections include 
interference with daily activities, injection pain, and embarrassment.  
Technosphere® Insulin inhalation powder  (TI inhalation powder ) provides an alternative to 
injectable insulin. TI inhalation powder and the Gen2 Inhaler were approved as Afrezza® (insulin 
human) inhalation powder and Afrezza Inhaler by [CONTACT_72563] (FDA)  on 27  June 2014 to improve glycemic control in adult patients ≥ 18 years 
of age with diabetes mellitus and has been registered by [CONTACT_669039] 
(ANVISA) as of [ADDRESS_903719] a median diameter of  
approximately 2 to 2.5 μm, a size appropriate for inhalation into the lung. Following inhalation,  
Afrezza  particles dissolve immediately at the physiologic pH of the lung, and insulin is absorbed 
systemically . After administration of Afrezza  in adults,  the maximum serum insulin 
concentration occurs in approximately 12 to 15 minutes (versus 45  to 60 minutes for a 
rapid -acting insulin analog [RAA] via subcutan eous [SC] route ) and returns to  near baseline 
levels in approximately 180 minutes (versus about 5 hours for RAA) ( Afrezza IB 2021 ).  
This unique ultra-rapid time-action profile allows for simpler and more flexible mealtime dosing, 
lessens t he potential for interprandial hypoglycemia, and enables additional postprandial dosing 
to decrease meal time glycemic excursions, when needed, based on the patient’s self -measured 
glucose levels.   
1.2 Study Rationale  
The current study aims to evaluate 2 differ ent doses of  Afrezza in adults ≥ 18 years of age . 
Subjects will administer an  Afrezza dose based on the current prescribing information (PI) with a 
meal challenge, and then proceed to a second meal challenge where a second Afrezza dose will 
be administered  based on the subject’s RAA dose multiplied by [ADDRESS_903720] to Investigator discretion .  
  Protocol MKC -TI-191 
Confidential  Page 15 of 44 
Pooled Afrezza trial data suggests  that subjects achieve similar glycemic control with a dose 
ratio of 1.5 - to 2-fold the equivalent unit value of a SC insulin analog in head -to-head 
comparisons ( Kendall  et al. 2020 , Grant et al. 2019 ). Thus, the Sponsor has chosen to evaluate 
[ADDRESS_903721] been identified through evaluation of all currently available data 
with Afrezza : 
Important identified risks  
 Bronchospasm in subject s with underlying chronic obstructive lung disease  
 Severe hypoglycemia  
 Hyperglycemia during initiation of treatment due to inadequate conversion of RAA dose  
Important potential risks  
 Diabetic ketoacidosis  (DKA)  
 Hyperglycemia during acute illness or change of treatment  
 Lung cancer: Data are insufficient to determi ne whether Afrezza has an effect on lung or 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_669025]. In subject s with active lung cancer, a prior history of lung 
cancer, or in subject s at risk for lung cancer, the Investigator considers whether the 
benefits of Afrezza use outweigh this potential risk.  
Further information on the benefits and risks of Afrezza  are provided in the Investigator’s 
Brochure  (IB) ( Afrezza IB 2021 ).

The reason and circumstances for early termination  will be documented in the subject ’s case 
report form ( CRF) . The reason for any early discontinuation should be indicated on this form . The 
primary r eason for a subject ’s early  study termination should be selected from the following 
standard categories of early termination:  
 Adverse Event : Clinical or laboratory events occur that, in the medical judgment of the 
Investigator  could affect the subject’s sa fety or well -being if treatment is continued . This 
includes serious (Section 4.1.2 ) and nonserious AEs regardless of relation to the study 
drug. 
 Withdrawal of Consent : The subject  desire s to withdraw from further participation in the 
study in the absence of an Investigator -determined medical need to withdraw. If the 
subject  gives a reason for withdrawing, it should be recorded in the CRF.  
  Protocol MKC -TI-191 
Confidential  Page 20 of 44 
 Major Protocol Violation : The subject’s findings or conduct fails to meet the protocol 
entry criteria or fails to adhere to the protocol requirements  that are deemed to affect 
subject safety or the integrity of the study data .  
 Pregnancy:  The subject becomes pregnant.  
 Smoking:  The subject begins smoking  or vapi[INVESTIGATOR_007] , including smoking marijuana . 
 Lost to Follow -up: The subject  stops coming for visits and study personnel are unable to 
contact [CONTACT_423] . 
 Other : The subject  discontinues  from the study for a reason other than those listed above, 
such as termination of study by [CONTACT_2728].  
If a subject  discontinues from the study  due to the ongoing severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_18960] 2 (SARS -CoV -2) global pandemic, information should be captured on the CRF so 
this information can be summarized in the clinical study report at the end of the study, in line 
with the FDA Gui dance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during COVID -19 
Public Health Emergency ( FDA 2021 ). The reason for discontinuation should be recorded on the 
CRF as SARS -CoV -2/coronavirus 2019 ( COVID -19), if applicable, an d include as many details 
as possible.  
For example, specific reasons may include, but are not limited to:  
 The subject  exhibits symptoms consistent with COVID -[ADDRESS_903734] 10 days  
(yes/no) . 
 The subject  has a positive test result for SARS -CoV -2 (yes/n o).

[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment Period  
Subjects will come into the clinic in a fasting state for Visits 2 and 3, with exception of treating 
hypoglycemia. Fasting will be defined as no intake of drink or food, with e xception of water, for 
≥[ADDRESS_903746] an SMBG value between 100 and 200 mg/dL without requiring a correction 
dose of bolus insulin in order to receive each Afrezza dose and complete the meal challenges. 
  Protocol MKC -TI-[ADDRESS_903747] is within the required SMBG range (100 to 
200 mg/dL). If the subject’s SMBG value is <100  mg/dL, the Investigator can provide [ADDRESS_903748] 
should proceed to the meal challenge. The SMBG value obtained immediately before each dose 
of Afrezza (t=0) will be used to determine if the subject can proceed to the meal challenge and 
will se rve as the baseline value for that visit.  
Each meal challenge will consist of 1 to 2 bottles of nutritional shake to be fully consumed 
within 15 minutes. The nutritional shake will contain approximately 240 calories, 41  g 
carbohydrate, 10 g protein, and 4 g fat per bottle. Each Afrezza dose will be administered at the 
start of the meal challenge.

both Visits 2 and 3 to take SMBG values 15 minutes before their Afrezza dose, immediately 
before administering their dose of Afrezza (t=0 ; baseline ), and at 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes 
after Afrezza  dosing . Additional SMBG measurements may be taken per Investigator discretion.  
3.5.5 Safety Assessments  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Medical History and Demographics  
A detailed medical history should be taken to assess whether or not subjects meet the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, includin g history of diabetes (e.g., age at onset of diabetes, start and 
stop dates of previous insulin treatments, treatment name, dose[s], frequency and method of dose 
delivery, date of clinical diagnosis of T1DM or T2DM).  In addition, subjects will be queried 
about drug and environmental allergies, family pulmonary disease history, and any change in 
their smoking status.

Confidential  Page 31 of 44 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Height and Weight  
Height, in centimeters, should be measured when the subject’s shoes are off, feet together, and 
arms by [CONTACT_21948]. Heels, buttocks, and upper back should also be in conta ct with the wall when 
the measurement is made.  
Body weight, in kilograms, should be obtained with the subject wearing undergarments or very 
light clothing and no shoes, and with an empty bladder. The floor surface on which the scale 
rests must be hard and should not be carpeted or covered with other soft material. The same scale 
should be used throughout the study and calibrated on a regular basis as recommended by [CONTACT_13989].  
The body mass index ( BMI ) value will be calculated based on the height and weight . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include body temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], pulse, and sitting systolic and 
diastolic blood pressures. Vital sign measurements will be recorded with the subject in a sitting 
position for 5  minutes before the measurement  is taken.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pulmonary Function Tests  
Subjects will undergo pulmonary function tests  (spi[INVESTIGATOR_038])  according to American Thoracic 
Society and European Respi[INVESTIGATOR_669029] .  
The FEV 1 values will be recorded in the CRF . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hypoglycemi c Events  
A hypoglycemi c epi[INVESTIGATOR_669030] <70 mg/dL  (i.e., Level 1 
hypoglycemia) or SMBG <54 mg/dL ( i.e., Level 2 hypoglycemia) . Severe hypoglycemic events 
are defined as events requiring assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, 
glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. Severe hypoglycemic events will be documented as 
SAEs in the CRF . Nonsevere hypoglycemic events will not be document ed as AEs but will be 
recorded in the hypoglycemia page of the CRF .  
After the standardized meal challenges at Visit 2 and Visit  3, subjects will be monitored for signs 
of hypoglycemia. Subjects exhibiting signs of hypoglycemia will be treated as appropria te (e.g., 
provided with a snack or glucose) and the type of treatment given and time will be recorded. If a 
subject experiences hypoglycemia, SMBG measurements should be performed every 15  minutes 
until hypoglycemia is resolved.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Laboratory Tests  
The clinical site will collect blood samples  for HbA1c from subjects at Visit 1  and samples will 
be forwarded to the central laboratory for analysis. Urine pregnancy tests  (for β -human chorionic

4 ADVERSE EVENT  REPORTING  
Throughout the course of the study, all AEs will be monitored and re corde d in an AE  page of the  
CRF, including the AE’s description, start and end date, seriousness, severity, action taken, and 
relationship to the study drug . If AEs occur, the first concern will be the safety of the study 
subject s. All AEs will be followed until resolved or stable and the outcome documented in the 
CRF.  
4.1 Definitions and Criteria  
4.1.1 Adverse Events  
Per International Council for Harmonisation  of Tech nical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for 
Human Use  (ICH) E2A , an AE is a ny untoward medical occurrence in a subject  or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have 
to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to 
the medicinal product.  
The intensity of each AE will be determined according to the following criteria:  
 Mild: no modification of daily activities and does not require corrective/symptomatic 
treatment.  
 Moderate: hinders normal daily activities and/or requires corrective/symptomatic 
treatment.  
 Severe: prevents daily activities and requires corrective/symptomatic treatment.  
Medical interventions such as surgeries, diagnostic procedures, and therapeutic procedures are 
not AEs but the action taken to treat a partic ular medical condition. They should be recorded as 
treatment of the AEs.  
4.1.[ADDRESS_903756] medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 Results in death  
 Is life -threatening  
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
 Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 Is an important medical event ( e.g., intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home 
for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse; malignancy tumors 
[histological ly different from primar y tumor] ) 
  Protocol MKC -TI-[ADDRESS_903757]  or may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.  
Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. A n 
SAE is not necessarily severe  (e.g., an overnight hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a diagnostic procedure must 
be reported as an SAE even though the occurrence is not medically serious ). Furthermore, a  
sever e AE is not necessarily serious ( e.g., nausea of several hours’ duration may be rated as 
sever e but may not be considered serious ). 
4.1.[ADDRESS_903758]  
An AESI  is an AE (serious or nonserious) of scientific and medical concern, specific to the 
investigational medicinal product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid 
commun ication by [CONTACT_78784]. Such events may require 
further investigation in order to characterize and understand them.  
For AESIs, the Sponsor must be informed immediately ( i.e., within 24 hours), per the SAE 
notificatio n guidelines described in Section  4.2.2 .  
The following AEs are considered AESIs:  
 Acute bronchospasm  
 Clinically relevant decline in pulmonary function  (>20% decline from baseline  percent 
predicted FEV 1 accompanied by [CONTACT_15206][INVESTIGATOR_1856] ) 
 Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, which can occur with insulin products, 
including Afrezza  
 DKA  
The following diagnostic criteria must be met to be con sidered a DKA event ( ADA 2004 ): 
 Arterial blood pH <7.30 or serum bicarbonate <15 mEq/L  
 Blood glucose >250 mg/dL (or >13.9 mmol/L)  
 Serum ketones or large/moderate urine ketones  
 Symptoms such as polyuria, polydipsia, nausea, or vom iting 
 Treatment provided in a health care facility  
4.1.4 Abnormal Laboratory Value s 
Any abnormality in a laboratory value that is new in onset or that has worsened in severity or 
frequency from the baseline condition and meets one of the following criteria will be recorded in 
the AE pages of the CRF:  
 Requires therapeutic intervention or diagnostic tests  
 Leads to discontinuation of study drug  
 Has accompanying or inducing symptoms or signs  
  Protocol MKC -TI-191 
Confidential  Page 35 of 44 
 Is judged by [CONTACT_33333]  
4.1.5 Assessing Relationsh ip 
The Investigator will classify every AE according to its relationship to study drug , study device, 
or study -related procedure. The AE relationship categories that will be used are listed below : 
Related:   
 An AE that o ccurs at a reasonable time interval after administration of the investigational 
product, use of the device, or procedure  
 An AE that f ollows a known response pattern to the investigational product, use of the 
device, or procedure  
 An AE that i mproves after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_81888],  use of the device, or 
procedure and reappears after repeated exposure to the investigational product, device, or 
procedure. Depending on the nature of the AE, rechallenge may not be possible.  
Probably related:   
 An AE that occurs at a reasonable time inter val after administration of the investigational 
product, use of the device, or procedure  
 An AE that follows a known response pattern to the investigational product, use of the 
device, or procedure, where an alternative explanation (e.g., a concomitant drug  or 
concurrent disease) is less likely  
Possibly related:  
 An AE that o ccurs at a reasonable time interval after administration of the investigational 
product, use of the device, or procedure  
 An AE that f ollows a known response pattern to the investigationa l product, use of the 
device, or procedure, but could have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical status or by

the investigation al product, use of the device, or procedure  
 An AE for which a nother etiology is specified  
Not related :

procedure  
 An AE for which another cause is known  
  Protocol MKC -TI-[ADDRESS_903759]  enrolls in the study (consent date)  until they exit the 
study  will be recorded .  
The Investigator should document all AEs in the subjects’ source documentation, on the AE page 
of the CRF, and the SAE report (if the AE is serious). AEs of hypoglycemia that meet SAE 
criteria should be documented in the AE page of the CRF and SAE report.   
The Investigator should specify the date of the onset of the AE, the intensity (see definitions in 
Section  4.1), action taken with respect to the study drug , corrective treatment/therapy given, 
additional investigations performed, outcome, and the relationship to study drug  (Section 4.1.5 ). 
Whene ver possible, the diagnosis or syndrome should be reported instead of individual 
associated symptoms (e.g., record “influenza” if this is the diagnosis instead of “fever” and 
“chills”).  
Every AE and SAE should be followed until resolved, or resolved with sequelae, or considered 
stable in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689]. To the extent possible, event resolution information will 
be obtained by [CONTACT_669045] (see the site operations manual).  
If the severity of an AE increases, a new AE page in the CRF must be completed for that AE. 
The date of change would be included as the end date for the original AE and the start date for 
the new AE of greater severity.  
4.2.[ADDRESS_903760] and Severe Hypoglycemia  
As soon as possible (desired within 24 hours of Investigator  or study coordinator awareness), the 
investigational center staff must report all events of severe hypoglycemia and AESIs  (including 
DKA) to the Sponsor . For these  events, the AE page of the CRF will be completed with all 
known details as soon as possible, this will serve as notification to the Sponsor . If the study 
database cannot be accessed due to technical problems, contact [CONTACT_669046]. Once the a ccess issue has been corrected, the event should be entered 
onto an AE page in the CRF.  
Source documents that support the event (e.g. , clinic notes, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_571695], lab reports, emergency medical technician  reports, emergency room /urgent care ) should 
be provided to the Sponsor . All source documents/medical records should be redacted. Each 
source page should be identified with the subject identification number . 
4.2.3 Serious Adverse Events  
Prompt notification by [CONTACT_56481] e Sponsor of an SAE (within  24 hours) is essential so 
that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities toward  the safety of participants and the safety 
of a study intervention under clinical investigation are met.

6.4 Data Management and Quality Control  
6.4.1 Case Report Forms  
The Investigator should maintain adequate and accurate source documents and trial records that 
include all pertinent observations on each of the site’s trial subjects. Source data should be 
attributable, leg ible, contemporaneous, original, accurate, and complete.  
All clinical data will be captured in a validated database .  
The Investigator  site staff will enter and edit the data via a secure network, with secure access  
features (username [CONTACT_2383]). A comp lete audit trail will be maintained. The  Investigator 
will approve the data using an electronic signature , and this  approval will be  used to confirm the 
accuracy of the data recorded. Data for all subjects  will be recorded in CRFs . The subject  data 
will be  accessible from the  Investigator ’s site throughout the trial. The CRF must be kept current 
to reflect subject  status at each phase during the course of the trial. The  CRF will not capture 
personalized data. The Investigator  must make a separate confidenti al record of personalized 
details (name [CONTACT_93459]) on the subject  identification and enrollment log.  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator  of the respective site to ensure that all subject  
discontinuations or changes in study or other medications entered in the subject ’s CRF are  also 
made on the subject ’s medical records.  The CRFs for any subject  leaving the study should be 
completed at the time of the final visit or shortly thereafter.  
6.4.2 Stud y Monitoring and Quality Assurance  
This study will be performed in compliance with the Sponsor’s standard operating procedures 
(SOPs) or with the contract research organization’s SOPs, if applicable, and with regulations set 
forth by [CONTACT_1622], ICH, and othe r significant regulatory authorities. Compliance will be achieved 
through study -specific audits of clinical sites and review of data. The Investigator or their 
qualified designee will enter the information required by [CONTACT_669053]. Site monitors should visit each clinical site at a frequency documented in the 
monitoring plan to review CRFs for completeness and accuracy. Any discrepancies found 
between source documents and completed CRFs should be queried and appropriate clini cal site 
personnel should address and or correct those discrepancies.  
Computerized and manual procedures should be used to review and check data from CRFs  and 
data from external sources for omissions, apparent errors, and values that may require  further 
clarification from the clinical site. Data queries will be addressed by [CONTACT_669054]. Only authorized personnel can make corrections to CRF in the  clinical 
database and all corrections are documented in the CRF audit trail.  
6.[ADDRESS_903768] access to all study -related materials, 
study staff, facilities, and source documents for study monitors, auditors, or regulatory 
inspectors.  
6.6 Use of Study Findings  
By [CONTACT_33351], the Investigator agrees to the use of results of the study for the 
purposes of national and international registration. If necessary, the authorities will be notified of 
the Investigator’s name, address, qualifications, and extent of involvement. Reports covering 
clinical and biometric aspects of the study will be prepared by [CONTACT_13668].  
6.[ADDRESS_903769] joint cooperation 
between multiple investigators, sites, and the Sponsor’s personnel. Authorship will be 
established before writing of the manuscript.  
In conformity with International Committee of Medical Journal Edito rs (ICMJE 2019 ) 
recommendations , investigators whose contribution consists solely in the collection of data will 
not be named individually as authors. Rather, those in vestigators may be included in  a collective 
authorship (e.g., “Clinical Investigators ”) or acknowledged individually with their 
contribution(s) specified . 
Individual investigators and/or their associates subsequently may publish additional findings of 
this study in scientific journals or present them at scientific meetings, provided that the Sponsor 
is given ample opportunity to review and authorize the disc losure of data for any proposed 
abstract, manuscript, or slide presentation before its submission. This review is required to 
ensure that the Sponsor authorizes the presentation  of the data prior to disclosure.

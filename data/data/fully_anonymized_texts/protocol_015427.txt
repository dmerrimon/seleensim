12.[ADDRESS_676153] 5 years, data has emerged from numerous countries supporting the safety and efficacy of prostatic artery embolization (PAE) for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in the setting of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (1). In response, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently granted a de novo classification to Merit Medical Systems to expand the indications for Embosphere Microspheres to include PAE for the treatment of BPH.  Moreover, it has given 510(k) 
clearance for Embozene Microspheres.  
 LC Bead LUMI is a spherical polyvinyl alcohol embolic particle that has become available for clinical use over the last two years. It is unique among embolic particles in  
that it is innately radiopaque. It is a reengineered iteration of LC Bead that now includes iodine moieties to provide radiopacity (2). A disadvantage of the new molecular structure is that it has a shorter suspension time and less compressibility (2). These factors can lead 
to clumpi[INVESTIGATOR_521306]-optimal proxi mal embolization.  
 While PAE is clinically effective in as many as 75% of patients at 2 -year follow -up (3), 
there is still uncertainty as to the reasons for failure. Additionally, although they are rare, several major complications have occurred as a result of non-target embolization during PAE (1). Because LUMI is inherently radiopaque, its distribution can be imaged on post-
embolization conventional or cone beam computed tomography (CT). If used for PAE, these scans could provide information about completeness of prostate embolization as well as the presence of non -target embolization, leading to improved embolization 
techniques an d patient selection.  Before these avenues can be investigated, it must be 
determined if PAE can be performed effectively and safely with LC Bead LUMI.  
 1.3 Medical Device  
 
1.3.1 Name [CONTACT_521329] D evice  
LC Bead LUMI  (M0 or M1 bead sizes  are acceptable for use in this trial ) 
 
1.3.2 Intended Use of the Investigational D evice  
LC Bead LUMI will be used for prostatic artery embolization in patients with 
BPH.  
 
1.3.3 Description of the Investigational Device 
LC Bead LUMI  is a spherical polyvinyl alcohol embolic particle that incorporates 
radiopaque moiet ies (2).  Once a catheter has been fluoroscopi[INVESTIGATOR_521307], the beads  are then injected, causing obstruction at the arter iole level  
Page [ADDRESS_676154] (2). In vivo testing in a rabbit VX2 tumor model demonstrated high visibility of the particles after embolization on fluoroscopy and cone beam CT (2). Similar in vivo testing was done in a swine model also 
demonstrating visibility under fluoroscopy and CT (4). Further swine liver model 
testing revealed that LC Bead  LUMI is effective for embolization resulting in 
predictable ischemia/necrosis and excellent long -term biocompatibility (2). 
 
1.5 Clinical Data to Date 
There is no published data available for PAE with LC Bead LUMI. There is a case series reporting safe, successful use of LC Bead LUMI for the treatment of liver cancer in humans (5). There is also data supporting the safe and effective use of a closely related embolic ( Bead Block -also a spherical polyvinyl alcohol embolic 
particle manufactured by [CONTACT_521317]) for PAE (6). 
 
1.[ADDRESS_676155] ( see 
https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/reviews/DEN160040.pdf
).  Embozene 
Microspheres received 510(k) clearance (see 
https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf18/K180102.pdf ).   
 
1.6.1 Safety and Efficacy of Embospheres 
Based on a phase 3 multicenter clinical trial, the procedure using Embospheres was efficacious as 100% of subjects treated with PAE achieved a decrease of 3 or greater in IPSS.  There were a total of 123 adverse event sin the PAE group, of which 86% were classified as mild.  Serious adverse events in PAE patients were lim ited to 
urinary retention, sepsis, fever, UTI, rigors, and nausea in one patient each. A second study has included [ADDRESS_676156] trial also s aw 
improvement in 4 patients at the time of FDA filing without any occurrence of reported adverse events.  
 A review of retrospective patient information for 286 patients also demonstrated efficacy of PAE with 97% of subjects demonstrating a reduction of IPSS of 3 or greater at 9 -16 months.  A total of 85% of total patients experience an adverse event 
with the majority being post-PAE syndrome, which is mild pain in the perineum, retropubic area, and/or urthra; fever; nausea (74.1%).  Serious adverse events occurred in 1%.   
1.6.[ADDRESS_676157] the overall safety and efficacy of Embozene 
Microspheres.    Safety and efficacy was evaluated for Embozene Microspheres in a total of 38 
patients  that underwent PAE for the treatment of BPH in a prospective, single center 
study.  Of these patients, 81.8% saw a reduction of at least 3 points of IPSS within 12 months.  A total of 47% of patients demonstrated symptomatic improvement over baseline at 12 months.  There was also evidence of a reduction in the size of the prostate following the PAE procedure.  Overall, t he study revealed a 100% success 
rate without incidence of non-targeted embolization.  In regards to safety, the study revealed that PAE was safe as there was only an incidence of adverse events in 39.5% of patients, with no serious adverse events reported.  The study did not report any incidence of post-PAE syndrome.

7.2 Effectiveness Assessments 
Technical success will be defined as bilateral prostatic artery embolization. This will 
be determined during the procedure. Clinical success will be defined by a reduction of IPSS of  ≥ 25% and reduction of QoL by ≥[ADDRESS_676170] 3.60% precision  for the 
estimate of percent  change in IPSS score from baseline to 6 month follow-up.(1)   
 
8.[ADDRESS_676171] deviations will be used to summarize both discrete 
questionnaire scores and continuous values for prostate size, Qmax, and PVR for the 
3-12 month follow-up period. Prostate size is only measured before the procedure and 3 months after the procedure.  Percent change will be calculated between the baseline and final values. Continuous measures will be described using 95% confidence intervals.  Feasibility for a future trial will be assessed using retention rates at each visit.    Ret ention rates will be used to plan sample sizes for future studies.   
 Any deviations from the previously described statistical plan will be described and justified in a protocol amendment and/or in the final report submitted to the IDE application.  
8.[ADDRESS_676172] Population(s) for Analysis  
All subjects’  data will be included for analysis even if follow up data is incomplete. 
Every attempt will be made to ensure that there is as little missing data as possible  
including reminder phone calls and follow-up pho ne calls if a subject misses a visit.  
 
8.4 Interim Analysis 
No interim analysis is planned . 
 
9.0 Risk Analysis  
 
9.1 Anticipated Risks  
A recent meta-analysis of PAE data from 662 patients in nine studies reported only two major complication (0. 3% major complication rate) involving bladder ischemia 
requiring surgery and severe urinary sepsis requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Among minor complicat ions transient rectalgia and/or dysuria (9.1%), acute urinary rentention 
(7.9%) and transient hematuria (4.4%) were the most common (1). 
Page [ADDRESS_676173] Malfunctions  
An adverse event (AE)  is defined as any untoward or unfavourable medical 
occurrence in a human patient or clinical trial subject administered a medicinal 
product, including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the patient’s 
participation in the research, and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatme nt (study medication, application of the study device, 
etc.) or study participation. It includes all adverse events regardless of seriousness or 
relatedness.  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE)  is defined as an adverse event that  
a) Results in death  
b) Led to a ser ious deterioration in health that either: 
I. Results in a life -threatening illness or injury, or 
II. Results in a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, 
or 
III. Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929], or 
IV. Results in medical or surgical intervention to prevent life threatening 
illness or injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body 
function.  
V. Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial 
disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions. 
c) Led to fetal distress, foetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
 
A product malfunction is defined as a failure of the device to meet its performance 
specifications, essential function or otherwise perform a s intended. Performance 
specifications include all claims made in the labelling for the device. The essential 
function of a device refers not only to the device's labelled use, but for any use widely 
prescribed within the practice of medicine.  
 
Reporting of Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events and Device Malfunctions  
The Institution and/or the Sponsor-Investigator shall report all and any serious 
adverse events, product malfunctions or quality complaints (regardless of causality) 
that they become aware o f in relation to the Product and/or the investigation to BTG.  
 
All reports will be exchanged in English and Sponsor-Investigator will also provide 
BTG with such information and reasonable assistance as may be requested by [CONTACT_521322].   
 
The Institution and/or the Sponsor-Investigator shall report all SAEs and incidents 
impacting patient safety to [EMAIL_9965] .  
 
SAEs  
The Sponsor- Investigator will report SAEs within one business day to enable BTG to 
comply with their obligations as the device manufacturer, under applicable laws and 
regulations. 
Page 14 of 22 All reports will contain the following, if available: 
• Study title and name [CONTACT_19618]-Investigator.  
• Patient number 
• Adverse event number 
• Date of event occurrence/date notified  
• Product details 
o Product name/ part number 
o Size / dose  
o Batch / lot number 
• Adverse event details along with comprehensive event description  
• Action(s) ta ken to treat or resolve the event  
• Outcome 
• Investigators opi[INVESTIGATOR_260717] i.e. related to 
o Drug  
o Device  
o Procedure 
• Product returned to BTG if applicable  
 
Device Malfunctions  
The Institution and/or the Sponsor-Investigator shall report all device malfunctions 
and/or quality complaints to within one business day of becoming aware of the issue.  
 
9.3 Recording of Adverse Events  
Research subjects will be questioned about adverse effects  by [CONTACT_521323]. In addition they will be given a pager number to reach a 
physician 24 hours a day to report adverse effects and receive medical advice. The subjects wi ll also be questioned about possible adverse effects at each follow-up visit. 
 
All observed or volunteered adverse effects (serious or non-serious) and abnormal test findings, regardless of treatment group, if applicable, or suspected causal relationship to the investigational device or, if applicable, other study treatment or diagnostic product(s) will be recorded in the subjects’ case histories.  For all adverse effects, sufficient information will be pursued and/or obtained so as to permit 1) an adequate determination of the outcome of the effect (i.e., whether the effect should be classified as a serious adverse effect ) and; 2) an assessment of the casual relationship 
between the adverse effect and the investigational device or, if applicable, the other 
study treatment or diagnostic product(s).     Adverse effects or abnormal test findings felt to be associated with the investigational device or, if applicable, other study treatment or diagnostic product(s) will be followed until the effect (or its sequelae) or the abnormal test finding resolves or 
stabilizes at a level acceptable to the investigator -sponsor. 
 An abnormal test finding will be classified as an adverse effect  if one or more of the 
following criteria are met: 
 
• The test finding is accompanied by [CONTACT_521324] 15 of 22 • The test finding necessitates additional diagnostic evaluation(s) or 
medical/surgical intervention; including significant additional concomitant drug treatment or other therapy  
o Note: simply repeating a test finding, in the absence of any of the other listed criteria, does not constitute an adverse effect .   
• The test finding leads to a change in study protocol or discontinuation of subject participation in the clinical research study  
• The test finding is considered an adverse effect  by [CONTACT_1034]-Investigator. 
 
9.[ADDRESS_676174] findings to determine 1) if the abnormal test finding should be classified as an adverse effect; 2) if there is a reasonable possibility that the adverse effect was caused by [CONTACT_343239], if applicable, other study tr eatment 
or diagnostic product(s); and 3) if the adverse effect meets the criteria for a serious 
adverse effect . 
 
If the investigator-sponsor’s final determination of causality is “unknown and of questionable relationship to the investigational device or, if applicable, other study treatment or diagnostic product(s)”, the adverse effect will be classified as associated 
with the use of the investigational device or study treatment or diagnostic drug product(s)  for reporting purposes.  If the investigator -sponsor’s final determination of 
causality is “unknown but not related to the investigational device or, if applicable, other study treatment or diagnostic product(s)”, this determination and the rationale for the determination will be documented in the respec tive subject’s case history.  
 
9.5 Reporting of Adverse Effects  and Unanticipated Problems  
 
9.5.1 Reporting of adverse reactions to the FDA  
The investigator-sponsor will submit a completed FDA Form 3500A
to the FDA’s 
Center for Devices and Radiological Health for any observed or volunteered adverse effect that is determined to be an unanticipated adverse device effect.  A copy of this 
completed form will be provided to all participating sub -investigators. 
 
The completed FDA Form 3500A will be submitted to the FDA as soon as possible 
and in no event, later than [ADDRESS_676175].  
 
If the results of the sponsor-investigator’s follow-up evaluation show that an adverse effect that was initially determined to not constitute an unanticipated adverse device 
effect  does, in fact, meet the requirements for reporting; the investigator-sponsor will 
submit a completed FDA Form 3500A
as soon as possible, but in no event later than 
[ADDRESS_676176] in 
light of the previous, similar report(s). 
 
Page [ADDRESS_676177] (IRB), the investigator will report, to the IRB, any 
observed or volunteered adverse effect  that is determined to be (1) unexpected; (2) 
related or possibly related to the research; and (3) involves increased or greater risk of harm to participant(s) or others than was previously known or approved by [CONTACT_1201]. Adverse effect  reports will be submitted to the IRB in accordance with the IRB 
policies and procedures.  
 
9.6 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_521311] (7).  
9.7 Medical Monitoring  
9.7.1 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
Safety Monitoring will be performed by a licensed physician who is not a study investigator. The CRFs and any relevant source documents will be sent to the medical safety monitor (as above) who will review them after treatment is complete for 
subject 1, 5, 10 and 20.  Complications will be assessed by [CONTACT_978], categorized into major and minor categories and recorded on the CRF. CRFs and appropriate source documents will be m ade 
available to this individual for bi-monthly (every 2 months) review to ensure completeness of data collection. Any discrepancies will be immediately addressed by [CONTACT_978].  All adverse events will be recorded and then summarized for inclusion in the final manuscript.  
 Data monitoring will be performed by [CONTACT_521325] a study investigator. CRFs and appropriate source documents will be made available to this individual for bi-monthly review to ensure completeness of data collection. Any discrep ancies will 
be immediately addressed by [CONTACT_978].  9.7.[ADDRESS_676178] of 1996 (HIPAA).  Consistent with these regulations a signed authorization will be obtained 
that informs each subject of the following:   
Page 17 of 22 • What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in 
this study 
• Who will have access to that information and why 
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.  
10.2 Source Document s 
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  All data requested on the CRF must be recorded.  All missing data must be explained.  If a space on the CRF is left blank because the procedure was not done or the question was not asked, write “N/D”.  If the item is not applicable to the individual case, write “N/A”.  All entries should be printed legibly in black ink.  If any entry error has been made, to correct such an error, draw a single straight line through the incorrect entry and enter the correct data above it.  All such changes must be initialed and dated.  DO NOT ERASE OR WHITE OUT ERRORS.  For clarification of illegible or uncertain entries, print the clarification above the item, then initial and date it.  
 Copi[INVESTIGATOR_521312].  CRFs should be sent within 5 business days to ensure timely entry.  
10.3 Case Report Forms  
The case report forms will be collected by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_521313].  The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  All data requested on the CRF must be recorded.  All missing da ta must be 
explained.  If a space on the CRF is left blank because the procedure was not done or the question was not asked, write “N/D”.  If the item is not applicable to the individual case, write “N/A”.  All entries should be printed legibly in black ink.  If any entry error has been made, to correct such an error, draw a single straight line through the incorrect entry and enter the correct data above it.  All such changes must be initialed and dated.  DO NOT ERASE OR WHITE OUT ERRORS.  For clarificatio n of illegible or uncertain entries, print the clarification above the item, 
then initial and date it.  
 The coordinator at each site will complete the first CRF together with one of the Co-
PIs to verify that it is completed correctly. Then, we will verify a randomly selected 
25% of all source docs at the conclusion of data collection.  Randomization will occur on a visit level and not per patient.  The randomization for this verification will be generated using a random number generator in Excel. 
Page [ADDRESS_676179] Retention  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to retain study essential documents  during the 
investigation and for a period of 2 years after the latter of the following two dates: 
The date on which the investigation is terminated or completed, or the date that the records are no longer required for purposes of supporting a premarket approval application or a notice of completion of a product development protocol.  These documents should be retained for a longer period if required by [CONTACT_16477].  In such an instance, it is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained.   
Research records and original signed consent forms are to be retained by [CONTACT_168062] [INVESTIGATOR_25653] [ADDRESS_676180] consent form and the HIPAA authorization form.

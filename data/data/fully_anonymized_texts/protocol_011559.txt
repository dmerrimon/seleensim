  Randomization/ Registration Procedure  
 Heart transplant patients will be recruited for participation solely from the University of 
Nebraska Heart Transplant clinic.  Our program provides care for approximately [ADDRESS_320466] a known diagnosis of CAV  with more 
expected to be diagnosed in the coming year . 
 Heart transplant patients with CAV will be identified by [CONTACT_263503].  Eligible individuals will then be invited to participate (by [CONTACT_263504] a clinical appointment) by [CONTACT_263505].  Interested patients will then be referred to trained personnel for informed consent, screening and study enrollment.   Coordination is expected between study enrollment 
and a standard post -transplant clinic appointment to facilitate participation.  
 
This study will be an open label, single cohort study.  No randomization of patients  or 
treatment blinding will occur .  Enrollment is expected to take one year, with an 
additional one year of follow -up resulting in a total study duration of two years.  
    
Research Study Design  
 
Standard post -transplant care  
 Heart transplant patients with CAV who primary transplant followup care at the University of Nebraska will serve as the study cohort.  Given the complexity of heart transplant patients, care is highly - protocolized and organized according to graft age.  
Care is most intensive in the first year following transplant wherein patients are initially 
evaluated on a weekly basis for the first month with reduced frequency (biweekly   
monthly  quarterly) based on clinical progress  over the first year .  During year [ADDRESS_320467] -transplant patients can 
often be seen on an annual basis.  Thorough evaluations are completed annually 
including comprehensive labwork (complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, fasting lipid panel, thyroid function tests, hemoglobin A1c, creatinin e kinase, urine 
protein analysis), assessment for donor specific antibodies, and imaging/testing.  Imaging/testing includes an annual echocardiogram and chest x -ray as well as other 
imaging (DEXA scan, carotid and abdominal ultrasounds) at frequencies determined by 
[CONTACT_263506].  Immunosuppression is maintained with calcineurin inhibitors (primarily tacrolimus) and DNA synthesis inhibitors (mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolic acid or azathioprine).  Patients are switched to mTOR inhibitors (primarily sirolimus) if significant renal dysfunction develops or CAV is diagnosed.  High dose steroids are started at the time of transplant and typi[INVESTIGATOR_263499].  
Calcineurin inhibitors and mTOR inhibitors are dosed according to trough serum levels, and thus monitored at least every three months indefinitely.  
 CAV is diagnosed by [CONTACT_89320].  Patients undergo a left heart cardiac catheterization annually for the first five years per standardized protocol.  Beyond five years, cardiac 
catheterization can be alternated with a dobutamine stress echocardiogram .  If the 
dobutamine stress test is abnormal (wall motion changes), a cardiac catheterization is completed to assess for CAV.   Once patients are diagnosed with CAV, annual cardiac 
catheterizations are completed.  Severity of CAV, once present, is based on 
angiographic findings as outlined in Table 3 below [1].  Of note, intravascular ultrasound 
can also identify CAV but is currently not used to guide management beyond changing 
immunosuppression regimen due to less outcome data (compared to cardiac catheterization).  
 Transplant patients are closely monitored for graft rejection.  In general, rejection risk declines with increasing donor graft age.  Surveillance endomyocardial biopsies are completed during the first year post -transplant (selected patients can undergo serum 
gene expression testing in lieu of endomyocardial biopsy).  Donor specific antibodies are monitored on annually.  Beyond one year post -transplant, rejection is detected 
primarily by [CONTACT_23805] (new onset CHF symptoms, arrhythmias or increasing fatigue) or systolic dysfunction on echocardiogram which prompts an endomyocardial biopsy.

 Research study design  – patient enrollment and evolocumab administration  
 Heart transplant patients with CAV will be eligible for enrollment per inclusion and exclusion criteria listed in Section 3.  The majority of heart transplant patient are on 
statin therapy (pravastatin is most common).  Evolocumab will be given either as add- on 
therapy for heart transplant patients with CAV currently prescribed statin or other LDL lowering therapy, as well as  those unable to tolerate lipid- lowering medications.  
 Study participation is expected to coordinate with the standard care of heart transplant patients.  As most patients with CAV are more than [ADDRESS_320468] -transplant, enrollment 
will likely occur around the patient’s annual clinical evaluation.   Female patients of 
childbearing potential will un dergo pregnancy testing prior to or during the 
screening/ enrollment  visit before study drug administration.   Informed consent and 
baseline documentation will be completed by [CONTACT_263507]’s annual evaluation when feasible.    
 Enrolled study participants will be treated with evolocumab (Repatha) [ADDRESS_320469] self -administration by [CONTACT_263508].  Study drug will be 
distributed to patients via courier or Fed Ex temperature- controlled coolers by [CONTACT_263509].  The evolocumab dose (140 mg every 2 weeks) will remain 
constant for the duration of the study.  Side effects will be assessed on a quarterly basis .  Serious adverse events considered related to treatment , death, and pregnancy 
will all result in immediate discontinuation of the study drug.  
 Primary endpoint  – LDL percentage change after [ADDRESS_320470] benchmark for comparison of heart transplant 
patients.  Baseline LDL will be obtained at study enrollment, likely with the patient’s 
annual clinical evaluation.  After [ADDRESS_320471] -transplant care includes 
annual angiograms in patients diagnosed with CAV to monitor for disease progression.  CAV progression will be defined as an increase of one CAV grade (CAV -1  CAV-2 or 
CAV-2CAV-3).  The number  of patients with CAV progression of at least one grade 
while on evolocumab will be compared to  historical controls for our transplant program.   
Percentage diameter stenosis for each vessel with visible CAV also will be determined 
by [CONTACT_263510] (QCA) using Philips Xcelera software package in a blinded fashion by [CONTACT_263511], at study entry, and study conclusion.  Angiographic change while on evolocumab therapy will be compared to the preceding year.  
 Assess the effect of evolocumab on immunosuppression regimens and graft rejection.  Transplant patient are maintained on lifelong i mmunosuppression.  These agents are 
prone to significant drug- drug interactions which can limit therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Serum levels of 
immunosuppression are monitored every three months per standard protocol.  
Measured serum levels at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, as well as t he number of dose 
adjustments while on evolocumab therapy while on evolocumab therapy will be compared to the preceding y ear.  Statistical adjustment for confounding factors such as 
changes in renal function or other drugs known to alter immunosuppression levels (i.e. diltiazem, certain antimicrobial drugs) will be completed.  In addition, the incidence of transplant rejection will be documented while on evolocumab therapy and compared to the prior year.   Transplant rejection will be defined as symptoms requiring therapeutic 
intervention or endomyocardial biopsy findings of ≥ grade [ADDRESS_320472] of evolocumab on serum lipi[INVESTIGATOR_263500] 1 year of therapy .  Fasting lipid profiles ( total cholesterol, LDL, HDL and triglycerides) 
after [ADDRESS_320473] 
(DSMB) will be established to monitor participant safety, data quality and evaluate the 
progress of the study.  
  Drug Formulation and Procurement  
 Study drug (evolocumab) will be provided by [CONTACT_21931].   While evolocumab is 
commercially available and FDA approved for patient use, storage and distribution in 
this study will be managed by [CONTACT_263512].  Study drug will be stored by [CONTACT_263513] .  
Study participants receive study drug quarterly directly from research pharmacy staff or via courier in temperature- controlled KoolTempGTS  coolers  (Cold Chain Technologies, 
Franklin, [LOCATION_005]).  Drug accountability will be managed by [CONTACT_263514].  
  Toxicity and Adverse Event Reporting Guidelines  
 Evolocumab is currently FDA -approved and commercially available for patient use in 
the [LOCATION_002].  Currently used in patients for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease and treatment of primary hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_263501], adverse event data is 
available from greater than 27,000  patients enrolled in clinical trials.  Clinical experience 
has shown evolocumab to be well -tolerated with minimal adverse events  (see Tables 4 
and 5 below ).   
 Adverse events will be assessed by [CONTACT_263515] 2, 4, 12, 26, 38 and 
study conclusion (52) .  Events will be obtained either by [CONTACT_263516] a 
standard- of-care clinic visit.   Data will be stored and managed using the Forte Electronic 
Data Capture (EDC) software system.  Adverse events will be collected using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE) version 5.0 forms.  Adverse events will be quantified and presented by [CONTACT_34565].  Reported events will be cataloged and reported to the University of Nebraska IRB and [COMPANY_010] annually and at 
the conclusion of the study  by [CONTACT_2710] .  Reported events will be 
independently reviewed by a cardiology faculty member with significant experience 
prescribing PC SK9 inhibitors .   
 All suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) related or possibly related to evolocumab and their follow -up reports will be reported to [COMPANY_010] within 24 
hours of submission to the regulatory agency or IRB.  [COMPANY_010] will be informed of any pregnancy occurring and/or existing during exposure to the investigational medicinal 
product and pregnancies occurring in the partner of a patient participating in the study 
and potential infant exposure within ten (10) calendar days of sponsor awareness.  
  Section [ADDRESS_320474] assistance of faculty from the University of Nebraska biostatistics department. Sample size (n=40) is chosen based on the size of the heart transplant clinic (the number of heart transplant patients wi th CAV 
expected to be eligible for study participation) . 
 The primary outcome is percentage change from the baseline in LDL levels after [ADDRESS_320475] demonstrated that evolocumab lowers LDL cholesterol at week 12 by [CONTACT_7809] 50% from baseline [2, 3]. The sample size of 
n=40 is expected to yield greater than 99% power to detect 50% reduction of LDL cholesterol from baseline after [ADDRESS_320476] 
deviation of reduction of 0.17.  
 Descriptive statistics will be presented as frequencies and percentages for categorical variables, and mean ± standard deviation, or median with range for continuous variables, unless otherwise indicated. Paired t -tests or Nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-
rank tests will be completed where appropriate to compare the primary endpoint before 
and after 12 weeks of evolocumab therapy, and compare continuous secondary endpoints after 1 year of evolocumab therapy to baseline. A linear mixed model analysis 
will be co nducted to analyze immunosuppression serum levels measured at baseline, 3 
months, 6 months, 9 months, and 1 year of evolocumab therapy. The binary secondary endpoint of CAV progression will be assessed after 1 year of evolocumab therapy using 
McNemar tests. Safety data will be reported with frequencies and percentages. All tests will be two -tailed. A p -value <0.05 will be considered significant. Analysis will be 
performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Insti tute, Cary, NC). 
 Given the limited statistical power due to the small cohort, conclusions from secondary endpoints are expected to by [CONTACT_263517] -generating with data providing 
support for potential future studies.

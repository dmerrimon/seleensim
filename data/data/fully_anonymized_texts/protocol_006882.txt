Improving Ventilatory Capacity in Those with Chronic High Level SCI 
 
I. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
  
Chemoreceptive regulatory feedback is crucial for precise ventilatory control, especially during 
exercise [1]. However, individuals with high-level SCI have a reduced chemoreceptive drive to 
breathe. Studies have shown lesser increases in minute ventilation and mouth pressure during 
hypercapnia in those with tetraplegia [2,3]. Peripheral factors rather than central factors appear 
to cause the reduction of the ventilatory response to hypercapnia [2]. This reduced ventilatory 
drive may have functional impact on exercise ventilation in patients with high level SCI [3] and 
enhancing ventilatory drive may improve exercise ventilation in high-level SCI. 
 
Currently, there are no treatments to overcome these functional deficits that affect daily activity 
and exercise-based rehabilitation recovery. However, previous work in an animal model of SCI 
has found that that a serotonin agonist markedly increases respi[INVESTIGATOR_581398]. Treatment with a serotonin 5HT1A agonist effectively improved the ventilatory drive after 
both acute [4] and chronic [5] spi[INVESTIGATOR_581399]. One potential mechanism is increased 
excitability of the ventral motoneurons that have survived the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828]. 5-HT1A receptors 
do exist on these neurons [6], and when activated, amplify the excitatory output [7]. Another 
mechanism resides at the intercostal and abdominal muscle afferents which influence supraspi[INVESTIGATOR_581400] [8,9]. 
Hence, serotonin agonists may act on neural pathways in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_581401]. Lastly, 5-HT1A 
receptors may also be involved in functional plasticity of neural respi[INVESTIGATOR_581402], in particular 
ipsilateral phrenic nerve activity [10] [11]. Up regulation of 5-HT1A receptors due to denervation 
supersensitivity could result in postsynaptic hyperresponsivity due to loss of descending input. 
 
BuSpar/Buspi[INVESTIGATOR_131521] a serotonin 5HT1A agonist and used as an anxiolytic in humans. It does not 
cause sedation, has minimal effects on psychomotor performance or cognition, and has low 
threshold for abuse potential or dependence liability [12]. Prior studies have found Buspi[INVESTIGATOR_581403] [13,14]. It has been used safely in spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828], but not for respi[INVESTIGATOR_581404] [15]. (Though there is one clinical trial in process: Role of Enhancing Serotonin 
Receptors Activity for Sleep Apnea Treatment in Patients With SCI.) However, Buspi[INVESTIGATOR_581405] 
60 mg daily has been used to treat disturbed respi[INVESTIGATOR_581406] [16], brain 
cancer [17], and brainstem infarction [18]. Interestingly, in patients with COPD, a 14-day oral 
administration of buspi[INVESTIGATOR_5331] (20 mg) found improved anxiety and depression as well as increased 
exercise tolerance with lesser sensations of dyspnea [19]. Hence, buspi[INVESTIGATOR_581407] a 
treatment to improve hypercapnic ventilatory drive. Given that oral administration of 30 mg results 
in peak plasma levels at one hour and that the average elimination half-life is about 2 to 3 hours, 
buspi[INVESTIGATOR_581408]/or hypercapnia exposure in those with high level 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_581409].  
 
HYPOTHESIS 
We hypothesize that oral buspi[INVESTIGATOR_581410] (chemosensitivity) in response to 
progressive hypercapnia and in response to exercise in individuals with SCI,.

preliminary eligibility requirements. Subjects who meet preliminary eligibility criteria and are 
interested in participating will be sent the informed consent letter at least one week before the first 
visit.  
 
Screening & at home sleep evaluation 
Informed consent will be obtained at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Cambridge. Subjects will 
be screened to ensure they meet preliminary eligibility criteria. All subjects will undergo a clinical 
interview to determine the presence of any medical disorders.  
 
The following study assessments will be completed: 
 Sleep Evaluation 
 
 
Visit 1: Baseline Evaluation Visit 
 
The following study assessments will be completed: 
 Height and Weight 

 
 Page 6 of 11 Buspar study V5, September 22, 2021 
  Resting blood pressure and heart rate 
 Pulmonary function test 
 CO [ADDRESS_764458] 
 Maximal arm-crank exercise test 
 
Visit 2 & 3: Laboratory Testing Visit 
The second and third laboratory visits will be separated by [CONTACT_581448]. All subjects will be 
instructed to abstain from vigorous exercise for 2 days prior to avoid muscle fatigue as well as 
autonomic and neuroendocrine effects of exercise, and instructed to refrain from caffeine and 
alcohol for the previous 24 hrs.  
 
Distribution of Study Medication at the end of visit  1 and 2  
After initial screening testing measures are complete, study medication (Buspar/Placebo) will be 
distributed to all volunteers by a study physician. Participants will be instructed as to how to take 
the medication dose. The initial dose of buspi[INVESTIGATOR_581416] 15 mg daily (for two days) and will be 
increased by 15 mg to a dose of 30mg/day (15 mg in the morning and 15 mg iat night) with a  
2-day 15 mg daily taper at the end of the two weeks. 
 
Follow-up between visit 3 1-2 and 4 2-3: Adverse Event Monitoring (Telephone) day  
Study staff will check in with study participants over the telephone at one week intervals to monitor 
any side effects or adverse events of the medication. If subjects are experiencing intolerable side 
effects, they will be taken off of the medication while completing the remaining study procedures. 
Participants will be informed that they may call study staff directly to report any side effects or 
adverse events at any time during the study.  
 
Parameters to be measured  
 Resting blood pressure and heart rate 
 Pulmonary function test 
 CO [ADDRESS_764459] 
 Arm-crank Maximal exercise test  
 Sleep Evaluation 
 
 
Measurements   
 
1) Pulmonary function test and resting blood pressure  
Standard measurement of resting brachial arterial blood pressure and heart rate 
(electrocardiogram) will be performed. 
 
All subjects will performed standard spi[INVESTIGATOR_581417], as previously described [20]. 
The same technician will test all subjects. Subjects will be seated with belts or pant waists 
loosened and with a nose clip. The maneuver will be demonstrated, and instructions will be given 
to inhale completely and “blast” the air out. The subject will be encouraged to exhale maximally 
and sustain the effort at least [ADDRESS_764460] to continue. The volume-time curve will be recorded on a kymograph, and the flow-
volume loop will be electronically displayed for review. An acceptable effort will be a minimum 
exhalation time of 6 sec with a rapid start and a well-defined early peak in flow that is smooth and 
continuous. Three acceptable efforts will be obtained. 
 
2) CO2 rebreathing test  
 
 Page 7 of 11 Buspar study V5, May 5, 2025  
 
 We will use the Duffin’s Modifiication of the Read rebreathing method from a bag containing 93 
95% O 2 [to suppress peripheral chemoreceptor activity] and  5% CO 2, as previously described in 
the literature [21]. Subjects will be on a mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_581418]. Subjects will be 
coached to hyperventilate in room air for ~5 min. Then, they will be asked to exhale below 
functional residual capacity and then switched to the rebreathing bag for  rebreathing  95% O 2 
and 5% CO 2. The PCO 2 measured at the mouth will approximate the PCO 2 at the level of the 
chemoreceptors. Rebreathing will continue until end-tidal PCO 2 (PETCO 2) reaches 55 mmHg (or 
7.5% at a barometric pressure of 755 mmHg) and will be termintaed if the subject feels that he or 
she cannot continue. Minute ventilation, PETCO 2, tidal volume, inspi[INVESTIGATOR_21265], expi[INVESTIGATOR_581419].  
 
3) Maximal incremental arm crank exercise  
Subjects will perform arms crank exercise with increasing increasing power output every [ADDRESS_764461] 3 of the following criteria will be met: 1) O 2 consumption 
plateaus despi[INVESTIGATOR_132228], 2) respi[INVESTIGATOR_581420] 1.10 at 
end exercise, 3) peak lactate greater than 7.5 mmol/L, 4) perceived exertion is rated at least [ADDRESS_764462] a finger tip pricked with 
a safety lancet to obtain a drop of blood to measure peak lactate levels. 
 
4) Sleep Evaluation  
 
An in-home Single night Polysomnography (PSG) using the type 2 level NOX A1 (NoxMedical) 
device will provide quantitative assessments of levels of overnight hypoxemia, apneas and 
hypopneas, sleep stage distributions, and will provide quantitative data on snoring. The 
recording montage will include five, self-applied frontal electroencephalogram electrodes, thoracic 
and abdominal respi[INVESTIGATOR_400495], airflow via nasal cannula, ECG (4 
electrodes on torso), leg movement sensors, finger pulse oximetry, and snoring microphone.   
Participants will be instructed on self-application of all sensors before bedtime, using simple pi[INVESTIGATOR_581421] a phone number of a staff member to contact [CONTACT_581449]-
up be encountered. Instructions will be given on how to move about with the recording unit, and 
how to self-remove the electrodes and sensors. The NOX A1 PSG units will be returned by [CONTACT_581450]’s earliest convenience. 
 
PSG studies will be downloaded from collection equipment to the SRC computer using commercial 
software. Scoring of the PSGs will be made by a trained member of the study group through  
visualizing each epoch on a high resolution computer monitor using specialized software.  
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_29343], sleep stages and EEG (cortical) arousals will be scored according to standard 
guidelines. 
 
 
VI. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
 
Sample Size  
Sample size is based on previous data from our laboratory. We used mean and standard deviation 
of peak ventialtion during arm crank exercise in individuals with low and high level SCI (Battikha 
 
 Page 8 of 11 Buspar study V5, September 22, 2021 
 et al. 2014). We assume that Buspi[INVESTIGATOR_581422] 35% in humans, 
though to our knowledge, there is no reference available on the ventilatory effect of Buspi[INVESTIGATOR_581423]. Thus, with a highest SD of 8.3 L/min, we expect that peak ventilation during 
arm crank ergometer exercise in high level individuals with SCI will be increased from 31.3 L/min 
at baseline to 42.1 L/min with buspi[INVESTIGATOR_5331], as compared with no change in the placebo-controlled 
group. With an a p level of 0.05 and a power of 80%, the sample size calculation indicates that 
we need at least 9 participants per group. Anticipating 10% drop out, we will need 10 participants 
per group, for a total of 20 participants. 
  
 
Statistics  
These projects will employ typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]/appropriate statistical approaches to compare changes within 
and between groups. Statistical significance will be set at 0.05, and power at 80%. Statistical 
tests, conformity of the data to required statistical assumptions (e.g., normal distribution) will be 
verified using standard methods (e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics and Q-Q plots). If 
assumptions for parametric tests do not hold, non-parametric alternatives will be employed. 
Correlations between variables will be assessed when necessary by [CONTACT_141612]’s or Spearman’s 
coefficient depending on the normality of the variables. If significant relations are found, 
appropriate regression analyses will be employed. 
  
 
VII. RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS  
 
Moderate risks are associated with exercise (arm-crank) testing. Some discomfort and feeling of 
fatigue will be experienced during these tests. There are other risks associated with these tests 
including abnormal blood pressure responses, fainting, irregular, fast or slow heart rhythm, and 
in rare instances, heart attack, stroke, or death. Wearing the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_581424]-crank 
exercise testing may cause feelings of claustrophobia. Exercise testing may also induce some 
muscle or joint discomfort when and could result in tendonitis and/or musculoskeletal injuries. 
There is some discomfort with the lancet used on the finger for lactate measurement. 
 
There are no known risks associated with the EKG or blood pressure measurement. A subject 
must remove or lift up his or her shirt and have sticky patches applied to the chest for the 
electrocardiogram (EKG). In some cases, chest hair may have to be shaved where the EKG 
patches are placed. If an abnormality is identified on an EKG, the subject would be given this 
information and referred to his or her own doctor for further evaluation. Subjects may feel 
lightheaded or short of breath during the pulmonary function tests, there is also a slight chance 
that individuals become dizzy. The CO 2 re-breathing may cause slight lightheadedness in some 
people; however, this can be reversed almost immediately by [CONTACT_581451]. 
 
Buspar: BuSpar(r) (Buspi[INVESTIGATOR_581425], USP) is an antianxiety agent that is not chemically or 
pharmacologically related to the benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], barbiturates, or other sedatives/anxiolytics 
drugs. The mechanism of action of Buspi[INVESTIGATOR_581426]. Common side  effects include: 
drowsiness, fatigue, dry mouth, or an increase in nightmares or dreams. Rare, but serious side 
effects include: an allergic reaction (difficulty breathing; hives; swelling of lips, tongue or face); 
chest pain or an irregular heartbeat; headache, dizziness, lightheadedness, slurred speech, 
confusion or blurred vision; numbness or tingling in hands, feet, arms or legs; depression; or 
uncontrolled movements of arms, legs tongue or lips.

sensors.  
 
 
 
VIII. POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
 
This research may help physicians and scientists to better understand how the interaction 
between a serotonin agonist pharmacological agent (buspar) and minute ventilation during 
hypercapnia and exercise. Although it is possible volunteers may better tolerate CO 2- rebreathing 
and exercise with buspar, this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_581427]. 
 
IX. MONITORING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 
 
The research coordinator will be responsible for monitoring the completeness of all data and 
source documents. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_581428]. The subjects data/protocol adherence will be monitored by [CONTACT_581452]. Checklists and note pages are used to note any deviations or 
omissions from the protocols. All spi[INVESTIGATOR_581429] “Pre-Study 
Screening” questions before every visit. The Cardiovascular Research Laboratory Medical 
Emergency Safety Plan will be followed in the case of an adverse medical event.  Any 
clinical/health related issues would be immediately presented to the subject (i.e. abnormal EKG, 
blood chemistries, etc) to determine appropriate notification (ie. current physician or appropriate 
specialist) Based on the seriousness of the situation a physician may be contact[CONTACT_132254]. 
 
Serious adverse events will be reported to the IRB via phone, email, or fax. The principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_581430] a full written report using the PHRC Adverse Event Form within 
10 working days. If a mild or moderate adverse event occurs that is definitely, probably, or possibly 
related to the study, a written report will be sent to the IRB within 20 working days. All other events 
will be summarized in a progress report at continuing review.

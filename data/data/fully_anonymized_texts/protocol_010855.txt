ABSTRACT  
Retinoblastoma is the most common primary intra -ocular malignancy in childhood. Two-thirds of children 
diagnosed with retinoblastoma  have disease in one eye only (unilateral disease). About 85% of the children 
with unilateral retinoblastoma have advanced disease at the time of diagnosis and the standard of care in 
these children is enucleation of the eye . Although this procedure is curative in over 90% of children , there 
is a desire among many families to preserve the eye. Furthermore , some  of these eyes have useful vision 
that is lost with enucleation.  
 Systemic chemotherapy in combination with local ophthalmic therapy  has been used with the goal of 
avoiding enucleation. Studies have shown that chemoreduction and l ocal therapy do not provide effective 
control in patients w ith advanced unilateral disease and  a high proportion of these patients eventually 
require either external beam radiation therapy or enuc leation.  
 Localized  delivery of chemotherapy directly into the ophthalmic artery may increase ocular salvage and 
result in less toxicity than systemic chemotherapy. However, this complex technique requires a high level 
of expertise that is currently avail able only at large pediatric centers with excellent infrastructure . Several  
institutions within the [LOCATION_002] and in other countries are currently  using this modality. A s more 
centers engage  in this treatment toxicities are being reported, including acute vitreous hemorrhage, 
chorioretinal atrophy, and ophthalmic artery stenosis. A properly designed prospective study to evaluate 
the feasibility and efficacy of this procedure in the context of  a multi -institutional study  is a critical next 
step towards the goal of establish ing guidelines for the safe implementation of the intra- arterial technique 
across COG sites.  
 
ARET12P1 is designed to test the feasibility of delivering melphalan directly into the ophthalmic artery in 
children with newly diagnosed unilateral retinoblastoma with G roup D disease , by [CONTACT_913942],  who would otherwise be considered for enucleation. 
Response to therapy and  toxicity of the regimens will also be assessed.  This study will be the first attempt 
to perform a well -conducted clinical trial  of intra-arterial  therapy for unilateral retinoblastoma  with 
emphasis on feasibility and efficacy in a multi -institutional tria l.

1.3.1 To evaluate the effects of intra- arterial therapy on the histopathology of eyes 
enucleated for progression.  
 
2.0 BACKGROUND  
2.1 Introduction/Rationale for Development  
Retinoblasto ma is the most common primary intra- ocular malignancy in childhood. Two-
thirds of children diagnosed with retinoblastoma  have disease in one eye only (unilateral 
disease). About 85% of the children with unilateral retinoblastoma have advanced disease 
at the time of diagnosis and the standard of care in these children is enucleation of the eye . 
Although this procedure is curative in over 90% of children , there is a desire among many 
families to preserve the eye. Furthermore, some  of these eyes have useful vi sion that is lost 
with enucleation.  
 
Systemic chemotherapy in combination with one or more of other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_913919]. E xternal beam 
radiation or radioactive plaque therapy  have also been used for effective orbital and 
intraocular disease control.  Shields et al. have shown that chemoreduction alone in patients 
with advanced unilateral disease does n ot provide effective control of disease; in their study 
all such patients eventually required either external beam radiation therapy or enucleation.1 
Furthermore ocular oncologists strongly feel that to treat a patient with intraocular tumor (s) 
with systemic chemotherapy of several months duration with subsequent toxicities is not 
optimal.  
 
In countries like Japan where there is particular emphasis by [CONTACT_913943], attempts were made by [CONTACT_913944] n of the ophthalmic artery.2 The aim 
was to facilitate chemotherapy to enter the ophthalmic artery. The drug they chose f or intra -
arterial chemotherapy was melphalan based on in vitro studies.3 Using this technique 
Suzuki and Kaneko reported 563 injection s in 187 patients with a low rate of complications. 
All of the eyes treated also received concomitant therapy with either hyperthermia, external beam radiation and/or, in [ADDRESS_1284213] further developed the technique by [CONTACT_913945], SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ARET12P1 
Version Date: 03/ 30/[ADDRESS_1284214] recent update, 95 eyes in 78 
patients (30 unilateral, 48 bilateral) were treated with intra -arterial chemotherapy.7 The 
mean number of procedures was 3.2 per patient and 3.1 per eye. Chemotherapy included 
melphalan alone , or in combination with topotecan, and/or carboplatin. The ocular salvage 
rate was 81.7% for the 39 previously untreated eyes and 58.4% for the 56 R- E V eyes that 
had failed prior treatments. Catheterization was successful in 98.5% of patients. The ocular 
salvage rate was 81.7% for the 39 previously untreated eyes and 58.4% for the 56 R -E V 
eyes that had failed prior treatments. Catheterization was successful in 98.5% of patients. Neutropenia developed after 29 of 255 IA sessions (11.4%) and of these only 8 were grade 
4; only one child required admission for fever and neutropenia. No child required blood 
products. All the children are alive including [ADDRESS_1284215] recent 
report on IA therapy in children with retinoblastoma an initial dose finding phase was 
described where efficacy and toxicity were assessed during examination under anesthesia every 3 -4 weeks after treatment.
7 The recommended doses of melphalan from this study 
were 3 mg for patients between 6 and 12 months of age, 4 mg between the ages of 12 months and 24 months and 5 mg between 24 months and 36 months. Initial drug dosage 
was based on age which provides an estimate of the ocular size.
13,14 However upon further 
review of the literature addressing growth in globe volume, we feel that consistent and uniform dosing across the ages will be obtained with 3 mg (6 to 11.99 months), 3.5 mg

vasculature of the ophthalmic artery .  
 
Several institutions within the [LOCATION_002] and institutions in other countries (Italy, 
Switzerland, and Argentina) are using this modality. However this proposal will be the first attempt to perform a well -conducted clinical trial with emphasis on feasibility and 
efficacy i n a multi- institutional trial.  
 
There is an urgent need for the development of a prospective multi -institutional trial to test 
the feasibility of the technique in a cooperative group setting which may serve as a prelude to future studies with agents other than melphalan and more importantly help refine the 
delivery technique so the local toxicities can be minimized.

2.3 Assessment of Vision  
Historically and in a number of treating centers advanced unilateral retinoblastoma (Groups D/E) is managed with primary enucleation. As such any salvaged eye would have an 
improved visual acuity over controls.  
 
Objective testing of vision in pre -verbal children at baseline is possible with methods such 
as Teller visual acuity. This approach requires a specialty trained technician monitoring the response of a cooperative child, as various striped cards are presented to the infant. Given 
the need to patch the normal eye in a newly diagnosed infant with unilateral disease  many 
children will not be cooperative for this test and the measured acuity may be compromised. In some centers Teller vision assessment is not readily avail able and the quality of the 
technical support may vary. Requiring such a visual assessment at baseline may exclude some centers from participation or delay therapy from being initiated. Also the quality of data across institutions using this technique may render the results inconclusive.  
 Prior reports addressing vision in this cohort have looked at final visual acuity not the 
variance of vision from study entry to exit. In most cases the affected eye will present and 
remain amblyopic. The average age at study entrance will be 22- 23 months but this will 
range on average from 6 months to 4 years. On this study, we will be  assessing visual acuity  
once a year for 4 years, starting 1  year after completion of protocol therapy ; most children  
should be between 3-5 years of age.  
 Options for testing visual acuity in the 3- 5 year age range include: Snellen letters, Snellen 
numbers, Tumbling E, HOTV, and Allen figures. Each test is listed in decreasing order of 
cognitive difficulty. Given these criteria and age range we will be using the single surround 
HOTV – known as the amblyopia treatment study visual acuity protocol. The approach has 
been validated and has a high testability in 3 -7 year olds. It is standardized and has been 
used in multi -center trials for amblyopi a treatment.

Version Date: 03/ 30/[ADDRESS_1284217] prospective study of systematic assessment of histopathology features of eyes that are enucleated for pr ogression following IA therapy.  
 A previous retrospective study of 8 eyes treated with intra -arterial chemotherapy for 
retinoblastoma ha s shown ocular complications that include thromboembolic events. In 
this study the eyes were enucleated for tumor viabi lity, neovascular glaucoma, anaphylactic 
reaction from IAC, and persistent retinal detachment with poor vi sualization of the tumor .
18 
The tumor response  ranged  from minimal (n=1) to moderate (n=1) to extensive (n=4) to 
complete regression (n=2). Viable vitreous seeds (n=4 eyes), invasion into the optic nerve 
(n=3), reaching the lamina cribrosa in 2 cases, and invasion into the choroid (n=1) were 
observed. Histopathologic evidence of ischemic atrophy involving the outer retina and 
choroid was found in 4 eyes. One eye had extensive choroidal and outer retinal atrophy. 
This case showed orbital vascular occlusion and subendothelial smooth muscle 
hyperplasia. Intravascular birefringent foreign mater ial was observed in 5 cases within 
occluded vessels, stimulating a granulomatous inflammatory response. The foreign material comprised cellulose fibers (n=3), synthetic fabric fibers (n=1), or unknown 
composition (n=2). Thrombosed blood vessels were identi fied in 5 eyes and involved 
ciliary arteries in the retrobulbar orbit (n=5), scleral emissarial canals (n=1), small 
choroidal vessels (n=1), and central retinal artery (n=1 ).
[ADDRESS_1284218] be as signed a COG patient ID 
number.  
 
This number is obtained via the COG Registry  system  once authorization for the 
release of protected  health inform ation (PHI) has been obtained. The COG patient 
ID number is used to identify the patient in all  future interactions with COG. If you 
have problems with the registration, p lease refer to the online help.  
 
In order for an institution to maintain COG m embership requirements, every newly 
diagnosed patient needs to be offered participation in ACCRN07, Protocol for the 
Enrollment on the Official COG Registry, The Childhood Cancer Research Network (CCRN) , or APEC14B1 , Project:EveryChild  A Registry, Eligibility Screening, 
Biology and Outcome Study .  
 
A Biopathology Center (BPC) number will be assigned as part of the registration process. Each patient will be assigned only one BPC number per COG Patient ID.

4.1.[ADDRESS_1284237] reconstitution.  
 
Cerebral angiography in infants poses unique technical challenge, with potential risk of severe morbidity to both access and target vessels, as well as risk of possible severe 
neurological morbidity, arising quickly.  
 
Fastidious technique to reduce patient radiation exposure is particularly critical when 
treating infants with retinoblastoma, as the infant brain typi[INVESTIGATOR_913922] 50% of the incident skin radiation dose. Digital subtraction angiography exposes patients to a 
much higher radiation dose than do es live fluoroscopy. As such, formal angiographic 
runs should be minimized as much as possible, to a degree that is still consistent with safely performing the procedure and ensuring normal runoff to the brain and eye in 
all arterial branches. Roadmaps and live fluoroscopy are to be generally preferred.  
 For a unilateral treatment, a total skin dose of under 100 mGy (frontal and lateral planes summed) can be expected .  
 The procedure is performed under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.  
 
Oxym etazoline 0.05% (two sprays) is sprayed in the nostril on the treatment side, to 
reduce the blush from the nasal mucosa and risk of epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940].  
 
Phenylephrine hydrochloride 10%  ophthalmic solution  (two drops) may be spread over 
the skin of the forehead above the eye on the treatment side, to vasoconstrict the skin and reduce the risk of skin erythema. (optional) 
 
Heparin is administered intravenously at 70 International Units/Kg.  
 
Heparin is administered after femoral artery puncture at the time of microcatheter 
manipulation inside the arteries  
 
One femoral artery (alternatively right/left) is punctured with a 3F micropuncture system 
and a 3F femoral sheath is placed.  
 
A straight microcatheter such as a Marathon (EV3 Irvine, CA) or a Magic 1.5 (Balt , 
Montmorency, [LOCATION_009]) is advanced over a micro -guide wire such as the Mirage (EV3 
Irvine, CA) int o the internal carotid artery. A 4F guide catheter is usually not necessary. 
A cerebral angiogram is performed.  
 
The microcatheter is placed at the origin of  the ophthalmic artery, without catheterizing 
it. Then, imaging of the ophthalmic artery is performed to visualize the angioanatomy, the choroid blush, and that there is no reflux of contrast into the internal carotid. To minimize 
radiation exposure, this last imaging is performed by [CONTACT_913947].  
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ARET12P1 
Version Date: 03/ 30/16  Page 21 
If the ophthalmic artery is not appropriate for selective catheterization, one may 
catheterize the middle meningeal artery and perform a selective angiogram to find if the 
orbital branch is large enough for catheterization and intra- arterial injection .  
 
The chemotherapy drug should be prepared according to Section 6.1  prior to delivery of 
the medication to the angio suite under sterile conditions. The drug is then injected manually by [CONTACT_913948] –pulsatile injection - at a rate of 1 mL/minute.  
 
After completion of administration of the drug flush the catheter while still in place with 
0.[ADDRESS_1284238] ug delivery, another substracted fluoroscopy of the ophthalmic artery is 
performed; the microcatheter is pulled into the internal carotid artery and another internal carotid angiogram performed.  
 The microcatheter is removed, an ACT is performed and if <  2.[ADDRESS_1284239] procedure before 
being discharged home for observation.

Interventional Radiology Recording of First Injection  
Prior to the second injection , the central review of the interventional radiology 
recording taken after the first intra -arterial injection  must be completed and sent for 
central review. Review comments will be communicated to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_913923]. This is important, as the review may affect dose modifications for the second and third injection s (see Section 5.0
).

6.0 DRUG INFORMATION  
See the consent document for toxicities.  
6.1 MELPHALAN   - INTRA- ARTERIAL       (08/28/13)  
(L-phenylalanine mustard, phenylalanine mustard, L- PAM, L -sarcolysin,  Alkeran®) NSC #008806  
 
Source and Pharmacology:   
Melphalan, a phenylalanine derivative of nitrogen mustard, is a bifunctional alkylating agent. Melphalan 
forms covalent cross- links with DNA or DNA protein complexes thereby [CONTACT_913949], mutagenic, 
and carcinogenic effects. The end result of the alkylation process results in the misreading of the DNA code 
and the inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis in rapi[INVESTIGATOR_913924].  It is cell cycle 
non-specific. After IV administration, melphalan  plasma concentrations decline rapi[INVESTIGATOR_91590] a bi -exponential 
manner with distribution phase and terminal elimination phase half -lives of approximately [ADDRESS_1284245] appearance of m elphalan  in plasma (range approximately 0 to 6  hours) and to the 
peak plasma concentration achieved. These results may be due t o incomplete intestinal absorption, a 
variable "first pass" hepatic metabolism, or to rapid hydrolysis. The oral dose averages 61% ± 26% of that following IV administration. The terminal elimination plasma half -life of oral melphalan is 
1.5 ± 0.83 hours. T he steady -state volume of distribution of m elphalan is 0.5  L/kg. The extent of m elphalan  
binding to plasma proteins ranges from 60-90%. Melphalan  is eliminated  from plasma primarily by 
[CONTACT_913950]. The  24-hour urinary excretion 
of parent drug is approximately 10% suggesting that renal clearance is not a major route of elimination of parent drug. Penetration into CSF is low. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_913925], one pharmacokinetic study suggests dosage may need to be reduced 
in patients with renal impairment.

Formulation and Stability:   
Melphalan for Injection is supplied as a sterile, nonpyrogenic, freeze -dried powder. Each single -use vial 
contains melphalan  hydrochloride equivalent to 50 mg melphalan and 20 mg povidone. Melphalan for 
Injection is reconstituted using the sterile diluent provided. Each vial of ster ile diluent contains sodium 
citrate 0.2 g, propylene glycol 6.0 mL, ethanol (96%) 0.52 mL, and SWFI to a total of 10 mL. Store at 
controlled room temperature 15°-30°C (59°-86°F) and protect from light.  
 
Intra -arterial P reparation : 
• Using appropriate aseptic technique, r econstitute to a concentration of 5  mg/mL by [CONTACT_28423][INVESTIGATOR_913926] 10  mL of the supplied diluent directly into the vial of lyophilized powder using a sterile 
needle (20- gauge or larger needle diameter) and syringe. Immediately shake vial vi gorously until

(The time between reconstitution/dilution and administration of melphalan should be kept to a minimum 
because reconstituted and diluted solutions of melphalan are unstable. Over as short a time as 
30 minutes, a citrate derivative of m elphalan has been detected in reconstituted material from the 
reaction of melphalan with the sterile diluent for melphalan. Upon further dilution with saline, nearly 1% label strength of m elphalan hydrolyzes every 10  minutes.)   
 
Guidelines for Administration:  See Treatment  (Section 4.0)  and Dose Modifications
 (Section 5.0)  sections 
of the protocol.  
 
Patients should receive oxymetazoline 0.05% ( e.g., Afrin) two puffs into the nares on the side of the 
procedure—prior to the procedure to reduce blushing.  
 
The drug is then injected manually by [CONTACT_913948] –pulsatile injection - at a rate of 1 mL/minute . 
The injection must be completed within [ADDRESS_1284247] reconstitution.

 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ARET12P1 
Version Date: 03/ 30/[ADDRESS_1284259]  24 patients per year will be enrolled with disease characteristics and organ 
function that meet the eligibility criteria for the protocol.  Thirty -one (31) eligible and feasibility -
evaluable patients will be required in order to apply the statistical rules described below. 
Accounting for the possibility that 10% of patients will be either inevaluable or ineligible, we will 
enroll up to 34 patie nts. At the time of the amendment of the study design, 10 patients were enrolled; 
none were identified as inevaluable for the primary endpoint according to the definition in the 
amended protocol. We estimate enrollment can be concluded within [ADDRESS_1284260] stage of the 
Study Design . 
 
9.2 Study Design  
The primary goal of this trial is to determine the feasibility of delivering melphalan directly into the ophthalmic artery.  
 
Feasibility Outcome: Intra -arterial (IA) feasibility will be assessed over the [ADDRESS_1284261] experienced IA therapy feasibility failure 
if: a) the intervention al radiologist is not able to access the ophthalmic artery for chemotherapy 
administrations during the first three cycles of therapy; b) patient develops central r etinal artery 
occlusion after the first or second cycle that does  not reopen by [CONTACT_913953]; 
or c) the patient cannot receive all three treatments with IA therapy because of CTC AE 
complications Grade III or IV that are considered possibly, probably or likely related treatment.   
 
Evaluability for Feasibility Outcome: Any patient who does not experience IA feasibility failure 
event and is removed from protocol therapy prior to the third IA injection because: (1) the physician 
stops pr otocol therapy in the best interests of the patient; (2) the parent or guardian refuses further 
therapy; (3) disease is found in the contralateral eye; or (4) the patient does not qualify because repeat eligibility studies are outside enrollment requirements will be considered inevaluable for the 
primary outcome measure and replaced for evaluation of the primary goal . All other patients will 
be considered evaluable for the primary endpoint. Each patient will require , at most , 4 months to 
complete the feasib ility evaluation. Any feasibility evaluable patient who does not experience 
feasibility failure will be considered a feasibility success.  
 
Design for the Primary Outcome Measure: Feasibility will be eval uated using a two- stage design.  
 Cumulative Number of 
Feasibility Successes  Decision  
Stage 1: Enter 12 feasibility 
evaluable patients  8 or fewer Terminate the trial because the 
therapy is considered not feasible 
to deliver.  
 9 or more  Proceed to Stage 2.  
Stage 2: Enter 19 additional 
feasibility evaluable 
patients  25 or fewer  Terminate the trial with the 
conclusion the therapy is 
considered not feasible to deliver.  
 26 or more Terminate the trial because the 
therapy is considered feasible to 
deliver.

Version Date: 03/ 30/16  Page 33 
 
 
If the true feasibility failure rate is 28%, the regimen will be identified as not feasible to  deliver with 
probability 91%. If the true feasibility failure rate is 10%, the regimen will be identified as feasible to 
deliver with probability 90%. 
 
Assessment of Ocular Salvage Ocular Salvage: Ocular salvage will be assessed over the [ADDRESS_1284262] 
to follow -up or for whom follow -up is terminated electively prior to 2 years by [CONTACT_913954].  
 
The primary analyti c endpoint of this trial will be feasibil ity of delivery of IA therapy. The accrual target 
for this study will not be adjusted for the number of patients considered not evaluable for the ocular salvage endpoint. 
Design for Ocular Salvage Assessment: Interi m assessment of this aim will not be done since the salvage 
endpoint could require [ADDRESS_1284263] ocular salvage (observed salvage rate 32%), we will consider the therapy to 
have an insufficient ocular salvage probability; otherwise, the data will be considered of sufficient inte rest Probability of Acceptance

Assessment of the Need for Systemic Chemotherapy  
 
Systemic Chemotherapy Administration: The need to administer systemic chemotherapy because of 
progressive disease in the eye considered for IA melphalan feasibility will be assessed over the [ADDRESS_1284266] to follow- up 
or for whom follow -up is terminated electively prior to 2 years by [CONTACT_913955].  
Design for Assessing the Need for Systemic Chemotherapy: Interim assessment of this aim will not be done 
since the salvage endpoint could require [ADDRESS_1284267] been enrolled.  If all 31 such patients are evaluable for ocular salvage, the foll owing 
design will be employed. If 19 or more patients require systemic chemotherapy (observed frequency 61% ), 
we will consider the therapy to have an insufficient freedom from systemic chemotherapy probability; 
otherwise, the data will be considered of sufficient interest with respect to freedom from systemic chemotherapy for further investigation. If the true probability of freedom from chemotherapy is 0.50, the 
therapy will be considered of sufficient interest with respect to this endpoint  with probability 9 3%. If the 
true probability of the need for systemic chemotherapy is 0.75, the therapy will be considered not of sufficient interest for this endpoint with probability 94%. If, at any time, [ADDRESS_1284268] 90% when the true

Assessment of Rate of Metastases of Retinoblastoma 
Metastatic Disease Failure : Patients will be considered for the evaluation of metastatic disease provided 
the individual receives at least [ADDRESS_1284270].  The new finding of 
extraocular disease after the initiation of protocol therapy will be considered metastatic disease failure.  
Appearanc e of intraocular tumor in the other eye either during or after protocol therapy will not be 
considered metastatic disease. Appearance of an isolated pi[INVESTIGATOR_913928] a young patient with a genetic 
predisposition to developi[INVESTIGATOR_913929]/trilateral retinoblastoma.     
 
Design for Assessing Rate of Metastatic Disease Incidence: The primary analytic endpoint of this trial will 
be feasibi lity of delivery of IA therapy. The accrual target for this study will not be adjusted for the number 
of patients considered not evaluable for the metastatic disease endpoint.  
The probability of metastatic disease will be assessed after [ADDRESS_1284271] bee n 
enrolled. If all 31 such patients are evaluable for metastatic disease incidence, the foll owing design will be 
employed. If 1 or fewer patients experience metastatic disease, (observed rate of metastatic disease 
incidence: 3.2%), we will consider the therapy to have a sufficiently low rate of metastatic disease to be 
considered for further evaluation; otherwise, the data will be considered indicative of an excessi ve rate of 
metastatic disease. If the true rate of metastases is 0.10, the therapy will be considered of to have an 
excessive rate of metastases probability 83%. If the true rate of metastases is 0.03, the therapy will be considered have a sufficiently low rate of m etastases with probability 76%.  If, at any time, [ADDRESS_1284272] 80% when the 
true probability of metastatic disease  is 10%. Examples of such adjustments are provided in the following

Evaluation of the effects of intra -arterial therapy on the histopathology of eyes enucleated for progression : 
The monitoring rule for ocular salvage will limit the number of eyes available for evaluation. We project a 
maximum of 25 eyes will be availab le for evaluation. As noted in Section 2.0 , various characteristics such 
as viable vitreous seeds and invasion into the optic nerve were observed. In previous examinations there 
has also been evidence of ischemic atrophy involving the outer retina and choroid as well as extensive 
choroidal and outer retinal atrophy. The proportion of enucleated eyes with each of these various 
characteristics will be calculated, as well as the 95% confidence intervals. The expected size of the 
confidence intervals, as a function of the number of eyes available and relative f requency of the particular 
characteristic.

Monitoring for complications of catheter insertion:  
The analytic unit for this outcome is the patient- catheter insertion. Each time a catheter insertion procedure 
is performed, the patient will be monitored for the subsequent 48 hours for the occurrence of any of the 
following complications: (1) thrombosis of the femoral artery; (2) dissection of any artery; (3) hematoma 
at the site of insertion of 3 centimeters or more in diameter; (4) emboli cerebral; or (5) any embolus in the 
lower extremity that results in vascular insufficiency. If any of these [ADDRESS_1284276] occurred. Otherwise, the  patient will be considered free of catheter events for that 
particular insertion. 
 
A Bayesian monitoring rule will be used to assess the consistency of the data with a catheter event rate that 
does not exceed 20% with high probability . Each analytic unit will be considered independent of all other 
analytic units. A beta prior with α=0.2 and β=0.8 to represent that the maximum complication rate 
considered acceptable as 20% with a substantial standard deviation to quantify the uncertainty regarding the complication rate. At each review of the study data where [ADDRESS_1284277] occurred, the posterior probability of an excessive complication rate will be calculated as:

11.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS   
11.1 Purpose  
Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical 
trial, are done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who 
will enroll in future studies using similar agents .  
 
11.2 Determination of Reporting Requirements  
Reporting requirements may include the following considerations: 1) the characteristics of 
the adverse event including the grade (severity) ; 2) the relationship to the study therapy  
(attribution); and 3) the pri or experience (expectedness) of the adverse event . 
  
Commercial agents are those agents not provided under an IND but obtained instead from 
a commercial source. In some cases an agent obtained commercially may be used for indications not included in the package label. In addition, NCI may on some occasions distribute commercial supplies for a trial. Even in these cases, the agent is still considered 
to be a commercial agent and the procedures described below should be followed. 
 
Determine the prior experien ce Expected events are those that have been previously 
identified as resulting from administration of the agent.  An adverse event is considered 
unexpected, for reporting purposes only, when either the type of event or the severity of 
the event is not liste d in:  
• The current known toxicities for each commercial agent as provided in the 
Drug Information for Commercial Agents Used by [CONTACT_2005]’s Oncology 
Grou p posted on the COG website; or 
• The drug package insert  
 
 Secondary Malignancy  
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous malignancy (eg, 
treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A metastasis of the initial neoplasm is not considered a secondary malignancy.  
 
All secondar y malignancies that occur following treatment need to be reported via CTEP -
AERS . Three options are available to describe the event:  
• Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy.  
• Myelodysplastic syndrome  
• Treatment related secondary malignancy  
 
11.[ADDRESS_1284280] 
 
Commercial reporting requirements are provided in Table B. The commercial agent(s) used 
in this study are listed in the front of this protocol immediately following the Study 
Committee roster.   
 
• COG requires the CTEP -AERS  report to be submitted within 7 calendar  days  of 
learning of the event.  
• Use the NCI protocol number and the protocol -specific patient ID provided 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ARET12P1 
Version Date: 03/ 30/16  Page 41 
during trial registration on all reports.  
 
CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:   The descriptions and grading scales found 
in the NCI Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will 
be utilized for AE reporting and are located on the CTEP website at:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm .  All 
appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE.  
 
Table B  
Reporting requirements for adverse events experienced by [CONTACT_913958].  
 
CTEP -AERS  Reporting Requirements for Adverse Events That Occur During 
Therapy With a Commercial Agent or Within [ADDRESS_1284281] dose of treatment with a commercial agent which can 
be attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the agent and is not  due to 
cancer recurrence must be reported via CTEP -AERS . 
 
11.4 Routine Adv erse Event Reporting  
Note:  The guidelines below are for routine reporting of study specific adverse events on 
the COG case report forms and do not affect the requirements for CTEP- AERS  reporting. 
 
The NCI defines both routine and expedited AE reporting.  Routine reporting is 
accomplished via the Adverse Event (AE) Case Report Form (CRF) within the study

14.0 IMAGING STUDIES REQUIRED AND GUIDELINES FOR OBTAINING   
Timing of protocol therapy administration, response assessment studies, and surgical 
interventions are based on schedules derived from the experimental design or on established 
standards of care. Minor  unavoidable departures (up to 72 hours) from protocol directed therapy 
and/or disease evaluations (and up to 1 week for surgery) for valid clinical, patient and family 
logistical, or facility, procedure and/or anesthesia scheduling issues are acceptable p er COG 
administrative Policy 5.14 (except where explicitly prohibited within the protocol).

15.0 GUIDELINES FOR RADIOACTIVE PLAQUE TREATMENT  
Timing of protocol therapy administration, response assessment studies, and surgical 
interventions are based on schedules derived from the experimental design or on established 
standards of care. Minor unavoidable departures (up to 72 hours) from  protocol directed therapy 
and/or disease evaluations (and up to 1 week for surgery) for valid clinical, patient and family 
logistical, or facility, procedure and/or anesthesia scheduling issues are acceptable per COG 
administrative Policy 5.14 (except whe re explicitly prohibited within the protocol).  
 
Radiation t herapy  (RT)  for patients on COG protocols can only be delivered at approved 
COG RT facilities (per COG administrative policy 3.9).  
 
No external beam radiation therapy including intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), stereotactic radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery,  or proton beam therapy is permitted on this 
protocol. Plaque brachytherapy is the only radiotherapy permitted by [CONTACT_990].   
For eyes that fail protocol therapy by [CONTACT_913959] 10.[ADDRESS_1284288] local ophthalmic therapy (any included in 
Section 16 ) or systemic chemotherapy (whichever was later) and the start of plaque 
radiotherapy 
15.[ADDRESS_1284289] 1 – 2 mm on all sides. (For example, a tumor with a basal 
diameter of [ADDRESS_1284290] 12-14 mm in diameter.)  
An exception is permissible if the tumor is < 2 mm of the optic nerve. In this case, the 
plaque may be trimmed (or “notched”) around the optic nerve so that the posterior edge of 
the plaque lies between the optic nerve and the posterior edge of the tumor.  
15.[ADDRESS_1284291] be > 0.4 Gy/h but < 0.8 Gy/h. 
 Three dimensional (3D) treatment planning is encouraged. International Commision on 
Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) Reports 50, 62, and 72 ( www.icru.org
) define 
prescription methods and nomenclature that will be utilized for this study. Imaging studies for this protocol must have slice thicknesses of 1 mm or less. Treatment planning will be 
based on the following definitions: 
 
Gross target volume (GTV)  is the volume of disease seen on planning imaging studies.  
 Clinical target volume (CTV)  is equal to the GTV  
 
Planning target volume (PTV)  is equal to CTV.

Version Date: 03/ 30/16  Page 46 
 
If two dimensional (2D) treatment planning is employed, the thickness of the tumor is 
defined as the distance from the interior surface of the sclera to the apex of the tumor. The 
sclera is assumed to be 1 mm thick.  Thus, if a tumor is said to be 3 mm thick, the point of 
dose prescription is 4 mm from the surface of the radioactive plaque, i.e. 3 mm thick tumor 
+ 1 mm thick sclera = [ADDRESS_1284292] from the external surface of the sclera, i.e. 3 
mm thick tumor + 1 mm thick sclera + 1 mm muscle thickness = 5 mm. If overlying 
vitreous seeds are present, the dose is designed to include those seeds.  
 
The prescription dose to the tumor apex is 36 Gy  and will serve as the prescription 
dose for this protocol for both 2 D and 3D treatment planning.  
 
This dose, with allowance for minor deviations of up to 10%  or up to 39.6 Gy, has 
supportive data for safety in salvaged eyes in multiple series .

15.5 Normal tissue dosimetry  
The organs at risk guidelines in this section are recommendations. If the recommended 
doses to the org ans at risk are exceeded because of target volume coverage requirements 
or other conditions, and explanation should be included in the quality assurance documentation.

15.5.2 For 2D treatment planning the following define required  
Sclera 
The dose to the sclera is estimated and reported at a point on the central axis of the 
plaque 1 mm from the surface of the plaque. This point is approximately coincident 
with the internal surface of the sclera near the center of the tumor.  
 
Optic nerve   
The dose to the center of the optic disc is calculated and rep orted.  
 
Contralateral Retina  (same eye)  
The dose to the retina opposite the tumor is calculated and reported. The dose is 
calculated 16 mm from the scleral surface at the base of the tumor measured along 
a diameter of the globe passing through the apex of  the tumor for infants ≤ 6 
months of age and 20 mm for patients > 6 months of age.  
Lens  
The dose to the center of the lens is calculated and reported.  
 
15.6 QA Documentation  
No on- treatment review will be required for this protocol. It is recognized that the dose 
distribution from brachytherapy implants is inherently non-uniform. 
 
15.6.1 Institutions are required to submit the treatment plan in digital format.

16.0 OPHTHALMOLOGIC GUIDELINES  
16.1 Local T herapy  
Local therapy is used to eradicate local disease after reduction of the tumor volume by 
[CONTACT_913961], green laser, infrared laser and/or radioactive 
plaque. See Section 15.[ADDRESS_1284294] cycle of IA  
melphalan , for ablating tumor remnants/recurrences after protocol therapy  up to [ADDRESS_1284295] be completely enclosed by [CONTACT_913962]. If the lesion has an extensive 
base, part of the lesion (up to 4 sites) may be frozen in one sessio n and then the 
additional part of the lesion at a later session with next EUA. It is recommended that no more than 4 different sites be frozen in one eye at a single session. The only 
acceptable regression patterns following cryotherapy are either flat cho rioretinal 
scars or chorioretinal scars with a central calcific deposit; achieving this may require multiple treatments. There is less likelihood of creating vitreous seeds with 
cryotherapy if a tumor has been previously treated with chemotherapy. Extensiv e 
cryotherapy has been associated with significant persistent retinal detachment, particularly if the retina was originally detached prior to chemotherapy. Retinal breaks can be caused by [CONTACT_913963]. Including calcified Type I regression in the ice 
ball s hould be avoided if possible. The site of transition between the retina and the 
calcific mass is at risk to develop a retinal break following cryotherapy.  
 
16.1.2 Green Laser Photoablation  
After cycle one of IA melphalan , green laser (argon or 532 nm) can be used to ablate  
tumors up to [ADDRESS_1284296] 
ophthalmoscopy (the 28D indirect lens gives a larger laser spot on the lesion than 
the 20D lens), at a low energy output, increasing the power by 50 mW increments 
until “blanching” or gentle “whitening” of the tumor occurs. This end- point is 
established at the edge of the tumor with a portion of the spot on the normal retina. Begin with a power of 200 -300 mW and do not exceed 700 mW or 1000 mse c. 
 
The tumor is outlined with burns half on and half off the retina. There should be 30% 
spot overlap. After outlining the tumor, the entire tumor should be covered with 30 
% overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_913934]. The “take” may not be obvious in thicker parts of the tumor. 
Complete coverage is considered “1 laser treatment”. Each numbered lesion should receive a minimum of 3 complete “laser treatments” with only one “complete laser 
treatment” given at each EUA.  
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY  ARET12P1 
Version Date: 03/ 30/16  Page 50 
The response to laser energy depends to a large extent on the amount of pi[INVESTIGATOR_913935]. In patients with significant pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], 
relatively little energy is needed to achieve end -point. Within pi[INVESTIGATOR_913936], the 
uptake of energy varies with the amount of pi[INVESTIGATOR_913937]. In lightly pi[INVESTIGATOR_913938], more energy is required to achieve 
end point. Small hemorrhages may occur within tumors.  
 
The immediate response to the green laser is whitening of the retina and tumor. 
Reduced volume and increased translucency of the tumor is considered a good 
outcome response, but a flat scar with pi[INVESTIGATOR_913939]. Several laser sessions may be required to achieve this. The green laser used with excessive power might cause hemorrhage or  breaks in Bruch’s membrane. Laser -
induced hemorrhage has been associated with vitreous seeding. Inadequate dilation of the pupil can cause laser burns to the iris.  
 
16.1.[ADDRESS_1284297] ophthalmoscope deli very 
system, a spot size ≥ 1000 -2000 µ is applied directly to the tumor. Starting with a 
low power at 1- second durations, the power or time is gradually increased until a 
slight whitening is observed, which is then applied to the entire surface of the tumor. 
Do not exceed 800 MW in power. Although very little response may be seen acutely 
with the infrared laser, subsequent observations will show a decrease in tumor 
volume with good response. Complete response often results in a residual flat mass, with a white, gliotic appearance, devoid of tum or vessels. This response may be very 
difficult to interpret and the activity can only be judged by [CONTACT_913964]. The use of excessive power may result in hemorrhage or vitreous dissemination of 
tumor, but starting with low power and gradually inc reasing avoids these problems.  
 
16.1.4 Plaque Radiotherapy 
Plaque radiotherapy may be used to treat local recurrences up to 8 mm in thickness 
and 15 mm in base. See Section 15.0 for guidelines. Proliferative r etinopathy 
secondary to plaque will be monitored on this study, with an early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_913940] > 15 % (See

Grossing Eyes: General Principles and Technique  
 The P-O Segment  
Routinely, histologic sections of eyes are cut from a paraffin block that includes a short cylindrical  
anteroposterior segment of the globe called the P-O or pupil -optic nerve segment. The P-O segment  
includes most of the cornea, iris and pupil anteriorly and the optic nerve posteriorly (Figure 1 & 3). 
 
The Calottes 
The dome- shaped caps of tissue that are removed when the P -O segment is prepared are called calottes  
(French for visor -less cap). The first calotte should include about one-fourth or one -fifth of the 
peripheral anterior chamber. The first calotte should also include the scleral window if one has been 
performed (Figure 1& 3). 
 
Standard Measurements 
Before the globe is opened, a standard series of measurements are made using a caliper o r a millimeter 
rule. The A -P (anteroposterior including the cornea) and the horizontal and vertical dimensions 
(viewed from the front) are measured and recorded in that order. The length of the attached 
segment of optic nerve is also recorded. The horizont al and vertical diameter of the cornea and the 
diameter of the pupil also are recorded (Figure 2). The iris color is also noted.

During the initial cut (removal of the first calotte), the eye is placed corneal side -down on the cutting 
block and steadied with the non- dominant hand. Guidelines drawn on the eye with colored pencil 
facilitate sectioning and help to assure that the eye is oriented properly prior to sectioning. The incision 
is started posteriorly and extended anteriorly. At the start of the incision, the blade is positi oned close to 
the optic nerve, but external to its dural sheath. A gentle sawing motion is used. Try not to bend the blade during sectioning. In addition, care must be taken to avoid compressing the eye too forcefully, as this can collapse the eye and expr ess the tumor and intraocular contents. The cut should enter the 
periphery of the anterior chamber anteriorly. The first calotte should include about one -fifth to one -
fourth of th e peripheral anterior chamber (F igure 3A).

It is extremely important to examine the residual tissue in the calottes to exclude uveal stromal 
invasion that may not be evident grossly. 
Both calottes should  be sectioned in a “breadloaf” fashion and submitted entirely (Figure 3E- F). 
If a significant amount of tumor is present in a calotte, one may choose to prepare an addition A- P 
segment of the entire globe prior to preparing the breadloafed segments.

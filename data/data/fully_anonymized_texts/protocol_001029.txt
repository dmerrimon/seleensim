Title of Study: An Open-Label, Non -Randomized, Multicenter Study to Determine the Pharmacokinetics and 
Safety of Niraparib Following a Single Oral Dose in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors and Either Normal 
Hepatic Function  or Moderate Hepatic Impairment  
Study Center(s): Multi-Center 
Principal Investigator:  , MD 
Studied Period (years):  
Estimated date first patient enrolled: January [ADDRESS_79850] patient completed: November 2018  Phase of Development: 1 
 
Objectives:  
Primary: 
• To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of niraparib and its major metabolite (M1) when 
administered as a single dose in cancer patients with normal hepatic function compared to patients with moderate hepatic impairment.  
Secondary:  
• To evaluate the safety of niraparib when administered as a single dose in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. 
• To obtain additional safety data through the exte nsion phase, in which patients have the option to 
continue receiving niraparib.  
Rationale for Study:  
Niraparib  (ZEJULA ®) is extensively metabolized and eliminated primarily by [CONTACT_73532]. The 
purpose of this study is to evaluate pharmacokinetics and safety of niraparib in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, for the purpose of providing recommendations  to guide the initial dose and dose titration in this 
patient population.  
Methodology:  
This is a Phase 1, open -label, parallel -group, single -dose study in patients with advanced solid tumors and with 
either normal hepatic function  or moderate hepatic imp airment. 
Patients with solid tumors will be recruited and enrolled within the following groups:  
• Group 1: normal hepatic function (total bilirubin [BILI] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST] ≤ upper limit of normal [ULN])  
• Group 2: moderate hepatic impairmen t (BILI >1.5 × to 3 × ULN) and any degree of AST elevation  
PK Phase  
[COMPANY_003]
Niraparib    
Clinical Stud y Protocol 3000-01-003 Amendment 2 
 
Confidential  Page 5 of 71 All patients will receive a single dose of 300 mg niraparib administered as 3 × 100 mg capsules on Day 1. 
Patients will undergo PK sampling up to 168 hours (7 days) following niraparib administration. Pharmacokinetic parameters to be calculated include area under the concentration × time curve calculated to last 
measured concentration  (AUC
0-t), area under the concentration × time curve calculated to infinity  (AUC0-∞), 
maximum concentration  (Cmax), time to maximum concentration ( tmax), terminal half -life (t½), and apparent total 
clearance ( CL/F). Protein binding parameters to be calculated include fraction of unbound drug ( Fu) and 
clearance of free drug (CLfu/F ). The study will be considered  complete when the final PK evaluable patient 
completes all assessments in the PK phase of the study.  
Safety will be assessed through adverse event assessment, physical examination, vital sign measurements, 
clinical laboratory tests , and monitoring of concomitant medications.  
AEs are required to be captured through 30 days after cessation of study treatment; SAEs are required to be captured through 90 days after cessation of study treatment (or to a minimum of [ADDRESS_79851] -treatment if the 
patient starts a lternative anticancer therapy); and any pregnancies that occur within [ADDRESS_79852] (AESIs) will be collected via 
telephone every 90 ± [ADDRESS_79853] returned to baseline or normalized, until there is a 
satisfactory  explanation for the change(s) observed, until the patient is lost to follow -up or withdraws consent, 
or until the patient has died.  
Extension Phase  
On the same day that patients complete the final study assessments for the PK phase, patients may be eligible to 
continue receiving niraparib in the extension phase of the study, if the investigator believes it is in the best clinical interest of the patient. Patients will receive their first therapeutic dose of niraparib on Cycle 1/Day 1 of 
the extension phase. Patients will return to the study center during Cycle 1 on Days 8, 15, and 21 to undergo 
safety assessments (including complete blood counts [ CBCs]). Thereafter, patients will return on the first day of 
every treatment cycle (28 ±3 days) to receive study  drug and for safety assessments (including CBCs). Dose 
modification (dose interruption and/or reduction) may be implemented for any grade toxicity considered intolerable by [CONTACT_102], and must be implemented for any Common Terminology Criteria for Adver se Events 
(CTCAE) Grade 3 or 4 non -hematologic adverse event considered by [CONTACT_73533]. Patients may continue in the extension phase until disease progression (assessed  by [CONTACT_16622]  [RECIST] v1.1 and clinical 
signs and symptoms ), unacceptable toxicity, death or discontinuation from the study treatment for any other 
reason. Patien ts in the extension phase will be monitored for AEs, SAEs, and AESIs  according to the same 
schedule as the PK phase. At end of study (EOS), safety assessments will be completed. No new capsules will 
be dispensed at EOS. 
Number of Patients (planned):  16 patients (PK -evaluable)  
Normal hepatic function (Group 1): 8 patients (PK -evaluable)  
Moderate hepatic impairment (Group 2): 8 patients (PK -evaluable)  
Patients may be replaced until there are 8 PK evaluable patients i n each group  of the study.

results, and monitoring of concomitant medications.  
Statistical Methods: 
A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be issued as a separate document, providing detailed methods for the 
safety analyses outli ned in this section. Any deviations from the planned analyses will be described and justified 
in the final integrated clinical study report (CSR).  
Study completion status will be summarized for all patients. Categories summarized will include those patients who were screened, enrolled, completed the study, or discontinued early (including reason for discontinuation).  
Demographic characteristics of all patients enrolled will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_73538], sex, race, height, and weight.

5.1. Background of Niraparib  
Niraparib (ZEJULA ®) is a poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP]- ribose polymerase)  (PARP) 
inhibitor indicated for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_12248], fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916], or primary peritoneal cancer who are in a complete or partial response to 
platinum-based chemotherapy. Niraparib received FDA approval in March 2017. For more 
details, refer to ZEJULA® label.[ADDRESS_79879] shown that niraparib-induced cytotoxicity may involve inhibition of PARP 
enzymatic activity and increased formation of PARP -deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA) complexes 
resulting in DNA damage, apoptosis and cell death. Increased niraparib-induced cytotoxicity was 
observed in tumor cell lines with or without deficiencies in BRCA1/2. Niraparib decreased tumor 
growth in mouse xenograft models of human cancer cell lines with deficiencies in BRCA1/2 and 
in human patient-derived xenograft tumor models with homologous recombination deficiency 
that had either mutated or wild type BRCA1/2. 
Niraparib co-crystallized with the human PARP-1 catalytic domain and w as shown to inhibi t 
PARP-1 and PARP -2 activity in  vitro with an inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of 3.[ADDRESS_79880], as a sensitizing 
agent in combination with cytotoxic agents and radiotherapy, and in combination with immune-oncology biologics.  
Nonclinical data, including cell-derived and patient- derived xenograph studies demonstrating 
response to niraparib in both BRCA mutated (gBRCAmut) and BRCA wild -type (gBRCAwt) 
tumors, are discussed in detail in the Investigator ’s Brochure (IB).  
There are 3 ongoing Phase 3 niraparib studies, Study PR-30-5010- C (BRAVO), 
Study PR -30-5017-C (PRIMA), and Study PR- 30-5011-C (NOVA). There is A also 1 ongoing 
Phase 1/2 study, Study 3000-PN162-01-001 (TOPACIO) and 1 ongoing Phase 2 study, Study 
PR-30-5020- C (QUADRA).  
The ENGOT -OV16/NOV A study
4 is a double-blind, 2:1 (ni raparib:placebo) randomized, 
placebo-controlled study of maintenance t reatment with ni raparib compared with placebo in 
patients with platinum- se nsitive ovarian cancer who have r eceived at least [ADDRESS_79881] no m easurable disease >2 cm and 
normal cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) (or >90% d ecrease) following their last treatment. There 
were [ADDRESS_79882] a tumor with high-grade serous histology but without g BRCAmut (non-
gBRCAmut). Patients in the non- g BRCAmut cohort are further characterized by [CONTACT_73542] (positive or negative). 
A total of [ADDRESS_79883] 
negative (HRDneg). HRD status was not determined (HRDnd) for 54 patients.  
Demographic and baseline characteristics were well -balanced.  
Table 3 shows the results for the PFS primary endpoint for each of the 3 primary efficacy 
populations (ie, g BRCAmut cohort, HRDpos cohort, and overall non-gBRCAmut cohort). In 
addition, median PFS in patients with HRD negative (HRDneg) tumors was 6.9 months (95% CI: 5.6, 9.6) in the niraparib arm compared to 3.8 months (95% CI: 3.7, 5.6) in the placebo arm with an HR of 0.58 (95% CI: 0.361, 0.922) (p=0.0226).

Progression -free survival is defined as the time in months from the date of randomization to progression or 
death. 
The primary data to support the safety of treatment with niraparib in this proposed indication are 
derived from the ENGOT-OV16/NOVA main study in which a total of 546 patients received 
study treatment. Safety presentations for the NOVA study are derived from the analyses included in the clinical study report and include comparisons of the safety profile of niraparib 
maintenance treatment versus placebo in women with platinum- sensitive recurrent ovarian 
cancer. 
All patients who received niraparib and 171 (96%) of [ADDRESS_79885] 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE). The high rate of TEAEs in the 
placebo group indicates the burden of prior chemotherapy and the patient’s underlying ovarian 
cancer. Review of the data across study cohorts for TEAE incidence showed that, in general,  the 
results were similar in the g BRCAmut and non-g BRCAmut cohorts. In the overall safety 
population, for the niraparib versus placebo treatment arms, the incidences of Grade 3/4 TEAEs (74% vs 23%), serious adverse events (SAEs) (30% vs 15%), TEAEs leading to treatment 
interruption (69% vs 5%), TEAEs leading to dose reduction (67% vs 15%), and TEAEs leading 
to treatment discontinuation (15% vs 2%) were higher for niraparib. There were no on- treatment 
deaths reported. The incidence of myelodysplastic syndrom e (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia 
(AML) in patients who received niraparib (5 of 367; 1.4%) was similar to the incidence in patients who received placebo (2 of 179; 1.1%). MDS/AML and secondary cancers (new malignancies other than MDS or AML) are potential risks of PARP inhibitors.  
Niraparib    
Clinical Stud y Protocol 3000-01-003 Amendment 2 
 
Confidential  Page 23 of 71 The selection of the 300 mg starting dose of niraparib for the phase 3 r andomized double-blind 
trial of maintenance with niraparib versus placebo in the ENGOT -OV16/NOVA study was based 
on data from the Phase 1 MAD study PN001  conducted by [CONTACT_44873] & Co. There were no formal 
Phase 2 dose-ranging studies conducted. The Phase 1 study included both a dose escalation 
phase to determine the maximal tolerated dose and an expansion arm to further evaluate the 
selected dose. A total of 104 patients with advanced solid tumors were evaluated in this study, including 60 during dose escalation from 30 mg to 400 mg and 54 during expansion at the 300 mg dose level. The dose escalation stage determined that 400 mg exceeded the maximal tolerated 
dose (by [CONTACT_73543]-limiting toxicity evaluations and by [CONTACT_73544]). No dose- limiting toxicities were observed at 290 or 300 mg dose l evels. In the Phase 
3 study, daily niraparib improved progression-free survival (PFS) in a cohort of patients with 
gBRCA mutation as well as in a cohort of patients without g BRCA mutation. Within the 
gBRCAmut cohort, the median PFS was 21.0 months in patients on niraparib versus 5.5 months 
on placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.27; p < 0.0001). In recurrent ovarian cancer patients, efficacy was assessed in patients with HRD -positive tumors as identified by [CONTACT_73545]’s myChoice 
HRD test as well in the overall no n-gBRCA mutation cohort regardless of HRD status. As 
observed in the g BRCAmut cohort, PFS was significantly longer with niraparib in the 
homologous recombination deficient-positive group of the non-g BRCAmut (without germline 
BRCA mutation) cohort (median, 12.9 months vs 3.8 months; HR, 0.38; p < 0.0001). Lastly, PFS 
was significantly improved in the overall non-g BRCAmut cohort (median, 9.3 months vs 
3.9 months; HR, 0.45; p < 0.0001). Secondary endpoints, including chemotherapy- free interval, 
time to first s ubsequent therapy (TFST), and progression-free survival 2 (PFS2), confirmed the 
PFS benefit of niraparib treatment in both cohorts. This provides compelling evidence that 
niraparib does not diminish responsiveness to subsequent therapy and that the nirapar ib treatment 
effect persists. Subsequently in 2017, a recommendation to consider niraparib maintenance 
therapy in this setting in cases of CR and PR was added to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN) guidelines.
[ADDRESS_79886] commonly observed non- hematologic treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of 
any National Cancer Institute - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-
CTCAE) grade were nausea, fatigue, constipation, and vomiting; the majority of the non-
hematologic TEAEs were mild to moderate in severity. The most commonly observed 
hematologic TEAEs (any grade) were anemia (48.5%), thrombocytopenia 66.2%), and neutropenia (31.4 %).  
TEAEs leading to treatment interruption, reduction or discontinuation were 68.9%, 66.5% and 14.7% respectively. Approximately 50% of patients required dose interruption during the first 
month of niraparib therapy, and 47% required dose reduction during the second month of 
therapy. Most patients achieved their individual maximal tolerated dose  by [CONTACT_73546]. The 
average dose of niraparib during the study was 206 mg. After Month 3 or 4, new incident s of 
thrombocytopenia w ere reported in < 1% of patients. Although Grade 3 or 4 hematologic 
laboratory events were common at the initiation of treatment, no severe clinical sequelae were observed, and relatively few patients discontinued due to these AEs (discontinuation rate was 
3.3% for thrombocytopenia, 1.4% for anemia and 1.9% for neutropenia). Dose adjustment based 
on individual tolerability during the first [ADDRESS_79887] decreased efficacy relative to those who remain at the 300  mg starting dose.  
These data support that each patient has an optimal benefit /risk at their individualized dose. As 
lower doses are associated with substantial improvements in the incidence of TEAEs while not 
appearing to compromise efficacy, approaches to quickly transition patients to their 
individualized optimal dose , particularly patients at the highest risk of grade 3 or 4 
thrombocytopenia in cycle 1were further evaluated . In addition, an exploratory analysis was 
conducted to determine if risk factors could be identified for a subgroup of pati ents which were 
associated with higher rates of hematologic toxicity.  In the updated analysis, two factors were 
identified as being associated  with thrombocytopenia, baseline platelet count and baseline body 
weight. 
For a complete discussion on the activity and safety of niraparib, refer to the Investigator’s Brochure.  
5.2. Niraparib Metabolism  
In a dose escalation study in cancer patients (PN001), niraparib exhibited linear PK, and dose- 
proportional exposure (AUC and C max). Moreover, the consistent t max and t½ across the range of 
doses evaluated (30-400 mg) suggest overall dose-independent absorption and clearance. 
Following repeat administrations of the daily recommended dose of 300 mg, niraparib 
accumulation on Day 21 was consistent for both AUC and C max (~2-3 folds). Niraparib was 
shown to be highly orally bioavailable (F ~73%) (PR-30-3015-C). A high- fat meal exhibited a 
negligible effect on the extent and rate of absorption niraparib (PR-30-5011- C2-FE); therefore, 
niraparib can be administered with or without food.  
Niraparib was moderately protein bound to human plasma (83.0%) (PK002). The apparent 
volume of distribution (Vd/F) was 1220 L (PR- 30-5015-C), indicating an extensive tissue 
distribution of niraparib. In the population pharmacokinetic analysis of niraparib, the Vd/F was 1074 L in cancer patients. In nonclinical species (PK001), niraparib exhibited a high volume of distribution, i.e. Vd/F ~ 6.9 and 12.3 L/kg in rats and dogs, respectively. It is readily distributed 
to the brain and cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) of rats and monkeys, respectively (KB-0039- DA-RI 
and PK004). 
A multiple enzyme -mediated metabolism was established in vitro (PK002) and in vivo 
(absorption, metabolism, and excretion [AME] study PR -30- 5015- C). The carboxylesterases -
catalyzed amid e hydrolysis was delineated to be the major primary pathway, followed by [CONTACT_73547]-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) -mediated glucuronidation and the other minor secondary 
pathway ( i.e. methylation). The major circulating metabolites in humans are the carboxylic acid 
(M1) and the glucuronides of M1. The metabolic profile seen in humans is consistent with what 
was detected in the experimental species (rats and dogs) (PK003).  
In the AME study in cancer patients using 
14C-radioactive niraparib (N = 6, PR-30-5015- C), a 
mean measured total of 86.2% (ranged from 71.1% to 91.0%) of the radioactive dose was recovered in urine and fecal samples collected daily from 0 to 504 hours (21 days) postdose after 
single oral administration of 
14C-niraparib. Total radioactivity recovered in the urine accounted 
for 47.5% (ranged from 33.4% to 60.2%) and in the feces for 38.8% (ranged from 28.3% to 
Niraparib

Confidential  Page 25 of 71 47.0%) of the dose. Therefore, the overall recovery in the excreta following the continuous 
collection up to [ADDRESS_79888] ete, suggestive of minimal long -term retention of 
niraparib or its metabolites. Moreover, hepatobiliary clearance and renal excretion are the major routes of elimination in humans. 
5.3. Rationale for Current Study  
Niraparib is extensively metabolized and elimin ated primarily by [CONTACT_73532]. 
The purpose of this study is to evaluate pharmacokinetics and safety of niraparib in patients with 
moderate hepatic impairment, for the purpose of providing recommendations to guide the initial 
dose and dose titration in this patient population.

6.1. Primary Objective  
• To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of niraparib and its major metabolite (M1) 
when administered as a single dose in cancer patients with normal hepatic function compared to patients with moderate hepatic impairment.  
6.2. Secondary Objectives  
• To evaluate the safety of niraparib when administered as a single dose in patients with 
moderate hepatic impairment.  
• To obtain additional safety data through the extension phase, in which patients have 
the option to continue receiving niraparib.

Confidential  Page 27 of 71 7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a Phase 1, open- label, parallel -group, single-dose study in patients with advanced solid 
tumors and with either norm al hepatic function  or moderate hepatic impairment.  
Patients with solid tumors will be recruited and enrolled within the follow ing groups: 
• Group 1: normal hepatic function (total bilirubin [BILI] and aspartate 
aminotransferase [AST] ≤ upper limit of norma l [ULN]) 
• Group 2: moderate hepatic impairment (BILI >1.5 × to 3 × ULN) and any degree of AST elevation  
7.1.1. PK Phase  
All patients will receive a single dose of 300 mg niraparib administered as 3 × 100 mg capsules 
on Day 1. Patients will undergo PK sampling up to 168 hours (7 days) following niraparib 
administration. Pharmacokinetic parameters to be calculated include area under the concentration 
× time curve calculated to last measured concentration (AUC
0-t), area under the concentration × 
time curve calculated  to infinity (AUC 0-∞), maximum concentration (C max), time to maximum 
concentration (t max), terminal half -life (t½), and apparent total clearance (CL/F). Protein binding 
parameters to be calculated include fraction of unbound drug (Fu) and clearance of free drug (CLfu/F). The study will be considered complete when the final PK evaluable patient completes all assessments in the PK phase of the study.  
Safety will be assessed through adverse event assessment, physical examination, vital sign 
measurements, clin ical laboratory tests , and monitoring of concomitant medications (Section  12). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Fasting and Study Drug Administration for the PK Phase  
During the PK Phase of the study, patients should come to the clinic on the morning of Day [ADDRESS_79889], patients are permitted to consume water (but no other beverages) until up to 2 hours prior to dosing of the study drug. Patients may take their routine medications with sips of water.  
Patients will receive a single dose (300  mg) of the formulation with approximately [ADDRESS_79890] 
therapeutic dose of niraparib on Cycle 1/Day 1 of the extension phase.  For patients with normal 
hepatic function, the starting dose of niraparib will be based on the patient’s screening  actual 
body weight or current platelet count . Patients with a screening actual body weight of ≥ 77 
kg and current platelet count of ≥150,000/µL at C1D1 (or at screening if done 72 hours prior to 
C1D1) will take three capsules of 100 mg strength (300 mg/day) at each dose

count of <150,000/µL at C1D1 (or at screening if done 72 hours prior to C1D1 will take two 
capsules of 100 mg strength (200 mg) at each dose administration. Additional dose modifications 
will not be based upon changes in the patient’s actual body weight during study participation. 
Patients with moderately impaired hepatic function will receive an oral daily dose of niraparib 
200 mg (2 × 100- mg capsules).   
Patients will return to the study center during Cycle 1 on Days 8, 15, and 21 to undergo safety 
assessments (including complete blood counts [CBCs]). Thereafter, patients will return on the 
first day of every treatment cycle (28 ±3 days) to receive study drug and for safety assessments 
(including CBCs). Dose modification (dose interruption and/or reduction) may be implemented for any grade toxicity considered intolerable by [CONTACT_102], and must be implemented for any 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 3 or 4 non- hematologic 
adverse event considered by [CONTACT_73548]. Patients may continue in the extension phase until disease 
progression (assessed by [CONTACT_16622] [RECIST] v1.1 and 
clinical signs and symptoms), unacceptable toxicity, death or discontinuation from the study treatment for any other reason. At end of study (EOS), safet y assessments will be completed. No 
new capsules will be dispensed at EOS.  
Table 4 and Table 5 presents the schedule of assessments. Section  7.5 details the procedures to 
be performed on each study day/visit. 
7.2. Number of Patients  
Approximately 16 patients will be enrolled.

Extension phase:  Patients with moderately impaired hepatic function will receive an oral daily 
dose of niraparib 200 mg (2 × 100- mg capsules).   
Patients will be instructed to take their niraparib dose at the same time each day. Bedtime 
administration may be a potential method for managing nausea. Patients must swallow and not chew all capsules. The consumption of water and food is permissible. 
Niraparib will be dispensed to patients on Day 1 of every cycle (every 28 days) thereafter until 
the patient discontinues study treatment. The Pharmacy Manual contains descriptions of the packaging of niraparib and instructions for the preparation and administration of niraparib. 
9.4. Dose Adjustment Criteria   
During the extension phase, study treatment dosing interruptions are permitted in the case of adverse events, medical/surgical events or logistical reasons not related to study therapy ( e.g. 
surgery, unrelated medical events, patient vacation, or holidays). Patients should resume study 
therapy within 28 days of the scheduled interruption, unless otherwise discussed with the Sponsor. 
All treatment interruptions and dose reductions (including any missed doses) and the reasons for 
the reductions/interruptions are to be recorded in the electronic case report form ( eCRF). 
Dose interruption of niraparib may be implemented at any time per the Investigator’s judgment. See the following sections for permitted duration of interruption prior to required discontinuation from treatment.  
Niraparib dose reduction will be allowed based on treatment side effects. Dose reductions to 1 capsule daily (100 mg) will be allow ed (Table 8). No further dose reductions will be allowed. 
The timing of efficacy or safety evaluations should not be affected by [CONTACT_73552]. 
9.4.1. Niraparib Dose Modifications for Adverse Events  
During the extension phase, dose modification may be implemented by [CONTACT_73553], when deemed in the best interest of the patient. In the case of 
severe adverse reactions, treatment should be withheld and then resumed per Table 8 and  
Table 9. 
The recommended dose modifications for hematologic adverse reactions are listed i n Table 10.

9.4.2. Niraparib Dose Modifications for Nonhematologic Toxicity 
During the extension phase, treatment with niraparib must be interrupted for any treatment-
related nonhematologic Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 3 or 4 event. If toxicity is appropriately resolved to Grade 1 or less within 28 days of interruption, the 
patient may restart treatment with niraparib with a dose level reduction ac cording to Table 9 
unless prophylaxis is considered feasible. If the event recurs at a similar or worse grade, 
treatment should be interrupted. 
If the toxicity requ iring dose interruption has not resolved to CTCAE Grade 1 or less during a 
maximum 4 -week (28-day) dose interruption period, or the patient has already undergone a dose 
reduction (to a minimum dose of 100 mg QD), or both, the patient must permanently discontinue 
treatment with niraparib. Once the dose of niraparib has been reduced, any re- escalation must be 
discussed with the Sponsor.

Normal or Impaired Hepatic Function. 
Nonhematologic CTCAE ≥ Grade 3 treatment- related 
adverse reaction where prophylaxis is not considered 
feasible or adverse reaction event persists despi[INVESTIGATOR_73521] a maximum of 
28 days or until resolution of adverse 
reaction.

Confidential  Page 48 of 71 9.4.3. Niraparib Dose Modifications for Hematologic Toxicity 
The dose interruption/modification criteria for niraparib for any hematologic toxicities noted 
during the extension phase will be based on blood counts and are outlined in Table 10 (Normal  
Hepatic Function) and Table 11  (Impaired Hepatic Function) . 
If clinically indicated, use of G -CSF is allowed according to current American Society of 
Clinical Oncology ( ASCO) guidelines.5 If clinically indicated, red blood cell transfusions are 
allowed according to institutional guidelines.  
If the hematologic toxicity does not recover to the specified level within 4 weeks (28 days) of dose interruption and/or the patient has already undergone 1 dose reduction (to a minimum dose 
of 100 mg QD), then niraparib should be discontinued.  
Patients with normal hepatic function requiring transfusion of platelets or red blood cells (1 or 
more units) or hematopoietic growth factor support may undergo a niraparib dose reduction upon 
recovery if study treatment is resumed.  
Once the dose of study treatment has been reduced, any re-escalation must be discussed with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor. 
It is strongly recommended that the patient b e referred to a hematologist for further evaluation 
(1) if transfusions are required on more than 1 occasion or (2) if the treatment- related 
hematologic toxicities have not recovered to CTCAE ≤ Grade 1 within 4 weeks. If a diagnosis of 
MDS/AML is confirmed by a hematologist, the patient must permanently discontinue niraparib.  
The reason for interruption, reduction, or discontinuation of niraparib should be recorded in the 
eCRF.

The reason for interruption, reduction, or discontinuation of niraparib should be recorded in the 
eCRF. 
9.5. Concomitant Medications and Study Restrictions  
Any medication the patient takes during the study other than the study treatments, including 
herbal and other nontraditional remedies, is considered a concomit ant medication. All 
concomitant medications must be recorded in the eCRF. The following information must be 
recorded in the eCRF for each concomitant medication: generic name, route of administration, 
start date, stop date, dosage, and indication. Any changes in the dosage or regimen of a 
concomitant medication must be recorded in the eCRF. 
The identity, dose and regimen of all concomitant drugs must be recorded in the eCRF. All such 
concomitant medications should remain unchanged for [ADDRESS_79916] taken since the previous visit.

Confidential  Page 52 of 71 • Prophylactic cytokines ( e.g., G-CSF). During the extension phase, prophylactic 
cytokines should not be administered in the first cycle but may be administered in 
subsequent cycles according to current ASCO guidelines.5 
If there is a clinical indication for any  medication specifically prohibited during the study, 
discontinuation from study therapy may be required. The Investigator should discuss any questions regarding this with the Sponsor. The final decision on any supportive therapy or 
vaccination rests with the Investigator and/or the patient’s primary physician. The decision to 
continue the patient on study therapy, however, requires the mutual agreement of the 
Investigator, the Sponsor, and the patient. 
The niraparib safety profile includes thrombocytopenia; therefore, use caution with 
anticoagulation and antiplatelet drugs.  
9.5.2. Study Restrictions  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Restrictions Specific to Patients with Moderate Hepatic Impairment   
Patients enrolled in the moderate hepatic impairment group should be cautioned about the concomitant use of acetaminophen (Tylenol
®, Percocet®, or other analgesic combination tablets 
containing acetaminophen). 
Patients with hepatic impairment may receive standard therapy for diseases related to cirrhosis.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Dietary and Fluid Restrictions  
Patient must refrain from any intake of grapefruit or grapefruit juice within [ADDRESS_79919] 
administration of niraparib until the final PK sample collection.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Other Restrictions  
Niraparib is known to have properties that require the patient to use contraception. F or details, 
refer to the IB.  
Patients who are blood donors should not donate blood during the study and for [ADDRESS_79920] dose of study treatment.  
Patients should maintain a normal diet unless modifications are required to manage an AE, such as diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting. 
9.6. Duration of Therapy  
A single dose of niraparib is administered on Day 1 of the PK phase of the study, and PK 
assessments are conducted for 7 days. Following completion of the PK phase, patients may be 
eligible to continue QD niraparib treatment in an extension phase until the patient meets any of the study withdrawal criteria (Section  8.3).  
Niraparib    
Clinical Study Protocol [ADDRESS_79921] will dispense study treatment for each patient according to the protocol and 
Pharmacy Manual, if applicable.  
10.3. Study Drug Handling and Disposal  
At the end of study ( EOS), when all patients have stopped protocol treatment, complete drug 
reconciliation per batch should be available at the site for verification in order to allow drug 
destruction or return procedure. After receiving the Sponsor’s approval in writing, the 
investigational site is re sponsible for destruction of study drug according to local regulations. If a 
site does not have the capability for on-site destruction, the Sponsor will provide a return for destruction service to a third party. Both the unused and expi[INVESTIGATOR_73523], upon authorization of the Sponsor, according to local regulations and procedures, and a copy of the destruction form must be filed in the study binder. 
The drug provided for this study is to be used only as indicated in this protocol and only for the

Clinical Study Protocol 3 000-01-003 Amendment 2 
Confidential  Page 56 of 71 Any physical examination or vital signs assessed as clinically significant should  be recorded as 
an AE or SAE. If SAE criteria are met or the abnormality is an AESI (see Section 12.2.7), the 
event should be recorded and reported according to the SAE reporting process (see 
Section 12.2.5). 
12.1.3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status 
Performance status will be assessed using the ECOG scale ( Appendix 2)  in accordance with the 
schedule of assessments ( Table 4 and Table 5). The same observer should assess performance 
status each time.  
12.2. Adverse Events  
12.2.1. Definitions  
Adverse event (AE):  An AE is any untoward medical occurrence that occurs in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or not considered related to the product. 
AEs may include the onset of new illness and the exacerbation of pre- existing medical 
conditions. An AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including 
baseline or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered. A TEAE will be 
defined as any new AE that begins, or any preexisting condition that worsens in severity during 
the Treatment Period.  
Serious adverse event (SAE):  A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at 
any dose as follows: 
• Results in death  
• Is life-threatening  
− Note: This means that the patient is at immediate risk of death at the time of the 
event; it does not mean that the event hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_64005] 
• Any AE that prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_73524]. 
− Exception: Preplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ( e.g. for observation, protocol compliance, 
elective procedures, social reasons) will not be considered an SAE; however, the 
reason for the planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_73525] . Complications experienced during these hospi[INVESTIGATOR_73526] (or SAEs, if hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14488]). 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
Niraparib    
Clinical Study Protocol 3 000-01-003 Amendment 2 
Confidential  Page 57 of 71 • Is an important medical event(s)  
− Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in determining whether 
situations or events should be considered serious adverse events; An important 
medical event may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_73527]. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse. (See section 12.2.5 for information about SAE 
reporting)  
Treatment -Emergent  Adverse Events (TEAEs) : Any event that was not present prior to the 
initiation of study treatment or any event already present that worsens in either intensity or frequency following exposure to study treatment. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI):  Any AE (serious or non- serious) that is of 
scientific and medical co ncern specific to the study treatment, for which ongoing monitoring and 
rapid communication by [CONTACT_73555]. Special Situations: Abuse, Misuse, Medication Errors, Overdose, and Accidental or 
Occupational Exposure: 
• Abuse: the persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of the study treatment 
which is accompanied by [CONTACT_3584].  
• Misuse: medicinal product is intentionally and inappropriately used not in accordance 
with the authorized/approved product information. 
• Medication error:  any preventable incident that may cause or lead to inappropriate 
study treatment use or patient harm while the study treatment is in the control of the 
health care professionals or patients. Such incident may be due to health care 
professional practice, product labeling, packaging and preparation, procedures for administration, and systems, including the following: prescribing, order 
communication, nomenclature, compounding, dispensing, distribution, 
administration,  education, monitoring, and use. 
• Overdose:  a deliberate or accidental administration of study treatment to a study 
patient, at a dose greater than that which was assigned to that patient per the study 
protocol and under the direction of the Investigator.  If an overdose occurs, the 
Investigator and the Sponsor should be notified immediately, and the patient should be observed closely for AEs. Associated AEs should be treated and monitored by [CONTACT_3786]. The dosage of study drug administered, any associated AEs, and/or 
treatment provided to the patient because of the overdose, should be documented on the applicable sections within the eCRF. An overdose (including an AE or SAE resulting from the overdose, if any) will be reported as described in Section  
• Accidental /Occupational exposure:  the unintentional exposure to a study treatment 
as a result of one's professional or non-professional occupation, or accidental exposure to a non-professional to whom exposure was not intended (i.e. study product given to wrong patient).  
Niraparib    
Clinical Study Protocol 3 000-01-003 Amendment 2 
Confidential  Page 58 of 71 Reporting Special Situations:  All occurrences of abuse, misuse, medication error, overdose, and 
accidental or occupational exposure with any study treatment must be reported on an SAE 
Report Form [or designated Special Form] to the Sponsor regardless of whether or not an AE or SAE has occurred. If the abuse, misuse, medication error, overdose, or accidental / occupational 
exposure is associated with an SAE, an SAE report form must be submitted to the Sponsor 
within [ADDRESS_79924] be submitted on the designated Special Form (indicate ‘no AE has occurred’) as soon as possible.
 
12.2.2. Assessment of Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Severity Assessment  
All AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_14539] (CTCAE) v4.03: 14 June 2010; National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI). The CTCAE severity grades 1 through 5 provide unique clinical 
descriptions of severity of each ad verse event. The CTCAE v4.03 is available on the NCI/NIH 
website. 
Please note that there is a distinction between serious and severe AEs: Severity is a measure of 
intensity whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_14540]  12.2.1. For example, a mild 
degree of gastrointestinal bleeding requiring an overnight hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14490]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Expectedness  
The Sponsor will be responsible for determining whether an adverse event is ‘expected’ or 
‘unexpected’. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the 
event is not consistent with the risk information provided in the Reference Safety Information of the effective niraparib Investigator Brochure (IB).    
[IP_ADDRESS]. Causality 
The Investigator will assess the causality/relationship between the study drug and the AE. One of the following categories should be selected based on medical judgment, considering the definitions and all contributing factors: 
• Definitely related : A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurs in a 
plausible time relationship to treatment administration, and which concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals cannot explain. The response to withdrawal of the treatment should be clinically plausible.  
• Possibly related : A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a 
reasonable time sequence to administration of the treatment, unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals.  
• Unlikely related : A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a 
temporal relationship to treatment administration which makes a causal relationship 
improbable, or in which other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease provide likely 
explanations. 
Niraparib  
Clinical Study Protocol 3 000-01-003 Amendment 2 
Confidential Page 59 of 71 •Unrelated : A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with little or no
temporal relationship with treatment administration. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_73528] (e.g . concomitant disease, environmental factors, or other drugs or
chemicals).
12.2.3. Collecting and Recording  Adverse Events  
AEs may be volunteered spontaneously by [CONTACT_4694], or discovered by [CONTACT_14543], non-leading question such as: “How have 
you been feeling since you were last asked?” The Investigator will document the nature of AE, date of onset of the AE (and time, if known), date of outcome of the AE (and time, if known), 
severity of the AE, actio n taken with study drug as a result of the AE, assessment of the 
seriousness of the AE, and assessment of the causal relationship of the AE to study drug and/or 
study procedure. 
AEs, including laboratory abnormalities that are assessed as clinically signif icant or require 
intervention, should be described using a diagnosis whenever possible, rather than individual 
underlying signs and symptoms. When a clear diagnosis cannot be identified, each sign or symptom should be recorded as a separate AE.  
All SAEs will be monitored through 90 days after cessation of study treatment (or to a minimum 
of [ADDRESS_79925]- treatment if the patient starts alternative anticancer therapy)  and recorded in the 
eCRF. SAEs will also be reported on an SAE form as described in section 12.2.[ADDRESS_79926] to follow -up or until the patient has died. 
All AEs, regardless of the source of identification ( e.g. physical examination, laboratory 
assessment, reported by [CONTACT_4676]), must be documented in the eCRF for each patient from the signing of the ICF for this study up to [ADDRESS_79927] dose of study treatment.  
Concomitant illnesses that existed before entry into the study will not be considered an AE unless the illness worsens during the treatment period. Pre-existing conditions will be recorded in the eCRF as well as  on the SAE Report Form medical history section. 
Disease progression is an efficacy criterion and is therefore not considered an AE or SAE (even if fatal). Disease progression should be reported within the eCRF. If AEs/SAEs occur in relation to disease pro gression that are not consistent with the natural progression of the patient’s disease, 
these AEs/SAEs must be reported per AE/SAE reporting requirements described in Section 12.2.[ADDRESS_79928] be completed on each form: follow-up number, site number, patient 
number, protocol number, and the SAE term(s) and date of awareness. Additionally, only the appropriate field(s) on the SAE Report Form where the Investigator received additional or 
updated information should be completed. Previously provided information does not have to be 
entered on the follow-up SAE Report Form. 
Initial and follow -up SAE reports and any additional supporting documentation, as requested 
(e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_73529], consultant reports, death certificates, autopsy reports) included with the 
SAE report should be sent to the Sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of the Investigator/site awareness or receipt. If supporting documentation is provided, the Investigator should highlight 
all relevant and pertinent information. It is the responsibility of the Investigator to revie w source 
documentation and describe pertinent information on the SAE form. Also, any additional SAE 
documentation must be a clear photocopy with the patient’s personal identifiers removed. The Investigator must sign and date all SAE forms.  
After receipt of  the initial report, the Sponsor (or designee) will review the information and, if 
necessary, contact [CONTACT_14546]. The Investigator must promptly respond to queries from the Sponsor.

12.2.7. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) for niraparib are the following: 
 
• Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)  and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)  
• Secondary cancers  (new malignancies [other than MDS or AML])  
• Pneumonitis 
• Embryo-fetal toxicity  
Reporting AESIs:  All occurrences AESIs must be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of 
awareness.  If the AESI is serious, it should be reported on an SAE Report Form [ and designated 
Special Form]. If the AESI is not serious, it should be reported on the relevant designated Special Form. 
AESIs should also be collected and reported as follows: 
• MDS and AML along with other secondary cancers should be reported to the Sponsor until 
death or loss to follow-up.  • Pneumonitis should be reported to the Sponsor through [ADDRESS_79930] dose of study drug (or until the start of alternate anticancer thera py, whichever occurs first).  
 • Embryo-fetal toxicity should be reported as outlined in Section 12.2.9.

the pregnancy has been completed or terminated. The Investigator will make every effort to 
obtain permission to follow the outcome of the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to the Sponsor. The Pregnancy Outcome report form should be completed and 
submitted to the Sponsor within [ADDRESS_79933] be completed and submitted as well. 
In the event the pregnancy outcome occurs following the end of the study and database lock, the 
Investigator will report the pregnancy outcome to the Sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours after 
the outcome of the pregnancy is known to the Investigator in accordance with the procedure for 
reporting SAEs (Section  12.2.5). 
Pregnancy alone is not regarded as an AE unless there is a possibility that the study drug may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. Elective abortions w ithout 
complications should not be considered AEs unless they were therapeutic abortions, but should 
be reported to the Sponsor. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14494] a healthy newborn should not 
be considered an SAE. Pregnancy is not considered an SAE unless there is an associated serious outcome. Spontaneous abortions should always be reported as SAEs. 
Any SAE that occurs during pregnancy must be recorded on the Pregnancy Outcome  Report 
Form (e.g. maternal serious complications, therapeutic abortion, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth, 
neonatal death, congenital anomaly, birth defect) and reported within 24 hours in accordance 
with the procedure for reporting SAEs.

A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be issued as a separate document, providing detailed 
methods for the safety analyses outlined in this section. Any deviations from the planned 
analyses will be described and justified in the final integrated clinical study report (CSR).  
13.1. Determination of Sample Size  
16 PK-evaluable patients will be enr olled in the study (8 with normal hepatic function and 8 with 
moderate hepatic impairment). This is a descriptive study and no formal sample size calculations 
were performed. The proposed sample size is consistent with the recommendations in the FDA 
document (at least 6 subjects), Guidance for Industry for Hepatic Function studies (Guidance for Industry 2003). 
13.2. Study Population  
13.2.1. Patient Disposition  
Study completion status will be summarized for all patients. Categories summarized will include those patients who were screened, enrolled, completed the study, or discontinued early (including reason for discontinuation). 
13.2.2. Demographic Information and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic characteristics of all patients enrolled will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_73557], sex, race, height, and weight. 13.2.3. Protocol Deviations 
Protocol deviations will be listed by [CONTACT_4676].  
13.2.4. Analysis Populations 
The pharmacokinetic population for the evaluation of the PK of niraparib and M1 in patients 
with normal hepatic function and in patients with hepatic impairment will consist of all patients who receive niraparib and have sufficient evaluable samples for the determination of C
max, 
AUC0-t, and AUC 0-∞.  
The safety population will consist of all patients who receive dru g. 
13.3. General Considerations  
All data will be summarized by [CONTACT_19313]. Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics (number of patients, mean, standard deviation [StD ev], minimum, median, 
and maximum). Categorical variables will be summarized using counts of patients and percentages.

Clinical Study Protocol [ADDRESS_79934] deviation, coefficient of variation, median, minimum and 
maximum by [CONTACT_19313]. 
To assess the effects of hepatic impairment on niraparib PK, linear models will be applied to the 
log-transformed C max, and AUC 0-t, AUC 0- ∞. The independent variable in the analyses will be 
liver function (normal hepatic function [control] or moderate hepatic impairment). Point estimates and 90% CIs for differences between means on the log scale will be exponenti ated to 
express the results as ratios of geometric means on the original scale. Patients with normal 
hepatic function (Group 2) will be used as reference group to which Group 1 will be compared. 
No adjustments will be made for multiplicity.

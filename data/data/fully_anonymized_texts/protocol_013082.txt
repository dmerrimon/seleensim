Indication  Prophylaxis of influenza  
Study Summary  Influenza is a highly infectious disease caused by [CONTACT_29226], an orthomyxovirus with two clinically relevant types (types A and B). The disease is characterized by [CONTACT_29227][INVESTIGATOR_19256], such as fever, myalgia, headache, severe malaise, nonproductive cough, sore throat, and rhinitis, and occurs in epi[INVESTIGATOR_570703]. During influenza epi[INVESTIGATOR_7509], there is increased mortality among older adults (age > 65 years), people with chronic diseases, and very young children (age 0 to 12 mont hs), as well as an increase in 
morbidity and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_570704]- associated 
complications. Influenza epi[INVESTIGATOR_570705] A subtype viruses (H3N2 or H1N1), or type B viruses. 
 
Influenza type B viruses show extensive variation in antigenicity. Although only one subtype is known to exist, influenza type B viruses have separated into two distinct genetic lineages since 1985, Yamagata and Victoria. B strains from either lineage may circulate and cause infection, and mismatch may occur between circulating B strains and influenza vaccine B strains due to antigenic variation over time. On average, influenza B strain accounts for approximately 25% of positive specimens in the US. The burden of infection is largely school age children, young adults 
and older adults, however, young children experience the highest 
  Clinical Study Protocol 
CSLCT -QIV -15-[ADDRESS_749139] that B strain vaccine 
mismatch can make on total influenza morbidity and mortality. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  ha ve estimated that in 
a season where there is a B strain mismatch, availability of quadrivalent influenza virus vaccines could prevent 1 million cases, 7000 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4355] 320 deaths in the [LOCATION_003].  The Seqirus split-virion quadrivalent inactivated influenza virus vaccine ( Seqirus QIV) used in this study for subjects 36 months 
through 59 months of age is formulated to contain 15 micrograms 
(mcg) of hemagglutinin (HA) per 0.5mL dose for each included 
influenza virus strain, including representative strains o f both B 
lineages. This QIV formulation is consistent with the currently-licensed Afluria tri valent influenza virus vaccine, except that it  
contains an additional B influenza strain so that the total HA concentration is 120 mcg HA/mL, from four strains.  The pediatric dose of QIV used in this study for subjects 6 months through 35 months of age is formulated to contain 7.5 mcg of HA per 0.25mL dose for each included influenza virus strain, including representative strains of both B lineages  This phase 3 study is a randomized, observer-blinded, comparator 
controlled study of Seqirus QIV  versus a US -licensed 2016-2017 
comparator QIV containing the same influenza strains recommended in the [LOCATION_002]  for the 2016-2017 season.  
 
Primary Objective(s)  To demonstra te that vaccination with Seqirus QIV elicits an 
immune response that is not inferior to the US-licensed comparator QIV (Comparator QIV) containing the same virus strains as  
Seqirus QIV among a pediatric population 6 months through 59 
months of age . 
Primary Endpoint(s)  The immunogenicity of study vaccines will be assessed at least [ADDRESS_749140] vaccine administration by [CONTACT_570728] (HI) antibody titers to the [ADDRESS_749141] -QIV -15-03 
 
Version 2 - 24 MAY 2016  Confidential  Page 7 of 102 
 
 
 
strains included in the vaccines.  
The noninferiority of Seqirus QIV compared to US licensed 
comparator QIV will be assessed by [CONTACT_941] 8 co -primary endpoints of 
geometric mean titer (GMT) and seroconversion rate (SCR) for 
each viral strain contained in the vaccines as follows:  
 • The GMT ratio* f or the A/H1N1 strain;  
• The GMT ratio for the A/H3N2 strain;  
• The GMT ratio for the B strain (Yamagata lineage);  
• The GMT ratio for the B strain (Victoria lineage); 
 • The difference between the seroconversion rates**  for the 
A/H1N1 strain;  
• The difference between the seroconversion rates for the A/H3N2 strain;  
• The difference between the seroconversion rates for the B strain (Yamagata lineage);  
• The difference between the seroconversion rates for the B strain (Victoria lineage).  
  *The G MT ratio is defined as the geometric mean of 
postvaccination (Study Exit Visit) HI titer for the US licensed 
comparator QIV over the geometric mean of postvaccination 
(Study Exit Visit) HI titer for Seqirus QIV.  
 
**The rate of seroconversion is defined as the percentage of subjects with either a prevaccination HI titer < 1:10 and a postvaccination HI titer ≥ 1: 40 or a prevaccination HI titer ≥ 1:10 
and a ≥ 4 -fold increase in postvaccination HI titer.   
Secondary Objective(s)  The secondary ob jectives of the study are:  
 1.  To assess the safety and tolerability of Seqirus QIV in two age 
strata: 6 months through 35 months, and 36 months through 59 months , as well as overall.  
 
 2.  To characterize the immunogenicity of Seqirus QIV and  the US -
licensed comparator QIV  in two age strata: 6 months through 35 
months, and 36 months through 59 months, as well as overall. 
Secondary Endpoint(s)  Secondary Endpoints:  
 Secondary Safety Endpoints: 
• Frequency and severity of solicited local reaction s and 
systemic adverse events (AEs) for [ADDRESS_749142] -QIV -15-03 
 
Version 2 - 24 MAY 2016  Confidential  Page 8 of 102 
 
 
 
vaccination dose;  
• Frequency of cellulitis -like reaction s for at least 28 days 
after each vaccination dose;  
• Frequency and severity of unsolicited AEs for at least 28 
days after each vaccination dose;  
• Frequency of serious adverse events (SAEs) for at least [ADDRESS_749143] vaccination dose.  
 
Secondary Immunogenicity Endpoints:  
The humoral immune response will be assessed in terms of HI 
antibodies for both the Seqirus QIV and Comparator QIV. Serum HI antibody titers against the 4 influenza vaccine strains will be used to calculate:  
• Geometric mean titer (GMT): Geometric mean of HI titers prevaccination (Day 1) and postvaccination (Study Exit Visit);  
• Seroconversion rate : Percentage of subjects with either a 
prevaccination HI titer <  1:10 and a postvaccination HI titer 
≥ 1:40 or a prevaccination titer ≥ 1:10 and a ≥ 4-fold increase in postvaccination titer;  
• The percentage of subjects with a titer ≥40 (seroprotection 
rates ) at Day 1 and Study Exit Visit; 
• Geometric Mean Fold increase (GMFI)***: Geometric mean -fold-titer rise from Day 1 to Study Exit Visit.  
 
***The rate of seroprotection is defined as the proportion of 
subjects with an HI titer ≥1:40. 
****GMFI in antibody titer is defined as the geometric mean of the 
fold increase of postvaccination HI antibody titer over the prevaccination HI antibody titer . 
Exploratory Objective To assess  the frequency of antipyretic use in the first 7 days 
postvaccination in two age strata: [ADDRESS_749144] -QIV -15-03

Administration  (FDA ) and Vaccines and Related Biological 
Products Advisory Committee ( VRB PAC) for the 2016-[ADDRESS_749145] of  the thigh (or the deltoid 
muscle of the arm if muscle mass is adequate) in children 12 
months through 35 months of age, or the deltoid muscle of the non-dominant arm in children 36 months through 59 months of age. 
The study will be conducted during the 2016-2017 Northern Hemisphere influenza immunization season in male and female subjects 6 months through 59 months of age. 
After parent (s)/guardian (s) have provided written informed consent 
(Visit 1 [Day 1]), eligible subjects will be stratified by [CONTACT_570729] e 
of two age cohorts: 
• Cohort A comprising subjects 6 months through 35 months of 
age; 
• Cohort B comprising subjects 36 months through 59 months of 
age. 
The Interactive Response Technology (IRT) will include a quota 
for each age stratum so that no more than 60% of the total sample size is represented in each age stratum.   
 A step -down approach to enrollment is designed to allow the 
opportunity to assess safety data prior to enrolling the younger cohort ie, [ADDRESS_749146] of subjects (or a minimum of 300 subjects) in this age cohort have received the first vaccination and have had an opportunity to enter at least [ADDRESS_749147] ( DSMB ) 
meeting convened to review and assess the available safety data.  
 Recruitment in the 36 through 59 months age cohort will not be halted during the period of the data cut and DSMB review. Enrollment in the younger age cohort (subjects 6 months through 35 months of age ) will only commence after the  DSMB has 
reviewed the safety data and recommended that  the study may 
proceed . 
A second  safety  data cu t will be performed when approximately 
one third of subjects (or a minimum of 300 subjects) in the [ADDRESS_749148] the 7 days of safety 
data postvaccination , A DSMB meeting will be convened to review 
and assess the available safety data. Recruitment in the 6 through 35 months age cohort will not be halted during the period of the data cut and DSMB review . 
 
After stratification, subjects will be randomized to one of the two 
treatment groups using a 3:1 allocation ratio to receive either 
Seqirus QIV or the US licensed comparator QIV.  
Subjects will provide pre- and postvaccination serological specimens as well as structured safety follow -up. 
Screening evaluations will be performed either the day of the vaccination or within a maximum of 1 week before vaccination and include medical history, and targeted physical examination (if clinically indicated). Vaccination  will occur on Day 1. On Day 1 
and prior to vaccination, a serum sample will be collected for influenza- specific serology.   
The parent(s)/guardian(s) of subjects will record electronically:  
1. In a “7 -Day Diary”: the occurrence of solicited AEs, a pre-
specif ied series of local reactions and systemic symptoms 
and temperature that may occur between Day 1 and Day 7  
after a vaccination . 
2. In an “Other Body Symptoms Diary”, any unsolicited AEs that may occur between Day 1 and the Study Exit Visit.  
3. In a “Medication Diary”, all concomitant medication use 
that may occur between Day 1 and the Study Exit Visit. 
Subjects will return to the clinic 2 8 (+4) days after each indicated 
vaccine dose. During this visit, entries in the 7- Day Diary,  the 
Other Body Symptoms Diary and the Medication Diary will be 
reviewed with the parent(s)/guardian(s) and a targeted physical 
examination perf ormed as clinically indicated. For one-dose 
schedule subjects , Visit 2 (Day 29+4 ) post vaccination is the Exit 
Visit. For two -dose schedule subjects, Visit 3 (Day 29+[ADDRESS_749149]- 
second vaccination) is the Exit V isit. SAEs and adverse events of 
special interest ( AESIs ) will be collected via a telephone call at 
least [ADDRESS_749150] vaccination dose (Day 90+7) and another at [ADDRESS_749151] vaccination dose (Day 180+7). 
Analyses of safety data may be triggered by [CONTACT_570730], or following ad -hoc 
requests for review by [CONTACT_570731] . 
  Clinical Study Protocol 
CSLCT -QIV -15-[ADDRESS_749152] completed 
all immunogenicity assessments and all solicited and unsolicited 
adverse event reporting , and results will be presented in an interim 
study report.  A final clinical study report will present all 
immunogenicity and safety data collected from the active study period and safety data through to the final evaluation ([ADDRESS_749153] vaccination dose).
 
Number of Subjects  Approximately 1500 subjects will be enrolled into the  Seqirus QIV 
group and 500 in the Comparator QIV group. This provides a total of 2000 evaluable subjects, assuming a 10% dropout rate. Thus a total of [ADDRESS_749154] receiving a single vaccination will be up to 7 months (up to 7 days screening period , 28+4 days 
active study period and 180+7 days safety follow-up period). 
 The maximum study duration for an individual subject scheduled for the two -vaccination regimen will be up to 8 months (up to 7 
days screening  period, 28 +4 days active study period after each 
Study Vaccine dose, and 180+[ADDRESS_749155] vaccination dose).   
The overall study duration (ie, first subject’s screening visit to last 
subject’s end -of-study visit) will be a maximum of 10 months.

• Assessment of the occurrence of any AEs, SAEs and AESIs;  
• Targeted physical examination as clinically indicated;  
• Collection of at least 3 mL blood sample.  
Postvaccination Safety Follow-up Telephone Call (Day 90+7 
and 180+[ADDRESS_749163] Vaccination) 
Serious a dverse event and AESI information will be collected for a 
total of 180 days (180+7 days) after administration of the last dose of study vaccine: 
Unscheduled Visit - Influenza -like Illness (ILI) Visit  
 Subjects reporting signs/symptoms of an ILI between Visit 1 and Study Exit Visit (Visit 2 or Visit 3)  will be asked to attend an 
additional clinic visit within 72 hours of the symptoms meeting the 
case definition of an ILI, for confirmation of the ILI. 
 The criteria for an ILI are as follows:  
• Elevated axillary temperature of ≥ 99.5°F ( ≥ 37.5°C) or a 
clear history of fever or chills); and 
  Clinical Study Protocol

Version 2 - 24 MAY 2016  Confidential  Page 19 of 102  
 
 
 
• At least one respi[INVESTIGATOR_20321]: including sore throat, 
cough, wheezing, rhinorrhea/rhinitis; and 
• At least one systemic symptom, including myalgia, 
headache, malaise and fatigue, nausea and /or vomiting , 
diarrhe a, loss of appetite and irritability . 
Upon confirmation that the ILI case definition is met, the subject’s temperature will be assessed and attempts will be made to diagnose influenza viral infection by [CONTACT_570737].  These
 will be analyzed for laboratory confirmation of 
influenza A and/ or B by [CONTACT_570738]  (RT-PCR).  
Unscheduled Visit – Cellulitis -like Reaction  
 
Subjects reporting signs/symptoms of a Cellulitis -like Reaction 
between Day 1 and Study Exit Visit will be asked to attend an 
additional clinic visit within 24 hours (up to 3 days if on a 
weekend) of the sympto ms meeting the definition of a Cellulitis -
like R eaction.  
The criteria for a Cellulitis -like Reaction are concurrent presence 
of all three of the following:  
• Grade 3 injection site pain; 
• Grade 3 injection site erythema; 
• Grade 3 injection site induration. 
Investigational site staff will assess for the presence of ulceration, abscess, or necrosis at the injection site.  
Efficacy Assessments  Efficacy assessment involves the assessment of immunogenicity on the basis of HI antibody titer to each strain. Immunogenicity will be expressed as:  
• HI antibody titer for each strain. All analyses involving HI 
antibody titer (namely GMT within a treatment group) will be 
based on the log scale and the resultant summary statistic back -
transformed to derived GMT; 
• Seroconversion. For each strain the subjects will be classified 
as ‘seroconverted’ if either they have a prevaccination HI 
antibody titer  < 1:10 and a postvaccination HI antibody titer ≥ 
  Clinical Study Protocol

Version 2 - 24 MAY 2016  Confidential  Page 20 of 102  
 
 
 
1:40 or a prevaccination H1 antibody titer ≥ 1:10 and a ≥ 4 -fold 
increase in postvaccination H1 antibody titer. Otherwise they 
will be classified as ‘not seroconverted’; 
• Seroprotection. For each strain a subject will be classified as ‘seroprotected’ if their HI antibody titer ≥ 1:[ADDRESS_749164] both antibody titers  ≥ 
1:40 they will be classified as ‘not seroprotected’; 
• Fold increase. For each strain the fold increa se for each subject 
will be calculated by [CONTACT_570739]; 
Covariate adjusted analyses will be performed as outlined in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
Immunogenicity Analys es (Day 1 and Study Exit Visit): 
Immunogenicity analyses in terms of HI antibody titers specific for 
the virus strains included in the vaccines will be performed on 
serum specimens taken at Day 1 (Visit 1) and at the Study Exit Visit (Visit 2 – single dose schedule or  Visit 3 – two -dose 
schedule).  
Safety Assessments Safety will be assessed through solicited local reactions, solicited 
systemic AEs, unsolicited AEs, and SAEs. 
Type, frequency and intensity of solicited local reactions through 
Day 7 (Day 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) following each study vaccination dose. These include pain, erythema/redness, and induration/ swelling . 
Frequency of cellulitis -like reaction  for 28 days following each 
vaccination. Cellulitis -like reaction is defined as the concurrent 
presence of g rade 3 injection site pain, erythema/r edness and 
induration/swelling.   
Type, frequency, duration and intensity of solicited systemic AEs through to Day 7 (Day 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) following each study vaccination dose. These include headache, malaise  and fatigue, 
myalgia, fever, diarrhea, and nausea and /or vomiting for children 
36 months through 59 months of age, and fever, diarrhea, nausea 
and/or vomiting, loss of appetite, and irritability for children [ADDRESS_749165] vaccination dose.  
Pharmacokinetics  Not Applicable. 
Pharmacodynamics Not Applicable. 
Other Assessments  Not Applicable.  
Statistical Analyses Primary Immunogenicity Analysis  
The primary objective is to demonstrate that vaccination with 
Seqirus QIV elicits a noninferior immune response compared to a US licensed comparator QIV among a pediatric population 6 months through 59 months of age.  
Co-primary immunogenicity endpoints of geometric mean titer 
(GMT) and seroconversion rate for each virus strain contained in 
the vaccine will be assessed.  The rate of seroconversion is defined 
as the percentage of subjects with either a prevaccination hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) titer < 1:10 and a postvaccination HI titer ≥ 1:40 or a prevaccination titer ≥ 1:10 and a ≥ 4- fold increase 
in postvaccination titer.  
The noninferiority of Seqirus QIV compared to the US licensed comparator QIV will be assessed by [CONTACT_941] 8 co -prim ary endpoints of 
GMT and seroconversion rate. 
 In line with the FDA Guidance on seasonal inactivated influenza 
vaccines (Guidance for Industry Clinical Data Needed to Support 
Licensure of Seasonal Inactivated Influenza Vaccines 2007) Seqirus 
QIV will be considered to be noninferior to the US licensed comparator QIV for each strain if:  
• The upper bound of the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) on the ratio of the GMTs does not exceed 1.5. The GMT ratio will be calculated by [CONTACT_570740] / GMT  
Seqirus  QIV 
  
• The upper bound of the two-sided 95% CI on the difference between the seroconversion rates does not exceed 10%.  The difference in seroconversion rate will be calculated by (Seroconversion 
Comparator  QIV–Seroconversion    Seqirus QIV). 
 
To determine the GMT ratio (adjusted analysis) a general linear 
  Clinical Study Protocol 
CSLCT -QIV -15-03 
 
Version 2 - 24 MAY 2016  Confidential  Page 22 of 102  
 
 
 
model (GLM) will be fitted on log transformed postvaccination HI 
titer (titer) as the outcome variable and with inclusion of covariates 
such as vaccine treatment, prevaccination HI titer, age stratum, sex, 
vaccination history, age- by-vaccine interaction  and study site.  
From the model an adjusted difference in least square means (on the log scale) will be produced with 95% confidence limits.  The estimated difference and the confidence limits will be back transformed to obtain an adjusted GMT ratio with 95% confidence 
limits.  Each of the four strains will be analyzed separately.  The adjusted GMT ratio will be the result for which the noninferiority 
assessment will be based on. The measure of the unadjusted GMT 
ratio based on postvaccination GMTs only will also be present ed. 
Secondary Objectives:  
Secondary objectives include assessing the safety and tolerability of Seqirus QIV in two age strata: 6 months through 35 months and 
36 months through 59 months of age, as well as overall. 
The proportion of subjects with AEs in the two treatment arms will 
be presented. Adverse events will be monitored postvaccination as per the following: 
1. Solicited local adverse reactions and systemic AEs through Day 7 (Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) after each vaccination  dose; 
2. Cellulitis -like reaction  and cellulitis  for 28 days after each 
vaccination dose; 
3. Unsolicited AEs for at least 28 days following each 
vaccination dose; 
4. Serious adverse events (SAEs) for at least [ADDRESS_749166] vaccination dose. 
 The frequency, duration and intensity of solicited and unsolicited AEs will be summarized for each age group and study vaccine. The proportion of subjects reporting each type of AE will be presented along with percentages and confidence intervals. Solicite d local 
adverse reactions and systemic AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_35043], duration and intensity. Unsolicited AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_570741]. If sufficient numbers of cases of AEs occur, more formal statistical analyses of event rates or intensity may be conducted.   
Further details of planned analyses will be specified in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).

Statistical Considerations for Sample Size C alculations:  
Seqirus QIV will be tested against a US licensed comparator QIV. 
The treatment randomization ratio is 3:1 (Seqirus QIV: Comparator 
QIV). This study is designed to achieve at least 80% power to demonstrate noninferiority for all of the 8 co-primary endpoints, seroconversion rates for 4 strains, GMT for 4 strains using a one-sided alpha of 0.025 for each comparison. No adjustment for multiple endpoints was made.  For comparisons of SCR a 
noninferiority margin of 10% (Seqirus QIV - Comparator QIV) 
will be employed. It is assumed that the SCR for all strains for QIV 
is 50% and that there is no difference between Seqirus QIV and Comparator QIV. 
 For comparison of GMT ratio a noninferiority margin of 1.5 
(Comparator QIV/ Seqirus QIV, equivalent to a difference on the log scale of 0.405465108) will be employed. It is assumed that there is no difference between Seqirus QIV and Comparator QIV (ie, a ratio of 1, difference on the log scale of 0) and that the standard deviation of log (titer) is 1.4.  
 
Under these assumptions and with n evaluable = 1500 in the 
Seqirus QIV group and 500 in the Comparator QIV the power for 4 GMT ratio endpoints is 99.95% and the power for 4 SCR endpoints is 89.70%. The overall global power of the 8 endpoints is then 89.7% x 99.95% = 89.66%.This provides a total N evaluable = 2000 (with 10% dropouts N=2222).  Sample size calculations were performed using SAS v9.3. 
Interim Analyses  An interim analysis will be made once all subjects have completed 
all immunogenicity assessments and all solicited and unsolicited adverse event reporting.  
Enrollment Halting Rules  Enrol lment into the study and study vaccination will be halted for 
DSMB r eview/ recommendation for continuation if during the 7 
days after vaccination (Day 1 to Day 7) any of the following occur:  
• One or more subject experiences an AE that is serious, unexpected, and is assessed as related to Study Vaccine;  
• One or more subject experiences an AE that is life- threatening 
or causes death;  
• One or more subject experiences a serious febrile AE, defined as any AE meeting seriousness criteria that is also associated with a fever of ≥ 101.3°F / ≥ 38.5°C (axillary); 
• One or more of the subjects experiences a severe (grade 3)

• allergic reaction (eg, hives, angioedema, allergic asthma, 
systemic anaphylaxis);  
• Vaccine- related injection site ulceration, abscess, or 
necrosis;  
Additionally, enroll ment into the study and study vaccination will 
be halted pending review by [CONTACT_570742] 1 to Day 7, 
the following defined halting rule criteria are met in either study cohort (6 months through 35 months or 36 months through 59 
months): 
• ≥ 5% of subjects enrolled to date with concurrent grade 3 
pain, erythema, and induration (a cellulitis- like reaction) 
that is assessed as related to Study Vaccine.  
(Note: If the total number of subjects enrolled to date is less than 60, a minimum of 3 subjects experiencing a concurrent severe vaccine-associated pain, erythema or induration will be needed to halt further enroll ment);  
• ≥ 5% of subjects enrolled to date, experience a fever of ≥ 101.3°F [≥ 38.5°C] (axillary) that  is assessed as related to 
Study Vaccine.  
 (Note: if the total number of subjects enrolled to date is less than 60, a minimum of 3 subjects is required to trigger the halt). 
In addition, the DSMB chair will be immediately notified of any  SAE, regardless of causality or expectedness assessment, occurring 
during Day 1 to Day 7. The DSMB chair will then make a determination regarding  the necessity of a DSMB meeting and/or 
study halt in response to these events.
 
Data Safety Monitoring Board An independent DSMB will monitor subject safety during the 
study. The DSMB will comprise clinical study experts with experience in vaccine studies and safety assessment. The DSMB will provide recommendations for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_570708].

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Influenza is a highly infectious disease that occurs in epi[INVESTIGATOR_570709]. The disease is characterized by [CONTACT_29227][INVESTIGATOR_19256], such as fever, myalgia, headache, severe malaise, nonproductive cough, sore throat, and rhinitis [ Temte and Prunuske 2010
]. In general, 
influenza is resolved within two to seven days, although symptoms of cough and malaise may be prolonged. However, for some people, notably older adults and those with chronic diseases (such as pulmonary or circulatory disorders, metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus, renal dysfunction, or immunosuppression), influenza can exacerbate underlying medical conditions and/or lead to secondary viral or bacterial pneumonia [
Rothberg et al. 
2008 ; Fiore  et al. 2009 ]. During influenza epi[INVESTIGATOR_7509], there is increased mortality among 
older adults (age > 65 years), people with chronic diseases and very young children (age 0 to 12 months), as well as an increase in morbidity and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_570704]-associated complications [
Monto 2008, Fiore et al. 2009 ]. 
 The influenza virus is an orthomyxovirus that can be classified into three types, A, B, and C, of which, type A and B viruses are the most clinically significant. The influenza type A virus can be further divided into subtypes based on the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) surface glyc oprotein antigens. Of the influenza type A virus subtypes, the A/H3N2 and 
A/H1N1 subtypes are the most clinically important. Influenza type B viruses show extensive variation in antigenicity. Although only one subtype is known to exist, influenza type B viruses are separated into two distinct genetic lineages, Yamagata and Victoria.  
 Influenza vaccines are designed to protect against illness from the circulating virus strains. Hemagglutinin  and, to some extent, neuraminidase antigens present in inactivated influenza 
vaccines are thought to act predominantly by [CONTACT_570743]-specific serum antibodies in vaccinated individuals. These antibodies can be protective against infection, or may re sult in 
less severe disease in some infected individuals.  
 Influenza vaccines for seasonal use since the 1960s have been trivalent, including variants of 
A/H3N2, A/H1N1, and one B-strain lineage. Monovalent vaccines have been produced in times of influenza  pandemics, most recently in response to the 2009 H1N1 (Swine) Flu Virus. 
Recently, a number of quadrivalent vaccines have been licensed in the US, containing both B-strain lineages as well as variants of A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 subtypes.   
1.[ADDRESS_749173] co-circulated since 1985 [Rota et al.  1990
]. On average, influenza B strain accounts for approximately 25% of positive 
specimens in the US [ Ambrose and Levin, 2012 ]. The burden of infection is largely school

age children, young adults and older adults [ Belshe  2010 ]; however, young children 
experience the highest mortality with 34% of reported pediatric influenza deaths in the US 
due to B strain infections [ Ambrose and Levin, 2012]. Mismatches between the B strain in 
the vaccine and the circulating strain occur in approximately 5 out of every 10 influenza seasons [Belshe  2010
].   
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has estimated that in a season where there is a B strain mismatch, availability of quadrivalent influenza virus vaccines could have 
reduced annual influenza ca ses (range: 2200 –970,000), hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (range: 14–8200), 
and deaths (range: 1 –485) in the US [ Reed et al. 2012
]. 
1.1.2 2010 Southern Hemisphere Pediatric Febrile Adverse Events To Licensed CSL  
TIV 
 Note that Seqirus is now the owner of the split-virion trivalent influenza vaccine formerl y 
known as CSL TIV.  In 2010, the CSL  Southern Hemisphere trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) formulation was 
associated in Australia and New Zealand with increased postmarketing reports of fever and febrile seizures in children [ Department of Health and Ageing 2010; 
Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention 2010 ]. These reactions were predominantly in children between 6 
months to <5 years of age. However, increased postmarketing reports of febrile reactions compared with historical averages were also observed in children 5 to < 9 years of age [
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2010 ]. Since the [ADDRESS_749174] not been approved for use in children < 5 years. 
 Before the 2010 Southern Hemisphere Pediatric Adverse Events (AEs), CSL TIV was 
approved for use in children from [ADDRESS_749175] year of a 
government sponsored pediatric influenza vaccination program in Wes tern Australia (WA) in 
which CSL TIV was used. During the first two years of the WA program in which similar numbers of children were vaccinated only one febrile convulsion that was temporally related to TIV vaccination was reported [ Armstrong et al. 2011
]. 
 An increased frequency of  fever after receipt of 2009 CSL TIV compared to a US -licensed 
TIV among children 6 months to < 9 years of age was also observed in a clinical trial conducted in the [LOCATION_002] [ Brady et al. 2014
]. The adverse event summary results from 
 Clinical Study Protocol  
CSLCT -QIV -15-03 
 
Version 2- 24 MAY  2016 Confidential  Page 35 of 102  
 
 
 
this study for the two age groups 5 to < 9 years and 9 to < 18 years are also included in the 
Afluria TIV label.  
 Research conducted in 2010 using in-vitro modelling in a subgroup of children 5 years or younger with CSL TIV vaccine -related febrile convulsions, showed differences in cytokine 
production when peripheral blood mononuclea r cells  were stimulated with CSL TIV 2010 
compared with TIVs from other manufacturers [ Blyth et al. 2011
]. This research thus 
demonstrated a potential clinical mechanism for the febrile adverse events, namely a pyrogenic response mediated  by [CONTACT_167356]. 
 CSL and bioCSL conducted further intensive scientific investigations to identify the root 
cause of these AEs. Reports of the investigations, results, and conclusions have been presented to key regulatory agencies in countries where CSL TIV is licensed, including to the 
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and have been published [
Rockman, Becher et al . 
2014 , Rockman, Dyson et al. 2014 ]. 
 The conclusions from the scientific investigations indicated that a combination of the following 3 key elements were predominant factors contributing to the 2010 Southern Hemisphere pediatric AEs:  
• Strain changes, in particular, the replacement of all three virus strains in the 2009 
Southern Hemisphere vaccine formulation with the new strains for 2010 Southern 
Hemisphere  
• Degraded RNA fragments (predominantly < 200 nucleotides in length) that induced 
nuclear factor -kappa B (NF -κB), a key cellular transcription factor in cytokine 
production, and 
• Conformation of heat-sensitive viral components, such as lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], which appeared to facilitate RNA delivery.  
 
Although the presence of RNA appears to be the trigger for the febrile reactions, its delivery is key to the induction of the cytokine/chemokine signal and this appears to be dependent on the lipid level present in the final vaccine formulation. The lipid content is inversely proportional to the concentration of the detergent sodium taurodeoxycholate (TDOC), used to disrupt the virus [ Rockman, Becher et al . 2014
]. Characterization studies conducted 
examined the effect of varying the concentration of TDOC, used to split the virus during manufacture, on the NF-κB activation response. Reduction of lipi[INVESTIGATOR_570710], decreasing the NF -κB 
induction that is associated with cytokine production. This may therefore reduce the potential for pyrogenic vaccine responses mediated by [CONTACT_167356].  
 
During the sci entific investigations, the highest cytokine signal in the surrogate reactogenicity 
assays was generated by [CONTACT_941] B strain viruses, leading the company to focus on splitting 
conditions for B strains [ Rockman, Becher et al . 2014].  Based on the available 
characterization data, the trivalent vaccines used in clinical trials starting from 2014, and in 
commercially supplied vaccines from [ADDRESS_749176] -QIV -15-03 
 
Version 2- 24 MAY  2016 Confidential  Page 36 of 102  
 
 
 
TDOC concentration (1.5% w/v), which is within the company ’s registered sp litting range for 
CSL TIV.  
 
Following the conclusion of the scientific investigations after  the 2010 Southern Hemisphere 
pediatric AEs, a clinical study (CSLCT -USF-10-69) was conducted in the [LOCATION_002] in 
approximately [ADDRESS_749177]- hoc 
analysis involving pooled data across the 3 previous pediatric  TIV clinical trials (CSLCT -
USF-07-36, CSLCT- USF-06-[ADDRESS_749178]- FLU -04-05) in the same pediatric age group as 
CSLCT -USF-10-[ADDRESS_749179]- USF-10-69 was 
numerically lower compared to the historical data point estimates from the three studies. This suggests a reduction in overall fever rates after vaccination with TIV, the B strain now split with 1.5% w/v TDOC, compared to historical rates observed. As a result, all four vaccine 
strains used in Seqirus QIV studies starting from [ADDRESS_749180] been  split using 1.5% w/v 
TDOC.  
 
1.2 BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON SEQIRUS QIV 
1.2.1 Overview  
 
The Seqirus quadrivalent influenza virus vaccine ( Seqirus QIV , formerly known as bioCSL 
QIV) is a n inactivated, split-virion influenza virus vaccine formulated to contain 60 
micrograms (mcg) HA per 0.5 mL dose in the recommended ratio of 15 mcg HA for each influenza virus strain: Type A (H1N1)-like virus; Type A (H3N2)- like virus; Type B 
(Victoria lin eage) and Type B (Yamagata lineage). The Seqirus QIV formulation investigated 
in this study is consistent with the currently licensed Afluria trivalent influenza virus vaccine 
(split-virion TIV , formerly known as bioCSL TIV or CSL TIV ), except for  the addition of the 
alternate lineage influenza B strain which increases the total HA content from [ADDRESS_749181] -USF-10-69 with CSL TIV (using 1.5% TDOC w/v splitting 
for the B strain) indicated an overall reduction in fever rates (See Section 1.1.2
), all four 
vaccine strains used in Seqirus QIV paediatric studies will be split using 1.5% w/v TDOC.  
 Development of a QIV, including B strains of both lineages, is expected to improve vacci ne 
protection in target populations. Vaccine strain composition is based on the seasonal recommendations of the World Health Organization, which monitors circulating strains.  TIVs contain antigens from the B- strain lineage predicted to be most prevalent. Such 
vaccines provide limited immunity against B strains of the lineage not included in the vaccine. A further problem with TIVs is that the predominant B- strain lineage has been 
unpredictable; between 2001 and 2011, B-strain lineage predictions for inclusion in vaccines were no better than chance alone [ Ambrose and Levin, 2012
].

1.2.2 Nonclinical Evaluation   
 
Given the Seqirus QIV formulation is based on that of the company’s split-virion TIV, with the exception of the additional B strain, Seqirus QIV is expected to have a similar safety profile to that established for the TIV. Seqirus considers that formal single - or repeat -dose 
safety/toxicology studies or a reproductive toxicity study us ing the Seqirus QIV formulation 
are not required, given all of the available characterization, clinical, and nonclinical data for the company’s split-virion TIV  and the adult clinical data for the company’s QIV . Due to the 
extensive previous human experience, the predictive value of findings from animal studies is believed to be diminished in the context of the human experience with this company’s TIV 
and QIV gained thus far.  The company  has conducted a formal nonclinical toxicology study of the split-virion TIV; an 
embryofetal development study with postnatal evaluation of toxicity in rats. This study showed no observed adverse effects on mating, female fertility, pregnancy, parturition, lactation parameters, embryofetal or preweaning development; see the Investigator ’s 
Brochure for more detailed information. 
1.2.[ADDRESS_749182] previously studied in adults and older adults in 
2014 (Study CSLCT -QIV-13-01), and in children 5 through 17 years of age  in 2015 (Study 
CSLCT -QIV-13-02).   
 Study CSLCT -QIV-13-01 was a phase 3, randomized, multicenter, double-blinded 
noninferiority study to evaluate the immu nogenicity and safety of Seqirus QIV in comparison 
with th e company’s 2014-2015  US -licensed TIV  formulation  (referred to here as TIV -1), and 
a TIV containing the alternate B strain (referred to as TIV-2), in adults 18 years of age and 
above.  A total of 3485 subjects were randomized to receive either Seqirus QIV  (1742 subjects), 
TIV-1 (871 subjects ) or TIV-2 (872 subjects ).   
 Demographics and key baseline characteristics of the study population were balanced between treatment groups . In ad ults 18 years and older, Seqirus QIV was not inferior to both 
TIVs based o n adjusted GMTs (upper limit of the 2-sided 95% confidence interval [ CI] for 
the GMT ratio [TIV/QIV] ≤ 1.5) and seroconversion rates (upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI 
on difference of the TIV minus QIV  ≤ 10%). Additionally, noninferiority was shown in both 
age sub -groups, [ADDRESS_749183]- QIV-13-01 was consistent with the known 
safety profile of the company’s TIV. The proportions of subj ects with any solicited local 
adverse reaction were similar (QIV [37.4%], TIV -1 [34.6%], and TIV -2 [36.6%]), with the 
most common local adverse reaction being injection site pain (35.3%). More subjects 18 through 64 years of age experienced injection site pain [47.5%], than did subjects ≥ 65 years of age (23.2%). Proportions of subjects with any solicited systemic adverse event were also similar across the thr ee study vaccine groups (QIV [28.9%], TIV-1 [28.4%], and TIV -2 
[27.2%]). The most common systemic a dverse events were myalgia and headache (18.7% 
and 13.6% of subjects, respectively). More subjects 18 through 64 years of age [37.2%] experienced any solicited systemic adverse events than did subjects ≥ 65 years of age (18 [19.6%]). Across all three study  vaccine groups, a similar profile was observed for 
unsolicited adverse events; with headache being most commonly reported (in < 4% of subjects) .  
 During the study period (up to 180 days postvaccination), a total of 66 subjects overall (1.9%) experienced 89 serious adverse events ( SAEs ). Of these, 4 SAEs (asthma, pancreatitis 
acute, hypoxia and pneumonia), in  [ADDRESS_749184] by [CONTACT_737]. 
 
There were 6 deaths reported in the study  and 5 were considered unrelated to vaccination.  
One death of pneumonia in the ≥ [ADDRESS_749185]'s subsequent adverse event. The possible mechanism could be an idiosyncratic inflammatory or immune reaction to any of the vaccine ingredients which contributed to respi[INVESTIGATOR_570711] a subject

 Study CSLCT -QIV-13-02 is an ongoing phase 3, randomized, multicenter, observer -
blinded, noninferiority study to evaluate the immunogenicity and s afety of Seqirus QIV 
with a US -Licensed 2015- 2016 quadrivalent  inactivated comparator influenza vaccine 
(Comparator QIV) in a pediatric population 5 through 17 years of a ge. 
 
1.3 STUDY OVERVIEW  
 
The present  study is a phase 3, randomized, multicenter, observer-blinded study to evaluate 
the immunogenicity and safety of Seqirus QIV in comparison with a US-licensed 2016-2017 quadrivalent influenza vaccine (Comparator QIV) in children [ADDRESS_749186] influenza disease caused by 
[CONTACT_295588] A and types B present in the vaccine. In the US, routine annual influenza vaccination of all persons 6 months of age and older continues to be recommended 
[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013
].

The study will be conducted during the 2016-2017 Northern Hemisphere influenza immunization season in male and female children 6 months through 59 months of age. 
Subjects will be randomized to either trea tment group in a 3:1 ratio ( Seqirus QIV: 
Comparator QIV ). The randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_570744] s tudy cohorts 
(Cohort A: 6 months through 35 months of age, and Cohort B: 36 months through 59 months of age ). Age stratification will employ a quota to ensure that no more than 60% of the total 
sample subjects are represented in each age stratum. An interactive response technology 
(IRT) system will be used for subject randomization.  Subjects will receive either one or two doses of Study Vaccine (Seqirus QIV or Comparator 
QIV) as clinically indic ated, depending on their previous history of influenza virus 
vaccination, in accordance with influenza vaccination dose recommendations of the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)  for Prevention and Control of 
Seasonal Influenza with Vaccines . See Section [ADDRESS_749187] study vaccination dose by [CONTACT_570745] 
(HI) a ssay. Safety monitoring will include solicited local reactions and systemic adverse 
events (reactogenicity) for 7 days following each s tudy vaccination dose; unsolicited adverse 
events for at least [ADDRESS_749188] study vaccination dose; and cellulitis -like 
reaction s for at least [ADDRESS_749189] historically been trivalent, including variants of A/H3N2, A/H1N1, and one B- strain lineage.  
 Currently available TIVs contain antigens from the B- strain lineage predicted to be most 
prevalent.  These vaccines provide limited immunity against B strains of the lineage not included in the vaccine. Therefore, Seqirus has  developed  a quadrivalent influenza vaccine 
(QIV), containing both B-strain lineages, for prophylaxis of influenza in adults, older adults and children. QIV is expected to improve overall vaccine protection in target populations, with a therapeutic benefit over TIV through reduction in the overall B strain influenza morbidity and mortality that should occur when intermittent mis matches between the B strain 
lineages in vaccines and circulating influenza are eliminated. Seqirus QIV is formulated to 
contain 120 mcg HA per mL in the recommended ratio of 30 mcg HA /mL for each influenza 
virus strain: type A/H1N1; type A/H3N2; type B (V ictoria lineage); and type B (Yamagata

lineage). The vaccine has all four strains  split at the upper le vels of TDOC concentration 
(1.5% w/v).  
 CSLCT -QIV-15-[ADDRESS_749190] pediatric study in children 6 months through 59 months 
of age conducted with Seqirus Q IV.  Given the similarities between Seqirus TIV and QIV 
formulations
, the expected immunogenicity and safety profile of QIV in children 6 months 
through 59 months of age is substantially informed by [CONTACT_570746]. 
There is a long his tory of clinical and postmarketing use of the company’s  TIV. The safety of 
this TIV is supported by [CONTACT_570747]. The clinical efficacy of CSL TIV against laboratory- confirmed  
influenza illness has been demonstrated in adults 18 to less than 65 years of age. The efficacy of CSL TIV for the prevention of laboratory-confirmed infection due to vaccine- matched 
strains during both seasons (2008 and 2009) was 60%, with a lower bound of the 95% CI of 41%.  The CSL TIV clinical development program has also shown that CSL  TIV elicited a 
consistently robust immune response across all age groups, from six months of age and older. In children six months to less than [ADDRESS_749191] been shown to be not inferior to that 
of a US -licensed seasonal influenza vaccine.  
 Postmarketing surveillance during the 2010 Southern Hemisphere influenza season sugges ted 
a disproportionate number of reports of febrile seizures and febrile events in children administered CSL TIV , compared to previous years. The reports were predominantly from 
children six months to less than five years of age [ Department of Health and Ageing 2010
]. 
However, increased rates of febrile reactions compared with historical averages were also observed in children 5 to < 9 years of age [
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2010 ]. 
Following investigations into this safety signal, the approval for CSL  TIV for use in children 
< 5 years of age was withdrawn in markets globally.  
A TIV study (CSLCT -USF-10-69) was conducted in [ADDRESS_749192] -USF 10 -69 regarding the risk of febrile events in pediatric subjects 5 through 8 years 
of age indicated reduction in overall and severe fever rates after vaccination with the 
2014/2015 Northern Hemisphere formulation of TIV with the B strain split at the upper levels 
of TDOC concentration (1.5% w/v), compared to historical rates observed in previous pediatric clinical studies with the earlier formulation of TIV with the B strain split at a lower level of TDOC concentration. Overall, Study CSLCT -USF [ADDRESS_749193] -QIV-13-01 demonstrated that Seqirus QIV formulated with the B strain split at 
the upper levels of TDOC concentration (1.5 % w/v) elicited an immune response that wa s not

2 STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
2.1 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE AND ENDPOINT  
2.1.1 Primary Objective  
 
The primary objective of this study is  to demonstrate that vaccination with Seqirus QIV 
elicits an immune response that is not inferior to the US -licensed comparator QIV 
(Comparator QIV) containing the same virus strains as Seqirus QIV among a pediatric population [ADDRESS_749195] vaccine 
administration by [CONTACT_570748] (HI) antibody titers to the 4 viral strains included in the vaccines. 
The n oninferiority of Seqirus QIV compared to US licensed comparator QIV will be assessed 
by [CONTACT_941] 8 co -primary endpoints of geometric mean titer (GMT) and seroconversion rate (SCR) 
for each viral strain contained in the vaccines as follows:  
 
• The GMT ratio* fo r the A/H1N1 strain;  
• The GMT ratio for the A/H3N2 strain;  • The GMT ratio for the B strain (Yamagata lineage);  
• The GMT ratio for the B strain (Victoria lineage);  • The difference between the seroconversion rates  **for the A/H1N1 strain;  
• The diffe rence between the seroconversion rates for the A/H3N2 strain;  
• The difference between the seroconversion rates for the B strain (Yamagata lineage);  
• The difference between the seroconversion rates for the B strain (Victoria lineage).  
  *The GMT ratio is defined as the geometric mean of postvaccination (Study Exit Visit) HI titer for the US licensed comparator over the geometric mean of postvaccination (Study Exit 
Visit) HI titer for Seqirus QIV.  
 **The rate of seroconversion is defined as the percentage of subjects with either a prevaccination HI titer < 1:10 and a postvaccination HI titer ≥ 1: 40 or a prevaccination HI titer ≥ 1:10 and a ≥ 4-fold increase in postvaccination HI titer.  
  
 Clinical Study Protocol  
CSLCT -QIV -15-[ADDRESS_749196] IVES AND ENDPOINTS  
2.2.1 Seconda ry Objectives  
 
The secondary objectives of the study are:   
1 To assess the safety and tolerability of Seqirus QIV, in two age strata: 6 months 
through 35 months, and 36 months through 59 months , as well as overall.  
 
2 To characterize the immunogenicity of Seqirus QIV and the US-licensed comparator 
QIV in two age strata: 6 months through 35 months, and 36 months through 59 months, as well as overall. 
 
2.2.2 Secondary Endpoints  
 
Secondary Safety Endpoints: 
 
• Frequency and severity of solicited local reactions and systemic adverse events (AEs) 
for 7 days after each vaccination dose; 
• Frequency of cellulitis -like reaction s for at least 28 days after each vaccination dose; 
• Frequency and severity of unsolicited AEs for at least 28 days after each vaccination dose; 
• Frequency of serious adverse events (SAEs) for at least [ADDRESS_749197] 
vaccination dose. 
 
Secondary Immunogenicity E ndpoints:  
The humoral immune response will be assessed in terms of HI antibodies for both the Seqirus 
QIV and Comparator QIV. Serum HI antibody titers against the 4 influenza vaccine strains will be used to calculate:  
• Geometric mean titer (GMT): Geometric mean of HI titers prevaccination (Day 1) and postvaccination (Study Exit Visit);  
• Seroconversion rate: Percentage of subjects with  either a prevaccination HI titer 
< 1:10 and a postvaccination HI titer ≥ 1:40 or a prevaccination titer ≥ 1:10 and a ≥ 4-fold increase in postvaccination titer; 
• The percentage of subjects with a titer ≥40 (seroprotection rates) at Day 1 and Study Exit Visit; 
• Geometric Mean Fold increase (GMFI)***: Geometric mean -fold-titer rise from Day 
1 to Study Exit Visit.  
 
***The rate of seroprotection is defined as the proportion of subjects with an HI titer ≥1:40. 
****GMFI in antibody titer is defined as the geometric mean of the fold increase of postvaccination 
HI antibody titer over the prevaccination HI antibody titer.

CSLCT -QIV -15-[ADDRESS_749198] 7 days postvaccination in two age strata: 
[ADDRESS_749199] of the thigh, versus a US licensed comparator QIV containing the same influenza strains recommended by [CONTACT_570749] ( FDA ) and Vaccines and Related 
Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRB PAC) for the 2016-2017 season. The study 
will be conducted during the 2016-2017 Northern Hemisphere influenza immunization season in male and female subjects 6 months through 59 months of age. 
After parent (s)/guardian (s) have provided written informed consent (Visit 1 [Day 1]), eligible 
subjects will be stratified by [CONTACT_570750]: 
• Cohort A comprising subjects 6 months through 35 months of age; 
• Cohort B comprising subjects 36 months through 59 months of age. 
The Interactive Response Technology (IRT) will include a quota for each age stratum so that 
no more than 60% of the total sample size is r epresented in each age stratum.  
Subjects in the [ADDRESS_749200] of subjects (or a minimum of 300 subjects) in this age cohort have received the first vaccination and have had an opportunity to enter at lea st [ADDRESS_749201] ( DSMB ) meeting convened to review and assess the 
available safety data.  
 Recruitment in the 36 through 59 months age cohort will not be halted during the period of the data cut and DSMB review.  Enrollment in the younger age cohort (subjects 6 months 
through 35 months of age ) will only commence after the  DSMB has reviewed the safety data 
and recommended that  the study may proceed .

minimum of 300 subjects) in the [ADDRESS_749203] the 7 days of safety data 
postvaccination. A DSMB meeting will be convened once tables and listings are produced to 
review and assess the available safety data. Recru itment in the 6 through 35 months age 
cohort will not be halted during the period of the data cut and DSMB review.  
 
After stratification, subjects will be randomized to one of the two treatment groups using a 
3:1 allocation ratio to receive either Seqirus QIV or the US licensed comparator QIV  
(Figure  1). 
Subjects will provide pre- and postvaccination serological specimens as well as structured safety follow -up. 
Screening evaluations will be performed either the day of the vaccination or within a maximum of 1 week before vaccination and include medical history, and targeted physical examination (if clinically indicated). Vaccination will occur on Day 1. On Day [ADDRESS_749204] of the thigh (or the deltoid muscle if muscle mass is adequate) in children 1 2 months through 35 months of age, 
or the deltoid muscle of the non-dominant arm in children 36 months through 59 months of age. 
The parent( s)/guardian(s) of subjects will record electronically:  
1. In a “7 -Day Diary”, t he occurrence of solicited AEs, a pre-specified series of local 
reactions and systemic symptoms and temperature that may occur between Day 1 and Day 7 after a vaccination. 
2. In an “Other Body Symptom s Diary”, any unsolicited AEs that may occur 
between Day 1 and the Study Exit Visit.  
3. In a “Medication Diary”, all  concomitant medication use that may occur between 
Day 1 and the Study Exit Visit.  
Subjects will return to the clinic 2 8 (+4) days after each indicated vaccine dose (Day 29 +4). 
During this visit, entries in the 7 -Day Diary, the Other Body Symptoms Diary and the 
Medication Diary will be reviewed with the parent(s)/guardian(s) and a targeted physical examination performed as clinically indicated. For one-dose schedule subjects, Visit 2 (Day 29+4) post vaccination is the Exit Visit ( Figure 2
). For two -dose schedule subjects, Visit 3 
(Day 29+[ADDRESS_749205] second vaccination) is the Exit V isit (Figure 3 ). SAEs and adverse events of 
special interest ( AESIs ) will be collected via a telephone call at least  [ADDRESS_749206] 
vaccination dose (Day 90+7) and another at [ADDRESS_749207] vaccination dose (Day 180+7). 
 Clinical Study Protocol  
CSLCT -QIV -15-[ADDRESS_749208] completed all immunogenicity assessments and all solicited and unsolicited adverse event reporting , and results will be 
presented in an interim study report.  A final clinical study report will present all 
immunogenicity and safety data collected from the active study period and safety data through to the final evaluation ([ADDRESS_749209] vaccination dose).

3.5 PLANNED NUMBER OF SUBJECTS  
 
This study will enroll approximately  2222 subjects. The Interactive Response Technology 
(IRT) will include a quota for each age stratum so that no more than 60% of the total sample 
size is represented in each age stratum. After stratification, subjects will be randomized to one of the two treatment groups using a 3:[ADDRESS_749214] of subjects (or a minimum of 300 subjects) in the [ADDRESS_749215] of subjects (or a 
minimum of 300 subjects) in the [ADDRESS_749216] 7 days of safety data postvaccination. A DSMB meeting will be convened once tables and listings are produced to 
review and assess the available safet y data . Recruitment in both age cohort s will not be halted 
during the period of the data cut and DSMB review.  
 Adverse events contributing to enroll ment halting rules (see Section 9.7
) will be reported to 
the Spons or automatically from the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF)  in the clinical 
database.  If enrol lment halting rules are met, enrollment into the study will be halted pending 
DSMB review of the safety data, and Sponsor consideration of DSMB recommendations following the review. Independent s afety monitors at each site are not required.  
 The DSMB will:  
• Be responsible for providing recommendations to Seqirus surrounding study conduct matters that affect safety.  
• Review the safety data at designated time points and potentially ad -hoc time points and 
identify if significant safety concerns arise during the s tudy.  
• Review data that may affect subject continuation.  
• Make recommendations regarding study progression.

5.2 PACKAGING, LABELING,  SUPPLY AND STORAGE  
5.2.1 Packaging and Label ing 
 
The Study Vaccine will be packaged and labeled  according to current International 
Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Good Manufacturing Practice and GCP guidelines, and national legal requirements.  
 The manufacture and labeling of the Study Vaccine will comply with specific US Regulatory requirements . 
 
5.2.[ADDRESS_749227] party vendor contracted by [CONTACT_29322]. Syringes will be labeled and boxed in individual cartons. 
 
The Study Vaccines should be stored under temperature monitored conditions (+36°F to 
+46°F [+2°C to +8°C]) in a secure area.  Under no circumstances should the vaccines be 
frozen, as this may disrupt the antigenic immunogenicity of the viral proteins. If the container 
contents are frozen, or suspected to have been frozen, the product should not be used. In 
order to protect from light, the vaccine must be stored in its original carton until time of 
administration.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_749228] ( IRB) requirements have been 
met and will be available prior to study start. Upon receipt of the Study Vaccine, the 
Investigator/delegate will conduct an inventory and acknowledge receipt of the product.   Study Vaccines must only be used for subjects enrolled in this clinical study . The 
appropriately qualified unblinded site staff member administering the Study Vaccine must 
record the dispensing details on the Study Vaccine Administration Form provided. On completion of the study, delivery records will be reconciled with those of used and unused Study Vaccine.  
 Used syringes are to be disposed of immedi ately after use in appropriate s harps containers. 
Used cartons are to be retained for accountability purposes and are to be destroyed at site after final accountability/reconciliation has been completed at the site. Unused vaccines are to be returned to the third party vendor responsible for vaccine management for final disposal or destroyed at site provided a certificate of destruction is supplied. All relevant disposal documentation, including the certificate of destruction, wi ll be filed in the TMF and a copy 
filed-in the investigational site files.

5.4 OTHER INTERVENTION(S ) 
 
Not a pplicable.  
5.[ADDRESS_749229] identification numbers will not be reassigned or 
reused.  
6.1.2 Randomization Procedures  
 A randomization scheme will be used to ensure that the balance between the treatment groups is maintained. To ensure the study blind is maintained, delegates from the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) company, in association with a Seqirus statistician/delegate not directly involved in the analysis of study results, will prepare the study randomization code. The Stability and Environmental Monitoring group at Seqirus  will keep a checked final copy 
of the randomization code on file. Emergency Code Break IRT access will be provided to the investigational site for use in case of an emergency.  
 Subjects in the [ADDRESS_749230] of subjects (or a minimum of 300 subjects) in this age cohort have received the first vaccination and have had an opportunity to enter at least 7 days of safety data postvaccination. A safety data cut will then be performed and a DSMB meeting convened to review and assess the available safety data.  Recruit ment in the 36 through 59 
months age cohort will not be halted during the period of the data cut and DSMB review. Enrollment in the younger age cohort (subjects 6 months through 35 months of age ) will only 
commence after the DSMB has reviewed the safety data and recommended that  the study 
may proceed . 
 A second safety data cut will be performed when approximately one third of subjects (or a 
minimum of 300 subjects) in the [ADDRESS_749231] 7 days of safety data 
postvaccination. A DSMB meeting will be convened once tables and listings are produced to 
review and assess the available safety data. Recruitment in the 6 through 35 months age cohort will not be halted during the period of the data cut and DSMB review.  
 Eligible subjects will be randomized by [CONTACT_570753] 2 treatment groups in a 3:1 ratio (Seqirus QIV: Comparator QIV ) and will be proportionally balanced in the two age 
strata (6  through  35 months  and 36 through 59 months ), with no more than 60% of the total 
sample size represented in one age stratum.  The IRT system will manage randomization and 
provide to the sites a subject randomization number. The number will correspond to the appropr iate study treatment.  
 The Investigator will be supplied with a user guide for the IRT.  
6.1.3 Blinding Procedures  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Blinding Method 
 
Investigational site staff including the investigator and all personnel performing study 
assessments will be blinde d to treatment allocation (observer-blind). The subject  and 
parent (s)/ guardian (s) will also remain blinded to treatment allocation.  
 As there may be a visual difference between the Seqirus Q IV and the Comparator QIV pre-
filled syringes , personnel who prepare and administer the S tudy Vaccine will be considered 
unblinded and excluded from involvement in other study procedures, with the exception of other Study Vaccine related activities, such as receipt, preparation and accountability management . 
 All Seqirus study staff, excluding those in the Seqirus Stability and Environmental 
Monitoring group and Quality Assurance group, will also be blinded to treatment allocation. 
Study monitors will be blinded to subject  treatment allocation and will remain blinded when 
performing Study Vaccine accountability.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Breaking the Blind for an Emergency 
 
The randomization code for individual subjects may be unblinded to a site via the IRT system during the study in emergency situations for reasons of subject safety , if knowing the 
treatment assignment will change subject management. Whenever possible, the Investigator 
should consult with the Medical Monitor before unblinding the randomization code. The reason for unblinding the randomization code must be fully documented and the Investigator must follow the defined procedures provided in the Study Manual.

Version 2- 24 MAY  2016 Confidential  Page 60 of 102  
 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Planned Unblinding Procedures  
 
The randomization code will be unblinded four times: 
1. at the time of the safety analysis  after  a third of subjects or a minimum of [ADDRESS_749232] been enrolled ; 
2. at the time of the safety analysis  after  a third of subjects or a minimum of [ADDRESS_749233] completed all 
immunogenicity assessments and all solicited and unsolicited adverse event reporting;  
4. and finally, once all data (including extended follow-up for recording SAEs and 
AESIs ) have been entered into the study database for each subject and  the database 
has been locked.  
 The randomization code will be provided to the Biostatistics group  once written authorization 
of database lock has been received.  
 The first unblinding will occur  after a third of subjects or a minimum of [ADDRESS_749234] completed all 
immunogenicity assessments and all solicited and unsolicited adverse event reporting . This 
will facilitate timely analysis of immunogenicity and safety data including all solicited AEs. The results may be communicated to regulatory authorities and relevant personnel within 
Seqirus but not to personnel directly involved in monitoring the s tudy or interacting with 
investigators. The results will not be communicated to investigators.  
 A final clinical study report will present all immunogenicity and safety data collected from 
the active study period and safety data through to the final evaluation ([ADDRESS_749235] vaccination dose) . 
 Seqirus Safety personnel may unblind the randomization code for an individual subject at any time to facilitate assessment of suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) 
experienced by [CONTACT_31617] s ubject for expedited reporting to regulatory authorities. To maintain 
integrity of the study blind the Seqirus Safety personnel responsible for assessment of 
S[LOCATION_003]Rs are excluded from the Seqirus study team.

Blood sample A volume of  at least 3  mL of blood will be collected at each visit (Visit 1 
and Exit Visit).  Total volume of blood collected per subject is at least [ADDRESS_749244] 
(if ILI case definition 
met) In the event of an influenza -like illness (ILI) between Visit 1 and Exit V isit 
nasal and th roat swabs may  be collected  as follows:  
• Nasal swab from the right nostril;  
• Nasal swab from the left nostril; and  
• Throat swab. 
Nasal and throat swab specimens will be analyzed by [CONTACT_570754] A/B by [CONTACT_340084] (RT -PCR).  
 
The timing and frequency of all clinical procedures are described in the Schedule of Assessments
.  Refer to the Laboratory Manual for details about the collection, 
storage, handling and transportation of biological specimens. 
8.2 RETENTION OF SAMPLES  
 Serum retention samples will be obtained at Visit 1 and Visit 2 or 3.  Retention samples will be stored at ,  in a secure facility under appropriate storage 
conditions for a maximum of 5 years after sign- off of the C linical Study Report, after which 
retention samples will be destroyed. Retention samples may be used to perform additional serological analysis on the entire study population (or population subsets), using modified HI assays, or different assays types, including but not limited to viral microneutralization assays. Such additional assay analyses may be requested by [CONTACT_17513], or may be conducted by [CONTACT_570755] t here is a need for additional assay work to assist with the 
interpretation of the original study assay results, or to further characterize the immune response to influenza vaccination in the study population. Additionally, retention samples may be used to inform the development, performance, validation, or testing of new or modified assays to assess the serological impact of influenza vaccination. No form of genetic testing of the subject population will be performed at any time.  
 
8.3 CONCOMITANT THERAPIE S 
 
All drugs and/or procedures (including any physician -prescribed dietary supplement or 
vitamin),  currently being administered to a subject at the time of signing informed consent, 
and which continue to be taken in addition to the Study Vaccine during the Active Study 
Period, are regarded as concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_284999].
 
Concomitant medications that are being taken at the time of study enro llment should be 
initially recorded, and the reason for medication being taken should be recorded. At subsequent visits, any concomitant medications used during the active study period (from Day 1 until Exit Visit) should be recorded, and the reason for medication should be recorded. After the active study period, it is no longer necessary to routinely seek information on concomitant medications. However, if an SAE occurs after the Exit Visit, any medications

8.4.1 Screening  
 Parent(s) or legally appropriate representative must provide written informed consent before 
any study- specific assessments or procedures are performed. Written informed consent must 
be signed by [CONTACT_423]’s parent  or legally appropriate representative and the medically -
qualified Investigator (MD or Doctor of Osteopathy ) obtaining the consent. Written informed 
consent is not required for assessments or procedures performed according to standard of care (eg, for diagnosis or treatment); results from such assessments may be used in the determination of study eligibility.  
 A screening examination should be performed up to 7 days before the intended date of dosing (Day 1). If a potential subject was not enrolled into the study within [ADDRESS_749247] may attend a second screening visit (for a maximum of 
two screening visits per subject). In the event that a potential subject is screened twice, a new 
subject number will be assigned and all screening assessments must be repeated at  the second 
screening visit.  
 Subjects who complete all of these assessments and who fulfil the eligibility criteria (ie, eligible subjects) will be enrolled into the study.  If the subject is not eligible for the study, 
the primary reason for screen failure must be entered in the eCRF.  
 
Subjects will be recruited through generic advertisements or Institutional Review Board -
approved study- specific advertisements. For those potential subjects interested in 
participating in the study, an appointment will be s cheduled to allow informed consent to be 
obtained. Written informed consent can be provided by [CONTACT_3654](s)/guardian(s) of subjects up 
to [ADDRESS_749248]’s age and influenza vaccination history 
will determine the  dose and dosing regimen (a single vaccination or a two -vaccination 
regimen administered 28 days apart). The first vaccination will be administered at Visit 1 
(Day  1) and the second vaccination, if scheduled will be administered at Visit 2 (Day 29+4).

Vaccination:  As per the US ACIP guidelines for seasonal influenza vaccination, the subject’s 
age and influenza vaccination history determines the dose and dosing regimen (a single 
vaccination or a two -vaccination regimen administered 28 days apart). The first vaccination 
will be administered at Visit 1 (Day 1) and the second vaccination, if scheduled, will be administered at Visit 2 (Day 29 + 4). The Investigator/delegate will administer the study vaccine according to the randomization code into the deltoid region of the arm or into the 
anterolateral aspect of the thigh , by [CONTACT_80626]. If vaccination into the arm is 
selected, the injection will be administered where possible into the contralateral arm to which 
the blood sample was drawn.  
 Subjects will recei ve the following dose depending upon their age at the time of 
administration of the first dose of Study Vaccine:             Cohort A            6 months through 35 months of age 0.25 mL  
Cohort B  36 months through 59 months of age  0.5 mL  
 
Postvaccination:  
• Subjects will be observed for at least 30 minutes after vaccination for signs of an 
anaphylactic reaction. Appropriate medical treatment will be readily available in case of 
emergency.

emergency.  
• Parent(s)/guardian(s) will be reminded to complete the 7- Day Diary entries for the day 
of the second vaccination and for the subsequent 6 days following vaccination (total of 7 
days) , and to continue recording unsolicited AEs in the Other Body Symptoms Diary 
and concomitant medications in the Medications Diary from the day of the second 
vaccination  until the Study Exit Visit. 
• Parent(s)/guardian(s) will be reminded on how to measure axillary temperature and 
record their child’s temperature at the same time each evening, in addition to completing the diaries.  
• Parent(s)/guardian(s) will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_737]/delegate immediately 
if the subject experiences any signs or symptoms with grade 3 intensity. 
• Parent(s)/guardian(s)  will be reminded on how to recognize the signs/symptoms of an 
ILI and will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_093]/delegate immediately if the subject experiences any signs or symptoms of an ILI from Visit 2 until the Study Exit Visit.  
• An appointment will be made for each subject to return 28 + [ADDRESS_749251]-Dose 2 for a Study Exit Visit (Day 29 + 4 days after the second vaccination). 
 
Diary Reminder Telephone Call (Day 3 + 2 after the second vaccination): 
 Sites will contact [CONTACT_7078](s)/guardian(s) of subjects by [CONTACT_570736] 3 and 5 
inclusive after the second vaccination, to check that the diaries are being completed daily, and to address any questions on how to complete them correctly.  
Visit 3, Study Exit Visit (Two -dose Schedule)  
 
The Study Exit Visit for the Two -dose Schedule will occur 2 8 + 4 days after the 
administration of the second dose of Study Vaccine (Visit 2).  
The following will be undertaken and recorded at this study visit: 
• Review of the electronic diary entries ;  
• Assessment of the occurrence of any AEs, SAEs and AESIs;  
• Targeted physical examination as clinically indicated;  
• Collection of at least 3 mL blood sample.  
 
Unscheduled Visit - Influenza -like Illness (ILI) Visit  
 
Subjects reporting signs/symptoms of an ILI between Visit 1 and Study Exit Visit (Visit 2 or 
Visit 3) will be asked to attend an additional clinic visit within [ADDRESS_749252] -QIV -15-03 
 
Version 2- 24 MAY  2016 Confidential  Page 70 of 102  
 
 
 
 
The criteria for an ILI are as follows:  
• Elevated axillary temperature of  ≥ 99.5°F ( ≥ 37.5°C) or a clear history of fever or chills; 
and 
• At least one respi[INVESTIGATOR_29197], including sore throat, cough, wheezing, rhinorrhea /rhinitis ; and  
• At least one systemic symptom, including myalgia, headache, malaise and fatigue, 
diarrhea, nausea and /or vomiting , loss of appetite, and irritability . 
 To qualify as symptoms for the ILI case definition, symptoms should be either new, or for chronic symptoms, changed in severity or nature.  
 Influenza antiviral drugs (Symmetrel [amantadine], rimantadine, Tamiflu [oseltamivir] or Relenza [zanamivir]) should not be prescribed from any source until after the ILI assessment visit and the collection of respi[INVESTIGATOR_570723].  
 The site should perform an assessment to attempt to confirm a postvaccination ILI at the time of the ILI -assessment visit (the subject’s temperature and clinical symptoms should be 
assessed). Additionally, the site may also confirm a postvaccination ILI through review of the AE diaries and/or illness history reported verbally by [CONTACT_37326] a time prior to the ILI visit. Information related to confirmation of a postvaccination ILI should be recorded in the subject’s source notes.  Upon confir mation that the ILI case definition is met, the subject’s temperature will be 
assessed and attempts will be made to diagnose influenza viral infection by [CONTACT_570756]. These
 will be analyzed for laboratory confirmation of influenza A 
and/or B by [CONTACT_570757]  (RT-PCR). 
 Laboratory confirmation is more likely for specimens collected within approximately [ADDRESS_749253] nasal and throat swabs, bas ed on their clinical 
judgement of the potential value of testing specimens due to ongoing ILI symptoms.   Refer to the study -specific Nasal and Throat Swab Specimen Collection Instructions, for 
further details on collection, storage, handling and transportation of the nasal and throat swab specimens to the laboratory.  
 
Unscheduled Visit – Cellulitis -like Reaction  
 
Subjects reporting signs/symptoms of a Cellulitis -like Reaction between Day 1 and Study 
Exit Visit will be asked to attend an additional clinic v isit within 24 hours (up to 3 days if on 
a weekend) of the symptoms meeting the definition of a cellulitis -like reaction.  
 Clinical Study Protocol  
CSLCT -QIV -15-03 
 
Version 2- 24 MAY  2016 Confidential  Page 71 of 102  
 
 
 
The criteria for a Cellulitis -like Reaction are concurrent presence of all three of the following: 
• Grade 3 injection site pain; 
• Grade 3 injection site erythema; 
• Grade [ADDRESS_749254] will confirm if he or she meets or has met the cellulitis -like illness case definition postvaccination according to reported symptoms and, if 
applicable, will perform other clinical investigations as relevant according to routine clinical 
practice. Additionally, investigational site staff will assess for the presence of ulceration, abscess, or necrosis at the injection site, which will inform the application of study 
enroll ment halting rules. In the event of a possible cellulitis -like reaction, sites should 
identify a local laboratory to perform any laboratory analyses to investigate, confirm, and 
manage any confirmed cellulitis -like reactions, and  document any results in the source notes. 
8.4.4 End of Study  
 
Postvaccination Safety Follow-up Telephone Call (Day 90+7 and 180+[ADDRESS_749255]

Serious Adverse Event and AESI information will be collected for a total of 180 days (180+7 days) after administration of the last dose of study vaccine.  
 
9 ADVERSE EVENTS  
9.1 DEFINITIONS  
9.1.1 Adverse Event  
 As per the ICH guideline ( Guidance for Industry, Clinical Safety Data Management: 
Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting – ICH -E2A), an AE is any untoward 
medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this 
treatment.  An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal, clinically significant laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product.   The period of observation for all adverse events extends from the time the parent or legally 
appropriate representative gives informed consent until [ADDRESS_749256] vaccination (Exit Visit). The period of observation for serious adverse events and adverse events of 
special interest extends from the time the parent or legally appropriate representative gives 
informed consent until the end of study ([ADDRESS_749257] vaccination) – see Section 9.4
 
(Obs ervation Period for Adverse Events) for further details. 
 Clinical Study Protocol  
CSLCT -QIV -15-03 
 
Version 2- 24 MAY  2016 Confidential  Page 72 of 102  
 
 
 
 
Adverse events may include: 
• Exacerbation (ie, an increase in the frequency or severity) of a pre existing condition.  
Illness present before study entry should be recorded in the medical history section of the eCRF and only be reported as an AE if there is an increase in the frequency or severity of the condition during the study.  
• A clinical event occurring after consent but before the investigational p roduct  
administration.  
• Intercurrent illnesses with an onset after administration of the investigational p roduct. 
 
Adverse events do not include: 
• Events identified at screening that meet exclusion criteria  
• Medical or surgical procedures (the condition that leads to the procedure is the AE) 
• Situations whe re an untoward medical occurrence has not taken place.  For example:  
o Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_254785]-existing conditions, which have not worsened. 
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_254786] (eg, cosmetic surgery). 
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315] a diagnostic procedure where the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_254787]  
24 hours in duration or for normal management procedures (eg, chemotherapy). 
• Overdose of Investigational Product or any concomitant therapy that does not result in 
any advers e signs or symptoms.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Unsolicited AEs  
 
Unsolicited AEs are all other AEs and will be recorded electronically on the Other Body 
Symptoms Diary  or recorded by [CONTACT_570758] . 
 The intensity/severity of unsolicited AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_19578]’s 
parent(s)/guardian(s) and graded as follows:   Mild : Symptoms are easily tolerated and do not interfere with normal, everyday 
activities; 
Moderate: Discomfort enough to cause some interference with normal, everyday 
activities; 
Severe: Symptoms that prevent normal, everyday activities.  
 
9.1.[ADDRESS_749262] (AESI) is an event considered to be potentially associated with a 
product or product class. Monitoring and reporting AESIs is an important aspect relating to characterizing the safety profile of a product during clinical development and post-authorization phase s. As such, AESIs reported during clinical development, are considered as 
a medically important event s, worthy of reporting as a serious adverse event.  
 The proposed AESIs selected for QIV are consistent with those that are considered as either identified or potential risk associated with pharmacologica l class of influenza vaccines.  
To generate additional information on these rare adverse events, the occurrence of the 
following AESIs during the study must be reported:  • Febrile convulsion  
• Febrile delirium 
• Bell’s palsy  
• Demyelinating disorders  
• Encephalomyelitis  
• Guillain -Barré syndrome 
• Optic neuritis  
• Transverse myelitis  
• Thrombocytopenia • Vasculitis  
 
All AESIs must be reported as the same manner as an SAE (see Section 9.6
).  All AESIs will 
be recorded in the AE and SAE pages of the eCRF.  An SAE Reporting Form must be submitted to Seqirus Product Safety. On the SAE page of the eCRF, there is a seriousness 
criteria checklist (see 
Section 9.1.3 ). For AESIs,  the “medically significant" criteria must be 
selected  on the SAE criteria checklist. Any other criteria may also be selected as applicable. 
 Clinical Study Protocol  
CSLCT -QIV -15-03 
 
Version 2 -  24 MAY  2016 Confidential  Page 76 of 102  
 
 
 
Additional clinical information regarding an AESI may be requested from the investigator to 
ascertain the diagnosis according to the available scientific literature or established case 
definition.  All AESIs will be reviewed for signal evaluation by [CONTACT_570759]. 
9.1.3 Serious Adverse Event s 
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any 
dose: 
• Results in death – The event must be the cause of death for the SAE  to meet this serious 
criterion;  
• Is life -threatening  – The term “life -threatening” refers to an event in which the subject 
was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically might have caused death if it had been more severe;  
• Requires  in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  – 
Seqirus considers “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]” for at least  24 hours as the defining criterion for an SAE. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489199] (eg, chemotherapy ) are not considered as 
defining criteria for SAEs.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity . 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect . 
• Is medically significant  – A medically significant event is defined as an event that does 
not necessarily meet any of the SAE criteria, but which is judged by a physician to potentially jeopardize the subject or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes listed as an SAE criterion. 
• Is the suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a medicinal product . 
 
Adverse events that do not fall into the above categories are defined as nonserious AEs.

Version 2 -  24 MAY  2016 Confidential  Page 77 of 102  
 
 
 
9.2 SEVERITY OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
The severity of each AE (ie, nonserious and serious AEs) is to be assessed as follows:  
 
Severity  Definition  
Mild  A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention.  The event does not generally interfere with usual activities 
of daily liv ing. 
Moderate A type of AE that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention.  The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing 
discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject. 
Severe   A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention. 
Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium Study Data Tabulation Model (CDISC SDTM ) Severity 
Intensity Scale for Adverse Event Terminology  
 
9.[ADDRESS_749263] always be assessed by [CONTACT_3786]. All solicited local AEs will be assessed as related to the Study V accine. All 
other AEs will be classified as either related  or not related  to the Study Vaccine. If a 
causality assessment is not provided for an AE (including an SAE), the AE will be considered related to the Study Vaccine . 
 The degree of certainty with which an AE is attributed to the Study Vaccine or an alternative cause (eg, natural history of the underlying disease, concomitant therapy) will be determined by [CONTACT_1004]:  
• Known pharmacology of the Study Vaccine; 
• Clinically and/or pathoph ysiologically plausible context;  
• Reaction of a similar nature previously observed with similar products, or reported in the literature for similar products as being product related (eg, hea dache, facial flushing, 
pallor);  
• Plausibility supported by [CONTACT_254847] (eg, the event being related by [CONTACT_570760], drug withdrawal or 
reproduced on rechallenge). 
  
 Clinical Study Protocol  
CSLCT -QIV -15-[ADDRESS_749264] vaccination (the Exit Visit).  
 The observation period for SAE and AESI reporting in an individual subject will start at the time of giving written informed consent for participation in the current study and finish [ADDRESS_749265] also be reported to Seqirus Safety - see Section 9.6
 (Serious 
Adverse Event Reporting). 
 
9.5 ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING  
9.5.1 Adverse Events  
 
At each clinical evaluation, the investigator (or delegate) will determine whether any AEs have occurred.  AEs will be recorded in the AE page of the eCRF. If known, the medical diagnosis of an AE should be recorded in preference to the listing of individual signs and symptoms.    If, during the study period, a subject presents with a relevant medical history  that was not 
noted at the time of study entry, the condition should be retrospectively recorded in the Medical History section of the eCRF.  
 For AE re porting, the study period is defined as that time period from the signature [CONTACT_570781]. Therefore, events that occur before the initial screening visit will be recorded in the medical history and events that occur a fter the signing 
of the informed consent form will be recorded as an AE.  
9.5.[ADDRESS_749266] be reported as the same manner as an SAE (see Section 9.6
) 
9.6 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
 This study will comply with all applicable regulatory requirements and adhere to the full requirements of ICH Topic E2A (Cl inical Safety Data Management: Definitions and 
Standards for Expedited Reporting).  
 Clinical Study Protocol  
CSLCT -QIV -15-03 
 
Version 2 -  24 MAY  2016 Confidential  Page 79 of 102  
 
 
 
For SAEs occurring during the study, the investigator or delegate will enter all relevant 
information in the AE/SAE page of the eCRF. If entry into the eCRF is not possible (eg, because of an internet access problem), a paper SAE data collection form must be completed.  
 
All SAEs that occur during the observation period for SAEs (from the time of Informed 
Consent to Day 180, see section 9.4), whether or not considered causally related to Study 
Vaccine, MUST BE REPORTED IMMEDIATELY (within 24 hours of becomi ng aware 
of the event) to Seqirus . Adverse events occurring in the period between the time of 
provision of written informed consent and the first exposure to the Study Vaccine that meet 
one or more of the seriousness criteria for AEs must be reported to Se qirus Safety in the same 
manner as other SAEs and will be included in the clinical study database.  Any SAE that occurs after the Day [ADDRESS_749267] be reported immediately (ie, within 24 hours of 
the Investigator becoming aware of the event) to Seqirus . 
 Prompt notification is essential so that regulatory requirements for SAE reporting and ethical 
obligations to the subjects involved in the study can be met.  
 Guidance for reporting SAEs will be provided to study sites before the study starts. Details for reporting of SAEs will be described in the SAE reporting plan and eCRF completion 
guidelines.  Seqirus Safety contact [CONTACT_570761]:

Email:     ProductSafety@ biocsl. com.au 
 
9.6.1 Requirements for Immediate Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
 
For SAEs occurring during the study the Investigator/delegate will complete the AE/SAE page and other relevant pages of the eCRF. The Investigator/delegate must include all relevant information regarding the event.  The minimum reporting requirements for immediate reporting of SAEs include: 
• Identifiable subject.  
• Suspected medicinal product and / or procedure. 
• Event term.  
• Identifiable reporting source.  
 
If the minimum requirements for reporting are fulfilled, the Investigator should not wait to 
receive additional information to fully document the event before notifying Seqirus.  
 Clinical Study Protocol  
CSLCT -QIV -15-[ADDRESS_749268]: 
• Report all SAEs to the relevant IRB / IEC within the timeframe specified by [CONTACT_1201] / 
IEC. 
• Submit follo w-up reports to Seqirus Safety  until the SAE has resolved, or, in the case of 
permanent impairment, until stabilized.  
• Ensure that the causality assessment for all SAEs is entered in the eCRF.  
 
When submitting SAE reports and any other related reports (eg, discharge summaries) to 
Seqirus, subjects should be identified only by [CONTACT_570762].  The investigator should not include the subject’s name, date of birth, or address.  In cases of death, the investigator should supply Seqirus and  the IRB (as applicable) with any 
additional information as it becomes available (eg, autopsy reports and detailed medical reports).  
 The procedure to be followed if an ongoing AE becomes an SAE after the end of the observation period for AEs is described in Section 9.9
 (Follow-up of Adverse Events).  
9.[ADDRESS_749269]  (DSMB ) will monitor subject safety during 
the study. The DSMB will comprise clinical study experts with experience in vaccine studies and safety assessment. The DSMB will provide recommendations for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_570708].  
Enrolment into the study and study vaccination will be halted for DSMB review/ recommendation for continuation if during the 7 days after vaccination (Day 1 to Day 7) any of the following occur:  
• One or more subject experiences an AE that is serious, unexpected, and is assessed as related to Study Vaccine;  
• One or more subject experiences an AE that is life- threatening or causes death;  
• One or more subject experiences  a serious febrile AE, defined as any AE meet ing 
seriousness criteria that is also associated with a fever of  ≥ 101.3°F  / ≥ 38.5°C (axillary). 
• One or more of the subjects experiences a severe (grade 3)  
• allergic reaction (eg, hives, angioedema, allergic asthma, systemic anaphylaxis);  
• Vaccine- related i njection site ulceration, abscess, or necrosis; 
Additionally, enrolment into the study and study vaccination will be halted pending review by [CONTACT_570742] 1 to Day 7, the following defined halting rule criteria are met in either study cohort (6 months through 35 months or 36 months through 59 months): 
• ≥ 5% of subjects enrolled to date, with concurrent grade 3 pain, erythema, and induration (a cellulitis -like reaction) that is assessed as related to Study Vaccine.  
 Clinical Study Protocol  
CSLCT -QIV -15-03 
 
Version 2 -  24 MAY  2016 Confidential  Page 81 of 102  
 
 
 
(Note: If the total number of subjects enrolled to date is less than 60, a minimum of 3 
subjects experiencing a concurrent severe vaccine -associated pain, erythema or 
induration will be needed to halt further enrolment); 
• ≥ 5% of subjects enrolled to date experience a fever of ≥101.3°F/ ≥ 38.5°C (axillary) 
that is assessed as related to Study Vaccine.  
 (Note: if the total number of subjects enrolled to date is less than 60, a minimum of 3 subjects is required to trigger the halt). 
In addition, the DSMB chair will be immediately notified of a ny SAE, regardless of causality 
or expectedness assessment, occurring during Day [ADDRESS_749270] ing the necessity of a DSMB meeting and/or study halt in 
response to these events.  
Any decision to terminate the study will be made by [CONTACT_570763], 
and the study i nvestigators.  
 
9.7.1 Overdose  
 
Details (ie, volume, loca tion of injection) of overdose of the investigational product or any 
concomitant therapy must be recorded in the eCRF. Any overdose that is considered by [CONTACT_570764], see Section 9.6
 (Serious 
Adverse Event Reporting).  
9.7.2 Pregnancy and Lactation  
 
Not applicable.  
9.8 IRB / IEC REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 The time frame within which an IRB must be notified of deaths and investigational product-
related unexpected SAEs  is stipulated by [CONTACT_9906] .  It is the I nvestigator’s responsibility to 
comply with  the requirements for IRB notification.  Seqirus will provide I nvestigators with 
all details of all SAEs reported to regulatory authorities.  
9.9 FOLLOW -UP OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
 Every effort should be made to follow-up subjects who continue to experience an AE or an SAE on completion of the study until either the AE resolves or stabiliz es, whichever is 
sooner.  All follow -up information (and attempted follow-up contacts) should be documented 
in the subject’s medical records.  Details of SAE follow-up should also be submitted to 
Seqirus Safety . 
 
 
 Clinical Study Protocol  
CSLCT -QIV -15-[ADDRESS_749271] characteristics to be evaluated will include:  
 
• Demographic data (eg, date of birth, age, sex, race, ethnicity) 
• Medical history and documentation of r elevant medical history , defined as 1) any current 
medical condition ongoing at the time of signing ICF; 2) any recent or past medical 
history, which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_570724]’s eligibility, study safety or immunogenicity outcomes.  Relevant medical h istory 
can also include any medical history that contributes to the understanding of an AE that occurs during study participation, if it represents an exacerbation of an underlying disease/preexisting problem.  
• Influenza vaccination history 
• Body weight and axillary temperature  
• Current/c oncomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] . 
 
10.2 EFFICACY (IMMUNOGENICITY) ASSESSMENTS  
 
Efficacy assessment involves the assessment of immunogenicity on the basis of HI antibody titer to each strain , performed on serum specimens taken at Day 1 (Visit 1) and at the Study 
Exit Visit (Visit 2 – single dose schedule or Visit 3 – two -dose schedule). 
  Immunogenicity will be expressed as:  
• HI antibody titer for each strain:  All analyses involving HI antibod y titer (namely GMT 
within a tre atment group) will be based on the log scale and the resultant summary 
statistic back -transformed to derived GMT; 
• Seroconversion: For each strain the subjects will be classified as ‘ seroconverted’  if either 
they have a prevaccination  HI antibody titer < 1:10 and a postvaccination HI antibody 
titer ≥ 1:40 or a prevaccination  H1 antibody titer ≥ 1:10 and a ≥ 4-fold increase in 
postvaccination H1 antibody titer. Otherwise they will be classified as ‘not seroconverted’; 
• Seroprotection: For each strain a subject will be classified as ‘seroprotected’ if their HI 
antibody titer ≥ 1:[ADDRESS_749272] both antibody 
titers  ≥ 1:40 they will be classified as ‘not seroprotected’; 
• Fold increase : For each strain the fold increase for each subject will be calculated by 
[CONTACT_570765]; 
• Covariate adjusted analyses will be performed as outlined in the Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP)

11 STATISTICS  
11.1 SAMPLE SIZE ESTIMATI ON 
 
Statistical considerations for sample size calculations:  
Seqirus QIV will be tested against a US licensed comparator QIV. The treatment 
randomization ratio is 3:1 (Seqirus QIV: Comparator QIV). This study is designed to achieve 
at least 80% power to demonstrate noninferiority for all of the 8 co- primary endpoints, 
seroconversion rates for 4 strains, GMT for 4 strains using a one-sided alpha of 0.025 for each comparison. No adjustment for multiple endpoints was made.  For comparisons of SCR a noninferiority margin of 10% (Seqirus QIV  - Comparator QIV) will be employed. It is 
assumed that the SCR for all strains for QIV is 50% and that there is no difference between Seqirus QIV and Comparator QIV. 
 For comparison of GMT ratio a noninferiority margin of 1.5 (Comparator QIV/ Seqirus QIV, 
equivalent to a difference on the log scale of 0.405465108) will be employed. It is assumed 
that there is no difference between Seqirus QIV and Comparator QIV (ie, a ratio of 1, difference on the log scale of 0) and that the standard deviation of log (titer) is 1.4.  
 Under these assumptions and with n evaluable = 1500 in the Seqirus QIV group and 500 in 
the Comparator QIV the power for 4 GMT ratio endpoints is 99.95% and the power for 4 SCR endpoints is 89.70%. The overall global power of the 8 endpoints is then 89.7% x 99.95% = 89.66%. 
 This provides a total N evaluable = 2000 (with 10% dropouts N=2222).  Sample size 
calculations were performed using SAS v9.[ADDRESS_749275] -QIV -15-03

11.3.2 Study Analyses 
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Analysis  
 
Primary Objective  
 
The primary objective is to demonstrate that vaccination with Seqirus QIV elicits an immune response that is not inferior to the US- licensed comparator QIV containin g the same virus 
strains as Seqirus QIV among a pediatric population 6 months through 59 months of age. 
 
Primary Endpoints:  
 
Co-primary immunogenicity endpoints of geometric mean titer (GMT) and seroconversion 
rate for each virus strain contained in the vaccine will be assessed.  The rate of seroconversion 
is defined as the percentage of subjects with either a prevaccination hemagglutinin inhibition 
(HI) titer < 1:10 and a postvaccination HI titer ≥ 1:40 or a prevaccination titer ≥ 1:10 and a ≥ 4-fold incre ase in postvaccination titer.  
 
The noninferiority of Seqirus QIV compared to the US licensed comparator QIV will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_941] 8 co -primary endpoints of GMT and seroconversion rate. 
 In line with the FDA Guidance on seasonal inactivated influenza vaccines (Guidance for 
Industry Clinical Data Needed to Support Licensure of Seasonal Inactivated Influenza 
Vaccines 2007) , Seqirus  QIV will be considered to be noninferior to the US licensed 
comparator QIV for each strain if:  
• The upper bound of the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) on the ratio of the GMTs does not exceed 1.5. The GMT ratio will be calculated by [CONTACT_570740] / 
GMT  Seqirus QIV 
  
• The upper bound of the two- sided 95% CI on the difference between the 
seroconversion rates does not exceed 10%.  The difference in seroconversion rate will be calculated by (Seroconversion 
Comparator  QIV – Seroconversion   Seqirus QIV). 
 
To determine the GM T ratio (adjusted analysis) a general linear model (GLM) will be fitted 
on log transformed postvaccination HI titer (titer) as the outcome variable and with inclusion of covariates such as vaccine treatment, prevaccination HI titer, age stratum, sex, vacci nation 
history, age- by-vaccine interaction  and study site. 
 From the model an adjusted difference in least -square means (on the log scale) will be 
produced with 95% confidence limits. The estimated difference and the confidence limits will be back transformed to obtain an adjusted GMT ratio with 95% confidence limits. Each of the four strain s will be analyzed separately. The adjusted GMT ratio will be the result for 
which the noninferiority assessment will be based on. The measure of the unadjusted GMT 
ratio based on postvaccination GMTs only will also be presented. 
 Clinical Study Protocol  
CSLCT -QIV -15-03 
 
Version 2 -  24 MAY  2016 Confidential  Page 89 of 102  
 
 
 
 
If all 8 co -primary endpoints result in a conclusion of noninferiority then overall 
noninferiority of Seqirus QIV compared to the US licensed comparator QIV  will be 
concluded.  This assessment will be conducted overall (the primary endpoint).  In mathematical notation the statistical hypotheses to be tested for the primary immunogenicity analysis corresponds to: 
 
H0: Ri > 1.5, for any strain Ha: Ri ≤ 1.5, for all strain 
 and 
H0: Di > 10, for any strain  
Ha: Di ≤ 10, for all strain 
 
     where Ri is any of the [ADDRESS_749279] immunogenicity dose GMT ratios:  
 
• (US licensed comparator QIV ) /  Seqirus QIV  for B/Yamagata strain  
• (US licensed comparator QIV ) /  Seqirus Q IV for B/Victoria strain  
• (US licensed comparator QIV ) / Seqirus QIV  for A/H1N1 strain  
• (US licensed comparator QIV ) / Seqirus QIV  for A/H3N2 strain  
 
and Di is the [ADDRESS_749280]- dose SCR difference, namely : 
 
• (US licensed comparator QIV ) -  Seqirus QIV  for B/Yamagata strain  
• (US licensed comparator QIV ) -  Seqirus QIV  for B/Victoria strain  
• (US licensed comparator QIV ) - Seqirus QIV for A/H1N1 strain  
• (US licensed comparator QIV ) - Seqirus QIV  for A/H3N2 strain . 
 No adjustment will be made for multiple comparisons. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Analyses  
 
Secondary Objectives:  
 
The secondary objectives of the study are:  
 1. To assess the safety and tolerability of Seqirus QIV, in two age strata: [ADDRESS_749281] -QIV -15-03 
 
Version 2 -  24 MAY  2016 Confidential  Page 90 of 102  
 
 
 
2. To characterize the immunogenicity of Seqirus QIV and  the US -licensed comparator QIV 
in two age strata: 6 months through 35 months and, 36 months through 59 months, as 
well as overall.  
Secondary Endpoints:  
 
Secondary safety endpoints: 
 AEs will be monitored after vaccination as per the following;  
• Frequency  and severity of solicited local adverse reactions and systemic adverse 
events (AEs) for 7 days (ie, day of vaccination and 6 subsequent days) after each vaccination dose; 
• Frequency of c ellulitis -like reaction for at least  28 days a fter each vaccination dose;  
• Frequency  and severity of unsolicited AEs for at least 28 days (ie, day of vacci nation 
and 27 subsequent days) after each vaccination dose; 
• Frequency of serious adverse events (SAEs) for [ADDRESS_749282] vaccination dose. 
 
For all solicited AEs the following summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_570767]:  
 
• The number and percentage of subjects reporting at least one occurrence of each type of adverse event will be presented with 95% CIs. 
• The number and percentage of subjects experiencing at least one local reaction will be presented with 95% CIs. 
• The number and percentage of subjects experiencing at least one systemic adverse event will be presen ted with 95% CIs. 
 For each of these summaries the relative risk and 95% CIs will be presented for Seqirus QIV/ Comparator QIV.  All summaries will be presented overall and by [CONTACT_11196] . Analyses will be 
repeated by [CONTACT_570768]/ethnicity  where specified.  
 Unsolicited AEs will be coded using the current version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA ). The number (and percentage) of subjects experiencing at 
least one event (ie, the incidence) of unsolicited AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_570769]. All summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_570770]. Analyses will be repeated by [CONTACT_570768]/ethnicity  where 
specified.

Secondary immunogenicity endpoints 
The humoral immune response will be assessed in terms of HI antibodies for both Seqirus 
QIV and the QIV comparator.  Serum HI antibody titers against the 4 influenza vaccine strains will be used to calculate:  
• GMTs : Geometric mean of HI titers prevaccination  (Day 1) and postvaccination  
(Study Exit Visit);  
• SCRs : Percentage of subjects with either a prevaccination  HI titer < 1:10 and a 
postvaccination HI titer ≥ 1:40 or a prevaccination  titer ≥ 1:10 and a ≥ 4- fold increase 
in postvaccination titer ; 
• The percen tage of subjects with a titer ≥40 (seroprotection rates) at Day 1 and at 
Study Exit Visit;  
• Geometric mean fold increase (GMFI)* : Geometric mean fold titer rise from Day 1 to 
Study Exit Visit. 
*GMFI in antibody titer is defined as the geometric mean of the fold increa se of 
postvaccination HI antibody titer over the prevaccination HI antibody titer. 
 
For each treatment group (each age stratum as well as overall) for each strain summary tables will be presented for GMT (mean and 95% CIs), seroprotection rates (number and percentage of subjects) at Day 1 and Study Exit Visit, Day 2 8, SCR (number and percentage of subjects 
at Study Exit Visit ) and GMFI (mean and 95% CIs). 
 
The distribution of antibody titers 6 months through 35 months of age, 36 months through 59 
months of age, as well as overall will be displayed graphically using   reverse cumulative 
distribution (RCD) curves. Separate RCD curves following the first and second vaccinations will also be displayed.  
 
Further specifics of the sta tistical analyses will be detailed in the SAP.

14.3 IMPLEMENTATION OF TH E PROTOCOL / PROTOCOL AMENDMENT(S)  
 
With the exception of medical emergencies, no changes or deviations in the conduct of the signed protocol will be permitted without documented approval of Seqirus and the IRB.  In the event of a medical emergency, the I nvestigator at the study site will institute any medical 
procedures deemed ap propriate. However, all such procedures must be promptly reported to 
the Seqirus Medical Monitor and the IRB. 
 Modifications to the protocol that may affect subject safety or the way the study is to be conducted will be documented in a protocol amendment, which must be approved by [CONTACT_1201]. 
 Administrative changes to the protocol, defined as minor corrections and/ or clarifications that 
have no effect on the way the study is to be conducted, will not require IRB approval, but will be submitted to the IRB for their information. 
14.4 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
 
A protocol deviation is any change, divergence, or departure from the study design or 
procedures defined in the protocol. As a result of deviation, corrective action should be developed by [CONTACT_3483].   These practices are consistent  with ICH Good Clinical Practice (GCP ICH E6): 
4.5 Compliance with Protocol, sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2 and 4.5.3 5.1 Quality Assurance and Quality Control, section 5.1.1 5.20 Noncompliance, sections 5.20.1 and 5.20.2  ICH GCP does permit deviations from the protocol by [CONTACT_570775], but this should not be related to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. No prospective protocol deviations (waivers) will be granted during the study.   All instances  where the requirements of the study protocol were not complied with will be 
recorded and tracked.  Protocol deviations should be reported to the IRB in accordance with 
their guidelines. Additionally, any major protocol deviations should be reported to Seqirus (or delegate) as soon as possible.  Major protocol deviations  are deviations that could significant ly affect  the subject’s safety, 
rights, or welfare and/or significantly impact the completeness, accuracy and reliability of the 
study data. Examples of major protocol deviations include enrolling subjects in violation of inclusion/exclusion criteria defined in the protocol, or failing to collect prevaccination or postvaccination blood samples.

Explanation about the meaning of the primary outcome was added in 
measurement and data collection (page 10): The diagnostic criteria of acute lung 
injury (ALI) has traditionally relied on clinical findings and PaO 2/FIO2 ratio14. 
PaO 2/FIO2 ratio describes the severity of lung injury (e.g. PaO 2/FIO2 ≤300 for ALI 
and ≤200 for acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505]). Recently, SaO 2/FIO2 has been 
accepted as a surrogate for PaO 2/ FiO 2 ratio on the diagnosis of adults with acute 
lung injury and ARDS.15,16,17 Noticeable, previous work demonstrated that a 
PaO2/FiO2 decrease of 10% from  baseline was clinically meaningful of lung injury. 
18, 19, 20 Therefore, we decide to use SaO 2/FIO2 ratio because: 1) it avoids invasive 
blood sampling, 2) t here is evidence that SaO2/F IO2 is a reliable substitute for 
PaO 2/FIO2 with good sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing lung injury, including 
ALI and ARDS,17,21,22 and 3) a 10% difference on SaO 2/FIO2 between groups may 
be indicative of differences the level of lung injury induced by [CONTACT_657904] .

Background  
Anesthesia  and mechanical ventilation cause  pathophysiological respi[INVESTIGATOR_657882] . Postoperative pulmonary 
complications are common after anesthesia, and cause  substantial  morbidity and 
mortality1 that worsen  clinical outcomes . Pulmonary complications also augment  the cost 
of a surgery 2 -12-fold.2 The Cleveland Clinic Perioperative Health Documentation System 
database  indicates that  postoperative pulmonary complications occur after 5 -10% of all 
surgeries , and  that those complications  are associated with in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380], 
prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  30-day readmission , and higher overall cost.3,[ADDRESS_887043] become a key  quality and safety metric for  [LOCATION_002]  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] .5 
The twin — and potentially contradictory — goals of mechanical ventilation are 
adequate gas exchange and prevent ion of  iatrogenic lung injury. Two key ventilator 
settings are tidal volume and  positive end -expi[INVESTIGATOR_27111]  (PEEP ). Traditionally 
generous  tidal volumes  (i.e., 10-12 ml/kg  of predicted body weight – PBW ) were  routine  
as high volumes  preve nts atelectasis and improve  oxygenation. But relatively recently,  
restricted  tidal volumes  (i.e., 4-8 ml/kg  PBW ) were proven  beneficial in  critical care  
patients with acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505]/acute lung injury  who were ventilated 
for days .[ADDRESS_887044] since  been inconsistently  adapted for operating 
room use  — despi[INVESTIGATOR_657883] -existing lung disease  
and are usually ventilated for only a few hours .  
Restricted  intraoperative  tidal volumes improve breathing mechanics and reduce 
the risk of postoperative  reintubation  after cardiac surgery .[ADDRESS_887045]  20, 2020 multicenter randomized trial  of 400 patients , protective lung ventilation (tidal volume  6-
8 ml/kg PBW  and 6 -8 cm H 2O PEEP)  was compared with conventional ventilation (tidal 
volume  10-12 ml/kg  PBW  and no PEEP)  in patients having  major abdominal surgery  who 
were at  intermediate -to-high risk of postoperative complications . There were fewer  
pulmonary and extra -pulmonary complications  in patients assigned to protective 
ventilation .  
In contrast , the PROVHILO trial compared the effects of high (12 cm H 2O) vs low  
(<2 cm H 2O) PEEP during  open abdominal surger y and found no difference in postop 
pulmonary complications . Furthermore,  patients assigned to  high PEEP had more 
intraoperative hypotension requiring treatment.10 The PROVHILO results are consistent 
with a systematic review by [CONTACT_657905] . that included  2,299 patient from three trials 
(ALVEOLI, LOVS,  and EXPRESS)  in which PEEP did not influence  in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_657884] -ARDS patients , leading the  authors to conclude that  high PEEP  may be harmful in 
patients without ARDS.[ADDRESS_887046] practitioners and 
patients.  For example , between  2007 -2016 at the Main Campus,  18% of patients were 
ventilated with tidal volumes exceeding 10  mL/kg PBW.  Patients presenting for 
orthopedic surgeries are typi[INVESTIGATOR_657885], and often deb ilitated. Comorbidities are 
common, including cardiac  and pulmonary  disease, thus putting orthopedic patients at 
special ri sk for postoperative pulmonary complications. Curiously, no  substantive trials of 
ventilator management in orthopedic patients have been published.   
As part of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a care pathway  for Cleveland Clinic  orthopedic surgical 
patients , we thus propose a research project to evaluate common ly used  ventilator 
settings . Both the anesthesia and surgical teams have agreed to the proposed project , 
and representatives are designated co -investigators . While the results will presumably  be 
published, our primary goal is to test the potential clinical consequences of switching to a 
standard ized ventilation strategy in this unique patient population. We will use a non -
randomized  alternating intervention  cohort approach, restricted to the physically dis tinct 
orthopedic surgery unit (H operating rooms 32 -37) on the Main Campus.

for patients having  elective orthopedic surger y.  
Primary objective : 
Evaluate the effects of various ventilation strategies , tidal volume at 6 versus 10 
ml/kg of PBW and PEEP at 5 versus 8 cmH 20, on oxygenation in the postoperative care 
unit, defined by [CONTACT_657906]2/FIO2 ratio, a validated measure of acute lung injury.12   
Secondary  objective:  
To evaluate the effects of various ventilation strategies on : 
1. A composite of serious  postoperative pulmonary complications ;  
2. Oxygenation  in surgical  ward s, defined by  [CONTACT_657907] 2/FIO2 ratio; 
3. Postoperative duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] .  
 
Exploratory  objective:  
1. Time from extubation to f irst oxygen satu ration on ambient air breathing  
2. Intraoperative e stimated blood loss  and perioperative transfusions.   
 
[ADDRESS_887048]  four designated ventilation 
settings which include two tidal volumes and two PEEP levels  (Table 1 ). At the end of the 
four-week sequence, the  entire  sequence will be repeated [ADDRESS_887049] a waived consent  because: 1) obtaining individual consent would be 
nearly impossible for the number of patients required; 2) the interventions we propose are 
well within national and local standards -of-care and used routinely at the Cleveland Clinic; 
3) the interventions a re low risk; 4) clinicians are free to modify ventilation parameters as 
they see fit in individual patients. From a practical perspective, this unfunded research  
project will not be feasible except as an alternating intervention  trial with waived consent.  
Inclusion criteria:  
1. Patient  age ≥ 18 years old;  
2. Surgery  in orthopedic operating rooms 32-37; 
3. General anesthesia with e ndotracheal intubation . 
 
Exclusion criteria:  
1. Non-ortho pedic  procedures ; 
2. Intubation before induction of anesthesia.  
 
 
[ADDRESS_887050]  20, 2020 Study procedures  
Four combinations of PEEP and tidal volume  (Vt) will be used in patients  having  
orthopedic  surgery  with general anesthesia , endotracheal intubation , and mechanical 
ventilation . Designated t idal volume s and PEEP levels  were selected on the basis of  
previous studies12 and after discussion with Clinic  orthopedic anesthesiologists . All are 
well within the range of  ventilator setting commonly used in orthopedic patients at the 
Clinic . The following su ggested ventilatory parameters will be suggested during each 
study month :

4 10 8 
 
As usual, predicted  body weight ( PBW ) will be used to determine tidal volume , and charts 
will be provided  in each  orthopedic operating room . To calculate PBW  we’ll use the 
formula which was used by [CONTACT_657908]39 as following:  
Male  50 + 0.9 1(centimeters of height – 152.4); 
Female  45.5 + 0.9 1(centimeters of height – 152.4). 
Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_657886] 50%, per Clinic routine . However , 
enough oxygen will always be given to maintain oxygen saturation (as determined by 
[CONTACT_406] ) ≥ 95%. The r espi[INVESTIGATOR_657887] -tidal partial 
carbon dioxide  partial  pressure between 35  and 45 mmHg , with a default inspi[INVESTIGATOR_5697] -to-
expi[INVESTIGATOR_657888] 1:2.    
Recruitment  maneuver s are designed to re -expand atelectasis  and are considered 
good clinical practice . Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], a recruitment maneuver would be to maintain  a constant 
airway pressure of  40-45 cmH 2O for  40 seconds13. Clinicians will be asked to perform a 
recruitment maneuver after induction of anesthesia at a FIO2 of 50%, and shortly  before 
extubation . Intraoperative  driving pressure  Driving pressure , plateau pressure minus 
positive end -expi[INVESTIGATOR_27111] (Pplat – PEEP) , will be kept  less than  [ADDRESS_887051]  20, 2020 Measurements  and Data collection  
All data will be obtained  from the Cleveland Clinic Perioperative Health 
Documentation System  (PHDS)  and the Clinic’s  Electronic Medical Record  (EMR) . 
Demographic and morphometric c haracteristics will be recorded including age, sex, race,  
weight, height , and body mass index . We will also consider  risk factors which may 
increase chance of pulmonary complications  including  American Society of 
Anesthesiologists physical  status, preoperative comorbidities , smoking history . 
Types of surgery will be characterized from ICD -[ADDRESS_887052] pressures, inspi[INVESTIGATOR_619039] , expi[INVESTIGATOR_657889], S aO2, blood pressure , transfused blood products, iv fluid types 
and volumes given during surgery, vasoactive medication needs,  and duration  of surger y.  
We will register in redcap database all patients excluded from the study due to:  
- Patients decision  
- Anesthesiology decision  
- Surgeon decision  
Other Respi[INVESTIGATOR_657881]. Thus we will exclude the tidal volume and PEEP values within 
15 minutes from the after intubation and before extubation.

[ADDRESS_887053]  20, 2020 Primary outcome  
The primary outcome will be time-weighted average  SaO2/FIO [ADDRESS_887054]-
anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) during the first postoperative hour . SaO 2 is monitored 
continuously in the PACU  by [CONTACT_406] . FIO2 will be estimated from the type of device 
and the oxygen flow  rate, using the following conversion table  (Table 3 ). We will assume 
that the F IO2 remains at the same level until the time of next record.  
The diagnostic criteria of  acute lung injury (ALI)  has traditionally relied on clinical 
findings  and PaO 2/FIO2 ratio14. PaO 2/FIO2 ratio describe s the severity of lung injury (e.g. 
PaO 2/FIO2 ≤300 for ALI and ≤200 for acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] ). Recently, 
SaO 2/FIO2 has been accepted as a surrogate for PaO 2/ FiO 2 ratio on the diagnosis of 
adults with acute lung injury and ARDS .15,16,17 Noticeable, previous work demonstrated 
that a PaO2/FiO2 decrease of 10% from  baseline was clinically meaningful of lung injury. 
18, 19, 20 Therefore, we decide to use SaO 2/FIO2 ratio because: 1) it avoids invasive blood 
sampling, 2) there is evidence that SaO2/F IO2 is a reliable substitute for PaO 2/FIO2 with 
good sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing lung injury, including ALI and ARDS,17,21,22 
and 3) a 10% difference on SaO 2/FIO2 between groups may be indicative of differences

Data analysis   
Control for confounding variables  
Given that this study will not be randomized, we will control for observed potential 
confounding variable (Table 5 ) using the inverse propensity score weighting method. To 
estimate the propensity score, we will first fit a multinomial logistic regression model with  
the four treatments of different ventilation strategies as outcome. For each patient, the 
probability of receiving each treatment given the observed con founding variables is 
estimated and the weight is calculated as inverse of the propensity score. To be 
conservative, we stabilized the weights further by [CONTACT_657910] 99th percentile. The 
success of the contro l for confounding will be  assessed by [CONTACT_657911] (ASD), 
defined as the absolute difference in means or proportions divided by [CONTACT_24703]. Any confounding variables with a n ASD > 0.[ADDRESS_887057] of tidal volume  (2 levels) , PEEP  
(2 levels) and their inte raction on  the time-weighted average  SaO 2/FIO2ratio during first 
postoperative hour in PACU , including propensity score weights and adjusting for 
unbalanced confounders as appropriate . If interaction effect is not  significant (P >0.10 ), 
treatment effect estimates will be  summarized using mean difference comparing tidal 
volume  of 10 vs. 8 and PEEP of 8 vs. 5. If interaction is  significant , the effects of each 
intervention will be  assessed within levels of the other intervention.  Moreover, we will use 
time-weighted average SaO 2/FIO2 value as outcome s and assess the effect of ventilation  
on it as a sensitivity analysis.  With an overall alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_887058] without significant interaction 
(i.e. 0.05/2, Bonferroni correction) before adjusting for interim analysis.  
 
 
[ADDRESS_887059] SaO 2/FIO2 at ward will be assessed using linear regression . 
Finally, we will evaluate the length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_657892] a Cox proportional hazard 
regression model. The length of stay will be analyzed as time from operation to live 
discharge from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], where patients who died before hospi[INVESTIGATOR_657893] a censoring time using the 
observed longest duration among those discharged alive.    
Interim analyses  
At each quarter of the maximum enrollment, we will conduct an interim analysis to assess 
for efficacy and futility of tidal volume  and PEEP and SaO 2/FIO2. The interim analysis will 
use the gamma spending function with parameters -4 for alpha (efficacy) and -1 for beta 
(futility). Boundaries for efficacy (futility in parentheses) at each stage are P <0.0008 
(P>0.9056), P<0.0024 (P>0.4969), P<0.0072 (P>0.1249), and P<0.0215 (P>0.0215), 
respectively.  
 
Sample size estimation  
Based on literature and a preliminary query of PHDS database and Epic EMR system, 
we assume that  the mean TWA SaO2/FIO2 is [ADDRESS_887060] deviation of 100. After 
accounting for 3 interim analyses and 1 final analysis, a  maximum N= 2,500 in total 
patients (i.e., [ADDRESS_887061]) will be  needed 
to have 9 0% power at the 0.[ADDRESS_887062] main effects of 15 or more in 
PaO 2/FIO2 for tidal volume  and PEEP (high versus low).   
The table below  provides the probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_657894]: Null (no effect), Alternative (20 increase in SaO2/FIO2), half -way 
between the null  and alternative, and 1.[ADDRESS_887063] pressure 
and assure  adequate ventilation . Importantly , clinicians will be fr ee to  provide whatever 
ventilation they believe might be necessary in individual patients . An Information Sheet 
will be used as  alternative to written consent . 
 
Significance  
Postoperative pulmonary complications  are common , occurring  in about 5% of surgical 
patients. Pulmonary complications  increase morbidity, mortality, length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], 
and healthcare costs. Because so many  orthopedic surgeries  are performed at the 
Cleveland Clinic, reducing PACU time and pulmonary complications  will improve  clinical 
outcome s and reduce  healthcare costs . Our research  project will provide  strong  clinical 
evidence for selecting  an optimal ventilation strategy for an enhanced care pathway  in 
patients having  elective orthopedic surgeries with mechanical ventilation .

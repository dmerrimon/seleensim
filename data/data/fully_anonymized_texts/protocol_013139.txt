This clinical trial will be sponsored by: 
[CONTACT_397294] - MD Anderson Cancer Center. 
The trial will be conducted within the Department of Gastrointestinal Medical Oncology at the 
University of [LOCATION_007]  - MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, TX.  All clinical assessments will 
be performed in the outpatient clinic setting.  Study drug will be administered in the Cancer Therapy and Research Center (CTRC), an outpatient infusion center at MD Anderson.   
The Principal Investigato r represent s all Investigators for decisions and discussions regarding this 
trial, consistent with the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH)  Topic E6 G ood C linical 
Practice (GCP; hereafter refe rred to as ICH GCP) . The Coordinating Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_397243].   The trial will appear in the following clinical trial registry : www.clinicaltrials.gov  
[ADDRESS_499911] (IMP) for the present trial is   M7824. 
M7824 is a bifunctional fusion protein that combines an anti -programmed death ligand 1 (PD -
L1) antibody and the soluble extracellular  domain  of transforming growth factor  beta (TGFβ 
receptor type II as a TGFβ neutralizing  “trap,” into a single molecule. This an ti-PD-L1 / TGFβ -
Trap molecule is designed to target 2 major mechanisms of immunosuppression in the tumor 
microenvironment. The anti -PD-L1 moiety of  M7824 is identical to avelumab, except  for three  
amino  acid substitutions in the heavy  chain  constant  regions, which result in a different human 
IgG1 allotype, and one amino acid substitution in the heavy chain for antibody stability. As of 
June 2017, FDA has granted accelerated approval to avelumab for metastatic Merkel cell 
carcinoma (MCC) and locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma whose disease progressed during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy. 
Combining these pathways, PD -1 / PD -L1 and TGFβ, is attractive as an antitumor approach. A 
recent report found that blockade of TGFβ signaling in T cells or deletion of TGFβ1 from T  cells 
in a mouse model led to diminished PD -1 expression in tumor -infiltrating CD8 + T cells
1. 
Concomitant PD -1 and TGFβ blockade can restore pro- inflammatory  cytokines2. In a murine 
model of hepatocellular carcinoma, TGFβ appeared to increase the expression  of PD-L1 in 
dendritic cells,  which  in turn promoted T- cell apoptosis and increased  percentage of CD25+,  
Foxp3+ T regulatory  cells3. Higher levels  of circulating myeloid -derived suppressor cells 
(MDSCs),  a significant source of TGFβ,  are associated  with failure to respond to anti -PD-1 
therapy4.

  28/[ADDRESS_499912] of either the anti -PD-L1 antibody, avelumab, or 
TGFβRII control alone. Tumor rechallenge experiments in cured mice show durable  protecti ve 
immunity. In vivo studies showed that the antitumor effects were mediated by [CONTACT_398]8+ T cells  and 
NK cells.  CD8+  T-cell tumor infiltrates  were  observed  and, overall, the CD8+  response was 
associated with long term protective immunity. Importantly, in the MC38 model, M7824 showed 
significantly better efficacy than the combination of avelumab plus TGFβ Trap control, 
supporting the rationale  of combining the 2 active moieties  in 1 molecule.  
M7824, is comprised of an extracellular domain of  the human TGFβ receptor  TGFβRII 
covalently  joined via a glycine / serine linker to the C terminus of each heavy chain  of the fully 
human  IgG1  anti- PD-L1 antibody, avelumab.  Given  the emerging  pi[INVESTIGATOR_397244]-1 / PD-L1 class, 
in which  responses are apparent  but with room for increase  in effect  size, it is assumed  that 
cotargeting a complementary immune modulation step will improve tumor response. A  similar 
TGF -targeting agent, fresolimumab, which is a monoclonal antibody targeting TGF β1, 2, and 3, 
showed initial evidence of tumor response in a Phase I trial in subjects with melanoma.  The 
objective response was observed in [ADDRESS_499913] enhanced antitumor activity compared with avelumab. 
2.1.1 Safety  
A reasonable safety profile is anticipated when targeting these pathways. The safety  of the PD-1 
/ PD-L1 class continues to emerge  but appears to be substantially  less adverse compared  with 
the CTLA -[ADDRESS_499914] been  
administered  in clinical  trials  and showed an acceptable  human safety profile in humans. 
Fresolimumab was studied in Phase I trial in subjects with cancer  (28 with melanoma,  1 with renal  
cell carcinoma).  No DLTs were  observed and 15 mg/kg, the highest dose tested,  was determined  
to be safe5. The  major  AE was emergent skin tumors and hyperkeratosis.  In a small  trial of 
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the most common AE was fatigue9. In a study of 16 subjects with 
focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, the only  AE was  pustular rash in 2 subjects10. TβM1, an 
antibody inhibiting the TGF βII receptor, was well tolerated  when studied at doses as high as 240 
mg with diarrhea as the only DLT event11. Notably, one  event of low hemoglobin (Hgb) was 
observed in the high dose group. Importantly, the precli nical  profile  of M7824 is 
predominantly benign and highly comparable to that of avelumab. Overall, evidence suggests 
non-overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_397245] -PD-L1 and anti -TGFβ  agent classes.  There  is a 
theoretical potential of immune -related  adverse events (irAEs) that would be the consequence of 
a double blockade of negative regulatory loops of the immune system; however, taken together, the preclinical profile of M7824 and clinical  evidence of each pathway suggests a low risk of 
synergistic toxicity stemming from the dual-functionality of M7824. 
An irAE is  def
 ined as off target side effects associated with exposure of immunogenic drug and is 
consistent with an immune mechanism. In the process of identification of irAEs, any possible 
etiology of neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, toxin, or any other factor should be ruled out. 
Serological, histological (biopsy), immunological data should be obtained to support immune

  mediation of occurrence of adverse event. Immune -related A Es are AESIs for M7824 and 
important identified risks (adverse reactions) for M7824, and the precautions and management are 
discussed in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Important identified irAE risks for M7824 include colitis, pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease, 
endocrinopathies, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, autoimmune thryroiditis, adrenal insufficiency, Type 1 diabetes mellitus), nephritis, hepatitis, retinal microvasculitis, uveitis, myositis, and skin reactions like rash (generalized, maculo- papula, erythemato us, bullous 
pemphigoid). Management  algorithms include steroids,  other immune- suppressants,  study drug 
interruption  / discontinuation, and supportive management.  Anti-PDL1  has shown an overall 
rate of infusion reactions  of approximately 10% (Grade  3 / 4 approximately 0.4% [fell to 0.2% 
with mandatory premedication]; no Grade  5. 
A brief summary of safety experience with the PD -1 inhibitors nivolumab (Opdivo®)  and 
pembrolizumab (Keytruda®) is given  here,  based  on prescribing  information (refer  to current label 
information for updated information). For pembrolizumab the section on Warnings and Precautions includes adverse reactions of immune -mediated pneumonitis  (2.9%), immune-
mediated colitis (1%), immune -mediated hepatitis (0.5%), immune -mediated hypophysitis 
(0.5%), renal failure (0.5%) and immune -mediated nephritis  (0.7%), immune -mediated 
hyperthyroidism (1.2%) and hypothyroidism (8.3%), and a variety of  other immune -mediated 
adverse reactions occurring in less than 1% of patients. In addition, a  warning for  embryofetal 
toxicity  is provided. For nivolumab the section  on Warning and Precautions includes adverse 
reactions of immune -mediated pneumonitis (2.2%) with fatal immune- mediated pneumonitis in 
0.9% (5/574), immune -medicated colitis (2.2%), immune -mediated  hepatitis (1.1%), immune -
mediated nephritis and renal dysfunction (0.7%),  immune- mediated hyperthyroidism (3%) and 
hypothyroidism (8%) and a variety of other immune -mediated  adverse reactions occurring in less 
than 1% of patients. I n addition, a warning for embryofetal toxicity is provided. 
Safety  experience with various TGF β targeting  agents described  in the literature  suggests no 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_397246] -related profile with compounds of the anti -PD-1 / anti -PD-L1 class.  In 
Phase I  trials,  the experience with a molecule with a highly similar mechanism  to the M7824 
TGFβ  trap moiety, the anti- TGF β-1 and 3 antibody fresolimumab,  showed  no dose limiting 
toxicity up to 15 mg/kg and no immune related events
5. There  were no  DLTs  and the only major  
AEs were  skin lesions, mainly  keratoacanthomas,  some  with atypi[INVESTIGATOR_117616], one event of 
squamous cell carcinoma, plus hyperkeratosis of the skin.  Immune events were  not reported. A 
syndrome known as Ferguson- Smith  disease is caused  by [CONTACT_148390] β is associated with 
the formation of keratoacanthomas , similar to the findings described  for fresolimumab12. 
Therefore, it is plausible that skin tumors observed during fresolimumab  treatment  may be 
related  to TGF β inhibition. A neutralizing antibody  against TGF β-1, TβM1,  was well tolerated  
when  studied as high as 240 mg with diarrhea  as the only DLT  event. Notably, one event of low 
Hgb was observed in the high dose group. This is notable  since the only preclinical finding 
associated with M7824 was decreased Hgb. Trabedersen,  an antisense oligonucelotide that 
inhibits TGFβ2 expression, was associated with  thrombocytopenia that was moderate13. Finally, 
TGFβ is known to play a role in wound repair14.

2.2 Non-Clinical Findings for M7824  
2.2.1 In Vitro and in Vivo Pharmacology Findings  
Avelumab, a fully human anti -PD-L1 IgG1 antibody, recently entered Phase III  clinical 
development by [CONTACT_397297] R&D,  Billerica,  MA. Preclinical  pharmacology investigations  have 
shown that avelumab functionally  enhances T cell activation  in vitro  and significantly  inhibits the 
growth of PD-L1 expressing  tumors in vivo; thus avelumab  serves as a benchmark for the 
preclinical  proof of principle  studies of the anti- PD-L1 / TGFβ  Trap  (M7824).  In addition, M7824, 
Proprietary of MD Anderson Cancer Center
  33/[ADDRESS_499922] of inhibition of TGFβ  only. 
M7824 binds recombinant and cell surface expressed PD -L1 with an affinity similar to that of 
the parental anti -PD-L1 antibody (avelumab), and binds recombinant human TGFβ1 with high 
affinity. Importantly, M7824 can bind simultaneously to PD -L1 and TGFβ1  as demonstrated by 
a two -step binding assay. M7824 potently attenuated TGFβ signaling in cell assays and enhanced  
interleukin -2 production by T cells stimulated  with a super antigen, Staphylococcal enterotoxin 
A. M7824 is capable of mediating  antibody-depe ndent cell -mediated  cytotoxicity (ADCC)  in 
vitro,  but at a significantly  reduced  level  compared  with the parental  avelumab antibody. M7824 
was shown to be internalized by [CONTACT_4002]-L1-expressing cells in vitro with kinetics similar to those of 
the parental avelumab antibody. In summary, the dual  functionalities  of M7824 were  confirmed 
by [CONTACT_190796]:  the fusion protein retains the biological activities of the parental anti- PD-L1 
avelumab antibody, but possesses  the added modality of effective TGFβ binding and  
neutralization.  
M7824 is cross- reactive with murine PD -L1 and TGFβ1; therefore, its in vivo antitumor  efficacy  
and the immunological response during the course of treatment  can be evaluated  in syngeneic  
models; however, since  this therapeutic  agent  is a recombinant human protein  with two 
mechanisms  of action  aimed  at blocking immunosuppression, it caused  an augmented  mouse 
antibody against human antibody (MAHA) response in immunocompetent mice, which limits  the 
dosing to a 3- or 6-day window, depending on the strain  of mice.  To avoid a MAHA response, 
2 B cell deficient  strains of mice  were  employed in a series of studies designed to assess  the optimal 
antitumor efficacy of M7824 treatment in cancer models. Homozygous Jh mice  (Igh-Jtm1Dhu; 
Balb/C) lack normal B lymphocyte numbers and have no detectable IgM or  IgG antibody titers 
due to the absence of the Jh gene segments responsible for genetic  recombination of the Ig heavy 
chain. Likewise, B6.129S2- Ighmtm1Cgn/J mice (C57BL/6) lack mature B  cells due to a 
targeted  Ighmtm1Cgn mutation. The use of Jh and B6.129S mice  allowed  clinically -relevant 
repeat dosing schedules of the M7824 treatment in the in  vivo pharmacology studies. To ensure 
the results obtained were not artifacts due to the B  cell deficiency,  efficacy  and associated  
immunological responses of M7824 in wild type mice  were also demonstrated, although to a 
lesser extent for efficacy due to the limited dosing window and interference by [CONTACT_397298].  
M7824 possesses superior a ntitumor  activities  relative  to monotherapy with either  PD-L1 
blockade or TGFβ  sequestration, resulting  in complete tumor  regression  and long- term survival 
in the EMT-[ADDRESS_499923]  cancer  model and MC38  colorectal  cancer  model. Dose -dependent efficacy  
was observed in multiple models, and the effective dose range was between 25 to 492 μg per  
mouse (approximately 1.25 to 25 mg/kg) depending on the model. Importantly, M7824 therapy 
induced antitumor  activities that conferred a durable,  protective immunity  in those mice  eradicated 
of their primary tumor. Moreover, the antitumor effect of M7824 was associated  with 
modulations in T cell and NK cell phenotypes, increase in dendritic  cell maturation, and reduction 
in MDSCs  in the tumor microenvironment.  M7824 was also shown to be capable  of activating 
both adaptive and innate immune responses that included favorable changes in  tumor immune 
infiltrates. Furthermore, tumor antigen -specific CD 8+ T cell responses were enhanced with 
M7824 therapy.

  In a trial to further elucidate the mechanisms of action, tumor- bearing mice were systemically 
depleted of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells or NK cells during treatment. The therapeutic efficacy 
of M7824 was completely abrogated by [CONTACT_397299]8+ T  cells or NK cells, but not 
by [CONTACT_397300]4+ T cells. Consistent with the reduced ADCC in vitro, the effector function of M7824 did not play an important role in the antitumor effect in vivo. Furthermore, 
the dominant role of CD8+ T cells in maintaining long- term protective immunity following 
M7824 induced tumor eradication has been demonstrated. 
The therapeutic potential of M7824 was explored in combination with various standard -of-care 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. In combination with the core components of the  FOLFOX chemotherapy regimen 
(oxaliplatin, 5 -fluorouracil and oxaliplatin), an additive enhancement  in efficacy was 
demonstrated against MC38 colorectal carcinoma. In combination with fractionated, localized 
radiotherapy, a highly synergistic antitumor effect w as achieved with only a single  low dose  of 
M7824 in the MC38  tumor  model. An augmented antitumor  effect  was also observed  when  
M7824 was combined with pazopanib in a mouse  renal  cell carcinoma model, and with anti -
CTLA -[ADDRESS_499924] that M7824 can be explored as a  combination partner in different clinical 
settings for t he treatment of cancer  patients.  
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for full details of the preclinical pharmacology of M7824. 
2.2.2 Pharmacokinetics / Immunogenicity Findings  
Preclinical PK data and PK / PharmDyn analysis for M7824 is available from mice and 
cynomolgus monkeys. The single- dose data in monkey shows non- linearity  between  the low doses 
of 0.8 and 4 mg/kg versus the high dose of 20 mg/kg, which had reduced clearance, suggesting  
a saturable component. The TGF β1 binding was assessed and showed suppression for  prolonged 
periods beyond drug exposure at all dose levels;  however, baseline data contained  data below 
lower limit of quantification and therefore these data were not considered relevant  for 
PK/PharmDyn  projections. The fusion protein  appeared  stable since there  was no evidence of 
intralinker cleavage.  Mouse PK / PharmDyn models for tumor  and peripheral blood (CD3+ 
splenic) PD -L1 occupancy were also  generated. 
 
A brief summary of PK and PK / PharmDyn is as follows: 
• The predicted human terminal half- life (t 1/2) for M7824 is approximately 6  days  
• Simulations  predict that a 1 mg/kg dose will provide an average exposure of 
approximately 7 μg/mL in humans 
• Based on PK / PharmDyn modeling and human projections: 
o At a human dose of 0.1 mg/kg, 95% PD -L1 total occupancy at maximum  serum  
concentration  observed post-dose (Cmax) is expected  in PBMCs,  providing 
approximately 60% total occupancy in tumor 
o At a human dose of 1.0 mg/kg, more  than 95% of PD-L1 total occupancy  at Cmax is 
expected  in PBMCs and tumor 
Proprietary of MD Anderson Cancer Center
  35/106 
  o At a human dose  of  1.0  mg/kg,  20%  effect  is  projected  in  tumor  regression  in  the 
PK / PharmDyn model compared with 95% at 7.5 mg/kg 
• Human  projections indicate a dose of 7.5 mg/kg  and higher (range 4 to 20 mg/kg), on a 
biweekly schedule is needed to achieve full efficacy based on a mouse tumor model in which 
complete tumor regressions were observed.  
Anti-drug  antibodies  were  observed  in  some  animals;  however,  the  impact  on  PK  or PK / 
PharmDyn is not known. Preclinical  antidrug  antibody formation  is not predictive  of human  
antibodies. 
2.2.3 Toxicology 
The toxicological profile  of M7824 was investigated  in vivo in mice  and cynomolgus 
monkeys. In addition, an optimized in vitro cytokine release assay in human PBMCs as well  as 
tissue cross- reactivity studies in normal human and cynomolgus monkey tissues were  performed. 
Investigations of local tolerance were integrated in the repeat -dose toxicity studies. The 
investigation of safety pharmacology relevant parameters (CNS, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascular) was 
included in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735] 4- week intravenous (IV) repeat -dose toxicity study in  cynomolgus 
monkeys. Please refer to the investigator brochure for M7824 for further details.  
2.2.[ADDRESS_499925] was reported with a TEAE with a Preferred  Term  of infusion- related  reaction; 
however using a post -reporting analysis according to criteria outlined in the Statistical Analysis 
Plan,  3 subjects were  reported  with TEAEs  that were  classified  as “infusion- related  reactions,” 
with the Preferred  Terms  of abdominal pain, pyrexia, and back  pain (Note: these  events are 
undergoing further  review).  
The safety summary of the M7824 expansion cohort in colorectal patients is listed in Table 5. As 
of April [ADDRESS_499926] both drug- related and not -related AEs for items in which > 10% of patients 
experience the event, or if the events was recurrent  Grade 3 or any Grade 4 or higher. Overall, the 
drug was well tolerated at the 1,200mg dose level with a typi[INVESTIGATOR_397248]. Of note, the grade 3 toxicities occurring in more than 10 percent of study subjects were anem ia (4 out of 32, 12.5%), hyponatremia (4 out of 32, 12.5%) and dyspnea (4 out of 32, 
12.5%). There were 4 subjects with Grade 3 events listed as related to M7824. These include anemia (1 event), blood bilirubin increased (1 event), enteritis (1 event) and adrenal insufficiency (1 event). No Grade [ADDRESS_499927] been reported as related to M7824. Please see

  2.2.5 Rationale for Cohorts  
The programmed death 1 (PD -1) protein/ PD ligand -1 (PD -L1) interaction is important for im mune 
evasion. PD -L1 is expressed on many cells including tumor cells. The PD -1/PD -L1 interaction 
results in peripheral T effector cell exhaustion and promotes conversion of T cells towards a T -
regulatory (T reg) phenotype. Other cell types express PD -L1 suc h as natural killer (NK) cells, 
myeloid cells and dendritic cells. These cells all contribute to the tumor microenvironment (TME) 
and have the potential to upregulate PD -L1. Evidence for disrupting this interaction via checkpoint 
inhibitors has been shown in melanoma and non- small cell lung cancer. PD1 antibodies, nivolumab 
and pembrolizumab tested in phase III trials versus standard of care chemotherapy have demonstrated better clinical outcomes in melanoma
4,15,16, non- small cell lung cancer17-19. Initial 
data suggests anti -PD-[ADDRESS_499928] efficacy in MSI -H mCRC20.  
TGFβ is a cytokine with multiple functions21. It is produced by [CONTACT_397301]22, various myeloid populations, fibroblasts and T regulatory (T reg) cells23. TGFβ has dual 
roles in cancer24. In early stage disease, TGFβ promotes differentiation and apoptosis acting as a 
tumor suppressor . In late stage cancer, TGFβ has a tumor promoter function. TGFβ enhances 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_359288] (EMT) by [CONTACT_397302]1,2, TWIST, SNAIL and SLUG that control expression of cell surface markers that mediate epi[INVESTIGATOR_1231] -cell contacts 
such as E -cadherin
25. TGFβ has autocrine and paracrine functions in fibroblasts, macrophages and 
myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC)26. These cells have direct and indirect effects on the 
overall inflammatory/immune state of the tumor microenvironment (TME).  
TGFβ also contributes to an immunosuppression within the TME. Cancer s secrete various 
cytokines and chemokines that stimulate myelopoiesis and attract immature my eloid cells towards 
the tumor. Granulocyte (PMN -MDSC) and monocyte (M -MDSC) can be recruited and under TME 
specific conditions such as hypoxia, cause differentiat ion of these precursors into tumor associated 
macrophages and neutrophils (TAM s and TANs)26-28. TGFβ forms one of the many cytokines that 
forms autocrine feedback to sustain immunosuppressive signaling at the TME level29. In addition, 
these immature precursor s are highly immunosuppressive while the TAMs are polarized towards 
alternatively activated forms such as the  immunosuppressive M2 phenotype. Together, MDSC and 
M2 macrophages promote downregulation of tumor immunity through direct mechanisms on 
cytotoxic T cells. These include substrate metabolism (arginine) or sequestration (L -cystine), 
direct effects  of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or reactive nitrogen species on T -cell receptor 
subunits and through the secretion of cytokines that promote Treg differentiation. TGFβ has downregulatory effects on cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells
26. In the bloodstream , 
TGFβ released from platelets after contact [CONTACT_397303]
30,31 and downregulates NKG2D receptors on NK cells32, providing 
another immune escape mechanism.   
TGFβ has pleotropic effects extend beyond the immune regulation. Through effects on local innate immune cells, endothelial cells  and activated fibroblasts, TGFβ is a central component of the 
cytokine milieu that also promotes angiogenesis
25.  TGFβ also mediates an environment of matrix 
remodeling via cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and immune cells. The induction of these cells results secretion of matricellular proteins.

  37/106 
  Modulation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is a dy namic process. The ECM forms the structural 
components holding cells together in a tissue architecture but it has several functions beyond the 
cytoskeletal capacity. It serves as a reservoir for growth factors such as TGFβ, provides survival signals and inhibition signals via cell surface molecules such as integrins. TGFβ is secreted and bound to latent factors that are bound to the ECM until activated and liberated
33. Integrins may 
also modulate TGFβ release34. Active signaling in this way is crucial in embryonic development, 
morphogenesis and wound healing35.  
In cancer, the extracellular signals that result in apoptosis or growth suppression from the  ECM 
are perturbed. Growing tumors resist inhibitory growth signals and the local ECM is disrupted. Liberated factors and danger signals now available for recognition by [CONTACT_397304] a cascade of events analogous to wound healing
23. Infl ammation via activated macrophages set off 
a cascade inflammatory molecules that recruit further infiltration of neutrophils and immature myeloid cells to the area. Fibroblasts are also activated in this process and secrete TGFβ through autocrine and parac rine pathways. TGFβ induces production of ECM related genes including 
metalloproteinases (MMPs)
36. Chronic remodeling without removal of the cancer trigger results 
in a perpetual cycle of remodeling. TGFβ secretion begets further TGFβ production and as a result, the TME is primed for angiogenesis, invasion, ECM breakdown and immune escape. 
The relationship between immune infiltrates and MSI -H in CRC is well established
37. 
Immunotherapy with anti -PD1 therapy may have efficacy in this population38. Nivolumab and 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_397249] a response rate of 33%  in metastatic MSI -H CRC39. TGFβ, 
being a central determinant of an immune suppressive TME may be a key resistance mechanism 
in PDL1 therapy strategies40. It does so both directly on T cells to differentiate into T regs or 
indirectly via attraction of immunosuppressive immature myeloid and MDSCs into the TME. Upregulation of TGF -β signaling has been associated with de novo resistance to anti -PD-[ADDRESS_499929] from the TME, we hypothesize that M7824 may promote T cell 
effector function via disruption of PD -1/PD -L1 axis to enhance anti -tumor response following 
resistance to anti -PD-1/PD -L1 therapy in patients with MSI- H mCRC.  
The consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) are the best representation of the variation seen within CRC on the basis of ge ne expression
41. Briefly, CMS1 is characterized by [CONTACT_397305]- H. Notably, MSI -H is a subset of CMS1 
and there is a proportion within this group that current biomarkers do not capture. CMS4 is a mesenchymal phenotype and is associated with a number of features associated with poor prognosis. Hallmark features of CMS4 include TGFβ activation, immune infiltration, EMT, matrix remodeling, and angiogenesis
41. In contrast to CMS1, the immune infiltration displays a relative 
absence of cytotoxic T cells but a high proportion of tumor associated macrophages (TAMs)42. 
TGFβ signaling and immune suppression in the microenvironment are contributory factors to the aggressive biology that is reflected in the poor overall survival within this group. TGFβ activation conditions stroma at other sites to form metastatic n iches that promote a receptive environment for 
circulating tumor cells or increases tumor initiating cell capacity in conjunction with fibroblast activation
43. TGFβ inhibition with LY215299 in the TME prevented metastasis formation in 
patient derived tumor organoids44. Blocking TGFβ signaling may help reverse a number of key 
processes in the CMS4 poor prognosis group which include: reversing fibroblast activation,

  38/106 
  removing tumor initiating capacity, reversing immature myeloid and MDSC infiltration and 
downregulating EM T. Given the role of inflammatory cells and TGFβ, M7824 may reprogram an 
inflammatory response that is immune suppressive to an immunogenic response.  
In a recent pi[INVESTIGATOR_397250] M7824 monotherapy45, there were 22 
patients with adequate tumor tissue avai lable for CMS subtypi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  Patients here had been permitted 
to enroll without prior knowledge of CMS status.  In this cohort, there were 10 patients with CMS4 
mCRC.  Only one of these ten patients demonstrated a radiographic response, which remained > [ADDRESS_499930] the immunogenicity of these tumors in order to improve the anti -tumor 
responses.  Radiotherapy has been shown to induce tumor cell damage through apoptosis - and 
necrosis- induced mechani sms
46-48, and augment exposure of more tumor -associated antigens for 
recognition by [CONTACT_488] -presenting cells and tumor attack by [CONTACT_20411] T cells49.  Radiated tumor 
cells promote release of danger -associated molecular patterns50, which likewise recruit more 
activated T cells to the tumor microenvironment.  In preclinical MC38 and CT26 models of 
colorectal cancer using immunocompetent mice, concomitant stimulation by [CONTACT_397306] -1:PD -L1 axis in 
combination with radiotherapy51-54. 
TGF -β activation within the tumor microenvironment by [CONTACT_67380]- associated fibroblasts promotes 
T cell exclusion in preclinical models of CRC akin to the CMS4 subtype55.  This may render 
immunotherapy agents ineffective in certain patients with MSS CRC if activated T cells are unable to penetrate intratumorally.  Indeed, knockdown of TGF -β activity microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_397251], although T cells reflexively 
increased PD -L1 expression on the surface in response to TGF -β inhibition.  However, treatment 
with anti - TGF -β agents in the pre -metastatic setting (i.e., prior to development of exclusionary 
TGF -β activated stroma) decreased the onset of metastatic tumors for these models.  Recently, 
identification of micrometastases in patients with CRC has become more feasible due to the advent 
of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) technology.  Series of patients with non- meta static and 
metastatic CRC alike have demonstrated resoundingly the strong association between CRC 
recurrence and the presence of ctDNA fo llowing curative resection
56-58, with  (+) ctDNA bearing a 
90-100% positive predictive value for the event of recurrent CRC, a surrogate for the presence of 
micromet astatic disease.  Applying these findings, it is possible then to treat patients with (+) 
ctDNA following resection of oligometastatic CRC and completion of standard-of- care 
chemotherapy in the absence of clinically/radiographically macroscopic disease elsewhere, who may have remnant microscopic disease that can be eradicated by [CONTACT_397307] -L1: TGF- β targeted

Following on from the high response rates seen with PD -[ADDRESS_499931] demonstrated impressive response rates in MSI -H tumors, irrespective of site 
of origin. A tumor agnostic phase 2 study enrolling patients with MSI -H metastatic tumors 
demonstrated an ORR of 53% and disease control rate of 77% with median PFS and OS not yet 
reached
59. The cohort of 86 patients included CRC, neuroendocrine, ampulla of Vater, gastric,

  39/[ADDRESS_499932] common adenocarcinomas wit h a MSI -
H signature [CONTACT_397349], gastric, small intestinal, colon, rectum, cervical, pros tate and 
neuroendocrine tumors. Ovarian and uterine sarcomas are the non- epi[INVESTIGATOR_397252] -H. While only 4% of these tumors are stage IV, the number of tumors that 
display the MSI -H phenotype has led to an estimation of 20,[ADDRESS_499933] of the trial is considered  justifiable  using the dose 
and schedule of M7824 as specified in this protocol. The trial will be discontinued in  the event 
of any new findings that indicate a relevant deterioration of the risk -benefit ratio and would render 
continuation of the trial unjustifiable. The following are considered potential risks  of exposure 
to M7824: 
• Infusion- related reactions including  hypersensitivity 
• irAEs / autoimmune  disorders  
• Anemia  
• Rash with hyperkeratosis, keratoacanthoma, and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin 
• Alterations in wound healing or repair of tissue damage  
• Embryofetal toxicities

trials  with M7824, guidance for prevention, monitoring, and medical  management of potential 
risks, as well as guidance on study treatment interruption or  discontinuation.  See  Section  2.2.4  
for a summary  of clinical  safety  findings. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Infusion-related Reactions / Hypersensitivity  
Infusion- related reactions hypersensitivity are a risk inherent to the administration of  any 
recombinant protein to humans. Incidence of immunogenicity and character or severity of 
immunogenicity- induced side effects cannot be predicted by [CONTACT_397308] a much  stronger immune -response in rodents or non- 
human  primates  than in humans. The parent antibody (avelumab) caused  lethal immune- mediated 
anaphylactic hypersensitivity reactions  in mice  after repeated  application,  while  a control antibody 
lacking pharmacological activity only triggered a moderate immune reaction. However, in 
primates  (cynomolgus monkeys), as a species closer  to human, neither  in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] 4-week  IV 
repeat -dose toxicity tr ial nor in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735] 13- week IV infusion repeat -dose toxicity trial,  clinical 
signs of hypersensitivity have been seen at dose levels of 20, 60, and 140 mg/kg, respectively.  
Proprietary of MD Anderson Cancer Center
  40/[ADDRESS_499934]  (2.0%) in the dose-escalation  cohort reported  an infusion- related  reaction  event (Grade  2) 
and 49 (10.2%) of the [ADDRESS_499935]  of the events were  Grade  
1 (8 subjects, 1.7%) or Grade 2 (36 subjects, 7.5%) in intensity, and Grade 3 (3 subjects, 0.6%)  
or Grade  4 events (2 subjects,  0.4%) were  less frequent. No Grade  [ADDRESS_499936] (30 subjects,  6.3%) or 
second (16 subjects, 3.3%) avelumab infusion. In 8 subjects (1.7%), avelumab treatment  was 
discontinued because of infusion- related reaction  events. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Immune- related Adverse Events / Autoimmune Disorders  
Since inhibition of PD -L1 and TGFβ signaling stimulates the immune system, irAEs may occur.  
Treatment of irAEs is mainly dependent upon severity (NCI- CTCAE grade):  
• Grade 1 to 2:  treat symptomatically o r with moderate dose steroids, more frequent monitoring 
• Grade 1 to 2 (persistent):  manage similar to high grade AE (Grade 3 to 4) 
• Grade 3 to 4:  treat with high dose corticosteroids 
Treatment of irAEs should follow guidelines set forth in Section [IP_ADDRESS]:  
• Instructions for trial treatment discontinuation or interruption in case of irAEs /  autoimmune 
disorders (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
 
• Guidance for the medical  management of irAEs  / autoimmune disorders  including specific 
guidance with regard to the affected organ / body system (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
• irAEs / autoimmune disorders (any grade) are considered as AESIs requiring  expedited 
reporting from the Investigator to [COMPANY_006]/EMD Serono . For non- serious AESIs, an AESI 
Report Form has to be completed; for serious events, an SAE Report Form has to be used. 
• Regular laboratory tests on parameters indicative for autoimmune disorders will be  
performed as detailed in the Schedules of Assessments (see Tables  1-3).  
• To help monitor for autoimmune effects, baseline ophthalmology examination including slit 
lamp inclusive of the anterior segment and including visual acuity. If clinically relevant eye 
signs or symptoms  during the study, appropriate ophthalmology examination within  2 
days including slit lamp inclusive of the anterior segment and including visual acuity. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Anemia  
As the 4 -week toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys demonstrated reversible decreases  in 
red blood cell counts, as well as corresponding Hgb and hematocrit,  anemia is considered  a 
potential risk. Inclusion criteria for the study will require adequate entry Hgb value. Risk 
management measures are provided in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. Th e  amount of blood drawn during the 
study for non- essential  biomarkers will be carefully  considered, especially  given the preclinical 
finding of reduced Hgb levels.

  [IP_ADDRESS]  Alterations in Wound Healing or Repair of Tissue Damage 
Alternations of wound healing and tissue damage repair are considered a potential risk given the 
TGFβ mechanism. Management should be discussed with the principal investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a case-
by-case basis.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Rash with Hyperkeratosis / Keratoacanthoma / Squamous 
Cell Carcinoma of the Skin  
Phase I information from  a TGF  antibody showed excess acanthomas,  some  with atypi[INVESTIGATOR_397253],  
and one confirmed  squamous cell carcinoma5. A genetic disorder in the TGF pathway is also 
known to be associated with skin tumors12. Based on  this information, skin tumors are considered 
a potential risk. Monitoring will include skin assessments as defined in the schedule of 
assessments (see Tables  1-3). Management should  be discussed with the on  a case-by- case basis. 
Dermatological consults should be requested as needed. Rash with hyperkeratosis / 
keratoacanthoma / squamous cell carcinoma of the  skin are considered as AESIs  requiring  
expedited reporting from the Investigator to the [COMPANY_006]/EMD Serono . Any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_397254]. For non-serious AESIs,  an AESI  Report Form has  to be completed; for serious 
events,  an SAE  Report Form  has to be used (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Embryofetal Toxicity 
Embryofetal toxicities are a known risk of the PD -1 / PD -L1 targeting class. Animal models  link 
the PD-1 / PD-L1 signaling pathway with maintenance of pregnancy through induction of maternal 
immune tolerance to fetal tissue. Based on its mechanism of action (MoA), M7824 may cause 
fetal harm when administered to a pregnant female. An appropriate contraception  warning is 
provided in this clinical protocol. Subjects with pregnancy or in lactation period are  prohibited 
from being enrolled in clinical trials.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Potential Benefit 
In cohort A -C, patients will be selected based on MSI -H status and progression on prior immune 
checkpoint therapy on trial entry. Single agent  responses to nivolumab in MSI -H mCRC have 
been updated in early key studies and range from 31%60 and 50%38. In a population in whom the 
anticipated response rate is high  but who have progressed on  therapy, M7824, which targets a 
possible immunotherapy resistance mechanism in the form of TGFβ  upregulation, appears 
promising.  Beyond CRC, patients with MSI -H tumors who have progressed on prior 
immunotherapy will be enrolled. ORR and DCR to single agent pembrolizumab was 52% and 
77% respectively in a population that contained ampulla of Vater, duodenal, pancreatic, neuroendocri ne, cholangiocarcinoma, gastric, ovarian cancers and uterine sarcomas
59. Many of 
the these tumors lack effective salvage treatments and when considered in context of the response rates to single agent PD -1 blockade, targeti ng a potential resistance mechanism for potential 
durable responses with M7824 is a promising option.

In Cohort D, patients with MSS mCRC who have completed therapy following R0 resection with 
or without chemotherapy for removal of al l clinically and radiographically evident macroscopic 
disease will be tested for the presence of ctDNA.  Given the correlation between detectable ctDNA and the presence of minimal residual disease, patients in this cohort are at high risk for recurrence.  
This clinical  trial will be conducted in compliance with the clinical trial protocol, GCP  (ICH  Topic

  M7824 and SBRT  (Cohort B).  While SBRT is preferred, IMRT or 3D conformal techniques may be 
utilized at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist depending on the dose to surrounding normal 
tissues.   Patient will receive a total dose of 24Gy over three days with one of the following modalities, at 
the d iscretion of the treating radiation oncologist: SBRT, IMRT and 3D conformal.  
2.  To characterize circulating immune cell populations and cytokine profiles in tumor and 
circulation following treatment with M7824.  
3.  To describe changes in levels of TGF -β following treatment with M7824. 
4.  To correlate the presence of microsatellite instability with CMS1 profile.  
5.  To correlate MSI -H and CMS4 to CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) status, KRAS and 
BRAF mutation status. 
6.  To quantify correlation with CMS4 and immune populations within tumor infiltrate. 7.  To correlate anti -tumor response to M7824 with PD-L1 expression. 
8.  To conduct RNAseq, RNA Scope, WES targeted sequencing and tissue IO gene expression by

9.  To evaluate novel markers in blood by [CONTACT_397309], but not limited to, circulating -
free DNA (cfDNA), exosomes, and circulating tumor cells (CTC).   
10. To describe changes in microbiome profiling upon treatment with M7824 (with or without radiation).  
4 Investigati onal Plan  
4.1 Overall Trial Design and Plan 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Cohort A -C – MSI- H solid tumors  
This is a phase Ib expansion study to assess efficacy of M7824 in patients with MSI- H solid tumors 
who have progressed on prior anti -PD-1/PD -L1 therapy. The hypothesis is that  these  patients will 
demonstrate anti -tumor response upon treatment with M7824.  Patients successfully enrolled will 
have had at least two doses of prior immune checkpoint therapy (anti -PD1, anti -PDL1 or anti -
CTLA4) with documented progression on CT or MRI imaging.  
M7824 will be administered intravenously at a dose of 1200mg every 14 days ( -3/+1 day). M7824 
will be administered until documented PD, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of informed 
consent. Tumor assessments will be performed every [ADDRESS_499938] 1.1.  Patients who discontinue 
due to toxicity will continue to be assessed via imaging until documented PD.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Cohort B  – CMS4 mCRC  
This is a phase 2, si ngle arm, Simon’s optimal two- stage design to assess ORR in treatment-
refractory CMS4 mCRC receiving M7824  with SBRT . The hypothesis is that efficacy of M7824 
coadministered with SBRT will be demonstrated in patients with CMS4  mCRC   
Proprietary of MD Anderson Cancer Center
  45/[ADDRESS_499939] had CMS4 classification after characterization of their pre-
treatment primary tissue biopsy.  M7824 will be administered intravenously at a  dose of 1200mg 
every 14 days (+/ - 7 days).  The first dose of M7824 will be  administered alone.  After the second 
dose of M7824, patients will receive SBRT for a total dose of 24Gy over three days, with first treatment of radiotherapy administered within 7 days of completion of the second dose of M7824 
(cycle 1, day 15) .  Radioth erapy must be completed prior to the third dose of M7824.  While SBRT 
is preferred, IMRT or 3D conformal techniques may be utilized at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist depending on the dose to surrounding normal tissues.  Patient will re ceive a 
total dose of 24Gy over three days with one of the following modalities, at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist: SBRT, IMRT and 3D conformal.  
M7824 will be continued until documented PD or unacceptable toxicity. Tumor assessments will 
be performed every [ADDRESS_499940] 1.1 . Patients who discontinue due to toxicity will cont inue 
to be assessed via imaging until documented PD.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Cohort D – ctDNA(+) MSS mCRC following resection of 
metastatic disease 
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_397255] M7824 following R0 resection of metastatic disease in patients with MSS  mCRC.  Patients with oligometastatic colorectal cancer 
must have undergone an R0 resection with no remnant clinically or radiographically evident disease.  The primary tumor must have also been resected, and patients must have completed all standard -of-care treatment for the primary tumor (e.g., chemoradiation for primary rectal cancer, 
adjuvant chemotherapy, etc) at the discretion of the treating physician. 
Following at least [ADDRESS_499941] therapy, patients will be tested for the 
presence or absence of ctDNA.  Patients with a confirmed (+) ctDNA result will be allowed to 
proceed with M7824 treatment.   M7824 will be administered intravenously at a dose  of 1200 mg every 14 days (+/ - 7 days).  ctDNA 
and CT scans will be repeated at [ADDRESS_499942] the option to continue on treatment every 2 weeks with M7824, until the 
time of disease recurrence and/or progression, either radiographically or clinically .  Radiographic 
assessments will occur every 12 weeks thereafter , until disease progression or patient 
discontinuation on study. 
 
4.1.2 Planned number of subjects 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Cohort A -C – MSI- H solid tumors  
The planned number of subjects for this trial is 15 patients with MSI -H metastatic solid tumors. 
Proprietary of MD Anderson Cancer Center
  46/106 
  [IP_ADDRESS]  Cohort B  – CMS4 mCRC  
In this Simon two -stage design, t he planned number of subject s is [ADDRESS_499943] 2 patients demonstrate radiographic response (i.e. CR + PR) , then 14 additional pati ents will 
be treated in the second stage, for a total of 29 patients .  If there is an anti -tumor signal in the 29 
patients with CMS4 metastatic CRC who are treated with this combination, then the study may be 
amended to expand patient selection across all CMS subgroups. 
. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Cohort D -- ctDNA(+) MSS mCRC following resection of 
metastatic disease  
The planned number of subjects for this cohort is [ADDRESS_499944] is estimated to be up to 2 years. This includes an 28- day s creening 
period (decision will be made in this period for subject ’s trial inclusion if all eligibility criteria are 
met), a treatment duration until confirmed PD, unacceptable toxicity, or any criterion for 
withdrawal from the trial or IMP occurs (see Section 4.5) and an 28-Day Safety Follow-up visit [ADDRESS_499945] may benefit from treatment beyond 12 months, it may be permissible after discussion 
with the principal investigator. In the case of pseudoprogression, subjects should continue treatment through one additional  tumor assessment, if they meet the criteria described in Section 
4.5.1. 
Adverse events ( AEs) and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) should be followed until they resolve, 
return to b aseline, or are irreversible (see Section 6.1.4 for details). 
In both cohorts, it  is anticipated to enroll the first p lanned subject by [CONTACT_37112]  2017, and the final 
subject enrolled by [CONTACT_37112]  2018.  
4.1.4 Dose Modification and ADRs Requiring Treatment 
Discontinuation  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dose Modification  
The dose of M7824 is 1200mg. Further details about discontinuation, withholding and restarting 
M7824 based on ADRs and AEs are presented in further detail in Section  5.5.3. 
Proprietary of MD Anderson Cancer Center
  47/106 
  [IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Drug Reactions Requiring Treatment 
Discontinuation  
The following ADRs, defined as any AE assessed as related to M7824 by [CONTACT_11219] 
/ or [COMPANY_006]/EMD Serono, require permanent treatment discontinuation:  
Any Grade [ADDRESS_499946] any clinical correlate, and resolve to Grade ≤ 1 or Baseline grade within 14 days with adequate medical management.  
Any Grade 3 ADRs require treatment discontinuation except  for any of the following:  
• Transient (≤ 6 hours) Grade 3 flu- like symptoms or fever, which is controlled with medical 
management. 
• Transient (≤ 24 hours) Grade 3 fatigue, local reactions, headache, nausea, emesis that resolves to ≤ Grade 1 or Baseline grade.  
• Tumor flare phenomenon defined as local pain, irritation, or rash localized at sites of known or suspected tumor. 
• Any Grade ≥ 3 drug -related amylase or lipase abnormality that is not associated with 
symptoms or clinical manifestations of pancreatitis. The study principal investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_397256] ≥ 3 amylase or lipase abnormalities. If the amylase or lipase abnormality not associated with symptoms or clinical manifestations of pancreatitis has not resolved to  Grade ≤ 1 within the subsequent 2 doses (28 days), the subject should 
permanently discontinue treatment with M7824. 
• Grade 3 Hgb decrease (< 8.0 g/dL) that is clinically manageable with blood transfusions or erythroid growth factor use does not require treatment discontinuation.  
• Increases in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) ≥ 3 that resolves to ≤  2 by [CONTACT_2006] 1 of the next cycle (infusions should not be given if the ECOG PS 
is ≥ 3 on the day of IMP administration and should be delayed until ECOG PS ≤ 2). 
Any Grade [ADDRESS_499947] should be managed as follows:  
• If a Grade [ADDRESS_499948] resolves to Grade ≤ [ADDRESS_499949] day of the current cycle, treatment may 
continue. 
• If a Grade [ADDRESS_499950] does not resolve to Grade ≤ [ADDRESS_499951] day of the current cycl e but it 
is manageable and / or not clinically relevant, the ADR should be discussed with the 
principal investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_397257]. If at the end of the following cycle, the event  has not resolved to Grade 
1, discussion should be had with the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_397258] M7824. 
Proprietary of MD Anderson Cancer Center
  48/106 
  • Upon the second occurrence of the same Grade [ADDRESS_499952] (except for 
fatigue and hormone insufficienc ies that can be managed by [CONTACT_13128]), 
continuation of treatment with M7824 has to be discussed with the principal investigator  
[INVESTIGATOR_397259]. 
• Infusion- related reactions and hypersensitivity reactions (Grades 1 to 4) should be handled 
according to the guidelines provided in Sections [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS], respectively.  
• Anemia should be handled according to the guidelines provided in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
4.1.5 Analysis Cut -Off Dates

The primary data cut -off for the analysis will be  after [ADDRESS_499953] dose of M7824.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Cohort B  
The first data cut -off for the interim analysis will be [ADDRESS_499954] (n=29) received study treatment. 
The final data cut -off will be [ADDRESS_499955] dose of M7824.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Cohort D  
The primary data cut -off for the analysis will be after [ADDRESS_499956] dose of M7824.  
4.2 Discussion of Trial Design  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Cohort A -C 
This is a Phase Ib , open- label trial in patients with MSI- H metastatic solid tumors  who have 
progressed on prior checkpoint inhibitor treatment.  
The study focuses on the subset of patients with metastatic solid tumors  that has displayed higher 
responses rates to immune checkpoint blockade. Microsatellite instability  is associated with higher 
immune infiltration61-63 .  One early study demonstrated that responders to the anti -PD-1 antibody, 
pembrolizumab, were restricted to MSI -H mCRC patients  in comparison to non- MSI-H CRC38. 
Updated results from this study demonstrated RR of 50% and disease- control rate (DCR) of 89% 
Proprietary of MD Anderson Cancer Center
  49/106 
  seen in MSI -H, compared  to 0% and 16% in non- MSI-H mCRC patients, respectively59. 
Pembrolizumab has since received breakthrough designation by [CONTACT_397310] -H 
solid tumors (including mCRC ). In addition, PD -L1 expression was not associated with OS in this 
study and preliminary results from the Checkmate -[ADDRESS_499957] demonstrated impr essive ORR of 53% with PD -1 blockade in a 
variety of tumors was 53% and DCR of 77% with median PFS and OS not being met59. Given the 
mechanism of M7824, use of MSI -H as a biomarker as already demonstrated is appropriate to 
enrich for likely responders while selection based on prior progression following checkpoint 
immunotherapy approaches ensures targeting of a potential resistance mechanism.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Cohort B  
This is a phase II, single arm, Simon two- stage design to assess efficacy of M7824 as an abscopal 
phenomenon with radiation to a single metastatic lesion in patients with  treatment -refractory , 
CMS4 mCRC receiving M7824. Tumors ≥ 7.[ADDRESS_499958] diameter should be excluded from 
receiving radiation as part of this study. As previously described, TGFβ represents an immune resistance mechanism via recruitment of immunosuppressive cells and downregulation of existing anti-tumoral responses within the TME. TGF -β signaling may also promote resistance to an 
abscopal phenomenon in patients with mCRC administered  immunotherapy with radiation.  The 
trial design is also justified based on pre -clinical evidence that CMS4  mCRC demonstrate an 
intrinsically  inflamed , immunosuppress ive phenotype mediated by [CONTACT_397311] -β 
signaling.  
Restriction in this study to CMS4 comes from a number of preclinical studies implicating it with 
upregulation of TGF -β activation
43,64,65. Several of the hallmark features i ncluding EMT, stromal 
infiltration, angiogenesis and matrix remodeling are explained by [CONTACT_397312] -β. TGFβ represents an immune resistance mechanism via recruitment of immunosuppressive 
cells and downregulation of existing anti -tumoral responses within the TME
26,66. CMS4  is 
associated with poorer cancer specific outcomes and non- benefit to current adjuvant chemotherapy 
strategies3, and therefore novel effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_397260].   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Cohort D  
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] M7824 in patients with MSS mCRC who have detectable ctDNA following R0 resection of metastatic disease.  The inevitability of disease recurrence for patients with 
colorectal cancer, as seen in the presence of ctDNA following resection of CRC ,suggests existenc e 
of micrometastatic minimal residual disease in these cases.  Given that macroscopic metastases 
may use TGF -β signaling to exclude anti -tumor immune cells from the microenvironment, limiting 
selection of patients with micrometastatic disease may identify a subpopulation of mCRC patients that selectively benefit from immunotherapy.

  • Progression on at least one prior line of systemic therapy for metastatic disease.  
• Prior tissue sampling of primary tumor with core biopsy, endoscopic biopsy, or surgical 
resection to be used for CMS subtype testing. 
4.[ADDRESS_499963] Withdrawal  
4.5.1 Withdrawal from Trial T reatment  
 Subjects will be withdrawn from trial treatment for any of the following reasons:  
• PD as defined by i RECIST 1.1  
o Patients may continue on M7824 until immune confirmed PD (iCPD) provided they 
meet the criteria  for pseudoprogression (see [IP_ADDRESS] below) 
• Therapeutic failure requiring urgent additional cancer therapy  
• Occurrence of any  Grade ≥ 3 ADRs or repetitive Grade 2 ADRs as defined in Section 
[IP_ADDRESS]. 
• Occurrence of AEs, at the Investigator’s discretion  
• Pregnancy 
• Use of prohibited concomitant drug, as defined in Section 5 .5.2, where the predefined 
consequence is withdrawal from the IMP  
• Non-adherence / non -compliance to the trial protocol or trial requirements (see Section 5.9) 
• Withdrawal of consent 
• Participation in any other trial  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pseudoprogression  
Pseudoprogression is defined as an initial disease flare followed by a delayed disease response. At the time of progression, there is no  definitive way to distinguish this from true progressive disease 
without a confirmatory scan.  To account f or pseudoprogression, patients will  have PD, SD, PR or CR recorded as defined by 
[CONTACT_19393] 1.1. However, PD will require a subsequent scan at the next planned tumor assessment 
in [ADDRESS_499964] document ation of PD if:  
o No new Grade [ADDRESS_499965] does not require new anticancer therapy. 
 Failure to sa tisfy all  of these conditions results in discontinuation of M7824.  
Proprietary of MD Anderson Cancer Center
  54/[ADDRESS_499966] be withdrawn if any of the following occur during the trial: 
• Withdrawal of the subject’s consent 
• Participation in any other therapeutic trial during the treatment duration of this trial; 
however, subjects will continue to be followed for survival 
If a subject fails to attend scheduled trial assessments, the Investigator must determine the reasons 
and the circumstances as completely and accurately as possible. 
In case of withdrawal from the trial, the assessments scheduled for the last visit (28 -Day Safety 
Follow- up visit) should be performed (see Section 6.1.3), if possible, with focus on the most 
relevant assessments. In any case, the appropriate 28 -Day Safety Follow -up electronic case report 
form (eCRF) in the Prometheus database visit must be completed. In case of withdrawal, subjects 
will be asked to continue safety and survival follow -up, which includes the collection of data on 
survival and subsequent anticancer therapy. After completion of the Follow-up period or after the End of Treatment visit, whatever is applicable, the appropriate eCRF section for Trial Termination must be completed  in the Prometheus database. 
If a subject is withdrawn prio r to PD for any reason the subject will not be replaced.  
4.6 Premature Termination of the Trial  
For either cohort, the trial may be discontinued prematurely in the event of any of the following: 
New information leading to unfavorable risk-benefit judgment of the IMP, for example, due to 
1. Evidence of inefficacy  of the IMP,  
2. Occurrence of significant previously unknown adverse reactions or unexpectedly high 
intensity or incidence of known adverse reactions, or  
3. Other unfavorable safety  findings. 
(Note: Evidence of inefficacy may arise from this trial or from other trials; unfavorable 
safety findings may arise from clinical or non -clinical examinations, for  example, 
toxicology.)

Only excipi[INVESTIGATOR_397264] M7824 drug product. 
5.2 Dosage and Administration  
5.2.1 M7824 Administration 
Subjects will receive IV infusion of M7824 over 1 hour (-10 minutes / +20 minutes ) once every 2 
weeks as detailed in the Schedules of Assessments (see Tables  1-3) . Modifications of the infusion 
rate due to infusion- related reactions are described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  
The dose for M7824 is 1200mg. In cohorts A -C and  B, subjects will receive M7824 once every 2 
weeks until confirmed progression, unacceptable toxicity, or any criterion for withdrawal from the trial or IMP oc curs (see Section 4.5). Subjects who have experienced a persistent, confirmed PR

Infusion of M7824 will be stopped in case of Grade ≥ 2 hypersensitivity, inflammatory response, 
or anaphylactic reaction. The treatment recommendations for infusion- related reactions and severe 
hypersensitivity reactions according to the NCI are outlined in Sections [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS], respectively.  
Investigators should also monitor subjects closely for potential irAEs  (described in Section 
[IP_ADDRESS]) , which may become manifest after several weeks of treatment. Such events may consist 
of persistent rash, diarrhea and colitis, autoimmune hepatitis, arthritis,  glomerulonephritis, 
cardiomyopathy, or uveitis and other inflammatory eye conditions. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Infusion-related reactions  
IRRs are defined as any signs or symptoms experienced by [CONTACT_397314] [ADDRESS_499979] been reported as anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid reactions , and cytokine 
release syndrome, among other terms used. IRRs are important identified risks (adverse reactions) for M7824, and the precautions and management are  provided in Table 46

NSAIDs = nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs  
Additional Modifications for Subjects with Grad e 2 Infusion -related Reactions  
If, in the event of a Grade 2 infusion- related reaction that does not improve or worsens after 
implementation of the modifications indicated in Table 7 (including reducing the infusion rate by 
50%), the Investigator may consider treatment with corticosteroids and the infusion of IMP should be stopped for that day. At the next infusion, the Investigator may consider the addition of H2-blocker antihistamines (for example, famotidine or ranitidine), in addition to premedication, for select subjects. However, prophylactic steroids are NOT permitted. If the subject has a second infusion- related reaction Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_499980] removed from M7824 treatment. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions and Flu- like Symptoms  
If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, the subject must be treated according to the best available medical practice. A complete guideline for the emergency treatment of anaphylactic reactions according to the Working Group of the Resuscitation Council ([LOCATION_008]) and can be found at https://www.resus.org.uk/pages/reaction.pdf. Subjects should be instructed to report any delayed reactions to  the Investigator immediately.  
A. Symptoms 
• Impaired airway  
• Decreased oxygen saturation (< 92%)  
Proprietary of MD Anderson Cancer Center
  61/106 
  • Confusion 
• Lethargy 
• Hypotension 
• Pale / clammy skin  
• Cyanosis 
B. Management  
1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_107905] 
2. Patient should be placed on cardiac, blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation 
monitor immediately  
3. Alert intensive care unit for possible transfer if required  
For prophylaxis of flu- like symptoms, a NSAID, for example, ibuprofen 400 mg or comparable 
NSAID dose, may be administered 2 hours before and 8 hours after the start of each dose of M7824 IV infusion. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Immune- Related Adverse Events  
For reporting irAE severity/toxicity grading, refer to CTCAE v4.03 toxicity grading system. 
For treatment management of irAE per CTCAE v4.03 criteria, refer to American Society of 
Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Clinical Practice Guidelines and National Comprehensive Cancer 
Network  irAE Management Guidelines.  
Treatment of irAEs is mainly dependent upon severity as defined by [CONTACT_12134] -CTCAE v4.03. In 
general, management by [CONTACT_3989] v4.03 grading, as per ASCO, is listed below: 
• Grade 1: study treatment should be continued with close monitoring, with the exception of some 
neurologic, hematologic, and cardiac toxicit ies.  
• Grade 2: study treatment may be suspended for most Grade 2 toxicities, with consideration of resuming when symptoms revert to Grade 1 or less. Corticosteroids may be administered (initial dose of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent).  
• Grad e 3: study treatment is generally suspended and the high -dose corticosteroids (prednisone 
1 to 2 mg/kg/day or methylprednisolone 1 to 2 mg/kg/day) treatment should be initiated. Corticosteroids should be tapered over the course of at least 4 to 6 weeks. So me refractory cases 
may require infliximab or other immunosuppressive therapy.  
• Grade 4: in general, permanent discontinuation of study treatment is recommended, with the exception of endocrinopathies that have been controlled by [CONTACT_108089]. 
Proprietary of MD Anderson Cancer Center
  62/106 
  Since  inhibition of PD -L1 stimulates the immune system, irAEs may occur. Treatment of irAEs is 
mainly dependent upon severity (NCI- CTCAE grade):  
• Grade 1 to 2: treat symptomatically or with moderate dose steroids, more frequent 
monitoring 
• Grade 1 to 2 (persistent): manage similar to high grade AE (Grade 3 to 4)  
• Grade 3 to 4: treat with high dose corticosteroids  
Treatment of irAEs should follow guidelines set forth in the ASCO/NCCN Management of 
Immunotherapy- Related Toxicities 
(https://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/pdf/immunotherapy.pdf ). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Anemia  
Anemia is considered a potential risk based on toxicological findings with M7824 in cynomolgus monkey indicating a  decrease in Hgb, RBCs, and hematocrit that was fully reversible or showed a 
substantial trend toward recovery. 
Notably, there are many reasons for anemia in patients with advanced 
cancer, which is why a thorough investigation of new anemia cases of unspecified etiology is requested.  
 Risk management measures in addition to routine laboratory tests will include:  
• Subjects must enter the study with Hgb values at least 9 g/dL , independent of recent (≤ 28 
days) packed red blood cell transfusion and/or use of an erythropoietin- stimulating agent.  
• Routine monitoring of Hgb will be performed every 2 weeks (prior to treatment). 
o Instructions for study treatment discontinuation or modification in case of anemia will be provided, briefly described here: In  case of any Hgb < 8 g/dL, the 
Investigator should use discretion to initiate anemia work up, including Coombs, haptoglobin, indirect bilirubin and peripheral smear, and prothrombin time (PT), 
activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), international normalized ratio  
(INR); Hgb  and hematocrit are to be closely monitored. 
 
• For new anemia events assessed as treatment-related, items queried may include but are not 
limited to detailed relevant past medical and treatment history, bruising tendency, history of 
blood transfusions and/or dependency, and a request for an updated eCRF including details such 
as concomitant medications, all laboratory data, updated dosing information and recent tumor 
evaluation scans.  
• If a subject experiences significant anemia, then the amount of  blood to be drawn may be 
reduced by [CONTACT_397315]-L1 target occupancy, 
immunomonitoring, soluble factors, and TGFβ. The decision to reduce the time points for 
these biomarkers will be taken by [CONTACT_397316] .

6.1.1 Screening and Baseline Procedures and Assessments  
There is a 28-day washout / recovery period for prior anticancer treatment (for example, 
cytoreductive therapy, radiotherapy [with the exception of palliative radiotherapy delivered in a normal organ- spearing technique], immune therapy, or cytokine therapy except for erythropoietin) 
and major surgery before the start of trial treatment (Section 4.3.2). Hematology and chemistry laboratory samples must be drawn and reviewed within 72 hours prior to dose administration.  
During the screening period and before any trial related investigations and assessments are started, the subjects will be asked to sign the relevant ICFs. The subjects’ information that will be documented during screening includes the demographic information (birth date, sex, ethnicity, and race) and the complete medical history, including the history of the tumor disease and prior anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], previous medications (prior 30 days to signing of ICF), concomitant medications, and baseline medical con dition (the information of concomitant medications and AEs 
will be monitored throughout the trial treatment period).  
During screening, subjects will undergo a complete physical examination, dermatological assessments (assessments for skin lesions or rash with biopsy of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_148352]), recording

includes hematology, full serum chemistry and full urinalysis. Antinuclear antibody (ANAs), 
rheumatoid factor (RF), free thyroxine (T4), and TSH will also be assessed at screening.  
During screening, a serum β -human chorionic gonadotropin (β -HCG) pregnancy test will be 
perfo rmed for females of child bearing potential and blood.  HIV, HBV, and HCV testing will be 
performed for all screening subjects as these conditions are trial entry exclusion criteria. A female is considered of childbearing potential (that is fertile) follow ing menarche and until becoming 
postmenopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], and bilateral oophorectomy. A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an al ternative medical cause. A high follicle-
stimulating hormone (FSH) level (> 40 mIU/mL) in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in females not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy.  
For Cohort D, pati ents will be screened for the presence or absence of ctDNA in the screening 
period prior to treatment initiation.  
Additional blood will be collected  during screening for  exploratory blood biomarkers including 
circulating cytokines and leukocyte subpopulations (Section 6.4.5). 
The tumor evaluation (type / staging, etc.) will be performed using CT scan or MRI (if MRI is 
used, CT of chest is mandatory.  
Collection of tumor biopsies or archived surgical specimen will also be done during this period, if 
applicable and at 4 weeks into the study (prior to dose 3)  for cohort A -C. For cohort B, tumor 
biopsies will be collected pretreatment, prior to dose 2, and prior to dose 4.  ] Pretreatment and /or 
post- treatment biopsies will be subjected to assessment of immune infiltration, expression of PD -

drawn and results available and verified prior to re- initiating of treatment.  
Subjects will be a sked to visit the investigational site according to the Schedules of Assessments 
(see Tables  1-3) . In addition, the tumor evaluation (see Section 6.3) has a tumor assessment 
visiting time window of 5 days prior to dosing ( -5 days). Furthermore, if any Screening procedures 
are conducted within 3 days prior to Day 1 of trial treatment ( Cycle 1, Day 1), the assessments 
scheduled on Cycle 1 , Day 1 do not need to be repeated except for the evaluation of AEs and

pregnancy test will be performed prior to each administration of the study drug (if 
applicable). 
• The tumor evaluation (see Section 6.3) will be performed prior to treatment at week 8 , and 
then once every 8 weeks, with a tumor assessment visiting time window of 5 days prior to dosing. For subjects continuing treatment beyond 12 months (in consultation with the principal investigator ), tumor evaluations should take place every 12 weeks. 
• Tumor biopsies at Week 4, prior to the third treatment dose ( -7 day window permitted).  
Archival tissue may be used in place of a fresh pretreatment biopsy if adequate tum or is 
available for analysis.  If insufficient tissue is available for analysis for pretreatment tumor, then a mandatory fresh  biopsy must be obtained. In cohort A, the site of tumor tissue for 
the pretreatment sample, whether archival or fresh, may be fro m the primary tumor or the 
metastasis. In cohort B, the site of tumor for the pretreatment sample, in order to classify the CMS subtype, must come from the primary tumor.  The week 4, on- treatment biopsy 
for both cohorts may come from the primary tumor or from a metastatic site.  
• Free T4, and TSH will be measured prior to trial treatment according to Tables  1-3. 
• The exploratory blood biomarkers including circulating cytokines and leukocyte 
subpopulations will be performed as det ailed in Tables  1-3 as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] 
• Samples for TGFβ determination will be drawn as detailed in Tables  1-3. 
6.1.3 End of Treatment 
[IP_ADDRESS]  End of Treatment Visit 
All subjects must undergo an End-of- Treatment visit after discontinuation of M7824 for any 
reason. This visit should be performed on the day of or within 7 days after the decision to discontinue trial treatment but before any new antineoplastic therapy is started (if possible), whichever occurs earlier (see Tables  1-3). If it is known to the Investigator at the time of the End 
of- Treatment visit that the subject will start new treatment within [ADDRESS_499993] treatment, assessments associated with the 28 -Day 
Safety Follow-up visit may be conducted at the End-of- Treatment visit. For all these subjects, the 
discontinuation visit consists of: 
• Documentation of AEs and concomitant medication. 
• Physical examination including vital signs and body weight. 
• Eye signs and symptoms should be checked. If clinically relevant findings then an appropriate ophthalmology examination including slit lamp evaluation inclusive of the anterior segment and with visual acuity should be obtained within 2 days.

6.2.8 ctDNA testing  
Guardant360 is a next -generation sequencing (NGS) panel of 70 clinically actionable onco- and 
tumor suppressor genes utilizing digital sequencing of cell -free circulating tumor DNA (cfDNA) 
isolated from a simple, non- invasive blood draw. It is medically in dicated for the prevention of a 
repeat invasive biopsy in advanced cancer patients when the initial biopsy is insufficient (QNS) or unavailable/unobtainable as well as when cancer has progressed or recurred despi[INVESTIGATOR_2391]. The test detects single nucleo tide variants via complete exon sequencing in 70 genes, copy number 
Proprietary of MD Anderson Cancer Center
  75/[ADDRESS_500007] FDA -approved matched therapi[INVESTIGATOR_342836], as 
well as non- druggable genes with high prevalence alterations that may be helpful in monitoring 
for molecular response/non-response such as TP53.  
Guardant360 is an advanced diagnostic laboratory test (ADLT) offered by a sole source laboratory 
certified by [CONTACT_397320] (CLIA) for high complexity (molecular pathology) testing and accredited by [CONTACT_397321] (CAP). D ue 
to high rates of false positives with traditional NGS assays when tumor DNA is in low concentrations, the majority of “liquid biopsy” methods interrogating cell -free DNA have been 
limited to hotspot analyses. In contrast, the ultra -high specificity (> 9 9.9999%) of the digital 
sequencing method enables the sequencing of long, targeted regions (146,000 base pairs) without false positives. Complete exons are sequenced for all exons in 30 genes and the critical exons (those reported as having a somatic mutat ion in COSMIC) in 40 additional genes. Thus, its key 
differentiating characteristic from other “liquid biopsy” methods is the ability to sequence complete exons in many genes, in contrast to gene hotspot testing. 
Advantages of  the Guardant360 cell -free DNA NGS methodology versus solid tumor tissue -based 
NGS are:  
1. An invasive needle or surgical biopsy is avoided with ctDNA, reducing 
costs and complications.  
2. CtDNA provides a quantitative measure (concentration or mutant allele 
frequency) of mutations pre sent whereas solid tumor biopsy typi[INVESTIGATOR_397273] a qualitative result (mutation either present or not detected). The quantitative cfDNA result may be followed over time to monitor response to treatment and evolution of acquired resistance. 
3. Ct DNA seque ncing identifies both germline and somatic mutations in the 
same sample.  
4. The assay failure rate is for ct DNA is less than 0.5% (in the first 9,000+ 
samples) compared to 15% -25% failure rates of tissue -based NGS related 
to insufficient quantity of tissue (QNS).  
 
Guardant360 utilizes algorithmic methods to encode and ultimately decode inputs and outputs 
from massively parallel deep sequencing analysis. By [CONTACT_397322]- transmission, this NGS method, known as Digital SequencingTM, enables signal interference 
to be reduced by [CONTACT_342904] 
(88).  Four validation studies have been published 
with concordance to tissue  biopsy- based genomic testing (88-91). With high enough sensitivity and 
specificity to robustly quantitate ctDNA from blood, this approach has the potential to evaluate the multiple genomic targets required in NCCN guidelines, to act as a “summary” of the different tumor clones in patients with intra -tumor and inter -tumor heterogeneity, and to prevent the time 
Proprietary of MD Anderson Cancer Center
  76/106 
  delays, costs and complications inherent in invasive biopsies. The analytical and clinical validation 
of Guardant360 is conducted in conformance with evidentiary standards established by [CONTACT_397323] (STARD), REporting of tumor MARKer Studies (REMARK), Evaluation of Genomic Applications in Practice and Prevention (EGAPP), and the recent Next -generation Sequencing: Standardization of Clinical Testing (Nex -StoCT) biomarker 
guidelines 
(92-95). 
Methodology 
The gene panel was selected to focus on those genomic alterations that are currently actionable 
defined as being targets of sensitivity or resistance to an FDA -approved matched therapy and/or a 
targeted therapy in clinical trials. The test simultaneously sequences the 70 cancer -related genes 
to an average depth of coverage of greater than 8,000X. To summarize, cell -free DNA is extracted 
from plasma and genomic alterati ons are analyzed by [CONTACT_397324] -by-
sequencing of amplified target genes utilizing an Illumina Next -Seq platform complemented by 
[CONTACT_342907] -to-end process optimization including conversion of cell -free DNA fragments into 
digital sequences, improvements in the Illumina next generation sequencing process itself, 
followed by [CONTACT_342908] a quantitative percentage of total cell -free DNA.  
Two 10mls of whole blood are collected in S treck Cell -Free DNA Blood Collection (Streck) tubes, 
which contain a proprietary formaldehyde -free preservative in that stabilizes white blood cells, 
preventing the release of genomic DNA and allowing shippi[INVESTIGATOR_397274], cold bricks or preliminary centrifugation prior to shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
After digital libraries are produced, the sample is sequenced and post -sequencing data is processed 
using bioinformatics algorithms to quantify the absolute number of unique DNA f ragments at a 
given nucleotide position. This proprietary process is referred to as Digital SequencingTM and 
enables reporting of the fractional concentration (mutant allele frequency) of a given SNV. 
Circulating cell -free DNA is mostly derived from leukocyte lysis (germline) and generally a much 
smaller amount of tumor DNA is derived from cancer cell apoptosis/necrosis. All of the cell -free 
DNA fragments, including leukocyte -derived and tumor -derived, are simultaneously sequenced 
with up to single molecule  sensitivity. In other words, both tumor DNA and “normal”/germline 
DNA are sequenced and measured in the same sequencing assay. The fractional concentration or 
mutant allele frequency for a given mutation is calculated as the fraction of circulating tumor DNA harboring that mutation in a background of wild- type cell -free DNA fragments. The analytic 
sensitivity reaches detection of [ADDRESS_500008] and genomic alterations in the Guardant360 Panel

CT of chest is mandatory . All the scans performed at baseline and other imaging performed as 
clinically required (other supportive imaging) need to be repeated at subsequent visits. In general, lesions detected at baseline need to be followed using the same imaging methodology and preferably the same imaging equipment at subsequent tumor evaluation visits. 
Skin metastasis can be used as target lesions according to i RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_500010], the Investigator will designate 1 or more of the following measures of 
tumor status to follow for determining response: CT or MRI images of primary and / or metastatic 
tumor masses, physical examination findings, and the results of other assessments. All available images collected during the trial period will be considered. The most appropriate measures to evaluate the tumor status of a subject should be used. The measure(s) to be chosen for sequential evaluation during the trial have to correspond to the measures used to document the progressive tumor status that qualifies the subject for enrollment. The tumor response assessment will be assessed and listed according to the Schedule of Assessments (refer to Ta bles 1-3).  
The foreseen treatment duration is until documentation of PD, unacceptable toxicity, or any criterion for withdrawal from the trial or IMP occurs (see Section 4.5).  
Proprietary of MD Anderson Cancer Center
  78/[ADDRESS_500011] does not tolerate M7824 anymore or 
if therapeutic failure occurs, which requires urgent treatment with an additional drug or results in clinically significant progression / deterioration.  
Tumor responses to treatment will be assigned based on the evaluation of the response o f target, 
non-target, and new lesions according to iRECIST 1.1 (all measurements should be recorded in 
metric notation).  
• To assess objective response, the tumor burden at baseline will be estimated and used for comparison with subsequent measurements. At baseline, tumor lesions will be categorized in target and non-target lesions according to iRECIST 1.[ADDRESS_500012] 1.1.  
The Investigator may perform scans in addition to a scheduled trial scan for medical reasons or if 
the Investigator suspects PD.  
As outlined in Section 4.1, treatment should continue with M7824 if the patient has PD provided: 
• There are no new Grade 2 or greater symptoms or significant worsening of existing symptoms.  
• There is no decrease in ECOG PS.  
• In the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], the subject does not require new anticancer therapy. 
PD and any of the above conditions not satisfied results in study discontinuation.  
Subjects who have experienced a confirmed PR or CR should continue  treatment through the end 
of [ADDRESS_500013] (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]). Given the intended MoA, particular attention will be given to AEs that may follow the enhanced T -cell 
activation such as persistent rash, diarrhea and colitis, autoimmune hepatitis, arthritis, glomerulonephritis, cardiomyopathy, uveitis and other inflammatory eye conditions, or other 
immune -related reactions. Ophthalmologic examinations should be considered, when clinically 
indicated, for signs or symptoms of uveitis. Furthermore, due to the anti -TGFβ activity, particular 
Proprietary of MD Anderson Cancer Center
  79/106 
  attention will also be given to events associated with , anemia, and rash with hyperkeratosis / 
keratoacanthoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.  
The reporting period for AEs is described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
The safety assessments will be performed according to the Schedules of Assessments (see Tables  
1-3).  
6.4.1 Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event Definitions  
Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product, regardless of causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
For surgical or diagnostic procedures, the condition / illness leading to such a procedure is 
considered as the AE rather than the procedure itself.  
In case of a fatality, the cause of death is considered as an AE, and the death is considered as its OUTCOME.  
The investigator (or physician designee) is responsible for verifying and providing source documentation, grading the severity and assigning the attribution for all adverse events. 
Investigators will reference the NCI -CTCAE v4.03 (publication date: 17 November 2017), a 
descriptive terminology that can be used for AE reporting. A general grading (severity / intensity; hereafter referred to as severity) scale is provided at the 
beginning of the above referenced document, and specific event Grades are also provided. 
If a particular AE’s severity is not specifically graded by [CONTACT_43970], the Investigator 
is to use the general NCI -CTCAE definitions of Grade [ADDRESS_500014] 
medical judgment. 
Grade 1 : Mild  
Grade 2 :  Moderate  
Grade 3 : Severe  
Grade 4 : Life-threatening  
Grade 5 :  Death  
Proprietary of MD Anderson Cancer Center
  80/[ADDRESS_500015] also be reported as an SAE as per Section 
[IP_ADDRESS]; however, a laboratory abnormality of Grade 4, such as anemia or neutropenia, is considered serious only if the condition meets one of the serious criteria described below. 
If death occurs, the primary cause of death or event leading to death should be recorded and 
reported as an SAE. “Fatal” will be recorded as the outcome of this specific event and death will not be recorded as separate event. Only, if no cause of death can be reported (for example, sudden death, unexplained death), the death per se might then be reported as an SAE. 
Investigators must also systematically assess the causal relationship of AEs to the IMP using the 
following definitions. Decisive factors for the assessment of causal relationship of an AE to the 
Proprietary of MD Anderson Cancer Center
  81/106 
  M7824 include, but may not be limited to, temporal relationship between the AE and the M7824, 
the known safety profile of M7824, medical history, concomitant medication, course of the 
underlying disease, trial procedures.  
Unrelated : Not reasonably related to the IMP. The AE could not medically (pharmacologically / 
clinically) be attributed to the IMP  under study in this clinical trial protocol.  A reasonable 
alternative explanation must be available. 
Related : Reasonably related to the IMP. The AE could medically (pharmacologically / clinically) 
be attributed to the IMP under study in this clinical trial protocol.  
Abnormal Laboratory Findings and Other Abnormal Investigational Findings  
Abnormal laboratory findings and other abnormal investigational findings (for example, on an 
EKG trace) should not be reported as AEs unless they are associated with clinical signs and 
symptoms, lead to treatment discontinuation or are considered otherwise medically important by [CONTACT_737]. If a laboratory abnormality fulfills these criteria, the identified medical condition (for example, anemia, increased ALT) must be reported as the AE rather than the abnormal value itself.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or [COMPANY_006]/EMD Serono , it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• A life -threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse experience that places the patient, 
in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse experience as it occurred. It does not include an adverse experience that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] • A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_45790] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an  emergency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse (21 CFR 312.32). 
Proprietary of MD Anderson Cancer Center
  82/106 
  • Important medical events as defined above, may also be considered serious adverse events. 
Any important medical event can and should be reported as an SAE if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_1268] [INVESTIGATOR_397275].  
• All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the definition of a SAE 
must be report ed to the IRB in accordance with the timeframes and procedures outlined in “The 
University of [LOCATION_007] M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board Policy for Investigators on Reporting Serious Unanticipated Adverse Events for Drugs and Devices”.  Unless stated otherwise in the protocol, all SAEs, expected or unexpected, must be reported to the IND Office, regardless of attribution (within 5 working days of knowledge of the event). 
• All life -threatening or fatal events, that are unexpected, and rel ated to the study drug, must 
have a written report submitted within 24 hours (next working day) of knowledge of the event to 
the Safety Project Manager in the IND Office.   
• Unless otherwise noted, the electronic SAE application (eSAE) will be utilized fo r safety 
reporting to the IND Office and MDACC IRB.  • Serious adverse events will be captured from the time of the first protocol -specific 
intervention, until [ADDRESS_500016] returned to baseline, progression of the event has stabilized, or there has been acceptable resolution of the event. 
• Additionally, any serious adverse events that occur after the [ADDRESS_500017] be reported to the IND Office. This may include the 
development of a secondary malignancy. 
 Reporting to FDA : 
• Serious adverse events will be forwarded to FDA by [CONTACT_62680] (Safety Project Manager 
IND Office) according to 21 CFR 312.32.  It is the responsibility of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_195697], Good Clinical Practices, the protocol guidelin es, [COMPANY_006]/EMD Serono ’s guidelines, and Institutional Review Board policy.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Events Not to Be Considered as AEs / SAEs  
Medical conditions present at the initial trial visit that do not worsen in severity or frequency during the trial are defined as Baseline Medical Conditions, and are not to be considered AEs. 
AE / SAEs Observed in Association with Disease Progression  
Proprietary of MD Anderson Cancer Center
  83/106 
  Progression of the disease / disorder being studied assessed by [CONTACT_397325] (including 
laboratory abnormalities) should not be reported as an AE / SAE, unless the subject’s general condition is more severe than expected and / or unless the outcome is fatal within the AE reporting period (as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_500018] (AESI) for Safety 
Monitoring  
Any AE that is suspi[INVESTIGATOR_397276] a potential irAE (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]), including ophthalmologic 
findings, has to be reported in an expeditious manner and will be considered an A E of special 
interest (AESI).  
Infusion- related reactions / hypersensitivity, regardless of grade, must be reported as AESIs.  
In addition, rash with hyperkeratosis / keratoacanthoma / squamous cell cancer of the skin are 
regarded as AESIs. Please note that squamous cell cancer of the skin should be considered as medically important condition and thus as a serious AESI, which has to be reported in an expedited manner as a SAE.  
Anemia when considered related to M7824 will be reported as AESI reg ardless of  grade. 
 The reporting of AESI is defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Methods of Recording and Assessing Adverse Events 
At each trial visit, the subject will be queried on changes in his or her condition. During the reporting period, any unfavorable changes in the  subject’s condition will be recorded as AEs, 
whether reported by [CONTACT_9303]. 
Complete, accurate and consistent data on all AEs experienced for the duration of the reporting 
period (defined below) will be reported on an ongoing basis in the appropriate section of the eCRF  
(Prometheus) . All SAEs and all non- serious AEs of special interest must be additionally 
documented and reported using the e SAE database. 
It is important that each AE report include a description of the event, its duration (onset and resolution dates and times to be co mpleted when it is important to assess the time of AE onset 
relative to the recorded treatment administration time), its severity, its causal relationship with the trial treatment, any other potential causal factors, any treatment given or other action tak en, 
including dose modification or discontinuation of the IMP, and its outcome. In addition, serious cases should be identified and the appropriate seriousness criteria documented.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Investigator Communications with [COMPANY_006]/EMD Serono 
• In addition to the regular reporting obligations, the following reportable events must be submitted to EMD Serono within 48 hours for fatal/life -threatening SAEs and 5 business days

[IP_ADDRESS]  Definition of the Adverse Event Reporting Period 
The AE reporting period for safety surveillance from the firs t protocol intervention to [ADDRESS_500019] study drug administration and continues through the trial’s 28 -Day Safety Follow -up visit, 
defined as 28 days (± 5 days) after last trial drug administration. After the 28- Day Safety Follow -
up visit only AEs that are deemed attributable to trial drug by [CONTACT_397327] -up visit, defined as 28 days (+/ - 7 days)  after the last trial drug 
administration. 
Any SAE assessed as related to M7824 must be reported whenever it occurs, irrespective of the 
time elapsed since the last administration of M7824.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Procedure for Reporting Serious Adverse Events, Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Serious Adverse Events 
In the event of any new SAE occurring during the reporting period, the Investigator must 
immediately (within a maximum 24 hours after becoming aware of the event) inform the IND Office and/or [COMPANY_006]/EMD Serono  using the SAE Report Form following specific completion 
instructions.  
In exceptional circumstances, a SAE (or follow -up information) may be reported by [CONTACT_756]; in 
these cases SAE Report Form must be provided immediately thereafter.  
Reporting procedures and timelines are the same for any new information on a previously reported SAE (= follow -up). 
Proprietary of MD Anderson Cancer Center
  85/106 
  Relevant pages from the eCRF (Prometheus) may be provided in parallel (for example, medical 
history, concomitant drugs). Additional documents may be provided by [CONTACT_737], if 
available (for example, laboratory results, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27450], and autopsy report). In all cases, the information provided on the SAE Report Form must be consistent with the data about the event recorded in the eCRF  (Prometheus). 
The Investigator must respond to any request for follow- up information (for example, additional 
information, outcome final evaluation, other records where needed) or to any question the IND Office and/or [COMPANY_006]/EMD Serono  may have on the AE within the same timelines as those noted 
above for initial reports. This is necessary to ensure a prompt assessment of the event by [CONTACT_397328]/or [COMPANY_006]/EMD Serono and (as applicable) to allow the IND Office to meet strict 
regula tory timelines associated with expedited safety reporting obligations.  
Adverse Events of Special Interest  
In the event of a non- serious Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_500020] report the AESI using the 
eSAE database within 5 days, and the logs should be provided to [COMPANY_006]/EMD Serono every [ADDRESS_500021] to be reported in an expedited manner as SAEs within 24 hours a s 
outlined above, and reported to EMD Safety. For Grade 1 and Grade 2 non- serious AESIs, results 
from  the eSAE database should be forwarded to [COMPANY_006]/EMD Serono every 3 months.  
Safety Report to Health Authorities, Independent Ethics Committees / Institutional Review Boards and Investigators 
The IND Office will send appropriate safety notifications to Health Authorities in accordance wit h 
applicable laws and regulations. The Investigator must comply with any applicable site -specific requirements related to the 
reporting of SAEs (particularly deaths) involving trial subjects to the IEC / IRB that approved the 
trial. 
In accordance with ICH GCP guidelines, [COMPANY_006]/EMD Serono  will inform the Investigator of 
“findings that could adversely affect the safety of subjects, impact the conduct of the trial, or alter the IEC’s / IRB’s approval / favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_150831].” In particular and in line with respective regulations, [COMPANY_006]/EMD Serono will inform the Investigator of AEs that are both serious and unexpected and are considered to be related to the administered product (suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions [S[LOCATION_003]Rs]).

  [IP_ADDRESS]  Monitoring of Subjects with Adverse Events  
Adverse events are recorded  and assessed continuously throughout the trial (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) 
and are assessed for final outcome at the End of Treatment visit. After the End of Treatment visit 
only AEs that are deemed attributable to trial drug by [CONTACT_397329]-up visit. 
All SAEs ongoing at the 28- Day Safety Follow -up visit must be monitored and followed up by [CONTACT_108102], unless the subject is documented as 
“lost to follow -up”. In addition, all trial drug related SAEs occurring after [ADDRESS_500022] be made and documented. It is also the 
responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that any necessary additional therapeutic measures and follow-up procedures are performed. 
6.4.2 Pregnancy and In Utero Drug Exposure 
Only pregnancies considered by [CONTACT_166876] (for example, resulting from a drug interaction with a contraceptive medication) are considered to be AEs; however, all pregnancies with an estimated conception date during the period defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] must be recorded by [CONTACT_397330] / section of the eCRF  (Prometheus) . The 
same rule applies to pregnancies in female subjects and to pregnancies in female partners of male subjects. The Investigator must also notify the IND Office  in an expedited manner of any 
pregnancy using the Paper Pregnancy Report Form, which must be transmitted according to the same timelines as described for SAE reporting in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Investigators must actively follow up, document and report on the outcome of all these 
pregnancies, even if the subjects are withdrawn from the trial.  
The Investigator must notify the IND Office  of these outcomes using the Pregnancy Report Form. 
If an abnormal outcome occurs, the SAE Report Form will be used if the subject sustains an event and the Parent-Child / Fetus Adverse Event Report Form if the child / fetus sustains an event. 
Any abnormal outcome must be reported in an expedited manner as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS], 
while normal outcomes must be reported within [ADDRESS_500023] of laboratory normal ranges before 
shipment of IMP. Any change in laboratory normal ranges during the trial will additionally be forwarded to  the IND Office .

(PCR).  
If a subject has a clinically significant abnormal laboratory test value that is not present at Baseline, 
the test will be repeated weekly and the subject will be followed until the test value has returned to the normal range or the Investigator has determined that the abnormality is c hronic or stable.  
For pharmacokinetic assessment of M7824 , a blood sample should be collected prior to infusion 
of M7824 and following completion (within 30 minutes) of infusion of M7824 (doses 1 and 3), 
prior to dose 2, and prior to dose 6/end of treatment visit (whichever of these two comes first) .  
Samples should be processed as follows: 
1.  Collect 3.[ADDRESS_500025] tube with silica clot activator and polymer gel. 2. Gently invert the tube 5 times to mix the clot activator with the blood.  
3. Allow blood to clot for 30 minutes at room temperature in a vertical position.  
4.  After allowing clot to form, centrifuge the tube for 15 minutes at 1100- 1300x g at 25°C.   
     If refrigerated centrifuge is available, set the temperature at 25°C in order to  prevent  
     heating during centrifugation and to optimize flow of the barrier material.  Flow may  
     be impeded if chilled before or during centrifugation. 5. Carefully collect and aliquot the serum equally into [ADDRESS_500026] t he tubes immediately into the freezer in an upright position at -80°C. 
7.  Samples will be analyzed as a batch with EMD Serono at a later date.  
6.4.4 Vital Signs, Physical Examinations, and Other Assessments 
The ECOG PS will be assessed at Screening and at subsequent visits as indicated in the Schedules of Assessments ( Tables  1-3) and documented in the eCRF (Prometheus). 
Body weight will be measured at Screening and at subsequent visits as indicated in the Schedules of Assessments ( Tables  1-3) and documented in the eCRF  (Prometheus) . Body height will be 
measured at screening only.  
A physical examination will be conducted at Screening and at subsequent visits as indicated in the Schedules of Assessments ( Tables  1-3) and documented in the eCRF  (detailed description in 
Section 6.1). Any abnormalities arising or worsening after the signing of the ICF should be 
Proprietary of MD Anderson Cancer Center
  89/106 
  documented in the eCRF  (Prometheus) Adverse Event section (see Section 6.4.1). Abnormal 
findings are to be reassessed at subsequent visits.  
Physical examination should include a dermatological examination.  If abnormal skin findings are 
observed, the  patient should be referred to a dermatologist for biopsy of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_148352]. 
An ophthalmology examination including slit lamp evaluation inclusive of the anterior segment and with visual acuity should be conducted at Screening. At subsequent visits, eye signs and symptoms should be checked. If there are any clinically relevant findings then an appropriate ophthalmology examination including slit lamp evaluation inclusive of the anterior segment and with visual acuity should be obtained within [ADDRESS_500027] should be available prior to the next dosing of IMP. Subjects who are postmenopausal (age -related amenorrhea ≥ 12 consecutive months and 
if needed FSH > 40 mIU/mL [in the postmenopausal range] as outlined in Section 6.1.1), or who have undergone hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy are exempt from pregnancy testing. If necessary to confirm postmenopausal status, an FSH will be drawn at Screening. 
6.4.5 Biomarkers  
Due to limited understanding of the biological activities induced by M7824 in cancer subjects, there can be no certainty t hat the doses examined will be associated with relevant antitumor 
immune activities. Further details regarding translational studies are listed in Appendix 3.  As the consequence, the trial will serve to  
1. Evaluate MSI -H status with CMS subtype 
a. MSI will be assessed by [CONTACT_40851]-H CRC either by [CONTACT_397331] 4 mismatch repair proteins (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2) or by [CONTACT_397332]  (as per institutional practices ) 
b. External MSI testing  in a CLIA certified laboratory with a documentation of MSI -
H status performed pr ior to screening  is acceptable for inclusion in cohort A- C.  
2. Evaluate PD -L1 expression as a predictor of response 
a. Primary tumor will be stained for PD -L1 expression by [CONTACT_4658] 
b. PD-L1 staining will be semi -quantitatively scored by [CONTACT_21514], weak, moderate,  
strong by a pathologist 
Proprietary of MD Anderson Cancer Center
  90/[ADDRESS_500028] o n TGFβ concentrations in plasma.  
4. Evaluate potential predictive / prognostic biomarker candidates related to the drug and / or 
the cancer (such as the CMS, immune infiltrating populations, systemic cytokine profiles) 
a. CMS wi ll be assessed using a [ADDRESS_500029] gene expression by [CONTACT_397333]: 
1. A 75 gene model had 4 group CMS accuracy of 87.1% with very high accuracies (>90%) in CMS1 and CMS2 groups which were over-represented in this small cohort 
2. The CMS4 versus other subgroups demonstrated accuracy of 90.6%  
3. The Nanostring technology on FF PE has been successfully applied 
to breast cancer
67 and lymphoma68 cohorts 
4. The Nanostring codesets utilized for the CMS classification are now being assessed for technical  validity in MDA’s CLIA  molecular 
pathology laboratory  
 
b. Immune infiltrating populations will be analyzed by [CONTACT_61836] (IHC), 
and Multiplex IF analyses. 
1. IHC markers will include, but are not limited to, PD -L1, CD3, 
Foxp3, CD25, CD8, CD68, CD56, CD20, CD45RO and granzyme 
B. We may also include PD -L2, B7- H3, B7 -x/H4, galectin 9, 
HVEM and CD48 to measure in tumors and PD-1, 2B4, LAG -3, 
Tim-3 and BTLA in TILs. These studies will be conducted at TMP -
IL. 
2. Multiplex IF Analysis. Up to 10 immune markers, 2 panels may be 
utilized. Currently, there are 2 Vectra panels optimized: Panel#1, 
CD3, CD8, CD68, PD -L1, PD -1 pan-cytoker atin and DAPI; Panel 
#2, CD20, CD45RO, FOXP3, Granzyme B, CD57, pan-cytokeratin 
and DAPI.  A third myeloid panel will be developed. For multiplex 
IF analysis, we will use the Opal chemistry and multispectral 
microscopy Vectra system (Perkin -Elmer) which in cludes the 
Nuance software; analysis will be performed using the InForm software. Additional markers will be selected according the results of the gene expression analysis and may include other 
Proprietary of MD Anderson Cancer Center
  91/106 
  immunotherapy targets (e.g., OX -40, Vista, GITR, TIM -3, LAG -3, 
NKp46/CD16, etc.) and proliferation markers (e.g., Ki67).  
3. RNAscope.  TGF -β and other additional markers may be analyzed 
by [CONTACT_397334].  
c. Immune infiltrating populations and systemic cytokine profiles 
i. Blood collections and biopsies prior to week 8 treatment will be collected for 
immune studies under the supervision of the Translational Molecular Pathology Immunoprofiling Lab (TMP -IL) at MD Anderson. 
ii. In tumor tissue, IHC studies will be performed to evaluate CD3
+, CD4+ and 
CD8+ T cells, T reg, NK cells, macrophage [M1/2 profile] infiltrating populations. 
Fresh tissue will be available for flow cytometry analysis on larger tumor samples only. We will assess the proportion of MDSC, macrophage, DC and NK cell subsets within the Live CD45+ cells in pan el 3. The expression of checkpoint 
ligands will be explored using panel 4. Live cells will be sub- gated as CD45 -
negative to exclude immune cells. EPCAM will be used as a marker of tumor cells and CD90 as a fibroblast marker. The expression of CD80, CD86, G ITR-
L, ICOS -L, MIC A/B, B7 -H3, B7 -H4, CD73, PD -L2, OX40L and other relevant 
immune cells will be assessed.  
iii. In peripheral blood, evaluation by [CONTACT_397335], but not be limited to, CD4
+, CD8+, NK, T reg, monocytes and neutr ophils 
as outlined by [CONTACT_397336] ( Tables  1-3). High order flow 
cytometry panels will be designed. The panels will focus on 1) delineation of major immune cell types (T cells, B cells, NK cells, DC), 2) determ ination of T 
cell differentiation status and limited functionality (
IFNγ, TNFα , GB ) and 3) 
defining the expression level of costimulatory and coinhibitory molecules on T cells. The proposed studies will be conducted retrospectively on cryopreserved PBMCs.  
iv. Serum  Cytokine Analyses.  Cytokines (IFN -γ, IL -1α, IL -2, IL -4, IL -5, IL -8, 
IL-10, IL -12p70, IL -13, and TNF -α) will be measured in the serum using the 
Meso Scale Discovery Platform (Rockville, MD). This technology allows for the detection of up to [ADDRESS_500030] the signal in a 96 well plate format. This technology can be utilized for either single agent detection or in multiplex format. A wide menu of validated single or multiplex kits for the detection of 1 to 40 analytes are available from the manufacturer and can be customized.  
d. Mutational profiling  
Proprietary of MD Anderson Cancer Center
  92/[ADDRESS_500031] x250 coverage depth performed in the Molecular Diagnostic 
Laboratory (MDL) at MD Anderson. The lab is CAP accredited and CLIA 
certified to perform high complexity molecular testing for clinical purposes.  
ii. Tumor DNA analysis for KRAS, NRAS and BRAF performed in another CLIA ce rtified molecular diagnostics laboratory do not need to be tested 
again  
iii. TGFβ signaling pathway mutations will also be assessed via this panel which will include , but not limited to, TGFβR2, ACVR2A, SMAD2 and 
SMAD4.  
iv. RNA- seq and WES. This analysis will be performed using fresh frozen 
tissue specimens from CNB at MD Anderson Sequencing Facilities.  
v. Optionally, using plasma specimens, genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_180680] (cfDNA), circulating tumor cells (CTCs), and exosome (exo) -DNA 
may be performed  to mo nitor tumor response and progression.  
5.   Microbiome analyses of buccal and fecal biospecimens 
i. Buccal and fecal specimens may be collected at defined time points for microbiome studies. Buccal swab (buccal smear or cheek swab) will be collected firmly ru bbing the entire inner surface of both cheeks for [ADDRESS_500032] SOPs.  Stools for enteric microbiome analysis will be collected using the OMNIgene kit (DNA Genotek, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada). The collection w ill allow 
obtaining high quality DNA suitable for microbiome profiling and sequencing. 
ii. Analysis: Bacterial identification and classification is achieved by [CONTACT_397337] 16S rRNA gene, which is present in all bacteria but has sufficient sequence level diversity for classification purposes. 16S deep sequencing is cost-effective and technically and computationally robust, and can be 
utilized as a primary assay to initially characterize fecal samples. Briefly, the bacterial 16S rRNA V3 -V4 region from each samp le will be amplified 
and amplicons sequenced using a MiSeq 2x250 bps protocol. An internal pi[INVESTIGATOR_397278]. Operational taxonomic unit (OTU) classification will be achieved by [CONTACT_95559][INVESTIGATOR_397279]. 
Abundances will be recovered by [CONTACT_95559][INVESTIGATOR_397280] -multiplexed reads to the 
UPARSE OTUs and a custom script will construct an OTU table from the output files generated in the previous two steps. This OTU table will be use d 
to calculate diversity, 2- dimensional visualization, and taxonomic 
summaries.

Details of time points and sampling are provided in the Schedules of Assessments ( Tables  1-3).  
All proposed biomarker analyses are exploratory and dependent on the quality and availability of 
sufficient materials. The panel of biomarkers might be adjusted based on results from ongoing research related to anti -PD-1 / PD -L1 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_13265] / or safety, therefore, each subject will also be 
asked whether any remaining tumor tissue and blood- derived samples can be stored at a central 
repository (until such time as these samples cannot support any further analysis) and can be used for future exploratory research on the drug and / or disease- related aspects. A subject’s consent to 
the use of any remaining samples for such future exploratory research shall be optional and shall not affect the subject’s participation in the current trial.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Target -related Biomarkers  
Blood will be collected to analyze PD -L1 targe t occupancy, TGFβ 1, 2, 3 concentrations, and 
circulating cytokine levels according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Tables  1-3).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Immunomonitoring 
As biomarker research is constantly evolving, the selection of markers with the highest specificity 
and relevance to treatment effect may change.  
Leukocyte subpopulations and immune activation status will be assessed by [CONTACT_4133] (fluorescence- activated cell sorter [FACS]) on PBMC from heparinized blood samples (10 mL, 
tubes) dr awn at the time points outlined in the Schedule of Assessments ( Tables  1-3). 
Soluble factors (for example, cytokines profile, soluble PD -1, and soluble PD -L1) will be assessed 
on blood (plasma / serum) samples collected as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments ( Tables  
1-3).  
Plasma will be stored at -80 degrees and sent for immunoprofiling for interleukin (IL) IL -1α, IL-
1β, IL-2, IL-5, IL -6, IL -8, IL-13, TNF -α, MCP, MIP -1β, G-CSF, GM -CSF, IFN -γ via a cytokine 
assay .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Predictive and Prognostic Biomarkers  
It is important to identify biomarkers that help to predict and / or evaluate the efficacy of the therapy, in order to achieve the optimal benefit from targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. No thoroughly validated biomarkers are available to date for anti -PD-1 / PD -L1 and anti -TGFβ therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; therefore, this 
trial plans to evaluate biomarkers from pre -treatment and post -treatment tumor biopsies of primary 
tissue and blood samples that might be predictive of therapy outcome for all indications. Of note, availability of a tumor sample will be a prerequisite for all subjects.  
The following requirements apply to the tissue samples collected during the trial: 
Tissue collection : Endoscopic biopsies, core needle biopsies, excisional biopsies and surgical 
specimens are acceptable. Fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_397281].  
Proprietary of MD Anderson Cancer Center
  94/106 
  Additionally, a mandatory on- treatment  biopsy will be performed in cohort A -C prior to cycle 2, 
day 1 of M7824 administration. A mandatory on- treatment biopsy pri or to cycle 1, day 11 and 
cycle 2, day 1 for cohort B will also be performed.  Resected tissue from metastatic resection will 
serve as the baseline, pretreatment specimen for Cohort D.  
Microbiome sample collection : Collection of stool samples for microbiome analyses can be done 
using OMNIgene -Gut kits. OMNIgene -Gut is an all- in-one system for easy self -collections and 
stabilization of microbial DNA from feces. It allows easily self -collection at home. Sam ples are 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_397282] -of-collection and shipped to the laboratory for 
aliquoting and freezing at - 80C prior DNA extraction. This kit allows the collection of high-quality 
DNA suitable for 16 rRNA microbiome profiling, sequencing and other assays. Buccal swab 
(buccal smear or cheek swab) will be collected firmly rubbing the entire inner surface of both cheeks for 10 sec each cheek side using a sterile polyester swab and storing in Eppendorf tube at -
80°C until DNA extractio n and analyses.  Tissue processing : The cancer tissues should be fixed 
in 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF), paraffin- embedded and routinely processed for 
histological evaluation. Formalin substitutes are not suited as fixative.  
Tissue storage: Fresh tum or tissue obtained from subjects for the evaluation of efficacy should be 
stored in defined cryopreservation medium containing 10% dimethyl sulfoxide [CryoStor® CS10].  
Provision of samples : 1. priority: tumor -containing formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (F FPE) 
tissue block; 2. Priority : if the tumor containing FFPE tissue block cannot be provided in total, 
sections from this block should be provided which are freshly cut, [ADDRESS_500033] Plus glass slides are recommended. Preferably, 
25 slides should be provided; if not possible a minimum of 10 slides is required. Tumor tissues suitable for biomarker analysis are required. Suitable means that the central laboratory can confirm that the tissue is eval uable (enough viable tumor cells are present).  
Sample storage : At the central laboratory the FFPE tissue blocks shall be stored at room 
temperature and the  fresh -frozen  tumor slides shall be frozen in sealed containers at -20°C. 
A panel of putative marker s including molecular, soluble and cellular markers will be analyzed at 
baseline from archived tumor tissue (or fresh tumor biopsy, preferred when available), and from serum / plasma samples/microbiome  to investigate a possible correlation between clinical  efficacy 
and analyzed markers. 
The following assessment will be considered:  
• CMS classification based on FFPE based RNA expression.  
• Level of PD -L1 expression in fresh biopsy by [CONTACT_88304]. Of note, further techniques to 
evaluate the expression of PD -L1 and / or marker candidates impacting the targeting or 
contributing to improve its expression may be also investigated if needed. 
• Level of circulating TGFβ. 
• Frequency and localization of tumor -infiltrated leukocytes (for example, CD3, CD8, CD4 
T-cells, Treg , NK cells, macrophage [M1/2 profile]) by [CONTACT_4658]. 
Proprietary of MD Anderson Cancer Center
  95/106 
  • If quantity of tissue permits, genomic characterization of TGFβ signaling components (for 
example, SMAD4) 
• Further exploratory markers related to the MoA) of the drug such as soluble PD -L1 sera 
level, intratumo ral cytokine profile, and auto-antigen proteomic arrays may be explored. 
• Further cellular and / or molecular markers specific to the cancer may be also investigated according to the indication. 
• Microbiome sequencing analyses of buccal and fecal samples wil l be conducted.

7.5 Description of Statistical Analyses  
7.5.1 General Considerations  
All data recorded during the study will be presented in individual data listings performed on the 
Safety Analysis Set. All  data will be evaluated as observed, and no imputation method for missing 
values will be used. All data will be presented in a descriptive manner. Each cohort will be analyzed separately, and no multiplicity adjustment across cohorts will be performed. 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the trial results, that is, statistics for continuous 
variables may include means, medians, ranges, and appropriate measures of variability. 
Categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_33335]. The uncertainty of estimates 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_397338]. Unless otherwise specified, the calculation of proportions

premature terminations will be summarized by  [CONTACT_397342].   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Exploratory Endpoints  
Summary statistics will be tabulated for microsatellite instability , CMS1, CIMP, KRAS and BRAF 
status. Paired t -test or Wilcoxon signed rank test will be used to assess the changes in biomarkers 
pre- and post -treatment. The differences in biomarker levels between responders and non -
responders will be assessed using X2 or Fis her’s exact test as appropriate. Similar analysis will be 
used to assess the correlation between biomarker mutation statuses .  
Statistical analyses will be conducted by [CONTACT_397343]. Tabulations will be produced for 
appropriate demographic, baseline, efficacy and safety parameters.  For categorical variables, 
summary tabulations of the number and percentage of subjects within each category (with a category for missing data) of the parameter will be presented, as well as two -sided  95% confidence 
intervals, unless otherwise stated. For continuous variables, the number of subjects, mean, median, standard deviation (SD), minimum, and maximum values will be presented.  Time -to-event data 
will be summarized using Kaplan -Meier methodology using 25th, 50th (median), and 75th 
percentiles with associated 2 -sided 95% confidence intervals, as well as percentage of censored 
observations. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Events 
Severity of AEs will be graded using the NCI-CTCAE v4.03 toxicity grading scale. Safety will 
be assessed by [CONTACT_397341]. This data will be separated based on organ class, immune-relation, severity and relation to M7824.  
Adverse events (serious and non- serious)  will be considered treatment emergent adverse events 
when emerging in the on- treatment  period defined as the time from the first  trial  drug  
administration  to  the  last  drug  administration date + [ADDRESS_500040], unless otherwise stated. All 
premature terminations will be summarized by  [CONTACT_397342].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Laboratory Variables  
Laboratory results will be classified by [CONTACT_250002] -CTCAE v4.03. The worst  on-trial 
grades after the first trial treatment will be summarized.  Shifts  in toxicity  grading from  first 
treatment to highest grade  will be displayed. Results  for variables  that are not part of NCI-CTCAE 
will be presented as within or above normal limits. Only subjects with post -Baseline laboratory 
values will be included in these analyses.

  [IP_ADDRESS]  Physical Examination, Including Vital Signs and 12 -Lead 
Electrocardiogram  
Vital signs (body temperature,  respi[INVESTIGATOR_2842], heart  rate, and blood pressure),  eye signs and 
symptoms  based  on System  Organ  Class of “eye disorders”,  and 12-lead EKG recorded according 
to the Schedules of Assessments (refer to Tables  1-3) will be  presented.  
7.6  Interim safety monitoring  
For each cohort, we will implement Bayesian toxicity monitoring69 such that we will all stop 
patient enrollment into a cohort if there is a high probability that the AE rate of M78 24 is greater 
than 20%. For each cohort separately, we will apply the toxicity monitoring rule in cohort size of 
5, starting from the 5th patient. For cohort  A-C, the toxicity stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_397283]: Stop patient enrollment in a cohort if Prob(p>0.20 |data ) > .75, where p denotes the probability of toxicity.  
 
Assuming a beta(.4, 1.6) priori for p, the above decision criterion implies that we will stop cohort 
A or cohort C according to table 8 below.

The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_397285] A -C and  B were generated 
using Shiny application for Bayesian toxicity monitoring ( http://qctrlshiny/postprobtoxicity ). 
AEs of 3 or greater and deemed related to M7824 (section  [IP_ADDRESS].1) will count towards toxic ity 
calculations with respect to interim safety monitoring. AEs of 3 or greater deemed unrelated to 
M7824 are not included towards safety decision making. Th ese include  AEs attributable to disease 
progression (section [IP_ADDRESS].2) and abnormal laboratory or investigational values that are 
asymptomatic or do not result in treatment discontinuation (section [IP_ADDRESS].1). 
The time period that grade [ADDRESS_500041] dose of study drug (section 
[IP_ADDRESS].3).  
Any grade 5 event on- study will require suspension of the study pending review of the safety 
data regarding the death. The Investigator is responsible for completing an efficacy/safety sum mary report, and submitting 
it to the IND Office Medical Affairs and Safety Group, for review and approval.  This should be 
submitted after the first 5 evaluable patients per cohort, complete 1 cycle of study treatment, and 
every 5 evaluable patients per cohort, thereafter. On every report submission, the information 
from previous reported patients will need to be updated.

The goal of VA’s RR&D office is to maximize functional recovery. Considering that goal, our 
proposal allow s us to test an intervention that combines the fundamentals of Physical Medicine 
and Rehabilitation with state -of-the-art nutritional support and innovations in care such as 
telehealth to optimize patients before high -risk surgery. This intervention has the potential not 
only to reduce complications and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5394], but also to maximize functional 
recovery and quality of life for thousands of veterans undergoing high -risk surgery every year. 
Furthermore, the proposal is the first step in the design and implementation of prehabilitative 
services for veterans living in rural areas and those with inadequate support or transportation.  
 
 
2.[ADDRESS_640215] effective prehabilitation programs combine 
exercise with  nutritional support ( are multimodal) .  They  provide exercise that is supervised and 
individualized and  ensur e that exercise intensity is appropriate and escalated according to 
improvements in fitness and strength. Most supervised prehabilitation programs are facility -
based,  with participation limited by  [CONTACT_497822], distance, and transportation10. Unfortunately, 
home -based prehabilitation programs have shown small effect sizes and low compliance rates, 
likely because the intensity required in programs of such short duration is often not achieved 
with such unsupervised programs14-16. 
 
The goal of p rehabilitation is to enhance fitness and physical function in anticipation of a 
forthcoming physiological stress9. One of the main components of prehabilitation is a structured 
exercise protocol that typi[INVESTIGATOR_497811]. By [CONTACT_497823], physical activity stimulates muscle protein synthesis resultin g in 
improved objective markers of physical fitness and improved strength10-13. Nutrition is another 
key component of prehabilitation because it works synergistically with exercise14. It is generally 
accepted that exercise provides the primary  anabolic stimulus and nutrition potentiates the 
muscle protein response15. Indeed, studies using stable isotopes have shown that exercise 
without provision of adequate protein does not result in  optimal gains in muscle accretion16,17. 
After a single session  of resistance exercise in healthy individuals, muscle protein breakdown 
and synthesis are both stimulated16. Net protein balance in the muscle (protein synthesis minus 
breakdown)remains negative after exercise until exogenous amino acids  are administered16. 
Amino acids  stimulate both the synthesis of structural (myofibrillar) muscle protein as well as 
the synthesis of mitochondrial proteins, required for aerobic metabolism and maintenance of 
functional exercise capacity18. 
 
Compliance with prehabilitation  programs is extremely variable, with reported rates that vary 
between 16 and 100%13,[ADDRESS_640216] 
Protocol Number:  TBD       Version Date: 8 June 202 1        DVAHCS Protocol Template —V. 02/15/[ADDRESS_640217] compliance rates, yet barriers such as travel time, distance, and 
transportation limit participation 21,23. Previously, we found that rural veterans lack access to 
exercise programs20,22,23 . Home -based interventions are attractive but are typi[INVESTIGATOR_497812]13,19,21 . If applied to prehabilitation, new telehealth 
technologies could address the shortcomings of home -based approaches because they combine 
accessibility with supervision, encouraging compliance while  ensuring adequate training 
intensity .  However,  this mode of prehabilitation care delivery has not yet been studied in a 
veteran population.  
 
The proposed “tele -supervised” exercise program may allow Veterans living in rural areas  and 
lack transportation  or are otherwise unable to travel to participate in  prehabilitation  in 
preparation for an upcoming high -risk operation. These findings are expected to inform the 
design of a larger multicenter trial on the effects of multimodal prehabilitation on surgical 
outcomes and healthcare resource utilization and to foster the widespread adoption of 
multimodal prehabilitation in preoperative optimization of high -risk patients at the Durham 
VAHCS and other VA Health Care Systems. It represents an important step towards providing 
optimal perioperative care for veterans by [CONTACT_497824], physical function , 
and nutrition before surgery in a manner that is not geographically constrained. These 
improvements will contribute to the reduction in health care costs due to decreased 
complications and fewer readmissions following surgery in high -risk patients.  
 
 
3.[ADDRESS_640218] promising elements of prehabilitation along 
with innovations in telehealth delivery to develop a VA patient -centered multimodal 
prehabilitation program  with  the following specific aims:  
 
• To determine the feasibility, acceptability , and safety of a short -term (3-4 week)  
multimodal prehabilitation intervention followed by a 4 -6 week  period of rehabilitation 
in a cohort of veterans undergoing high -risk surgery . 
• To estimate the  effect size of a multimodal prehabilitation program for important 
postoperative outcomes (improvements in functional capacity and physical function, 
anxiety/d epression, and quality of life).  
 
While aspects of the intervention are novel and the work exploratory, based on available 
evidence, we expect the Cohen’s effect sizes for functional capacity and quality of life to be 
approximately 1.6 and 0.4, respectively.11

tappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a heel or toes, performing chair stands, and moving a leg or arm against a 
resistance band.  It is entirely self -regulated,  and any advancement will be based on self -
reported levels of exertion.  
 
Similarly, the nutrition and vitamin supplementation will be closely monitored by 
[CONTACT_497825] -ins.  Patients with  
advanced kidney disease are excluded from the study  and those with renal impairment 
(KDIGO 3a and 3b) will receive reduced protein supplement in accord with ESPEN and 
[ADDRESS_640220] create a total risk 
that is minimal.  The types of exercise resemble activities of daily living, especially in that they 
are self -regulated, and no patient will, or could be forced to do something they choose not to do.   
 
4.2 Benefit Assessment  
 
The benefit of participation in this study is available to both current enrollees and future 
patients. If a monitored prehabilitation program paired with nutrition support is found 
to be feasible, acceptable , and safe, and in  the future, adequately powered clinical trials 
found to be effective, significant improvement to perioperative care is possible.  
Furthermore, the telehealth component of this program would facilitate delivery of  
prehabilitation to rural populations and those with limited support or access to 
transportation.  
 
 
5.0 Selection of Subjects  
 
Protocol Number:  TBD       Version Date: 8 June 202 1        DVAHCS Protocol Template —V. 02/15/19     Page 8 of 34 5.1 Study Population  
 
The study population includes frail veterans scheduled to undergo high -risk surgical 
procedures. Veterans scheduled for surgery are evaluated in either the Pre -Anesthesia 
Evaluation Clinic (PAEC) or the Preoperative Optimization of Senior Health (POSH) 
Clinic. We plan to screen veterans who are seen in either  clinic and  enroll a total of 24 
patients over 2 years.  
 
5.2 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
 
5.2.1  Inclusion Criteria  
 
• Scheduled for high -risk surgery (colorectal, major urologic, hepatibiliary, 
esophageal, thoracic).  
• Time from assessment to surgery ≥ 21 days  
• Age ≥ 50 years  
• English speaking  
• 5RSTS time ≥ 11 sec and/or TMST score ≤ 25% percentile for gender/ag e 
 
 
5.2.2  Exclusion Criteria  
 
• Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score of <21 (high school  
education ) or 20 ( < high school  education ) or Saint Louis University 
Mental Status ( SLUMS ) score ≤20  
• Dementia diagnosis documented in electronic health record  
• Inability to complete physical function assessment  
• ASA PS categories 4  or 5

cellular telephone or tablet)  
 
 
5.3 Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
 
It is the policy of our institution (Durham VAHCS) not to discriminate against any 
patient because of sex, age, ethnicity, race, sexual  orientation,  or any other attribute. 
Therefore, all patients, including those who are lactating or otherwise of childbearing 
potential (excluding those who are pregnant), who present for surgery at DVHCS  and 
meet inclusion/exclusion criteria  would be eligible for inclusion in this study.  Given that 
the small size of the cohort, and the focus of this study (feasibility, acc eptability, safety , 
and effect size  estimation) , we do not plan to analyze racial, ethnic or gender groups 
separately.

Protocol Number:  TBD       Version Date: 8 June 202 1        DVAHCS Protocol Template —V. 02/15/19     Page 9 of 34 For the purposes of screening, recruiting, and determining eligibility, information will be 
obtained by [CONTACT_497826] —a HIPAA W aiver to  screen and recruit  will be requested . 
Once eligibility is determined, patients will be approached for interest and enrollment during 
their preoperative visit, typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 3-[ADDRESS_640222] 
adequate time to consider the study  and its  benefits and risks, ask questions, and decide if they 
wish to take part. Written informed consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_3462].  
 
 
7.0 Consent Process  
 
7.1 Screening  
 
Patients will be identified in 3 ways:  
(a) Information about this new prehabilitation pi[INVESTIGATOR_497813]. Surgeons will be encouraged to 
alert the PREVENT team to any patients being evaluated in the Surgery clinic 
who may be good prehabilitation candidates (frail , undergoing high -risk 
surgery).  
(b) Additionally, a list of proposed cases is currently available in our 
Perioperative Scheduling Software (DSS) and in the VA’s Corporate Data 
warehouse  (CDW) . This list will be screened periodically to identify potential 
candidates.  
(c) Finally, the list of patients scheduled for evaluat ion in the P AEC  and POSH 
clinics will be reviewed for potential prehabilitation candidates  (review of 
Anesthesiology E -Consult or POSH Consult requests) .  
 
A HIPAA Waiver for screening purposes  will be requested  so that eligible participants 
can be identified prior to  their  PAEC or POSH clinic  appointment , if possible  ~4 weeks 
or more before their proposed operation .   
 
7.2 Eligible Patients  
 
When an eligible patient is identified , the day of the PAEC/POSH appointment will be 
determined.  On the day of the clinic visit, the M oCA or SLUMS score, and physical 
function assessments ( routinely performed by [CONTACT_497827]) will be 
reviewed to establish final eligibility for inclusion in the study , and the research 
coordinator or an investigator will be notified.  A study coordinator or investigator will 
review the ICF with each eligible patient, answering all questions or concerns. After a 
review of the ICF, the patient will sign under the supervision of the study personnel  and 
a full copy provided to the patient  and/or  family  member . Study personnel  may discuss 
the project with their other physicians or family members  as needed . 
 
All study personnel have completed the VA Human Subject s Protections and Good 
Clinical Practices training requiremen t and have experience with the process of 
obtaining and documenting informed consent for research.  Any new study personnel 
who have not had such experience will be trained in several stages, including verbal 
instruction, shadowing consenting visits, VA tra ining modules, and observation by 
[CONTACT_5944].  
 
No study procedures will be performed until after the ICF and HIPAA Authorization 
have been signed and received. Patients  with impaired decision -making capability will

(as described above in Section 7.1, Screening) . A review of the patient’s medical record 
via CPRS  on the day of the PAEC/POSH clinic visit  will verify that they meet 
inclusion/exclusion criteria.   
 
Patients meeting all inclusion criteria by [CONTACT_497828] a baseline 
physical function assessment at the time of their PAEC or POSH in -person visit  using the 
TMST and 5RSTS tests  (as above, part of standard clinic evaluation) . Eligible patients 
who consent to participate will then complete a baseline assessment that includes 
anthropometrics, assessment of handgrip strength (HGS), and the PG-GSA , SF-36 and 
HADS questionnaires.   
 
8.2 Study Procedures  
 
Eligible veterans who consent will enroll in a program of individualized exercise training 
combined with nutritional support during intervening time before and after surgery. 
Study procedures and assessments are outlined in Figure 1 below.

exercise trainer .  They will be asked to download the Annie texting app and aa 
teleconference platform  app on either their personal device or the VA -issued device.  The 
VA issued tablets are then the property of the participant and no VA data will be stored 
on them.  Automated text messaging via de VA Annie App will supplement our patients ’ 
exercise and nutrition al support efforts.  
 
 
 
8.2.[ADDRESS_640225] periods aimed at progressing to 30 -minutes of 
moderate intensity aerobic training. Intensity of effort will be titrated to  rate-of-
perceived -exertion (RPE), with a target of 4 -6 out of a maximum of 10  per 
national guidelines for older adults36,37. Resistance and functional training will be 
included  and focus on strengthening the large muscle groups of the core, upper 
and lower extremities , and on maximizing mobility using body weight or 
resistance bands  when the participant reaches higher levels of RPE (6 -7). 
 
Activities will be constantly monitored and adjusted to increase difficulty but stay 
below the target ceiling of 6-[ADDRESS_640226] of tailored nutritional advice at the time of enrollment, followed 
by [CONTACT_497829]  (1.5 
gm/kg/day for patients with normal kidney function , 1.2 gm/kg per day for 
patients with KDIGO GFR categories G3a and G3b ). Patients with KDIGO GFR 
category G4 or G5 will be excluded (see Appendix 3). These recommendations are 
in accordance with current clinical guidelines for nutrition in the perioperative 
period  39,40.

during prehabilitation and recovery. Preoperatively, a 3-4-week  supply of 
supplements will be provided  at the PAEC or POSH clinic visits (T1). At the time 
of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], participants will be given an additional six -week su pply .  
 
8.2.3  Assessments  and Supplemental Interventions  
 
Objective physical function assessments will be performed at baseline (T1), 
before surgery (T2),  immediately prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] (T3),  and then again 
6 weeks postoperatively (T 4) by [CONTACT_232567] 2MST ,5RSTS and HGS 
tests1 either in -person or remotely using telehealth technology  (see Table 1 for 
details) .  
  
The nutritional support intervention will be assessed at baseline (T1), before 
surgery (T2), immediately prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] (T3) and then again 6 weeks 
postoperatively (T 4) using anthropometrics , a weekly 24-hour dietary 
recall (via telephone or videoconference , see Appendix 6 ), and the 
administration of the PG-GSA , a validated nutritional assessment instrument  
(see Table 1 for details) .  
 
Both the exercise and nutritional support programs will be supplemented with 
text messages  on veterans  who own text message -enabled cellphones .  
Messages will be sent daily using the VA Annie App  during the prehabilitation 
period (T1  - T2). The purpose of these messages is as a reminder about the timing 
of training session s, to prompt independent  exercise on days between formal 
sessions , to take protein supplement following exercise, and to maintain a 
nutritional diar y (see above) .  
 
Text messages and weekly telephone or videoconference call s will resume upon 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_497816] 6 -week follow -up visit (T 4).  
 
Anxiety, depression , and health -related quality of life will be assessed using the 
HADS and SF -36 questionnaires at baseline (T1), before surgery (T2), 
immediately prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] (T3), and 6 and 24 weeks postoperatively 
(T4 and T 5, respectively ). These questionnaires will be administered either in 
person or via telephone or videoconference.

Participants will be withdrawn from the study if any of the following occur:  
 
• Withdrawal of study consent  
• Inability to continue with the exercise or nutritional support program for any reason  
• At the Principal Investigator’s discretion  
 
If a participant is withdrawn, follow -up for the purposes of research is not anticipated. The 
subject will continue to see their  respective  health care providers during scheduled clinic visits.  
 
 
 
13.0  Data Analysis and Statistical Considerations  
 
Feasibility  will be assessed by [CONTACT_497834], measured as the number of 
patients enrolled divided by [CONTACT_3724]. In addition, we will evaluate veterans’ reasons 
for enrollment or non -enrollment in the program using patient interviews and semi -structured 
questionnaire  (see Appendix 4). No PHI will be recorded in questionnaires obtained from 
eligible but non -recruited veterans.  
 
Acceptability will be measured by [CONTACT_497835]/nutrition programs . For 
the exercise intervention, the percentage of patients completing ≥75% of sessions divided by [CONTACT_497836] . For the nutritional intervention, compliance will 
be measured by [CONTACT_497837] ≥75% adherence to protein intake goal, as 
assessed using the text message -based nutrition diary, lids returned, and 24 -hour recall 
administered during the we ekly telephone call.  
 
Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_102529] (significant injury or medical event) 
during exercise. A significant injury or medical event is defined as an event that causes the 
participant to seek attention from a health professional or limits their activities of daily living for 
at least two days.  
 
Effect size  will be estimated by  [CONTACT_497838], as measured by [CONTACT_941] 5RSTS  and the 2 -minute step tests using Cohen’s D. Changes 
in health -related quality of life (SF -36) and anxiety and depression (HADS) before surgery  and 
at the 6-week  and 24 -week study periods following surgery  will be calculated .

moderate intensity  cardio and strength training exercises performed in succession to 
warrant continuous cardiovascular benefit. The number of rounds of aerobic and 
functional exercises will be progressed as fitness improves, with an entire sequence 
being completed in 30 min utes (Table 1). The RPE will be assessed after each round to 
help patients keep intensity within moderate levels. Exercise sessions will also include 5 -
minute warm up and cool down sections at light intensity (RPE 2 -3) to ensure safety 
and recovery of all participants.  
As patients progress, up to 4 -6 rounds of aerobic circuits (Table 2) and 2 -3 rounds of 
functional resistance exercises (Table 3) may be completed.  Given the limited timeline 
of prehabilitation, participants will be encouraged to increase at least one or m ore levels 
where possible at each session. In addition to the supervised exercise sessions, Veterans 
be asked to monitor and increase daily step counts, allowing for one day of rest each 
week.

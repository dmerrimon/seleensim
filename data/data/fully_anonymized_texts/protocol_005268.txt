 1. Overview  
Tau aggregation and deposition in the form of neurofibrillary tangles is a major pathological 
hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology and is thought to represent a final common 
pathway for multiple neurodegenerative disorders, ranging from frontotemporal dementia, to 
Parkinsonism, to certain genetic forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [1-3].  In AD, 
where tau pathology has been best studied, postmortem studies demonstrate a progressive spreading , or staging, of tau pathology, beginning in the transentorhinal cortex, progressing 
through the temporal lobe and into the frontal and parietal lobes, and finally becoming diffuse [2, 4, 5].  It has been recently appreciated that tau deposit ion can be a sig nificant pathological 
feature in some forms of familial ALS, and is especially prominent in cases caused by [CONTACT_859988] C9ORF72  gene.  We have hypothesized that tau deposition may predict greater cognitive 
involvement and faster rates of disease progression.   However, for all diseases with tau 
deposition, including AD and ALS, we have lacked the ability to stage the distribution and 
amount of tau pathology in vivo.  In the last year  however, new PET imaging tracers have been 
developed which are likely to revolutionize the field [ 6-8].   
The optimum scanning and data analysis approaches, however, are still unclear. This project 
will collect quantitative pi[INVESTIGATOR_859979] 
18F-AV-1451 (also known as F 18 T807, also known as 7- (6-fluoropyridin-3- yl)-5H-pyrido[4,3-
b]indole), a novel tau imaging compound, in individuals with and without brain tau fibrils. The primary goal of this study is to develop this highly promising tau imaging technique as an 
antecedent biomarker of  neuronal cell loss, regardless of whether that loss leads to cognitive 
decline (as in AD) or to weakness and fronto- temporal dementia (as in ALS).  That is, we 
propose to obtain preliminary data that will support the possibility of detecting cognitive decline  
or neuronal loss in its earliest stages, before the occurrence of dementia or the onset of 
weakness .  Preliminary data generated from this study will be used for submiss ion of National 
Institutes of Health ( NIH) grants investigating neurodegenerative disorders that include, but are 
not exclusive to, AD, ALS, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Parkinson disease, and HIV-
Associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND).  
Under this study protocol, collaborating neuromuscular physicians  will refer participants for 
MR and PET imaging to evaluate tau distribution in the brain of subjects with ALS, or ALS 
with frontotemporal dementia caused by [CONTACT_859989], or a ny mutation carrier 
(with or without symptoms), or normal controls. 
T807_IND_Protocol -B_ALS_V4.0, 4/30/2018   Page 8 of 28 
 We hypothesize that in vivo tau imaging will ultimately:  
• Demonstrate the presence of tau fibrils in the brain  of subjects with ALS or ALS with 
fronto-temporal dementia , especially in those with mutations in C9ORF72 ,  and may 
discriminate between ALS causes by C9ORF72  and mutations in other genes.  
• Demonstrate that cortical F 18 T807 uptake correlates with markers of ALS disease 
severity, degrees of cognitive impairment, and rates of decline. 
• Demonstrate correlations between F 18 T807 uptake with  CSF markers of tau, including 
tau and p-tau. 
• Co-localize with specific cognitive deficits (i.e. patients with tau deposition in the left 
lateral temporal lobe will have primarily  language deficits).  
2. Objectives  
To begin to explore these hypotheses, we will pursue the following specific aims (SA). 
SA1:  Perform human in vivo  tau imaging using F [ADDRESS_1198640] biomarker imaging and CSF assessments, and clinical and 
psychometric assessments.  
 
SA2: Develop quantitative analysis methods for F 18 T807 PET scans. 
 Exploratory SA3:   Correlate regional quantitative T807 binding potentials (BPs) with 
(a) presence and pr ogression of cognitive impairment and weakness, as documented by 
[CONTACT_859990], with (b) brain atrophy by [CONTACT_234346], (c) 
CSF and amylo id imaging markers of AD pathology, (d) performance on psychometric 
tests, (e) clinical diagnosis, and, if the participant expi[INVESTIGATOR_6054], (f) autopsy findings.   
 
3. Background Information 
C9ORF72 -associated disease: 
A hexanucleotide repeat expansion in an intron of the C9ORF72  gene was recently identified as 
the most common cause of two fatal diseases characterized by [CONTACT_859991] - amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and fronto- temporal dementia ( FTD)[9].  
Early pathological studies in C9ORF72  repeat expansion carriers highlighted the prevalence of 
cytoplasmic TDP -43 and p62 aggregate pathology[ 10, 11].  As the toxic -RNA mechanisms 
have been uncovered, more pathognomonic findings have also been found, including nuclear RNA foci and cytoplasmic aggregates of RANT-generated dipeptides[ 12].  In our early clinic-
T807_IND_Protocol -B_ALS_V4.0, 4/30/2018   Page 9 of 28 
 pathologocial studies of C9ORF72  carriers, we uncovered a subset of patients whose neurons 
demonstrated significant accumulation of intracellular tau fibrils [13].  Subsequent publications 
have confirmed that in some cases, the burden of tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) is sufficient 
to meet criteria for Alzheimer’s disease (AD).  The burden of tau pathology in C9ORF72 
disease has been found to be equivalent to that observed in other forms of frontotemporal 
dementia and high levels of tau and phosphorylated tau have been observed in CSF from 
patients with C9ORF72 expansions[ 14, 15].  These data highlight a potential role for tau 
pathology in C9ORF72 -associated neurodegeneration.  As in other neurodegenerative diseases 
with tau pathology, tau aggregation could exacerbate C9ORF72 -specific mechanisms of 
degeneration [16].  We hypothesize that the degree and distribution of cortical tau pathology in 
C9ORF72  expansion carr iers will correlate with the likelihood of cognitive dysfunction and 
with faster rates of disease progression.  We propose leveraging a novel tau imaging tracer available here at Washington University to obtain pi[INVESTIGATOR_859980] a potential biomarker in C9ORF72  diseases.

18F-AV-1451 (also known as F 18 T807, also known as 7- (6-fluoropyridin-3- yl)-5H-pyrido[4,3-
b]indole) is a novel in vivo  human tau PET imaging agent [ 6, 17].  It was initially developed 
through screening of human AD brain sections, combining autoradiography and immunostaining, and has undergoing initial human studies including toxicology and radiation 
dosimetry.   Preliminary results suggest it can stage tau pathology in a manner similar to Braak 
and Braak staging.

6. Methods 
a. Study Design  
A single-center, open- label baseline controlled imaging study designed to assess whether 
brain tau fibril uptake of  F 18 T807 as measured by [CONTACT_859992].  
b. Participant Population 
Twenty (20) participants over a period of approximately 5 years will be enrolled.  
Participants will undergo an F 18 T807 scan at the Center for Clinical Imaging Research 
(CCIR) at Washington University using an adaption of the protocol developed by [CONTACT_859993]  [6].  An MRI will be conducted.  (For those unable to undergo an MRI, CT will 
be used to generate regions-of-interest.)  Participants will be asked about their medical 
history, family history, surgical history, and current medications.  We will evaluate history 
of traumatic brain injury using the Ohio State University Traumatic Brain Injury 
Identificat ion (OSU TBI -ID) Method.  This will take approximately 10 minutes.  
Additionally, participants will be invited to undergo the following assessments:  
i) PET imaging with fludeoxyglucose (18F- FDG), for measurement of the cerebral 
metabolic rate of glucose cons umption. 
ii) A physical examination  (if one has not been conducted under IRB ID# 201312111). 
c. Recruitment  
Participants will be referred to an imaging research coordinator on the Principal 
Investigator’s study team .  The research coordinator will discuss the study with the 
participant over the phone and conduct a pre- screening assessment.  The research 
coordinator will have access to the health history data collected by [CONTACT_859994]’s most re cent assessment.   The research coordinator will review the 
T807_IND_Protocol -B_ALS_V4.0, 4/30/2018   Page 12 of 28 
 participant’s general health information with the participant to assess any contraindications 
to PET or MR imaging.  If the participant appears to be eligible, they will be given a consent 
form to read, review, and discuss with others who may be able to help them make a decision 
about participating in the study.  Study staff will provide adequate time for the participant to ask questions to ensure that any concerns are addressed prior to study enrol lment.   
d. Imaging Study Procedures  
i) F [ADDRESS_1198642] a catheter placed for 
intravenous (i.v.) administration of F [ADDRESS_1198643] scans  for attenuation correction.   
 
There are two acceptable procedures for obtaining the F 18 T807 PET scans:   
1) In the preferred approach, participants  will receive a single IV bolus injection of 
approximately (240-370 MBq) 6.5-[ADDRESS_1198644] mode and will be binned into 38 dynamic frames (10 frames × 6 s, 6 frames ×  
20 s, 4 frames × 30 s, 5 frames × 60 s, 5 frames × 120 s, 8 frames × 300 s).  After 
the break, the PET data will be acquired in 5 -minute frames and  will be summed 
into one static frame.  This imaging visit will take approximately two hours. 
2) For those who cannot tolerate the full exam, participants  will receive a single IV 
bolus injection of approximately (240-370 MBq) 6.5-[ADDRESS_1198645] quietly in an uptake room 
following the injection.  At approximately 75 minutes following injection, a continuous 30 minute brain scan (6 acquisitions of 5 minute duration) will be 
performed.   This imaging visit will take approximately two hours. 
 
The following safety assessments will be performed at the time of the F 18 T807 PET 
imaging session: 
T807_IND_Protocol -B_ALS_V4.0, 4/30/2018   Page 13 of 28 
 1) A physician , or a licensed/credentialed medical professional (i.e., a PET 
technologist, imaging center nurse, or a regional equivalent) designated by [CONTACT_1268],  must assess or evaluate the participant prior to 
administration of F [ADDRESS_1198646] be available to provide medical attention ; 
2) For women of childbearing potential, a negative urine pregnancy test must be obtained up to 24 hours prior to F 18 T807 dose administration;  
3) Vital signs will be taken prior to F 18 T807 dose administration; 
4) The injection site will be observed for evidence of inflammation or damage to 
the surrounding tissue where the dose was injected;  
5) The participant  will be requested to void after completion of the PET scan; 
6) Adverse events (AEs) will be continuously monitored during the F 18 T807 imaging session; participants  who experience an AE will not be discharged from 
the imaging center until the event has resolved or stabilized; and 
7) A physician , or a licensed/credentialed medical professional (i.e., a PET 
technologist, imaging center nurse, or a regional equivalent) designated by [CONTACT_079],  will evaluate the subject prior to discharge from the 
imaging center to evaluate the subject’s readiness for discharge.   If a designee 
performs this activity, a physician must be available to provide medical attention.  
 
A follow-up phone call to the participant will be conducted within [ADDRESS_1198647] information about any new adverse events.   
ii) MR Imaging 
Participants will be asked  to undergo an MRI scan.  (For those unable to undergo an 
MRI, CT will be used to generate regions- of-interest.)  MR imaging will be formed 
using the established Washington University protocols for dementia imaging.  These include T1- weighted magnetization -prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence 
(1 mm isotropic voxels).  This scan will take approximately one hour. 
iii) 18F-FDG Imaging (Optional) 
Participants will be invited to undergo an  optional 18F-FDG PET scan . 18F-FDG uptake 
and trappi[INVESTIGATOR_859982] 
T807_IND_Protocol -B_ALS_V4.0, 4/30/2018   Page 14 of 28 
 (CMRGlc).  Participants will be asked to fast for [ADDRESS_1198648] no later than 4 days 
prior to 18F-FDG dose administration . Prior to the 18F-FDG PET scan , an antecubital 
intravenous catheter will be placed in the arm for tracer injection and blood sampling for 
glucose levels.  Blood sampling will be done once prior to FDG tracer injection .  
Measurements of CMRGlc will be performed after slow intravenous injection of 5 mCi of 18F-FDG. Dynamic acquisition of PET emission data will continue for 60 minutes 
according to the following scheme: 25 x 5 sec frames, 9 x 20 sec frames,  10 x 60 sec 
frames, 9 x 300 sec frames . All data will be corrected for head motion that occurs during 
the 
18F-FDG scan.  This scan will take approximately one hour.  For those unable to 
tolerate a full 60 -minute dynamic scan, a 30 minute scan may be conducted 30 minutes 
after 18F-FDG administration.  
 
e. Participant Preparation  
Participants will be asked to arrive at the Center for Clinical Imaging Research (CCIR) located 
on the 10th floor of Barnes -Jewish Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_859983]. 
The location allows outpatients and inpatients to undergo research- related imaging protocols 
in a safe imaging environment. The CCIR facility has complete clinical monitoring and  
resuscitation equipment including a fully supplied adult "crash cart” with a defibrillator as 
well as shielded patient uptake rooms with a television and warm blankets for patient comfort.   
A PET-certified registered nurse or CCIR PET technologist will ad minister 
radiopharmaceuticals.   
For women of child- bearing potential, a urine pregnancy test will be conducted in the CCIR 
prior to the imaging procedures.  Women who are pregnant or breast -feeding will not be 
eligible to participate in the study.  
f. Scanner Procedures  
The preferred scanner for F 18 T807 imaging is the PET/MR ; however, in the event that 
there are technical difficulties or scanner availability issues, there will be the option to conduct the scans on any of the following scanners:  
i) On the Siemens model ECAT HRplus 962 PET scanner (stand- alone PET scanner) 
(located in Barnes -Jewish Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], West Pavilion, Neurology and Neurosurgery 
Intensive Care Unit (NNICU) Suite [ZIP_CODE]) for the PET scans:  A NeuroShield 
T807_IND_Protocol -B_ALS_V4.0, 4/30/2018   Page 15 of 28 
 (Scanwell Systems) will be used to reduce random and scattered coincidences 
originating from extracranial radioactivity. A softened thermoplastic mask with enlarged 
eyeholes will be placed over the head and secured. After hardening, the mask will help 
minimize head motion. The participant will be positioned in the scanner such that the 
cantho-meatal line is approximately 1.[ADDRESS_1198649] with eyes closed during the scan.  
ii) On the Siemens Biograph 40 PET/CT scanner (located in the Center for Clinical Imaging Research (CCIR), Barnes -Jewish Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], West Pavilion)  for the PET scans :  
A softened thermoplastic mask with enlarged eyeholes will be placed over the head and secured.  After hardening, the mask will help minimize head motion. The subject w ill be 
positioned in the PET scanner such that the cantho- meatal line is approximately 1.[ADDRESS_1198650] (Computed Tomography) scan will be 
performed for attenuation correction at the low dose CT setting of 37.5 mAs (which is 
25 effective mAs).  For the T807 scanning protocol Option 1 (PET acquisition from 0-
[ADDRESS_1198651] 60 minutes), a second CT may be 
acquired after the break, if a break is taken.  To minimize any possible variations in 
regional blood flow and initial tracer uptake, the subject will be asked to close their eyes.  The subject will rest with eyes closed during the scan.  
For purposes of attenuation correction CT scanning and in accorda nce with FDA 
recommendations released July 2009, participants will be questioned by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_335933]’s 
designee before scanning about implanted medical devices or pumps.   The MRI 
screening form includes the question “Do you wear or have an implantable medical 
device such as a pacemaker or a drug pump?  Yes   No”.  This questionnaire will 
be signed and dated by [CONTACT_859995]’s study records.   In 
addition, the topogram will be checked prior to start of the CT attenuation scan.  If the 
participant has an implanted medical device or medicine pump, the participant will be advised about possible malfunction of such devices that could possibly be related to the 
attenuation CT scan.   It will be emphasized that this is a rare occurrence.   As with any 
T807_IND_Protocol -B_ALS_V4.0, 4/30/[ADDRESS_1198652] will make the final decision whether or not to participate 
after appropriate discussion with family/friends as desired. 
iii) On the Siemens mMR PET/MR scanner (located in the Center for Clinical Imaging Research (CCIR), Barnes -Jewish Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], West Pavilion) for PET scans:  A softened 
thermoplastic mask with enlarged eyeh oles may be placed over the head and secured.  
After hardening, the mask will help minimize head motion. The subject will be 
positioned in the scanner bed such that the cantho- meatal line is approximately 1.[ADDRESS_1198653] scan 
position.  A brief (less than 1 minute) CT scan may also be conducted on the PET/CT 
scanner for attenuation correction. 
iv) On the Siem ens mMR PET/MR scanner (located in the Center for Clinical Imaging 
Research (CCIR), Barnes -Jewish Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], West Pavilion) for the MRI scan:  The MR 
system is a 3.0T whole body MRI system. All basic sequences and many sequences in development are compatibl e with this system. Features include: 60 cm system bore/50 
field of view and an integrated MR gradient coil. Maximum amplitude for all three gradient axes is 45 mT/m and slew rate is 200 T/m/s. Standard PET- compatible Tim® 
(Total imaging matrix) head and b ody phased array coils compatible with the Siemens 
Verio are available for use.  The MRI scan may be conducted simultaneously as the

h. Follow-up 
A follow-up phone call to the participant will be conducted within [ADDRESS_1198655] extensive exploratory 
analyses to generate novel hypotheses for future testing. For example, we will correlate each 
imaging modality (MRI volumetrics, PET amyloid imaging, F 18 T807 PET imaging) from 
each matched FreeSurfer region, and locate the combinations of modalities and regions that 
best correlate with cognitive performance.  
T807_IND_Protocol -B_ALS_V4.0, 4/30/2018   Page 18 of 28 
 7. Informed Consent  
All participants will undergo written informed consent prior to any study procedures. 
Participants are inte rviewed over the phone to determine their eligibility (with a pre-screening 
assessment) and interest in participation. Participants that appear to meet the entrance criteria are given a more detailed explanation of the protocol’s procedures including a des cription of the 
protocol, the risks along with procedures to minimize these risks and the participants’ rights and responsibilities. The participants will be mailed  or given a copy of the informed consent so that 
they can discuss participation with their private physician or family.  If the participant wishes to participate, the informed consent is signed prior to imaging procedures.  Participants are 
specifically told that they may withdraw consent for participation at any time without adversely 
affecting their medical care.   
 
Participants will be reimbursed for their participation in the imaging studies.  Participants will 
be asked to provide their social security number (SSN) in order for us to reimburse them. 
Participants will be advised that they may c hoose to participate without being reimbursed if they 
do not wish to provide their social security number (SSN) for this purpose.  They will also need to provide their address because the reimbursement for their study participation will be mailed 
to them. Once a check is issued, it will take up to eight weeks for the check to arrive at the 
address the subject provided.  If the participant’s social security number is obtained for 
reimbursement purposes only, it will not be retained for research purposes.    
 
8. Procedures for Maintaining Confidentiality  
a. Data Security  
All data obtained from research participation will be identified by a code number. All data 
will be kept in locked file cabinets and only made available to qualified research personnel. 
b. De-identification of Data  
Only code numbers will appear on any data and documents used for evaluation or statistical 
analysis.  No Protected Health Information (PHI) will be shared with others.  Publications 
emanating from this research will not identify individual patients.  HIPAA compliance will 
be enforced as per Washington University policy and HRPO approval.  Studies are done for 
research purposes only.  No services are billed to Medicare or Insurance Companies.  
Reports from patients’ records concerning research observations will not be available to outside medical facilities without the written consent of the subject.  
T807_IND_Protocol -B_ALS_V4.0, 4/30/[ADDRESS_1198656] sharing with the 
research community.  If the participant’s research data is placed in one of these repositories, only qualified researchers who have received prior approval from individuals that monitor 
the use of the data, will be able to look at this information.  This de- identified study data 
will also be shared with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  Information from this research study has been or will be entered into a clinical trial databank that is maintained by 
[CONTACT_7681]/National Library of Medicine.  It will not include 
information that can identify the subject.  
9. Assessment of Risks and Benefits  
a. Risks 
Potential risks are minimal as MRI and PET exclusion criteria and safety procedures will be 
applied. Participants with any metallic objects within their bodies will be screened using 
standard procedures at the Washington University Center for Clinical Imaging Research 
(CCIR) using criteria established and in place at Barnes -Jewish Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  For pre-
menopausal women, a negative urine pregnancy test is required before radiopharmaceutical administration.  Specific risks for each of the study procedures are listed below.  The CCIR 
is a facility which provides both research and clinical imagin g procedures.  The facility 
operates in compliance with the safety guidelines for imaging and for privacy as directed by [CONTACT_243276] 1996 (HIPAA), the Joint 
Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organization (JCAHO), the American College of Radiology (ACR), and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).  PET 
radiopharmaceuticals used in the CCIR are produced in compliance with [LOCATION_002] 
Pharmacopeia (USP) Chapter 823 standards. 
T807_IND_Protocol -B_ALS_V4.0, 4/30/2018   Page 20 of 28 
 i) Intravenous (I.V.) Catheter Placement  
(Likely) Participants may experience pain, bruising, and/or bleeding at the site of 
needle insertion for the intravenous catheter.  
(Rare) There is a rare risk of infection from a needle insertion.  
ii) Radiation  
(Likely) This study will expose the  participant to radiation from the F [ADDRESS_1198657] of the head.  The amount of radiation the participant will 
receive from one F 18 T807 scan, when averaged over the entire human body, is 
about 20% of the amount a person who works with radiation is allowed to have in 
one year. The risk from the radiation exposure in this study is too small to be 
measured. It is not a big risk when compared with other risks one takes every day 
(e.g., driving).  
iii) Scanner Related Risks  
(Less likely) Lying st ill in the scanner may produce some stiffness. Study staff will 
be nearby [CONTACT_859996]. (Rare) People with a fear of being in small, enclosed places 
may find this procedure uncomfortable. During the course of the exam, the technologists will be in communication with the participants and the study will be 
terminated if cla ustrophobia develops.  If the participant undergoes an MR scan, the 
technician will inquire about possible metallic objects inside the participant’s body.  
The MRI scanner produces a loud hammering noise.  A pair of earplugs may be 
placed in the participant’s ears to reduce the risk of hearing loss . Tattoos:  There are 
certain risks associated with undergoing an MRI scan if one has  a skin tattoo.  These 
include risks associated with both cosmetic tattoos (eye -liner, lip-liner) and 
decorative tattoos.   These risks are greater if the tattoo was not applied 
professionally, or if the ink used in the tattoo is iron- based.   Associated risks include 
transient skin irritation, cutaneous swelling, or heating sensation.  In rare instances 
patients with decorative tattoos have had a primary or secondary burn occur at the 
tattoo site.   If the participant has  a tattoo and decides to undergo the research MRI 
scan, we will offer the participant a cold, wet compress (washcloth) to put over the 
tattoo as a precautionary measure.   This decreases but does not eliminate the risk. 
There is a rare risk of m alfunction of worn or implanted electronic medical devices 
with CT scanning.  The participant  will be asked will be asked to advise the study 
investigator and research staff if he/she wears or has electronic medical devices 
T807_IND_Protocol -B_ALS_V4.0, 4/30/[ADDRESS_1198658] scan may cause a malfunction of electronic medical devices.  
 
iv) Risks associated with 18 F-AV-1451  
Less Likely:     Some participants are less likely to experience nausea, 
lightheadedness/dizziness, diarrhea, headache, and altered taste.  
Rarely:  Some participants may experience atrial fibrillation and transient ischemic 
attack. All reported events were mild in intensity and all subjects recovered from 
these events. Sinc e 18F-AV-1451 is a  new compound t hat is being studied in clinical 
trials, you may experience side effects that we do not know about y et.  
 
v) Risks from Additional Study Procedures 
18F- FDG (Optional) 
(Likely) This study will expose the participant to radiation from the18F-FDG PET 
scan and from the CT of the head.  The amount of radiation the participant will 
receive from one 18F-FDG PET scan, when averaged over the entire human body, is 
about 6% of the amount a person who works with radiation is allowed to have in one year. The  risk from the radiation exposure in this study is too small to be measured. 
It is not a big risk when compared with other risks one takes every day (e.g., driving). 
 
vi) Questionnaires 
T807_IND_Protocol -B_ALS_V4.0, 4/30/2018   Page 22 of 28 
 Participants may experience emotional discomfort when answering some questions 
in the questionnaires (i.e. MRI and PET safety screening records; neuropsychometric 
assessment ). If any particular question makes the participant uncomfortable, the 
participant may discuss its importance and the need to answer it with the specially -
trained interviewer. Participants have the right to refuse to answer any question for 
any reason.  If safety screening cannot be completed, then the imaging exams will be 
cancelled.   Participants may experience fatigue or embarrassment from the exercises 
of memory, movement, and attention.  
vii) Other Risks 
Participants may experience all or some of the risks listed above. There may also be unknown risks. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_859984].  For participants who find the scanning session unpleasant, the session will be 
immediately terminated.  
b. Alternative Procedures  
If the participant is unable to undergo PET imaging with  F [ADDRESS_1198659] the protocol in adherence to i nstitutional guidelines 
and in adherence with the Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Department of 
Health and Human Services (DHHS),  and the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) procedures 
and requirements governing the use of investigational new drugs and the monitoring of serious adverse events (21 CFR 312). 
b. Adverse Events  Monitoring and Documentation 
Each participant will be monitored for adverse events (AEs) .  All AEs will be recorded.   The 
severity/intensity of the AE and its relationship to the administration of the study drug, F 18 
T807_IND_Protocol -B_ALS_V4.0, 4/30/[ADDRESS_1198660] to be causally related to F 18 T807 to qualify as an adverse event.  An adverse event can be any unfavorable or unintended sign, symptom or 
disease temporally associated with the injection of F 18 T807, whether or not it is 
considered related to F 18 T807.  Signs and symptoms that are believed to be due to pre-
existing condition (started prior to dose of study medication) will not be reco rded, unless 
there is an increase in frequency or severity.    
For the purposes of this study, untoward medical occurrences will be considered associated 
with the use of F [ADDRESS_1198661] study procedure, including (but not limited to) MR imaging, FDG PET scan, florbetapir F 18 PET scan, and lumbar puncture.    
Intensity/severity of an AE will classified as: (1) Mild: A mild adverse event is an adverse 
event, usually transient in nature and generally not interfering with normal activities; or (2) 
Moderate:  A moderate adverse event is an adverse event that is sufficiently discomforting to 
interfere with normal activities ; or (3) Severe: A severe adverse event is an adverse event 
that incapacitates the subject and prevents normal activities. Note that a severe event is not 
necessarily a serious event. Nor must a serious event necessarily be severe.  
c. Serious Adverse Event (S AE)  
An SAE is an AE that results in one of the following outcomes or constitutes one of the 
following events:  
• Death;  
• Initial or prolonged inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18543];  
• A life-threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying);  
T807_IND_Protocol -B_ALS_V4.0, 4/30/2018   Page 24 of 28 
 • Persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
• Considered significant by [CONTACT_81121].  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_122949], based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
d. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
1.  To Washington University’s Institutional Review Board:  
Within 24 hours of becoming aware of a serious adverse event (SAE), the study team will report the SAE to Washington University’s Institutional Review Board, the Human 
Research Prot ection Office (HRPO). Serious adverse events must be serious, unexpected, 
and reasonably related to the research.  Events which do not meet the requirements for SAE reporting will be reviewed by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_859985]’s chart. 
Serious adverse events occurring after a participant receives a dose of investigational 
product will be collected until [ADDRESS_1198662], 
regardless of the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_25289]. Therefore, SAEs that occur later than 
[ADDRESS_1198663] been caused by a protocol procedure. Previously planned (prior to signing the 
ICF) surgeries
 will not be reported as SAEs unless the underlying medical condition has 
worsened during the course of the study.

e. Data Safety Monitoring (DSM) Reporting 
Safety data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_54421] I nvestigator and the research team as the 
information becomes available. An annual report will be submitted to Washington 
University’s Institutional Review Board ( IRB).  This report will include the protocol title, 
IRB protocol number, the number of participants  enrolled to date, statement of about study 
status, description of problems, description of any significant changes to the study design 
(previously approved by [CONTACT_1201]), and any participant experiences.   All pertinent information 
will be provided in the FDA Annual Report. 
f. Protocol Deviations 
All efforts will be made to follow the protocol as specified above.  In the event a situation 
occurs which requires deviation from this protocol, (i.e., less than expected tracer production, 
problems with the scanner, participants  unable to tolerate imaging) the Principal I nvestigator 
will have final authority over whether or not a study is prematurely completed.  All protocol deviations will be documented and maintained in the participant’s  research chart. Deviations 
such as less than expected tracer production can be accounted for during data analysis and will not necessarily result in cancel lation of the scan. In the event of any deviations from the 
investigational plan that affects the life or physical well- being of a participant  in any 
emergency , the Investigator will notify the IRB. Such notice will be submitted as soon as 
possible, but in no event later than [ADDRESS_1198665] the scientific soundness of the plan or the rights, safety, or welfare of human rights, safety, or welfare of 
human subjects.  In this case , the FDA and IR B will be notified as required per the 
sponsor/investigator responsibilities outlined in 21 CFR 312.  
12. Case Report Forms  
Case Report Forms (CRFs) will be used to document eligibility criteria, demographic 
information, pregnancy test results, administration of radiopharmaceuticals, imaging visit 
sessions, telephone contact 2-[ADDRESS_1198666] with participants.

Study Evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Roxadustat for the
Treatment of Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients not on Dialysis
Sponsor: [COMPANY_008] AB, S-[ADDRESS_754720] 2018
2(93)VERSION HISTORY
Clinical Study Protocol version 6.0 (current version)
Rationale for protocol amendment:
A primary efficacy objective has been added, with specification of accompanying variables 
and analyses, in order to harmonize D5740C00001 with the other phase 3 trials in the 
roxadustat CKD non-dialysis program (FG-4592-060 and 1517-CL-0608). This will allow 
D5740C00001 to serve as a pi[INVESTIGATOR_575004]. Furthermore, additional secondary efficacy objectives, 
with specification of accompanying variables and analyses, have been added and the 
corresponding ordering of secondary endpoints has been updated.
Adjudicated CV events from this study will be part of the pooled analysis across the study 
program.  This strategy was adopted to ensure that the overall number of events is high 
enough to provide adequate power to address CV No harm. Thus, all analyses of CV safety 
will be conducted in accordance with the Pooled SAP (PSAP), and will not be reported in 
the individual CSR. However, all these analyses of adjudicated CV events will be made by 
[CONTACT_575024], as described in the PSAP, adopting meta-
analysis techniques. Hence, all analyses of CV safety for this study will be reported in 
conjunction with the pooled analyses. Consequently, these analyses will not be duplicated 
separately for this individual study.
Summary of changes from Revised Clinical Study Protocol Edition 1.0 (Version 5.0), 
21 December 2015 to version 6.0:
All below changes are updated in relevant sections of the study protocol.

2. Primary eff icacy objective and its two outcome measures, one for US FDA and one 
for EU health authority, are added.  
3. The previous texts on primary objective are moved to the section on primary safety 
objective. New texts stating th at pooled CV safety analyses are now described in the 
PSAP.
Rationale: 
Harmonizes D5740C00001 with the other phase [ADDRESS_754721] 2018
3(93)Synopsis and section 2.2. Secondary objectives
Here are the changes as follows:
1. The secondary objectives are split into the secondary efficacy and secondary safety 
objectives.   
2. The two previous CV-related secondary ob jectives (MACE+ and CSE) are removed  
as all analyses of CV safety will be conducted in accordance with the Pooled SAP 
(PSAP), and will not be done for the individual CSRs.  
3. The previous secondary objective with its outcome measures related to an aemia 
symptoms using FACT-An is removed.
4. The previous secondary objective with its outcome measures related to self-reported 
health status using EQ-5D-5L and PGIC is removed.   
5. “Proportion of total time of Hb ≥10 g/dL from week 28 to week 52”, is added for 
the secondary efficacy objective based on Hb response and level during the study.   
6. The time-frame to evaluate the proportion of total time of Hb measurements within 
the interval of 11±1 g/dL is changed from “from week 28 until end of treatment 
visit” to “from Week 28 to week 52”.
7. The efficacy of roxadustat based on the change from baseline in Hb averaged over 
Week 28-52 in inflamed subjects is added as a secondary efficacy objective.
8. The previous rescue therapy related secondary objective is moved to the secondary 
efficacy objective together with its corresponding composite outcome measures, 
including IV, RBC or ESA as rescue therapy. Also, additional outcome measure, 
including RBC only as rescue therapy, is added to this secondary objective.Proportion and number of subjects receiving rescue therapy (composite or RBC
only) are aslo reported.
9. The previous health-related qu ality of life r elated secondary objective is moved to 
the secondary efficacy objective t ogether with its outcome measure.
10. The previous secondary objective related to CKD progression is moved to the 
secondary efficacy objective. Its outcome measure is the annual r ate of eGFR 
change in log scale, calculated as the linear slope of log (eGFR values) to prior to 
initiation of dialysis/kidney transplant

15(93)Study Objectives
Primary Efficacy Objective: Outcome Measure:
Evaluate the efficacy of roxadustat compared 
to placebo for the treatment of anemia in CKD 
subjects not on dialysis.US FDA: The primary efficacy endpoint for the US is 
the mean change from baseline in Hb averaged over week 28 to week 52. 
EU health authorities: The primary efficacy 
endpoint is whether patients achieved Hb response 
(Yes/No) where Yes is defined as: 
oHb ≥ 11.0 g/dL and Hb increase from baseline by ≥ 
1.0 g/dL, for subjects with baseline Hb > 8.0 g/dL;
or
oHb increase from baseline by ≥ 2.0 g/dL, for 
subjects with baseline Hb ≤ 8.0 g/dL
at two consecutive visits [dates] (with available 
data) separated at least [ADDRESS_754743] 24 weeks of treatment without having received rescue 
therapy (RBC transfusion, ESA, or IV iron) prior to 
Hb response. 
Primary Safety Objective: Outcome Measure:
Contribute CV safety data to pooled safety 
analyses across the phase 3 programAdjudicated CV safety data. Analyses of the 
adjudicated events are described in a separate pooled stati stical analysis plan.
Secondary Efficacy Objectives: Outcome Measure:
The efficacy of roxadustat compared to 
placebo based on Hb response and level 
during the studyProportion of total time of Hb ≥10 g/dL from week 
28 to week 52.
Proportion of total time of Hb within the interval of 
10-12 g/dL from week 28 to week 52

subjectsMean change in Hb from baseline to the subjects 
mean level between week 28 to week 52 in subjects 
with baseline high-sensitivity C-reactive protein 
(hsCRP) greater than the Upper Limit Normal (ULN)
The effect of roxadustat compared to placebo 
on Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterolMean change in LDL cholesterol from baseline to 
week [ADDRESS_754744] 2018
16(93)Secondary Efficacy Objectives: Outcome Measure:
The need for rescue therapy in subjects treated 
with roxadustat compared to placeboTime-to-first (and proportion of subjects receiving)
instance of receiving intravenous (IV) iron, red blood 
cell (RBC) transfusions, or erythropoietin analogue as 
rescue therapy.
Time-to-first (and proportion of subjects receiving)

Secondary Safety Objectives: Outcome Measure:
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of roxadustat.Adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs).
Changes in vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) and 
laboratory values.
Target patient population
Anemic patients (Hb <10 g/dL) with Stage 3, [ADDRESS_754745] of three study periods as follows:
! Screening Period : Up to 6 weeks
! Treatment Period: Patients will be randomized (1:1) to double-blind treatment 
with roxadustat or placebo. A study end date will be declared and common closeout 
will occur when the target number of CV events has been accrued. It is anticipated 
that enrollment will occur over approximately a 3 year period and that an additional 
1 to 2years may be required to accumu late the requisite number of patients with 
positively adjudicated endpoint events. 
! Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period: [ADDRESS_754746], dosage and mode of administration
The initial study drug dose is 70 mg three times a week (TIW). The dose is subsequently 
adjusted to achieve and maintain Hb 11±1 g/dL. Study drug doses must be administered at 
least [ADDRESS_754747] 2018
17(93)Dose adjustments are permitted starting at week 4 and at intervals of every 4 weeks until week 
52, every 8 weeks thereafter, unless a dose reduction is required for excessive eryth ropoiesis 
(see Table 4 ). Study drug will be dosed TIW throughout the study treatment period unless 
downward dose adjustment requires a change to twice or once weekly.
Rescue therapy guidelines are provide d to optimize standardization of the use of rescue 
therapy by [CONTACT_575028].
Statistical methods
Sample Size Determination
Primary efficacy endpoint: A sample size of [ADDRESS_754748] > 99% power to detect a 
0.75 g/dL difference in mean Hb values between the two treatment groups, assuming that the 
common standard deviation is 1.2 g/dL, using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) test with a 
0.05 two-sided significance level.
To contribute adjudicated CV safety events for the pooled CV analyses across the phase 3 
program: approximately 2600 subjects are planned to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either 
roxadustat or placebo. The sample size in this study is driven by [CONTACT_309548] 3 program in  CKD-NDD (which consists of 3 studies in 
total targeting 465 subjects with MACE events). The two other placebo-controlled studies in 
the study program are FGCL-4592-[ADDRESS_754749] 2018

27(93)1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background and rationale for conducting this study
Roxadustat is an orally administered investigational novel drug in development for the 
treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). It is currently in global 
Phase 3 clinical development and has not b een marketed in any country. Roxadustat is a 
potent and reversible active hypoxia-inducible f actor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor (HIF-PHI) 
(Semenza 1998 , Peyssonnaux et al 2008 ) that transiently induces hypoxia- indu cible factor 
(HIF) stabilization and leads to a functional HIF transcriptional response that mimics the 
erythropoietic res ponse associ ated with exposure of humans to intermittent hypoxia. HIF 
induces expression of not only eryt hropoietin, but also the eryth ropoietin receptor and proteins 
that promote iron absorption and recycling ( Peyssonnaux et al 2008 ). Thus, roxadustat 
pharmacologi cally stimu lates eryth ropoiesis via the HIF  pathway and in a manner consistent 
with the body’s normal homeostatic response to hypoxia, but under normoxic conditions. 
Potential advantages of roxadustat compared with eryth ropoietin anal ogues for treatment of 
anemia in patients with CKD include oral administration, greater cardiovascular (CV) safety 
and reduced need for intravenous (IV) iron therapy. The clinical data collected thus far 
suggest that roxadustat is generally safe and well tolerated in healthy adult subjects and in 
dialysis and non-dialysis CKD patients with anemia treated up to 60 weeks. Information from 
the clinical studies conducted with roxadustat can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.
The key objective of the study is to assess the efficacy and CV safety of roxadustat in patients 
with stage 3, 4, or 5 CKD who are anemic and not on dialysis.
1.2 Rationale for study design, doses and control groups
1.2.1 Rationale for control group
Currently available options for the treatment of an emia in patients with CKD and not on 
dialysis (erythropoi etin analogues, IV iron, and red blood cell [RBC] transfusion) have 
significant disadvantages in terms of inconvenience to the patient, cost and adverse effects. 
Although clinical guidelines, e.g. KDIGO [ADDRESS_754763] ill 
controversial ( Breault 2011 ). The proportion of CKD patients with anemia who are treated 
with erythropoietin analogues was found to be about 8% (Veterans and Medicare data, Lawler 
et al 2011 , Collins et al 2009 , respectively). Thus, treatment with eryth ropoietin anal ogues is 
not considered a standard of care by [CONTACT_575030]. Importantly, the use 
of erythropoietin anal ogues has been associated with increased CV risk ( Besarab et al 1998 , 
Drüeke et al 2006 , Singh et al 2006 ) and this is likely to have hampered their broader use. 
Since it is still unclear whether this risk is due to a correction of Hb above  a certain level, rate 
of Hb rise, toxic effects of eryth ropoietin anal ogues per se or a combination of these or other 
factors ( Unger et al 2010 ), it is appropriate to investig ate roxadustat, a compound with an 
entirely different mechanism of action, against placebo. Finally, no clinically justified anemia 
therapy will be withheld in patients on place bo for whom oral iron and, if necessary rescue
therapy (erythropoietin analogue, IV iron, RBC transfusion) will be available. Thus, placebo is 
deemed to be the appropriate comparator in this study.

28(93)1.2.2 Rationale for doses
Starting doses of roxadustat were studied in three ways in the Phase 2 program: mg per kg 
weight-based dosing, tiered weight-based dosing (45 to 60 kg, >60 to 90 kg, >90 to 140 kg) or 
a fixed starting dose regardless of body weight.
Dose adjustments were allowed at regular 4-week intervals to maintain, increase or decrease 
the dose according to pre-specified rules based on absolute Hb levels and change of Hb in the 
previous [ADDRESS_754765] dose adjustment requires a change to twice or 
once weekly. Dose adjustment is allowed at 4-week intervals to achieve and maintain 
Hb 11±1 g/dLIn the event of excessive erythropoiesis, the dose may be adjusted at any time. 
The maximum dose allowed will be the lower of 3.0 mg/kg or 300 mg per dose.
1.2.3 Rationale for hemoglobin level
This study seeks to achieve and maintain Hb 11±1 g/dLThis level is chosen to improve the 
clinical manifestations of anemia, reduce RBC transfusion and improve quality of life, without 
affecting CV risk. Systematic reviews have found that anemia correction in patients with CKD 
improved exercise tolerance, energy and physical functions ( Gandra et al 2010 , Johansen et al 
2010 ). Also, a number of studies and meta analyses have addressed the issue of clinical 
benefit versus potential risk upon anemia correction in CKD ( Phrommintikul et al 2010 , 
Strippoli et al 2004 ). In a recent update, the KDIGO [ADDRESS_754766] that 
erythropoietin an alogues to be started at Hb below 10 g/dL and should generally not be used 
to maintain Hb above 11.5 g/dL ( KDIGO 2012 ). In contrast, the Cleveland Clinic 
recommends target hemoglobin level for both predialysis CKD and end-stage renal disease 
(ESRD) patients should be 11 to 12 g/dL ( Lascano et al 2010 ).
Unlike Hb levels above 13 g/dL where the data indicate CV harm ( Pfeffer et al 2009 ), there is 
a paucity of data on the potential risk of CV adverse events when Hb below 12 g/dL is 
achieved. Further, other factors than the exact Hb level may contribute to the CV risk 
associated with erythropoietin analogue use. These include toxic eff ects of higher doses of 
erythropoietin anal ogues ( Andrews et al 2013 ) and a too rapid increase in hemoglobin upon 
anemia correction ( Singh 2010 ).
Roxadustat acts via a different mechanism of act ion than eryt hropoietin anal ogues and supra-
physiologic erythropoietin concentrations have not been observed in patients tr eated with 
roxadustat ( Yu et al 2013 ). In clinical practice, it is difficult to maintain individual patient Hb 
values within a very narrow range and the proposed range (11±1 g/dL) is in line with 
achievable levels in practice.

29(93)1.3 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment
The primary benefit for patients randomized to rox adustat is expected to be the correction of 
anemia, including the relief of associated signs and symptoms and an improved quality of life. 
Roxadustat is expected to be at least as safe as parenteral eryth ropoietin anal ogues.
Patients treated with placebo may not obtain any benefit in terms of anemia correction, but 
may benefit from the closer follow-up and will receive alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_575007].
An established dose adjustment algorithm will be used during the study to titrate roxadustat 
doses to enable patients to achieve and maintain  Hb levels, while closely monitoring the rate 
of rise of Hb levels. Roxadustat doses may be held and therapeutic phlebotomy is allowed in 
the event of excessive erythropoiesis.
In studies with healthy subjects, headache and dizziness were common events, which occurred 
at a higher frequency with roxadustat compared to placebo. An increased frequency of mild to 
moderate musculoskeletal pain was also noted with high doses of roxadustat. These findings
were not observed at the usual therapeutic dose range in the Phase [ADDRESS_754768] 
pronounced at supra-therapeutic doses (5 mg/kg) . At the high clinical dose of 2.75 mg/kg, the 
increase was modest (about 10 bpm from baseline, placebo corrected). In the Phase [ADDRESS_754769] (DSMB) will perform periodic assessments of 
safety data to detect any potential safety signals  that may arise during the study and advise the 
International Coordinating Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_575008]. Based on data so far 
obtained, treatment with roxadustat is expected to be efficacious in treating anemia in patients 
with CKD. The safety profile of the compound, together with the safety monitoring 
implemented would minimize the risk to study participants. The benefit-risk in this study is 
therefore deemed acceptable.
More detailed information about the efficacy and safety profile of roxadustat is provided in 
the IB.

30(93)1.4.[ADDRESS_754771] of three study periods:
! Screening Period : Up to 6 weeks
! Treatment Period : Patients will be randomized (1:1) to double-blind treatment 
with roxadustat or placebo, started at 70mg TIW and titrated to achieve and 
maintain Hb 11±1 g/dL. Treatment duration is variable for individual patients. A
study end date will be declared and common closeout will occur when the target 
number of CV events has been accrued.
! Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period : 4 weeks. Patients who discontinue study 
medication or protocol-specified study visits  will be followed up for CV events, 
vital status and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_575009] (EOS), unless consent to 
participate is withdrawn.
1.4.2 Randomization
A total of approximately 2600 patients will be randomized at 1:1 ratio to roxadustat or placebo 
via an Interactive Web Response System (IWRS)/ Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS).
1.4.3 Blinding
This is a double blind, placebo-controlled study. The investigator, study site staff and the
patient, are blinded to study treatment, but not to the dose or dosing frequency. The Sponsor 
and designees except the personnel analyzing the pharmacokinetic (PK) samples are blinded 
to study treatment, dose and dosing frequenc y. Sponsor study team members responsible for 
IWRS system are blinded to study treatment a nd can in special cases be unblinded to dose and 
dosing frequency.
Roxadustat tablets and matching placebo tablets will be ident ical in appearance, packaging 
and labelling in order to maintain the blind. Treatment assignments will be unblinded after 
database lock.
Any intentional or unintentional breaking of the blind should be reported and documented. 
Breaking the blind (for a single patient) should be considered only when knowledge of the 
treatment assignment is deemed essential by [CONTACT_95848]’s care. Unplanned 
unblinding will result in the discontinuation of  patient participation from the study treatment 
but follow up for CV events will continue until the study closes.
1.4.4 Visits
During the screening period, eligibility will be confirmed at a minimum of 2 screening visits. 
During the treatment period, patients will be contact[CONTACT_575025] 1, and will attend 
study visits every two weeks from weeks 0 to 20. After week 20, study visits will occur every 
four weeks until week 52, then every 8 weeks until the end of the treatment period. A study
end date will be defined based on when the planned number of events are estimated to be 
accrued, and the end of treatment (EOT) visit will occur as soon as possible after that date. An

Study Code  D5740C00001
Version 6.[ADDRESS_754784] 2018
37(93)3.3 Patient enrollment and randomization
Investigator(s) should keep a record, the patient screening log, of patients who entered pre-
study screening.
The Investigator(s) will:
! Obtain signed informed consent from the potential patient before any study specific 
procedures are performed
! Assign potential patient a unique enrollment number, beginning with ‘E#’ through 
the IWRS/IVRS
! Determine patient eligibility, see Section 3.1and 3.2
! Assign eligible patients unique randomization code through the IWRS/IVRS
If a patient withdraws from participation in the study, his/her enrollment/randomization code 
cannot be reused.
Randomization codes will be assigned strictly sequentially as patients become eligible for 
randomization. Random ization of qualified patients within the IVRS/IWRS system must take 
place, prior to administration of study drug. Randomization procedures must be completed 
within [ADDRESS_754785] ensure all decisions are appropriately
documented.
3.5 Methods for assigning treatment groups
Randomization schedules will be prospectively prepared. Automated randomization and treatment assignments will be provided by [CONTACT_166858] /IVRS. The randomization codes will be 
computer generated by [CONTACT_38227] R&D using GRand (AZ Global Rando mization system) 
and loaded into the IVRS/IWRS database. A block randomization sche dule by [CONTACT_575032].

38(93)3.6 Methods for ensuring blinding
The investigator, study site staff, and the patient ar e blinded to study treatment, but not to the 
dose or dosing frequency. The Sponsor and designees except the personnel analyzing the 
pharmacokinetic (PK) samples are blinded to study treatment, dose and dosing frequency. 
Sponsor study team members res ponsible for IWRS system are blinded to study treatment and 
can in special cases be unblinded to dose and dosing frequency. The patient will also be 
blinded to study Hb values. Neither the patients nor the investigators and their staff can 
distinguish the roxadustat tablets from the matching placebo tablets. Both will be identical in 
appearance, packaging and labeling in order to maintain the blind.
3.7 Methods for unblinding 
Individual treatment codes, indicating th e treatment randomization for each randomized 
patient, will be available to the Investigators or pharmacists from the IWRS/ IVRS. Routines 
for this will be described in the IWRS/ IVRS user manual that will be provided to each center.
The treatment code should not be broken except in medical emergencies when the appropriate 
management of the patient requires knowledge of the treatment randomization. The 
Investigator documents and reports the action to [COMPANY_008], without revealing the treatment 
assignment to the [COMPANY_008] staff.
3.8 Restrictions
The following restrictions apply in the study:
Female patients of childbearing potential and male patients (non-surgically sterile i.e., 
vasectomy) with a female partner of childbearing potential must, if not practicing complete 
sexual abstinence, agree to practice a dual method of contraception, for example, a 
combination of the following: (1) oral contracep tive, depo progesterone or intrauterine device; 
and (2) a barrier method (condom or diaphragm).
Contraceptive methods must be practiced upon being randomized to the study and through 
[ADDRESS_754787] be 
reported (see Section 6.6).
For high dose statins use, see Section [IP_ADDRESS] .

1. Patient decision: The patient is at any time free to discontinue treatment, without 
prejudice to further treatment
2. Investigator’s decision, including but not limited to these examples:
! Incorrectly randomized patient in whom the inclusion/exclusion criteria 
violation would put the patient at undue risk
! Adverse Event (AE) for which the investigator thinks continued treatment 
may put the patient at undue risk
! Severe non-compliance to study protocol
! Pregnancy
! Patients who have received two cours es of erythropoietin  analogue rescue 
therapy, and for whom there is a need for a third course of rescue with erythropoiet in analogue
! For patients initiating dialysis during the study; and for whom there is a need 
for rescue with erythropoietin analogue
Each permanent discontinuation from study medication should be comm unicated to the study 
team. For decisions around permanent discontinu ation the [COMPANY_008] study physician s hould 
be consulted. Study assessments or follow-up should be continued in all cases if possible (see 
Section 4).
3.9.[ADDRESS_754791]
Patients permanently discontinuing study medication should be given conventional therapy, if 
applicable and should always be asked to continue the regular study visits as described below.
A patient who decides to discontinue study medication will always be asked about the 
reason(s) to discontinue study medication and the presence of AEs (if any). These data will be 
ascertained and documented by [CONTACT_575033] e CRF as appropriate. AEs 
will be followed up (see Sections 4and 6.4) and the patient should return all study 
medications.
Each patient who permanently discontinued study medication prior to closure of the study, 
should be followed up for vital status and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_575011] (see Section 
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Roxadustat
Study Code D5740C00001Version 6.[ADDRESS_754792] 2018
40(93)[IP_ADDRESS]), unless he/she decides to withdraw consent for the study completely (see Section 
[IP_ADDRESS]).
Discontinuation from study medication is not the same as complete withdrawal from the 
study (withdrawal of consent), which has a direct impact on the potential validity of all 
study data and should be avoided wherever possible. It is essential to collect as much 
data as possible for all patients throughout the study and especially all potential 
endpoint events .
There are several different options (methods of follow-up) for the continuation in the study as 
described below.
[IP_ADDRESS] Patient agrees to undergo the Premature Treatment Discontinuation Visit and 
then continue in-person study visits
The patient agrees to undergo the Premature Treatment Discontinuation Visit (PTDV) and 
then continue in-person study visits according to plan. This is the preferred option and 
patients who discontinue study medication will alwa ys be asked if they agree to this approach. 
If agreed, as above, the patient will undergo their PTDV within 15 days after the study
medication is stopped. The PTDV includes the same assessments as the EOT visit. The patient 
will continue attending subsequent study visits according to schedule (see Table 1 ) until end 
of study is declared (i.e., when the prespecified number of primary events has been reached).
At PTDV, the physicians caring for the patient will decide upon treatment the patient should 
receive as part of his/her ongoing clinical care. Patients who have permanently discontinued 
study drug may r eceive prohibited concomitant medications such as eryth ropoietin anal ogues.
[IP_ADDRESS] Patient refuses to continue in-person study visits but agrees to undergo 
modified follow-up
If the patient agrees, the PTDV should be done. In all subjects permanently discontinuing 
study drug, all adverse events and potential endpoints should be captured during the 28 days 
following study drug discontinuation. Beyond 28 days following study drug discontinuation, 
for subjects who refuse to continue in-person study visits but agree to modified follow-up, all 
SAEs should be captured as well as any inf ormation (for example,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_309525]) 
relevant to the following adjudicated events:
! Death
! Non-fatal MI
! Non-fatal stroke
! Heart failure requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]
! Unstable angina leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]
! Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
! Pulmonary embolism (PE)

Version 6.[ADDRESS_754793] 2018
41(93)! Vascular access thrombosis (VAT)
! Hypertensive emergency
Additionally, information about anemia treatment following study drug discontinuation (for 
example, erythropoietin anal ogue use) should be documented in the eCRF. 
Examples of modified follow-up include in-per son study visits occurring at a different 
frequency and/or with fewer study procedures (for example, without laboratory assessments) 
than that listed in Table 1; periodic telephone contact [CONTACT_1155], subject’s spouse, or the 
subject’s treating physician; and periodic medical record review. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Patient refuses any form of follow-up
If the patient refuses any form of follow-up, he/she officially withdraws from the study and 
withdraws consent. This approach should be avoided if possible and is further described in 
Section 3.10. All available follow-up options (including modified follow-up as described in 
section [IP_ADDRESS]) should be discussed with the patient, and the patient’s refusal of all follow-up 
options should be documented. Patients who agree to any form of follow-up or contact [CONTACT_309554] (for example, one phone call during the study closeout period), have not withdrawn 
consent. At the end of the study, vital status on all withdrawal of consentpatients will be 
collected from publicly available sources, in accordance with local regulations.
[IP_ADDRESS] Restart of study medication
Whenever possible, restar t of randomized st udy medication s hould be encouraged. 
If patient has been treated with erythropoietin analogues as rescue therapy, see Section 7.7.4
for guidance on when study drug can be restarted.
[IP_ADDRESS] End of study procedures
If a patient is unable to attend the EOS visit in person, telephone contact [CONTACT_309555], 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], SA Es and vital status should be made to ascertain endpoint and AE 
information.
3.[ADDRESS_754794] and/or withdraw consent 
for participation in the study, without pre judice to further treatment. Whether or not 
withdrawal of consent from the study has occ urred must be ascer tained in subjects for whom 
investigational product is permanently discontin ued, and this must be documented by [CONTACT_575034] (ICF). The withdrawal addendum to  ICF should be signed and dated by [CONTACT_575035], if possible. Such patients will always be asked about the reason(s) 
and the presence of any AEs. The reason for permanent discontinuation of treatment with the 
study medication and the date of the last intake of the study medication must be documented 
in the eCRF.

42(93)To ensure validity of study data, it is ve ry important to collect as much data as possible 
throughout the study and especially vital status (dead or alive) at the EOS visit. The 
investigator or delegate will therefore attempt to collect information on all patients’ vital 
status from publicly available sources at the EOS visit, in accordance with local regulations, 
even if informed consent has been withdrawn completely.

patients).
3.10.2 Withdrawal of the informed consent
Patients are free to withdraw from the study at any time (investigational product and 
assessments), without prejudice to further treatment.
A patient who withdraws consent will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of 
any AEs the Investigator will follow up AEs outside of the clinical study.
If a patient withdraws from participation in the study, then his/her enrollment/randomization 
code cannot be reused. Withdrawn patients will not be replaced. Patients who agree to 
continued study participation following investigational product discontinuation, including modified follow-up such as telephone calls or medical record review, have not 
withdrawn consent.

If terminating the study, the Sponsor will ensure that adequate consideration is given to the 
protection of the patients’ interests. The indepe ndent DSMB will monitor the study to ensure 
patient safety.

46(93)4.1 Enrollment/screening period
During the screening period consenting patients are assessed to ensure that they meet 
eligibility criteria. Patients who do not meet these criteria must not be randomized in the 
study. Patients must provide written informed consent before any screening tests or 
assessments are performed.
4.1.[ADDRESS_754803] a mean (calculated by [CONTACT_3786]) of two most recent central laborat ory Hb values during the screening period, 
obtained at least 7 days apart, that is <10.0 g/dL.
4.1.2 Additional screening assessments
If a patient’s laboratory results or blood pressure (BP) do not meet the eligibility criteria, the 
laboratory assessment or BP may be repeated within the screening period. The visits must be 
at least [ADDRESS_754804] 7 days apart, 
will be used to calculate the patient’s e ligibility. Iron, vitamin B12 and folate laboratory tests
may be repeated during the screening period after supplementation if necessary. Similarly BP
may be repeated after adjustment of antihypertensive medications. Liver function test (LFT) 
parameters may not be repeated if found exclu sionary at screening without a prior approval 
from the [COMPANY_008] study physician. 
A screen-fail patient may be re-screened if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_093]. Where 
possible, an approval should be obtained from the [COMPANY_008] study physician prior to re-
screening. Two re-screening periods are allowed.
For all screen failures, the reason(s) will be documented.

Day [ADDRESS_754806] study drug administration.
During the treatment period, patients will be contact[CONTACT_575036] 1 to assure that study 
drug is being taken correctly. The patients will attend study visits every 2 weeks from week 0
to 20, every 4 weeks thereafter until week 52, and every 8 weeks from week 52 until study
closure is declared. The patient’s next scheduled visit will then be the EOT visit marking the 
end of the treatment period. At the EOT visit, the physicians caring for the patient will decide 
upon treatment the patient should receive as part of his/her ongoing clinical care.
The study is event-driven and will be closed when the target number of CV events has been 
accrued. 
In case of premature discontinuation of study medication, see Section 3.9.
4.3 Follow-up period
After the treatment period (ending with the EO T visit), study patients will proceed to the 
4-week post-treatment follow-up period (ending with the EOS visit).
Procedures will be performed according to the Study Plan, Table [ADDRESS_754807] Web Based Data Capture (WBDC) system will be used for data collection and 
query handling. The investigator will ensure that data are recorded in the electronic Case 
Report Forms (eCRF) as specified in the study protocol and in accordance with the 
instructions provided.
The investigator ensures the accuracy, completeness and timeliness of the data recorded and of 
the provision of answers to data queries according to the Clinical Study Agreement. The 
investigator will sign the completed eCRFs. A copy of the completed eCRF will be archived at 
the study center.
5.1 Efficacy assessments
5.1.1 Efficacy assessments
[IP_ADDRESS] Hemoglobin level
Assessment of the efficacy of study tr eatments will be based on Hb assessed by [CONTACT_21921]. Dose adjustments will be based on Hb assessed by [CONTACT_575037], not by [CONTACT_171254].
For timings of the Hb assessments, see Table [ADDRESS_754808] 2018
48(93)[IP_ADDRESS] Use of rescue therapy
Use of rescue therapy (erythropoietin anal ogue, IV iron and RBC transfusion) will be 
identified using standard questioning of the patient at each visit or by [CONTACT_575038]. The use will be recorded in the 
appropriate section of the eCRF. For f urther information see Section 7.7.4 .
5.2 Safety assessments
Safety will be assessed throughout the study. A complete baseline profile of each pati ent will 
be established through demographics, medical history, clinical laboratory values, vital signs, 
physical assessments and electrocardiograms (ECGs). During the course of the study, vital 
signs, complete and targeted physical assessments, laboratory tests and ECGs will be 
performed at regular intervals. Adverse events , serious adverse events (SAEs) and ongoing 
concomitant medication usage will be monitored and recorded throughout the study. SAE 
reports will be evaluated individually to assess fo r the impact of the event, if any, on the 
overall safety of the product and on the study itself. Cumulative AEs will be monitored 
throughout the study. SAEs and AEs will be followed until resolved, stable or until the 
patient’s EOS visit. See Section 6for details on AE and SAE reporting.
Safety will be assessed t hrough:
! Adverse events
! Laboratory parameters
! Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, ECG)
! Adjudicated cardiovascular, cerebrovasc ular and thrombotic/thromboembo lic 
events
5.2.1 Cardiovascular events
MACE+ events (death, non-fatal M I, non-fatal stroke, heart failure requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_575012]) should be reported as SAEs in the eCRF. Deep 
vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, vascular access thrombosis and hypertensive 
emergencies will also be reported and adjudicated.
SAEs will be screened against a pre-specified list of MedDRA preferred terms to identify 
potential MACE+ events plus the rest of the CV  events listed above. When a potential CV 
event is identified, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_575013]; once the clinical endpoint packet is compi[INVESTIGATOR_42602], blinded adjudication of candidate CV 
events will be conducted by [CONTACT_575039] (IERC) as 
described in the IERC charter.

Additional laboratory assessments performed for purposes other than general safety evaluation 
are also listed in Table 2 .
5.2.3 Physical examination
Acomprehensive physical examination will be c onducted according to Study Plan, Table 1 . 
This examination will include general appearance and the following body regions and 
systems: General appearance, skin, head and neck, lymph nodes, thyroid, 
musculoskeletal/extremities, cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], abdomen, neurological and any 
other, if deemed necessary.
Height is measured only at screening. Weight is measured at screening, at randomization and 
then at specific time points as described in the Study Plan, Table 1 .
A targeted physical examination (general appearance, cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_575014]) will be conducted throughout the study as described in Study Plan, Table 1 . Any

5.2.5 Vital signs
The vital signs, blood pressure and heart rate, will be assessed at the visits as described in the 
Study Plan, Table 1 and recorded in the eCRF.
[IP_ADDRESS] Heart rate and Blood pressure
At most visits, HR and BP will be measured according to usual clinical practice. On specific 
visits indicated in Table [ADDRESS_754813] 5 min. The position of the patient 
should be comfortable with the arm where the bl ood pressure is recorded to be within the level 
of heart (the middle of the cuff on the upper arm is at the level of the right atrium (the 
midpoint of the sternum). The patient will be instructed to relax as much as possible and to not 
talk during the measurement procedure. Preferably measurement will be done with an 
electronic automated os cillometric device. The same device should preferably be used for the 
patient during the course of the study and in the same arm. BP will be measured in triplicate 
with at least one-minute intervals between measurements. All the three readings will be 
reported in the eCRF.
The HR will be assessed by [CONTACT_575041] 30 seconds immediately after 
each recording of the BP. It could be also performed with an oscillometric device if this is 
used for BP measurement. The triplicate HR assessments will be recorded in the eCRF.
5.3 Other assessments
5.3.1 Patient reported outcomes
All study patients will be asked to complete the Health Related Quality of life (HRQoL) 
questionnaires at time points indicated in the Study Plan, Table 1 .
[IP_ADDRESS] Short Form 36 – (SF-36)
The SF-[ADDRESS_754814] is a general HRQoL instrument designed to assess generic 
health concepts r elevant across age, disease and treatment groups. It is aimed at both adults 
and adolescents aged eighteen years and older. The SF-36 consists of eight domains of health 
status: Physical functioning (PF) - 10 items;  Role-physical - RP - 4 items; Bodily pain -
2 items; General health (GH) - 5 items; Vi tality (VT) - 4 items; Social functioning (SF) -
2 items; Role emotional (RE) - 3 items; and Men tal health (MH) - 5 items. Two component 
scores, the Physical Component Summary (PCS)  and the Mental Component Summary (MCS) 
can also be calculated. For both the SF-[ADDRESS_754815] version has a recall period of the ‘past four 
weeks’.

52(93)[IP_ADDRESS] Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Anemia (FACT-An)
The FACT-General (FACT-G) version 4 contains 27 items that cover four dimensions of 
disease-specific HRQoL: Physical well-being (PWB) - 7 items; Functional well-being (FWB) 
- 7 items; Social/family well-being (SWB) - 7 items; Emotional well-being (EWB) - 6 items. 
A subscale of 13 fatigue specific items (the Fatigue Subscale) plus seven additional items 
related to anemia were developed for use in conjunction with the FACT-G. The 13 fatigue 
items plus the seven additional items related to anemia comprise the Anemia Subscale 
(Additional Concerns). Administration of the FACT-G plus the Anemia Subscale is referred to 
as the FACT-An. The FACT-An has a recall period of the ‘past seven days’. Respondents are 
asked to provide responses (i.e. ‘Not at all’, ‘A little bit’, ‘Somewhat’, ‘Quite a bit’ and ‘Very 
much’), to a list of statements which are either positively or negatively phrased. For all FACT-
An scales, a higher score indicates better HRQoL.
[IP_ADDRESS] Patients’ Global Impression of Change (PGIC)
The PGIC is an instrument where patients rate change in their overall health status compared 
to the start of the study treatment. Ratings  are done on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (very
much improved) to 7 (very much worse).
[IP_ADDRESS] EuroQol Health Utility Index - (EQ-5D-5L)
The EQ-5D-5L is a self-reported questionnaire measuring utility values. The EQ-5D consists 
of the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (VAS). The EQ-5D 
descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions of health: Mobility; Self-care; Usual activities; 
Pain/discomfort; and Anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight 
problems, moderate problems, seve re problems and extreme problems. The VAS records the 
respondent's self-rated health status on a gradu ated (0-100) scale, where the endpoints are 
labeled ‘Best imaginable health state’ and ‘Worst imaginable health state’ with higher scores 
for higher HRQoL. EQ-5D health states, defined by [CONTACT_20367]-5D descriptive system, may be 
converted into a single summary index by [CONTACT_2931] a formula that essentially attaches values 
(also called weights) to each of the levels in each dimension. The index can range from 1 for 
full health to 0 for being dead, but it can also be  below 0 indicating a health state worse than 
being dead.
[IP_ADDRESS] Administration of patient-reported outcome
All patient-reported outcomes (PRO)s are paper-based and will be administered at baseline 
and according to Study Plan, Table [ADDRESS_754817] allocate the responsibility for the administration of the questionnaire to a 
specific individual (e.g., a research nurse, study coordinator) and if possible assign a back-up 
person to cover if that individual is absent . The [COMPANY_008] study team (or delegate) will 
provide relevant training in administration of the questionnaires. The significance and 
relevance of the data need to be explained carefully to participating patients so that they are 
motivated to comply with data collection.

! They must be completed prior to any oth er study procedures (following informed 
consent) and before discussion of disease progress to avoid biasing the patient’s responses to the questions. They must be completed in private by [CONTACT_102]
! The patient should be given sufficient time to complete at their own speed
! The patient should not receive help from relatives, friends or clinic staff to answer 
the questionnaires
! On completion, the questionnaires should be handed back to the person responsible 
for questionnaires who should check for completeness
! Only one answer should be recorded for each question
5.3.2 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_575015] (including emergency room/sk illed nursing facility use) will be 
collected at each study visit. Reason, admission, discharge dates, type and reason for

at follow-up visits in patients who prematurely discontinued treatment (only if they have taken 
at least one dose of study drug), until EOS.
5.4 Pharmacokinetics
5.4.1 Collection of samples
Venous blood samples (4 mL) for determination of roxadustat concentration in plasma will be 
collected at week 4 and week 8. Patients will be instructed NOT to take the study medication 
on the day of week 4 visit (not necessary for week 8). If a dose of the study medication is 
scheduled for that day, the dose can be given AFTER the collection of the blood sample. For 
both visits the date and time of sample co llection w ill be recorded as well date and time of the 
study last dosing of study medication.
Samples will be collected into appropriately labelled tubes containing sodium-heparin as 
anticoagulant. Immediately after collection, blood samples will be kept on melting ice until 
ready for centrifugation, which must be done within 30 minutes of  collection. Blood samples 
will be centrifuged at 1500 g for 10 minutes at room temperature in order to obtain plasma. 
Plasma will be harvested and transferred into an appropriately labelled amber polypropylene 
storage tube and stored at -20°C or below, within [ADDRESS_754820] 2018
54(93)5.4.2 Determination of study drug concentration
For the patients receiving roxadustat, samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) determination will be 
analyzed by [CONTACT_575042], [COMPANY_008] R&D, using 
validated bioanalytical methods. Full details of the analytical methods used will be described 
in a separate bioanalytical report.
The plasma concentration data will be listed and summarized on the basis of time intervals 
and plotted in scattering with time relative to the immediately preceding roxadustat dosing 
time. A population PK analysis of data collected in the CKD- non-dialysis dependent (CKD-
NDD) program will be performed using the non-linear mixed-effects modelling technique as 
outlined in a population PK analysis plan.
5.4.3 Storage and destruction of pharmacokinetic samples
PK samples will be disposed of after the Bioanalytical Report finalization or six months after 
issuance of the draft Bioanalytical Report (whichever is earlier), unless requested for future 
analyses.
Incurred sample reproducibility analysis, if any, will be performed alongside the bioanalysis 
of the test samples. The results from the evaluation will not be reported in the Clinical Study
Report but separately in a Bioanalytical Report.

Pharmacogenetic samples  
 will be collected at baseline, i.e., at randomization visit (week 0).
5.6.1 Collection of pharmacogenetic samples
The patient´s consent to participate in the pharmacogenetic research components of the study
is mandatory.  Patients may participate in the study without participating in genetic sampling.
The blood sample for genetic research will be obtained from the patients at randomization 
visit (week 0). Although genotype is a stable parameter, early sample collection is preferred 
to avoid introducing bias through excluding patien ts who may withdraw due to an adverse 
event (AE), such patients would be important to include in any genetic analysis. If for any CCI

labelling, shipment and containment provisions are approved.
5.7.3 Chain of custody of biological samples
A full chain of custody is maintained for all samples throughout their lifecycle. The Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_575018] (where appropriate) and 
keeps documentation of receipt of arrival.
The sample receiver keeps full traceability of the samples while in storage and during use until 
used or disposed of or until further shipment and keeps documentation of receipt of arrival.
[COMPANY_008] keeps oversight of the entire life cycle through internal procedures, monitoring of 
study sites and auditing of external laboratory providers.
Samples retained for future use are registered within the relevant sample tracking system at 
[COMPANY_008].
5.7.4 Withdrawal of Informed Consent for donated biological samples 
If a patient withdraws consent to the use of donated  biological samples, the samples will be 
disposed of/destroyed, and the action documented. However, this does not result in 
withdrawal of the patient from the study and pa tient should continue until the end of study. If 
samples are already analyzed ,[COMPANY_008] is not obliged to destroy the results of this 
research.

6. SAFETY REPORTING AND MEDICAL MANAGEMENT
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_575019].
6.[ADDRESS_754826]. An undesirable medical condition 
can be symptoms (e.g., nausea, chest pain), signs (e.g., tachycardia, enlarged liver) or the 
abnormal results of an investigation (e.g., laboratory findings, electrocardiogram). In clinical 
studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including
run-in or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered.
The term AE is used to include both serious and non-serious AEs.
An AE (classified by [CONTACT_11702]) that occurs during the double-blind treatment period will 
be considered a TEAE (Treatment Emergent Adverse Event) if it was not present prior to the 
first dose of study drug, or it was present prior to the first dose of study drug but increased in 
severity during the double-blind treatment period. An AE that occurs more than [ADDRESS_754827] 2018
58(93)6.2 Definitions of serious adverse event
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study phase (i.e., screening, treatment 
and follow-up), that fulfils one or more of the following criteria:
! Results in death
! Is immediately life-threatening
! Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
! Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of 
the ability to conduct normal life functions
! Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect
! Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the patient or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above
For further guidance on the definition of a SAE, see Appendix B to the Clinical Study
Protocol.
6.3 Recording of adverse events
6.3.1 Time period for collection of adverse events
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be co llected from the time of si gnature of informed 
consent throughout the treatment period and including the follow-up period.
Adverse Events (AEs) will be collected fro m randomization throughout the treatment period 
and including the follow-up period. See Section [IP_ADDRESS] for details regarding AE collection for 
subjects who are followed by [CONTACT_575043]- up after premature discontinuation of IP. 
6.3.[ADDRESS_754828] additional information for any patient with ongoing 
AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary.
6.3.3 Variables
The following variables will be collected for each AE:
! AE (verbatim)
! The date when the AE started and stopped
! Intensity or changes in intensity

Version 6.[ADDRESS_754829] 2018
59(93)! The investigator should use the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 . For terms not 
specified as part of NCI- CTCAE, the following guidelines should be used to 
determine grade:
!Grade 1, Mild: Asymptomatic or mild symptoms that the patient finds easily 
tolerated. The event is of little concern to the patient and/or of little-or-no 
clinical significance; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not 
indicated
!Grade 2, Moderate: The patient has enough discomfort to cause interference 
with or change in some of their age- appropriate instrumental activities of daily
living (e.g. preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the 
telephone, managing money); local or non-invasive intervention indicated
!Grade 3, Severe: The patient is incapacitated and unable to work or participate 
in many or all usual activities. The event is of definite concern to the patient 
and/or poses substantial risk to the patient’s health or well-being; Likely to 
require medical intervention and/or close follow-up, including but not limited 
to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318]
!Grade 4, Life-threatening: The patient was at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred
!Grade 5, Death: Related to AE
Grade 4 & 5 are SAE criteria and collected as SAE in the AE eCRF module. The following 
variables will be collected:
! Whether the AE is serious or not
! Investigator causality rating against the Investigational Product (yes or no)
! Action taken with regard to investigational product
! AE caused patient’s withdrawal from study (yes or no)
! Outcome
In addition, the following vari ables will be collected for SAEs:
! Date AE met criteria for serious AE
! Date Investigator became aware of serious AE
! AE is serious due to
! Date of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]
! Date of discharge

60(93)! Probable cause of death, if applicable
! Date of death, if applicable
! Autopsy performed, if applicable
! Causality assessment in relation to Study procedure(s)
! Description of AE
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of 
intensity whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_14540] 6.2. An AE of severe
intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. For example, nausea that persists for 
several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the criteria 
shown in Section 6.2. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of 
disability may be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE when it satisfies the criteria 
shown in Section 6.2.
6.3.[ADDRESS_754831] and each 
Adverse Event and answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question ‘Do you consider that there is a 
reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_7198]?’
For SAEs causal relationship will also be assessed for other medication and study procedures 
and additional study drug. Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study
procedure the causal relationship is implied as ‘yes’.
A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is found in Appendix B to the Clinical 
Study Protocol.
6.3.5 Adverse events based on signs and symptoms
All AEs spontaneously re ported by [CONTACT_11581] t or reported in response to the open question 
from the study personnel: ‘Have you had any health problems since the previous visit/you 
were last asked?’ or revealed by [CONTACT_178557]. 
When collecting AEs, the recording of dia gnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a 
list of signs and symptoms. However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or 
symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom 
will be recorded separately.
6.3.[ADDRESS_754832] 2018
61(93)If deterioration in a laboratory value/vital sign is  associated with clinical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory result/vital sign 
will be considered as additional information. Wherever possible the reporting Investigator 
uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (e.g. anemia versus low hemoglobin value). In 
the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically  relevant deteriorations in non-mandated 
parameters should be reported as AE(s).
Deterioration of a laboratory value, which is unequivocally due to disease progression, should 
not be reported as an AE/SAE.
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination 
as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE.
6.3.7 Liver enzymes
If a patient meets any of the followi ng criteria, please refer to Appendix D for further 
instruction: AST ≥3xULN, ALT ≥3xULN, total bilirubin ≥2xULN.
6.3.[ADDRESS_754833] is being studied (for example, anemia or CKD) should not be 
considered AEs or SAEs. This includes an increase in the severity of the disease under study, 
and an increase in the symptoms of the dis ease under study. Roxadustat is being studied for 
the treatment of anemia in CKD. CKD progression should therefore not be considered an AE 
or SAE. Acute kidney injury, when meeting diagnostic criteria (i.e. based on serum creatinine 
values or urine output), can be considered an AE or SAE. AEs or SAEs that cause anemia 
should be recorded, but anemia for which no cause is found other than CKD should not be 
reported as an AE or SAE. 
6.3.[ADDRESS_754834] or to the study procedure(s). All SA Es will be recorded in the eCRF.
If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then Investigators or other site personnel inform 
the appropriate [COMPANY_008] representatives within one day i.e. immediately but no later than 
[ADDRESS_754835] 2018
62(93)The designated [COMPANY_008] representative works with the Investigator to ensure that all the 
necessary information is provided within 1 calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life 
threatening events and within 5 calendar days of initial receipt for all other SAEs.
For fatal or life-threatening adverse events where important or relevant information is missing, 
active follow-up is undertaken immediately. Investigators or other site personnel inform 
[COMPANY_008] representatives of any follow-up information on a previously reported SAE 
within one calendar day i.e. immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she 
becomes aware of it.
Once the Investigators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the WBDC system, 
an automated email alert is sent to the designated [COMPANY_008] representative.
If the WBDC system is not available, then the Investigator or other study site personnel 
reports a SAE to the appropriate [COMPANY_008] representative by [CONTACT_756]. The [COMPANY_008] 
representative will advise the Investigator/study site personnel how to proceed. The reference 
document for definition of expectedness is the IB for the [COMPANY_008] drug.
6.5 Overdose
The maximum tolerated dose of roxadustat has not been established in humans. For the purposes of this study, exceeding the maximum allowed dose specified in this CSP (3.0 mg/kg 
or 300 mg per administration, whichever is lower) represents an overdose.
An overdose with associated AE(s) is recorded as the AE diagnosis/symptoms on the relevant 
AE modules in the eCRF and on the Overdose eCRF module.
An overdose without associated AE(s) is only reported on the Overdose eCRF module. If an 
overdose on an [COMPANY_008] study drug occurs in the course of the study, then the Investigator 
or other site personnel inform appropriate Ast raZeneca representatives immediately or no 
later than [ADDRESS_754836] 2018
63(93)6.6.[ADDRESS_754837] in terfered with the effectiveness of a 
contraceptive medication. Congenital abnormalities/birth defects and spontaneous 
miscarriages should be reported and hand led as SAEs. Elective abortions without 
complications should not be handled as AEs. The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous 
miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth or congenital abnormality) 
should be followed up and documented even if  the patient was discontinued from the study.
If any pregnancy occurs in the course of the study, then the Investigator or other site personnel 
informs the appropriate [COMPANY_008] representatives within 1day i.e. immediately but no later 
than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it.
The designated [COMPANY_008] representative works with the Investigator to ensure that all 
relevant information is provided within 1 or 5 calendar days for SAEs (see Section 6.4) and 
within 30 days for all other pregnancies.
The same timelines apply when ou tcome information is available.
6.6.2 Paternal exposure
Pregnancy of the patient’s partners is not considered to be an adverse event. However, the 
outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, 
normal birth or congenital abnormality) should if  possible be followed up and documented as 
described in Section 6.6.1 . To capture information about a pregnancy from the partner of a 
male patient, the male patient’s partner consen t must be obtained to collect information related 
to the pregnancy and outcome; the male pati ent should not be asked to provide this 
information.
6.7 Management of IP related toxicities
Observed adverse effects demonstrated in nonclinical safety studies (refer to Section 4 of the 
IB) following administration of roxadustat are primarily caused by [CONTACT_575044], which can be managed in the clinical setting. The dose algorithm 
will mitigate excessive Hb elevation.
If there are clinical concerns for a patient due to excessive elevation in Hb levels, the 
investigator may decide to perform a therapeutic phlebotomy instead of or in addition to, a 
dose hold. For overdose see Section 6.5.

7.2 Dose and treatment regimens
7.2.1 Randomization
Patients will be randomized to receive roxadustat or placebo in a 1:1 ratio in a double-blind 
manner. Randomization schedules will be pros pectively prepared. Automated randomization 
and assignment to treatment arm will be provided by [CONTACT_10966]/IVRS. The randomization in this 
study will be stratified by [CONTACT_1606].
The number of tablet bottles that will be dispensed may vary depending on the dose. 
Dispensation will be managed by [CONTACT_10966]/IVRS. The administration will be detailed on a 
dosing card. Doses administered will be recorded in the eCRF.
The administration of the first dose of study drug would mark the beginning of the treatment 
period. Hemocue values will be used for all dose adjustments, including baseline values from 
Hemocue values at randomization. Missed doses should not be replaced.
7.2.2 Starting dose and dose adjustment
The initial study drug dose (per dose o ccasion) is 70 mg orally administered three times a 
week (TIW).
The first study drug administration will be on Day 1 (week 0). Study drug doses must be 
administered at least 2 days apart and no more than 4 days apart (e.g., Monday , Wednesday, 
Friday). Study drug will be dosed TIW throughout the study treatment period unless 
downward dose adjustment requires a change to twice or once weekly.
Dose adjustments are permitted starting at week 4 and at intervals of every 4 weeks until 
week 52, every 8 weeks thereafter using the dose adjustment algorithm (see Table 4 ). If dose 
reduction is required for excessive erythropoiesis, the dose may be adjusted at any time. All 
dose adjustments are based on Hb values using Hemocue, a point-of-care device. Hb values 
will be recorded in the eCRF (during the scr eening period) and in IWRS (during the treatment 
period).

11.9 g/dL, decrease 1 dose s tep if 12 to 12.9 g/dL)
7.2.3 Dose adjustment for excessive Erythropoiesis
Excessive erythropoiesis is defined in Table 4 . In the event of excessive erythropoiesis, the 
dose may be adjusted at any time, even on visits without a dose adjustment review. In such 
cases, dose adjustment reviews are then resu med at 4-week intervals until week 52, where 
after there will be 8-week intervals. If a dose adjustment review is performed on week 18, 
then the next dose adjustment review will be scheduled on week 24, since there is no 
scheduled visit on week 22.
7.2.4 Dose adjustment for Hb ≥ 13.0g/dL
In the event of Hemocue Hb value ≥13.0g/dL, dosing will immediately be put on hold. 
Resume dosing at a subsequent visit when Hb ≤11.9 g/dL, at a dose that is reduced by [CONTACT_2874]. After dosing has been resumed, the dose adjustment reviews are then continued at 
4-week intervals until week 52, where after there will be 8-week intervals, following the same 
principle as for excessive eryth ropoiesis.

67(93)7.3 Labelling
Labelling of the investigational products will be carried out by [CONTACT_575046] (GMP). The labels will fulfil GMP 
Annex [ADDRESS_754847] label on the bottle specifies the appropriate storage.
7.5 Compliance
The administration of all study drugs (including investigational products) should be recorded in the appropriate sections of the eCRF.
7.6 Accountability
The study drug provided for this study will be us ed only as directed in the study protocol.
The study personnel will account for all study drugs dispensed to and returned from the 
patient. Study site personnel, if applicable or the [COMPANY_008] monitor will account for all 
study drugs received at the site, unused study drugs and for appropriate destruction. 
Certificates of delivery, destruction and return should be signed. Unused and/or returned 
investigational products should be destroyed according to local regulations.
7.7 Concomitant and other treatments
7.7.1 Concomitant medications
Concomitant medications are any prescription or over-the-counter preparations, including 
herbal products and “natural remedies”, used by a patient while participating in this clinical 
study. For all concomitant medications, an indication for its use should be provided. If the 
stated indication is a non-specific condition, e.g. “rash”, documentation of the condition, as 
specific as possible, should be maintained in the patient’s clinical study records as source 
documentation.
[IP_ADDRESS] Statins
When coadministered with roxadustat, hy droxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A redu ctase inhibitor 
(statin) exposure was increased 2- to 3-fold.  Invest igators should consider this interaction and 
local prescribing information when deciding on the appropriate statin dose for individual 
patients, bearing in mind the impact of ethnici ty, other concomitant medications, renal and 
hepatic function. Goals of lipid lowering treatment should be maintained as clinically
indicated. The recommended maximum daily statin doses are: simvastatin 20 mg, atorvastatin 
40 mg, rosuvastatin 10 mg, pravastatin 40 mg, fluvastatin 40 mg (20 mg if eGFR<30), 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2830] 2 mg (1 mg if eGFR<30).

68(93)[IP_ADDRESS] Phosphate binders
When coadministered with phosphate binders, roxadustat exposure was reduced. Patients 
should be advised to discuss with the inve stigator before changing their phosphate binder dose 
or dosing time. To optimize absorption of roxadustat, subjects should take roxadustat with at 
least 1 hour separation from their phosphate binder.
[IP_ADDRESS] Herbal medicines
Use of herbal medicine during the study is not prohibited but strongly discouraged. All herbal 
and natural remedies should be reviewed by [CONTACT_3433] e investigator and if considered safe, may be 
allowed to continue at the same dose.
7.7.2 Prohibited medications
The following medications/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_53130]:
! Any other investigational drug: from randomization until EOS
! Any erythropoi etin anal ogues during the treatment period, except as rescue 
medication (Section [IP_ADDRESS] )
! Iron-ch elating agents (e.g. de feroxamine/desferrioxamine, deferiprone or 
deferaxirox therapy): from 4 weeks prior to screening until EOS
! Androgens: from randomization onwards until EOS
! Dapsone (at any dose) from randomisation to EOS
! Chronic doses of acetaminophen/paracetam ol >2.0 g/day fro m randomization until 
EOS

treatment.
In addition to scheduled assessments ( Table 1 ), iron indices may be assessed anytime (via 
central lab) to evaluate iron storage status of the patients, if considered necessary by [CONTACT_1275].
7.7.[ADDRESS_754850] 2018
69(93)[IP_ADDRESS] Intravenous iron supplementation
The use of intravenous iron is not encouraged in the setting of this placebo-controlled study. 
Oral iron is recommended for dietary supplementation to support erythropoiesis and as the 
first-line for prevention and treatment of iron deficien cy, unless the patient is intolerant to this 
treatment.
The investigator may initiate the use of an approved IV iron supplement if:
! the patient is receiving or does not tolerate oral iron, and
! Hb < 8.5 g/dL and
! Ferritin <100 ng/ml orTransferrin saturation (TSAT) <20%
Study treatment may continue duri ng IV iron administration. Ferritin and TSAT assessment is 
recommended 4 weeks after IV iron administration. Discontinuation of IV iron 
supplementation is recommended once the patient is no longer considered to be iron deficient 
(ferritin≥100 ng/mL and TSAT ≥20%) or Hb >9 g/dL, whichever comes first. Use of IV iron 
will be recorded in the eCRF.
[IP_ADDRESS] Red blood cell transfusion
Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is allowed if rapid correction of anemia is required to 
stabilize the patient’s condition (e.g. acute hemorrha ge) or the investigator is of the opi[INVESTIGATOR_270118] a medical necessity. Study drug treatment may continue during or 
after RBC transfusion administration. Transfusion will be recorded in the eCRF.
[IP_ADDRESS] Initiation of Rescue with an approved erythropoietin analogue
The investigator may initiate use of an a pproved eryt hropoietin an alogue if all of the 
following criteria are met:
! A patient’s Hb level has not sufficiently responded to two or more dose increases or 
the maximum dose limit of the study drug has been reached, and
! The patient’s Hb is <8.0 g/dL on two consecutive measurements drawn at least five 
days apart; and
! Clinical judgment does not suggest iron deficiency or bleeding as a cause of lack of 
response or rapid decline in Hb (see [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS] above for addressing these 
conditions), and
! Reducing the risk of alloimmunization in transplant eligible patients and/or 
reduction of other RBC transfusion-related risks is a goal
The patient is not allowed to be administered both erythropoietin analogue and study drug at 
the same time. For patients not on dialysis, treatment with eryth ropoietin anal ogue should be

! One week after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_167386]
! Two weeks after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_167387]-epoetin beta (Mircera)
Use of erythropoietin anal ogues will be recorded in the eCRF.
Patients may receive [ADDRESS_754852] time, study drug should be permanently 
discontinued (see Section 3.9.3 ). Study drug should be permanently discontinued for subjects 
who initiate dialysis and who are clinically judged to require eryth ropoietin anal ogue therapy.
[IP_ADDRESS] Therapeutic Phlebotomy
If there are clinical concerns for a p atient due to excessive elevation in Hb levels, the 
investigator may decide to perform a therapeutic phlebotomy instead of, or in addition to, a 
dose hold. This should be documented and discussed with the study [COMPANY_008] study
physician.
[IP_ADDRESS] Other concomitant treatment
Other medication than described above, which is considered necessary for the patient’s safety 
and well-being, may be given at the discretion of the Investigator and recorded in the 
appropriate sections in the eCRF.

71(93)8.2 Sample size estimate
Primary efficacy endpoint: A sample size of [ADDRESS_754854] > 99% power to detect a 
0.75 g/dL difference in mean Hb values between the two treatment groups, assuming that the 
common standard deviation is 1.2 g/dL, using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) test with a 
0.05 two-sided significance level.
To contribute adjudicated CV safety events for the pooled CV analyses across the phase 3 
program: approximately 2600 subjects are planned to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either 
roxadustat or placebo. The sample size in this study is driven by [CONTACT_309548] 3 program in CKD-NDD (which consists of 3 studies in 
total targeting 465 subjects with MACE events). The two other placebo-controlled studies in 
the study program are FGCL-4592-[ADDRESS_754855] ical analysis plan and the pooled s tatistical analy sis plan.
8.3 Definitions of analysis sets
8.3.1 Intention To Treat Analysis Set (ITT)
All subjects who have been randomized to study treatment will be included irrespective of 
their protocol adherence and continued particip ation in the study. Subjects will be analysed 
according to their randomized study medication irrespective of intak e of study medication. 
8.3.2 Per Protocol Set (PPS)
All randomized subjects without important protocol deviations and who have received at least 
[ADDRESS_754856] intake of study 
drug. The Safety Analysis Set may also be referred to as On-treatment+28 (OT+28).

72(93)8.3.4 Full Analysis Set (FAS)
The FAS consists of all subjects in the ITT analysis set who received at least one dose of 
study drug and have baseline and at least one post-dose Hb assessment. If actual study 
medication received differs from the randomized treatment arm, the randomized treatment 
arm will be used for analysis for the FAS.  This analysis set is primarily used for EX-US 
submissions.
8.3.[ADDRESS_754858] not signed an informed consent, subjects randomized in error (e.g. a subject 
considered to be a screen fail but by [CONTACT_309570] a technical 
error). Further, subjects being randomized more than once will only contribute to the analysis 
one time. These patients will be analyzed according to their first assigned randomization 
number and treatment code. All AE’s reported for the subjects will be assigned to the 
subject´s first randomization number. All subjects excluded from all analysis sets will be 
properly documented. 
8.4 Outcome measures for analyses
8.4.1 Primary efficacy endpoint
US FDA: The primary efficacy endpoint for the US is the mean change from baseline in Hb 
averaged over week 28 to week 52. A mult iple imputation approach with analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) will be applied as a method to handle missing data. Details of the 
multiple imputation ANCOVA are provided in the SAP.
Hb results obtained from the central laboratory will be used for all Hb efficacy analyses. 
Baseline Hb is defined as the mean of the three last central laboratory Hb values from the 
screening and randomization visits. 
Hb values under the influence of a rescue therapy w ill not be censored.
EU health authorities: The primary efficacy endpoint is whether patients achieved Hb 
response as described below.

g/dL
at two consecutive visits [dates] (with available data) separated at least [ADDRESS_754860] 24 weeks of treatment without having received rescue therapy (RBC transfusion, ESA, or IV iron) prior to Hb response. Subjects who have discontinued 
study medication or received rescue therapy before a Hb response could be achieved 
will be considered as a non-responder.

The Hb related secondary efficacy variables are:
!The EU primary endpoint is the first secondary efficacy endpoint the analysis for FDA
!Mean change in Hb from baseline to the subjects mean level between week 28 to week 
52 in subjects with baseline high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) greater than 
the Upper Limit Normal (ULN)
!Proportion of total time of Hb ≥10 g/dL from week 28 to week 52. The proportion of 
total time will be computed as follows: For each subject, the recorded Hb values will 
first be linearly interpolated between measuremen ts. The time this interpolated curve is 
≥10 g/dL will be computed and subsequently divided by [CONTACT_575047] 28 and week 52. Patients without any Hb measurements from 
week 28 will not be considered for this variable.

censoring, the date of censoring. 
8.4.5 36-Item Short Form Health Survey
The SF-36 is a QoL instrument designed to asse ss generic health concepts relevant across
age, disease, and treatment groups. It is aimed at both adults and adolescents aged eighteen
years and older. The SF-36 consists of eight domains of health s tatus: Physical functioning
(10 items), Role-physical (4 items), Bodily pain (2 items), General health (5 items), Vitality (4 
items), Social functioning (2 items), Role emotional (3 items) and Mental health (5 items).
Two component scores, the Physical Component Summary and the Mental Component
Summary can also be calculated. For both the SF-36 domain scores and summary scores,
higher scores indicate better health status. The SF-36 has a recall period of the ‘past four
weeks’.
• Change from baseline in SF-36 Physical Functioning (PF) sub-score • Change from baseline in SF- 36 Vitality (VT) sub-score

4. geographical region (US vs Ex-US)
Baseline Hb and baseline eGFR will be included in the analyses as continuous covariates, not 
as dichotomous factors, unless specified otherw ise. Throughout this document, the variable 
cardiovascular/cerebrovascular/thromboembo lic med ical history will be shortened as CV 
history.
CV history at baseline will be defined for subjects with history of any of the following 
diseases:

24 weeks of treatment without having received rescue therapy (RBC transfusion, ESA, or IV 
iron) prior to Hb response. The first date of the tw o consecutive visits will be used as the date 
of response. The second date of the two consecutive visits will be used when evaluating the 
presence or absence of rescue therapy. The proportion of responders in the primary efficacy 
variable will be compared using a Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel (CMH) test adjusting for the 
region, history of CV, baseline Hb (<=8, >8 g/dL) and baseline eGFR (<=30, >30 
mL/min/1.73 m2), comparing roxadustat to placebo. The FAS will be used.

FURTHER GUIDANCE ON THE DEFINITION OF A SERIOUS 
ADVERSE EVENT (SAE)
Life threatening
‘Life-threatening’ means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the sub ject’s
death. ‘Life-threatening’ does not mean that had an AE occurred in a more severe form it
might have caused death (eg, hepatitis that resolved without hepatic failure).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_291427] a serious AE, alt hough the reasons 
for it may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2144]/or surg ical 
operations planned before or during a study are not considered AEs if the illness or disease 
existed before the subject was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an 
unexpected way during the study.
Important medical event or medical intervention
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important medical events may not be immediately life threatening or result in 
death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], disability or incapacity but may jeopardize the subject or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definition of serious.
These should usually be considered as serious.
Simply stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_33095]; medical 
judgement must be used.
! Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hydrocortisone 
treatment
! Hepatotoxicity caused by [CONTACT_76475] (acetaminophen) overdose requiring 
treatment with N-acetylcysteine
! Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm

89(93)A GUIDE TO INTERPRETING THE CA[LOCATION_003]LITY QUESTION
When making an assessment of causality consider the following factors when deciding if there 
is a ‘reasonable possibility’ that an AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_33641].
! Time Course.  Exposure to suspect drug.  Has the subject actually received the 
suspect drug?  Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relationship to the 
administration of the suspect drug?
! Consistency with known drug profile. Was the AE consistent with the previous 
knowledge of the suspect drug (pharmacology a nd toxicology) or drugs of the same 
pharmacological class? Or could the AE be anticipated from its pharmacological 
properties?
! De-challenge experience. Did the AE resolve or improve on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_96699]?
! No alternative cause. The AE cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_377645], other drugs, other host or environmental factors.
! Re-challenge experience. Did the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was 
reintroduced after having been stopped? [COMPANY_008] would not normally 
recommend or support a re-challenge.
! Laboratory tests. A specific laboratory investigation (if performed) has confirmed 
the relationship.
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:
! Is this a recognized feature of overdose of the drug?
! Is there a known mechanism?
Causality of ‘yes’ is made if following a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a 
‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal relationship for the individual case. The expression 
‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.
The causality assessment is performed based on the available data including enough 
information to make an informed judgment. With limited or insufficient information in the 
case, it is likely that the event(s) will be assessed as ‘no’.
Causal relationship in cases where the disease under study has deteriorated due to lack of 
effect should be classified as no reasonable possibility.

90(93)Appendix C International Airline Transportation Association (IATA) 6.[ADDRESS_754893] SAMPLES
International Airline Transportation Association (IATA) classifies biohazardous agents into 
3 categories (http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/dangerous_goods/infectious_ substances.htm) . For 
transport purposes the classification of infectious substances according to risk groups was 
removed from the Dangerous Goods Regulations (DGR) in the 46th edition (2005). Infectious 
substances are now classified either as Category A, Category B or Exempt. There is no direct 
relationship between Risk Groups and categories A and B.
Category A Infectious Substances are infectious substances in a form that, when exposure to 
it occurs, is capable of causing permanent disability, life-threatening or fatal disease in 
otherwise healthy humans or animals. Category A pathogens are eg, Ebola, Lassa fever virus:
! are to be packed and shipped in accordance with IATA Instruction 602.
Category B Infectious Substances are infectious Substances that do not meet the criteria for 
inclusion in Category A. Category B pathogens are eg, Hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E viruses, 
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2. They are assigned the following UN

91(93)Appendix D Actions Required in Ca ses of Combined Increase of 
Aminotransferase and Total Bilirubin – Hy’s Law
1. INTRODUCTION
During the course of the study the Investigator will remain vigilant for increases in liver 
biochemistry. The investigator is responsible for determining whether a patient meets potential
Hy’s Law (PHL) criteria at any point during the study.
The Investigator participates, together with [COMPANY_008] clinical project representatives, in 
review and assessment of cases meeting PHL criteria to agree whether Hy’s Law (HL) criteria 
are met. HL criteria are met if there is no alternative explanation for the elevations in liver 
biochemistry other than Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) caused by [CONTACT_255762] (IMP).
The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for 
reporting Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Ad verse Events (SAE) according to the outcome 
of the review and assessment in line with standard safety reporting processes.
2. DEFINITIONS
Potential Hy’s Law (PHL)
Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) or Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) ≥3x Upper Limit of 
Normal (ULN) and Total Bilirubin (TBL) ≥2xULN at any point during the study irrespective 
of an increase in Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP). The elevations do not have to occur at the same 
time or within a specified time frame.
Hy’s Law (HL)
AST or ALT ≥3x ULN and TBL≥2xULN, where no other reason, other than the IMP, can 
be found to explain the combination of increases, eg, elevated ALP indicating cholestasis, viral
hepatitis, another drug. The elevations do not have to occur at the same time or within a 
specified time frame.
3. IDENTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL HY’S LAW CASES
In order to identify cases of PHL it is important to perform a comprehensive review of laboratory data for any patient who meets any of the following identification criteria in 
isolation or in combination while there is no alternative causation:
! ALT≥3xULN
! AST≥3xULN
! TBL≥2xULN
Clinical Study Protocol Appendix D
Drug Substance Roxadustat
Study Code  D5740C00001
Version 6.[ADDRESS_754895] 2018
92(93)When a patient meets any of the identification criteria, in isolation or in combination, the 
central laboratory will immediately send an alert to the Investigator (also sent to [COMPANY_008] 
representative).
The Investigator will also remain vigilant for any local laboratory reports where the 
identification criteria are met, where this is the case the Investigator w ill:
! Request a repeat of the test (new blood draw) by [CONTACT_2237]
! Complete the appropriate unscheduled laboratory CRF module(s) with the original 
local laboratory test result
When the identification criteria are met from central or local laboratory results the Investigator 
will without delay:
! Determine whether the patient meets PHL criteria (see Section 2of this Appendix 
for definition) by [CONTACT_48886] (including both central and local laboratory results)
4. FOLLOW-UP
4.1 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria not met
If the patient does not meet PHL criteria the Investigator will:
! Inform the [COMPANY_008] representative that the patient has not met PHL criteria.
! Perform follow-up on subsequent laboratory results according to the guidance 
provided in the Clinical Study Protocol.
4.2 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria met
If the patient does meet PHL criteria the Investigator will:
! Notify the [COMPANY_008] representative who will then inform the central Study Team
The Study Physician contacts the Investigator, to provide guidance, discuss and agree an 
approach for the study patients’ follow-up and the continuous review of data. Subsequent to 
this contact [CONTACT_48887]:
! Monitor the patient until liver biochemistry parameters and appropriate clinical 
symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically 
indicated
! Investigate the etiology of the event and perform diagnostic investigations as 
discussed with the Study Physician
! Complete the three Liver CRF Modules as information becomes available
Clinical Study Protocol Appendix D

Study Code  D5740C00001
Version 6.[ADDRESS_754896] 2018
93(93)! If at any time (in consultation with the Study Physician) the PHL case meets serious 
criteria, report it as an SAE using standard reporting procedures
5. REVIEW AND ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL HY’S LAW 
CASES
The instructions in this Section should be followed for all cases where PHL criteria are met. 
No later than [ADDRESS_754897] and TBL elevations, a 
determination of whether the alternative explanation is an AE will be made and subsequently 
whether the AE meets the criteria for a SAE:
! If the alternative explanation is notan AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appropriate CRF
! If the alternative explanation is an AE/SAE, record the AE /SAE in the CRF 
accordingly and follow the AZ standard processes
If it is agreed that there is no explanation that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the IMP:
! Report an SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to [COMPANY_008] standard 
processes.
− The ‘Medically Important’ serious criterion should be used if no other serious 
criteria apply
− As there is no alternative explanation for the HL case, a causality assessment
of
‘related’ should be assigned.
If, there is an unavoidable delay, of over 3 weeks, in obtaining the information necessary to 
assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that there is no 
alternative explanation until such time as an informed decision can be made:
! R e p o r ta nS A E  ( r e p o r tt e r m‘ P o t e n t i a lH y ’ sL a w ’ )a p p l y i n gs e r i o u s  c r i t e r i aa n d

Version 6.[ADDRESS_754898] 2018
94(94)! Continue follow-up and review according to agreed plan. Once the necessary 
supplementary information is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to 
determine whether HL criteria are met. Update the SAE report according to the 
outcome of the review

3. Abstract:   Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and coexisting chronic kidney disease 
(CKD) are at increased risk of atherothrombotic events, underscoring the importance of 
secondary prevention an tiplatelet therapy in these high -risk patients. Clopi[INVESTIGATOR_468602] P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor in patients with coronary artery disease 
(CAD). However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_468603], many patients still experience recurrent 
atherothr ombotic events. This is in part due to the impaired effects of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_468604], particularly among those with coexisting CKD. However, underlying 
mechanism(s) leading to magnification of impaired clopi[INVESTIGATOR_468605] r emain unexplored. The ever growing prevalence of CKD in patients 
with DM and their high risk of recurrent events underscores the need to define such 
mechanism(s) as this may set the basis for identifying treatment regimens leading to 
more effective platele t inhibition and cardiovascular protection in these high -risk patients. 
The proposed study will test the central hypothesis that in DM patients the presence of 
CKD reduces clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] -mediated P2Y [ADDRESS_600569] identifier.  
4.  Background:   Patients with DM are at increased risk of atherothrombotic events [1,2]. 
Importantly, DM is a key risk factor for the development of CKD, which further enhances 
atherothrombotic risk [3 -5]. These observations underscore the importance of antiplatelet 
therapy for secondary prevention of atherothrombotic recurrences in these high -risk 
patients. Clopi[INVESTIGATOR_468606] P2Y [ADDRESS_600570] to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], reduces ischemic eve nt rates in high -risk patients with CAD [6,7]. 
However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_468607], DM patients 
frequently experience recurrent atherothrombotic events [2,8]. This may be in part due to 
the impaired PK and PD effects of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_468608] -DM patients [8 -10]. Moreover, studies have also 
shown patients with CKD  to have reduced clinical benefit with clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] [11 -14]. 
However, PD studies provide mixed r esults on the independent role of CKD as a 
determinant of impaired clopi[INVESTIGATOR_468609] [15 -19]. This may be attributed to confounders 
intrinsic to the heterogeneous study populations in which these studies have been

consistently shown that the presence of impaired renal function markedly reduces 
clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] -induced antiplatelet effects [15,17]. These PD findings may explain why DM 
patients with CKD are particularly at increased  risk of atherothrombotic recurrences [20]. 
However, the underlying mechanism(s) leading to magnification of impaired clopi[INVESTIGATOR_468610]. The increased 
cardiovascular (CV) risk of DM patients is in part attri buted to increased platelet reactivity 
and inadequate response to oral antiplatelet agents, including clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] [1,2,6]. 
Reduced clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] -induced antiplatelet effects among DM patients may in part account 
for their poor outcomes after percutaneous cor onary intervention (PCI) [1,2,8,9,17,21 -23]. 
This is mainly due to an attenuation of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]’s PK profile, characterized by [CONTACT_468622] [9,24]. Notably, patients with high platelet reactivity (HPR) while 
on clopi[INVESTIGATOR_468611] [25 -26]. CKD is a 
pandemic public health problem [27 -29] and patients with all stages of CKD are at 
increased CV risk, including increased mortality [30 -37]. In CAD patients, the presence of 
either DM or CKD increase s long -term CV events to a similar extent. However, when DM 
and CKD coexist, the risk is further amplified [20]. Mechanisms explaining the enhanced 
CV risk carried by [CONTACT_468623] -based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] [38], 
endothelial dysfun ction, platelet activation and reduced response to antiplatelet therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] 
[14,39]. Subgroup analysis of clinical trials showed a reduced benefit of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_468612] [14]. High levels of circulating procoagulant factors, increased thrombin 
genera tion, abnormalities of nitric oxide synthesis, upregulation of the P2Y [ADDRESS_600572] been proposed to explain platelet 
hyperreactivity among CKD patients [14,39]. Platelets from patients with CKD are 
exposed to higher levels of dinucleoside polyphosphates, which can up -regulate the 
platelet P2Y [ADDRESS_600573] [40 -42]. Further, CKD is associated with reduced activity 
of the hepatic CYP system, a key mediator of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_468613], which can lead to 
reduce d generation of C -AM [43-44]. Indeed, high platelet reactivity in patients with DM 
and CKD may be due to a synergistic effect of the two clinical disorders, which contribute 
to the enhanced risk of CV events when they coexist [20].  
Understanding the mecha nisms leading to the different pharmacological profiles of P2Y [ADDRESS_600574] risk of CV events. The prognostic implications associated 
with inad equate antiplatelet drug response are noteworthy, given that 30 -40% of ACS 
patients have DM associated with CKD [45] and ischemic recurrences, which are higher 
in the presence of DM and CKD, represent a major health care burden. In the US more 
than $150 bi llion is spent on ACS care, and 60% of the costs are a result of ischemic 
recurrences [46,47]. The results of the proposed investigation will have the potential to 
help interpret findings from large scale clinical trials as well as help optimize and 
person alize antiplatelet treatment in this high -risk setting.

PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949] :  10/21/[ADDRESS_600575] study 
specifically and prospectively designed to comprehensively address this area of unmet 
need.  
5. Specific Aims:   The pr oposed study will test the central hypothesis  that in coronary 
artery disease (CAD) patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), the presence of chronic kidney 
disease (CKD) reduces clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] -mediated P2Y [ADDRESS_600576] and impaired 
clopi[INVESTIGATOR_468613]. Our approach is innovative  since to date there has not been any 
comprehensive pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetic (PK) study, involving both 
ex vivo  and in vitro experiments, evaluating the impact of CKD on antiplatelet drug 
response in DM patients. The study proposed is significant  since it advances our 
understanding on therapeutic approaches aimed to improve outcomes in a high -risk 
patient population represen ting a pandemic health care problem such as those with DM 
and CKD. Two study aims have been elaborated to reach our goals:  
- AIM [ADDRESS_600577] in DM 
patients with and without CKD. Study hypothesi s: DM patients with CKD have 
upregulation of the platelet P2Y [ADDRESS_600578] compared to DM without CKD. 
Rationale : Platelets from patients with CKD are exposed to higher levels of dinucleoside 
polyphosphates, which can act as agonist of P2Y 12 causing a decrease in VASP 
(vasodilator -stimulated phosphoprotein) phosphorylation and therefore lead to 
upregulation of the platelet P2Y [ADDRESS_600579]. The investigational sequence  to 
pursue this study aim will imply serial and comprehensive PD ass essments in DM 
patients with and without CKD as assessed ex vivo  following treatment with clopi[INVESTIGATOR_468614] P2Y 12 antagonism, in the setting of a prospective study 
design.  
- AIM 2.  To assess profiles of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_468613] i n DM patients with and without 
CKD. Study hypothesis : DM patients with CKD have impaired clopi[INVESTIGATOR_468613]. 
Rationale : CKD is associated with reduced activity of the hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 
system, which is a key mediator of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_468615]. The investigational sequence  
to pursue this study aim will imply comprehensive and serial PK assessments of 
clopi[INVESTIGATOR_87238] -drug and clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]’s active metabolite (C -AM; R-130964 ) after 
administration of a clopi[INVESTIGATOR_181824] (LD) in DM patients  with and without CKD.  
6. Research Plan:   Study Aims [ADDRESS_600580] of a 
prospective open -label design in which CAD patients with DM on low -dose (81 mg) 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_468616]. Patients will be stratified accor ding to CKD status 
into CKD and non -CKD groups. CKD will be defined according to the functional definition 
of the KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) guidelines (CKD: glomerular 
filtrate rate [GFR] <60ml/min/1.73m2; non -CKD: GFR ≥ 60ml/min/1. 73m2) [53,54]. The 
rationale for considering the functional classification to initially stratify patients is in line 
with clinical studies showing the increased CV risk and markedly dysfunctional platelets

IRB version :  03.09.04  
PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949] :  10/21/2021   according to GFR strata [12,13,15]. For patient st ratification, GFR will be estimated 
through the CKD -EPI (chronic kidney disease epi[INVESTIGATOR_8261]) equation, as 
this is suggested by [CONTACT_8289], especially 
for values in the normal range (above 60ml/min /1.73m2) [53,54]. For comparison, kidney 
function will also be estimated with the MDRD (modification of diet in renal disease) and 
Cockcroft -Gault equations. In addition, as exploratory analysis, renal function will also be 
classified according to markers of kidney damage, in particular albuminuria, in order to 
obtain a more comprehensive information about CKD [53,54]. Albuminuria will be 
evaluated as albumin -to-creatinine ration (ACR) expressed in mg/g, which is 
approximately equivalent to albumin excretio n rate. According to KDIGO guidelines, CKD 
will be defined as ACR >30mg/g and non -CKD as ACR ≤30mg/g [53,54]. Albuminuria will 
be measured on random untimed spot urine samples. Patients’ metabolic status and 
glycemic control will be assessed at 
baseline by [CONTACT_468624], HbA1c and lipid 
profile.  
After providing informed consent, in 
the ex vivo  experimental component 
of our study, eligible patients will be 
administered a 600 -mg LD of 
clopi[INVESTIGATOR_468617] a single 75 -
mg MD administered after 24 hours; 
blood samples for PD (Study Aim 1) 
and PK (Study Aim 2) assessments 
will be collected at a total of 8 time 
points: baseline (before LD 
administration) and 30 minutes, 1 
hour, 2 hours, 4 hours,  6 hours and 
24 hours after LD (before administration of MD), and 2 hours after administration of the 75 
mg MD of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]. In the in vitro  experimental design of our study (Study Aim 1), 
blood samples collected at baseline only (before LD administratio n) will be used; PD 
testing will be performed before and after incubation (for 30 minutes at 37°C) with 
escalating concentrations of C -AM (1, 3 and 10 μM). This will allow to specifically explore 
the functional status of the P2Y [ADDRESS_600581] . A flow  diagram of the study design is 
presented in Figure 4. In order to account for possible confounders, CYP2C19 genetic 
status (the major genetic determinant of clopi[INVESTIGATOR_468613]) will be assessed through 
a rapid assay  or by [CONTACT_468625]. Labo ratory personnel will be blinded to group 
assignment.  
b)  Study population : Patients will be recruited at the cardiology clinics of the University of 
[LOCATION_012] -Jacksonville. Patients will be approached by [CONTACT_468626]. Consent will be reviewed and the patient will be given time 
to ask any questions and have all concerns addressed.

c) Laboratory assessments  
Our group has been deeply  invested in conducting translational investigations assessing 
P2Y [ADDRESS_600583] our study aims, as supported by [CONTACT_468627].  
Blood sampling:  blood sampling for the ex vivo  component of our experiment will be 
performed at baseline and at 7 time points, as described above. For the in vitro  
component of our experiment, blood will be collected at baselin e and will be incubated 
with escalating concentrations (1, 3 and 10 μM) of C -AM (Figure 4).  
PD assessments:  
(1) VerifyNow PRU : The VerifyNow System is a turbidimetric based optical detection 
system which measures platelet aggregation as an increase in lig ht transmittance 
(Accriva, San Diego, CA, [LOCATION_003]) [56]. The assay is based on microbead agglutination and 
uses specific reagents for the pathways of interest. The change in optical signal is 
reported in PRU. HPR will be defined using consensus definitions, ba sed on cut -off levels 
associated with an increased risk of recurrent ischemic events, as PRU> 208 [26].  
(2) Whole blood vasodilator -stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP):  VASP phosphorylation 
(VASP -P) is a marker of P2Y [ADDRESS_600584] protocols [56]. VASP -P levels will be quantified with ELISA method with the 
Platelet VASP -FCM kit (Biocytex Inc., Marseille, [LOCATION_009]) and the platelet reactivity index 
(PRI) calculated. HPR will be defined using consensus definition s as PRI> 50% [26].  
(3) Light transmittance aggregometry (LTA) : LTA will be assessed using platelet rich 
plasma (PRP) by [CONTACT_8294] a 2 -channel aggregometer (Chrono -Log 
Corp., Havertown, PA, [LOCATION_003]) as previously described [56]. Platelet agon ists will include 5 
and 20 μmol/L ADP. HPR will be defined using consensus definitions as maximal 
aggregation >59% and >46% with ADP 20 μmol/L and 5 μmol/L, respectively) [26].

PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949] :  10/21/2021   PK assessment:  determination of C -AM and clopi[INVESTIGATOR_87238] -drug concentrations in  
plasma will be performed using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry 
according to standard protocols as previously described [9]. The geometric mean area 
under the concentration -time curve through the sampling time of the last quantifiable C -
AM concentration (AUC[[ADDRESS_600585]]), the maximum observed plasma concentration (C max) of C -
AM, and the time to reach maximum concentration (T max) will be calculated.  
Genetic testing:  
Spartan RX rapid genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007] : Spartan RX (Spartan Bioscience Inc., Ontario, C anada) is 
a rapid genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_468618]2C19 (*1,*2,*3,*17) allele status 
within [ADDRESS_600586] consists of four separate steps: acquisition of a buccal swab, 
insertion of the swab into the cartridge, insertion of the reaction sol ution into the device, 
and analysis of CYP2C19 genotype triggered by a button on the device [57 -58]. 
Central lab genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: genetic testing to determine the CYP2C19 (*1, *2, *3, *17) allele 
status will be performed at baseline by [CONTACT_468628] a whole blood 
sample  using standard techniques if rapid genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_468619].  
Dinucleoside polyphosphates levels: Diadenosine polyphosphate (Ap(n)A) content in the 
supernatant and in intact platelets will be determined at baseline using a chromatographic 
assay established on the basis of affinity - and reversed -phase chromatographic methods, 
as previously described [42].  
Assessment of metabolic control: Fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c and lipid panel (total 
cholesterol, HDL, LDL and triglyce rides) will be measured at baseline by [CONTACT_468629] . 
7. Possible Discomforts and Risks:  The most common clinical side effects of 
Clopi[INVESTIGATOR_468620] (itching), purpura (purple colored spots), diarrhea, rash, and 
bleeding that can be minor, life-threatening or fatal. The risks of the blood draw may 
include faintness, inflammation of the vein, pain, bruising or bleeding at the site of the 
puncture.There is also a slight risk of infection from the blood draw.  
8. Possible Benefits:  There is no g uarantee that you will personally benefit by 
[CONTACT_422221]. We hope to improve our knowledge about the effects 
of Clopi[INVESTIGATOR_468621].  
9. Conflict of Interest:  None

 A. SPECIFIC AIMS  
Preterm infants and term infants who suffer hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) are at high risk for 
motor problems, which primarily manifest as feeding delays during their neonatal hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] . 
Oromotor dyscoordination  is very common in both groups of infants, and typi[INVESTIGATOR_20187] [ADDRESS_665891] milk o r formula to 
sustain adequate growth for discharge. Occupational therapy usually works with infants once a day to 
ensure that the feeding particulars , such as nipple choice, frequency of oral feeding , do not tax  infant 
physiology  too greatly and to guide learning this motor skill . Feeding difficult y is the primary reason for 
delayed discharge  of preterm or HIE infants . Many of these infants will not be able to master this motor 
skill before term age (40-42 weeks gestation)  and will receive a gastrostomy tube (G-tube)  for direct 
gastric feeding,  in order that they may finally be discharged  from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21104] . Over the past 5 
years in our MUSC NICU (2012- 2016), we have placed an average of 40 G -tubes per year. This 
procedure requires general anesthesia for both insertion and eventual take down, and leaves scars in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_513957]. The G -tube also reinforces the parental perception that their child is not normal and 
that he or she has a more limited developmental potential than a ‘normal’ child . 
 Even with significant brain injury, we know that neuroplasticity in infants may lead to improved, and 
even near normal outcomes. This neuroplasticity involves stimulating neurogenesis and reparative 
inter-neuronal connections to improve motor skills in neonatal animal models and in adults after stroke . 
In addition,  we know that rehabilitative training may be enhance d by [CONTACT_513991] a variety of 
modalities.  
 
In recent years scientists have discovered that plasticity increases if you pair a stimulus or behavior 
with stimulation of the vagus nerve. We think that the vagus signal likely activates norepi[INVESTIGATOR_513958]. This time -dependent signal to the cortex and other parts of the 
brain ‘tells it’ to pay attention to or be alert for other novel signals. By [CONTACT_513992] a stimulus or behavior, 
scientists and clinicians can improve p rocesses that involve neuroplasticity, like learning or 
rehabilitati ng a motor skill . Precisely targeted neural plasticity accomplished through Vagal Nerve 
Stimulation (VNS) and stimulus pairing has so far been shown to improve  treatment of neurological 
disorders associated with motor function, tinnitus , and stroke. In motor studies  in rats , VNS  paired with 
movement led to a doubling  in size of the primary motor cortex associated with the paired movement, 
whereas rats receiving identical moto r training without VNS pairing did not exhibit motor cortex plasticity 
(1). In stroke, patients who received VNS paired with rehabilitation demonstrated a significant increase 
in their Upper Extremity Fugl –Meyer score compared with patients who received rehabilitation without 
VNS (2). In a different model of tinnitus in  noise- exposed rats, VNS paired with auditory tones 
completely eliminated the physiological and behavioral symptoms  of tinnitus (3), and the same 
treatment in humans  seemed to exert a beneficial effect in nonmedication -taking patients, both with 
regard to perceived sound and distress (4). There are now ongoing FDA -pi[INVESTIGATOR_513959] ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) 
or pairing VNS with sounds to improve tinnitus  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) . These pi[INVESTIGATOR_513960] a  
small startup company (MicroTransponder) whose patent portfolio involves surgically implanted cervical 
VNS.

 Cervically implanted vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an FDA approved treatment for epi[INVESTIGATOR_513961] , with the first implant in humans in 1988  (5,6). Although cervical VNS is relatively safe 
and effective in seizure prevention (7,8)  the risks involved in surgical implantation as well as its high 
cost (about $30 -50k) make it less appealing and less availab le as a treatment modality.  
 
Recently it has been shown that VNS can be administered non -invasively through stimulating the 
auricular branch of the vagus nerve located in the ear (4, 9,10) with a transcutaneous electrical nerve 
stimulation (TENS)  device . TENS is a very common , FDA- approved therapy for pain management. 
Researchers in the brain stimulation lab here at  MUSC have conducted initial safety and feasib ility trials 
of transcranial auricular VNS (taVNS) in healthy adults . In these studies, there were no minor or major 
adverse effects observed throughout the duration of their trial. Their work validates ideal parameters for 
delivering  taVNS, suggesting that one-minute taVNS periods at 200% perceptual threshold delivered at 
500μs 10H z are safe and tolerable  and produce regional brain changes consistent with activating the 
vagus nerve related brain regions involved in neuroplasticity  (10). 
 
Surgically implanted cervical VNS is expensive, risky, and would not likely be used for transien t boosts 
of normal motor development. However, if we can use noninvasive taVNS rather than implanted VNS, 
this promising research modality may be translated to more fragile infants. Such a safe, bedside 
treatment would be ideal for preterm and HIE neonates trying to master motor skills  that are reflexive 
for normal near term neonates, but must be learned for those infants born prematurely or relearned for 
those with brain injury.  The added benefits of enhancing accomplishment of this primary motor task 
would be earlier discharge, lower hospi[INVESTIGATOR_464931] s, improved parental perception of the developmental 
potential of their infant, and finally reduced stress and better bonding with parents, both in and out of 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
 
Feeding in neonates involves a sequence of sucking, swallowing, and breathing that requires 
coordination of the face, head, and neck muscles with the myelinated vagal regulation of the bronchi 
and the heart (11). In preterm neonates, the muscles needed to feed are underdeveloped , result ing in 
the need for OT rehabilitation to ‘learn ’ feeding patterns . Preterm neonates’ inability to feed effectively 
is the primary reason for prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7959]  (12). In neonates with HI E, development of cortex 
and basal ganglia is interrupted, and depending on the severity, normal developmental plasticity is 
hindered,  further contributing to their inability to feed (13). Both types of feeding difficulties involve 
complex motor learning, which requires integration of sensory and motor pathways. Treating oromotor 
difficult ies during the  learned task of feeding with noninvasive brain stimulation that promotes plasticity , 
poses a highly novel application of taVNS. Our major premise is that in babies at high risk for motor 
problems, simultaneously delivered brain stimulation via taVNS will boost motor cortical plasticity 
involved in a learned feeding task , leading to better feeding .  
 
This protocol has 2 specific aim s that will be investigated:  
 
Specific A im 1: Improved Motor Learning - We aim to investigate whether pairing taVNS with 
rehabilitation training of feeding behavior in preterm and HIE neonates will enhance and accelerate the 
learning of effective feeding behavior  in a dose responsive manner . We call this treatment “taVNS -
paired feeding.” The primary outcome measures  of taVNS- paired feeding will be daily oral milk feeding 
volume changes from before to during treatment, and number of infants reaching full oral feeds 
Page [ADDRESS_665892] Coker- Bolt’s Specific Test of Early infant motor Performance  
(STEP) . Our hypothesis is that t aVNS- paired feeding for preterm neonates  is feasible, saf e and 
effective at reducing length of stay solely for feeding reasons, compared to historical controls . As part of 
our safety investigations with separate funding , we may  perform taVNS during a clinical modified 
barium swallow study with pediatric speech langua ge pathologists performing the study and compare 
10 swallows with stimulation on and off to determine if taVNS affects swallowing parameters.  
 
Specific Aim  2: Brain Changes - We aim to determine if white matter fiber tracts show improved 
integrity as measured by [CONTACT_101203] (DKI) before , after a 2 -week treatment taVNS -paired feeding 
course, and whether treatment improve s neuronal energetics in the basal ganglia as measured by 
[CONTACT_156539] (MRS). Unsedated MRS and DKI imaging wi ll last approximately [ADDRESS_665893]  diffusion parameters  and N -acetylaspartate (NAA) and glutathione (GSH) 
concentration in the basal gangl ia and thalamus will be compared with published changes of these 
parameters over gestational age in preterm infant s (14, 15) and with our own MRS data in preterm and 
HIE infants who did not receive taVNS.  
We will perform DKI  to determine the effects of taVNS on plasticity, and to identify areas of the brain 
involved in afferent vagal activation.  We propose utilizing the concurrent taVNS/fMRI method 
developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Badran at MUSC to determine whether taVNS activates the CNS and afferent vagal 
network in a subset of preterm and term  infants in the study . 
 
B. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
 Traditional cervical VNS involves surgically implanting a stimulator into the left chest wall. Bipolar 
electrodes are then wrapped around the left vagus nerve in the neck with wires connected to these 
electrodes running inside the neck and connecting to th e stimulator. Cervical implanted VNS is FDA 
approved in patients with intractable epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] (5-8). Serendipi[INVESTIGATOR_513962], it was 
noticed there were associated mood impro vements  in implanted patients even in patients who had no 
seizure decrease  (16,17) . PET studies at the time also showed that VNS caused changes in mood 
regulating regions. These two pi[INVESTIGATOR_513963]. George to begin exploring VNS as a treatment 
for depression (18, 19)  and ultimately being approved for th e long-term treatment of chronic or 
recurrent depression. MUSC was the site of the first depressed patient ever implanted with cervical 
VNS.  Aside from the anti- epi[INVESTIGATOR_513964] , VNS has been studied 
extensively in animal mode ls, with applications ranging from attenuation of infla mmatory response  (20, 
21), increased survival rate in heart failure  (22), reduction of infarct size in cerebral ischemia  (23, 24) , 
motor rehabilitation after stroke  (25, 26, 27)  and tinnitus VNS (28, 31) . VNS  is an emerging area of 
interest in the neuroscience field and has many translatable applications . The ability to pair VNS with 
stimuli and motor behavior and promote learning and plasticity is the most germane aspect of VNS for 
this specific proposal.  
 The vagus nerve spans from the gut up to the nucleus track solitaris (NTS) of the brainstem. From 
there,  projections span to many different regions of the brain, each with its own resulting effect. A small 
branch of the vagus nerve, known as the auricular branch , innervates the ear. This branch also has 
afferent projections to the brain and may elicit simila r effects when stimulated as does traditional 
Page 5 of 23 
 
 
 cervical vagus stimulation in the neck.  The concept of transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation 
(taVNS) as a noninvasive alternative to the conventional implantable VNS is relatively new and was first 
developed in 2000  (2). Since then , there have been several groups that have conducted studies on this 
novel form of neuromodulation (4,9,10).  
 
At MUSC, [CONTACT_514022] and the brain stimulation division have conducted three focused studies 
examining the safety, feasibility, and effectiveness of taVNS in adults. They found that during taVNS, 
participants showed minor but statistically significant immediate heart rate decreases followed by a 
modest sympathetic rebound upon termination of stimulation. The group developed and conducted a 
concurrent taVNS/fMRI trial to determine the  neurobiological effect of taVNS. Findings from the 
taVNS/fMRI trial demonstrated that the neurobiological effect of taVNS mimics that of cervically 
implanted VNS and targets several cortical and subcortical vagus afferent pathway targets. It 
additionally suggested  that taVNS for short time periods activates the vagus nerve  (10-25Hz, average 
1.8mA) . The group saw no minor or major adverse  events during the treatment sessions and no  
spontaneously reported event following termination of the trial. No rapi[INVESTIGATOR_513965] -minute taVNS stimul ation periods. Minor, temporary, and light 
redness was  seen at the sight of stimulation but disappeared within five  minutes of stimulation 
completion. A follow -up study determined that the optimal parameter to modulate the parasympathetic 
response activated via taVNS  was 500μs  pulse width , 10Hz for 60s durati on (10). 
 
VNS has been shown to rescue the brain if stimulation begins immediately after trauma, such as 
immediately after strokes. Rats that received vagal stimulation immediately after focal cerebral 
ischemia had not only significantly better neurological scores compared to non- VNS rats, but these rats 
also had significantly smaller infracts  (24). A large group out of Dallas, TX has conducted extensive 
research on the effects of VNS in both animal and human models. In treating tinnitus, the gro up tested 
VNS, tones, and paired VNS -tones (4, 28) . When VNS alone was delivered to the rats in a tinnitus 
model, there was no decrease in tinnitus symptoms . When tones were delivered alone there were no 
reductions. This suggests there is a synergistic eff ect of VNS when combined with a paired stimulus 
that is directing plastic changes to occur in the cortex. This concept is called “targeted plasticity”  (2,3,4) 
or use-  or state -dependent plasticity, in which various cortical targets can be selectively chang ed 
depending on the paired stimulus. This group is exploring VNS induced targeted plasticity as a 
treatment for other neurological disorders in animal models involving cortical reorganization, including 
stroke (25, 26) and have successfully moved into human clinical trials for both these treatments . Most 
notably, this pairing of VNS and rehabilitation paradigms has been shown to restore motor behavior in 
stroke . It is conceivable that these targeted plasticity findings can be seen with taVNS , without the cost 
or risk of surgical implantation. 
 
If we can use taVNS rather than implanted VNS, the prior wealth of promising research can potentially be translated to mor e fragile patients noninvasively . While surgical implantation VNS has produced a 
large body of positive results, it would be far more cost effective and easier to conduct VNS noninvasively. In looking to the future of VNS, noninvasive taVNS poses significa nt applications in 
populations such as preterm neonates , who  are too unstable to undergo surgery  and might benefit from 
VNS for a specific motor task of  feeding.  This population represents an ideal group for testing this novel 
use of taVNS.  To ingest milk properly and efficiently, neonates must have the neural integration  to 
coordinate  the complex sequence of sucking, swallowing, and breathing. This sensorimotor sequence 
Page [ADDRESS_665894] the developmental 
trajectory of many neural circuits, including the vagal circuit. Abnormal development of the vagus is 
reflected in myelination of the vagus, interneuronal connections in the brainstem that form the face -
heart connection, and/or corticobulbar regulation of the brainstem circuits regulating both vagal activity 
and the striated muscles of the face, head, and neck. The consequences in typi[INVESTIGATOR_513966]  (Respi[INVESTIGATOR_25570]) due 
to lower vagal tone  and brainstem immaturity  (11). RSA has been associated with poor behavioral state 
regulation common in preterm or HIE infants, and too little or too much autonomic  reactivity (37). Such 
reactivity and neural immaturity make coordinating and learning a complex motor task even more 
difficult, explaining why the feeding mechanism must be taught  through OT rehabilitation , when it 
should be a normal reflex . Interestingly, the RSA also a ssociates with behavioral reactivity problems in 
older  children, conditions for which both preterm and HIE infants are at increased risk , and vagal 
regulation deficits are reported in adult psychiatric disorders ( 38).  
 
Although postnatally the developi[INVESTIGATOR_513967] , and thus would be 
expected to have better recovery mechanisms following injury, the immature or injured neonatal brain 
has some of the worst developmental outcomes following significant insult . Injury, oftentimes occurring 
in the difficult labor associated with preterm birth and conditions associated with  HIE, trigger excessive 
stimulation of particular inflammatory pathways normally involved in shapi[INVESTIGATOR_513968] . In the immature bra in outgrowth of neural projections resulting from injury actually generate 
abnormal connections and circuitry as well as a paucity of myelinating cells and inter -neurons that 
subsequently lead to motor and cognitive impairment . Around the time of birth, the cortex and basal 
ganglia undergo significant integrative connectivity  associated with shapi[INVESTIGATOR_513969]. 
A HI or other injury event around this time interrupts these processes and can affect normal 
development al plasticity through altering neurotransmission and changes in cellular signaling  leading to 
abnormal connectivity (13).  
 
The data in both animals and adult humans is convincing that VNS paired with motor trai ning improves 
motor functioning ( 2,3,4). A multisite, FDA -pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735], industry- sponsored trial of implantable cervical VNS 
to treat upper motor hemiplegia after stroke in adults is currently underway, built on this promising data. 
Activity dependent plasticity that is enhanced by [CONTACT_11662] , has become a common tenant of 
neuromodulatory research, but has not yet been translated to infants or neonates after global brain 
injury of prematurity or HIE. The justice of holding back investigational drugs and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_513970] w ho may benefit simply because they are children, has come into question the past 
years, as we clinicians have to acknowledge that virtually NONE of the treatments we use in infants 
have actually undergone testing or are FDA approved in the childhood populations routinely used. We 
have an obligation as pediatric clinical researchers to remedy this extreme discrepancy in innovative 
research in children .  
 
The data and safety supporting the study of non -invasive TENS in neonates  and young infants is 
represente d in studies that investigated TENS for specific purposes such as pain reduction or treatment 
of torticollis or brachial plexus injuries  (39-42). There were no adverse effects reported at various HZ 
Page 7 of 23 
 
 
 from 2- 10 and for 0.5 – [ADDRESS_665895] in neonates  to confirm cystic fibrosis,  supports its minimal risk designation  in neonates (43) . 
The investigators in these neonatal  and infant  studies as well as research conducted by [CONTACT_6283]. Badr an 
and George in adults at this institution, used the same frequency and intensity (10Hz, 0.5-5mA), and no 
painful or ill effects have been observed. Not only is TENS safe in all populations and is FDA cleared,  in 
the case of VNS, we already have substanti al evidence of dose response in adults  (Badran, George)  as 
well as efficacy and safety . The dosing parameters chosen in this study were found to be safe and have 
positive brain imaging results.  
 
The purpose of this study is primarily to determine feasibility of the  proposed taVNS dose and duration 
with a paired feeding,  that has  minimal negative effects  and confers  positive  functional and CNS 
structural benefits. As this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we do not know the exact intensity  of the stimulus  that our 
infants will perceive. We have built in a dose determination during rest and during feeding for 
perceptual threshold. We also have an immediate reduction built in for safety if it causes discomfort, 
and we have planned for a gradual increase in the duration of treatment over the first feeding sessions 
to determine the tolerability. We have included  the protocol for the perceptual threshold determination 
for clarification.  
 We hope to verify that the protocol  for delivering taVNS- paired feeding will effectively align with regular , 
pre-existing OT rehabilitation performed  in nearly all pre-term neonates , and that taVNS -paired feeding 
improves their ability to feed. We anticipate t hat taVNS- paired feeding treatment s can be conducted in 
a feasible, time and cost effective manner.  Our secondary purpose is to understand with brain imaging 
how taVNS may improve the CNS circuitry and metabolism , which correlates with the specific early 
motor task of learning to feed . As l ong term developmental data is always important in studies of 
infants, we will also look at preliminary data to see  if this effect can be linked to long- term functional 
ability.  
 
Diffusion MRI (dMRI) may determine effects of taVNS on plasticity . 
Rapid changes in diffusion have been noted with electrical stimulation accompanied by a 20 -45% 
increase in extracellular water in animals and human volunteers (3-5). On a cellular level, the diffusion 
changes are believed  to indicate increased Na+/K+ATPase activity (6), and ionic and water movement 
through neuronal and glial membranes (5). These diffusion changes in white matter (WM) tracts have 
been proposed as an alternative to BOLD  fMRI(3), and may be particularly applicable to measuring 
direct changes after taVNS in this neonatal and infant population after global HI brain injury. In addition, 
we will use DKI which is more sensitive in neonates and infants , who generally have lower FA and 
higher kurtosis values. This is a novel application of DKI  as an indication of vagal -mediated central 
effects induced by [CONTACT_513993].  
 
This research proposal will further develop a noninvasive vagus nerve stimulation as an assistive tool in 
the rehabilitation of neonates born with feeding deficits. We will confirm the safety of this new technique using fluoroscopic imaging as well as its effect on brain plasticity using advanced structural and 
functional neuroimaging.  
We hypothesi ze, based on the  paired VNS studies in animals and humans to date as well as human 
noninvasive VNS  studies conducted here at MUSC , that t aVNS- paired feeding in pre -term neonates will 
feasible, safe  and not worsen swallowing problems and perhaps improve them . Additionally, we 
hypothesize that ta -VNS- paired feeding will accelerate pre -term neonates’ ability to learn feeding

management and treatment of hypoxic ischemic and neuroinflammatory  diseases in neonates. She 
conducted a phase II multicenter randomized controlled trial of  hypothermia to treat hypoxic -ischemic 
encephalopathy (HIE) in neonates . She developed other neuroprotective treatments in animal models, 
which she is currently translating to critically ill neonates with HIE undergoing hypothermia treatment in 
conjunction with N -acetylcysteine (NAC) and Vitamin D. In this IRB approved study (HR#312 54), she is 
using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to quantify participant s’ GSH levels  before and after 
NAC and Vitamin D , using glutathione as a biomarker for oxidative stress and NAC pharmacodynamic 
CNS effect. The hope is that improving oxidative stress in neonates with HIE will improve neuronal 
growth and development. She has also safely performed other cutting edge studies using NAC maternal chorioamnionitis  to cross the placenta and protect the fetal brain before delivery (HR#[ZIP_CODE]). 
She is well suited to conduct these studies safely in infants.

 D. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS (including data analysis)  
Due to the novelty of these studies,  [CONTACT_514023]  will be present for each taVNS -paired feeding 
session conducted in the first  participant s, and as needed thereafter . [CONTACT_514024] and or [CONTACT_514025] will 
monitor taVNS effects. If any adverse events are noticed which are not described in the consent or are 
serious , we will inform the IRB before continuing with the next enrolled subject . Importantly, all of these

Study Design  
 Up to 40 preterm /HIE neonates will be enrolled in this prospective, open -label safety and feasibility trial, 
with a dose response . The experimental paradigm consists of [ADDRESS_665900] 5 
years. We can compare our data to this historical group  at our own institution.  
 All consented participants will receive the active stimulation condition.   
 
taVNS Stimulation (in Detail) 
 
After obtaining consent and describing this procedure to the parents and all members of the baby’s 
care team, w e will first, with a 500μs, 25Hz pulse, gradually increase the intensity of the TENS unit until 
the baby [CONTACT_513996]. We will use the facial expression change  and fidgety 
movements to determine when the infants feel the stimulation. This intensity will be recorded as the 
perceptual sensory threshold. The stimulation intensity we will use for this study on taVNS -paired 
feeding is a small decrement from the perceptual sensory threshold  for each infant ( -0.1mA) , a point at 
which they should not react to the stimulation . We will retest  the sensory threshold before every 
session.   
Determination of Perceptual Threshold 
1. Electrode clip will be placed on the left tragus in an enrolled infant at rest. Starting at 0.2mA at 
25Hz , we will deliver 5 seconds of pulses, and increase by 0.1mA until the perceptual threshold 
is achieved by [CONTACT_513997]’s facial expressio n, fidgety movements, or NIPPS score. 
This will be termed the perceptual threshold.  
2. We will then deliver this level of microcurrent while the infant is feeding on the first day to 
determine if the perceptual threshold changes with feeding. Current will then be held constant 
while pulse width and frequency will be set at 500us and 25Hz , respectively.  
Page 11 of 23 
 
 
 3. Finally, we will decrease the microcurrent by 0.1mA below the perceptual threshold and 
administer this taVNS treatment during the feeding and deliver this only  while the infant is 
actively sucking from the bottle.  
4. The total duration of this ‘on -and-off’ taVNS stimulation treatment will continue for  [ADDRESS_665901], stimulation will be triggered and a timer will be 
started. Sometimes the infant has non -nutritive sucking and it is difficult for the operator to discern 
between these lip motions and real suck/swallow.  We wish to stimulate during sucking motions that 
include swallowing but may occasionally pair with ineffective and incomplete lip sucking, characteristic 
of more immature patterns. We may use manual triggering by a research assistant or triggering by  [CONTACT_513998]/swallowing.  
 The stimulation will continue until the baby [CONTACT_513999], at which point the stimulation will be stopped 
and the timer will stop , until the baby [CONTACT_514000] . The typi[INVESTIGATOR_513977] 
30 minutes. Physiological data will be monitored continuously as measured by [CONTACT_514001] 
(ECG). Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS)  data will be collected at beginning, middle and the end of 
treatment session. The NIPS rating scale currently in use in the nursery is included in this submission. 
These studies will be conducted in both level II and III Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs), 
depending  on the location and of the enrolled participants.  
 
taVNS Device  
 
tVNS will be delivered to the left ear only  using an active (tragus) location for the taVNS clip using 
either the  Digitimer Type DS7AH (Digitimer  Ltd, Hertfordshire, England) or Soterix 0125- LTE stimulator 
customized for our infant trials. Both are TENS units and are  cleared by [CONTACT_514002] (See uploaded documents from Soterix) . We also recently received FDA 
Breakthrough device designation for our Baby[CONTACT_514003], based on a 
customized 0125 -LTE Soterix taVNS unit. TENS units are  widely used in children with overactive 
bladder and dysfunctional voiding  and stooling (44-45) and for analgesia in children, and as a treatment 
for chro nic pain,  including c ancer (46). A custom electrode, embedded within a carbon  matrix  will be 
used to stimulate the auricular branch of the vagal nerve at the tragus . We will then trigger the  taVNS 
unit to deliver the microcurrent or to stop the microcurrent when the infant is actively sucking and 
swallowing.  
 
Safety Monitoring    
 
Prior to determination of the daily sensory threshold of the infant, an initial pain level will be recorded 
using the NIPS. Previous studies using pain as a marker for safety in neonates check for pain halfway 
through the respective treatment ( 39-40). T ENS t reatments in studies examined in creating ou r protocol

 typi[INVESTIGATOR_34604] 30 minutes  (41-43). Because the duration of the taVNS -paired feeding varies daily and 
will ultimately  exceed [ADDRESS_665902] examined for redness prior to attaching the taVNS device  However, if there is skin 
redness  at the site attachment to the ear  prior to each day’s treatment, we will switch the stimulation that 
day to the right ear.  If these symptoms are persistent , we will decrease the stimulation .   
 
ECG will be monitored during each treatment session. The  HR measures will provide valuable data for 
safety analysis as well as immediate markers for physiological safety during taVNS -paired feeding. 
Bradycardia will be defined by [CONTACT_514004] <80bpm for [ADDRESS_665903] of care 
developmental testing , and i f more convenient for parents, the developmental testing will be performed 
by [CONTACT_6283]. Coker -bolt and/or Aljuhani in the home or other location of the parent's choosing.  Development al 
testing in the home will be free of charge, and test information will be discussed with parents during the 
testing session and then uploaded into EPIC for other care providers.  
 Payment 
 No payment will be provided in this trial.  
 Data Analysis  
 
For safety we will compare HR changes from baseline to during taVNS within subjects. We will 
compare treatment before and after  the taVNS -paired feeding treatment for the  rate of feeding volume 
increase , and days to full po feeds.  We will use repeated measures ANOVA to analyze repeated 
measures such as HR over [ADDRESS_665904] been fitted to several differ ent weights of infants (2.5 -4.0 kg).  
 
Limitations.  We will not be delivering a SHAM stimulation paradigm  (electrodes and Digitizer with 
appearance of taVNs treatment without actual current) . Our goal is to determine safety and feasibility of 
active treatment with a dose response in order to investigate whether this should be administered in a 
larger randomized control trial . In this respect, the comparison we lose in not having a SHAM 
stimul ation is offset by [CONTACT_514005]. We 
will compare our overall results with characteristics of infants who required a Gtube from [CONTACT_514026] 
and Ryan’s publications.  
 Estimated Time Frames . The duration of the study will likely be ~[ADDRESS_665905] 
pressure (CPAP) device or other form of high respi[INVESTIGATOR_513978].

c.  Potential Risks  
 taVNS has been conducted in individuals under the age of [ADDRESS_665906] infant feeding with OT, speech or nurses.  
 
Potential Risks of t aVNS 
taVNS is transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) of the auricular branch of the vagus nerve  
(ABVN)  that innervates the ear. Although this novel therapeutic modality is still in the development and 
optimization process, risks are a combination of those to be expected by [CONTACT_514006].  
TENS devices are FDA a pproved for pain relief and are available over the counter. The main risks 
associated with TENS are electrical hazards that may result in user discomfort or injury. The unit used 
Page 15 of 23 
 
 
 in these studies (Digitimer DS7AH) is a 510(k) cleared electrical stimulator that meets the rigorous 
electrical standards of the FDA. The Soterix© taVNS unit has been customized for our infants with a 
maximum current delivery of 2 mA and automatic shut -off after 120 seconds (See uploaded documents 
and letter from Soterix). The cust omized Soterix unit will be used in our Baby[CONTACT_514007] 12/8/2020. Skin irritation, redness, or 
inflammation may occur under the stimulating electrodes if TENS current is delivered for a pro longed 
period of time.  
Two studies have used TENS on neonates  to try to prevent or mitigate painful procedures  (39-40). The 
TENS was administered at acupuncture sites with increasing current f rom 1- 3.5 mA, and Hz from 2 -10 
in 30 healthy infants <3 day s old. (39)  In a subsequent study, this investigative team randomized 162 
term neonates to TENS (3.5mA, 10Hz) or usual care to prevent pain from lancet heelsticks for blood 
sampling (40). These TENS parameters were safe and did not cause discomfort in the neonates.  
TENs has also been used with passive stretching in neonatal torticollis at 8Hz, 0.2mA for 30 minutes 
continuously  (41) and in brachial plexus nerve injuries starting at 6 weeks of age  to improve motor 
function of the hand , in conjunction with  constraint induced movement therapy (42) . Neither study 
reported adverse effects of electrical stimulation.  TENS has als o been used in peroneal and sacral 
nerve stimulation for dysfunctional voiding and stooling (44- 45). Finally , the routine sweat test 
employed in newborns and infants to confirm the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis uses transcutaneous 
electrical stimulation  to deliver pi[INVESTIGATOR_513980]  (43). From the product brochure of the 
Nanoduct™ Neonatal Sweat Analysis System (Discovery Diagnostics, Canada), the n ominal current is 
0.5 (± 0.02) mA up to 5 mA for 2.5 minutes (± 0.2 Sec.).  
Implantable cervical VNS is FDA approved for the treatment of treatment resistant depression  and 
intractable epi[INVESTIGATOR_513981] 8 months (4 7-49). Cervical VNS has risks associated with 
the procedure of implanting the nerve, and the surgery. None of those apply here. VNS does  have 
some minimal risks that  are due to the actual stimulation of the nerve within the neck  such as skin 
irritation. tVNS also has associated risks that may arise from  the direct  brain effects stimulating the 
vagus nerve. These  theoretical risks associated with neuromodulation of the parasympathetic nervous 
system  would also be applicable in the administration of noninvasive tVNS. They are the following: 
reduction of heart rate, blood pressure, and vasovagal syncope.  
There have been dozens of studies in which tVNS has been used on hum ans, none of them reporting 
adverse events. A simple PubM ed search for “transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation” shows [ADDRESS_665907]  
recent publications  on PubMed involving  tVNS on the auricular branch of the vagus  in humans :

An extremely through review of all tVNS literature has been performed and no harm or adverse events 
have been observed and any side effects were resolved by [CONTACT_101225]. There also is 
currently a commercial tVNS  device available for purchase on the European market (Cerbomed - 
Nemos device; www.cerbomed.com) that is marketed as a take- home treatment for epi[INVESTIGATOR_002].   
Not only does the current literature show a lack of harm done by [CONTACT_101226], implantable cervical VNS also has a good safety record. According to Cyberonics, the company that supplies the cervical VNS 
implantable devices, there has been over 100,[ADDRESS_665908] been made on hundreds of VNS 
patients with no changes in cardiac function (Handforth et al, 1998; Sackeim et al, 2001b; Morris and Mueller, 1999)  with long -term safet y confirmed in recent large sample retrospective studies (Menascu 
et al, 2013; Ryvlin et al, 2014; Choi et al, 2013 ).  
Bradycardia: [CONTACT_101228]’s own safety studies in adults and this pi[INVESTIGATOR_513982] a small, 
measurable change in heart rate which is not clinically significant ( -3 and+6 bpm). G iven the minimal 
risk of both of these already FDA approved methods, we intend to show that taVNS will continue to be 
a very safe procedure in neonates .  
 2.  ADEQUACY OF PROTECTION AGAINST RISKS  
 a.  Recruitment and Informed Consent  
 
This information is listed on the eIRB website.  
 b.  Protection against Risk 
 
The following risks are present with this study: R isk of skin irritation, risk of discomfort, risk of slightly 
decreased heart rate, and risk of loss of confidentiality . 
Page 17 of 23 
 
 
 Risk of skin irritation: we will monitor the skin on the inner aspect of the left ear before and after each 
session, and will switch to the right ear if redness is present, and decrease the stimulation if redness 
persists.  
 Risk of discomfort: We expect to be able to use the pain ratings scales to identify the perception of 
tingling versus pain with taVNS in these infants. We will use faci al expression change, fidgety 
movements and infant behavioral discomfort using our standard neonatal pain scale (NIPS) with the 
bedside nurse at the start and after [ADDRESS_665909] the risk of discomfort by [CONTACT_514008].  
 
We will hold the treatment for a NIPS score of >3, until discomfort subsides, and resume at a lower 
stimulus level if this level of  discomfort recurs. We do not expect the infant to cry at this level, but show 
discomfort  in brow furrowing, grimace, etc.  Feeding is generally comforting for infants, and we expect 
to see minimal pain response to treatment. Infants are fed sidelying in t he nursery. We will position the 
baby [CONTACT_514009], and we can monitor the site and pain without disturbing the feeding process unduly.  
 
Risk of slightly dec reased heart rate: we wi ll monitor HR, respi[INVESTIGATOR_513983] -paired feeding. The 
infants’ vital signs are constantly monitored as standard of care while in the nursery. We will print out 
values at baseline, and changes with feeding and taVNS -paired feeding. Normal heart rate is [ADDRESS_665910] significant bradycardic HR changes  during 
the ‘on’  pulse. However, if the HR decreases to <100bpm  during ‘on’ pulse , or if HR rebound is > 
190bpm during ‘off’ pulse, we will hold treatment and start again at a lower stimulation level.   
 
Risk of loss of confidentiality: We will assign study n umbers to each participant, keep CRF and consent 
forms in locked cabinets in locked offices. Database files with names and contact [CONTACT_514010]. All other data files related to this study will be identified by [CONTACT_61212], without link to standard identifiers. We will publish the 
aggregate data only. MRI files are stored by [CONTACT_514011].  
 
3.  POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH TO THE SUBJECTS  AND OTHERS  
 
taVNS paired with oromotor feeding training may enhance feeding skills, and  enable the infants to learn 
this task more quickly and be discharged from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_513984]. The treatment could potentially help avoid placement of a G -tube, but we will not be able to determine this from this dose -finding study. The 
treatment may also hel p with development of other motor skills, which we will assess by 
[CONTACT_514012]. We may also discover that taVNS -paired feed improves swallowing function, 
but even if we do not show any change in swallowing function, this data will support the safety of taVNS 
in neonates and infants.  However, there may be no direct benefit to the participant, but we will gain 
knowledge about taVNS in infants, and strategies to improve oromotor skill training.  
 
4.  IMPORTANCE OF THE KNOWLEDGE TO BE GAINED  
Page 18 of 23 
 
 
  
This trial c ould demonstrate the concept of “targeted plasticity” that could be used to enhance deficient 
networks in the preterm neonatal central nervous system. Behaviors integral to development such as 
feeding are impaired in this cohort , and if we can accelerate the learning of this behavior,  we would 
greatly impact the recovery times and growth abilities of preterm or injured neonates. A positive connection between taVNS and learned motor function at such a critical time of development would 
contribute  significantly to the field of neuronal plasticity  and learned behaviors in neonates.  
If taVNS is shown to improve swallowing function, then this research may open up an entirely new 
treatment modality for these and other patients, such as post -stroke pati ents, who have swallowing 
problems.  
 
5.  SUBJECT SAFETY AND MINIMIZING RISKS (Data and Safety Monitoring Plan)  
 
Introduction  
The participants who receive active taVNS involved with this proposal will be neonates whose 
participation is agreed to by [CONTACT_514013] . The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_513985]. She will also execute the Data Safety 
Management (DSM) plan and provide any necessary progress reports to the IRB, inc luding but not limited 
to subject demographics, recruitment rates, retention rates, quality assurance issues, and adverse events 
or significant adverse events.  
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
[CONTACT_101230] or her designee , should she be unavailable, will be  responsible for reporting all unanticipated 
problems or AEs to the IRB.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_513986]'s real time.  [CONTACT_95052] 
will be responsible for reporting any unanticipated device -related AE's to FDA.  All screening data will be 
kept in a binder in the locked office in [CONTACT_514027] office.  Screening data collected from participants who 
do not qualify for the study will be securely destroyed.  
[CONTACT_101231], who is a board certified neurologist and psychi atrist , and [CONTACT_514025] will oversee the 
use of taVNS.  [CONTACT_101230] will also personally attend the sessions to monitor safety and adverse 
events.  
An independent Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will be formed to advise the study investigators. 
The SMC will review and evaluate accumulated study data to ensure safety. They also will make 
recommendations concerning continuation, modification, or termination of any of the taVNS studies. It 
will be composed of [CONTACT_514028], neonatologist; [CONTACT_101234] , MUSC associate professor 
and assistant provost with extensive VNS, TMS, and tDCS experience.  Patty Coker -Bolt, OT PhD, 
infant feeding expert , will be available to discuss subjective and objective measures of infant response 
during the taVNS experiments. Paige Merrill, clinical OT and infant feeding expert, is not involved with 
the study, but will be giving many of the feeds during the tVNS sessions, and may also be called upon for impressions of safety and infant response, if the safety committee requires  it. 
Data will be discussed after the first five infants, and then again after 10 infants. The SMC will be 
notified immediately of any and all SAE's.  We will report to the IRB the number of treatments held for 
Page [ADDRESS_665911]. Jenkins will obtain  informed consent, during which participants’  guardians are fully advised on the 
research procedures to be used, the amount of time required of them, the possible risks and benefits of 
the procedures, their right to refuse their infant’s partici pation in the study without prejudice, their right 
to terminate participation of their infant at any moment without prejudice, and the name [CONTACT_514020].  
Electronic Consent will be used for situations when the parent (or Legally Authorized Representative) is 
at another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_513976]. We will use the approved REDcap system to obtain consent. [CONTACT_101230] or other approved study personnel will go over the 
entire consent do cument on the phone with the parent to ensure comprehension and to confirm identity. 
Parent will be given a copy of the completed, signed consent form in person or by [CONTACT_71345].  
Legal guardians will give informed  consent. However, the Department of Social services may have 
custody of infant, but require the parent or foster parent to consent for all medical procedures.  
Regarding confidentiality, subjects ’ guardians are informed th at the information they provide , as well as 
participation in the study,  will be kept strictly confidential, with access limited to the research staff. All 
paper records  (consents, CRFs, study tools) will be kept in [CONTACT_514027]’ locked offic e, in a locked 
cabinet. The identity of subjects in databases will be protected with alphanumeric codes. All data will be 
kept in locked file cabinets or on secure servers designed for use and access by [CONTACT_514014].  
*Clinical Trials  
Unless required by a funding agency, t his study will not be registered on clinicaltrials.gov, as it will be 
considered a Phase 0 trial, used for assuring safety and feasibility of the taVNS -paired feeding 
treatment. The potential for intellectual property development and patent application by [CONTACT_514015].

These studies will be conducted in the NICUs, clinical units on the 5th floor of Shawn Jenkins 
Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The portable taVNS devise will be brought to the nursery room  for each taVNS 
session. The Brain Stimulation Lab (BSL) is a series of labs an d offices (>3000 square feet) primarily 
located on the 5th floor of the Institute of Psychiatry (IOP). BSL studies use electromagnetic 
approaches as  either research tools investigating neuroscience questions or as investigational or 
FDA  approved treatments for brain diseases. Techniques actively being used by [CONTACT_514019] 23 of 23 
 
 
 their collaborators include: transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), 
transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), electroconvul sive therapy (ECT), deep brain stimulation 
(DBS) and epi[INVESTIGATOR_411271] (epCS). ECT, VNS and TMS are clinical services offered within 
the BSL. BSL researchers at MUSC were the first in the world (in 1998) to implant VNS devices in 
patients with major depression who had not adequately responded to traditional antidepressants.

 A Phase II trial in Human Papi[INVESTIGATOR_374055] (HPV) – positive head and 
neck cancer as determined by [CONTACT_374092], or p16 
immunohistochemistry with confirmatory ISH or PCR in oropharyngeal primary tumors 
(see Section 4.4 HPV testing) to determine response to induction chemotherapy based 
on 
clinical, radiologic and surgical criteria.   Patients will undergo evaluation by a 
multidisciplinary team prior to risk assessment.  The patients will be assigned to high 
and low risk groups based on tumor size, lymph node involvement, and smoking history.  
Patients will be assigned treatment with radiation with or without chemotherapy 
following induction chemotherapy with carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel based on RECIST 
measurement of tumor shrinkage.  Patients with low risk disease (T1-3,non-bulky N0-
N2B, < 10 pack years tobacco- see Study Rationale section 3.3) (1) who have > 50% 
reduction by [CONTACT_374093] A) de-intensified 
treatment with radiation alone  to 50 Gy.  Patients with low risk features and with  < 
50% but > 30% reduction OR high risk features with > 50% reduction will receive B) de-
intensified chemoradiation with TFHX to 45 Gy (3 cycles) .  Patients who have high risk 
disease with < 50% reduction or any patients with progression or stable disease during 
induction chemotherapy will undergo C) chemoradiotherapy with TFHX to 75 Gy (or 
Cisplatin based CRT as a fallback option in case TFHX is not feasible (see section 5.5).   
 
Background and Rationale 
 
 HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer is associated with improved prognosis 
compared to HPV-negative squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCCs). 
Notably, patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers with a [ADDRESS_468375] a greater than 80% 5 year overall survival . (2)These improved 
outcomes have suggested that toxic multimodality treatment regimens may be de-
intensified in order to prolong survival while minimizing toxicity.   Previous studies have 
suggested that response to induction chemotherapy is a highly reliable prognostic factor 
for outcome following definitive treatment.  This was also recently demonstrated in 
ECOG1308, which showed promising results.  The problem is however, that not all HPV 
positive patients have good outcomes.  While there are some reliable factors, which are 
associated with outcome, there are some factors, which remain unclear, and patients 
should warrant more intensified treatment to reduce likelihood of recurrence.  Therefore, 
this trial will prospectively analyze response to induction chemotherapy in individual pts 
(grouped at study enrollment into high and low risk groups based on tumor 
characteristics) to determine who should have deintensified treatment (allocation to 
three arms – see schema above) .   
 
Patient Population 
 
 Patients with locally advanced squamous cell cancer of the  head and neck area  
that are positive for HPV  using an E6/E7 based assay is preferred  (by [CONTACT_374094] , see section 4.4 ) will be enrolled.  For oropharyngeal HNSCC p16 IHC positiv itivity  
is acceptable  (with recommended validation  by [CONTACT_374095] , see section 4.4 ). The goals of this study are to diminish long -term

Treatment Plan:  
 
 Induction therapy : All enrolled patients will receive three (3) 21 -day cycles  of 
chemotherapy consisting of nab -paclitaxel (100 mg/m2 on day 1, 8, 15), and carboplatin 
(AUC 6 on day 1 ). Growth factor support will be provided using G -CSF administered on  
days 16 -18). Following induction patients will undergo biopsy if technically feasible.  
Surgery should not be done  at this point, unless diagnostic in intent and residual tumor 
is left behind.  
 
Surgery/ pan-endoscopy and biopsies : Following chemoradiotherapy, patients will 
undergo surgical evaluation, and pathologic response evaluation will be considered. 
This may include either surgery or (e.g. TORS is acceptable). Particular focus will be on 
the first 50% of patients in groups A and B. 
 
 
Radiation/C

Statistical analysis 
Patients will receive induction chemotherapy for three cycles followed by [CONTACT_374100], and response-based allocation to RT/CRT treatment arms.  
Response will be assessed after completion of induction chemotherapy by 
[CONTACT_2085] (per the ENT surgeon), and radiological examination.  
We expect to enroll 3-[ADDRESS_468378] to activate ~2 additional sites to 
allow rapid enrollment.  
Overall Primary Objective : Non -inferiority compared to HPV(+) patients treated with 
carboplatin, paclitaxel, cetuximab on the  #[ZIP_CODE] protocol (EPIC -HN trial)  
• We will employ a non-inferiority test in which the objective is to establish that the 
2-year PFS rate for an overall treatment regimen that uses induction 
chemotherapy with nab-paclitaxel/carboplatin, is within an acceptable margin of 
that for carboplatin, paclitaxel, and cetuximab as part of the EPIC HN trial (2-year 
PFS=85%) as well as the efficacy goal for 2-year PFS in the ECOG 1308 study 
(85%).  Therefore we assume the true 2-year PFS rate is 85%, and set the non-
inferiority margin at 11%, corresponding to 2-year PFS rate for carboplatin, nab-
paclitaxel of at least 74%.    We will test H 0: Δ<-11% vs. H A: Δ>=- 11%.   
 
• Using Power Analysis and Sample Size (PASS v11) software, a sample of 61 
patients will provide 80% power to test this hypothesis using a (one-sided) type I 
error rate of 0.10. Essentially, H 0 will be rejected and nab-Paclitaxel/Carboplatin 
based therapy declared not materially inferior to EPIC/E1308 comparators if the 
lower, one-sided 90% confidence limit for the 2-year PFS rate exceeds 74% 
(which will occur if [ADDRESS_468379] 82%).  (This calculation 
assumes that the true PFS rate for nab-paclitaxel is 85% and that all patients will 
be followed for a minimum of 2 years.) If dropouts occur, the PFS rate will be 
estimated using the Kaplan-Meier procedure and its standard error via 
Greenwood’s formula, with corresponding (large-sample) confidence limit.  No 
interim analysis will be conducted.

3.1 Locally Advanced Head and Neck Cancer 
 
Approximately 50,000 new cases of head and neck cancer are diagnosed annually 
in the [LOCATION_002] (3). The majority (90-95%) of these cases are squamous cell 
carcinomas of the head and neck (HNSCC) and approximately two-thirds are 
locoregionally advanced cancers (AJCC Stage III-IV) (4). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_374056] (LA-HNSCC) over the past 
two decades, these patients still experience significant morbidity and mortality. 
 
Historically, locoregionally advanced tumors wer e treated with surgery, radiation 
therapy, or both. Locoregional failure rates were approximately 30% at 2 years and 
locoregional failures accounted for nearly 60% of failures. Survival at 5 years was 
reported to be only 40% (10–30% for patients with stage IVa and IVb tumors). 
Approximately 20% of patients developed metastatic disease and nearly one-fifth of 
these patients died of distant metastases without evidence of locoregional recurrence 
(5-8). 
 
 
 
3.1.1Chemoradiotherapy  
 
Given discouraging outcomes with surgery and radiation, investigators became 
increasingly interested in the incorporation of chemotherapy for the treatment of LA-
HNSCC. The feasibility of a non-surgical, organ preservation approach with concomitant 
chemoradiation was first established by [CONTACT_374103] (9, 10). Since then, several randomized trials and meta-analyses have 
demonstrated improved disease-free and/or overall survival with concomitant 
chemoradiotherapy and confirmed its role as standard therapy for patients with 
locoregionally advanced unresectable disease (11- 16). The positive effects on disease-
free and overall survival seem to be predominantly mediated through improved 
locoregional control, thus affecting the traditionally predominant pattern of failure for this 
disease. 
 
Concurrent chemoradiotherapy attempts to capi[INVESTIGATOR_374057]. However, 
sensitizing effects are not tumor specific and exert both locoregional effects on adjacent 
normal tissues within the radiation field as well as systemic effects, particularly on the 
bone marrow and peripheral nervous system. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy trials have 
consistently reported an increased incidence of acute grade [ADDRESS_468381] prominent (4).This rise creates 
concern about chronic toxic effects, including consequential late effects, which evolve 
from persistent severe acute toxic effects.  
 
13 
Version Date: 05/20/2014;08/13/2014, 02/09/2015, 04/09/2015, 07/01/2015,01/04/2016, 05/18/2016 (PI-change) Optimizing the therapeutic ratio of treatment benefit to toxicity has thus become a 
focus of recent investigation. Advances in the delivery of conformal radiation, including 
the development of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), have allowed 
significant improvements in sparing normal tissue structure s.  This is best exemplified 
by [CONTACT_374104] (17). However, 
other treatment-related morbidities such as dysphagia are still problematic; indeed, 2-
year rates of feeding tube dependence have been reported as high as 50% (18- 20). 
This is particularly significant given recent data that quality of life among patients with 
HNSCC treated with radiotherapy is substantially affected by [CONTACT_374105] (21). Efforts are now focused on decreasing 
the dose of radiation to dysphagia-related structures, particularly the pharyngeal 
constrictors, which are prone to stricture formation with doses ≥50 Gy (22) .  
 
3.1.[ADDRESS_468382] investigated multiple intensive concomitant 
chemoradiotherapy regimens. We initially studied the interaction of 5-FU, hydroxyurea 
and radiotherapy (FHX) (23, 24). Both chemotherapy agents have known systemic 
activity and have been shown to act as radiation enhancers in vitro and in vivo (6, 25, 
26). Cytotoxic activity is synergistic as hydroxyurea modulates the activity of 5-FU by 
[CONTACT_374106] (dUMP) and facilitating binding 
of the 5-FU metabolite 5-FdUMP to its target enzyme thymidylate synthase (27). 
Paclitaxel was subsequently added to the FHX regimen (TFHX) and the radiation 
scheme changed to twice daily to further intensify the treatment (28- 32).  
 
The TFHX regimen was demonstrated to be a highly active and tolerable 
concomitant chemotherapy and hyperfractionated radiation regimen: overall survival 
and locoregional control rates at 3 years were 60% and 86%, respectively (30, 32) . 
Since surgery was used primarily as a salvage procedure, excellent organ preservation 
was also achieved. Acute toxicities were severe in a majority of patients but were 
considered tolerable overall. Mucositis (84% grade 3/4), “in-field” dermatitis (38% grade 
3/4), leukopenia (34% grade 3/4), and anemia (22% required transfusion) were the most 
common serious side effects. At [ADDRESS_468383]-treatment, 61% of patients had severe 
xerostomia and 47% had compromised swallowing; the rate of feeding tube 
dependence was 20% (30, 32). 
 
Tox
icity rates with TFHX were higher than expected, with a significant number of 
patients experiencing grade 3/4 mucositis (76%) and dermatitis (61%) (33). Therefore, 
we attempted to decrease the toxicity of concomitant chemoradiation by [CONTACT_374107] (≥50%) response to ICT (34, 35). The cohort 
receiving 75 Gy to gross disease (high risk), [ADDRESS_468384] therapeutic ratio. Again, high locoregional 
and distant control rates were seen, though the rate of dermatitis (45%) was 
significantly lower (34).

disease emerged as an important treatment goal that was not achieved optimally with 
the chemotherapy doses applied during concomitant chemoradiotherapy. Indeed, 
approximately 20% of patients were noted to recur distantly, despi[INVESTIGATOR_374058] [26-28]. 
 
 
3.1.3 Induction Chemotherapy 
 
On the basis of the aforementioned studies, induction chemotherapy was 
investigated as a method of successfully eradicating micrometastatic disease. At the 
University of Chicago, carboplatin and paclitaxel were initially chosen as an induction 
chemotherapy (ICT) regimen because they are typi[INVESTIGATOR_356983]-tolerated with low rates of 
mucositis. The first report of this regimen demonstrated both high locoregional control 
and improved distant control (33). Systemic disease progression was noted in 7% of 
patients; this translated into improved 3-year progression-free and overall survival rates 
of 80% and 77%, respectively.  
 
Currently, the triplet combination of a taxane (docetaxel or paclitaxel), cisplatin, 
and 5-FU (TPF) is considered a standard induction regimen (if induction therapy is 
considered). This is largely based on the results of a meta-analysis demonstrating a 5% 
increase in survival for cohorts using a cisplatin/fluorouracil (5-FU) combination. There 
are three recently published phase III trials demonstrating the superiority of induction 
docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil over cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil when followed by 
[CONTACT_374108] (12, 36- 39). Controversy still exists regarding the 
overall survival benefit of adding induction TPF to chemoradiotherapy. Recent studies 
demonstrating no additional survival benefit are limited by [CONTACT_315620] 
(40-42).  Additionally, unpublished data demonstrates that TPF and carboplatin/ 
paclitaxel seem to have equivalent activity with less toxicity with carboplatin and 
paclitaxel.   Two studies evaluating carboplatin/paclitaxel induction demonstrated 82% 
and 87% response rates compared to our DeCIDE trial 64% response to TPF . (33, 34, 
42) Paclitaxel and nab-paclitaxel have the same activity with slightly better delivery and 
toxicity with nab-paclitaxel.  Compared with solvent-based paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel, 
delivers 33% higher drug concentration to tumors in preclinical xenograft models, and 
demonstrates enhanced transport across endothelial cell monolayers (Desai 2006,; 
Gardner, 2008).  The Cremophor El-free medium enables nab- paclitaxel to be given in a 
shorter duration without the need for premedication to prevent solvent-related 
hypersensitivity reactions.   Standard IV bags and tubing may be used for the delivery of 
nab-paclitaxel.  Hence, in our study we have opted for use of nab-paclitaxel. 
 
3.2 Human Papi[INVESTIGATOR_28597] (HPV) and HNSCC 
 
Both epi[INVESTIGATOR_374059]. Approximately 25%–35% of all HNSCC is associated 
with HPV genomic DNA, with the majority of these cancers occurring in the oropharynx 
(43). The incidence of oropharyngeal cancer has risen dramatically over the past two

Version Date: 05/20/2014;08/13/2014, 02/09/2015, 04/09/2015, 07/01/2015,01/04/2016, 05/18/2016 (PI-change) decades and it is now the most common HNSCC (44- 46). Both seropositivity and oral 
infection with high-risk type HPV (HPV-16) have been shown to increase the risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_315576] (OPC) (47, 48). HPV-positive tumors have a unique 
molecular profile: wild-type p53, upregulated p16, and downregulated pRb (49). There is 
direct evidence that HPV-16 is oncogenic, mechanistically driving the development and 
viability of cancer cells (50- 52). 
 
There is concern for an impending HNSCC-epi[INVESTIGATOR_374060].  Extrapolating 
recent trends, the annual number of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers (HPVOPC) is 
expected to surpass the annual number of cervical cancers by [CONTACT_2892] 2020 (53, 54) . 
This is especially concerning in light of the fact that patients with HPV-related OPC are 
approximately ten years younger on average than their HPV-negative OPC counterparts 
(46, 54, 55). 
 
Recently, studies have demonstrated that patients with HPV-related OPC have 
superior response to ther apy and survival compared to HPV-negative OPC.  In 
retrospective analyses of survival and HPV status from three phase III trials, 
unprecedented overall survival of approximately 80-90% at three years was obtained (2, 
56, 57).  Improved survival in these studies was largely due to markedly improved local-
regional control as a biologic consequence of the HPV-origin of these tumors. With the 
improvement in locoregional control, distant metastasis is now gaining recognition as a 
leading cause of death in HPV-positive patients and the rate of distant relapse is the 
same for both HPVOPC and non-HPV related tumors (57- 59). 
 
Recursive partitioning analysis has helped to stratify HPVOPC patients for both risk 
of death and distant relapse. In a retrospective analysis of the association between 
tumor HPV status and survival among patients with stage III/IV OPC who were enrolled 
in a randomized trial comparing accelerated-fractionation r adiotherapy with standard-
fractionation radiotherapy as part of concomitant chemoradiation with cisplatin, HPV 
status of the tumor was the major determinant of overall survival, followed by [CONTACT_374109]-years of tobacco smoking (≤10 vs. >10), and then nodal stage (N0 to 
N2a vs. N2b to N3) for HPV-positive tumors (57). In another retrospective analysis of  
the association between tumor HPV status and distant metastatic risk in a prospectively 
assembled cohort of OPC patients treated with radiotherapy alone or concurrent 
chemoradiotherapy, both tumor size (T1 to T3 vs. T4) and nodal stage (N0 to N2c vs. 
N3) were found to be major determinants of distant relapse (60). Of note, patients with 
N2c disease treated with radiation alone, however, had reduced rates of distant control. 
 
3.[ADDRESS_468385] clinical entity based on differing demographics, 
biology, and prognosis. The overall survival benefit in patients with HPVOPC compared 
non-HPV related cases is due largely to a marked improvement in locoregional control. 
Given the younger demographic of HPVOPC and the significant long-term morbidity 
incurred with high dose local therapy, reduction of RT intensity is a prudent 
consideration. Indeed, recent data indicates that quality of life in survivors of head and 
16 
Version Date: 05/20/2014;08/13/2014, 02/09/2015, 04/09/2015, 07/01/2015,01/04/2016, 05/18/2016 (PI-change) neck cancer is most affected by [CONTACT_374110], with stricture formation 
occurring at doses of ≥50 Gy to the pharyngeal constrictors (21, 22). 
 
Studies of anal cancer treatment provide evidence that excellent locoregional control 
may be obtained in HPV-related squamous cell cancers with lower doses of radiation as 
part of a chemoradiotherapy regimen. In a prospective trial of anal cancer patients 
receiving concomitant 5-FU/mitomycin C and [ADDRESS_468386] in good responders of either 25 Gy with iridium implant or 15 Gy by [CONTACT_374111], five year locoregional recurrence rates were 32% (61) . More contemporary 
prospective data in head and neck are also promising. ECOG 1308, A Phase II trial of 
induction chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_374112]-associated resectable squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx 
reported promising preliminary 1 year progression free survival of 91% in low risk HPV 
patients treated with low dose radiation.  Patients in this trial were placed in low risk and 
standard risk groups at study entry based on tobacco history, T stage and bulky lymph 
node status.  Eighty patients were enrolled, [ADDRESS_468387] risk disease.  All 
patients were HPV + by p-16 and/or ISH analysis.   Interim analysis of progression free 
analysis was reported for low and high risk patients with 91% and 89%, respectively.  
Additionally, subset analysis of 1-year progression free analysis demonstrated 97%, 
84% for <  and > 10 pack year history of tobacco, 92% (T1-T3)and 86% (T4), and 92% 
(N0-N2B), and 88% (N2C), respectively. (1) 
We have previously demonstrated excellent locoregional control rates with a 
concomitant chemoradiotherapy regimen of TFHX. With superior locoregional control, 
the importance of distant control became apparent and ICT was incorporated with 
reduction in rates of distant relapse.  This is an especially important consideration for 
HPV- related HNSCC, as the rate of distant metastases is the same for both HPVOPC 
and non-HPV related tumors and distant failure is now gaining recognition as a leading 
cause of death in HPV-positive patients. 
 
We 
hypothesize that in locally advanced cases of HPV-related HNSCC, 
Carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel ICT will produce high rate of complete or good partial 
responses  hence, allowing for reduced intensity chemoradiotherapy and  will have 
excellent outcomes after reduced treatment intensiity radiation or chemoradiation. W e 
hypothesize in particular that this approach wll reduce acute and long-term therapy-
related toxicities .  
 
In th
is study, we will specifically evaluate patients who have stage III or IV, HPV(+) , 
squamous cell cancer of the oropharynx. Patients will be given a course of [ADDRESS_468388] followed by [CONTACT_82830], radiologic, and biopsy for 
pathologic assessment.  Radiation to 45 Gy will be given to low dose arm (LDA)

rest of the patient. 
 
All deaths that occur within the trial period or within [ADDRESS_468396] be reported primarily for the purposes of serious adverse 
event (SAE) reporting; however, deaths due unequivocally to progression are not SAEs. 
 
All trial treatment-related toxicities and SAEs must be followed up until resolution. 
All patients who have new or worsening CTC grade [ADDRESS_468397] be recorded 
in the patients’ medical records.  In these cases, the investigators must record their 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_374062]’ medical records.  Laboratory abnormalities should not be 
reported as adverse events unless a criterion for an SAE is fulfilled, the laboratory 
abnormality causes the patient to discontinue from the study, or the investigator insists 
the abnormality should be reported as an AE.

any validation (e.g. HPV ISH or HPV E6/E7 PCR).  
 
-2- For oropharyngeal tumors p16 IHC positivity is sufficient to enroll and initiate 
treatment (p16 IHC interpretation to follow guidelines by [CONTACT_374113]/Lingen et al 2012).  It is 
recommended that p16 IHC positivity is validated at a later point (during or after 
treatment) using an E6/E7 based test at the University of Chicago and provided slides

5.1 General Considerations 
 
Induction chemotherapy will be administered on an outpatient basis followed by 
[CONTACT_374114] (as indicated) will be administered on an inpatient 
basis. All patients will be evaluated by [CONTACT_315628], medical and radiation oncologists prior 
to entry on the trial to determine optimal local treatment. Patients will start on induction 
chemotherapy within 6 weeks of enrollment. Three cylces of carboplatin and nab-
pacli
taxel induction chemotherapy will be followed by [INVESTIGATOR_163792]-adjusted 
radiation/chemoradiation.  
 
 Patients in Group A will receive radiation to [ADDRESS_468399] of twice daily 
radiation
 with paclitaxel, 5-FU, hydroxyurea TFHX) given on an alternating week basis. 
Patients should have a pre-induction chemotherapy CT simulation performed and fused 
to the planning CT scan.  TFHX will be given to a total dose of 50 Gy to patients in 
Group B and 70 Gy to patients in Group C as outlined below (See Section 5.3) .  
 
 Surgical validation of patients in Group A and Group B will be planned after 
completion of radiation/chemoradiotherapy (especially the first 50% of patients in 
groups A/B) .  Surgical extent and surgical procedures will be determined by [CONTACT_11065] 
(biopsy versus resection versus TORS) based on the protocol guidelines and disease 
status.  Standard resection or Trans oral robotic surgical resection (TORs) and lymph 
node dissection (LND) will be done for any patients who have residual disease (gross 
disease or radiologic evidence of disease) following chemoradiotherapy as surgical 
salvage.   (See section 5.7)

described in Section 5. No other investigational agents or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_309799]’s 
malignancy. 
  
5.4.2 Induction Therapy Details 
 
Carboplatin, and nab-paclitaxel combination will be administered for three 
cycles of 3 weeks duration each.  Chemoradiotherapy will begin after induction 
chemotherapy (i.e. day 64 of therapy). Dose delays and dose modifications 
should take place as in section 5.2  In no case should the three cycles of 
induction chemotherapy be given over a period exceeding twelve (12) 
weeks. 
 
Pre-medications:  Premedication with dexamethasone is recommended 
for all patients receiving weekly paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel therapy to reduce 
the incidence and severity of fluid retention as well as the severity of 
hypersensitivity reactions.  
 
Dexamethasone  20 mg x 1 dose taken intravenously or orally the morning of 
treatment will be administered.  
 
Nab-Paclitaxel: 100 mg/m2 in 250 ml of D5W over 60minutes (on Day 1, 8, 
and 15). 
 
Carboplatin: Start after completion of paclitaxel on Day 1, AUC 6  in 250 ml 
of NS over 30 -60 minutes 
 
A baseline creatinine level should be drawn within 1 week prior to starting 
chemotherapy.  
 
Antiemetics:  Pre-treatment with a [ADDRESS_468405] [eg ondansetron 
hydrochloride (Zofran ), dolasetron mesylate (Anzemet ), or granisetron 
hyd
rochloride (Kytril )] plus a corticosteroid prior to chemotherapy on Day 1 is 
recom
mended. The use of additional antiemetics and the prevention of delayed 
emesis are left to the discretion of the treating physician. 
 
Hydra
tion:   
Hydration is left to the discretion of the treating physician. 
 
For each cycle :  Use of filgrastim (neupogen) is to be given on Days 
16/17/18, but can be modified – increased or decreased as 
clinically indicated.

(filgrastim) daily, beginning on Day [ADDRESS_468408] neutropenia  grade 2 on Day 0 of any cycle.  In 
these patients, G-CSF should be utilized in all 
subsequent cycles. G-CSF can be utilized 
prophylactically from the start of chemoradiotherapy 
in all cycles at the discretion of the treating physician. 
 
Chemoradiotherapy cycles are repeated every 14 days until the completion of 
radiotherapy. 
 
As an alternative the option to use Cisplatin based chemoradiotherapy can 
be approved on a case by [CONTACT_374115]. Cisplatin based 
CRT will be given analogous to the EPIC HN and RTOG 0522 trials, albeit 
without cetuximab, and with the respective field adjustements as outlined 
below. Use of Cisplatin based CRT requires prior PI [INVESTIGATOR_41473] (please email/call

therapy, ideally prior to the start of chemotherapy. 
 
2. Treatment approaches will use Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) and, in 
selected cases, 3D conformal radiotherapy will be used alone or in combination 
with IMRT. In both instances the physician will attempt to deliver an even dose 
to the target tissue and minimize doses to surrounding normal structures. The 
use of customized blocks or multileaf collimation for field shapi[INVESTIGATOR_315580].  
 
 
3. Localization requirements: All patients will be immobilized and simulated in 
the treatement position prior to the start of induction chemotherapy and after 
induction chemotherapy within 1-[ADDRESS_468410] be reproducibly immobilized. Radio-opaque markers may be used 
whenever possible to delineate the surgical scars, extent of nodal disease, skin 
involvement, and any gross disease.  
 
4. Target volumes:  Appropriate field sizes will be determined at the time of 
simulation to treat gross disease and areas of potential microscopic disease.   
28 
Version Date: 05/20/2014;08/13/2014, 02/09/2015, 04/09/2015, 07/01/2015,01/04/2016, 05/18/2016 (PI-change) Three target volumes will be defined on each CT slice: GTV, PTV1 and PTV2. 
GTV will be all gross tumor identified by [CONTACT_117145], additional clinical 
information and radiographic studies before induction chemotherapy.  The GTV 
will be expanded by 1.[ADDRESS_468411]-induction chemotherapy 
volume is used to define the nodal volume GTV. PTV2 may not differ 
significantly from PTV1 if the required GTV expansion includes the next nodal 
station at risk. For tumors that cross midline in the oral cavity or oropharynx (e.g. 
tumors involving the soft palate and base of tongue), PTV [ADDRESS_468412]. Reasonable 
attempts should be made to provide an adequate treatment volume without 
encroaching on critical organs (e.g. spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]) or extending to the skin. 
 
5. Field Size: Appropriate field sizes will be determined at the time of simulation to 
treat gross disease and areas of potential microscopic disease. Initial field size 
and arrangement will be at the discretion of the attending radiation oncologist. 
The optimal field arrangement will be determined based on the treatment 
planning techniques employed. All fields must be treated during each treatment 
session. 
 
6. Treatment technique:  Blocking will be individualized for each patient.  Either 
custom Cerrobend blocks or multileaf collimator will be acceptable. 
 
Intensity modulated Radiotherapy:  Optimal IMRT planning will depend on the 
planning system employed.  We anticipate the optimal plan will use 7 to 11 
gantry positions.  Acceptable plans will encompass the PTV with the 95% 
isodose line.  No more than 1% of the PTV should receive less than 95% of the 
prescribed dose.  Plans should be reviewed to insure that any part of the PTV 
getting less than 95% of the prescribed dose is at the edge of the volume.  In no 
case should a central area of the PTV receive less than 95% of the prescribed 
dose.  No more than 1% of the PTV should receive more than 110% of the 
prescribed dose. 
 
3D Conformal Radiotherapy:  The neck should be treated with opposed lateral 
fields using a half-field technique.  The lower neck should be treated with an 
anterior field prescribed to a depth of 3 cm.  Opposed fields for the lower neck 
are permitted in order to improve PTV coverage and increase homogeneity.  
29 
Version Date: 05/20/2014;08/13/2014, 02/09/2015, 04/09/2015, 07/01/2015,01/04/2016, 05/18/2016 (PI-change) Wedges, tissue compensators or segmented fields should be used to insure 
uniformity of PTV coverage.  Electron boosts of the posterior neck are permitted 
to limit the dose to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831].  Electron fields shall be prescribed to the 
depth of maximum dose with the energy and field size chosen so that the target 
volume is encompassed within 90% of the prescribed isodose line.  A cord block 
is permitted on the anterior or lateral fields provided it dose not block tumor.  
Feathering the match line is permitted in cases where a cord block would block 
tumor. For 3D techniques, acceptable plans will encompass the PTV within the 
95% isodose line. The dose variation in the PTV will be +7% and -5% of the 
prescription point dose. 
 
7. Dose Fractionation:  Isodose calculations in the axial, sagittal, or coronal 
planes are required. In addition, dose volume histograms for the GTV and the 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_315581]. 
i. Group A:  Radiation will be delivered in 200 cGy daily fractions to a 
total dose of 5000 cGy. No chemotherapy will be delivered with 
radiation. Radiation will be delivered for 5 consecutive weeks. 
ii. Group B:  Each cycle of treatment will consist of 5 consecutive days of 
radiation with 150 cGy given bid (300 cGy per day and 1500 cGy per 
week) in conjunction with chemotherapy. Three total cycles of 
chemoradiation will be delivered. Ideally, PTV1 and PTV2 will be 
treated with the first two cycles and PTV1 will be treated with the third 
cycle. Chemoradiation will be given on an alternating weekly basis. 
There should be a minimum of 6 hours between fractions.  All fields 
will be treated each day.  In the case of mechanical failure or a 
holiday, one day of BID radiotherapy can be replaced with a single 
QD fraction of 200 cGy.  Accordingly, the final cumulative dose will be 
slightly less. Ideally, the dose to PTV1 will be 45 Gy and PTV2 will be 
30 Gy.  
iii. Group C (with THFX):  Each cycle of treatment will consist of 5 
consecutive days of radiation with 150 cGy given bid (300 cGy per 
day and 1500 cGy per week) in conjunction with chemotherapy. Five 
total cycles of chemoradiation will be delivered. Ideally, PTV1 and 
PTV2 will be treated with the first 3 cycles and PTV1 will be treated 
with the final 2 cycles. Chemoradiation will be given on an alternating 
weekly basis. There should be a minimum of 6 hours between 
fractions.  All fields will be treated each day.  In the case of 
mechanical failure or a holiday, one day of BID radiotherapy can be 
replaced with a single QD fraction of 200 cGy.  Accordingly, the final 
cumulative dose will be slightly less. Ideally, the dose to PTV1 will be 
70-75 Gy and PTV2 will be 45-54 Gy. 
iv. Group C (with concurrent cisplatin):  PTV1 and PTV2 will be treated 
with to 54 Gy in 1.8 Gy fraction/day. For the last 12 treatment days, 
PTV1 will be boosted an additional 18 Gy in 1.5 Gy fraction/day given 
at least 6 hours after the 1.8 Gy fraction.

spi[INVESTIGATOR_374066].  Attempts should be 
made to limit the spi[INVESTIGATOR_181586] < [ADDRESS_468413] 
dose to < [ADDRESS_468414], superior/middle constrictor muscles, optic 
nerves/chiasm, parotid glands, temporo-mandibular (T-M) joints and cochlea, 
oral cavity, mandible, eyes, lens, brachial plexus, esophagus (including 
postcricoid pharynx) and glottic larynx. The normal tissues will be contoured and 
considered as solid organs. DVH’s must be generated for relevant critical 
normal structures, any corresponding PRVs, and the unspecified tissues. 
Institutions that use PRVs must clearly define them as such. Dose constraints 
are given below: 
 
Ultimate inclusion of the normal structures and exceptions from the above 
guidelines will be made at the discretion of theattending Radiation Oncologist. 
 
10.  Special situations:  3D conformal treatment techniques may be preferable to 
IMRT in certain situations.  Some large primary tumors and some large neck 
nodes may extend up to the skin.  In these situations it may not be possible to 
add a sufficient margin to the GTV to account for variability in the patient set up.  
In this situation 3D conformal treatment techniques may be preferable to IMRT.

5.6 Supportive Guidelines 
 
 Antiemetics will be ordered at the discretion of the attending physician. 
 
 Use of growth factor support (G-CSF) on days 16/17/18), see above 
 
 A double lumen venous access device (e.g., Port-a-Cath ) is recommended 
p
rior to initiation of therapy. 
 
 Use of a feeding device is recommended for high-risk patients. Placement of a 
feed
ing device is left to the discretion of the treating physician/investigator. 
Commonly applied criteria for feeding device placement include 
i. Loss of > 10% of body weight from the start of therapy 
ii. Dehydration or inability to maintain adequate oral hydration 
iii. Inability to maintain intake of > 25 kcal/kg of ideal body weight 
 
 During chemoradiotherapy patients should receive instructions for oral hygiene 
and prescriptions to include: 
i. Oral nystatin or fluconazole (100mg QD) 
ii. Viscous lidocaine HCl (Xylocaine ) solution) and/or Grade I

iii. Normal saline mouthwash 10ml QID swish and spit 
 
iv. Natural Care Gel (or similar product) BID during chemoradiotherapy 
and TID during rest week. 
 
v. Vigilon (or similar product) to be applied to open wounds during 
chemoradiotherapy. 
 
vi. Silvadene cream to open wounds followed by [CONTACT_374117] (N.B.: discontinue 
Silvadene and zinc oxide creams 1 day prior to radiotherapy). 
 
vii.
 Aquaphor (or similar brand) cream to lips PRN. 
 
viii. Adequate analgesia is essential to maintain oral intake and patient 
comfort. Narcotic analgesics are usually necessary and should be 
used at the physician/investigator discretion. 
 
ix. Therabite for trismus if appropriate. 
 
x. Replacement for electrolyte imbalances when applicable.   
 
 Prior to discharge of the patients after a cycle of chemoradiation, a CBC and 
plate
let count, and determination of serum electrolytes, including creatinine will 
be performed. 
 
 A visit to the treating physician is strongly recommended between cycles 
of 
 chemoradiation (i.e., days 6- 14)   
 
 Use of intravenous home hydration is strongly recommended in patients with 
inade
quate oral intake: normal saline 1000ml IV QD during rest week (days 6-
14). 
 
 If Hgb < 10, patients should generally be transfused an amount sufficient to 
increase Hgb to  10.  The Hgb level should be maintained > 11 mg/dl for the 
duration of chemoradiotherapy in all patients.

Performance measures will be assessed by [CONTACT_374118]. Voice will be assessed as a simple yes/no response from 
patients as to whether their voice has returned to normal.  Swallowing will be 
determined by [CONTACT_1962]’ ability to swallow table food.  A formal swallow evaluation 
will be done on patients experiencing dysphagia.  Additionally, late toxicity will be 
determined by [CONTACT_315637], and dental decay, 
osteoradionecrosis, as well as the presence of G-tube dependency, 
tracheostomy placement, and dysphagia.

hyp
onatremia, hypocalcemia; less severe than those seen after 
cisplatin (usually asymptomatic) 
 Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, diarrhea, anorexia 
 Hematologic: Myelosuppression is dose related and is the dose-
limiting
 toxicity; thrombocytopenia is the predominant manifestation,

Other Dose Modifications and Adverse Event Management 
Hematologic Dose Modifications for Hydroxyurea: 
Neutropenia :  
If the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is between 500 and 1000 on day 0 – 5 of each 
cycle, decrease hydroxyurea to 50% of the full dose. On subsequent cycles, a reduced 
starting dose of hydroxyurea should be used. 
For ANC of  500/l on Day 0 – 5 of any cycle, omit hydroxyurea, and administer 600 
mg/m2/day of 5-FU and radiotherapy only.  On subsequent cycles, a reduced starting 
dose of hydroxyurea by 50% should be used. 
 
Thrombocytopenia :  
For a platelet count of 50,000/ l to 74,000/ l on Day 0 – 5 of each cycle, decrease 
hydroxyurea to 50% of full dose.  On subsequent cycles, a reduced starting dose of 
hydroxyurea may be used. 
For a platelet count  50,000/ l on Day 0 – 5 of any cycle, omit hydroxyurea, and 
administer 600 mg/m2/day of 5-FU and radiotherapy only.  On subsequent cycles, a

paclitaxel by [CONTACT_30560].  
For ANC </= 500 or platelet count of less than 50 on day 0-5 of any cycle: hold 
paclitaxel for that cycle and decrease by [CONTACT_315638].   
 
Mucositis, Dysphagia, Dermatitis, Diarrhea 
 
Treatment cycles should not be delayed for mucositis, dysphagia, dermatitis or diarrhea. 
For grade 4 mucositis, dysphagia, and dermatitis exceeding 7 days duration or 
persisting on Day 1 of a subsequent cycle, decrease 5-FU to 500 mg/m2/day.   
For grade 4 diarrhea exceeding 7 days duration or persisting on Day 1 of a subsequent 
cycle, decrease 5-FU to 500 mg/m2/day. 
 
Doses will not be increased again on subsequent cycles. 
Nephrotoxicity 
Grade 2 renal toxicity – administer 50% dose hydroxyurea 
Grade 3, 4 renal toxicity – Hold hydroxyurea 
 
Hepatotoxicity on day 0:  Grade 3, 4 – Hold hydroxyurea and adjust paclitaxel per 
package insert

Version Date: 05/20/2014;08/13/2014, 02/09/2015, 04/09/2015, 07/01/2015,01/04/2016, 05/18/2016 (PI-change) Peripheral neuropathy: 
For Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy, decrease paclitaxel by [CONTACT_315639] (see hematologic toxicity chart).  
For Grade 3 or greater peripheral neuropathy, discontinue paclitaxel.  
 
 
Other Non-hematological Toxicity 
Chemoradiotherapy should not be interrupted for non-hematologic toxicity except as 
judged necessary on a case- by-case basis by [CONTACT_315640], medical 
oncologists, and Principal Investigator. 
 
In the presence of a persisting fever  38C or other clinically apparent infection a cycle 
can be postponed for 1 week or interrupted (if treatment cycle has already started) if this 
is necessary in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_315587]. 
 
Cutaneous vasculit ic toxicities, including vasculitic ulcerations and gangrene, have 
occurred in patients with myeloproliferative disorders during therapy with hydroxyurea. 
These vasculitic toxicities were reported most often in patients with a history of, or 
currently rece iving, interferon therapy. Due to potentially severe clinical outcomes for 
the cutaneous vasculitic ulcers reported in patients with myeloproliferative disease, 
hydroxyurea should be discontinued if cutaneous vasculitic ulcerations develop. 
 
Geriatric Use: Elderly patients may be more sensitive to the effects of hydroxyurea, and 
may require a lower dose regimen. This drug is known to be excreted by [CONTACT_10521], 
and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal 
functi on. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, 
care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function.

Myelosuppression 
If the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is < 1000 on day 1 of each cycle, hold cisplatin 
and when count recover > 1000 ANC, then decrease cisplatin 25%. On subsequent 
cycles, a reduced starting dose of cisplatin should be used. 
 
Peripheral neuropathy 
If Grade 2 neuropathy on day 1 of each cycle, then decrease cisplatin 25%. On 
subsequent cycles, a reduced starting dose of cisplatin should be used. 
If Grade 3 or greater neuropathy on day 1 of each cycle, hold cisplatin and when 
neuropathy recovers to grade 2 or better, then decrease cisplatin 25%. On subsequent 
cycles, a reduced starting dose of cisplatin should be used.

7.0 AGENT FORMULATION AND PROCUREMENT 
 
7.1 N ab-paclitaxel 
 
Classification: 
Antineoplastic Agent, Antimicrotubular; Natural Source (Plant) Derivative; Taxane 
Derivative 
Mode of Action: 
Albumin-bound paclitaxel nanoparticle formulation. Paclitaxel promotes microtubule 
assembly by  [CONTACT_68532], stabilizing existing microtubules, 
and inhibiting their disassembly, interfering with the late G 2 mitotic phase, and inhibiting 
cell replication. May also distort mitotic spi[INVESTIGATOR_36874], resulting in the breakage of 
chromosomes. Paclitaxel may also suppress cell proliferation and modulate immune 
response.  
How Supplied: 
Injection, powder for reconstitution: Abraxane®: 100 mg [contains albumin (human)] 
Storage: 
Store in vials in original cartons at room temperature (20oC-25oC; 68oF to 77oF). 
Retain in the original package to protect from bright light.  
Stability: 
Unopened vials of nab-paclitaxel are stable until the date indicated on the package 
when stored at the above temperature in the original package. Reconstituted vials of 
albumin-bound paclitaxel may be refrigerated at 2oC to 8oC (38oF to 46oF) for a 
maximum of 8 hours and should be protected from bright light 
Dose Specifics: 
Albumin-bound paclitaxel 100mg/m2 IV over 30, minutes on day 1 and 8 of each 21-day

 Carboplatin: supplied commercially as a sterile lyophilized powder available in single-
dose vials containing 50 mg, 150 mg and 450 mg of carboplatin. Each vial contains 
equal parts by [CONTACT_69149]. Please refer to package insert for 
information on preparation. 
Side effects: listed in section 9.3. Please refer to the package insert for full prescribing 
information. 
Preparation: Immediately before use, the content of each vial must be reconstituted with 
either sterile water for injection, USP, 5% dextrose in water, or 0.9% sodium chloride 
injection, USP to produce a carboplatin concentration of 10 mg/ml. When prepared as 
directed, carboplatin solutions are stable for 8 hours at room temperature. Since no 
antibacterial preservative is contained n the formulation, it is recommended that 
carboplatin solutions be discarded 8 hours after dilution. 
Storage and Stability: Unopened vials of carboplatin are stable for the life indicated on 
the package when stored at controlled room temperature and protected from light. 
Administration: Administer over 1⁄2 hour after completing the paclitaxel infusion. The

7.5  Paclitaxel 
 
Chemistry: Paclitaxel is a natural product with antitumor activity. The chemical name [CONTACT_315666] 5,20 ‐Epoxy‐1,2 hexahydroxytax ‐11‐ en 9‐one 4, 10 diacetate 2 ‐
benzoate 13 ‐ester with (2R,3S)‐N‐benzoyl‐3‐phenylisoserine. Paclitaxel is a 
white to off ‐white crystalline powder with the empi[INVESTIGATOR_62497] C47H51NO14 and a 
molecular weight of 853.9. It is extremely lipophilic and melts at around 216 ‐217°C. 
Paclitaxel is highly insoluble in water. 
 
Mechanisms of Action: Microtubules have been demonstrated to be very strategic 
targets for antineoplastic agents; however, few antimicrotubule agents have been 
discovered and encompassed into standard chemotherapeutic regimens. Paclitaxel, a 
diterpenoid plant product extracted from the bark of the western yew (Taxus brevifolia) , 
has a unique mechanism of action. Unlike other antimicrotubule agents in clinical use 
(e.g. colchicine, vincristine, and vinblastine) that shift the equilibrium between 
microtubules and tubulin subunits toward microtubule disassembly, paclitaxel promotes 
assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilizes microtubules by [CONTACT_374121]. These microtubules are stable even when treated with low 
temperatures or calcium, conditions that usually promote disassembly. This unusual 
stability results in the inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubule 
network that is essential for vital interphase and mitotic cellular functions. In addition, 
paclitaxel induces abnormal arrays or "bundles" of microtubules during mitosis. 
 
Human Toxicology: The dose limiting toxicities and MTD of paclitaxel administered on a 
variety of schedules to patients with solid neoplasms were previously evaluated in 
phase I trials. In these studies, paclitaxel was infused over 1, 3, 6, and 24 h, but severe 
acute reactions, characterized by [CONTACT_315642], hypotension, stridor, tachy ‐ and 
bradyarrhythmias, and death, resulted in the temporary discontinuation of all trials. 
These reactions were attributed to paclitaxel's Cremophor vehicle, since identical 
reactions were observed with other drugs formulated with it and when the vehicle alone 
was administered to animals. Since a higher incidence of these acute reactions was 
observed with shorter durations of infusion, studies that used shorter infusions were 
permanently discontinued, and trials that evaluated longer infusion durations (24 h) 
were resumed using antiallergic pre ‐medications consisting of corticosteroids, H1 ‐ 
and H2‐ histamine antagonists. These modifications were associated with a marked 
reduction in the incidence of acute reactions. Neutropenia was the major dose ‐limiting 
toxicity for paclitaxel in phase I solid tumor trials. In addition, a sensory neuropathy, 
characterized by a glove ‐and‐ sock distribution of numbness and paresthesias, was

7.7 Filgrastim (Neupogen ) Drug Information 
 
Packaging and Formulation 
 
G-CSF (Filgrastim) is commercially available. Filgrastim is a sterile, clear, 
colorless, preservative-free liquid for parenteral administration, containing Filgrastim at 
a specific activity of 1.0 ± 0.6 x 108 U/mg (as measured by a cell mitogenesis assay).  
The product is available in single use vial form and prefilled syringe.  The single use vial 
contains 480 mcg Filgrastim at a fill volume of 1.6 mL.  The formulation is: 480 mcg of 
Filgrastim (r-methHuG-CSF), containing acetate (0.94 mg), sorbitol (80.0 mg), Tween® 
80 (0.004%), sodium (0.056 mg) in water for injection, USP q.s. ad (1.6 mL).  The single 
use prefilled syringe contains 0.6 mg Filgrastim at a fill volume of 0.8 mL.  The 
formulation is: 480 mcg of Filgrastim (r-methHuG-CSF), containing acetate (0.472 mg), 
sorbitol (40.0 mg), Tween® 80 (0.004%), sodium (0.028 mg) in water for injection, USP 
q.s. ad (0.8 mL).   
 
Storage Conditions and Stability 
 
Filgrastim should be stored in the refrigerator at 2o to 8oC (36o to 46oF).  Avoid 
shaking.  Prior to injection, Filgrastim may be allowed to reach room temperature for a 
maximum of 24 hours.  Any vial or pre-filled syringe left at room temperature for greater 
than 24 hours should be discarded.  Parenteral drug products should be inspected 
visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever 
solution and container permit; if particulate or discoloration are observed, the container 
should not be used.  At a concentration of 5 mcg/ml or greater in D5W, filgrastim is 
stable for 7 days at room or refrigerator temperatures.  At dilutions from 5 to 15 mcg/ml, 
albumin in a final concentration if 2mg/ml should be added to protect against adsorption 
to plastic materials.  Addition of albumin is unnecessary when the drug is diluted to a 
concentration greater than 15 mcg/ml in D5W.  Dilutions in D5W are stable in glass 
bottles, polyvinyl chloride, polyolefin or polypropylene bags and IV sets, and Travenol 
Infusors. 
 
Dilution of Neupogen® to a final concentration of less than 5 mcg/mL is not 
recommended at any time.  Do not dilute with saline at any time because the product 
may precipi[INVESTIGATOR_047]. 
 
Preparation and Administration 
 
If using the vial, draw the appropriate dose into a syringe for subcutaneous 
injection.  If using the pre-filled syringe, select the appropriate pre-filled syringe for 
subcutaneous injection.  Inject only the appropriate dose, discard the unused drug.  
Incompatibilities: Normal saline.

Version Date: 05/20/2014;08/13/2014, 02/09/2015, 04/09/2015, 07/01/2015,01/04/2016, 05/18/2016 (PI-change)  
Adverse Reactions 
 
The following events are associated with Filgrastim and meet the regulatory 
definition of “expected”.  The only consistently observed clinical toxicity described with 
Filgrastim is medullary bone pain.  Other clinical adverse events that have been 
described include skin rash, and cutaneous vasculitis.  Since commercial introduction of 
Neupogen®, there have been rare reports of allergic-type reactions.  Biochemical 
abnormalities that may occur include increases in alkaline phosphatase, uric acid, and 
lactate dehydrogenase. 
 
Overdosage 
 
The maximum amount of Filgrastim that can be safely administered has not been 
determined.  Efficacy was demonstrated at doses of 4 to 8 mcg/kg/day in the phase 3 
study of nonmyeloablative chemotherapy.  Patients in  bone marrow transplant studies 
received up to 138 mcg/kg/day without toxic effects, although there was a flattening of 
the dose response curve above daily doses of greater than 10 mcg/kg/day.   
 
In Fligrastim clinical trials of cancer patients receiving myelosuppressive 
chemotherapy, WBC > 100,000/mm3 have been reported in less than 5% of patients, 
but were not associated with any reported adverse clinical effects.  
 
In cancer patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy, discontinuation of 
Filgrastim therapy usually results in a 50% decrease in circulating neutrophils within 1 to 
2 days, with a return to pretreatment levels in 1 to 7 days. 
 
Toxicity/Warnings 
 
Filgrastim is contraindicated inpatients with known hypersensitivity to E coli -derived 
proteins, pegfilgrastim, Neupogen®, or any other component of the product. 
 
Rare cases of splenic rupture have been reported following the administration of 
colony-stimulating factors, including Filgrastim, for peripheral blood progenitor cell 
(PBPC) mobilization in both healthy donors and patients with cancer.  Some of these 
cases were fatal.  Individuals receiving Filgrastim who report abdominal or shoulder tip 
pain, particularly healthy donors receiving Filgrastim for PBPC mobilization, should be 
evaluated for an enlarged spleen or splenic rupture.     
 
Adult respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS) has been reported in neutropenic 
patients with sepsis receiving Filgrastim, and is postulated to be secondary to an influx 
of neutrophils to sites of inflammation in the lungs.  Neutropenic patients receiving 
Filgrastim who develop fever, lung infiltrates, or respi[INVESTIGATOR_315590].  In the event that ARDS occurs, Filgrastim should be 
discontinued until resolution of ARDS and patients should receive appropriate medical 
management for this condition.

Allergic-type reactions occurring on initial or subsequent treatment have been 
reported in < [ADDRESS_468432] often skin 
(rash, urticaria, facial edema), respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] (wheezing, dyspnea), and cardiovascular 
(hypotension,   tachycardia).  Some reactions occurred on initial exposure.  Reactions 
tended to occur within the first [ADDRESS_468433] cases after administration of anti-histamines, steroids, bronchodilators, 
and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_238].  Symptoms recurred in more than half the patients who were 
rechallenged. 
 
Severe sickle cell crisis have been reported in patients with sickle cell disease 
(specifically homozygous sickle cell anemia, sickle/hemoglobin C disease, and 
chemotherapy. One of these cases was fatal.   
 
PREGNANCY AND LACTATION 
Since there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, the 
effect, if any, of Filgrastim on the developi[INVESTIGATOR_374072].     
 
It is not known whether Filgrastim is excreted in human milk.  Because many drugs 
are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Filgrastim is 
administered to a nursing woman. 
 
DRUG INTERACTIONS 
 
No formal drug interaction studies between pegfilgrastim and other drugs have 
been performed.  Drugs which may potentiate the release of neutrophils, such as 
lithium, should be used with caution.  Patients receiving lithium and Filgrastim should 
have more frequent monitoring of neutrophil counts. 
 
Nursing Guidelines 
 
Filgrastim should be kept in the refrigerator until needed and the vials or Pre-
filled Syringe should not be shaken.  The drug should be administered at the same time 
each day.  Vials and Pre-filled Syringes of filgrastim are single-dose and the remaining 
drug should be discarded.  Refer to protocol text for information regarding requirements 
for documentation of doses administered, temperatures, side effects, etc. 
Acetaminophen is the recommended analgesic for mild bone pain. Duration of therapy 
will be determined by [CONTACT_315644] (WBC/ANC) to specific values.

the Univ. of Chicago pathology department will lead this effort. We will also evaluate 
tumors on surgery/biopsy post chemoradiotherapy. 
 
Furthermore it remains unclear what the molecular and immunological 
determinants are that predict for improved responses for HPV-associated HNSCC. 
While largely descriptice, in order to accomplish such analysis we will collect tumor, 
blood, and saliva as part of our regular tissue banking effort on all patients.  
Plasma, DNA and RNA will be extracted from patient samples and stored until 
further analysis.  
 
 
8.2 Sample and Tissue Procurement 
  
Archival tumor collection 
 
All patients at the time of enrollment need to provide ≥10 5-micron uncstained slides for 
correlative analysis. Under extenuating circumstances the PI [INVESTIGATOR_374073], but it is expected that patients, who cannot fulfill this requirement undergo 
a new biopsy prior to enrollment on study. 
Tissue Biopsy  
 
Tumor biopsy will be performed prior to starting therapy or archival tissue will be 
obtained for all patients. At the time of surgical resection or biopsy, tissue in excess of 
what is necessary for diagnostic purposes will be obtained <15 min after removal from 
the patient. Tissues will be instantaneously frozen and stored anonymously with a 
unique barcode at -80C in a locked freezer in Biospecimen Shared Resource (Tissue 
Bank) at The University of Chicago. Additional alternative processing (e.g. tissue 
digestion, and cell suspension generation for flow analyses is also acceptable).

8.4 Correlative analysis 
 
 A number of exploratory analyses will be performed to better characterize 
factors contributing to treatment benefit or failure. 
 
8.4.1  Biopsy samples after induction chemotherapy and/or chemoradiotherapy will be 
stained by [CONTACT_4729], and assessed histo-morphologically to 
descripe the characteristics of dying HPV(+) HNC. Analyses will be performed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. 
Nicole Cipriani and colleagues. These analyses will be descriptive, but will be correlated 
with clinical outcome, i.e. amount of tumor shrinkage, failure after treatment, side effects 
etc. 
8.4.2  For patients that fail therapy (and control samples for comparison), genetic 
analysis including the mutational spectrum, expression phenotype and other genetic 
profiling features will be examined in an exploratory manner. This may include profiling 
using next generation sequenting (e.g. Foundation medicine, or as outline in Seiwert et 
al ASCO 2013). Patients have the option to opt out of such genetic analyses in the 
consent form. 
8.4.3 Using both archival or fresh tumor samples (tissue digest or fresh frozen/OTC 
tissue) we will analyze the immune microenvironment and CD8 Tumor infiltrating 
lymphocyte characteristics in a small number of patients in a descriptive fashion, 
comparing patients that fail therapy with tumors from control tumors. The analyses may 
include determination of CD8, PDL1, FOXP3, IDO, and other immune related markers 
that will be determined by [CONTACT_9064], immunofluorescence, or flow

Adverse events (AEs) will use the descriptions and grading scales found in the 
revised NCO Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC). This study will utilize the CTC version 
3.[ADDRESS_468444] access to a copy 
of the CTC version 3.0. A copy of the CTC version 3.0. A copy of the CTC version 3.0 
can be downloaded from the CTEP web site ( http://cetp.cancer.gove/reporting/ctc.html ). 
 
SAE Reporting Wording 
 
Adverse events must be reported to regulatory authorities according to the 
definitions and timelines specified in the local laws and regulations. 
 
Serious events are defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose 
results in: 
 
 Death 
 Initial or prolonged inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
 A life-threatening situation (where the patient is at immediate risk of death). 
 Severe or permanent disability. 
 Congenital anomaly. 
 Or, is significant for any other reason. 
 
The
 definition of serious adverse event (experience) also includes important medical 
event .  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether 
expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events 
that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_374077].  These should also usually be considered serious.  
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 
The definition of “related” being that there is a reasonable possibility that the drug 
caused the adverse experience. 
 
 
Serious adverse events occurring after a patient is discontinued from the study will 
NOT be reported unless the investigator feels that the even may have been caused by 
[CONTACT_13462] a protocol procedure. Study-specific clinical outcomes of death 
because of disease progression are exempt from serious adverse event reporting, 
unless the investigator deems them related to use of the study drug. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_374078] a serious adverse event.  
 
In general, serious adverse events assessed as clearly being due to disease 
progression and not due to study drugs(s) should be excluded from adverse event 
63

12.1 Study Design/Endpoints 
 
12.1.1 Study design 
 
This Phase II study consists of a single arm trial to study the feasibility of 
chemoradiation de-intensification after induction chemotherapy for HPV-positive 
oropharyngeal cancers. All patients will be assessed for response to chemoradiation; 
acute/late mucosal, dermatologic, and salivary toxicity; progression free survival (PFS) 
and overall survival. Toxicities will be described. 
 
12.1.[ADDRESS_468453] treatment 
biopsy/surgery with de-intensified chemoradiation after TPF induction 
chemotherapy. 
 
To determine the rate of clinical complete response by [CONTACT_374126]-intensified chemoradiation. 
 
To determine overall survival and cancer specific survival. 
 
To determine local/regional failure, time to distant failure, duration of response 
and failure patterns. 
 
To determine the rates of acute toxicity with de-intensified chemoradiation as 
assessed by [CONTACT_356644], xerostomia, anorexia, weight loss, dermatitis and G-tube 
placement.  
 
To determine the rates of late toxicity with de-intensified chemoradiation as 
determined by [CONTACT_374102], dental decay, osteroradionecrosis, G-tube 
dependency, tracheostomy placement and dysphagia. 
 
 
12.1. [ADDRESS_468454]-CRT (as available) 
To collect blood and tissue samples for translational research detailed in section 
2.4 and section 8.

Version Date: 05/20/2014;08/13/2014, 02/09/2015, 04/09/2015, 07/01/2015,01/04/2016, 05/18/2016 (PI-change)  
To assess HPV and tumor reactive T cells in the tumor and circulating blood prior 
to induction chemotherapy, prior to radiation therapy, during radiation therapy 
and 2 months after radiation therapy.  
 
12.2 Data analysis 
 
12.2.1 Sample size/accrual rate 
 
Sample Size: 61patients 
Estimated monthly accrual: 3-[ADDRESS_468455] in which the objective is to establish that the 
2-year PFS rate is within an acceptable margin of that for carboplatin, paclitaxel, and 
cetuximab as part of the EPIC HN trial.  We assume the true 2-year PFS rate for 
carboplatin, paclitaxel, and cetuximab is 85%, and set the non-inferiority margin at 11%, 
corresponding to 2-year PFS rate for carboplatin, nab-paclitaxel of at least 74%.    We 
will test H 0: Δ<-11% vs. H A: Δ>=- 11%.  
Usin
g Power Analysis and Sample Size (PASS v11) software, n= 61 patients will 
provide 80% power to test this hypothesis using a (one-sided) type I error rate of 0.10. 
Essentially, H 0 will be rejected and the experimental regimen declared not materially 
inferior to EPIC-induction if the lower, one-sided 90% confidence limit for the 2-year 
PFS rate exceeds 74%, which will occur if [ADDRESS_468456] 82%.  (This 
calculation assumes that the true PFS rate for the experimental regimen is 85% and 
that all patients will be followed for a minimum of 2 years.)  If dropouts occur, the PFS 
rate will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier procedure and its standard error via 
Greenwood’s formula, with corresponding (large-sample) confidence limit. 
 
  
  
12.2.3 Statistical methods 
 
Primary Endpoint 
 
Progression-free survival (PFS) will be calculated for each patient as the time 
from enrollment until disease progression or death from any cause; patients still alive 
and progression-free will be censored as of the time of the last negative evaluation.  I f 
all patients are followed for two years, the PFS rate and confidence interval will be 
determined based on the exact binomial distribution.  Otherwise PFS will be estimated 
using the Kaplan-Meier (65) method and a (large-sample) one-sided 90% confidence 
70 
Version Date: 05/20/2014;08/13/2014, 02/09/2015, 04/09/2015, 07/01/2015,01/04/2016, 05/18/2016 (PI-change) interval will be derived  for the PFS rate at two years to test the non-inferiority 
hypothesis.  Median PFS will be estimated as described in Brookmeyer and Crowley 
(66). 
 
Secondary Endpoints 
 
Clinical and pathologic VVresponse rates will be determined and 9 5% confidence 
intervals obtained using the exact binomial distribution.   
 
Kaplan-Meier curves will be generated for overall and cancer-specific survival; for 
the latter endpoint, patients dying from non-cancer related causes will be censored at 
the time of death.  In addition, cumulative incidence curves (Gooley et al., 76) will be 
derived for the competing risks of cancer and non-cancer death.  Time to local/regional 
failure and distant failure will similarly be assessed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and 
competing risks modeling.  Duration of response will be determined as the time from 
response until disease progression or death among the subset of patients who respond, 
and estimated by [CONTACT_5263]-Meier to accommodate potential censoring. 
 
Tox
icity rates will be summarized by [CONTACT_50803], grade, and attribution.  In 
particular, the incidence of acute (mucositis, xerostomia, anorexia, weight loss, 
dermatitis and G-tube placement) and late-term (xerostomia, dental decay, 
osteroradionecrosis, G-tube dependency, speech abnormalities, tracheostomy 
placement and dysphagia) toxicities will be estimated along with 95% confidence 
intervals.   
 
 
 
Laboratory Objectives 
 
Results of pathology/histologic review of post induction biopsy specimens will be 
descriptive and summeraize in tabular format. 
 
Changes in reactive T cells over time will be assessed using mixed effects 
models and simple paired t-tests.

Treatment should be discontinued for Grade 4 hypersensitivity reactions.  There are no dose 
reductions for hypersensitivity reactions. 
 
MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE HYPERSENSITIVITY 
 
Severity of Symptoms  Treatment Guidelines  
Mild symptoms: localized cutaneous 
reactions such as mild pruritus, flushing, rash  · consider decreasing the rate of infusion until 
recovery f rom symptoms, stay at bedside and 
monitor patient  
· then, complete Taxotere infusion at the initial 
planned rate  
Moderate  symptoms: any symptom that is 
not listed above (mild symptoms) or below 
(severe symptoms) such as generalized 
pruritus, flushing, ras h, dyspnea, hypotension 
with systolic  
BP > 80 mm Hg  
 · interrupt Taxotere infusion  
· give diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with or without 
dexamethasone 10 mg IV; monitor patient until 
resolution of symptoms  
· resume Taxotere  infusion after recovery of 
symptoms; depending on the physician’s 
assessment of the patient, Taxotere infusion 
should be resumed at a slower rate, then 
increased incrementally to the initial planned 
rate, (eg. infuse at a 4 -hour rate for 3 minutes, 
then at a 2 -h rate for 3 minutes, then at a 1 -h 
rate for 3 minutes, then finally, resume at the 
initial planned rate.  
· depending on the intensity of the reaction 
observed, additional oral or IV premedication 
with an antihistamine should also be given for 
the next cycle  of treatment, and the rate of 
infusion should be decreased initially and then 
increased back to initial planned rate,  (eg. infuse 
at a 4 -hour rate for 3 minutes, then at a 2 -h rate 
for 3 minutes, then at a 1 -h rate for 3 minutes, 
and finally, adm inister at the initial planned rate.)  
Severe  symptoms: any reaction such as 
bronchospasm, generalized urticaria, systolic 
BP  80mm Hg, angioedema  · immediately discontinue Taxotere infusion  
· give diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with or without 
dexamethasone 10 mg IV and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_374090];  monitor patient until resolution of 
symptoms  
· the same treatment guidelines outlined under 
moderate symptoms (i.e. the third and fourth 
bullets) should be followed.  
Anaphylaxis (NCI grade 4 reaction)  · NO FURTHER STUDY DRUG THERAPY

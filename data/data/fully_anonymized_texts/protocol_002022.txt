1.0 Research Design
1.1 Purpose/Specific Aims
The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy of Aggrenox (Dipyridamole ER 200mg 
and Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 25mg), in brand or generic formulation,  in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection 
with symptoms consistent with COVID-19. For ease, we will identify the drug as Aggrenox, 
regardless of the formulation.
Among 132 SARS-CoV-2 patients (66 patients in each randomized arm), we will 
determine the efficacy of Aggrenox on clinical outcomes.
A.  Endpoints:
      Primary Endpoint:
Change in composite COVID ordinal scale at day 15. Ordinal scale: 1) not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_494314]; 2) not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], but unable to resume normal activities; 3) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], not requiring oxygen; 4) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], requiring oxygen; 5) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], requiring high-flow oxygen therapy, or noninvasive ventilation; 6) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], requiring invasive ventilation; 7) ventilation plus additional organ support such as vasopressors, renal replacement therapy and ECMO and 8) death.
Secondary Endpoints:
1) all-cause mortality assessed on day 15 and day 28. 
2) oxygen-free days through day 28. 3) invasive-ventilator-free days through day 28. 4) ICU-free days through day 28.5) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-free days through day 28. 6) increase in cycle threshold (Ct) of SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_635930] as an approximation of decline 
in viral load at days 7 and 15. 
7) decrease in the markers D-dimer/ ferritin/ c-reactive protein at days 7 and 15.8) thromboembolic complications including stroke at day 28.9) Change in COVID ordinal scale at day 28.10) When feasible urine will be analyzed for markers of tubular injury IL-18, kidney injury 
molecule-1 [KIM-1], neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin [NGAL]), inflammation (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 [MCP-1]), and repair (human cartilage glycoprotein-40 [YKL-40]
B.  Hypotheses / Research Question(s)Compared to standard care, addition of Aggrenox (Dipyridamole ER 200mg/ Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 25mg), to standard care will result in improvement in composite COVID ordinal scale at day 15. Additionally, combined Aggrenox (Dipyridamole ER 200mg/ Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 25mg orally/enterally), and standard care will reduce need for ventilation, length of mechanical ventilation, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577], ICU length of stay and improve survival more than standard care alone in SARS-CoV-2 patients.
1.2 Research Significance
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by [CONTACT_11550][INVESTIGATOR_18960] 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and which has recently evolved into a pandemic posing a serious

threat to public health worldwide.1,2. Thus, development of effective preventative and therapeutic 
interventions is paramount.
     Despi[INVESTIGATOR_253529], information about pathologic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 remains 
incomplete. Recent data suggests the role of exaggerated immune/inflammatory response and hypercoagulability as pathogenic mechanisms leading to clinical manifestations such as acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS), stroke and extrapulmonary multiorgan dysfunction.
[ADDRESS_635932] of care in the management of these patients.
4 The International society of thrombosis and hemostasis has recommended 
that all COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], irrespective of the severity of their illness, should be started on prophylactic dose of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH).
5 The Society 
of thrombosis and haemostasis research also recommended that all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_60992]-19 patients should receive pharmacological venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis unless contraindicated.
6 Recent literature shows that the risk of thromboembolism is higher in patients 
admitted to the ICU. For the patients admitted to the ICU or having additional risk factors for VTE such as BMI> 30mkg/m2, history of VTE or rapi[INVESTIGATOR_3408] D-dimer levels, high-risk prophylactic LMWH dosages twice daily should be considered.
[ADDRESS_635933] been suggested to provide 
additional benefits in COVID-19 patients.4 
Utilization of a therapeutic that can simultaneously intervene along multiple pathways (viral 
replication, inflammation, vasoconstriction, and coagulation) can dramatically improve patient 
outcomes.    
Adenosine  is a highly potent immunoregulatory nucleoside that interferes with inflammatory 
processes by [CONTACT_494369], slowing down the oxidative activity, preventing platelet aggregation, and reducing neutrophils adhesion and degranulation.
8,9 One mechanism to increase extracellular adenosine is to inhibit 
intracellular uptake of adenosine and thereby [CONTACT_7092][INVESTIGATOR_494315]-inflammatory properties. It has a wide-ranging effects on multiple organ systems by [CONTACT_494370].
9 Equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs) are nucleoside transporters that 
regulate the flux of endogenous nucleosides, nucleobases and therapeutic analogs.[ADDRESS_635934] emerged as a druggable target. ENT inhibitors are used to modulate nucleosides in a number of disease states including viral infections such as HIV
11, and tumors12.
     Dipyridamole (DIP)  is one such ENT inhibitor (specific for the major and ubiquitous 
nucleoside transporter ENT-1), that inhibits nucleoside (adenosine) uptake into the endothelial and other cells and has been shown to enhance the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory 
effect of adenosine .13 A recent study has shown that DIP increases extracellular adenosine 
levels and thereby [INVESTIGATOR_23897] a significant decrease in CD8+T-cell activation and decreased 
macrophage activation among persons with HIV-[ADDRESS_635935] additional therapeutic advantages to SARS-CoV-2 patients. DIP is a widely known phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor with antiplatelet
14 and vasodilatoratory15 effects . Of 
particular note, a recent screen of FDA approved drugs identified the ability of DIP to effectively

in vitro, and in a VSV-induced viral pneumonia model in vivo.18-20 Additional possible benefits 
could include the anti-inflammatory action and promotion of mucosal healing.21 It may also 
prevent acute injury and progressive fibrosis of the lung, heart, liver, and kidney.22 In one small 
clinical series of 12 patients (pre-print, not peer-reviewed data), the authors used DIP as a 
prophylactic anti-coagulation therapy and reported significantly increased platelet and lymphocyte counts and decreased D-dimer levels in comparison to control patients. Two weeks after initiation of DIP therapy 60% of their severe patients and all patients with mild disease were discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].

     Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_33930] a well-known anti-platelet drug with anti-inflammatory properties. Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_494316]-1 activity that is essential for generation of thromboxane A2. Thromboxane A2 is a potent vasoconstrictor that also induces platelet aggregation and release of proinflammatory proteins from platelet storage granules. The literature evidence suggests that aspi[INVESTIGATOR_494317]-release dipyridamole may be more suitable for preventing secondary stroke because, in addition to their antiplatelet actions, these drugs possess complementary anti-inflammatory properties.
23
     Thus, we hypothesize that Aggrenox (Dipyridamole ER 200mg/ Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 25mg 
orally/enterally), adjunctive therapy can be useful for SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_635937] of oral/enteral Aggrenox on clinical outcomes in patients with SARS-CoV. We will randomly assign 132 consenting participants to two treatment groups: 1) Aggrenox (Dipyridamole ER 200mg/ 
Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 25mg orally/enterally), + standard care and 2) standard care alone. We will collect 
demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological data. The patients would be followed daily for 
[ADDRESS_635938] day to follow up on the symptoms. 
1.2 Research Design and Methods
1: 1 Randomized design.Arm 1:  Aggrenox plus standard care. Participants will receive Aggrenox (Dipyridamole ER 
200mg/ Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 25mg orally/enterally), 2 times daily (FDA–recommended dose) starting on the 
day of enrollment for a total of [ADDRESS_635939] care.Arm 2:  Standard care. Participants will receive standard care starting on the day of enrollment 
for a total of [ADDRESS_635940] of oral Aggrenox (Dipyridamole ER 200mg/ Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 25mg orally/enterally), on clinical outcomes in patients with SARS-CoV-2. In this research proposal, we will randomly assign 132 consenting participants with diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 to two treatment groups: 1) Aggrenox (Dipyridamole ER 200mg/ Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 25mg orally/enterally) + standard care and 2) standard care alone.

obtained from interested subjects or authorized proxy to participate in the study. We do not anticipate problems with enrollment as sufficient number of COVID-19 patients are admitted at Rutgers-NJMS (approximately 2-5 new COVID-19 admissions daily, and total 18-20 patients who are currently admitted at Rutgers-NJMS with 5-6 patients in intensive care units).
Randomization.  The P.I. or study coordinator will review the screening and enroll participants 
in the randomization. Once a participant has been randomized, we will conduct all evaluations 
irrespective of whether the participant starts the treatment, and how long the participants 
continues on the treatment or not. SARS-CoV-2 patients will be allocated in a 1:1 randomized fashion using computer generated random sequence to one of two groups: the Aggrenox (Dipyridamole ER 200mg/ Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 25mg orally/enterally), plus standard care or the standard 
care. Data collection will end after 28 days, or the patient dies or withdraws consent.

3. Study Safety Assessments 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_153188]. 
Definitions: 
• Adverse Events: 
An adverse event is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the deterioration of 
a pre-existing medical condition following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, whether considered causally related to the product. An undesirable medical condition can be symptoms (e.g. nausea, chest pain), signs (e.g. tachycardia, enlarged liver) or the abnormal results of an investigation (e.g. laboratory findings, electrocardiogram). In clinical studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including run-in or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered. The term AE is used to include both serious and non- serious AEs. 
• Serious Adverse Events: 
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study phase (i.e., screening, run- in, treatment, wash-out, follow-up), at any dose of the study drugs that fulfills one or more of the following criteria and deemed secondary to the use of study drug: 
Results in death
Is immediately life-threatening
Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity
Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect
Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the patient or may require medical   intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
1.1.1 The causality of SAEs (their relationship to all study treatment/procedures) will be assessed by [CONTACT_093](s) and communicated to Boehringer Ingelheim ( BI) via BI 
SAE form and the FDA via MedWatch form, if applicable. 
      Causality will be reported as either “Yes” or “No”.
Yes: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product 
administered and the AE. 
No: There is no reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product 
administered and the AE.
2. Recording of Adverse Events

Pro#2020001469Protocol Version 6 Date: 4/18/[ADDRESS_635946], Suite 8100Newark, NJ [ZIP_CODE]
Non-serious adverse events and SAEs will be determined from the time the patient is enrolled 
into the study and up to and including the 2 weeks follow-up period (after the completion of 2 weeks of treatment with Aggrenox) for a total of [ADDRESS_635947] dose of trial drug and/or until event resolution. All new AEs occurring during that period must be recorded (if SAEs, they must be reported to the DSMB and Rutgers IRB as per SOPs.). AEs will be recorded per Rutgers IRB SOPs. The common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) will be used as a reference to grade the adverse events. 
(https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocoldevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/CTCAE_v5_Quick_R
eference_8.5x11.pdf (Accessed on March 09, 2018)
All study-related adverse events/ SAEs must be followed until resolution, unless in the Treating 
Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the condition is unlikely to resolve due to the patient’s underlying disease. 
3. Reporting of Serious Adverse EventsInvestigators and other site personnel must inform the Rutgers IRB per the SOPs on the 
required forms. FDA will be informed per SOP, via a MedWatch, of any serious or unexpected adverse events that occur in accordance with the reporting obligations of 21 CFR 312.32. It is the responsibility of the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_494318] a report according to the FDA reporting requirement timelines. 
In addition to FDA, the Sponsor shall report all SAEs and non-serious AEs that occur 
,throughout the treatment period and up to and including the 2 weeks follow-up period (after the completion of 2 weeks of treatment with Aggrenox) for a total of 28 days which are relevant for a reported SAEs and any AEs relevant to a reported SAE  by [CONTACT_494373] . 
For each adverse event, the investigator will provide the onset date, end date, causality, 
intensity,treatment required, outcome, seriousness, and action taken with the investigational drug. 
The investigator does not need to actively monitor patients for adverse events once the clinical 
trial has ended. However, if the investigator becomes aware of an SAE(s) that occurred after the patient has completed the clinical trial (including any protocol specified follow-up period), it should be reported to BI if investigator considers it as relevant to the BI study drug.
All SAEs meeting the criteria for expedited reporting will be reported to the Rutgers IRB within 
the mandated time frames. All SAEs within the safety follow-up window (e.g., within [ADDRESS_635948] dose of study medications) established in the protocol will be reported. 
Non-serious adverse events and SAEs will be collected from the time the patient is enrolled into 
the study, throughout the treatment period and up to and including the 2 weeks follow-up period (after the completion of 2 weeks of treatment with Aggrenox) for a total of [ADDRESS_635949] dose of trial drug and/or until event resolution. All new AEs 
Pro2020001469
            5/25/2021

Protocol Title: ATTAC-19 – Aggrenox To Treat Acute Covid-19 
Pro#2020001469Protocol Version 6 Date: 4/18/[ADDRESS_635950] be recorded (if SAEs, then they must be reported to the FDA 
as per their reporting criteria). All study-related toxicities/ SAEs must be followed until resolution, unless in the Treating Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the condition is unlikely to resolve due to the patient’s underlying disease. 
Clinical Safety Assessments 
•  Recording of Adverse Events 
Non-serious adverse events and SAEs will be determined from the time the study drug is given, 
throughout the treatment period and up to and including the [ADDRESS_635951] dose of trial drug and/or until event resolution. All new AEs occurring during that period must be recorded (if SAEs, they must be reported to the DSMB and Rutgers IRB as per SOPs.). AEs will be recorded per Rutgers IRB SOPs. 
•  Adverse Events Based on Signs and Symptoms
When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list 
of signs and symptoms. However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately. 
•  Vital Signs
Temperature will be obtained at least two times a day (AM and PM). Nursing staff will record the 
temperature while the patient is in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Body temperature will be measured in degrees Fahrenheit using an automated thermometer. An automated thermometer will be provided to the patient once discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_494319] a day for the study duration (28 days total from the enrollment day). 
Study Efficacy/Response Assessments 
Change in composite COVID ordinal scale at day 15. Ordinal scale: 1) not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_494314]; 2) not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], but unable to resume normal activities; 3) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], not requiring oxygen; 4) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], requiring oxygen; 5) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], requiring high-flow oxygen therapy, or noninvasive ventilation; 6) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], requiring invasive ventilation; 7) ventilation plus additional organ support such as pressors, renal replacement therapy and ECMO and 8) death.
Other response criteria used as secondary endpoints include the need of invasive ventilation, 
the days dependent on ventilator, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_176620], thromboembolic complications, COVID ordinal scale at day 28 and mortality.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action 
The antithrombotic action of AGGRENOX is the result of the additive antiplatelet effects of 
dipyridamole and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]. 
Dipyridamole 
Dipyridamole inhibits the uptake of adenosine into platelets, endothelial cells and erythrocytes in vitro and in vivo; the inhibition occurs in a dose-dependent manner at therapeutic concentrations (0.5–1.9 μg/mL). This inhibition results in an increase in local concentrations of adenosine which 
acts on the platelet A 2-receptor thereby [CONTACT_494375]-3',5'- adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. Via this mechanism, platelet aggregation is inhibited in response to various stimuli such as platelet activating factor (PAF), collagen and adenosine diphosphate (ADP). 
Dipyridamole inhibits phosphodiesterase (PDE) in various tissues. While the inhibition of cAMP-PDE 
is weak, therapeutic levels of dipyridamole inhibit cyclic-3',5'-guanosine monophosphate-PDE (cGMP- PDE), thereby [CONTACT_494376] (endothelium-derived relaxing factor, now identified as nitric oxide). 
Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_494324] A 2, a powerful inducer of platelet aggregation and 
vasoconstriction. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The effect of either agent on the other's inhibition of platelet reactivity has not been evaluated. 
Pharmacokinetics 
There are no significant interactions between aspi[INVESTIGATOR_494325]. The kinetics of the components are unchanged by [CONTACT_494377]-administration as AGGRENOX. 
Absorption

Pro#2020001469Protocol Version 6 Date: 4/18/[ADDRESS_635961], Suite 8100Newark, NJ [ZIP_CODE]
Peak plasma levels of dipyridamole are achieved 2 hours (range 1–6 hours) after administration 
of a daily dose of 400 mg AGGRENOX (given as 200 mg BID). The peak plasma concentration at steady- state is 1.98 μg/mL (1.01–3.99 μ g/mL) and the steady-state trough concentration is 
0.53 μg/mL (0.18– 1.01 μg/mL). 
Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]: 
Peak plasma levels of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_494326] 0.63 hours (0.5–1 hour) after administration of a 50 mg aspi[INVESTIGATOR_494327] (given as 25 mg BID). The peak plasma concentration at steady- state is 319 ng/mL (175–463 ng/mL). Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_494328], with 50%–75% of an administered dose reaching the systemic circulation as intact aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]. 
Effect of Food 
Dipyridamole: 
When AGGRENOX capsules were taken with a high fat meal, dipyridamole peak plasma levels (Cmax) and total absorption (AUC) were decreased at steady-state by 20-30% compared to 
fasting. Due to the similar degree of inhibition of adenosine uptake at these plasma concentrations, this food effect is not considered clinically relevant. 
Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]: 
When AGGRENOX capsules were taken with a high fat meal, there was no difference for aspi[INVESTIGATOR_494329]-state, and the approximately 50% decrease in C max was not 
considered clinically relevant based on a similar degree of cyclooxygenase inhibition comparing the fed and fasted state. 
Distribution 
Dipyridamole: 
Dipyridamole is highly lipophilic (log P=3.71, pH=7); however, it has been shown that the drug does not cross the blood-brain barrier to any significant extent in animals. The steady-state volume of distribution of dipyridamole is about 92 L. Approximately 99% of dipyridamole is bound to plasma proteins, predominantly to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and albumin. 
Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]: 
Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_494330] (10 L). Its metabolite, salicylic acid, is highly bound to plasma proteins, but its binding is concentration-dependent (nonlinear). At low concentrations (<100 mcg/mL), approximately 90% of salicylic acid is bound to albumin. Salicylic acid is widely distributed to all tissues and fluids in the body, including the central nervous system, breast milk, and fetal tissues. Early signs of salicylate overdose (salicylism), including tinnitus (ringing in the ears), occur at plasma concentrations approximating 200 mcg/mL. 
Metabolism and Elimination 
Dipyridamole: 
Dipyridamole is metabolized in the liver, primarily by [CONTACT_494378], of which monoglucuronide which has low pharmacodynamic activity is the primary metabolite. In plasma,

Pro#2020001469Protocol Version 6 Date: 4/18/[ADDRESS_635962], Suite 8100Newark, NJ [ZIP_CODE]
about 80% of the total amount is present as parent compound and 20% as monoglucuronide. 
Most of the glucuronide metabolite (about 95%) is excreted via bile into the feces, with some evidence of enterohepatic circulation. Renal excretion of parent compound is negligible and urinary excretion of the glucuronide metabolite is low (about 5%). With intravenous (i.v.) treatment of dipyridamole, a triphasic profile is obtained: a rapid alpha phase, with a half-life of about 3.4 minutes, a beta phase, with a half- life of about 39 minutes, (which, together with the alpha phase accounts for about 70% of the total area under the curve, AUC) and a prolonged elimination phase λz with a half-life of about 15.5 hours. Because of the extended absorption
phase of the dipyridamole component, only the terminal phase is apparent from oral treatment with AGGRENOX which was 13.6 hours. 
Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]: 
Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_494331], with a half-life of 20 minutes. Plasma levels of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_494332] 2–2.5 hours after dosing and peak salicylic acid concentrations occur 1 hour (range: 0.5–2 hours) after administration of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]. Salicylic acid is primarily conjugated in the liver to form salicyluric acid, a phenolic glucuronide, an acyl glucuronide, and a number of minor metabolites. Salicylate metabolism is saturable and total body clearance decreases at higher serum concentrations due to the limited ability of the liver to form both salicyluric acid and phenolic glucuronide. Following toxic doses (10–20 g), the plasma half-life may be increased to over [ADDRESS_635963]-order kinetics with AGGRENOX and has a half- life of 0.33 hours. The half-life of salicylic acid is 1.71 hours. Both values correspond well with data from the literature at lower doses which state a resultant half-life of approximately 2–3 hours. At higher doses, the elimination of salicylic acid follows zero-order kinetics (i.e., the rate of elimination is constant in relation to plasma concentration), with an apparent half-life of 6 hours or higher. Renal excretion of unchanged drug depends upon urinary pH. As urinary pH rises above 6.5, the renal clearance of free salicylate increases from <5% to >80%. Alkalinization of the urine is a key concept in the management of salicylate overdose [see Overdosage (10)]. Following therapeutic doses, about 10% is excreted as salicylic acid and 75% as salicyluric acid, as the phenolic and acyl glucuronides, in urine. 
Specific Populations 
Geriatric Patients: 
Dipyridamole: 
In ESPS2 [see Clinical Studies (14)], plasma concentrations (determined as AUC) of dipyridamole in healthy elderly subjects (>65 years) were about 40% higher than in subjects younger than 55 years receiving treatment with AGGRENOX. 
Hepatic Dysfunction: 
No study has been conducted with AGGRENOX in patients with hepatic dysfunction. 
Dipyridamole: 
In a study conducted with an intravenous formulation of dipyridamole, patients with mild to severe hepatic insufficiency showed no change in plasma concentrations of dipyridamole but showed an increase in the pharmacologically inactive monoglucuronide metabolite. Dipyridamole can be dosed without restriction as long as there is no evidence of hepatic failure.

Dipyridamole: 
In ESPS2 patients [see Clinical Studies (14)], with creatinine clearances ranging from about 15

Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]: 
Avoid aspi[INVESTIGATOR_494334] (glomerular filtration rate <10 mL/min). Drug Interaction Studies 
A dedicated drug interaction study was conducted in 60 healthy volunteers to evaluate the effects of omeprazole 80 mg administered once daily on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of dipyridamole and the pharmacodynamics (PD) of acetylsalicylic acid when co-administered with AGGRENOX twice daily. Dipyridamole exposure (C max and AUC) at steady-state were similar 
with or without omeprazole co- administration. The pharmacokinetics of acetylsalicylic acid was not characterized. However, the antiplatelet activity as measured by [CONTACT_494379]-state. 
NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY
Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility 
In studies in which dipyridamole was administered in the feed to mice (up to 111 weeks in males and females) and rats (up to 128 weeks in males and up to 142 weeks in females), there was no evidence of drug-related carcinogenesis. The highest dose administered in these studies (75 mg/kg/day) was, on a 2 mg/m basis, about equivalent to the maximum recommended daily human oral dose(MRHD )in mice and about twice the MRHD in rats. 
Combinations of dipyridamole and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (1:5 ratio) tested negative in the Ames test, in vivo chromosome aberration tests (in mice and hamsters), oral micronucleus tests (in mice and hamsters) and oral dominant lethal test (in mice). Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], alone, induced chromosome aberrations in cultured human fibroblasts. Mutagenicity tests of dipyridamole alone with bacterial and mammalian cell systems were negative. 
Combinations of dipyridamole and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_494335]. There was no evidence of impaired fertility when dipyridamole was 
administered to male and female rats at oral doses up to 500 mg/kg/day (about 12 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis). A significant reduction in number of corpora lutea with consequent reduction in implantations and live fetuses was, however, observed at 1250 mg/kg (more than 30 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis).

4.7Risks of Harm/Potential for Benefits to Subjects
A. Description of Risks of Harm to Subjects
Reasonably Foreseeable Risks of Harm (this data I got from Aggrenox product 
information available online- Appendix is attached for your review)) 
Risk of BleedingAGGRENOX increases the risk of bleeding. 
Risk factors for bleeding include the use of other drugs that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, heparin, anagrelide, fibrinolytic therapy, and chronic use of NSAIDs). 
Intracranial Hemorrhage In European Stroke Prevention Study-2 (ESPS2), the annualized event 
rate for intracranial hemorrhage was 0.39%/year in the AGGRENOX group, 0.26%/year in the extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP) group, 0.24%/year in the aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (ASA) group, and 0.29%/year in the placebo groups. 
Gastrointestinal (GI) Side Effects 
GI side effects include stomach pain, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and gross GI bleeding. Although minor upper GI symptoms, such as dyspepsia, are common and can occur anytime during therapy, physicians should remain alert for signs of ulceration and bleeding, even in the absence of previous GI symptoms. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of GI side effects and what steps to take if they occur. In ESPS2, the annualized event rate for gastrointestinal bleeding was 2.97%/year in the AGGRENOX group, 1.58%/year in the extended-release dipyridamole group, 2.06%/year in the aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34209], and 1.40%/year in the placebo groups. 
Peptic Ulcer Disease 
Avoid using aspi[INVESTIGATOR_494344] a history of active peptic ulcer disease, which can cause gastric mucosal irritation and bleeding. 
Alcohol Warning 
Because AGGRENOX contains aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], counsel patients who consume three or more alcoholic drinks every day about the bleeding risks involved with chronic, heavy alcohol use while taking aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]. 
Renal Failure 
Avoid aspi[INVESTIGATOR_494334] (glomerular filtration rate less than 10 mL/minute) [see Use in Specific Populations. 
Hepatic Insufficiency 
Elevations of hepatic enzymes and hepatic failure have been reported in association with dipyridamole administration.
Coronary Artery Disease

Hypotension 
Dipyridamole produces peripheral vasodilation, which can exacerbate pre-existing hypotension.
Stress Testing with Intravenous Dipyridamole and Other Adenosinergic Agents 
Clinical experience suggests that patients being treated with AGGRENOX capsules who also require pharmacological stress testing with intravenous dipyridamole or other adenosinergic agents (e.g. adenosine, regadenoson) should interrupt AGGRENOX capsules for [ADDRESS_635981]. 
Drug Interaction Study Information Obtained From LiteratureAdenosinergic agents (e.g. adenosine, regadenoson)
Dipyridamole has been reported to increase the plasma levels and cardiovascular effects of adenosine. Adjustment of adenosine dosage may be necessary. Dipyridamole also increases the cardiovascular effects of regadenoson, an adenosine A2A-receptor agonist. The potential risk of cardiovascular side effects with intravenous adenosinergic agents may be increased during the testing period when dipyridamole is not held 48 hours prior to stress testing. 
Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors 
Because of the indirect effect of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_494348]-angiotensin conversion pathway, the hyponatremic and hypotensive effects of ACE inhibitors may be diminished by [CONTACT_95042][INVESTIGATOR_248]. 
Acetazolamide 
Concurrent use of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_494349] (and toxicity) due to competition at the renal tubule for secretion. 
Anticoagulants and Antiplatelets 
Patients taking AGGRENOX in combination with anticoagulants, antiplatelets, or any substance impacting coagulation are at increased risk for bleeding. Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_494350], leading to prolongation of both the prothrombin time and the bleeding time. Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_494351], increasing bleeding risk. 
Anagrelide 
Patients taking aspi[INVESTIGATOR_494352]. 
Anticonvulsants 
Salicylic acid can displace protein-bound phenytoin and valproic acid, leading to a decrease in the total concentration of phenytoin and an increase in serum valproic acid levels.

Diuretics 
The effectiveness of diuretics in patients with underlying renal or cardiovascular disease may be diminished by [CONTACT_494394][INVESTIGATOR_494353], leading to decreased renal blood flow and salt and fluid retention. 
Methotrexate 
Salicylate can inhibit renal clearance of methotrexate, leading to bone marrow toxicity, especially in the elderly or renal impaired. 
Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) 
The concurrent use of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_494354]. 
Oral Hypoglycemics 
Moderate doses of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_494355], leading to hypoglycemia. 
Uricosuric Agents (probenecid and sulfinpyrazone) 
Salicylates antagonize the uricosuric action of uricosuric agents.

Procedures which Risk Harm to Embryo, Fetus, and/or Pregnant Subjects
Pregnancy Risk Summary 
Available data from published studies and postmarketing experience with AGGRENOX use 
during pregnancy have not identified a clear association between AGGRENOX use and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data). AGGRENOX contains low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_494357] (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, there were adverse developmental effects with administration of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_494358] [ADDRESS_635986] revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus up to doses about 25 times the maximum recommended daily human dose of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]/dipyridamole. Nonclinical data are suggestive of a possible potentiation of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]-related fetal toxicity when combined with dipyridamole (see Data). 
The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated 
population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4 and 15-20%, respectively. 
Clinical Considerations 
Labor and Delivery 
AGGRENOX, which contains dipyridamole and low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], increases the risk for bleeding.

Pro#2020001469Protocol Version 6 Date: 4/18/[ADDRESS_635987] not identified a clear association between aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]-dipyridamole use in pregnancy and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. However, these studies cannot definitively establish the absence of any aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]-dipyridamole associated risks. Methodological limitations of these studies include variability in the timing and dose of drug exposure (e.g., most exposures occurred beyond the first trimester) and the small sample sizes of individual studies. 
Animal Data Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_494359] (spi[INVESTIGATOR_113163], exencephaly, microphthalmia and 
coelosomia) and rabbits (congested fetuses, agenesis of skull and upper jaw, generalized edema with malformation of the head, and diaphanous skin) at oral doses of 330 mg/kg/day and 110 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses, which also resulted in a high resorption rate in rats (63% of implantations versus 5% in controls), are, on a mg/m basis, about [ADDRESS_635988] been performed in mice, rabbits and rats at oral doses of up to 125 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg, and 1000 mg/kg, respectively (about 1½, 2, and 25 times the maximum recommended daily human oral dose, respectively, on a mg/m basis) and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to dipyridamole. When 330 mg aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]/kg/day was combined with 75 mg dipyridamole/kg/day in the rat at doses about 66 and 2 times, respectively, the maximum recommended daily human dose, the resorption rate approached 100%. 
Lactation Risk Summary 
Based on data from a clinical lactation study in breastfeeding women taking low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], the metabolite salicylic acid is present in human milk in low levels (see Data). Dipyridamole is also present in human milk. There is no information on the effects of AGGRENOX or dipyridamole on the breastfed infant or on milk production. There is insufficient information to determine the effects of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_494360]. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for AGGRENOX and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from AGGRENOX or from the underlying maternal condition. 
Data 
A published clinical study involved six exclusively breastfeeding women at 1 to 8 months postpartum who were taking 81 mg aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34223]. Milk samples were collected at steady state, at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after taking a dose of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]. Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_494361]. Salicylic acid was present in milk at low levels (average concentration of 24 ng/mL). Based on an average milk consumption of 150 mL/kg/day, the calculated relative infant dose was 0.4%. No adverse effects on the breastfed infants were noted.

6.3 Data and Safety Monitoring
A. Data/Safety Monitoring Plan
The Principal Investigators will be responsible for monitoring the data, assuring protocol compliance, and conducting the safety reviews at the specified frequency, which must be conducted at a minimum of once a month (including when re-approval of the protocol is sought). The Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey’s Human Research Oversight Committee (HROC) will be the DSMB of record. During the review process, the principal investigators (serving as monitor) will evaluate whether the study should continue unchanged, require modification/amendment, or close to enrollment. Either principal investigator, IRB or either Data or Safety Monitoring Committee have the authority to stop or suspend the study or require modifications at each institution. The PIs will be responsible for sharing this information in a timely fashion and coordinating appropriate parallel actions at the other institution. 
An audit will be conducted following enrollment of the first two (2) or three (3) patients. 
Subsequent audits will occur dependent on the rate of enrollment. More frequent audits of patient data and study conduct will occur if necessary. Prior audit findings and/or situations that may arise during the study will determine the need for more frequent auditing. All audit findings will be discussed with the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_494365].

The Human Research Oversight Committee (HROC) is responsible for oversight of protocol progress, conduct, and compliance. The Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey’s Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) activities fall under the purview of HROC. In order to ensure the execution of the protocol with a minimum number of obstacles, the HROC focuses on the following objectives: 
•  Monitor data and safety of CINJ investigator-initiated trials, including serious adverse events 
(SAE), enrollment progress, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], etc. 
•  Review the safety of all trials conducted at CINJ. 
•  Review enrollment to cooperative group and industry-sponsored studies. •  Review study compliance through deviation reports of all trials, Quality Assurance (QA) 
audit reports of CINJ investigator-initiated trials and external monitoring reports of all trials. 
•  Conduct response review for investigator-initiated trials.

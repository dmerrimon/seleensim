Prolonged, complicated, and intensive cancer treatment regimens challenge and disrupt the entire 
family (Alderfer & Kazak, 2006 ; Faulkner &  Davey, 2002 ) Adolescents and young adults who 
are the child of or sibling to an immediate family member with cancer  are a psychosocially at -
risk and underserved group. Siblings of youth with cancer  frequently report strong negative 
emotions, disruptions to family life, poorer academic functioning, more school absenteeism 
(school -aged siblings), and riskier  health behaviors and poorer health outcomes than 
comparisons (adult siblings) (Long et al., 201 8). Similarly, adolescent and young adult children 
affected by [CONTACT_146145], depression, low self -esteem, poor health -related

Version:  November 2019  quality of life, and higher school absenteeism (Walczak et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2022). 
Approximately one -quarter of siblings (Kaplan et al., 2013) and one quarter of children (Egberts 
et al., 2022) of individuals with cancer meet diagnostic criteria for cancer -related posttraumatic 
stress disorders (PTSD ). Additionally, both siblings  and children of immediate fa mily members 
with cancer  report feelings of isolation  and indicate a strong desire to connect with peers with 
similar experiences  (Long et al., 2018 ; Geertz et al., 2023 ). The need psychosocial supports for 
siblings of children with cancer (Gerhardt et al. , 2015)  and children of parents with cancer (Ohan 
et al., 2020)  is well established . Unfortunately, the se supports are not routinely available in 
clinical practice (Davis et al., 2022; Alexander et al., 2019) and the psychosocial needs of 
adolescents and y oung adultsh affected by [CONTACT_146146]’s cancer remain largely 
unmet  (Patterson et al., 2014; Ohan et al., 2020 ). 
The present study aims to address barriers to psychosocial care for siblings and children of 
individuals with cancer  by [CONTACT_146147] g a group -based telehealth program with an accompanying 
parent session. In Phase 1 of the present study, study staff will interview a diverse sample of 
English - and Spanish -speaking families and psychosocial providers to assess preferences for 
program cont ent, format,  timing, and cultural feasibility and acceptability, while considering 
ideas to minimize participation barriers. In Phase 2, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_146106] a small group of families located in [LOCATION_005] , Rhode Island , and/or

Children  or young adults  diagnosed with cancer are not eligible to participate in the present 
study. Only siblings or children of an immediate family member diagnosed children with 
cancer are eligible to participate . The present study involves youth and young adults ages 12 
to 30  in Phase 1 and only youth 12 -17 in Phase 2 . 
Phase 1 (Development of the SibACCESS Teleheal th Program)  
In Phase 1, youth/young adults  and parents will complete qualitative interviews with a 
member of the research team in their primary language (English or Spanish). A member of the 
research team will explain to the participant Phase 1 study detai ls (e.g., details regarding 
purpose of the qualitative interview) in developmentally -appropriate language and in their 
native language (Spanish or English). Staff will emphasize that study participation is 
voluntary. Participants will be given ample time t o ask questions and decide whether or not to 
  
    
 
13 
Version:  November [ADDRESS_167407] one parent indicate their 
consent for the youth’s participation in the qualitative interview and the youth will be asked to 
provide verbal a ssent (see Phase 1  Verbal Consent  Form and Phase 1 Child  Verbal Assent 
Form ). Young adults who are ages 18 -30 will co mplete their own consent form if they choose 
to participate (see Phase 1  Verbal Consent  Form) .During interviews, interviewers will 
attempt to minimize distress associated with discussion of sensitive topi[INVESTIGATOR_146109] -iterating to participants  that they are not required to answer 
questions that they are uncomfo rtable answering. No greater than minimal risk is present for 
participants in this research study.  
Phase 2 (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_146108])  
In Phase 2, families  will be enrolled in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_146110]/post-quantitative measures and  qualitative exit interview s. A member of the 
research team will explain Phase 2 study details (e.g., how many meetings are included in the 
program, who will be at the meeting, what information might be covered in the meetings , the 
purpose of the qualitative exit interview, etc.)  to the sibling  and parent  participant s. At leas t 
one parent will indicate  their consent for the sibling’s participation in the SibACCESS pi[INVESTIGATOR_146111] , and siblings will be asked  to provide verbal assent (see Phase 2 
SibACCESS Altered Consent Script [REDCap] and Phase 2 SibACCESS Sibling Assent 
Script [REDCap] ). 
As in Phase 1, study staff conducting Phase 2 qualitative exit interviews with siblings and 
parents  will attempt to mini mize distress associated with discussion of sensitive topi[INVESTIGATOR_146112] -iterating to particpants  that they are not required to 
answer questions that make them uncomfortable to answer.  
Phase 1 and Phase 2 (Pertaining to the Discl osure of Mental Health Risk)

SECTION J:  RECRUITMENT  
Provide a summary of the recruitment process, including who will recruit, when and 
where recruitment will occur, and how subjects will be identified  
 
Submit  all recruitment materials (e.g. advertisements, brochures, flyers, letters/e -mails, 
scripts, etc. ) as separate documents in either Word or PDF format.  
Families will be recruited in four ways. First, [LOCATION_011] University study staff will re -contact 
[CONTACT_146149] -contact[CONTACT_146150]. Families may only participate in phase 1 or phase 2 of the present 
study  (not both) . Second, [LOCATION_011] University study staff will recruit from the pediatric 
oncology service  within health care centers  to ensure the inclusion of culturally diverse 
families and those who are receiving active cancer treatment. These sites (e.g., Da na Farber 
Cancer Institute) will serve as recruitment -only sites and will not be involved in consenting or 
data collection.  Third, [LOCATION_011] University study staff will recruit from a contact [CONTACT_146151] 
  
    
 
16 
Version:  November 2019  by [CONTACT_146152]’s Lemonade Stand Foundation. Finally , [LOCATION_011] University study staff will use other 
forms of community outreach to reach families who would otherwise not be aware of the 
study through the two recruitment methods described above. This may include social media 
postings in order to communicate informatio n about the present study  (see Phase 1 and Phase 
2 Social Media Phrasing  document).  
Phase 1 (Development of the SibACCESS Telehealth Program)  
For previous participants (families and providers) for whom we have email addresses, we will 
send an  email outlin ing the present study’s purpose and details (e.g., outline qualitative 
interview process) (see Phase 1 Young Adult – Study Details Email,  Phase 1 Family Study 
Details Email and Phase 1 Provider Study Details Email ). In addition to study details, the 
email will indicate to families and providers that they should expect follow -up telephone 
outreach from [LOCATION_011] University study st aff, unless they “opt -out” of further contact [CONTACT_146153] 1 -week. Families and providers who do not opt -
out will be eligible to be contact[CONTACT_146154], telephone call, and/or email  by [CONTACT_146155] 1 -week opt -out period has elapsed.   
For previous participants (families and providers) for whom we have email addresses, we will 
send an  email outlin ing the present study’s purpose and details (e.g., outline qualitative 
interview process) (see Phase 1 Young Adult – Study Details Email,  Phase 1 Family Study 
Details Email and Phase 1 Provider Study Details Email ). In addition to study  details, the 
email will indicate to families and providers that they should expect follow -up telephone 
outreach from [LOCATION_011] University study st aff, unless they “opt -out” of further contact [CONTACT_146153] 1 -week. Families a nd providers who do not opt -
out will be eligible to be contact[CONTACT_146154], telephone call, and/or email  by [CONTACT_146155] 1 -week opt -out period has elapsed.   
For previous participants (families and providers) for whom we only have telephone numbers 
(and no email addresses) or for whom the email address proves to be outdated  (e.g., delivery 
failure message is received) , we will reach out by [CONTACT_146156] ( see Phase 1  Family Telephone Script and Eligibility Screen and Phase 1 
Provider Telephone Script and Eligibility Screen ). 
For families recruited from Alex’s Lemonade Stand foundation, we will mail and /or email an  
informational letter regar ding the present study ( ALSF Recruitment Letter  (Mail Ver sion) 
and ALSF Recruitment Letter (Email Version) ) to those for whom we have contact 
[CONTACT_3031]. Approximately 2 weeks after the mailing and/or emailing of the letters, [LOCATION_011] 
University study staff will reach out via telephone to gauge family interest in  hearing more 
about the student and to determine eligibility (Phase 1 Family Telephone Script and 
Eligibility Screen ). 
  
    
 
17 
Version:  November 2019  Families recruited from the pediatric oncology service within healthcare centers will need to 
“opt-in” to be contact[CONTACT_146157]. Families may be approached by 
[CONTACT_146158] a clinic visit and given a brief overview of the study , 
or they may receive information about the study from newsletters, fliers, or other media . 
Families interested in study participation will be directed to independently complete an online 
consent -to-contact [CONTACT_146159] (see Consent -to-
Contact [CONTACT_146160] ) or to call study staff to indicate their i nterest in learning more 
about the study . Families who complete the consent -to-contact [CONTACT_982], can be contact [CONTACT_146161] a time for an eligibility screen (see Phase 1 
Family Study Details Email [Opt -In Famili es] 5.03.2021 ).  
[LOCATION_011] University study staff will contact [CONTACT_146162] (see Phase 1  Family 
Telephone Script and Eligibility Screen and Phase 1 Provi der Telephone Script and 
Eligibility Screen ). ). For youth under the age of 18, p arents will answer eligibility questions 
about the family and the Child Posttraumatic Stress Scale for DSM -5 (as part of the eligibility 
screen) will be administered verbally to the youth . Young adults ages 18 -30 will answer 
eligibility questions themselves and will be verbally administered the Posttraumatic 
Diagnostic Scale for DSM -5 (to assess eligibility).  Eligible families and providers will then be 
scheduled to complete a qualitative interview (Phase 1). Note that , in cases where a parent or 
guardian is enrolled, that parent or guardian  may or may not be a parent or guardian of the 
child with cance r, and may or may not be a parent/guardian with cancer. According  to 
purposive sampling procedures that are considered the “gold standard” of qualitative research, 
we will occasionally review the characteristics of enrolled participants and target future 
recruitment activities to ensure breadth in our sample. Purposive sampling for families will be 
based on youth/young adult age, youth/young adult gender , family race/ethnicity, and cancer 
treatment status (i.e., on/off active treatment).  Note that we will collect information about 
these purposive sampling variables withi n the phone screen and will explain to 
parents/guardians  and or young adults  the reason for collecting this information.  
Phase 2 (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_146108])  
Families being re -contact[CONTACT_146163] , for whom we have email addresses,  will first 
receive an emailing outlining the present study’s purpose and details regarding a pi[INVESTIGATOR_146115] ( e.g., length of each individual session, information on the group format, etc.; 
see Phase 2  SibACCESS Family Study Details Email ). Similar  to recruitment procedure for 
Phase 1, it will be indicated to families that they should expect telephone outreach from the 
[LOCATION_011] University study staff, unless they “opt -out” of this telephone outreach by [CONTACT_146164] 1 -week. Families who do not opt -out will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] a 
maximum of 10 times via text, telephone call, and/or email.

As with Phase 1, families recruited from the pediatric oncology service within healthcare 
centers for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_146116] (Phase 2) need to “opt -in” to be contact[CONTACT_146165]. Families may be approached by [CONTACT_146166] 
a clinic visit and given a brief overview of the study , or they may receive information about 
the study from newsletters, fliers, or other media . Families interested in study participation 
will be directed to independently complete a n online consent -to-contact [CONTACT_146167] (see Phase [ADDRESS_167411] Page ) 
or to call study staff to indicate their interest in learning more about the study .  
For families recruited from Alex’s Lemo nade Stand foundation, we will mail and/or email an 
informational letter regarding the present study ( Phase 2 ALSF Recruitment Mailer  and 
Phase 2 ALSF Recruitment) to those for whom we have contact [CONTACT_3031]. Approximately 
1 week after the mailing and/or  emailing of the letters, [LOCATION_011] University study staff will 
reach out via telephone (text or call) and email to gauge family interest in hearing more about 
the student and to determine eligibility (Phase 2  Family Telephone Script and Eligibility 
Screen ). 
[LOCATION_011] University study staff will contact [CONTACT_146168] (see Phase 2  SibACCESS  Family 
Telephone Script and Eligibility Screen ). Parents will answer eligibility ques tions , and the 
Child Posttraumatic Stress Scale for DSM -5 (as part of eligibility screen) will be administered 
verbally to the sibling. Eligible families will then be  provided with a link from which to 
complete consent and assesnt forms,  quantitative stud y measures, and they will be  scheduled 
to participate in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_146117] a qualitative exit interview (Phase 2).  
Additional Recruitment Procedure for Phase 1 and 2  
Additionally, information regarding the present study will be shared with clinicians and 
families at healthcare centers via listings in newsletters and resource lists (see Phase 2 
SibACCESS  Brief Advertisement  and Phase 2 SibACCESS Website Text and Full-
Length  Advertisement  Document). Additional outreach may occur vi a fliers, emails, or other

Phase 1 (Development of the Sibling Telehealth Program)  
Potentially eligible families and providers will be contact[CONTACT_146172] a 15 to 30 -minute eligibility screen (see Phase 1  Family Telephone Script and 
Eligibility Screen  and Phase 1 Provider Telephone Script and Eligibility Screen ). If a family 
is found to be eligible, the youth/young adults and  parent (s) (if applicable)  each will be 
scheduled to complete a qualitative interview. Par ticipants will participate in  a 60 to 75 -minute 
remote qualitative interview via the Zoom platform (audio -recording only).  Young adults, 
parents and providers will also complete a brief background form via Qualtrics to collect cancer -
related information, demographic information, and information about posttraumatic stress 
symptoms in response to  immediate family member’s  cancer  (see Family Background Form  
and Provider Background Form ). Qualitative data collection and interim analyses will be 
iterative, with  findings from earlier interviews incorporated into the evolving interview guide 
(see Sample Interview Questions ) and SibACCESS  program description until thematic 
saturation is reached (i.e., when interviews no longer yield new information).  
For providers re-contact[INVESTIGATOR_70787] 5019E study: Responses to the following demographic 
interview questions will be shared with study staff of protocol 5870E, if a provider is re -
contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], consented (including a question on whether they agree to their information being  
shared across studies), and enrolled in the new study. The sharing of this information across 
studies will prevent this specific group of providers from needing to answer demographic 
questions for which they have answered in the past 2 years. Additionally , if a provider does not 
consent to this demographic information being shared across the 5019E and 5870E studies, they 
will be re -asked demographic questions such as those listed below as part of semi -structured 
qualitative interview procedures.  
 
1. Tell me a little bit about the role you play in the provision of psychosocial support 
to families  of individuals  with cancer.  
a. What is your professional title?   
b. What is your discipline (e.g., child life specialist, social worker, psychologist, 
psychiatris t, nurse, oncologist)?    
 
2. Tell me about your center.   
a. Is your center located within a free -standing children’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6879] a university 
medical center?   
b. Do you have trainees (e.g., child life specialist trainees?)   
  
    
 
26 
Version:  November 2019  c. How many new childhood cancer patients does your center serve annually?  
d. Does your center care for hematopoietic cell transplant patients and their families?   
e. What percentage of patients travel >50 miles to receive care?  
f. How many psychosocial providers do you employ (full or part -time)?  
g. How are psychosocial providers supported – e.g., are they salaried? Do they bill for 
services?  
h. How would describe your patient demographics?  
ii. (E.g., primarily rural/urban, largely international, large/small percentage of 
racial/ethnic minority families, high/low percentage of non -English speakers, 
low/high -SES, (not) very religious)?  
 
Interviews will be recorded  and transcribed verbatim  in one of two ways: 1) using a password 
protected account on Amazon Transcribe or 2) by [CONTACT_146173]. Only approved study staff  will have access to the Amazon 
Transcribe account. Audio recordings will be temporarily uploaded to the account for 
transcription (a process that takes approximate ly an hour) and then deleted from the account 
immediately following transcription. All transcripts (whether transcribed by a n approved study 
staff member  or Amazon Transcribe) will be reviewed a second time by a study staff member  to 
check for accuracy and  ensure that all potentially identifying information has been removed. All 
transcripts will be labeled with unique participant ID numbers. Audio recordings will be moved 
to the limited -access folder after transcription is complete. Audio recordings will be  kept until 
data analysis is complete in case it is necessary to reference the original recording to clarify 
information during analysis. Study data will be retained for 7 years. Identifying information 
about families who are not eligible or decline partic ipation will be destroyed.  Spanish transcripts 
will be translated into English . All transcripts will be entered into a qualitative software 
program, NVivo  to facilitate coding and analysis. Information from the interviews will be used 
to inform content, formatting, and feasibility of the  telehealth pi[INVESTIGATOR_146124] -
related trauma symptoms . 
Phase 2 (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_146108])  
Please Note: While multiple eligible siblings can be enrolled from each family in the present 
study, only one sibling per family will be enrolled in each cohort of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_146119] 
(e.g., one sibling per cohort of the SibACCESS pi[INVESTIGATOR_29426]).  
Potentially eligible families will be contact[CONTACT_66179] a 15 to 30 -minute eligibility screen 
(see Phase 2  SibACCESS  Family Telephone and Eligibility Screen ). Eligible families (one 
parent and a n eligible ) will be enrolled to participate in a sibling -focused pi[INVESTIGATOR_146125]’ exposure to cancer -related cues and opportunities to 
process those cues. The program will consist of 1 preliminary family joining session, a parent -
focused educational webinar, and 9 sib ling intervention sessions (7 group sessions, 1 individual 
session, and 1 parent check -in). Group sessions will include between [ADDRESS_167416] -traumatic 
  
    
 
27 
Version:  November [ADDRESS_167417] -session surveys after each program session ( Phase [ADDRESS_167418] -Session Survey 
03.06.2023 ) Parents and siblings will complete a battery of quantitative measures pre - and post -
intervention. Should a parent/sibling need assistance in  completing measures, a member of the 
study staff will have access to their study record in REDCap and can assist the family in 
completion of measures via Zoom at the family’s request. Should the primary caregiver be 
unavailable for one or more of the prog ram sessions involving parents, a n alternate supportive 
adult can consent to participation limited to those sessions . A supportive adult who has 
consented to limited participation (participation limited only to sessions where parent 
involvement is needed),  may be asked to complete brief exit interview 30 -45 minutes regarding 
their experience with the program. The potential for exit interview will be based on the number 
of sessions the alternate supportive adult attended in support of the enrolled sibling.   
Upon completion of the program, enrolled members of families (parents and siblings) also will 
complete 30 -45 minute exit interviews ( Sample Exit Interview Questions ). Interviews will be 
recorded and transcribed verbatim using one of two methods described a bove

Phase 2: SibACCESS Program Description  
SibACCESS  (Acceptance, Copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], Communication, Engagement, and Social Support) targets 
the proposed mechanisms of sibling difficulties. The primary goal is to increase siblings’ 
exposure and opportunities to process cancer -related cues to decrease the onset or intensif ication 
of posttraumatic stress (PTS). Treatment targets include emotion awareness, emotional 
acceptance / distress tolerance, adaptive thinking, family communication (via between -session 
assignments), and social support (fostered by [CONTACT_146174]).   
 
SibACCESS is based on acceptance -based cognitive -behavioral frameworks, drawing primarily 
on trauma -focused CBT (TF -CBT). TF -CBT is a structured, short -term treatment that 
incorporates cognitive -behavioral approaches to promote recovery from trauma. It is a logical 
starting point for the present study for multiple reasons: (a) TF -CBT was developed specifically 
for children and adolescents; parent participation is recommended but not required; (b) it has 
been tested in a group format  and using telehealth ; (c) it has demonstrated effectiveness across 
cultural groups; and (d) it is appropriate for youth who meet diagnostic criteria for PTSD and 
those with sub -clinical PTS. T F-CBT has not yet been evaluated in the context of childhood 
cancer. To better match the needs of siblings of youth with cancer specifically, we also 
incorporated skills from Dialectical and Behavioral Therapy (i.e., self -validation of emotions,  
mindfulne ss, radical acceptance) to better address distress tolerance and acceptance of the 
aspects of cancer that are beyond siblings’ control.  
 
SibACCESS group sessions will be facilitated remotely using Zoom. The intervention includes a 
preliminary joining sess ion, one parent -focused educational webinar, seven group sibling 
  
    
 
30 
Version:  November 2019  sessions, one individual sibling session, and one parent check -in. The parent webinar will 
provide a program overview, psychoeducation about sibling functioning in the context of cancer, 
and brief skills training. Parents will be given “discussion starter” questions to facilitate 
communication throughout the program. Sibling group sessions are approximately [ADDRESS_167421] week’s homework, introductio n of new topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102], 
interactive practice of new skills, and assignment of home practice. Exposure to cancer -related 
emotions and cues will be emphasized across all program sessions; in addition to emotion 
exposures and cancer -related sibling narratives, sibli ngs will confront information about cancer, 
uncomfortable thoughts and feelings, and communication about cancer throughout the program.

Version:  November 2019  participating may experience emotional discomfort answering questions and discussing their 
famil y’s experience with cancer. Providers may also experience emotional discomfort in 
discussing the experience of families they have treated and interacted with in the context of 
cancer. In Phase 2, families participating will likely experience some emotional  distress during 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_146127] , which is an expected and intentional aspect of the intervention . 
 
There is also a small risk for breach of confidentiality.  
 
Describe the plan to minimize risks. Include in the description the availability of any 
medical or psychological resources .  
[LOCATION_011] University study staff who conduct the  qualitative interviews (Phase 1 and Phase 2) will 
work to minimize the emotional distress experienced by [CONTACT_91948]/young adults, parents and 
providers pertaining to discuss ion surrounding family and professional experiences in the 
context of cancer. Interviewers will assure participants that they are not required to answer 
questions that make them uncomfortable. Regarding completion of the screening items (Phase 1 
and Phase 2) and quantitative measures (Phase 2), study staff will monitor completion of 
questionnaires. In particular, staff will immediately check the response to the youth/young adult 
screening question regarding active suicidal ideation; if active suicidal ideat ion is endorsed by 
[CONTACT_146175]/young adult, study staff will contact [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Long (PI [INVESTIGATOR_146128]) and will 
ask follow -up questions to determine the level of risk. If imminent risk is discovered, staff will 
be in contact [CONTACT_146176] (in the case o f youth under the age of 18) or with the young adult 
directly (in the case of young adults age 18 or above) and will provide referrals for mental health 
care. (Individuals with active suicidal ideation will not be enrolled in the study).  
 
Study staff lead ing the pi[INVESTIGATOR_146129], including how to assess clinical risk and deescalate emotional situations.  
Should parent or sibling participants endorse mental health risk to [LOCATION_011] University study staff, 
Kristin Long PhD (principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_146130]) will be on call to 
provide guidance to address imminent risk discovered during s tudy activities (i.e., qualitative 
interviews, pi[INVESTIGATOR_146131], exit interviews, etc.). With parent written consent, a formal 
mental health referral may be made as indicated.  
 
SECTION N :  BENEFITS  
Describe the potential benefits to subjects related  to the study.  State if there are no direct 
benefits . NOTE: Compensation and/or course credit are not considered benefits.  
There are no direct benefits to participating in this study, though it is possible participants may 
perceive a benefit of research contributing to development of more comprehensive services to 
address the needs of siblings of children with cancer.  
Describe the potential benefits to society and/or others related to the study  
 
The needs of siblings and children of immediate family members with cancer  are not often met 
within oncology programs .  The present study works to develop a telehealth -based support 
program targeting posttraumatic stress symptoms of siblings of children with cancer that is 
culturally sensitive and meets the lo gistic and clinical needs of families.  This is expected to 
improve trajectories of siblings’ functioning and reduce the overall burden of cancer on families.

research, its design, and subject protections . 
Data collected in the form of qualitative interviews will be analyze d according to applied  
thematic analysis methodology. This methodology includes assessment of data to build 
familiarity and create preliminary codes, creating initial codes and coding structures, combining 
codes into themes, and defining themes and the ways in which they fit to gether. The initial draft 
of the coding structure would be developed using a priori research questions and probes from the

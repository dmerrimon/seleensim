triage appropriateness . A pi[INVESTIGATOR_696804] a nurse -to-family  
telehealth trial . We therefore aim to test the feasibility of conducting a parallel cluster  randomized trial 
comparing nurse -to-family telehealth communication to usual care for pediatric transfers.  Feasibility will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_696819], fidelity, and survey response rates.  
 
Eligibility  
 
Inclusion : Eligible patients will be children aged eight  days to less than or equal to 18 years who 
present to a participating community hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3409] ( ED), are accepted for inter -facility 
transfer, are assigned to arrive as a direct admission (i.e., ED -to-inpatient) to one of three eligible hospi[INVESTIGATOR_696805] , and have an adult parent or guardian at the bedside  with English language preference . The eligible units 
include the pediatric intensive care unit ( ICU) and two  pediatric acute care units .  
Exclusion : Transfer consultations for children less than [ADDRESS_945620] this 
intervention before adapting the platform’s family -facing interface into additional languages.  
All eligible children will be enrolled in the study.  This research has a waiver of consent for the 
intervention, because  telehealth visits are an existing clinical resource that can be used for all transferring 
patients. The decision to use telehealth in this trial will be encouraged in the intervention arm but will remain 
optional; no nurse or parent will be required to use telehealth. The parent survey that will be used for data 
collection of exploratory outcomes will have elements of informed consent before the survey questions.  
 
Exploratory Outcomes  
 
In addition to testing feasibility objectives ( Table 1 ), we will measure subject -level exploratory outcomes 
data to test feasibility of data collection and to obtain effect size estimates. Exploratory outcomes include 
family -centered care, family experience, parent acute stress, parent distress, and change in level of care.  
Family -centered care of the community ED encounter will be assessed using the ED Family -Centered Care 
Experience (ED -FACCE) survey. Family experience will be measured using the two items measuring overall 
experience from the ED Consumer Assessm ent of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) survey. Parent 
acute stress and distress will be assessed using the Emotional Distress: Anxiety measure. Change in level of 
care will be measured at two timepoints: (1) between initial unit assignment and post -transfer arrival and (2) 
between post -transfer arrival until 12 hours after arrival. Change in level of care will be defined as switching 
from an acute care unit or service to  an intensive care unit or service, and vice versa.

Procedures  Involved  
  
Randomization : The unit of randomization will be the community hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , which decreases 
contamination in comparison to randomization at the patient level (under which each ED would have 
simultaneous telehealth visits and usual care). We will use constrained randomization to better balance the 
intervention and control arms with respect to  ED-to-children’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_696807].  
Distance will be categorized into less than [ADDRESS_945621] 
admissions to a pediatric ICU or ped iatric acute care unit.   
Intervention : Per standard procedures, after a children’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_696808] a patient for 
transfer, the transferring patient is assigned a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_696809]. The charge nurse will 
accept or deny the patient to their unit. Upon accepting a patient to their unit, thi s charge nurse will determine 
whether  the transferring patient meets trial eligibility criteria and is transferring from an intervention -arm ED 
site. Upon confirmation that the patient is eligible to receive a nurse -to-family telehealth visit , the charge nurse 
will call by [CONTACT_696820][INVESTIGATOR_696810] a telehealth visit to the 
patient’s parent(s). If the parents would like to have a nurse -to-family telehealth visit, the ED nurse will give the 
parent’s cell phone number or email address to the children’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_696811].   
The children’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_696812] -enabled computer to launch a telehealth 
visit using the secure telehealth application  called ExtendedCare . The ExtendedCare platform meets Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act security rules and launches from the patient’s electronic health 
record. From within this telehealth visit, the charge nurse will send a n electronic message (e.g. via  text or 
email ) to the parent  and wait for the parent to join the visit (establish a secure videoconference) . The message 
to the parent  includes a link that can be clicked  to open a browser that allows the parent to join the telehealth 
visit. The parent does not need to download or use any app lication or program.   
Charge nurses are instructed to initiate the telehealth visit prior to the patient leaving the community 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_696813]. Charge nurses are 
also instructed that the content of the discussion during the visit is intended to prepare the family and charge 
nurse for the transfer process and the patient’s arrival . This workflow requires that the parent has a smart 
phone with access to text messaging or email. I f a parent does not have a smart phone with access to text or 
email but would like to speak with the charge nurse, a phone call will be offered i nstead. Other interventions 
related to parent -provider communication that are delivered prior to the arrival at the post -transfer hospi[INVESTIGATOR_696814].  
Control : Subjects presenting to control -arm ED sites will receive usual care. These subjects will transfer 
to the children’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_696815]. The charge nurse will not 
have direct communication with anyone from the ED. The charge nurse will communicate with the children’s 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_696816].    
Data collection:  Data collection for the feasibility objectives and exploratory outcomes will include chart 
review of the electronic health record and parent surveys. Parent surveys will be distributed to  one parent per 
enrolled patient.  Parent respondents will include only English -proficient individuals who were with their child 
during the ED visit.  For children who had more than one parent at their ED bedside, we will let the parents 
select the single respondent.  Eligible parents  will receive the family -centered care, experience, and anxiety  
instruments 0-3 days after the ED encounter . Parent distress will be  measured at 30 days  from the ED 
encounter. Surveys not completed within 21 days of distribution will be considered non -response. Participants 
will receive a $[ADDRESS_945622] for each survey  packet that they return . Parents completing both survey packets will 
therefore receive a total of $[ADDRESS_945623] patient demographics (age, race , ethnicity, sex, insurance, 
[LOCATION_004]  Healthy Places Index) and utilization  variables  (admitting service,  length of stay, disposition). 
Demographic characteristics of f amily caregiver s (age, race , ethnicity, gender, education, smart phone access , 
digital literacy score) will be collected in the survey packets.  
 
STATISTICAL  ANALYSIS PLAN (SAP)  
 
For feasibility objectives, proportions with 95% CI will be calculated for protocol assignment adherence, 
fidelity, and survey response rates to determine if each of the feasibility objectives is met. For the exploratory 
 outcomes, analyses will be descriptive, de signed to provide effect size estimates with 95% CI . To account for 
the cluster randomized design, we will use analysis methods for clustered  data when estimating confidence 
intervals, treating ED sites  as clusters.  
Although we do not anticipate strong cluster effects for the feasibility objective outcomes, we recognize 
that our confidence intervals will be inflated both by [CONTACT_696821] t -distributions with  only 5 or 2 degrees of freedom, depending on whether the objective concerns 
patients from all 6 sites (objectives 1 and 3) or from just the 3 intervention sites  (objective 2) . Hence, we 
anticipate that our actual sample size will perform as effectively as  a sample size one half smaller for 
objectives 1 and 3  and as 60% smaller for objective 2 . For feasibility outcomes, an actual  sample size of 120 
will be sufficient to estimate proportions with error margins (i.e., half -width of 95% CI) of  ≤12.7 percentage 
points f or the primary feasibility objective (objective 1)  and for objective 3, which involve the full sample. For 
objective 2, we anticipate fidelity testing on a n actual  sample of size 45, which will result in error margins no 
greater than 23.0 percentage points . This pi[INVESTIGATOR_696817], as that important question will be answered in a future efficacy trial. The chosen sample 
size of 120 patient encounters prioritizes feasibility over power.

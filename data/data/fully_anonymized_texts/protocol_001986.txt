2.0 Objectives*
Specific Aim 1: Identify bone perfusion kinetics at baseline and following osteotomy and  
subsequent soft tissue strippi[INVESTIGATOR_262992].
Hypothesis 1—Human bone perfusion kinetics will demonstrate predictable and 
reproducible changes when undergoing vascular compromise, osteotomy, and soft tissue  
strippi[INVESTIGATOR_007].
Specific Aim 2: Optimize image data processing and identify ICG-based DCE-FI kinetic  
curve properties most closely associated with low bone perfusion.
Hypothesis 2—Low post-debridement bone perfusion is associated with higher rates of 
infection.
3.0 Background*
Infection following high-energy trauma or blast injury is one of the most  
challenging complications facing musculoskeletal trauma patients, with an estimated  
annual cost of $35 billion in the US ( https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/[ZIP_CODE]). Infection can  
be catastrophic, potentially causing prolonged morbidity, reduced function, permanent  
disability and amputation. Failed treatment results in chronic bone infection requiring  
repeat surgical procedures in approximately 30% of patients. 1-4
Blood supply plays a critical role in the bone health for trauma patients by 
[CONTACT_262999], nutrients, antibiotics, and immune cells necessary to treat  
infection successfully, 5-9. The management of trauma-related infection is therefore based  
on aggressive, thorough debridement of all poorly perfused bone and connective tissue, 
followed by [CONTACT_263000]. More extensive debridement is  
believed to improve treatment success; however, additional tissue loss requires 
increasingly complex reconstructive procedures to fill bone and connective tissue voids.  
At present there are no objective, intraoperative, and real-time techniques to assess 
bone perfusion and thoroughness of debridement. This unmet clinical need results in  
substantial practice variation and places patients at unnecessarily high risk for chronic  
infection and potentially avoidable surgical procedures.
Our multidisciplinary research team has demonstrated that quantitative indocyanine  
green (ICG)-based Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Fluorescence Imaging (DCE-FI) can  
assess bone perfusion in a measurable, reproducible and predictable way using a porcine  
model.[ADDRESS_319825] (IRB)-approved  
protocol to perform similar imaging in human trauma patients with good success. To this  
end, the primary objective of this project is to gather critical pi[INVESTIGATOR_262993]-based DCE-FI to clinical practice for human trauma patients. During 
this translational work we will systematically develop and evaluate an ICG-based DCE-FI 
methodology and analytic tools for intraoperative assessment of bone perfusion. Our long-  
term goal is to apply these sophisticated methods to guide surgical debridement that will  
enhance trauma patients’ short- and long-term recovery.

4.0 Study Endpoints*
Primary outcome measure is ICG-based DCE-FI changes that occur as a result of 
osteotomy and soft tissue strippi[INVESTIGATOR_262994].
5.0 Study Intervention/Investigational Agent
5.1 Description:
ICG fluorescence imaging has been used to assess tissue perfusion in vivo in real-time in 
arterial and lymphatic perfusion imaging25, 26, osseous flap perfusion imaging27. ICG has 
been approved for clinical use by [CONTACT_263001] 1959. The dynamic fluorescence  
imaging systems used in this study will be the Pentero surgical microscope (Zeiss, 
[LOCATION_013]),  SPY Elite (Novodaq/Stryker), or SPY PHI (Novodaq/Stryker). Both are 
publicly available imaging systems  that can be used to assess tissue perfusion in real time 
in the operating room. The systems  have a multi-directional imaging arm which contains a 
near-infrared light source that  illuminates the fluorescent agent within the tissues, an HD 
video camera that captures the  intensity of fluorescent marker in real-time, and software 
that allows the user to capture  relative and absolute perfusion values within the surgical 
field. This product has been FDA approved for use to monitor blood flow, plastic surgery, 
microsurgery,  reconstructive surgery, gastrointestinal imaging and coronary by[CONTACT_13786].

c. Provision of informed consent
6.[ADDRESS_319832] (IRB) guidelines and a signed IRB-approved Consent Form as the means of 
documenting this understanding. Potential recruits are instructed that their participation is  
completely voluntary and that their medical care will not be altered in any way should they  
elect not to participate at any time prior to surgery. Subjects are recruited from patients  
presenting or referred to Orthopedic Department at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center 
for treatment and meeting protocol inclusion criteria. Potential subjects will be approached 
by a member of their care team to gauge interest about participation in research prior to 
being approached by a member of the study team. Subjects will be invited to participate 
in this study by a  member of the Orthopaedic Department, which will occur either at the 
time of consultation  with the surgeon about the candidate’s standard-of-care procedures 
or at another time  agreed to by [CONTACT_52764], the candidate’s surgeon and/or 
[CONTACT_263018] and/or [CONTACT_263019] or their designee. No advertisements or other promotional 
material will be used. No finder fees or recruitment incentives will be offered. Women of 
child bearing potential  are eligible for enrollment into this study because ICG 
administration is not considered to  present any additional risk for these women. The 
study will exclude women who are  pregnant or breast-feeding as indicated in the 
exclusion criteria. Women of child-bearing  potential, if asked to participate, will be

Patients
Page [ADDRESS_319833] to inclusion and exclusion criteria above. Patients who meet eligibility criteria will  
be asked to participate in the trial. If they agree written informed consent will be obtained  
from the patient or their healthcare proxy. To obtain informed consent, study personnel  
(surgeon or research coordinator) will adhere to the following procedures: (1) present study  
information in a manner that is understandable to the patient; (2) discuss the study with the  
patient and answer any questions; (3) allow the patient an opportunity to discuss 
participation with their family; (4) confirm that the patient understands the risks and  
benefits of participating in the study and that their participation is voluntary; (5) complete  
the consent process and obtain signatures from the patient and research team. The process 
of obtaining and documenting informed consent forms will be completed in accordance  
with local Good Clinical Practice (GCP) recommendations.
If the research team member obtaining consent is at all unsure about the patient's ability  
to consent, s/he will consult with the study PI.
A legally authorized representative (LAR) with reasonable knowledge of the potential  
participant will be approached to consent on the patient’s behalf if the patient cannot  
adequately answer at least 2 questions and it is determined that the patient’s level of 
cognition is not likely to change before surgery.
The choice of LAR will follow standard procedures. The following with be approached in  
this order of priority:
• Legal guardian
• Proxy (health care agent) named in an advance directive or durable power 
of attorney for health care
• Family member or other surrogate identified by [CONTACT_263003].  Guidance will be provided to assist the LAR in making the 
consent decision. They will  advised to base the decision on the 
participant’s expressed wishes, or, if these are not  known, what they 
believe the participant would have desired under the circumstances of the 
injury, their beliefs and values. If the LAR does not know what the 
participant would have wanted, the LAR will advised to base the decision 
with the participant’s best interest  in mind. They will be asked to carefully 
consider how much leeway the participant would likely give the LAR in 
making the choice about participation in the study.

v.08.18.2022Recognizing that consent is an ongoing process, the study team will encourage the  
participants to ask additional questions that may arise during the course of their 
participation in the study.
6.5 Early Withdrawal of Subjects
Participants will be removed from the protocol if:
1) Study imaging is not completed for any reason. The subject withdraws consent.
2) The subject has an occurrence of a significant clinical event that precludes imaging.
3) The subject becomes pregnant.
If a participant is withdrawn from the protocol, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_262995] 
"withdrawn" and will add a detailed explanation about the cause of withdrawal in the  
database.
6.6 Study drug and device
6.6a Description
This study is neither a drug nor a device trial. Patients will be administered FDA 
approved ICG through intravenous injection and imaged by a FDA approved surgical 
microscope (Pentero,SPY Elite, or SPY PHI) which is 0.[ADDRESS_319834] been used for routine clinical 
practice for many years. Figure (a) shows the Schematic sketch of the imaging systems. 
ICG fluorescence imaging utilizes intravenously injected ICG, which is a fluorescent dye 
that is FDA-approved for clinical use, illuminated with near-infrared light.  The ICG dye 
is indirectly activated and the dynamic fluorescence due to bone perfusion can be 
captured by a video rate imaging system.
6.6.b Preparation and Administration of Study Drug
ICG used in this study is purchased from Novodaq/Stryker.
6.6.c ICG Preparation and Administration Procedures:
1) ICG is prepared by [CONTACT_263004]/or Anesthesia teams in the operating room 
on the day of surgery.
2) From the vial containing ICG, the required dose is withdrawn into a 
syringe,  labeled, and administered through a peripheral intravenous line followed 
by a saline  flush.

injection. After exposure of the tibia or femur 0.1 mg/kg ICG will be injected 
intravenously. Video rate ICG fluorescence images will be acquired 20 seconds before  
and 4 minutes after ICG injection. Osteotomy or bone cut will be performed and then 0.1 
mg/kg ICG will be injected intravenously and, again, video rate ICG fluorescence images  
will be acquired [ADDRESS_319837]  
dose of 0.1mg/kg ICG will be injected and video rate ICG fluorescence images will be  
acquired 20 seconds before and 4 minutes after ICG injection. There will be a minimum of 
5 minutes between ICG infusions to allow ICG to wash out of tissues.

8.0 Sharing of Results with Subjects*
This study is not intended to provide any results to the subjects because this is the  
investigational study and the subjects will be under standard practice for their 
condition and no diagnostic or therapeutic decisions will occur based on the study.
9.0 Study Timelines*
This study is a one-time imaging during the subject’s surgery. The duration of 
each subject enrolled in the study is from the date the subject signs the consent to  
the day that the surgery is carried out.
The duration to enroll all study subjects is Jan.2, 2020 – Dec.31, 2021.
The estimated date for the investigators to complete this study is Jan. 31, 2022

v.08.18.2022Vulnerable Populations*
After the consent has been reviewed with a potential subject, the subject will be asked 
to tell the research team member two things about the research they recall. If they are 
not able to do so the subject will be considered incompetent to consent to the research 
trial. Patients found to be in capable of providing informed consent will be deemed by 
[CONTACT_263006] a LAR agrees to their participation and signs the consent form.
Patients with impaired decision-making capacity will be included in this study. If the 
patient is unable to  provide informed consent (e.g. due to their injury) at the time they 
are identified, informed consent may be obtained from their legally authorized 
representative (LAR). Allowing informed consent from a patient’s LAR will reduce the 
risk of recruitment bias against the most severely infected patients.
For patient with impaired decision-making capacity, a LAR with knowledge of the 
potential participant will be approached to consent on the patient’s behalf. If the patient 
cannot adequately answer at least two questions and it is determined that the patient’s 
level of cognition is not likely to change before surgery, their LAR will be approached. 
The choice of LAR will follow standard procedures. The following will be approached 
in this order of priority:
legal guardian
proxy (health care agent) named in an advanced directive or durable power of 
attorney for health-care
The LAR will be advised to base the decision on the participant’s expressed wishes, or, if 
these are not  known, what they believe the participant would have desired under the 
circumstances of the injury, their beliefs and values. Recognizing that consent is an 
ongoing process, the study team will encourage the participants to ask additional 
questions that may arise during the course of their participation in the study.
Subjects participation in this study completely voluntary. If at any time a patient finds 
participation to be unduly stressful the patient or their legal authorized representative 
may withdraw the patient from the study with no repercussions.
Assent will be obtained from all patients that are able to sign their name. If patients are 
injured so severely that they are not able to sign their name [CONTACT_263017]. 
Assent will not be obtained from patients whom are unconscious due to the nature of their 
injury. 
The study team will comply with consent procedures for cognitively impaired 
adults outlined in SOP HRP-013.

v.08.18.202211.0 Local Number of Subjects
The primary outcome measure is total bone blood flow (TBBF). Informed by [CONTACT_263007], a total sample size of [ADDRESS_319838] deviations 
between baseline and osteotomy and soft tissue strippi[INVESTIGATOR_262996] (i.e., 50% of 
the effect size identified in the porcine model). Assuming a one tailed test, a Type  
I error rate of 0.05, and a Type II error rate of 0.80, a sample of 20 was 
determined  with an additional 10 amputation patients recruited in the event that 
there is any  protocol- or data-related issues. Data analysis will be performed 
after half of the  patients are enrolled to re-calculate sample size needed to 
determine a difference.
We anticipate that 20 subjects will be accrued locally. We anticipate that 20 
patients will be enrolled at Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. A total of 40 patients  
will be enrolled.
12.0 Recruitment Methods 
Patients, 18 years of age or older who present to DHMC who are scheduled to 
undergo a lower extremity amputation (either below knee, through knee or above knee) 
will be considered for study enrollment. Participation in this research requires informed 
consent according to Institutional Review Board (IRB) guidelines and a signed IRB-
approved Consent Form as the means of documenting this understanding. This study 
requests a partial waiver of HIPAA for recruitment purposes. The partial waiver would allow for 
the surgeon to share with the research coordinator the patient name, sex, MRN number, age, 
underlying conditions as well as type and location of injury.  
A Potential subjects consenting to undergo a surgical procedure, will be informed by [CONTACT_263008] a research study 
for which they might be interested in participating.  Following this discussion, either at 
the same visit or a subsequent visit the patient will be approached by a member of the 
research study team who will present the study and inquire if the patient would like to 
participate.  Potential recruits are instructed that their participation is completely 
voluntary and that their medical care will not be altered in any way should they elect 
not to participate at any time prior to surgery. Following consent, inclusion and

status before administration of ICG.
13.0 Withdrawal of Subjects*
Participants will be removed from the protocol if:
1) Study imaging is not completed for any reason.
2) The subject withdraws consent.
3) The subject has an occurrence of a significant clinical event that precludes imaging.
4) The subject becomes pregnant.
If a participant is withdrawn from the protocol, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_262997] "withdrawn" and will add a detailed explanation about the cause of withdrawal in 
the database.
14.0 Risks to Subjects*
Risk of ICG injection: ICG (Indocyanine Green) will be administered intravenously 
three  times: once after exposure, once after osteotomy and once after soft tissue 
strippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. ICG is FDA approved for human use in angiography for ophthalmology 
and cardiology  applications and is given routinely to patients in these clinical 
settings. The risks are  considered minimal and consist of nausea, vomiting, hives, 
increased heart rate in subjects  with particular sensitivity to the dye. ICG does contain 
sodium iodide and patients with a  history of allergy to iodides will be excluded. 
Anaphylactic or urticardial reactions are rare  but have been reported in patients both 
with and without a history of allergy to iodides.  Anaphylactic deaths have been 
reported following IGG administration during cardiac  catheterization. Reported rates 
of mild, moderate and severe adverse reactions to ICG are  0.15%, 0.2% and 0.05%. 
Every effort will be made to minimize this risk as much as possible. It is the 
standard of care at this institution to obtain information related to  allergies, 
sensitivities and past medical histories upon patient arrival. Patients will also be  
monitored throughout their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], as is the standard of care, by [CONTACT_263009].  Additionally, at all times ICG fluorescence imaging assessments are taking 
PROTOCOL TITLE: ICG Fluorescence Imaging in Lower Extremity Amputation 
Patients
Page [ADDRESS_319840].
Prolonged operating room time: Because the ICG fluorescence assessments will 
take place in the operating room, participation in this study may increase the amount 
of time  spent under surgical anesthesia in the operating room. For the average case, an 
additional  [ADDRESS_319841] while other 
required operative  procedures are being performed.
Risk of confidentiality breach: Subjects enrolled in research are always exposed 
to additional risks of a breach in confidentiality, for example, of some elements of 
their personal health information that is made available to study investigators as part 
of their  participation. The risk is 100%, but the occurrence rate of an actual breach is < 
1% (to date, we are not aware of any subject participating in our studies who has 
experienced a  detrimental breach of confidentiality or confidential information).
15.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects*
Patients enrolling in this study will not benefit directly because no diagnostic or 
therapeutic  decisions will occur based on the study, and thus, administration of the study is 
not intended  to alter the surgical procedure. However, future patients may benefit from 
the knowledge  gained from the study since this study may provide an objective, 
intraoperative, and real- time methodology to assess bone perfusion and thoroughness of 
amputation.
16.0 Data Management* and Confidentiality
Confidentiality
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to 
the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 
(HIPAA). Risk of breach of confidentiality of the medical records and status of

viewing terminals. Access will be  limited to research team members who have 
undergone CPHS training at Dartmouth.  Whenever possible and practical standard-of-
care clinical data used in the research will be  de-identified when under analysis.
Case Report Forms
Study case report forms (CRFs) will be the primary data collection instruments for 
the study. All data requested on CRFs will be recorded. Any missing data will be 
explained.  If a space on the CRF is left blank because the procedure was not performed or 
the question  was not asked, a written notation will be made. If an item is not applicable to 
an individual  case, written notation will be made. Changes to the CRFs will be initialed 
and dated.
Record Retention
Following closure of the study, the investigator will maintain all site study records in a safe  
and secure location. The records are maintained to allow easy and timely retrieval when 
needed (e.g., audit or inspection) and, whenever feasible, to allow any subsequent 
review  of data in conjunction with assessment of the facility, supporting systems, and 
staff. Upon completion of study analysis, research information is stored in Dartmouth 
College Records  Management off-site storage located at [ADDRESS_319843], Hanover, NH 
[ZIP_CODE]. Documents  are shredded on site after 50 years of storage.

20.0 Economic Burden to Subjects
Subjects will not be charged for any procedures conducted solely for research purposes, 
nor will they be charged for the SPY Elite® System (nor Pentero or SPY PHI) 
assessment.
Insurance plans will not be billed for research procedures that are not the usual care for 
subject’s condition. Some of the medical care that the subjects will receive during this

21.0 Consent Process
To obtain informed consent, study personnel will adhere to the following procedures: 
(1) present study information in a manner that is understandable to the patient. a Spanish 
IRB approved translated copy of the consent will be used when appropriate (2) discuss 
the study with the patient and answer any questions; (3) allow the patient an 
opportunity to  discuss participation with their family; (4) confirm that the patient 
understands the risks and benefits of participating in the study and that their 
participation is voluntary; and (5) complete the consent process and obtain signatures 
from the patient and research team.  The process of obtaining and documenting 
informed consent will be completed in  accordance with Good Clinical Practice. If the 
research team member obtaining consent is  at all unsure about the patient's ability to 
consent, s/he will consult with the study PI.
Recognizing that consent is an ongoing process, the study team will encourage 
the participants to ask additional questions that may arise during the course of their 
participation in the study.
This study will not involve the subjects who is under age 18.
The study team will comply with consent procedures outlined in SOP HRP-090
Non-English Speaking Subjects
This study will consent patients for whom English is their second language.  This 
will pertain to only individuals whose native language is Spanish. Prospective 
subjects who present for traumatic amputation surgery will be consented with the 
assistance of a Spanish speaking representative from DHMC Interpreter Services. 
Spanish speaking individuals will be given the Informed consent that has been 
translated to Spanish to review and discuss via interpreter.  Subjects willing to 
participate will sign and date the Spanish version of the consent and be given a 
copy for their records.  The interpreter will sign the Spanish consent as a witness 
to the process.  Prospective subjects who present for traumatic amputation surgery 
will be 
22.0 Process to Document Consent in Writing

D-cycloserine  Augmentation  of Cognitive  Behavioral  Therapy  for Delusions  
Detailed  Study  Protocol  Principal  Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_498813],  MD 
 
Purpose  of the Study  
 
Specific  Aims  and Design:  
Antipsychotic -resistant  delusions  in schizophrenia  are common,  are often  distressing,  and 
increase  the risk for incarceration  and self-injury.  Converging  evidence  from our group  and 
others  suggests  that the persistence  of delusions  represents  an inability  to “unlearn”  or 
“extinguish”  false beliefs  and that this deficit  may respond  to D-cycloserine  (DCS)  augmentation  
of cognitive  behavioral  therapy  (CBT).  We have  demonstrated  a selective  impairment   of 
memory  consolidation  for fear extinction  in schizophrenia  subjects  which  is highly  correlated  
with persistence  of delusions.  In animal  models,  fear extinction  is facilitated  by [CONTACT_498844];  in anxiety  
disorders  DCS  has well-established  efficacy  as an augmenter  of CBT.  We have  shown  in two 
trials  that DCS  similarly  enhances  memory consolidation  in schizophrenia subjects.  We recently  
completed  a two-session  placebo -controlled  crossover  trial of DCS  augmentation  of a CBT 
exercise  in schizophrenia  subjects  with persistent  delusions  and found  marked  improvement  of 
delusions  and delusional  distress.  While  the evidence  for this approach  is compelling,  we 
believe  a parallel -group  proof -of-concept  trial employing  a full course  of CBT is needed  prior to 
embarking  on a larger,  multi -center  trial which,  if successful,  could  fundamentally  change  our 
approach  to the treatment of  medication -resistant  delusions.  
We therefore  propose  a placebo -controlled  12 week  trial of DCS augmentation  of once -weekly  
CBT sessions  in 60 schizophrenia  subjects  with antipsychotic -resistant  delusions.  In addition  to 
testing  efficacy,  this trial will characterize DCS  effects  in terms of  time course and persistence  of 
response  and will examine  DCS effects  on memory  consolidation  and cognitive  flexibility  as 
possible  mediators  of DCS  enhancement of  CBT for delusions.  
Primary  
1. Evaluate efficacy  of DCS  facilitation of a 12 week  course  of CBT for delusions.  
a. Hypothesis:  DCS  will significantly  reduce  severity  of delusions  measured  by [CONTACT_498845].  
Secondary:  
2. Evaluate  the time course  of DCS  facilitation of  CBT.  
a. Onset  Hypothesis:  The rate of response  of delusions  with DCS  defined  as a 20% 
reduction in PSYRATS  Delusions  Subscale  total score will be superior to placebo  
after 2 weeks  of DCS  treatment.  
b. Persistence  Hypothesis:  DCS  improvement  of delusions  compared  to placebo  
will persist  at 3 and 6 month  follow -up as defined  as maintenance  of a 20% or 
greater  reduction  in the PSYRATS  Delusions  Subscale total score  from baseline.  
Tertiary  
3. Identify mediators  of delusional  response  to DCS.  
a. Memory  Consolidation  Hypothesis:  Change  in 7-day thematic  recall  on the 
Logical  Memory  Test after the first dose  of DCS  will predict  improvement  on the 
PSYRATS  Delusions Subscale  total score  at 12 weeks.  
b. Cognitive  Flexibility  Hypothesis:  Change  in the number  of alternative  beliefs  
generated  during  the first compared  to the second  administration  of the 
Alternative  Beliefs  exercise  in the DCS group  will predict  improvement  of the 
PSYRATS  Delusions Subscale  total score  at 12 weeks.  
 
 
4. Identify neural differences in patients compared to age -matched healthy control 
population.  
 
a. Network connectivity hypothesis: Decreased connectivity between the 
hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in patients at rest and during encoding of stories

b. Memory Hypothesis: Patient impairment of network co nnectivity will predict 
performance on immediate and 1 -week delay m emory relative to healthy controls  
 
Background  Significance:  
 
 
Public  Health  Significance : Delusions  remain  a serious  public  health  problem,  with persistent  
antipsychotic -resistant  delusions  present  in approximately  30% of schizophrenia  patients.  In 
addition,  most  patients  experience  intermittent  psychotic  relapse  associated  with major  
disruptions  in rehabilitation  and recovery.  Persecutory  delusions  are associated  with great  
psychological  distress  to patients  and family  members,  whereas  other  forms  of delusions  
commonly  result  in social  and vocational  disability,  incarceration,  and can result  in harm  to self 
or others.  
Alternative  Pharmacological  Treatments : The current  approach  of dopamine  D2 receptor  
blockade  for the treatment  of delusions,  while  effective  in many  patients,  is  only  partially  
effective  or is ineffective  in approximately  30% of patients.  Findings  from PET imaging  reveal  
that excessive  release  by [CONTACT_498846] D2 antagonists,  but a substantial  proportion  of individuals  with 
schizophrenia  overlap  with healthy  subjects  on this measure  and display  minimal  response  to 
antipsychotic  medication  (1). Of the second  generation  antipsychotics,  only olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_498814], although  this effect  
was modest  and at the cost of substantial  medical  morbidity  (2). In contrast,  clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_498815] 50% of refractory  patients.  While  the mechanism  for clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]’s  efficacy  
remains  unclear,  it is noteworthy  that clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]  (and not haloperidol)  attenuates  psychosis  
produced  by [CONTACT_498847]  (3), suggesting  that dysregulation  of NMDA  receptors  
may play a role in delusions  that are resistant  to traditional  antipsychotics  but potentially  
responsive  to clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  Unfortunately,  the use of clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_498816],  patient  refusal,  requirements  for hematological  monitoring,  and 
metabolic  side effects  and sedation,  so that less than 10% of patients  with refractory  delusions  
receive  it. No other  pharmacologic  treatment  has demonstrated  consistent  efficacy  for 
antipsychotic -resistant  delusions,  although  the most  promising  results  have  come  from agents  
acting  at glutamatergic  systems,  including  modulators  of the NMDA  receptor  complex  
(sarcosine,  D-serine) ( 4) and  of glutamate release  (lamotrigine)  (5). 
Cognitive  Behavioral  Therapy  (CBT ): CBT was recommended  as an evidenced -based  treatment  
for refractory  psychosis  in the most  recent  PORT  guidelines  (6). However,  efficacy  for positive  
symptoms  is quite  modest;  in a meta -analysis  by [CONTACT_498848]  (7), the effect  size was 
0.22 for methodologically -rigorous  trials that included  rater blinding  and an adequate  control  
condition.  Predictors  of response  included  greater  insight  at baseline  and recent  inpatient  
admission;  duration  of treatment  was not related  to outcome.  A clear  relationship  between  CBT 
approach  and effectiveness  for psychosis  has not emerged;  treatments  involving  individual  or 
group  treatment  and lasting  from [ADDRESS_641765]  all produced  positive  results  (8). 
Kingdon  and Turkington  (9) demonstrated  that CBT for psychosis  can be disseminated  within  
community  mental  health  systems.  They  trained  psychiatric  nurses  from six community  mental  
health  centers  to conduct  a six-session  CBT protocol  and demonstrated  significant  benefit  in a 
randomized  controlled  trial involving  443 schizophrenia  patients.  CBT aims  to facilitate  the 
patient’s  capacity  to develop  alternative  explanations  for delusions,  but this approach  is limited  
by [CONTACT_498849] 
“unlearning”  their false  beliefs.  CBT also helps  patients  cope  with distressing  beliefs  and to 
modify  resulting  dysfunctional behaviors.  
Summary  of Significance : Given  the high prevalence  and serious  adverse  consequences  of 
treatment  refractory  delusions,  a major  unmet  need  exists  for a new and effective  treatment  
approach.   Our model,  based  on animal  and human  studies  of memory  consolidation  and fear 
Study  #:S12 -[ZIP_CODE]  Version:  01/25/2017   
 
 
extinction,  posits  a deficit  in the capacity  to “unlearn”  delusional  beliefs  which  can be reversed  
by [CONTACT_498850].  While  the evidence  supporting  this model  is compelling  and the 
results  from our preliminary  treatment  trial were  highly  promising,  we believe  a placebo - 
controlled,  parallel -group  trial is the necessary  next step to validate  this approach  prior to 
embarking  on a larger  trial that, if successful,  could  lead to a fundamental  change  in our 
understanding  and treatment  of antipsychotic -resistant  delusions.  This potentially  high-impact  
approach  involves  an inexpensive  generic  medication  that is extremely  safe and well-tolerated  
outcome  demonstrated  by [CONTACT_498851],  Kindgon  and colleagues  (9) of a six-session  CBT 
protocol administered by  [CONTACT_498852].  
 
Innovation:  
Memory  consolidation  and thalamocortical  dysfunction  in schizophrenia : Prior  to [CONTACT_498890]’s  
recent  move  to [LOCATION_001] University  Medical  Center  (NYUMC),  his group  at the [LOCATION_005]  
General  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  (MGH)  and others  identified  a selective  impairment  of memory  consolidation  in 
schizophrenia  associated  with abnormal  thalamocortical  connections  and with a failure  to 
activate  ventromedial  prefrontal  cortex.  These  deficits,  in turn, are highly  correlated  with 
persistence  of delusions  in medicated  and unmedicated  subjects.  Dara  Manoach  (MGH)  
demonstrated  a failure  to consolidate  learning  of a procedural  memory  task in schizophrenia  
subjects  which  is highly  correlated  with abnormalities  of sleep  spi[INVESTIGATOR_498817]  (10, 
11). Sleep  spi[INVESTIGATOR_498818].  Ferrarelli  and colleagues  (12) 
also reported  a marked  deficit  in sleep  spi[INVESTIGATOR_498819].  More  recently,  this group  demonstrated  
a selective  slowing  in prefrontal/thalamic  oscillations  that was highly  correlated  (r=0.62)  with 
delusions  (13). Daphne  Holt (MGH)  demonstrated  that individuals  with schizophrenia  exhibit  a 
selective  failure  to consolidate  extinction  memory  (14) which  highly  correlates  with a failure  to 
activate  ventrolateral  prefrontal  cortex  (15) . This deficit  was unrelated  to medication  status  and 
was highly  correlated  with delusions.  Hence  the failure  to transfer  learning  to prefrontal  cortex  
during  memory  consolidation  and to access  this information  appropriately  appears  to play a role 
in the persistence  of delusions.  The improvement  of delusions  by [CONTACT_498853].  
DCS  facilitates  memory  consolidation : In animal  models  a similar  deficit  in memory  
consolidation  is produced  by [CONTACT_498854]  (infralimbic)  cortex  (16). Following  injection  of the NMDA  antagonist,  CPP,  into the 
prefrontal  cortex,  mice  successfully  extinguish  fear conditioning  but fail to retain  extinction  
learning  when  examined  after 24 hours  (16); this finding  of preserved  extinction  and failure  to 
consolidate  extinction  learning  is identical  to the pattern  exhibited  by [CONTACT_498855] (14). DCS,  which  is a potent  positive  modulator  of  NMDA  
receptors  containing  the NR2C  subunit,  markedly  enhances  consolidation  of extinction  memory.  
DCS  has twice  the activity  at the subpopulation  of NR2C -containing  NMDA  receptors  compared  
to D-serine  and glycine  and 50% activity  at other  NMDA  receptors  (17, 18). A recently - 
developed  NR2C  knockout  mouse  is behaviorally  normal  except  for deficits  in memory,  
including  consolidation  of fear extinction  learning  (19). Whereas  NMDA  receptor  density  
(represented  by [CONTACT_498856]1 subunit)  is decreased  postmortem  in schizophrenia  
prefrontal  cortex,  only the NR2C  subunit  is selectively  reduced  in schizophrenia  compared  to 
bipolar  disorder and  healthy controls (20). 
 
When  administered  within  one hour after extinction  training,  DCS  increases  24 hour retention  by 
[CONTACT_14774] -fold, but tolerance  rapi[INVESTIGATOR_498820]  (21). When  administered  prior to 
training,  DCS  has no effect  on performance  during  training —enhanced  performance  is only 
Study  #:S12 -[ZIP_CODE]  Version:  01/25/[ADDRESS_641766]  on subsequent  extinction  training  (22). In addition,  DCS  does  not just enhance  
new inhibitory  learning;  it appears  to “erase”  the previous  fear conditioning  learning  as reflected  
by [CONTACT_498857]  (23). 
Based  on the robust  finding  of enhancement  of fear extinction  training  in animals,  DCS  has 
been  used  as an adjunct  to CBT for anxiety  disorders  and has consistently  demonstrated  
enhanced  efficacy relative  to placebo when  administered within  one hour of  training  (24, 25). 
 
DCS  effects  on cognitive  flexibility:  Agonists  at the glycine  site of the NMDA  receptor  may also 
enhance  cognitive  flexibility.  In an 8-week  placebo -controlled  daily-dosing  trial of DCS 50 mg/d,  
we found  that DCS  significantly  enhanced  temporal  lobe activation  during  a verbal  fluency  task 
(26). Tsai and colleagues  found  a reduction  in perseverative  errors  on the Wisconsin  Card  Sort 
Task  following  daily dosing  with D-serine  (27). In animal  models,  D-serine  significantly  
enhanced  “reversal  learning”  in rats as measured  by [CONTACT_498858] (28). 
 
Preliminary  study  of CBT for delusions : We conducted  a 16 week  randomized  parallel  group  
controlled  feasibility  trial of CBT for delusions  in 30 schizophrenia  patients  who exhibited  
psychotic  symptoms  despi[INVESTIGATOR_498821]  a 93% study  
retention  rate; 75% of subjects  attended  all 16 sessions  (29). The manualized  CBT protocol,  
developed  by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Cather  (MGH)  included  cognitive  restructuring,  exposure,  and copi[INVESTIGATOR_135982].  
Compared  with a psychoeducational  control  condition,  the effect  size of CBT for delusions  was 
0.18,  which  was not statistically  significant.  This study  demonstrated  the feasibility  of retaining  
subjects  with refractory  psychosis  in a CBT trial and sustained  the relatively  small  effect  of CBT 
for delusions in the  absence  of pharmacologic  augmentation.  
 
Preliminary   studies  of  DCS   for  memory  consolidation :  In  two  studies  we  demonstrated  
enhancement  of memory  consolidation  in 
Effect  of Single -dose  D-cycloserine  
on Delayed  Thematic  Recall  (n=38)  schizophrenia  subjects  with  DCS.  In one  study,  a 
 
 
[ADDRESS_641767] compared  
to placebo  (figure,  left) (30). We selected  this 
measure  because  consolidation  of narrative  themes  
represents  a cognitive  function  particularly  relevant  to 
CBT for delusions  and because  memory  consolidation  
is known  to solidify  the “gist”  of new learning  (31). As 
shown  in the figure,  DCS  may have   enhanced  
cognitive  flexibility  since,  unlike  the DSC  group,  the 
placebo  group  displayed  worsening  in 7-day recall  of 
story  B compared  to baseline.  Interference  in learning  
story  B may have  resulted  from the administration  of 
0 1 
Week  of Story  Administration  story  A one week  earlier at  baseline.  
 
Recently  we combined  once -weekly  DCS  50 mg with 
the Brain  Fitness  cognitive  remediation  program  which  emphasizes  auditory  discrimination  
training,  in 38 schizophrenia  subjects.  Compared  to placebo,  DCS  significantly  improved  
learning  of the auditory  discrimination  task (figure 2, below).  However,  enhancement  of learning  
with DCS  did not generalize  to cognitive  domains  that were  not practiced;  performance  on the 
MATRICS  battery  did not improve  from baseline  (p>0.1).  Of note,  with weekly  dosing  of DCS,  
learning  on the auditory  discrimination  task did not plateau  until week  4 and no loss of efficacy  
was observed  over the 8 week  trial. No adverse  effects  were  reported.  This study  replicates  the 
Study  #:S12 -[ZIP_CODE]  Version:  01/25/2017   
 
 
 
 
finding  that DCS enhances  learning  in schizophrenia  subjects  and extends  the finding  to an 8 
weekly, once -weekly dosing schedule.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Preliminary  study  of DCS  facilitation  of CBT for delusions : We also conducted  a random -order,  
counter -balanced,  two session  placebo -controlled  trial of DCS  facilitation  of CBT for delusions  
(32). Twenty -one schizophrenia  subjects  with medication -resistant  delusions  despi[INVESTIGATOR_498822]  50 mg or placebo  one hour 
prior to each  of two sessions  of CBT.  The CBT exercise  consisted  of an alternative  beliefs  task 
developed  by [CONTACT_498859]  (MGH)  which  trained  subjects  to formulate  alternative  
explanations  for a series  of benign  social  vignettes  leading  up to the formulation  of alternative  
explanations  for their delusional  belief.  Twenty  subjects  (95%)  completed  the two CBT 
sessions.  Subjects  who received  DCS  first exhibited  a large  reduction  (effect  size 0.8) in 
PSYRATS  measures  of delusional  severity  (figure  3, below)  compared  to subjects  who received  
placebo  first (p<0.05).  Consistent  with the finding  in animal  studies  that effects  of DCS are 
limited  to memory  consolidation  and are only observed  after a delay  of [ADDRESS_641768] exposure  
to a new form of training.  However,  this result  requires  confirmation  from a parallel  group  
design as we are now proposing.

Summary  of Innovation : This study  builds  upon  recent  findings  in translational  neuroscience  
supporting  a role for deficits  in thalamo -cortical  connections  and memory  consolidation  in the 
persistence  of delusions  and follows  from recent  data demonstrating  that, at low concentrations,  
DCS  is a highly  potent  and selective  agonist  at a subpopulation  of NMDA  receptors  involved  in 
memory  consolidation.  This subgroup  of NMDA  receptors  appears  to be specifically  down - 
regulated  in schizophrenia.  Although  DCS has been  well-established  as an effective  augmenter  
of CBT for anxiety  disorders,  this study  (and our pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251]) represents  the first application  of this 
approach  for delusions.  We are also the first group  (MGH)  to examine  memory  consolidation  
and fear extinction  in schizophrenia  and the first to examine  measures  of memory  consolidation  
and cognitive  flexibility  as potential  mediators  of DCS  effects  when  combined  with CBT.  If 
positive,  this study  could  lead to an entirely  novel approach  for the  treatment  of delusions.  
 
Characteristics  of the Research  Population:  
Number  of Subjects : Total  planned  enrollment  of randomized  subjects  for the study  is [ADDRESS_641769]  any effects.  In order  to 
achieve  adequate  enrollment,  we will consent  and screen  up to 140 individuals  which  will allow  
for a 40% screen  failure  rate. [ADDRESS_641770] schizophrenia 
patients when analyzing fMRI scans. Due to the innovative nature of the tasks patients are doing 
while in the scanner, the addition of hea lthy participants will allow us to better identify any neural 
differences in these two groups, specifically to see if D -cycloserine enhances connectivity in 
specific neural regions.  
Age of Subjects : Individuals  between  the ages  of 18-[ADDRESS_641771] no history of mental illness.  
 
Gender : Patients  enrolled  in this study  will reflect  the population  of schizophrenia  patients  
treated  at each  [LOCATION_001] University  Langone  Medical  Center  and Sheppard  Pratt  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  The 
estimated  rate of females  among  chronic schizophrenia  patients  is 35% at both sites.  
 
Racial  and Ethnic  Origin : Minorities  will be included  in this project  in proportion  to their 
representation  in the [LOCATION_001] City segment  of the population  served  by [CONTACT_498860][INVESTIGATOR_498823].  The targeted  
demographic  profile  for this study  is 70% White  or Caucasian,  26% Black  or African  American  
and 4% Asian  or multi -racial  with at least 17% identifying  as Hispanic.  [CONTACT_498890] and the DSMB  
will monitor  inclusion  rates  of women  and minorities.  We will target  a female  enrollment  rate of 
Study  #:S12 -[ZIP_CODE]  Version:  01/25/[ADDRESS_641772] 35%.  If the inclusion  rates  are not representative,  [CONTACT_498890] will implement  corrective  
action  including  the establishment of  additional referral  sources  as needed.  
 
Inclusion  and Exclusion  Criteria : Subjects  will be adult  outpatients  with schizophrenia,  
delusional  disorder  or schizoaffective  disorder,  ages  18-68, treated  with any antipsychotic  agent  
except  clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_498824],  stable  dose  for at least [ADDRESS_641773] 3 (moderate)  on the Scale  for Assessment  
of Psychotic  Symptoms  (SAPS)  global  delusion  score  at two assessments,  four weeks  apart.   
 
However in some study participants, the SAPS may not capture all relevant symptoms  related to 
the participant’s delusions which are a requirement of enrollment. If this  occurs, the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_498825]’s diagnosis and appropriateness for the study by 
[CONTACT_498861] -IV Axis I Disorders (SCID). With the 
subject’s consent, the study team will also con firm the symptoms of the subject with his/her 
current treatment provider to further ascertain appropriateness for the study.  
 
Additionally,  subjects  must  be free of serious  or unstable  medical  illness,  including  renal  
impairment  (creatinine  greater  than 1.4), seizures,  dementia,  anemia,  and cannot  be pregnant  
or nursing  or have  abused  substances  in the previous  6 weeks.  Subjects  with renal  
insufficiency  are excluded  because  DCS  is excreted  unchanged  in the urine;  anemia  is 
excluded  because  it is a rare side effect  of DCS.  A urine  toxic screen  and pregnancy  test (in 
females)  must  be negative  at screening.  Subjects  treated  with clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_498826]  (33).. Subjects treated with any SSRI will be ineligible because the PI [INVESTIGATOR_498827]’s prevent the effects of D -cycloserine on learning.   
 
Healthy subjects  will be adults between ages [ADDRESS_641774] any 
MRI contraindications.

Study  #:S12 -[ZIP_CODE]  Version:  01/25/2017   
 
 
Location : The study  will be conducted  at two sites.  The primary  site will be [CONTACT_498890]’s  lab within  
the Adult  Psychiatry  Clinical  Trials  Research  space  on the 8th floor of One Park Avenue  and at 
the Bellevue  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_498828] 2nd fl of the C & D building.  
Study  drug will be dispensed  by [CONTACT_498862].  Subject  recruitment  will occur  at 
Bellevue  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  If additional  subjects  are required,  the study  will also be conducted  at the 
Nathan  Kline  Institute  for Psychiatric  Research  (NKI)  which  recruits  subjects  from the 520-bed 
Rockland  Psychiatric  Center  on the NKI campus  and from a network  of affiliated  mental  health  
clinics.  [CONTACT_498890] is Vice Chair  for Research  in the Department  of Psychiatry  at NYU  and Director  
of the Schizophrenia  Program at  NYU/Bellevue as  well as Director  of the NKI.  
The second  site will be the Sheppard  Pratt Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_498829],  Maryland.  The study  will be 
carried  out by [CONTACT_498863][INVESTIGATOR_307].  [CONTACT_498891],  PhD, will  be the  site PI. Healthy subjects will be recruited from the NYU campus using 
web based advertis ements and flyers posted in NYU buildings, including in waiting rooms and 
bulletin boards at the medical center.  
Screening:  An initial  diagnostic  assessment  will be performed  by a research  psychiatrist  or 
psychologist  using  the Structured  Clinical  Interview  for DSM -IV (SCID),  all medical  records,  and 
interviews  with family  and clinicians.  The diagnosis  will be confirmed  at a weekly  consensus  
diagnostic  conference  chaired  by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Goff which  will also serve  to verify  adequacy  of 
antipsychotic  treatment.  A medical  review,  physical  examination  and routine  laboratory  tests  
including  electrolytes,  creatinine,  BUN,  glucose,  liver enzymes,  calcium,  phosphate,  
magnesium,  albumin,  CBC  and urinalysis  will be completed  to identify  unstable  medical  illness.  
A urine  toxicology  screen  and, in females,  a pregnancy  test, will also be obtained.  Additionally,  
DNA  will be taken at  this visit in order to analyze  BDNF  Val66Met  polymorphism.   
Healthy subjects will be screened using the S CID, Peters Delusion Index to rule out history or 
current mental illness or delusional thinking. Additionally, a WAIS -IV will be performed to exclude 
participants with below standard IQ.  
 
CBT/DCS  Protocol : Individual  manualized  CBT sessions  will last [ADDRESS_641775] two sessions  will focus  on engagement,  characterization  of 
delusions,  and formulation  of a treatment  plan.  Sessions  3 & [ADDRESS_641776]  of an alternative  
beliefs  exercise  as employed  in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_498830] a series  of benign  social  vignettes  (e.g.,  a taxi driver  is staring  at 
you),  culminating  with their own delusional  belief  (32). The exercise  is structured  with a fixed 
set of vignettes  which  allows  us to record  the number  of alternative  explanations  generated  by 
[CONTACT_498864] a measure  of cognitive  flexibility.  The remaining  8 sessions  
will include  exploration  of antecedents  of delusional  beliefs,  development  of a normalizing  
rationale,  cognitive  restructuring,  testing  of explanatory  models,  and review  and consolidation.  
Study  drug (DCS  50 mg or matching  placebo)  will be adminis tered  orally,  1 hour prior to 
sessions  3-12. Placebo  will be administered  prior to sessions  1 & 2. DCS  and matching  
placebo capsules will be formulated  by [CONTACT_498865].  
 
If a subject misses three consecutive study visits and corresponding CBT sessions, he/she will 
be withdrawn from the study. These missed visits and sessions may compromise the integrity of 
the study data and adversely affect the therapeutic alliance which is important in the CBT 
treatment.  
 
 
CBT will be provided  by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Iruma Bello,  a PhD psychologist  who trained  under  [CONTACT_498892]  at 
MGH  using  manualized  CBT protocols.  A second  PhD level therapi[INVESTIGATOR_498831].  To 
ensure  that there  will be no effect  due to CBT therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541],  balance  will be maintained  such  that 
each  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_498832].  
This will be accomplished  by a statistician  independent  of the study.  Before  initiation  of the 
study,  training  will be provided  by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Cather  who will also provide  weekly  supervision  by [CONTACT_98991] - 
Study  #:S12 -[ZIP_CODE]  Version:  01/25/2017   
conference  and will monitor  treatment  fidelity  by [CONTACT_498866] 20% of sessions  
using  the Cognitive  Therapy  for Psychosis  Adherence  Scale  (CTPAS)  (34). [CONTACT_498892]  recently  
participated  in the development  of the CBT protocol  and conducted  trainings  for the NIMH - 
funded  RAISE  Study.  Competency  will be defined  as a score  of at least [ADDRESS_641777]  be maintained  throughout  the study.  Additional  training  will be provided  if 
CTPAS  scores  drop below  10. 
 
Rationale  for DCS/CBT  protocol  design : The design  of our protocol  for combining  DCS  with 
CBT follows  from several  findings:  1.) DCS  effects  may decrease  over time with repeated  
dosing  (21) although  we believe  that once -weekly  dosing  reduces  the risk of tachyphylaxis,  2.) 
DCS is effective  for novel learning  only ( 22) and  3.) we previously  found  large effects  when DCS  
was combined  with the first of two sessions  of an alternative  beliefs  exercise  which   was 
designed  to exploit  DCS effects  on memory  consolidation  and cognitive  flexibility  (32). 
Therefore,  we will begin  with two introductory  sessions  unaccompanied  by [CONTACT_24331];  study  
drug will first be administered  with an alternative  beliefs  exercise  at session  #3. We will then 
continue  weekly  study  drug administration  one hour prior to CBT sessions  and will follow  
session  #3 with a second  session  of the alternative  beliefs  exercise  in order  to replicate  the 
intervention  provided  in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251] (two consecutive  sessions  of an alternative  beliefs  
exercise)  since  delusions  continued  to improve  following  the second  exposure  to the exercise.  
The remaining  [ADDRESS_641778]  CBT approaches  to delusions  to consolidate  
therapeutic  effects.  
 
We selected  a 12 session  CBT protocol  to ensure  an adequate  CBT intervention  in the placebo  
group  consistent  with clinical  practice.  Because  our treatment  is focused  on delusions  and their 
behavioral  consequences,  12 sessions  are adequate  whereas  longer  treatment,  such  as the 16 
session  protocol  that we developed  for our CBT monotherapy  trial, may be necessary  for 
treatments  that address  the full range  of schizophrenia  symptoms.  In support  of a brief 
treatment,  Turkington,  Kingdon  and colleagues  (9) developed  a 6-session  CBT protocol  which  
demonstrated  efficacy  compared  to treatment  as usual  in a sample  of 442 schizophrenia  
subjects  (9). In studies  of DCS  augmentation  of CBT for anxiety  disorders,  DCS  efficacy  
compared  to placebo  was greatest  in trials of short  duration  (2-5 weeks)  compared  to longer  
trials,  possibly reflecting tachyphylaxis  or a ceiling  effect  due to  the efficacy of  CBT administered  
alone  for anxiety  disorders  (24). Because  of the relatively  small  effect  of CBT for delusions  we 
do not expect  to encounter  a ceiling  effect.  Subjects  will receive  10 weekly  doses  of DCS  in our 
proposed  trial and we will track  the response  of delusions  over this time frame.  In our 8 week  
study  of DCS  facilitation  of cognitive  remediation,  enhancement  of learning  plateaued  between  
weeks  4-8; we anticipate  a similar  pattern  with DCS  facilitation  of CBT.  Our previous  
manualized  CBT protocols  were  developed  by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Corinne  Cather  based  on manuals  and 
casebooks  produced  by [CONTACT_498867]  (35). [CONTACT_498893]  and [CONTACT_498892]  will 
develop  a  manualized CBT  protocol   based   on  these  resources  with  consultation  from  [CONTACT_498894].  Other  texts  such  as those  produced  by [CONTACT_498868]  (36) Chadwick  and 
colleagues  (37) and  Nelson ( 38) will also be used.  
 
Rationale  for DCS  Dosing : DCS was developed  as an antibiotic  and used  at doses  of 500-2000  
mg/d  for tuberculosis  but is now rarely  used  due to psychiatric  and neurological  side effects  
(activation,  confusion  and seizures)  at these  doses.  It has a serum  half-life of 4 hours  and 
maximum  CSF concentrations  equal  to 80% of serum  concentrations  are achieved  2 hours  after 
oral dosing  (39). It has been  well-tolerated  and effective  at single  weekly  doses  of 50 to 500 
mg/d  in subjects  with anxiety  disorders  (40). A recent  review  found  that DCS  doses  of 50-[ADDRESS_641779]  effective  in anxiety  disorder  subjects  provided  they were  administered  within  one 
hour of CBT sessions  (25). In a placebo -controlled  dose  finding  trial, we found  that daily dosing  
with DCS  50 mg for two weeks  improved  negative  symptoms  and working  memory,  whereas  
doses  of 15 mg and 250 mg daily were  ineffective  (41). In three  trials  in which  DCS  50 mg was 
administered  as a single  dose  or once -weekly,  we found  enhancement  of memory  and 
enhancement  of CBT efficacy  for delusions  without  adverse  effects  (32, 42). At doses  above  
100 mg/d  DCS has been  associated  with worsening  of psychosis  in two studies  (43, 44) and in 
Study  #:S12 -[ZIP_CODE]  Version:  01/25/[ADDRESS_641780]  who achieved  
unusually  high serum  concentrations  (45).   Recent  studies  by [CONTACT_498869]  (17) 
Study  #:S12 -[ZIP_CODE]  Version:  01/25/[ADDRESS_641781]  at NR2C - 
containing  NMDA  receptors which  mediate memory  consolidation; at higher  concentrations DCS  
binds  as a partial  agonist  at NR2A  and NR2B  subunits  which  may contribute  to worsening  of 
psychosis  in some  patients.  Taken  together,  it appears  that the optimal  dose  of DCS  is 
approximately  50 mg; unlike  subjects  with anxiety  disorders,  schizophrenia  subjects  appear  at 
risk for worsening  of psychosis  at higher  doses.  Given  the extensive  prior experience  and the 
risk that higher  doses  will worsen  psychosis,  we do not believe  a dose  finding  trial is necessary  
and do not believe  exposing  schizophrenia  subjects  to a higher  dose  is justified.  In addition,  
DCS  serum  concentrations  will not be informative  in this once -weekly  dosing  trial since  steady  
state  will not be achieved  and given  the variability  in Tmax.  
 
 
IND Exemption:  
D-cycloserine is approved and has  been used  for over  [ADDRESS_641782]. Goff  has 
been  studying  D-cycloserine  50 mg/d in schizophrenia  for over 20  years  [51], including  6 
published  randomized placebo -controlled trials [5 2-57]; no serious  adverse events have  been  
observed  except  for worsening  of negative  symptoms  when  added to  clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]  [58, 59], which  
is excluded in  the current  trial. The IRB at the [LOCATION_005] General  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],  where  these  
studies  were  performed,  agreed  with [CONTACT_498890]’s judgment  that an  IND was  not necessary.  Since  
then, D -cycloserine 50 mg- 100 mg has been widely used  in psychiatry  for facilitation  of  
cognitive  behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders  and to reduce  drug craving —more  than [ADDRESS_641783]  been  published without  any serious  adverse  effects  identified [ 60].  In the current  
study  oral D -cycloserine  [ADDRESS_641784]  that single  doses  of 50  mg are 
only 10% of  the lower range  of doses  used for  treatment  of tuberculosis,  we believe this study  
does  not increase  the risk of the drug or the acceptability  of risks of the drug.  In addition,  results  
will not be used to  support  a new indication, a change  in labelling, or a change  in advertising of  
the drug.  On January 23, 2013, Steve  Hardemann  of the  FDA responded  to a letter from [CONTACT_498895] as follows: “…Thus,  the determination  of whether  an investigation  is exempt  is yours  to 
make,  and on its face your study does appear to be exempt.”  [CONTACT_498890]  did not proceed to  
formally request  an exemption  by [CONTACT_498870]. 
 
DNA  Collection,  Extraction,  Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]:  
Blood  will be collected  from all subjects  at the screening  visit for DNA  analysis.  DNA extraction,  
genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007],  and storage  will occur  at the NYU  CORE  lab. DNA  samples  will be labeled  with a 
numeric  ID only and delivered  same  day to the lab. Subjects  have  the option  during  consent  to 
allow  the biological  materials  (DNA)  collected  from them  to be stored  and possibly  made  
available  to qualified  researchers  in the scientific  community.  Other  researchers  who may 
conduct  research  on the DNA collected  from this research  project  will not have  access  to any 
confidential  information,  and any data shared  will contain  no PHI, but subject  codes.  The 
samples  will have  a random  code  and other  researchers  will have  no access  to the link. Only 
this research  group will  have the link in a password  protected database.  
Subjects  may request  at a later date,  through  the study  PI, that their genetic  material  not be 
used  for this study   If the subject  decides  to withdraw  permission  to use the DNA  for this study,  
Study  #:S12 -[ZIP_CODE]  Version:  01/25/[ADDRESS_641785]’s  genetic  material  by 
[CONTACT_498871].  
DNA  extraction  will be performed  immediately  after samples  are obtained,  and DNA  will be 
frozen  and stored  at -80 C until genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_498833].  BDNF  Val66Met  genotype  (rs6265)  
will be determined  with the Sequenom  MassArray  Platform  (Sequenom  Inc, San Diego,  CA) 
using  primers that  have  been  previously  described  [55]. 
 
 
Given  the low frequency  of Met/Met  genotype  (3.3%  in HapMap  Caucasian  subjects),  Met/Met  
and Met/Val  subjects  will be combined  into a Met carrier  group  for statistical  analysis,  which  will 
contrast  Val/Val  and Met carrier  subjects  on response  to clinical  measures  and gray matter  
volumes.  To control  for the possibility  of population  stratification  artifact,  race will be entered  as 
a co-variate  in genetic analyses.  
MRI Imaging, Data Acquisition,  Processing  and Analysis  Methods:  
Theories of systems -level memory consolidation propose that memories are initially encoded in 
the hippocampus and then are distributed across cortical regions over time (51,52). In 
accordance with this theory, successful long term memory in healthy adults has been linked to 
increased connectivity between the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (53). Thus, the 
impairment in memory consolidation in schizophrenia patients might be explained by a 
corresponding decrement in hippocampal -prefrontal connectivity.  
MRI images  will be performed  at the NYU  site only.  Two MRIs  without  contrast  will be performed  
as part of the study,  before  and after the first administration  of D-Cycloserine.  Specifically,  each  
of these  will consist  of the acquisition  of a high-resolution  MPRAGE  scan  that will be motion  
corrected  (Siemens  3 T Skyra,  resolution  1 mm3,  slices  = 192, TR = [ZIP_CODE]  ms, TE = 2.96 ms, 
FA = 9°, FOV = 256mm)  to create  a single  image  volume  with high contrast -to-noise,  a T2- 
weighted  anatomical  image  (1mm3,  slices  = 192, TR = 3200  ms, TE = 422 ms, FOV = 256mm).  
In addition,  several  scans  will be acquired  that will allow  us to determine  whether  D-cycloserine - 
induced  changes  in cortical  thickness  and hippocampal  volume  in the patients  are accompanied  
by [CONTACT_498872]  (measured  using  
diffusion  tensor  imaging  (DTI),  and resting -state,  functional  connectivity  MRI (FcMRI)).  Thus,  
one 6 minute,  18 second  long fcMRI  scan  (TR = 2500  msec;  TE = 30 msec;  flip angle  = 90; 
slices  = 46, 3 mm3  voxel  size),  and one approximately  9 minute  DTI scan  (TR/TE=7000/82  ms, 
b=700  s mm-2, 256x256  mm FOV,  128x128  matrix,  2 mm slice thickness,  10 T2 + 60 DWI)  will 
be acquired.  We will also collect  fMRI  data to examine  whether  d-cycloserine  has effects  on the 
function  of hippocampal  subfields.  Subjects  will look at stimuli  presented  via projector  on a 
screen  placed  at the back  of the bore.  They  will be instructed  to indicate,  using  a button  
response  box, how the stimuli  relate  to categories  and/or  one another.  During  fMRI,  subjects  
will complete  [ADDRESS_641786]  Blood  Oxygen  Dependent  
Level  (BOLD)  data (5 x 184 x 19 slices,  TR = 2000  ms, TE = 30 ms, Flip Angle  = 70°).  This task 
will take approximately  30 min. During  anatomical  scans,  subjects  will be asked  to merely  keep  
their eyes  open  and relax.  During  fMRI  and FcMRI  subjects  will be asked  to view images  and 
make  choices  (former)  and rest with their eyes  open  and focused  loosely  on the screen.  The 
entire  scan  will take approximately  1 ½ to 2 hours.   
Assessments : 
The SAPS  will be performed  at screening  and four weeks  later at baseline  to identify  subjects  
with persistence  of sufficient  delusional  severity  to enter  the study.  The clinical  assessment  
battery  will be comprised  of the Psychotic  Symptom  Rating  Scale  (PSYRATS),  Brief Psychiatric  
Rating  Scale  (BPRS),  Scale  for Assessment  of Negative  Symptoms  (SANS),  Calgary  
Depression  Scale  for Schizophrenia  (CDSS),  Clinical  Global  Impression  (CGI)  and Heinrich’s  
Quality  of Life Scale  (QLS).  We are using  this broad  battery  of tests to compare  treatment  
groups  at baseline  and to allow  exploratory  analyses  to help us understand  the effects  of DCS 
on our primary  outcomes  and to guide  selection  of outcome  measures  for future  studies.  The 
clinical  battery  will be administered  at baseline  and weeks  4, 8, 12, 24, and, in most  subjects,  
Study  #:S12 -[ZIP_CODE]  Version:  01/25/2017   
36.  In addition,  the Delusion  Subscale  of the PSYRATS  will be administered  at weeks  2, 3, 6 & 
10 to assess  the time course of DCS  effects on delusions.  Ratings  will be performed  prior to  the 
DCS/CBT  session  each  week.  Additionally,  the Drug  and Alcohol  Questionnaire  and the 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_498834].  Assessment  of cognitive  functioning  
will be measured  by [CONTACT_498873].  The SAFTEE  will be administered  at weeks  3, 4, 8, and 12. The SAFTEE  is a 
self-report  measure  on which  the participant  rates  the severity  of [ADDRESS_641787]  substantially  complied  with the protocol.   
 
The Psychotic  Symptom  Rating  Scale  (PSYRATS)  (46): The PSYRATS  is a well-validated  17 
item,  5 point  likert scale  which  contains  6 items  that characterize  delusions  according  to 1.) 
Amount  and duration  of preoccupation,  2.) Conviction,  3.) Amount  and intensity  of distress,  and 
4.) Disruption  to life. We selected  the PSYRATS  because  it frequently  has been  used  in CBT 
studies, because  we previously  demonstrated  that it captured response to DCS  augmentation  of 
CBT,  and, unlike  the Positive  and Negative  Syndrome  Scale  (PANSS),  Scale  for Assessment  of 
Psychotic  Symptoms  (SAPS)  and the Brief Psychiatric  Rating  Scale  (BPRS),  it rates  subjective  
distress  and the degree  to which  delusions  disrupt  life, both of which  are important  targets  of 
CBT.  Factor  analysis  has revealed  three  dimensions  (47): preoccupation,  conviction  and 
distress/life  disruption,  with modest  correlation  between  preoccupation  and conviction  (r=0.28)  
(46). We will use the Delusion  Subscale  total score  as our primary  outcome  measure  and, as 
an exploratory  analysis, we  will look  at the three  domains  to further  characterize  DCS  effects.  
 
 
Assessment  of memory  consolidation : The Logical  Memory  Test of the Wechsler  Memory  Scale  
(WMS -III) will be used  to measure  memory  consolidation,  as in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251] (30). Subjects  will 
be administered  Story  A one week  prior to baseline  and will be tested  on immediate  item and 
thematic  recall.  One week  later,  at baseline  they will be tested  on 7-day delayed  thematic  recall.  
At week  3, one hour after administration  of study  drug,  (immediately  before  the CBT session),  
participants  will be administered  story B, which will be tested  for delayed thematic  recall  
immediately prior to  administration  of study  drug the following  week.  This will allow  us to assess  
the effect  of the first dose  of DCS  on memory  consolidation  following  the same  protocol  that 
we used  successfully  in a previous  study  (30). The 2-week  gap between  administration  of 
story  A and story  B will minimize  potential  interference  between  tests.  
 
Assessment  of cognitive  flexibility : As our primary  measure  of cognitive  flexibility  we will record  
the number  of alternative  explanations  generated  by [CONTACT_498874]  3, 4 & 12. This measure  of cognitive  flexibility  is most  relevant  to our 
primary  outcome,  improvement  of delusions.  We will not administer  this measure  at baseline  
because  the exercise  is an essential  element  of the treatment;  it will be first administered  at 
week  [ADDRESS_641788] dose  of DCS  (or placebo)  to maximize  the treatment  effect  of the first 
dose  of DCS.  We have  previously  shown  that performance  on the Alternative  Beliefs  Exercise  
is not affected  when  measured  immediately  after DCS  administration  (32), so the week  [ADDRESS_641789]  performance  during  training —effects  
are only detectable  after a 24 hour delay.  Given  that other  measures  of cognitive  flexibility  (and 
negative  symptoms)  improved  in previous  studies  after 8 weeks  of daily dosing  with DCS  (26) or 
Study  #:S12 -[ZIP_CODE]  Version:  01/25/2017   
 
 
D-serine  (27), we will repeat  the Alternative  Beliefs  Exercise  at week  [ADDRESS_641790] at baseline  and week  12 
as measures  of cognitive  flexibility  unrelated  to training.  
 
Rater  Training : Training  on rating  scales  will be provided  by [CONTACT_6283]. Cather  and Bello  and will 
require  agreement  (r = 0.85)  with gold-standard  measures  on each  of 10 videotaped  ratings  of 
the SAPS,  PSYRATS,  SANS,  BPRS,  CDSS  and QLS as well as observed  rating  interviews  
conducted  by [CONTACT_152550].  Inter-rater reliability  and fidelity  with gold –standard  measures  will be 
maintained  with quarterly  training  which  will consist  of review  of ratings  on taped  interviews  
conducted  as part of the study.  Raters  will be required  to maintain  a criterion  of r = .[ADDRESS_641791]. Lila Davachi.  
 
Study Visits for Healthy Subjects  
Screening (Visit 1)  
Healthy subjects will be consented and screened for eligibility. Then, participants will perform a 
logical memory test, immediate recall test, and [ADDRESS_641792] (RCFT).  
 
Visit [ADDRESS_641793] set of MRI and fMRI scans.  
 
Visit 3  
Healthy subjects will complete the second set of MRI and fMRI scans.  
 
Visit 4  
Subjects  will perform a memory recall task from the fMRI scan on visit 3 and a story 
segmentation task based on the fMRI scan on visit 2..  
 
 
Data  Analysis  and Data  Monitoring  
 
Analysis  Plan:  
Primary:  Between  treatment  differences  in PSYRATS  Delusions  Subscale  
Mean  effects  in week  12. The mean  effect  of DCS  + CBT compared  to Placebo  + CBT on 
delusions  will be tested  using  a linear  mixed  model  repeated  measures  (MMRM)  analysis  of 
modified  PSYRATS  with fixed  terms  for study  visit, DCS/Placebo  treatment  group  and visit by 
[CONTACT_498875].  The model  will include  random  subject  effects.  Baseline  PSYRATS  will be 
included  in the model  together  with a baseline  by [CONTACT_498876].  The MMRM  will 
assume  a means  model,  an unstructured  covariance  matrix  and parameter  estimation  will be 
based  on restricted  maximum  likelihood.  Because  of the potential  for failure  of model  
convergence  due to the requirement  of a large  number  of interaction  terms,  only a few other  
covariates  will be considered.  These  may include  baseline  SANS  total score  and demographic  
variables  including  age and gender,  which  may be predictive  of outcome.  To test treatment  
difference  in change  from baseline  in PSYRATS,  we will use a pairwise  contrast  on the terms  
for DCS treatment  by [CONTACT_23259].  To examine  differential  treatment  effects  at each  CBT 
week if there  is significant  interaction, we will perform tests  of simple  main  effects.  A significantly  
larger  12-week  decline  in mean  PSYRATS  total score  for subjects  receiving  DSC  supports  the 
Study  #:S12 -[ZIP_CODE]  Version:  01/25/[ADDRESS_641794], will be controlled  
at 0.05,  and all tests  will be two-tailed.  Overall  alpha  will be maintained  at 0.05 for analyses  of 
primary  parameters.  No adjustments  will be made  for multiplicity  among  secondary  parameters  
analyzed.  Missing  data: The analysis  will utilize  the intention -to-treat principle.  All randomized  
subjects,  both completers  and non-completers,  will be included  in the analysis  without  
imputation.  Estimates  will be unbiased  if follow -up data that are missing  are “missing  at random”  
conditional  on the observed  data and model  assumptions.  
 
Secondary:  Characterizing  onset  and duration  of effectiveness  of DCS 
a and b. Testing  equality  of the distributions  of onset  and duration.  Onset  is defined  as the first 
week  at which  the criterion  for response  is met that lasts at least to the final week  of the 
treatment  period.  Kaplan -Meier  estimates  of the survival  distributions  of time to onset  of 
response  will be obtained  and the survival  distributions  will be compared  using  the log-rank test. 
The survival  distribution,  H(t), is the probability  that onset  will occur  after time t. Duration  is 
defined  as the number  of weeks  from onset  to offset.  Offset  for a responder  is the first week  at 
which  the criterion  for response  is no longer  met. The treatment  specific  survival  distributions  of 
duration  will similarly  be compared  using  the log-rank test. The null hypothesis  for the second  
primary  outcome  measure  is that there  is no difference  between  the two treatment  groups  in the 
proportion  of subjects  who are responders  (defined  as a 20% or greater  reduction  in PSYRATS  
Delusions  Subscale  total score)  beginning  in week  two to the end of the treatment  phase.  The 
statistical  analysis  will be based  on a repeated  measures  logistic  regression  model.  The 
independent  terms  in the model  will include  the same  variables  and covariates  used  in the 
MMRM  analysis.  By [CONTACT_498877],  there  cannot  be any  missing  data.  
 
c. Characterizing  the population  of responders.  An alternative  approach  to characterizing  onset  
when  there  is a substantial  fraction  of the population  who will never  respond  is to use a “cure  
model”  (48, 49). The approach  was recommended  by [CONTACT_21128],  in a specially  organized  
conference  to develop  an approach  to measuring  onset  in GAD  (49). The recommended  model  
assumes  that H(t) = (1-p) + pS(t)  where  H(t) is the survival  distribution  for the full population,  
S(t) is the conditional  survival  probability  of onset,  given  that onset  will occur  and p is the 
probability  that onset  will occur  e.g., that the subject  is a responder.  In the parametric  approach,  
the probability  of response,  p, will be modeled  with a logistic  and S(t) will be modeled  with a 
Weibull.  The equality  of the values  of p for placebo  and DSC  will be compared  using  a likelihood  
ratio test. There  are many  tests  of equal  conditional  survival  distribution  summarized  in Laska  
(49). In the statistical  models  for p and for S(t), baseline  variables  can be included   as 
covariates.  Those  that are statistically  significant  and that have  high influence  will be used  to 
identify  the population  of patients  most  likely  to be responders  in subsequent  trials.  
Nonparametric  estimates  of the probability  of response  at the end of the treatment  period  and of 
the conditional  survival  distribution  of onset  for those  achieving  onset  can also be obtained  to 
confirm  the results  of the parametric  model.  The Laska -Meisner  test will be used  to test equal  
probability  of achieving onset  (50). (Remove  the current  50 and  change  reference  51 to 50)  
 
Tertiary:  Identify  mediators  of delusional  response  to DCS  
a. Memory  Consolidation  Hypothesis . The primary  MMRM  model  described  above  will be used  
to test the predictive  value  of 7-day delayed  thematic  recall  on the Logical  Memory  Test after 
the first dose  of DCS.  The baseline  covariates  in MMRM  analysis  of modified  PSYRATS,  will be 
augmented  by [CONTACT_498878].  If statistically  significant,  a test of the hypothesis  that the 
coefficient  of the recall  term in the model  is not zero will demonstrate  the predictive  value  of the 
measure.  The magnitude  of the coefficient  is a measure  of the degree  to which  the variable  
effects  the PSYRATS  score  at week  12. The data for this analysis  is restricted  to those  subjects  
randomized  to DCS.  
b. Cognitive  Flexibility  Hypothesis . Just as for the memory  consolidation  hypothesis,  the primary  
MMRM  model  described  above  will be used  to test the predictive  value  of change  in the number  
of alternative  beliefs  generated  during  the first and second  administrations  of the Alternative  
Beliefs  Exercise  in the DCS  group  on the week  [ADDRESS_641795] whether  
Study  #:S12 -[ZIP_CODE]  Version:  01/25/2017   
positive  outcomes  on both the 7-day delayed  thematic  recall  measure  and the change  in the 
number  of alternative  beliefs  measure  produces  better  outcomes  on the week  12 PSYRATS  
score  than would  be expected  by [CONTACT_498879].  The analysis  will also investigate  whether  outcomes  
needs  to be positive  in both variables  for the DCS  treatment  to be effective.  In this analysis,  the 
model  will contain  both covariates  and an interaction  term.  If the interaction  term is statistically  
significant,  the sign of the estimated  coefficient  will indicate  synergy/antagonism  and the 
magnitude  of the coefficient  together  with the magnitude  of the coefficients  of the recall  and 
change  measure  quantifies  the joint effect on  the PSYRATS  week  12 score.  
 
Data  Storage  and Confidentiality:  
Data  Management  and Quality  Assurance : The Principal  Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_498835].  Based  upon  this experience,  a comprehensive  data 
management  methodology  combined  with strong  planning,  control,  coordination  and quality  
assurance  functions  will be implemented.  The primary  objectives  of the data management  
methodology  are to  insure  the completeness,  accuracy and  overall integrity of  the study  data.  
 
Easy  to complete  case  report  forms  (CRFs)  will be developed  to standardized  data collection  
across  all subjects. Most CRFs  will be forms  used  in previous  studies  that have  a track  record of 
successful  data collection.  The database  will be maintained  by [CONTACT_498880],  Iruma  
Bello,  PhD and will be stored  in her and the research  assistant’s  office.  To protect  
confidentiality,  all information  will be identified  by [CONTACT_498881]. DNA  samples  will be encoded  with 
a numeric  study  ID and the name  [CONTACT_498888] a password  protected  
database  that only the research  staff will have  access  to. DNA  samples  will be  stored  
indefinitely  at the NYU CORE  lab. Subjects  have  the option  during  consent  to allow  DNA 
samples  to be stored  and used  for future  research  related  to schizophrenia.  Genetic  tests will 
not be shared  with the participants  or their clinicians,  nor will the results  be placed  in the 
patient's  medical  records.  Additionally,  results  from the study will not be released  to participants.  
Data  that are identifiable  (consent  forms,  laboratory  results,  study  roster  and key) will be stored  
separately  in a locked  drawer  in these  offices.  All databases  will be password -protected.  Coded  
information  will be entered  and stored  in two secure,  password -protected,  databases.  Subject  
name [CONTACT_498889].  
Although  subject  date of birth will be entered  into our database  for administrative  purposes,  this 
information will not be viewable  and will  not be shared with anyone.  
 
Once  data collection  has started,  staff will review  all data,  with a special  focus  on the primary  
outcome  measures  and safety  data.  Missing  fields  and forms  are reviewed  to ensure  that 
research  staff are collecting  data as instructed  by [CONTACT_760],  and entering  data into the study  
database  within  the recommended  time frame.  All data are reviewed  for accuracy,  
completeness  and logical  consistency.  Inconsistencies  are documented  as data management  
queries.  Trends  in the queries  are monitored  and intervention  strategies  generated  to resolve  
any data issue.  Final  data clean  up will be completed  shortly  after the last subject  visit and the 
study  database will  be locked and  provided to  the study  statistician  for analyses.  
 
Study  recruitment,  enrollment,  and retention  will be monitored  to insure  that recruitment  goals  
are attained.  Study  screening  information  is reviewed  by [CONTACT_498882], assisting  with potential  strategies  to improve  study  
enrollment.  The ratio of screened  to randomized  subjects  is also reviewed  to reflect  the effort  
required  to successfully  enroll  subjects  in the study.  Research  study  visit attendance  will also 
be monitored  on an ongoing basis.  
 
Estimation  of statistical  power : We will enroll  up to [ADDRESS_641796] clinical  assessment  following  
study  drug administration.  Subjects  will be randomly  assigned  to DCS or Placebo  in a 1:1 ratio.  
This sample  size provides  greater  than 85% power  to detect  an effect  size of 0.[ADDRESS_641797]  with 10 
DCS -facilitated  CBT sessions  in this trial. Further,  the sample  size provides  greater  than 95% 
Study  #:S12 -[ZIP_CODE]  Version:  01/25/[ADDRESS_641798]  a difference  in the response  rate of DCS vs placebo  assuming  the response  
rate for placebo is 10% and the  response  rate for DCS is  50%.  
 
Risk/Benefit  Assessment  
Potential  Risks : Loss  of confidentiality  regarding  psychiatric  or medical  information  is a possible  
risk for which  precautions  will be taken.  Phlebotomy  may cause  soreness,  bruising,  bleeding  
and rarely,  infection.  A single  dose  of D-cycloserine  50 mg combined  with CBT was well- 
tolerated  in one cross -over study  of 20 subjects  exposed  to drug and weekly  dosing  of D- 
cycloserine;  50 mg was well-tolerated  in two studies  of schizophrenia  patients  (n=38  subjects  
exposed to  DCS) and  in eight  studies of anxiety  disorder patients.  However, it  is possible that  D- 
cycloserine  could  worsen  symptoms  of schizophrenia.  At high doses  (500-1,000  mg/d)  used  for 
the treatment  of tuberculosis,  D-cycloserine  has been  associated  with confusion,  lethargy,  and 
seizures.  High dose,  long-term daily administration  of D-cycloserine  has also been  associated  
with B12 and/or  folate  deficiency  anemia  (macrocytic  anemia).  It is also possible,  although  
unlikely,  that CBT will cause  anxiety  or agitation,  insofar  as it will entail  participants  examining  
their delusional beliefs.  
 
Protection  against  Risks : All patients  are carefully  screened  to avoid  enrollment  of anyone  for 
whom  study  procedures  or study  drug would  be potentially  harmful,  including  subjects  with 
unstable  medical  or psychiatric  illness,  recent  substance  abuse,  anemia  or insufficient  renal  
function.  Subjects  will be evaluated  by a physician  during  screening  and after the last dose  of D- 
Cycloserine.  A complete  blood  count  (CBC)  will additionally  be performed  at screening  and after 
the last dose  of D-Cyclosreine.  . If the hemogloblin  drops  below  13.5 mg/100  ml for male  or 12 
mg/100  ml for female  subjects  with a mean  corpuscular  volume  (MCV)  greater  than 100 
(macrocytic  anemia  consistent  with B 12 or folate  deficiency),  the anemia  will be evaluated  and 
treated  as clinically  indicated.  The Side Effect  Checklist  for assessment  of drug side effects  will 
be administered  at every visit and neurological  side effect scales  will be completed  monthly.  
All information  will be identified  by [CONTACT_498881].  Data  that are identifiable  (consent  forms,  
laboratory  results,  study  roster  and key) will be stored  separately.  All databases  will be 
password -protected.  Study  drug will be suspended  if significant  clinical  worsening  is detected  by 
[CONTACT_498883].  The CBT protocol  will be designed  to avoid  the 
triggering  of excessive  anxiety  or stress.  In addition,  a DSMB  will review  the protocol  prior to 
initiation  and will  monitor  safety  during  the trial.  
 
Justification  of Potential  Risks : The risks associated  with this  trial are minimal  and the potential  
scientific  and clinical  benefits are considerable.  Appropriate  safeguards  will be  in place to  
ensure  that the risk does not outweigh the  scientific  benefit.  
 
Potential  Benefits to  the Subjects:  All subjects will receive  a comprehensive  psychiatric and  
medical  evaluation and optimal clinical  treatment  as part of the NYU/Bellevue  Outpatient  
Psychiatry  Department.  They  will also receive a  CBT intervention  which is not routinely  
available.  Subjects will  be closely  monitored  for safety.  It is possible  that subjects  randomized  
to d-cycloserine may benefit with  an improved clinical  course,  although this  potential benefit  has 
not been established by  [CONTACT_275166].  
 
Subject  Identification,  Recruitment,  and Consent/Assent  
Method  of Subject  Identification  and Recruitment:  The research  team’s  psychiatrists  and 
psychologist  are credentialed  treating  clinicians  at the Bellevue  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_498836],  and are 
part of the treating  team  for clinical  care purposes.  In order  to further  insure  protection  of privacy  
for this patient  population,  patients  will not be contact[CONTACT_498884].  Clinicians  in the Outpatient  Psychiatry  Clinic,  Inpatient  Psychiatry  Units  and the 
Comprehensive  Psychiatry  Emergency  Program  at Bellevue  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_498837]  #:S12 -[ZIP_CODE]  Version:  01/25/2017   
 
 
as well as a document  listing  the inclusion/exclusion  criteria  in order  to facilitate  recruitment.  
This will allow  the initial  treating  clinicians  to help identify  potential  subjects  as well as provide  
interested  individuals  with basic  study -related  information.  Potential  subjects  identified  by [CONTACT_498885] a researcher.  If the 
patient  agrees,  the initial  treating  clinician  will then contact  [CONTACT_498886]  (psychologist  or psychiatrist)  will go and meet  with the 
patient  at that time or whether  they will meet  with the patient  during  the next scheduled  clinic  
appointment.  During  this meeting,  the study  will be explained  to the potential  participant  and in 
the event  that the individual  is interested  in participating,  s/he will then be given  the consent  
form to read and review.  In addition  to the study  consent  form,  participants  will be given  a 
second  consent  form asking  them  to participate  in providing  anonymous  quotes  to be used  in 
the research  group’s  website  for advertisement  purposes.  All recruitment  and screening  will be 
conducted  only during the face to  face consenting process.  
 
Process  of Consent:  Patients  who are interested  in participating  in the study  will meet  with a 
doctoral  level member  of the study  staff who will review  the consent  form and assess  the 
patient's  capacity  for participation  in research  in accordance  with our standardized  research  
procedures.  After signing  consent,  participants  will be assessed  for eligibility.  Subjects  will be 
remunerated  for each  study  visit in amounts  commensurate  with the time commitment.  
Reimbursement  will also be  provided  for participant travel  expenses  to and from the  study  site. 
 
Subject    Capacity    and   Subject/Representative    Comprehension : Subjects  capacity  for 
participation  in research  will be reviewed  by a doctoral  level member  of the study  staff during  
the consenting  process  as well as by a psychiatrist  on staff.  The clinician  obtaining  the informed  
consent  will take steps  to ensure  that the participant  is capable  of consenting  and participating  
in the study. The clinician  will ensure that  the individual understands  the content  and procedures  
of the study,  their rights  as a participant,  and their right to discontinue  participation  at any time.  
Individuals  who are not able to demonstrate  this level of comprehension  will be excluded  from 
participation.  In addition,  the potential  subject  must  also achieve  a perfect  score  on a ten-item 
true/false  quiz that asks questions  about  the study  procedure  and potential  risks.  After  the 
consent  form has been  signed,  the subject  will be provided  with a letter  detailing  study -related  
information  and contact  [CONTACT_498887].  
 
Debriefing  Procedures : The only  information withheld from  subjects  is whether the type  of 
medication  they are on is  active  drug or placebo.  Subjects  will understand that  they are blinded.  
 
Consent  Forms: Consent  forms  will be stored  in a personal file  with the patients  initials.  This file  
will be separate  from any of the  subject’s study  data in order  to separate  their data from  any 
identifying information.  
 
Costs  to the Subject: There  are no costs  to the subject  associated with  the study.  Transportation  
will be reimbursed.  Study  procedures  are paid  for via an NIMH grant.  
 
Payment  for Participati on: Total  compensation  for the  study  will be $400.00. Compensation  
breakdown is  as follows:  
 
 $10 for visits 2, 4, 8, 9,  10, 12, 13, and 14  $80 
 $30 for the screening  visit, visits 3, 7, 11, 15, 16, and 17 $210 
 $[ADDRESS_641799] MRI  $50 
 $60 for visit 6 $60 
TOTAL:  $400.00

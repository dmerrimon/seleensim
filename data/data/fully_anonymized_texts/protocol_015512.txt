 2 1. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_90097] ( HF), there remains  substantial 
residual morbidity and mortality. Even with  insights into diverse mechanisms of myocardial 
dysfunction, virtually all current medical treatment is focused on  modulating  the “neurohormonal axis”. 
Our project extends the HF treatment principles  to an emerging frontier , the ketone “metabolic axis” , 
as a means of ameliorating symptoms through exogenous delivery of a ketone ester. We seek to 
understand whether supplementation with a ketone ester can improve functional capacity in patients 
with H F and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF ), while simultaneously performing deep phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_90098] , hemodynamic, and echocardiographic pathways a ltered with such 
therapy.  If beneficial, our results would provide critical proof of concept for targeting the “metabolic 
axis” a s a treatment strategy to help improve exercise capacity and quality of life  in heart failure and 
would inspi[INVESTIGATOR_90099], randomi zed trials of ketone therapy.  
 
2.    SPECIFIC AIMS   
HF is a major public health problem: it affects 6.2 million people in the U.S.1 The lifetime risk for 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_90100] 40 years approaches 20%,2 and five -year survival after HF 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2138] a dismal 35%,  regardless of the underlying ejection fraction (EF).[ADDRESS_99311] been described in HFpEF.5 Targeting the 
metabolic axis in HF therefore may hold great therapeutic promise.  
 
Under physiol ogic conditions, fatty acids are the predominant energetic substrate for the heart, 
providing 50 -70% of the ATP need . Glucose  serves as a secondary source , necessary for flexibility 
and adaptive fuel utilization shifts during embryologic develo pment and during a diverse array of 
nutritional and physiologic conditions.6, [ADDRESS_99312] a unique opportunity to study  a nutraceutical  ketone ester ( KE), (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R) -
3-hydroxybutyrate  (commercially known as “DeltaG”) , that provides systemic ketosis  in a deep 
phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_90101] .9 Initial studies  of DeltaG  demons trated significant improvement 
in exercise capacity among endurance athletes.10 Because exercise limitation is a cardinal feature of 
HF, KE therapy has the potential  to likewise improve exercise capacity in HF pEF.  
 
Our Specific Aims  and Hypotheses  are as follows:  
Aim 1. To determine the acute effects of single dose DeltaG  administration on maximal (peak VO 2) 
and submaximal exercise capacity  (exercise time) assessed by [CONTACT_90123] (CPET ) among patients with HFpEF. 
 3  Hypothesis: DeltaG  will improve peak VO [ADDRESS_99313] of DeltaG  on metabolic  and biomarker profiles  
during exercise.  
Hypothesis: DeltaG  will reduc e lactate production  during exercise .  
 
Aim 2. To assess the effects of DeltaG on cardiovascular hemodynamics  during exercise.  
Hypothesis: DeltaG  will reduce  systemic  vascular resistance  as well as demonstrate 
improvements in cardiac output  at peak exercise compared to placebo.  
 
Aim 3. To profile the effects of ketone ester versus placebo on systemic and plasma carbohydrate 
metabolism during exercise using indirect calorimetry and stable isotopes (2H-glucose) techniques  
 Hypothesis: Delta G will reduce systemic carbohydrate utilization at steady -state during  
submaximal exercise, with concordant reductions in plasma glucose oxidation  
  
Overall  impact : Our objective is to determine whether nutritional ketosis provide s a therapeutic benefit 
in HFpE F). Strengths include the use a readily available KE drink with a favorable safety profile as 
well as detailed phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_90102] s of potential benefit among patients with 
HFpEF. We leverage the expertise of collaborators with rich experience and expertise in ketone 
metabolism in HF, metabolomic profiling, deep phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_90103] , and assessment s of ventriculoarterial interactions.  We anticipate that our results will  
enhance  the understanding of “metabolic axis” of HF and identify a therapeutic intervention of 
substantial importance . Further, o ur methodology provides a robust framework to underst and the 
impact of altered metabolism  and exogenous ketone delivery  in HF pEF that can easily be scaled and 
applied to other cardiovascular diseases , such as left ventricular hypertrophy, inherited 
cardiomyopathies , and/or  cardiogenic shock , as well as test the ergogenic benefits of other 
pharmacologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] . 
 
3. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
HF affects 6.2 million Americans and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality in the 
contemporary era.1 By 2030, the burden of HF is anticipated to  surpass  8 million with an associated 
economic toll of a staggering $69.8 billion .1 The cardinal clinical feature of  patients with HF is reduced  
exercise capacity, which is associ ated with a substantial reduction  in quality of life.11 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_90104],  particularly among those with reduced 
ejection fraction (EF),  many still suffer from limitations in exercise capacity  and a poor prognosis . As 
such, exploring other avenu es to reduce  morbidity from HF is of vital interest from  societal, economic, 
clinical,  and patient -centered perspectives .  
 
Ketone bodies  (acetoacetate, β -hydroxybutyrate [ BHB ], and acetone)  are water -soluble molecules 
produced from acetyl -CoA following  breakdown of fatty acids  (and amino acids) mainly in hepatic 
cells. Ketone bodies are typi[INVESTIGATOR_90105], but are 
produced continuously during metabolic stress conditions and/or periods of carbohydrate depriv ation 
such as acute medical stress, prolonged exercise , or starvation,  and become  a key source of energy 
to vital organs including the brain and heart under th ese circumstances.12 Ketone production has long 
been teleologically considered as a means to provide the brain with an efficient, alternative fuel 
source  during starvation, sparing carbohydrate and protein stores, since the brain cannot effectively 
metabolize free fatty acids  (which represent 99% of the body’s energy stores ).12, [ADDRESS_99314] a respi[INVESTIGATOR_90106] (acetoacetate = 
1.0, BHB = 0.89)  and produce greater amounts of ATP,  releasing approximately 30% more energy 
per molecule than pyruvate.14, [ADDRESS_99315] been treated, or are under study , with ketone therapy, such as epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], Parkinson’s 
disease, and Alzheimer’s disease.16  
 
Given  the beneficial effects on glucose control and weight loss, ketone therapy has also been 
considered to treat diabetes mellitus.17 Indeed, ketone therapy has been shown to reduce insulin, 
ghrelin, and GLP -1.18 Macronutrient resourc es (low glucose, high free fatty acids) and hormonal 
signaling (low insulin, high glucagon, high cortisol) are the primary methods of regulat ing ketone 
production, and thus dietary modification has been studied extensively to treat these conditions (the 
“ketogenic diet”).  Adherence to this diet, however,  can be challenging,  and may also be accompanied 
by [CONTACT_90124][INVESTIGATOR_035]  (due to increased flux of free fatty acids) , impaired cardiac metabolism,  or gastro -
intestinal upset,  leading to interest in  alternative exogenous modes of delivery.19, 20 Exogenous 
delivery of ketones holds several advantages over dietary modification  such as increased 
compliance, l ack of alteration on other fuel stores (such as intramuscular glycogen) , and its unique 
effect of lower ing both  glucose and free fatty acids due to  negative feedback on lipolysis.[ADDRESS_99316] been studied, including ketone salts and KE. Oral 
ketone salts , unfortunately,  result in a very high amount of salt intake (which would be problematic for 
patients with HF)  and results in half  the plasma concentration of D -betahydroxybu tyrate (D -BHB).19 A 
novel KE compound, (R) -3-hydroxybutyl (R) -3-hydroxybutyrate  (DeltaG) , has been extensively 
studied for the purposes of th erapeutic exogenous ketosis and is approved as a nutraceutical by [CONTACT_5212] (FDA).9, 10, 18, 19, 22 -24 Advantages of DeltaG  consumption include a  
rapid rise of blood levels of BHB in humans  to ~3 mmol/L  within 60 minutes of consumption  of 282 
mg/kg of KE , equivalent to a week of fasting , which is markedly increased from the levels of 
detectable ketones in normal populations (<0.5 mmol/L).9, 19, [ADDRESS_99317] of comparison, a 
carbohydrate -restricted (high -fat) diet typi[INVESTIGATOR_90107], with BHB levels of  
0.5 mmol/L, which is currently considered as the accepted definition of ketosis.[ADDRESS_99318] clinical benef it, such as in HF.10  
 
Recently, further  data has emerged regarding potential benefits of intravenous infusions of sodium -3-
hydroxybutyrate.26 In a crossover study of 16 patients with HF and reduced EF (HFrEF) randomized 
to 6 hours of ketone infusion vs. isotonic saline (placebo arm),  infusion of the ketone increased 
cardiac out put by 2 L/min with an absolute improvement in left ventricular EF of 8%. Importantly, 
systemic vascular resistance decreased by 30% with the ketone infusion.26 This may be uniquely 
important in HFpEF patients, who demonstrate an impaired ability to reduce systemic vascular 
resistance with exercise.27 Furthermore, to contextualize the magnitude of increase , this improvement 
in cardiac output is comparable to that achieved with an intra -aortic balloon pump (typi[INVESTIGATOR_90108] 0.5-1.0 L/min ) or an Impella 2.5 ( typi[INVESTIGATOR_90109] 2.0 -
2.5L/min ).28 Notably, the hemodynamic effects of ketones were dose -dependent and detectable  even  
in the physiological concentration range.  While important, this trial was limited by [CONTACT_90125] (impractical for the outpatient management ), enrollment only of patients with 
reduced EF, and concerns related to salt infusion , such as pH disturbances and sodium loading. In 
addition, this trial did not assess patient -centered metrics, such as exercise capacity, which is an 
important determinant of quality of life in HF.[ADDRESS_99319] half of all cases of HF in the [LOCATION_002].30 Among patients with pres erved EF and pressure 
overload induced by [CONTACT_90126] (conditions that simulate non -valvular HFpEF wit h resultant left 
ventricular hypertrophy) , there is a significantly greater myocardial uptake of ketones compared to 
controls.31 Because  “late”  left ventricular systolic loading from reflected waves in the periphery induce  
left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction, it stands to reason that the vasodilatory effect of 
KE therapy may be beneficial.32, 33 In addition,  among diabetic patients (a population at significant risk 
for HFpEF), SGLT2 inhibitors reduce HF hospi[INVESTIGATOR_90110], an 
intriguing pair of findings that may be  causally linked.[ADDRESS_99320] systoli c function 
(myocardial strain) , diastolic function,  autonomic tone, and ventriculo -vascular interactions . We 
further seek  to understand the changes in metabolism induced by [CONTACT_90127].  
 
4.   Preliminary Results  
DeltaG is a  ketone ester (KE) that undergoes complete enzymatic hydrolysis to form BHB (and R-1,3-
butanediol)  by [CONTACT_90128], including within the gastrointestinal tract, liver , 
and blood. R -1,3-butanediol, itself, is further metabolized in the liver by [CONTACT_22705] -pass metabolism to 
produce BHB by [CONTACT_90129]. BHB undergoes further 
metabolism to acetoacetat e and acetone, though only BHB and acetoacetate are taken up by [CONTACT_90130].   
 
KE is eliminated through at least first order kinetics and capacity limited elimination. Elimination is 
accomplished via 3 predominant means, including  (1) conversion to acetone and lung exhalation, (2) 
renal elimination (of BHB and acetoacetate, though this contribution is negligible particularly during 
exercise), and (3) uptake by [CONTACT_90131] P.10, 23  
 
Concentrations of the KE compound of roughly  3-5 mmol/L are reached within [ADDRESS_99321] levels of administration (714 mg/kg).9, 35  
 
 
5.   Research Design and Methods  
Overview:  The overall study design  will be a randomized , double -blind  crossover  comparison of 
DeltaG  therapy vs. KE -free vehicle in 20 patients with HFpEF. The main outcomes will be measures

cardiovascular metrics.  The CHPS will provide many  study services requested through a Doris Duke 
Charitable Foundation award (to SS) .

Overall structure of Exercise Visits  (visits 1 -3) 
 
Figure 1. Flow Diagram of CPET Study V isit Days  

Version Date: 1/ 15/[ADDRESS_99327] come for a baseline visit (Figure 1 ) during which they will undergo cardiopulmonary 
stress testing in order to determine ~75% of peak work rate . This will allow us to determine  the 
workload for  submaximal testing  (Table 1 ). We will also perform baseline echocardiography at this 
visit.  
 
Rationale for selection of exercise tolerance 75% peak work rate  and titration procedure:  
We aim to target a workload that resembles the workload experienced by [CONTACT_90134], increasing clinical applicability. Selecting too low of a workload, however, could lead to 
subjects stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_90115], as opposed to the physiologic 
processes we seek to modify.   Given this, we will perform a familiarization exercise test at ~75% peak 
work rate  during the baseline visit, foll owing the maximal effort study, and modify our submaximal 
exercise workload based on the subject’s performance.  We will titrate the workload to target a time to 
exhaustion of ~3-6 minutes, as longer tests may be limited by [CONTACT_90135] a 
physiologic limitation.  Subjects will begin with a 1 minute period of exercise at 0W, followed by a step 
increase to 75% peak work load performed until exhaustion. If the subject exercises for >6 minutes, 
the workload to be used in subsequent studies will be increased by 10W or 15%, whichever is 
greater; if the exercise time is <3 minutes, the workload will be reduced by 10W or 15%, whichever is 
less. 
While the preceding maximal effort study may confound  submaximal  exercise time, the 
submaximal  protocol will always follow a maximal effort study during the assessments. Moreover, 
adding another study visit to perform this familiarization study would increase subject burden .

submaximal protocol  (75% PW).  Same as visit 1 and 
also includes possible 
additional IV with 
stable isotope infusion  KE drink or placebo (the 
opposite  arm from Visit 2)  
 
Approximately w ithin 2 weeks of Visit 1 (range of 1 -4 weeks) , participants will undergo 
cardiopulmonary (VO 2) exercise testing during Visit 2  following a dose of KE versus PB. Visit 2  
includes a  maximal intensity CPET , followed by a submaximal intensity CPET  at 75% PW . After a >5 
day washout period ( 1-4 weeks ), partic ipants return for Visit 3. Visit 3 is identical to Visit 2, except that 
the study participant will receive the other intervention not receive d during the previous visits  (cross -
over) . These visits will allow us to determine the difference in maximal and submaximal exercise 
 [ADDRESS_99328] of exogenous ketones on lactate production on MRI. In these participants, the MRI scanning 
sessions may be interleaved with the visits delineated in thi s protocol. For example, following CPET 
Visit 2, participants may undergo skeletal muscle MRI with plantar flexion exercise ~3 -7 days later, 
receiving the same interventional compound as Visit 2  (Placebo or Ketone) . Following CPET Visit 3, 
participants may  then undergo a skeletal muscle MRI with plantar flexion exercise, receiving the 
same interventional compound as Visit 3  (Ketone or Placebo) . If scheduling does not allow for this, 
the MRI studies will be performed following a waiting period of at least a week after the last CPET 
study.  
 
 
CPET Study Design  
Patients will be asked  (though not required)  to avoid alcohol and caffeine consumption in the [ADDRESS_99329] beginning at midnight  prior to study initiation ,19 though water consumption will be 
freely permitted. Treatm ent order will be randomized prior to commencement using a random number 
generator  by [CONTACT_90136] . Participants will be 
randomized in a crossover, double -blind fashion to: 1) 500 mg/kg (prior to max incremental CPET) 
and 250 mg/kg ( prior to submax CPET) KE versus a  placebo  drink . By [CONTACT_90137], the liver  
produces 30 -60 grams of ketones  after overnight fasting , accounting for 2 -6% of energy needs .23, 41 
Weight -based dosing of ketone therapy has been shown to be crucial to replicating ketone levels 
between participants.19 The control drink  will be furnished by [CONTACT_90138] .42 Compliance will be defined as consumption of >85% of the drink 
volume. Light breakfast and lunch will be provided  through CHPS . 
  
The study intervention  will be administered approximately 1 hour prior to exercise for the maximal 
incremental  protocol .9, 10 Because of logistical issues, up to 105 minutes after drink consumption will 
be allowable without deviation. For the submax protocol, we will provide  a half -dose of study drug  ~30 
minutes prior to exercise since it is expected that some of the compound will be in the body still from 
the max effort CPET. For similar logistical issues, up to 60 minutes will be allowable without deviation. 
For comparison, website marketing of the commercial drink recommends ingestion 30 minutes prior 
to athletic performance , with additional dosing  every 1.5 -2.0 hours (https://hvmn.com/ketone -ester , 
accessed 12/7/2019) . 
 
At the end of Visit 3, the participants will be asked if they knew which arm th ey were randomized to 
and how confident they were  using a validated blinding assessment tool .43  
 
Cardiopulmonary exercise testing  
We will use  a supi[INVESTIGATOR_90116] a metabolic cart to measure  expi[INVESTIGATOR_90117].  
 
Maximal intensity protocol: Subjects will perform a maximal exertion -limited exercise test using a 
graded -exercise protocol. Resistance will begin at 15 Watts (W) for [ADDRESS_99330].  
 
We will define p eak oxygen uptake (VO 2) as the average value during the final 30 seconds of 
exercise. The gas exchange/ventilatory threshold (VT) will be  determined using both the V -slope and 
 10 ventilatory equivalent methods, with the results of the two measurements averaged  when both are 
valid. VE/VCO 2 slope will be  calculated from the beginning of exercise until exhaustion . The 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_17864] (RER) will be  calculated as the ratio of VCO 2 to VO 2 during the final 30  
seco nds of exercise . We will model heart rate  and VO 2 recovery following exercise.   
 
The primary outcome of the maximal testing study will be  difference  in peak VO 2 following  ketone 
therapy as compared to the placebo  drink . Secondary cardiopulmonary exe rcise testing endpoints 
include  exercise efficiency ( ratio of work performed to oxygen  consumed ), total work performed , 
ventilatory threshold, VE/VCO 2 slope , VO 2 and heart rate recovery.  
 
Submaximal intensity protocol: Resistance will begin with 1 minute of unloaded pedaling followed  by 
a step -increase to 75 % of peak workload  (or the workload determined at the first visit). Workload  will 
then be held at this intensity until volitional exhaustion or limiting symptoms prevail (e.g. subject 
cann ot continue despi[INVESTIGATOR_90118], or subject is unable to maintain pre -specified pedal 
cadence despi[INVESTIGATOR_90118]) . Vital signs will be monitored during the test.  We will assess 
exercise endurance time at 75% peak work rate. We may also assess VO 2 kinetics , including Tau, 
which is the time needed to reach 63% of the total response amplitude , and describe the rate/slope of 
VO 2 recovery. We will also  assess VO 2 efficiency (total O 2 consumed to total work performed) , and 
the respi[INVESTIGATOR_90119], amongst other parameters gathered during the exercise test s. 
 
The primary outcome for this submaximal part of the study is the difference in exercise endurance at 
75% peak work rate  following ketone therapy as compared to placebo.  
 
Electrocardiograph y 
A resting [ADDRESS_99331] blood testing is performed at Visit 1 for baseline analysis. This may include  a CMP, CBC, 
NT-proBNP, lipid profile, hemoglobin  A1c (approximately 20 mL of blood).  
 
We will draw blood frequently before drug, after drug, and during exercise and recovery for 
measurements. The lab testing protocols  are in  Table 2  with approximate  times noted  for planned  
lab draws ( note: given the multitude of lab draws, missing laboratory draws will not be counted as 
deviations  nor is exact timing required for laboratory draws) . At Visit 2 and 3 , a tertiary goal of  blood 
sampling is to assess the pharmacokinetic (assess circulating ketone levels resulting from the 
DeltaG ) and pharmacodynamic (assess biologic effects of the DeltaG ) impact of DeltaG . BHB will be 
the primary means of determining therapeutic absorption . We will recreate pharmacokinetic  curves 
including C max (peak serum concentration achieved by [CONTACT_9934]), T max (time at peak serum concentration), 
and area under the curve (AUC).  
 
Blood samples will be stored at -80C f or later analysis . We may perform comprehensive metabolomic 
profiling from this peripheral blood , in addition to other tests .

Stable Isotope Infusion  
 A secondary goal of this proposal is to understand the metabolic changes induced by [CONTACT_90139]. As described above, ketones have been shown to reduce glucose utilization in 
both healthy10, 24, [ADDRESS_99333] calorimetry, using the data from gas exchange (c arbon dioxide production rate and 
oxygen uptake rate) to derive rates of systemic carbohydrate and fatty acid oxidation.46, 47 Yet 
systemic measurements do not identify the source of the substrate utilized (i.e. plasma -derived 
versus intramuscular) , which may vary with exercise intensity,  gender, and possibly disease state.48-50 
Knowing whether there is a deficit in substrate import, leading to alterations in utilization, could lead to 
new therapeutic opportunities.  
 Stable isotopes, in which the molecular weight of an atom is slightly increased due  to 
additional neutrons  within the nucleus , are naturally -occurring, non -radioactive, and are handled 
similarly by [CONTACT_90140].51 The higher molecular weight of the 
compound allows this ‘label’ to be traced throughout the body and the plasma using mass -
spectometry. When infused into the blood , rates of endogenous production  and utilization  can be 
computed . Comparison  of systemic oxidatio n rates with those derived from plasma measurements 
allows for an estimation of oxidation rates from intramuscular stores.[ADDRESS_99334] endogenous glucose utilization, we may infuse [6,6 -
2H2] glucose during the submaximal exercise in a subset of participants.  Participants will be 
administered stable isotope pending ability to place a second, contralatera l IV. In such cases, 
infusions will be started ~1.5 hour prior to submaximal exercise, and initiated with a 5 mg/kg priming 
dose (MW 182.17 g/mole; 27.45 umol/kg ; delivered over 5 minutes ) followed by a continuous infusion 
at 0.05 mg/kg/min (0.2745 umol/kg /min), leading to a 100:1 prime/continuous infusion ratio.52 We note 
that this prime/infusion protocol is well established and is used on campus by [CONTACT_90141].53 
The stable isotope will be infused intravenously, with sampling done from a peripheral vein on the 
contralateral extremity . A typi[INVESTIGATOR_90120]: (a) prior to s tart of 
infusion, (b) every ten minutes following the start of the continuous infusion, (c) densely around 1 
hour after delivery of the prime and start of the continuous infusion  (for example, at 55, 60, and 65 
minutes) , (c) every ten minutes following administration of the study intervention and immediately 
prior to the start of exercise, (d) every 2 minutes during  exercise, ( e) at the time of exhaustion, ( f) 
every 2 minutes during  recovery for 10 minutes  (Table 3) . Plasma samples will be stored for later 
mass -spec analysis.  Additional blood samples may also be taken.  It is anticipated that the addition of 
stable isotopes to the submaximal study will only require ~30 mL/ of additional blood /endpoint 
assessment visit , as mass spec trometry  measurements can be  made on a small volume  (<2 mL) .  
 12  
We estimate that sampling blood for the stable isotope measurements during submaximal exercise 
will increase the amount of blood drawn by [CONTACT_3450] 30 mL/visit (total of 60 mL for Visits 2 and 
3).

infusion and  every 10 minutes following infusion. Additionally, after  ~1 hour of infusion  dense sampling 
will be done  (55 minutes, 60 minu tes, and 65 minutes)  prior to administration of the intervention.  After 
the intervention, s amples will be drawn every [ADDRESS_99336] and during exercise (though 
views may be more limited during exercise due to respir ophasic motion of the heart) . Metrics of 
cardiac performance and hemodynamics will be measured and may include  (pending adequate 
border definition) : left atrial str ain, g lobal  left ventricular  longitudinal strain , and strain rate may be 
 13 assessed using TomTec Cardiac Performance Analyses (TomTec Imaging Systems, 
Unterschleissheim, [LOCATION_013])  or similar commercial software in the api[INVESTIGATOR_2855] [ADDRESS_99337] and during the exercise study . In total, 
endpoints may include , but not limited to,  left atrial strain, left ventricular global longitudinal strain, 
ejection fraction, stroke volume, and cardiac output,  as well as diastolic indices of tissue relaxation 
(tissue Doppler E’ velocity) , filling pressure (E/e’ ratio) , and pulmonary artery systolic pressure .  
 
Lung Ultrasound  
Lung ultrasound will be performed in order to assess extravascular lung water, similar  to what h as 
previously  been  performed  during stress echocardiography protocol s.57, [ADDRESS_99338] and during exercise . We will pair arterial 
waveforms with LVOT Doppler profiles to assess ventricular -vascular coupling.  Additional pressure 
waveforms may be obtained at the carotid, femoral, and brachial arteries.  
 
Heart rate variability (HRV)  
HRV  is a non -invasive surrogate measure of autonomic tone  (the balance of the sympathetic and 
parasympathetic nervous systems), which is a critical determinant of outcomes in many 
cardiovascular conditions.59, [ADDRESS_99339] and 
after randomization arms , with a n ~5 minute  segment  exported for analysis (e.g. Kubios HRV 
software ). This analysis will only be performed in participants in sinus rhythm . We will measure 
standard indi ces in HRV analysis  (including time - and frequency -domain indices) . The principal  index 
will be standard deviat ion of the N -N (R-R) intervals.  We may also assess high frequency and low 
frequency power, as well as their ratio.  
 
Potential Pi[INVESTIGATOR_90121] 3 mmol/L in healthy 
volunteers at the dose studied here. Among HF patients, gut absorption might be reduced or delayed , 
leading to different peak effects of the compound. To address this potential problem, we have used a 
moderate dose of the  compound  to ensure we achieve therapeutic ketosis. Even if our goal levels of 
serum BHB are not achieved, recent data has demonstrat ed the benefits of ketone therapy accrue at 
even low levels (<1 mmol/L).61 
 
Risks and Safety Assessment  
KE risks: Rigorous previous analysis of the compound at doses (714 mg/kg) greater than  what  is 
administered here revealed a very favorable safety profile when administered as a single dose, with 
only 1 adverse event reported (transient mild rise in triglycerides that resolved by [CONTACT_90142]).9 
While ketoacidosis can induce pH disturbances or neurologic complications, this i s seen only at 
supraphysiologic levels (10 -20 mmol/L ); our study  is anticipated to  achieve levels  of around 3 mmol/L, 
similar to the levels observed  with fasting for a few days  (for example, levels of roughly 2 mmol/L are 
achieved after 48 hours of fasting) .41, [ADDRESS_99340] during the study . Given the short half -life of the compound, 
adverse events will be considered up to the time of the participant leaving the research unit.  
 
We will also review the medical charts of patients with an implantable cardioverter -defibrillator t o 
determine therapy zones prior to exercise . The primary safety outcome will be stress -induced 
sustained arrhythmias during exercise (atrial arrythmias, ventricular t achyca rdia).  Participants are free 
to termin ate study involve ment at any time, at which time they may be asked t he reason for study 
termination.

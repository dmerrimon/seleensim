Page [ADDRESS_175750] current stimulation improve ambulation and fatigue resistance in people with MS?
 
      Complete Sections 1 - 16. Specify N/A as appropriate. Do not leave any required sections blank.
1. Purpose of the study
a) Provide a brief lay summary of the project in <[ADDRESS_175751] we will be using non-invasive brain stimulation on people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) to
improve leg muscle function. Two groups of participants will be recruited. One group will perform strength
testing with and without the brain stimulation. After completing the strength testing they will walk for six
minutes to see if any increases in strength translate into improve mobility. The second group will perform a
fatigue task, pulling against a wire at a low level of force, with and without the brain stimulation. This type
of brain stimulation has been shown to transiently improve strength and fatigue measures in other
populations, e.g. aged, Parkinson’s, and improve cognitive abilities in people with multiple sclerosis. It is
our hope that the increases in performance seen in other patient groups will also occur in people with
multiple sclerosis. Future investigations will look to apply the non-invasive brain stimulation technique
during physical rehabilitation to improve short and long term outcomes related to physical function.
 
b) What does the Investigator(s) hope to learn from the study?
We expect to show that transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is an effective method for improving
neuromuscular function in PwMS. With this information we plan to investigate the concurrent use of tDCS
and physical rehabilitation and identify if tDCS can increase the gains seen with traditional PT and if these
improvements last longer compared to when only physical therapy is performed.
 
c) Proposed Start Date (may not precede IRB approval date):
Oct. 1, 2016

Study Procedures (If this is a student project, the methods section of the thesis or dissertation proposal
must be attached in section #16 - Attachment section.)
 
a) In lay language, describe all the procedures, from screening through end-of-study, that the human subject
must undergo in the research project, including study visits, drug treatments, randomization and the
procedures that are part of standard of care.  Please note: Do NOT respond "See Attachment Section." If
you would like to add tables, charts, etc., attach those files in the Attachment section (#16).
To investigate the effects of tDCS on strength and fatigue of the leg muscles in patients with multiple
sclerosis (MS) we will employ and randomized blinded cross-over design. Once accepted into the study
participants will be randomized into [ADDRESS_175752]. Groups 3 and 4 will perform a fatigue task. Each group will perform the same
procedures during 2 different visits with 1 visit having a tDCS sham procedure performed and 1 visit
performing the task with tDCS. The order of the sham / treatment will be based on the participant’s group
assignment. Each visit will be separated by [CONTACT_2669] 7 days. See attachment for proposal timeline.
Participant Recruitment:
Prospective participants will be recruited from the: Integrative Neurophysiology Laboratory’s (INPL)
participant database; the clinical practice of [CONTACT_152673], Banner Health, Greeley CO; and through
advertisements in the Colorado and Wyoming Chapter of the National MS Society newsletters. All
experimental procedures will be performed in the INPL (Director: Thorsten Rudroff, PhD, FACSM).
Interested individuals will perform an initial screening via an online questionnaire, hosted by [CONTACT_38385],
which has an agreement with the College of Health and Human Sciences. Contact [CONTACT_152628]’ information will be accessible only to the research staff according to HIPPA
regulations. After completion of the online screening form, INPL personal will contact 40 eligible
participants, 10 for each group, via phone to confirm their participation and schedule the participant’s first
visit. Once eligibility is confirmed participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 4 groups using a
random number generator. If by [CONTACT_3364] a group fills, 10 participants assigned, before the others that
number will then be removed to ensure each group has a similar size.
Experimental Sessions:
Page [ADDRESS_175753] the
investigators will explain the protocol and received signed informed consent from the participants.
Participants will also complete the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and the Beck’s Depression Inventory
(BDI) questionnaires. Body composition will be assessed via Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA)
utilizing standard guidelines set forth by [CONTACT_152629]. Following
consent, questionnaires, and DXA each participant will being procedures specific to their randomized
group. Group 1 = strength testing, tDCS → Sham; Group 2 = strength testing, Sham → tDCS; Group 3 =
fatigue testing, tDCS → Sham; Group 4 = fatigue testing, Sham → tDCS
Strength Group Session 1
After completion of the questionnaires participants will begin strength testing of the knee extensors/flexors,
planter/dorsi flexor muscle groups. The participants will perform these measurements while seated with the
hip, knee, and ankle at 90 degrees of flexion. All procedures, including those for the fatigue group, will be
performed with the participants in this positon. Between muscle group testing and tDCS application
participants will be allowed to get up and stretch as needed. A strap attached to a linear force transducer
(Noraxon, Scottsdale AZ, [LOCATION_003]) will be placed around the participant’s ankle or metatarsals. Once in the
proper position participants will be verbally encouraged to increase to maximal isometric force output over
3 seconds, continue maximal isometric force output for 1-2 more seconds , and then relax. After each
maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) the participants will recover for no less than 60 seconds. Each
muscle group will be tested 3-5 times, or until there is no further increase in force produced or if force
produced is lower than the previous trial. Both the right and left legs will be tested.
After the initial MVCs are performed participants will be asked to self-report their more- and less-affected
legs. Investigators will confirm the self-reported values with the results from the strength testing. Once the
more-affected leg has been determined surface electromyography (sEMG) electrodes will be placed on the
rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, and vastus medialis oblique, -longus. Prior to performing the experimental
paradigm, we will use Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) (Magstim Rapid magnetic stimulator (The
Magstim Company Ltd, Spring Gardens, Whitland, Carmarthenshire, [LOCATION_006])) and a focal figure of eight coil
(diameter of each wing 70 mm) to identify the right hemisphere M1 hotspot for the left leg extensors.  The
coil will be placed tangential to the scalp with the handle pointing 90° away from the midline (Groppa et al.,
2010).  The optimum site in the right M1 (hotspot) for eliciting motor responses in the left leg extensors will
be identified at supra-threshold intensity. Resting motor threshold (RMT) will be determined to the nearest
1% of the maximum stimulator output.  Using standard protocol, the RMT will be defined as the minimum
stimulus intensity that elicited MEPs of [ADDRESS_175754] 5 out of 10 consecutive trials (Triggs et al. 1994).
Once the leg motor cortex of the more-affected side (left or right) has been identified via TMS, a tDCS
device (Neuroelectrics Inc., Simi Valley, CA, [LOCATION_003]) will deliver a small direct current through two sponge
surface electrodes (3cm × 3cm, soaked with 15 mM NaCL)(Dundas et al. 2007). The anodal electrode will
be placed over the representation of the motor cortex for the more affected leg, and a second electrode will
be placed on the forehead above the contralateral orbit. The intensity of the tDCS will be 2 mA applied for
10 minutes, starting at 0 and increasing to 2 mA over a 30 second period of time. At the 9:30 time point the
current will gradually be reduced from 2 mA to 0 mA. Anodal tDCS with these parameters has been
reported to change the excitability of the leg motor cortex without inducing side effects (Jeffery et al. 2007).
The used parameters are in accordance with a safety criterion and far below the threshold for tissue
damage (Nitsche et al. 2003). The voltage during tDCS application will be less than [ADDRESS_175755] 30 s of tDCS (Nitsche et al. 2003; Paulus, 2003). The participants and the investigator performing
the MVC testing will be blinded to the tDCS condition. Participants will not be told their strength values until
the end of all testing sessions.
After completion of the tDCS/Sham strength assessment participants will perform a [ADDRESS_175756] participants will be
asked their rating of perceived exertion (RPE, 0-10 scale) (Dalgas et al. 2014)
Strength Group Session [ADDRESS_175757] to perform their final session. All procedures
for Session 2 will be the same as in Session 1, except that participants who received tDCS will now
receive sham stimulation and those that received the sham treatment will receive tDCS.
In all sessions both, participants and raters will be blinded to the intervention type. The experimenter who
Page 11 of 25
 will apply the intervention (real tDCS or Sham) will be different from the experimenter determining the
outcome measures.
Fatigue Group Session [ADDRESS_175758] been completed, MVCs of the right and left knee extensors
will be performed using the same methods stated before. After MVC performance participants will be
asked which is their more-affected leg and this answer will be compared to the results of the MVC testing.
Once the more-affected leg is determined the investigators will use the same TMS procedures as above to
identify the more-affected leg’s representation in the motor cortex. The anode tDCS electrode will then be
place in this spot, and stimulation will begin [ADDRESS_175759] prior to the initiation of the fatigue task the participant will perform 1 MVC, and 30% of this
force output will be the target output of the fatigue task. Visual feedback will be provided on a computer
monitor. Participants will perform the task until they can no longer generate the needed force (within 5% of
the target value for 5 seconds), or they say they want to stop. At every 1 minute interval the participant will
be asked to provide their rating of perceived exertion (RPE) based on the modified Borg [ADDRESS_175760] to perform their final session. All procedures
for Session 2 will be the same as in Session 1, except that participants who received tDCS will now
receive sham stimulation and those that received the sham treatment will receive tDCS.
In all sessions both, participants and raters will be blinded to the intervention type. The experimenter who
will apply the intervention (real tDCS or Sham) will be different from the experimenter determining the
outcome measures.
Electromyography (EMG)
During all strength and fatigue testing EMG signals will be recorded with bipolar surface electrodes that will
be placed over the vastus medialis oblique, vastus medialis longus, rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, and
biceps femoris. The electrodes will be attached according to landmarks between the innervation zone and
the end of the tendon (Rainoldi et al. 2004, 2007). The EMG signals will be amplified (x 2,000), band-pass
filtered (13–1,000 Hz; Noraxon) and recorded on a computer.
 
b) Explain why human subjects must be used for this project.
The goal of this project is to determine if tDCS can increase leg muscle strength and fatigue resistance in
people with MS. Therefore all clinical testing needs to be performed in the patient population that is being
studied.
 
c) Alternative Procedures. If the proposed study is a clinical trial of a drug, vaccine, device or treatment,
describe alternative procedures, if any, that might be advantageous to the subject. Describe the important
potential risks and benefits associated with the alternative procedure(s) or course(s) of treatment. Any
standard treatment that is being withheld must be disclosed. This information must be included in the
consent form.

9. Risks (Input N/A if not applicable)
     
US Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) Regulations define a subject at risk as follows: "...any
individual who may be exposed to the possibility of injury, including physical, psychological, or social injury,
as a consequence of participation as a subject in any research, development, or related activity which
departs from the application of those accepted methods necessary to meet his needs, or which increases
the ordinary risks of daily life, including the recognized risks inherent in a chosen occupation or field of
service."
 
 a)  PI's evaluation of the overall level of Risk. (Please check one: minimal or > minimal.)
Y Minimal (everyday living)
> Minimal (greater than everyday living)
 
 b)   
For the following categories include a scientific estimate of the frequency, severity, and reversibility of
potential risks. Wherever possible, include statistical incidence of complications and the mortality rate of
proposed procedures. Where there has been insufficient time to accumulate significant data ON risk, a
statement to this effect should be included. (In describing these risks in the consent form to the subject, it is
helpful to use comparisons which are meaningful to persons unfamiliar with medical terminology.) Address
any risks related to:
 
 
        1.    Use of investigational devices. Please include the clinical adverse events (AEs) associated with
each of the devices with an indication of frequency, severity and reversibility. This information
can often be found in the Investigator(s) brochure.

with an indication of frequency, severity and reversibility. This information can often be found in
the Investigator(s) brochure.
N/A
 
 
        3    Use of commercially available drugs, reagents or chemicals. Please include the clinical AEs

 N/A
 
 
c)      
For the following categories, include an estimate of the potential risk, if applicable.
 
 
        1.    Physical well-being.
Potential risks include: skin irritation to surface electromyography electrodes, muscle
cramps/spasms during strength testing.
tDCS safety
tDCS is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique in which a very weak electrical current is
applied to the scalp. tDCS has been conducted on humans and animals for many years and no
evidence has emerged to suggest that it is harmful or has ever induced a serious side effect.
However, the safety of tDCS is dependent on current strength, electrode size, and stimulation
duration. Accordingly, these parameters have been investigated to establish safe and effective
stimulation parameters for tDCS applications in research involving human subjects. The only
side effects that have been reported when proper guidelines are followed are temporary
tingling, itching, headache, or skin redness under the electrodes in some subjects. For
example, a [ADDRESS_175766] recently been reported in research
and review articles (Nitsche et al. 2008; Hummel et al. 2008).
Physiological studies have also assessed the safety of tDCS when applied within the
aforementioned stimulation guidelines. For example, there was no neuronal damage as
measured by [CONTACT_152635]-specific enolase (Stagg & Nitsche, 2011 ) or MRI measures of
edema using contrast enhanced and diffusion-weighted MRI measures following administration
of tDCS (Nitsche et al. 2004). Furthermore, tDCS did not negatively alter measures of
neuropsychological function and EEG activity (Iver et al. 2005). Accordingly, rat studies using
tDCS models emulating tDCS applied to humans (Liebetanz et al. 2009 ) showed that the
current density needed to induce tissue damage or lesions was about 1429 mA/cm2, whereas
the current densities used in human studies are between 0.04 and 0.08 mA/cm2 and in this
proposal are 0.029 mA/cm2. In conclusion, the tDCS stimulation parameters in this study are
identical to the most common in the literature and have been proven to be exceptionally safe
and well-tolerated.
The probablilty is very unlikely that harm may occur (see above). Based on the availiable
literature a slight headache should be the worst possible negative effect and should be very
rare. In this case, non-prescription medication should relieve the headache within 1-[ADDRESS_175767] monitoring of
each experimental session. Risks are minimized by [CONTACT_152636]-
described, within international guidelines, and within the range of those used in hundreds if not
thousands of studies (see above).
TMS safety
TMS is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that can be used for both diagnostic and
therapeutic procedures. The single and paired-pulse TMS techniques performed in this study
have been used extensively in thousands of research studies and on tens of thousands of
subjects in the [LOCATION_002] and around the world. Single and paired pulse TMS techniques
are considered very safe (Hallet, 2000, 2007) when accepted guidelines are followed
(Wassermann et al. 1998). Finally, no long-term risks have been reported in the
aforementioned review articles involving the use of TMS.  In general, the risks associated with
TMS are very minimal (Anand et al. 2002; Anderson et al. 2006; Loo et al. 2008).  There is a
very small risk of seizures if rTMS is done with very intense, high frequency stimulation or with
trains of stimulation separated by a second or less (Anand et al. 2002; Anderson et al. 2006;
Loo et al. 2008).  Such intensity, frequency and repetition rate will not be used in this study as
the study does NOT include rTMS and only single and paired pulse TMS methods will be
employed. For most people, the single and paired pulse stimulation is not painful, but
Page [ADDRESS_175768] hearing; therefore,
subjects will be fitted with earplugs during TMS testing. Finally, there is no medical risk
associated with the surface EMG recordings of the muscle responses to TMS.

WHY AM I BEING INVITED TO TAKE PART IN THIS RESEARCH?  
You are an adult aged between 30 and 60 years  of age, and you were diagnosed with 
Multiple Sclerosis.  
 WHO IS DOING THE STUDY?  
Dr. R udroff and his graduate students John Kindred, Nathan Ketelhut, and Felix Proessl  
are performing the study in the Integrative Neurophysiology Laboratory.  
 
WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY?  
The purpose of this study is to determine if a single session of tDCS can increase 
fatigue resistance of the more affected leg in people with MS. 
 
WHERE IS THE STUDY GOING TO TAKE PLACE AND HOW LONG WILL IT LAST?  
The study will take place in the Integrative Neurophysiology Laboratory  in the 
Department of Health and Exercise Science, on the Colorado State University  campus . 
The study will run for approximately 12 months. You will take part in the study for 
approximately  a total of 3 hours  over the space of  two week s. 
 
WHAT WILL I BE ASKED TO DO?   
You will be asked to participate i n two sessions on two different days  separated by [CONTACT_152642] [ADDRESS_175771] s of your leg muscles in 
association with 1 of 2 intervention protocols involving tDCS  application (BEFORE and 
SHAM ) with each intervention protocol being performed in a separate session on a 
different day.  Thus, in one session you will receive tDCS before the strength test, 
whereas in another session you will receive sham  tDCS before the strength test.  
 Upon arrival to the INPL the investigators will explain the protocol procedures and receive signed informed consent from you.

APPROVED: 9/15/2017 EXPI[INVESTIGATOR_152617]: 9/14/2018 - Questionnaires: You will fill out to questionnaires relating to fatigue and depression.  
- Body Compostion: We will perform a Dual -Energy X -Ray Absorptiometry (DXA) 
scan on you. A very small amount of X -Rays will pass through your body and 
allow us to measure the amount of muscle, fat,  and bone you have.  
- Leg Strength:  The maximal strength of each leg will be measured by [CONTACT_152643] a series of maximal effort knee extension trials.  This will be performed one leg at a time up to five times. The activity of your muscles will be measured 
during this task by [CONTACT_1299] a series of electrodes on the skin of your legs.  
- Fatigue Task:  The fatigue task will consist of  an isometric, no movement of the 
legs,  contraction of the knee extensors. You will be positioned with the hip, knee, 
and ankle of the more- affected leg at 90 degrees of flexion. The fatigue task will 
be performed at 30% of your best leg strength test . Visual feedback will be 
provided on a computer monitor. You will perform the task until you can no longer 
generate the needed force (within 5% of the target value for 5 seconds), or you say that you want to stop. At every [ADDRESS_175772] for no longer than 20 min.  
 To find the right location of electrode on your head we will use transcranial magnetic 
stimulation (TMS).  For application of TMS, a wire coil is held on the scalp. A brief electrical current is passed through the coil and creates a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. You will hear a click and may feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil and there may be a twitch in muscles of the face, arm or leg. During the stimulation, you will be at rest. You will wear a shower cap during the TMS testing and marks will be made on the cap to denote positioning of the coil.

APPROVED: 9/15/2017 EXPI[INVESTIGATOR_152617]: 9/14/2018  It is not possible to identify all potential risks in research procedures, but the researcher(s) have taken reasonable safeguards to minimize any known and potential, but unknown, risks. 
 
Risks of Having a Body composition (DXA) scan 
 The risks associated with the DEXA are very low.  The maximum radiation dose you will receive in this study is less than 1/1000
th of the federal and state occupational whole 
body dose limit allowed to radiation workers  (5,000 mrem)  (mrem is a unit used to 
measure radiation dosage).  Put another way, the maximum dose from any scan we utilize with this DEXA ranges from 1.2 mrem (Whole body scan) to 12.2 mrem (for several of the regional scans, such as lumbar, femur, and forearm scans).  The average annual background radiation you already receive is at least 620 mrem/year.  The more radiation you receive over the course of your life, the more the risk increases of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a fatal cancer or inducing changes in genes.  The radiation in this scan is 
not expected to significantly increase these risks, but the exact increase in such risks is not known.  There are no discomforts associated with this procedure.  
 
Risks of tDCS  
tDCS has been conducted on humans and animals for many years and no evidence has emerged to suggest that it is harmful or has ever induced a serious side effect. However, the safety of tDCS is dependent on current strength, electrode size, and stimulation duration. Accordingly, these parameters have been investigated, and safe and effective stimulation guidelines have been identified for research studies and in clinical practice for tDCS applications involving human subjects. In the several hundred 
studies conducted on humans using tDCS, the only side effects  that have been reported 
when proper guidelines are followed are temporary tingling, itching, mild headache, or 
skin redness under the electrodes in some subjects.   
 
In conclusion, the tDCS stimulation parameters in this study are identical to the most common in the literature and have been proven to be exceptionally safe and well -
tolerated.  Please let us know immediately if you develop any skin pain or 
discomfort during tDCS.  We will monitor you during stimulation and will stop the 
procedure if any problem develops. You may ask to stop the procedure at any time.   
Any effects of tDCS should wear off within 60- [ADDRESS_175773] people, the single pulse stimulation is not painful, but

APPROVED: 9/15/2017 EXPI[INVESTIGATOR_152617]: 9/14/[ADDRESS_175774] suffered permanent hearing damage when hearing protection fell out, although this was done using repetitive TMS (rTMS). This study does NOT include rTMS  or paired 
pulse TMS  and only single pulse TMS  will be employed in this study (see below).  
Animal and human studies have shown that earplugs or headphones can effectively 
prevent the risk of hearing disturbance due to TMS.  Therefore, you will be fitted with 
earplugs during TMS.  If you find the procedure too uncomfortable, you may 
discontinue it at any time.  
 
TMS can interfere with implanted medical devices and will not be done in people who have pacemakers, implanted pumps, or stimulators, such as cochlear implants or in people who have metal objects inside the eye or skull (dental work such as fillings and similar procedures do not pose a risk and are acceptable).  Please inform the investigators if you have any of these or known hearing loss. If metal is present or you 
have an implanted device or metal object that is not safe for TMS, you will not be allowed to participat e.  
 
In general, the risks associated with TMS are very minimal
 but research has shown that 
there is a very small risk of seizures if repetitive TMS (rTMS) is done with very intense, high frequency stimulation or with trains of stimulation separated by a second or less.  
Such intensity, frequency and repetition rate will not be used in this study as the 
study does NOT include rTMS and only single pulse TMS method will be 
employed.  Finally, there is no medical risk associated with the surface EMG recordings 
of the muscle responses to TMS.  
 
Risks of Performing Motor Task s 
 
Generally, the procedures outlined for measuring force and muscle activity during the motor tasks are safe.  Nevertheless, there is potential for injury  (muscle strain), resulting 
from the maximal contractions.   There is a 0.01% chance of death (in people who have 
heart problems), a 0.02% risk of cardiac arrhythmias that would require you to go the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (in people with heart problems), and a risk of an increase or decrease in blood pressure.  
 All contraction s are voluntary and you can stop immediately if they experience any slight 
pain or discomfort.  Following participation, you may experience some muscle soreness.  
Muscle soreness tends to be more common for individuals who have not exercised recently.  Oth er risk factors may include increased feelings of anxiety and/or stress 
induced by [CONTACT_152644], which can lead to an increase in heart rate and blood pressure.   The EMG  electrodes that will be used to measure muscle activity could

done using repetitive TMS (rTMS). This study does NOT include rTMS  or paired 
pulse TMS  and only single pulse TMS  will be employed in this study (see below).  
Animal and human studies have shown that earplugs or headphones can effectively prevent the risk of hearing disturbance due to TMS.  Therefore, you will be fitted with 
earplugs during TMS.  If you find the procedure too uncomfortable, you may 
discontinue it at any time.  
 
TMS can interfere with implanted medical devices and will not be done in people who have pacemakers, implanted pumps, or stimulators, such as cochlear implants or in people who have metal objects inside the eye or skull (dental work such as fillings and similar procedures do not pose a risk and are acceptable).  Please inform t he 
investigators if you have any of these or known hearing loss. If metal is present or you 
have an implanted device or metal object that is not safe for TMS, you will not be allowed to participate.  
 
In general, the risks associated with TMS are very mini mal
 but research has shown that 
there is a very small risk of seizures if repetitive TMS (rTMS) is done with very intense, high frequency stimulation or with trains of stimulation separated by a second or less.  
Such intensity, frequency and repetition rate will not be used in this study as the 
study does NOT include rTMS and only single pulse TMS method will be 
employed.  Finally, there is no medical risk associated with the surface EMG recordings 
of the muscle responses to TMS.  
 
Risks of Performing Motor Tasks  
Generally, the procedures outlined for measuring force and muscle activity during the motor tasks are safe.  Nevertheless, there is potential for injury  (muscle strain), resulting 
from the maximal contractions.   There is a 0.01% chance of death (in people who have 
heart problems), a 0.02% risk of cardiac arrhythmias that would require you to go the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (in people with heart problems), and a risk of an increase or decrease in blood pressure.  
 All contraction s are voluntary and you can stop immediately if they experience any slight 
pain or discomfort.  Following participation, you may experience some muscle soreness.  
Muscle soreness tends to be more common for individuals who have not exercised recently.  Oth er risk factors may include increased feelings of anxiety and/or stress 
induced by [CONTACT_152644], which can lead to an increase in heart rate and blood pressure.   The EMG electrodes that will be used to measure muscle activity could 
potentially cause skin irritation after removal.  Furthermore, your skin will need to be 
shaved prior to placing the electrodes, which can also cause irritation.

Statistical analysis :  
Separated by a minimum of 7 days, participants performed experimental protocol twice once with tDCS 
and once with Sham in a counterbalanced order.  A repeated measures ANOVA (condition x time) and 
paired t -tests were used to compare Sham vs. tDCS. Data are reported as means (tDCS vs Sham) plus or 
minus the standard deviations.

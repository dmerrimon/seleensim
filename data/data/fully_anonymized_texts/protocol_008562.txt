Group, Safety and Tolerance Study of Buprenorphine Sublingual Spray (0.5 mg TID) versus 
Standard of Care Post -Operative Narcotic Therap y for the Treatment of Post -Operative Pain  
Study center(s):  2 
Studied period (years):  
Estimated date first patient enrolled: Q3 [ADDRESS_1067175] patient completed: Q4 2017  Phase of development:  
Phase 2  
Objectives:  
Primary:  
To evaluate the safety and tolerability based on the incidence of adverse experi ences of 
Buprenorphine Sublingual Spray  (0.5 mg three times daily  [TID]) compared with standard 
post-operative narcotic therapy in subjects with postoperative pain . Standard post -operative 
narcotic therapy is defined as Morphine Intravenous Injection  (IV) ( 4 mg TID ) followed by 
[CONTACT_777092]  (10 mg TID ). 
Methodology:  
This is a Phase 2, randomized (stratified according to surgery and postoperative nausea and 
vomiting risk factors), open label, multiple -dose, comparator controlled, parallel -group, study 
to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Buprenorphine Sublingual Spray (0.5 mg TID) 
versus standard  postoperative narcotic thera py in subjects with postoperative pain. Standard 
postoperative narcotic therapy is defined as Morphine IV (4 mg TID ) for 24 hours  followed 
by [CONTACT_777093]  (10 mg TID ). 
The stu dy will comprise four periods:  Screening Period (Days -28 to -1), Surgical Period 
(Day 1), Treatment Period (Days 1  to 4 Inpatient / Days 4 to 7 Outpatient ), and Follow -up 
Period (Day 8 , +2 day window ). 
Subjects will be admitted to the study site on the morning of the scheduled surgery (Day 1), 
will remain at the study site until Postoperative Day 4 (a total of 3 nights at the study site)  
then be  evaluated t o participate in the outpatient  setting and meet  criteria in order to proceed 
to the outpatient treatment period  Days 4 to 7, and will return  to the clinic  for the Follow -up 
Visit on Day 8  (+2 day window) . 
Screening Period:  Subjects who meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria will be eligible 
for enrollment. After providing written Informed Consent, subjects will undergo study 
specific screening procedures, including a review of inclusion and exclusion, demographics, 
medi cal history, concomitant medication use, assessment of postoperative nausea and

    vomiting (PONV) risk factors, physical  and oral  cavity examination, baseline laboratory 
testing, alcohol breath test, urine drug screening, HIV and hepatitis screening, 12 -lead 
electrocardiogram (ECG), and pregnancy testing. Eligible subjects will complete all 
screening procedures within 28 days before the surgery (Days -28 to -1). 
Surgical  Period:  On Day 1, anesthesia will be established using standardized techniques, as 
appropriate, for each surgical procedure. The surgical procedures will be bunionectomy, 
breast augmentation, and abdominoplasty. For nausea prophylaxis, all subjects will receive a 
uniform stan dard of care regimen which includes the following: [ADDRESS_1067176]-surgical  analgesia (dose and frequency per the discretion of the 
investigator).  
Treatment Period :  Within [ADDRESS_1067177]-surgical 
eligibility requirements will be randomized to treatment  (see Post-surgical  Eligibility 
Requirements ). 
After meeting post-surgical  eligibility requirements and subsequently being randomized to 
treatment, subjects may receive their first dose of investigational drug any time between [ADDRESS_1067178] -surgical eligibility requirements . 
During the Treatment Period, approximately 100 subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 
treatment groups: Buprenorphine Sublingual Spray 0.[ADDRESS_1067179] of care 
postoperative narcotic therapy. Randomization w ill be stratified according to surgical 
procedure and  baseline  PONV risk factors.  Vitals, pulse oximetry, and ECG measurements 
will be taken. Concomitant medications and Adverse Events  will be recorded.  
Pulse oximetry will be monitored continuously after surgery as a safety measure. An 
electrocardiogram (ECG) will be conducted after surgery but before the first dose of the 
study drug and serve as a baseline for comparison to subsequent tracings. The time of 
administration of the first dose of study drug wi ll be defined as Time 0. During confinement, 
study drug will be administered by [CONTACT_777094]. Subjects should not have anything orally except room -temperature water within 
15 minutes of each dose. The inpatien t Treatment Period will continue through 72 hours after 
Time 0. Additional ECGs will be performed at 90 minutes, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48  hours and 
72 hours after Time 0.  
Rescue for inadequate analgesic response:   
During confinement to the study center durin g the first 72 hours (Days 1 -4), subjects 
requiring rescue medication for pain will be provided with acetaminophen 1000 mg every six 
hours and/or ketorolac 30 mg every six hours , as needed. On outpatient days 4 -7, ketorolac 
will not be available to study s ubjects (because it is intravenous).  Therefore, subjects will be

    provided with acetaminophen, and will be advised to take acetaminophen 1000 mg every six 
hours as needed for rescue analgesia.   
Rescue for postoperative nausea:  During confinement to the st udy center during the first 72 
hours (Day 1 -4), subjects requiring rescue medication for nausea will be provided with 
Zofran 4 mg IV per the discretion of the clinician. On outpatient days 4 -7 subjects will be 
provided  Zofran ODT (oral dissolvable tablet) to be taken as needed  for postoperative 
nausea .  
Subjects whose pain or nausea cannot be adequately managed (in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]) 
by a combination of study drug and rescue medication or who develop unacceptab le side 
effects during the study will be discontinued from further study participation. Their pain or 
nausea will be managed according to usual standard of care at the investigator’s discretion.  
Site staff will train subjects on how to self -administer stud y drug. Investigators will 
determine if patients are able to proceed with the outpatient treatment period. Before 
discharge from the study site on Day 4, site personnel will dispense rescue medication and 
will train subjects on how to administer the study drug, educate patients on the signs and 
symptoms of Adverse Events , and observe subjects self -administer medication. After  
discharge, study drug will be administered by [CONTACT_777095] . Study personnel will dispense outpatient diary , study drug, rescue 
pain and nausea medication . Subjects will also be instructed to return the outpatient diary to 
study personnel at the Follow up Visit 8 + 2 days after surgery.                  
Follow -up V isit on Day 8  (+2 day window) : Subjects will be instructed to return any 
unused outpatient study drug to  study personnel. Vitals, pulse oximetry, and ECG will be 
measured. Concomitant medications and Adverse Events  will be recorded.  
Subject outpatient diary will be collected and reviewed by [CONTACT_464].  
Number of patients (planned):  Approximately 100 subjects ([ADDRESS_1067180] -operative pain

in. Furthermore, 75% of those patients report the pain as moderate, severe or extreme ( 1). 
The
se patients require effective postoperative pain control in order to provide comfort, earlier 
mobilization, faster recovery, and decreased likelihood of post-operative complications. 
Traditionally, acute post-operative pain management has relied on opi[INVESTIGATOR_777059]. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_777060]. They can be 
administered via oral, transdermal, parenteral, neuraxial, and rectal routes. Morphine is the 
standa
rd choice for opi[INVESTIGATOR_777061]-operative pain. However, morphine 
ha
s significant amount of first-pass metabolism in the liver with only around 40 to 50% of the 
amount absorbed actually reaching the nervous system ( 2). Most of the morphine is processed in 
the kidne
ys and eliminated from the body in urine.  Oxycodone, another opi[INVESTIGATOR_2641], is  being 
wide
ly used to alleviate moderate- to-severe pain but even then its bioavailability is 67–80% ( 3). 
I
t would be beneficial to manage patients’ post-operative pain effectively with opi[INVESTIGATOR_777062] a 
route
 that by-passes liver metabolism and is feasible in the ambulatory setting. An option would 
be the sublingual route which allows drug to diffuse to the blood through the tissues under the 
tongue and avoiding the first pass effect by [CONTACT_4852].  
B
uprenorphine is currently approved by [CONTACT_777098] a transdermal patch or a 
buccal film to treat chronic pain. Buprenorphine binds to mu-receptors with high affinity but less 
int
rinsic activity compared to full opi[INVESTIGATOR_74453]. Because of its partial agonist features, the 
efficacy and adverse effects of buprenorphine are thought to plateau at higher doses. Past 
research suggests that buprenorphine may show a respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341] “ceiling effect” where 
analgesic efficacy continues to escalate at higher doses, but respi[INVESTIGATOR_777063]. 
Dahan et al. (4) found that when tested over a dose range, buprenorphine demonstrated a ceiling 
e
ffect for respi[INVESTIGATOR_777064]. In a separate study, Dahan et al. (5) found 
that the ceiling effect shown for buprenorphine-induced respi[INVESTIGATOR_777065] μ-agonist opi[INVESTIGATOR_777066].  In addition, buprenorphine dissociates from 
the mu-receptor very slowly, which likely accounts for its longer duration of action than 
morphine, and its low level of manifested physical dependence. Actions at kappa-receptors, 
where buprenorphine is an antagonist, are believed to produce alterations in the perception of 
pain and the emotional response to pain. 
It is postulated that using buprenorphine for acute pain relief through the sublingual spray route 
may have multiple benefits over full opi[INVESTIGATOR_777067], milder withdrawal and 
less abuse potential, better efficacy in older population, and treatment in a broad range of pain 
types. In addition, its use through sublingual is advantageous over oral administration such that 
the effect is more direct and faster ( 6). 
The
 proposed study will evaluate the safety with the administration of buprenorphine delivered 
as a sublingual spray for post-operative pain.

1.2. Clinical Experience 
The drug being investigated in this study is the sublingual preparation spray of buprenorphine. 
B
uprenorphine has been shown to be safe and effective in its currently marketed oral forms: 
tablet (Subutex®) and buccal film (Belbuca™) (www.accesseddata.fda.gov). Subutex® 
sublingual tablets have been studied in 1834 patients and Belbuca™ has been evaluated in three 
12-week double- blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- na ��� n d opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-experienced 
patients with moderate- to-severe chronic low back pain. Two of the 3 studies showed efficacy in 
lower back pain. 
Buprenorphine Sublingual Spray has been studied in a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-
blind, multiple-dose, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study (Study INS005-15-062) to 
e
valuate the safety and efficacy of 3 dosing regimens (0.5 mg, 0.25 mg, or 0.125 mg 3 times 
da
ily [TID]) in subjects with moderate to severe pain after bunionectomy). In summary, the 
stud
y demonstrated that the Buprenorphine Sublingual Spray given TID at doses of 0.[ADDRESS_1067195] 
re
duction in pain as assessed by [CONTACT_777099]-48 and was statistically significant to placebo (p<0.0001).  
The 0.25 mg tid and 0.125 mg tid doses also demonstrated statistically significant reductions in 
SPID-48 (p = 0.0108 and p = 0.0120, respectively).  Because all treatments were generally well 
tol
erated, the 0.[ADDRESS_1067196] or irregular heartbeat, mental or mood changes, 
pale stools, pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site, slow or shallow breathing, unusual 
weakness, vision changes, yellowing of eyes or skin. Safety monitoring will occur during the in-
clinic period of the study. All subjects will be actively monitored with pulse-oximetry (SpO2) 
and ECG after surgery. 
A summary of the pharmaceutical properties and known potential risks of Buprenorphine 
Sublingual Spray is provided in the current version of the investigator’s brochure. The

6.2.9. Adver se Events and Serious Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Definition of Adverse Events 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product during the course of a clinical investigation. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an 
investigational product, whether or not thought to be related to the investigational product.  
Subjects will be monitored throughout the study for AEs. Monitoring for treatment-emergent 
AEs will begin as soon as the subject is dosed. All AEs must be followed until they are resolved 
or stabilized, or until all attempts to determine resolution of the event are exhausted. The 
investigator should use their discretion in ordering additional tests as necessary to monitor the 
progr
ess of such events. 
Adverse Events reported prior to dose administration will be recorded as part of the subject’s 
medical history. 
An AE may be: 
 A ne w illness, not documented in the subject’s medical history; 
 W orsening of a concomitant illness; 
 An e ffect of the study medication; it could be an abnormal laboratory value, as well 
as a significant shift from baseline within normal range which the qualified 
investigator or medical qualified designate considers to be clinically important; 
 A combination of two or more of these factors. 
Surgical procedures themselves are not AEs. They are therapeutic measures for conditions that 
required surgery. The condition for which the surgery is required is an AE, if it occurs or is 
detected during the study period. Planned surgical measures permitted by [CONTACT_154575](s) leading to these measures are not AEs, if the condition(s) was 
(were) known before the start of study treatment. In the latter case, the condition should be 
reported as medical history. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Classification of Adverse Events 
Adverse Events are to be recorded on the AE page of the subject’s case report form (CRF).  
Severity will be graded according to the following definitions: 
 Mild:  The subject experiences awareness of symptoms but these are easily tolerated 
or managed without specific treatment. 
Insys Development Company, Inc.                         Protocol Number INS005-17-111  
 
Version 1.0 02Aug2017                            CONFIDENTIAL                                                        30  
     Moderate:  The subject experiences discomfort enough to cause interference with 
usual activity, and/or the condition requires specific treatment. 
 Severe:  The subject is incapacitated with inability to work or do usual activity, 
and/or the event requires significant treatment measures. 
Action taken will be categorized as none, study drug discontinued, dose modified, required 
concomitant medication, required procedure, or other. 
Event outcome at resolution or time of last follow-up will recorded as event resolved, resolved 
with s
equelae, ongoing, or death. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Causality/Drug Relationship Assessment 
The relationship of the event to the study drug should be determined by [CONTACT_777106]:  
 Definitely related: The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
drug administration that cannot be explained, follows a known or expected response 
pattern to the study drug, that is confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_777079]’s clinical condition, intercurrent illness, 
or concomitant drug.  
 Probably related:  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
drug administration, and/or follows a known response pattern to the study drug, and 
cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_1605]’s clinical 
condition, intercurrent illness, or concomitant drugs. 
 Possibly related:  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
drug administration, and/or follows a known response pattern to the study drug, but 
could have been produced by [CONTACT_1605]’s clinical condition, 
intercurrent illness, or concomitant drugs. 
 Unlikely related: The event follows little or no temporal sequence from the time of 
drug administration that makes a causal relationship improbable and/or other factors 
such as the subject’s clinical condition, intercurrent illness, or concomitant drugs is a 
more likely alternative. 
 Not related:  The event is most likely produced by [CONTACT_1605]’s 
clinical condition, intercurrent illness, or concomitant drugs, and does not follow a 
known response pattern to the study drug, or the temporal relationship of the event to 
study drug administration makes a causal relationship unlikely. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Definition of Serious Adverse Events 
A serious AE (SAE) is any AE that fulfills any of the following criteria, as per 21 CFR 312.32: 
 Results in death; 
 I s life-threatening; 
 Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];

     R esults in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; 
 I s a congenital anomaly or birth defect; 
 I s medically significant or requires intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
above. 
Ser
ious AEs will be captured from the time of consent through the end of the study. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Actions Taken for Serious Adverse Events 
Ac
tions taken may consist of: 
 None: No action taken 
 Tr eatment: Standard of care measures instituted 
 Dr ug withdrawn: Study medication was permanently discontinued because of the AE 
 Unknow n: Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Outcome at the Time of Last Observation for Serious Adverse Events 
The
 outcome at the time of last observation will be classified as: 
 R ecovered/resolved 
 R ecovered/resolved with sequelae 
 Not r ecovered/not resolved 
 De ath 
 Unknown  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event Recording and Reporting 
Adverse Events will be recorded throughout the study in the source documents and in the CRFs. 
The investigator will rate AEs for seriousness, intensity, causality, action taken, and outcome as 
described in the previous section. 
Ex
pedited reporting is required for serious unexpected adverse drug reactions. Fatal or 
life-threatening unexpected drug reactions must be reported by [CONTACT_777107] 7 days after the Sponsor’s first knowledge of the reaction; followed by [CONTACT_58691] a report as possible within [ADDRESS_1067218] be 
reported no later than 15 days after the Sponsor’s first knowledge of the reaction. In order to 
comply with these requirements, the investigator or delegate must inform the Sponsor 
immediately upon occurrence of any SAE. The site will complete the SAE Report Form as 
thoroughly as possible and email/fax it to Insys Development Company within [ADDRESS_1067219] information is listed below: 
 
 
Insys Development Company Development Company, Inc.  
Email:  
Telephone:   
 
These SAE reports must contain the following information: 
A. Study name/number 
B. Study drug 
C. Investigator details (name, phone, fax, e-mail) 
D. Subject number 
E. Subject initials 
F. Subject demographics 
G. Clinical event

[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event Follow- Up 
All non-serious AEs that are not related or unlikely to be related to study treatment will be 
followed until the end of study participation. All SAEs or AEs that are considered as possibly, 
probably, or definitely related to treatment will be followed until resolution or stabilization.

    [IP_ADDRESS]. Special Considerations 
Pregnancy 
All women of childbearing potential who participate in the study should be counseled on the 
need to practice adequate birth control and on the importance of avoiding pregnancy during 
study participation. Women should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_777108]. 
Pregnancy testing will be conducted before IP administration on every woman of childbearing 
potential. A woman who is found to be pregnant at the Screening Visit will be excluded from the 
study and considered to be a screening failure. 
If a subject becomes pregnant, the investigator must report the pregnancy within [ADDRESS_1067220] the designated individual(s) who 
receive SAE notification and record information related to the pregnancy on the designated form. 
The investigator is responsible for following the pregnancy until delivery or termination. These 
findings must be reported on the designated form and forwarded to the designated individual(s). 
The event meets the SAE criterion only if it results in a spontaneous abortion or a congenital 
anomaly. 
Subjects who become pregnant during the course of the study will be followed to collect data on 
lactating women and health of the child (for births) or until termination of the pregnancy.

minimize interpatient variability to the greatest extent possible. However, it is understood that 
hemodynamic fluctuations and other intraoperative events may necessitate some deviation from 
this standard regimen and that is acceptable. 
Bunionectomy  
Subjects will undergo primary unilateral first metatarsal b unionectomy with no other collateral 
procedures. The use of midazolam, fentanyl, nitrous oxide and propofol are allowed with doses 
a
t discretion of anesthesia.  A small dose of lidocaine (up to 5 mL of 1% lidocaine without 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) may be administered prior to medications to reduce peripheral vein irritation. A 
standa
rd Mayo block will be established using 2% lidocaine (plain), not to exceed [ADDRESS_1067235] of care regimen which includes 
the following: [ADDRESS_1067236] management is at the discretion of anesthesia (typi[INVESTIGATOR_777088]). The 
bunionec
tomy procedure time should not exceed [ADDRESS_1067237]-surgical analgesia (dose and frequency per the discretion of 
the investigator). 
Breast Augmentation  
Subjects will undergo a bilateral submuscular augmentation mammoplasty via an inframammary 
approach under general anesthesia utilizing saline implants not to exceed 500cc each. Ancillary 
proc
edures (liposuction, breast reduction, breast lift, abdominoplasty etc.) are prohibited. 
Midaz
olam, Fentanyl, Sevoflurane, nitrous oxide and propofol are allowed with doses at 
discretion of anesthesia. A small dose of lidocaine (up to 5 mL of 1% lidocaine without 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) may be administered prior to medications to reduce peripheral vein irritation. For 
na
usea prophylaxis, all subjects will receive a uniform standard of care regimen which includes 
the following: [ADDRESS_1067238]-surgical analgesia (dose and 
fr
equency per the discretion of the investigator). 
Mini-Abdominoplasty 
Subjects will undergo a mini-abdominoplasty procedure (defined as a cosmetic surgery involving 
skin, muscle and adipose tissue, but no relocation of the umbilicus ). The approach should be 
a
nterior. Surgical drains should be placed per the discretion of the surgeon. The incision should 
in general be from one ASIS (anterior superior iliac spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) to the other. It is understood that the 
exact incision length will vary depending on the subject’s anatomy and the desired cosmetic 
outcome. Ancillary procedures (liposuction, breast reduction etc.) are prohibited. Midazolam,

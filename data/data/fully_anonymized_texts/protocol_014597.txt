mortality rates of over 5%  have been seen in other countries. Although many patients 
may have only mild upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856], s ome  COVID -19 patients become 
severely ill with respi[INVESTIGATOR_226755] a systemic coagulopathy with features similar to disseminated 
intravascular coagulation (DIC) .1 The pathophysiology of COVID -19-associated 
coagulopathy appears to be  complex and multifactorial, involving both cellular and 
plasmatic elements of the hemostatic system. Development of coagulopathy has been 
sugges ted to be a predictor of mortality in patients with COVID -19.2 The primary 
treatment of DIC is focused on treating the underlying pathology; which for COVID -19 is 
currently limited  to supportive therapy and experimental therapeutics . Treatment with 
low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in prophylactic doses was  associated with better 
outcomes in severe cases of COVID -19 meeting ISTH criteria for DIC in a retrospective 
analys is.1,2 The International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) has published 
an interim  guidance document recommending thromboprophylaxis with LMWH for all 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41374] -19.[ADDRESS_272550] regarding the relative safety  or efficacy of intermediate -
dose versus low -dose prophylactic LMWH.  
 
This prospective, randomized,  open -label, single -center interventional study is designed 
to compare the safety and efficacy of two LMWH dosing protocols in patients admitted 
to the Unive rsity of Iowa Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_226756] -19 who meet the modified ISTH Overt 
DIC criteria score ≥ 3. Patients will be randomized to low -dose LMWH  (standard of care  
arm) or intermediate -dose LMWH  (intervention arm) .

 3. Study design  
3.1. Design  
This is a single center, randomized, open -label study comparing low -dose enoxaparin 
(40 mg SC daily or 30 mg  SC twice daily  if BMI ≥40 ; standard of care arm) versus 
intermediate -dose enoxaparin (1 mg/kg SC daily  or 0.5 mg/kg SC twice daily if BMI ≥40; 
intervention  arm) in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_226757] -confirmed SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_272552] of care for patients admitted to the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_226758] -19.3 Patients with a BMI ≥  [ADDRESS_272553] meet all the inclusion criteria to participate in this study .

5. Study procedures and e valuations  
5.1 Screening and enrollment  
Potentially eligible patients will be identified by a healthcare professional per 
institutional policy on privac y. The healthcare  professional will assess the eligibility of 
the patient by [CONTACT_746] a chart review which will include  laboratory  results  and 
weight as measured  on admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] . After obtaining verbal consent from 
the patient to be contact[CONTACT_110131], a  member of the research staff will approach 
the patient  to be part of the study. The research staff will obtain  informed consent from 
the patient /LAR  before  collecting any data and performing any procedures.  
5.[ADDRESS_272554] of care, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_226760] -19 will be monitored 
for coagulopathy. Daily blood tests for platelet count, prothrombin time, D- Dimer , and 
fibrinogen and weekly thromboelastography will be obtained, and a daily Modified ISTH 
Overt DIC score will be calculated (Exhibit 1). Only patients meeting all inclusion and 
exclusion criteria will be asked to participate in the trial. Patients will be randomized to 
one of two arms : 
1) Patients randomized to the standard of care arm will receive low -dose enoxaparin 
(40 mg subcutaneously  daily if BMI <40 and 30 mg subcutaneously  twice daily  if BMI 
≥ 40).  
2) Patients randomized to the intervention arm will receive intermediate -dose 
enoxaparin (1 mg/kg Subcutaneously  daily  or 0.5 mg/kg Subcutaneously  twice daily 
if BMI ≥ 40).  
5.3 Dose Modifications  
1) Enoxaparin  will be held if platelets decrease to <25,000/mm3. Enoxaparin will 
resume once platelets increase  to ≥25,000/  mm3. 
2) Enoxaparin will be held if fibrinogen is <50 mg/dL. Enoxaparin will resume once 
fibrinogen increases to ≥50 mg/dL.  
3) Enoxaparin will be help if glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 30 ml/min calculated by 
[CONTACT_226767] ≥30 ml/min. 
 
All participating patients will continue the assigned doses of enoxaparin until hospi[INVESTIGATOR_226761] a clinical event occurs requiring either discontinuation of 
anticoagulation  therapy  or full therapeutic dose anticoagulation therapy . 
6. Randomization  
Randomization to treatment arm will be allocated through a centralized randomization sys tem 
in a 1:[ADDRESS_272555] of care versus intervention arms (low- dose versus intermediate-
dose enoxaparin, respectively) . The randomization process will be initiated by [CONTACT_226768]- base d system and enter the patient’s unique identifier, 
confirmation of eligibility and  informed consent .

8. Withdrawal or Termination 
Any participant who wishes to withdraw from the study may do so at any time. If a participant 
chooses to withdraw from the study, no new data about that participant will be collected for 
study purposes. A participant may also withdraw authorization for the researchers to use his or 
her data that has already been collected (other than data needed to keep track of the withdrawal, including demographic data), but the participant must do this in writing to the site 
principal investigator.  
The study may be terminated at any time by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_226765] e protocol will not yield statistically or scientifically useful data.  
 
9. Study Management  
It is expected that the IRB will have the proper representation and function in accordance with 
federally mandated regulations. The IRB should approve the consent form  and protocol.  In 
obtaining and documenting informed consent, the investigator should comply with the applicable regulatory requirement(s)  and should adhere to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and to 
ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  Before recruitment and 
enrollment onto this study, the patient will be given a full explanation of the study and will be 
pg. [ADDRESS_272557] include all the 
relevant elements cur rently required by [CONTACT_44316]. Once 
this essential information has been provided to the patient and the investigator is assured that the patient understands the implications of participating in the study, the patient  will be asked 
to give consent to participate in the study by [CONTACT_10001] -approved consent form.  Prior to a 
patient’s participation in the trial, the written informed consent form should be signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_12718]’s leg ally acceptable representative, and by [CONTACT_28506].  
  
10. Statistical analysis and considerations  
The null hypothesis is that intermediate- dose LMWH (intervention arm) will have a mortality rate 
that is not less tha n low -dose LMWH (standard of care arm). A sample size of [ADDRESS_272558] 80% power when testing a difference of 20% (40% vs 20% for 
the two arms). Mean with SD and frequencies for all variables will be reported for e ach arm. A chi -
square test will be conducted to test the mortality difference between the two arms.

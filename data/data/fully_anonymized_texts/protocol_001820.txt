 Introduction and background  
The Baha SoundArc  coupling system has been developed as a non -surgical coupling of a 
Baha sound processor to the skull allowing the transfer of vibrational energy to the cochlear 
partition via bone conduction pathways. Today we offer two alternatives to this non- surgical 
approach; the Baha headband/test band and the Baha S oftband. Each of these current options 
have benefits and liabilities.  In the liability column, there is comfort and cosmetic concerns to consider. In the benefits column, there is need to provide a vehicl e to test a potential candidate 
with a bone conduction system prior to making final decisions regarding implantation of the Baha system. There is also a population ( under 5 years) where a need exists for Bone 
conduction amplification. Current approved clearance is f or children [ADDRESS_54807] of osseointergration. There is also in a more 
limited group, a need for a non- surgical option for use of the Baha Bone conduction sound 
processor in candidates t hat cannot or will not accept a surgical implant.  
Currently , persons in need of this non- surgical coupling of a Baha sound processor had only to 
choose between the Headband/Test Band that is a spring steel appliance that holds the vibrating Baha sound proc essor in contact [CONTACT_51891]. Use of this appliance is acceptable in short -term wearing conditions but in practice is 
not always c omfortable for long -term wear. In addition to wearing comfort , there are often 
cosmet ic objections to wear ing this appliance long -term. A more comfortable option is the 
Baha Softband,  which is a latex -free elastic strap that contains a size adjustment buckle, a 
safety break -away connector and a force contact [CONTACT_51892] B aha sound proc essor 
attaches. The original design intention of the Baha Softband was in the pediatric population.  
Older children and adults can also use this method of c oupling. However, the S oftband has a 
negative cosmetic appeal in this older child to adult patient pool.  
Due to the cosmetic and comfort issues , the team at Cochlear Bone Anchored Solutions 
(CBAS)  has produced the Baha SoundArc  seen below.

 Access to Study Documents and Data  Monitoring 
Investigator(s) will provide access to study documentation including source data for the 
purposes of monitoring, audits, IRB review, and regulatory inspections.  
The Sponsor will designate appropriately trained monitors to review the progress of this study 
and assure the quality and integrity of data accumulated. Clinical monitors, as representatives of the Sponsor, have the obligation to provide site qualification and initiation visits as well as regular site visits. The study monitors will be employees of the Sponsor, Cochlear Americas, or any contracted vendors qualified by [CONTACT_51893]. Study monitors, employed by [CONTACT_51894], for this study will be:

 Data Storage and Confidentiality  
 Confidentiality  
A Case R eport Form (CRF) will be completed for each study subject, summarizing all clinical 
and study data. The CRF contains confidential material. Subjects will only be referred to in the 
CRF by [CONTACT_51895]. Specific instructions to complete the CRF shall be provided to the clinical investigation team as appropriate.  
Copi[INVESTIGATOR_51887]. The original CRFs are to be retained by [CONTACT_13177] a period of time as determined by [CONTACT_427].  
 Subject Identification  
To maintain confidentiality, the subject’s name [CONTACT_51899]. All individuals who prov ide informed consent (sign the 
informed consent form) are considered consented into the study and will be assigned a unique identifier. A unique alphanumeric code will identify the subject throughout the course of the study. For example, US01- ARC- 0000, where:  
• US = [LOCATION_002]  
• 01 = a sequential numeral corresponding the order in which a subject is enrolled into the 
study for a given study site, in this case this would correspond to the first subject 
recruited into the study for a particular site,  
• ARC = an abbreviation for the study, in this case “ARC ” for the  Baha SoundArc , 
• 0000 = a unique, numeric study site identification.  
 Release of Medical Information  
Subjects will be required to release the exchange of medical information between the Investigator(s) and the Sponsor. This requirement will be clearly identified in the Informed Consent form.  
 Risk Benefit Statement  
It is possible but  not guaranteed that a dvances in Baha  technology will improve performance 
via use of the Baha SoundArc . This clinical investigation will help to inform the future 
development of associated clinical guidance when fitting Baha  patients.  
 Risk Category  
As determined by [CONTACT_1034] , this study has been designated as non- significant risk. The 
Baha Softband/ SoundArc , and sound p rocessor  used in this study  are commercially cleared by 
[CONTACT_2165] (FDA) and is considered standard of care.

 Method of Subject Identification and Recruitment  
Subjects will be recruited into the study sequentially to ensure a subject pool representative of the general population of those with hearing loss, with no pre- selection based on age (other 
than being  between  5 and 12 years -of-age), ethnicity or gender as described in Section 2.0.  
The identification and recruitment of subjects will protect patient privacy and be free of undue influence.  
 Process of Consent  
Prior to recruitment of any subjects into the study, written approval of the i nvestigational plan 
including clinical protocol and informed consent form will be obtained from reviewing Institutional Review Board (IRB). An interview (as part of the informed consent process) will be conducted by [CONTACT_51896]/or audiologist to inform  the subject  about rationale for and the 
details, aims, objectives of the study, study expectations, evaluation schedule, and the risks and benefits of the trial treatment (and alternative treatments), and the extent of the patient’s involvement. Written i nformed consent shall be obtained from each subject after this 
explanation. After reviewing the Informed Consent Form, the subject  will be given the 
opportunity to review and ask questions about the Informed Consent Form and/or the study prior to signing t he Informed Consent Form. The subject will be offered the opportunity to take 
the form home to discuss with family members should they choose to do so. If they sign the Informed Consent Form, the subject twill then be given a copy of the signed Informed Consent 
Form to take home.

 The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all patients give written informed consent prior 
to any study -related examination or activity. All patients shall sign and date the Informed 
Consent Form, and a copy of the Infor med Consent Form shall be given to the patient.  The 
Sponsor and the Investigator(s) shall avoid improper influence on or inducement of the subject, monitor, the Investigator(s) or other parties participating in or contributing to the clinical investigation.   
 Subject Capacity  
Subjects participating in this study will have the capacity to provide informed consent as 
assessed by [CONTACT_32366]. The only anticipated exception this is minors, for which assent will be obtained in addition to parental consent.  
 Subject/Representati ve Comprehension  
 Consent Forms  
The informed consent form provided for this study will meet requirements for specific sections as described in [ADDRESS_54816]  is not considered enrolled until a properly executed Informed Consent Form has 
been obtained and inclusion/exclusion information has been reviewed and approved by 
[CONTACT_51894], as evidenced by [CONTACT_51897] a study approval form signed by a Cochlear 
Americas representative.

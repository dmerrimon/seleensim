Confidential   Page 21 of 87 3.4.2 Benefits 
The potential benefits of OTL38  ovarian cancer imaging are:  
• Improved staging of the tumor  
• Removal 
of more lesions  
• Added assur
ance of clean margins to excised tumors.  
In a preliminary study by  [CONTACT_120288] ( 2011) , significantly more lesions were detected by 
[CONTACT_120289] -FITC than with visual observation alone (34 vs. 7; p <  0.001). Lesions as 
small as 1  mm could be detected and removed.  This resulted in better  staging of patients as more 
lesions could be visualized but , more importantly , it resulted in greater tumor debulking.  Since 
the degree of tumor removal directly affects the prognosis, this was a large potential  benefit.  This 
would need to be studied with OTL38 . Use of OTL38 would not  change the surg eon’s option to 
remove additional tissue because of impressions based on experience, visualization, or tactile 
senses . The smallest detectable tumor using OTL38 in the phase 2 study

Confidential   Page 38 of 87 7 PROCEDURES FOR REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS  
7.1 Adverse Events D efinit ions 
The investigator will monitor the occurrence of AEs during the course of the study that will end 
with Visit 4.  
The following definitions of terms are guided by [CONTACT_120291] 
(21 CFR 312.
32(a)) and are included here.  
Adverse event  is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient associated with the use of a drug 
in humans, whether or not considered drug related . 
Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, "reasonable 
possibility" means there is evidence to  suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the 
adverse event. Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality 
than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.  
Unexpected adverse event (adverse drug experience) or (su
 spected) adverse reaction means any 
adverse event  or (suspected) adverse reaction  that is not listed in the investigator brochure or is 
not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed.  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the invest
igator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life - threatening 
adverse event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent o r 
significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120279], based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, t hey may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
An adverse event is considered “life- threateni ng” if, in th e view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, its occurrence places the patient at immediate risk of death. It does not include an 
adverse event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
Suspected  Unexpected  Serious  Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) is any (suspected) adverse reaction 
(any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event) that is both serious and unexpected.  
An adverse device effect ( ADE ) is defined as any untoward and unint ended response to a medical  
device, in this study, the camera/ imaging system.  This definition includes any adverse event 
resulting from insufficiencies or inadequacies in the instructions for use or the deployment of the 
device, as well as any adverse even t that is the result of a user error [ISO [ZIP_CODE] -1:2003 (E) 3.1].  
All ADEs noted during the study will be reported in the eCRF.  
A suspected ADE is a subset of all ADEs for which there is a reasonable possibility (ie, evidence 
to suggest
 a causal relationshi p between the device and the ADE) that the device caused the event.  
Suspected ADE implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse device effect.  
[ADDRESS_134552], problem, or death was not 
previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incid ence in the investigational plan or 
application , or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to 
the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects. [21 CFR 812.3 (s)]  
7.[ADDRESS_134553] ration  and throughout the course of the study  that will end with Visit 4.  
All AEs (including ADE s) will  be recorded in the appropriate section of the eCRF.  Patients 
withdrawn from the study because of AEs will be followed by [CONTACT_120292].  When appropriate, additional written reports and documentation will be provided.  
All AEs (including ADEs) beginn ing after the exposure to study drug must be reported to the 
sponsor or its designee if the onset of the AE was before Visit 4.  All AEs (including ADEs) that 
are judged by [CONTACT_120293] 4.  All AEs (including ADEs) that are judged by [CONTACT_120294].  
7.2.2 Laboratory Abnormalities 
To the extent possible, all laboratory abnormalities observed during the course of the study will 
be included under a reported AE describing a clinical syndrome (e.g., elevated blood urea 
nitrogen and creatinine in the setting of an AE of “renal failure” or elevated ALT/AST in the 
setting of an AE of “hepatitis”).  In these cases (e.g., an AE of renal failure), the laboratory 
abnormality itself (e.g., elevated creatinine) does not need to be recorded as an AE.  
In the absence of a reported AE identifying a clinical syndrome that encompasses the observed 
laborat
ory abnormality that “isolated” laboratory abnormality itself should be reported as an AE.  
Patients experiencing AEs or laboratory abnormalities will be assessed and appropriate evaluati
ons and interventions  performed until all parameters have returned to baseline levels, 
or are consistent with the patient’s then -current physical condition, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070]. 
7.2.3 Serious Adverse Events  
Instructions for reporting Serious Adverse Events (SAE) and Suspected Unexpected Serious 
Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) are found on Page 2. A written report of all SAEs that occur after 
the a
dministration of study drug and during the study ( ending with Visit 4) must be submitted to 
the IRB/ethics committee (EC) and the Sponsor.  SAEs/ S[LOCATION_003]Rs must be reported to the Sponsor 
within [ADDRESS_134554] be submitted to the IRB/EC in an annual report.  
7.2.[ADDRESS_134555] notify the Medical monitor (see Page 3 for details) within [ADDRESS_134556] be met.  
7.2.5 Disease Progression 
The progression of the ovarian cancer per se will not constitute an AE.  However, if the 
progression of the ovarian cancer meets the criteria for an SAE , then it should be reported  as an 
SAE ( see Page 2). 
7.2.[ADDRESS_134557] categorize the severity of each AE according to the following : 
• Mild: Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated and are of minor irritant type. 
Sympt
oms do not require therapy or a m edical evaluation; signs and symptoms are 
transient.  
• Moderate: Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the participant, but ar
e usually improved by [CONTACT_14212]; moderate experiences may 
cause some interference with funct ioning 
• Severe:  Event s generally require systemic drug therapy or other treatment; they are 
usually incapacitating

Safety will be evaluated using the safety analysis set and will include treatment emergent adverse 
events (TEAEs) , adverse device effects (ADEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), vital signs, 
physical examinations, clinical laboratory measurements, electrocardiograms, and concomitant medications . For all safety assessments, the baseline value will be the last non -missing value 
recorded for a particular safety parameter before exposure to study drug . In general, the analysis 
of safety will be descriptive. No data will be imputed except for partial dates if required to 
determine if an adverse event is treatment emergent o r a medication concomitant with exposure 
to study drug.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Events 
Adverse events occurring prior to exposure to OTL38 administration will be provided in line 
listings . Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be summarized via the MedDRA 
system organ class and preferred term using subject incidence rates . Data will be tabulated by 
[CONTACT_926], physician assessment of relationship to study drug, serious TEAEs, and TEAEs leading 
to death or study withdrawal. Further description of TEAEs may be defined by [CONTACT_120296] . Additional summaries of TEAEs identified as p otential  ADEs will also be 
provided.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
The analysis of laboratory parameters will include descriptive statistics for the change from basel ine to each post -baseline study visit as well as shifts from baseline to each post -baseline 
study visit for categorical lab parameters . In addition, shift tables (i.e., low -normal -high at 
baseline versus low -normal- high at last visit will be provided. Urinalysis and pregnancy results 
will not be summarized but will be provided in a data listing . For all relevant laboratory data, 
values above or below normal limits will be flagged along with the direction of abnormality  in 
line listings . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of OTL38 will be estimated by [CONTACT_120297] -time (Ct) data using established methods including 
maximum likelihood parameter estimation and nonlinear mixed -effects (NLME) modeling 
approaches, with the patient serving as the random effect. Various structural PK and error 
models will be fit to data using a qualified, standard software package. Primary PK parameters 
will be estimated at the population level and for  individual patients as post -hoc empi[INVESTIGATOR_120280] (EBEs). The actual primary parameters may vary depending on the supported model, but are likely to include systemic clearance (CL), volumes of distribution of the central and peripheral compartm ent(s) (V
c, V p), distributional clearance (CL d), or derivatives thereof. 
Inter -patient variability in select PK parameters will be assessed as part of the model, as will the 
residual error. Secondary parameters may include, but are not limited to: model pr edicted 
maximum concentration (C max), time of C max (Tmax), area under the concentration -time curve 
(AUC) to the last time point (AUC last) and to infinity (AUC inf), and the terminal elimination half -

the population and individual level.  Individual primary EBE and secondary parameters will be 
presented as listings at the patient level.  
Potential covariates explaini ng inter -s ubject PK variability, and their influe nce upon PK 
parameters, will be initially screened using a two -stage approach  with standard parametric 
statistical tests on the individual patient EBEs, focusing on CL. Covariates of interest will include  
baseline demographic values (e.g. height, weight, a ge, BSA, BMI, race), and laboratory values 
predictive of renal or hepatic function (e.g. BUN, creatinine, calculated creatinine clearance or 
GFR, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, and total bilirubin). If warranted, a single stage 
approach with direct incorporation of covariates into the NLME PK model may be undertaken 
using a forward addition - backward deletion method at an alpha level of 0.05.  
The final model PK parameter estimates, and any bootstrapped results, will be reported as a 
table,
 includ ing the estimates, their standard errors, or confidence intervals. The covariate 
coefficient estimates, their standard errors, and the associated P values for those significant at the alpha level of 0.05 will be tabulated. Relationships between covariates and PK parameters will 
be graphically presented as figures. Additional details will be found in the PK  analysis plan 
(PKAP).

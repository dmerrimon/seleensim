TITLE Neoadjuvant gemcitabine, cisplatin, plus nivolumab in patients with 
muscle-invasive bladder cancer with selective bladder sparing   
PHASE  II 
OBJECTIVES Primary Objectives 
 Determine the clinical complete response rate with gemcitabine, 
cisplatin, plus nivolumab 
 Determine the ability of clinical complete response (cT0 or cTa) to 
predict benefit from treatment. Benefit will be defined as a 
pathologic complete response (<pT1) in patients undergoing 
cystectomy and 2 year metastasis-free in patients pursuing 
surveillance 
 
Secondary Objectives 
 Determine the safety of neoadjuvant gemcitabine, cisplatin, plus 
nivolumab 
 Describe the proportion of patients with a clinical complete 
response to pursue cystectomy versus surveillance 
 Determine the association between a prespecified panel of 
genomic biomarkers and benefit from treatment in patients 
achieving a clinical complete response. Benefit will be defined as 
a pathologic complete response (p<T1) in patients undergoing 
cystectomy and 2 years metastasis-free in patients pursuing 
surveillance 
 Determine the pathologic complete response rate (<pT1) in 
patients pursuing cystectomy 
 Determine the 2-year metastasis free survival.  
 Determine overall survival (and bladder-intact overall survival 
rate) 
 Determine the recurrence-free survival 
 
Exploratory Objectives 
 Explore the association of immune biomarkers, genomic 
alterations, circulating tumor DNA, gene expression, and 
radiographic characteristics (including radiomics) with clinical 
complete response rate, <pT1 rate (where applicable), recurrence-
free survival, the bladder-intact overall survival, and overall 
survival 
 Explore potential genomic and immunologic biomarkers in the 
urine and blood that correlate with treatment benefi t

Clinical Study Protocol 
HCRN GU16-257 
Version Date: 12AUG2021 Confidential Page [ADDRESS_613960] treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer 
There are approximately 77,000 new cases of bladder cancer diagnosed each year in the United 
States. Approximately 30% of patients present with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) 
without evidence of distant metastatic disease. Standard treatment for such patients is radical 
cystectomy; however, this approach is associated with a life-changing need for urinary diversion 
and a 90-day mortality rate of ~2-10%.1–4 Furthermore, despi[INVESTIGATOR_478440], approximately 50% of patients still develop lethal metastatic recurrence.[ADDRESS_613961] 
demonstrated an improvement in survival with the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with an 
absolute survival benefit of approximately 5-10%.7–9  
  
Radiation therapy, with or without concurrent chemoradiation, also represents a potential 
treatment options for MIBC. However, such treatment is associated with grade 3-4 toxicities in 
20-30% of patients, late grade  3 pelvic toxicity in approximately 7% of patients, and the need 
for salvage cystectomy in 15-30% of patients.10  
 
Together, these findings highlight the need for novel bladder-sparing treatment strategies for 
MIBC.  
 
1.2 A large subset of patients with MIBC treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
achieve a pathologic complete response 
After patients undergo treatment with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_268223], the bladder specimen is assessed for pathologic evidence of residual cancer. 
Important, in a subset of patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, there is no pathologic 
evidence of residual disease (i.e., pathologic complete response or pCR) and this finding has 
been associated with improved long term clinical outcomes. For example, in the Southwest 
Oncology Group 8710 trial comparing cystectomy alone versus 3 cycles of MVAC 
(methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, plus cisplatin) followed by [CONTACT_64881], 38% of patients 
treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy achieved a pCR. The median survival of patients treated 
with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_478454] a pCR was not reached 
compared with 3.[ADDRESS_613962] confirmed that achieving a pCR is highly correlated with improved 
recurrence-free survival and overall survival (Table 1).11

1.3 Systemic chemotherapy alone as definitive treatment for patients with MIBC 
Because neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy achieves a pCR in approximately 30-40% of 
patients with MIBC, a logical question is why this subset of patients requires surgical removal of 
the bladder (in which case the resected bladder specimen ultimately reveals no evidence of 
cancer)? The use of transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) plus systemic 
chemotherapy alone for the treatment of MIBC is not a new concept. In fact, this approach has 
been explored since the early 1990’s.12–15 In a series from Herr et al (Table 2), patients achieving 
a clinical CR (i.e., no evidence of disease on post-chemotherapy cystoscopy, TURBT, and CT 
scan) with chemotherapy and not undergoing cystectomy demonstrated similar rates of long term 
survival to patients undergoing immediate cystectomy.13

The body of literature describing the role of TURBT plus systemic therapy was systematically 
and comprehensively reviewed by [CONTACT_478455] 2017.16 This systematic review and 
meta-analysis revealed key findings highlighting the potential benefit of this strategy and the 
need for further study. These key findings are summarized below: 
 
 Much of the literature describing chemotherapy plus TURBT as definitive management 
of MIBC is based on retrospective series and/or single center series. 
 Prior studies of this approach have included a mix of approaches including the use of 
carboplatin-based chemotherapy, lack of post-treatment TURBT, and offering 
surveillance to patients even without a clinical complete response to treatment. 
 Meta-analysis of these studies revealed an estimated 5-year survival rate of 72%. 
 There have only been two contemporary prospective  studies exploring chemotherapy plus

cystoscopic surveillance alone (those without a clinical CR were to undergo immediate 
cystectomy). A clinical CR was achieved in 34 of 74 patients (46%). Of the 34 patients with a 
clinical CR, 10 underwent immediate cystectomy, 6 of whom had pathologic evidence of 
residual cancer.  With a median follow-up of 22 months the Kaplan-Meier estimate of 2-year 
survival for the entire study population was 59% (95% CI 45, 72). Among the 34 patients with a 
clinical CR after chemotherapy, the 2-year survival estimate was 75% (95% CI 57, 93). Of the 
24 patients with clinical CR who did not undergo cystectomy, the 2-year overall survival 
estimate was 76%. Of the 10 patients with a clinical CR who underwent cystectomy, the 2-year 
overall survival estimate was 70%. While long term outcomes were similar among the small 
subgroups of patients achieving clinical T0 status undergoing immediate cystectomy versus 
cystoscopic surveillance alone, the disconnect between clinical and pathologic CR status led the 
authors to conclude that definitive cystectomy after completion of chemotherapy should still be 
strongly considered. However, this study utilized a carboplatin-based regimen and cisplatin-
based chemotherapy is standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy in MIBC and has been associated 
with higher complete response rates.17 Further, this interpretation minimizes the potential role of 
salvage cystectomy. 
 
Indeed, these considerations are exemplified in a recent retrospective series describing the 
outcomes of patients with MIBC achieving a clinical CR to cisplatin-based chemotherapy.18 A 
series from Meyer et. al. included 109 patients treated at a single institution, 32 of whom 
achieved a clinical CR with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Of 25/32 patients who declined radical 
cystectomy after achieving a clinical CR, 7 experienced local relapse during follow-up and 
proceeded to radical cystectomy. In the 25/32 patients who elected bladder preservation after 
achieving a clinical CR with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the 5-year cancer specific survival was 
88%. 
 
1.3.[ADDRESS_613965] to proceed with radical cystectomy versus a bladder-sparing approach involving systemic 
chemotherapy alone. Systemic therapy was comprised of combination chemotherapy which 
evolved during the course of the study and could include carboplatin-based therapy in patients 
with impaired renal function. In this study, 75 patients opted for TURBT + chemotherapy and 71 
patients opted for radical cystectomy and despi[INVESTIGATOR_478442], there was no 
significant difference between important covariates in these groups. Of the patients opting for the 
bladder-sparing approach, the cancer specific survival and progression-free survival with bladder 
Clinical Study Protocol 
HCRN GU16-257 
Version Date: 12AUG2021 Confidential Page 12 of 70 preserved at 5 years were 64.5% and 59.8% respectively, and at 10 years were 52.6% and 34.5%, 
respectively.  Comparing the cancer specific survival of the bladder-sparing and radical 
cystectomy cohorts, there was no significant difference between them. Though this study differs 
in important ways from other TURBT plus chemotherapy approaches as definitive management 
of MIBC (i.e., the decision to pursue bladder-sparing was made prior to initiation of 
chemotherapy and there was no risk stratification based on clinical response to chemotherapy), 
comparable outcomes were still observed relative to the cystectomy cohort. 
 
Together, the collective literature evaluating TURBT plus systemic therapy for the 
management of MIBC demonstrates the feasibility of this approach and relatively similar 
longer term outcomes based on non-randomized comparisons with patients underoing 
immediate cystectomy.  However, aditional prospective studies are required as are improved 
systemic therapy approaches and potential predictive biomarkers to fully realize this potential 
paradigm shift in MIBC care.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_613966] 
uncovered recurrent somatic alterations providing clues to disease pathogenesis and identifying 
potential therapeutic targets. Somatic alterations in genes encoding proteins involved in DNA 
damage response and repair are relatively common in MIBC. Indeed, analysis of data from 389 
urothelial cancer specimens from The Cancer Genome Atlas reveals deleterious (nonsense, 
frameshift, splice site, or hotspot missense) alterations in DNA damage response genes (DDR) in 
approximately ~28% of bladder cancers. Because computational predictions, and functional 
analyses, of many such alterations suggest these alterations result in loss of function, this raises 
the hypothesis that cancer cells with faulty DNA damage response and repair machinery may be 
particularly susceptible to DNA-damaging chemotherapy. Indeed, at least four studies have now 
demonstrated that the presence of somatic mutations in DDR genes correlates with an increased 
likelihood of achieving a pCR to cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy in patients with 
MIBC.20–23 In an analysis of a cohort of 50 patients with MIBC (25 patients achieving a pCR and 
25 patients not achieving a pCR with neoadjuvant chemotherapy), Rosenberg and colleagues 
performed whole exome sequencing on the pre-chemotherapy transurethral resection of bladder 
tumor (TURBT) specimens and demonstrated that the presence of mutations in ERCC2 were 
found exclusively in the patients achieving a pCR.21 ERCC2 encodes a nucleotide excision repair 
protein and is mutated in ~12% of MIBCs. The correlation between ERCC2 mutations and pCR 
was subsequently validated in an independent cohort.[ADDRESS_613967] genes (ATM, RB1, and 
FANCC) predicted pCR (p<0.001, 87% sensitivity, 100% specificity) and better overall survival 
(p=0.007). Notably, in both the studies from Rosenberg and Plimack, higher somatic mutational 
load was also associated with an increased likelihood of achieving a pCR. Iyer and colleagues 
performed targeted exome sequencing on a cohort of patients with MIBC treated on a phase [ADDRESS_613968] gene mutations were 
associated with achieving a pCR with 92% specificity and a positive predictive value of 88%.

1.[ADDRESS_613970] mutations may also increase the likelihood of response to immune checkpoint 
blockade 
Though several putative predictive biomarkers of response to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade have been 
explored in clinical trials to date, mutational load (i.e., the number of non-synonymous mutations 
per tumor specimen) has been consistently demonstrated to correlate with response across 
several solid tumors including urothelial cancer of the bladder.24,[ADDRESS_613971] gene 
mutations (e.g., homologous recombination, nucleotide excision repair, etc) and both mutational 
load and response to immune checkpoint blockade has been underexplored. To explore this 
notion, we utilized three cohorts: (1) TCGA MIBC cohort (n = 389), (2) Mount Sinai (MS) 
cohort (n = 67) of bladder cancer (cystectomy) specimens subjected to targeted exome 
sequencing for 341 genes (MSK-IMPACT), and (3) Phase 2 trial of gemcitabine, cisplatin, plus 
CTLA-4 blockade with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (GCI) in metastatic urothelial cancer from which 28/36 
enrolled patients had specimens suitable for whole exome sequencing. Deleterious mutations in 
Clinical Study Protocol 
HCRN GU16-257 
Version Date: 12AUG2021 Confidential Page [ADDRESS_613972] genes, were highly correlated (rs= 0.81, p < 0.001). Associations between deleterious 
DDR mutations and mutational load are shown in Table 4. In the MS cohort, CD8+cells/mm2 by 
[CONTACT_478456] (p = 
0.04). In the GCI cohort, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative 
predictive value of a deleterious DDR mutation for objective response to treatment was 40.9% 
(95% CI 20.7-63.7%), 86.7% (95% CI 42.1-99.4%), 90% (55.5-99.8%), and 31.6% (95% CI 
12.6-56.6%), respectively. Notably, [ADDRESS_613973] mutational loads, achieved complete responses after GCI and are alive without evidence 
of disease at 2.1+ and 1.8+ years. These findings demonstrate that DDR mutations are associated 
with higher mutational load in bladder cancer, a high likelihood of response to chemotherapy 
plus immune checkpoint blockade, and may identify a subset of patients with metastatic 
urothelial bladder cancer achieving durable disease control. Further, these findings support 
exploring cisplatin-based chemotherapy with more efficacious immune checkpoint blockade in 
bladder cancer (i.e., PD-1 blockade) in patients with DDR-mutant, or high mutational load 
harboring, bladder cancer.

reported by [CONTACT_478457].30 Sixty patients with urothelial cancer enrolled in prospective 
trials of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies were analyzed. Any DDR and known or likely deleterious 
DDR mutations were identified in 28 (47%) and 15 (25%) patients, respectively. The presence of 
any DDR alteration was associated with a higher response rate (67.9% v 18.8%; P < .001). A 
higher response rate was observed in patients whose tumors harbored known or likely deleterious 
DDR alterations (80%) compared with DDR alterations of unknown significance (54%) and in 
those whose tumors were wild-type for DDR genes (19%; P < .001). DDR alterations also were 
associated with longer progression-free and overall survival. 
 
Together, these findings indicate that the presence of DDR mutations might predict response 
to cisplatin-based chemotherapy and PD-1/PD-L1 blockade independently and might identify 
patients particularly sensitive to combination therapy.

antibody that binds to the programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1), a negative regulatory 
molecule expressed by [CONTACT_93247] T and B lymphocytes. Inhibition of the interaction between PD-

Version Date: 12AUG2021 Confidential Page [ADDRESS_613975] been durable and 
exceeded 6 months. The overall safety experience with nivolumab, as a monotherapy or in 
combination with other therapeutics, is based on experience in approximately 4,000 subjects 
treated to date. For nivolumab monotherapy, the safety profile has been similar across tumor 
types.  
 
1.7 Nivolumab in urothelial cancer 
The safety and activity of single-agent nivolumab advanced urothelial cancer has been explored 
in two prospective clinical trials to date. CheckMate 032 was a phase 1/2 study enrolling 86 
patients to treatment with nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks; [ADDRESS_613976] one dose of 
treatment.31 A confirmed objective response was achieved in 19 (24.4%, 95% CI 15.3-35.4) of 
[ADDRESS_613977] majority of responses were durable. Based on these results, a large phase 
II trial was initiated to confirm the safety and activity of nivolumab in metastatic urothelial 
cancer. CheckMate 275 enrolled 270 patients with metastatic urothelial cancer that had 
progressed despi[INVESTIGATOR_478443]-based chemotherapy.32 With a minimum follow-up of 7 
months, the objective response rate was 19.6% (95% CI 15.0-24.9%). While higher tumor PD-L1 
expression (as measured by [CONTACT_9064]) on tumor cells was associated with a 
numerically higher objective response rate, responses were seen even in patients with PD-L1 
expression < 1% [objective response rate = 16.1% (95% CI 10.5–23.1]. Responses occurred 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375] [median time to response = 1.9 months (1.6–5.9)] and were durable; at a median follow-
up of 7 months, 77% of responses were ongoing. The safety profile of nivolumab was consistent 
with what has been observed across indications (Table 5 and 6).

Given the experience with nivolumab in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer, the Food and 
Drug Administration approval of atezolizumab (PD-L1 antibody) for the treatment of patients 
with platinum-resistant metastatic urothelial cancer24, and the demonstration of an improvement 
in survival with pembrolizumab (PD-1 antibody) compared with chemotherapy in patients with 
platinum-resistant metastatic urothelial cancer, exploring PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in earlier 
bladder cancer disease states is warranted.  
 
1.8 Combining nivolumab with chemotherapy 
An expansion of CheckMate 012 study explored nivolumab in combination with platinum-based 
chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer including combination 
regimens with gemcitabine plus cisplatin, paclitaxel plus carboplatin, or pemetrexed plus 
cisplatin (n= 56).33 The safety profile of nivolumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy was 
consistent with that expected for the individual agents. A second trial explored the combination 
of nivolumab 10 mg/kg + gemcitabine plus cisplatin, pemetrexed plus cisplatin, paclitaxel plus 
carboplatin plus bevacizumab or docetaxel (n=24) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung 
cancer.34 This trial demonstrated similar findings with no new safety signals observed with the 
combination regimens.  
 
1.9 Rationale for current trial 
This is a phase 2 trial seeking to define the safety and activity of gemcitabine, cisplatin, plus 
nivolumab as neoadjuvant therapy in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer and to 
determine the potential role of a clinical complete response in identifying patients who can be 
definitively managed without cystectomy.   
 
  
Clinical Study Protocol 
HCRN GU16-257 
Version Date: 12AUG2021 Confidential Page 17 of 70 The current study is supported by [CONTACT_453914] 
1. Radical cystectomy is potentially curative for patients with MIBC but is a life-changing 
operation and achieves cure in only 50% of unselected patients. Further, the risk of 
mortality within 90-days of cystectomy in the [LOCATION_002] is approximately 8%.4 
2. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy results in an absolute survival improvement of approximately 
5-10%. However, patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy achieving a pCR have 
markedly improved outcomes. 
3. TURBT plus chemotherapy as definitive management for MIBC, in patients achieving a 
clinical CR, has been shown to be feasible, leads to a relatively high rate of bladder-intact 
disease-free and overall survival, and achieves outcomes comparable immediate 
cystectomy in non-randomized studies. However, there have been a paucity of 
prospective studies seeking to refine this approach.  
4. Chemotherapy and PD-[ADDRESS_613979] 
already been shown to improves outcomes in other solid tumors (e.g., non-small cell lung 
cancer). Therfore, TURBT plus chemotherapy plus PD-1 blockade may represent a novel 
paradigm-shifting curative bladder sparing approach to patients with MIBC achieving a 
clinical complete response to treatment. 
5. Genomic biomarkers may allow refinement of this approach and warrant further 
investigation.

5. TREATMENT PLAN 
 
5.1 Treatment Overview 
Subjects with cT2-T4aN0M0 urothelial cancer of the bladder will be enrolled. After completing 
four cycles of neoadjuvant gemcitabine, cisplatin, plus nivolumab, subjects will undergo a 
restaging MRI of the abdomen and pelvis (and CT chest). A CT of the abdomen and pelvis may 
be performed if there are contraindications for MRI. Patients will also undergo a restaging 
cystoscopy and biopsies/TURBT. If there is evidence of gross residual disease at cystoscopy, 
biopsies/TURBT may be performed at the discretion of the treating physician but such patients 
will be considered as having not achieved a clinical complete response and will proceed with 
cystectomy.  
 
Patients achieving a clinical complete response to treatment (defined in section 9.1) may opt to 
proceed with cystectomy or may opt to proceed with an additional [ADDRESS_613984]. Patients opting for surveillance will

regarding this approach.  
 
For restaging imaging studies after gemcitabine + cisplatin + nivolumab, an MRI abdomen and pelvis should be 
performed unless contraindicated – the preferred MRI protocol is outlined in Table 7.

The body surface area and chemotherapy drug dose should be recalculated ONLY if the patient’s 
weight changes by > 10% during the course of the study. 
 
5.4 Concomitant Medications 
 
5.4.1 Allowed Concomitant Medications 
Medications specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed during the ongoing 
trial.  If there is a clinical indication for any medication specifically prohibited during the trial, 
discontinuation from trial therapy or vaccination may be required.  The site investigator should 
discuss any questions regarding this with the sponsor-investigator.  The final decision on any 
supportive therapy rests with the site investigator and/or the subject's primary physician.  
However, the decision to continue the subject on trial therapy schedule requires the mutual 
agreement of the site investigator, the sponsor-investigator and the subject. 
 All treatments that the site investigator considers necessary for a subject’s welfare may 
be administered at the discretion of the treating investigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_353178].   
 All concomitant medications received within [ADDRESS_613986] dose of trial treatment should be recorded.  
 Concomitant therapy includes any prescription medications or over-the-counter 
preparations used by a patient between the 7 days preceding the screening evaluation and 
the treatment discontinuation visit. 
 Patients who use oral contraceptives, hormone-replacement therapy, prophylactic or 
therapeutic anticoagulation therapy (such as low-molecular-weight heparin or warfarin at 
a stable dose level), or other allowed maintenance therapy should continue their use.  
Females of reproductive potential should use highly effective means of contraception as 
outlined in the eligibility.

6.4 Dose Delays/Modifications for Other Treatment Related Non-Hematological 
Toxicity Secondary to Gemcitabine or Cisplatin 
Dose delays/reductions for non-hematologic toxicities attributable to gemcitabine or cisplatin 
(with the exception of alopecia or nausea/vomiting not optimally managed with antiemetics) are 
outlined in the table below. Only the drugs felt to be contributing to the toxicity per the site 
investigator should be dose reduced. Patients with treatment-related nausea that is Grade ≥ 2

If the Day 8 dose of gemcitabine is held for non-hematologic toxicity, the “Day 8” dose of 
gemcitabine may be administered the following week provided the adverse event was adequately 
improved or resolved. If the adverse event has not adequately improved or resolved within 2 
weeks, the “day 8” dose of gemcitabine should be held for that cycle and treatment should 
resume (once the adverse event improves/resolves) with the next cycle of treatment.

gemcitabine) and nivolumab but this must be discussed with the sponsor-investigator. 
 
6.[ADDRESS_613990] been developed for 
suspected AEs of selected categories. [see current Investigator Brochure and Appendix A] 
 
Dose delay criteria apply for all drug-related adverse events (regardless of whether or not the 
event is attributed to nivolumab). All study drugs must be delayed until treatment can resume. In 
rare circumstances, treatment with gemcitabine plus cisplatin could potentially be continued in 
the setting of select adverse events related to nivolumab after discussion and approval from the 
sponsor-investigator. 
 
Nivolumab administration should be delayed for the following 
Any Grade ≥ 2 non-skin, drug-related AE, with the following exceptions: 
 Grade 2 drug-related fatigue or laboratory abnormalities do not require a treatment delay 
 Any Grade 3 skin, drug-related AE 
 Any Grade [ADDRESS_613991], ALT, total bilirubin, or asymptomatic amylase or lipase: 
o Grade [ADDRESS_613992], ALT, or total bilirubin that is within normal 
limits, delay dosing for drug-related Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_613993], ALT, or total bilirubin within the Grade 1 toxicity 
range, delay dosing for drug-related Grade ≥ 3 toxicity. 
o Any Grade ≥ 3 drug-related amylase or lipase abnormality that is not associated 
with symptoms or clinical manifestations of pancreatitis does not require dose 
delay. The sponsor-investigator should be consulted for such Grade ≥ 3 amylase 
or lipase abnormalities. 
 
Any AE, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment of the site 
investigator, warrants delaying the dose of study medication. 
 
Subjects who require delay of nivolumab should be re-evaluated weekly or more frequently 
if clinically indicated and resume nivolumab dosing when re-treatment criteria are met. 
 
  
Clinical Study Protocol 
HCRN GU16-257 
Version Date: 12AUG2021 Confidential Page 29 of 70 6.5.2 Criteria to Resume Treatment 
Subjects may resume treatment with nivolumab when the drug-related AE(s) resolve to Grade ≤1 
or baseline value, with the following exceptions: 
 Subjects may resume treatment in the presence of Grade 2 fatigue  
 Subjects who have not experienced a Grade 3 drug-related skin AE may resume 
treatment in the presence of Grade 2 skin toxicity  
 Subjects with baseline Grade [ADDRESS_613994], ALT OR total bilirubin 
 Subjects with combined Grade [ADDRESS_613995] treatment permanently discontinued 
 Drug-related pulmonary toxicity, diarrhea, or colitis, must have resolved to baseline 
before treatment is resumed.  
 Drug-related endocrinopathies adequately controlled with only physiologic hormone 
replacement may resume treatment . 
 
If the criteria to resume treatment are met, the subject should restart treatment at the next 
scheduled timepoint per protocol. However, if the treatment is delayed past the next scheduled 
timepoint per protocol, the next scheduled timepoint will be delayed until dosing resumes.

6.6 Management Algorithms 
Guidelines for the management of immune related events can be found in the current Investigator 
Brochure AND in the Appendix A. Site investigators should decide the appropriate source of AE 
management for each protocol. 
 
Immuno-oncology (I-O) agents are associated with AEs that can differ in severity and duration 
than AEs caused by [CONTACT_20451]. Nivolumab is considered an immuno-oncology 
agent in this protocol. Early recognition and management of AEs associated with immuno-
oncology agents may mitigate severe toxicity. Management algorithms have been developed to 
assist investigators in assessing and managing the following groups of AEs: Gastrointestinal, 
Renal, Pulmonary, Hepatic, Endocrinopathies, Skin, Neurological. 
 
For subjects expected to require more than [ADDRESS_613997] the site investigator’s medical 
judgment but should complement it. 
 
  
Clinical Study Protocol 
HCRN GU16-257 
Version Date: 12AUG2021 Confidential Page [ADDRESS_613998] with fever, chills, rigors, headache, rash, pruritis, arthralgias, hypo- or 
hypertension, bronchospasm, or other symptoms of allergic-like reactions.  
 
All Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions should be reported as an SAE if criteria are met. Infusion 
reactions should be graded according to NCI CTCAE v4.03 guidelines. Treatment 
recommendations are provided below and may be modified based on local treatment standards 
and guidelines as appropriate: 
 
For Grade 1 symptoms:  (Mild reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; intervention not 
indicated) 
 Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from symptoms. The following 
prophylactic premedications are recommended for future infusions: diphenhydramine 50 
mg (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg (acetaminophen) at least 30 
minutes before additional nivolumab administrations. 
 
For Grade 2 symptoms : (Moderate reaction requires therapy or infusion interruption but 
responds promptly to symptomatic treatment [e.g., antihistamines, non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs, narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids]; prophylactic 
medications indicated for 24 hours). 
 Stop the nivolumab infusion, begin an IV infusion of normal saline, and treat the subject 
with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg 
(acetaminophen); remain at bedside and monitor subject until resolution of symptoms. 
Corticosteroid or bronchodilator therapy may also be administered as appropriate. If the 
infusion is interrupted, then restart the infusion at 50% of the original infusion rate when 
symptoms resolve; if no further complications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be 
increased to 100% of the original infusion rate. Monitor subject closely. If symptoms 
recur, then no further nivolumab will be administered at that visit. Administer 
diphenhydramine [ADDRESS_613999] be recorded on the 
electronic case report form (eCRF). The following prophylactic premedications are 
recommended for future infusions: diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or 
paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg (acetaminophen) should be administered at least 30 minutes 
before additional nivolumab administrations. If necessary, corticosteroids (recommended 
dose: up to 25 mg of IV hydrocortisone or equivalent) may be used. 
 
For Grade 3 or Grade 4 symptoms:  (Severe reaction, Grade 3: prolonged [i.e., not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_20309]/or brief interruption of infusion]; recurrence of 
symptoms following initial improvement; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14138] 
[e.g., renal impairment, pulmonary infiltrates]). Grade 4: (life threatening; pressor or ventilatory 
support indicated).  
 Immediately discontinue infusion of nivolumab. Begin an IV infusion of normal saline, 
and treat the subject as follows. Recommend bronchodilators, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 0.2 to 1 mg of 
a 1:1,000 solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a 1:10,000 
Clinical Study Protocol

Version Date: 12AUG2021 Confidential Page 31 of 70 solution injected slowly for IV administration, and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with 
methylprednisolone 100 mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. Subject should be monitored 
until the investigator is comfortable that the symptoms will not recur. Nivolumab will be 
permanently discontinued. Investigators should follow their institutional guidelines for 
the treatment of anaphylaxis. Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery from 
symptoms.  
 
In the case of late-occurring hypersensitivity symptoms (e.g., appearance of a localized or 
generalized pruritis within 1 week after treatment), symptomatic treatment may be given (e.g., 
oral antihistamine, or corticosteroids). 
 
6.8 Discontinuation Criteria 
Treatment with nivolumab should be permanently discontinued for the following (while all study 
therapy should be discontinued for the majority of these scenarios, there are rare situations in 
which it could be acceptable to continue treatment with gemcitabine plus cisplatin despi[INVESTIGATOR_478446]. Continuing treatment with gemcitabine plus cisplatin should be 
discussed and approved by [CONTACT_456]-investigator): 
 Any Grade 2 drug-related uveitis or eye pain or blurred vision that does not respond to 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_20308] 1 severity within the re-treatment period 
OR requires systemic treatment  
 Any Grade 3 non-skin, drug-related adverse event lasting > 7 days, with the following 
exceptions for drug-related laboratory abnormalities, uveitis, pneumonitis, 
bronchospasm, hypersensitivity reactions, and infusion reactions, and endocrinopathies: 
o Grade 3 drug-related uveitis, pneumonitis, bronchospasm, hypersensitivity 
reaction, or infusion reaction of any duration requires discontinuation 
o Grade 3 drug-related endocrinopathies adequately controlled with only 
physiologic hormone replacement do not require discontinuation 
o Grade 3 drug-related laboratory abnormalities do not require treatment 
discontinuation except those noted below 
 Grade 3 drug-related thrombocytopenia > 7 days or associated with bleeding requires 
discontinuation 
 Any drug-related liver function test (LFT) abnormality that meets the following criteria 
require discontinuation:  
o AST or ALT > [ADDRESS_614000]  
o Total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_614001] or ALT > [ADDRESS_614002] and total bilirubin > [ADDRESS_614003] 
 Any Grade 4 drug-related adverse event or laboratory abnormality, except for the 
following events which do not require discontinuation: 
o Isolated Grade 4 amylase or lipase abnormalities that are not associated with 
symptoms or clinical manifestations of pancreatitis and decrease to < Grade 4 
within 1 week of onset.  
o Isolated Grade 4 electrolyte imbalances/abnormalities that are not associated with 
clinical sequelae and are corrected with supplementation/appropriate management 
within 72 hours of their onset 
o Grade 4 lymphopenia or leukopenia 
Clinical Study Protocol 
HCRN GU16-257 
Version Date: 12AUG2021 Confidential Page 32 of 70 o Grade 4 drug-related endocrinopathy adverse events, such as adrenal 
insufficiency, ACTH deficiency, hyper- or hypothyroidism, or glucose 
intolerance, which resolve or are adequately controlled with physiologic hormone 
replacement (corticosteroids, thyroid hormones) or glucose-controlling agents, 
respectively, may not require discontinuation after discussion with and approval 
from the sponsor-investigator. 
 Any dosing interruption lasting > 6 weeks with the following exceptions (these potential 
exceptions must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_456]-investigator): 
o Dosing delays or interruptions to allow for prolonged steroid tapers to manage 
drug-related adverse events are allowed. Prior to re-initiating treatment in a 
subject with a dosing interruption lasting > [ADDRESS_614004] be 
consulted. Tumor assessments should continue as per protocol even if dosing is 
interrupted or delayed 
o Dosing interruptions or delays lasting > [ADDRESS_614005] with a dosing interruption lasting > [ADDRESS_614006] be consulted. Tumor assessments should continue as 
per protocol even if dosing is interrupted 
 Any adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the judgment 
of the site investigator, presents a substantial clinical risk to the subject with continued 
nivolumab dosing 
 
6.[ADDRESS_614007] will also be 
discontinued from protocol therapy and followed per protocol under the following circumstances 
outlined below.  The reason for discontinuation of protocol therapy will be documented on the 
electronic case report form (eCRF)   
 Documented disease progression  
 Site investigator determines a change of therapy would be in the best interest of the 
subject 
 Subject requests to discontinue protocol therapy, whether due to unacceptable toxicity or 
for other reasons 
o In a subject decides to prematurely discontinue protocol therapy (“refuses 
treatment”), the subject should be asked if he or she may still be contact[CONTACT_328800]. The outcome of that discussion should be documented 
in both the medical records and in the eCRF. 
 Female subject becomes pregnant  
 Protocol therapy interruptions as defined above   
 
6.[ADDRESS_614008] decides to discontinue from the protocol (and not just from protocol therapy) all 
efforts should be made to complete and report study assessments as thoroughly as possible. A 
complete final evaluation at the time of the subject’s protocol withdrawal should be made with 
an explanation of why the subject is withdrawing from the protocol. If the reason for removal of 
a subject from the study is an adverse event, it will be recorded on the eCRF.

restaging assessment will meet the requirements of the D30 safety visit for those subjects not proceeding to nivolumab maintenance. During this 
visit the following will be done (1) review restaging studies, (2) confirm collection and submission of tissue and blood biospecimens and (3) 
determine plans for cystectomy  versus maintenance nivolumab  versus other treatment . Subjects who have achieved a cT0 or cTa disease with gem 
+ cis + nivolumab may opt to proceed to the single agent nivolumab phase of the study and be followed per the nivolumab maintenance calendar. 
Subjects who have achieved a cT0 or cTa disease with gem + cis + nivolumab who opt to proceed to cystectomy will be followed per the 
cystectomy calendar. Subjects who have > cTa disease with gem + cis + nivolumab will proceed with cystectomy as per standard care and be 
followed per the cystectomy calendar. Patients who do not proceed directly to other treatment will be followed per the calendar above.  
 
13 A D100 visit (± 7 days) to assess adverse events will occur for subjects that do not proceed with maintenance nivolumab or any definitive local 
therapy for any reason. This may be accomplished via clinic visit, phone call, or other avenues as appropriate. After the D100 visit, these subjects 
will be followed for disease progression (local and distant) per Table 8. Follow up information may be obtained via clinic visit, phone call, or other 
avenues as appropriate. Once disease progression is documented, subjects will enter a survival follow up period every 6 months for 2 years from 
the time of documented progression. Follow up may be accomplished via clinic visit, phone call, or other avenues as appropriate. 
  
14 Correlative samples and AE/conmeds collection done after completion of Cycle 4 should be done at one visit if possible (i.e., EITHER at time of 
restaging evaluation OR at post-restaging/D30 safety visit). If samples or AE/conmeds were missed at the time of the restaging evaluation, they 
may be collected at the post-restaging/D30 safety visit. This will not be considered a deviation.  
 
15 The main consent should be obtained prior to any study related procedures being performed. An additional consent (Addendum ICF) will be 
obtained at the post staging visit for subjects who have achieved a cT0 or cTa disease with gem + cis + nivolumab and opt to proceed to the single 
agent nivolumab phase of the study.

4After 4 months of treatment (approximately after cycle 12) of single agent maintenance nivolumab, subjects will undergo a restaging CT chest, 
MRI or CT of the abdomen and pelvis, and urine cytology. The standard of care preferred imaging sequences for the post-chemotherapy MRI 
abdomen and pelvis are outlined in Table 7. For patients with contraindications, to MRI, a CT of the abdomen and pelvis may be performed. A 
restaging cystoscopy +/- biopsies will be performed. Subjects with cT0 or cTa disease will follow-up as described in Table 8. For definition of cT0 
or Ta disease, see Section 9. Patients with cT0 or cTa disease, but with positive cytology, will undergo evaluation as per their treating physician. 
Subjects with cTis disease may receive intravesical therapy as per their treating urologist. Subjects with  cT1 disease will proceed with definitive 
local treatment as per discussions with their treating physician. . Such patients should subsequently be followed up as per the cystectomy calendar. 
CT/MRI images will be submitted for central analysis and images will be de-identified prior to sending. See CLM for additional details.   
 
5 Fixed paraffin-embedded blocks/slides will be requested from any restaging or progression cystoscopy/TURBTs/urothelial biopsies. These 
samples may also be obtained at progression. These samples may also be obtained at the safety visit after disease progression. See CLM for 
additional details. 
 
6Serial blood samples will be collected to support biomarker research; blood will be collected pre-dose Cycle 8, Cycle 12, and at the time of 
progression. These samples may also be obtained at the safety visit after disease progression. See CLM for additional details. 
 
7 The initial safety follow-up visit should only occur when subjects permanently stop study treatment for whatever reasons (toxicity, progression, 
or at discretion of site investigator) and should be performed 30 days (±7 days) after the last dose of treatment. Subjects who have an ongoing ≥ 
grade 2 or serious AE (SAE) at this visit will continue to be followed until the AE resolves to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline, deemed clinically 
insignificant, and/or until a new anti-cancer treatment starts, whichever is earlier.  The Day 100 safety follow up visit may be done via phone call 
or other avenues as appropriate. 
 
8 For subjects who complete single-agent maintenance nivolumab with no evidence of ≥ cTis, or who discontinue treatment early for any reason 
with no evidence of ≥ cTis, follow-up should proceed as per Table 8. For subjects with > cTis disease proceeding with cystectomy (or subjects 
with ≤ cTis disease who opt to proceed to cystectomy), subsequent follow-up should be according to Table 8. For subjects who develop cTis, 
treatment should proceed as per the treating physician.

HCRN GU16-257 
Version Date: 12AUG2021 Confidential Page 43 of 70 8. BIOSPECIMEN STUDIES AND PROCEDURES 
Tumor tissue, peripheral blood, and possibly normal urothelium will be used for biospecimen-
based research in this study. Full details of specimen collection and processing can be found in 
the CLM. Correlative studies will include genomic sequencing of tumor tissue and/or peripheral 
blood and immune monitoring studies including T cell receptor sequencing and flow cytometry 
and/or mass cytometry on tissue and/or peripheral blood, and antigen-specific T cell assays.  
Plasma will also be collected for ctDNA analyses and gene expression profiling. HLA-typi[INVESTIGATOR_478447]. Urine will also be collective for correlative analyses including but not limited to 
circulating DNA and/or cellular subsets.  
 
8.1 Tissue Collection 
 
8.1.1 Archival Tissue 
Tumor tissue obtained during the initial TURBT (i.e., prior to study enrollment) will be 
identified at screening and shipped by C2D1. Subjects without available archival tissue must be 
discussed with the sponsor-investigator. Fixed paraffin-embedded blocks/slides will be requested 
from any restaging cystoscopy/TURBTs/urothelial biopsies.  
 
8.1.[ADDRESS_614024] of care procedures (i.e., tumor and normal tissue 
obtained during restaging cystoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_478448]) or from other 
clinical evaluations (e.g., confirmation of disease progression, management of complication of 
disease progression, etc.) will be collected during this study. Specimens obtained in these 
settings may be accessed by [CONTACT_478461]. Cystectomy specimens will be collected and processed for 
FFPE and snap freezing. Samples will be shipped by [CONTACT_447]-restaging follow-up visit (for TURBT 
and/or biopsy specimens) and by [CONTACT_7620]-cystectomy visit for cystectomy specimens. Fresh 
tissue may also be collected from the procedures outlined above. 
 
8.1.3 Tissue Analysis/Genomic Sequencing 
Archival baseline TURBT tissue will be first utilized for mutation analyses by [CONTACT_478462] ( http://www.carislifesciences.com ) using the Caris Molecular 
Intelligence assay. The assay used in this study is the same assay that is commercially available 
from Caris Life Sciences and performed in the Caris CLIA, CAP, ISO [ZIP_CODE] and NY State 
accredited/certified laboratory. Therefore, results will be returned to treating physicians given the 
potential for the information to inform later lines of treatment should subjects experience disease 
progression on this protocol. However, the results of this testing will be returned after a decision 
has been made in subjects achieving a complete clinical response regarding surveillance versus

9.1 Clinical Complete Response 
 
A clinical complete response, or cT0/cTa disease, will be defined as follows: 
 
Modality Result 
Rigid 
cystoscopy  No evidence of disease or papi[INVESTIGATOR_478449] 
(if applicable)  < or = to Ta  
Urine Cytology Negative (Subjects with positive urine cytology but otherwise meeting all criteria 
for a clinical complete response may continue on single-agent nivolumab or 
surveillance as per protocol but should undergo appropriate workup as per their 
treating physicians ).  
Cross sectional 
imaging No definitive evidence of local disease as per the treating physician. Given that 
residual bladder wall thickening, or even the appearance of a mass, can be 
observed in patients with a complete pathologic response, the assessment should 
be made by [CONTACT_478465] (e.g., patients 
with residual bladder wall thickening and no evidence of malignancy on biopsies 
may be considered to have a complete clinical response). 
 
No evidence of distant metastatic disease. Equivocal lesions should be biopsied 
for confirmation if possible.  
 
 
9.9.[ADDRESS_614028] disease evaluation. 
 
9.9.4 Metastasis-Free Survival 
Metastasis-free survival is defined as the time from initiation of treatment to the development of 
metastatic disease. Confirmation of metastatic recurrence with a biopsy is recommended in all 
situations.  
 
9.9.5 Overall Survival 
Overall survival is defined as the date of initiation of treatment to date of death from any cause.

Nucleoside analogue 
 
10.3.3 Action 
Gemcitabine is metabolized intracellularly by [CONTACT_14191] 
(dFdCDP) and triphosphate (dFdCTP) nucleosides. The cytotoxic effect of gemcitabine is 
attributed to a combination of [ADDRESS_614033], gemcitabine diphosphate inhibits 
ribonucleotide reductase, which is responsible for catalyzing the reactions that generate the 
deoxynucleoside triphosphates for DNA synthesis. Inhibition of this enzyme by [CONTACT_404137] a reduction in the concentrations of deoxynucleotides, including dCTP. 
Second, gemcitabine triphosphate competes with dCTP for incorporation into DNA. The 
reduction in the intracellular concentration of dCTP (by [CONTACT_14193]) enhances 
the incorporation of gemcitabine triphosphate into DNA (self-potentiation). After the 
gemcitabine nucleotide is incorporated into DNA, only 1 additional nucleotide is added to the 
growing DNA strands. After this addition, there is inhibition of further DNA synthesis. DNA 
polymerase epsilon is unable to remove the gemcitabine nucleotide and repair the growing DNA 
strands (masked chain termination).

An AE is any untoward medical occurrence whether or not considered related to the study drug 
that appears to change in intensity during the course of the study. The following are examples of 
AEs:  
 Unintended or unfavorable sign or symptom 
 A disease temporally associated with participation in the protocol 
 An intercurrent illness or injury that impairs the well-being of the subject 
 
Abnormal laboratory values or diagnostic test results constitute AEs only if they induce clinical 
signs or symptoms or require treatment or further diagnostic tests  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_334856] (e.g., surgical insertion of 
central line) should not be recorded as an AE. Disease progression should not be recorded as an 
AE, unless it is attributable to the study regimen by [CONTACT_6962].

Clinical Study Protocol 
HCRN GU16-257 
Version Date: 12AUG2021 Confidential Page 53 of 70 12 STATISTICAL METHODS 
 
12.1 Study Design 
This is a phase 2 trial seeking to define the safety and activity of gemcitabine, cisplatin, plus 
nivolumab as neoadjuvant therapy in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer and to define 
the role of clinical complete response in predicting benefit in patients opting to avoid 
cystectomy.   
 
12.2 Endpoints 
 
12.2.1 Definition of Primary Endpoint 
Clinical complete response rate will be defined as cT0 or cTa disease after gemcitabine, 
cisplatin, plus nivolumab. Benefit from treatment will be defined as a pathologic complete 
response (<pT1) in patients undergoing cystectomy and 2 years metastasis-free in patients 
proceeding with surveillance 
 
12.2.2 Definition of Secondary Endpoints 
 Safety will be determined according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.03 
 Bladder-intact overall survival is defined as the time from initiation of treatment until 
death or cystectomy 
 Recurrence-free survival which is defined as the time from initiation of treatment to death 
or recurrence, depending on which occurs first 
 Overall survival is defined as the time from initiation of treatment to death 
 Pathologic complete response rate in patients undergoing radical cystectomy is defined as 
the proportion of patients with <pT1 
 Positive predictive value of a panel of genomic alterations in predicting benefit from 
treatment  
 
12.3 Sample Size and Power Analysis 
In our sample size justification and power analysis, we make the following assumptions.   
1. Patients without a clinical complete response (i.e, cT0 or cTa disease post-treatment) 
would not be suitable for surveillance (i.e., patients with cT0 or cTa disease will not have 
a pathologic complete response). Non clinical complete response implies no benefit.  
2. Approximately 40% of patients will have clinical complete response (though few studies 
have prospectively explored the clinical complete response rate with cisplatin-based 
chemotherapy, note that the clinical complete response rate with gemcitabine, 
carboplatin, plus paclitaxel in  was 46% in the SWOG 0219 study from carboplatin-based 
chemotherapy was 46%). 
3. Approximately 35% of patients will have a pathologic complete response (or if not 
undergoing cystectomy will be metastasis-free at 2 years). True benefit rate is around 
35% 
4. The overall prevalence of having at least one of the genomic alterations pre-specified in 
our analysis is 19%~37% per the table below.

Load Pathogenic + Presumed Pathogenic 26.6%

*Presumed benign and benign mutations excluded 
 
Our primary analysis will focus on the ability of clinical complete response (cT0 + cTa) to 
predict benefit as defined by <pT1 in patients undergoing cystectomy and 2-years metastasis-free 
in patients opting for surveillance. However, a secondary analysis will incorporate the 
association between having at least one of the biomarkers noted above and benefit as based on 
prior data, the use of the biomarker panel may increase specificity compared with clinical 
response assessment but decrease sensitivity. Then the assumption 1 basically implies that the 
negative predictive value (NPV) of clinical complete response alone is 1. Our sample size is then 
based on the confidence interval width of the positive predictive value (PPV) of clinical 
complete response alone. From our assumptions 1, 2, and 3, we have the following table (Table 
9):  
 
Table 9: Distribution of cT0 and benefit status 
  Clinical complete 
response No clinical 
complete response Total 
Benefit=”yes” 35% 0% 35% 
Benefit=”no” 5% 60% 65% 
Total 40% 60% 100% 
  
The PPV from the table is 87.5%. The sample size is generated such that the lower bound of the 
95% one-sided confidence interval exceeds 80%. Based on the formula from Steinberg et al35 
available from the “bdpv” package in the r language, a sample size of 68 satisfies this criterion. 
Assuming a 10% missing data rate (e.g. due to unmeasurable biomarker or unobservable 
outcome), we propose to recruit [ADDRESS_614035] whether the presence of alternations in the prespecified panel of genomic biomarkers (which 
we name [CONTACT_478474]+) is associated with benefit among patients achieving a clinical complete 
response. With 68 patients, we assume 28 will achieve a clinical complete response. Now based 
on preliminary results of the biomarker association (Table 3 in Section 1.4), we assume 90% of 
the biomarker+ patients will achieve a clinical complete response. Assuming also that at least 
90% of the biomarker+ and clinical complete response patients will have benefit=”yes”, the 
power levels based on the Fisher’s exact test (with type I error of 0.05) range from 0.39 to 0.92 
when the overall prevalence of being biomarker+ goes from 19% to 37%. The two extreme cases 
are listed in the following two tables (Tables 10 and 11).

response and benefit will also be calculated.

Toxicity rates will be summarized using frequency tables. Time to event outcomes (i.e. local

using the Kaplan-Meier method. Pathologic complete response rate in patients undergoing 
radical cystectomy will be summarized using frequency tables. PPV (and sensitivity and 
specificity) of the panel of genomic alterations in predicting benefit from treatment will also be 
analyzed.

12.5 Interim Analysis/Criteria for Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_478450].  
1. The first is for excessive immune-related Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_614040] to immune-related Grade ≥ 3 
adverse events. Two-sided 95% exact binomial confidence intervals (CIs) of these Grade ≥ 3 
immune-related adverse event rates will be constructed. If their lower bounds exceed 3%, the 
study drug will be considered unacceptably toxic for this patient population and enrollment will 
be halted. The 3% is chosen based on the toxicity profile of single agent PD-1 or PD-L1 
blockade in patients with urothelial cancer.24,36 This corresponds to ≥ 2+ (2 or more) out of 7, ≥ 
3+ (3 or more) out of 14, and ≥ 3+ out of [ADDRESS_614041] stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_478451], and excessive muscle-invasive 
bladder cancer recurrence and/or metastatic recurrence would be of concern. We will stop the 
trial if we are confident that either the muscle-invasive local recurrence rate or the metastatic 
recurrence rate exceed 30%.13 Two-sided 95% exact binomial confidence intervals (CIs) of this 
recurrence rate will be constructed. If their lower bounds exceed 30%, enrollment will be halted. 
This corresponds to 5 out of 5, ≥ 7+ (7 or more) out of 10, ≥ 9+ out of 15 subjects, and ≥ 11+ out 
of 20 subjects.

14.1 Data Management 
HCRN will serve as the Clinical Research Organization for this trial. Data will be collected 
through a web based clinical research platform, a system compliant with Good Clinical Practices 
and Federal Rules and Regulations.  HCRN personnel will coordinate and manage data for 
quality control assurance and integrity. All data will be collected and entered into the EDC 
system by [CONTACT_328808].   
 
14.2 Case Report Forms and Submission 
Generally, clinical data will be electronically captured in the EDC system and correlative results 
will be captured in the EDC system or other secure database(s). If procedures on the study 
calendar are performed for standard of care, at minimum, that data will be captured in the source 
document. Select standard of care data will also be captured in the EDC system, according to 
study-specific objectives.  
 
The completed dataset is the sole property of the sponsor-investigator’s institution and should 
not be exported to third parties, except for authorized representatives of appropriate 
Health/Regulatory Authorities, without permission from the sponsor-investigator and HCRN. 
 
14.[ADDRESS_614044] Retention 
To enable evaluations and/or audits from Health Authorities/HCRN, the site investigator agrees 
to keep records, including the identity of all subjects (sufficient information to link records; e.g., 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed informed consent forms, copi[INVESTIGATOR_129299], and 
detailed records of drug disposition. All source documents are to remain in the subject’s file and 
retained by [CONTACT_478468].  No records 
will be destroyed until HCRN confirms destruction is permitted. 
 
14.[ADDRESS_614045] information. All records identifying the 
subjects will be kept confidential and, to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_29695]/or 
regulations, will not be made publicly available. Information collected will be maintained on 
secure, password protected electronic systems. Paper files that contain personal information will 
be kept in locked and secure locations only accessible to the study site personnel.  
 
Subjects will be informed in writing that some organizations including the sponsor-investigator 
and his/her research associates, HCRN, Bristol-Myers Squibb’s, IRB, or government agencies, 
like the FDA, may inspect their medical records to verify the information collected, and that all 
personal information made available for inspection will be handled in strictest confidence and in 
accordance with local data protection laws. 
 
If the results of the study are published, the subject’s identity will remain confidential.

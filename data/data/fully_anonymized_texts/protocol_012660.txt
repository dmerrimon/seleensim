 1 CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_839901] (HF), there remains  substantial residual 
morbidity and mortality. Even with  insights into diverse mechanisms of myocardial dysfunction, virtually all 
current medical treatment is focused on  modulating  the “neurohormonal axis”. Our project extends the se 
principles  to an emerging frontier , the ketone “metabolic axis” , as a means of ameliorating symptoms through 
exogenous delivery of a ketone ester. In this pharmacokinetic study, we first seek to find the optimal dose of a 
ketone ester product. We will subsequently use this information to inform dosing for a randomized trial of 
ketone therapy in HF.  
 
2 SPECIFIC AIMS  
HF is a major public health problem: it affects 6.2 million people in the U.S.1 The lifetime risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_839902] 40 years approaches 20%,2 and five -year survival after HF hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2138] a dismal 35 %.[ADDRESS_1167363] been 
described in both HFrEF .5 Targeting the metabolic axis in HF therefore may hold great therapeutic promise.  
 
Under physiol ogic conditions, fatty acids are the predominant energetic substrate for the heart, providing 50 -
70% of the ATP need . Glucose  serves as a secondary source , necessary for flexibility and adaptive fuel 
utilization shifts during embryologic development and during a diverse array of nutritional and physiologic 
conditions.6, [ADDRESS_1167364] a unique opportunity to study a ketone ester (KE) , (R)-3-hydroxybutyl (R) -3-hydroxybutyrate  
(commercially known as “DeltaG”) , that provides systemic ketosis  in a deep phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_839903] .[ADDRESS_1167365]. As patients may be 
taking minimally ketogenic medications (SGLT2 inhibitors), we will study the pharmacokinetic effects of ketone 
ester with patients on, and not on, these medi cations.  
 
Our Specific Aim s are as follows:  
 
Aim 1. To assess the pharmacokinetics and safety of ketone ester in patients on, and not on, SGLT2 
inhibitors. We will perform serial peripheral blood sampling to understand the effects of acute ketone ester on 
pH, glucose, systolic blood pressure, and ketone levels to find an optimal dose of the product.

 Aim 2. To assess the effects of KE on metabolomics, proteomics, and systemic biomarkers (pending 
sufficient funding).  
  
3 BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
HF affects 6.2 million Americans and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality in the contemporary 
era.1 By 2030, the burden of HF is anticipated to  surpass 8 million with an associated economic toll of a 
staggering $69.8 billion .1 The cardinal clinical feature of  patients with HF is reduced  exercise capacity, which is 
associ ated with a substantial reduction  in quality of life.11 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_839904],  particularly among those with reduced ejection fraction (EF),  many still suffer from limitations 
in exercise capacity  and a poor prognosis . As such, exploring other avenu es to reduce morbidity from HF is of 
vital interest from  societal, economic, clinical,  and patient -centered perspectives .  
Recently, several alterations in the cardiac metabolism of patients with HF  have been described , setting  the 
stage for randomized trials of novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_839905] .4, 7, 8 Among healthy 
individuals, the heart , a very metabolically active organ,  uses a combination of free fatty acids  and glucose (to 
a lesser extent)  as the primary sources  of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP) production. However, free fatty acid 
oxidation is impaired in the failing heart, and the heart increases its use of ketone bodies for fuel.7  
Ketone bodies  (acetoacetate, β -hydroxybutyrate [BHB], and acetone)  are water -soluble molecules produced 
from acetyl -CoA following  breakdown of fatty acids  (and amino acids) mainly in hepatic cells. Ketone bodies 
are typi[INVESTIGATOR_90105], but are produced continuously during 
metabolic stress conditions and/or periods of carbohydrate deprivation such as acute medical stress, 
prolonged exercise , or starvation,  and become  a key source of energy to vital organs including the brain and 
heart under th ese circumstances.12 Ketone production has long been teleologically considered as a means to 
provide the brain with an efficient, alternative fuel source  during starvation, sparing carbohydrate and protein 
stores, since the brain cannot effectively metabolize free fatty acids  (which represent 99% of the body’s energy 
stores ).12, [ADDRESS_1167366] a respi[INVESTIGATOR_839906] (acetoacetate = 1.0, BHB = 0.89)  and produce greater amounts of ATP,  releasing approximately 30% 
more energy per molecule than pyruvate.14, [ADDRESS_1167367] been treated, or are under study , with ketone therapy, such as epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], Parkinson’s disease, 
and Alzheimer’s disease.16  
Macronutrient resources (low glucose, high free fatty acids) and hormonal signaling (low insulin, high glucagon, 
high cortisol) are the primary methods of regulating ketone production, and thus dietary modification has been 
studied extensively to treat these conditions (the “ketogenic diet”).  Adherence to this diet, however,  can be 
challenging,  and may also be accompanied by [CONTACT_90124][INVESTIGATOR_035]  (due to increased flux of free fatty acids) , impaired 
cardiac metabolism,  or gastro -intestinal upset,  leading to interest in  alternative exogenous modes of delivery.17, 
18 Exogenous delivery of ketones holds several advantages over dietary modification  such as increased 
compliance, lack of alteration on other fuel stores (such as intramuscular glycogen) , and its unique effect of 
lower ing both  glucose and free fatty acids due to  negative feedback on lipolysis.[ADDRESS_1167368] been studied, including ketone salts and KE. Oral k etone 
salts result in a high amount of salt intake (which may be problematic for patients with HF)  and results in half  
the plasma concentration of D -betahydroxybutyrate (D -BHB).17 A novel KE compound, I-3-hydroxybut I(R)-3-
hydroxybutyrate  (DeltaG) , has been extensively studied for the purposes of therapeutic exogenous ketosis and 
is approved as a nutraceutical by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA).9, 10, 17, 20 -23 Advantages of DeltaG 
consumption include a  rapid rise of blood levels of BHB in humans  to ~3 mmol/L  within 60 minutes of 
consumption  with moderate doses of  KE, equivalent to a week of fasting , which is markedly increased from the 
levels of detectable ketones in normal populations (<0.5 mmol/L).9, 17, [ADDRESS_1167369] of comparison, a carbohydrate -

 restricted (high -fat) diet typi[INVESTIGATOR_90107], with BHB levels of  0.5 mmol/L, which is 
currently considered as an accepted definition of ketosis.[ADDRESS_1167370] clinical benef it, such as in HF.10  
 
Further data has emerged regarding potential benefits of intravenous infusions of sodium -3-hydroxybutyrate.25 
In a crossover study of 16 patients with HF and reduced EF (HFrEF) randomized to 6 hours of ketone infusion 
vs. isotonic saline (placebo arm),  infusion of the ketone increased cardiac output by 2 L/min with an absolute 
improvement in left ventricular EF of 8%. Notably, the hemodynamic effects of ketones were dose -dependent 
and detectable  even  in the physiological concentration range.  While important, this trial was limited by [CONTACT_839909] (impractical for the outpatient management ) and concerns related to salt infusion , such 
as pH disturbances and sodium loading. In addition, this trial did not assess patient -centered metrics, such as 
exercise capacity, which is an important determinant of quality of life in HF.[ADDRESS_1167371] that 
intravenous ketone therapy  increase d cardiac output to this extent support s the hypothesis that there is a 
fundamental limitation of fuel utilization in HF  that can be therapeutically targeted . In addition, recent data 
shows important improvements in cardiac output and function without significant safety concerns in patients 
with cardiogenic shock at 500 mg/kg of the KE.[ADDRESS_1167372] study, we  seek  to determine whether the optimal dose of a liquid  ketone ester drink  in patients on, 
and not on, SGLT2 inhibitors.  
 
4 Published Data on K etone Ester 
DeltaG is a  ketone ester (KE) that undergoes complete enzymatic hydrolysis to form BHB (and R -1,3-
butanediol) by [CONTACT_90128], including within the gastrointestinal tract, liver , and blood. 
R-1,3-butanediol, itself, is further metabolized in the liver by [CONTACT_22705] -pass metabolism and blood to produce BHB 
by [CONTACT_90129]. BHB undergoes further metabolism to acetoacetate 
and acetone, though only BHB an d acetoacetate are taken up by [CONTACT_839910] a s energy sources.  
 
KE is eliminated through at least first order kinetics and capacity limited elimination. Elimination is 
accomplished via 3 predominant means, including  (1) conversion to acetone and lung exhalation, (2) renal 
elimination (of BHB and acetoacetate, though this contribution is negligible particularly during exercise), and 
(3) uptake by [CONTACT_839911].10, 21  
 
Concentrations of the KE compound of roughly  3-5 mmol/L are reached within [ADDRESS_1167373] levels of administration (714 mg/kg).9, [ADDRESS_1167374] for IND exemption:  We believe this study qualifies under the criteria for IND exemption. DeltaG has 
been granted GRAS  status through the FDA as a food, and the GRAS documentation will be separately 
submitted . We believe this study is exempt from the IND requirements because it meets the conditions of FDA 
guidance (sections VI.D.1 & VI.D.2). Specifically, DeltaG, as used in this study, is not intended for use “in the 
diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or pr evention of disease”. As DeltaG is only received on one study date 
as an acute study,  and endpoints assessed here are for safety, we believe the use of DeltaG fulfills these 
critiera here. Participants will be no tified in the ICF specifically that they will not benefit as a result of 
participating in the study. The intent of the study is to describe the acute effect of DeltaG (a food)  on venous 
pH, glucose, and blood pressure as a safety mechanism . In addition, the results of this study are not intended 
to affect the marketing or labeling of DeltaG.  
We have previously performed research with this compound at another institution in patients with heart failure , 
who have given IND exemption for the use of ketone ester. This letter has also been submitted.  
 
5 Research Design and Methods  
Overview:  We first begin with a pharmacokinetic study to establish dosing among 20 HF participants.

mellitus , and others.  
5. Vital signs: height, weight, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure , oxygen 
saturation, and others  
6. Medications will be obtained from the medical chart  and confirmed with the participant .  
 
 
5.3 Pharmacokinetic study :  
SGLT2i are standard -of-care ketogenic medications in HFrEF that minimally raise ketone levels though 
still well within normal limits (0.10mM to 0.13mM , normal <~0.5mM ) through reducing insulin:glucagon 
ratio.29, 30 Since exogenous ketones increase  this ratio as shown in our previous work31 and reduce  
endogenous ketosis, the combination of exogenous ketones and SGLT2i is not expected to perpetuate 
ketoacidosis risk by [CONTACT_23265]2i (which has not been a significant concern  in clinical trials of HFrEF ).[ADDRESS_1167376] ketosis by [CONTACT_839913] (1 study  showed a pH 
decrease  of 0.10 to an arterial pH of 7.31 after the ketone drink  as an expected change ).[ADDRESS_1167377] perform a dose -finding study  in 10 HFrEF participants on SGLT2i and 10 not 
on SGLT2i to assess safety ( Table 1 ). We will measure venous pH, glucose, blood pressure, and BHB 
every 60 minutes for 4 hours . After a standardized meal  containing carbohydrate  (to limit endogenous 
ketosis), we will assess 5 participants in each stratum using 250 mg/kg to initially target BHB levels ~1 -
2 mmol/L , and then dose escalate to 500 mg/kg for 5 participants27 which is predicted  to achieve BHB 
levels ~3 mmol/L (safely achieved in HF patients previously with KE34 without inducing significant side 
effects including mild acidosis).9, 28, 35, [ADDRESS_1167378] 500 mg/kg 
given increasing risk for gastrointestinal symptoms.9, 37

Timepoints delinated here are approximate. We aim to draw blood as close to the timeline outlined 
here, but +/ - 15 minutes from the timepoint is considered acceptable without deviation. Likewise, lack of 
blood draws at times not used for endpoint assessmen t will not be considered a deviation.  
 
We preferentially enroll unique patients in this study (i.e. 20 different patients). However, in the event of 
difficult enrollment in the “no SGLT2i arm ”, participants  currently taking an SGLT2i  may enroll and hold 
the SGLT2i for at least 4 days (with the permission of their treating physician). This amount of time is 
similar to what is advised prior to some procedures (i.e. surgery). Therefore, participants could enroll 
twice in this study (in each arm).  
 
A total of ~100 mL of blood will be obtained at this visit.  
Blood samples will be stored (either within the Duke Heart Center or the Duke Molecular Physiology Institute) 
at -80C f or later analysis . We may perform routine blood testing (metabolic panels, blood counts), 
comprehensive metabolomic /proteomic profiling from this peripheral blood , as well as  other biomarkers, in 
addition to other testing , pending sufficient funding .  
 
6 Risks and Safety Assessment  
Ketone Ester: This proposal includes a ketone ester which is commercially available and has been granted 
“Generally Regarded as Safe ” (GRAS) status from the FDA. This KE undergoes complete enzymatic 
hydrolysis to form BHB (and R -1,3-butanediol) by [CONTACT_90128], including the 
gastrointestinal tract, liver and blood. R -1,3-butanediol, itself, is further metabolized i n the liver and blood to 
produce BHB.  The TMax ranges from ~1 -3 hours. Elimination is accomplished via conversion to acetone and 
lung exhalation, renal elimination, and uptake by [CONTACT_839914] (including the brain, 
heart, kidney, and skeletal muscles).10, 21 We exclude participants both with a history of significant renal 
impairment (eGFR < 25 ml/min/m2) or hepatic impairment (history of cirrhosis,  alcohol abuse ). Peak 
concentrations of KE are reached around  60 minutes at doses anticipated to be administered here.9, 10 The 
half-life of BHB from the compound is 0.8 -3.1 hours.9 Adverse effects are infrequent and dose -dependent; 
gastrointestinal distress occurs at the highest levels of administration (714 mg/kg), consistent with our own 
experience.9, 28 No clinically significant changes in vital signs, lipid levels, blood counts, renal function, and 
urinalysis parameters were observed at doses similar to those studied here. Participants may be on SGLT2i 
which are minimally ketogenic medications in themselves with minimal  risk for ketoacidosis in HF.32 As outlined 
in this section, it is not anticipated that the KE will amplify risk of ketoacidosis with SGLT2i given the differing 
biologies of endogenous versus exogenous ketosis. However, this potential risk will be outlined to participants 
who enroll in this study. Dose:  In this proposal, we will perform a pharmacokinetic study to determine optimal 
dose without significant safety concerns which will be explored in our pharmacokinetic study.  Our product is 
purchased commercially as “DeltaG” (TdeltaS, Orla ndo, FL). We have administered these doses proposed 
here to 15 HFpEF patients  in an ongoing study  without significant adverse events related to the nutraceutical. 
We will monitor for any adverse events throughout the study visit. The compound half -life is short as indicated 
above. To aid intolerability, participants are served a light meal. In addition, water (which may be naturally 
flavored and/or carbonated) is freely permitted.

Phlebotomy and blood draws:  We leverage  healthcare professionals who have  experience in blood draws 
and maintaining venous catheters  in our study . Risks from the peripheral (e.g. antecubital fossa) venous 
catheterization include minor discomfort, minor bruising, bleeding, hematoma and/or fainting associated with 
the drawing of blood. There is also a very small chance (less than 1%) of infection at the blood draw site. The 
amount of blood to be drawn during each study is modest  (100 mL).  
 
[ADDRESS_1167382] be summarized using means (standard deviations), medians (interquartile 
range), and counts (percentages) as appropriate for the type of variable and its distribution. We will plot summary 
estimates of venous pH, glucose, ketone levels, and systolic blood pressure over time, overall and stratified by 
[CONTACT_23265]2 i use and ketone ester dose . We will compare whether achieved venous pH, glucose, ketone levels, and 
systolic blood pressure vary by [CONTACT_839915]2i use, accounting for related baseline measurement s. Sensitivity 
analysis will adjust for age, sex, ketone ester dose, eGFR , and hemoglobin a1c (if available) . Repeated measures 
techniques (accounting for clustering at the level of the participants) may be used to assess overall changes in pH, 
ketone levels, systolic blood pressure, and glucose. We will describe peak ketone concentrations achieved by [INVESTIGATOR_216].  
Similarly, we will assess the relationship between peak ketone levels (dependent variable) and dose of KE 
(independent va riable). P<0.[ADDRESS_1167383] CW, Carson AP, Chamberlain AM,

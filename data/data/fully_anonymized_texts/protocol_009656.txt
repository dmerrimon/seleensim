Abatacept Acute GVHD Phase II Trial Version 1/30/2019 
 
 5 Study Synopsis  
 
 
Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_96371] S. Kean, MD, PhD  
 
Study design:   This is a multicenter phase II trial with two strata: a randomized, double blind, 
placebo- controlled stratum (stratum 1) for patients receiving transplants from 8 of 8 HLA 
matched unrelated donors and a single arm stratum (stratum 2) for patients receiving 
transplants from 7 of 8 matched donors.  
 
Primary Objective:  To determine the impact that abatacept will make on the incidence of early , 
severe acute GVHD  (aGvHD) , when it is added to a standard GvHD prophylaxis regimen during 
unrelated- donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)  for patients with hematologic 
malignanc ies.  
 
Secondary Objective:   To characterize the impact of abatacept on the post-transplant 
reconstitution of anti -viral protective immunity . 
 
Eligibility Cr iteria:  Eligible patients will be at least [ADDRESS_1034992] an unrelated bone marrow or 
peripheral blood stem cell donor who is HLA -matched at no less than seven of eight loci (A, B, C, 
DRB1).  Th is may be an allele or antigen mismatch.  
 
Treatment Description:   Patients will receive intensive pre- transplant conditioning .  Those 
receiving transplants from [ADDRESS_1034993] aGVHD 
prophylaxis (placebo, calcineurin inhibitor, and short -course methotrexate) or investigational 
prophylaxis (abatacept, calcineurin inhibitor and short -course methotrexate) , while those 
receiving transplants from 7 of 8 matched donors will all be assigned to receive the investigational 
prophylaxis.  
 
Accrual Objective:   40 non -randomized 7/8 HLA matched patients and 1 40 randomized 8/8 HLA 
matched  patients will be accrued to this study.  
 
Accrual Period:   The estimated accrual period is 4 years.

Abatacept Acute GVHD Phase II Trial Version 1/30/2019 
 
 7 1. Hypothesis and Aims: This trial is being conducted as a step toward testing the long -term 
hypothesis that the costimulation blockade agent abatacept can be added to a standard 
acute graft -versus -host disease (aGvHD) prophylaxis regimen  (which includes a calcineurin 
inhibitor  (CNI)  and methotrexate) , to improve disease- free survival after unrelated donor 
(URD) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for patients with hematologic 
malignancies.  As a phase II study, the overall aim of this trial is to make a preliminary 
assessment of abatacept’s clinical safety and efficacy using short -term outcomes.  Thus, this 
trial is designed to test two hypotheses:   
 
(1) A primary hypothesis that the addition of abatacept to calcineurin inhibition + 
methotrexate can decrease the incidence of early -onset (before day [ADDRESS_1034996] -transplant) 
Gr III- IV aGVHD in HLA 8/8 matched- unrelated donor transplants and Gr II I-IV aGVHD 
in HLA 7/8 mismatched -unrelated donor transplants.  
(2) A secondary hypothesis that its addition will not hinder post -transplant reconstitution of 
protective immunity against latent viruses.  
 
To test these two hypotheses , this study will have the  following Specific Aims . 
Specific Aim #1:  To conduct a multicenter p hase II trial  to assess the impact of abatacept 
on the incidence of aGVHD and its biology. We will compare investigational GVHD 
prophylaxis, abatacept combined with a CNI and methotrexate, to standard GVHD 
prophylaxis, a CNI and methotrexate alone  in two patient strata.  Patients receiving an 8/[ADDRESS_1034997]  (stratum 1) will be randomly assigned to the investigational 
regimen or the standard regimen; all patients receiving  7/[ADDRESS_1034998]  (stratum 2) 
will be assigned to the investigational regimen  and be compared to a historical 7/[ADDRESS_1034999] control group drawn from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Research 
(CIBMTR)  registry . In both strata, c orrelative immunology studies will be performed to 
elucidate abatacept’s effects on the graft -versus-host response.  
Specific Aim #2:  To assess the impact of abatacept on post -transplant reconstitution of 
protective immunity against viruses. This will involve monitoring the longitudinal recovery of 
lymphocyte subsets and virus -specific immunity, usi ng tetramer analysis and viral 
stimulation assays. It will also involve monitoring viral infection and disease.  
 
2. Background and Rationale:   
 
The Unmet Need:   Allogeneic HSCT is an effective treatment for aggressive leukemias and 
other hematological malignancies, often representing the only option for cure.  However, some 
of its benefit, especially in the case of unrelated donor transplantation, is off -set by a high rate of 
transplant -related mortality (approximately 30% of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_756284] -related complications) stemming largely from severe aGVHD and infection.  
1-[ADDRESS_1035000] common targets.  aGvHD -mediated damage to these 
vital organs can result in significant morbidity, and in death.  While whole- scale T cell depletion 
of the allograft can successfully reduce rates of aGvHD, patients rec eiving T cell- depleted grafts 
exhibit profound defects in protective immunity, and often die of infection or relapse of their 
primary disease.10-12 This has created an unmet clinical need for a strategy that more effectively 
prevents severe aGvHD while preserving the transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s protective immune response.  
 
Abatacept Acute GVHD Phase II Trial Version 1/30/2019 
 
 8 Targeting T cell costimulation to prevent aGvHD: The immune activation observed in aGvHD 
bears close resemblance to the immune activation that occurs during both organ rejection and 
autoimmunity. Studies  in these diseases have led to the development of a new class of agents, 
called ‘costimulatio n blockade’ reagents, which specifically target activated T cells and block 
their ability to become fully activated effector cells.  [ADDRESS_1035001] studied of the 
costimulatory pathways is the CD28: CD80/86 receptor:coreceptor interaction.[ADDRESS_1035002] has been accomplished, and has demonstrated the efficacy of inhibition of 
CD28 :CD80/[ADDRESS_1035003] CD80/86 -
directed costimulation blockade agent, CTLA4Ig, or ‘abatacept,’ is approved for use in 
rheumatoid arthritis, both in adults and in children older than 6 years.15-18 The experience with 
abatacept from 3 large randomized, placebo- controlled clinical trials, two in adults with 
rheumat oid arthritis and one in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (ages 6 and older) 
indicates that it is a safe agent.19-21 In these three trials, abatacept  was dosed at 10 mg/kg and 
was administered IV on day 1, 15, 29 (one trial used day 30) and then every [ADDRESS_1035004] patients  also received weekly, oral, low -
dose methotrexate and low dose prednisone concurrently. In these trials, abatacept was well 
tolerated.  Acutely, infusional reactions were rare and mild and occurred at rates that did not 
differ significantly from those wit h placebo. Abatacept was not associated with any hematologic, 
renal, cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic or neurologic abnormalities. Similarly, the rates of both total 
and s erious  adverse events were low, and did not differ from those with placebo. Abatacept has 
been shown to be safe, even in extended open label trials,22,23 not associated with excessive 
PTLD or other malignancies . 22-25 However, chronically -treated patients did experience a slightly 
higher risk of infections. 22,24,25 
 Phase III studies of a second- generation, higher avidity  abatacept analog, belatacept 
(which is identical to abatacept except for two amino acid substitutions) have demonstrated 
efficacy in preventing renal transplant rejection. 26,27 Patients who received 10mg/kg of 
belatacept on days 1, 5, 14, 28, and every [ADDRESS_1035005] led to the FDA approval of belatacept for a renal transplant indication .  While overall rates 
of patient death, infection and serious infection in patients receiving belatacept were not 
different than in those receiving traditional immunosuppression,26,28 belatacept was associated 
with a statistically -significant increased rate of EBV -associated PTLD compared to cyclosporine-
based immunosuppression (especially in patients that were EBV sero- negativ e prior to 
transplant).26,[ADDRESS_1035006]-in-disease feasibility trial  of 
abatacept for GvHD prevention (Clinical Trials.org #[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). This trial, which has now 
completed enrollment, has documented encouraging early results with respect to both the safety 
and efficacy of  abatacept for GvHD prevention (Kean et al., ASH 2011 , Koura et al., ASH 2012  
Abatacept Acute GVHD Phase II Trial Version 1/30/2019 
 
 9 and 57).  These results have led to the creation of the current Phase II clinical trial of abatacept 
for prevention of severe aGvHD.  The current trial uses the same dosing schedule as was 
implemented in the Abatacept Feasibility Study57 with the goal of gaining an initial assessment 
of relative efficacy, comparing standard tacrolimus/methotrexate GVHD prophylaxis with 
tacrolimus/methotrexate/abatacept prophylaxis.  
 
  
3.     Research Design and Methods  
 
3.1.  Study Design:  This is a multicenter phase II trial with two strata: a randomized, double 
blind, placebo- controlled stratum (stratum 1) for patients receiving transplants from 8 of 8 HLA 
matched unrelated donors and a single arm stratum (stratum 2) for patients receiving 
transplants from [ADDRESS_1035007] Recruitment and Selection:  Patients will be recruited from 
the Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, the 
Emory University  Adult Blood and Marrow Transplant Program , the University of [LOCATION_012] Adult 
Blood and Marrow Transplant Program , the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA) , and from 
participating centers in the Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplant Consortium (PBMTC). A 
total of 40 non-randomized 7/8 HLA matched patients and 140 8/8 HLA matched patients will 
be enrolled on this study.  Patients who are enrolled, but determined to be Assignment Failures 
before receiving study drug/placebo will be replaced. 7/8 HLA matched patients enrolled prior 
to Protocol Amendment 4 and who were randomized to the study drug/placebo arm are not 
counted in either group of 40 or 140.  
 
3.3.   Patient Eligibility, Enrollment and Treatment Assignment:  
 
a) Enrollment: All forms for this trial will be completed online, using the REDCap 
system. Secure REDCap access will be established for each site after IRB approval 
by [CONTACT_756345] . Patients will then be enrolled by [CONTACT_756346]. If online access is not available, the 
form may also be submitted by e- mailing or faxing the study coordinator . In addition 
to the enrollment form, the supporting source documents shall  also be sent to the 
study coordinator via email or fax.  She will confirm eligibility and assign a subject 
number.  
 
b) Assignment : After enrollment, patients r eceiving 8/[ADDRESS_1035008] transplants 
(stratum 1) will be randomly assigned to the standard GVHD prophylaxis arm or to the 
investigational abatacept arm of the trial. The study statistician will perform the 
randomization.  He will convey  the randomization to the central research pharmacist 
at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta/Emory University , who, in turn, will convey the 
information  to the treating center’s investigational pharmacist . Patients receiving 7/8 
matched transplants (stratum 2) wil l be assigned to receive investigational therapy. 
Study drug with appropriate labeling for patients assigned to receive abatacept will 
then be delivered to the treating center’s investigational pharmacy.  
 
c) Blinding:  For the 8/8 matched group (stratum 1) t he study statistician, the central 
research pharmacist, the  treating center research pharmacist , the study monitors and 
members of the PBMTC DSMC will not be blinded. All participating patients, their 
families, all medical providers, and all i nvestigators and study personnel other than 
Abatacept Acute GVHD Phase II Trial Version 1/30/2019 
 
 10 those listed above will be blinded to treatment assignment  .  Other persons may be 
unblinded at the discretion of the DSM C.    
 
d) Inclusion Criteria:  
(1) Must be at least 6 years old and weigh 20 kg.  
(2) Must have a willing unrelated adult donor (bone marrow or peripheral blood) . 
Donors may have a single mismatch (i.e. be a 7/8) and this mismatch may be at 
the allele or antigen level; however, donors with allele level disparity should be 
given preference over those wi th antigen level disparity. The use of mismatched 
donors in which disparity is only in the host versus graft direction (because 
of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_756285]) is discouraged because of the potentially  
heightened risk for graft rejection. Centers may perform extended typi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 
(e.g. DQB1 and DPB1) according to institutional  practices and use these 
results in selecting donors; however, it is recommended that this extending 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_756286] A, B, C and DRB1.  
(3) All patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed 
consent. Assent, when appropriate, will be obtained according to institutional 
guidelines.  
Must have a high risk hematologic malignancy as defined below . If the patient does not meet 
defined eligibility requirem ents as stipulated below, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_756287] . 
 (a)  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML).  
(i)  Patients  with AML in the first complete remission (CR) with intermediate or high risk 
disease.   
(ii)   Patients with AML in f irst CR with high -risk disease as defined by [CONTACT_756347]. CR is defined as an M1 marrow (<5% blasts  by [CONTACT_5293] ), no evi dence of 
extramedullary disease, and an absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.0 x 109/L. Cases where the 
ANC is < 1.0 x 109/L and rising will also be considered.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_756288] e such 
cases for enrollment. Complete remissions without platelet recovery (CRp) will be considered 
complete remissions.  
Indicators of High- risk Disease are as follows:  
1.        Flt3/ITD+ (If quantitative testing was performed, the   allelic ratio  must be >0.4)  
2.             Residual marrow disease (≥0.1%)  detected by [CONTACT_756348].  
3.           Secondary AML.  If the AML is secondary to treatment for another malignancy, the 
first malignancy must be in a complete remission.  
4.             High -Risk cytogenetic abnormalities:  Different  high-risk cytogenetic criteria have 
been defined for adult and pediatric AML. We will, therefore, use two sets of cytogenetic 
criteria, one based on Children’s Oncology Group (COG) criteria for pediatric patients and 
one based on Southwestern Oncology Group (SWOG)/Eastern Oncology Group (ECOG)  or 
MRC  criteria for adult patients.  
Examples of high- risk cytogenetics:  
a.    Adult patients (≥21 years):  
i.        -5/del (5q)  
ii.       -7/del (7q)

f)   Co-enrollment on other studies:   
 
Patients who are currently enrolled and being treated on a cooperative group or local study for 
newly diagnosed or relapsed hematologic malignancies will be eligible for this phase II trial of 
abatacept if the patient otherwise meets  eligibility criteria for the abatacept  study and the 
patients’ participation in the first trial does not in any way interfere with the administration of the 
therapy, clinical testing or research testing dictated by [CONTACT_756355]. When seeking to 
enroll patients on this abatacept study, centers must indicate any and all studies that the 
patients are currently enrolled on.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_756293] e will review this 
information  before the patient is approved for  enrollment.  
 
Patients who are not currently enrolled on another study but who seek to enroll in another trial 
(either while they  enroll on the abatacept trial or after they enroll on the abatacept trial) must be 
granted permission by [CONTACT_756356].  In general, trials of supportive 
care interventions, of treatments designed to prevent relapse or of other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_756294], clinical testing or 
resear ch testing dictated by [CONTACT_756357]. Participation in trials of agents that are likely 
to influence risk for GVHD and, therefore, interfere with our ability to assess the primary 
endpoint of this trial , will not be allowed. Similarly, participat ion in trials of agents that may 
increase the risks of participating in this trial of abatacept wil l not be allowed. In general, 
Abatacept Acute GVHD Phase II Trial Version 1/30/2019 
 
 16 participation in observational studies will be permitted unless they add signif icantly to research 
blood draws .

 25 Sample Acquisition :  Considering all of the research lab assays together, samples will need to 
be obtained on the following days as described below. Please note that  if, in addition to study -
specific blood draws, a CBC with differential, and a comprehensive chemistry panel will  be 
drawn,  these routine, standard- of-care labs  should be drawn at the same time as the study -
specific blood draws whe n possible.   
 
Hematopoietic Stem Cell Product (at the time of harvest/collection):   For all enrolled 
patients, the empty bag or syringe in which the stem cell product was infused will be retrieved 
by [CONTACT_756361].  In addition, i f the donor has previously given 
consent, 5cc of the harvested marrow or PBSC graft will be withdrawn from the bone marrow or 
PBSC graft at the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_756302] (prior to infusion of the stem cell product into the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]) 
and sent to the Central Reference Laboratory for analysis of graft content.   
 
Donors ( drawn within [ADDRESS_1035026]/collection):  Please note that donors have the 
option of consenting to a blood draw at the time of stem cell harvest.  However, the participation 
of the donor in this blood draw  or in the donation of the 5cc of harv ested marrow or PBSC graft  
is not a requirement for recipi[INVESTIGATOR_756303].  Total blood draw:  <  40.5 cc (less 
than 3 tablespoons of blood).  The total blood draw shall be collected as follows:  24cc into large 
(8cc) CPT tubes, 4cc into a cyto-chex tube, 5cc into a plasma preparation tube , and 5cc into a 
Red top serum tube. If the donor is harvested for a recipi[INVESTIGATOR_756304] >50 Kg, then an 
additional 2.5cc will be drawn into a PAXgene tube.  If, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_021], it 
is not in the patient’s best interest to remove the 5cc of harvested marrow or PBSC, they may 
choose not to remove this part of the product.  
 
Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]:  Please note that while there is some latitude in the timing for many of the blood 
draws, the timing for  the majority of the blood draws on days of abatacept administration is 
strict.  The blood draws on recipi[INVESTIGATOR_756305] < 1.95cc/kg for 
any 28- day period.

Sample Collection and Processing Instructions   
 
A. Donor Blood Samples:  
 
All donor samples (collected as stipulated above: 24cc into large (8cc) CPT tubes, 4cc into a 
cyto-chex tube, 5cc into a plasma preparation tube, 5cc into a Red top serum tube and  2.5cc 
into a PAXgene tube) will be shipped without further processing at ambient temperature to the 
Central Laboratory  on the same day that they are drawn.  
 
B. Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_29038]:   
 
1.  Collection and shipment of Whole Blood using Cyto- Chex BCT Tubes:  
 
Cyto-Chex BCT is a blood collection tube for the preservation of whole blood samples for 
immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_442313]. Cell morphology and surface markers are maintained in 
these tubes for up to [ADDRESS_1035046] 
venipuncture technique  (See Section 3.7.3 for Blood Draw Volumes based on weight). .  
2. Immediately mix the collected tube by [CONTACT_5237] 8- 10 times.  
3. Label the tube .  
 
4. Collected blood shall be shipped WITHOUT CENTRIFUGATION by [CONTACT_756363] .  
 
2 .Collection and Processing of PAXgene Tubes:  
 
 1.Ensure that the PAXgene RNA tube is at [ADDRESS_1035047] tube drawn in the phlebotomy  
3.The PAXgene tube shall be kept upright during the blood draw  if blood is being drawn 
straight into PAXgene tube (using a butterfly needle).  If blood is being drawn into a syringe first, 
transfer the blood into an upright PAXgene tube.  
4. Immediately after the blood draw, the PAXgene tube shall be gently inverted 10 times, 
and then kept upright.  
5.  The PAXgene tube shall be shipped by [CONTACT_756364] .  
 
3.  Collection and Centrifugation  of CPT tubes prio r to shipment to the Central Reference 
Abatacept Acute GVHD Phase II Trial Version 1/30/2019 
 
 28 Laboratory.  
 
Equipment, Supplies and Reagents Needed:  
 
1. BD Vacutainer® CPT™ Tube with Sodium Citrate at room temperature.  
2. Centrifuge with a horizontal rotor (swing -out head).  
 
Special Precautions and notes:  
1. Make sure tubes are balanced & secured in centrifuge  
2. The CPT tube and centrifuge must be at room temperature.  
 
Centrifuging CPT tubes prior to shipment:  
1. Completely fill the [ADDRESS_1035048] been stored upright for any period of time, remix the blood sample 
immediately prior to centrifugation by [CONTACT_166117] 8 -10 times.  
4. Centrifuge tube/blood sam ple at room temperature (18 -25° C)  in a horizontal rotor 
(swing out head) for 30 minutes at 1800 G with the brake off.  Note that excessive 
centrifuge speed (over 2000 RCF) may cause tube breakage.  
a. To calculate centrifuge speed for a given RCF, use the following formula: 
RPM Speed Setting = (RCF) x (100.000)/ (1.12) x (r)) where r = radius in 
centimeters, rpm is the rotations per minute and RCF is gravities. 
 
5. If the samples are collected at the Emory /CHOA or SCCA  sites, proceed to PBMC 
purification (see A ppendix 1) immediately after centrifugation. If the samples will be 
shipped to the Central Laboratory, after centrifugation, invert the centrifuged tubes gently 
8-10 times to mix the PBMCs with the plasma. This will not cause re -mixing with the 
lower layer , because the gel will form a barrier.  
6. The centrifuged CPT tubes shall be shipped by [CONTACT_756365].  
 
4.  Collection and Cryopreservation of Serum from BD Red Top Serum (Clot) Tubes:  
 
1. Collect blood into labeled BD Vacutainer® Plus Serum Tubes . 

Abatacept Acute GVHD Phase II Trial Version 1/30/[ADDRESS_1035049] venipuncture 
technique.  
3.Immediately mix the collected tube by [CONTACT_5237] 8- 10 times.  
4. Allow the clot to form by [CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_756306] 60 minutes.  
5. Centrifuge the Red top tube at 1800 G for 30 minutes (handle with care after 
centrifuging). Centrifugation,  aliquoting, and cyropreservation shall occur within 4 
hours of sample acquisition.  
 
6.  Aliquot 0.5mL of serum into six  labeled and barcoded 1 mL Nunc tubes (note: the 
desired aliquots are not always obtained).  
 
7. Discard clot.  
 
8. Store serum in a -80°C  Freezer. These will be batch- shipped to the Central 
Laboratory ON DRY ICE on Day +30, Day +100, Day +365 according to the instructions 
below . 
 
5.  Collection and Cryopreservation of Plasma using PPT Plasma Tubes 
1. The BD PPT™ Tube needs to be at room temperature (18 -25°C) and properly labeled 
for patient identification.  
2. Collect blood into the BD PPT™ Tube using your institution’s recommended procedure 
for standard venipuncture technique and sample collection.  
3. After collection of whole blood in the BD PPT™ Tube, gently invert the BD PPT™ Tube 
8 - 10 times.  
4. After mixing, store the BD PPT™ Tube upright at room temperature until centrifugation. 
Blood samples need to be centrifuged within two (2) hours of blood collection for best 
results. Centrifuge the B D PPT™ Tube/blood specimen at room temperature (18- 25°C) 
for a minimum of 20 minutes at 1,100 RCF (Relative Centrifugal Force).  
WARNING: Excessive centrifuge speed (over 10,000 RCF) may cause tube breakage 
and exposure to blood and possible injury. To cal culate the correct centrifuge speed for 
a given RCF, use the following calculator. Simply enter two of the three values in the 
calculator and press the calculate button. http://www.bd.com/vacutainer/

3.7.5 Samples from Healthy Volunteers: Blood samples will be obtained from healthy volunteers at 
Emory University and the Seattle sites , including University of Washington /Seattle Children’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/Seattle Cancer Care Alliance/Seattle Children’s Research Institute,  to be used for quality 
control for the flow cytometry analys is.  Further detail is provided in Appendix 3.  
 
3.8. Treatment  
 
3.8.1.  Donor Selection  and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Grafts:  
 
In selecting a donor, priority should be given to donors who are most closely matched at 
the A, B, C and DRB1 loci. Donors may have a single mismatch (i.e. be a 7/8) and this 
mismatch may be at the allele or antigen l evel; however, donors with allele level disparity 
should be given preference over those with antigen level disparity. The use of 
mismatched donors in which disparity is only in the host versus graft direction (because of 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_756285]) is discouraged because of the potentially  heightened risk for graft 
rejection. Centers may perform extended typi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (e.g. DQB1 and DPB1) according to 
institutional  practices and use these results in selecting donors; however, it is 
recommended that this extending typi[INVESTIGATOR_756310] A, B, C and DRB1.  
 
Either bone marrow or peripheral blood grafts may be employed.  A minimum cell dose 
of 2 * 108 nucleated cells/kg ( recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22593]) is recommended for transplant. In 
planning marrow harvests in the setting of donor -recipi[INVESTIGATOR_453865], the loss 
of cells due to erythrocyte or plasma depletion should be taken into consideration.

3.8.2.  Pre-transplant conditioning:   
 
Treating physicians may select one of four conditioning approaches (outlined below) 
for use and should choose the regimen that he or she thinks is best suited for the 
patient and the patient’s disease.  Patients who have had prior autologous HSCT, 
however, must be conditioned with melphalan and fludarabine.  
 
1) Total body irradiation (TBI) based conditioning:  
 
Centers may employ the myeloablative TBI -based regimens they ordinarily employ for 
patients with hematologic malignancies as long as these regimens meet the following 
criteria:  
 
a) The total dose of TBI is at least 1200 cGy and not more than 1400 cGy.  
b) It is administered in no less than 6 fractions.  
c) It includes one or two chemotherapy agents (e.g. cyclophosphamide, 
etoposide, thiotepa)  
d) It does no t include a lymphocyte depleting antibody (e.g. antithymocyte 
globulin or alemtuzumab)   
    
Some degree of lung shielding during TBI administration is encouraged, using an 
electron boost to the chest wall to preserve full dosing to the ribs.  
  
Cranial and testicular boosts may be administered prior to the start of conditioning at 
the discretion of the treating physician.  
 
2) Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide (recommended for myeloid malignancies 
only) : 
 
In recognition of the fact that varying doses of cyclophosphamide are used in 
combination with high dose busulfan, centers may use the regimen they ordinarily 
employ for patients with myeloid malignancies as long as the regimen meets the 
following criteria:  
 
a) The initial regimen (i.e. before adjustments are made for pharmacokinetic 
testing results) includes the equivalent * of sixteen, 0.8 mg/kg   IV/PO doses (q 
6 hours) of busulfan, administered q 6 hours.   
b) The regimen uses two daily 60 mg/kg doses or four daily 50 mg/kg doses of 
cyclophosphamide.  
c) It does not include a lymphocyte depleting antibody (e.g. antithymocyte 
globulin or alemtuzumab)  
 
 
Adjustments in dosing of busulfan and cyclophosphamide for obesity  
may be made according to  institutional standards.  
Busulfan pharmacokinetic testing : Pharmacokinetic testing is recommended, but 
should be performed according to institutional standards.  Pre-transplant test dosing may 
be used.  
 
Abatacept Acute GVHD Phase II Trial Version 1/30/2019 
 
 33 *Modifications in busulfan administration: The busulfan administration may be 
modified according to institutional practices  as follows:  
 
1) Initial doses as high as 1.2 mg/kg q 6 hr (or 4.8 mg/kg/day see #2) may be used for 
younger children.  
2) Daily doses (e.g. 3.2 mg/kg/day rather than 0.8 mg/kg/day) may be used in place of 
q 6hr dosing.  
3) The dosing may be adjusted based on the results of pharmacokinetic testing. This 
can involve a change in the size of the individual doses or for patients who are getting 
q 6hr dosing where the pharmacokinetic testing result exceeds the upper limit of the 
targeted range, the targeted total dose (e.g. 16 * targeted per dose AUC) may be 
apportioned into 14 or 15 doses rather than 16 as part of the adjustment .   
 
Hydration and MESNA administration : The administration of hydration and 
cyclophosphamide to  prevent hemorrhagic cystitis from cyclophosphamide will follow 
institutional practices.  
 
Seizure prophylaxis: An anti -convulsant will be administered according to institutional 
guidelines to prevent busulfan -induced seizures.  
 
3)  Melphalan and Fludarabine : 
 
Fludarabine  25 mg/m2/dose IV qd (5 doses)   Days -6 to - 2 
Melphalan*   70 mg/m2/dose IV qd (2 doses)*   Day -3 and -2 
 Fludarabine and Melphalan should each be infused over 30 minutes.  
 
Adjustments in dosing of melphalan and fludarabine for obesity may be made 
according to institutional standards.   
 
*Melphalan dosing as high as 90 mg/m2/dose IV qd (2 doses) may be used at the 
discretion of the treating center.  
 
Melphalan and Fludarabine regimens shall not include a lymphocyte depleting antibody 
(e.g. antithymocyte globulin or alemtuzumab).  
 
 
4) Busulfan and Fludarabine (recommended for myeloid malignancies) : 
 
Fludarabine 40 mg/m2/dose IV qd -4 doses     Days -9 to – 6 
Busulfan  0.8 mg/kg/dose IV /PO q6H-16 doses  or the equivalent*        Days -5 to –2 
  Fludarabine should each be infused over 30 minutes and busulfan over two hours.  
  
Adjustments in dosing of busulfan and fludarabine for obesity may be made 
according to institutional standards.  
 
Busulfan and Fludarabine regimens shall not include a lymphocyte depleting antibody 
(e.g. antithymocyte globulin or alemtuzumab).  
 
Busulfan pharmacokinetic testing : Pharmacokinetic testing is recommended, but 
should be performed according to institutional standards. Pre -transplant test dosing may 
be used.

*Modifications in busulfan administration: The busulfan administration may be 
modified according to institutional practices as follows:  
 
1) Initial doses as high as 1.2 mg/kg q 6 hr (or 4.8 mg/kg/day see #2) may be used .If 
initial dosing is greater than 1.2 mg/kg q [ADDRESS_1035054] the PI [INVESTIGATOR_756311].  
2) Daily doses (e.g. 3.2 mg/kg/day rather than 0.8 mg/kg/day) may be used in place of 
q 6hr dosing.  
3) The dosing may  be adjusted based on the results of pharmacokinetic testing. This 
can involve a change in the size of the individual doses or for patients who are getting 
q 6hr dosing where the pharmacokinetic testing result exceeds the upper limit of the 
targeted range,  the targeted total dose (e.g. 16 * targeted per dose AUC) may be 
apportioned into 14 or 15 doses rather than 16 as part of the adjustment.  
 
Seizure prophylaxis: An anti -convulsant will be administered according to institutional 
guidelines to prevent busul fan-induced seizures.  
 
c. Allogeneic Stem Cell Infusion:  
The donor graft will be infused on day 0.  Institutional guidelines should be followed for 
preparation and infusion of grafts.  
 
3.8.3.   Graft Versus Host Disease Prophylaxis and Treatment (with guidelines for dose 
modifications)   
  
Patients assigned to the standard arm and those assigned to the investigational arm will 
receive a calcineurin inhibitor (either cyclosporine or tacrolimus) and methotrexate for 
GVHD prophylaxis.  In addition, patients assigned to the investigational arm will receive 
abatacept, while those assigned to the standard arm will receive a placebo consisting of 
an equal volume of normal saline solution.   
                       
Calcineurin inhibitor (cyclosporine or tacrolimus)  administration will commence no later 
than day – 2 (at least 36 hours before the stem cell infusion); cyclosporine doses will be adjusted 
to maintain a level of 100 -300 ng/ml.   This range assumes monitoring by [CONTACT_450]. If 
an immunoassay is used instead, the equivalent range for that immunoassay should be used ; 
tacrolimus doses will be adjusted to maintain a level of 5 -15 ng/ml. This range should be used 
regardless of the type of assay used to monitor levels. Centers are encouraged to administer 
cyclosporine by [CONTACT_3365], but intermittent infusion will be permitted.   Once the patient 
can tolerate oral medications, the CNI should be converted to an oral formulation.   Patients shall  
receive full dose CNI therapy throug h at least day 100 as tolerated.   Tapering of f the dose may 
be initiated between days 100 to 180 at the discretion of the treating physician. Once the taper 
has been initiated , it will be gradually tapered (25 -40% per month). It can be discontinued once 
the dose is 25% or less of the starting dose.  
 
The CNI may be interrupted or dose reduced at the discretion of the treating physician for renal 
toxicity, poorly controlled hypertension, neurotoxicity and other serious toxicities.  
 
Methotrexate : Methotrexate will be given at a dose of 15 mg/m2 IV  on day 1, and a dose of 10 
mg/m2 IV on days 3 and 6 and 11. D osing shall be based on actual weight.  For patients with a 
body mass index of 35 or higher, however, the dose may be adjusted for obesity acc ording to 
institutional practices.  The day 1 dose shall not be administered until 24 hours following 
Abatacept Acute GVHD Phase II Trial Version 1/30/2019 
 
 35 completion of the stem cell infusion. Monitoring of drug levels and leucovorin are permitted 
according to local institutional guidelines.    
 
As with cyclosporine and tacrolimus, methotrexate dose modifications will be made at 
the discretion of the treating physician.  The following guidelines may be used to guide 
the treating physician.  
 
The methotrexate dose may be reduced by 50% in the following situations : 
 
1. Serum creatinine 2- [ADDRESS_1035055]  bilirubin 2.1 -4.0 
mg/dL.  
3. Oropharyngeal mucositis that is causing symptomatic, but non- life 
threatening airway obstruction 
 
The methotrexate dose may be held in the following situations:   
 
1.  Serum creatinine >3 times baseline.  
2.  Serum ALT >[ADDRESS_1035056]  bilirubin >4.0 mg/dL.  
3.  Oropharyngeal mucositis that is causing life threatening airway obstruction.  
4. Significant third -spacing of fluid (i.e. pleural effusion,  pericardial effusion or 
ascites) . 
 
If, however, more than one dose of methotrexate is held, mycophenolate 
mofetil shall be started in place of methotrexate: 15 mg/kg IV or PO (to 
maximum of 1000 mg) q 8hr through day +30.  It may be continued longer at the 
discretion of the treating physici an, if there is evidence of GVHD.  
 
Distribution and Administration of Study Drug:  
 
Abatacept will be distributed by  [CONTACT_756369] , which will serve as the central pharmacy for the trial.  After an 
initial patient is enrolled at a site, a starter supply of abatacept sufficient for all 
four doses  for one patient  will be shipped overnight to the treating center .  A re -
order form will be included with the starter supply.   It will be each site’s 
responsibility to order re- supplies of abatacept using the provided re- order 
form.   The placebo, normal saline, will not be delivered to treating sites.   Each 
site will use their local supply of nor mal saline to prepare placebo doses.  
 
Dosing of Abatacept  : Abatacept will be administered to patients assigned to 
the investigational arm at a dose of 10mg/kg based on dose calculation weight  
with a maximum of 1000 mg on days - 1, +5, +14, +28. In cases where the 
calculated dose is less than or equal to  110% of a simple multiple of a 250 mg 
vial: 250 mg (275mg), 500 mg (550  mg) or 750 mg ( 825 mg), the dose may  be 
rounded down to the nearest multiple.   No rounding up of t he abatacept dose is 
permitted.   
 
Abatacept will be supplied as a lyophilized powder in single use [ADDRESS_1035057] be 
reconstituted with 10 mL of S terile Water for Injection, USP , using only the silicone- free 
disposable syringe provided. The concentration of abatacept following this step will be 25 
mg/mL. If the powder is accidentally reconstituted using a siliconized syringe, the solution may 
Abatacept Acute GVHD Phase II Trial Version 1/30/[ADDRESS_1035058] any solutions prepared using silic onized syringes. 
The vial should then be vented with a needle to dissipate any foam that may be present. The 
solution should be clear and colorless to pale yellow. The reconstituted solution should then be 
further diluted in 0.9% Sodium Chloride USP (Normal Saline) to a final volume of 100 mL, with a 
concentration not to exceed 10mg/ mL. Slowly  add the reconstituted solution into the infusion 
bag or bottle using the same silicone- free disposable syringe provided with each vial. Gently 
mix. The final concentr ation of abatacept in the bag or bottle will depend upon the amount of 
drug added, but will be no more than 10 mg/m l. 
 
The placebo will consist of 100 ml of 0.9% Sodium Chloride.  Normal saline is being used as a 
placebo, since abatacept is reconstituted in normal saline, since it is clear and colorless after 
reconstitution and since it has been used as the placebo in previous randomized controlled trials 
of abatacept. Since abatac ept has not been associated with high rates of  infusional reactions 
and is a clear, colorless liquid, saline  should be an effective placebo.  
 
For patients in  Stratum #1 (the randomized, double- blind stratum for those receiving an 8/8 HLA 
matched transplant), t he study drug (abatacept or placebo) s hall be labeled  in such a manner as 
to maintain the study blind.  For patients in Stratum #2 (the single- arm stratum for those 
receiving a 7/8 HLA matched transplant), all patients will be receiving abatacept, and  thus the 
study drug will be labeled as “abatacept”.   
 
The study drug (abatacept or placebo) shall be infused intravenously over [ADDRESS_1035059] be administered with an infusion set and a sterile, non- pyrogenic, low-protein- binding filter 
(pore size of 0.2 um to 1.2 um)  
 
 
Premedication with IV  diphenhydramine  shall be performed 30 minutes prior to each study drug  
dose.  (It will not be considered a protocol deviation if patient receives premedication up to 60 
minu tes prior to each study drug dose)  Given the rare but serious side effect of anaphylaxis to 
abatacept, epi[INVESTIGATOR_756312].  (It will not be a protocol deviation if patient receives 
PO diphenhydramine)  
 
The study drug must be held for the following infections:  
 
1) Active serious invasive viral disease (e.g. CMV pneumonitis or enterocolitis) . 
2) Active i nvasive fungal infections, including candidal infections, mold infections 
and pneumocystis.  
3) Active opportunistic protozoal and helminthic infections, such as 
toxoplasmosis.  
4) Imminently life threatening bacterial infections, such as septic shock.  
 
In general, all remaining doses must be withheld  for patients with imminently life 
threatening bacterial infections, however, if the infection responds promptly to 
treatment, the study drug may be resumed and subsequent doses administered.  
Also, the day +28 dose may be delayed up until day +42 t o allow bacterial 
infections to clear. The day - 1, +5 and +14 doses, however, may only be 
withheld- they may not be given after a delay.  
 
It is recommended that the study drug not  be held for less severe infections, 
including the following : 
Abatacept Acute GVHD Phase II Trial Version 1/30/2019 
 
 37  
1) CMV or EBV reactivation.  
2) HSV stomatitis  
3) Bacteremia when the patient is clinically stable.  
4) Superficial fungal infections.  
5) Fever without documented infection.  
 
If lymphoproliferative disease is diagnosed prior to day 28, all remaining doses 
must be held.  
 
If a patient has an anaphylactic reaction,  other systemic allergic reaction (e.g. 
urticarial rash) , or other severe infusional reaction to any study drug dose, all 
remaining study drug doses must  be held.  
 
If the study drug is held as stipulated above, the patient’s treatment shall 
continue to adhere to the treatment protocol,  including scheduled research 
blood draws,  unless the patient’s physician determines that it is in the 
patient’s best interest to discontinue protocol treatment or the patient, the 
patient’s parent or the patient’s guardian refuses further protocol therapy 
(please see section 3.8.6).  
 
2) Treatment of acute and chronic graft versus host disease: Treatment of 
patients who develop graft versus  host disease, either acute or chronic, will be 
prescribed by [CONTACT_1963]. For patients still on prophylaxis when 
their GVHD develops, the administration of prophylactic agents, including 
abatacept, may be discontinued at the discretion of the t reating physician.   
 
3.8.[ADDRESS_1035060] -transplant FLT3 inhibitors:  For patients who are treated for a leukemia with 
FLT3- ITD, post -transplant FLT3 inhibitors may be administered at the discretion of 
the treating physician. It should, however, not be started prior to post -transplant day 
50.   
3.8.[ADDRESS_1035061] -transplant tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in patients with BCR- ABL 
positive leukemias and other post -transplant treatments to decrease the risk 
of relapse:  TKI may be administered post -transplant  to patients with BCR -ABL 
positive leukemias at the discretion of the treating physicians.  Other agents that are 
used post -transplant to decrease the risk of relapse must be approved by [CONTACT_629510], given the impact  that some of these agents may have on immune activation.  
 
3.8.6 Taking patients off protocol  and study :  
Patients who meet any of the following criteria will be taken off treatment protocol.   
 
a) Relapse.  
i. Malignancy Relapse is defined by [CONTACT_756370] -

. 
 
3.8.7    Protocol Deviations:  
 
Circumstances may arise, where it is necessary for patient safety to deviate from the study 
protocol.   When feasible, treating centers should contact [CONTACT_756371].   All deviations, whether approved beforehand or 
not, are required to be reported within 7 working days by [CONTACT_756372].   Centers are also required to note deviations in patient medical 
records and report them to their  local IRB in accordance with local policies.   All protocol 
deviations will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_756313]- Farber Cancer Institute  IRB and 
the DSMC.  
 
 
3.8.8 Drug Information (drugs listed alphabetically):  
 
 
ABATACEPT :  (Orencia, CTLA4 -Ig) 
 
Pharmacology: Abatacept is a soluble fusion protein that consists of the 
extracellular domain of human cytotoxic T- lymphocyte antigen 4 (CLTA -4) linked to the 
modified Fc (hinge, CH2 and CH3 domains) portion of human immunoglobulin G1 
(IgG1).  A batacept is produced by [CONTACT_94988] a mammalian cell 
expression system. The apparent molecular weight of abatacept is 92 kilodaltons.     
Abatacept, a selective costimulation modulator, inhibits T cell (T lymphocyte) activation 
by [CONTACT_756373]80 and CD86, thereby [CONTACT_756374]28.  In vitro, 
abatacept decreases T cell proliferation and inhibits the production of the cytokines 
tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and iterleukin- 2. In other settings the terminal half -life is 
approximat ely 14 days.  
 
Formulation and Stability:   Abatacept is supplied as a sterile, white, 
preservative- free, lyophilized powder for parenteral administration. Following 
reconstitution with 10mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP, the solution of abatacept is 
clear, colorless to pale yellow, with a pH range of 7.0 -8.0.  Each single- use vial of 
abatacept provides 250mg abatacept, 500mg maltose, 17.2 mg monobasic sodium 
Abatacept Acute GVHD Phase II Trial Version 1/30/[ADDRESS_1035062] be 
administered with an infusion set and a sterile, non- pyrogenic, low -protein- binding filter 
(pore size of 0.2 um to 1.2 um)  
 
Supplier: Abatacept, who’s trade name [CONTACT_756417], will be supplied by [CONTACT_756375].  
 
Toxicity:   As an immunosuppressant its most serious side- effect is infection . 
The closely related agent, belatacept, which is being developed for use in solid organ 
transplantation, has been associated with post -transplant lymphoprolifera tive disorder. 
When used for patients with rheumatoid arthritis the incidence of serious infection is 
relatively low (<5%). The intravenous infusion is generally well tolerated. It has been 
associated with a low incidence headache and nausea. It is associa ted with a rare but 
serious side effect of hypersensitivity reactions, which has also included anaphylaxis.  
 
 BUSULFAN (Busulfex®, Myleran®, BU)  
Pharmacology:   Busulfan is a polyfunctional alkylating agent. It interferes with the 
normal function of DNA by [CONTACT_756376].  Busulfan is cell cycle phase non- specific. It is well absorbed orally and is 
metabolized by [CONTACT_4852].  Drugs that induce hepatic metabolism (e.g., phenytoin) increase 
clearance and those that inhibit hepatic metabolism (e.g., itraconazole) may decrease 
clearance.  The plasma half life is ≈ 2.[ADDRESS_1035063] higher 
clearances.  
 
Formulation and Stability: Busulfan is available as a solution for injection as 6  
mg/ml in 10 ml ampoules of 60 mg each and available as 2 mg oral tablets  
 
Supplier: Solution for injection (E SP Pharma, Edison, NJ) is commercially 
available. Oral tablets (GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC) are commercially 
available  
 
Toxicity:  Acute dose limiting toxicity is myelosuppression including leukopenia, 
thrombocytopenia and anemia.  This ef fect is delayed with a nadir of 14- 21 days.  Some 
patients may develop bone marrow fibrosis.  Nausea and vomiting are generally mild.  
Other GI symptoms include diarrhea, anorexia and associated weight loss.  Seizures are 
associated with high doses, including those used in transplantation.  Other side effects 
include liver dysfunction, skin hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371] (Addisonian- like syndrome, often 
unassociated with impaired corticosteroid production), skin rash, gynecomastia, sterility, 
cataracts and alopecia.  Secondary cancers have occurred.  “Busulfan lung”, manifested 
by [CONTACT_756377], persistent cough, fever, rales and dyspnea may 
occur, most commonly after high doses or prolonged therapy.   
                           
CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE  (Cytoxan , CTX)  
 
Source and Pharmacology:  Cyclophosphamide is a nitrogen mustard derivative.  
It acts as an alkylating agent that causes cross -linking of DNA strands by [CONTACT_175726], thus interfering with the normal function of 
DNA.  Cyclophosphamid e is cell cycle, phase non- specific.  Cyclophosphamide is well 
absorbed from the GI tract with a bioavailability of > 75%.  Cyclophosphamide is a prodrug 
that requires activation.  It is metabolized by [CONTACT_51867]- function oxidases in the liver to 4-
hydroxycyclo phosphamide, which is in equilibrium with aldofosfamide.  Aldofosfamide 
Abatacept Acute GVHD Phase II Trial Version 1/30/[ADDRESS_1035064], which is considered to be the major 
active metabolite, and acrolein.  In addition, 4- hydroxycyclophosphamide may be 
enzymatically metabolized to 4 -ketocyclophosphamide and aldofosfamide may be 
enzymatically metabolized to carboxyphosphamide, which are generally considered to be 
inactive.  Cyclophosphamide and its metabolites are excreted mainly in the urine.  Dosage 
adjustments should be made in patients with a creatinine clearance of < 50 ml/min.   
 
Formulation and Stability: Cyclophosphamide is available in vials containing 
100, 200, 500, 1000 and 2000 mg of lyophilized drug and 75 mg mannitol per 100 mg of 
cyclophosphamide. Cyclophos phamide is available in 25 and 50 mg tablets.   Both forms 
of the drug can be stored at room temperature.  The vials are reconstituted with 5, 10, 25, 
50 or 100 ml of sterile water for injection respectively to yield a final maximum 
concentration of 20 mg/m l. Reconstituted solutions may be further diluted in either 5% 
dextrose or 0.9% NaCl containing solutions.  Diluted solutions are physically stable for 24 
hours at room temperate but contain no preservative, so they should be used within 24 
hours of prepar ation.  
 
Supplier:  Commercially available (Bristol -Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ)  
 
Toxicity:  Dose limiting toxicities of cyclophosphamide are bone marrow 
suppression (nadir 8- 14 days) and cardiac toxicity.  Cardiac toxicity is typi[INVESTIGATOR_756314], congestive heart failure, cardiac necrosis or hemorrhagic myocarditis and 
can be fatal.  Hemorrhagic cystitis may occur and necessitates withholding therapy.  The 
incidence of hemorrhagic cystitis is related to cyclophosphamide dose and duration o f 
therapy.  Forced fluid intake and/or the administration of MESNA decreases the incidence 
and severity of hemorrhagic cystitis. Fluid retention due to SIADH may occur.  Other 
toxicities reported commonly include nausea and vomiting (may be mild to severe 
depending on dosage), diarrhea, anorexia, alopecia, immunosuppression and sterility.  
Pulmonary fibrosis, transiently blurred vision, anaphylaxis and secondary neoplasms have 
been reported rarely. Gonadal dysfunction is dose- related.  The prepubertal gonad  is less 
susceptible.  Hormonal function is generally preserved, especially in the male; fertility is 
mainly affected (spermatogenesis in the male, follicle formation in the female).  Sterility may 
be partially reversible.  Gonadal effects of administration during puberty are uncertain; the 
risk of sterility may be increased.   
  
 CYCLOSPORINE  (Gengraf, Neoral, CsA)  
 
 Source and Pharmacology:   Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressive agent 
produced by [CONTACT_756378].   Cyclosporine 
is a nonpolar, cyclic polypeptide antibiotic consisting of 11 amino acids.  It is thought that 
cytotoxic T -lymphocytes (CTLs) together with helper T -cells, natural killer cells and the 
release of lymphokines, including interleukin- 2 (IL- 2), play a major role in graft rejection and 
graft versus host disease.  The exact mechanism(s) of the immunosuppressive action of 
cyclosporine has not been fully elucidated.  Experimental studies suggest that the primary 
actions in preventing graft rejection and in establishing immunologic unresponsiveness to 
allografts are (1) the prevention of precursor CTL from acquiring responsiveness to IL- 2, 
and thereby [CONTACT_756379]; (2) the inhibition of production of IL- [ADDRESS_1035065] on the immune system is largely unexplained.  Studies seem to indicate 
Abatacept Acute GVHD Phase II Trial Version 1/30/2019 
 
 41 that at the intracellular level cyclosporine interferes with the calcium -dependent activation of 
various enzymes systems including the enzymatic cascades accounting for IL- 2 production 
and IL- 2 receptor formation.  
  
 Formulation and Stability:   Cyclo sporine oral solution is supplied in 50 ml bottles.  
It has a clear, yellow, oily appearance.  Each ml contains 100 mg of cyclosporine and ethanol 
12.5% by [CONTACT_756380].  Prior to oral administration, 
the appropriate dose of the CsA solution must be further diluted with milk, chocolate milk, or 
orange juice, stirred well, and taken by [CONTACT_756381].  To ensure adequate dose 
administration, the glass should be rinsed with more milk or orange juice and given to the 
patient.  It should not be allowed to stand for any length of time.   
 Cyclosporin e is also supplied as soft gelatin capsules (Neoral, Gengraf) in a 25 mg 
and 100 mg strength.  Both capsules contain a maximum of 12.7% ethanol, USP 
dehydrated.   
 Intravenous CsA is supplied in a 5 ml sterile ampule for intravenous administration.  
Each ml  contains 50 mg of CsA, 650 Cremophor IL (polyoxethylated castor oil) and ethanol 
32.9% by [CONTACT_8544].  Cyclosporine  concentrate for injection diluted to a final volume of 2-  2.5 
mg/ml is stable for 24 hours in 5% dextrose.   Dilutions of the drug in dextrose or sodium 
chloride should not require protection from light.  The solution should be checked for 
particulate matter and discoloration.  The solution may be administered as a continuous 
infusion over 24 hours, or divided as short -term infusions (2 hours) every 12 hours.   
   
  Supplier:   Commercially available ([COMPANY_001] and Abbott)  
   
  Toxicity:   The most frequent and clinically important adverse effect of cyclosporine 
is nephrotoxicity.  Elevation of BUN and serum creatinine concentrations resulting from 
cyclosporine therapy appear to be dose- related, may be associated with high trough 
concentrations of the drug, and are usually reversible with discontinuation of the drug.  
Clinical manifestations may include fluid retention, edema, and in some cases, 
hyperchloremic, hyperkalemic metabolic acidosis.  The risk of renal toxicity increases with 
admi nistration of other potentially nephrotoxic agents.  Hypertension may develop, generally 
within the first few weeks of therapy and affects both systolic and diastolic blood pressure.  
Some evidence suggests that the hypertension results from the renal vasoconstrictive 
effects of the drug.  Hypertension may respond to dosage reduction and/or antihypertensive 
therapy.  Adverse nervous system effects occur frequently, with tremor occurring in a large 
percentage of patients.  Tremor may be manifested as fine hand tremor, usually is mild in 
severity, may improve despi[INVESTIGATOR_153462], and/or may be alleviated with dosage 
reduction.  Seizures, headache, paresthesia, hyperesthesia, flushing and confusion have 
also been reported occasionally.  Other adverse effects include hirsutism, gingival 
hyperplasia, and hepatotoxicity.  Adverse GI effects occur frequently during cyclosporine  
therapy, including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal discomfort.  
Infectious complications have occurred frequently.  Adverse hematologic effects have 
occurred occasionally during cyclosporine therapy.  
 
 FLUDARABINE  (FLU, Fludara ) 
  Source and Pharmacology Fludarabine phosphate is a synthetic purine 
antimetabolite, a fluorinated nucleotide analog of the antiviral agent adenine arabinoside 
(Ara-A).  Fludarabine undergoes rapid dephosphorylation to 2- fluoro -ara-A and then is 
phosphorylated intracellularly by [CONTACT_756382], 2- fluoro -ara-ATP.  Through its inhibition of  ribonucleotide reductase and DNA 
Abatacept Acute GVHD Phase II Trial Version 1/30/2019 
 
 42 polymerase, this active metabolite ultimately inhibits DNA synthesis.  The mean 
distribution and terminal half -lives o f 2-fluoro -ara-A are approximately 0.6 and 10 hours, 
respectively. The mean total plasma clearance is 8.9 L/h/m2 and the mean volume of 
distribution is 98L/m2. Approximately 23% of a dose is excreted in the urine as unchanged 
2-fluoro -ara A (with dosages o f 18-25 mg/m2/day for 5 days)..  Total body clearance of 2 -
fluoro -ara-A has been shown to be inversely correlated with serum creatinine. Renal 
clearance appears to become more important at higher doses, with approximately 41- 60% 
of the dose being excreted as the active metabolite in the urine with dosages of 80 -260 
mg/m2.       An inverse correlation also exists between absolute granulocyte count and the 
area under the concentration x time curve (AUC).   
  Formulation and stability :  Fludarabine is supplied as a white, lyophilized solid 
phase in single- dose vials containing 50 mg of fludarabine phosphate, 50 mg of mannitol 
and sodium hydroxide (to adjust the pH to 7.7). The intact vials should be stored under 
refrigeration.  This vial should be reconstituted with 2mL of Sterile Water for Injection USP, 
resulting in a final concentration of 25 mg/ml. The solution can  then be further diluted in 
250 mL 5% Dextrose Injection USP.  
   Supplier:  Commercially available (Berlex , Richmond, CA)   
  Toxicity : The maj or dose -limiting toxicity of fludarabine is myelosuppression.  
Nausea and vomiting are usually mild.  Side effects reported commonly include, anorexia, 
fever and chills, alopecia and rash.  Neurotoxicity has been observed at high doses and 
can be manifested by [CONTACT_586372], fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, mental status changes, 
cortical blindness and coma; neurotoxicity is very rare in the doses used for hematopoeitic 
cell transplantation.  Neurotoxicity is usually delayed, occurring [ADDRESS_1035066] 
or later course of therapy.  Administration of corticosteroids usually results in resolution of 
these symptoms.   
 
MELPHALAN HYDROCHLORIDE  (Alkeran L-PAM)  
Source and Pharmacology:  Melphalan hydrochloride is a chemotherapy drug 
belonging to the class of nitrogen mustard alkylating agents. Otherwise known as L-
Phenylalanine Mustard, or L- PAM, melphalan is a phenylalanine derivative of 
mechlorethamine. It acts as an alkylating agent th at causes cross -linking of DNA strands 
by [CONTACT_756383], thus interfering with the 
normal function of DNA. Melphalan is cell cycle phase non- specific.  Melphalan 
hydrochloride is given intravenously and is el iminated rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375] (half life of less than two 
hours) primarily by [CONTACT_756384] (the metabolites are inactive) in the blood.  
 
Formulation and Stability: Melphalan is available in vials containing lyophilized drug, 
which can be stored at room temperature.  The drug is reconstituted in 0.9% NaCl solution.  
Once reconstituted, melphalan should be administered within 60 minutes, since it is 
unstable in solution.  
 
Supplier:  Commercially available (GlaxoSmithKline)  
Abatacept Acute GVHD Phase II Trial Version 1/30/2019 
 
 43  
Toxicity:  Dose limiting toxicities of melphalan are bone marrow suppression.. Other 
toxicities reported commonly include nausea and vomiting (may be mild to severe 
depending on dosage), diarrhea, anorexia, alopecia, immunosuppression, lung injury, 
acute and chronic,  hypogonadism and infertility.  Secondary neoplasms and anaphylaxis 
have been reported. Gonadal dysfunction is dose- related.  The prepubertal gonad is less 
susceptible.  .   
 
 MESNA  (Sodium 2- Mercaptoethane Sulfonate, Mesnex)  
 
 Source and Pharmacology :  MESNA is a synthetic sulfhydryl (thiol) compound.  It 
contains free sulfhydryl groups that interact chemically with urotoxic metabolites of the 
oxazaphosphorines, ifosfamide and cyclophosphamide.  Within 1 hour of administration, 
MESNA is co mpletely oxidized to DiMESNA, a totally inert compound.  There is little or no 
tissue penetration.  Following glomerular filtration DiMESNA is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_756315], which inactivates the oxazaphosphamides, thus preventing 
bladder toxicity. Oral bioavailability is ≈ 50%.  Mesna and mesna disulfide are excreted 
primarily via the urine.  
 
 Formulation and Stability :  Available in ampules containing 100 mg/ml of solution 
containing disodium edentate 0.[ADDRESS_1035067] ampules at 
controlled room temperature (15º -30ºC).  MESNA is not light -sensitive, and intact ampules 
are stable for five years from manufacture.  For this protocol, further dilution is not required.  
If further dilution is desired, MESNA can be mixed in the following intravenous infusion 
solutions with less than 5% decomposition over 24 hours:  5% dextrose, 5% dextrose in 
0.45 sodium chloride, 0.9% sodium chl oride and lactated Ringer's.   
 
 Supplier :  Commercially available (Bristol- Meyers Squibb, Princeton, NJ)   
 
 Toxicity : Mesna is generally well tolerated.  It may cause nausea and vomiting, and 
a bitter taste during IV administration. At 60 -70 mg/kg IV dail y x 4, abdominal pain, rash, 
headache, limb and joint pain, lethargy, diarrhea, and transient hypotension have been 
encountered. Mesna may cause false positive urine dipstick readings for ketones.  
METHOTREXATE  (MTX, amethopterin, Trexall®)  
 
Source and Pharmacology : A folate analogue, which reversibly inhibits 
dihydrofolate reductase, the enzyme that reduces folic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid. 
Inhibition of tetrahydrofolate formation limits the availability of one carbon fragments 
necessary for the synthesis of purines and the conversion of deoxyuridylate to thymidylate 
in the synthesis of DNA and cell reproduction. The polyglutamated metabolites of MTX 
also contribute to the cytotoxic effect of MTX on DNA repai r and/or strand breaks.  MTX 
cytotoxicity is highly dependent on the absolute drug concentration and the duration of 
drug exposure. MTX is actively transported across cell membranes. At serum 
methotrexate concentrations exceeding 0.1μmol/mL, passive diffus ion becomes a major 
means of intracellular transport of MTX. The drug is widely distributed throughout the body 
with the highest concentration in the kidney, liver, spleen, gallbladder  and skin. Plasma 
concentrations following high dose IV MTX decline in a biphasic manner with an initial 
half-life of 1.5 -3.5 hours, and a terminal half life of 8- 15 hours. About 50% is bound to 
protein. Small amounts are excreted in the feces. There is significant entero -hepatic 
circulation of MTX. The distribution of MTX int o third -space fluid collections, such as 
Abatacept Acute GVHD Phase II Trial Version 1/30/[ADDRESS_1035068] spaces over time prolongs the terminal half -
life of the drug, leading to potent ially increased clinical toxicity.  
 
Formulation & Stability: Methotrexate for Injection is available as a lyophilized 
powder for injection in 20 mg and 1 gm vials. The powder for injection contains 
approximately 0.14 mEq sodium in the 20 mg vial; 7 mEq sodium in the 1 g vial. 
Methotrexate for Injection is also available as a 25 mg/mL solution in 2, 4, 8, 10, 20 and 
40 ml preservative free vials and 2 and 10 ml vials with preservative. The 2, 4, 8, 10, 20, 
and 40 mL solutions contain approximately 0.43, 0 .86, 1.72, 2.15, 4.3, and 8.6 mEq 
sodium per vial, respectively. The preserved vials contain 0.9% benzyl alcohol as a 
preservative and must not be used for intrathecal or high  dose therapy. Sterile 
methotrexate powder or solution is stable at 20 to 25 Cº ( 68 to 77 Fº); excursions permitted 
to 15 to 30 Cº (59 to 86 Fº). Protect from light.  
 
  Supplier: Commercially available from various manufacturers.  
 
Toxicity:  In the low doses administered for GVHD prophylaxis can contribute to 
transplant related hepato xicity, contribute to oropharyngeal and gastrointestinal mucositis, 
and delay hematopoeitic recovery.  
 
 
  Tacrolimus (FK-506, Prograf®)  
 
Source and Pharmacology : A macrolide antibiotic derived from the soil fungus 
Streptomyces tsukubaensis, it inhibits ac tivation of T lymphocytes. Its major mechanism 
of action is blockade of the signal stemming from T cell receptor binding of an antigenic 
peptide complexed with an HLA molecule. Tacrolimus binds the intracellular protein 
FKBP- 12 and this complex, in turn, i nhibits calcineurin. In its oral formulation, tacrolimus’ 
bioavailability is approximately 15- 30%. Once absorbed it is highly protein bound. It is 
cleared primarily by [CONTACT_171339] (cytochrome P -450 system) with biliary excretion 
of these metabolites . Its elimination half -life is approximately 9- 11 hours.   
 
Formulation & Stability: Tacrolimus for intravenous administration is available in 
ampules of concentrated solution. It must be diluted in D5W or NS to a final concentration 
ranging from 0.004 mg/ml to 0.02 mg/ml.  The undiluted solution should be stored at 5 to 
25 degrees Celsius. Tacrolimus is also available in oral capsules, which should be stored 
at 25 degrees Celsius. A suspension can be prepared from the capsules. .  
 
  Supplier: Comm ercially available from various manufacturers.  
 
Toxicity:  The most frequent and clinically important adverse effect of tacrolimus is 
nephrotoxicity.  This toxicity appears to be dose- related is usually reversible with 
discontinuation of the drug.  Clinical manifestations may include fluid retention, edema, and 
in some cases, hyperchloremic, hyperkalemic metabolic acidosis.  The risk of renal toxicity 
increases with administration of other potentially nephrotoxic agents.  Hypertension may 
develop, generally within the first few weeks of therapy and affects both sys tolic and diastolic 
blood pressure.  Some evidence suggests that the hypertension results from the renal 
vasoconstrictive effects of the drug.  Hypertension may respond to dosage reduction and/or 
antihypertensive therapy.  Adverse nervous system effects oc cur frequently, with tremor 
occurring in a large percentage of patients.  Tremor may be manifested as fine hand tremor, 
Abatacept Acute GVHD Phase II Trial Version 1/30/2019 
 
 45 usually is mild in severity, may improve despi[INVESTIGATOR_153462], and/or may be alleviated 
with dosage reduction.  Seizures, headache,  paresthesia, hyperesthesia, flushing and 
confusion have also been reported occasionally.  Other adverse effects include hirsutism, 
gingival hyperplasia, and hepatotoxicity.  Adverse GI effects occur frequently during 
tacrolimus therapy, including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, anorexia and abdominal 
discomfort.  Infectious complications have occurred frequently.  
 
 
Etoposide (VePesid ®, Etopophos® , VP-16) 
  
 Pharmacology : A semisynthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin that forms a 
complex with topoisomerase II and DNA which results in single and double strand DNA 
breaks. Its main effect appears to be in the S and G 2 phase of the cell cycle. The initial 
tó is 1.5 hours and the mean terminal half -life is 4 to 11 hours. It is primarily excreted in 
the urine. In children, approximately 55% of the dose is excreted in the urine as 
etoposide in 24 hours. The mean renal clearance of etoposide is 7 to 10 mL/min/mÇ or 
about 35% of the total body clearance over a dose range of 80 to 600 mg/mÇ. 
Etoposide, therefore, is cl eared by [CONTACT_756385], i.e., metabolism 
and biliary excretion. The effect of renal disease on plasma etoposide clearance is not 
known. Biliary excretion appears to be a minor route of etoposide elimination. Only 6% 
or less of an intrav enous dose is recovered in the bile as etoposide. Metabolism 
accounts for most of the non renal clearance of etoposide.  
 
The maximum plasma concentration and area under the concentration time curve (AUC) 
exhibit a high degree of patient variability. Etopos ide is highly bound to plasma proteins 
(~94%), primarily serum albumin. Pharmacodynamic studies have shown that etoposide 
systemic exposure is related to toxicity. Preliminary data suggests that systemic 
exposure for unbound etoposide correlates better than total (bound and unbound) 
etoposide. There is poor diffusion into the CSF < 5%.  
Etoposide phosphate is a water soluble ester of etoposide which is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_756316]. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
data indicate that etoposide phosphate is bioequivalent to etoposide when it is 
administered in molar equivalent doses.  
 
Formulation and Stability : Etoposide for Injection is available as a 20 mg/mL solution 
in sterile multiple dose vials (5 mL, 25 mL, or 50 mL each). T he pH of the clear, nearly 
colorless to yellow liquid is 3 to 4. Each mL contains 20 mg etoposide, 2 mg citric acid, 
30 mg benzyl alcohol, 80 mg modified polysorbate 80/tween 80, 650 mg polyethylene 
glycol 300, and 30.5 percent (v/v) alcohol. Vial headspac e contains nitrogen. Unopened 
vials of etoposide are stable until expi[INVESTIGATOR_756317] ( 20°-25°C or  68°-77°F ). Etoposide phosphate for injection is available for 
intravenous infusion as a sterile lyophilized powder in s ingle -dose vials containing 
etoposide phosphate equivalent to [ADDRESS_1035069] be stored under refrigeration (2° -8°C or 
36°-46°F). Unopened vials of etoposide phosphate are stable until the expi[INVESTIGATOR_756318].  
 
Supplier : Commercially available from various manufacturers.  
 
Toxicity : Myelosuppression is dose related and dose limiting, with granulocyte nadirs 
occurring 7 to 14 days after drug administration and platelet n adirs occurring 9 to 16 
Abatacept Acute GVHD Phase II Trial Version 1/30/[ADDRESS_1035070] also been reported in 
patients with neutropenia . Death associated with myelosuppression has been reported. 
The occurrence of  acute leukemia  with or without a preleukemic phase has been 
reported rarely in patients treated with etoposide in association with other antineoplastic 
agents.  Nausea and vomiting are the major gastrointestinal toxicities. The severity of 
such nausea and vomiting is generally mild to moderate with treatment discontinuation 
required in 1% of patients. Nausea and vomiting can usually be controlled with standard 
antiemetic therapy. Mild to severe mucositis/esophag itis may occur. Gastrointestinal 
toxicities are slightly more frequent after oral administration than after intravenous 
infusion.  Anaphylactic -like reactions characterized by [CONTACT_346566], fever,  tachycardia, 
bronchospasm,  dyspnea and/or  hypotension have been reported to occur in 0.7% to 2% 
of patients receiving intravenous etoposide and in less than 1% of the patients treated 
with the oral capsules. These reactions have usually responded promptly to the 
cessation of the infusion and administration of pres sor agents,  
corticosteroids,  antihistimines, or volume expanders as appropriate; however, the 
reactions can be fatal. Hypertension and/or flushing have also been reported.  Blood 
pressure  usually normalizes within a few hours after cessation of the infusion. 
Anaphylactic -like reactions have occurred during the initial infusion of etoposide.  
Facial/tongue swelling, coughing, diaphoresis,  cyanosis, tightness in throat, 
laryngospasm,  back pain, and/or loss of consciousness have sometimes occurred in 
association with the above reactions. In addition, an apparent hypersensitivity -
associated apnea has been reported rarely. Rash,  urticaria, and/or  pruritis  have 
infrequently been reported at recommended doses. At investigational doses, a 
generalized prurit ic erythematous maculopapular rash, consistent with perivasculitis, has 
been reported.   
The following adverse r eactions have been infrequently reported:  abdominal pain, 
aftertaste, constipation,  dysphagia,  asthenia,  fatigue,  malaise,somnolence , 
transient  cortical blindness, optic neuritis, interstitial pneumonitis/pulmonary fibrosis, 
fever, seizure (occasionally associated with allergic reactions),  Stevens -Johnson 
syndrome, and toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194],  pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], and a single report of radiation 
recall dermatitis.  
Hepatic toxicity, generally in patients receiving higher doses of the drug than those 
recommended, has been reported with etoposide. Metabolic acidosis has also been 
reported in patients receiving higher doses.  
 
 
 
3.9 Supportive Care:  With the exception of investigational supportive care agents and 
trials, there are no specifically prohibited supportive care agents for this study.  
Please refer to Section 3.3f for guidance about co- enrollment on other studies.  
 
1) Growth factors :  It is recomme nded that patients not receive post -transplant 
growth factors before day +14 (for those receiving PBSC transplants ) or day +21 
(for those receiving bone marrow transplants) , except in the case of serious 
infection where hastening neutrophil recovery by 1- 3 days may be critical for 
survival. After day  +14 (PBSC) or  +21 (BMT) , GCSF or GMCSF should be given 
for severe neutropenia (ANC <500/mcL) or as necessary to keep AN C 
>1000/mc L at the treating physicians discretion.   
 
Abatacept Acute GVHD Phase II Trial Version 1/30/2019 
 
 47 2) Blood Products:  The transfusion of blood products (erythrocytes and platelets) 
will be administered according to local institutional guidelines. Granulocyte 
infusions may be used at the discretion of the treating physician for treating 
serious infection.  
 
3) Management of I nfections:  Prophylaxis against HSV, VZV, PCP, fungal and 
bacterial infections shall be administered according to institution guidelines and 
should be in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_756319], the 
Infectious Disease Society of America, and the American Society of Blood and 
Marrow Transplantation for preventing infections among hematopoietic stem cell 
transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] ( www.CDC.gov ). The use of IVIG, and the administration of 
post-transplant vaccines should also be conducted according to institutional 
guidelines. The treatment of bacterial, fungal, viral and other infections should be 
according to institutional practices . 
 
All patients are required to be monitored for CMV reactivation (regardless of 
the results of donor and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_24428] -transplant serology) .  This testing sh all be 
initiated no later than transplant day +[ADDRESS_1035071] every 4 weeks through day 180. 
More frequent testing may be indicated for some patients. Either antigen (pp65) 
or PCR (whole blood, plasma or leukocyte) testing may be used according to 
institutional practices. Pre -emptive therapy for CMV should be administered 
according to institutional practices.   
 
4) EBV-Related Lymphoproliferative Disease (PTLD) :  Though the use acyclovir 
for preventing EBV -PTLD has not been well studied in blood and marrow 
transplantation, clinical studies in solid organ transplantation suggest it is 
effective and support its use. As such, acyclovir or valacyclovir should be 
administered to all patients through day +180 regardless of HSV and VZV status. 
Centers may dose acyclovir and valacyclovir in accordance with their i nstitutional 
practices for HSV or VZV prophylaxis. Alternatively, centers may use the dosing 
below:  
 
Acyclovir 250 mg/m2 IV q 8H until able to take PO and then switch to valacyclovir 
10 mg/kg (to max of 500 mg) or acyclovir 600 mg/m2 (to max of 800 mg) po bid 
through day +180. Prophylaxis should start no later than day - 1. 
 
All patients are required to be routinely monitored for emerging 
lymphoproliferative disease using EBV PCR after transplant  (regardless of the 
results of donor and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_24428] -transplant serology).  Plasma, whole blood or 
peripheral blood mononuclear cell assays may be used according to institutional 
preferences.  Because PCR monitoring has a high false positive rate, that is  many if 
not most patients with elevated levels will never develop PTLD, testing should be 
used primarily as a prompt for more definitive diagnostic testing (radiographic testing 
and biopsy).36,37 This  PCR testing shall be initiated no later than transplant day +[ADDRESS_1035072] cases. The need for extended testing will be determined by [CONTACT_756353] 1/30/2019 
 
 48 treating physician. In addition, PCR testing more fre quently than once ever y two 
weeks may be indicated, as determined by [CONTACT_756386], especially in the event of low level EBV reactivation.    
 
The threshold for concern varies greatly by [CONTACT_756387]; for 
example, a threshold of >10,000,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/million cells has been recommended 
for PBMC assays, while a threshold of >1000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml has been recommended 
for plasma assays. 36,37,[ADDRESS_1035073] cases, especially for early disease (polymorphic disease, plasmacytic 
hyperplasia, mononucleosis -like disease).  More aggressive therapy, donor -
lymphocyte infusions, EBV -specific cytotoxic lymphocyte infusions or 
chemotherapy, is often warranted for more advanced, rituximab- refractory or 
progressive forms of PTLD. 36,37,[ADDRESS_1035074] -transplant period.  In patients with persistently  positive  EBV 
PCR levels but no evidence of PTLD, however, reduction in immune suppression 
may prevent the development of PTLD. 36,37,38 Reductions in immune 
suppression, when safe (no GVHD) and feasible, then should be considered in 
this setting. 36,37,38 
 
3.10 Data Collection and Study Endpoints 
 
a)Data Collection: The REDCap™ system, a secure web application for building and 
managing online surveys and databases, will be used for data submission.  Access to the 
system  will be provided through Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta, a REDCap™ consortium 
partner. RedCap will  be used to capture data for enrollment, baseline patient, disease and 
treatment characteristics and outcomes. The study CRN will enable participating centers to 
access the system.  Clinical research associates and clinical research nurses at participating  
centers will then access the enrollment and  case report forms  on the trial website.  Also on 
the website will be detailed guidance for accurately completing the forms and the timeframe 
for submission of each form .  If web access is not available, the form s may be printed, filled 
manually and submitted by [CONTACT_756388] . The data will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_756320]. All questions regarding the system should be directed to the study CRA or

3.11 Sample Size Considerations, Randomization Scheme and Statistical Analysis:   
 
3.11.1  Sample size and statistical power:  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Stratum 1 ( For patients receiving 8/8 HLA matched unrelated donor 
transplants):  Using a Bayesian test of hypothesis, the cumulative incidence of Gr III- IV 
severe acute GVHD in the patients randomly assigned to the investigational regimen will 
be compared to the cumulative incidence in patients randomly assigned to the standard 
regimen . This will be an intent -to-treat  analysis. In these calculations, adhering to the 
paradigm endorsed by [CONTACT_472], 43-46 for the design of screening phase II randomized 
controlled trials, we employed an alpha and beta of < 0.2.  We estimated the cumulative 
incidence of Grade II I-IV aGvHD by [CONTACT_2006] +[ADDRESS_1035083] . 11,49,58. From  the experience of the phase III 
randomized controlled trials of aGvHD prevention 11,49,58 we estimated the absolute 
reduction in the incidence of severe aGVHD that we would achieve with abatacept (the 
δ) to be 0. 10, predicting an incidence of 0. 10 for the investigational arm.  
 
 
Given these assumptions, the statistical rule was set as follows:  Let θ1 be the true incidence of 
grade III -IV aGVHD in the standard arm and θ [ADDRESS_1035084] t he null hypothesis Ho: θ 1 < θ2 against the alternative 
hypothesis Ha: θ 1 > θ2 . The decision rule is to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the 
alternative if P( θ1 > θ2 | data) > 0.8. For the patients that will be enrolled in this study, the 
historical incidence of grade III -IV aGVHD is approximately 20%.  In order to detect a reduction 
Abatacept Acute GVHD Phase II Trial Version 1/30/2019 
 
 52 of l0% in the incidence of severe GvHD in the investigational cohort (incidence of aGv HD 
decreasing from 20% to 10%), a group size of [ADDRESS_1035085] 80% 
power.  Thus, the total targeted enrollment for the randomized stratum of 8/8 matched 
transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_756321] 140 patients. The table below gives the operating characteristics of the 
design assuming uniform (non -informative) prior distributions for the parameters θ [ADDRESS_1035086] column of the table gives the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis 
in favor of the alternative hypothesis for each scenario and the parameter δ = θ [ADDRESS_1035087] 
size. Scenario 1 is the ideal scenario and the corresponding P(Ha) is the Bayesian power. 
Scenario 2 corresponds to no difference in incidence rates and P(Ha) corresponds to the 
“Bayesian ty pe I error probability”. We note that here, we are being less conservative in terms of 
this Bayesian type I error probability since this trial is following the strategy endorsed by [CONTACT_756396] a screening phase II trial. Scenario [ADDRESS_1035088] column was obtai ned by [CONTACT_80729] [ZIP_CODE] trial replicates under each 
scenario.

3.11. 1.2 Stratum 2 (For patients receiving 7/8 HLA matched unrelated donor transplants): 
Sample size and statistical power:  The cumulative incidence of grade II I – IV acute GVHD by 
[CONTACT_4475] 100 in patients enrolled in the 7/8 matched stratum will be compared to the cumulative 
incidence of grade II I – IV acute GVHD b y day 100 in control subjects from the CIBMTR 
database.  A maximum of 3 matched controls will be randomly selected for each case using the 
following criteria:  
Based on data from the CIBMTR (personal communication, Marcelo Pasquini), we are 
estimating that the cumulative incidence of grade II I – IV acute GVHD by [CONTACT_4475] 100 for the 7/8 
matched transplant control group (calcineurin inhibitor and methotrexate alone for GVHD 
prophylaxis) will be 30%.  Let θ 1 be the true incidence of g rade II I-IV aGVHD in the control  
arm and θ 2 be the corresponding incidence rate in the  (case)  investigational arm. We will test 
the null hypothesis Ho: θ 1 < θ2 against the alternative hypothesis Ha: θ 1 > θ2 . The decision rule 
is to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alter native if P( θ1 > θ2 | data) > 0.8. Table 6 shows 
the Bayesian power (row 1) to detect a 20% reduction in grade II I – IV acute GVHD by [CONTACT_4475] 100 
with abatacept and Bayesian type I error probability (row 2) using a 1:2 case control matching 
ratio, 40 patients in the 7/8 matched group and 80 for the control group.

3.11.2  Randomization: For stratum 1, non -adaptive randomization will be used with a block 
size of 8  and an allocation ratio of  1:1 to assign each patient to one of the two arms: (1) Arm A -
standard GVHD prophylaxis with a calcineurin inhibitor, methotrexate and placebo; and (2) Arm 
B-investigational prophylaxis with abatacept, a calcineurin inhibitor and methotrexate. Allocation 
will be performed across one factor: patient age: patients ≤21 years of age versus  patients > [ADDRESS_1035090] will be closely correlated with age (pediatric 
versus adult centers), we will not be stratifying on center. Randomization will be performed 
using the open source randomization software RAND I2 52,[ADDRESS_1035091] and the study monitors will be unmasked  to group 
specification; all others will be blind to subject randomization.  
 
3.11.3  Statistical Analyses  
 
Primary endpoint :  
 
The primary analysis will consist of comparing the cumulative incidence of severe aGVHD  at 
day +[ADDRESS_1035092] GVHD prophylaxis.  This comparison will be made as follows for the two 
Study Strata:  
 
For Stratum 1 (8/8 HLA -matched),  patients randomly assigned to investigational prophylaxis 
will be compared to those randomly assigned to standard prophylaxis.  
 
For Stratum 2 (7/8 matched),  patients enrolled on- study, and receiving investigational 
prophylaxis will be compared to a matched control group drawn from the CIBMTR registry. Each 
patient receiving investigational prophylaxis will be matched to at least two registry control 
patients (up to four as feasible). To be eligible for inclusion in the control group, registry patients 
must meet the following criteria: 1) Received a 7/8 matched unrelated marrow or peripheral 
blood transplant between 2008 and 2014.  2) Be at least 6 years old. 3) Have received 
cyclosporine or tacrolimus and methotrexate alone (no lymphocyte depleting antibodies) for 
GVHD prophylaxis. Trial patients and registry control patients will be matched on three 
variables: age (within ten years), performance status, and disease stage (early, intermediate 
and advanced using CIBMTR criteria).   
 
For the few patients (<5) with 7/[ADDRESS_1035093] GVHD prophylaxis . .The primary outcome will be assessed in a 
Abatacept Acute GVHD Phase II Trial Version 1/30/[ADDRESS_1035094] of 
measures, such as withdrawal of immune suppression and donor -lymphocyte infusion, often 
used in response to relapse The cumulative incidence and confidence interval will be calculated.  
The cumulative incidence will be compared between treatment arms  using Gray’s test . 
 
Secondary endpoints: A cumulative incidence curve will be computed along with a 95% 
confidence interval  for infection, serious infection, CMV viremia, CMV invasive disease, EBV 
viremia, PTLD, BK viremia and disease, adenovirus viremia and disease, engraftment of: 
neutrophils, platelets, lymphocyte count (>1000 cells/ µl), total T cell counts (>500 cells/ µl), 
CD4+ T cell counts (>200 cells/ µl),  and CD8+ T cell counts (>200 cells/ µl), secondary graft 
failure, graft rejection, all grades of early and late aGvHD, overlap syndrome, chronic GvHD, 
RRT, TRM, DFS, immunosuppression- free survival, immunosuppressive- free/relapse- free 
survival, relapse, and OS . A log -rank test will be used to compare the two treatment arms.  
Death will be considered as a competing risk for neutrophil engraftment, platelet engraftment, 
lymphocyte- , total T cell -, CD4+ T cell- , CD8+ T cell-  engraftment, relapse acute GVHD and 
chronic GVHD.  Relapse will be considered a competing risk for TRM. Relapse will also be 
considered a competing risk for aGVHD, overlap syndrome and cGvHD to negate the effect of 
measures, such as withdrawal of immune suppression and donor -lymphocyte infusion, often 
used in response to relapse. Gray’s test  will be used for statistical analyses  where competing 
risks exist and log- rank testing where they do not.  
 
 The proportion of patients who fail to engraft by [CONTACT_4475] [ADDRESS_1035095] or nonparametric tests as appropriate.  Descriptive statistics will be 
computed for all the immune reconstitution assays. Treatment arms will be compared using chi -
square tests, t -tests or non- parametric tests as appropriate for the assay. In addition to the 
planned clinical and biologic assessments through day +[ADDRESS_1035096] -transplant to document overall 
survival and chronic GvHD.  
 
4. Protection of Human Subjects 
 
4.1  IRB review and Patient Informed Consent : This protocol will be first reviewed and approved 
by [CONTACT_756397]’s Data Coordinating Center (Lead IRB for the study) . Each 
participating site will then be required to submit the Lead IRB approved protocol to 
their local IRB for approval  at their site.  Consent forms will be modified as needed to 
comply with local institutional guidelines. The Clinical Trials Coordinator for the study will 
review and approve modified versions of consent forms before participating centers submit to 
their IRBs. The trial will not open for enrollment at a given center until the protocol has been 
approved by [CONTACT_756398] a copy of the approval l etter has been provided to the Clinical Trials 
Coordinator. The protocol will also be reviewed by [CONTACT_83500] 
(NMDP).  
4.2 IRB review as of 7/1/2018.  [CONTACT_756419],  the Overall PI [INVESTIGATOR_80336] , moved to the 
Division of Hematology/Oncology at [LOCATION_011] Children’s Hosptial and Dana- Farber Cancer 
Institute.  The Dana- Farber Cancer Institute IRB will become the L ead IRB  (previously Fred 
Hutch)  for this study . The DFCI IRB  will do review  of all amendments , and once approved, will 
be  provided to performance sites to be reviewed by [CONTACT_529036].  The Clinical Trials  
Coordinator , Brandi Bratrude, will continute to coordinate the review of any events , protocol

Prospective participants and their families will be informed of the nature of the study and will 
be given pertinent information as to the intended purpose, possible benefits, and possible 
adverse events. The procedures and possible hazards to which the patient will be exposed 
will be explained, as well as alternatives to participation in this trial, will be presented in detail 
to the patient and donor and to the patient’s and donor’s responsible family members. An 
approved informed consent statement will be read and signed by [CONTACT_102] (or responsible 
family member if under the age of 18), a witness and an investigator . Through the NMDP, an 
approved informed consent statement will also be read and signed by [CONTACT_756399] a 
witness. .   
 
For patients participating at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta or Emory University : 
Verbal assent will be obtained from children ages 6 to 10 and documented in the patients’ 
medical record, as well as being noted in the case report forms. Written assent will be obtained 
from children ages 11 to 16, using an approved assent statement, along with use of the 
informed consent by [CONTACT_756400]. Children 17 years or older will read/sign the 
consent form along with their parent or guardian.   
 
For patients participating at other centers: assent will be obtained according to local 
instit utional guidelines .  
  
 
4.3 Investigational New Drug application. The use of abatacept in this trial is covered by 
[CONTACT_116909]# 111738.  
 
4.4 Interim Analyses and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_15381]:  
 
Interim analyses for safety :  Combining Strata [ADDRESS_1035097] reached day 
+100 ([ADDRESS_1035098] -transplant) or died . Enrollment will not be suspended while the 
analyses are being performed.  Enrollment will be  suspended, if and when the analyses 
yield early evidence of harm according to the statistically defined guidelines.    
 
Safety  will be monitored by [CONTACT_756401]: (a) post -transplant lymphoproliferative 
disease (PTLD), and (b) day 100 transplant -related mortality in both arms.  
 
(a) The PTLD stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877]:  The trial will stop if the probability that the development of malignant 
PTLD rate (θ) exceeds 20% is equal or higher than 0.95, i.e., stop  if Pr{θ>0. 20|data}≥0.95. A 
noninformative prior distribution for θ will be used. Table [ADDRESS_1035099] 10 patients is evaluated (interim analysis 
1) if [ADDRESS_1035100], the true θ = 0 .2. This is the equivalent of the Bayesian 
type I error probability. The target type I error probability was set at 0.05.  
 
Abatacept Acute GVHD Phase II Trial Version 1/30/2019 
 
 56  
(b) The day 100 transplant -related mortality stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877] : The trial will stop if the probability 
that the day 100 transplant -related mortality rate (θ) exceeds 5% is equal or higher than 0.95, i.e., 
stop if Pr{θ>0.05|data}≥0. 95. A noninformative prior distribution for θ will be used. Table [ADDRESS_1035101] 10 patients is assessed 
(interim analysis 1), the trial will be stopped. The third column gives the probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_756322], the true θ = 0.20. This is the equivalent of the Bayesian type I err or probability. 
The target type I error probability was set at 0.05.  
 
Interim Analysis for Efficacy:  This will involve the randomized stratum (stratum 1) only at a 
single time point after the 100th patient enrolled in that stratum has reached day 100 (50 patients 
per group).  The rule will be intended to halt enrollment better than expected efficacy. The 
Bayesian power for detecting a 10% decrease in the incidence of grade III -IV aGVHD rate and 
the corresponding Bayesian type I error probability  is calcul ated such that  at the interim 
analysis, we will stop the trial for efficacy if P( θ1 > θ2 | data) > 0.8. The minimum detectable 
difference between the incidence of grade III -IV aGVHD rates in this interim analysis is given by 
δ using the following calculation:  Power = 0.7, Type I error probability = 0.195, delta = 0.134.  
   
4.4 Data and Safety Monitoring and Suspension of Enrollment:  This study will be centrally 
reviewed by [CONTACT_180096] (DSMC) of the Pediatric Blood and 
Marrow Transplant Consortium (PBMTC). This DSMC is chartered to monitor trials enr olling 
both children and adult patients. The DSMC is a standing committee, composed of a chair, 
patient advocate, biostatistician, nurse representative and 2 bone marrow transplant physicians 
with procedures and processes as defined in the PBMTC DSMC Chart er. The DSMC will review 
the study protocol prior to study activation and IRB review, and will continue to review the study 
on a regular basis according to the committee rules.    
 
The DSMC will meet at regular intervals to review all adverse events and deaths and determine 
whether any patient safety problems necessitate protocol modifications or discontinuation of the 
trial. The DSMC will also meet on an ad hoc  basis to review the r esults of interim analyses or if 

Abatacept Acute GVHD Phase II Trial Version 1/30/[ADDRESS_1035102] the distributed 
communications from the DSMC to their local IRB.  
 
4.5 Adverse events, unanticipated problems and other immediately reportable events.  
 
a) Definitions : 
a. An adverse event (AE)  is any untoward medical occurrence regardless of 
causality assessment.  An adverse event can be an unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, syndrome or disease 
associated with or occurring during the use of an investigational product whether 
or not considered related to the investigational product.    
b. An adverse event is defined as a serious adverse event (SAE)  when the AE 1) 
results in death, 2) is considered life- threatening, 3) results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_756323], 4) results in permanent disability or 
irreversible impairment, 5) leads to a congenital anomaly, or 6) represents a 
significant medical condition which, without urgent medical intervention, would 
lead to one of the above outcomes. Life- threatening means that the AE 
represented an immediate threat of death without medical intervention. For the 
purposes of this study , post -transplant lymphoproliferative disorder 
(PTLD), non- engraftment, graft rejection and secondary graft failure (see 
section 3.10. ii for definitions) shall  always be considered SAEs regardless 
of their impact on the patient’s condition.   
 
c. Unexpected adverse event s are those events whose nature, severity, or 
frequency is inconsistent with what is known about the patient’s prior medical 
history, the possible adverse effects of HSCT and the safety profile of abatacept. 
On the other hand there are many expected adverse events  in HSCT for patients 
with hematological malignancies. Expected adverse events usually considered to 
be related to intensive pre- transplant conditioning, allogeneic grafts and graft 
versus host disease prophylaxis with a calcineurin inhibitor and methotrexate 
include serious bacterial and fungal infections, veno- occlusive disease, 
complications arising from GVHD and its treatment, idiopathic pneumonia 
syndrome and complications arising from oral or gastrointestinal mucositis. Such 
event s may be deemed expected. Adverse events associated with the previous 
treatment of or the post -transplant relapse of a patient’s malignancy may, likewise, 
be deemed expected.  
Abatacept Acute GVHD Phase II Trial Version 1/30/2019 
 
 58  
d. Unanticipated problems (UP) include unexpected adverse events and also  
unexpect ed problems, events, or new information which are not adverse events 
but which indicate that research participants or others are at greater risk of harm 
than previously believed prior to recognition of the unanticipated problem.  
 
e. Other immediately reportable events (IRE):   Hypersensitivity and other 
infusional reactions to the study drug that do not meet criteria for an SAE will be 
considered an immediately reportable event and shall be reported according to the 
guideline below (4.5 c)    
 
b) Characterizing an adverse event : Adverse events will be described using event terms 
and severity grading from the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) version 4. The expectedness of the event (see above) and the relation of the 
event to the study drug shall also be characterized.  
 
The relation or attribution  of the event to the investigational product may be 
characterized as follows:  
• definitely  related, clearly associated with study drug 
• probably related, likely associated with study drug 
• possibly related, may be associated with study drug 
• unlikely to be related, or  
• definitely not  related to the study drug 
Because this is a blinded, placebo controlled trial, the ability of investigators to assess 
the attribution for most events will be limited.  In most cases, then, assigning an 
attribution of definitely or probably related will be inappropriate.  
 
 
c) Reporting of s erious adverse events, unanticipated problems and immediately 
reportable events: Guidelines for reporting SAEs, IRE s and UPs are outline in Table 
8A.

Local IRBs are required to be notified of reported SAEs, UPs and IREs by [CONTACT_756402].   
 
d) Monitoring of SAEs, unexpected problems and IREs: The trial coordinator will notify 
[CONTACT_756419], the protocol chair and sponsor of the trial, [CONTACT_756420], the clinical 
vice-chair, and the chair of the PBMTC DSMC within three business days of receiving a 
report.  
 
e) Reporting of non- serious adverse events:  For non- serious adverse events only those 
that are unexpected are required to be reported. They shall be reported using the AE 
eCRF to Brandi Bratrude who will notify [CONTACT_756421], the protocol chair and sponsor and [CONTACT_756422] the cl inical vice -chair.  All such events will be tabulated for routine meetings of the 
DSMC.

Safety reports: Written IND safety reports will be submitted to the FDA by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Kean, the IND 
sponsor, fo r serious ,unexpected suspected adverse reactions within [ADDRESS_1035104]. Kean 
will make an assessment of whether the event constitutes an unanticipated problem posing 
risks to subjects or others (UP). She will provide her assessment to the Dana- Farber Cancer 
Institute IRB , which, in turn will make a final determination.  If the Dana- Farber Cancer Institute  
IRB determines an event is a UP it will notify the appropriate regulatory agencies and 
institutional officials.  
 
4.6 Unblinding of study assignment : in situations where the treating physician believes that 
knowledge of the treatment assignment will clearly enhance patient care, the treating physician 
should make all efforts to  contact [CONTACT_756404]- chair of clinical oversight, who will 
direct the local study  pharmacist to unblind the treating physician. However, if the urgency of the 
clinical situation demands it, the treating physician can direct the pharmacist to unblind him or 
her without prior consultation with the study chair or vice- chair.  All members of the study 
committee will remain blinded to assignment.

mix (Make sure all bubbles have dissolved before using Coulter Counter).  
 
 
Freezing PBMCs:  
1. While counting cells, centrifuge cells at 1200 RPM for 10 minutes at room temperature, 
9-9 acceleration/deceleration  
 
2. Alternative Method for Manually Counting the cells using a haemocytometer.  
a. Add 10ul of cells from the 10ml cell suspension to 90ul of 0.4% trypan blue dye 
for a dilution of 1:10  
b. Count the cells in 3 squares and take an average and perform the following 
calculations:  
i. Number o f cells counted X 10 (the dilution factor)X 104= cells/ml 
ii. ________cells/ml x 1 0ml= ________x106 Total  cells 
(Example:  average of 120 cells per square. Cell concentration will 
calculate out to be 12 x106 cells/ml.  Then, multiply by 10 (because your 
cell suspension is 10ml) to 120 x106 total cells)  
 
c. Determine the number of 1mL aliquots you want to freeze based on the number 
of cells that you have purified. NOTE: If possible, a minimum of 10x106 and no 
more than 30x106 cells per aliquot  
 
d. The number of tubes multiplied by 1mL is the total volume you will be freezing.

 65 5.2.  Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis of abatacept :   
 
5.2.1 Serum peak and trough abatacept levels will be measured by [CONTACT_6428].  Samples 
for this testing will be obtained at the following time points: day - 1 (pre -infusion and post -
infusion);  day +5, day +14, day +21, day +28 (pre -infusion and post -infusion) , day +35, day +42, 
day +63 , day +100, day +180, day +270, day +365.   
 
5.2.2 Peripheral blood CD20+ B cells and CD11c+ antigen presenting cells will be 
monitored for express ion of CD80 and CD86 (the targets of abatacept) to determine the 
pharmacodynamic profile of the abatacept dosing regimen, as previously described.54 Samples 
for this testing will be obtained at the following time points: pre -conditioning (within 30 days of 
the start of conditioning), day +14,  day +28 , day + 63, +100, +180, + 270, +365.    
 
5.3  Immune Monitoring:  
Immune reconstitution studies:  Multicolor flow cytometry (9- 10 colors) will be performed to 
determine the character and the pace of immune recovery in all transplanted patients in 
comparison to both the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s baseline values and the baseline values of the donor. The 
relative perc entages, as well as absolute numbers (based on TruCount flow cytometry and 
CBC) of the following leukocyte populations will be determined. (1)  T cells:  CD3+ CD20 - 
CD14 -. (2)  CD4+ or CD8+ T cells:  CD4+ CD8 - or CD4 - CD8+ CD3+ CD20 - CD14 -.  (3)  B 
cells:  CD20+ CD3 - cells.  (4)  NK cell subsets:   CD3- CD20 - CD16+ CD56 - cells,  CD3 - CD20 - 
CD16+ CD56+ cells,  CD3 - CD20 - CD16 - CD56+ cells .  (5)  Naïve T cells:   CD3+ CD20 - CD4+ 
CD8- (or CD4 - CD8+) CCR7+ CD45RA+. (6) Central memory T cells: CD3+ CD20 - CD4+ CD8 - 
(or CD4 - CD8+) CCR7+ CD45RA -.  (7)  Effector memory T cells:   CD3+ CD20 - CD4+ CD8 - (or 
CD4- CD8+) CCR7 - CD45RA -.  (8)  Effector memory RA T cells:  CD3+ CD20 - CD4+ CD8 - (or 
CD4- CD8+) CCR7 - CD45RA+ , (9) Myeloid Dendritic Cells : CD3-CD20 -CD8-HLA-DR+CD11c+  
CD123 -.  (10)  Plasmacytoid DC: CD3 -CD20 -CD8-HLA-DR+CD11c -CD123 +. 
Samples for this testing will be obtained at the following time points from the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_83437].  Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]: pre- conditioning (within 30 days of the start of conditioning), days, - 1, +5, 
+14, +21, +28, + 63, +100, +180, +270, +365, and at the time of new -onset GvHD or viral 
infection.  Donor:  One peripheral blood sample from the donor will also be obtained for this 
analysis at the time of bone marrow donation.  
 
Monitoring of T cell activation and regulation:  Multicolor flow cytometry will be performed to 
quantify the emergence of T cells displaying both activated and regulatory phenotypes.   
Activated T cells will be defined as follows:  (1) CD38 and HLADR express ion: CD3+ CD20 - 
CD4+ CD8 - (or CD4 - CD8+) HLADR+ CD38+.  (2) Ki67 upregulation and BCl -2 downregulation:   
CD3+ CD20 - CD4+ CD8 -  (or CD4 - CD8+) Bcl2+ Ki67+ (3) Perforin and Granzyme 
upregulation:   CD3+ CD20 - CD4+ CD8 - (or CD4 - CD8+) Perforin+ GranzymeB +. CD 31 
expression will be queried in each of these subpopulations to determine whether the cells are 
new thymic emigrants.  
Samples for this testing will be obtained at the following time points from the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_83437].  Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]: pre- conditioning (within 30 days of the start of conditioning), days, +14, +28, 
+63, +100, +180, +270, +365, and at the time of new -onset GvHD or viral infection.  Donor:  
One peripheral blood sample from the donor will also be obtained for this analysis at the time of 
bone marrow donation.  
 
Regulatory T cells will be defined as follows:  CD3+ CD20 - CD4+ CD8 - CD25high CD127low . 
Where ap propriate, the regulatory phenotype will also be confirmed by [CONTACT_756407]3+.This data will be correlated with clinical data on GVHD and other immune mediated 
Abatacept Acute GVHD Phase II Trial Version 1/30/[ADDRESS_1035112], two- drug 
regimen.  
Samples for this testing will be obtained at the following time points from the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_83437].  Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]: pre- conditioning (within 30 days of  the start of conditioning), days  +14, +28, 
+63, +100, +180, +270, +365, and at the time of new -onset GvHD or viral infection.  Donor:  
One peripheral blood sample from the donor will also be obtained for this analysis at the time of 
bone marrow donation.  
 
Gene array analysis of post -transplant expression profiles:   We will perform transcriptional 
analysis on both whole blood and PBMCs after transplant.  Whole blood transcriptional analysis 
will be performed on a subset of patients (those weighing >50Kg, f rom RNA stabilized in 
PAXgene tubes), with samples obtained at the following time points from the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_83437]:  Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]: pre- conditioning (within 30 days of the start of conditioning), days  -1, +5 +14, 
+21, +28, +63 , +100, +180, +365, and at the time of new -onset GvHD or viral infection.  Donor:  
One peripheral blood sample from the donor will also be obtained for this analysis at the time of 
bone marrow donation.   
Transcriptional analysis will also be performed from PBMCs, which will be obtained at 
the following time points from the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22617]:  Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]:  Samples will be obtained 
at the following time points: pre -conditioning (within 30 days of the start of conditioning), days 
+21, +28, +6 3, +100, +180, +270 and +365, and at the ti me of new -onset GvHD or viral 
infection.  Donor:  one peripheral blood sample from the donor will also be obtained at the time 
of bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell donation.  
For patients over 18 years of age and treated in Atlanta (Emory University  or Children’s 
Healthcare of Atlanta)  or Seattle ( SCCA) who weigh >60Kg, an additional 60cc will be drawn at 
Day +100 and Day +365 to perform gene array and TREC analysis on sorted T cell populations.  
 
Assays for viral -specific T cells:    
 
(1) Quantitative analysis CMV -specific, EBV -specific and BK -specific CD8+ T cells.   
Tetramer -based reagents will be used to measure immune responses against CMV, EBV and 
BK virus (Adenovirus -specific tetramers are not available). These tetramers will be placed into 
standard flow -cytometric assays to enumerate the percentage and absolute number of CMV - or 
EBV- specific CD8+ T cells, as well as the naïve or memory phenotypes (as described above) of 
the viral -specific T cells. Samples for tetramer analysis will be obtained from the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_756326]:  Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]: Samples will be obtained at the following time points: pre -
conditioning (within 30 days of the start of conditioning), days +28, +6 3, +100, +180, +270 and 
+365, and at the time of new -onset GvHD or viral infection.  Donor:  one peripheral blood 
sample from the donor will also be obtained at the time of bone marrow or peripheral blood stem 
cell donation.  
 
 (2) Functional analysis of anti -CMV, anti -EBV and anti -BK protective immunity:   The 
functional integrity of T cells towards CMV,EBV and BK viral antigens will also be determined.  
To perform this analysis, PBMCs will be isolated and both  CD4+ and CD8+ T cells will be 
assessed for their ability to produce functional cytokines (IL- 2, IFN γ and TNF) in response to 
both viral lysates (purchased from Advanced Biotechnologies, Columbia, MD) or viral peptide 
pools (CMV peptides from BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, EBV peptides from Anaspec, Fremont, CA, 
BK peptides will be synthesized at Emory University).  Results in patients receiving the 
augmented, abatacept containing GVHD prophylaxis regimen will be compared to those in the 
patients receiving the standard, two- drug regimen. For this analysis, samples will be obtained as 
follows: Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]: Samples will b e obtained at the following time points: pre- conditioning (within 
Abatacept Acute GVHD Phase II Trial Version 1/30/2019 
 
 67 30 days of the start of conditioning), days +28,  +63, +100, +180, +270 and +365, and at the time 
of new -onset GvHD or viral infection.  Donor:  one peripheral blood sample from the donor wil l 
also be obtained at the time of bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell donation.  
 
(3) Serum cytokine and chemokine analysis:   We will utilize cytometric bead array analysis to 
evaluate cytokine and chemokine secretion into serum in transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. The goal of 
these two techniques is to yield an aGvHD -specific biomarker signature [CONTACT_756418]. The cytokines that will be assessed are based 
on ours and others previous studies 34,55,56 and include the following: IFN γ, TNF,  TNFR1, HGF, 
TGF- b, IL-2, IL-[ADDRESS_1035113], two- drug regimen. Samples for this testing will be 
obtained as follows: Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]: Samples will be obtained at the following time points: pre -
conditioning (within 30 days of the start of conditioning), days +28,  +63, +100, +180, +270 and 
+365, and at the time of new -onset GvHD or viral infection.  Donor:  one peripheral blood 
sample from the donor will also be obtained at the time of bone marrow or peripheral blood stem 
cell donation.  
 
(4) Viral Infection:   PCR testing will be perfor med to monitor for infection from four viruses 
commonly encountered in allogeneic HSCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], CMV, EBV, Adenovirus and BK virus.   
Testing will be performed on blood (all viruses)  and urine ( only BK virus will be measured in 
urine) samples. These results will be correlated with clinical evidence of viral diseases (e.g. 
pneumonitis, enterocolitis, hemorrhagic cystitis, hepatitis, PTLD and marrow failure), and data 
on the rate of reconstitution as well as the function of viral -specific T cells.  Resu lts in patients 
receiving the augmented, abatacept -containing GVHD prophylaxis regimen will be compared to 
those in the patients receiving the standard, two- drug regimen. Samples for this testing will be 
obtained as follows: Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]: Samples will be obtained at the following time points: pre -
conditioning (within 30 days of the start of conditioning), days +28,  +63, +100, +180, +270 and 
+365, and at the time of new -onset GvHD or viral infection.  Donor:  one peripheral blood 
sample from the donor will also be obtained at the time of bone marrow or peripheral blood stem 
cell donation.  
 
Donor immunologic Evaluation:  A peripheral blood sample will be obtained from the donor 
on the day of marrow harvest or peripheral blood collection and will be analyzed with each of 
the modalities discussed above. In addition, EBV and HSV serology will be tested on the donor 
from these research samples.  
 
Marrow or PBSC Graft Evaluation:   A sample (5cc) of the marrow or PBSC graft  and/or the 
empty bag or syringe that held the stem cell product  will be evaluated for immune phenotype 
and virus -specific T cells as described above.    
Calculation of absolute cell counts for manipulated products:  Some products are manipulated 
between the time of arrival at the transplant center and infusion. In some cases, plasma or red 
cells are depleted, while in others, a subset of the product is cryopreserved.  For such products, 
the doses of cell subsets transplanted can be estimated by [CONTACT_756408]. Such a method assumes that travel and 
manipulation of the product did not af fect any cell subset in a selective manner.

 68 6.  APPENDIX 2. Statistical Analysis:  Adopting a Bayesian paradigm and assuming a flat 
uninformative prior distribution, the posterior probability Pr{θ>t|k,n} that the frequency of a 
toxicity event θ  exceeds a given threshold t after n accrued patients and k  observed toxicity 
events is given by  
[CONTACT_88556]{θ>t|k,n} = =1- , where 
is the incomplete beta function, and 
 
is the gamma function.  
Table 9 gives the design operating characteristics under selected values of the true 
probability of PTLD θ. It gives the probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_756327], the expected sample size, and the average sample size given that the trial 
stopped. For example, if the true value of θ  is 0.15, then there is an 86% chance that the 
trial is stopped early and the average sample size is about 47. On the other hand, there is 
a small chance of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_97098] θ  is small; 0.14% chance of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_756328] θ = 0.02. Based on these results, we conclude that the design has good operating 
characteristics for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_756329].

 69 Table 10 gives the design operating characteristics under selected values of the true probability 
of day 100 transplant -related mortality rate  θ. It gives the probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_756330], the expected sample size, and the average sample size given that the trial 
stopped. For example, if the true value of θ is 0.35, then there is an 81% chance that the trial is 
stopped early and the average sample size is about 49. On the other hand, there is a small chance 
of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_97098] θ  is small; 1.2% chance of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_756331] θ  = 0.15. Based 
on these results, we conclude that the design has good operating characteristics for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_756332] 100 transplant -related mortality rate .  
Since these stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_756333], no corrections are needed for multiple 
looks.

 70 7. Appendix 3: Blood Samples from Healthy Volunteers -Healthy volunteers, who are at least 
18 years, will be recruited at Emory University and the Seattle sites including University of 
Washington/Seattle Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/Seattle Cancer Care Alliance/Seattle Children’s 
Research Institute  for blood samples. This blood will be used for quality control for the flow 
cytometry analysis.  Approximately one volunteer will be recruited each week at each of the two 
locations . Up to 5 0cc of blood will be drawn via peripheral venipuncture.  A volunteer may not 
donate more than 50cc of blood per month. . Only the volunteers’ age, sex and race will be 
recorded. Volunteers will receive compensation, a $[ADDRESS_1035114], each time a sample is obtained.  
Written informed consent will be obtained.  
 
8. Appendix 4: Adverse Event Reporting to Bristol -Myers Squibb 
 
• All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) that occur following the subject’s written consent to 
participate in the study through [ADDRESS_1035115] be reported to 
BMS Worldwide Safety.  
• If the BMS safety address is not included in the protocol document (eg, multicenter studies 
where events are reported centrally), the procedure for safety reporting must be 
reviewed/approved by [CONTACT_209703]. Procedures for such reporting must be 
reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_209704].  
• The BMS SAE form should be used to report SAEs. If the BMS form cannot be used, 
another acceptable form (ie, CIOMS or Medwatch) must be reviewed and approved by 
[CONTACT_20444].  The BMS protocol ID number must be included on whatever form is submitted by 
[CONTACT_1034]/Investigator.  
• Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs, whether 
related or not related to study drug, are collected, including those thought to be associated 
with protocol -specified procedures. The investigator should report any SAE occurring after 
these time periods that is believed to be related to study drug or protocol -specified 
procedure. worldwide.safety@bms [EMAIL_6243] In accordance with 
local regulations, BMS will notify investigators of all reported SAEs that are suspected 
(related to the investigational product) and unexpected (ie, not previously described in the 
IB). In the European Union (EU), an event meeting these criteria is termed a Suspected, 
Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R). I nvestigator notification of these events 
will be in the form of an expedited safety report (ESR).  
o Other important findings which may be reported by [CONTACT_114646]: 
increased frequency of a clinically significant expected SAE, an SAE considered 
asso ciated with study procedures that could modify the conduct of the study, lack 
of efficacy that poses significant hazard to study subjects, clinically significant 
safety finding from a nonclinical (eg, animal) study, important safety 
recommendations from a study data monitoring committee, or sponsor decision to 
end or temporarily halt a clinical study for safety reasons.  
o Upon receiving an ESR from BMS, the investigator must review and retain the ESR 
with the IB. Where required by [CONTACT_34342] a central IRB/IEC 
for the study, the sponsor will submit the ESR to the appropriate IRB/IEC. The 
investigator and IRB/IEC will determine if the informed consent  requires revision. 
Abatacept Acute GVHD Phase II Trial Version 1/30/2019 
 
 71 The investigator should also comply with the IRB/IEC procedures for r eporting any 
other safety information.  
o In addition, suspected serious adverse reactions (whether expected or 
unexpected) shall be reported by [CONTACT_756409] (eithe r as expedited and/or 
in aggregate reports ). 
SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, and pregnancies must be reported to BMS 
within [ADDRESS_1035116] be recorded on BMS or an approved form; pregnancies must be 
reported on a Pregnancy Surveillance Form.

If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports are required. (Note: Follow -up 
SAE reports should include the same investigator term(s) initially reported.)  
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new information 
becomes available, a follow -up SAE report should be sent within 24 hours to the BMS (or 
designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report.  
All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization.  
For studies conducted under an Investigator IND in the US include the following:  
For studies conducted under an Investigator IND in the US, any event that is both serious and 
unexpected must be reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as soon as possibl e 
and no later than 7  days (for a death or life- threatening event) or 15  days (for all other SAEs) after 
the investigator’s or institution’s initial receipt of the information. BMS will be provided with a 
simultaneous copy of all adverse events filed with the FDA.  
SAEs should be reported on MedWatch  Form  3500A, which can be accessed at:

• An SAE report should be completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its 
seriousness.  
• For studies with long- term follow -up periods in which safety data are being reported, 
include the timing of SAE collection in the protocol.  
• If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to study drug, but is potentially related 
to the conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous therapy or a complication of 
a study procedure), the relationship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE 
Report Form.  
• If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports are required. (Note: Follow -
up SAE repo rts should include the same investigator term(s) initially reported.)

 72 • If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new information 
becomes available, a follow -up SAE report should be sent within 24 hours to BMS using 
the s ame procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report. All SAEs should be 
followed to resolution or stabilization. All SAEs should be followed to resolution or 
stabilization . 
 
Nonserious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting  
The collection of nonserious AE information should begin at initiation of study drug. All nonserious 
adverse events (not only those deemed to be treatment -related) should be collected continuously 
during the treatment period and for a minimum of [ADDRESS_1035118] results that constitute SAEs should be documented and reported as such.  
The following laboratory abnormalities should be documented and reported appropriately:  
• any laboratory test result that is clinically significant or meets the definition of an SAE  
• any laboratory abnormality that required the subject to have study drug discontinued or

• any laboratory abnormality that required the subject to receive specific corrective therapy.  
Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) -  confirm language with medical team for each product  
Wherever  possible,  timel y confirmation of initial liver-related  laboratory  abnormalities  should 
occu r prior to the reporting of a  potential DILI event.  All occurrences of potential DILIs, 
meeting the defined criteria, must be repor ted as SAEs. Potential drug induced liver injury  is 
defined as:  
• ALT or AST elevation > 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN)  
AND  
• Total  bilirubin  > [ADDRESS_1035119],  without  initial findings  of cholestasis  (elevated serum 
alkaline phosphatase)  
AND  
• No other  immediatel y apparent  possible causes  of AST/ALT  elevation and 
hyperbilirubinemia, including,  but not limite d to, viral hepatitis , pre-existin g chroni c or 
acute liver disease,  or the administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.  
Pregnancy  
If, following initiation of the investigational product, it is subsequently discovered that a study 
subject is pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of investigational product exposure, 
including during at least [ADDRESS_1035120] will 
Abatacept Acute GVHD Phase II Trial Version 1/30/2019 
 
 73 be permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner (eg, dose tapering if necessary for subject 
safety).  
The investigator must immediately notify Worldwide Safety @BMS of this event via the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form in accordance with SAE reporting procedures.  
Follow -up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal 
outcome and, where applicable, offspring information must be reported on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form [provided upon request from BMS]  
Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study participant should be reported to 
BMS. Information on this pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form.  
Overdose 
An overdose is defined as the  accidental or intentional administration of any dose of a product 
that is considered both excessive and medically important. All occurrences of overdose must be 
reported as an SAE.  
Other Safety Considerations  
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinations, electrocardiograms, 
x-rays, and any other potential safety assessments, whether or not these procedures are required 
by [CONTACT_760], should also be recorded as a nonserious or serious AE, as appropriate, and 
reported accordingly.

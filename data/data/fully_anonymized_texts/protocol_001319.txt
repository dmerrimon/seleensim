 3 / 5 o   [IP_ADDRESS] Pulse rate ACCURACY   NOTE: This study has been designed per ISO [ZIP_CODE]-2-61:2017, and it has been also designed to respond to the recommendations on subject safety added on ISO [ZIP_CODE]-2-61:2011.  Since ISO [ZIP_CODE]-2-61:2011 has been updated as ISO [ZIP_CODE]-2-61:2017 with no changes in the requirements for conducting the study and demonstrating SpO2 and PR accuracy, this study results can be referred for demonstrating SpO2 and PR accuracy per ISO [ZIP_CODE]-2-61:2011 as well as per ISO [ZIP_CODE]-2-61:2017.  This study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, ISO [ZIP_CODE]:2011 and :2020.  2. Subjects  This study is performed on volunteers who have previously been determined to be healthy enough for this study, have signed an informed consent form and met the following IRB requirements.  These volunteers are compensated by [CONTACT_59290].  Point of enrolment is defined as time at which subjects sign and date the informed consent form and screening based on subject demography and inclusion/exclusion criteria is complete. Expected duration of each subject’s participation will be about [ADDRESS_922482] subjects are:  1. Both male and female subjects who can give written informed consent 2. Healthy subjects capable of undergoing controlled hypoxemia to the levels outlined in the desaturation profile below 3. Meeting the demographic requirements listed above.  The exclusion criteria for the test subjects are:  1. Age below 18 or over 50 2. Pregnant women 3. Significant arrhythmia 4. Blood pressure above 150 systolic or 90 diastolic 5. carboxyhemoglobin levels over 3% 6. Subjects whom the investigator consider ineligible for the study.  At least [ADDRESS_922483], a series of desaturation runs are performed.  Run 1 starts with a stabilized period at room air and is followed by [CONTACT_59291].  Run 2 starts with a stabilized period at 100% and is followed by [CONTACT_59291].  The following are value targets:  Run 1 room air, 92%, 87%, 82%, 77%, 72% Run 2 100%, 93%, 88%, 83%, 78%, 73%  The objective of these targets is to spread the data points evenly over the desired range.  Achieving them exactly is not important, though every effort will be made to be within 2%.  The SpO2 value is reduced by [CONTACT_26129] a mixture of medical air and nitrogen, controlled by [ADDRESS_922484] not changed more than 1 % for 20 seconds (they do not have to agree with each other).  Each desaturation plateaus should not exceed [ADDRESS_922485] sample is

Each run should take Between [ADDRESS_922487]’s demographic data and CO-oximeter values will be collected using specific data collection forms.  4. Reference Data  The blood samples will be analyzed using a Radiometer ABL90 co-oximeter.  The co-oximeter should be quality control checked at the study site to be functioning properly before use.  The heart rate will be measured using a Nihon Kohden PVM-[ADDRESS_922488] instruments will be the TL-273TA Neonatal and Adult disposable probe, the TL-535U Neonatal disposable probe, the TL-281T-BLK1 Adult disposable probe, and the TL-271TA-2 Adult disposable probe.  These probes will be arranged as follows:  On the left-hand side  Subject 1 + 4 + 7 + [ADDRESS_922489] 2 + 5 + 8 + [ADDRESS_922490] 3 + 6 + 9 +[ADDRESS_922491] 1 + 4 + 7 + [ADDRESS_922492] 2 + 5 + 8 + [ADDRESS_922493] 3 + 6 + 9 +[ADDRESS_922494] been proven to minimize the risk of any problems during the study.

 5 / [ADDRESS_922495]’s safety and correct data recording.  The test will be discontinued when a subject requests to withdraw from the study or the Co-investigator will terminate the desaturation procedure and/or a subject’s participation in the study because of the reasons including: 1) the subject experiences unexpected oxygen desaturation or 2) the subject loses consciousness.  Risks associated with participation in the study include the following: a. Risks of arterial cannulation include bleeding, infection, nerve injury and bruising at the site of catheter insertion.  There are also remote risks of an allergic reaction from the lidocaine used for local anesthesia, or the development of arterial spasm, dissection, or thrombosis. b. The risks of the brief exposures to hypoxia are include feeling short of breath, headache, and dizziness.  Brief loss of consciousness may occur but is not expected at the levels of oxygen targeted for these tests.  Nihon Kohden has determined that there is no residual risk associated with the test devices. Nihon Kohden will be responsible for maintaining the test devices.  Monitoring will be performed by [CONTACT_59293].  7. Data Analysis  Collected data used for data analysis will be reviewed by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_59286]. Data will be retained by [CONTACT_59294].  Data from subjects who did not complete the protocol will be thrown out.  Also, if subject’s carboxyhemoglobin level is confirmed to be over 3% during or after the study, data from the subject will be thrown out.  Missing data will not be supplemented.  Data points at a plateau where a co-oximeter output changes over 2% saturation will be thrown out.  Data from unstable pulse wave signal due to the motion artifact or observed subject motion will be thrown out.   SpO2 data will be reduced using the ARMS method and accuracy will be reported as the ARMS deviation between the co-oximeter and the test instruments for all points gathered from each sensor.     PR data points where heart rate changes over 4bpm for [ADDRESS_922496] instruments for all plateaus gathered from each sensor. Accuracy will be determined by [CONTACT_59295] (PRi) to the heart rate obtained from an electrocardiography reference device (HRRi) and calculating the arithmetic root mean square (Arms) error value as follows:     All records of this study related to TL-273TA, TL-535U, TL-281T-BLK1, and TL-271TA-[ADDRESS_922497] devices.  Data will be statistically analyzed by [CONTACT_59297]. The laboratory will provide a summarized report for TL-273TA, TL-535U, TL-281T-BLK1, and TL-271TA-2, using the data recorded by [CONTACT_59298] 510K submission.

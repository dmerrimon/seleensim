Study Number:  LBS-POI-201 Study Phase:  2 
Clinical Sites:  
Approximately  15 sites in the [LOCATION_002]   
Study Rationale:  
The purpose of this study is to establish preliminary evidence of the efficacy, safety, and 
tolerability of LB1148 for the treatment of post -operative ileus and intra -abdominal adhesions 
in subjects undergoing elective bowel resection.  
Primary Objective:   
To compare the change from baseline in extent and severity of intra -abdominal adhesions 
among subjects treated with LB1148 or placebo.  
Secondary Objectives:  
The secondary objectives of this study are to  determine the following among subjects treated 
with LB1148 or placebo : 
• Compare time from surgical closure to resolution or appearance, as appropriate, of 1 or 
more of the components common to gastrointestinal ( GI) dysfunction following elective 
bowel resection with a planned stoma.  
• Compare number of hours to GI2.  
• Compare number of hours to GI3.  
• Compare number of hours to resolution of POI.   
• Compare hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577] (LOS, recorded in hours) through Discharge or Day 14 
(whichever comes first).   
• Compare the incidence of intra -abdominal adhesions following the second surgery among 
subjects treated with LB1148 or placebo.  
• Compare the extent and severity of intra -abdominal adhesions following the second 
surgery among subjects treated with LB1148 or placebo.  
• Compare change from baseline in incidence, extent, and severity of intra -abdominal 
adhesions among subjects treated with LB1148 or placebo who had adhesions observed at 
the time of the first surgery.  
• Assess the safety and tolerability of LB1148 in subjects undergoing elective bowel 
resection.

Phase 2 Protocol Amendment # 6:  LBS -POI-[ADDRESS_783936] 202 2 Confidential  Palisade Bio, Inc.  Exploratory Objectives:   
The exploratory objectives of this study are to determine if LB1148 reduces  the: 
• Post-operative abdominal pain . 
• Incidence of  bowel obstruction th rough [ADDRESS_783937] -operatively.  
• Incidence of  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_134577]-admittance  throu gh [ADDRESS_783938] -operatively.  
• Volume of b lood product tra nsfusion s on the day of surgery.  
Study Design:  
This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, parallel, placebo -controlled, proof -of-concept, 
adaptive design, Phase 2 study to evaluate LB1148  for return of GI function, reduction of POI 
and intra -abdominal adhesions  in subjects undergoing elective bowel resection  with a planned 
stoma .   
Subjects scheduled for elective bowel resection, aged 18 to 80 years inclusive, will be 
screened within 42 days of randomization (Study Day -1).  Subjects who meet all inclusion 
and no exclusion criteria, and provide written informed consent, will be stratified by: 1) 
surgical approach (either minimally invasive technique or laparotomy) and 2) with or without 
a planned stoma, and then randomize d to receive a split oral liquid dose of LB1148 or placebo 
(polyethylene glycol [PEG], glucose, and electrolytes) i n a in a 1:1 ratio.  
All subjects will receive 350 mL of study drug 6 -10 and 2 -6 hours prior to surgery (Study Day 
1/2).  Subjects will then undergo the first surgery.  At the time of surgical closure, the 
investigator will determine the incidence, extent, and severity of adhe sions using the Intra -
Abdominal Adhesion Extent and  Severity Assessment Worksheet (Appendix 5 ). 
Subjects will be assessed for safety and tolerability, including AEs, physical exam, vital signs, 
clinical lab tests (chemistry, coagulation, and hematology) while in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_573518] 
30.  Subjects will be monitored for return of bowel function whil e in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_594232].  
Within [ADDRESS_783939] is not ready for the 
second surgery by 8 months, the investigator may consult with Medical Monitor to obtain 
window approval.  
Unless required for safety reasons or protocol compliance, all s ubjects , Investigators, and 
study site personnel will remain blinded to the identity of the treatment from time of 
randomization until final database lock.

1.1. Summary  
During abdominal surgery, surgeons handle, manipulate, and often make incisions in the bowel.  
These actions can create bruising, lesions, and microscopic damage to the bowel ( Thomas et al., 
2004 ), which may allow digestive enzymes to cross the intestinal mucosal barrier potentially 
resulting in injury both locally and remotely.  Although normally not life threatening, this 
digestive enzyme leak during surgery exacerbates local tissue and organ da mage.  Due to 
proximity to the leak, the bowel is one of the most seriously affected organs.  Leaking digestive 
enzymes may delay return of normal gastrointestinal (GI) function, le ad to a lack of motility in 
the intestine (ileus), and promote the formation of intestinal scar tissue (adhesions).   
LB1148 contains tranexamic acid ( TXA ) as the active ingredient, a synthetic lysine amino acid 
derivative that is best known as a plasminogen activator inhibitor ( DeLano et al., 2013 ) in the 
antifibrinolytic pharmaceutical class.  In addition to being an anti -fibrinolytic, TXA is also a 
broad -spectrum  serine protease inhibitor with inhibitory activity against trypsin, chymotrypsin, 
elastase, enterokinase, as well as others .  This activity appears to be independent of plasminogen 
inhibition or activity.  The pharmacology  as a serine protease inhibitor  is what is believed to 
allow TXA to preserve GI integrity during periods of mucosal barrier disruption.  When 
administered enterally in preclinical studies, LB1148 inhibits key digestive enzymes in the 
lumen of the small intestine and helps preserve the gut barrier during acute periods of 
perturbation, shock, hypoperfusion, and ischemia  (refer to the LB1148 Investigator’s Brochure 
[IB] for further detail) .  The key is the oral/enteral administration of LB1148 allo wing TXA to 
inhibit the digestive enzymes in the lumen of the bowel and to halt the digestive enzymes 
proteolytic activity against the intestine and villi.  Intravenous (IV) administration of TXA does 
not allow TXA to reach therapeutic levels in the lumen of the small intestine and does not 
demonstrate a therapeutic benefit to preserving the mucosal barrier during times of perturbation.   
All of the components in the LB1148 formulation are approved for use in humans and have 
well-characterized and established safety profiles.  As of April 2016, PubMed lists [ADDRESS_783958] -marketing experience.  TXA is routinely given in 
doses up to 10 g by [CONTACT_594261] 8 days of consecutive oral administration  in patients undergoing 
dental surgery  with an acceptable safety and tolerability profile  (Section 1.4).   
The components of LB1148 are reconstituted in water (700 mL final volume) prior to oral or 
enteral administration.  For this study, LB1148 will be orally administered once via a split dose 
prior to surgery.  This clinical study is designed to determine if administration of LB1148 prior 
to surgery will reduce the GI complications and GI dysfunction follo wing elective bowel 
resection.  
LB1148   
Phase 2 Protocol Amendment # 6:  LBS -POI-[ADDRESS_783959]-operative ileus ( POI), a 
transient cessation of bowel motility.  Prolonged POI is a serious complication of abdominal 
surgery, resulting in increased morbidity, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577], and costs.  Post -surgical 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_594235] 4 -6 days longer t han for patients who do  not 
develop POI, resulting in a major burden on patients and health care providers each year ( Berger 
et al., 2015 ; Goldstein et al., 2007 ; Iyer et al., 2009 ; Jakobsen et al., 2014 ). 
Although POI is common after abdominal surgery, there is no widely agreed upon definition in 
the literature.  The 2006 Clinical Consensus  defines POI as “transient cessation of coordinated 
bowel motility after surgical intervention, which prevents effective transit of intestinal contents 
or tolerance of oral intake ”.  The 2006 Clinical Consensus defines primary POI as occurring in 
the absence of any precipi[INVESTIGATOR_594236], whereas secondary POI occurs in the presence of 
a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_594237] (bow el obstruction, infection, etc.).  The 2006 Clinical Consensus 
also defined 3 types of POI:  
1. Panintestinal ileus (no flatus or bowl movement, presence of nausea and vomiting);  
2. Upper GI symptoms (nausea, vomiting and flatus present), and  
3. Lower GI (no flatus or bowel movement, tolerance of diet).  
The mechanism of POI remains elusive and is likely multifactorial, involving the central nervous 
system (CNS, specifically the autonomic nervous system), inflammation (mast cell inflammatory 
process), the enteric nervous system, hormones, neuropeptides, anesthesia, narcotics a nd 
digestive enzymes ( 2006 Clinical Consensus ; Gan et al., 2015 ; Iyer et al., 2009 ; Jakobsen et al., 
2014 ; Kalff et al., 1998 ; Kraft et al., 2010 ; Ludwig et al., 2008 ; Vather et al., 2013 ; Vather et al., 
2014 ; Vather et al., 2015 ; Wolthius et al., 2016 ).   
POI prevention strategies include the type of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] ( Gan et al., 2015 ; Berger et al., 2015 ) and 
anesthesia used ( Goldstein et al., 2007 ).  Nursing prevention strategies include early patient 
ambulation, early introduction of a peroral diet, selective use of a NG tube, and the use of 
non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467] ( 2006 Clinical Consensus ).  Additionally, Entereg® (alvimpan) has been 
approved for use in the US as a gut motility stimulator to restore gut function after surgery.  
1.3. Intra -abdominal Adhesion Formation and Impact  
The post -operative intra -abdominal adhesions (referenced as adhesion s herein) develop in the 
abdomen following abdominal or pelvic surgery and are found in up to 95% of patients who have 
subsequent surgery.  Adhesions are a normal response to injury of the tissue surfaces during 
surgery, and although adhesions may have some beneficial effec ts, they can increase risk for 
complications, cause significant morbidity, and impose technical difficulties for subsequent 
abdominal surgeries.  Adhesions are fibrous ‘b ridges’ or bands that join intra -abdominal organs 
LB1148   
Phase 2 Protocol Amendment # 6:  LBS -POI-[ADDRESS_783960] 202 2 Confidential  Palisade Bio, Inc.  (Ghonge a nd Gho nge, 2014 ).  Traditionally, adhesion formation is thought to be a result of a 
complex interaction of cytokines, growth factors, cell adhesion molecules, neuropeptides, and 
numerous other factors secreted by [CONTACT_594262].   
Adhesions are known to have a significant impact on post -surgical quality of life for people 
worldwide .  Adhesions may result in small bowel obstruction, female infertility, chronic 
abdominal pain, and increased difficulty with subsequent surgery and intervention costs ( Ghonge 
and Ghonge, 2014 ; Ward and Panitch, 2011 ; DeCherney and Kumar, 2015 ).  A number of 
animal studies and human interventional studies have evaluated a variety of techniques and 
materials designed to reduce and prevent postsurgical adhesi ons.  Prevention strategies include 
mechanical (solid), liquid and gel, and pharmaceutical barriers ( Ward, 2011 ).  To date, only a 
handful of agents have been proven safe and effective in clinical trials, and few have generated 
abundant evidence to be adopted for routine use.  
1.4. Rationale for Use of LB1148  
The intestinal mucosal barrier plays a key role in both acute critical care medical conditions as 
well as burdensome chronic diseases.  Healthy maintenance of the intestinal mucosal barrier 
requires oxygenation and blood flow  and avoidance of mechanical or physical injury .  Potent 
digestive enzymes are maintained within the intestine as long as normal blood flow continues 
and no damage or disturbances to the wall occur.   
Breakdown of the intestinal mucosal barrier can be produced by [CONTACT_594263].  These 
include prolonged low blood pressure ([BP] e.g. during shock), disruption of blood flow (e.g. 
during ischemia), and physical and mechanical perturbations (e.g. during trauma or abdominal 
surgery).   
One of the key advances toward the use of LB1148 to reduce post -operative complications was 
the learning that with more subtle perturbations of the mucosal barriers, such as during 
abdominal surgery, intraluminal pancreatic digestive enzymes played a role in the pathology of 
GI dysfunction.  When the mucosal barrier was disturbed, the pancreatic digestive enzymes had a 
profound effect on the tissue the enzymes contact[CONTACT_231159], namely, the intestine.  Importantly, the 
enterotomy into the bowel during resecti on and anastomosis is sufficient to release pancreatic 
digestive enzymes, which delays the return of gut function.  Perioperative enteral administration 
of LB1148 in preclinical models was sufficient to reduce the delayed return of GI function.  
Furthermor e, the reduction in pancreatic digestive enzyme -induced tissue damage had a 
profound reduction in post -operative adhesion formation.  Together, these preclinical studies 
provide evidence that blocking pancreatic digestive enzymes with LB1148 in the intesti nal 
lumen reduces local tissue damage, preserves GI function, and reduces adhesion formation.   
LB1148   
Phase 2 Protocol Amendment # 6:  LBS -POI-[ADDRESS_783961] notably in the surgical se tting.  From a safety and 
tolerability perspective, the use of a single  oral, 7.5 g dose is within the amount of TXA routinely 
used in medical practice.  The Canadian Cyklokapron Monograph  indicates an oral dose of 
100 mg/kg for 8 days for patients undergo ing dental surgery.  Assuming a patient weighs 75 kg, 
this would equate to a 7.5 g dose.  Since LB1148 contains TXA as the active ingredient, relevant 
TXA -related safety information from the Canadian Cyklokapron Monograph, the Lysteda 
Package Insert  (oral administration), and the Australian Public Assessment  is provided in the 
LB1148 Investigator’s Brochure  (IB).  Information related to the pharmacokinetics (including 
absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) , as well as supporting nonclinical data are 
provided in detail in the LB1148 IB.    
Additionally,  Palisade Bio  has sponsored a Phase 2 study evaluating the use of LB1148.  This 
was a multicenter, randomized, double blind, parallel, placebo -controlled study evaluating 
enteral administration of LB1148 in subjects with septic shock.  A total of 8 subjects were 
enrolled and completed the study through Day 28 , however t he Sponsor terminated this study 
due to slow enrollment.  Details from this study are also provided in the LB1148 IB.

Phase 2 Protocol Amendment # 6:  LBS -POI-[ADDRESS_783967] 202 2 Confidential  Palisade Bio, Inc.  INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1. Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, parallel, placebo -controlled, proof -of-concept, 
adaptive design, Phase 2 study to evaluate LB1148 for return of  GI function, reduction of POI 
and intra -abdominal adhesions in subjects undergoing elective bowel resection with a planned 
stoma.   
Figure 1  Illustration of Study Design for Protocol LBS -POI-201 
 
Subjects scheduled for elective bowel resection, aged 18 to 80 years inclusive, will be screened 
within 42 days of randomization (Study Day -1).  Subjects who meet all inclusion and no 
exclusion criteria, and provide written informed consent, will be  stratified  by: 1)  surgical 
approach (either minimally invasive technique or laparotomy) and 2) with or without a planned 
stoma , and then randomized to receive a split oral liquid dose  of LB1148 or placebo 
(polyethylene glycol [PEG] , glucose, and electrolytes) i n a in a 1:1 ratio.  
All subjects will receive 350 mL of study drug 6 -10 and 2 -6 hours prior to surgery (Study Day 
1/2).  Subjects will then undergo the first surgery.  At the time of surgical closure, the 
investigator will determine the incidence, extent, and severity of adhe sions using the Intra -
Abdominal Adhesion Extent and Severity Assessment Worksheet ( Appendix 5 ). 
Subjects will be assessed for safety and tolerability, including AEs, physical exam, vital signs, 
clinical lab tests (chemistry, coagulation, and hematology) while in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_573518] 30.  
Subjects will be monitored for return of bowel function whil e in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_594238].  

LB1148   
Phase 2 Protocol Amendment # 6:  LBS -POI-[ADDRESS_783968] is not ready for the second surgery by 8 
months, the investigator may consult with Medical Monitor to obtain window approval.  
Unless required for safety reasons or protocol compliance, all subjects, Investigators, and study 
site personnel will remain blinded to the identity of the treatment from time of randomization 
until final database lock.   
The Schedule of Assessments is provided in Appendix 1  and the study endpoints are in 
Section  2.2.   
3.2. Rationale for Study Design , Control Group , and Perioperative Standardization  
Study Design :  This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, parallel, placebo -controlled, 
proof -of-concept, adaptive design,  Phase [ADDRESS_783969]  will receive in order to avoid any bias in the study assessments.  
Control  Group :  Placebo , superimposed on current standard of care,  is an appropriate control 
for this study.   
Perioperative Standardization of Care:   There are no internationally recognized perioperative 
standards of care for general bowel resection subjects .  Although the Enhanced Recovery After 
Surgery (ERAS) Society has provide suggestions for improved perioperative care for GI surgical 
patients, these standards have been inconsistently adopted by [CONTACT_594265]  
(ERAS  website ).  Often each surgical center has its own , site-specific practices that best fit its 
patients and standard s of care.   This has led to heterogeneous perioperative care across sites and 
countries.   To improve the homogeneity of perioperative care in this study  and improve the 
opportunity to detect the effect of treatment, the following standards are being set forth:  
• Subjects must receive:   
o Venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) prophylaxis according to each institute’s regional 
antithombotic guidelines.  
• Subjects must not receive:   
o Solid foods consumed for the 8 hours prior to induction of surgical anesthesia ; 
o Alternative carbohydrate drinks 8 hours prior to induction of surgical anesthesia; study 
drug will replace carbohydrate drinks within that time period ;

Phase 2 Protocol Amendment # 6:  LBS -POI-[ADDRESS_783976] 202 2 Confidential  Palisade Bio, Inc.  STUDY TREATMENTS  
5.1. Description of Treatments  
5.1.1.  Study Drug  
LB1148 contains 7.5 g TXA,  polyethylene glycol ( PEG ), glucose, and electrolytes.  A  dose of 
700 mL of LB1148 will be adminis tered orally (refer to Section 5.2). 
5.1.2.  Placebo  
The placebo contains PEG, glucose, and electrolytes.  A dose of 700  mL of placebo will be 
administered orally (refer to Section 5.2). 
5.2. Treatment  Administ ration  
Eating , bowel prep, and drinking will be held 1 hour before and 1 hour after study drug 
administration.  
A total of 700 mL of study drug should be completely consumed orally 2 -10 hours prior to 
induction of surgical anesthesia .  Study drug will be provided to subjects in 2 bottles, 
approximately 350 mL in each bottle:  
• Subject will consume the first 350  mL 6-10 hours prior to surgery.   
• Subject will consume the second  350 mL 2 -6 hours prior to surgery.  
5.3. Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subjects  
The 7.5 g dose was chosen for safety and efficacy reasons.  The minimally effective 
concentrations of TXA in the lumen of the small intestine were 45  mM ( Delano et al., 2013 ) and 
56.5 mM ( Chang et al., 2012 ).  LB1148 is formulated at a concentration of 68.2 mM (7.5 g TXA 
per 700  mL solution) .    
In preclinical testing, LB1148  demonstrated efficacy when administered 2 hours prior to 
abdominal surgery.  For this study, study drug  will be administered 2-10 hours prior to 
abdominal surgery  (refer to  Section 5.2 and Section 6.8).  Additional information regarding dose 
selection, safety , and preclinical efficacy can be found in the LB1148 IB.   
The ASA Practice Guidelines for Preoperative Fasting are based on a synthesis and analysis of 
the current literature, expert and practitioner opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], open forum commentary, a nd clinical 
feasibility data.  These Guidelines are recommendations to assist the practitioner and patient in 
making health care decisions .  The guidelines currently read that patients should fast from clear 
liquids for [ADDRESS_783977] from regular meals for 8 hours pre -operatively  
(ASA , 2011 ; Korpman et al., 2012 ).  This protocol was designed to be in alignment with ASA 
Practice Guidelines.   
LB1148   
Phase 2 Protocol Amendment # 6:  LBS -POI-[ADDRESS_783978] 202 2 Confidential  Palisade Bio, Inc.  5.4. Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Subjects who meet all study criteria for enrollment will be randomly assigned to either the 
investigational drug (LB1148) or placebo treatment group.  Assignment to treatment groups will 
be determined by a computer -generated randomized sequence using an interactive response 
system (IXRS).  All randomized subjects will be divided between the 2 treatment groups  
(LB1148 or placebo) in a 1:1 ratio , stratified by: 1) surgical approach (either minimally invasive 
technique or laparotomy) and 2) with or without a planned stoma .   
5.5. Blinding  
This is a randomized  double -blind study.  The subject ’s coded treatment assignment will be 
provided to the blinded pharmacist or designee by [CONTACT_309364].  The randomization code for 
treatment assignment will be retained by [CONTACT_4150].  
Unless required for safety reasons or protocol compliance, i t is anticipated that there will be little 
need to unblind a subject ’s treatment assignment  at the site level .  Treatment code must not be 
broken except in medical emergencies when the appropriate management of the subject  
necessitates knowledge of the treatment randomization.  Because no known antidote for LB1148 
exists, there should be no medical reason for unblinding at the site.   
The Medical Monitor should be contact[CONTACT_594266] a subject 's 
treatment assignment.  Emergency unblinding for AEs may be performed through the IXRS.  If 
the treatment code is broken, then the Investigator(s) must document and report it to the Sponsor .   
The Sponsor  retains the right to break the code for SAEs that are unexpected and suspected to be 
causally -related to treatment , and that potentially require expedited reporting to regulatory 
authorities.   
The Sponsor  or its designee  intends to unblind t he treatment assignment at the  time of the interim 
analysis; however, the study double blind (subject, Investigator,  and/or designated study site 
team [investigative team]) will remain  intact .  Care will be taken such that unblinded Sponsor 
representative will have no contact [CONTACT_594267] s to any subject data that are not yet 
collected by [CONTACT_20685].  Further, the contract research organization ( CRO ) 
representatives in direct contact [CONTACT_57999] h the investigative team will remain blinded to treatment 
assignment throughout the study.   
5.6. Concomitant Therapy  
The subject  must  not perform any of the following  during study participation :  
• Receive o ther medication containing TXA while receiving study drug ;   
• Receive pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy during the Surgical  Period;   
LB1148   
Phase 2 Protocol Amendment # 6:  LBS -POI-[ADDRESS_783979] 202 2 Confidential  Palisade Bio, Inc.  • Use a combined hormonal contraceptive  and or combined hormonal replacement therapy  
(including combined hormonal pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], patch or vaginal ring) during the 7 day period prior to 
Surgery through the 7 day period following surgery ;   
• Consume solid foods 8 hours prior to induction of surgical anesthesia;  
• Receive alternative carbohydrate drinks.  Study drug will replace carbohydrate drinks within 
8 hours prior to induction of surgical anesthesia . 
• Consume anything by [CONTACT_1966] (NPO) for the 2 hours prior to induction of surgical anesthesia .  
(Exception : daily oral medication such as anti -hypertensive may be taken with small volume 
of water as directed by [CONTACT_5936]).   
• Receive  4% icodextrin (Adept®) or SEPRAFILM during the first surgery  
• Use post -operative alvimopan (also known as Entereg®).  
Otherwise, there are no restrictions with respect to concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_594239].  All 
concomitant medications should be listed in the electronic case report form (eCRF) along with 
the date therapy was initiated and, if applicable, terminated.   
5.7. Restrictions  
5.7.1.  Fluid and Food Intake  
There is no co -administration of food or drink with the study drug .  Eating , bowel preparation,  
and drinking will be held [ADDRESS_783980] agree to use contraception throughout the Follow -Up 
Period of the study (through Day 30).  Acceptable methods include abstinence, intrauterine 
devices , contraceptive implants,  and barrier methods (condom, diaphragm with sperm icide ).   
5.8. Treatment Compliance  
Study drug will be administered either by [CONTACT_594268][INVESTIGATOR_594240] .  Location for administration is dependent on time of surgery and location 
for surgical preparation by [CONTACT_423] , and may differ for participating subject s.   
5.9. Packaging and Labeling  
The Sponsor  will provide study materials to the study pharmacy in 120 mL bottles of either 
active or placebo pow der for reconstitution.  Glucose powder will be provided in a clearly 
labeled 60  mL bottle.  Reconstitution and labeling instructions are provided in the Pharmacy 
Manual.   
LB1148   
Phase 2 Protocol Amendment # 6:  LBS -POI-[ADDRESS_783981] .  The Investigator (or designated pharmacist) 
will maintain records of:  
• The receipt of study drug at the clinical study site;  
• The inventory at the site dispensing product to each subject , and 
• The return of unused cartons to the Sponsor or destruction at the clinical study site . 
During the course of the study , or upon completion or termination of the study, the 
Investigator/pharmacist will return all unused medication to the Sponsor or destroy all unused 
medication at the site according to institutional procedures after recording the relevant 
accountability information.  For drug accountability records, the site w ill provide the  Clinical  
Monitor with a copy of the inventory record and a record of destroyed clinical supplies (on a 
Drug Accountability Log).  The record of destroyed c linical supplies will include information on:  
• All dispensed bottles ; 
• All used and unused bottles returned to the pharmacy;  
• All unused bottles ; 
• All used and unused bottles destroyed in the course of the study;  
• Date(s) of destruction, and 
• Name [CONTACT_148429]/pharmacist.  
During and at the end of the study, all study drug will be reconciled against current inventory and 
the dispensing records as part of routine monitoring visits.  After reconciliation, unused (full) 
bottles will be destroyed at the site per institutional standard operating procedure.  At the end of 
the study, unused, unopened cartons of study drug will be returned or destroyed as instructed by 
[CONTACT_1034], or its designee s.

International Conference on Harmonization ( ICH) Good Clinical Practices  (GCP ).  Informed 
consent must be obtained prior to performing any study -specific procedures.   
6.2. Demographics and Medical History  
Medical history will include significant medical conditions and surgical history, as well as 
baseline signs and symptoms occurring within [ADDRESS_783983]’s diagno sis and reason for requiring a bowel resection will be documented , the planned 
surgical approach for the bowel resection, the planned use of s toma, and  the need for a planned, 
second surgery .  The subject ’s medical history will be collected during the Screening Period ; 
during this review, a Caprini risk factor score will be calculated  (Appendix 8 ).  Each subject’s 
risk factors for VTE will be assessed in order to determine the appropriate VTE regimen 
according to each institute’s regional antithombotic guidelines.  The subject’s prior or current use 
of tobacco will also be collected.  
On the day of the first surgery  (the Surgical  Period) , any changes to subject’s condition that 
affect inclusion/exclusion criteria  will be documented .  Subject must meet all inclusion/exclusion 
criteria at time of the first surgery.   
6.3. Physical Examination  
A complete physical examination  (except for genitourinary unless indicated)  will be performed 
at Screening .  Height will be measured at the Screening visit only.    
From Day [ADDRESS_783984]  – a brief, focused examination of the subject will be performed , including 
lower extremity assessments to identify any clinical symptoms of VTE  and assessment for AEs.  
Each focused examination  will include weight measurements.  
6.4. Surgery Assessment  
During surgery (where applicable), the following data should be recorded:   
• The type of operation . 
• The type of surgical approach (minimally invasive technique or lapar otomy).  
LB1148   
Phase 2 Protocol Amendment # 6:  LBS -POI-[ADDRESS_783985] 202 2 Confidential  Palisade Bio, Inc.  • The location of the surgical incision(s).  
• Surgical time, recorded as:  
o Surgery start time, defined as the time when the initial incision is made, and  
o Surgery end time, defined as when the last suture or staple was placed.   
• Ileostomy mobilization time (defined as the time from skin incision to completion of 
circumferential mobilization and start of prepar ation of ileostomy for closure).  
6.5. Concomitant Medication Assessments  
Concomitant medications, including prescription and over -the-counter drugs, will be recorded  
within [ADDRESS_783986] .  Additionally, any perioperative surgical 
preparation that was given or consumed will be documented, including mechanical bowel prep 
and nutritional supplements (refer to Section  3.2, Section 5.6, and Section 0).  
Blood products administered to the subject  will be documented throughout the same timeframe 
on the Concomitant Medication eCRFs.  Documentation will include start and stop dates and 
reasons for the use.  
Unless otherwise specified in the protocol, administration of other concomitant investigational 
drugs or devices for any indication, other than study drug, is not permitted while on study.  
Additionally, receiving medication with TXA while taking the study drug is prohibited along 
with receiving pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy.  Any therapeutic or surgical procedures 
performed during the study period will be documented.  Documentation will include information 
regarding the date(s), indication(s), desc ription of the procedure(s), and/or any clinical or 
pathological findings.  
6.6. Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include BP (systolic and diastolic measurements), heart rate (HR), respi[INVESTIGATOR_862] (RR) , oxygen saturation, and temperature.  Vital signs will be collected daily from Screening 
through  Post-Operative Day [ADDRESS_783987] be obtained at Screening and confirmed prior to 
randomization for all females of childbearing potential.   
LB1148   
Phase 2 Protocol Amendment # 6:  LBS -POI-[ADDRESS_783988] is still hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  
Appendix 2  lists the specific laboratory tests that will be performed for this study.   
All laboratory evaluations will be conducted at the laboratories located at or associated with the 
clinical site.  Each laboratory will be required to provide up -to-date reference ranges.  Laboratory 
values will be recorded on the eCRF(s).   
Unscheduled laboratory results, from tests pre -specified in this protocol, that are both abnormal 
and clinically significant , as decided by [CONTACT_737], will be recorded on an additional eCRF 
page(s) and the data will be included in the assessment of out -of-range parameters.   
6.8. Study Drug Administration  
A total of 700 mL of study drug should be completely consumed orally 2 -10 hours prior to 
induction of surgical anesthesia as a split dose:  
• For the first study drug administration, subject will consume 350  mL 6 -10 hours prior to 
surgery.   
• For the second study drug administration, subject will consume the remaining [ADDRESS_783989] is given or consumed will be recorded  during the Screening 
and Surgical  Periods .  These include, but are not limited to, mechanical bowel prep, nutritional 
supplements , carbohydrate drinks, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], and analgesia .  As indicated in Section  3.2:   
• Subjects must  receive:   
o VTE prophylaxis according to each institute’s regional antithombotic guidelines.  
• Subjects must  not receive:   
o Solid foods consumed for the 8 hours prior to induction of surgical anesthesia ; 
o Alternative carbohydrate drinks  8 hours prior to induction of surgical anesthesia; study 
drug will replace carbohydrate drinks within that time period ;   
o Anything by [CONTACT_594258] 2 hours prior to induction of surgical anesthesia  (exception: 
daily oral medication such as anti -hypertensive may be taken with small volume of water 
as directed by [CONTACT_5936]) , and     
LB1148   
Phase 2 Protocol Amendment # 6:  LBS -POI-[ADDRESS_783990]  feedback.  This scale can 
be administered either verbally or graphically  by [CONTACT_594269] s ubjects is asked to rate 
their current pain intensity from 0 (“no pain”) to 10 (“worst possible pain  imaginable ”).  The 
NPRS is the method recommended by [CONTACT_594270], Measurement and Pain 
Assessm ent in Clinical Trials  as well as the Expert Working Group for the assessment of pain 
intensity during a clinical study  (Breivik et al ., 2008 ; Caraceni et al., 2002 ).  A change of 
approximately 30% (or 2 points) has been shown to represent a clinically meaningful change in 
pain ( Farrar et al., 2001 ).   
Investigator or delegated site personnel should  use the following statements to ask the subject to 
rate their post-operative abdominal pain:  
1. I would like you to rate your pain on a scale from 0 to 10.  
2. ‘0’ means you have no pain at all.  
3. ‘10’ means the worst possible pain you can imag ine.  
4. What number would you give to your pain?  
A pain assessment will be collected daily starting after Surgery Day [ADDRESS_783991]  (Appendix 4 ). 
6.13. Gastrointestinal  Function Assessment  
Starting on Post-Operative D ay 1, GI function will be assessed to determine return of GI 
function .  Daily GI assessments will be collected until either the subject has had return of GI 
function  or Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] D ischarge .  If, while still in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], GI function deteriorates to the 
point of no longer being able to tolerate an oral diet and pass stool, daily measurements should 
be collected again until the subject has had return of GI function.    
LB1148   
Phase 2 Protocol Amendment # 6:  LBS -POI-[ADDRESS_783992] 202 2 Confidential  Palisade Bio, Inc.  Data for this assessment will  include  but not be limited to :   
• Nausea and vomiting (either subject reported or recorded as presence or absence , date and 
time, including VRS  [Appendix 3 ]),   
• Passing of flatus (either subject reported or Investigator/delegated site personnel reported 
during a 24 -hour calendar day ; date and time of first flatus where only the first observance is 
recorded ; in any instance where subject has post -operative complications and experiences 
ileus as decided by [CONTACT_10670], the next flatus event should be recorded ); 
• Passing of stool from anus or ostomy (recorded as presence or absence  and date and time );  
• Presence of NG/OG tube (including date and time) . 
• Ability to tolerate liquid  diet (liquid diet ordered, subject is able to sustain oral liquid intake 
without need for IV fluid administration, and total liquid volume over a 24 -hour calendar 
day);  
• Ability to tolerate a solid diet  (solid diet ordered and date and time of solid food ingestion 
without significant nausea or vomiting for 4 hours).    
• If a subject experiences a POI event during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], this event will be recorded , 
including date and time  as an AE/SAE.  
6.14. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_594241]:  
• Passage of stool  
• Ability to tolerate solid food and drink comfortably  
• Adequate oral analgesia  
• Subject’s willingness to be discharged.  
Information related to Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_594242] -Surgical  period as:  
• When discharge order is written  (date and time)  
• When subject departs from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  (date and time)  
6.15. Day 30 Follow -Up 
On Day 30 (+7 days), site study staff will contact [CONTACT_594271] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_594243]/or other medical reasons .  If readmission did occur, this event should be recorded as a SAE.   
As it is vital to obtain follow -up data, every effort must be made to contact [CONTACT_594272].   
LB1148   
Phase 2 Protocol Amendment # 6:  LBS -POI-[ADDRESS_783993] 202 2 Confidential  Palisade Bio, Inc.  6.16. Adhesions  Assessment  (Day 0 and at time of second surgery ) 
The surgeon will determine the incidence, extent, and severity of adhesions at the time of 
surgical closure for the first surgery and at the time of opening for the second surgery.   Grading 
of the adhesions (extent and severity) will be performed by [CONTACT_594273] ( Appendix 5 ). 
For each abdominal region , the score of the extent and severity of adhesions are evaluated . The 
surgeon will grade the intra -abdominal adhesions at 9 abdominal region (right upper, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_6331], left upper, left flank, left lower, pelvis, right lower, right flank and central)  and 
when appropriate at 4 areas around the ostomy ( superior, lateral, inferior, and medial).  
(Coccolini et al., 2013 , Dabrowski et al., 2016 , and the Seprafilm Package Insert ). 
For each abdominal region , extent of adhesion formation is scored for adhesions from the 
abdominal wall to bowel  (including abdominal wall to viscera)  and for adhesions from bowel to 
bowel ( including bowel to viscera) as follows:  
0 = no adhesion;  
1 = minimal (<1/3 of the site is covered);  
2 = moderate (1/3 to 2/3 of the site is covered) , or 
3 = extensive (>2/3 of the site is covered).  
 
The severity of the adhesions in the region are graded using the following score:    
0 = no adhesions;  
1 = filmy thickness, avascular;  
2 = moderate thickness, limited vascularity , or  
3 = dense thickness, vascularized.  
At the second surgery  visit the site study staff will determine if the subject experienced a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_594244]/or other medical reasons.  If readmission did occur, this 
event should be recorded as  a SAE.  
6.17. Appropriateness of Measurements  
All procedures used to measure the safety and efficacy of LB1148 in this study are considered to 
be appropriate and necessary to obtain the required safety, tolerability, and efficacy data.  The 
safety assessments used in this study, such as physical exami nation, vital signs, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], 
laboratory assessments, and GI function assessments are widely used and are considered 
appropriate for monitoring subjects’ health and well -being in this type of study.  The measure 
used to evaluate pain levels is a validat ed and widely accepted rating scale used for clinical 
studies evaluating pain.   
 
LB1148   
Phase 2 Protocol Amendment # 6:  LBS -POI-[ADDRESS_783994] .  Following discharge through the second 
surgery visit, any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_594245].  
AEs/SAEs  related to the second surgery will also be collected.   
Investigators are responsible for monitoring the safety of subject s who have entered this study 
and for alerting the Sponsor or its designee s to any event that seems unusual, even if this event 
may be considered an unanticipated benefit to the subject . 
The Investigator is responsible for the appropriate medical care of subject s during the study.  The 
Investigator remains responsible for following, through an appropriate health care option, SAEs 
or AEs that caused the subject  to discontinue before completing the study.  The subject  should be 
followed until the event is resolved or explained.  Frequency of follow -up evaluation is left to the 
discretion of the Investigator.  
7.1. Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject  administered a drug or biologic 
(medicinal) product; the event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the 
administration of the study drug.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including a clinically significant abnor mal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a study drug , whether or not considered related to t he study drug . 
This includes any side effect, injury, toxicity, or sensitivity reaction, and may include a single 
symptom or sign, a set of related symptoms or signs, or a disease.  An AE may also be any 
laboratory abnormality judged to be clinically significant by [CONTACT_594274].   
AEs include the following:  
• All suspected adverse drug reactions.  
• All reactions from medication overdose, abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity, or toxicity.  
• Apparently unrelated illnesses, including the worsening of a pre -existing illness.  
• Injury or accidents.   
Note :  If a medical condition is known to have caused the injury or accident (e.g., a fall 
secondary to dizziness), the medical condition (dizziness) and the accident (fall) should be 
reported as 2 separate AEs.  
• Abnormalities in physiological testing or physical examination (findings that require clinical 
intervention or further investigation beyond ordering a repeat [confirmatory] test).  
LB1148   
Phase 2 Protocol Amendment # 6:  LBS -POI-[ADDRESS_783995] 202 2 Confidential  Palisade Bio, Inc.  • Laboratory abnormalities that are clinically significant and require clinical intervention or 
further investigation (beyond ordering a repeat [confirmatory] test) unless they are associated 
with an already reported clinical event.   
An AE does not include:  
• Medical or surgical procedures (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, transfusion); the 
condition that leads to the procedure is an AE. 
• Pre-existing diseases or conditions present or detected at screening/baseline that do not 
worsen in severity or frequency.  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10800], social and/or convenience admissions).  
• Overdose of either study drug or concomitant medication without any signs or symptoms.  
Throughout the course of the study, every effort should be made to remain alert to possible AEs.  
Subjects should be encouraged to report AEs spontaneously or in response to general, non -
directed questioning.  
With the occurrence of an AE, the primary concern is the safety of the subject .  If necessary, 
appropriate medical intervention should be provided and the study drug discontinued.  Urgent 
safety issues may be discussed with Study Medical Monitor.   
7.2. Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
• Death.  
• A life -threatening AE (i.e., immediate risk of death)  
Note:  The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the subject  was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event, which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
• Prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_257353] -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical judgment, the 
AE may jeopardize the subject  and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one 
of the outcomes listed in this definition.   Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home ; blood dyscrasias 
or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospit alization, or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse . 
LB1148   
Phase 2 Protocol Amendment # 6:  LBS -POI-[ADDRESS_783996]:   POI, thrombotic events, and conditions that cause a prolongation of 
existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54692] a post -surgical complication.   AEs of special interest will be 
reported as either an SAE (refer to Section 7.2) or as an AE (refer to Section 7.1).  
7.4. Venous Thrombosis  
As indicated in the LB1148 IB, nonclinical toxicology data indicates a possible association 
between the use of TXA and thrombosis events.  However, p ost-marketing AE reports in humans 
indicate thromboembolic events are relatively rare.  Since TXA is known to have  an impact on 
blood clotting, thrombotic events will be recorded as an AE/SAE and followed to resolution .  
7.5. Post-Operative Ileus  
Resolution of POI -related symptoms are one of the focuses of this study.  As such, any instance 
of POI will  be recorded as an AE /SAE and followed to resolution.   POI events post -discharge , 
but prior to Day 30 , will also be recorded as an AE/SAE . 
7.6. Post-Surgical Complications   
The impact of study drug on LOS is a secondary endpoint for this study.  As such, a ny post -
surgical complication that prolongs discharge will be recorded as an AE/SAE.   
7.7. Unexpected Adverse Event  
An unexpected AE is any AE that is not identified in nature, severity , or frequency in the current 
LB1148 IB or product information.   
7.8. Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction  
An unexpected adverse drug reaction (U ADR ) is an adverse reaction, the severity of which is not 
consistent with the applicable product information or IB.  All noxious and unintended responses 
to a medical product related to any dose should be considered an UADR.   
• The phrase “responses to a medicinal product” means that a causal relationship between a 
medicinal product and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility (meaning the relationship 
cannot be ruled out).   
• The expression “causal relationship” is meant to convey that in general there are facts, 
evidence,  or arguments to suggest a reasonable causal relationship.  All serious and UADRs 
will have expedited reporting to regulatory agencies following ICH requirements.   
LB1148   
Phase 2 Protocol Amendment # 6:  LBS -POI-[ADDRESS_783997].  Following discharge through the Month 
3 visit, any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_594245].  
AEs/SAEs related to the second surgery will also be collected.   
If a subject  experiences an AE after signing informed consent, but prior to receiving study drug, 
the event will NOT be collected unless the Investigator feels the event may have been caused by 
a protocol procedure.  
In addition, any known untoward event that occurs subsequent to the AE -reporting period that 
the Investigator assesses as related to the study drug should also be reported as an AE.   
7.10. Recording Adverse Events  
All AEs will be documented in the appropriate section of the eCRF s.  Among these AEs, all 
SAEs (refer to Section 7.2) will be additionally documented in th e SAE Report . 
The following will be recorded for each event in the eCRF:  
• A description of the AE in medical terms, not as reported by [CONTACT_423] .  Whenever possible, 
a diagnosis should be given when signs and symptoms are due to common etiology (e.g., 
cough, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and head congestion should be reported as “upper 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416]”).  
• The date of onset (start date).  
• The date of resolution (stop date).  
• The severity as assessed by [CONTACT_594275]  7.11. 
• The causal relationship to study drug as assessed by [CONTACT_737]; the decisive factor in 
the documentation is the temporal relation between the AE and the study drug (refer to 
Section 7.12).  
• Action taken for study drug (none, study drug discontinued, study drug dose reduction, study 
drug delayed).  
• Other action(s) taken (none, concomitant medication given, new or prolonged 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], procedural surgery).  
• The outcome according to the following definitions:  
o Recovered with sequelae;  
o Recovered without sequelae;  
o Ongoing, no therapy;  
o Ongoing, therapy;  
o Died, and  
o Change in toxicity grade/severity.  
LB1148   
Phase 2 Protocol Amendment # 6:  LBS -POI-[ADDRESS_783998] 202 2 Confidential  Palisade Bio, Inc.  • SAE  (as defined in Section 7.2): Yes or No. 
If, in any [ADDRESS_783999] , the same AE occurs on several occasions (unless the AE is continuous and of 
stable grade), then the AE in question will be documented and assessed each time.  For an SAE, 
the information above recorded in the eCRF will also be recorded in the SAE Report.   Only AEs 
that fulfill the criteria for SAEs (refer to Section 7.2) should be recorded in the SAE Report.  
7.11. Assessing Adverse Event Severity  
To ensure there is no confusion or misunderstanding of the difference between the terms 
“serious” and “severe”, which are not synonymous, the following note of clarification is 
provided:  
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, 
moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor 
medical significance (such as severe headache).  This is  not the same as “serious”, which is 
based on subject /event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat 
to a subject ’s life or functioning.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining 
regulatory reporting obl igations.  
All AEs are to be evaluated with respect to severity using  the National Cancer Institute (NCI) 
Common Terminology C riteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)  grading system  (Appendix 7 ). 
Grade refers to the severity of the AE. The CTCAE displays Grades 1 through 5 with unique 
clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline:  
• Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
• Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental Activities of Daily Living ( ADL ). Instrumental ADL refer to 
preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money, 
etc. 
• Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12342]; dis abling; limiting self -care ADL . Self-care ADL 
refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, 
and not bedridden.  
• Grade 4 Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
• Grade [ADDRESS_784000] his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_594246].  Investigators will determine relatedness of an event to study drug based on 
LB1148   
Phase 2 Protocol Amendment # 6:  LBS -POI-[ADDRESS_784001] ’s 
clinical course, previous medical conditions, and concomitant medications.  An event should be 
recorded as “drug related” if the Investigator believes it to be reasonably related to study drug.  
7.13. Reporting Serious or Unexpected Adverse Events  
Any SAE, irrespective of the relationship to study drug that occurs during the course of the study 
(from the first dose of study drug through Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3849], completion of Month 3 or early 
termination ) will be reported on the eCRF s and SAE Report as soon as possible  (within 24 hours 
after the site becomes aware of the event).   
The Investigator is encouraged to discuss with the Sponsor’s pharmacovigilance  group any AE 
for which the issue of reportability is unclear or questioned.   
An SAE Report should be prepared containing as much information  as is available  concerning 
the event so that a written report can be filed with appropriate regulatory authorities.  If causality 
cannot be definitively assessed at the time of the SAE, it is important to notify Sponsor  or its 
designee s within the timelines stated above.  When new significant information is obtained and 
the outcome and attribution of the event is known, the Investigator will communicate this 
information to the Sponsor or its de signees and/or on the appropriate eCRF s.  The relevant 
information will be provided in a timely manner to allow reporting to regulatory authorities 
within the required reporting period.  Any SAE follow -up information requested by [CONTACT_4883] s should be provided in a timely manner.  
Additional information may be requested by [CONTACT_594276].  For a 
follow -up report to the regulatory authorities, the Sponsor or its designees may be required to 
collect further information for a detailed description and a final evaluation of the case, including 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_243222], autopsy reports, or other relevant documents.  
The Investigator, or Sponsor (or its designees) where applicable, will notify the relevant 
Institutional Review Board ( IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC) of any SAEs and safety 
reports according to local regulation requirements.  
7.14. Pregnancy   
All pregnancies that occur during the study must be reported to the Sponsor and followed to 
conclusion. The outcome of each pregnancy must be reported.   
Pregnancy alone is not an AE, nor is an induced elective abortion to terminate a pregnancy 
without medical reason.  However, an induced therapeutic abortion to terminate a pregnancy due 
to complications or medical reasons must be reported as an SAE.  The u nderlying medical 
LB1148   
Phase 2 Protocol Amendment # 6:  LBS -POI-[ADDRESS_784002] the necessary data per protocol; however, if the subject is to be completely off the study 
per the discretion of the subject, Investigator, or Sponsor, study procedures for Early 
Termination should be completed.  
7.15.1.  Discontinuation of Study Drug  
Discontinuation of study drug administration is defined as termination of the study drug 
administration without the intent to re -administer  at a later time.   
Subjects will discontinue the study drug administration in the following circumstances:  
• The Investigator decides that study drug should be discontinued.  If this decision is made due 
to a serious or intolerable AE or a clinically significant change in a laboratory value, the 
study drug is to be discontinued and appropriate measures taken (refer to Section  7.1).  The 
designated  Medical Monitor is to be alerted.  
• The subject stops taking study drug.  If this decision is made because the subject ’s condition 
has worsened, the surgical team (doctor) and the designated  Medical Monitor should be 
alerted immediately.   
7.15.2.  Withdrawal from the Study  
In the event that the subject , the subject ’s legal representative, the Investigator, or the Sponsor 
decides that the subject  should be withdrawn from the study, all scheduled study ass essments 
will be discontinued.  
A subject may decide to withdraw from the study at any time.  If a subject  refuses to take study 
drug, the subject  should be withdrawn from study participation.  If the subject  did take a portion 
of the study drug, the subject  should remain in the study unless consent is withdrawn.   
The Sponsor or its designee s must be alerted if a subject  is withdrawn from the study.  A subject  
will be withdrawn from the study in the following situations:  
LB1148   
Phase 2 Protocol Amendment # 6:  LBS -POI-[ADDRESS_784003] 202 2 Confidential  Palisade Bio, Inc.  • The subject or the subject’s legal representative withdraws consent.  
• The subject did not take any portion of study drug prior to surgery.   
• The Investigator or the Sponsor, for any reason, stops the subject’s participation in the study.  
7.15.3.  Discontinuation of Study Sites  
Study site participation may be discontinued  if the Sponsor, Investigator, o r the IRB or IEC of 
the study site judges it necessary for any reason.  
7.15.4.  Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee Approval  
The study protocol and Informed Consent Form ( ICF), as well as any amendments, will be 
approved by [CONTACT_594277].  
7.15.5.  Discontinuation of the Study  
The study will be discontinued if the Sponsor judges it necessary for any reason . 
LB1148   
Phase 2 Protocol Amendment # 6:  LBS -POI-[ADDRESS_784004]  enrollment.  To ensure accurate, 
complete, and reliable data, the Sponsor or its representatives will do the following:  
• Provide instructional material to the study sites, as appropriate.  
• Conduct a start -up training session /Site Invitation Visit to instruct the Investigators and 
appropriate site staff .  This session will give instruction on the protocol, the completion of 
the eCRF s, and study procedures.  
• Make periodic visits to the study site.  
• Be available for consultation and stay in contact [CONTACT_86203],  email, 
telephone, and/or fax.  
• Review and evaluate eCRF data and use standard computer edits  and/or source verification  to 
detect errors in data collection.  
• Conduct a quality review of the study database.  
In addition, the Sponsor or its representatives may periodically check subject  data recorded 
against source documents at the study site.  The study may be audited by [CONTACT_170810], and/or regulatory agencies at any time.  Investigators will be given notice before 
an audit occurs.  
To ensure the safety of subjects in the study, and to ensure accurate, complete, and reliable data, 
the Investigator will keep records of laboratory tests, clinical notes, and subject  medical records

Phase 2 Protocol Amendment # 6:  LBS -POI-[ADDRESS_784005] 202 2 Confidential  Palisade Bio, Inc.  PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS  
9.1. General Considerations  
This study employs an adaptive clinical study design feature (interim analyses  with possible 
sample size re -estimation ).  A comprehensive description of the statistical methods and analyses 
planned for this study will be provided  in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) prior to the planned 
interim analysis .   
9.2. Determination of Sample Size  
Although this study is not formally powered to detect a significant treatment effect, a  sample size 
of [ADDRESS_784006] s is planned for enrollment/randomization  and is considered adequate to establish 
proof -of-concept .  The adaptive design of this study may allow for up to 200 total subjects 
enrolled at study completion.  
9.3. Statistical Methods  
Specific details about the statistical methods for all assessments, the treatment of missing data, 
and the method of control of the Type I error rate will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP).  
9.3.1.  Adhesions  
Comparisons between the LB1148 and placebo groups with respect to change from baseline in 
extent and severity of intra -abdominal adhesions will be made using the Wilcoxon rank sum test.  
9.3.2.  Bowel Function  
The primary efficacy analysis will be a time to event analysis (e.g., Cox proportional hazard 
model) with a main effect of treatment and stratified by [CONTACT_58314] (l aparotomy versus 
minimally invasive approaches ) and stoma (planned stoma versus no stoma ).  The p -values 
between the treatment groups will be evaluated using the Wald chi -square test.  The magnitude 
of the treatment effect will be presented as the difference between the LB1148 and placebo arms 
in mean time to event (estimated by [CONTACT_594260] -Meier survival curve).  
9.4. Interim Analys is 
The interim analysis serves to inform the Sponsor about the assumptions that underlie the trial 
procedures, endpoints, and sample size.  The interim  analysis will be performed after enrollment 
of approximately  50-60 subjects .  The decision rules for increasing the sample size as well as the 
clinical and statistical considerations required for proper control and minimization of bias will be 
provided in the SAP.  
LB1148

the Declaration of Helsinki and that are consistent with GCPs  and the applicable laws and 
regulations.  The Investigator, head of the medical institution, or designee will promptly submit 
the protocol to applicable ethical review boards.  
LB1148 is being studied in the U .S. under a n IND  application.  Study sites will include 
approximately  up to 15 sites in  the [LOCATION_002] .   
All or some of the obligations of the Sponsor will be assigned to CRO (s). 
10.2. Institutional Review Boa rd or Independent Ethics Committee  Approval  
The study protocol and ICF, as well as any amendments, will be approved by [CONTACT_594278] (IRB  or IEC ) prior to initiation of the study at a particular site.  All subject s 
will sign an ICF prior to any study -specific procedures.  Site p erformance during the study will 
be routinely monitored by a study monitor  (refer to Section 10.7).   
Documentation of ethical review board approval of the protocol and ICF must be provided to the 
Sponsor before  the study may begin at the study sites.  The IRB/IEC will review the protocol and 
ICF as required in accordance with the ICH GCP guidelines.  Any member of the IRB/IEC who 
is directly affiliated with this study as an Investigator or as site personnel must abstain from the 
vote on the approval of the protocol.   
10.3. Subject Information and Consent  
Written informed consent must be obtained from each subject  or legal representative designee if 
subject  is unable to sign after the nature of the study has been fully explained in accordance with 
ICH GCPs.  Informed consent must be obtained prior to performing any study -specific 
procedures.   
The subject  (or surrogate) and the individual explaining the study will sign the current IRB/IEC -
approved version of the consent form.  A copy of the signed ICF will be given to the subject .  
The date that consent was obtained will be recorded on the eCRF as well as in the subject ’s 
chart.   
A copy of the IRB/IEC  approved version of the consent form will be provided to the Sponsor.  
The original signed consent form must be maintained at the site and made available for 
inspection, as appropriate.   
LB1148   
Phase 2 Protocol Amendment # 6:  LBS -POI-[ADDRESS_784008]  (e.g., signed informed consent; source 
documents/charts) will be made available to the Sponsor (or its designees) or regulatory 
authorities for inspections, but will be maintained in confide nce. 
All study -related information provided by [CONTACT_594279], including but not limited to the active study agent identity, the 
Investigator's Brochure, the study protocol, verbal and written communication, study data , assay 
methods and scientific data, will be considered confidential.  In addition, all information 
developed during the conduct of the clinical investigation of the study agent is also considered 
confidential.  Neither the Investigator  nor any of his/her employees or agents shall disclose or 
use this information for any purpose other than the performance of the clinical study.  Such 
information shall remain the confidential and proprietary property of the Sponsor, and disclosure 
to othe rs will be limited to other physicians who are conducting studies with the same active 
study agent, the IRB/IEC,  and the applicable regulatory authorities except by [CONTACT_594280].  At such time,  that information beco mes widely and 
publicly available through no fault of the Investigator, the obligation of nondisclosure toward 
that particular information will cease.  
10.5. Case Report Forms and Study Records  
Data collected through the completion of study procedures required by [CONTACT_594281] ’s chart as source documentation.  This data will then be transcribed onto 
the appropriate eCRF s.   
All information in the eCRFs must be supported by [CONTACT_578747] ’s medical records.  
All medical records, laboratory printouts, notes made by [CONTACT_099], and other materials will 
be considered source data and must be available for inspection by [CONTACT_1034], the Sponsor’s 
designees , or governmental representatives.   
Appropriate site personnel training will occur  prior to subject enrollment for the study .  The 
Investigator remains responsible for the accuracy and adequacy of all study data.   
Study d ata will be monitored as described in Section 10.6 and Section 10.7.   
Upon further data processing, queries may be generated and sent to the Investigator for 
clarification or correction.  The Investigator  and/or delegated site personnel  will address any 
queries and forward resolutions as directed by [CONTACT_25007].   
LB1148   
Phase 2 Protocol Amendment # 6:  LBS -POI-[ADDRESS_784009] 202 2 Confidential  Palisade Bio, Inc.  10.6. Safety Monitoring  
The Sponsor or their designated Medical Monitor  will review  blinded safety data throughout the 
course of the study.  All SAEs will be reviewed within time frames mandated by [CONTACT_594282].  The Sponsor or their designee will review safety 
trends  and laboratory analytes at periodic intervals.   
All deaths and SAE reports will be reviewed in a blinded manner by [CONTACT_152486](s)  during the study.  These reports will be reviewed to assure completeness and 
accuracy, but will not be unblinded to the clinical team during the study.  If a death or clinical 
AE is deemed serious, unexpected, and possibly related to study drug  (refer to Section 0), only 
the Sponsor  or its designees  will be unblinded for regulatory reporting and safety monitoring 
purposes  (refer to Section 5.5).  The clinical site will have the ability to do an emergency code 
break on an individual subject  at their site.   These measures will preserve the integrity of the data 
collected during this study and minimize any potential for bias while providing for appropriate 
safety monitoring.  
10.7. Protocol Deviations  
Sites are responsible for abiding by [CONTACT_594283].  Additionally, the following important protocol deviations will be reported to the 
Sponsor:  
• Subject did not meet study eligibility criteria  
• Subject did not receive the correct treatment assignment  
• Subject received the wrong amount of a dose IP (i.e., ± 20% of assigned dose)  
• Subject received a prohibited concomitant medication  
• Subject was not assessed for intra -abdominal adhesions  
10.8. Study Monitoring and Access to Source Documentation  
To ensure the safety of participants in the study, and to ensure accurate, complete, and reliable 
data, the Investigator will keep records of laboratory tests, clinical notes, and subject  medical 
records in the subject  files as original source documents for the study.  If requested, the 
Investigator will provide the Sponsor, applicable regulatory agencies, and applicable ethical 
review boards with direct access to original source documents.  
The Sponsor or its designee s (e.g., CRO) will assure the accuracy of data, the selection of 
qualified Investigators, appropriate study centers,  and review protocol procedures with the 
Investigators and associated personnel prior to the study and during periodic monitoring visits.  
The Sponsor or its designee will review study data for accuracy and completeness during 
monitoring visits.  Discrepancies will be resolved with the Investigator as appropriate.  
LB1148   
Phase 2 Protocol Amendment # 6:  LBS -POI-[ADDRESS_784010] 202 2 Confidential  Palisade Bio, Inc.  The Sponsor or its designees  will monitor the study using any of the following methods:  
• Frequent telephone contacts;  
• Email ; 
• Periodic site visits;  
• Review of original subject  records, eCRF s, study drug accountability, and  
• Storage, and general study documentation.  
So that the study may be adequately monitored, the Investigator or delegated site personnel will 
cooperate in providing the Sponsor  or its designee s with all study documents (e.g., subject  charts 
and study files) and responding to inquiries that may arise as a result of the document review.  
Review of these documents will usually occur during a routine monitoring visit, but may also be 
required during a visit by a quality assurance auditor.  The Sponsor reserves the right to 
terminate the study if access to source documentation is denied to th e Sponsor or quality 
assurance  representatives.  
10.9. Retention of Data  
Source documents are the original documents, data, and records from which the subject’s eCRF 
data are obtained.  These include, but are not limited to, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office 
charts, laboratory and pharmacy records, radiographs and correspon dence.  eCRF entries may be 
considered source data if the eCRF is the site of the original data recording (i.e. no other written 
or electro nic record of the data exists).   All source documents and study documentation will be 
kept by [CONTACT_594284] e app ropriate retention period as stipulated by [CONTACT_594285], whichever is longer.   
Investigator shall retain study records required until at least [ADDRESS_784011]

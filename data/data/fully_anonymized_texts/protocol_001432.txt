Background and Rationale  
Decades of increasing incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) present a multifaceted challenge to the 
health of a growing number of Americans, affecting their diets and how they live life. 
Approximately 30 million (~9%) of all people in the US have T2D,1 and this number is expected 
to continue to rise. It is estimated that the prevalence will increase to more than 54 million 
Americans by 2030.2 At the same time, 15 million (11.8%) US households experience food 
insecurity,3 which is associated with risk for T2D and other chronic diseases.4 Both T2D and 
food insecurity are even more prevalent in Arkansas, with rates of T2D and food insecurity at 
12.2%5 and 17.3%,6 respectively. T2D and food insecurity are strongly associated for U.S. 
adults: Very low food security is associated with an over 100% increase in prevalence of T2D 
compared with adults from high food -secure households.4 Even for adults in marginally food 
secure households, probability of T2D increases by 59%.4 
 
~40 million Americans are food insecure,3 and food insecurity is associated with double the 
prevalence of T2D.4 Food insecure people face many risk factors for unmanaged T2D,7 including 
poor diet quality,8-12 insufficient physical activity,13-15 and lack of access to health care.16-18 
Unmanaged T2D can lead to increased risk of serious complications, including neuropathy, 
nephropathy, retinopathy, atherosclerosis, heart attack, stroke, and death.19 
 
~46 million Americans per year turn to food pantries and related programs to help meet 
household nutritional needs.20 An estimated 33% of food pantry client households have at least 
one member with T2D.20 Among these, 46% use food pantries at least six times per year.[ADDRESS_1075975] food pantries do not provide food of sufficient dietary quality to support a 
healthy lifestyle, particularly for vitamins A and C and calcium.22 Current food pantry clients’ 
diet quality is insufficient for caloric intake, fruits, vegetables, and dairy.23 
 
Diabetes self -management education (DSME) is an approach with documented efficacy in 
helpi[INVESTIGATOR_782351] T2D. DSME supports informed decision -making, encourages goal setting 
and problem solving, and improves self -care behaviors.24 Across many populations, DSME 
improves glycemic control;25 lowers body mass index (BMI);26 improves diabetes knowledge,27 
diet quality,28 physical activity,29 and self -efficacy;27 reduces health care costs and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602];30,[ADDRESS_1075976] shown promise for DSME among food pantry clients with T2D. One study 
paired DSME classes with T2D -appropriate food boxes distributed at food banks and found 
significant improvements in glycemic control.33 However, this study suffered from problems 
with attendance and retention, retaining only 42% of participants. In a follow -up trial, only 20% 
engaged fully with the DSME and food box intervention (i.e., pi[INVESTIGATOR_100628] ≥9 of 11 food 
distributions, attended 2 DSM E classes, etc.).[ADDRESS_1075977]

Insecurity  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_782350] #: 10 IRB# 260304  
Date: [ADDRESS_1075978] adapted DSME for people from 
diverse cultural backgrounds who face economic, transportation, health care, and health literacy 
barriers.36 We are experienced at developi[INVESTIGATOR_782352] -income food 
insecure people, including food pantry interventions to improve access to healthy food.37,38 
 
We propose a study to develop and evaluate the efficacy of a plain -language DSME curriculum 
to improve the nutritional health, physical activity, and health outcomes of low -income food 
insecure people with T2D. We will home -deliver this curriculum along wi th T2D -appropriate 
healthy food boxes to mitigate difficulties associated with access to healthy food and attendance 
at DSME sessions outside of the home. We hypothesize that this approach will lead to 
improvements in participants’ glycemic control, diet q uality, and other outcomes . 
 
Objective  
Develop, implement, and evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention to use home -delivery of 
T2D-appropriate food boxes with plain language adapted education materials , in English, 
Spanish, and Marshallese,  to improve the nutritional health, physical activity, and health 
outcomes of low -income food insecure people with T2D.  
Study Design  and Procedures  
Stakeholder involvement  Stakeholders were involved in problem selection and project 
development. Stakeholders will participate in adapting the DSME curriculum . To ensure the 
study captures outcomes important to each stakeholder group, stakeholders helped choose study 
outcomes. Stakeholders will be invited to help interpret study results and to participate in 
dissemination as co -authors of manuscripts, reports, and presentation s. 
 
Project activities  1. Adapt DSME curriculum for use by [CONTACT_6398] -income food insecure 
communities.  As part of the development , we will 
incorporate T2D -appropriate recipes and 
information on cooking and shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_782353] a 
limited budget and with foods commonly found at 
food pantries. In addition, 12 videos will be 
created and posted on a freely accessible UAMS 
website to introduce and rein force key DSME 
concepts.    Table 1. 12 -week Adapted ACP Curriculum Modules

participant. The boxes w ere adapted from the American Diabetes Association Create Your Plate 
method,49 which emphasizes non -starchy vegetables, proteins, and grains, consistent with the 
meal pattern promoted in the ACP DSME.48 In addition, the boxes will include food that largely 
reflects Feeding America’s Foods to Encourage framework,50 which was developed by [CONTACT_782363]51 and MyPlate framework.52 
 
The boxes will include ~9,000 calories of food, equivalent to the amount the average household 
would receive pro-rated per week  from an average Arkansas food pantry.37 Each box will 
include fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as the ingredients necessary to prepare the recipes 
included with that week’s DSME curriculum. If a certain item is unavailable  or out of stock, 
there is a list of potential substitutions that are of equal nutritional content compared to the first 
choice food item.  Each 
week’s box will include a n 
educational fact sheet of 
the week’s DSME module, 
including links and QR 
codes leading  to the videos. 
Links to the week’s online 
materials, which present

their preference for the food prov ided in the food boxes.  
Initial data collection will take place in a priva te space immediately following enrollment. The 
remaining pre -intervention data collection and post -intervention data collections will take place 
via telephone and at locations of each participant’s choosing (e.g., HbA1c will be collected at 
home or at a community -based location such as a food pantry). Our team has necessary expertise 
and equipment to complete data collection in homes or community -based locations, having 
successfully completed thousands of su ch data collection events.37,43,[ADDRESS_1075986] study design. All participants will receive the intervention 
(i.e., 12 weekly food boxes including the adapted DSME materials). Our target sample size for 
recruitment is 100. Assuming a repeated measures t -test, two -sided α=.05, and a Pearson 
correlation between repeated measures of r=.5, we will have 80% power to detect a Cohen’s d 
effect size of 0.28. For context, Chrvala, Sherr, & Lipman’s (2016) meta -analysis found that on 
average DSME led to a 0.6% improvement in Hb A1c.[ADDRESS_1075987] deviation of 1.5%,

Risks and Benefits  
A risk to study participants is the potential for loss of confidentiality  of study data . Measures to 
protect the confidentiality of study data will be implemented as described in the Data Handling 
and Recordkeepi[INVESTIGATOR_147414].  
A finger stick is required to collect a small amount of blood for testing, this may cause some 
discomfort . 
The food box deliveries will be packaged to hold the correct temperature of perishable foods for  
three  hours . After that time, or if the box is in any way damaged there is a risk of potentially 
eating spoiled foods from the food box delivery. There is also a risk of consuming a food item 
that the participant is  unknowingly allergic to. We will do our best to ensure the integrity of the 
food box deliveries and are always available to contact [CONTACT_782370].  
Potential b enefits include  provision of nutritionally balanced food to participant’s home for the 
[ADDRESS_1075992] in this study. During data collection events survey data will be 
collected on a UAMS iPad or laptop using REDCap mobile app (with built in encryption 
technology). As soon as the data collectors re turn to UAMS, they will upload the data to the 
REDCap instance housed on a secure UAMS server and delete the data from the iPad  or laptop . 
Blood specimens collected for HbA1c testing are only used for point of care testing, they will be 
discarded immediately after the test is performed. At the conclusion of the study  the key to the 
code will be shredded , the data will be permanently de -identified.

PI: [INVESTIGATOR_782350] #: 10 IRB# 260304  
Date: 20230222  Page 10 The study will comply with UAMS Admin Guide Policy 3.2.01 – research data, reports and 
analyses be retained for seven years after final reporting or publication of a project, or longer if 
required by a sponsor or regulation.  
 
Data Analysis  
Analyses will be performed with SAS 9.4. Data will be examined for distributional normality 
and outliers prior to analyses. Descriptive statistics will be generated for all variables of interest. 
We will examine patterns and predictors of missing values. If the percentage of missing values is 
larger than approximately 10%, we will compare models using multiple imputat ion with those 
using complete case analysis to examine the potential impact of missing values on the results.  
To examine the intervention’s effect on the primary outcomes of glycemic control as measured 
by [CONTACT_13505]1c and diet quality as measured by [CONTACT_598654] -2015 (HEI) scores, we will use 
mixed effects regression models for repeated measures. These analyses will focus on testing for a 
statistically significant difference between pre -intervention versus post -intervention measures. 
Additiona l analyses will include relevant covariates such as sex or age. We will also explore 
models that include process indicators of dosage of intervention received (e.g., number of food 
boxes received) to examine whether dosage predicts change in primary outcom es. 
 
Ethical Considerations  
This study will be conducted in accordance with all applicable government regulations and 
University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences research policies and procedures. This protocol and 
any amendments will be submitted and approved by [CONTACT_782371] l Review Board 
(IRB) to conduct the study.  
The formal consent of each subject, using the IRB -approved consent form, will be obtained 
before that subject is submitted to any study procedure. All subjects for this study will be 
provided a consent form describing this study and providing sufficient in formation in language 
suitable for subjects to make an informed decision about their participation in this study. The 
person obtaining consent will thoroughly explain each element of the document and outline the 
risks and benefits, alternate treatment(s), and requirements of the study. The consent process will 
take place in a quiet and private room, and subjects may take as much time as needed to make a 
decision about their participation. Participation privacy will be maintained and questions 
regarding part icipation will be answered. No coercion or undue influence will be used in the 
consent process. This consent form must be signed by [CONTACT_782372]. A copy of the consent will be given to the participant, and the informed c onsent process 
will be documented in the research record.  
A $[ADDRESS_1075993] will be provided to the participant each time they complete a data 
collection event. If they complete both data collection events, they will receive a total of $80 in 
Walmart gift cards.

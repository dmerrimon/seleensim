I. Hypotheses and Specific Aims :   
This small interve ntion study will determine if and how sleep 
restriction, independent of circadian misalignment  (e.g. shift work, jet lag) , 
induces a decrease in  the bone formation  marker Procollagen I Intact N -
Terminal Propeptide (PI[INVESTIGATOR_680]) .  Specifically, it will evaluate if sleep restricti on 
itself is responsible for the decrease seen in  PI[INVESTIGATOR_421954] .  The specific aim  is to 
evaluate the mechanistic underpi[INVESTIGATOR_421955] a small intervention  
study  in healthy adult men .  The hypothesis  is that s leep restriction, 
independent of differences in posture , mechanical loading,  or activity 
levels/patterns  decreas es bone formation and that the magnitude of the 
decrease will be greater in those with higher levels of bone turnover at 
baseline .  
 
The work being proposed here for COMIRB consideration only covers 
the 3rd aim of my K23 award.  
 
 
II. Background and Significance :  
Osteoporosis is a prevalent disease  with significant morbidity and  
mortality  (1-3), yet no underlying cause is identified in ~ 50% of osteoporosis work -ups 
(4).  Osteoporosis  is traditionally associated with  postmenopausal women, however, it is 
an under -recognized condition in men despi[INVESTIGATOR_421956] (5).  Although the fracture burden of osteoporosis is predominantly seen later in 
life, peak bon e mass is attained around 3 0 years of age  and is a signifi cant determinant 
of bone health and strength later in life.   Skeletal insults prior to this age could limit 
attainment of optimal  peak bone mass, resulting in an increased risk of osteoporosis 
and fracture later in life.   Sleep disturbance occurs across the lifespan and may 
represent a novel cause of osteoporosis that could help explain the etiology of 
otherwise “idiopathic” osteopo rosis.  Identifying sleep disturbance as a novel cause of 
osteoporosis would provide  an opportunity for  appropriate intervention  and potentially  
osteoporosis  prevention if the sleep disturbance is identified and remedied prior  to the 
attainment of peak bon e mass  or before bone loss occurs in older populations .  
 The literature on sleep duration and bone health in humans is very mixed with 
both long and short sleep duration associated with low bone mineral density ( BMD ) (6).  
Protocol Template  Page 3 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/11  
 The inc onsistent literature is due, in part, to cross -sectional studies utilizing subjective 
sleep duration and variable method/site for assessment of bone mineral density.  There 
is a lack of pure sleep restriction studies that are designed to assess skeletal ou tcomes 
in humans but animal data suggest sleep restriction may be detrimental to bone health.  
Studies have shown impaired bone formation and subsequently lower BMD in 
chronically sleep deprived rats compared to controls (7, 8) .  Our  data on the effects of 
cumulative sleep restriction and concurrent circadian misalignment in men closely 
parallel these animal data.   
We were the first to describe lower levels of a bone formation marker (PI[INVESTIGATOR_680]) 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_421957] a bone resorption mark er (C-telopeptide of Type I Collagen - CTX) 
in ten healthy men after 3 weeks of cumulative sleep restriction with concurrent 
circadian disruption  (akin to the stresses endured during rotating shift work)  (9).  In 
addition, these data showed that the magnitude of the decrease in PI[INVESTIGATOR_421958]  (aged 20 -27 years) , who had higher levels of bone tur nover at baseline, 
compared to older men  (aged 55 -65 years) (9).  A significant decrease in bone 
formation without a concom itant decrease  in bone resorption could lead to an 
unfavorable balance in bone turnover that, if sustained, could lead to bon e loss, low 
BMD /osteoporosis and increased fracture risk.  Furthermore, our preliminary data 
suggest that  the magnitude of this insult may be magnified during skeletally vulnerable 
periods  when bone turnover is high,  such as early adulthood during  attainment of peak 
bone mass.  This implies that even if a sleep and/or circadian disruption is relatively 
transi ent, it may have lifelong implications for skeletal health if it compromises  
attainment of peak bone mass.  The gap in knowledge  is that i t was not clear from our 
study if the decrease in PI[INVESTIGATOR_421959] (because they were imposed simultaneously)  or other confounders.  
Since our original study was not specifically designed to investigate bone -related 
outcomes, it is important to evaluate possible confounders in this relationship and 
determine the mecha nisms by [CONTACT_421970].    
This study would fill this knowledge gap  by [CONTACT_421971]  a marker of bone formation .  In addition, this study  will begin to 
dissect the mechanisms by [CONTACT_421972]/patterns , dietary intake, light exposure, and posture.  These data will be 
used to support and design  a larger R01 application aimed at investigating all  potential 
mechanisms for sleep /circadian -induced alterations in bone metabolism  and the 
potential for reversal of these changes with normal sleep  duration and  timing (during the 
biological night).  Currently, a sleep assessment is not performed during the  routine 
evaluation of causes of secondary osteoporosis, but our research has the potential to 
change that.  If our hypothesis is shown to be correct  and sleep disruption is identified 
as a novel risk factor for osteoporosis  then screening could lead to diagnosis and 
intervention for the sleep disturbance  before osteoporosis is manifest or during 
osteoporosis evaluation .  Furthermore, pharmacological interventions for low BMD may 
be avoided and/or their efficacy improved by p rompt amelioration of the sleep 
abnormality.  In addition, understanding the biological pathways by [CONTACT_421973] a new causal pathway for low bone mass, fracture risk, and 
new therapeutic targets.

III. Preliminary Stud ies/Progress Report:   
 We have conducted similar work in this novel area and will be able to complete 
the proposed study.  Our preliminary data (Figure 1) show ed that in healthy men, three 
weeks of insufficient sleep (sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 5.6 hours/night) with a hist ory of circadian 
misalignment was associated with a significant decrease in bone formation (PI[INVESTIGATOR_680]) while 
bone resorption (CTX) remained unchanged , creating a potential “bone loss window” 
(9). Our preliminary data also suggest that bone metabolism  may be particularly 
susceptible to sleep disturbance during vulnerable periods when bone turnover is high 
(e.g. men 20 -27 years old, at the end of  peak modeling period)  (9).  These data indicate 
that sleep and circadian disturbance may be novel, modifiabl e risk factors for bone loss, 
low BMD/osteoporosis and increased fracture risk.  To apply these data to clinical 
practice, more research is needed to determine whether it was the sleep restriction or 
history of circadian misalignment that was primarily res ponsible for the decrease in the 
bone formation marker, PI[INVESTIGATOR_680], and to investigate the mechanisms by [CONTACT_421974].  
 In my current research project,  we have determined that  the decline  in PI[INVESTIGATOR_421960] 5 days of the imposed sleep restriction and concurrent 
circadian misalignment  (unpublished data  – Figure 2 ).  Therefore, we believe  it is 
realistic to see appreciable changes in bone turnover markers within the proposed nine-
day study period. We are also currently examining 
age and sex differences in the sleep bone 
relationship.  Our preliminary data indicate that 
similar changes in bone turnover markers are not 

Protocol Template  Page 5 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/[ADDRESS_532656] -menopausal women  with short (<6 hours/night) compared to normal (7 -8 
hours/ni ght) sleep duration  (unpublished data ).  Therefore, we will focus inclusion 
criteria for our current study to  men.    
 
IV. Research  Methods  
 
A.  Outcome  Measure (s):   
- Primary Outcome:  Change in Serum Procollagen I Intact N -Terminal Propeptide 
(PI[INVESTIGATOR_680]) – a marker of bone formation.  
- Secondary Outcomes: Change in serum C -telopeptide of Type I Collagen (CTX) – 
a marker of bone resorption ; chang e in sclerostin (a marker of osteocyte function 
and activity) ; resting energy expenditure.  
Bone turnover markers (BTM) are well -established surrogate markers for estimating 
bone turnover because they usually correlate with direct measure s of bone remodeling 
(i.e. hist omorphometry obta ined from bone biopsy) (10).  We will be using the preferred 
(11) markers of bone formation (PI[INVESTIGATOR_680]) and resorption (CTX) as our primary and 
secondary outcomes, respectively.  Serum CTX will be measured using the 
Immunodiagnostics ELI SA assay (inter -assay CV 9.7%, intra-assay CV 1.7%) (12). 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_421961] (trimer only) PI[INVESTIGATOR_680] (inter -
assay CV 5.5 -9.5%, intra -assay CV 3.2 -9.6%) (13). All will be run in duplicate and then 
averaged for the final result.   Sclerostin will be measured using the Meso Scale 
Discovery ELISA assay (mean  CV of 4%) (14).

• Blood draws:  
o Hourly (via IV) for [ADDRESS_532664] daily venipuncture.  Otherwise, IV will be changed 
every 72 hours.   
o A total of 56 blood draws will be performed throughout the inpatient phase 
(each up to 5mL).  Over the course of the study the amount of blood 
drawn will be less than a typi[INVESTIGATOR_269263] (<1 pi[INVESTIGATOR_11731]).  
• 24 hour urine collection during the two, 24 -hour blood collection intervals

clinic f or these fasting blood draws (each up to 7 mL) 
Risks & Justification of Study Procedures and Data Collection Tools  
 The risks of study procedures and data collection tools are minimal because they 
are not greater than what may be encountered in daily life.  
- Screening and study -related labs  are necessary to apply the necessary 
exclusion criteria, to characterize the study population and to analyze the primary 
and secondary outcomes.  The risks will be minimized:  
o Excluding those with pre -existing anemia;  
o Experienced, trained personnel utilizing sterile technique for venipuncture 
and IV line placement will minimize the ri sks associated with blood draws;  
o Minimizing volume of blood drawn to what is needed for primary and 
secondary aims will minimize the risk associated with blood loss.  Overall, 
the amount of blood drawn from screening to study completion will be less 
than a ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_269263] (<1 pi[INVESTIGATOR_11731]);  
o Referral will be offered to primary care physicians and/or sp ecialists  
(including psychiatrist)  if new diagnoses are made (or suspected) during 
screening.  
 Answers to psychiatric questionnaires will be reviewed in real -time 
and any time -sensitive referrals made for volunteers who indicate 
suicidality with a plan.   
- Catheterization  is necessary to perform hourly blood sampling on days 1 and 8 
of week 2 of the study protocol.  Risk will be minimized:  
o There is a potential risk of thrombophlebitis with the catheter placement 
but this risk is small. Local hematomas are als o possible but infrequently 
observed. There is a slight risk of infection with the blood draw. A small 
amount of heparin will be used to keep the blood draw catheter patent. 
Allergic reactions and side effects to heparin are rare but possible.  
Symptoms of  an allergic reaction to heparin may include, rash, itching or 
swelling at the IV catheter site, dizziness or trouble breathing.  
o Experienced, trained CTRC personnel will place IV lines and nursing 
personnel will be present 24/7 to address any adverse reactions  
o IV lines will be changed every 72 hours, as per hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361]   
- DXA  is needed to characterize the study populatio n and apply the necessary 
exclusion criteria.  The risks will be minimized:  
o The DXA procedures involve exposure to ionizing radiation to the whole 
body of approximately 2 mrem (0.2mSv).  Overall radiation exposure from 
DXA is less than that from daily background radiation dose to the whole 
body and is <0.05% of the annual allowable exposure for radiation 
workers;  
Protocol Template  Page 12 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/[ADDRESS_532665] the study hypothesis, but can be physically 
and mentally challenging .  Risks will be minimized:  
o Participants will be dropped off at the facility and pi[INVESTIGATOR_140467] a family 
member or provided a ride home  
o Degree of sleep restriction imposed (5h/night  x 6 nights) is no greater than 
what may be e ncountered in normal daily life with occupational and social 
obligations;  
o Participants will undergo a screening evaluation and clearance for any 
mental health conditions that may preclude th em from completing the 
protocol;    
o Excluding those with pre -existi ng sleep debt;  
o Excluding those with baseline metabolic derangements who may be more 
susceptible to sleep -induced metabolic disruption;  
o Participants will be  supervised by [CONTACT_421979] . Nursing staff will be 
onsite 24/7  during the inpatient sleep restriction phase of the protocol . 
Participants  will be allowe d to stop the study at any time;  
o Participants will have a n ad libitum recovery period with at least  10h sleep 
opportunity on the CTR C inpatient unit following completion of Week 2 on 
night 8 (prior to discharge)  and will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_140467] a family member or 
offered a ride home .  Recovery period can be extended an additional [ADDRESS_532666] 
adequately recovered . 
- One week inpatient stay  is necessary to allow sufficient time to observe the 
predicted primary outcome.  Risks will be minimized:  
o Screening evaluation will be used to exclude those with a mental health 
condition that may preclude them from completing the protocol;  
o Duration of study will be specifically addressed in consent form;  
o Participants will be allowed to ambulate outside of the  study room during 
wake, non -supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], non -sleep hours to minimize claustrophobic triggers;  
o Participants will be allowed to stop the protocol at any time, at which a 
final blood draw will be performed.  
- Resting Energy Expenditure  is now included to improve o ur understanding of 
the impact of sleep restriction on fasting and postprandial nutrient metabolism.  
These tests are short and non -invasive.  They do not add substantial participant 
burden and do not carry any significant risks.  Risks will be minimized b y: 
o Removing the clear plexiglass hood immediately if participant experiences 
claustrophobia.  
Protocol Template  Page 13 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/11  
 - Questionnaires, interviews, and collection of personal medical information  
are necessary to screen participants, apply inclusion/exclusion criteria and 
characterize the study population.  Risks related to confidentiality and privacy will 
be minimized:  
o No PHI will be included on data collection  forms, whenever possible;  
o A private set ting will be used when conducting interviews or  collect ing 
personal information . 
o Specimens processed in the CTRC lab will be labeled with the 
participant’s name, medical record number, protocol number and study ID 
number, as required by [CONTACT_421980] b and CTRC Core Lab.  Stored 
samples will be given indirect identifiers.  Study personnel will have 
access to the code which is kept in an electronic database.   
    
E. Potential Scientific Problems:   
This study has significant potential to identify sleep di sorders as a  novel risk factor 
for osteoporosis and will begin to dissect the mechanisms by [CONTACT_421981].  However, some potential scientific problems  cannot be 
addressed with the limited scope and budget of this study :   
- This study does not include a control  population .  However, participants will serve 
as self -controls.   Larger future studies will include a control group to assess the 
effects of the i npatient study environment on the outcome.   
- This study does not include an intervention to assess the effects of pure 
circadian misalignment  (without sleep restriction) . This project has a smaller 
scope with limited  (K23 mentored career development award)  budget that  will 
provide pi[INVESTIGATOR_49452] a larger, more comprehensive R01 application based on 
this study’s findings  that can explore the relationship between circadian 
misalignment and bone metabolism .   
- Every effort will be made to match physical activit y levels and patterns and light 
exposure between outpatient and inpatient weeks.  We acknowledge that this is 
ambitious and that it may not be practical to achieve 100% accuracy but 
represents an attempt to control as much variability as possible.  
- Recruitm ent of the proposed study population may be challenging, however, my 
mentors are experienced clinical scientists with expertise in this area.  If 
necessary, I will screen individuals from their prior studies who have consented 
to be contact[CONTACT_52911] .   
- Although we don’t anticipate this short -duration protocol will have a long -lasting 
detrimental effect on the participants’ bone health, the ability and degree to which 
bone turnover markers recover after a period of insufficient sleep is currently 
unkn own.   We will obtain a fasting sample the morning after the recovery night of 
sleep and if additional funding is secured we will  propose further evaluation of 
bone turnover markers during a longer recovery phase , or address this in a 
subsequent, larger, mo re comprehensive study .     
 
 
F.   Data Analysis Plan:   
- The percent change (%Δ) in each biomarker from the beginning of Week 2 
(representing 8 hours of sleep/night in Week 1) to the end of Week 2 
Protocol Template  Page 14 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/11  
 (representing 5 hours of sleep/night in Week 2) will be calculated for each 
participant and then averaged for the gr oup. For each biomarker, the average 
%Δ will be tested using a [ADDRESS_532667] controlling the type I error rate at 
0.05.   For each biomarker, the hypotheses tested will be H 0: %Δ = 0 versus H 1: 
%Δ ≠ 0.   Based on our preliminary data, we estimate tha t PI[INVESTIGATOR_680] (our primary 
outcome) will change at least 10% from Week 1 to Week 2 and assume 11% 
variability in the %Δ and a correlation of 0.[ADDRESS_532668] 81.7% power to detect a change 
of 10% or greater.   If necessary, a mixed model may be used to analyze the 
data, with the help of [CONTACT_355476] J. Blatchford and Pamela Wolfe, MS 
(biostatisticians).  
- Potential Confounders : activity level/pattern (matched between inpatient and 
outpatient wee ks using a FitBit activity monitor ); diet (identical meals provided 
during inpatient & last 3 days of outpatient week); light exposure (will attempt to 
match between inpatient and outpatient conditions using ActiWATCH); inherent 
external and internal circa dian misalignment imposed by [CONTACT_421982]; changes in inflammatory markers, hormones levels, 
sympathetic tone, metabolic parameters such as glucose/insulin (additional 
serum will be drawn and stored to measure these if addi tional funding is 
secured).     
- Based on our prior experience recruiting for these kinds of studies we anticipate d 
that we would  need to screen 3 -4 people for every 1 participant/completer.  
Therefore , we initially planned to consent 350% of our target, or 42 individuals to 
get 12 men to complete the entire protocol.   Our screening:enrollment ratio has 
been closer to 10:[ADDRESS_532669] 9 months, therefore, we plan to consent up to 
120 individuals to get 12 men to complete the entire prot ocol.    
 
 
G.  Summarize Knowledge to be Gained:   
This study has significant potential to iden tify sleep disorders as a novel risk factor 
for osteoporosis and will begin to dissect the mechanisms by [CONTACT_421981].  These data could impact patient care by [CONTACT_421983]/osteoporosis and concurrent sleep 
disorders.

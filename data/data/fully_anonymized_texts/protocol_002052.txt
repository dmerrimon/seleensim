Version  date: 10/24/2021  1.0 Background  
 
For adults with type 2 diabetes ( T2D) performing recommended  self-care improves 
glycemic manage ment (hemo globin A1c) and prevents disease -related  compli cations 
and premature mortality. Achieving  good self -care rem ains very challeng ing, and there 
may be  significant benefits to involving close family and friends in patients' behavior 
change efforts. Family members an d friends can either reinforce or undermine patients' 
self-care, and many  experience distress a bout no t knowing how to b est support the 
patient's self -care efforts. Both in -home and out -of-home  support directly affect patie nts' 
self-care, m edication adherence , and glycemic control. Moreover, family/friend support  
indirectly affects di abetes outcomes throug h its benefits to diabetes distress and quality 
of life. The large international  Diabetes Attitudes, Wishes, and Needs fol low-up study 
(DAWN2) found that although patients' family members clearly  want to help them, they 
lack basic kno wledge about how to d o this effectively.  Additionally, many family 
members  experience significant distress and other negative impacts themselves . 
Although engag ing family/friend  support persons may be a highly effective way to 
improve outcomes  for adults with T2D and their support persons , this has rarely been 
investigated.  There is a critical need for f easible interventions for adults with T2D to 
enhance  support ive social  environment s for health behavior change and improve 
psychosocial wellness among patient s and their support persons.  
 
We developed a mobile phone -delivered diabete s self-care support i ntervention called 
FAMS (Famil y/friends Activation to M otivate  Self-care) with and for racially diverse adults 
with T2D receiving  care at Federally Qualified Health Ce nters.  FAMS includes  phone  
coaching for patient participants focused on improving family and friend involvement  
and setting and monitoring self-care goals. FAMS also include s text message support for 
patient  participants  and text message  support  for their adult support person.  FAMS u ses 
one-way informational text messages  and interactive  text messages , and patients ’ and 
support pe rsons’ text messages are  tailored to the self -care goals patient participants set 
during monthly coaching. We completed  usability  testing and integ rated user s’ feedback  
before we evaluated FAMS in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_4265] . In the  pi[INVESTIGATOR_4265] , FAMS  established its 
acceptability and accurate deli very and  demon strated improvements in family/friend 
involvement in patients' self- care, and in patients' diabetes self -effica cy, eating b ehavior, 
and physical activity.  
  
2.0 Rationale and Specific Aims  
 
We built upon these promising initial findings by [CONTACT_93156] 2.0 in a larger, 15-month 
randomized control trial (RCT) including  support  persons (SPs) i n both the intervention 
and contr ol condition. This project's focus aligns closely with th e American Diabetes  
Association's new psychosocial standards  and represents an advance in t he use of 
technology to deliver patient and  family -centered care. Moreover,  this work has the 
potential to improve the social contexts in which adults live with T2D,  key diabetes -
related psychosocial outcomes for patien ts and their family/friends, and glyc emic 
management .

4.0 Enrollm ent/Randomization  
 
Potentially eligible  participants we re identified through a clini cal data warehouse that  
queried electronic me dical records  (EMR) . We mailed letters and a study brochure to 
potentially eligible participants, asking that they let research staff know of their interest 
or to request no further con tact. After one week, stud y staff called potential partici pants 
who did  not opt-out to explain the study and assess interes t. Interested participants  
confirmed inclusion and exclusion via se lf-report by [CONTACT_93158]. Enrolling participants were asked if they wish  to invite a support 
perso n, but support perso n invitation  and/or enrollment was not required. Research staff 
obtained contact [CONTACT_19297] a potential support person. Research staff then 
contact[CONTACT_93159] l support persons  to confir m eligibility and obtain their verbal 
informed consent  by [CONTACT_648] . All participants were sent a copy of the consent document . 
 
Consented patient participants were sent  a survey and  A1c kit  and consented support 
person participants were sent a survey.  Once patient  partici pants completed the survey 
and put their A1c kit in t he mail, they were r andomized.  Support persons were 
randomized with the patient participant.   
 Participants  (or dyads)  were randomized to intervent ion or control w ith a 1:[ADDRESS_102895] during their 
participation . This includes an o verview of study components specific to the ir assigned 
condition  and collection of mobile phone information and preferences for the text 
messaging platform.

sessions included : 
• Setting a behavi oral goal that can be completed at least 4 days per week in the 
categori es of d ietary be havior, physical activity, or s tress management (setting 
and/or adjusting the goal, check in on goal progress ) 
• Skill building around family/friend  involvement in diabet es management, specific 
to the goal (discussion of  helpful and/or harmful family involvement, coach -
selected skill buil ding to align with and addres s the patient part icipant ’s 
exper iences, setting  a verbal contract to practice the learnt skill with a specific 
identified person and – at subsequent sessions – check in on how that went).

were admi nistrativ ely withd rawn.  
 If a parti cipant expressed wishes to withdrawal from the study, study staff would 
contact [CONTACT_2299] . Study s taff follow ed a protocol to determin e which levels of 
participation the patient  does/does not want:

if so ass igned) but will complete study assessments  
(2) no intervention  (opt out of all assigned study compon ents) but will comple te 
study assess ments  
(3) no surveys but okay with c ompleting A 1c kits or vice versa  and receiving 
assigned components  
(4) no surveys no r A1c tests but will allow study staff to review and extract

(2) no surveys b ut okay with receiving text message s 
(3) no fu rther participat ion 
Patients can still engage with al l aspects of the s tudy if their SPs withdraws . If the 
patient withdraws  to the level of no fu rther part icipation, the ir SP would be

[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
Version  date: 10/24/2021  15.0  Background  
 
In No vember 2020  – less than half -way through  recruitment for the FAMS 2.[ADDRESS_102910] 
and exit int erviews.  
 
Using cluster analysis with data from a large cohort of adults with T2DM, w e 
identified 4 types of diabetes -specific family functioning . Type was independently 
associated with diabetes outcomes, including glycemic control (primary outcome 
of FAMS  2.[ADDRESS_102911]) and psychosocial wellbeing ( diabetes di stress and global well-
being, secondary outcomes of FAMS 2. [ADDRESS_102912]) . Because this evidence suggests 
effects of the FAMS 2.[ADDRESS_102913]  are unchanged.  
 
16.0  Rationale and Specific Aims  
 
Aim 1. Validate  the diabetes -specific family functioning typology  
longitudinally  in a diverse sample  to:  
1a. Determine if similar types emerge in the more diverse RCT  sample at baseline .   
1b. Examine t ype stability over time in the control group.  
1c. Examine associations between type and outcomes prospectively in the control 
group. Findings will enhance the utility of the typology in diverse samples  and the 
clinical validity of the typology.  
Aim 2. Ex plore diabetes -specific family functioning type as an effect modifier 
of FAMS 2.0. We will use mixed methods to understand how efficacy of the FAMS 2.[ADDRESS_102914] and  explore  which

Exit Interviews  Upon completion  of the study (1 5mo) 
participants assigned to intervention were 
invited to p articipate in an exit int erview  
 
Each patient participant survey for the FAMS 2.[ADDRESS_102917] included measures of the typology 
dimensions . 
 
Measures of Dimensions for  Typology  
For these items, respondents are asked to " think about the person who is most involved 
in your diabetes on a regular basis."  
Collaborative Copi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (3 
dimensions ): Cognitive 
Compensation, Interpersonal Enjoyment, & Frequency  Perceptions of Collaboration Questionnaire (PCQ)  assesses  
Cognitive Compensation (degree to which collaboration is 
needed to overcome cognitive deficits or decline; α=0.80), 
Interpersonal Enjoyment (degree to which collaboration provides encouragement and closeness; α=0.64), and 
Frequency of Collaboration (α=0.79)  
For these items, "think about the people closest to you in you r everyday life  - it doesn't 
matter if they live with you."  
Received support (2 
dimensions ): helpful & 
harmful  Family/Friend Involvement in Adults’ Diabetes (FIAD ) 
assesses the helpful and harmful aspects of received support for diabete s self-care activi ties in the past 30 days . 9-items 
assess helpful (e.g. “How often do your family members 
exercise with you or ask you to exercise with them?”; α=0.87) and 7 -items assess harmful (e.g.  “How often do 
your family members bring foods around that you shouldn’t 
be eating?”; α=0.72). Harmful items quer y frequency of 
undermining/  sabotaging behaviors and nagging/arguing 
about self -care  
Perceived  support : 
Autonomy Support  Important Other Climate Questionnaire (IOCQ)  assesses 
perception of the degree to which others support the 
individu al’s personal agen cy. We adapted the 6 -item IOCQ 
to be specific to diabetes as the developers recommend  and 
to reference more than one importan t other (e.g. “My 
important others try to understand how I see my diabetes 
before suggesting any changes”; α=0.89)  
Perceived  support : 
Criticism The criticism scale from the Family Emotional Involvement 
and Criticism Scale , adapted to be specific to diabetes (e.g.  
“My important others find  fault with the things I do to 
manage my diabetes”; α=0.71)  
Match  (2 dimensions):  
Effectiveness  & 
Satisfaction  Single item s: “How effective  are your friends and family  at 
dealing with troubles or issues related to your di abetes 
management?” ; "How satisfied are you with your friends 
and family members' involvement in dealing with troubles or 
issues related to your diabetes management?"  
 Only patient participants assigned to the intervention are recruited for exit inte rviews.

Version  date: 10/24/[ADDRESS_102918] to pu rposively sample 
n=80 participants to complete interviews , such that n= 15-[ADDRESS_102919] ~30-45 minutes,  
and participants will provide  verbal informed consent before any inter view data is 
collected.  Questions focus on  (a) diabetes -specific family functioning prior to , during and 
after the intervention, (b) which intervention components they felt worked best/least for 
them, and (c) desirability and acceptability of  alternative  intervention formats and 
content . 
Participants  who complete an interview are compensated $40.  Interviews are audio 
recorded and tra nscribed for analysis.

including:  hemoglobin A1c, diabetes distress, g lobal well-being, self -efficacy, self -care 
behaviors (die tary behavior, ph ysical activity, medication  adherence) and helpful and 
harmful family/friend involvement .  
 This analysis lever ages engageme nt data already collected during the RCT , including: 
enrollment of a s upport person, text message response rates, coaching  session 
completi on rates, elements of coaching pro tocol including completing rates of goals set, 
completion of verbal contract to eng age friends/family . 
 
The FAMS 2.[ADDRESS_102921] modification are exploratory and intended for hypothesis genera tion, 
therefore we wi ll interpret patterns of effects and use 
p<.10 as our thre shold to discern 
potentially  meaningful differences in  intervention  effects.  
 
19.0  Privacy/Confidentiality Issues  
 
Informed consent for patient participant exit interviews is obtained verbally over the 
phone  before completing the exit interview . Exit interviews are recorded following 
participants' consent and the audio files and transcripts are stored using the subject's 
unique ID on a secure VUMC server. The transcripts are de-identified and will be stored 
separately from other participant  data for at least ten years after the close of the study. 
Recorded exit interviews will be stored separately, o n a secure VUMC until the close of 
the study, at which point they will be destroyed.

Investigative 
Sites  Approximately 6-12 investigative sites in the [LOCATION_002]  
Study Design  This is a Phase 2a, multi -center, open -label study, conducted in two  cohorts of patients 
diagnosed with acute liver failure/ severe acute liver injury (ALF/ALI) who meet 
inclusion/exclusion criteria . Cohort 1 is defined as  patients with ALF/ALI with minimal  
renal dysfunction at the time of enrollment (defined as  a serum creatinine  ≤1.5 mg/dL 
and mean arterial pressure of >65 mm Hg).  Cohort 2 is defined as  patients with 
ALF/ALI with compromised renal function (defined as a serum  creatinine >1.5 mg/dL 
and <10 mg/dL with mean arterial pressure of >65 mm Hg).  
Informed consent will be obtained from the patient and/or patient’s legally authorized 
representative (LAR) or family member as defined in 21CFR50.3(m).  All patients will 
receive medical care for acute liver failure/severe acute liver injury according to the 
institution’s standards of care.  Standard of care may include, but is not limited to, 
administration of N-acetylcysteine and consideration  for orthot opic liver 
transplantation.  
Up to [ADDRESS_868478] 72 hours due to transplant, death or  early 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. Due to this, we anticipate 25% of the enrolled population will fail to 
reach evaluable status .  Therefore, we plan to enroll up to 50 patients in order

  Do not duplicate  Study Design 
Continued  to obtain 36 evaluable patient s. Dosing with OCR -002 may be initiated immediately 
after obtaining signed informed consent; or, up to 32 h after obtaining consent should 
the time be  necessary to complete any pre- study drug initiation requirements and/or to 
provide a time frame for study drug administration.  
Baseline is immediately prior to the start of the initial infusion.  At Treatment Day 1  - 
Time “0” (T0)  and after baseline measurements, patients enrolled at Dose Levels 1 
through 3 will receive an initial infusion rate of OCR -002.  Dose will be escalated to a 
maximum dose of 10g/24h infusion as indicated herein.  Patients receiving Dose Level 
4 will receive the full 20 gm/24 hour dose level from initiation of infusion for a 
maximum time of 120 hours  with no further dose escalation, provided the dose level is 
well tolerated with no noteworthy side effects. Titration of dose will depend on 
evidence of safety and tolerability (refer to Treatment section below).    
Patients may have an IV catheter inserted as a safer and easier method for obtaining 
repeated blood sampling and a separate IV for the infusion.  Blood samples for 
measurement of plasma ornithine, phenylacetate and PAGN concentrations will be 
collected at multiple time -points during the infusion period, at the Completion of the 
Last Infusion and up to [ADDRESS_868479] 
Infusion.  Data on clinical outcomes will also be collected during the study period.  
Safety data will be reviewed by a Safety Review Committee (SRC) operating under an 
approved charter and made up of three ALFSG clinicians who are independent of the 
participating clinical sites and a clinical pharmacologist with experience in PK and 
clinical trials.  Throughout the trial, the SRC will review all safety data at regular 
intervals , and the FDA  will receive annual IND reports.  
Supportive Care 
Inotropic support may be used to maintain mean arterial pressure above 65 mm Hg in 
patients who are hypotensive either before or after enrollment.  Dialysis or continuous 
veno- venous hemofiltration (CVVH), endotracheal intubation and mechanical 
ventilation will be considered as indicated. Cerebral edema will be managed post -
enrollment with mannitol or hypertonic saline per local institutional practices.  
Antibiotic therapy may be initiated and modified as required.  In patients who have 
intracranial pressure (ICP) monitors placed, ICP, cerebral perfusion pressure and mean 
arterial pressure will be recorded continuously and reported hourly.

 experiences CTCAE grade 1 or 2 adverse reactions or intolerance to the assigned dose, 
the investigator may choose to titrate back to the lower tolerated dose and closely 
monitor the patient. The infusion rate and dose may be discontinued if the patient 
experiences CTCAE grade 3 or higher, or an y time at the investigator’s discretion.  
Each dose l evel between  1 and 3 will be administered to Cohort 1 patients and safety 
and PK data reviewed , prior to exposing Cohort 2 patients to the study drug and 
subsequent dosing levels. Dose level 4 will be adm inistered to both Cohort 1 and 2 
beginning simultaneously. 
The d osing levels for Dose Levels 1 through 3 are defined follows: 
Dose Level 1 : 
Patients will receive  the initial infusion of study drug at 0.139 g/h for the first 12 hours 
(approximately 3.33 g/24h or 6.9 mL/h) and be maintained at this rate for up to 5 days. 
Dose Level 2 :   
For patients assigned to this dose level, the infusion will be initiated at 0.139 g/h for 
the first 12 hours (approx imately 3.33 g/24h) and increased to 0.277 g/h 
(approximately 6.65 g/24h or 13.8 mL/h) for the remainder of the treatment period. 
Dose Level 3 : 
For patients assigned to this dose level, the infusion will be initiated at 0.139 g/h for 
the first 12 hours (approximately 3.33 g/24h), increased to 0.277 g/h (approximately 
6.65 g/24h)  for the next  12 hours, and then increased  to 0.416 g/h (approximately 10 
g/24h or 20.8 mL/h) for the remainder of the treatment period. 
The d osing level for Dose Level 4  is defined follows : 
Dose Level 4 :  
For patients  in Cohorts 1 and 2, the infusion of OCR -002 will be initiated at 20g/24hr 
for a maximum time of 120 hours  (approximately .83g/h) , provided the dose level is 
well tolerated with no noteworthy side effects.  
Initiation of each higher dose for patients in Dose Levels 1 through 3 and continuation 
of study drug administration for patients in Dose Level 4 will occur only if there are 
no treatment emergent SAEs of CTCAE Grade 4 or higher that are not attributed to 
acute liver failure in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871].  
In all dose levels, if 1 out of the 3 patients within a dose group experiences a treatment 
emergent SAE of CTCAE Grade 3 that is not attributed to acute liver failure, then an 
additional patient will be enrolled into that specific dose group.  Within a given dose 
level, if 2 or more patients experience a treatment emergent SAE of CTCAE Grade 3 
that is not attributed to acute liver failure in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], then dose 
escalation (Dose Levels 1 through 3) or continuation of study drug administration 
(Dose Level 4) will stop.  Dose escalation or continuous administration also will stop 
if 1 patient experiences a Grade 4 or higher SAE that is not attributed to acute liver 
failure in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871].  Otherwise, dose escalation and continuous 
study drug administration will continue to the maximum tolerated dose and the 
remaining enrolled patients will be treated at this dose.  Further  details of dose

The Study Treatment listed below occurs in consecutive order.  After the completion of 
each Dose Level (for each Cohort) the SRC will receive a safety report.  
The first [ADDRESS_868481] minimal renal dysfunction ( Cohort 1) and will 
be treated at Dose Level [ADDRESS_868482] minimal renal 
dysfunction (Cohort 1) and will receive an initial infusion of study drug at 0.139 g/h for 
the first [ADDRESS_868483] six evalua ble Cohort 1 patients. If patient safety is confirmed, the next 3 Cohort 1 
patients (minimal renal dysfunction) will receive an initial infusion of study drug at 
Dose Level 3 for 12 hours.  The dose will be titrated to the maximum dose in Dose 
Level 3, provided previous dose levels are well -tolerated with no noteworthy side 
effects, to the maximum dose in Dose Level 3 for 96 hours.  
In parallel with the enrollment of Cohort 1 patients (minimal renal function) at Dose 
Level 3, three patients with compromised  renal function (Cohort 2) will be enrolled 
and treated at Dose Level 1 for five days. 
If patient safety is confirmed, three Cohort 2 patients (compromised renal function) 
may be enrolled and will be treated with an initial infusion at Dose Level 2 for 12 
hours.  The dose will be titrated, provided the previous dose level is well -tolerated 
with no noteworthy side effects, to the maximum dose in Dose Level 2 for 108 hours.  
The SRC will review the safety and PK data for Cohort 1 (minimal renal dysfunction) 
patients who received the study drug at Dose Level 3 and for Cohort 2 patients 
(compromised renal function) who received the study drug at Dose Levels 1 and 2 
prior to enrolling Cohort 2 patients into Dose Level 3.   
Once patient safety has been confirmed b y the SRC for Cohort 1 patients in Dose Level 
3, patients in Cohort 1 can begin to enroll into Dose Level 4 (20g/24hr) and will 
receive the full dose level from initiation of infusion for a maximum time of 120 hours , 
provided this dose is well tolerated with no noteworthy side effects. Once safety has 
been confirmed by [CONTACT_648261] 2 patients in Dose Level 3, patients in Cohort 2 
can begin to enroll into Dose Level 4 (20g /24hr) and will receive the full dose level 
from initiation of infusi on for a maximum time of 120 hours , provided this is well 
tolerated with no noteworthy side effects. If a patient experiences CTCAE grade 1 or 2 
adverse reactions or intolerance to the assigned dose, the investigator may choose to 
titrate to a lower dose in 5 g ram increments and closely monitor the patient. The 
infusion rate and dose may be discontinued if the patient experiences CTCAE grade 3 
or higher, or any time at the investigator’s discretion.

3.1 Introduction 
Acute liver failure (ALF) is a rare disorder affecting an estimated 2000 patients annually in the 
[LOCATION_002] (US).  Hepatotoxicity related to the use of acetaminophen is the most common 
etiology of ALF in the US (1) . 
Acute liver failure is the result of massive damage to previously normal liver parenchyma with 
resultant loss of liver function.  As the hepatocyte function is lost, the liver loses its ability to 
synthesize proteins and extract circulating toxins. The two cardinal signs of ALF, coagulopathy 
and encephalopathy, represent the loss of the ability to synthesize clotting factors and to 
remove ammonia, respectively.  
Acute liver failure often affects young people and carries a very high mortality.  Only 45% of patients with ALF will sp ontaneously recover. Of the remaining 55%, 30% will die and 25% 
will undergo an emergency liver transplantation.  Emergency liver transplantation in this setting has a 90% 1 -month survival rate and a 70% 1- year survival rate. Mortality in ALF can 
be due to a variety of factors, including sepsis and multi -organ system failure, but cerebral 
edema due to increased ammonia resulting in intracranial hypertension and brainstem 
herniation is one of the most common causes of death, accounting for 30% of the mortali ty in 
this population (2). 
There is strong experimental and clinical rationale for the use of ammonia -lowering therapi[INVESTIGATOR_648232]. Ammonia is normally produced in the gut and transformed by [CONTACT_648263].  As 
the liver fails, ammonia increases in the s ystemic circulation and enters into the brain. The 
result of a rapid rise in ammonia in the cerebral circulation is hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a reversible neuropsychiatric condition that ranges in severity from mild impairment in attention, 
to delirium,  coma and death.  A particular concern regarding HE in ALF is that ammonia level 
increases tend to be very rapid. This rapid rise in ammonia does not provide sufficient time for 
brain cells to compensate, with the end result being astrocyte swelling with increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and ultimately, death due to brain herniation. An arterial ammonia 
level above [ADDRESS_868488] 
universally indicative of increased intracranial pressure (3). 
Cereb ral edema in patients with ALF results from overloading brain astrocytes with ammonia. 
Astrocytes utilize the same mechanism as skeletal muscle to detoxify ammonia ( i.e., amidation 
of glutamate to glutamine via glutamine synthetase).  The resulting accumulation of brain 
glutamine results in impaired astrocyte osmoregulation, astrocyte swelling and cerebral edema (4-6).  Astrocytes contain counter -regulatory mechanisms to offset increased intracellular 
osmotic pressure, but compensate too slowly in the acute situation.  
Cortical astrocyte swelling is the most common neuropathological observation in post -mortem 
brains of ALF patients. Cerebral edema is found in up to 80% of patients who die of ALF and is nearly universal among patients with coma (7).There are clear associations between arterial ammonia levels, uncal herniation, and death in patients with ALF (3,8). There is also clear 
evidence of these associations in animal models of ALF(9-12). 
OCR -002 (L -ornithine·phenylacetate) is an ammonia detoxification ag ent that works by

eliminating ammonia in the circulation, with the expectation that it will result in a more rapid 
reduction than current therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and a lower incidence of cerebral edema.  
3.2 Physical, Chemical, and Biological Characteristics of OCR-002 
Background information on OCR -002 is summarized below.  More detailed information is  
provided in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
 
3.2.1 Chemistry  
OCR -002 is an ammonia detoxification agent and has the chemical name  L-
ornithine·phenylacetate ( L-ornithine·benzeneacetate salt (1:1), CAS -RN 952154-79- 9).  The 
molecular formula is C 8H7O2·C5H13N2O2and OCR -002 has a molecular weight of 268.31 
g/mole.  
OCR -002 drug substance is a new chemical entity and exists as a single crystalline molecular 
structure as an ornithine salt ofphenylacetate as shown below: 
Figure 1 :  L-ornithine·phenylacetate  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
3.2.2 
Summary of Nonclinical Safety Data  
The nonclinical safety of OCR -002 was evaluated in a comprehensive program of in vitro and 
in vivo studies which included evaluation of the potential undesirable pharmacodynamic effects 
of OCR -002 on physiological functions in relation to exposure in the t herapeutic range and 
above (safety pharmacology core battery), evaluation of the mutagenic and clastogenic 
potentials of OCR -002 ( in vitro test battery for genotoxicity), and evaluation of the short - and 
longer- term functional and morphologic effects assoc iated with OCR -002 exposure in whole 
animal models (mammalian toxicology program). The results of the OCR -002 toxicology 
program indicate a low potential for systemic toxicity in humans.  Please refer to the OCR -002 
Investigator’s Brochure for a detailed d iscussion. 
Further evidence of safety is provided by [CONTACT_46431] 20 years of clinical experience with Ammonul ® 
(sodium phenylacetate and sodium benzoate) Injection 10%/10% and Hepa -Merz™ (L - 
ornithine L -aspartate).  The safety profiles of these entities are discu ssed in the Investigator’s 
Brochure.  
3.3 Rationale for the Study and Dose Selection 
3.3.1 Rationale for the Study 
There is no established medical therapy for ALF (13).  Investigational agents such as charcoal  
 
ALFSG -OCR -[ADDRESS_868489] of care when analyzed in randomized controlled studies 
(14-17). Plasmapheresis and hepatectomy have been suggested as possible “bridges” to liver 
transplantation but a prospective trial of the former has been presented in abstract form only. 
Hypothermia has been investigated in a total of only 38 patients with ALF, all from Jalan, et al 
(18), and may be an effective bridge to liver transplantation (19). However, therapeutic 
hypothermia has considerable potential adverse effects and has never been shown to increase 
spontaneous (non- transplant) survival. External bio- artificial livers such as the MARS device 
have been employed, but use of these devices remains experimental, and the preliminary results have been generally disappointing (20). 
Treatment strategies focusing on the specific underlying conditions are, for the most part, of 
little or no use once ALF has occurred.  Corticosteroids for ful minant autoimmune hepatitis, 
chelation therapy for fulminant Wilson’s disease, and anti -viral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_648233] B have never been shown to be of benefit in the setting of ALF, and supportive care 
and liver transplantation are the only treat ment strategies that can be used in these patients (21 -
23). 
One notable exception to this is the use of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for ALF due to 
acetaminophen overdose.  NAC, a glutathione donor, is the antidote for acute acetaminophen 
toxicity, and it has been shown to improve outcome in these patients.  Importantly, it is most 
effective if administered within 8 -24 hours of t he overdose (24), which significantly limits its 
therapeutic impact.  It is mainly of benefit in patients who take an intentional overdose and then present rapi[INVESTIGATOR_648234].  Cases of accidental overdoses often present for medical 
attention after the effective window for NAC has closed. Similarly, patients taking an 
intentional overdose who do not seek care often present too late for NAC to be of maximum benefit (25). Recently, a controlled blinded study of NAC has shown evidence that it benefits 
non-acetaminophen -related ALF if given during early stages of encephalopathy (26).  
Thus, for the vast majority of patients with ALF, liver transplantation is the only recognized 
treatment option.  However, some patients cannot be transplanted due to the seve rity of their 
disease or a concomitant medical condition, and even patients who are listed may die waiting 
for a suitable organ to come available.  Transplantation is far from an ideal treatment, as short -
term survival for patients with ALF is lower than f or cirrhosis, with a 90% 1- month survival 
and 70% one -year survival (27, 28).  Transplantation also commits the patient to a lifetime of 
immune -compromising and toxic anti -rejection medications.  Additionally, some 
neurocognitive sequelae of increased intr acranial pressure persist after liver transplantation for 
ALF.  
In summary, therapeutic options in ALF are limited other than supportive care and liver 
transplantation. NAC is appropriate for early presentations of acetaminophen overdose and 
possibly is of value in other forms of ALF.  Management of fluid status, airway protection and 
infection control are important, and, for cerebral edema, mannitol or hypertonic saline are used to osmotically draw water from astrocytes, but are temporizing measures (28).  Usually, 
patients with intracranial hypertension who initially respond to mannitol or hypertonic saline 
die of cerebral herniation if not transplanted in short order.

  Do not duplicate  The above observations provide a strong rationale for using ammonia -lowering therapy in 
patients with ALF. Lactulose is widely used for this purpose in patients with cirrhosis, but has 
not been studied systematically in patients with ALF, and may obscure the surgical field at the 
time of liver transplantation due to gaseous distention of the bowel (28). Poorly absorbable antibiotics such as neomycin or rifaximin have also not been studied, and the former carries considerable risk of nephrotoxicity. A recent randomized, controlled study of L -ornithine L - 
aspartate (LOLA), a putative ammonia- lowe ring agent, found no improvement in blood 
ammonia concentrations or survival in patients with ALF (29). However, the rationale underlying the use of this agent may be flawed, since the compound provides a substrate (ornithine) for the production of glutamate and theoretically may lower ammonia by [CONTACT_648265], but does not provide a route of glutamine elimination from the body. Thus, 
glutamine persists in the circulation in patients receiving LOLA, and subsequently may be de -
amidated back to ammo nia and glutamate by [CONTACT_648266] (30). 
OCR -002 (ornithine·phenylacetate; OPA) is an ammonia detoxification agent with a better 
rationale for use in patients with hyperammonemia than LOLA. In contrast to LOLA, OPA not only provides a substrate for the synthesis of glutamate and thus glutamine, but also a route of elimination of glutamine in the urine as phenylacetylglutamine (PAGN) (14). The synergistic effects of L -ornithine and phenylacetate have been documented in validated pharmacology 
models of liv er failure, the devascularized ALF pig and the bile- duct ligated cirrhotic rat (31, 
32). In these animal models, reduction of the central target of OPA, ammonia, correlated with improvement in intracranial pressure and frontal brain water, which are associ ated with HE, as 
well as morbidity and mortality in humans with ALF.  The mechanism supporting elimination 
of glutamine via PAGN in urine has been confirmed in both models and supports the utility of 
the combination therapy for removal of waste nitrogen (ammonia) from the body. Another 
important feature of OPA pertains to the ability of PAGN to be dialyzed (33), a critical  
observation as many patients with ALF develop acute renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy.  
Patients with acetaminophen toxicity leading to acute liver injury or liver failure are optimal patients for the planned clinical study for several reasons. First, their liver injury is severe and 
occurs very rapi[INVESTIGATOR_155546] a prescribed time course, considered hyperacute (< 7 days) in 
durat ion. Second, acetaminophen patients comprise a large, relatively homogeneous patient 
group, are typi[INVESTIGATOR_648235]. Third and most importantly, they are at the highest risk for elevated ammonia levels and cerebral edema because of their young age and the 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_648236]. Renal failure can also be observed in this setting, presumed due to a direct effect of the drug on the renal tubular cells, and contributes to hyperammonemia and the risk of cerebral edema. Although the overall recovery rate is quite high after acetaminophen overdose despi[INVESTIGATOR_648237], many patients cannot be listed for 
transplantation because of the psychosocial issues which contributed to the overdose. 
In the current protocol, all patients will have been treated with NAC as standard -of-care for 
acetaminophen toxicity. There are no anticipated interactions between NAC and OCR -[ADDRESS_868490]

This Phase 2a clinical study is designed to provide data on OCR -002 in patients with ALF/ALI 
in regard to: 
(a) safety and tolerability;  
(b) metabolism of the compound to glutamine and phenylacetylglutamine;  
(c) its effect on circulating ammonia levels and neurological function in patients with and 
without impaired renal function after continuous infusion at different infusion rates. 
It is anticipated that this early safety and tolerability study, with appropriate PK/PD data, will 
lead to a development program for the use of OCR -002 in the treatment of hyperammonemia 
either due to ALF or even more generally, for ACLD. 
 
3.3.2 Rationale for Dose Selection  
Ocera Therapeutics , Inc. ( Durham , NC ) has conducted two clinical trials evaluating safety, 
tolerability and pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers (n=48) and stable cirrhotic patients 
(n=43).  
Clinical study OCR -002 H E201 was designed as a randomized, placebo- controlled, dose -
ranging study, evaluating doses (i.v. infusion) of 1, 3, 10, 20 and 30g given over 4h, and 30, 40 
and 60g given over 24h. Following a single ascending dose phase, a multiple ascending dose  
phase (5d of consecutive administration) for doses of 1, 3, 10 and 20g given over 4h was 
assessed. The key find ings in this study included: 
There were no deaths, SAE or AE discontinuations in the study. 
A dose related increase in the incidence and severity of adverse events was observed.  
Commonly occurring adverse events that appeared to be related to dose included 
dizziness, somnolence, headache, nausea/vomiting and tinnitus. 
There was no evidence to suggest that AEs increased or new AEs occur with multiple 
dosing. 
With respect to blood pressure, there were no apparent trends from placebo with 
respect to mean chang es from baseline; however at dose levels ≥20g/4h, several 
patients experienced clinically significant orthostatic hypotension. 
There appeared to be a dose and exposure related increase in mean heart rate starting 
at a dose level of 10g/4 h and higher. These effects also persisted for longer periods in 
the higher dose groups. 
20g administered over 4 h was the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), however, doses 
of 10g/4h and below were well tolerated. 
24h Holter monitor recording identified a dose -related increase in heart rate 
accompanied by [CONTACT_648267]. 
These effects should be interpreted with caution in light of the small sample size and 
higher heart rates observed in this study. 
There were no clinically significant abnormal laboratory parameters and no patient 
had any clinically significant changes in physical examination findings or mean

Version 5.0      Confidential Information  
  Do not duplicate  change in body weight between baseline and follow up. 
Doses higher than 10g/4h are associated with adverse effects that may  be rate and 
Cmax related and are likely associated with the non -linear pharmacokinetic profile of 
phenylacetate above 10 g.  
A slower infusion rate (24hr -infusion) avoids C max related adverse effects while 
providing similar excretion of PAGN. 
In aggregate, these studies support ed an initial study using a 10g/[ADDRESS_868491] study of 
OCR -002 conducted in patients with ALF, the administration of the study drug in t hree 
ascending dose levels (Dose Levels 1 through 3) will be implemented as follows and in the 
protocol for up to 24 evaluable subjects: 
The maximum target infusion rate will be 0.42g/h, which is equivalent to 10g 
administered over 24h. 
The infusion rate will be staged for each patient. The initial infusion rate will be 0.14g/h 
(33% of target dose). The dose will be then increased to 0.28g/h (66% target), and 
0.42g/h (100% target) in successive 12h intervals based on a patient safety evaluation by [CONTACT_18413].  
Patient safety and tolerability at an increased loading dose are supported by [CONTACT_648268] 2 OP -GIB 
conducted in Spain, in which cirrhotic patients with active ga strointestinal hemorrhage receive 
double- blind treatment, i.e., placebo or OCR -002 at 10 g per 24 hours as a constant intravenous 
infusion for 5 days.  
Ocera began over a year ago a large ongoing trial of OCR -002 in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_648238] (OCR002 -HE209, STOP -HE). In STOP -HE, a 
placebo -controlled, randomized, double -blind clinical trial designed to evaluate the s afety, 
pharmacokinetics and efficacy of intravenously -administered OCR -[ADDRESS_868492] of care, at doses of 20, 15, or 10 grams over 24 hours based on the patient's degree 
of liver impairment.  In this study, there is no ascending or loading dose being implemented.  
Therefore, up to 12 additional evaluable  patients  will be enrolled at Dose Level 4 as listed 
below: 
Dose Level 4 : For  patients assigned to this dose level, the infusion will be initiated at 
the full dose level of 20g/24hr for a maximum time of 120 hours  (approximately 
.83g/h), provided the dose level is well tolerated with no noteworthy side effects.

5 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
5.1 Study Design  
This is a Phase 2a, multi -center, open -label study, conducted in two cohorts in patients 
 
ALFSG -OCR -002 September 22, 2015   Page 22 
Version 5.0      Confidential Information  
  Do not duplicate  diagnosed with acute liver failure/ severe acute liver injury (ALF/ALI) who meet 
inclusion/exclusion criteria.  The acetaminophen adduct assay will be used as an additi onal test 
for equivocal or presumed cases of acetaminophen  toxicity,  where the history is not 
substantiated and the assay for acetaminophen itself proves to be negative.   
Up to 36 evaluable patients are planned to be enrolled in two cohorts: 
Cohort 1 wil l include patients with ALF/ALI with minimal renal dysfunction at the time of 
enrollment (defined as  serum creatinine ≤1.5mg/dL and mean arterial pressure of >65 
mmHg).  
Cohort 2 will include patients with ALF/ALI with compromised renal function (defined as  a 
serum creatinine >1.5  mg/dL and <10mg/dL ) and mean arterial pressure of >65 mmHg.    
Informed consent will be obtained from the patient and/or patient’s legally authorized 
representative or family member [as defined in  21CFR50.3(m)]. All patients will re ceive 
medical care for  acute liver failure/severe acute liver injury according to the institution’s 
standards of care.  Standard of care may include, but is not limited to, administration of NAC 
and consideration for orthotopic liver transplantation.  All patients in Cohort 2 with a serum Cr 
level of ≥2.0 will be considered for placement on continuous veno- venous hemodialysis 
(CVVHD) for an appropriate interval as standard of care for this condition. 
The initial dose of OCR -[ADDRESS_868494] been completed.   The infusion may 
begin after obtaining signed informed consent; or, up to 32 h after obtaining consent should the 
time be necessary to  complete any pre -study drug initiation requirements and/or to provide a 
time frame for study drug administration.  
Treatment Day 1 -Time “0” (T0) is the start of the initial infusion.  At this  time, each patient in 
Dose Levels 1 through 3 will receive an i nitial infusion rate of OCR -002; thereafter, up and 
down titration decisions will be based on patient tolerability, clinical safety assessments (refer 
to Treatment below), and the patient’s status within the assigned dose level.  Each dose 
escalation will be administered to Cohort [ADDRESS_868495] Infusion.  
Urine samples will be collected at specific intervals to determine the amount of PAGN 
excreted/synthesized.  
Patients will be assessed for safety and exploratory efficacy of OCR -002 as well as 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variables for up to a 6- day period which includes up to 
5 days (maximum of 120 h) of infusion, at the Completion of the Last Infusion, and at [ADDRESS_868496] treatment period .  The total intended enrollment is  approximately 18 patients with 
minimal renal dysfunction and approximately 18 with compromised renal function. Enrollment 
will be discontinued when 36 evaluable patients are enrolled .  
Supportive Care 
Inotropic support may be used to  maintain mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg in patients 
who are hypotensive either before or after enrollment.  Dialysis or continuous veno-venous 
hemofiltration (CVVH), endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation will be considered 
as indicated.  Cerebral edema will be managed according to local practice with mannitol or 
hypertonic saline. Antibiotic therapy may be initiated and modified as required.   In patients 
who have intracranial pressure (ICP) monitors placed , as determined by [CONTACT_648269] c are at 
each institution , the ICP (if available)  and cerebral perfusion pressure  will be monitored 
continuously, in addition to the  mean arterial pressure, and reported hourly during the period of 
active study drug infusion. 
5.2 Continuous Infusion Rate Adjustments  
OCR -002 will be infused intravenously (IV) for up to 5 days (0 to 120 h).  The Dosing regimen 
for Cohorts 1 and 2 is as follows:  
Dose Level 1 :  Patients  will receive the initial infusion of study drug at 0.139 g/h for the first 
12 h (approximately 3.33 g/24h) and maintained at this rate for up to 120h.   
Dose Level 2 :  Patients  will receive an initial infusion of study drug at a dose of 0.139 g/h for 
the first 12 hours (approximately 3.33 g/24h).  The dose will be increased to 0.277 g/h for the 
next 108h (approximately 6.65 g/24h), and maintained at this rate for the remaining treatment 
period, provided the previous dose level is well - tolerated with no noteworthy side effects and 
no safety signa ls are apparent .   
Dose Level 3 :  Patients  will receive an initial infusion of study drug at a dose of 0.139 g/h for 
the first 12 h (approximately 3.33 g/24h).  The dose will be increased to 0.277 g/h for the next 
12 hours, and then increased to 0.416 g/h (approximately 10 g/24h) and maintained at this rate 
 
ALFSG -OCR -002 September 22, 2015   Page 24 
Version 5.0      Confidential Information  
  Do not duplicate  for the remaining treatment period , provided previous dose levels are  well- tolerated with no 
noteworthy side effects  and no safety signals are apparent. 
Dose Level 4 :  Patients will receive an infusion of study drug at a dose of 20g/24h from 
initiation of infusion for a maximum time of 120  hours, provided the dose level  is well 
tolerated with no noteworthy side effects  and no safety signals are apparent.  
If a patient experiences CTCAE grade 1 or 2 adverse reactions or intolerance to the assigned 
dose, the investigator may choose to titrate to a lower dose in 5g increments and closely 
monitor the patient. The infusion rate and dose may be discontinued if the patient experiences 
CTCAE grade 3 or higher, or any time at the investigator’s dis cretion .  (See Section 9.7 of the 
protocol for details on safety review, dose escalation and trial stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418].)

family member, although both consents may be obt ained.  
For those with ALF, the patient’s legally authorized representative or family member must 
provide written informed consent and provide authorization to disclose the patient’s protected health information in order to enroll in the study.  The informed consent process 
will be conducted per institutional protocol and in compliance with applicable IRB requirements. Written informed consent must be obtained from  the patient’s legally 
authorized representative or family member before any study related activities are conducted.  The Investigator must retain all original signed and dated informed consent 
forms (ICF’s) (together with any subsequent IRB -approved amended versions) in the 
patient ’s file.  A copy of the original signed and dated ICF (and any amendments) must be 
provided to the patient and/or the patient’s legally authorized representative or family 
member.   
If any new information that significantly bears on the patient’s risk after receiving the study 
drug becomes available, the new information will be communicated by [CONTACT_648271]’s legally authorized representative or family member.  The ICF 
will be updated and patient’s le gally authorized representative or family member will be re-
consented if necessary (e.g., if patient still in the study and/or local IRB requires re -
consent).

Identification of the patient for whom the infusion was prepared, including the patient 
identification number assigned for the study. 
Date and quantity of drug prepared for each patient. Any product accidentally or deliberately destroyed.  
The inventory must be available for inspection during the study by [CONTACT_11200].  All  
study drug supplies (used and unused) will be accounted for on the Study Drug 
Accountability Log. 
Following reconciliation, the empty or partially used vials should be destroyed according to 
the standard operating procedures (SOPs) established by [CONTACT_648274].  The Investigator will document the destruction of any study drug supplies. 
At the end of the study, unused drug supplies will be destroyed by [CONTACT_648275], provided that such disposition does not  expose humans to 
risks from study drug.  Records shall be maintained by [CONTACT_648276], which must show the identification and quantity of each unit 
disposed of, the method of destruction (taking into account the requirements of local law), and the person who disposed of study drug. 
7.4 Timing of Dosing and Administration of OCR-002 Infusion 
Study drug dosing should be initiated as soon as possible upon admission to the registry but only after obtaining informed cons ent, ensuring all eligibility criteria are confirmed to be met and 
completing the initial baseline evaluation period.  The window between obtaining informed consent and initiation of OCR -002 infusion may be up to  32 hrs in order to complete any pre-
study drug initiation requirements and/or to provide a time frame for study drug administration . 
Each cohort will receive a continuous infusion of OCR -002 for up to 5 days (between 0 to 120 
hours).  
7.5 Treatment Compliance  
Staff of the clinical study unit will supervise the IV infusion of study drug. The date and time 
of infusion start, infusion stop, and the total volume administered will be documented in the source records. In the case of interruption of infusion for any reason, the study drug will not be 
restarted if more than 2 hours has elapsed. If for any reason the infusion is interrupted or 
stopped prior to the full administration, the times and circumstances of the 
interruption/stoppage will be recorded.  It is anticipated that patients will continue to remain in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34092] a minimum of three days after start of study.  
7.[ADDRESS_868505] of care and their use is prohibited during the study  period , as is the use of 
therapeutic hypothermia . However, spontaneous (non-induced) hypothermia of a mild -to-
moderate degree does not require correction. 
7.[ADDRESS_868506] be available during the confinement periods, 
together with personnel trained to deal with medical emergencies. The Investigator (or other 
co-investigator on the study team) must be readily available at all times until patients have 
completed the treatment period . 
Prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], patients will be evaluated to determine if there are any clinically 
significant changes from baseline.  Patients with significant findings must remain in the  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_648240]/or treatment until the condition is either explained, 
resolved, or no longer requires close observation. Any patient who develops an SAE will be followed until a probable diagnosis and the relationship to study drug have been determined, 
and until the AE has resolved, no longer require s further follow -up, or a new chronic baseline 
has been established.  
 
8 STUDY PROCEDURES BY [CONTACT_648277]. 
8.1 Screening  
Patients will be evaluated for entry into the study according to the stated inclusion and 
exclusion criteria.  Individuals who are identified during screening as not eligible for the study 
need not complete all screening procedures. The reason for ineligible status will be documented 
on the Screen Failure Log.  
The following procedures will be obtained or performed to evaluate each patient’s general  
health and qualifications for participation in the study:  
• Demographic information including gender, date of birth, race and ethnicity; 
• Medical and m edication history over the past 30 days, including prescription and non-
prescription over-the-counter medications, herbal medications, vitamins, and minerals; 
• Collection of blood for hematology, coagulation, clinical chemistry, ammonia* and in female patients, a pregnancy test **; 
* Venous  sampling  is the protocol -preferred method of collection for ammonia 
samples.  Arterial ammonia samples will be accepted if this is the available method; however, this same method should be used for all subsequent ammonia 
samples for the patient.

* Non- serious adverse events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) are collected 
from Treatment Day [ADDRESS_868508] treatment period.   
 
9 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS 
Details for safety assessments will be recorded in both the CRF and the patient’s source 
documents. During the study, the Investigator or study site personnel will be responsible for querying and recording AEs and SAEs.  Adverse events will be recorded from the start of the 
initial administration of OCR -002 (Treatment Day 1 -T0) until [ADDRESS_868509] medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in  
humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
An adverse event:   
• can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the medicinal product whether or not considered related to the medicinal product ; 
• can arise from any use of the drug (e.g., off -label use in combination with another 
drug) and from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose; and/or 
• can be any sign or symptom not present at baseline, or if present at baseline, worsens 
in frequency and/or severity, independent of causal relationship to the investigational product.  
9.1.2 Expected Adverse Events (with respect to study drug)  
An AE or SAR is considered “expected” if: it is listed in the investigational brochure (IB); or, it is listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an IB is not required, it is consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan. These 
adverse events are identified in the Investigator Brochure as possibly associated with the study 
drug, and therefore would be considered EXPECTED adverse events: 
 Tachycardia  
 Hypotension 
 Dizziness  
 Nausea  
 Vomiting

  Do not duplicate   Headache  
 Chills  
 Somnolence 
 Restlessness 
Acute liver failure is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.  Specifically,  
acetaminophen ALF carries a 28 -30% mortality, while ALI carries a 10% mortality. Given 
these circumstances, determining drug effect and a causal relationship is particularly difficult. 
The following is a list of signs and symptoms that are expected to occur in patients with ALF or ALI.   These events will be collected and recorded but will not be reported on an 
expedited basis (e.g., IND safety report) unless the event otherwise qualifies for 
expedited reporting.

ALFSG -OCR -002 September 22, 2015   Page 41 
Version 5.0      Confidential Information  
  Do not duplicate  Pre-existing medical conditions or unchanged, chronic medical conditions 
All medical conditions present upon arrival to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_648241] -existing conditions and are part of the patient’s medical 
history. Those events that manifest with the same severity, frequency, or duration subsequent 
to study drug administration need not be recorded as adverse events.  These medical 
conditions should be documented adequately on the medical history and/or physical examination CRFs.  
Pre-existing medical conditions or unchanged, chronic medical conditions consistent with 
natural disease progression are NOT considered AEs unless the  pre-existing medical condition 
is judged by [CONTACT_648278].   
Exacerbation of Pre-existing medical conditions  
A pre -existing medical condition judged by [CONTACT_648279] [ADDRESS_868511] treatment period. 
Lab Abnormalities 
If a clinically significant lab abnormality is considered an expected manifestation of the pre-
existing disease, it may  not require AE reporting if it does not indicate treatment -emergent 
worsening or new evolution of a medical condition. 
Treatment -emergent laboratory abnormalities (e.g., clinical chemistry, hematology, 
urinalysis), or other investigational studies (e.g., ECGs, X -rays) independent of an underlying 
medical condition that (a) require medical or surgical intervention or (b) le ad to 
investigational medicinal product interruption or discontinuation must be recorded as AEs . If 
a new laboratory abnormality, ECG or radiographic finding is associated with new signs 
and/or symptoms (clinical manifestations) an AE should be recorded, e ither reflective of the 
abnormality based on the specific investigation(s) or the overall medical condition which is 
the etiology of that abnormality.  
 
9.1.4 Adverse Reaction  
An adverse reaction is any adverse event caused by a drug.  
 
9.1.5 Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR) is any adverse event for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. 
For purposes of IND safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to 
suggest a  causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. A SAR implies a lesser 
degree of certainty about the causality than an adverse reaction where the adverse event is caused by [CONTACT_33641].  
Suspected adverse reactions are a subset of all adverse events for which there is a “reasonable possibility” that the drug caused the event.  A “reasonable possibility” exists if there is 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event, such as:   
 
ALFSG -OCR -002 September 22, 2015   Page 42 
Version 5.0      Confidential Information  
  Do not duplicate   A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly 
associated with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, blood dyscrasias, rhabdomyolysis, 
Stevens -Johnson Syndrome, anaphylaxis) 
 One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly associated with drug 
exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug (e.g., 
tendon rupture) 
 An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as known 
consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other 
events that commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group than in 
a concurrent or historical control group. 
 
9.1.6 Unexpected Adverse Event or Suspected Adverse Reaction  
An AE or SAR is considered “unexpected” if: it is not listed in the investigational brochure  
(IB); or, it is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an IB is not 
required, it is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan.  “Unexpected” also refers to AEs or SARs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with 
a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not 
specifically mentioned   as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
9.2 Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE or SAR that results in any of the following outcomes: 
1.   Death; 
2.   A life -threatening AE (this refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at 
the time of the event and not to an event which hypothetically might have caused death 
if it were more severe.); 
3.   In- patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ; 
4.   Prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
5.   A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions; 
6.   A congenital anomaly/birth defect; 
7.   An important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in

Serious adverse events should not be reported for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_648243]: for a diagnostic or elective surgical procedure related to a pre - 
existing condition; to allow for an efficacy measure for the study; or, for a planned surgical procedure that was not the result of a condition worsening due to participation in the study. 
When reporting AEs, SAEs, or SARs, the Investigator should avoid colloquialisms and 
abbreviations and use correct medical terminology. Additionally, if known at the time of 
reporting, a diagnosis should be reported rather than individual signs and symptoms . If a

who do not complete the entire course of study drug administration. Adverse events that do not 
meet the definition of “serious” or “suspected adverse reactions” will be reviewed periodically throughout the trial to identify any previously unidentified trends or other safety issues. 
In order to ensure prompt reporting of adverse events, we require that all non-serious adverse 
events must be entered into the WebDCU
TM database system within [ADDRESS_868513]  
Infusion study phases (e.g., Day 1 phase is Tuesday,  02JAN2012; any AEs occurring in that 
phase must be entered into the WebDCUTM database system no later than  Monday , 
09JAN2012). 
9.[ADDRESS_868514] to serious adverse events and suspected adverse reactions, both expected and 
unexpected and regardless of whether the SAE/SARs are considered related to the study drug and/or the disease, they will be followed in a rigorous review process through the entire trial 
period.  Clinical performance sites are instructed to report all fatal events, unanticipated 
problems and other serious adverse events and suspected adverse reactions in the WebDCU
TM 
database system within [ADDRESS_868515] be entered to allow for timely review by [CONTACT_648280] (IMM) and the independent external Medical Safety Monitor (MSM).  In 
adjudicating cases at UT Southwestern, an alternate IMM  will serve in place of  the IMM . 
The clinical site Investigator, on the basis of his or her clinical judgment and the following 
definitions, determines the relationship of the adverse event to the protocol intervention as one of 
the following:   
• Definitely: any adverse reaction and those adverse events that cannot be reasonably 
explained by [CONTACT_4867], e.g., concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s). The relationship in time is very suggestive, e.g., it is confirmed by [INVESTIGATOR_5328]- challenge and re -
challenge.  
• Probably: An AE that might be due to the use of the study agent. The relationship in time is suggestive, e.g., confirmed by [INVESTIGATOR_5328] -challenge. An alternative explanation is less likely,

e.g., concomitant drug(s), conc omitant disease(s); and, other causes have been eliminated 
or are unlikely. 
• Possibly: An AE that might be due to the use of the study drug. An alternative 
explanation, e.g., concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s) is inconclusive. The relationship in t ime is reasonable; therefore, the causal relationship cannot be excluded 
and while other potential causes may or may not exist, a causal relationship to the study drug does not appear probable. 
• Unlikely: An AE for which an alternative explanation is more likely, e.g., concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s), and/or the relationship in time suggests that a causal relationship is unlikely or that there is a clear alternate cause that is more likely to have caused the adverse event than the study drug. 
• Not related: An AE for which there is no possible relationship (i.e., the temporal 
relationship between drug exposure and the adverse event onset/course is unreasonable or incompatible; or a causal relationship to study drug is implausible).  
The clinical site  investigator in making determinations of the severity of the adverse event 
should consider the following for the four classes of severity of the event as it occurred:  
• Mild/Grade 1: does not interfere with daily living and no medications are needed to relieve event;  
• Moderate/Grade 2: somewhat interferes with daily living or medications needed to relieve event;  
• Severe/Grade 3: incapacitating, activities of daily living are prohibited because of the event ; 
• Life threatening or Death/Grade 4 . 
Serious advers e events and suspected adverse reactions are collected from the start of the time 
of enrollment through study completion, i.e., Day 30, death, or withdrawal of consent. 
9.5 Review of Serious Adverse Events and Suspected Adverse Reactions  
Upon entry of a serious adverse event or suspected adverse reaction in the WebDCU
TM 
system, the system triggers automatic e -mail notification of the SAE/SAR to the Project 
Manager and the IMM. When the SAE/SAR report has been reviewed and deemed to be 
adequate, the SAE/SAR is forwarded  by [CONTACT_648281]. 
The MSM conducts independent reviews of all SAEs and SARs entered into WebDCUTM.  
Should the IMM or MSM need additional patient data to conduct his/her review, those data may 
be accessed on the WebDCUTM. The MSM submits his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_648244] (a) in fact, serious, ( b) unexpected, and (c) related (with reasonable possibility) to the study 
drug within [ADDRESS_868516] the site for 
more information or discussion. Should it be determined that the narrative included in the SAE/SAR needs to be  amended or enhanced, the SAE/SAR case report form will be returned 
electronically to the clinical site investigator for enhance ment or amendment. If the Investigator 
and the MSM believe the SAE or SAR is serious, study drug- related (reasonable possibility, 
probably or definitely), and unexpected, the SAE or SAR requires expedited reporting. When 

 
ALFSG -OCR -[ADDRESS_868517] Manager (PM) 
contacts the site with instructions for completion of a safety report form.  A safety report form (pre-populated with previously entered CRF data) is automatically posted in the WebDCU
TM 
system and the site staff enters any remaining required information. Following the site’s completion of the  safety report form, the PM submits the report to the FDA within the 
regulatory timelines. The initial safety report for a SAE/S AR that was fatal or life -threatening 
will be submitted to the FDA within 7 days of the Executive Committee being made aware of 
the SAE; if the event was not life - threatening or did not result in death, the report will be 
submitted to the FDA within 15 da ys of the Executive Committee being made aware of the 
SAE/SAR.  
The safety report filed with the FDA is posted on the WebDCU
TM. The PM notifies, via email, 
the Safety Review Committee (SRC), Ocera Therapeutics , Inc., the Trial Executive Committee 
members and all participating clinical site PIs and Study Coordinators (SCs) that an expedited 
safety report has been filed with the FDA and is available for review on the WebDCUTM (a link 
to the document is provided i n the email communication).  Each clinical site PI [INVESTIGATOR_648245].  
 Follow-Up Reporting of Expedited Serious Adverse Events/ Suspected Adverse Reactions  
After the submission of the initial safety report, the clinical site staff is responsible for obtaining 
any follow -up information about the SAE/SAR.  All follow -up information should be actively 
sought by [CONTACT_648282].  The PM distributes the follow -up safety report to all parties receiving the 
initial report.

  Do not duplicate  9.7 Safety Review Committee  
The Safety Review Committee (SRC) will consist of three experienced ALFSG clinicians and a 
clinical pharmacologist with experience in clinical trials and PK measurement. All are 
independent of any clinical site participating in the trial and will exercise oversight of the 
safety of trial participants, review periodic safety reports prepared by [CONTACT_648283], request additional data/information (if necessary), and advise the trial Sponsor and Executive 
Committee regarding continuation/discontinuation of the study.  A primary responsibility of the 
SRC is to review the safety and PK data (as pr ovided by [CONTACT_80938]) and to provide 
recommendations on proceeding to the next dose level.  
Throughout the trial the SRC will review all safety data at regular intervals  and after each dose 
level in each cohort .  In addition, the SRC  will review safety and PK data for the evaluable 
Cohort [ADDRESS_868519]. The finding of any unexpected SAEs of Grade 3 that are considered not related to 
acute liver failure  in 2 or more patients within a given dose level or of Grade 4 or higher in 
one patient will lead to suspension of recruitment and review of the complete data by [CONTACT_648284].  Following the MSM’s review, the safety report (and any comments from the MSM)  
will be sent to the SRC. The SRC will make the final recommendation for early termination versus continuation of the study after reviewing the available data.  The decision will be guided by [CONTACT_49874].  
If the SRC does not stop the trial, the  trial will proc eed with enrollment  as outlined in section 
9.[ADDRESS_868520] Results  
Blood and urine will be collected at Screening, Baseline (blood only), Treatment  Day 1  -T0 
(urine only) , Treatment Day s 1, 2, 3, [ADDRESS_868521] I nfusion (or Treatment Discontinuation date) 
for safety laboratory tests to be conducted at local laboratories.  Safety assays include:   
• Liver  function tests  (LFTs):  Total  bilirubin, alkaline  phosphatase, alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST/SGOT) ; 
• Coagulation: Prothrombin time reported as the international normalized ratio (INR) ; 
and 
• Urinalysis: dipstick plus microscopic evaluation of sediment if clinically indicated.  
Any laboratory test result considered by [CONTACT_190373]. 
If clinically significant abnormal laboratory values occur during the trial, the patient may be 
retested regularl y until repeat test results return to normal, stabilize, or are no longer 
clinically significant.  
Other Safety Assessments  
Vital signs (blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]) will be measured at Screening, Baseline, Treatment Days [ADDRESS_868522] Infusion inclusively. Height will be 
measured once (at Screening).  
Physical examinations will be performed at Screening, Baseline , Treatment Days 1,  2, 3, [ADDRESS_868523] Infusion, inclusively (or Treatment Discontinuation Visit).  
Single 12- lead ECGs will be performed at Screening , Baselin e, Treatment Days 1,  2, 3, [ADDRESS_868524] Infusion, inclusively and will be evaluated locally according to usual site procedures. 
Inter -current Illness and Pre- Existing Diseases  
Inter -current illnesses, including signs/symptoms of a pre -existing disease state (medical 
history), that are present at or before study drug administration (including those that manifest  
between signature [CONTACT_648299]) are to be recorded 
as medical history/pre -existing conditions. Those events that manifest with the same severity, 
frequency, or duration subsequent to study drug administration need not be recorded as AEs.  
However, incidents for which there is an increase in severity or duration of the inter -current 
illness or pre-existing disease must be reported on the AE CRF.

10.1 Data Processing 
Data management is handled by [CONTACT_648285] (referred to in this document as 
the SDCC), which is housed in the Department of Public Health Sciences  at the Medical 
University of South Carolina (MUSC).  All activities are conducted in coordination with the 
Trial Executive Committee and the Clinical Centers. Case Report Forms (CRFs) have been developed by [CONTACT_648286]. Electron ic copi[INVESTIGATOR_648246]. The study database has been developed in Microsoft SQL Server based on the approved CRFs. This system allows for we b-based data 
entry and management.  The data are captured and entered (single keyed) at the Clinical 
Centers via the web interface. Data must be entered into the database at the Clinical Centers 
within 5 days of assessment/data collection. The data are man aged (including data  queries) by 
[CONTACT_648287] a secured Trial website.  
During the design of the database, automated consistency checks and data validation rules are 
programmed to check for potential data errors, including missing required data, data out of pre -
specified range, data conflicts and disparities within and among the CRFs. All validation rules 
are outlined in the Data Management Plan generated by [CONTACT_80938].  In addition to the study database, the SDCC provides the Clinical Center staff access (via password) to a standard set of 
web-enabled tools, including patient visit calendar, accrual status, CRF completion status, and 
outstanding DCR status pertaining to their respective Centers. 
The SDCC develops, validates, and maintains the study database and provides independent 
oversight and management of the flow, entry, and quality assurance of data collection 
activities.  The SDCC also provides statistical support, including reports to the SRC and 
Medical Safety Monitor; and, where necessary, shields blinded investigators from access to unblinded data during the performance of the trial.  The SDCC is responsible for the enrollment 
scheme, final statistical analysis plan and final data analysis.

10.3 Data Quality Assurance  
Upon entry of CRFs into the study database, quality control procedures will be applied at each 
stage of data handling in order to ensure integrity of the study data and document processing system reliability.   An appointed site monitor will perform reviews of source documents and 
case report form informa tion at the sites to confirm accuracy of data capture.  The STOP -ALF 
Site Monitoring Plan details the monitoring plan and facilitates compliance with Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, applicable FDA regulations (21 CFR 812 and 813), and the FDA’s “G uidance for Industry: Oversight of Clinical Investigations - A Risk -Based 
Approach to Monitoring”.  The monitoring plan includes a  combination of central, remote and 
on-site monitoring, and these findings will be used to identify and correct problems in da ta 
collection.  
To ensure monitoring responsibilities are performed to the fullest extent possible, an 
experienced independent clinical research associate(s) (monitor) performs data verification for 
the trial either on -site or remotely, should direct access to patients’ electronic medical records 
be permitted by [CONTACT_8236].  For the first evaluable patient enrolled at any site, 100% of the 
data will be verified to source documents.  For subsequent patients , a checklist of key outcome 
and safety data variables requiring source document verification (SDV) has been developed based on the trial’s safety and efficacy endpoints.  The checklist ensures that a target of no less than 40% of the clinical data submitted to the STOP -ALF database are verified against source 
documents at the performance sites prior to finalization of the database. Of the data on the 
checklist, the safety and efficacy variables represent approximately half of the data to be 
verified. The r emaining half of source monitored data include: 100% of deaths and 100% of 
serious adverse events and source data reviews based on the per -patient evaluation of safety 
parameters defined in the protocol. All data monitored on site are verified for accuracy  and 
thoroughness using the most appropriate source documents for all patients. 
Signed informed consent documents and HIPAA documentation are monitored for all patients, along with those items outlined in the STOP -ALF Site Monitoring Plan.  
 
Any omissions and corrections to data submitted to the WebDCU™ database are noted and 
queries are generated either on -site or remotely by [CONTACT_648289]/or centrally by [CONTACT_648290]. 
The monitor may conduct a close -out monitoring visit either on -site or remotely, as determined 
by [CONTACT_648291], amount and nature of outstanding items to be monitored, and if the monitor’s direct access to the s ubjects’ electronic 
medical record has been permitted by [CONTACT_8236]. During a Site Closeout Visit, the monitor should follow the site close -out guidelines outlined in the current version of the STOP -ALF 
Site Monitoring Plan .

11.4 Analysis Population  
The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will include all patients who consented to the study, 
completed screening and were initiated intravenous infusion of study drug.  The ITT population will serve as the basis for a sensitivity analysis of the PP results for all endpoints . 
The per- protocol (PP) population (evaluable population) will include all patients who receive 
at least 72h of OCR -002 in accordance with protocol timelines.  The PP population will be 
used for the primary analysis of all outcomes. 
The safety population will include all patients who comple ted screening and were enrolled 
into the trial.  
11.5 Interim Analysis  
There are no interim analyses planned as this is an open -label study; however, safety data will 
be reviewed by [CONTACT_648292]. In addition to specific dose 
level reports , quarterly safety reports on all enrolled patients will be provided to the SRC 
during the study period.  These reports will include summary tables overall and by [CONTACT_648293], treatment completions and reasons for early treatment 
withdrawals, study completions rates and all outcomes related to safety information including all adverse events and serious adverse events.

accuracy and compliance by [CONTACT_648297] (CRA/monitor) during monitoring visits to participating clinical sites.  
12.3 Source Documents  
As defined in Section 1.52 of the ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (ICH E6), source documents may include:  original documents, data, and records (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]; clinical and office charts; laboratory notes; memoranda; patient’s diaries or evaluation checklists; pharmacy dispensing records; recorded data from automated instruments; copi[INVESTIGATOR_648250]; microfiches; 
photographic negatives; microfilm or magnetic media; x -rays; and patient files and records kept 
at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico -technical departments involved in the 
clinical study).  
Source documents are considered to be all information in original records and certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_34504], observations, data or other activities in a clinical study necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the study. 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_648251].   Source documents are the originals of any documents used by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_54720]-
Investigator or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/institution that allow verification of the existence of the patien t and 
substantiate the integrity of the data collected during the trial.  
The study CRFs will be available in printable format on the study website. The CRFs for each 
patien t must be completed only by [CONTACT_236553] [INVESTIGATOR_648252].  All data entered into the CRF must also be available in the

1.0 Purpose of  the Study:
The purpose of  this study is to assess the function and reliability of a non-
invasive, skin-like electronic sensor. We hypothesize that this skin sensor will 
address an unmet need to wirelessly and noninvasively monitor and characterize 
the recovery process in post-operative patients who have undergone anterior 
cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). Specifically, we will validate the use of 
the sensor in this patient population through monitoring of key physiological 
signals in the recovery process, including heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], swallow 
count, talking time, energy expenditure, neck specific motion, and body 
orientation.
2.0 Background  / Literature Review / Rationale for the study:
Dysphagia, dysphonia,  and loss of cervical range of motion (ROM) are common 
complications after anterior cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_79477], specifically anterior cervical 
discectomy and fusion (ACDF). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_322784], studies on the 
treatment and/or prevention of these complications are limited due to the lack 
of valid and reliable outcome measures. The majority of research is found in the 
otolaryngology literature and has focused on disease pathophysiology, diagnosis, 
and therapy.
 
Dysphagia and  dysphonia are widely measured by [CONTACT_18654]-reported 
questionnaires, including the MD Anderson Dysphasia Inventory and SWAL-QOL. 
However, these validated outcome tools are cumbersome to complete and, 
therefore, have not been widely accepted into clinical practice, including in post-
operative ACDF patients. The Bazaz score, a subjective questionnaire that has 
not been validated in the literature, has also been used to evaluate dysphagia 
after ACDF. Assessment using the Bazaz score is based on clinical examination, 
with the surgeon listening to the patient's voice and documenting hoarseness in

Assessment Tool (EAT-10) and Voice Handicap Index (VHI-10) have been 
developed. Both EAT-[ADDRESS_398645]-operative ACDF patients. Previous testing 
has demonstrated the ability of our sensors to monitor vital signs (including 
heart rate and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]), swallow count, talking time, energy 
expenditure, cervical neck movement, and body orientation. Sensor-measured 
swallow count and talking time, in conjunction with EAT-[ADDRESS_398646]-operative care for ACDF patients.

We anticipate  30 individuals will participate at Northwestern Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_322785] 6 months to recruit. 
5.0 Research  Locations:
The enrollment  and data collection for this study will take place in the 
MSK orthopaedic clinic at [ADDRESS_398647]-

7.0 Reliance Agreements/Single IRB:
N/A
8.0 Procedures  Involved:
Once eligible  participants have endorsed the informed consent and HIPAA 
authorization, they will undergo their planned ACDF procedure at NMH. During 
closeout of the procedure the attending surgeon will then place the skin sensor 
into position on the suprasternal notch. Collection of the physiological data 
elements expanded below will begin as the participant is transferred to the post-
anesthesia care unit:
Heart rate
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]
Cervical  axis range of motion
Talking  time
Swallowing  frequency
Caloric  consumption
Body  positioning
The participant  will continue to wear the skin sensor during the intervening [ADDRESS_398648]-of-care visit with the 
attending surgeon. Upon returning to clinic the surgeon will perform their 
assessment of the participant’s progress in recovery and the skin sensor will be 
removed for download of the data elements collected between discharge and 
the participant’s return to clinic.
An optional  component for video recording of the sensor device functioning 
once applied will be offered to participants in order to assist with data analysis 
and development of figures and/or diagrams mappi[INVESTIGATOR_322786]. This component will not

10.0 Recruitment Methods:
Potential participants  for this study will be identified by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Alpesh Patel and [CONTACT_322793] using the surgical schedule to monitor for upcoming candidates 
for ACDF surgery. Once the surgery has been confirmed for the schedule, eligible 
participants will be approached prior to surgery to introduce the study and 
gauge interest to participate, where after those patients who agree to 
participate will be asked to sign a copy of the informed consent and HIPAA 
authorization form.
11.0 Consent  Process: 
Eligible participants  identified by [CONTACT_322788]-operative holding area on the day of surgery to be 
introduced to the study and have any questions regarding participation 
answered. Risks, benefits, and alternatives of participation in the study as well as 
the ability to withdraw participation at any time will be discussed with the 
participant. Once they have agreed to participate in the study, they will be 
provided with an electronic copy of the informed consent and HIPAA 
authorization form via the REDCap application to review and endorse. All 
participants will be offered the opportunity to have a PDF copy of the endorsed 
consent emailed to the address on file at any time.

we learn may be helpful to future patients or society in general.
15.0 Risks to  Participants:
The risks of  the study are minimal. The primary risk associated with participation 
is discomfort from the skin sensor placed on the suprasternal notch following 
surgery. Any discomfort or irritation caused by [CONTACT_322789] 2-week post-operative visit at the participant’s 
discretion.
An additional  risk is a potential loss of participant privacy from the data collected
during the conduct  of the study. The study team has taken measures described 
below to minimize this risk and all study data will be de-identified at the earliest 
possible opportunity to further protect the participants.

Research Data:
All data  elements that are PHI identifiers will be stored separately from 
randomly generated participant ID numbers on a secure, encrypted NU 
SharePoint site and/or a REDCap project. Access to participant information will 
be restricted only to the PI, co-I, and members of the IRB approved authorized 
personnel list for the study. Participants will be able to ask any questions 
regarding the research before consent & the research staff will be transparent 
with explaining the study and explaining the timeline for participants. 
The importance  for confidentiality of the participant’s protected health 
information (PHI) is recognized. PHI will be collected and transferred only where 
necessary. Where possible, participants will be identified only by [CONTACT_322790]’s. 
SSL encryption will be used with all internet web pages to ensure confidential

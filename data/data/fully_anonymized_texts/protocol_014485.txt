Objective: Treating chronic  low back pain (CLBP) with spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] -focused interventions is 
common, potentially dangerous, and often ineffective. This preliminary trial tests the 
feasibility and efficacy of caring for CLBP in older adults as a geriatric syndrome in 
Aging Back Clinics (ABC) . 
Design: Randomized controlled trial  
Setting: Outpatient clinics of two VA Medical Centers   
Subjects:  Fifty-five English -speaking Veterans age 60 -89 with CLBP and no red flags  
for serious underlying illness , prior back surgery, dementia, impaired communic ation, or 
uncontrolled psychiatric illness . 
Methods: Participants were randomized to ABC care or usual care (UC) and followed 
for 6 months. ABC care included : 1) a structured history and physical examination to 
identify pain contributors, 2) structured participant education , 3) collaborative decision 
making , and 4) care guided by [CONTACT_3004] -specific algorithms .  Primary outcomes were 
low back pain severity  (0 to 10 current, and 7 -day average/worst pain) and pain-related 
disability  (Roland Morris ). Seconda ry outcomes included the SF -12 and health care 
utilization.  
Results:  ABC participants experienced significantly greater reduction in 7 -day average 
(-1.22 points; p=0.023) and worst pain ( -1.70 points; p=0.003) , and SF-12 interference 
with social activities  (50.0 vs 11 .5%; p=0.0030 ) at 6 months.   ABC participants were 
less likely to take muscle relaxants (16.7 vs. 42.3%, p=0.0481) . Descriptively, UC 
participants were more likely to experience pain -related emergency room visits (45.8 vs 
30.8%) and be exposed to non -COX2 nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (73.1% vs. 
54.2) .

 Conclusion: These preliminary data suggest that ABC care  for older Veterans with 
CLBP  is feasible and  may reduce  pain and exposure to other potential morbidity.

ClinicalTrials.gov ID: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]; unique protocol ID: F2021 -P  
[ADDRESS_326720] common cause of pain in older adults (1).  Providers are 
advised to approach low back pain as a non -specific condition, one that is associated 
with sciatica, or one caused by a specific disord er such as vertebral compression 
fractures, infection, or malignancy (2).  More than 85% of patients that present  to their 
primary care provider with low back pain are said to have non -specific causes (2).  
When low back pain becomes chronic (i.e., pain at least half the days for at least 6 
months (3)) in older adults, a number of deleterious consequences may result including 
falls and fractures (4); impaired physical function (1, 5, 6) ; depression/anxiety and 
suicide (7-9); social isolation (10); impaired sleep, appetite, and cognitive functioning 
(11-14); and caregiver stress (15). 
 
Rundell and colleagues recently demonstrated that greater than 75%  of older adults 
with low back pain  in the primary care setting  suffer from the chronic variety  (16).  
Nearly two-thirds of these patients continue to e xperience significant pain -related 
functional impairment a year after initial onset  (16).  Further, non-invasive treatments for 
chronic low back pain (CLBP) recommended by [CONTACT_268368][INVESTIGATOR_268342] d with only modest efficacy (17). These data suggest that 
alternative approaches to treatment are needed.  
 
We posit that  CLBP  in older adults is a geriatric syndrome , that is, a final common 
pathway for the expression of multiple contributors (18). In this model,  degenerative 
disease of the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_268343]  
(19). This notion is supported by [CONTACT_268369]. First,  degenerative pathology is 
[ADDRESS_326721] CLBP (20).  Second,  extra -spi[INVESTIGATOR_268344]  (OA) , 
fibromyalgia and depression  often co-exist in older adults with CLBP  (21-24) and may 
be associated with  pain-associated disability  (25-27).  Third,  exclusively spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] -focused 
treatments often  are ineffective  (28). 
 
We recently  validated the prevalence  and functional correlates  of a number of these 
disorders in community -dwelling older Veterans with CLBP  (26). We also have 
published a series of clinical algorithms that resulted from modified Delphi  interactions 
between a  panel of interdisciplinary pain experts and PCPs  (29-40).  The purpose of 
these algorithms is to guide the evaluation and treatment of common  contributors to 
pain and disability in older adults with CLBP.    
 
The algorithms guide evaluation and treatment of the following conditions: 1) hip OA 
(29), 2) myofascial pain (30), 3) fibromyalgia (31), 4) depression (32), 5) maladaptive 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (33), 6) lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_16078] (34), 7) insomnia (35), 8) lateral hip and thigh 
pain (36), 9) anxiety (37), 10) sacroilia c joint syndrome (38), 11) dementia (39), and 12) 
leg length inequality (40).  All algorithms have the following common elements: 1) 
supportiv e literature evidence and when lacking, expert panel consensus; 2) imaging 
only to confirm pathology suspected based on history and physical examination (e.g., 
patient must have American College of Rheumatology clinical criteria for hip OA before 
ordering hip x -rays); 3) emphasis on self -management; 4) patient -provider collaborative 
decision making; 5) stepped -care management that acknowledges specific 
vulnerabilities in older adults (e.g., avoiding medications in Beers’ criteria for potentially 
7 
 inappropria te medications in older adults (41), prescribing a walker instead of pain 
medications or an invasive procedure for the frail older adult with neurogenic 
claudication).  Although  these algorithms were c arefully developed from evidence and 
expert consensus, their effects, when used collectively in practice, have not been 
tested.   
 
We now conduct a randomized controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_268345].  
We hypothesize that older adults with CLBP that undergo comprehensive structured 
evaluation  and algorithms -guided treatment  in Aging Back Clinics (ABCs)  will 
experience significantly greater reduct ion of pain and improvement in function  after 6 
months  as compared with those randomized to usual care (UC) . 
 
METHODS  
Participant s and Setting  
The study protocol was approved by [CONTACT_2179] (IRBs) and the 
Research and Development (R&D) Offices of the two participating sites - Veterans 
Administration (VA) Pi[INVESTIGATOR_108710] (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], PA) and the Hunter 
Holmes McGui re VA Medical Center (Richmond, VA). Participants were initially 
identified through the VA’s data warehouse. Using an IRB -approved waiver of consent, 
research coordinators (RCs) at each site screened the electronic medical records of 
Veterans age 60 and ol der who carried a diagnosis of low back pain and were actively 
receiving care from a VA PCP. Records were screened for potential study eligibility. 
Those eligible were mailed a study brochure via US mail and a letter signed by [CONTACT_185063] 
8 
 of Primary Care. Th ose interested in participating telephoned the RC who performed 
additional eligibility screening. Those found to be eligible after the telephone screening 
procedure were then invited to come on site at the VA for additional study participation.   
 
Inclusio n/exclusion criteria were: 1) CLBP, defined as pain in the lower back of at least 
moderate severity (assessed with a verbal rating scale (42)), every day or almost every 
day, for at least 3 months; 2) lumbar MRI within  the past 30 days that is without 
evidence of infection, malignancy, or acute fracture; 3) no red flags indicative of serious 
underlying illness requiring urgent care (e.g., fever, change in bowel/bladder function, 
sudden severe change in pain, unintentional w eight loss, new lower extremity 
weakness); 4) no prior lumbar surgery; 5) pain in other body locations must be less 
severe than CLBP; 6) cognitively intact  (based on Mini-Mental State Examination 
[MMSE] scor e, as described below) ; 7) no psychotic symptoms;  8) no acute illness; 9) 
no prohibitive communication impairment (e.g., severe hearing or visual impairment);  
and 10) able to commit to 6 months of study participation.   We required a recent MRI 
because the literature indicates that advanced spi[INVESTIGATOR_268346] g is the start of a slippery 
slope of  potentially unnecessary and ineffective  healthcare utilization  (43). By [CONTACT_268370] a recent MRI, and limiting particip ants to those with negative findings, we targeted 
patients whom were at risk for unnecessary care and could, therefore, benefit from the 
algorithm -based care being tested in this intervention.  
 
After providing  written informed consent, participants underwent the M MSE  and those 
scoring < 24 were excluded.

Baseline  Data  
All participants were administered the following measures by [CONTACT_23164]  
(RC) at each site : 
1. Outcome measures  – Primary outcomes were low back pain severity  (0 to 10 
current, and 7 -day average/worst pain) and pain-related disability  (Roland Morris  
(42). Secondary outcomes were measured with  the SF-12® Health Survey  (44) 
and health care utilization . 
2. Key participant characteristics : 
a. The Minimum Dataset (MD)  recommended by [CONTACT_268371] w as administered  (3).  In addition to 
measuring pain severity and interference with daily activities, the MD 
assesses widespread pain, prior CLBP treatments, overall physical function, 
depressive symptoms, sleep, psychological maladaptation (i.e., fear -
avoidance beliefs and catastrophizing), alc ohol/drug use, cigarette smoking, 
demographics (age, race, ethnicity, gender, education, marital status), 
height and weight.   
b. Medical comorbidity  was measured with the Duke comorbidity index (45). 
c. Pain medications  (regularly scheduled and as -needed) w ere categorized 
into sub -classes:  a) salicylates (aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] > 1200 mg/day, salsalate), b) non -
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], non -COX2 selective non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs), c) COX2 selective NSAIDs, d) acetaminophen, e) op ioids, f) 
skeletal muscle relaxants, and g) adjunctive agents (e.g., corticosteroids, 
10 
 capsaicin).  Regularly scheduled opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467] w ere converted to daily 
oral morphine equivalents (46).  
d. Treatment expectancy/credibility  (47) was assessed using  validated 
methods of Borkovec (48). 
e. Social support  was measured with the MOS Social Support Scale (49). 
f. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) was assesse d (for participants not already 
excluded based on the MMSE) using the Quick MCI Questionnaire (50). 
 
Randomization and Blinding  
Following baseline data collection, participants were randomized to Aging Back Clinic  
Care (ABC)  or UC.  Within each site, we used a blocked randomization scheme to force 
continued approximate balance between the numbers of subjects in each arm during 
recruitment. The block size was randomly chosen to be 2 or 4 to prevent personnel from 
predicting tr eatment arm. The study statistician created separate randomization 
schedules for the two sites that contained a randomization sequence number (different 
from a participant's study identification number) and assigned arm. Then he created a 
series of sealed envelopes for each of the sites containing the treatment assignment but 
conspi[INVESTIGATOR_268347]. At 
the time of randomization, research personnel opened the next available envelope, and 
record the ra ndomization sequence number, subject identification number and group 
assignment in a dedicated database, different from the main study database. Personnel 
assessing follow -up outcomes were blinded to intervention assignment (see Follow -Up 
Data  below), and the technical details of the randomization scheme described here 
were not revealed to the research staff.  
[ADDRESS_326722] clinical care . They were not allowed to be seen 
by [CONTACT_268372].   Participants randomized to ABC care  
were administered the following questionnaires in addition to the baseline assessment 
described above , as they constitute additional evaluations required for ABC care : 
1. PHQ -4, that combines the PHQ -2 screen ing for depression and the GAD -2 
screen ing for anxiety (51). 
2. Insomnia Severity Index , that screens for insomnia.  A score of 11 was used as 
the criterion as a positive screen (52). 
3. Fibromyalgia Survey , that screens for fibromyalgia (53). 
 
A geriatrician  trained  by [CONTACT_978]  [INVESTIGATOR_268348] (26) reviewed the results of the above screening 
questionnaires  and tailored their history -taking accordingly . For example, if the 
participant screen ed positive for anxiety, the provider asked additional questions to 
determine the next step(s) as outlined in the anxiety algorithm.  If (s)he screened 
positive for insomnia, the provider as ked a variety of questions to hone in on the cause 
of the insomnia ( e.g., restless legs, urinary frequency, sleep apnea) and determine the 
appropriate path to follow within the insomnia algorithm. Symptoms of neurogenic 
claudication also were queried to identify possible lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_16078].  A structured 
physical exami nation also was performed to evaluate for  key conditions that included 
12 
 hip OA, sacroiliac joint syndrome, myofascial pain, leg length discrepancy, and lateral 
hip/thigh pain syndrome .   
 
After completing the assessment, the provider educated the participant about their 
CLBP contributors, gave them a booklet summarizing their findings, and discussed a  
multifaceted  approach to treatment that was guided by [CONTACT_268373] (29-
40).  ABC providers collaborated with patient participants in devising a treatment plan  
and patients were permitted to refuse treatments that were recommended without be ing 
withdrawn from the study.  Additional appointments with the ABC research clinic 
provider were scheduled as needed.    
 
Follow -up Data : Quantitative   
Monthly telephone calls were made for [ADDRESS_326723] 
data on the main  outcome measures of pain severity and pain disability , as well as SF -
12®.  Pain medication use and pain provider/other health care utilization  (e.g., 
emergency room visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602])  also were collected  at each time point  using 
established methods (54).  To ensure the research coordinator (RC) collecting these 
measures was masked to randomization group, the RC at the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_268349] a nd vice versa.  
 
Follow -up Data: Qualitative   
Qualitative data were collected to gain a deeper understanding of patient and provider 
perspectives on ABC care , including feasibility and acceptability.   ABC patient 
participant perspectives were collected through telephone calls made at the time of 6 -
13 
 month s follow -up.  Calls were made by [CONTACT_268374] (trained by [CONTACT_268375], K LR) and 23 study subjects were queried through audio 
recorded semi -structured one -on-one tele phone interviews.  One participant could not 
be reached.  The patient interview guide was developed by [CONTACT_9154] [INVESTIGATOR_268350], including experts in geriatrics and management of CLBP.   
Interviews included open -ended questions  and probes  designed to elicit patient 
feedback on the ABC process, with an emphasis on identifying elements that were 
particularly useful or burdensome.  For the providers’ perspectives, calls were made 
within 2 months after all participant 6 -month calls had been completed.  KR conducted 
1-on-1 interviews with t he 3 ABC providers.  All interviews were telephone -based, audio 
recorded, and semi -structured. The provider interview guide was also developed by [CONTACT_1600] [INVESTIGATOR_268351].  Interviews included open -ended questions and 
probes designed to elucidate ways to improve the delivery of ABC care  to maximize 
benefits to patients and minimize burden to both patients and providers.   
 
Statistical Analysis  (Quantitative) : In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251], we descriptively interpreted 
magnitudes of intervention effects in addition to their statistical significance. We also 
employed graphical techniques such as needle to depi[INVESTIGATOR_268352] -level changes in 
addition to average changes, as d one in other pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602] (55, 56) .  All analyses were 
performed as intention -to-treat and using SAS® version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, 
North Carolina).  First, appropriate descriptive statistics were computed for all variables  
for each treatment group for each time point as well as change scores from baseline to 
follow -up. Second, the pre -intervention values of the variables and participant 
characteristics were compared between the treatments using independent samples t-, 
14 
 Wilcoxon rank sum, chi -square or Fisher’s exact tests, as appropriate.  Third, for 
continuous variables such as pain , disability and scored  SF-12® domains , we fitted a 
series of linear mixed models using the SAS® MIXED procedure with baseline to follow -
up change in each outcome as the dependent variable; intervention group ( ABC/UC), 
month of follow -up (1/2/3/4/5/6) and their interaction as fixed effects of interest; with and 
without baseline value of the dependent  variable as a fixed effect covariate; and a 
Toeplitz  correlation structure to account for multiple measurements from the same 
participants and allow for greater correlations between proximal measurements in time.  
Appropriately constructed means contrasts  were  used to compare intervention effect at 
each month. For dichotomized outcomes such as any improvement (yes/no) in 
interference with social activities rating and utilization of services or medications, we 
performed chi square and Fisher’s exact tests b ut base our interpretations mostly on 
descriptive comparisons of proportions due to small sample size. Within each group, we 
correlated (r) baseline treatment expectations with change in outcomes.   
 
Qualitative  Analysis : Interviewers and the coder knew that each participant interviewed 
had been randomized to ABC care  but were otherwise  blinded to pa rticipant data . All 
data were analyzed using rapid identification of themes from audio recordings (RITA)  
that allows for data analysis and coding without  transcribing the interviews (57). 
Because the traditional RITA methodology  does not account for the use of qualitative 
data analysis computer software (i.e., NVivo), we replaced the original “coding form” 
with a supplemental coding document (see below).  
 
Participant interview data were coded using deductive and inductive approac hes. The 
15 
 deductive approach started with reviewing specific foci from the qualitative study aims to 
guide preliminary codebook development, including elements of the ABC process that 
were particularly useful (e.g., in terms of pain management) or burdensom e (from 
patient interviews), and potential ways to improve the delivery of ABC care  to maximize 
benefits to patients and minimize burden on both patients and providers (from provider 
interviews). The deductive approach also included pre -identified codes ba sed on the 
interview guide topi[INVESTIGATOR_268353] 11 contributors to CLBP (i.e., the algorithm conditions 
listed in the Introduction, except dementia, as those with dementia were excluded from 
the study). The interview guide questions included: whether each cont ributor was 
discussed with their doctor; whether they were aware of each contributor to CLBP prior 
to seeing their doctor; what other things (besides the aforementioned 11 contributors to 
CLBP) contribute to their CLBP; what treatments they received; did t hey find that 
treatment helpful, and whether they engaged in pain self -management. An inductive 
approach was also used during the codebook development and coding phases in the 
event of identification of sub -codes for each of the aforementioned codes, as we ll as 
contributors to CLBP not included in the pre -identified deductive codes.  
 
The finalized patient and provider codebooks were entered in NVivo 11 Pro for 
Windows (QSR International, Doncaster, Australia) used for audio coding. To record 
more detailed information about the coded audio segments throughout the coding 
process, a supplementary coding document was created in Microsoft Excel. The 
codebook and coding form were tested and subsequently refined using a small subset 
of inte rview audio files before formal coding began.  An experienced qualitative 
researcher (KLR) ensured consistency during codebook development and coding by 
16 
 assisting in resolution of coder uncertainties. She also reviewed the codebook prior to 
the completion of the coding process as well as a 20% (i.e., 5 patient audio files, 1 
provider audio file) sample of coded audio files to ensure the transparency and 
comprehensibility in code application.  
 
RESULTS  
Quantitative  
The CONSORT diagram for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_268354] 1  
and p articipant characteristics in Table 2. No adverse effects were reported.  
 
In the ABC group, participants were on average approximately 4 years older and more 
often had diabetes mellitus  and lung disease  than those randomized to UC.  The two 
groups otherwise  were  comparable in other demographic characteristics  and medical 
comorbidities.  Similarly, there were no significant between -groups differences  in 
parameters recommended by [CONTACT_268376] (i.e., Minimal Data Set  (3)) that include pain duration/frequency/intensity, leg 
symptoms, pain in other locations, pain interference, physical functioning, prior 
treatments for CLBP, sleep quality, depressive symptoms, copi[INVESTIGATOR_52497] -statements, and 
ethanol use .  Descriptively, there were between -group differences in smoking history, 
with 8 (32.0%) never smokers in the ABC group versus 4 (13.3%) in UC, and 1 (4.0%) 
current smoker in the ABC group versus 7 (23.3%) in UC. There was a stati stically 
significant difference in MMSE scores, although the one -point difference (28 vs. 29) is 
not clinically meaningful.  Fewer veterans in ABC than UC group were on gabapentin 
17 
 (8.0 vs 30.0%; p=0.0423), but there was no between -group s difference in the use of 
other pain medications, baseline physical function or treatment expectancy.  
 
Of the various conditions only evaluated in the ABC group, insomnia was the most 
common central nervous system condition, with 14 (56%) participants screening 
positive.  My ofascial pain  (n=20; 80%) and sacroiliac joint pain  (n=13; 52%) were the 
most common physical conditions  identified . 
 
Participants’ CLBP contributors and further evaluations/treatments recommended are 
listed in Table 2.  
 
Table 3 shows the change in continuous outcomes variables by [CONTACT_268377].  All pain intensity measures (current pain, average pain over prior week, worst 
pain over prior week) improved in the ABC group as compared to UC at [ADDRESS_326724] pain.  A 30% 
pain reduction over 6 months was seen in 21% and 15% of ABC and UC participants, 
respectively, in average pain during prior week; and 29% and 8% in worst pain prior 
week. Roland M orris and SF -12® physical component summary improvement was 
greater in the ABC based on descriptive statistics and magnitudes of estimates, but 
these differences did not reach statistical significance.  Sensitivity analysis additionally 
controlling  for age slightly reduced magnitudes of adjusted differences for pain but not 
materially (<15%).  
 
[ADDRESS_326725] pain is similar but more pronounced.  
Interference with social activities also reduced in more participants in ABC care (50.0 vs 
11.5%; p=0.0030).  
 
Based on descriptive statistics, there was greater improvement in some of the other 
dichotomous outcomes (data not shown in tables or figures) in the ABC group as 
compared with UC.  Specifically, during the 6 -month follow up period, there were more 
pain-related emergency room visits in the UC group as compared with th e ABC group 
(45.8 vs 30.8%; p=0.5136), and fewer ABC participants took non -COX2 non -steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (54.2 vs. 73.1%; p=0.1640), opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (20.8 vs. 38.5%; p=0.1742) 
and skeletal muscle relaxants (16.7 vs. 42.3%; p=0.0481).  While fewer parti cipants 
randomized to  ABC care  were exposed to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], this difference also was apparent at 
baseline . 
 
Regarding treatment expectations at baseline, there were no significant associations 
with pain reduction.   
 
Qualitative  
[ADDRESS_326726] helpful w ere the combination of all the treatments they 
received, as well as physical therapy and independent exercises, acupuncture, back 
injections, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ) unit, and medications.  
Other participants said the least helpful treatment s were physical therapy, independent 
exercises, acupuncture, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_13873].  Most participants said that all aspects of their 
pain and functioning had been adequately addressed since their initial visit with the MD; 
a few not ed that the y had upper leg or iliotibial ( IT) band pain, knee pain, and spi[INVESTIGATOR_268355]. Patient participant suggestions for 
improving VA management of CLBP  included more check -ins or follow ups with more 
consistent/frequ ent treatment, listening to the patient, treatment closer to the patient’s 
home, consulting with private doctors, explaining management versus eliminating pain, 
not pushing for surgery, more communication between departments, staying up -to-date 
on research , stop prescribing pain medications, VA gym or gym access, and continuing 
programs and research for pain.  
Provider  participants  said they liked that ABC care provided holistic and individualized 
patient care and that Veterans appreciated ABC care . Some were concerned that ABC 
care required a large time commitment (e.g., provider training, long clinic visits and 
follow ups) and felt that it could be difficult to institute more broadly across the VA.  
[ADDRESS_326727] structure of ABC care  steps, having additional 
support staff, Veterans being open to ABC care , and resources being available to 
Veterans (e.g., VA pays for chiropractor and acupuncture). Perceived barriers to 
implementing ABC care  for CLBP noted by [CONTACT_268378], time required to train providers, lack of patien t follow through (e.g., patients do 
not continue PT), and patients with maladaptive copi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Provider  participants  stated that 
ABC care could be improved by [CONTACT_268379] (including those who do not deliver PCCET, such as primary care 
providers), training specialists about PCCET for CLBP (e.g., physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437],  
psychologists), integrating patients’ self -report data into their electronic medical record, 
excluding patients who live an hour or more away from the VA, and broadening the list 
of possible contributors to CLBP.  
 
DISCUSSION  
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_268356] a comprehensive patient -centered 
approach for the treatment of CLBP in older Veterans is feasible, well -tolerated, and 
associated with preliminary evidence of greater pain reduction  and lesser exposure to 
potentially harmful medicati ons as compared with UC. The greatest magnitude of 
improvement was in worst pain intensity over the past 7 days.   Participants in ABC had 
significant ly less exposure to  skeletal muscle relaxants (medications on Beers’ list)  and 
reported reduced frequency of interference with social activities.   Participants 
randomized to  ABC on average descriptively experienced  less exposure to nonsteroidal 
21 
 anti-inflammatory drugs (also on Beer’ list),  fewer emergency room visits and more 
improv ement in low back pain associated disability (i.e. Roland Morris score), although 
these difference s were not statistically significant.   
 
We deemed our intervention as feasible according to the feasibility domains outlined by 
[CONTACT_268380] (58). These include: 1) acceptability – Our qualitative data 
support the acceptability of the intervention to providers and participants, and the fact 
that we had only one dropout with complete data collection on all other participants 
further supports acceptability; 2) demand (for the intervention)  – Our ease of recruiting 
patients support the demand for alternate strategies to treat chronic low back pain in 
older veterans; 3) implementation – Our intervention utilizes resources that are routinely 
available in VA settings; 4) practicality – Our qual itative data support that ABC care is 
practical when delivered in specialty clinics but perhaps not in primary care clinics; we 
used this feedback in the design of our ongoing RCT in which the ABC clinics is a 
specialty clinic that is not embedded in prima ry care; 5) adaptation – Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_268357]; 6) integration – No organizational 
change was required to implement our intervention; 7) expansion – If we determine that 
the intervention is efficacious in the context of the RCT, we plan a large comparative 
effectiveness study; 8) limited -efficacy testing – This was accomplished and the results 
are presented in this manuscript.  
 
We tested our hypotheses by [CONTACT_268381] -groups mean change in 
outcomes, an analytical approach that is traditionally used to evaluate intervention 
efficacy.  Additional insight can be gained by [CONTACT_268382].  
22 
 Examining individ ual-level change revealed that 50% more people in ABC as compared 
with UC experienced a reduction in average pain intensity. Moreover, there was more 
than a twofold reduction in the number of people in the ABC group as compared with 
UC who experienced wors e pain during the [ADDRESS_326728] s in patients with musculoskeletal 
pain (59).  Several of the contextual compon ents of ABC care  may have contributed to 
improvement .  First, participants received a thorough hands -on assessment designed to 
identify the physical contributors to the CLBP , and the touch -intensive aspect of the 
evaluation may have in and of itself been therapeutic .  Second, participants  received 
positive communication  from the healthcare provider designed to educate the 
participant  about the multi -faceted nature of CLBP and t he multiple potential 
interventions that can  reduce pain interference and improve quality of life .  Third , the 
ABC provider and participant engaged in respectful and collaborative decision making 
about how to approach treatment.   
 
It is worth highlighting that the  three  ABC providers i n this preliminary study  were 
geriatricians, and none  had received official training in pain medicine.  They only had 
been trained in the structured physical examination procedures and used the published 
treatment algorithms t o guide their discussions with parti cipants.  Qualitative findings 
indicate that providers found the physical exam training to be both a benefit and at the 
same time a barrier to broad dissemination.  Given the limited education that medical 
trainees recei ve on pain management in general (60) and for CLBP in particular (61), it 
would be a daunting task to teach all PCPs the requisite advanced knowledge and skills 
used in ABCs. Restructuring PCP visits to afford the ti me to spend with these complex 
patients would also be a challenge. Clinical settings that focus on older adults and/or 
pain management may be more appropriate targets than primary care for future 
[ADDRESS_326729] intervention protocol, the 
interventions for the participants’ CLBP contributors were guided by [CONTACT_268383], as noted earlier.   As highlighted  by [CONTACT_268384], the very same 
treatments that some patients valued highly were those that others found least helpful, 
reinforcing the importance of patient -centered care.  T he magnitude of pain reduction 
we observed  is comparable to that found  in trials that have tested single intensive 
interventions (62).  If we repli cate and expand our  findings in the context of a full -scale 
trial, we will be well-positioned to propose broad dissemination of ABC as a model of 
care. 
 
That ABC care  did not result in a statistically significant reduction in pain -associated 
disability  as compared with UC  warrants reflection.  Foremost , we did find greater 
magnitudes of improvements based on estimates and descriptive statistics, and 
statistical power to reach significance was low in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_48505] a small sample 
size. But also, a s noted above, participants were not required to engage in a rigorous 
intervention such as weekly physical therapy , yoga , cognitive behavioral therapy,  or 
meditation.  Studies that have tested these types of interventions typi[INVESTIGATOR_268358] n-associated disability than in pain intensity (62).  Further, 
we followed participants for only [ADDRESS_326730] the intensive provider -participant interaction and educational reinforcement 
needed to change behav ior.  Our large clinical trial includes 12 months follow up.   
25 
  
The reduction in exposure to nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs and muscle relaxants  
is noteworthy.  Both of these medication classes are included in Beers’ list of 
inappropriate medications for older adults because of the potential for these 
medications to cause significant morbidity either due to direct adverse effects or drug -
disease interactions (63).  Muscle relaxants are associated with potential anticholinergic 
side effects , sedation, risk of falls and fractures  (63).  Nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory 
drugs have a host of potential adverse consequences including gastrointestinal 
bleeding, renal insufficiency and exacerbation of hypertension and congestive heart 
failure  (63).  Thus , ABC care  may have important benefits above and beyond pain 
reduction.  
 
Pain at the present moment  is a more dynamic and volatile outcome with day -to-day 
variability which happened to be somewhat less at baseline in the ABC group. That may 
have played a role in our ability to find significant differences with respect to current 
pain, although a pattern  appears to be emerging in the later months signaling a greater 
benefit at later months.  
 
While our study had a number of strengths, its limitations should be highlighted. First, 
ABC care was not conducted according to a stringent protocol.   The baseline h istory 
and physical examination were structured , as was the education provided about each 
participant’s pain contributors , but the treatments provided were not.  Thus , we cannot 
be definitive about the most effective components of ABC care.  Now that we have 
established feasibility and preliminary evidence of efficacy  in the context of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] 
26 
 study , we will track  all interventions administered and ABC providers’  perceived 
participant compliance  in the context of our ongoing large randomized controlled  clinical 
trial, enabling us to ascertain the most effective ABC components.  Another study 
limitation is that a ll participants  in our study  were Veterans and they received care in the 
Veterans healthcare system.  Thus , our findings may not be broadly applicable.  If our 
large r ongoing  clinical trial corroborates and extends the findings, a similar model of 
care should be examined in other settings .  
 
CONCLUSIONS  
This preliminary trial  demonstrates that treating older adults with CLBP using a 
comprehensive geriatric syndrome approach is feasible, received positively by [CONTACT_268385], and may be efficacious .  If supported by a larger randomized controlled 
trial, the proposed approach could improve quality of life and reduce morbidity and 
misdirected health care utilization for millions of older adults .

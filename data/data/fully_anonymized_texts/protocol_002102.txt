                                         Amendment #[ADDRESS_1149513] (KV-CBCT). Although KV-CBCT is highly 
effective in improving accuracy of the patient setup prior to treatment, CBCT has two major 
deficiencies when applied to verify hypofractionated radiotherapy or radiosurgery.   
First, KV-CBCT only provides a “snapshot” of patient anatomy at the time of imaging, but not 
during actual radiation delivery. Secondly, flat panel based KV-CBCT employed in radiation 
therapy is less than effective in discriminating a soft tissue target in a low contrast environment.  
Localization of abdominal lesions for hypofractionated treatment is challenging with KV-CBCT. 
Alternative imaging methods are needed. Ultrasound imaging is one of the important technologies 
that are capable of soft tissue localization in the abdomen. We have a commercially available 
ultrasound system in our department. This system has been predominantly used for prostate 
patients, localizing the prostate prior to treatment. Ultrasound imaging alone, however, suffers 
insufficient of field of view to visualize a proper patient position for radiotherapy.   
 
2.[ADDRESS_1149514] or ultrasound imaging alone for 
imaging guided radiotherapy delivery. Specifically, we will investigate (a) whether the ultrasound 
imaging can enhance soft tissue tumor localization; (b) wheth er the presence of a passive arm is 
interfering radiation delivery during each treatment; (c) whether the presence of the ultrasound 
probe will affect the choice of radiation beams and degrade treatment plan quality.

All patients e

5.0   Research Plan  
 
5.1  Investigate whether the ultrasound imaging can enhance soft tissue tumor 
localization.  
(a)  Following the standard clinical procedure, daily KV-CBCT image for each patient will be 
acquired and used to guide for patient setup prior to treatment delivery. Because of limited soft 
tissue contrast in KV- CBCT to observe the soft tissue organ , such as the prostate , the added 
ultrasound image may enhan ce soft tissue localization prior to treatment for these patients.  
The ultrasound device will be calibrated to the treatment iso -center via an external camera system 
and infrared markers on the ultrasound (US) probe. A commercially available passive arm w ill be 
acquired and attached to the ultrasound probe. Following our current clinical protocol, the patient 
treatment position will be determined solely based the daily KV -CBCT. After KV -CBCT 
guidance, a pre -treatment US image will be acquired for the study  but not used for patient 
positioning.  The success of this specific aim is defined as that the tumors can be visualized in the 
ultrasound images in at least 80% of patients enrolled.  
(b) Investigate whether the presence of a passive arm will interfere wi th radiation delivery 
during each treatment.

                                         Amendment #[ADDRESS_1149518]: (a) whether the pass ive arm reduces the clearance 
between the patient and the gantry of the linear accelerator; (b) whether the passive arm can hold 
a consistent contact [CONTACT_828499]; (c) whether the 
passive arm can be automatically released if a patient makes a large movement. The success of 
this specific aim is defined as that at least 80% of patients are able have the ultrasound probe 
attached during the entire treatment course.  
 
Figure 1.  
(c) Investigate whether the presence of  the ultrasound probe will interfere with the choice of 
radiation beams and degrade plan quality  
The presence of the US probe and the passive arm may block the access of some radiation beams. 
The specific aim of this study to investigate whether altering t he radiation beam directions will 
affect the treatment plan quality.  Our preliminary planning data [1] showed that it is necessary to 
choose different radiation beam angles, but the impact on treatment plan quality is not clinically 
significant for most patients. Patients for whom treatment plan quality is in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_828498]-altered plan, and thus be included in step 5.1(a), but excluded 
from 5.1(b&c), as US probe will be removed prior to treatment in these cases to allow for treatment 
with the best possible plan.  We expect this to be rare.   The success of this specific aim is defined 
as that the quality of the plans for 80% of patients will not be affected in the presence of the

a 2% increase in the dose to the most critical normal tissue for that tumor location (Prostate: dose

Specifically, the tumor location detected from combined US/KV-CBCT images will be compared 
with using KV-CBCT alone. Using the KV-CBCT the gold standard,  3D radiation dose 
distributions will be re-calculated according to the tumor localizations using KV-CBCT alone and 
using combined US/KV-CBCT.  For SBRT prostate cancer, we will compare the following 
dosimetric endpoints, extracted from dose volume histograms.

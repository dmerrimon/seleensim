DONOR STOOL 
PREPARA TION  
Healthy/screene d dono rs will dona te multiple stools of >150g each used for both intestinal 
bacteria forms – frozen to be given by [CONTACT_166604]) at the 
University of [LOCATION_007] School of Publi c Health. Stool will be mixed with sterilized 0.9% NaCl 
(1:5 dilution for frozen bacteria and 1:2 dilution for lyophilization), then mix above solution in 
a homogenizer mixer with sterilized bag (Stomacher). All the products will be labeled and 
kept at -80C for up to [ADDRESS_193257] for C. difficile toxins and an aliquot (2 mL) will be stored at -80o  C for 
future studies. One day before FMT, subjects will be prepared for FMT by [CONTACT_43638] a clear 
liquid diet the entire day followed at ~ 6:00 pm by [CONTACT_166605]. All subjects will take 4 mg (2 capsules of loperamide 
(Imodium) in the morning of FMT, or if missed this dose will be taken after FMT. After the 
FMT is comp lete the subject may resume a normal diet unless they are on a special diet 
for other medical condition. The method  of FMT treatment is randomized and the subject 
will receive either a retention enema or oral capsules. Subject follow up is planned on or

 about days 1, 7, 14, 30, 6 0, 90 and 6 months after FMT to monitor any adverse experience 
and/or to obtain the name [CONTACT_166623]. If possible, a fresh s tool 
samp le will be collected  from the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_166570] 2, 7, 14, 30, [ADDRESS_193258] 90 days after FMT.  The stool 
will be tested  for C. difficile toxins and an aliquot (2 mL) stored at -80C for future studies. 
 
 
Treatment Failure and Retreatment: 
 
Treatment failure is defined as e xperiencing RCDA D within 60 days after FMT. CDAD is 
defined as passage of ≥ [ADDRESS_193259] for C. difficile toxin.  Two add itional treatments (total of 
three treatments) may be provided for treatment failures providing the criteria above are 
met: 
 
If treatment failure recurs within 60 days after the FMT treatment, it will be recommended 
to the study subjects‟ physician that the subject be treated with 14-[ADDRESS_193260] will be referred back to their physician to 
resume their patient care with a recommendation that FMT not be further pursued in  their 
management.

IRB APPROVAL  DATE:  07/13/[ADDRESS_193262] se veral years, C. difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD ) has become  more frequent and 
severe, more refractory to standard therapy, with predictable recurrence rates of 25% after standard therapy 
[1, 2]. It is now accepted that the disruption of the normal balance of colonic microbiota secondary to antibiotic 
use facilitates the development of CDA D and improvemen ts in the diversity  and quantity of flora is associated 
with recovery of infection and prevention of disease recurrence. Studies have sho wn that subjects with 
recurrent CDA D (RCAD ) have dec reased diversity  of colonic flora with absolute reductions in counts of 
anaerobic species of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes in their stool compared to subjects recovering from single 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_89250] D [3]. Numerous case  reports and retrospective case  series ha ve demonstrated the ben efit of 
intestinal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in subjects with severe or RCDAD with cure rates over 90% [4-8], 
making FMT standard therapy  when multiple recurrences are seen [9]. FMT involves ad ministration of a 
suspension of intestinal bacteria obtained from a healthy individual into the GI tract of a patient with RCDA D to 
promote normalization of flora [5]. 
 
 
1.2 Summ ary of Fec al Microb iota Transplantation from Publications and Our P revious Study 
 
(HSC-SPH-13-0119) 
 
This study comp liments our currently approved FMT protocol (UT IRB# HSC-SPH-13-0119). Many of 
the published studies have used bacteria isolated from fresh fecal samp les with collection and processing on 
the day of planned FMT. Our currently approved study and anoth er published study [10] have successfully 
used a bacterial solution obtained from filtered human  feces from healthy donors that were frozen for storage 
at −80 °C until required for use. Furthermore, detailed microbiological studies with 16S rRNA gene sequencing 
demonstrated s table “engraftment” or “implantation” of donor microbiota with frozen bacterial product  [11], with 
dramatic shifts in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_166572]. 
The route of the FMT administration can be introgastric, naso-duodenal, transcolonoscopic, or enema 
based on previous studies. Retention (1-3 hours) enema administration of intestinal bacteria is effective, 
cheap, and safe and carries less proced ural or institu tional admission costs. The enema approach has been 
successfully car ried out with more than 100 subjects with RCDA D [12, 13]. In addition, a recent report from 
Louie (Presentation IDSA, San Francisco, CA 2013) indicated that an oral capsule of concentrated intestinal 
bacteria successfully treated 30 of 31 subjects with RCDAD . After follow-up for 90 days, ~90% of subjects 
were cured  from RCDAD . One patient had recurrence of diarrhea after treatment of urinary tract infection. 
In our currently approved study (HSC -SPH-13-0119), we are studying subjects with recurrent CDAD 
 
with fresh, frozen or lyophilized bacterial suspension in a randomized allocation 1:1:1 via colonoscopy. So far 
07/07/2017 Page 10 of 26

43 subjects with more than 3 RCDA D underwent FMT. Overall, with the 3 different forms of FMT (fresh, frozen, 
or lyophilized), all have shown equivalent efficacy a nd normalization of intestinal flora. One subject developed 
sepsis from a urinary tract infection complicated  by [CONTACT_166608].  A second subject developed C. difficile negative colitis a week after FMT. 
This is not a known complication of FMT or R CDAD . 
Whether intestinal bacteria suspension from a healthy donor is fresh, frozen or lypholized does not 
appear to be an important variable in terms of providing healthy bacteria to repopulate the lower intestine of a 
patient with depleted flora (Jiang Z-D, DuPont HL et al. unpublished data to be presented  orally at the national 
meeting of the American College of Gastroenterology, October 2014). Also, the route of administration of the 
bacteria does not appear to be important with oral (Louie et al. cited above), nasoduodenal [14], colonic [15] 
and rectal administration [12] all being effective in successfully treating RCDA D in previous studies. Frozen 
donor intestinal bacteria can be stockpi[INVESTIGATOR_40177] a freezer from selected  and screened donors for treatment of 
subjects with RCDA D as they are identified without requiring that a single donor be screened and process ed 
the day of use for each treated patient. If effective in treating RCDAD , lyophilized intestinal bacteria can be 
easily and inexpensively be used for outpatient treatment by [CONTACT_166609] D. Using FMT by [CONTACT_166610]. 
 
 
2.  OBJECTIVE 
 
We will generate frozen or lyophilized FMT intestinal bacteria inocula from well-screened healthy 
volunteer donors providing ≥150 grams of stool/FMT. Donor intestinal bacteria suspensions will be diluted 
≥750 mL to freeze before rectal  enema procedure and diluted ≥300 mL for later lyophilization and 
encapsulation.  This  study  will  evaluate  the  safety  of  a  frozen  or  lyophilized  inoculum  administered, 
respectively, by [CONTACT_166611]. 
 
 
Fecal samp les from donors and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_166573]. 
 
 
 
3.  STU DY DESIGN 
 
This is a single center, randomized, parallel ass ignment, open label safety study conducted in subjects 
with RCDA D. Approximately 100  subjects will be e nrolled in the study and randomized at  1:1 ratio to receive 
frozen filtered intestinal bacteria via retention enema or lyophilized donor intestinal bacteria. All subjects will 
be followed for approximately 6 months following FMT.

3.1 Study Structure 
 
Donors will be enrolled and screened at the laboratory in the Center for Infectious Diseases at 
University  of [LOCATION_007] Sch ool of Public Health (CID-UT-SPH) which is a College of American Pathologists (CAP) 
and Clinical L aboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) c ertified laboratory. 
 
 
Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_166574]-refer but must have a physician who agrees to accept care  of the patient 
following FMT.  Subjects consenting to treatment at Baylor St. Luke‟s Medical Center and the University  of 
[LOCATION_007] Sch ool of Public Health must be willing to self-pay for the FMT with a money order  or cashier‟s check, or 
debit/credit card in the amount of $1,500. There will be no insurance accepted.  Subjects undergoing retention 
enema will be treated as outpatients at either Baylor St. Luke‟s Medical Center in the [LOCATION_007] Medical Center, 
Kelsey-Seybold Clinic - Main Campus on Holcombe  Blvd., or at the Digestive Disease Center at  Memorial 
Hermann in the [LOCATION_007] Medical Center. All subjects taking capsu les with lyophilized intestinal bacteria 
suspension will be seen at Kelsey-Seybold Clinic – Main Campus on Holcombe  Blvd. to receive the oral F MT. 
Once the proced ure is completed, the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]‟s care will be returned to their physician. 
Evaluation of  the safety of FMT and recurrence of clinical symptoms of C. difficile will be p erformed by 
[CONTACT_166612]. The primary endpoint is to evaluate the safety of FMT by [CONTACT_166613], prevention of CDA D recurrence and improvement of diversity  of colonic flora 
following receipt of FMT with either frozen filtered intestinal bacteria or lyophilized donor intestinal bacteria. 
 
 
3.2 Study Population 
 
We demonstrated in a recent study that a majority of Houston gastroenterologists and infectious 
diseases spec ialists supported the creation of an intestinal microbiota transplantation center in Houston [16]. A 
letter about the study will be se nt to the physicians in the Houston area to recruit CDA D subjects. We will 
screen up to 125 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_166575] 100-treated subjects. 
Screened volunteer donors from the [LOCATION_007] Medical Center area  will donate stools for use for up  to 100 
subjects. The donors will be compensated $10 cash for each stool donation of sufficient volume/weight. 
Donors may provide stool for more than one patient. The donors will be sc reened for health history and 
conditions, medication use, sexual behavior, travel, and other risk factors for infectious diseases during a 
private and confidential interview. All fecal material from donors will be screened for enteric pathogens. Donors 
will be n otified in the event an infection is identified that disqualifies them from donating.

Before  the  FMT  proce dure,  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_166578]/or  FMT  staff.  A 
screening log will be designed to document the rationale for screening the patient (inclusion criteria) or not 
enrolling the patient (exclusion criteria, patient declines to participate or the consent form is not signed). 
Following docume ntations will be o btained or provided- 
 Informed consent 
 
 Patient demographics and medical h istory 
 
 Descri ption of FMT procedures for potential recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] 
 
 Randomization – either retention enema or capsules 
 
CDA D is defined as diarrhea (passage of ≥ [ADDRESS_193267] two conse cutive 
 
24-hour periods) together with a positive test for fecal C. difficile toxin. RCDA D is defined as the reappearance 
of diarrhea after therapy with a positive fecal toxin assay. Non-CDA D antimicrobial agents will be discontinued

4.2.1   Pre-scree ning 
 
We will pre-screen up to 20 potential donors to recruit up to 15 qualified donors. Identified donors will 
be found from various students and employees in the [LOCATION_007] Medical Center. Before stool is used for 
transplantation, the donor will be sc reened for infectious diseases using the following tests. 
 
 
Stool will be co llected  in a semi-sterilized co ntainer. Stool needs to be delivered to the Center for 
Infectious Diseases laboratory at University  of [LOCATION_007] Sch ool of Public Health within 8 hours of collection. Every 
fecal donation will be tested for enteric pathogens, including Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shiga-toxin 
Producing Escherichia coli, and Clostridium difficile Toxin A/B and Norovirus. 
 
 
Blood samp les from the donor will be co llected  with a sterilized needle (25mL blood will be co llected) 
 
and tested for co nditions screened for blood transfusions the items listed below: 
 
1.  Hepatitis B  core Antibody 
 
2.  Hepatitis B  Surface Antigen 
 
3.  Hepatitis C virus Antibody 
 
4.  HIV-1 and  HIV-2 Antibody 
 
5.  Anti-HTLV I/II 
 
6.  Serologic Test for Syphilis 
 
 
 
4.2.2 One day before donation 
 
 Study staff will contact [CONTACT_166614] ≥ 150 grams of stool on the day of FMT 
 
 Donor is encouraged to take one stool softener laxative the evening before the proced ure and  drink of 
plenty water. 
 Study staff will provide the su pplies and i nstruction for sample collection. 
 
 
 
 
4.2.3   Day of donation – preparation, storage and shelf life 
 
Dono r Stool: 
 
   ≥150g of stool per transplant (all stools <150 grams will be discarded).  The fresh stool must be brought to 
the laboratory within 2 hours for processing. 
   Additional stool can  be donated each weekday for 3 months being compensated $10 for each do nation.

Preparing Stool for FMT: 
 
 
   Mix the stool sample with sterilized 0.9% NaCl without antibacterial preservative (750mL, 1:5 dilution). 
 
   Mix above solution in a homogenizer mixer with sterilized bag (Stomacher). Initially, use the low setting 
until the sample breaks up, and then advance the speed gradual ly to the highest setting.  Continue for 2 – 
4 minutes until sample is smooth and homogeneou s. 
 
   For frozen intestinal bacteria - the suspension will be filtered using a sterile pape r coffee filter (or gauze) 
that has been moistened with saline and funne l (both are sterilized). Allow adequate time for slow filtration 
to end. NOTE: To expedite process, multiple funnel /filters can be used to combine product. 
 Repea t above step. NOTE: it may take 2 hours to complete filtration. 
 
 Place filtered suspension of bacteria (750 mL) into a 1.5 L enema bag provided by [CONTACT_166615] l at the clinical facility (St. Luke‟s/Kelsey-Seybold/Memorial Hermann) 
 Number the samples as FMT-D-02-XXX-Frozen Intestinal Bacteria 
 
 Labe l the tubes with lot number (mm-dd-yyyy) and date and time processed 
 
   For lyophilized intestinal bacteria - the suspension will be filtered using a sterile pape r coffee filter (or 
gauze) that has been moistened with saline and funne l (both are sterilized). Allow adequate time for slow 
filtration to end. NOTE: To expedite process, multiple funnel /filters can be used to combine product. 
 Repea t above step. NOTE: it may take 2 hours to complete filtration. 
 
 Place filtered suspension in 15 sterilized 50 mL tubes 
 
 Number the samples as FMT-D-02-XXX-Lyophilized Intestinal Bacteria 
 
 Labe l the tubes with lot number (mm-dd-yyyy) and date and time processed 
 
 Freezing at -80C overnight: The product (filtered intestinal bacteria in 50mL tube) is frozen 
 
 After freezing, the product is placed under vacuum. This enables the frozen solvent in the 
product  to vaporize without passing through the liquid phas e, a process known as sublimation. 
 A lyophilized product  must be sealed with parafilm within its container, then will be taken to

The followin g safety endpoin ts will be evaluated in this study. 
 
5.1.1   Medic al conditions 
 
When contact[CONTACT_166616] 1, 7,  14, 30, 60 and 90 after FMT, we will review the

5.1.2   Monitoring for s afety 
 
The following definitions of terms are guided by [CONTACT_166618] (21 CFR 3 12.32). 
An adverse experience is any unfavorable or unintend ed sign, symptom, of disease temporally 
associated with FMT procedure, whether or not considered related to the proced ure, including, but not limited 
to: 
 
 Any symptom  not previously reported by [CONTACT_1955][INVESTIGATOR_840] (Medical h istory) 
 
 An exacerbation of a pre-existing illness, increases in the frequency and/or severity of the signs or 
symptoms of CDA D (defined as positive C. difficile toxin test and enteric symptoms) 
 A significant increase in  frequency or intensity of a pre-existing epi[INVESTIGATOR_3756]

 A condition first detected or diagnosed after study drug administration even though the condition may 
have been prese nt before the proced ure 
Details of all adverse experiences that occ ur after FMT will be co llected  as indicated  above. 
Serious adverse experience is any adverse experience that: 
 
 Results in death 
 
 Is life threatening (at immediate risk of death from the procedure as it occurred) 
 
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (overnight stay) or prolongs a current hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
 
 Causes a  persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 
 Of medical importance  (any event that requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above) 
 
 
 
The investigator will exercise  medical and scientific judgment when deciding whether expeditious 
reporting is appropriate in other  situations not strictly meeting the listed criteria above. The investigators will 
meet/discuss  with experts in the field if there is a question of whether the adverse experience would be 
considered serious. 
 
 
Severity – The adverse experience will be d ocumented acc ording to the following descriptors: 
 
 Mild: associated with no limitation of usual activities or o nly slight discomfort 
 
 Moderate: ass ociated with limitation of usual activities or s ignificant discomfort 
 
 Severe: ass ociated with inability to carry out usual activities or very marked discomfort 
 
 
 
 
Relationship – the relationship of adverse experience to FMT will be assigned by [CONTACT_166619]: 
 Probable: a reaction that follows a reasonable temporal  sequence from the proced ure that follows a 
known or expected response pattern to the su spected procedure and that could not be reasonably 
explained by [CONTACT_166620]‟s clinical state 
 Possible: a reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the proced ure that follows a 
known or expected response pattern to the p rocedure but could readily have been produc ed by a 
number of other factors

 Unlikely: a reaction that does not follow a reasonable temporal  sequence from the procedure but for 
which causa lity from FMT cann ot be ruled out. 
 Not related: a reaction for which sufficient data exist to indicate that the etiology is unrelated to the

adverse experience that occurs after the procedure, even if the relationship of adverse experience to the 
proced ure is assessed  by [CONTACT_63033] “unlikely” or “not related”. The Investigator should attempt, if 
possible, to estab lish a diagnosis based on the presenti ng signs and symptoms. If an adverse experience 
meets the definition of a serious adverse experience then the Investigator must also complete the serious 
adverse experience, and also send any  supporting source do cuments directly to the University  of [LOCATION_007] Health 
Science Center IRB as soon as the event is discovered.  At each visit, after the patient has had an opportunity 
to mention any problems spontane ously, the Investigator (or designee) will inquire about adverse experience 
by [CONTACT_89302], such as: 
 
 
 Have you had any  medical prob lems since your last visit? 
 
 Have any  medical prob lems present at your last visit changed, i.e., stopped, worsene d, or improved? 
 
 Have you taken any new medicines, oth er than study drug,  since your last visit?

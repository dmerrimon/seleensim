Metastatic Solid Tumors That are Benefiting from Continuation of Therapy with Sacituzumab 
Govitecan 
Primary Objective: Evaluate long-term safety in subjects with metastatic solid tumors that 
are benefiting from continuation of therapy with sacituzumab govitecan
Study Design: This is a Phase 4, open-label, longitudinal cohort, rollover study designed to 
evaluate long-term safety in subjects with metastatic solid tumors that are benefiting from 
continuation of therapy with sacituzumab govitecan. Only subjects who continue to receive 
clinical benefit from continuation of sacituzumab govitecan therapy and are tolerating therapy 
at the time of enrollment are eligible for this study. Subjects enrolled may continue to receive 
sacituzumab govitecan at the dose that they were receiving in the [COMPANY_009] (previously 
Immunomedics)-sponsored parent study at the time of consenting to participate in this rollover 
study. No dose escalation beyond the dose the subject was receiving in the parent study at the 
time of consenting to participate in this rollover study is permitted. Subjects who continued to 
receive sacituzumab govitecan in a parent study after disease progression (PD) may continue 
to receive sacituzumab govitecan in this rollover study. No subject will receive more than 
10 mg/kg dose of sacituzumab govitecan in this rollover study. Subjects may continue to 
receive sacituzumab govitecan until they experience toxicity, disease progression with no 
evidence of clinical benefit, loss of clinical benefit, withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up, 
or sponsor termination of the study is documented. Subjects of childbearing potential will be 
followed for Safety Follow-up after study drug discontinuation. Subjects with ongoing adverse 
events (AEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs) will be followed for Safety Follow-up after 
EOT.

[COMPANY_009] Sciences, Inc. (Immunomedics, Inc. is now part of the [COMPANY_009] group of companies) Amendment [ADDRESS_867372] [ZIP_CODE]. INTRODUCTION
1.1. Mechanism of Action of Sacituzumab Govitecan
Sacituzumab govitecan (company code: IMMU-132) is a trophoblast cell-surface antigen-2 
(Trop-2)-directed antibody-drug conjugate that comprises SN-38, a topoisomerase I inhibitor and 
active metabolite of irinotecan, coupled by a linker (CL2A) to the humanized monoclonal 
antibody (mAb) hRS7 immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1)κ, which binds to Trop-2. Trop-2 is a 
transmembrane calcium signal transducer glycoprotein of the Tumor Associated Calcium Signal 
Transducer 2 (TACSTD2) gene family. Pharmacology data suggest that sacituzumab govitecan 
binds to Trop-2-expressing cancer cells and is internalized with the subsequent release of SN-38 
via hydrolysis of the linker. SN-38 interacts with topoisomerase I and prevents re-ligation of 
topoisomerase I-induced single strand breaks. The resulting DNA damage leads to apoptosis and 
cell death. The hydrolysable linker may permit release of SN-38 in the acidic microenvironment 
of the tumor without Trop-2 binding.
1.2. Nonclinical Experience
1.2.1. Pharmacology
Sacituzumab govitecan has been evaluated for in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo efficacy in a 
variety of human solid tumor types, including prostate, non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 
colon, pancreatic, squamous cell lung, gastric, and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) 
{Cardillo 2015, Cardillo 2011, Cardillo 2017, Goldenberg 2015}. In general, IC 50 values ranged 
from 1 to 83 nM across various disease indications {Cardillo 2011, Cardillo 2017, Goldenberg 
2015}. In vivo, significant anti-tumor effects mediated by [CONTACT_647756], NSCLC, colon, pancreatic, gastric, and 
squamous cell lung.
Additional information regarding nonclinical pharmacology of sacituzumab govitecan can be 
found in the current edition of the investigator’s brochure.
1.2.2. Toxicology
In acute toxicity studies in Swiss-Webster Mice, sacituzumab govitecan at doses of up to 
750 mg/kg/dose (ie, cumulative doses of up to 1500 mg/kg) caused minimal loss (<10%) in body 
weight. There was no evidence of hematological toxicity and no abnormal histology findings. 
Transient increases in hepatic transaminases were observed that returned to normal by [CONTACT_647757].
In cynomolgus monkeys, sacituzumab govitecan administered 50 mg/kg/dose (human equivalent 
dose [HED] = 16 mg/kg/dose) for four treatment cycles (Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle) was 
considered a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) and 120 mg/kg/dose administered

[COMPANY_009] Sciences, Inc. (Immunomedics, Inc. is now part of the [COMPANY_009] group of companies) Amendment [ADDRESS_867380] [ZIP_CODE].3.1.2. Distribution
Based on population PK analysis, central volume of distribution of sacituzumab govitecan is 
2.96 L.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Elimination
The mean half-life of sacituzumab govitecan and free SN-38 was 15.3 and 19.7 hours, 
respectively. Based on population PK analysis, the clearance of the sacituzumab govitecan is 
0.14 L/h.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Metabolism
No metabolism studies with sacituzumab govitecan have been conducted. SN-38 (the small 
molecule moiety of sacituzumab govitecan) is metabolized via uridine diphosphate 
glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1). SN-38 glucuronide (SN-38G) was detectable in the 
serum of subjects.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Excretion
SN-[ADDRESS_867381] been reported to be mainly eliminated via biliary excretion.
1.3.2. Immunogenicity
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for an immune response to sacituzumab 
govitecan. None of the subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and subjects 
who were confirmed antidrug antibody (ADA) positive had infusion reactions or adverse events 
(AEs) suggestive of immunogenicity.
1.3.3. Rationale for Dose Regimen
The total body clearance (CL) of sacituzumab govitecan is mediated by [CONTACT_647758], SN-38. The distribution and CL of the 
antibody portion of sacituzumab govitecan are likely to be similar to those other IgG1 antibodies 
and are influenced by [CONTACT_232798] (Trop-2)-mediated uptake on antigen-expressing cells, pi[INVESTIGATOR_103009], 
and neonatal Fc receptor negative-mediated CL mechanisms in vivo. SN-38 is primarily 
eliminated from the body via the hepatic route. 
In the Phase 1 part of Study IMMU-132-01, dose escalation was performed with doses ranging 
from 8 to 18 mg/kg. A sacituzumab govitecan dose of 12 mg/kg was formally identified as the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) but was associated with dose delays and reductions in several 
subjects. A sacituzumab govitecan dose of 10 mg/kg was found to be safe and efficacious and is 
the recommended starting dose for subjects with normal hepatic function and mild hepatic 
impairment. Additional information regarding the safety and efficacy of sacituzumab govitecan 
can be found in the investigator’s brochure.

participate in this rollover study. No dose escalation beyond the dose the subject was receiving in 
the parent study at the time of consenting to participate in this rollover study is permitted. 
Sacituzumab govitecan will be administered as an IV infusion on Days [ADDRESS_867383] to follow-up, loss of clinical benefit, or sponsor 
termination of the study is documented. Treatment beyond PD is permitted if there is evidence of 
clinical benefit per treating physician’s assessment. This rollover study will provide these 
subjects an opportunity for continuation of therapy.
1.3.4. Summary of Sacituzumab Govitecan Safety
The safety profile for sacituzumab govitecan was similar in the treatment of mTNBC and mUC. 
The most common AEs were nausea, diarrhea, neutropenia, fatigue, alopecia, anemia, vomiting, 
and constipation. The most clinically relevant Grade [ADDRESS_867384] cases of neutropenia were not febrile, were nonserious, and could be managed with 
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) administration and/or dose reduction after 
Cycle 1. 
Diarrhea with sacituzumab govitecan occurred within the first treatment cycle (median time of 
[ADDRESS_867385] event) and resolved within approximately [ADDRESS_867386] of the cases of 
diarrhea were nonsevere, nonserious, and did not lead to either a treatment interruption or dose 
reduction. 
Higher incidences of neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and anemia were seen in subjects who 
were homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele compared with subjects who were heterozygous for 
the UGT1A1*28 allele and subjects who were homozygous for the wild-type allele.

underlying UGT1A1 *[ADDRESS_867408] their polymorphism assessed per Investigator’s discretion. Instructions for 
sacituzumab govitecan dose reduction for treatment-related toxicities are provided in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].
[IP_ADDRESS]. Infusion-Related Reactions
Infusion-related reactions are defined as symptoms that occur during and within the first 6 hours 
after the infusion of sacituzumab govitecan and can occur at any cycle. Symptoms can include: 
fever, chills, rigors, arthralgias, myalgias, urticaria, pruritus, rash, diaphoresis, hypotension, 
dizziness, syncope, hypertension, dyspnea, cough, and wheezing, as well as severe 
hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions. Infusion-related reactions should be 
treated in accordance with best clinical practices and standard institutional guidelines. Because 
of the potential for life-threatening IRRs, sacituzumab govitecan should only be administered in 
a setting in which appropriately trained medical staff, emergency equipment, and medications are 
available in the event that resuscitation is required. NCI CTCAE v5.0 is used to grade the 
severity of all infusion-related AEs. Premedication for the prevention of IRRs is described in 
Section 6.3.1.
Grade 4 Events
Grade 4 reactions include potentially life-threatening reactions, requiring urgent intervention. If 
Grade 4 IRRs occur, sacituzumab govitecan should be permanently discontinued (Table 2).
Grade 2 and Grade 3 Events
Grade 2 IRRs are defined as those that require infusion interruption and respond to symptomatic 
treatment; prophylactic medications are indicated for ≤ 24 hours. For Grade 2 IRRs, the infusion 
should be interrupted until symptoms resolve. After symptoms resolve, the infusion should be 
resumed at a slower infusion rate determined appropriate by [CONTACT_364156]. 
Recommended infusion rates are provided in the Pharmacy Manual. Grade 3 IRRs are defined as 
those that are prolonged and do not improve with symptomatic treatment and/or brief 
interruption of treatment, reactions that recur following treatment, and reactions that require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. For recurrent Grade 2 or Grade 3 IRRs despi[INVESTIGATOR_3064], 
sacituzumab govitecan should be permanently discontinued (Table 2).

Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are frequent sacituzumab govitecan-associated toxicities. 
Appropriate treatment, including, as needed, fluid and electrolyte replacement, is required to 
minimize the risk of serious consequences such as dehydration. Instructions for sacituzumab 
govitecan dose reduction for treatment-related gastrointestinal toxicities are provided in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].
Nausea and Vomiting
Instructions for the use of premedications for prophylactic treatment of nausea and vomiting and 
anticipatory nausea are provided in Section 6.3.1. Withhold sacituzumab govitecan for Grade 3 
nausea or Grade 3 or 4 vomiting at the time of scheduled treatment administration and resume 
with additional supportive measures when resolved to Grade ≤ 1. Manage this toxicity per 
standard institutional guidelines. 
Diarrhea
Dietary modification should be recommended for the management of diarrhea, including 
adequate fluid intake to maintain hydration. Loperamide can be administered at the onset of 
treatment-related Grade 1 or Grade 2 diarrhea, at an initial dose of 4 mg, followed by 2 mg with 
every epi[INVESTIGATOR_54589] a maximum dose of 16 mg/day. If diarrhea is not resolved after 
24 hours, consider adding diphenoxylate/atropi[INVESTIGATOR_20793]/or opi[INVESTIGATOR_235233], as clinically indicated.
Add octreotide 100-150 μg subcutaneous (SC) three times per day (tid) if diarrhea persists. 
Withhold sacituzumab govitecan for Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea at the time of scheduled treatment 
administration and resume when resolved to Grade ≤ 1. For Grade 3 or Grade 4 diarrhea, 
consider hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and treat with IV fluids, and octreotide. Antibiotics can be administered 
as clinically indicated. 
Subjects who exhibit an excessive cholinergic response to treatment with sacituzumab govitecan 
(eg, abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], diarrhea, salivation, etc.) can receive appropriate premedication (eg, 
atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) for subsequent treatments.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Neutropenia
Complete blood counts (CBC) must be obtained prior to each sacituzumab govitecan infusion. 
Sacituzumab govitecan should be administered only if absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) meet 
the following criteria:

administration may be considered and should comply with American Society of Clinical 
Oncology (ASCO) guidelines for use of growth factors. They may be used in subjects who have 
experienced febrile neutropenia or Grade 3 or Grade 4 neutropenia following previous infusions. 
Growth factors may also be administered in the setting of neutropenia in subjects at high risk of 
poor clinical outcomes, including those with prolonged neutropenia, ANC <1000/mm3, febrile 
neutropenia, and serious infections.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Overdose
Overdose is defined as administration of a dose that is 10% higher than the calculated dose. In 
the event of an overdose, closely monitor the subject per standard institutional guidelines. Any 
AE resulting from overdose should be reported as described in Section 10.2.2.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Sacituzumab Govitecan Dose Modification Guidelines
Dose Delays
Sacituzumab govitecan is to be administered in 21-day cycles on Day 1 and Day 8; the next 
cycle should start a minimum 14 days after the Day 8 dose (ie, the Day [ADDRESS_867411] day of that 14-day period). Dosing 1 day prior to and 7 days after the 
scheduled infusion are permitted. The scheduled Day 1 and Day 8 infusions may be delayed for 
up to one week for treatment-related toxicities.
Instructions for dose delays and dose reductions for specific toxicities are summarized below. 
For toxicities not specifically addressed in the toxicity management table (Table 2), dosing may 
be delayed for > Grade 2 toxicities for a maximum of one week. If the toxicity has improved to 
≤ Grade 2, the dose should be administered at that time. For a toxicity that delays Day 8 dosing, 
if the toxicity has not resolved to ≤ Grade 2 within one week, dosing should resume with the next 
scheduled cycle, ie, the next dose will be Day 1 of the following cycle. Regardless of whether the 
Day 8 dose is delayed for toxicity, there should be a minimum of 14 days between the Day 8 
infusion and the Day 1 infusion of the next cycle (day of delay is counted as day 1 of this 14-day 
period).
Dose Reductions and Discontinuation
The major toxicities of sacituzumab govitecan are expected to be gastrointestinal symptoms and 
hematologic suppression. All subjects will be closely monitored over the course of their 
treatment and aggressively medically managed, including dose reduction and interruption, in 
order to prevent the need for treatment discontinuation and serious complications of these 
toxicities. All efforts to avoid dose reduction should be taken to address toxicity prior to 
institution of dose reduction. Sacituzumab govitecan dose reductions and interruptions will be 
managed based on toxicity severity, as assessed by [CONTACT_4652] v5.0. Leukopenia or 
lymphopenia in the absence of neutropenia will not require dose delay or dose modification. The 
dose of sacituzumab govitecan must not be re-escalated following a dose reduction. Table 2 
summarizes recommendations for sacituzumab govitecan dose reductions and discontinuations 
for treatment-related toxicities.

product that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can, 
therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, whether or 
not related to the investigational medicinal product.
Adverse events may include worsening or exacerbation of the disease under study; worsening or 
exacerbation of preexisting conditions or events; intercurrent illnesses; or drug interactions. 
Anticipated fluctuations of preexisting conditions that do not represent a clinically significant 
exacerbation or worsening are not considered AEs.
Adverse events should be recorded using medical terminology and whenever possible, a 
diagnosis should be provided for clearly associated signs, symptoms, and/or abnormal laboratory 
results. If the final diagnosis is not known at the time of initial detection, the provisional 
diagnosis or signs or symptoms should be recorded and updated when the final diagnosis is 
available.
Surgical procedures are not AEs; they are therapeutic measures for conditions that require 
surgery. The condition, provided it develops or is a worsening of a preexisting condition for 
which the surgery is required, is the AE.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Events
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
Is fatal (results in death)
Is life-threatening: The subject was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred. 
This does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, or was allowed to 
continue, might have caused death.
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] (in the absence 
of a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505], clinical AE hospi[INVESTIGATOR_647750])

Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in the child of a subject who was exposed to the study 
treatment)
An important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
the event may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such events are intensive 
treatments in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse.
An SAE does not include:
Progression of disease (See Section [IP_ADDRESS])
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a routine clinical procedure
Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (the conditions 
should be documented as appropriate in the eCRF)
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33566]-medical reasons (ie, social admissions, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54598], 
convenience or respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594])
[IP_ADDRESS].  Special Situation Reports 
Special situation reports (SSRs) include all reports of medication error, abuse, misuse, overdose, 
occupational exposure, drug interactions, exposure via breastfeeding, unexpected benefit, 
transmission of infectious agents via the product, counterfeit of falsified medicine, and 
pregnancy regardless of an associated AE. 
Medication error is any unintentional error in the prescribing, dispensing, preparation for 
administration or administration of a study drug while the medication is in the control of a health 
care professional, patient, or consumer. Medication errors may be classified as a medication error 
without an AE, which includes situations of missed dose, medication error with an AE, 
intercepted medication error, or potential medication error.
Abuse is defined as persistent or sporadic intentional excessive use of a study drug by a subject.
Misuse is defined as any intentional and inappropriate use of a study drug that is not in 
accordance with the protocol instructions or the local prescribing information.
An overdose is defined as an accidental or intentional administration of a quantity of a study 
drug given per administration or cumulatively that is above the maximum recommended dose as 
per protocol or in the product labeling (as it applies to the daily dose of the subject in question).

subject cannot account for the discrepancy, except in cases in which the investigator has reason 
to suspect that the subject has taken the additional dose(s).
Occupational exposure is defined as exposure to a study drug as a result of one’s professional or 
nonprofessional occupation.
Drug interaction is defined as any drug/drug, drug/food, or drug/device interaction.
Unexpected benefit is defined as an unintended therapeutic effect where the results are judged to 
be desirable and beneficial. 
Transmission of infectious agents is defined as any suspected transmission of an infected agent 
through a sponsor study drug.
Counterfeit or falsified medicine is defined as any study drug with a false representation of (a) its 
identity, (b) its source, or (c) its history.
10.2.2. Adverse Event and Special Situation Reporting
[IP_ADDRESS]. Requirements for Collection of Events Before Study Drug Initiation
After informed consent, but before initiation of study drug, the following types of events must be 
reported on the applicable eCRFs: all SAEs and any AEs that are related to protocol-required 
procedures.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting Period for Adverse Events
Following initiation of study drug, collect all AEs, regardless of cause or relationship, until 
[ADDRESS_867428] that certain AEs be followed beyond the 
protocol-defined follow-up period.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting Period for Serious Adverse Events
All SAEs, regardless of cause or relationship, that occur after the subject first consents to 
participate in the study (ie, signing the informed consent form) and throughout the duration of 
the study, including the Safety Follow-up visits, must be reported on the applicable eCRFs and to 
[COMPANY_009] Global Patient Safety. This also includes any SAEs resulting from protocol-associated 
procedures performed after the informed consent form is signed.

(including the Safety Follow-up visits detailed in the Schedule of Assessments [Table 1]) or 
within [ADDRESS_867430] dose of study drug or initiation of alternative therapy, whichever is 
later, should also be reported regardless of causality. 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek SAEs after the protocol-defined follow-up period; 
however, if the investigator learns of any SAEs that occur after the protocol-defined follow-up 
period has concluded and the event is deemed relevant to the use of study drug, the investigator 
should promptly document and report the event to [COMPANY_009] Global Patient Safety. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Reporting Period for Special Situation Reports
All study drug SSRs that occur from study drug initiation and throughout the duration of the 
study, including the Safety Follow-up visits, must be reported to the sponsor.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Event Collection and Documentation
Adverse Events Reporting Process
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to document all AEs that occur during the study. All 
adverse events regardless of seriousness, severity, or relationship to the study drug, that occur 
during the safety reporting period, must be recorded in the AE page of the eCRF. AEs should be 
elicited by [CONTACT_63397] a non-leading question (eg, “have you experienced any new or 
changed symptoms since we last asked/since your last visit?”). AEs can also represent abnormal 
findings from laboratory tests and other study procedures. The Investigator must review all 
laboratory and test data; abnormal findings should be assessed to determine if they meet the 
criteria for adverse events (Section [IP_ADDRESS], Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).
For all AEs, the Investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate to assess whether it 
meets the criteria for classification as an SAE and, therefore, requires immediate notification to 
the sponsor or its designee (Section 10.2.5). In addition, sufficient information must be obtained 
by [CONTACT_647764] a causality assessment, which must be done for every adverse 
event. Follow-up by [CONTACT_647765], as assessed by [CONTACT_737]. The outcome of each AE must be provided on the 
eCRF.
To assist in the sponsor’s assessment of each case, further information may be requested from 
the Investigator to provide clarity and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical 
study.
Adverse events and SAEs resulting from SSRs must be reported in accordance with the AE and 
SAE reporting guidance summarized in Sections [IP_ADDRESS] and 10.2.5.

sponsor or the sponsor’s designee in accordance with the timelines summarized in 
Section 10.2.5. The Investigator should include a detailed description of the event(s), including 
the clinical course, criteria for seriousness, treatments administered, action taken with respect to 
study drug, rationale for the Investigator’s assessment, including causality, and other relevant 
information, such as possible alternative etiologies.
Information captured on both the SAE form and entered into the eCRF should be consistent.
Special Situation Reporting Process
All SSRs will be recorded on the special situation report form and forwarded to the sponsor or 
sponsor’s designee in accordance with the timelines summarized in Section [IP_ADDRESS].
[IP_ADDRESS]. Assessment of Adverse Event Severity
The severity of AEs will be graded using NCI CTCAE v5.0. For each SAE, the highest severity 
grade should be reported. If a CTCAE criterion does not exist, the Investigator should assess the 
severity according to the criteria in Table 3.
Table 3. Grading for Adverse Events Not Listed in NCI-CTCAE
CTCAE 
Grade Severity Definition
Grade 1 MildAsymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only;

[COMPANY_009] Sciences, Inc. (Immunomedics, Inc. is now part of the [COMPANY_009] group of companies) Amendment [ADDRESS_867432] 202110.2.2.7. Assessment of Adverse Event Causality
The Investigator’s causality assessment is required for all AEs including both non-serious and 
serious AEs. The causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable 
possibility that the study treatment caused or contributed to an AE. In order to determine 
causality, the Investigator should consider the temporal relationship of the onset of the event to 
the start of study drug; the course of the event and, in particular, whether the event resolves or 
improves with dose reduction or study drug discontinuation; the known toxicities of the study 
drug; events expected to occur in subjects with the disease under study; and concomitant 
medications and comorbidities that may have a known association with the event. Causality is to 
be assessed as follows:
Related: Plausible time relationship to study treatment administration; plausible time 
relationship of improvement or resolution with study drug dose reduction or discontinuation; 
event cannot be explained by [CONTACT_54648], comorbidities, or concomitant 
medications.
Possibly related: a reasonable time sequence to administration of study drug, but which could 
also be explained the underlying disease, comorbidities, or concomitant medications.
Unlikely related: a temporal relationship to drug administration that makes a causal 
relationship improbable and the underlying disease, comorbidities, or concomitant 
medications provide a plausible explanation.
Not related: a causal relationship to the study drug can be easily ruled out.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events Based on Abnormal Test Findings
An abnormal test finding that meets any one of the criteria below should be considered an AE:
Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms.
Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention.
Test result leads to a change in study treatment dosing (eg, dose modification, interruption, or 
permanent discontinuation) or concomitant drug treatment (eg, addition, interruption, or 
discontinuation) or any other change in a concomitant medication or therapy
Test result leads to any of the outcomes included in the definition of an SAE. (Note: This 
would be reported as an SAE, Section 10.2.5)
Test result is considered an AE by [CONTACT_737].

reported as such.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Disease Progression
Disease progression should not be reported as an AE. It is important to differentiate expected 
disease progression from an AE. Events that are clearly consistent with the expected pattern of 
disease progression should not be considered AEs. Expected disease progression refers to an 
event that is unequivocally related to disease progression, and that the clinical course is 
consistent with what would be expected for the subject’s disease. A clinical event in the setting 
of disease progression would be considered an AE if it could not unequivocally be attributed to 
or consistent with expected disease progression.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54596] (as defined above) should not 
be reported as an SAE.
10.2.3. Reporting Deaths
Death is an outcome of an SAE and not, in itself, an SAE. When death is an outcome, the 
event(s) resulting in death should be reported (eg, “pulmonary embolism” with a fatal outcome). 
The appropriate diagnosis (ie, cause of death) should be recorded and assigned severity Grade 5. 
The time period for reporting AEs (including fatal AEs) continues up to [ADDRESS_867434] dose of study drug or initiation of alternative therapy, whichever is 
later, are to be reported if they are assessed by [CONTACT_331590]. Fatal 
AEs meeting these criteria are SAEs and should be reported to the sponsor or the sponsor’s 
designee in accordance with the timelines specified in Section 10.2.5.
Deaths related to progression of the underlying disease during the study will not be reported as 
an SAE (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]) if, in the Investigator’s judgment, the event is unequivocally due 
to the expected course of progression of the underlying disease, and not due to another cause.
10.2.4. Pregnancy Reporting Process
The investigator should report pregnancies in female study subjects that are identified after 
initiation of study drug and throughout the study (including through the protocol-required Safety 
Follow-up visits) or [ADDRESS_867435] study drug dose, whichever is longer, to [COMPANY_009] 
Global Patient Safety using the pregnancy report form within 24 hours of the Investigator 
becoming aware of the pregnancy.

immediately, and no later than 24 hours of becoming aware of the event.
The initial SAE report should be as complete as possible (Section [IP_ADDRESS]); however, reporting 
should not be delayed in order to obtain more information. The SAE should also be entered on 
the applicable eCRF. All follow-up information should be reported within 24 hours of the 
Investigator’s awareness of the information. The Investigator is required to provide follow-up 
information in response to queries from the sponsor or the sponsor’s designee. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_647751],

[COMPANY_009] Sciences, Inc. (Immunomedics, Inc. is now part of the [COMPANY_009] group of companies) Amendment [ADDRESS_867455] been identified for this study.
These risks can be summarized as follows:
1) Study drug supplies
a) Subjects may be unable to return to the site for a number of visits to get the study drug, or 
the site may be unable to accept any subject visits. Without study drugs, the subject 
would not be able to continue their study treatment as planned per protocol.
Mitigation plan: At the earliest opportunity, the site will schedule in-person subject visits 
and return to the regular protocol schedule of assessments.
b) Shipments of study drug could be delayed because of transportation issues. Without study 
drug, enrolled subjects would not be able to continue receiving the study drug as planned 
per protocol.
Mitigation plan: The site’s study drug inventory should be closely monitored. Site staff 
should notify the sponsor or delegate if they foresee shortage in study drug inventory or if 
there is any interruption in local shippi[INVESTIGATOR_54609]. The sponsor will continue to monitor 
inventory at the study drug depot and investigational sites. Manual shipments will be 
triggered as necessary.
2) Subject safety monitoring and follow-up:
a) Subjects may be unable or unwilling to come to the investigational site for their 
scheduled study visits as required per protocol.
Mitigation plan: For subjects who may be unable or unwilling to visit the investigational 
site for their scheduled study visits as required per protocol, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_54610] a remote study visit, via phone or video conferencing, to 
assess the subject within the target visit window date whenever possible. During the 
remote study visit, the following information at minimum will be reviewed:
i) Confirm if subject has experienced any AEs/SAEs/special situations (including 
pregnancy) and follow up on any unresolved AEs/SAEs.
ii) Review the current list of concomitant medications and document any new 
concomitant medications.

[COMPANY_009] Sciences, Inc. (Immunomedics, Inc. is now part of the [COMPANY_009] group of companies) Amendment [ADDRESS_867456] 2021b) Subjects may be unable or unwilling to travel to the site for planned assessments 
(eg, safety blood draws); hence samples may not be sent for central laboratory analyses.
Mitigation plan: Local laboratories or other vendors may be used as appropriate to 
monitor subject safety until the subject can return to the site for their regular follow-up 
per protocol. Any changes in the party conducting laboratory assessments for the study 
due to the pandemic will be documented accordingly. Pregnancy testing may be 
performed using a home urine pregnancy test if local laboratory pregnancy testing is not 
feasible.
c) Subjects may be unable or unwilling to attend the study visit to sign an updated informed 
consent form version.
Mitigation plan: The site staff will follow their approved consent process and remain in 
compliance with the local Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board (EC/IRB) and 
national laws and regulations. Remote consent will be allowed if it has been approved by 
[CONTACT_132639]/IRB. The consent process will be documented and confirmed by [CONTACT_647783].
d) The safety of study subjects is important and testing of COVID-19 infection will be based 
on local clinical guidelines for testing based on signs/symptoms and/or suspected 
exposure to COVID-19.
Mitigation plan: If subject has a diagnosis of COVID-19 while on this clinical study, 
study drug may be held until clinical improvement or resolution in accordance with the 
treating physician’s judgment and general sacituzumab govitecan dose delay guidance in 
the protocol. Additional supportive care and treatment measures for COVID-[ADDRESS_867457] this event 
documented as an AE in the clinical database.
3) Protocol and monitoring compliance:
a) Protocol deviations may occur in case scheduled visits cannot be conducted as planned 
per protocol.
Mitigation plan: If it is not possible to complete a required procedure, an unscheduled 
visit should be conducted as soon as possible when conditions allow. The situation should 
be recorded and explained as a protocol deviation. Any missed subject visits or deviation 
to the protocol due to the pandemic must be reported in the eCRF and described in the 
clinical study report. Any remote study visits that are conducted in lieu of clinic visits due 
to the pandemic will be documented as a protocol deviation related to the pandemic.
b) Study monitors may be unable to carry out source data review or source data verification, 
or study drug accountability or assess protocol and Good Clinical Practice compliance. 
This may lead to delays in source data verification, an increase in protocol deviations, or 
underreporting of AEs.

[COMPANY_009] Sciences, Inc. (Immunomedics, Inc. is now part of the [COMPANY_009] group of companies) Amendment [ADDRESS_867458] 2021Mitigation plan: The study monitor is to remain in close communication with the site to 
ensure data entry and query resolution. Remote source data verification may be arranged 
if allowed by [CONTACT_54675]. The study monitor is to 
reference the Study Monitoring Plan for guidance on how to conduct an off-site 
monitoring visit. The study staff is to save and document all relevant communication in 
the study files. The status of sites that cannot accept monitoring visits and/or subjects 
on-site, must be tracked centrally and updated on a regular basis.
4) Missing data and data integrity:
There may be an increased amount of missing data due to subjects missing 
visits/assessments. This could have an impact on the analysis and the interpretation of 
clinical study data.
Mitigation plan: Implications of a pandemic on methodological aspects for the study will 
be thoroughly assessed and documented, and relevant actions will be taken as appropriate 
(eg, modification of the statistical analysis plan) and in compliance with regulatory 
authorities’ guidance. Overall, the clinical study report will describe the impact of the 
pandemic on the interpretability of study data.
5) Concurrent administration of the COVID-19 vaccine:
There may be potential safety issues due to concurrent administration of the COVID-19 
vaccine and study drug.
Mitigation plan: There is not substantial efficacy or safety data regarding the concurrent 
administration of the COVID-[ADDRESS_867459] is on the study.
Risks will be assessed continuously, and temporary measures will be implemented to mitigate 
these risks as part of a mitigation plan, as described above. These measures will be 
communicated to the relevant stakeholders as appropriate and are intended to provide alternate 
methods that will ensure the evaluation and assessment of the safety of subjects who are enrolled 
in this study. 
Since these potential risks are considered mitigated with the implementation of these measures, 
the expected risk/benefit assessment of sacituzumab govitecan in study subjects remains 
unchanged.

Potential, and Contraceptive Requirements
1) Definitions
a. Definition of Childbearing Potential
For the purposes of this study, a female-born subject is considered of childbearing potential 
following the initiation of puberty (Tanner stage 2) until becoming postmenopausal unless the 
subject is permanently sterile or has medically documented ovarian failure.
Women are considered to be in a postmenopausal state when they are at least [ADDRESS_867462] is permanently sterile by [CONTACT_647784].
2) Contraception Requirements for Female Subjects
a. Study Drug Effects on Pregnancy and Hormonal Contraception
Sacituzumab govitecan is contraindicated in pregnancy because a malformative effect has been 
demonstrated/suspected or is unknown, taking into consideration class effects and genotoxic 
potential. Based on the assessment of published data related to CYP450 enzyme inhibition and 
induction experiments for SN-38, efficacy of hormonal contraception is not expected to be 
impacted due to sacituzumab govitecan administration. A dedicated oral contraceptive drug-drug 
interaction clinical study has not been conducted. Refer to the latest version of the investigator’s 
brochure for additional information.
b. Contraception Requirements for Female Subjects of Childbearing Potential
The inclusion of female subjects of childbearing potential requires the use of highly effective 
contraceptive measures that have a failure rate of less than 1% per year. A negative urine 
pregnancy test is required at baseline prior to study treatment administration on C1D1. The 
baseline urine pregnancy test does not need to be conducted if the screening pregnancy test was 
performed within [ADDRESS_867463] will be required.

Protocol IMMU-132-14 Final
[COMPANY_009] Sciences, Inc. (Immunomedics, Inc. is now part of the [COMPANY_009] group of companies) Amendment [ADDRESS_867464] agree to 1 of the following contraceptive methods:
Complete abstinence from intercourse of reproductive potential. Abstinence is an acceptable 
method of contraception only when it is in line with the subject’s preferred and usual lifestyle. 
Or
Consistent and correct use of 1 of the following methods of birth control listed below: 
Nonhormonal intrauterine device (IUD) 
Hormonal IUD (must be used in conjunction with a barrier method)
Bilateral tubal occlusion (upon medical assessment of surgical success)
Vasectomy in the male partner (upon medical assessment of surgical success)
Or
Female subjects who wish to use a hormonally based method must use it in conjunction with a 
barrier method, preferably a male condom. Hormonal methods are restricted to those associated 
with the inhibition of ovulation. Hormonally based contraceptives and barrier methods permitted 
for use in this protocol are as follows:
Hormonal methods (each method must be used with a barrier method, preferably male 
condom)
a) Oral contraceptives (either combined or progesterone only) (see Appendix [ADDRESS_867465] 
of UGT1A1 inducers and Section 6.5)
b) Injectable progesterone
c) Subdermal contraceptive implant
d) Transdermal contraceptive patch
e) Contraceptive vaginal ring
Barrier methods (each method must be used with a hormonal method)
a) Male condom (with or without spermicide)
b) Female condom (with or without spermicide)

d) Cervical cap with spermicide
e) Sponge with spermicide
Inclusion of methods of contraception in this list of permitted methods does not imply that the 
method is approved in any country or region. Methods should only be used if locally approved. 
Female subjects must also refrain from egg donation, cryopreservation of germ cells, and in vitro 
fertilization during treatment and until the end of contraception requirement. Female subjects 
should be advised to seek advice of the Investigator about egg donation and cryopreservation of 
germ cells before treatment.
3) Contraception Requirements for Male Subjects
It is theoretically possible that a relevant systemic concentration of study drug may be achieved 
in a female partner from exposure of the male subject’s seminal fluid and poses a potential risk 
to an embryo/fetus. Therefore, male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential must 
use condoms during treatment and until [ADDRESS_867467] also refrain from sperm donation, and/or cryopreservation of germ cells 
during treatment and until the end of contraception requirement. Male subjects should be advised 
to seek advice of the Investigator about sperm donation and cryopreservation of germ cells 
before treatment.
4) Unacceptable Birth Control Methods
Birth control methods that are unacceptable include periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, 
symptothermal, postovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and 
lactational amenorrhea method. A female condom and a male condom should not be used 
together.
5) Procedures to be Followed in the Event of Pregnancy
Female subjects will be instructed to notify the Investigator if they become pregnant or suspect 
they are pregnant at any time from start of the study and throughout the study (including the post 
study drug follow-up period) or [ADDRESS_867468] be discontinued immediately upon consultation with the medical 
monitor.
Male subjects whose partner has become pregnant or suspects she is pregnant from start of study 
and throughout the study (including the post study drug follow-up period) or [ADDRESS_867469] also report the information to the investigator. 
Instructions for reporting pregnancy, partner pregnancy, and pregnancy outcome are outlined in 
Section 10.2.4.

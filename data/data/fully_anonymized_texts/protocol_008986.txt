Exploratory:  
Study Design:  
This is an open -label, multi -center, multiple -dose, dose -escalation Phase 1b/2 study to determine the 
safety, PK, and pharmacodynamics of pamiparib  in combination with RT and/or TMZ with two in itial 
arms (Arms A and C) and a potential third arm  (Arm B) . In Arm A, pamiparib  will be combined with RT 
in patient s with first -line GBM  with unmethylated MGMT  promoter (unmethylated GBM ). In Arm B, 
depending on the safety of the Arm A combination, pamiparib  will be combined with both TMZ and RT 
in patient s with first -line unmethylated GBM . In Arm C, pamiparib  will be combined with TMZ in 
patient s with recurrent/refractory GBM  with methylated or unmethylated MGMT  promoter.  
Dose  Escalation Phase 
The d ose escalation phase consists of the following:  
Arm A:  Pamiparib  (60 mg BID ) administered continuously  at increasing exposures of 2, 4, and 
6 week s in combination with RT administered for 6 to 7 weeks . 
Arm B:  Depending on the safety of the Arm A combination, the following combination may be 
explored: pamiparib  (at the exposure determined  as safe  in Arm A) in combination with RT administered 
for 6 to 7 weeks and increasing doses of TMZ.  
In both Arms A and B, a fter RT is completed, patient s will receive no further  RT.  
Maintenance Treatment for Arms A and B :  Following completion of RT, at the discretion of the 
investigator and after discussion with the medical monitor, patients  in Arm A escalation and expansion 
and Arm B escalation phases of the study  may continue to receive pamiparib  in combination with  TMZ .  
In the Arm B expansion  phase of the study , maintenance treatment will be mandatory for all patients .  
Dosing for this m aintenance regimen should begin after the 4-week rest period (+ 7 days) to allow for 
recovery from RT treatment  (as per  Appendix 1  Table 4 ). 
Arm C:  Pamiparib (60 mg BID , administered continuously)  in combination with increasing doses 
of TMZ administered on Days [ADDRESS_1045086] been 
reviewed for the dose escalation cohorts of each of the arms, up to approximately 60 patient s may be 
enrolled in expansion cohorts for each of the  3 arms at a dose level below or equal to the MTD or MAD 
for that arm. In Arm C, 2 expansion cohorts may be opened, one for unmethylated GBM  and one for

 methylated GBM  (Protocol Section 4.3). Therefore, a total of approximately 240 patients  may be enrolled 
in the dose expansion phase.  
Adverse events  (AEs)  during and after the treatment period with study drug(s) will be followed and 
documented as outlined in Protocol  Section  8.4 and Section  10. AEs will be graded according to National 
Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events ( NCI-CTCAE ) v4.03. To determine the 
PK properties of pamiparib , blood samples will be obtained coinciding with specific PK time points as 
outlined in Protocol Section 8.5 and Protocol Appendix  1. 
Disease status will be assessed using Response Assessment in Neuro -Oncology ( RANO ) criteria  
(Appendix  2). Patient s will undergo tumor assessments at Screening and then every [ADDRESS_1045087] completed all study treatments per protocol and do not continue on 
pamiparib in combination with TMZ  (maintenance)  will have their end-of-treatment ( EOT ) visit at the 
end of the Rest Phase, 28 days after RT was completed , unless they do not complete the full study 
treatment; in such a case they should have the EOT  visit within [ADDRESS_1045088] (with the patient ’s guardian, if applicable) approximately every 12 week s as per  Protocol

Study Drug and 
Treatment:  Pamiparib : 
Arm A, Arm B, and Arm C:  60 mg will be administered orally ( PO) twice 
daily ( BID), once in the morning and once in the evening.  The time difference 
between 2 consecutive doses should be approximately 8 to 12 hours . 
Radiation therapy : 
Arm A and Arm B:  RT will be administered once daily ( QD)  5 days/week 
for 6 to 7  weeks with 1.8 or 2 Gy/fraction for a total  target dose of between 58  
Gy and 64  Gy.  
Temozolomide : 
Arm B and Arm C:  flat-dosing will be used for TMZ. For Arm C, t he first 
dose level of 4 0 mg PO QD corresponds to 23  mg/m2 assuming an average 
body surface area of 1.73  m2. Subsequent dose levels of 80 mg and 120 mg , 
correspond ing to 46  mg/m2 and 69 mg/m2, respectively , will be administered 
PO QD.  For Arm B, the first dose level of TMZ will be lower than or equal to  a 
dose that has been determined to be safe and tolerable in Arm C.  
Dose Modifications:  
RT should only be modified for AEs determined to be solely or mostly related to RT as typi[INVESTIGATOR_762650].  
Dosing of pamiparib  and TMZ can be interrupted  for approximately 28 days for medical events that are 
not associated with toxicity related to these study drugs or disease progression.  
Criteria for treatment modifications and suggested guidelines for the management of toxicities related to

Section  4.2.1 . 
The hold and discontinue guidelines  for pamiparib  (without TMZ) also apply in Arm A. After a toxicity 
has adequately resolved, the decision in Arm A of resuming pamiparib  treatment at the same dose level 
versus dose -reducing pamiparib  should be made in discussion with the Medial Monitor.  
Concomitant Therapy and Clinical Practice:  
Permitted Medications  
All treatments and supportive care, including glucocorticoids, antiemetic therapy, hematopoietic growth 
factors and/or red blood cell/platelet transfusions, that the investigator considers necessary for a patient ’s 
welfare may be administered at the discre tion of the investigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_762651]. All concomitant medications taken during the study will be recorded on the case report 
form (CRF) including all prescription and over -the-counter (OTC) drugs, herbal supplements,  and IV 
medications and fluids. If changes occur during the study period, documentation of that change in drug 
dosage, frequency, route, and date will also be included on the CRF.  
All concomitant medications taken by [CONTACT_762692] [ADDRESS_1045099] day of study treatment should be recorded.  
Prohibited Concomitant Therapy  
Patient s are not allowed to receive other anti cancer  therapy, including  surgery, RT (other than 
protocol -specified), and cytotoxic, bio logic , or hormone therapy. Hormone replacement therapy is 
allowed.  
Therapeutic anti coagulation  with heparin, warfarin, or other anticoagulants is not allowed , with the 
exception of l ow molecular weight  heparin  for treatment of patients with thromboembolic  events . 
Low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], non -steroidal anti -inflammatory agents , and thrombolytics to establish patency of 
indwelling venous catheters are allowed, as is prophylactic anticoagulation for venous access devices  as 
long as INR is 1.5 and aPTT 1.5  instit utional ULN ( Protocol  Section 5.1). 
Concomitant Use of CYP Inhibiting Drugs  
The primary metabolic pathway for pamiparib  involves the CYP3A isoform. The c oncurrent 
administration of strong/moderate inhibitors of CYP3A or stron g CYP3A inducers is not allowed. In 
addition, pamiparib  is an inhibitor of CYP2C9 ; careful monitoring should be used when co -prescribing 
CYP2C9 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, such as phenytoin and warfarin.  
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Efficacy : 
Tumor assessments will include all known or suspected disease sites. MRIs will be performed at 
screening (within 14  days of Day 1) and every 8  weeks (7 days) , unless otherwise specified  in 
Appendix  1. Non -contrast cranial MRI may only be used to document disease in those patient s who are 
allergic to contrast. Tumor assessments should be repeated at the end of treatment visit if more than  [ADDRESS_1045100] evaluation. The same imaging technique used at screening should  be

 used throughout the study . 
Anti-tumor activity will be assessed through radiologic  tumor assessments conducted at screening, during 
treatment as specified in the Sche dule of Activity, whenever disease progression is suspected ( eg, 
symptomatic deterioration), and at the time of withdrawal from treatment (if not done in the previous  
4 weeks).  
Assessment of r esponse will be made using the RANO criteria ( Protocol Appendix  2). Responses should 
be confirmed with [ADDRESS_1045101] T1 and T2 FLAIR images, use of corticosteroid dose, 
and clinical status pe r RANO ( Ellingson et al 2015 ).  
Following initial evidence of radiographic progressions and due to the potential for pseudo -progression 
patients  may, at the discretion of the investigator, remain on treatment until further imaging is performed 
at 4 to 8 weeks (at the discretion of the investigator)  after the initial determination of potential 
progression.  
A central indep endent radiology facility (IRF) may evaluate imaging studies and supportive clinical data 
in a central and independent fashion. The IRF will comprise board -certified radiologists who will identify 
baseline lesions and assign post -baseline time point respon ses. 
Safety : 
Safety will be monitored throughout the study. Safety assessments include AE monitoring and reporting, 
physical examinations, vital sign measurements, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and clinical laboratory tests.

Exploratory Endpoints  
Statistical Methods:  
Hypothesis testing will be performed in Phase 2. In addition, descriptive statistics will be used in 
describing the anti tumor  activity and tolerability of the combination regimens in each Phase. Confidence 
intervals will be constructed to describe the precision of the point estimates of interest ( eg, ORR ). 
Tumor assessments  by [CONTACT_762693], modified DCR 
(Arms A and B), DCR (Arm C), PFS , DOR, and CBR , as well as time -point  estimate PFS -6m. OS  and 
OS at  6 months and 12 months (OS-6m and OS -12m), will be summarized in the efficacy analysis. An 
optional independent read of the MRI scans may be performed and will be analyzed in the same fashion.  
Populations:  
 The Safety Analysis Set includes all patient s who received any study treatment ( pamiparib , RT, 
and/or TMZ). The Safety Analysis Set will be used for a ll efficacy and safety analyses.  
 The Efficacy -evaluable Analysis Set includes patient s in the Safety Analysis Set who had  baseline 
and at least one post -baseline tumor assessment, unless discontinued treatment or study early due to 
clinical progression or death prior to tumor assessment.  
 The DLT -evaluable Analysis Set includes patient s who received ≥  42 Gy of RT (Arms A and B) and 
≥ 70% of scheduled pamiparib  (Arms A, B , and C) and TMZ (Arms B and C) during the DLT 
assessment window with sufficient safety assessments. All patient s who had a DLT event will be 
considered DLT -evaluable regardless of study treatment intensity.  
 The PK Analysis Set includes all patient s for wh om valid pamiparib  PK parameters can be estimated.

 Primary Efficacy Analysis:  
Phase 1b  
As described in the protocol objectives, the trial is designed to establish the safety and tolerability of 
pamiparib  in combination with RT and/or TMZ. Evidence of any a ntitumor  activity will be documented 
and summarized for the Safety Analysis Set as secondary endpoints of the trial.  
Phase 2 (Arms A and B)  
Modified DCR is the primary efficacy endpoint in Arms A and B. It is defined as the proportion of 
patient s with CR, PR, or SD  as the response assessment at the EOT  visit, as scheduled per protocol . 
Patient s with no EOT  tumor assessment, as scheduled per protocol (due to any reason), will be considered 
non-responders for modified DCR. Modified DCR of pamiparib  combinatio n therapy is assumed as 60% 
in the study population.  The historical rate in a similar population is estimated as 40% (Rivera et al, 
2010 ).  
The null and alternative hypotheses are set as follows:  
 H0: Modified DCR  = 40% 
 Ha: Modified DCR > 40% 
A binomial exact test will be performed for hypothesis testing in each arm separately in the Safety 
Analysis Set . If the obtained one -sided p -value is < 0.025, it will be concluded that pamiparib  
combination therapy showed a statistically significant increase of modified DCR compared to historical 
control . Therefore, the superiority of pamiparib  combination therapy will be demonstrated in this arm.  
Two-sided binomial exact 95% confidence interval (CI) of modified DCR will be cons tructed to assess 
the precision of the rate estimate.  
The primary efficacy analysis will be conducted when mature response rate data have been observed, 
which will be determined by [CONTACT_456].  
Sensitivity analysis of modified DCR will be carried out in t he Efficacy -evaluable Analysis Set . 
Phase 2 (Arm C)  
ORR is the primary efficacy endpoint in Arm C. ORR of pamiparib  combination therapy is assumed as 
25% in the study population. The historical rate in a similar population is estimated as 10%  (Chen et al 
2013 )  
The null and alternative hypotheses are set as follows:  
 H0: ORR  = 10% 
 Ha: ORR > 10% 
A binomial exact test will be performed similarly to that described for Arms A and B.  
Secondary Efficacy Analysis:  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the secondary efficacy analysis.  
DCR is defined as the proportion of patient s with best overall response (BOR) of CR, PR , or SD. BOR is 
defined as the best response recorded from the start of study treatment until data cut off or start of new 
anti-cancer therapy.  
CBR is defined as the proportion of patient s with BOR of CR, PR , or durable SD (SD ≥  24 weeks).  
Exact 95% CIs will be calculated for the rate variables: ORR  for patients with measurable dise ase at 
baseline , DCR and CBR in the Safety Analysis Set . 
BeiGene [LOCATION_003], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -290-[ADDRESS_1045102].  
PFS censoring rule will follow  the FDA Gu idance for Industry, Clinical Trial Endpoints for Approval of 
Cancer Drugs and Biologics (2007) . Patient s who have a clinical determination of progression should 
undergo an MRI, if possible, to correlate radiographic findings with the clinical findings. Da ta for patient s 
without disease progression or death at the time of analysis will be censored at the time of the last tumor 
assessment. Data for patient s who are lost to follow -up prior to documented disease progression will be 
censored at the last tumor assessment date when the patient  was known to be progression -free. Data for 
patient s who started new anti -cancer therapy will be censored at the last tum or assessment date prior to 
the introduction of new therapy. More details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan .  
DOR is defined as the time from the date of the earliest documented response to disease progression or 
death for any cause, whiche ver occurs earlier. Only responders will be included in the DOR calculation.  
OS is defined as the time from the date of first study treatment to death  from any cause . 
Time -to-event variables PFS, DOR , and OS will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method  in the 
Safety Analysis Set . Kaplan -Meier estimates of PFS, DOR , and OS will be plotted over time. Median 
PFS, DOR , and OS  for each arm will be presented  (if possible to estimate) , along with their 2 -sided 95% 
CIs using generalized Brookmeyer and Crowley m ethod. The PFS -6m, OS -6m, and OS -12m, defined as 
the percentages of patients in the analysis population who remain alive an d progression -free at 6 months 
(or alive at 6 or 12 months for OS -6m and OS -12m), will be estimated using Kaplan -Meier method along 
with the corresponding 95 % CI  constructed using Greenwood’s formula. OS will be assessed by [ADDRESS_1045103] patient enrolled on the study had died . 
Selected efficacy endpoints will be summarized in the Efficacy -evaluable Analysis Set as sen sitivity 
analysis.  
In Phase 2, modified DCR (in Arms A and B) and ORR (in Arm C) will be summarized in the specified 
subgroups: sex, age group (<65  vs. ≥  65 years of age ), race, ECOG performance status (0  vs. ≥  1), prior 
surgery status, baseline corticoste roid use, mutations , and geographic region. In addition, ORR (in Arm 
C) will be summarized by [CONTACT_192555].  
Pharmacokinetic Analyses:  
Population PK analysis may be carried out to include plasma concentrations from this trial in an existing 
model. PK parameters such as  minimum observed plasma concentration  (Cmin) will be summarized, and 
additional PK parameters such as apparent clearance of the drug from plasma (CL/F) and area under the 
plasma concentration -time curve from zero to [ADDRESS_1045104] -dose (A UC 0-24) may be derived from the 
population PK analysis if supported by [CONTACT_33653].  
Exposure -response (efficacy or safety endpoints) analysis may be carried out if supported by [CONTACT_33653].  
Exploratory Efficacy Analyses:  
Safety Analysis:  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_762694] v4.03 . Laboratory 
values ( hematology , clinical chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis), vital signs, physical examinations , 
and ECG findings will also be used in determining the safety  of study treatment . 
Sample Size:  
Approximately 300 patient s (60 in Phase 1b and 240 in Phase 2) may be enrolled. The actual sample size 

BeiGene [LOCATION_003], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -290-104 23 July 2018  
Protocol Version 2.0   
 
 
Page 16 of 139 
 in Phase 1b will depend on the number of cohorts enrolled per arm.  
In Phase 2, the sample size calculation is carried out using modified DCR in Arms A and  B and ORR in 
Arm C.  
 Assuming modified DCR of 60% in Arms A and B vs. 40% in historical control, the power of a 
binomial exact test is 0.874 in each arm when n  = 60. 
 Assuming ORR of 25% in Arm C vs. 10% in historical control, the power of a binomial exact  test is 
0.847 when n  = [ADDRESS_1045105] 95% CI of modified DCR is (46.5%, 72.4%) in Arms A 
and B and the binomial exact 95% CI of ORR is (14.7%, 37.9%) in  each expansion cohort of  Arm C.  
Interim Analysis:  
A brief data summary will be performed once the Phase 1b dose escalation portion is completed. In 
Phase  2, an interim analysis will be implemented in each arm  after approximately the first 20 patient s in 
that arm complete ≥  2 tumor assessments. T his analysis is for futility only. No recruitment stop is planned 
for this interim analysis. If the conditional or predictive power of demonstrating the final efficacy is 
< 10%, enrollment in this arm will be halted and safety and efficacy data will be fur ther evaluated before 
making the decision of whether to stop the arm permanently. Otherwise, the enrollment will be continued 
to approximately [ADDRESS_1045106] OF ABBREVIATIONS AND DEFINITIONS OF TERMS  ................................ .....................  24

 Page 27 of 139 1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1. Biology of Glioblastoma  
Glioblastoma s multiforme  (GBM), the most aggressive subtype of gliomas , harbor a range of 
oncogenic mutations. These mutations are associated with resistance to both chemotherapy and 
radiation therapy (RT) . A substantial number of these genetic alterations affect  key players in DNA 
repair pathways . 
 Methylation of the  O6-methylguanine -DNA methyltransferase ( MGMT ) gene promoter 
and Mismatch Repair (MMR) gene mutations : MGMT  promoter methylation was 
associated wit h a profound shift in the nucleotide substitution spectrum of treated GBM s. 
Notably, high occurrence of MMR gene mutations was observed in MGMT -
hypermethylated tumors (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network 2008 ). 
 Down regulation of the p53 signaling pathway: Around 70% of GBM  patients were 
reported to have somatic mutations affecting the p53 pathway. Inactivation of the p53 
pathway was due to ARF deletion in 55%, MDM2 amplification in 11%, and MDM4  
amplification  in 4% of GBM  patients  (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network 2008 ). 
 Downregulation of the retinoblastoma (RB) signaling pathway: R B1 and its paralogs p107 
and p130 play a central role in DNA double -strand break (DSB) repai r by [CONTACT_105] -
homologous end joining (NHEJ) (Huang et al 2015 ). A high frequency of mutations 
affecting the RB pathway w as reported for GBM . The most common alterations were  
deletion of the CDKN2A  and CDKN2B loc i on chromosome  9p21 in 55% and 53%  of the 
cases , respectively , followed by [CONTACT_762695]4 locus in 14% (Cancer Genome 
Atlas Research Network 2008 ). 
 Upregulation of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR)/Ras/phospha tidylinositol -3-
OH kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway through PTEN alterations: PTEN alterations have 
been reported in 34% of GBM  (Smith et al 2001 ). PTEN loss leads to defects in DNA 
DSB  repair by [CONTACT_10579] (HR) . 
The high frequency of genetic alterations in GBM  affecting DNA re pair pathways suggests that 
DNA -damaging agents or agents interfering with DNA repair may be able to provide clinical benefit 
for GBM  patients. This hypothesis is supported by [CONTACT_762696], such as inhibitors of poly(ADP -ribose) 
polymerase (PARP).  
1.2. Imaging and Treatment of Glioblastoma  
1.2.1.  Overview and Key Data  for Gliobla stoma  
GBM  is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults with approximately 10,000 cases 
diagnosed annually in the [LOCATION_002] (US)  and with a dismal prognosis despi[INVESTIGATOR_762653], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -290-104 23 July 2018  
Protocol Version 2.0   
 
 
 Page 28 of 139 treatment (CBTRU S 2012 ). Because of the infiltrative nature of GBM , surgery alone is never 
curative. Therefore, the majority of patients are subsequently treated with RT with or without 
chemotherapy. In 2005, Stupp and colleagues published a landmark study demonstrating a  
2.5-month overall survival (OS) benefit with the addition of the alkylating agent temozolomide 
(TMZ) to surgery and RT  (Stupp et al 2005 ). The results of this large trial established the role of 
TMZ, along with maximal safe resection and RT, for the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM  
patients <65  years old. Preliminary evidence that inactivation of the MGMT  protein conferred 
sensitivity to TMZ (Esteller  et al 2000 ; Hegi et al 2004 ) and TMZ’s efficacy in recurrent glioma 
(Yung et al 200 0) served as supporting data for this large, randomized, Phase 3 trial. Subset analyses 
confirmed improved survival and sensitivity to TMZ for tumors deficient in MGMT  (defined by 
[CONTACT_762697]) compared to those with adequate MGMT  expression (defined by [CONTACT_762698]) (Hegi et al 2005 ).  
Since the added benefit with use of TMZ is limited in the MGMT promoter unmethylated 
glioblastoma population, the risk -benefit ratio of combined modality treatment in these patients (eg, 
myelosuppression and an increased risk of pseudo -progression events) has been questioned. In 
contrast, a recently published randomized study of short -course radiation plus TMZ in elderly 
patients with GBM ( Perry et al 2017 ) demonstrated the benefit of chemoradiotherapy in patients with 
either methylated or unmethylated MGMT  status. Hence, significant regional debate remains with 
respect to whether incorporation of TMZ should be based upon  MGMT  methylation status alon e 
(Newlands et al 1997 , Stupp et al 2001 ). The current European Association for Neuro -Oncology 
guidelines for glioma do acknowledge the option of radiotherapy only for newly diagn osed MGMT 
promoter unmethylated glioblastoma.  This reverses the older European Society for Medical 
Oncology guideline that reserved this option for patients treated within clinical trials ( Weller et al 
2017 ; Stupp et al 2014 ). More recently, several clinical trials evaluated an investigational agent in 
combination with RT but without TMZ in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma and 
unmethylated MGMT  promoter ( Wick et al 2016 ; Herrlinger et al 2016 ; Nabors et al 2015 ). 
1.2.2.  Imaging of Glioblastomas  
An important aspect to the treatment of glioblastoma is appropriate imaging and detecti on of 
response. Standard -of-care GBM  neuroimaging includes the following.  
1. After initial primary debulking surgery, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain 
without and with contrast can serve as baseline imaging prior to start of RT ± chemotherapy.  
2. After surgery and RT, MRI of the brain without and with contrast is usually performed [ADDRESS_1045113] is then repeated every 3 months for 3 years, followed by [INVESTIGATOR_135] 6 months for an 
additional 2 years, and then annual ly.

Protocol Version 2.0   
 
 
 Page 29 of 139 Notwithstanding standardization of imaging, challenges in the neuroimaging evaluation of patients 
undergoing treatment for GBM  remain. In particular, differentiating a treatment response from tumor 
progression can be problematic, and a validated neuroi maging method to clearly distinguish between 
pseudo -progression and tumor progression has unfortunately not been found to date.  
In multicenter MRI studies, standardization of MR scanners and parameters ( eg, field strength, 
gradient system, manufacturer, an d sequences) must be considered. It is well known that even minor 
differences in hardware or sequence timing may result in significant changes in image contrast and 
analysis. Lesion contrast is also dependent on the magnetic field strength of the scanner,  with higher 
field strengths showing higher contrast -to-noise compared with lower field strength scanners ( eg, 3 T 
vs 1.5 T).  
Ellingson and colleagues have provided recommendations for brain tumor MRI acquisition for use in 
multicenter clinical trials to re duce variability associated with response assessment  
(Ellingson  et al 2015 ). The protocol was designed to allow flexibility in terms of adding subsequent 
imaging techniques, such as the addition of perfusion MRI p rior to acquisition of post -contrast 
3D T1-weighted images, the addition of susceptibility -weighted or gradient -echo acquisition before 
contrast injection, or acquisition of post -contrast, 2D T1 -weighted turbo spin -echo (TSE) images 
following post -contrast  3D T1 -weighted image acquisition.  
1.2.3.  O6-methylguanine -DNA Methyltransferase Status and Treatment Response  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Methylation of the O6 -methylguanine -DNA Methyltransferase ( MGMT ) Gene 
Promoter  
TMZ and other alkylating agents,  including the nitrosoureas carmustine an d lomustine, are 
commonly used cytotoxic chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_762654] . They induce 
apoptosis and cell death by [CONTACT_762699]  O6 position, initiating a DSB in the DNA and 
cell cycle arrest. The MGMT  protein removes the damaging alkyl groups from the  O6 position of 
guanine and repairs the DNA. The alkylated protein is then degraded, requiring constant 
replenishment for DNA repair to be effective.  
High expression of MGMT  in cancer cells, including glio ma cells, account for the predominant 
mechanism of resistance to alkylating agents. Consistent with this finding, lack of MGMT  protein 
correlates with increased sensitivity to DNA -damaging agents, like temozolomide or XRT. The 
absence of MGMT  protein in GBM has been determined to be almost exclusively caused by 
[CONTACT_762700] (Hegi et al 2005 ) referred to hereafter as ‘ MGMT  
methylation’ or ‘methylated GBM .’ 
Conversely, patients with an un methylated MGMT promoter or higher levels of MGMT  protein in 
their tumors are less likely to respond to alkylating agents resulting in shorter survival compared 
with patients with a methylated MGMT  promoter or lower levels of MGMT  protein ( Table 1).  
It is known that MGMT  is inactivated after each reaction ( ie, suicide enzyme). Therefore, if the rate 
of DNA alkylation were to outpace the rate of MGMT  protein synthesis, the enzyme could, in theory, 
BeiGene [LOCATION_003], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -290-[ADDRESS_1045114] shown that prolonged exposure to TMZ can deplete MGMT  
activity in blood cells, a process that could potentially increase the antitumor activity of the drug  
(Brandes et al 2006 ; Gilbert et al 2013 ; Strik et al 2008 ; Tolcher et al 20 03). This resistance to TMZ 
remains a critical barrier  to the effective treatment of glioblastoma.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  MGMT  Methylation Status and Significance for Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_762655], studies have 
consistently demonstrated improved outcomes for patients with methylated GBM  regardless of 
treatment, showed added benefit with TMZ , and suggested that  MGMT  methylation is both 
prognostic and predictive ( Table 1).

In several studies on improving treatment of patients with newly diagnosed GBM without MGMT  
promoter methylation (and thus little or no benefit at all of the addition of TMZ to be expected), 
TMZ has been left out of the investigational arm.  Multiple Europe an-led trials have used RT alone, 
rather than  RT with chemotherapy, as the comparative arm in trials of novel targets to replace TMZ

 Page 32 of 139 (Herrlinger et al 2014 ; Wick et al 2014 , Wick et al 2013 ). The GLARIUS trial, a randomized Phase 2 
study of irinotecan, bevacizumab , and RT versus TMZ and RT in newly diagnosed unmethylated 
GBM  found a significantly prolonged median progression -free survival (m PFS) of 9.[ADDRESS_1045115] arm (Herrlinger et al 2014 ). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_762656], the median overall survival (mOS) between the two groups was 
comparable (16.6  months compared with 17.3 months , respectively ). This suggested that it is 
reasonable to omit TMZ in newly diagnosed unmethylated patients without adversely impacting the 
patients’ survival  (Herrlinger  et al 2014 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS].  MGMT  Methylation Status and Significance for Recurrent Glioblastoma  
In the recurrent setting,  MGMT  methylation status has yet to guide treatment. Preliminary data 
suggested that prolonged exposure to TMZ may suppress MGMT  activity, therefore making the cells 
more susceptible than the standard 5 -day regimen (Days 1 to 5 of a 28 -day cycle)  (Hegi 2005 ). This 
hypothesis led to a series of studies of dose -dense schedules to prevent repletion of MGMT  and 
impro ve sensitivity to TMZ and shift the outcome of unmethylated GBM  patients toward methylated 
GBM  patients  (Perry et al 2010 ; Weller et al 2010 ; Weller et al 2013 ). A large, randomized trial of 
dose-dense TMZ (21  days on and 7  days off at 100  mg/m2) in the adjuvant setting (RTOG 0525) in 
newly diagnosed GBM  patients resolved the conflicting data on timing of standard temozolomide 
and efficacy of alternative dosing. No improvement was seen in mPFS or mOS with dose -dense 
TMZ, regardless of  MGMT  promoter methylation status (Gilbert et al  2013 ). These findings, in 
addition to r esults from dose -dense TMZ at recurrence (Wick et al 2009 ) suggest that unmethylated 
tumors cannot be ‘sensitized’ to TMZ by [CONTACT_762701].  
The standard dosing of TMZ (Days 1 to 5 of a 28 -day cycle) has shown a favorable safety profile 
and modest efficacy in clinical trials. TMZ in increased dose density schedules in maintenance after 
RT and for recurrent tumors that have evaded from prior standard therapy that may include TMZ 
appears to be a rational app roach.  
1.2.4.  Treatment  Toxicity  
The dose -limiting factor associated with chemotherapy for GBM  is bone marrow toxicity. Daily, 
low-dose TMZ given concomitantly with RT rarely affects platelet or neutrophil counts, but patients 
usually experience some degree of ly mphopenia. In contrast, the standard TMZ dosing and schedule 
(Stupp et al 2005 ) used for adjuvant treatment frequently causes neutropenia and/or 
thrombocytopenia.  
To achieve clinical benefit, it is imperative that the mag nitude of any sensitizing effect for TMZ is 
significantly greater in the tumor than in the critical normal tissues. Targeting DNA repair pathways 
might be predicted to achieve tumor -specific chemo - and/or radio -sensitization.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Toxicity of Dose -dense T emozo lomide  Regimens  
Studies have been conducted to assess the safety concerns (Neyns et al 2010 ). The greater dose 
intensity achieved in these studies  does not appear to significantly increase the frequency of

 Page 33 of 139 thrombocytopenia or neutropenia (Gilbert et al 2013 ). Available data from Phase 2 trials indicate a 
high incidence of lymphopenia (8 % to 68%), a common TMZ tox icity, and a slight increase in 
fatigue. Grade 3 or 4 lymphopenia in trials using the 21 of 28 days TMZ schedule (75  mg/m2) 
occurred in 24 % to 53% of cases, and Grade 4 lymphopenia , which may increase the risk of 
opportunistic infections, was reported in 4 7% in one study for recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma or 
oligoastrocytoma  (Neyns  et al 2008 ). 
In the RTOG 0525 study, adverse events (AEs) were evaluated separately during the concurrent 
chemo - and radiotherapy and the a djuvant treatment phase. Grade [ADDRESS_1045116] 
common toxicity occurring in 12% of patients but without significant opportunistic infections. 
Serious neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 3.6% and 6.8%, respectively, of all patients 
undergoing RT. There was one treatment -related death as a result of neutropenia (Gilbert et al 2013 ). 
1.3. Background on Poly (ADP -ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors and Pamiparib ( BGB -290) 
1.3.1.  Poly (ADP -ribose) Polymerase (PARP)  and Pamiparib  
Poly (ADP -ribose) polymerase (PARP) proteins are involved in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) 
replication, transcriptional regulation, and DNA damage repair. Inhibition of PARP converts 
common single -strand DNA breaks into double -strand breaks during  DNA replication. DNA -bound 
PARP1/2 catalyzes the synthesis of poly (ADP -ribose) (PAR) onto a range of DNA -associated 
proteins that mediate DNA repair. PARP1 also undergoes auto -PARylation, a molecular change that 
ultimately leads to its release from DNA (Leonetti et al 2012 ). 
Small -molecule inhibitors of PARP1/[ADDRESS_1045117] by [CONTACT_338504]1/[ADDRESS_1045118] a germline mutation in the BRCA  gene (Approved product prescribing 
information ; available online ). 
Pamiparib (also known as BGB -290) is a highly potent and selective inhibitor of PARP1 and PARP2 
with demonstrated brain penetrance in nonclinical studies (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). As such it has the 
potential to differentiate from other PARP inhibitors by [CONTACT_605475] -trappi[INVESTIGATOR_762657].  This brain penetrance is particularly relevant within a GBM 
population where few cytotoxic drugs have demonstrated efficacy, thought to be due, at least in part, 
to the blood -brain barrier preventing adequate delivery to these tumors.  
1.3.2.  PARP Inhibitors and Glioblastoma  
As summarized in Section 1.1, GBM s have a high prevalence of genetic alterations affecting DNA 
repair pathways, raising the possibility that PARP inhibitors may be able to contribute to clinical 
benefit for GBM  patients. Whereas thi s hypothesis has not been adequately explored in the clinic,

 Page 34 of 139 nonclinical data for one such alteration, PTEN loss, support the concept of synthetic lethality of 
PARP inhibition with other pathways aside from BRCA1/[ADDRESS_1045119] been frequently observed in GBM  (Endersby [CONTACT_762702]  2008 ; 
Li and Ross 2007 ) and have been estimated to occur in about one third of GBM s (Huang et al  2015 ). 
PTEN is a lipid phosphatase with a role in dampening PI3K/Akt signaling, and PTEN loss results in 
PI3K/Akt pathway hyperactivation. However, PTEN also plays a role in the maintenance of genome 
stability  as demonstrated using mouse embryonic PTEN -/- cells. This phenotype was related to a 
defect in the regulation of the expression of RAD51, an important HR component (Shen et al  2007 ). 
Synthetic lethality of PTEN loss an d PARP inhibition is supported by [CONTACT_762703] -/- human GBM  cell lines, whereas 
astrocytes with the intact PTEN gene are less sensitive to veliparib . PTEN -deficient astrocytes and  
GBM  cells were also more sensitive to the methylating agent N -methyl -N′-nitro -N-nitrosoguanidine 
(MNNG) with a mechanism of action very similar to TMZ  (McEllin et al 2010 ). These data suggest 
that GBM s with defects in DNA repair pathways may be sensitive to PARP inhibition,  in particular 
when combined with DNA -damaging agents . 
1.3.3.  PARP Inhibitors in Combination with Temozolomide or Radiation  
PARP -[ADDRESS_1045120] a key role in the base excision repair (BER) of N -methylp urines 
(N7-methylguanine and N3 -methyladenine) that are generated by [CONTACT_338511]. In the presence of a 
functional BER system these damaged bases are promptly repaired and limit TMZ cytotoxicity. The 
first step of the BER process is the excision of the modified bas e by N -methylpurine glycosylase 
(MPG) resulting in an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site that is subsequently cleaved by 
[CONTACT_338512]/apyrimidinic endonuclease. The resultant DNA nicks are finally repaired by [CONTACT_762704] -1, DNA polymerase,  XRCC1 and ligase III. Inhibition of PARP activity 
hampers PARylation of PARP -1 and PARP -2, interrupting the completion of the repair process 
mediated by [CONTACT_311088] (Kim and Wilson  2012 ). Combining PARP inhibition with DNA -damag ing TMZ 
leads to increased DNA damage that results in apoptosis and/or growth arrest. Repeated treatments 
with TMZ and PARP inhibitors also downregulate transcription and delay recovery of BER 
components in tumor cells  (Tento ri et al 1999 ; Tentori et al 2001 ). This mechanism might further 
enhance the cytotoxic effects of TMZ combined with a PARP inhibitor . 
Since the discovery of synthetic lethality of PARP inhibitors in BRCA -deficient cells, accumulation 
of unrepaired single -strand breaks ( SSBs ) resulting from catalytic PARP inhibition has been 
considered central to the mechanism of action of PARP inhibitors. More recently, it has been 
demonstrated that PARP inhibitors also t rap PARP1 - and PARP2 -DNA complexes at DNA damage 
sites and that PARP trappi[INVESTIGATOR_762658] (Kedar et al 2012 ; Murai 
et al 2012 ; Murai et al, 2014a ; Fojo and Bates  2013 ). Murai and colleagues investigated whether 
PARP trappi[INVESTIGATOR_762659]. To this purpose, a PA RP inhibitor with potent PARP -trappi[INVESTIGATOR_338471], olaparib, was 
compared to a PARP inhibitor with similar catalytic PARP inhibition but significantly less PARP -
trappi[INVESTIGATOR_338471], veliparib. Both drugs showed highly synergistic effects with the toposisomeras e I 
inhibitor camptothecin, consistent with catalytic PARP inhibition being important for the activity of

significantly more effective than veliparib indicating that PARP  trappi[INVESTIGATOR_762660] l for the 
combination activity  (Murai et al 2014b ). Gill and colleagues similarly showed that sensitivity to a 
PARP inhibitor was due to DNA -trappi[INVESTIGATOR_762661] -mediated potentiation of PARP 
inhibitor activity was associated with enhanced t rappi[INVESTIGATOR_48817]1 -DNA complexes (Gill et al 
2015 ). These data suggest that combinations of TMZ with PARP inhibitors with potent DNA -
trappi[INVESTIGATOR_762662].  
In glioma cells, pharmacological modulation of PARP activity increased growth inhibition by [CONTACT_762705] p53 -wild-type and p53 -mutant glioblastoma cells and markedly lowered the TMZ IC [ADDRESS_1045121] been ineffective, the combination of TMZ with th e PARP 
inhibitor reverted resistance to the methylating compound  (Tentori et al 2001 ; Tentori et al 2002 ; 
Tentori et al 2003 ). These  data suggest that GBM  patients who derive less benefit from current 
standard of care because of lack of MGMT  promoter methylation may benefit from a combination 
regimen that includes a PARP inhibitor.  
Several clinical studies have been conducted with PAR P inhibitors (olaparib, rucaparib, and 
veliparib) in combination with TMZ . To determine the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) in these 
studies, TMZ was administered at standard doses ( 135 to 150 mg/m2/day or up to

challenge of significant myelosuppression as dose -limiting toxicities  (DLTs) , and observed 
anti-tumor activity was only modest  (Gabrielson  et al 2015 ; Gojo et al 2017 ; Hussain et al 2014 ; 
Middleton et al 2015 ; Plummer  et al 2013 ; Su et al  2014 ). This is contrasted by a recent study for 
talazoparib, a PA RP inhibitor with very good DNA -trappi[INVESTIGATOR_338471]. Stan dard doses of talazoparib 
(0.5 to  1 mg) were administered with low doses of TMZ in patient s with non -BRCA1/2 -mutated 
cancers  (Wainberg  et al 2016 ) The starting  dose of TMZ was 25  mg/m2, approximately 12.5% of the 
therapeutic dose, and the MTD was determined as 1  mg talazoparib plus 37 mg/m2 of TMZ. This 
regimen was better tolerated than repor ted for prior studies, with less thrombocytopenia and 
neutropenia. Furthermore, promising efficacy was observed with 11 patient s (61%) experiencing 
either a partial response or stable disease. These preliminary clinical results are in support of the

1.3.4.  Nonclinical Data for Pamiparib  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Nonclinical Safety Dat a 
The nonclinical toxicity and toxicokinetic profile of pamiparib  was characterized in single and up to 
91-day repeat -oral-dose studies in rats and dogs, and in a core battery of genotoxicity tests, including 
in vitro Ames and chromosomal aberration assays, and in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assays in 
rats. Safety pha rmacology assessments included in vitro hERG channel activity assays and in vivo 
studies of cardiovascular function in dogs, as well as central nervous system and respi[INVESTIGATOR_762664].  
The main toxicity findings were bone marrow inhibi tion that correlated with clinical pathology 
changes and gastrointestinal toxicity that presented as emesis, decreased food consumption and 
decreased body weight. The systemic exposure increased dose -proportionally without apparent sex 
differences or accum ulation. The MTD  was considered to be 6  mg/kg in rats and 3 mg/kg in dogs for 
both 28 -day and 91 -day toxicity studies.  
Pamiparib  was not mutagenic in the in vitro  Ames (bacterial reverse mutation) assay, but clastogenic 
in the in vitro  chromosomal aberrat ion assay in mammalian Chinese hamster ovary  cells and in the in 
vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in rats, which is consistent with its mechanism of action. 
PARP enzymes are involved in normal cellular homeostasis, such as DNA transcription, cell cycle 
regulation and DNA damage repair . Pamiparib  interacts with and inhibits the enzymatic repair 
machinery that carries out detection and repair of single -strand DNA breaks (SSBs).  
In the general toxicity studies in rats and dogs, no gross lesions or histopath ological changes were 
noted in male and female reproductive organs. No embryo -fetal toxicity studies were conducted or 
planning as it was not considered essential because of its genotoxicity and bone marrow inhibition.  
There was no apparent inhibition of pamiparib  on hERG channel as the value of half -maximal 
inhibition concentration ( IC50) was 12.4 μM; for comparison, the IC 50 of the positive control 
amitriptyline was 1.9 μM. No effects on blood pressure, heart rate or ECGs were noted in telemetry -
instrumen ted conscious dogs. No effects on  the central nervous system or respi[INVESTIGATOR_338475] -Dawley rats. No abnormal changes in the cardiovascular, central nervous system, 
and respi[INVESTIGATOR_762665] - or repeat -dose tox icity studies in both rats and dogs. 
No QT interval prolongation was noted in cardiovascular function studies in conscious dogs and in 
28-day and 91 -day repeat -dose toxicity studies in dogs. Embryo -fetal toxicity studies were not 
conducted because of the a lready established genotoxicity of and bone marrow inhibition by

18%. In a tissue distribution study in rats,  pamiparib  was detected in all organs checked after oral 
administration.  Specifically, in individual rat brains, the ratio of brain to blood concentration ranged 
from 21% to 63% over time (0.5 to 24 hours) with a mean brain/blood ratio (AUC 1~4h) of 26%.  
A population pharmacokinetic /pharmacodynamic (PK/ PD) model was developed based on clinical 
PK data from Phase 1 trial BGB -290-AU-002 (Section 1.3.5 ) and tissue distribution data from rats. 
Simulated brain concentration -time profiles in a typi[INVESTIGATOR_762666] 60 mg BID was above the threshold of 0.5  M identified from a sensi tive animal 
model for efficacy  (Figure 2).

cell lines resistant to single -agent TMZ (EC 50 of 32 M or greater). In 7 of 8 cell lines, pamiparib  
demonstrated synergism with TMZ with a shift in EC 50 for TMZ of 5 -fold or greater. This synergism 
was also demonstrated in vivo in an  H209 small cell lung cancer  xenograft model  (Figure  3). 
Pamiparib  (2.73 mg/kg BID  x 21 days) as single -agent treatment had no  significant  effect on tumor 
growth . TMZ (50 mg/kg QD , Days 1 -5 of each 28-day cycle) as single -agent treatment was quit e 
effective in this model  resulting  in objective  response s in all animals (1 PR and 7 CRs in 8 animals ) 
after the  first cycle of treatment . However, 6 of these 8 animals  developed TMZ  resistance  after 
3 cycle s of treatment,  and the mean tumor volume  reache d 505  mm3 on Day 66.  Addition of 
pamiparib  (0.68  mg/kg BID , Days 1 -5 of each 28-day cycle)  resulted  in objective  response s in all 
animals (2 PRs and 6 CRs in 8 animals ) after the  first cycle of treatment.  After completion of 
3 cycle s of treatment  (on Day 66), most animals were still tumor -free (6/8) , and the mean tumor 
volume  was 12  mm3. Thus, the combination of pamiparib  and TMZ significantly enhanced TMZ 
antitumor  activity and delayed resistance.

Given the significant brain penetrance of pamiparib , its activity was further explored in an 
intracranial tumor model in nude mice for H209 -T small cell lung cancer xenografts  (Figure 4). 
H209 -T is a TMZ -resistant cell line generated by [CONTACT_125908] H209 -xenografted tumors with multiple 
cycles of TMZ in vivo.  In this model, pamiparib  (2.73 mg/kg BID) as single -agent treatment ha d no 
significant  effect on tumor growth , with a median  survival of 24 days compared to median  survival 
of 22.5 days in the vehicle -treated group. H209 -T intracranial xenografts showed resistance to the 
TMZ treatment alone (50  mg/kg) , with median  survival o f 26.5 days. However, the combination of 
pamiparib  and TMZ significantly prolonged animal survival compared to TMZ (p<0.01) , with 
median  survival of 54 days . The result suggests pamiparib  in combin ation  with TMZ can overcome 
TMZ resistance  in this intracra nial model.

Based on pharmacodynamic data , with an apparent flat exposure -response for PAR inhibition and 
objective respons es observed at lower dose levels, the decrease in C max and the modest decrease of 
15% in overall exposure with high -fat meal is not considered to be clinically significant. However, 
since pamiparib is not a substrate to known active transporters, and its b rain penetration is thought to 
be driven by [CONTACT_762708] a concentration gradient, in a brain tumor population where 
brain pentrance is key, the reduction in C max may reduce brain penetration of pamiparib.  Therefore, 
in GBM stud ies, patient s will continue to be required to fast for 1 hour  before and 2 hours after 
pamiparib administration.

 Page 43 of 139 Hematologic AEs, regardless of relatedness, were reported in 40% of patients (n = 18). Anemia was 
most frequent (33%, n = 15), followed by [CONTACT_127867] (11%, n = 5) and  thrombocytopenia (2%, 
n = 1). 
Twenty -six patients experienced Grade 3 AEs (regardless of relatedness), and no Grade 4 AEs were 
reported. Eleven Grade 3 AEs in 9 patients (20%) were considered related to pamiparib: anemia 
(n = 5), neutropenia (n = 3) , hypo phosphatemia (n = 1), nausea (n = 1) and fatigue (n = 1). Serious 
AEs (SAEs) reported as related to pamiparib included anemia (n = 2) and nausea (n = 1).  
SAEs were reported in 25 patients, and for 3 patients they were considered related to BGB 290: 
anemia (n = 2) and nausea (n = 1). Three patients discontinued study drug because of an AE: 
vomiting (n = 1), oral paresthesia (n = 1), and right neck cutaneous metastases (n = 1).  
Four patients experienced a fatal AE  ≤ [ADDRESS_1045130] pamiparib  dose. All deaths were due to 
complications of the underlying malignancy, and none was considered related to pamiparib . 
Four patients experienced AEs that were considered DLTs : Grade [ADDRESS_1045131] medical therapy in 2 patients; Grad e 2 anorexia and Grade 2 nausea in 1 patient, 
and Grade 2 nausea and Grade 2 paresthesia in 1 patient. Based on the encountered DLTs and the 
overall safety profile of BGB -290, the MTD of BGB -290 was determined to be 80 mg PO BID (160 
mg/day).  
Ten patients achieved either a CR (n = 2) or PR (n = 8) responses; all responses were observed in 
patients with gynecological cancers, and responses were observed in the lowest dose cohorts (2.5 mg 
BID).  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pamiparib Dose Selection  
Based upon the overall safety, efficacy,  and PK profile of pamiparib , the dose of pamiparib  60 mg 
PO BID was selected using available clinical data from Study BGB -290-AU-002 ( Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
The study determined the MTD of pamiparib  to be 80 mg PO BID (160 mg/day). The dose of 60 mg 
BID was selected for further evaluation based on the following findings : 
 A linear PK profile observed up to 80 mg BID  
 Similar toxicity profiles at 60 mg and 80 mg BID with the following exceptions:  
o Fewer patients at 60 mg BID experienced treatment -related  treatment -emergent 
adverse events ( TEAEs ) of anemia and neutropenia.  
o There was a slightly higher rate of dose interruptions at 80 mg vs 60 mg BID for 
anemia and nausea.  
 Responses were observed across the dose range evaluated .

furthermore be able to overcome resistance in GBM s with unmethylated MGMT  promoter.  
Pamiparib is a promising PARP inhibitor to study in GBM  as it is a potent and selective inhibitor of 
PARP1 and PARP2, exhibits excellent DNA -trappi[INVESTIGATOR_762668]. In the cl inic, pamiparib  has shown  favorable PK properties , has been 
well-tolerated  and achieved maximum pharmacodynamic target modulation in PBMCs at a dose 
level well below the regimen for this study (10 mg versus 60 mg BID). PK modeling predict s that 
the [ADDRESS_1045133] that maximizing PARP inhibition  with lower doses 
of TMZ to induce DNA damage may provide anti tumor  activity with an acceptab le safety profile. 
For th ese reason, the regimens of this study will try to  maximize brain penetrance and PARP 
inhibition in tumor tissue by [CONTACT_762709] . In 
summary , pamiparib  is an excellent candidate to de termine the effects of combining PARP inhibition 
with RT and/or TMZ in this unmet medical need.   
1.5. Risk -Benefit Assessment  
Pamiparib  has been studied in nonclinical toxicity and Phase [ADDRESS_1045134] partial overlap with the safety profile of RT 
and/or TMZ. Therefore, patient s of this study may experience AEs typi[INVESTIGATOR_762669] a higher frequency and/or severity.  In addition, patient s may encounter AEs that are uniquely 
caused by [CONTACT_338521](s). Given the dire prognosis of GBM  patients and the limited 
treatment options, the risk of combining pamiparib  with RT and/or TMZ appears acceptable in the 
context of a Phase 1 study with close monitoring through  AE reporting , recording  of vital signs and 
ECGs, clinical laboratory testing and tumor assessments.  As outlined in Sections 1.3 and 1.4, 
scientific rationale and supportive data are strong for combining PARP inhibitors with RT and/or 
TMZ in GBM . This warrants evaluation of these combinations in GBM  patients, as the overall 
risk-benefit assessment appears favorable.  
1.6. Study Conduct  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol approved by [CONTACT_1636] (IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) and regulatory authorities, and in accordance 
with Go od Clinical Practice (GCP) standards.

explored:  pamiparib  (at the exposure determined  as safe  in Arm A) in combination with 
RT administered for 6 to 7 weeks and increasing doses of TMZ ( Section 4.2.1 ). 
In both Arms A and B, a fter RT is completed, patient s will receive no further  RT.  
Maintenance Treatment  for Arms A and B  
Following completion of RT, at the discretion of the investigator and after discussion with the 
medical monitor, patients in the Arm A escalation  and expansion and patients in Arm B escalation  
phases of t he study may continue to receive pamiparib in combination with TMZ.  TMZ will be given  
at a dose level lower than or equa l to a dose that has been determined to be safe and tolerable in Arm 
C of study . 
In the Arm B expansion phase of the study, maintenance treatment with pamiparib  in combination 
with TMZ  will be mandatory for all patients .  
Dosing for this maintenance treatment should  begin after the [ADDRESS_1045135] period (+ 7 days) to allow 
for recovery from RT treatme nt (please refer to Appendix 1 Table 4 ). 
Arm C: Pamiparib (60 mg BID , administered continuously ) in combination with increasing doses 
of TMZ ( Section  4.2.1 ). TMZ will be  administered on Days 1 to 21 of each 28 -day cycle .  
Approximately 60 patients may be enrolled in  the 3 arms of  the dose escalation phase. The actual 
sample size in this phase will depend on the number of dose escalation c ohorts enrolled per arm.  
4.1.2.  Dose Expansion Phase  (Phase 2)  
Once the safety, tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamic, and preliminary anti tumor  activity ha ve been 
reviewed for the dose escalation cohorts of each of the arms, up to approximately 60 patient s may be 
enrolled in expansion cohort s for each of the 3 arms at a dose level below or equal to the MTD or 
MAD  for that arm . In Arm C, 2 expansion cohort s may be opened , one for unmethylated GBM  and 
one for methylated GBM  (Section 4.3).  
Approximately 60 patients may be enrolled during the dose escalation phase, and in each of the 
4 dose-expansion cohorts totalling 240 patients in the dose expansion  phase,  for an approximate total 
of 300  patients enrolled in the entire study.  
Adverse event s (AEs)  during and after the treatment period with study drug(s) will be followed and 
documented as outlined in Section  8.4 and Section  10. AEs will be graded according to National 
Cancer Institute Common T oxicity Criteria for Adverse Events ( NCI-CTCAE ) v4.03.

 Page 50 of 139 To determine the PK properties of pamiparib , blood samples will be taken at various time points as 
outlined in Section  8.5 and Appendix  1. To determine pharmacodynamic effects of pamiparib , blood 
samples will be obtained coinciding with specific PK time points  as outlined in Section  8.5 and 
Appendix  1. 
Disease status will be assessed using Response Assessment in Neuro -Oncology ( RANO) criteria 
(Appendix  2). Patient s will undergo tumor assessments at screening  and then every 8 weeks , or as 
clinically indicated.  
In Arm B expansion phase of the study, maintenance treatment (pamiparib in combinat ion with 
TMZ) will be mandatory for all patients.  In Arm A expansion phase of the study, continuation of 
treatment (with pamiparib in combination with TMZ) will be at the discretion of the investigator 
after discussion with the Medical Monitor.  
Following completion of RT, all patients in Arms A and B who continue on pamiparib in 
combination with TMZ should follow the schedule of assessments for maintenance treatment 
(Appendix  1 Table  4).  
Patient s in Arms A and B who have completed all study treatments per protocol and do not continue 
on pamiparib  in combination with TMZ  (maintenance)  should have their EOT  visit at the end of the 
Rest Phase, [ADDRESS_1045136] ete the full study treatment ; in 
such a case, they should have the end-of-treatment ( EOT ) visit within [ADDRESS_1045137] regular follow -up for safety, efficacy , and survival as 
outlined in Section  6.6. 
Study procedures and assessments are further detailed in  Section  8. 
4.2. Details of Dose -Escalation Stage  
4.2.1.  Starting Dose  and Dose -Escalation Approach  
Arm A 
RT will be administered QD  5 days/week for 6 to 7 weeks with 1.8 or 2 Gy/fraction for a total  
target  dose of between [ADDRESS_1045138] dose level of TMZ will be lower than or equal to  a dose that  has been det ermined to be safe 
and tolerable in Arm C , and dose escalation will proceed as described for Arm C. The time period of 
TMZ administration may be the same or shorter than that for pamiparib  administration. Similar to 
Arms A and C, alternative regimens may be explored with adjustments of dose and/or schedule as 
outlined for Arms A and  C.  
Arm C 
Since TMZ is given as a DNA -damaging sensitizer for pamiparib  and to simplify TMZ dosing, 
flat-dosing will be used for TMZ. The first dose level of 40 mg QD corresponds to 23 mg/m2 
assuming an average body surface area of 1.73 m2. Subsequent dose levels of 80 mg and 120 mg 
correspond to 46 mg/m2 and 69 mg/m2, respectively. Additional higher dose levels may be explored, 
and the TMZ dose will not be increased by [CONTACT_726] 50% each time. TMZ will be given on Days 1 
to 21 of each 28 -day cycle  based on data and rationale discussed in Sections 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4.  
Following the same rationale for pamiparib  dosing as for Arm s A and B , all patient s will  receive 
pamiparib  of 60 mg PO BID continuously.  If the MTD is exceeded for a combination regimen that is 
considered inadequate for further exploration based on all data available at that time, alternative 
regimens may be explored, such as a lower dose of pamiparib , a lower dose of TMZ, and/or 
alternativ e dosing schedules for either drug.  
Depending on emerging safety data from this and other pamiparib  Phase 1 studies , the pamiparib  
regimen may be switched to QD for one or more of the 3 arms at any time during or after dose 
escalati on. The QD dose of pamip arib may be escalated according to the dose escalation rules in 
Section 4.2.2  of the protocol.  
Once Arm C dose escalation identifies the RP2D for the combination, that combination regimen 
may be applied in Phase 2 Arm A and B patients (see Section 4.3). Additionally, data emerging 
from other ongoing studies with pamiparib  may be used to determine the combination regimen.  
4.2.2.  Rules for Dose Escalation  
Dose escalation in all 3 arms  will occur in accordance with the following modified 3+3 dose 
escalation rules.  
A minimum of  3 patient s will be  initially enrolled per cohort.  
BeiGene [LOCATION_003], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -290-104 23 July 2018  
Protocol Version 2.0   
 
 
 Page 52 of 139  If none of the first 3 evaluable patient s enrolled in a given cohort experience a DLT, 
dose escalation may proceed.  
 If one of the first 3 evaluable patient s enrolled in a given cohort  experiences a DLT, 
additional patient s (for a minimum of  6 evaluable patient s) will be enrolled in that cohort.  
o If less than one -third of evaluable patient s in a given cohort experiences a DLT ( eg, 
DLTs in fewer than  2 of 6 patient s), escalation will proceed to the next higher dose 
level . 
If a DLT is observed in one -third or more of patient s (eg, 2 or more of up to  6 patient s), the MTD 
will have been exceeded , and dose escalation will be stopped.  
1. Additional patient s (for a minimum  of 6 evaluable patient s) will then be assessed for DLTs at 
the preceding dose level (if a minimum of  6 evaluable patient s had not already been assessed at 
that dose level).  
2. If the MTD is exceeded at a given dose level, a lower or  intermediate dose level may be 
assessed for toxicity in the same manner as described above.  
If the MTD is exceeded at a given dose level, the next highest dose level at which less than one -third 
of evaluable patient s in a given cohort experiences a DLT ( eg, DLTs in fewer than  2 of 6 patient s) 
will be declared the MTD.  
If less than one -third of evaluable patient s (eg, DLTs in fewer than  2 of 6 patient s) at the highest 
dose level experience a DLT, this dose level will be declared the MAD.  
Available data rele vant for dose -escalation decisions for pamiparib  (Arm A ) or TMZ (Arms B and 
C), inclu ding AEs, laboratory assessments, and PK analyses  (as available) , will be reviewed by [CONTACT_35041] , PK scientist, Safety Scientist and Biostatistician with input from other members of 
the team as appropriate . On the basis of a  review  of these data and in consultation with the 
investigators, a  determination will be made as to the next ap propriate dose escalation step.  
4.2.3.  Assessment of Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
Dose-limiting toxicitie s will be assessed during the DLT assessment window starting with  the firs t 
day of study treatments  for all cohorts.  The following assessments must be obtained at the end of the 
DLT assessment window: complete physical examination, vital signs and weight, Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status, ECG, hematol ogy, chemistry, 
coagulation, urinalysis, AEs,  and concomitant medications.  
For Arm A, the DLT assessment window will depend on the time  period  of pamiparib  administration  
during RT  and will consist of the time period of combination treatment plus  [ADDRESS_1045139] cycle of 28 days.  
Patient s who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study prior to completing the DLT assessment 
window for reasons other than a DLT will not be considered evaluable for DLT and will be replaced  
if needed to meet patient  number requirement for dose escalation . Patient s who do not  experience a 
DLT and who do not  receive  ≥ 42 Gy of RT (Arms A and B) and  ≥ 70% of scheduled pamiparib  
(Arms  A, B and C ) and TMZ ( Arms B and C) dosing during the DLT assessment window will not be 
considered evaluable  for DLTs and will be replaced  if needed to meet patient  number requirement 
for DLT assessment . 
4.2.4.  Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
A DLT is defined as one of t he following toxicities occurring during the DLT  assessment window 
(as defined for each of the arms and cohorts ; Section 4.2.3 ) and considered by [CONTACT_762710] :  
 Grade 3 non -hematologic, non -hepatic major organ AE, with the following exceptions:  
o Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea that resolves to Grade 1 with optimal medical 
management within  3 days  
o Grade 3 electrolyte disturbances that respond to correction within  3 days  
 Grade  4 neutropenia lasting >  7 days  
 Grade  3 febrile neutropenia  
 Grade  3 thrombocytopenia with clinically significant  bleeding  
 Grade 4 thrombocytopenia lasting  3 days and requiring transfusion, or any decreased platelet count

following exceptions:  
o For patient s with Grade 1 hepatic transaminase levels at baseline, a  hepatic transaminase 
level of  7.5  upper limit of normal ( ULN ) will be considered a DLT.  
4.3. Details of Cohort -Expansion Stage  
Expansion  cohorts  (up to approximately 60 patient s each) may be enrolled at a dose level below or 
equal to the MTD or MAD of pamiparib  (Arm A) or TMZ (Arms B and C) to better characterize 
the safety and tolerability  of pamiparib  in combination with RT, RT and TMZ or TMZ  alone , and to 
make a preliminary determination of the efficacy of these combinations .

6. STUDY PHASES FROM SCREENIN G TO END OF STUDY  
6.1. Screening  
As part of the screening visit, study center personnel will explain to the potential patient  all aspects 
of the study, obtain signed informed consent, and document the informed consent process in the 
patient’s source documents before any study -specific procedures are conducted.  
The signed ICF initiates screening that must occur within 28 days of enrollment  (Day -28 to Day -1). 
Study center personnel will access the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system to obtain a 
screening identification number for the potential patient , which is generated by [CONTACT_12067].   
Required screening assessments, some with shorter screening windows, are listed in Appendix  1. 
Assessments obtained within 14 days of Day 1  (pregna ncy and laboratory assessments: within 7 days

 Page 59 of 139 of Day 1)  do not have to be repeated on Day 1. Results of standard of -care tests or examinations 
performed before obtaining informed consent and within the screening windows may be used and do 
not have to be re peated as long as they meet protocol specifications.  
It is highly  recommended that general screening assessments such as physical examination and 
laboratory assessments should be conducted first to rule out ineligibility based on those grounds 
before more  involved and/or invasive procedures are carried out.  
The investigator must assess the potential patient for eligibility. Screen failures and consent 
withdrawals must  be documented in the patients’ source documents.  
6.2. Enrollment  
After determination of eligibility, the investigator will complete the treatment authorization form and  
supporting documentation and provide them to the sponsor and/or designee for review and 
subsequent approval. No eligibility waivers will be granted.  
6.3. Treatment  
Day [ADDRESS_1045152] day of any study treatment  administration (there is no Day 0 in this 
protocol).  
Details on study treatment are provided in Section 7.1. 
Study procedures of each clinic visit are outlined in Appendix  1. 
On days with PK assessments, study drug should be administered in the clinic in accordance with the 
schedule for the PK samples. Assessments should be obtained before study drug administration 
unless stated otherwise in Appendix  [ADDRESS_1045153] be reviewed and dose modifications, if 
necessary, be made by [CONTACT_762714].  
6.4. Unscheduled Visit  
Unscheduled visits may occur any time as necessary as per investigator decision or patient’s request 
for reasons such as additional assessment or follow -up of AEs. If PD is suspect ed an MRI  should be 
performed  
6.5. Permanent Discontinuation of Study Treatment  
6.5.1.  Reasons for Permanent Discontinuation of Study Treatment  
Patients may permanently discontinue study treatment for any of the following reasons:  
 Disease  progression  
 Adverse  event(s)  
 Death

 Page 60 of 139  Pregnancy  
 Major protocol deviations  
 Patient withdrew  consent for study treatment  
o Patients may voluntarily withdraw consent from study treatment at any time  
 If a patient withdraws consent from the Treatment Phase they should 
continue with all follow -up visits including survival follow -up 
 Start of other anti cancer  therapy  
Other than for treatment completion (Arms A and B) , the reason for discontinuation from treatment 
will be recorded on the electronic case report form ( eCRF ).  Every effort must  be made to encourage 
the patient to complete their EOT  visit and appropriate safety follow -ups. 
6.5.2.  End of Treatment Visit  
Patients in Arms A and B who have completed all study treatments  per protocol and do not continue 
on pamiparib in combination with TMZ will have their EOT  visit at the end of the Rest Phase, 
28 days after RT was completed. Patients continuing on pamiparib in combination with TMZ  
(maintenance)  should follow the schedule of assessments for maintenance treatment 
(Appendix  1 Table  4). 
All other p atients with any of the reasons for discontinuation of study treatment listed above will 
undergo an EOT  visit within [ADDRESS_1045154], a safety follow -up will occur with the safety assessments outlined in 
Appendix  1. If new anti cancer  therapy is inadvertently initiated before this safety follow -up (eg, 
without the knowledge of the study center team), a safety follow -up should be scheduled as soon as 
possible . 
6.6.2.  Efficacy Follow -Up 
Patients who were not discontinued from study treatment due to PD and meet criteria otherwise (eg, 
discontinued for AE and no new anti cancer  therapy) will be followed every 8 weeks (±7  days) until 
BeiGene [LOCATION_003], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -290-[ADDRESS_1045155] the patient or 
patient’s guardian by [CONTACT_69834]’s disease status and survival.  
6.6.3.  Survival Follow -Up 
Patients will be followed for survival  and further anti cancer  therapy information post p rogression via 
phone contact  [CONTACT_762715]  (with the patient’s guardian, if applicable) approximately every [ADDRESS_1045156] should be documented in the 
patient’s source documents. If a patient cannot be contact[CONTACT_75126][INVESTIGATOR_605455], the patient will be 
considered lost to follow -up, and death information should be obtained through a public record 
search if local agencies permit.  
6.7. End of Study  
Premature discontinuation from the study without EOT  and any follow -up visits may occur under the 
following circumstances:  
 Patient withdrew  consent for study participation  
o Patients may voluntarily withdraw consent from the study at any time.  
 Investigator’s  discretion  
 Lost to  follow -up 
o The investigator should show due diligence by [CONTACT_762716], eg, dates of telephone calls or 
registered letters  (Section 6.6.4 ) 
 Death  
 Study termination by  [CONTACT_3211]  
 Other, as per the discretion of the sponsor or health authority

The instructions for drug ordering are in the Pharmacy Binder . The IRT system will also be used for 
drug supply management. The study drug will be dispatched to a study center only after receipt of 
the required documents in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements and the sponsor’s 
procedures. The in vestigator or pharmacist/designated personnel is responsible for maintaining the 
drug supply inventory and acknowledging receipt of all study drug shipments. All study drugs must 
be stored in a secure area with access limited to the investigator and author ized study center 
personnel and under physical conditions that are consistent with study drug specific requirements.  
Pamiparib  must be kept at 15°C  to 30°C  (59°F to 86°F) and protected from light . An accurate study 
drug accountability log must be maintained and kept up to date at all times.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Dosage and Administration  
Pamiparib  [ADDRESS_1045157] 1 hour  before and 2 hours after each pamiparib administration. Water is allowed 
during the fasting period.  
A dose of pamiparib  should be skipped if it is not taken within 2 hours of the scheduled time. An extra 
dose of pamiparib  should not be taken to make up for a missed dose . If vomiting occurs during the 
course of treatment, no re -dosing of the patient  is allowed before the next scheduled dose.  
On days with PK assessments, the morning dose of pamiparib  should be administered in the 
clinic  in accordance with the schedule for PK samples ( Appendix  1).

 Page 63 of 139 7.1.2.  Temozolomide  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Packaging and Labeling  
Capsules of TMZ are available in 20  and 100 mg. Please refer to the package insert for detailed 
information.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Handling and Storage  
Please refer to the package insert fo r detailed information . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Dosage and Administration  
Temozolomide will be administered PO QD, preferably  during the same time frame each day (ie 
always in the morning or always in the evening) . The daily dose and schedule will be determined by 
[CONTACT_762717] o f study as outlined in Section 4.2.[ADDRESS_1045158]. If optimal nausea control cannot be achieved, any 
alternative dosing schedule, such as TMZ administration at night, should be discussed with the 
medical monitor  before implementation.  
For pati ents receiving TMZ (Arms B & C), Pneumocystis jirovecii  pneumonia prophylaxis is 
required as outlined in Section 7.2.2 . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Temozolomide and Pamiparib  Drug -drug Interaction Potential  
Temozolomide is spontaneously hydrolyzed at physiologic pH to the active species, 
5-(3-methyltriazen -1-yl) imidazole -4-carboxamide (MTIC) and to temozolomide acid metabolite. 
MTIC is further hydrolyzed to 5 -amino -imidazole -4-carboxamide (AIC), which is known to be an 
intermediate in purine and nucleic acid biosynthesis, and to methylhydrazine, which is believed to be 
the active alkylating species. Cytochrome P450 enzymes play only a minor role in the metabolism of 
temozolomi de and MTIC (USPI).  
CYP phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_338482]3A was the major CYP isoform responsible for 
pamiparib  metabolism while CYP2C8 contribute to pamiparib  metabol ism to a lesser extent . 
Pamiparib  is a moderate inhibitor for CYP2C9 (IC 50 = 6.48 M) while its IC 50 for other CYP

 Page 64 of 139 isozymes are all greater than 10 M. Pamiparib  is not a time -dependent CYP inhibitor of the 7  major 
CYP isozymes tested (please see the Pamiparib  IB).  
Consequently, the drug -drug interaction potential between pamiparib  and TM Z is believed to be low 
when co administered.  
7.1.3.  Radiation Therapy  
All patients in Arms A and B will receive RT using either standardized  3-dimen sional conformal 
radiotherapy (3DCRT) technique, intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) , volumetric modulated 
arc therapy (VMAT) or other 3D conformal technique  on a linear accelerator delivering a beam 
energy of ≥ 6 MV. R adiation therapy, associa ted 3D radiation therapy planning and 
stabilization /immobilization  procedures will be performed as per local guidelines and taking into 
account local institutional standard of care.  
Patient s will receive radiation therapy [ADDRESS_1045159] -enhancing lesion (and/or surgical cavity) on T1 -
weighted post -contrast MRI and an acceptab le margin, and may include surrounding tissue 
abnormalities as demarcated on T2w or FLAIR MR images.  
Target Volumes  
Recognizing variation in target volume definitions exists, the definition of volumes will be in 
accordance to recognized standard and local  guidelines with appropriate reference to the European 
Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology ( ESTRO )-Advisory Committee on Radiation Oncology 
Practice ( ACROP ) guideline for “Target delineation of Glioblastomas” ( Niyazi e t al, 201 6) and the 
American Society for Radiation Oncology ( ASTRO ) Evidence -Based Clinical Practice Guideline 
“Radiation Therapy for Glioblastoma” ( Cabrera et al, 2016 ). 
North American radiation oncology cooperative groups generally treat patients in 2 phases, with an 
initial phase directed at edema (hyperintense region on T2/FLAIR on MRI) in addition to the 
resection cavity and gross residual tumor (enhancing lesion on T1) followed by a boost directed onl y 
at the resection cavity and gross residual tumor. T2 hyperintense regions are targeted in this 
paradigm because of evidence that T2 hyperintensity sometimes reflects infiltrative and/or low -grade 
tumor. Some institutions, however, utilize a two -phase tre atment paradigm targeting resection cavity 
and gross tumor alone without specifically targeting edema, citing similar patterns of failure with 
this approach. ( Cabrera et al, 2016 ). Institutional standards may con sist of delivery of a simultaneous 
integrated boost (SIB) that targets the T2w/FLAIR hyperintense regions and T1w contrast 
enhancement and resection cavity at the same time.  
BeiGene [LOCATION_003], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -290-104 23 July 2018  
Protocol Version 2.0   
 
 
 Page 65 of 139 The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer ( EORTC ) has adopted  a 
single -phase approach, targeting the enhancing tumor plus cavity with a wide margin throughout the 
entire treatment, without specifically targeting edema. ( Niyazi et al, 201 6). 
The following are recommendations for ta rget volume definitions.  
Gross tumor volume  
The gross tumor volume (GTV) is defined by:  
 The region of enhancement (without oedema) on post -operative CT/ T1 -weighted MRIs 
(if available) or the region of enhan cement (without oedema) on pre -operative 
CT/T1-weighted MRIs if post op imaging is not available (usually contained in the 
above),  
Plus 
 The tumor resection margin (usually contained in the above)  
In some tumors no area of enhancement can be seen and the GTV is defined entirely on the T2  
abnormality.  
For newly diagnosed GBM and in case of complete or subtotal removal, the position of the tumor 
bed can have shifted, and the GTV should take the new position of the abnormalities on the planning 
CT scan and any post -operative imaging into account. Post -opera tive imaging is not mandatory, and 
it is acceptable to define GTV based on preoperative scans and a planning CT, the lat ter ideally with 
IV-contrast.  
Clinical target volume  
The clinical target volume (CTV) is defined as the GTV plus a margin to a ccount for  microscopic 
spread. This will usually be in the order of 2 to 3 cm but should include all areas of persisting 
oedema (T2 weighted area on MRI/hypo dense area on CT), but can be reduced in anatomical 
regions where spread is unlikely (eg,  below the tentoriu m cerebelli) and keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] t he volume within 
the skull.  
The CTV extends to the contralateral hemisphere only when midlin e structures such as the corpus 
callosum and the contralateral hemisphere are invaded by [CONTACT_20150]. The tentorium and meninges should 
be cons idered as anatomical borders and therefore a margin of 3-10 mm is sufficient to encompass 
the microscopic spread at these borders, always keepi [INVESTIGATOR_762671].  
Planning target volume  
The planning target volume (PTV) will p rovide a margin around the CTV to compensate the 
uncertainties of the setup and the delivery. This margin should be based upon known individual 
departmental evaluations. In case it was not investigated the PTV should be defined as CTV plus 
3-5 mm margins t o all directions.  To ensure that surface dose inaccuracies of the treatment planning 
BeiGene [LOCATION_003], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -290-104 23 July 2018  
Protocol Version 2.0   
 
 
 Page 66 of 139 system are avoided, the PTV border should be collapsed to inside the natural barriers by [CONTACT_762718] 
3 mm from the skin surface.  
Additional target volumes and cone downs as and if defined per local standards.  
Organs at Risk  
To minimize radiation exposure , organ(s) at risk, including eyes, optic nerves, optic chiasm, left and 
right cochlea, brain stem , and normal brain should be contoured during treatment planning. Every 
attempt should be made to shield the contoured organs at risk during radiotherapy planning to 
minimize their dose after satisfying planning requirements for the respective volumes. The 
maximum administered doses to the organ at risk must be as follows  (Scottianti et al, 2015 ): 
Organ at Risk  Maximum Dose (Gy)  
Lenses  7 
Optic nerves/Optic chiasma  56 
Cochlea  ≤ 45 (< 34 to contralateral cochlea)  
Brainstem  60 
Retina  < 45 
Lacrimal gland  < 40 
The maximal dose to non -specified normal tissues, such as skin and any uninvolved brain 
hemisphere, is 105% of the prescription dose.  
Compliance Criteria  
Radiation therapy will be given regardless of the administration of pamiparib (Arm A) and 
pamiparib in combination with TMZ  (Arm B) . For example, if administration of pamiparib and /or 
TMZ has been modified or delayed due to toxicity related to study drugs only, RT may continue.  
Interruptions in RT that may be necessitated by [CONTACT_762719], brain edema, or other acute reactions 
are permitted for up to a total of 7 days but the reason for the interruption should be clearly 
documented in the patient chart and CRF. For interruptions of 8 days or greater, a deviation will be 
assigned.  
For additional details, please see the study Radiation Manual.  
7.1.4.  Radiation Therapy Adverse Events  
Toxicities arising during or after the completion of radiation therapy and attributed  to radiation will 
be assessed according to NCI -CTCAE v4.03 criteria.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Acute  
Expected acute radiation -induced toxicities include hair loss, fatigue, and erythema or soreness of 
the scalp. Potential acute toxicities include nausea and vomiting as well as tem porary aggravation of 
brain tumor symptoms such as headaches, seizures, and weakness. Reactions in the ear canals and on

 Page 67 of 139 the ear should be observed and treated symptomatically; these reactions could result in short -term 
hearing impairment.  Dry mouth or alt ered taste have been occasionally reported.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Early Delayed  
Possible early delayed radiation effects include lethargy and transient worsening of existing 
neurological deficits occurring 1 -3 month s after radiotherapy treatment.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Late Delaye d 
Possible late delayed effects of radiotherapy, typi[INVESTIGATOR_11730] >3 months after completion of RT, 
include radiation necrosis, endocrine dysfunction, and radiation -induced neoplasms. In addition, 
neurocognitive deficits, which could lead to mental slowing and behavioral c hange, are possible. 
Permanent hearing impairment and visual damage are rare. Cataracts can be encountered.  
7.1.5.  Dose Hold s and Modifications of Study Treatments  
[IP_ADDRESS].  General Considerations for Modifications of Study Treatments  
AEs should be assessed as best as possible regarding their relatedness to one or more study 
treatment (s). Investigators should discuss potential dose modifications with the medical monitor  
prior to implementation , if feasible . Regardless of discontinuation of one, two or all study 
treatmen t(s), patient s should continue on study with regular follow -up as outlined in Section 6.5.2  
and Section  6.6. 
Patient s who experience a DLT during the DLT assessment window, or  a clinically significant 
Grade  2 toxicity or Grade 3 or 4 toxicity considered related to study treatment after the DLT 
assessment window, may temporarily suspend study treatment. Depending on the toxicity, study 
treatment may resume within 28 days after d iscussion with the medical monitor . 
Dosing of pamiparib  and TMZ can be interrupted for approximately 28 days for medical events that 
are not associated with toxicity related to these study drugs or disease progression.  
Criteria for treatment modifications and suggested guidelines for the management of toxicities 
related to pamiparib  and/or TMZ are summarized below. These general guidelines may be modified 
at the discretion of the investigator based on best clinical judge ment at that time. Any toxicities 
related to pamiparib  and/or TMZ s hould be managed according to standard medical practice.  
Once a dose of pamiparib or TMZ has been reduced, re -escalation is not allowed.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Dose Modification Considerations for Combinations wi th Radiation Therapy  
For the patient  populations of Arms A and B, RT is an important cornerstone of treatment and should 
not be compromised  because of administration of pamiparib  and/or TMZ . Consequently, RT should 
only be modified for AEs determined to be  solely or mostly related to RT as typi[INVESTIGATOR_762650].  
BeiGene [LOCATION_003], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -290-104 23 July 2018  
Protocol Version 2.0   
 
 
 Page 68 of 139 If AEs are encountered that are considered related to pamiparib  and/or TMZ, dosing modifications 
for pamiparib  and/or TMZ should be implemented as outlined in  Table 3 and Table 4. 
If RT is temporarily interrupted for reasons unrelated to pamiparib  and TMZ (if applicable), then treatment 
with pamiparib  and TMZ should continue as scheduled. If RT is permanently interrupted for reasons 
unrelated to pamiparib  and TMZ (if applicable), the investigator may consult the medical monitor on the 
appropriateness of  initiating maintenance treatment with pamiparib  and TMZ.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Dose Modification Guidelines for  Temozolomide  and Pamiparib  
As outlined in Sections 1.2.[ADDRESS_1045160] partial overlap with the safety profile of TMZ . Therefore,  patient s in 
Arms B and C of this study may experience AEs  typi[INVESTIGATOR_762672] a higher frequency 
and/or severity. In addition, patient s may encounter AEs that are uniquely caused by [CONTACT_762720].  
As outlined in Section 1.2.3, TMZ is considered a treatm ent option but not a strongly established standard 
of care for the patient  populations of this study. In the context of this study, the role of TMZ is to sensitize 
GBM  cells to pamiparib  through DNA damage that can be caused by [CONTACT_338527].  Given 
these considerations, the decision to hold study drugs  will always be  made for both pamiparib  and TMZ  
combined . 
Given the favorable safety profile of pamiparib  (Section s 1.3.4  and 1.5), it is reasonable to assume that a 
Grade [ADDRESS_1045161] discontinue 
treatment with pamiparib  and TMZ, if, after treatment is resumed at a lower dose, the toxicity recurs 
with the same or worse  severity. Dose levels for TMZ and pamiparib  are summarized in Table 3.

Note: TMZ will be dose -reduced first  for a maximum of 2 dose reductions. After discussions with the medical monitor,  
pamiparib  may be dose -reduced next for a maximum of 2 dose reductions . Depending on the toxicity that is triggering a second 
TMZ dose reduction, the possibility of a concurr ent pamiparib dose reduction should  be discussed with the medical monitor . 
Once a dose of pamiparib or TMZ has been reduced, re -escalation is not allowed.  
BID = twice daily; QD = once daily; TBD = to be determined  
[ADDRESS_1045162] dose level of TMZ will be 
lower than or equal to a  dose that has been determined to be safe and tolerable in Arm C.  
2  The dose for pamiparib  used in this study is 60 mg BID . A QD schedule may be explored as outlined in Section  4.2.1 . 
TMZ and pamiparib  will be dose-modified  as outlined in Table 4. The hold and discontinue  guidelines 
also apply to pamiparib  (without TMZ) in Arm A.  After a toxicity has adequately resolved, the 
decision in Arm A of resuming  pamiparib  treatment at the same dose level versus dose-reducing 
pamiparib  should be made in discussion with the Medial Monitor.

these medications are listed in Appendix  7, and these should be used cautiously with drug 
concentration monitoring  where appropriate.  
In addition to CYP3A, pamiparib  can also be metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2C8 in human liver microsomes, 
but to a lesser extent. See Appendix  7 for medications that should be used with caution for that 
reason .

combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_762675] (including attribution of AEs 
and serious adverse events [ SAEs ]), clinical laboratory testing, vital signs, ECGs, physical 
examinations, and PK assessments as outlined in Sections 8.2, 8.4, and 8.5, as well as Appendix  1. 
Assessments of efficacy will occur as outlined in Section 8.3 and Appendix  1. 
8.2. Patient  Demographi cs and Other Baseline Characteristics  
8.2.1.  Demog raphics  
Demographic data will include gender, date of birth (or age), and race/ethnicity.  
8.2.2.  Medical History  
Clinically significant medical history findings ( eg, previous diagnoses, diseases or surgeries) started 
before signing the informed consent, and considered relevant for the patient ’s study eligibility will 
be collected and captured, including baseline severity , if ongoing, in the eCRF. Clinically significa nt 
is defined as any events, diagnoses or laboratory values  that require treatment  or follow -up, or the 
presence of signs or symptoms that require medical intervention. Concurrent medical signs and 
symptoms must be documented to establish baseline severiti es. 
For the GBM  history, the date of initial diagnosis and current disease status, staging, sites of disease, 
prior anti cancer  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], dates administered, responses and duration of response to these treatments 
will also be recorded.  
8.2.3.  Other Baseline Chara cteristics  
Information will also be collected regarding p rior medications/significant non -drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 
childbearing potential (Appendix  4) and any other assessments that are done for the purpose of 
eligibility for inclusion into the study. For further details on eligibility assessments, please see  
Section 5 and Appendix  1. 
8.3. Tumor Assessments  
8.3.1.  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)  
Tumor assessments will include all known or suspected disease  sites. The minimum recommended 
MRI sequences include: (i) parameter -matched precontrast and post-contrast  inversion 
recovery -prepared, isotropic 3D T1 -weighted gradient -recalled echo; (ii) axial 2D  T2-weighted turbo 
spin-echo acquired after contrast injection and before post -contrast  3D T1-weighted images to 
control timing of images after contrast administration; (iii) precontr ast, axial 2D T2 -weighted

images. MRIs will be performed at screening (within 14  days of Day 1) and every 8  weeks 
(7 days), unless otherwise specified in Appendix  1. 
Non-contrast cranial MRI may only be used to document disease in those patient s who are allergic to 
contrast.  Tumor assessments should be repeated at the end of treatment visit if more than [ADDRESS_1045181] ed 
(eg, symptomatic deterioration), and at the time of withdrawal from treatment (if not done in the 
previous  4 weeks).  All patient s’ files and radiologic images (in Digital Imaging and Communications 
in Medicine [DICOM] format) must be available for source verification and for central review.  
Assessment of response will be made using the RANO criteria ( Appendix  2). Responses should be 
confirmed  with two assessments at least  [ADDRESS_1045182] T1 and T2 FLAIR images, use of corticosteroid 
dose, and clinical status  per RANO  (Ellingson et al  2015 ).  
Following initial evidence of radiographic progressions and due  to the potential for 
pseudo -progression patients  may, at the discretion of the investigator,  remain on treatment until 
further imaging is performed 4 to 8 weeks  (at the discretion of the investigator) after the initial 
determination of potential progression . 
8.3.2.  Central Independent Radiology Facility (IRF)  
An IRF may evaluate imaging studies and supportive clinical data in a central and independent 
fashion. The IRF wi ll comprise board -certified radiologists who will identify baseline lesions and 
assign post -baseline time point responses. Details regarding IRF member qualification, training, 
methods, procedures, and other issues relevant to IRF will be described in the IRF Charter.  
The IRF will not perform independent clinical evaluations. The IRF may be asked to evaluate 
response status  and may request select clinical data solely to aid in the interpretation of radiographic 
images. All scans should be sent to the IRF wi thin 1 -3 business days of acquisition (as detailed in the 
Study Manual).  
All radiologic  studies acquired at all scheduled time points and any addit ional (unscheduled) 
radiologic  images acquired to evaluate for potential metastatic disease also must be sent  to the IRF.  
Minimal standards for imaging platform and machine settings as well as information regarding 
transfer of scan files to the IRF can be found in the Study Imaging Manual.  
Assessment of response will be made using the RANO criteria as outlined in Appendix  2.

organization’s qualified compliance auditing team, which is an independent function from the study 
team responsible for conduct of the study.  
9.1. Data Coll ection  
Data will be entered into the eCRFs in an electronic data capture ( EDC ) system.  
Data collection on the eCRF must follow the instructions described in the eCRF Completion 
Guidelines. The investigator has ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all clinical 
data entered on the eCRF. The investigator or designee must sign the completed casebooks to attest 
to its accuracy, authenticity, and completeness.  
Data contained in the eCRFs are the sole property of BeiGene and should not be  made available in 
any form to third parties without written permission from BeiGene, except for authorized 
representatives of BeiGene or appropriate regulatory authorities.  
9.2. Data Management/Coding  
All final patient data, both eCRF and external data ( eg, laboratory data), collected according to the 
protocol, will be stored at BeiGene at the end of the study.  
Standard procedures (including following data review guidelines, computerized validation to 
produce queries, and maintenance of an audit file, whic h includes all database modifications) will be 
followed to support accurate data collection. Data will be reviewed for outliers, logic, data 
inconsistencies, and completeness.  
During the course of the study, a study monitor will make study center visits to  review protocol 
compliance, compare eCRFs against individual patient’s medical records, and ensure that the study 
is being conducted according to pertinent regulatory requirements.  
eCRF entries will be verified with source documentation. The review of med ical records will be 
performed in a manner to ensure that patient confidentiality is maintained. Checking the eCRFs for 
completeness, clarity, and cross checking with source documents is required to monitor the progress 
of the study. Direct access to sourc e data is also required for inspections and audits, and will be 
carried out giving due consideration to data protection and medical confidentiality.  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®)

 Page 82 of 139 10. SAFETY MONITORING AND REPORTING  
The investigator is responsible for the monitoring and documentation of events that meet the criteria 
and definition of an AE or SAE as provided in this protocol . 
10.1. Adverse Events  
10.1.1.  Definition and Reporting of an Adve rse Event  
An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study 
drug, whether considered related to study drug or not.  
Examples of an AE include:  
 Worsening of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including an increase in severity, 
frequency, duration, and/or has an association with a significantly worse outcome.   
 New conditions detected or diagnosed after study drug administration even though it may have 
been present before the start of the study.  
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.  
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study drug or a 
concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be reported as an AE or SAE).  
When an AE or SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation 
(eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], l aboratory results and diagnostics reports) relative to the AE or SAE. 
The investigator will then record all relevant information regarding an AE or SAE in the eCRF. 
However, there may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_762677]. In this instance, all patient  identifiers will be blinded on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_762678].   
10.1.2.  Assessment of Severity  
The investigator will make an assessment of severity for each AE and SAE reported d uring the 
study. AEs and SAEs should be assessed and graded based upon the NCI -CTCAE Version 4 .03 or 
higher . 
Toxicities th at are not specified in the NCI -CTCAE will be defined as follows:  
 Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated  
 Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive inter vention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living  
 Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12342]; disabling; limiting self -care activities of daily 
living  
BeiGene [LOCATION_003], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -290-104 23 July 2018  
Protocol Version 2.0   
 
 
 Page 83 of 139  Grade 4: Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention  indicated  
 Grade 5: Death related to AE  
NOTE: The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous.  Severity is a measure of intensity (e g, 
grade of a specific AE, mild [Grade 1], moderate [Grade 2], severe [Grade 3], or life -threatening 
[Grade 4 ]); where as seriousness is classified by [CONTACT_184760].  
Seriousness serves as the guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations from the sponsor to 
applicable regulatory authorities as described in Section 10.2. 
10.1.3.  Assessment of Causality  
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between the study drug and the occurrence of 
each AE or SAE. The investigator will use clinical judg ement  to determine the relationship. 
Alternative causes, such as natural history of the underlying diseases, concomitant therapy, and other 
risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the AE or SAE to the study dru g will be considered and 
investigated. The investigator will also consult the IB and/or Product Information, for marketed 
products, in the determination of his/her assessment.  
There may be situations when an SAE has occurred, and the investigator has minim al information to 
include in the initial report to the sponsor. However, it is very important that the investigator always 
provides assessment of causality for every SAE before  transmission of the SAE report/eCRF to the 
sponsor since the causality assessme nt is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory 
reporting requirements. The investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_16740] -up information, amending the SAE report/eCRF accordingly.  
The causality of each AE should be ass essed and classified by [CONTACT_1694] “related” or “not 
related .” An AE is considered related if there is at least “a reasonable possibility” that the AE may 
have been caused by [CONTACT_5257] ( ie, there are facts, evidence, or arguments to suggest p ossible 
causation , or a causal relationship between the AE and the drug cannot be ruled out ). A number of 
factors should be considered in making this assessment, including:  
 Temporal relationship of the AE to the administration of study treatment/study proc edure  
 Whether an alternative etiology has been identified  
 Mechanism of action of the study drug  
 Biological plausibility  
An AE should be considered ”related ” to study drug if any of the following are met , otherwise the 
event should be assessed as not related : 
 There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible contributing factors 
can be ruled out.  
 There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other factors is unlikely.

 Page 84 of 139  There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship ( eg, the AE occurred within a 
reasonable time after administration of the study drug).  However, the influence of other factors 
may have contributed to the AE ( eg, the patient ’s clinical condition or other concomitant AEs).  
10.1.4.  Follow-Up of Adverse Events  
When treatment is interrupted or permanently discontinued due to an AE or abnormal laboratory 
value the  patient  must be followed at a frequency as medically indicated until resolution or 
stabilization of the event, whichever comes first.  
All patients  will be followed for AEs and SAEs for at least [ADDRESS_1045187] not recovered to CTCAE Grade ≤ [ADDRESS_1045188] for further investigations, including bone marrow analysis and blood 
samp le for cytogenetics. I f myelodysplastic syndrome/ acute myeloid leukemia is diagnosed, the 
event should be reported as an SAE regardless of causality.  
All AEs and SAEs documented at a previous visit/contact [CONTACT_762722]/contacts.  
All AEs and SAEs will be followed until resolution, the condition stabilizes or is considered chronic, 
the AE or SAE is otherwise explained, the patient  is lost to follow -up or the patient  withdraws 
consent. Once resolved, the appro priate AE eCRF page(s) will be updated. The investigator will 
ensure that follow -up includes any supplemental investigations as may be indicated to elucidate the 
nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE. This may include additional laboratory tests or 
investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals.  
The sponsor may request that the investigator perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations to elucidate as fully as poss ible the nature and/or causality of the 
AE or SAE. The investigator is obligated to assist. If a patient  dies during participation in the study 
or during a recognized follow -up period, the sponsor will be provided with a copy of any 
postmortem findings, in cluding histopathology.  
New or updated information will be recorded on the originally completed SAE report, with all 
changes signed and dated by [CONTACT_093]. The updated SAE report should be resent to the 
sponsor within the time frames outlined in Section  10.5.[ADDRESS_1045189] Abnormalities  
Abnormal laboratory findings (eg, chemistry, hematology, coagulation) or other abnormal 
assessments (E CGs, X -rays, vital signs) that are judged by [CONTACT_762723]. This includes clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or 
other abnormal assessments that are present at baseline and signif icantly worsen during the study.   
The definition of clinically significant is left to the judg ement  of the investigator; in general, these 
BeiGene [LOCATION_003], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -290-[ADDRESS_1045190] medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
 Resu lts in death . 
 Is life -threatening . 
NOTE: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an AE in which the 
patient  was at risk of death at the time of the AE. It does not refer to an AE, which 
hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
 Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
NOTE: In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_762679] (usually involving at 
least an overnight stay) to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22771]/or treatment that 
would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications 
that occu r during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084]. If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_97193], the AE is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” 
occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.  
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_336805] a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an SAE.  
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16739]/convenience considerations is not considered an SAE.  
o Scheduled therapy for the target disease of the study, in cluding admissions for transfusion 
support or convenience, is not considered an SAE.  
 Results in disability/incapacity.  
NOTE: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions. This definition is not  intended to include experiences of relatively minor 
medical significance, such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma ( eg, sprained ankle), which may interfere or prevent everyday life 
functions, but do not  constitute a substantial disruption.  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 Is considered a significant medical AE by [CONTACT_397796] ( eg, 
may jeopardize the patient  or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above).   
BeiGene [LOCATION_003], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -290-[ADDRESS_1045191] questions:  
 How are you feeling?  
 Have you had any medical problems since your last visit?  
 Have you taken any new medicines since your last visit?  
10.4. Specific Instructions for Recording Adverse Events  and Serious Adverse Events  
10.4.1.  Disease Progression  
Disease progression and death due to disease progression, which is expected in this study population 
and measured as an efficacy endpoint, should not be reported as an event term.  Instead, the 
symptoms, signs  or clinical sequelae that result from disease progression should be reported as the 
events.  
For instance, a patient presents with pleural effusion resulting from disease progression of metastasis 
to lungs. The event term should be reported as “pleural ef fusion” instead of disease progression. If a 
patient experienced a fatal multi -organ failure due to disease progression, the term “multi -organ 
failure” should be reported as the SAE with death as outcome instead of reporting “fatal disease 
progression” or “death due to disease progression”.  
10.4.2.  Death  
Death is an outcome and not usually considered an AE. If the only information available is death and 
the cause of death is unknown, then the death is reported as an event, eg “death”, “death of unknow n 
cause”, or “death unexplained”.

 Page 88 of 139 The investigato r, or responsible person according to local requirements, will comply with the 
applicable local regulatory requirements related to the reporting of SAEs to regulatory authorities 
and the IRB/IEC.  
This protocol is being filed under an Investigational New Dr ug (IND) protocol amendment with the 
[LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ). Once active, a given SAE may qualify as an 
IND safety report if the SAE is both attributable to the study drug and unexpected. In this case, all 
investigators filed to t he IND (and associated INDs for the same compound) will receive an 
expedited investigator safety report, identical in content to the IND safety report submitted to the 
FDA.  
Expedited investigator saf ety reports are prepared according to the sponsor’s polic y and are 
forwarded to investigators as necessary.  The purpose of the report is to fulfill specific regulatory and 
GCP requirements regarding the product under investigation.  
When a study center receives an initial or follow -up report or other safety infor mation ( eg, revised 
IB) from the sponsor, the responsible person according to local requirements is required to promptly 
notify his/her IRB or IEC.  
Expedited Reporting of Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs)  
BeiGene, as study sponsor, is  responsible for reporting suspected, unexpected, serious adverse 
reactions involving the study drug to all regulatory authorities and participating investigators in 
accordance with International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Guidelines and/or local regu latory 
requirements, as applicable. In addition, BeiGene or authorized designee will be responsible for the 
submission of safety letters to central independent ECs (IECs).  
The sponsor (or authorized designee) will notify investigators of all reportable SAEs. This 
notification will be in the form of an expedited safety report. Upon receiving such notices, the 
investigator must review and retain the notice with other study -related documentation.  
The investigator and IRB/EC will determine whether the inform ed consent requires revision. The 
investigator should also comply with the IRB/EC procedures for reporting any other safety 
information.  
Suspected serious adverse reactions and other significant safety issues reported from the 
investigational product devel opment program will be reported by [CONTACT_456] o r its designated 
representative, either as expedited safety reports and/or in aggregate reports —to the relevant, 
competent health authorities in all concerned countries.  
10.6. Pregnancy Reporting  
If a female patien t or the partner of a male patient  becomes pregnant while receiving study treatment 
or within [ADDRESS_1045196] dose of study drug, a pregnancy report form 
should be completed and expeditiously submitted to the sponsor to facilitate  outcome follow -up. 
Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the sponsor. Any premature 
termination of the pregnancy will be reported.

 Page 89 of 139 While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or 
elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded as an AE or SAE.  
An abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic, or spontaneous should be always reported as an SAE.  
Similarly, any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a patient  exposed to the study drug 
should be recorded and reported as an SAE.   
10.7. Poststudy Adverse Event s 
A poststudy AE or SAE is defined as any AE that occurs outside of the AE/SAE reporting period, as 
defined in Section 10.3.1 . 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former patients . However, if the 
investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a patient  has been discharged 
from the study, and he/she considers the SAE related to the study drug, the investigator will notify 
the sponsor.  
10.8. Expedited Reporting to Health Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators  
The sponsor will promptly assess all SAEs a gainst cumulative study drug experience to identify and 
expeditiously communicate new safety findings to regulatory authorities, investigators, IRBs and 
IECs based on applicable legislation.  
To determine the reporting requirements for individual SAEs, the  sponsor will assess the 
expectedness of the SAEs using the Pamiparib IB.

Details of the statistical analyses will be included in a separate statistical analysis plan (SAP) . 
11.1. Primary, Secondary and Exploratory Study Endpoints  
Please refer to  Section  [ADDRESS_1045198] ( eg ORR ). 
11.2.1.  Analysis Set 
 The Safety Analysis Set includes all patient s who received any study treatment 
(pamiparib , RT, and/or TMZ). The Safety Analysis Set will be used for all efficacy and 
safety analyses.  
 The Efficacy -evaluable Analysis Set includes patient s in the Safety Analysis Set who had 
baseline and at least one post -baseline tumor assessment , unless discontinued  treatment or 
study early  due to clinical progression or death prior to tumor assessment.  
 The DLT -evaluable Analysis Set includes patient s who received ≥ 42 Gy of RT (Arms A 
and B) and ≥  70% of scheduled pamiparib  (Arms  A, B and C ) and TMZ (Arms B and C) 
during the DLT assessment window with sufficient safety assessments . All patient s who 
had a DLT event will be considered DLT -evaluable regardless of study treatment 
intensity .  
 The PK Analysis Set  includes all patient s for whom val id pamiparib  PK parameters can 
be estimated.  
11.2.2.  Patient  Disposition  
The number of patient s enrolled, treated  and discontinued from study drug , as well as  those with  
major protocol deviations will be counted by [INVESTIGATOR_216]. The primary reason for study drug discontinu ation  
will be summarized according to the categories in the eCRF. The end -of-study status (alive, dead, 
withdrew consent , or lost to follow -up) at the data cutoff date will be summarized using the data

 Page 91 of 139 11.2.3.  Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic s and other baseline characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_762724]. Continuous variables include age, weight, vital signs, time since 
initial tumor diagnosis,  categorical variables include sex, age group (<  65 vs. ≥  65 ye ars), race, 
ECOG performance status , prior therapy for GBM , geographic region, and syste mic corticosteroids 
at baseline.  
11.2.4.  Prior and Concomitant Th erapy  
Concomitant medications will be assigned an 11 -digit code using the World Health Organization 
Drug Dictionary  codes. Concomitant medications will be further coded to the appropriate 
Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) code indicating therapeutic cl assification. Prior and 
concomitant medications will be summarized and listed by [CONTACT_762725] (CSR) for this protocol.  Prior medications will be defined as medications that stopped before 
the first dose of study drug.  Concomitant medications will be defined as medications that  1) started 
before first study treatment  and were continuing at the time of first study treatment , or 2) started on 
or after the date of first study treatment up to [ADDRESS_1045199] study treatment . A listing of prior and 
concomitant medications will be included in the CSR . 
11.2.5.  Efficacy Analyses  
Tumor assessment s by [CONTACT_1697] s according to RANO will be used to calculate ORR, modified 
DCR (Arms A and B), DCR (Arm C), PFS, DOR, and CBR , as well as time -point estimate PFS -6m. 
OS and OS at  6 and 12 months ( OS-6m and OS -12m) will be summarized in the efficacy analysis.  
An optional independent read of the MRI s cans may be performed and will be  analyzed in the same 
fashion.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
Phase 1 b 
As described in the protocol objectives, the trial is designed to establish the safety and tolerability of 
pamiparib  in combination with RT and/or TMZ. Evidence of any anti tumor  activity will be 
documented and summarized for the Safety Analysis Set as sec ondary endpoints of the trial.  
Phase 2 ( Arms A and B)  
Modified DCR is the primary efficacy endpoint in Arms A and B. It is defined as the proportion of 
patient s with CR, PR , or SD as the response assess ment at the EOT  visit, as scheduled per protocol. 
Patients with no EOT  tumor assessment, as scheduled per protocol (due to any reason), will be 
considered non -responders for modified DCR. Modified DCR of pamiparib  combination therapy is 
assumed as 60% in the study population. The historical rate in a similar population is estimated as 
40% (Rivera et al 2010 ).  
The null and alternative hypotheses are set as follows:

BGB -290-104 23 July 2018  
Protocol Version 2.0   
 
 
 Page 92 of 139  H0: Modified DCR = 40% 
 Ha: Modified DCR  > 40%  
A binomial exact test will be performed for hypothesis testing in each arm separately in the Safety 
Analysis Set . If the obtained one -sided p -value is < 0.025, it will be concluded that pamiparib  
combination therapy showed a statistically significant increase of modified DCR compared to 
historical control. Therefore, the superiority of pamiparib  combination therapy will be demonstrated 
in this arm.  
Two-sided binomial exact 95% confidence interval (CI) of modified DCR  will be constructed to 
assess the precision of the rate estimate.  
The primary efficacy analysis will be conducted when mature response rate data have been observed, 
which will be determ ined by [CONTACT_456].  
Sensitivity analysis of modified DCR  will be carried out in the Efficacy -evaluable Analysis Set . 
Phase 2 ( Arm C) 
ORR is the primary efficacy endpoint in Arm C. ORR of pamiparib  combination therapy is assumed 
as 25% in the study population. The historical rate in a similar population is estimated as 10%  (Chen 
et al 2013 ).  
The null and alternative hypotheses are set as follows:  
 H0: ORR  = 10% 
 Ha: ORR  > 10%  
A binomial exact test will be performed within each expansion cohort of Arm C similarly to that 
described for Arms A and B.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the secondary efficacy analysis.   
DCR is de fined as the proportion of patient s with best overall response (BOR) of CR, PR , or SD. 
BOR is defined as the best response recorded from the start of study treatment until data cut off or 
start of new anti cancer  therapy.  
CBR is defined as the proportion of patient s with BOR of CR, PR , or durable SD (SD  ≥24 weeks).  
Exact 95% CIs will be calculated for the rate variables: ORR  for patients with measurable disease at 
baseline , DCR , and CBR in the Safety Analysis Set . 
PFS is defined as the time from the date of first study treatment to disease progression or death, 
whichever occurs first.  
PFS censoring rule will follow FDA Guidance for Industry, Clinical Trial Endpoints for Approval of 
Cancer Drugs and Biologics (2007) . Patient s who have a clinical determination of progression 
should undergo an MRI, if possible, to correlate radiographic findings with the clinical findings.  
BeiGene [LOCATION_003], Inc.  CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -290-[ADDRESS_1045200] study treatment  to death  of any cause . 
Time -to-event variables PFS, DOR , and OS will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method in the 
Safety Analysis Set . Kaplan -Meier  estimates of PFS, DOR , and OS will be plotted over time.  
Median PFS, DOR , and OS  for each arm will be presented  (if possible to estimate) , along with their 
2-sided 95% CIs using generalized Brookmeyer and Crowley method. The PFS -6m, OS-6m, and 
OS-12m, defined as the percentages of patient s in the analysis population who remain alive and 
progression -free at  6 month s (or alive at 6 or 12  months for OS -6m and OS -12m), will be estimated 
using K aplan -Meier  method along with the corresponding 95% CI constructed using Greenwood’s 
formula.  OS will be assessed by 6-month  intervals until the last patient enrolled on the study had 
died. 
Selected efficacy endpoints will be s ummarized in the Efficacy -evaluable Analysis Set as sensitivity 
analysis.  
In Phase 2, modified DCR (in Arms A and B) and ORR (in Arm C) will be summarized in the 
specified subgroups: sex, age group (<  65 vs. ≥  65), race, ECOG  performance status  (0 vs. ≥  1), prior 
surgery status, baseline corticosteroid use, mutations , and geographic region.  In addition, ORR (in 
Arm C) will be summarized by [CONTACT_192555].  
11.2.6.  Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Population PK analysis may be carried out to include plasma concentrations f rom this trial in an 
existing model. PK parameters such as minimum observed plasma concentration ( Cmin) will be 
summarized, and additional PK parameters such as apparent clearance of the drug from plasma 
(CL/F) and area under the plasma concentration -time curve from zero to [ADDRESS_1045201] -dose 
(AUC 0-24) may be derived from the population PK analysis if supported by [CONTACT_33653].  
Exposure -response (efficacy or safety endpoints) analysis may be carried out if supported by [CONTACT_33653].  
The results of the population PK and exp osure -response analyses may be reported separately from 
the CSR . Details of the PK analyses will be provided in a separate SAP.

Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_762694] v4.03 . Laboratory 
values, vital  signs , physical exam ination s and ECG findings will also be used in determining the 
safety  of the study treatment . 
11.3.1.  Extent of Exposure  
Extent of exposure to each study treatment will be summarized in each  arm descriptively as the 
number of cycles received (number and percentage of patient s) in Arm C , duration of exposure 
(days), cumulative total dose received per patient  (mg for pamiparib  and TMZ  and Gy for RT), dose 
intensity (mg/day for pamiparib  and TMZ ) and relative dose intensity.  
The number (percentage) of patient s requiring dose reductions, dose holds , and permanent drug 
discontinuation due to AEs will be summarized by [INVESTIGATOR_216]. Frequency of dose reductions and study drug 
withholding  will be summarized by [CONTACT_10611].  
Patient  data listings will be provided for all dosing records and for calculated summary statistics.  
11.3.2.  Dose -limiting Toxicity  
Dose -limiting toxicit ies in the DLT evaluation period will be summarized descriptively for each dose 
level in the DLT -evaluable p opulation.  
11.3.3.  Adverse Events  
Adverse Events will be coded using MedDRA Version 18.1 or higher and graded using NCI -CTCAE  
Version 4.03 or higher.  A treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE that had an 
onset da te on or after first study treatment or was worsening in severity from baseline (pretreatment) 
up to [ADDRESS_1045202].  All TEAEs will be included in summary tables  and in patient  data 
listings.  
The incidence of TEAEs will be reported as the number (percentage) of patient s with TEAEs by 
[CONTACT_9313] ( SOC ) and preferred term ( PT). A patient  will be counted only once by [CONTACT_605492]-CTCAE Version 4.03 or higher  within an SOC and PT, even if the 
patient  experienced more than  one TEAE within a specific SOC and PT.  The number (percentage) of 
patient s with TEAEs will also be summarized by [CONTACT_29978] . Treatment -
related AEs include those events considered by [CONTACT_762726]. Serious AEs, deaths, TEAE of Grade  3, related

delay will be summarized.  
11.3.4.  Laboratory Analyses  
Clinical laboratory ( eg, hematology and  chemistry) values will be evaluated as specified in the SAP 
and collected in the EDC system. Collected values may be a subset of all the values obtained in the 
requested sampling, eg, a complete blood count with differential may be requested for the evaluation 
of neutrophils only. Analyzed laboratory values will be flagged and identified as those outside 
(above or below) the normal range.  
Laboratory parameters that are graded in  NCI-CTCAE Version 4.03 will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_12134]-CTCAE grade. Shift tables will be provided as appropriate.  
11.3.5.  Physical Examinations  
Physical examination results collected in association with an AE will be listed and summarized.  
11.3.6.  Vital Signs   
Specific vital signs, eg, blood pressure and temperature, will be summarized and listed. The change 
from baseline will also be presented.  
11.3.7.  Electrocardiogram  
Electrocardiogram assessments will be performed as outlined in Appendix  1. The percentage o f 
patients with abnormal and clinically significant ECG findin gs will be presented.  
11.4. Sample Size Consideration  
Approximately 300 patient s (60 in Phase 1 b and 240 in Phase 2 ) may be enrolled. The actual sample 
size in Phase 1 b will depend on the number of cohorts enrolled per arm.  
In Phase 2 , the sample size calculation is carried out using modified DCR in Arms A and B and ORR 
in each expansion cohort of Arm C.  
 Assuming modified DCR of 60% in Arms A and B vs. 40% in historical control, the power 
of a binomial exact test is 0.874 in each arm when n  = 60. 
 Assuming ORR of 25% in Arm C vs. 1 0% in historical control, the power of a binomial 
exact test is 0.847 when n  = [ADDRESS_1045203] 95% CI of modified DCR is (4 6.5%, 72.4%) in 
Arms A and B and the binomial exact 95% CI of ORR is (14.7%, 37.9%) in each expansion cohort 
of Arm C.

 Page 102 of 139 authorities of the suspension or termination of the study and the reason(s) for the action. If required 
by [CONTACT_5279], the investigator must inform the IEC/IRB promptly and provide the reason 
for the suspension or termination.  
If the study is prematurely discontinued, all study data must be returned to the sponsor. In addition, 
arrangements will be made for all unused study drug(s) in accordance with the applicable sponsor 
procedures for the st udy. 
Financial compensation to investigators and/or institutions will be in accordance with the agreement 
established between the investigator and the sponsor.  
12.5. Records Retention and Study Files  
12.5.1.  Study Files and Retention of Records  
The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the study to 
be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified. These documents should be 
classified into at least the following  2 categories: (1) investigator’s study file, a nd (2) patient  clinical 
source documents.  
The investigator’s study file will contain the protocol/amendments, eCRF and query forms, 
IRB/IEC, and governmental approval with correspondence, ICF, drug records, staff curriculum vitae 
and authorization forms, a nd other appropriate documents and correspondence.  
Patient  clinical source documents (usually defined by [CONTACT_5280]/safety parameters independent of the eCRFs) would include (although not be limited to) the 
following: patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic records, physician’s and nurse’s notes, appointment book, original 
laboratory reports, ECG, electroencephalogram, X -ray, pathology and special assessment reports, 
consultant letters, screening and enrollment log, etc.  
Following closure  of the study, the investigator must maintain all study records in a safe and secure 
location. The records must be maintained to allow easy and timely retrieval, when needed ( eg, audit 
or inspection), and, whenever feasible, to allow any subsequent review of data in conjunction with 
assessment of the facility, supporting systems, and personnel.  
The sponsor will info rm the investigator of the time  period for retaining these records to comply with 
all applicable regulatory requirements. The minimum retention  time will meet the strictest standard 
applicable to that study center for the study, as dictated by [CONTACT_762732], or the sponsor’s standards/procedures; otherwise, the retention period will 
default to [ADDRESS_1045207] notify the sponsor of any changes in the archival arrangements, including, but 
not limited to, the following: archiving at an off -site facility  and transfer of ownership of , or 
responsibility for,  the records in the event the inves tigator leaves the study center.  
If the investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the study site for any or all of the 
documents , arrangements must be made between the investigator and BeiGene to store these in

12.5.2.  Provision of Study Results and Information to Investigator  
When the CSR  is completed, the spon sor will provide the major findings of the study to the 
investigator.  
12.6. Information Disclosure and Inventions  
All information provided by [CONTACT_762733] (other than a patient ’s medical records) is the sole property of the sponsor.  
All rights, title, and interests in any inventions, know -how or other intellectual or industrial property 
rights that are conceived or reduced to practice  by [CONTACT_762734] a result of the study are the sole property of the sponsor, and are hereby [CONTACT_69886].  
If a written contract for the conduct of the study that includes ownership provisions inconsistent  with 
this statement is executed between the sponsor and the study center, that contract’s ownership 
provisions shall apply rather than this statement.  
All information provided by [CONTACT_762735] (other than a patient ’s medical records) will be kept confidential by [CONTACT_762736]. This information and data will not be used by [CONTACT_762737] . 
These restrictions do not apply to:  
 Information which becomes publicly available through no fault of the investigator or 
study center  personnel.  
 Information which is necessary to dis close in confidence to an IEC/IRB solely for  
the evaluation of the  study.  
 Information which is necessary to disclose in order to provide appropriate medical care to 
a patient . 
 Study results that may be published as described in Section  12.3.[ADDRESS_1045209]’s provisions shall apply rather than this statement.  
12.7. Joint Investigator/Sponsor Responsibilities  
12.7.1.  Access to Information for Monitoring  
In accordance with ICH GCP guidelines, the study monitor must have direct access to the 
investigator’s source documentation in order to verify the data recorded in the eCRFs f or 
consistency.  
The monitor is responsible for routine review of the CRFs at regular intervals throughout the study to 
verify adherence to the protocol and the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of the data being 
entered on them. The monitor should ha ve access to any patient  records needed to verify the entries 
on the eCRFs. The investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems 
detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved.  
12.7.2.  Access to Information for Auditing  or Inspections  
Representatives of regulatory authorities or of BeiGene may conduct inspections or audits any time 
during or after completion of this clinical study. If the investigator is notified of an inspection by a 
regulatory authority the investigato r agrees to notify the sponsor or its designee immediately. The 
investigator agrees to provide to representatives of a regulatory agency or BeiGene access to records, 
facilities, and personnel for the effective conduct of any inspection or audit.

a Screening must occur within [ADDRESS_1045225] a narrower screening window as shown in the table.  Assessments obtained within 14 days of 
Day 1 (pregnancy and laborator y assessments: within 7 days) do not have to be repeated on Day 1.  It is highly recommended that general screening assessments such 
as physical examination and laboratory assessments should be conducted first to rule out ineligibility  based on those ground s before more involved and/or invasive 
procedures are carried out.  
b RT will be administered once daily  (QD)  5 days/week for 6 to 7 weeks with 1.8 or 2 Gy/fraction for a total target dose of between 58 Gy and 64  Gy. If the time 
period of RT extends beyond 6 weeks, a clinic visit on Day 43 will be required (gray italics in table).    
c Day [ADDRESS_1045226] completed all study treatment per protoco l and who do not continue on maintenance  treatment with pamiparib in combination with TMZ, as 
described further below, t he end -of-treatment ( EOT ) visit will occur at the end of the Rest Phase, 28 days after RT was completed.  Patient s who discontinued study 
treatment for any other reason outlined in Section 6.5.1  will undergo the EOT  visit within 7 days after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_762684] t reatments. A visit should be scheduled as 
soon as possible , but the EOT  visit may occur later after discussion with the medical monitor  for specific circumstances, such as prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. The visit at 
which MRI showed progressi ve disease  (PD)  may be used as the EOT  visit provided that all required assessments were performed. MRI does not have to be repeated 
if it was pe rformed within [ADDRESS_1045227]-completion of RT (+7 days ) to 
allow for recovery from RT treatment.  Patients should follow the Schedule of Assessme nts for the maintenance treatment ( Appendix 1 Table 4 ).

be considered the re -screening visit provided all assessments were completed. Patients ’ must continue to meet eligibility criteria prior to commencing maintenance 
treatmen t. 
b The end -of-treatment (EOT) visit will occur within 7 days after a patient discontinued study treatment for any of the reasons outlined i n Section 6.5.1 . A visit should be 
scheduled as soon as possible , but the EOT visit may occur later after discussion with the medical monitor for specific circumstances, such as prolonged 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Th e visit at which MRI showed progressive disease (PD) may be used as the EOT visit provided that all required assessments were  performed. MRI 
does not have to be repeated if it was performed within [ADDRESS_1045251] to be 
repeated if it was performed within 14 days of the EOT visit.  
c Safety Follow -up: all patients who discontinue study treatment will have a safety follow -up visit approximately 30 (±7)  days after the last day of s tudy treatment to 
collect AEs and SAEs that may have occurred after the patient discontinued from the study treatment.  
 Long -Term Follow -up: Patients who were not discontinued from study treatment due to PD and meet criteria otherwise (eg, discontinued for  AE and no new anticancer 
therapy) will be followed every 8 weeks (±7  days) until disease progression, administrative issues, start of other anticancer therapy or any other reason listed in 
Section  6.7, whichever occurs first.  
 Patients will be followed for survival and further anticancer therapy information post progression via phone contact (with th e patient’s guardian, if applicable) 
approximately  every 12 weeks.  
d A limited physical examination should include neurological status, and additionally be directed at the evaluation of symptoms  or specific safety issues. Changes from 
the E OT visit of the escalat ion portion should be recorded.  New or worsened abnormalities should be recorded as AEs if appropriate.  
e Vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure; pulse rate; and oral, temporal , or tympanic temperature) will be taken before study treatment during the treatment 
period.  
f Hema tology includes hemoglobin, platelet count, white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil count, and lymphocyte count.  For maintenance cycle 2 and beyond 
hematology is only required on Days 1 and 15 however should be measured more frequently based on the patien t’s blood counts and need for additional monitoring.  
Per the Temodar prescribing information , hematology also needs to be completed on Day [ADDRESS_1045252] dose.  
g Chemistry include s albumin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), blood urea nitrogen (BUN),  chloride, 
creatinine, glucose, lact ic acid  dehydrogenase (LDH), phosphate, potassium, sodium, total bilirubin, and total protein . 
h Urinalysis will be assessed using urine dipstick. Urine microscopy will be performed if any assessment on the urine dipstick is abnormal. Urinalysis includes glucose, 
protein, ketones, bilirubin, blood, red blood cells, and white blood cells.  
i For wome n of childbearing potential, a serum pregnancy test must be performed during re -screening ≤ [ADDRESS_1045253] is required.  
j The scheduling of MRIs during the maintenance phase should continue on an 8 week schedule ; ie, the first MRI during maintenance should be completed [ADDRESS_1045254] period following completion of RT . Tumors will be assessed by [CONTACT_762745] 8 weeks (±  7 days) . Patients 
without PD at the EOT visit must be followed with MRIs every 8 weeks (±  7 days) during the Follow -up Phase. The E OT MRI shou ld only be collected i f an MRI has 
not been performed within [ADDRESS_1045255] 1 hour before and 2 hours after each pamiparib 
administration. Water is allowed during the fasting period. A dose of pamiparib should be skipped if it is not taken within 2 hours of the scheduled time. An extra dose  of 
pamiparib should not be taken to make up for a missed dose. If vomiting occurs during the course of treatment, no re -dosing of the patient is allowed before the next scheduled 
dose.  
l All patients will receive temozolomide (TMZ) at a dose level lower than or equal to  a dose that has been determined to be safe and tolerable in Arm C of study . 
m Adverse events and laboratory safety measurements will be recorded at each study visit, graded per NCI -CTCAE Version 4.[ADDRESS_1045256] include the dose, regimen, route, indication, and start and stop dates of use of the prior and concomitant 
medications.  
o If the patient undergoes repeat resection on completion of the maintenance phase, tumor tissue may be c ollected for the assessment of marker s related to GBM, TMZ 
treatment, and PARP inhibitors .

Page 128 of 139 APPENDIX  2. RESPONSE ASSESSMENT FOR NEURO -ONCOLOGY (RANO) 
 CRITERIA FOR TIME POI NT RESPONSES  
1. Definiti ons and Baseline Classification  
Baseline is defined as the screening assessment performed immediately prior to commencement of 
any study treatment.  
The following definitions are to be applied:  
Measurable Lesions  
Measurable lesions are enhancing lesions that can be measured bi -dimensionally with clea rly defined 
margins by [CONTACT_20420] ( CT) or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ). 
Minimal Diameter:  
Lesions must have two perpendicular diameters of at least [ADDRESS_1045257], 5 mm apart with 0 -mm s kip. 
Note: After baseline, target lesions that become smaller than the minimum requirement for 
measurement or become no longer amenable to bi -dimensional measurement are to be recorded at 
the default value of 5 mm for each diameter below 5 mm until the les ion disappears (recorded as 
0  0 mm).  
Multicentric Lesions  
Multicentric lesions are lesions where there is normal intervening brain tissue between the two (or 
more) lesions. If there is no normal brain tissue between these two (or more) lesions, they wil l be 
considered the same lesion.  
For multicentric lesions that are discrete foci of enhancement, no more than [ADDRESS_1045258] of the diameters (SPD) measured.  
Non-Measurable Lesions  
All other lesions that do not meet the criteria for measurable disease as defined, as well as all non -
enhancing and other truly non -measurable lesions, are considered non -measurable.  
A non -measurable lesion will include foci of enhancement that are less than the spe cified smallest 
diameter, non -enhancing lesions seen on T2 -weighted or fluid attenuated inversion recovery 
(FLAIR ) images, hemorrhagic or predominantly cystic or necrotic lesions, and leptomeningeal 
tumor. Hemorrhagic lesions often have intrinsic T1 -weight ed hyperintensity that could be 
BeiGene [LOCATION_003], Inc.        CONFIDENTIAL  
BGB -290-[ADDRESS_1045259] be 
examined to exclude baseline or interval sub -acute hemorrhage.  
At baseline,  lesions are to be identified as follows:  
a. Target lesions : Up to [ADDRESS_1045260] 10  10 mm, representative of the 
patient’s disease  
 
b. Non-target lesions:  All other lesions, including all non -measurable lesions and any measurable 
lesions not chosen as Target lesions  
2. Post -Treatment Ev aluation  
At each evaluation, a time point response is to be determined for target lesions, non -target lesions, 
and new lesion. The RANO criteria and associated conventions for each post -treatment time point 
assessment are provided in Appendix Table 5 . Overall time point response is derived as described in  
Appendix Table 6 . 
Unless progression is observed, overall response can only be determined when all lesions are 
assessed.   
3. Confirmation  
Confirmation assessments for overall time point responses of complete response ( CR) and partial 
response ( PR) are to be performed no less than [ADDRESS_1045261] response, incorporating confirmation requirements, will be derived from the series of time point 
responses and need not be considered when assigning response at each time point.

Prerequisite  
If the daily dose of glucocorticoids is  not the same for each of the 5 days preceding the current MRI, 
target or non -target lesion TPR is to be designated NE (not evaluable). To avoid this designation, 
MRI should be delayed until these glucocorticoid criteria can be met, and every effort should be 
made to ensure the MRI is performed on schedule while meeting these criteria.

 POTENTIAL  
Contraception guidelines  
The Clinical Trials Facilitation Group (CTFG) recommendations related to contraception and 
pregnancy testing in clinical trials include the use of highly effective forms of birth control. These 
methods include the following:  
 Combined (estrogen and progesto gen containing) hormonal contraception associated with the 
inhibition of ovulation  
o Oral, intravaginal or transdermal  
 Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with the inhibition of ovulation  
o Oral, injectable, implantable  
 An intrauterine device (IUD)  
 Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)  
 Bilateral tubal occlusion  
 Vasectomized partner  
 Sexual abstinence (defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period 
of exposure associated with the study treatment). Total sexual abstinence should only be used 
as a contraceptive method if it is in line with the patient s’ usual and preferred lifestyle. Periodic 
abstinence ( eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), declaration of 
abstinence for the duration of exposure to study drug, and withdrawal are not acceptable 
methods of contraception.  
Of note, barrier contraception (including male and female condoms with or without spermicide) is 
not considered a highly effective method of contraception and if used, this  method must be used in 
combination with another acceptable method listed above.  
Definition of childbearing potential  
Childbearing potential is defined as being physiologically capable of becoming pregnant. No 
childbearing potential is defined as one or bo th of the following criteria:  
 Surgically sterile (bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy)  
 Post-menopausal, defined as  
o ≥55 years of age with no spontaneous menses for ≥12 months OR  
o <55 years of age with no spontaneous menses for ≥[ADDRESS_1045262]-menopausal follicle -stimulating (FSH) concentration >30 IU/mL

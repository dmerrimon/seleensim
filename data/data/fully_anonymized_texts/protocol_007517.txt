 Protocol #: 19-[ADDRESS_201987] Title:  A Health System Wide Evaluation of Mandated Use and Clinical Decision Support 
Tools to Improve PDMP Utilization and Patient Outcomes     
Principal Investigator:   [INVESTIGATOR_172280], DO  
Version Date: 3 December  2021         
 I. Hypotheses and Specific Aims :  
Prior  research by [CONTACT_172326] d epartment (ED) prescribers are les s 
likely to prescribe an opi[INVESTIGATOR_172281] s at high -risk of overdose or misuse  when they  
consult the Colorado Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) . Despit e extensive work to 
reduce work flow and accessibility barriers to use of the PDMP, the majority of providers still do 
not use the PDMP when making prescription decisions.  Clinical decisi on support (CDS) that is 
embedded  in the Electronic Health  Record (E HR) has promise as a tool to increase PDMP use, 
advance  presentation of important PDMP data to providers and  improve opi[INVESTIGATOR_172282].   
 This cluster -randomized  study is designed to determine if : 
• CDS tools that  deliver focused, timely clinical information to prescribers can improve use of 
the PDMP   
• The u se of focu sed CDS tools can decrease high -risk opi[INVESTIGATOR_85414]  
• The u se of focused CDS tools is associated with better patient outcomes:  decreasing high -risk, 
long- term , and aberrant opi[INVESTIGATOR_172283], we will test the hypotheses that:  
1. Use of a focused CDS tool will increase the percentage of high -risk patients who are checked 
in the PDMP in the target populations, compared to those who have not implemented the tool. 
2. Use of a focused CDS tool will decrease the percentage of high -risk patients  who  receive a 
controlled medication prescription in the target populations, compared to those who have not implemented the tool . 
 II. Background and Significance :  
The opi[INVESTIGATOR_172284] a public health emergency that threatens the wellbeing of our communities. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_172285][1] , 11.4 million US citizens suffer from opi[INVESTIGATOR_5422] [2] and opi[INVESTIGATOR_172286]. [3] Opi[INVESTIGATOR_172287] a 
significant cost to the US economy, with an estimated $78.5 billion spent annually. [4]
  
Colorado suffered from 1,010 drug -related deaths in 2017, a 9% increase from the prior year and 
the most ever. [5] Prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_172288] 357 in 2017. [6] In the 2016 -2017 National 
Survey on Drug Use and Health Colorado ranked 7th in number of individuals > 12 years old 
Protocol Template  Page 3 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/[ADDRESS_201988] year 
non-medical opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] 
(5.03%), with more than 300,000 
Coloradans misusing 
prescription pain 
medications. [7] Many 
of those reporting use 
of illegal opi[INVESTIGATOR_172289] r to a shift  
to illegal drugs. He nce, improved prescribing of opi[INVESTIGATOR_172290].  
Ten years ago, the Colorado  PDMP was established in ord er to track controlled medication  
prescribing in an effort to improve patient safety and control misuse and abuse of opi[INVESTIGATOR_172291]. By [CONTACT_172327], a prescriber can identify patients w ith 
prescription histories that  indicate high -risk or inappropri ate use.  Originally, use  of the PDMP 
required  log on, transcription and searching steps on the state web portal which prescribers 
found the  cumberso me and disruptive to their workflow, especially in fast -paced environments 
such as EDs.  Our prior  project  incorporated PDMP access directly into the UCHealth Electronic 
Health Record (EHR), which resulted in increm ental improvements in PDMP utilization  but failed 
to achieve PDMP usage  in a majority of opi[INVESTIGATOR_75155] .   
As a g rowing part of improving the digital environment in EHRs , CDS  is focused on providing the 
right information to right person  in the right format at the rig ht time in the right channel  to 
improve patient care . The overall goal is  facilitate decision -making and  improve delivery of best 
practices. CDS tools provide information and alternatives to clinicians to supplement but not 
replace good clinical judgment . The proposed CDS tools  suggest but neither require  nor prohibit  
any particular course of treatment  and are not designed to gather information on compliance 
with state and federal laws governing opi[INVESTIGATOR_85414] . The final decision is always at the 
providers ’ discretion.  
Given the small progress made by [CONTACT_8246]  “one click” PDMP access into the EHR , a logical 
next step is to investigate if we can  improve PDMP use and patient  outcomes by [CONTACT_172328] d CDS tools for ED, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172292] s. The proposed tool would 
search the PDMP automatically (saving provider time) and then present providers the PDMP information only when the patient is determined to be high risk. This will improve workflow by [CONTACT_172329].  
Our initial studies in incorporating the PDMP into the EHR were carried out in [ADDRESS_201989] ices. This step was described separately in 
Figure 1:  Number of Drug Poisoning Deaths in Colorado by [CONTACT_172330], 2001 -2016*

 study 19 -3063, “Prescriber preferences in development of Clinical Decision Support tools to 
improve PDMP utilization. ” 
In the current form used by [CONTACT_172331] , PDMP data is av ailable as a list of prescriptions , but is 
generally presented in UCHealth system in the form of a NarxCare report .  This report includes a 
proprie tary calculated risk score that  incorporates aspects of a patient’s controlled medication 
use history and has been shown to  correlate with overdose risk.[8] Individual risk scores are 
provided for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], stimulants, and sedatives (controlled su bstances tracked by [CONTACT_172332]).  
These scores will be used to drive CDS tool activations .   
 
III. Preliminary Studies/Progress Report : 
In our prior work at UCHealth EDs, we sought to reduce barriers to PDMP use and investigate the 
effectiveness of improved access to the PDMP and “mandated” consultation of the PDMP prior to signing an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] e -prescription. We determined PDMP usage rates, prescription rates when the 
PDMP is used  (or not) , and patient  outcomes . In the setting  of already decreasing opi[INVESTIGATOR_172293], we found that  one-click PMDP EHR i ntegration  is associated with an increase in the 
frequency of PDMP searches for ED patients who are prescribed an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]. Unfortunately , still 
only a minority of ED patients receiving an opi[INVESTIGATOR_172294] “best practice alert”. “Mandated” use for our  studies , is a 
relatively loose term.  In order to not disrupt clinical workflows, information is presented as a 
“best practice alert”  (BPA)  in a pop -up window but providers can act on  or by[CONTACT_172333]. This 
design is required in order to ensure the tool does not impede patient care or the exercise of clinical judgment . Additionally, use across different ED sites and providers  was highly variable , 
suggesting inconsistent  care and the need for improvement.   
After adjusting for site, provider and the patient’s race/ethnicity and age, the predicted 
probability  that a patient who received an opi[INVESTIGATOR_172295] 0.218 (95% CI: 0.202 – 0.234) under the most stringent “mandatory” use criteria 
in our previous study .  
Notably , there was a significant reduction in the probability that an opi[INVESTIGATOR_172296] (OR: 0.92 [95%CI:0.91- 0.94] for every 
additional prescription). There was no such reduction for patients who were 
not searched (OR: 1.01 [95%CI:1.00-
1.01] for every additional prescription).  
This suggests t hat reviewing the PDMP 
did have an effect on prescribing behaviors for high -risk patients .  
We conclude that providing effective information  on prior controlled 
medication  use and risk  assessment improves patient safety by [CONTACT_172334] -risk prescribing.  
However, given poor compliance with “mandatory” consultation of the PDMP, it is clear that improvements are needed in information presentation to facilitate PDMP use. To address this

IV. Research  Methods  
A. Outcome  Measure(s):   
Primary outcome : 
• Changes in the percentage of high -risk patients (pa tients who are flagged by [CONTACT_8671] S 
logic) who are checked in the PDMP  
Secondary outcomes:  
• Changes in the percentage of high -risk patients (patients who are flagged by [CONTACT_172335]) who receive a controlled medication prescription 
• Overall utilization of the PDMP prior to prescribing for low risk/naïve patients vs . high risk 
patients  
• Percentage of patients who receive a controlled medication prescription who go on to 
long- term or aberrant use of controlled medication  when CDS is used vs. controls   
 B. Description of Population to be Enrolled:   
Two distinct populations will be involved  in this study.   
1. Health care providers  licensed to prescribe opi[INVESTIGATOR_172297]. 
These individuals will use CDS  tools provided in the course of  normal clinical care  and 
have the opportunity for qualitative feedback on tools . We will collect d e-identified data 
on CDS use and prescribin g practices  of providers . There will be no attempts to link 
qualitative responses with measures of prescribing practices, which will be measured system wide  as described elsewhere . Oncology, hospic e/palliative care, and pediatric 
practices will be excluded  
2. Patient s seeking care in the UCHealth system, who may receive an  opi[INVESTIGATOR_16447]. 
The population will be limited to  non-prisoners  12-[ADDRESS_201991] will be included (ages 12 -17 inclusive) due to the inclusion of their health care 
provider. On the advice of pediatric toxicology experts , a cut poi nt of [ADDRESS_201992] offices will not be includ ed in 
rollout of the CDS tools. Outcomes measures from juveniles  will be examined separately 
from adults but  may be included in the overall population if statistically appropriate.   
 C. Study Design and Research Methods    
This will be a 1) cluster -randomized  (by [CONTACT_14603], as identified by a group of providers who 
work in the same department or set of departments within UCHealth ) study  for 
ambulatory/outpatient providers  and 2) a randomized study ( by [CONTACT_48368] ) for emergency 
medicine and inpatient provider s, with four study  arms : 
 
Protocol Template  Page 6 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/11  
 1. Arm 1:  No change in practice  
• Providers are free to access the PDMP when prescribing via the existing integrated 
PDMP button.   
• This control group will enable monitoring of the secular changes in rates of controlled 
medication  prescription  within the UCHealth system . 
• In order to facilitate  analysis of patient outcomes, CDS logic as in group 4 will run 
“silently” in this group such that risks are identified and recorded but not seen by  [CONTACT_172336].  
2. Arm 2:  “Mandatory” use of the PDMP for all opi[INVESTIGATOR_75155].   
• A best practice alert (BPA)  will be triggered and fire when  ordering an  opi[INVESTIGATOR_172298] . The BPA will not appear ( i.e. it will be suppressed) if the provider already 
reviewed the PDMP  with in the encounter. The BPA  is shown in Figure 2 below.   
• Although this condition is termed “mandatory” use, it is not a hard stop. T he provider 
can easily close the window without consulting the PDMP  and the prescription can be 
signed whether the PDMP has been consulted or not.  The BPA will be built to track 
utilization of the BPA vs. by[CONTACT_6476]. Note: This has been deemed too interruptive for 
ambulatory clinics and they will not be included in this arm.   
3. Arm 3:  CDS  for high risk patients  based on PDMP data 
• Based on initial interviews with providers (see 19 -3063) CDS support will be designed 
to be supportive of provider workflows via interruptive alerts (BPAs) for h igh-risk 
patients  only. No alerts will fire for patients without high risk indicators based on data 
in the PDMP or prescription history as shown in Epic.   An example is given below. 
Exact phrasing may be modified during final testing in order to streamline appearance 
of the alert.  
• Again,  BPA will be triggered upon  entry of an opi[INVESTIGATOR_172299] s determined to be at risk for controlled medication 
associated adverse events,  misuse or overd ose, based on logic built to identify high -
risk characteristics . Definition of these risk characteristics is based on CDC guidelines 
and include: NarxCare opi[INVESTIGATOR_172300]  (PDMP based)  indicating 
the patient is in the highest ~5% of the population for controlled medication risk , 
initiating opi[INVESTIGATOR_172301] 100 days , or information in the PDMP or EHR 
indicating overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_172302] -prescribing of a sedative with an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] .   
• One-click access to the PDMP for all patients will be maintained as in other arms.  If 
the provider reviews the PDMP during the encounter before prescribing, the BPA will 
be suppressed.   
Figure 2:  Example BPA used in prior study.  
Protocol Template  Page 7 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/11  
 • As in Group 2, this  is not a truly mandatory check and can be by[CONTACT_92842].  BPA 
messaging was determined based on work with providers to deliver the most useful 
and clear information.  
• The text displayed in the alert will be specific to the patient. BPA logic and phrasing is 
included in Appendix A . 
 
Figure 3: Sample alert.   
 
4. Arm 4:  CDS for high risk patients based on PDMP and/or clinical characteristics    
• The CDS  will fire based on the same characteristics as in Group [ADDRESS_201993] been determined based on work with providers and include  risk factors 
based on prior published work [9; 10] . Factors included are : history of overdose, an 
active mental health  diagnosis, a history of positive tox screen for illicit drugs, an 
active or prior diagnosis of a substance use disorder, or multiple recent ED visits which included administration of an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] . 
• One-click access to the PDMP for all patients will be available  as in other arms. If the 
EHR encounter includes records of a PDMP check, the BPA will be suppressed and not fire.   
• As in Group [ADDRESS_201994] messaging included in and format of the BPA s were  determined based on the 
results of study 19 -3063 and technical feasibility . For high -risk prescribing, each  BPA will 
provide an alert and embedded link to action ( “check the PDMP”) , a reason (“your patient is 
at high risk due to XXX ”) and a link to a website providing more information about the study, 
the logic used to fire the CDS and resources for prescribers such as the CDC Guidelines. No treatment recommendations will be made as the goal of the CDS is to encourage providers to make effective use of exi sting resources to inform their prescribing.  BPAs will be designed to 
track provider use vs. by[CONTACT_6476].   

Protocol Template  Page 8 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/11  
 A series of silent alerts will be used to capture information about patient risks and provider 
PDMP usage  over time . For Arms 2 and 3 as described above, an alert nearly identical to the 
study alert will fire but not be visible to the provider (2nd level in model) . The silent alert will 
have the same PDMP and EHR  criteria but will not filter out patients for whom the provider 
has already checked the PDMP  (suppressed in provider alert) . This will allow tracking of 
provider PDMP behavior change over time  since we will have PDMP use due to BPA and 
PDMP by [CONTACT_172337] . This is important to identify behavior change 
regarding PDMP use by [CONTACT_39487].   
In addition, a second silent alert (3rd level in model) will fire for all eligible patients seen by 
[CONTACT_172338], using the same criteria as the PDMP + EHR alert described above. As with the 
previously described alert, PDMP use will not  suppress this alert  so that all patients can be 
captured. This alert will allow us to document  the same  risk information for all study patients 
so we can describe patient risk information across intervention groups . Much of this 
information tends to be transient and variable over time. Having a snapshot of the data at 
that moment will be valuable in the final analysis.  
 
Figure 4: Visible (top row) and silent alerts used in the study CDS  
Due to primary care not allowing interruptive BPAs, t here will be two units of randomization  
corresponding to the ED /hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172303], respectively . 
Prescribers working in UCHealth Emergency Departments  and inpatient facilities   
• Each ED /inpatient  prescriber will be randomized to one of the four study  arms  
described above . Dentists will be excluded.  
• Prescribers  will be stratified based on primary work site .  As a number of facilities 
within the UCHealth  system share staff, “work site” is being defined based on shared 
staffing as follows:

• Prescribers  will be randomized at th e time of activation of the CDS using permuted 
block randomization  base upon their pr imary work site  and will remain in study for 12 
months.  
• CDS will only fire for discharge prescriptions  (i.e. not for inpatient orders)  for 
prescribers  working in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -based  facilities.  
• Providers who work in multiple locations will be assigned to the location where they do the majority of their prescribing.  
Primary care and selected specialty practices   
• Practices will be randomized into study  arms 1 , 3, or 4 . Due to workflow concerns and 
the longitudinal  physician/patient relationship in primary care, and based on 
feedback from primary care leadership, inclusion of an interruptive , non -specific  alert 
was considered to be counterproductive in this population.  
• Practices will be stratified as small, medium, or large based on the number of opi[INVESTIGATOR_172310] . Small 
practices are those with a number of prescriptions  in the lowest third , large practices 
in the highest third , and medium size practice all others.  
• Practices with less than [ADDRESS_201995] of the CDS on prescribing is anticipated to be minimal and excluding such low providers will reduce the risk of inactive prescribers biasing results.  
• Practices will be randomized at  the time of activation of the CDS  and will remain on 
study for [ADDRESS_201996] in EDs, then for inpatient providers, and finally in ambulatory 
settings.  This staged roll out will allow for identification and modification of system bugs and 
unanticipated problems, as well as allow for increased socialization of the tools and greater buy in by [CONTACT_39487].  
Protocol Template  Page 10 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/[ADDRESS_201997] appropriate unit of randomization would be the 
practice/ site.  However, pragmatic concerns also inform the design, specifically:  
1. Primary care : Randomizing by [CONTACT_172339] -group contamination if a single provider or 
practice treated multiple patients with similar risk  patterns but received different CDS 
alerts.  It also ensure s that all members of a treatment team working with a single 
patient or single encounter receive the same information about that patient’s risk  
stratification .   
2. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_78515]:   The small number of EDs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], especially large EDs, relative 
to the numb er of randomization groups  translate s to a la rge risk of unbalanced groups. 
To address this issue , a smaller unit of randomization is appropriate  specifically for EDs 
and hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_172311].  The authorizing provider  is ultimately responsible for opi[INVESTIGATOR_172312] a smaller unit.  As residents work under 
a number of attending physicians, this will also prevent the development of 
overreliance on automated alerts in a physician in training, in order to minimize the chance of risk to clinical care.  
Prior to CDS activation  and at the time of activation, training materials will be shared with 
relevant sites an d practices.  These materials are included in Appendix #.  A link to a provider 
feedback survey in RED Cap will be included in order to  collect standardized feedback from 
system users.  
Activation  of the alert will be monitored using automated tracking within Epic which identifies 
providers and patients associated with alert firings. A key feature of the CDS is that the PDMP check must be “attested” to in order to suppress the CDS and prevent re -firing of the alerts , 
which is interruptive to the provider. This attestation is a workflow change for providers and 
is essential for CDS success. It can happen prior to prescription entry, in which case the alerts will not activate  (suppression) , or after activation of the alert.  
In the event that providers are being “hit” with CDS alerts multiple times within the same 
encounter for a single patient because they miss the attestation step, an educational message 
with a link to the education website will be sent to the provider via email or EHR internal 
messaging systems to remind the provider to click the attestation button in order to prevent 
multiple firings. A weekly tally of messages sent will be retained, but no patient information  
will be retained.  No provider will receive more  than three educational reminders.  The 
reminder will not include any patient information. This check is intended only to provide an 
additional personalized education step.  
This is important because (1) dissemination of education about new CDS across all of UCHealth is challenging so we will miss providers and (2) we have concerns that if providers find the CDS to be a nuisance (due to a simple knowledge gap of not understand ing the 
attestation requirement) they will not use the CDS.   
Similarly, if a provider receives multiple alerts but does not access the PDMP in response, a reminder will be sent that checking the PDMP requires the same number of “clicks” as 
dismissing the alert and is considered best practice prior to prescribing. As  with the contact 
[CONTACT_172340] 11 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/[ADDRESS_201998].  
From initiation of educational messages until 9/20/2021, p roviders  who receive one of the 
above educational messages  will receive the message via email. Educational messages sent on 
or after 9/21/[ADDRESS_201999] practices with providers . 
Provider identifying information will be retained in order to determine the effectiveness of the educational outreach. Information retained will include alert firings (including multiple 
firings/patient) and provider actions over time. In order to better understand the 
environments in which educational intervention is most effective, provider specialty, primary work site , and basic demographic information (age, gender, race/ethnicity) , will be obtained 
from within the EHR . Method of  notification (email or internal messaging within the EHR)  will 
also be tracked to compare provider behavioral changes between educational notifications . 
Provider work environment (Emergency Department, inpatient or ambulatory) will be 
determined based on study randomization lists.  Data will be deidentified for analysis.  Data on 
CDS and site performance will be monitored continuously during the c ourse of the study (see 
attached file “Baseline data” for details of data monitored) via automated data extract built 
by [INVESTIGATOR_6679] E pic analytics team and monitored by [CONTACT_15328].  No identif iable data will be collected  
in or der to protect confidentiality.  De-identified extracts of these data may be exported from 
Epic to the UCDenv er OneDrive system for CDS  monitoring  and analysis .  Baseline data will be 
gathered retrospectively for the [ADDRESS_202000] of these data will be from patients whose visit is not relevant to study procedures or study participation, no identifying information will be colle cted at this step  and 
no attempts will be made to link any given score to a patient, encounter, or specific prescription.  
Collection of patient specific data and outcomes:   
Protocol Template  Page 12 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/[ADDRESS_202001]. PDMP data  will provide additional information on controlled 
substance use by [CONTACT_172341] -UCHealth sites and may be useful to identify  aberrant or 
high -risk use of controlled medications by [CONTACT_102]. Data will be merged with All Payer 
Claims Data for selected outcomes (ED utilization, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], death) then secondarily de-
identified by [CONTACT_172342] “honest broker” and returned to the study team as a 
limited data set for analysis.  
D.   Description, Risks and Justification of Proc edures and Data Collection Tools:  
Procedures: This 
study does not 
include any 
procedures which mandate a particular course of patient care or 
prescriber behavior. All PDMP 
information shared 
is already available 
through the state portal or integrated Epic PDMP button. It is designed to improve access and data presentation 
of patient -related information  to facilitate safety through risk stratification. Use of the PDMP 
prior to prescribing an opi[INVESTIGATOR_172313] a CDC clinical best practice and is required 
by [CONTACT_172343] [11]. This study is 
designed to make PDMP access  easier and more efficient (increase signal to noise)  and 
measure the impact through both healthcare system and patient outcomes . As such, it 
represents no greater risk to patients or providers than normal clinical care.   
Data collection :  CDS activation and provider behavior . Most healthcare system data 
collection will be automated within the EHR . This is the lowest risk and most accurate method 
of collecting information on the function of EHR tools  and clinical decisions . Collection of 
feedback from providers will be collected  through secure  REDCap-based surveys and  
information collection tools. Providers have the option of answer ing all questions 
anonymously. However, there is a small risk of release of information considered private on 
clinical practices and decision -making processes. Provision of input is fully voluntary, we will 
not ask for any  information on specific patients or any proprietary information from the 
practice. No information will be provided about statutory compliance to regulatory agencies 
so there is no risk to the provider around employability or reputation.  

Protocol Template  Page 13 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/11  
 Data collection:  Patient specific outcomes . This is the only stage of the study which will 
access PHI, however, there is no direct patient contact [CONTACT_172344], not  dictate a course of treatment.  As 
such, the primary risk of the study is release of private information or a breach of 
confidentiality around PHI but does not change the patient’s risk beyond that of normal 
medical care.  In order to mitigate this risk, UCDenver Compass for Health will act as an 
“Honest Broker ” and provide only a de -identified data set to the study team  as they have on 3 
prior collaborations  with our team . More information on data protections and processes are 
provided in the COMIRB application document.  
Data collection : Provider educational outreach.  Provider identifying information will be 
collected, unassociated with specific patient information. All data will be deidentified by [CONTACT_172345]. Each provider will be assigned a record number as part of the RedCap database. At the time of analysis, provider name [CONTACT_172354]. The only risk to the 
provider from the educational outreach is the possibility of a small breach of privacy around 
prescribing patterns. All messaging and data storage will be kept within the UCHealth/UCDenver systems in order to maintain privacy. Records including provider names will be stored in RedCap.  
    
E.   Potential Scientific Problems:   
In our previous work, we noted a temporal trend toward system -wide decrease in opi[INVESTIGATOR_172314]. If this is ongoing and includes  outpatient clinics , it will 
complicate analysis o f the impact of the CDS tools. As such, it is important both to inc lude a 
control group with no visible CDS  and to apply the CDS  across as large a range of providers as 
possible in order to collect enough data to be able to separate temporal and study related differences.  To avoid p otential data- distorting geographic differences in opi[INVESTIGATOR_85414], 
we will randomize  clinics by [CONTACT_172346][INVESTIGATOR_87265] w as done in our 
previous study. As we are working only in Colorado, generalizability of the study may be 
limited if there are unique conditions in this state which cannot be controlled for or statistically managed.  
We cannot truly mandate consultation of t he PDMP at any point in patient care, therefore we 
will not be able to definitively determine if prescribing is wholly dependent o n the 
information in the PDMP. However, it is important that  clinical care not be disrupted in order 
to increase acceptance, and therefore impact, of the CDS.    
There is a risk that patients will be seen by [CONTACT_172347]. For primary care, this is a small risk as most patients remain with the same clinics for primary care. This is a greater concern for ED or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172315]. For provider level outcomes (Aim1) the multiple patient visits can be accounted for with random effects and from a provider prospective the visits can  essentially be treated as unique. For patient 
follow -up outcomes, patients can be censored at the time of a subsequent visit and then 
followed from the new time point.  
At the time of this submission, design and building of the CDS tools is nearly complete and it 
appears that the required system -level process monitoring data can be collected in an

F.   Data Analysis Plan:   
Two categories of data will be collected in conjunction with this study. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] s ystem 
measures  will be collected and monitored both at baseline an d during conduct of the study. 
Technical or wording issues in the CDS tools which are identified by [CONTACT_172349], but the alert  logic  and conduct of the study will not be changed.  Patient level 
measures  will be measured retrospectively.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172316]: 
1. Description of practices to include:  
• # of licensed providers  
• # of patients  
• # of visits  
• Specialty/Service  
• Study group  
2. Description  of prescribing  to include  the number  of opi[INVESTIGATOR_172317]: 
• Site/practice/prescriber  
• Study arm  
• Month  
• Specialty  
• PDMP button annotation (reviewed/unable to review)  
• PDMP check not recorded  
• To patient with existing sedative prescription  
• Formulation – immediate vs sustained/extended release  
3. Description  of use of the PDMP  and study -associated  BPAs, specifically  monitoring  
• # of times PDMP activity/website is checked by  [CONTACT_3725]/practice/service , monthly, 
and specialty  
• Frequency of use of the PDMP one -click button per visit and per opi[INVESTIGATOR_172298]  
• Frequency of CDS and BPA trigger overall and per opi[INVESTIGATOR_16447]  
• Frequency of prescriptions for which the BPA would have fired but the prescriber 
had already checked the PDMP (look for change over time – do the BPAs lead to 
learning & change in prescriber behavior)  
• Number of times CDS alert fired , total and per visit  (the alert is designed to only 
fire once during any encounter, thus the per visit rate will be <1)  
• Reviewed  (via radio button or via alert)/unable to review/blank  
Protocol Template  Page 15 
CF-146, Effective 7/10/11  
 • Resulted in signed Rx (reviewed/unable checked , signed prescription)  
• Use of training tools  and website . Identifying information on individuals accessing 
tools will not be recorded.  
• Qualitative/semi- quantitative feedback from users as the CDS alerts  are 
implemented  
 Patient specific measures will include : 
o Number of controlled medication  prescriptions, both within UCHealth and 
outside, based on PDMP data (including prescription details to include generic 
name, dosage, MMEs, days prescribed)  
o Use of the PDMP by [CONTACT_172350]  
o NarxCare risk score at the time of each prescription  
o Number of providers/practices used for controlled substance prescriptions  
o Number of pharmacies used for controlled substance prescriptions  
o Diagnosis of any substance use disorder after the index visit date  
o Accidental overdose of controlled substance after the index date (if data 
available)  
o Patient demographics and clinical history characteristics  
 
Educational outreach analysis: Alert firings for providers part of the educational  outreach group 
will be analyzed for percent of non -compliant firings before outreach vs after  as well as a 
comparison between the two different educational outreach efforts (email or EHR messaging system) . Non -compliance is defined as 3 or more alerts for a single patient/encounter or >80% of 
firings closed using the comment/close option rather than using the PDMP link. Firings over time will be tracked as will changes in com pliance before and after each outreach attempt.  These data 
will be de -identified prior to reporting.  Data will be examined for patterns based on demographics 
or work environment.  
 Calculation of sample size:  
The number of providers who choose to provide input on CDS design and implementation can 
only be very roughly estimated. The UCHealth system includes approximately 18,000 individual 
prescribers, not all of whom will see the alerts. Assuming 5% of individual prescribers choose to 
provide feedback through the survey available on the website,  approximately 900 providers 
could provide feedback.  No minimal response rate is required for significance as no hypotheses 
will be tested with these data . Survey data will be summarized via descriptive statistics only.  
The driving factor in total enrollmen t is the patient outcome phase.  As the tools will be active 
over the course of approximately 20 months, total patient counts over 20 months, rather than a 
power calculation, inform our assumptions about enrollment. Of the approximately 2.3 million 
individuals in the UCHealth system between the ages of 12 – 89, approximately [ADDRESS_202003] in order to obtain risk data, but data will only be seen by a provider in a fraction of cases.  Based on the advice of privacy officials and COMIRB staff during the design of this study, all individuals queried are included as study participants, even if a provider does not see a study associated CDS alert for all

CF-146, Effective 7/10/11  
 patients.  As such, it is estimated that 950,000 patients will be included in this study. The number 
of patients queried will be monitored during the course of the study and updated as needed .

G.  Summarize Knowledge to be Gained:   
As PDMP use improves prescribing decision s, this study will provide  immediate, direct b enefit to 
study participants . Further , it will provide greater understanding of the reasons why clinicians use 
or do not use the PDMP as recommended, and explore several options for improving utilization  
and maximizing appropriate clinician use of the information provided.  Finally, it will explore patient focused outcomes when the PDMP is used (or not), and if patient outcomes are better (defined as less aberrant or long term opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]) when PDMP CDS tools are better integrated 
into the provider’s workflow  and better focused on providing high impact, risk based information

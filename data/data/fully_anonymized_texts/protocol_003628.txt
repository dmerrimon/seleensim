Protocol Title  
A Pha se IIa, Double -Blind, Randomized , Placebo -controlled, Exploratory Study to Evaluate the Safety, 
Biological Activity and Pharmacokinetics of GBR [ADDRESS_93498]/Code  
GBR [ADDRESS_93499] shown that OX40 and OX40L play a role in 
the optimal production of T cell cytokines and in regulation of  the T-helper (Th) 1/2 balance.  
Atopic Dermatitis ( AD) is a chronic inflammatory disease, considered a polar Th2 disease, and chronic AD 
lesions have been shown to have a marked increase in Th2 T cells and related cytokines .  OX40 mediates 
signaling by [CONTACT_85787] (TSLP) -activated dentritic cells (DCs) and is highly upregulated in 
atopic skin.  TSLP -activated DCs have been shown to preferentially activate Th2 T -cell responses in autologous 
and allogeneic cultures in an OX40 -dependent manner .   
Data published by [CONTACT_85788], [ADDRESS_93500] of the systemic immune - suppressant, cyclosporin A (CsA), on AD skin pathology 
was performed b y Khattri et al, [ADDRESS_93501] that the blockade of key 
GBR 830- 201 
Version 4.0 
Date 16-Feb-2017  
Glenmark  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 12 of 98 drivers of Th2 –mediated inflammation could help in the tr eatment of AD.  AD is therefore considered a suitable 
model disease for an exploratory signal search study for GBR 830.  
The objective of this study is to explore effects of GBR [ADDRESS_93502] of further definitive efficacy studies in this indication .  
Preliminary safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) data has been generated in a phase I study in healthy volunteers .  
The results of non -clinical pharmacology and toxicology s tudies conducted with GBR 830 to date supporting this 
study are provided in the Investigator’s Brochure  (IB).  
Study Objective(s): 
Primary:  
• Safety and tolerability of repeated doses of GBR 830 in adult patients with AD  
• Effect of repeated doses of GBR 830 on biomarkers of disease activity in adult patients with AD.  
Secondary:  
• Effect of GBR 830 on clinical efficacy parameters in adult patients with AD . 
• Pharmacokinetics ( PK) of repeated doses of GBR 830 in adult patients with  AD. 
• Immunogenicity of GBR 830 in adult patients with  AD. 
Exploratory :  
• Additional exploratory objectives to understand the mechanism of GBR [ADDRESS_93503] on cellular 
infiltrates and immune pathways  
Study Population 
The target study population is adult males and females with chronic moderate -to-severe AD as defined by 
[CONTACT_85789] (EASI)  score of ≥ 12; Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) of ≥ 20 ; 
Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of ≥ 3 at baseline and with history of inadequate response to topi[INVESTIGATOR_81967] . 
Study Design 
The study is a phase IIa , double -blind, randomized , placebo -controlled, repeated dose study to evaluate safety, 
biological activity and PK of GBR 830 in adult patients with AD .  The study will be conducted in 
approximately 16 centers  in US/Canada .  The study will be conducted in three phases: screening phase, treatment 
phase and follow -up phase .   
During the screening phase, after providing informed consent, all patients will be screened for eligibility prior to 
inclusion in the study  and sufficient number of patients will be screened to ensure approximately [ADDRESS_93504] the Day 29 visit.  Approximately 60 to 80 patients are planned to be randomized in a ratio of 3:1 to receive 
GBR 830 (10 mg/kg) or placebo, in a two- arm, parallel design study.

Glenmark  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 13 of 98 Patients who meet eligibility criteria will undergo Day 1/baseline assessments, randomization, and then receive 
the first intravenous ( IV) infusion of GBR [ADDRESS_93505] infusion (Day 1/baseline) and for 3 hours after the next dose ( Day 29).  Patients will return 
for follow -up visits as mentioned i n Appendix  [ADDRESS_93506] patients by 
[CONTACT_85790] 24 hours after each infusion ( Days 2 and 30) for concomitant medications and 
procedures, and a general adverse event (AE) query .   
 
Figure 1: Study design  
 
Apart from the dosing visits, patients will be seen in the clinic on Day  4, 8, 15, 22,  29, 32, 36, 43, 50, 57, 71 and 
the end of study visit occurs on Day  85 (week 12) for stu dy assessments and PK sample collection.  
Skin punch biopsy samples for biomarker analysis will be collected at Day  1/baseline, Day 29 and Day  71.  
Analyses will be performed where samples are available.  A gene/mRNA expression profiling will be performed 
to evaluate the effects of OX40 blockade on both lesional and non -lesional skin from patients with AD .  Changes 
in gene expression in the AD transcriptome of lesional skin in comparison to a non -lesional molecular phenotype 
will be used to evaluate treatmen t-associated effects .  In addition any correlation with improvements in disease 
activity and clinical outcomes will also be evaluated .

collected at Day  1/baseline, Day 29 and Day  71.  Analyses will be performed where samples are available.  
Changes in gene expression in t he AD transcriptome of lesional skin (LS) in comparison to a non -lesional (NL) 
molecular phenotype will be used to evaluate treatment -associated effects .  The improvement in the AD 
transcriptome of LS will be defined as treatment -associated changes in gene expression toward a NL molecular 
phenotype .  A ‘‘worsening’’ or exacerbation will be defined as gene expression changes further distinguishing 
LSs from NLs.  
In addition, skin biopsy sam ples will be evaluated for routin e histopathology for evaluation of di sease severity.    
Leukocyte sub -population cell counts , cytokines, chemokines, TEWL, total IgE, sOX40L, and eosinophil levels 
will also be measured in the study.   Cellular infiltrates (T -cells, dendritic cells) will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_85798] b iopsy slides with CD3, FcEpsilon RI, OX40L, OX40, and MBP.  
Serum soluble OX40 and OX40L will be measured using PK samples at the t ime points defined in Appendix  1. 
Safety Assessments 
Safety and tolerability of GB R 830 including AEs, SAEs, vit al signs, laboratory parameters, ECGs, and physical 
examinations.  
Efficacy Assessments • The EASI is a validated measure used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the severity and extent 
of AD .  Four AD disease ch aracteristics will be assessed for severity by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator or designee on a 
scale of “0” (absent) through “3” (severe) .  In addition, the area of AD involvement will be assessed as a 
percentage by [CONTACT_12904], trunk, arms, and legs and converted  to a score of 0 to 6.  
• The SCORAD is a validated tool used in clinical research and clinical practice that was developed to standardize the evaluation of the extent and severity of AD .  The extent of AD is assessed as a percentage of 
each defined body area and reported as the sum of all areas, with a maximum score of 100% (assigned as “A” 
in the overall SCORAD calculation) .  The severity of 6 specific symptoms of AD is assessed using the 
following scale: none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3) (for a maximum of 18 total points, assigned as 
“B” in the overall SCORAD calculation) .  Subjective assessment of itch and sleeplessness is recorded for 
each symptom by [CONTACT_12906] a visual analogue scale (VAS), where 0 is no itch (or 
sleeplessnes s) and [ADDRESS_93519] imaginable itch (or sleeplessness), with a maximum possible score of 20.  
This parameter is assigned as “C” in the overall SCORAD calculation .  The SCORAD is calculated as: A/5 + 
7B/2 + C.  
• The IGA is an assessment scale used in clin ical studies to determine severity of AD and clinical response to 
treatment based on a 5 -point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4  (severe/ very severe).  
• 
Pruritus Numerical rating scale (NRS) : Patients will record once daily and respond to the following quest ion, 
“On a scale of 0 –  10, with 0 being “no itch ” and 10 being the “ worst itch imaginable ”, how would you rate 
your worst degree of itch during the previous 24 hours?” Patient compliance on the pruritus NRS will be 
followed at each clinic visit.  
• Dermatolo gy Life Quality Index (DLQI): The DLQI is a simple, patient -administered, 10 -question, validated, 
quality -of-life questionnaire that covers 6 domains including symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, 
work and school, personal relationships, and t reatment .  Response categories include “ a little ,” “a lot,” and 
“very much” with corresponding scores of 1, 2, and 3 respectively and “not at all”, “not relevant” responses

GBR 830- [ADDRESS_93523] more than 5- 10% of the human po pulation ( Cooper et 
al, 2003)  and are associated with high morbidity and mortality .  They are chronic debilitating 
diseases that often attack young adults, especially women, and their social and eco nomic impact 
is enormous .  The limitations of currently available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_85741], 
moderate efficacy that declines after several years of treatment, and side effects, the most 
common being hepatotoxicity, myelosuppression and/or gene ral immunosuppression. 
The introduction of biological therapi[INVESTIGATOR_85742] a new era in the treatment of autoimmunity, and exerted a significant impact on the disease course and the quality of life of 
patients .  There are several biologicals that are either approved or in advanced clinical trials, the 
vast majority of which are used in the treatment of in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), multiple 
sclerosis (MS) and/or Crohn’s disease  (Balag ue et al, 2009) . 
AD is one of the most prevalent disorders worldwide that affects 4% -7% of adults and 15- 25% 
of children with a significant impact on quality of life of patients .  It is a chronic, relapsing 
inflammatory skin disease characterized by [CONTACT_85799] (e.g., itchiness) and by [CONTACT_85800], such as allergic rhinitis and 
asthma .   
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_85743], and the burden on society, specific therapi[INVESTIGATOR_85744], and most commonly used therapi[INVESTIGATOR_85745] .  Approximately 20% of patients with AD have moderate to severe 
disease and generally require systemic therapy, as outlined in several i nternational and regional 
treatment guidelines (Sidbury et al, 2014, Ring et al, 2012) .  Most traditional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_85746].  
Recent fi ndings link immune and epi[INVESTIGATOR_85747] ( Raap et al, 2012; Szegedi et 
al, 2012) , suggesting that disease -driving Th2 cytokine s involved in AD, such as IL -4, IL -13 and 
IL-22 inhibit production of barrier proteins (i.e filaggrin and loricrin) and antimicrobial peptides .  
Thus, inhibition of specific adaptive immune responses or cytokine pathways would be expected 
to lead to skin barrier repair .  Antagonism of this polarized T -cell pathway has the potential to 
produce fewer immune antagonism related adverse effects, unlike the multiple adverse effects 
with broad T -cell suppression. 
Although there are multiple systemic agents recomme nded for the treatment of AD, many of the 
patients still do not achieve optimal efficacy and these treatments have limited efficacy in moderate to severe disease.  Drug -specific major safety concerns are another major limitation 
(Levin et al, 2014) .  Thus, there remains a significant unmet patient need for new agents with 
unique mechanisms that can provide improved and sustained skin clearance, and a safety profile 
GBR 830- [ADDRESS_93524]: Mechanism of Action  
GBR 830 is a highly selective, humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the IgG1 subtype 
which targets the human OX40 receptor ; a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor 
(TNF -R) gene family.  A common function of TNF -R family  members is the regulation of 
T cell-mediated activation and/or apoptosis.  OX40 appears to be an excellent target for 
autoimmune the rapy because the T cells that express OX40 are highly enriched for the cells that 
react with auto -antigen at the site of inflammation .  These molecules strongly regulate 
conventional cluster of differentiation ( CD) [ADDRESS_93525] 
demonstrated their ability to modulate Natural killer (NK) T cell and NK cell function as well as to mediate cross -talk with professional antigen- presenting cells and diverse cell types such as 
mast cells, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells .  Addi tionally, OX40 -OX40L interactions 
alter the differentiation and activity of regulatory T cells ( Croft, 2010) .  
Blocking the OX40/OX40L pathway has been shown to be protective in several animal model s 
of human disease such as asthma, irritable bowel disease, transplant rejection, autoimmune diabetes, graft versus host disease (GvHD), and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, thus validating OX40 as a highly attractive pathway to antagonize  in aut oimmune diseases .  
Unlike conventional immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], blockade of OX40–OX40L interactions seems to inhibit disease- responsible effector T -cell function specifically, and therefore not cause widespread 
immunosuppression. 
5.3. Preclinical Experience  
Functional pharmacology studies have demonstrated that GBR  830 is able to block the 
interaction between OX40 and OX40L and suppress T cell proliferation and allogeneic reactions, such as mixed lymphocyte reactions, with 50% effective concentrations ranging from 0.1 t o 
3 µg/mL .  These studies have also demonstrated that GBR  830 has antibody -dependent cellular 
cytotoxicity and complement -dependent cytotoxicity potential .  Consistent with in vitro data, in 
vivo pharmacology studies demonstrated that GBR  830 could suppres s a xenogeneic reaction in 
a human -mouse GvHD model at doses as low as 1 mg/kg .  Studies using a human psoriatic skin 
transplant model have demonstrated the potent therapeutic anti -psoriatic activity of GBR  830. 
Secondary pharmacodynamics studies were cond ucted to support the safety of GBR  830 
administration in humans .  GBR  830 was devoid of agonistic potential and did not induce 
cytokine release in either human peripheral whole blood from healthy volunteers or human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)  cultures at high density .  Taken together, these 
studies suggest a low risk of inadvertent cytokine release in humans for GBR  830. 
In-vitro vaccine reactivation assays suggest that targeting pathological responses driven by 
[CONTACT_85801] T cell reactivation with  GBR  [ADDRESS_93526] of GBR  830 treatment

Glenmark  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 27 of 98 on a T -dependent antibody response to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), suggest that targeting 
OX40 has  more profound effects on late and memory responses than primary responses .  This 
feature highlights that an antagonistic OX40 treatment in the clinic may display a safer profile in 
terms of infection susceptibility compared with broader immunosuppressors. 
In vivo efficacy of GBR  830 has been demonstrated in an acute GvHD model (mainly 
prophylactic) and in a human psoriasis xenograft (therapeutic) model .  The efficacy in these 
studies was observed to be similar to or better than that observed with established drugs 
(efalizumab, etanercept, temovate, cyclosporin) .  These data confirm the immunomodulatory 
capabilities of GBR  830 in T cell mediated autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. 
Administration of GBR  830 to cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to 100 mg/kg/w eek for [ADDRESS_93527] level (NOAEL) was 100  mg/kg/week.  
5.4. Clinical Experience  
A Phase I stud y, entitled “A Two -Part, Phase I , Randomized, Placebo -controlled, Single 
Ascending Dose Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of GBR  830 in 
Adult Healthy Volunteers (Part 1) and a Randomized, Placebo -controlled, Pharmacodynamic 
Study to Evaluate the Effects of a Single Dose of GBR 830 on t he Vaccination Response in 
Adult, Healthy Volunteers (Part 2),” was conducted to evaluate the safety , PK and PD of GBR 
830 in healthy volunteers (GBR 830- 101).  All subjects completed the study as planned and 
safety data from this study suggest that single  IV doses of GBR 830 are safe and well tolerated 
up to 10 mg/kg administered over 1 hour .   
In Part 1 of the study, sequential doses of 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, and 10 mg/kg were evaluated in cohorts of 8 subjects each (n=6 GBR 830, n=2 placebo/cohort) to determine the safety and pharmacokinetics of single IV doses of GBR [ADDRESS_93528] 
results (including hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis), cytokine analysis (IL -1β, IL-2, IL -6,

Two TEAEs (headache and nausea) in Part [ADDRESS_93532] shown that 
OX40 and OX40L play a role in the optimal production of T cell cytokines and in regulation of 
the T -helper (Th) 1/2 balance .   
AD is a chronic inflammatory disease in which skin lesions show a marked increas e in Th2 cells, 
Type 22 (T22) cells, and related cytokines i.e., interleukins -4 (IL -4), -5, -6, -9, -10, -13, and -22  
(Guttman -Yassky et al, 2007; Guttman -Yassky et al, 2011; Croft, 2010) .  The OX40 ⁄OX40L 
interaction has been suggested to play an essential role in the pathogenesis of AD .  OX40L is 
expressed by [CONTACT_85804], endothelial cells and T cells, whereas OX40 is found mainly on activated T cells.  The expression of OX40L on dendritic cells ( DC) is induced by [CONTACT_85805] -activated 
DCs migrate into lymph nodes where OX40 ⁄OX40L interaction triggers the differentiation of 
inflammatory Th2 cells that produce IL -4, IL -5, IL -13 and TNF -a, but no or only little IL -10.  
Thymic stromal lymphopoietin  (TSLP) -activated dentritic cells (DCs) are highly upregulated in 
atopic skin.  TSLP -activated DCs have been shown to preferentially activate Th2 T -cell 
responses in autologous and allogeneic cultures in an OX40- dependent manner.  The finding that 
OX40/OX4 0L interactions are the molecular trigger responsible for the induction and 
maintenance of TH2 responses by [CONTACT_85806] -activated DCs provides a plausible molecular 
explanation for initiation and maintenance of allerg ic diseases .  These exciting findings suggest 
that inhibition of OX40 provides a novel therapeutic approach for the treatments of allergic diseases.  
GBR 830- [ADDRESS_93533] of the systemic immune - suppressant, cyclosporin A (CsA), on 
AD skin pathology was performed by [CONTACT_85807], [ADDRESS_93534] that the blockade of k ey drivers of Th2 –
mediated inflammation could help in the treatment of AD.  AD is therefore considered a suitable model disease for an exploratory signal search study for GBR 830. 
The objective of this study is to explore effects of GBR [ADDRESS_93535] OX40 (CD134), a co -stimulatory receptor present on activated T cells 
responsible for the expansion and maintenance of effector and memory immune responses .  
Blocking the binding of OX40 to its ligand, OX40L (CD252) reduces the longevity and efficacy of these immune responses .  GBR [ADDRESS_93536] in human (FIH) study 
with GBR 830 in the Netherlands and now intends to submit an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for an exploratory Signal Search Study in patients with moder ate to severe AD .   
Extensive preclinical functional characterization studies have been conducted with GBR 830 to 
validate the mechanism of action ( Details in the IB ).  The findings from these studies are in 
agreement with the expected pharmacological effect of an antagonist anti -OX40 antibody.  
Secondary pharmacodynamics studies were conducted to support the safety of GBR 830 administration in humans (Details in the IB) .  GBR 830 was devoid of agonistic potential and did 
not induce cytokine release in eithe r human peripheral whole blood from healthy volunteers or 
human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures at high density .  These studies 
suggest a low risk of inadvertent cytokine release in humans for GBR 830.

phases: screening phase, treatment phase and follow -up phase.  
During the screening phase, after providing inform ed consent, all patients will be screened for 
eligibility prior to inclusion in the study and sufficient number of patients will be screened to 
ensure approximately [ADDRESS_93541] the Day 29 visit.  Approximate ly -60 to 80 patients are planned to be  
randomized in a rati o of 3:1 to receive GBR 830 (10 mg/kg) or placebo, in a two- arm, parallel 
design study.   
Patients who meet eligibility criteria will undergo Day 1/baseline assessments, randomization, 
and then re ceive the first IV infusion of GBR [ADDRESS_93542] infusion ( Day 1/baseline) and for 3 
hours after the next dose ( Day 29).  Patients will return for follow -up visits as mentioned in 
Appendix  [ADDRESS_93543] patients by [CONTACT_85808] 24 hours after each infusion ( Days 2 and 30) for concomitant medications and 
procedures, and a general AE query.  
Apart from the dosing visits, patients will be seen in the clinic on Day 4, 8, 15, 22, 29, 32, 36, 43, 50, 57, 71 and the end of study visit occurs on Day 85 (week 12) for study assessm ents and PK 
sample collection.  
Skin punch biopsy samples for biomarker analysis will be collected at Day  1/baseline, Day  29 
and Day  71.  Analyses will be performed where samples are available.  A gene/mRNA 
expression profiling will be performed to evaluate  the effects of OX40 blockade on both lesional 
and non- lesional skin from patients with AD .  Changes in gene expression in the AD 
transcriptome of lesional skin in comparison to a non- lesional molecular phenotype will be used 
to evaluate treatment -associat ed effects .  In addition any correlation with improvements in 
disease activity and clinical outcomes will also be evaluated .   
The end of the study will be the date of the last study visit for the last patient  in the study.

At screening, patients will be assessed on EASI, IGA, SC ORAD, and BSA  for AD .  Patients will 
be withdrawn from use of other medication being used to control their AD as mentioned in prior 
and concomitant medication section.  On Day 1, prior to dosing, patients will be reassessed on 
EASI, IGA, SCORAD and BSA for AD to ensure that they qualify for the study.  
7.1.2. Treatment Phase  
The treatment phase consists of the 2 visits (Days 1 and Day 29) which correspond to the study 
drug dosing days .  Study drug IV infusions will be given on these days .  Patient s will undergo 
baseline biops ies on Day 1 (pre -dose) .  All patient s will have visit procedures as defined in

7.2. Discussion of Study Design, Including Choice of Control Groups  
The main objective of this phase IIa signal search study is to evaluate the effect of repeated doses 
of GBR 830 on biomarkers of disease activity in adult patients with moderate to severe AD .  The 
objectives are exploratory in nature to further understand the mechanism of GBR 830 with the 
help of biomarker data .  Recently, improvement s of the AD m olecular signature [CONTACT_85868][INVESTIGATOR_12458] ( Hamilton et al, 2014; Beck et al, 2014) , a targeted 
Th2 antagonist , and these changes occurred earlier and were larger than clinical endpoints , 
suggesting that these are valid endpoints for an exploratory study .  Placebo control will provide 
internal validity for the clinical trial and will improve the sensitivity of the clinical trial for drug 
related changes and hence suited for an exploratory study .

9.3.1. Study Termination Criteria  
If, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], the clinical observations in the study suggest that it may be 
unwise to continue, the Investigator may terminate his participation in the study , after 
consultation with the Sponsor .  In addition, the Sponsor may terminate part of, or the entire 
study, for safety or administrative reasons .  A written statement fully documenting the reasons  
for study termination will be provided to the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/ Independent 
Ethics Committee (IEC) and the Regulatory authorities .   
9.3.2. Patient  Discontinuation/Withdrawal Criteria  
A patient  may voluntarily discontinue study participation at a ny time after giving informed 
consent and before the completion of the follow -up visit (Visit 1 4 - Day 85 ).  The Investigator 
may also discontinue the patient ’s study participation at any time at his/her discretion and for any 
reason .   
The reasons for pat ient withdrawal will be recorded and may include, but are not limited to:  
• Withdrawal of consent by [CONTACT_85816] .  
• Development of a serious or intolerable AE that necessitates discontinuation at the 
discretion of the Investigator ( AE section of eCRF must be completed; includes SAE, 
death) . 
• At the discretion of the Investigator, when he/she believes continued participation is 
not in the best interest of the patient . 
• At the discretion of the Investigator, when the patient  does not adher e to the study 
procedures  or restrictions . 
• Protocol deviation that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_85736], warrants 
discontinuation from the study . 
• A positive pregnancy test. 
• A patient requires concomitant medications, which may interfere with the  PK of the 
study drug .  Note: withdrawal in such cases will be discussed and mutually agreed by 
[CONTACT_2725]. 
• Patients requiring rescue medications or interventions . 
GBR 830- 201 
Version 4.0 
Date 16-Feb-2017  
Glenmark  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 41 of 98 • The patient for any reason requires treatment with another therapeutic agent that has 
been demonstrated to be effective for the treatment of AD .  In this case, 
discontinuation from the study should occur prior to introduction of the new agent.  
• Disease progression/exacerbation, which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_85754].   
• Patients randomized in the study who withdraw their consent for the first post -
baseline skin biops ies. 
The decision to discontinue dosing in a patient due to adverse drug effects wil l be made on the 
basis of clinical severity and relatedness to study drug .  Except in cases of emergency, it is 
recommended that the Investigator consult with the Sponsor’s medical monitor (MM) before 
removing the patient from the study.  
In case of prematu re discontinuation, the reason and their cause must be documented.  The 
Investigator (or designee) must document the reason for withdrawal in the End of Study section 
of the eCRF.  
All Follow -up assessments of Visit 1 4 (Day 85)  should be conducted at the Ea rly Withdrawal 
Visit.  
Patient s discontinued from the study at any stage will be consider ed for safety and PK analysis .  
Patients  who are permanently discontinued from study drug due to reasons other than an AE and 
before the first post baseline skin biops ies or before receiving two doses of study drug, will not 
be considered evaluable for the Biol ogical Analysis Set (see Section  13.2).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Data Co llection for Patients Who Permanently Discontinue Study Drug  
1. For patient s who permanently discontinue study drug and agree  to be followed for safety  
and PK:  
The patient  will continue to return for visits as per timing of the visits listed in 
Appendix  1.  For these visits , the safety and PK procedures listed in S ection 11.[ADDRESS_93559] visit ( V14, Day  85) the entire End of Study Assessment should 
be performed  as described in Section 11.8. 
23. For patients who permanently discontinue study drug and are not willing to continue in 
the study:  
The end of study assessments (V14, D85) should be performed at this early withdrawal 
visit.   
9.3.3. Sponsor Discontinuation Criteria  
Premature termina tion of this study may occur because of a regulatory authority decision, change 
in opi[INVESTIGATOR_85755] (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC), drug 
safety problems, or at the discretion of Glenmark.  In addition, Glenmark retains the right to 
discontinue development of  GBR [ADDRESS_93560] all participating patient s and the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4601] (if applicable) within a time period set by [CONTACT_85786] .  As directed by

of dosing kits will be provided to the study sites .  After study completion, all unused GBR  830 
and placebo vials will be destroyed at the clinical site as per the CRO’s SOP or returned to the 
Sponsor, as per written communication from the Sponsor. 
The DPs will be labeled in accordance with text that is in full regulatory compliance with each 
participating count ry and as necessary translated into the required language(s) for each of those 
countries. 
10.3. Allocation to Treatment Groups  
At either a separate consent visit or screening visit, potential study patient s will be assigned a 
screening number .  Following confirmation of eligibility, patients will be assigned a 
randomization number through IVRS/IWRS .  The randomization scheme and identification for 
each patient  will be included in the final clinical study report (CSR) for this study .  The patient  
allocation and li st of dose/ patient  numbers are mentioned in Section  10.1.1. 
The randomization list will be generated using SAS Version 9.1.3 or higher .  All eligible patient s 
entering the study will be randomized to the two trea tment arms .  If a patient  discontinues from 
the study, the patient  number will not be re -used and the patient  will not be allowed to re -enter 
the study .   
Patient s will be randomly assigned to receive either GBR  830 or placebo in a 3: 1 ratio .  A 
randomizat ion number that uniquely identifies each patient  and the patient ’s treatment will be 
assigned on Day  1.  Randomization  numbers will be allocated from the schedule in strict 
chronologi cal order .  
A sufficient number of patients (approximately 60 to 80) will  be randomized such that 
approximately [ADDRESS_93570] the Day 29 visit.   
• For patients randomized prior to protocol version 3 ( amendment 2)  who do not 
complete at least the Day 29 visit:   
A replacement patient will be given the pa tient number corresponding to the person 
he/she is replacing plus 100.  For example, at site 01, if randomized patient [ADDRESS_93571] number for the replacement randomized patient would be 
011101.  Randomized replacement patient 011101 will receive the same treatment assignment (via IWRS) as the original randomized patient 011001 had received.   
• For patients randomized after protocol version 3 ( amendment [ADDRESS_93572] the Day 29 visit: Replacement of patients (to receive the same treatment assignment as the original subject he/she is replacing) will no longer be perf ormed.  
Randomization will be done using IVRS/IWRS  software.  
GBR 830- [ADDRESS_93573] and all study data .  In the event of a medical emergency 
when management of a patient ’s condition requires knowledge of the trial medication, 
IVRS/IWRS  will be used to determine the nat ure of the trial medication dispensed.  If possible, such 
emergencies should be discussed with the study monitor and the Sponsor prior to disclosure of 
the treatment allocation .  Reasons for breaking a code must be clearly explained and justified in 
the eC RF.  The date on which the code was broken together with the identity of the person 
responsible must also be documented.  
The following controls will be employed to maintain the double -blind status of the study:  
• The placebo will be identical in appearance t o the GBR  830 infusion 
• The Investigator and other members of staff involved with the study will remain blinded to the treatment randomization code during the assembly procedure  
• Any i nterim data will be provided in a blinded manner  
With the exception of the  statistician (who is not a study team member) preparing the 
randomization and personnel involved in packaging , all clinical and non- clinical staff will 
remain blinded to the treatment allocation until after the database is locked unless there is a medical  event that requires a code break.  
10.5. Investigational Product(s) Preparation, Receipt, Storage, Dispensing 
and Accountability

documentation.  The investigator must also ensure that the dispensing and recording of study 
drug is performed only by [CONTACT_4144] .  The study drug records must be readily 
available for inspection b y the study monitor and/or auditor/regulatory agency personnel .  No 
medication (new or used) can be returned to the Sponsor or disposed of at the investigational site until the  clinical monitor has verified/reconciled the accuracy of the study drug records at the 
site and indicated whether the study drug should be destroyed at the site or returned to the Sponsor .  The study monitor must indicate the name [CONTACT_85870].  
Clinical staff will dis pense the dosing kits at the visits specified in the study protocol .  The 
preparation of the infusion solutions (GBR  830 and placebo) will be performed by a licensed 
pharmacist or trained designee under the direction of the investigator .  The Investigational 
product will be diluted with a standard 0.9% sodium chloride solution to yield a uniform solution for IV infusion.  Foaming or excessive shearing of the protein solution must be avoided.  The 
preparation must be carefully inspected; it should result in a homogeneous -looking clear solution 
free of visible particles .  Direct sunlight should be avoided.  The details of preparation and

following scale: none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3) (for a maximum of 18 total 
points, assigned as “B” in the overall SCORAD calculation) .  Subjective assessment of itch and 
sleeplessness is recorded for each symptom by [CONTACT_12906] a visual analogue scale 
(VAS), where 0 is no itch (or sleeplessness) and [ADDRESS_93583] imaginable itch (or 
sleeplessness), with a maximum possible score of 20.  This parameter is assigned as “C” in the 
overall SCORAD  calculation .  The SCORAD is  calculated as: A/5 + 7B/2 + C ( Kunz et al, 
1997) . 
12.2.3. IGA  
The IGA is an assessment scale used in clinical studies to determine severity of AD and clinical response to treatm ent based on a 5- point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 ( severe/ very severe) .  
The proportion of patients who achieve an IGA 0 or 1 score is another key secondary endpoint, 
which will be included in the primary analysis.  
12.2.4. NRS   
Pruritus Numerical rating sca le (NRS): Patients will record once daily and respond to the 
following question, “On a scale of 0 – 10, with [ADDRESS_93584] degree of itch during the previous 24 hours?” Patient 
complia nce on the pruritus NRS will be followed at each clinic visit.  
12.2.5. DLQI  
Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI): The DLQI is a s imple, patient- administered, 
10-question, validated, quality -of-life questionnaire that covers 6 domains including symptoms 
and feeli ngs, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment .  
Response categories include “a  little ,” “a lot,” and “very much” with corresponding scores of 1, 
2, and 3 respectively and “not at all”, “not relevant” responses score d as “0.” Totals range from 0 
to 30 (less to more impairment) and a 5–point change from baseline is considered clinically relevant  ((Basra et al, 2008 ; Finlay and Khan, 1994) .

Glenmark  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 60 of 98 [IP_ADDRESS]. Assessment of Adverse Event  
The Reference Safety Information for this study is the IB section on Guidance for Investigators, 
Undesirable Effects . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient  administered IP that does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment .  An AE can, therefore, be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease 
(new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of an Investigational Product ( IP), 
whether or not related to the IP .  An AE includes any event, regardless of the presumed causality 
between the event and the IP .   
Events that, while not necessarily meeting the definition of AEs, should be treated as such 
because they may be reportable to Regulatory Authorities according to AE reporting regulations, whether or not considered causally associated with IP, include the following:  
• IP overdose, whether acci dental or intentional  
• IP abuse  
• An event occurring from IP withdrawal  
• Any failure of expected pharmacological action  
• Inadvertent or accidental IP exposure (e.g., product leaking or being spi[INVESTIGATOR_85763] a 
patient  or care -giver)  
• Unexpected therapeutic or clinical benefit from the IP  
• Medication errors (i.e., incorrect route of administration, incorrect dosage, use of incorrect product) .   
Events that do not meet the definition of an AE include:  
• Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy); the c ondition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307])  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detect ed at the start of the study that do not worsen 
• The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the patient ’s 
condition. 
GBR 830- 201 
Version 4.0 
Date 16-Feb-2017  
Glenmark  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 61 of 98 [IP_ADDRESS]. Assessment of Severity of Ad verse Events  
The severity of AEs is classified as follows:  
Mild:  • The AE is a transient discomfort and does not interfere in a significant 
manner with the patient  
• The AE resolves spontaneously or may require minimal therapeutic 
intervention 
Moderate:  • The AE produces limited impairment of function and may require therapeutic 
intervention 
• The AE produces no sequelae  
Severe:  • The AE results in a marked impairment of function and may lead to 
temporary inability to resume usual life pattern  
• The AE produces se quelae, which require (prolonged) therapeutic 
intervention 
The criteria for assessing severity are different from those used for seriousness (see Serious 
Adverse Events [ Section  12.4.3] for the definition of an SAE).  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Assessment of Relationship to Study Medication  
The relationship of AEs to study medication is classified as follows: 
Not Related:  A causal relationship between the study treatment and the AE is not a 
reasonable possibility  
Related:  A causal relatio nship between the study treatment and the AE is a reasonable 
possibility  
Items to be considered when assessing the relationship of an AE to the study treatment are:  
• Temporal relationship of the onset of the event to the initiation of the study treatment  
• The course of the event, especially the effect of discontinuation of study treatment or 
reintroduction of study treatment, as applicable  
• Whether the event is known to be associated with the study treatment or with other similar treatments  
• The presence of r isk factors in the study patient  known to increase the occurrence of 
the event  
GBR 830- 201 
Version 4.0 
Date 16-Feb-2017  
Glenmark  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 62 of 98 • The presence of non -study treatment- related factors that are known to be associated 
with the occurrence of the event.  
For each adverse event, the Investigator should answer the following question with Yes or No:  
• Was there a reasonable possibility (evidence) that the drug caused the adverse event?  
A reasonable possibility means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal 
relationship. 
NOTE: For patient s that have not started receiving study medication the answer must be no.  
12.4.3. Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  
NOTE: The term 'life -threatening' in the def inition of 'serious' refers to an event in 
which the patient  was at risk of death at the time of the event .  It does not refer to an 
event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. 
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85764]: In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85765] (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1083]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s 
office or outpatient setting .  Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084] .  
If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], the 
event is serious .  When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]”  occurred or was 
necessary, the AE should be considered serious.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85766] a pre- existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not 
considered an AE. 
• Results in disability/incapacity  
NOTE: The term disability means  a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions .  This definition is not intended to include experiences 
of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and ac cidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) that may 
interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial 
disruption. 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporti ng is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85767] 830- 201 
Version 4.0

Glenmark  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 63 of 98 outcomes listed in the above definition.  These should also be considered serious .  
Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsi ons that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency 
or drug abuse.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs  
Prompt notification of SAEs by [CONTACT_85828] s are met.  
Glenmark has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a product under clinical investigation .  Glenmark will 
comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the 
regulatory authority, IRB/ IEC and Investigators.  
All SAEs must be reported to the Sponsor immediately or within [ADDRESS_93587] information provided below:  
Fax:  + 44 1923 251137 
Email:  [EMAIL_1715]
 
When further information becomes available, the Serious Adverse Event Form should be 
updated with the new information and reported immediately via the same contact [CONTACT_3031].  Follow -up reports must be submitted to the Sponsor until the event resolves, the event stabilizes 
or the event returns to baseline if a baseline value is available.  
Additional information will be requested by [CONTACT_85829].  
12.4.4. Pregnancy  
Any patient  who has a positive pregnancy  test after signing informed consent should be 
withdrawn from the study immediately and study medication should be discontinued immediately.  
Any pregnancy that occurs during study participation must be reported to the Sponsor, using a 
clinical trial pregna ncy report form, immediately or within 24  hours of the Investigator learning 
of its occurrence.  The report should c ontain as much information as possible and should be sent 
to:  
Fax:  + 44 1923 251137 
Email:  [EMAIL_1715]
 
When further information becomes available, the Pregnancy Report Form should be updated with all new information and reported immediately via the same contact [CONTACT_85830] .  The 
GBR 830- [ADDRESS_93588] be foll owed up to determine outcome (including premature termination) and 
status of mother and child, and this information must be sent to the Sponsor as above .  Pregnancy 
complications and elective terminations for medical reasons must be reported as an AE or SA E.  
Spontaneous abortions must be reported as an SAE .  Note: Pregnancy in itself will not be 
considered as an AE or SAE.  
Additional information will be requested by [CONTACT_85829].  
Any SAE occurring in association with a pregnancy brought to the Investigator’s attention after 
the patient  has completed the study and considered by [CONTACT_85831], must be promptly reported to the Sponsor. 
The Investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any female partner of a male 
study patient  who becomes pregnant while participating in this study .  The Investigator will 
record pregnancy information on the appropriate form and submit it to the Sponsor within 1 week  of learning of the partner’s pre gnancy .  The partner will also be followed to determine 
the outcome of the pregnancy .  Information on the status of the mother and child will be 
forwarded to the Sponsor .  Generally, follow -up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following 
the estimated del ivery date .  Any premature termination of the pregnancy will be reported.  
12.4.5. Collection and Recording of AEs and SAEs  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Collection of AEs  
The Investigator or site staff is responsible for detecting, documenting and reporting events that 
meet the definition of a n AE or SAE.  
AEs will be collected from the time of signing the informed consent form until the follow up 
contact.  
SAEs will be collected over the same time period as stated above for AEs .  However, any SAEs 
assessed as related to study participation (e.g. , IP, protocol mandated procedures, invasive tests, 
or change in existing therapy) or related to a concomitant medication that is a  Sponsor product, will be recorded from the time a patient  consents to participate in the study up to and including 
any foll ow up contact .  All SAEs will be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours, as indicated in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
The Investigator will enquire about the occurrence of AEs/SAEs at every visit throughout the 
study (inc luding Follow -up and Early Withdrawal visits where applicable), by [CONTACT_85832]- leading verbal question of the patient  (or care- giver, where appropriate):  
• “Have you had any medical problems since your last visit?”  
All Adverse Events not resolve d by [CONTACT_85833] ’s discontinuation in the study must be followed until the event resolves, the event 
stabilizes or the event returns to baseline if a baseline value is available.

Glenmark  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 65 of 98 [IP_ADDRESS]. Recording of AEs  
All adve rse events regardless of the seriousness, severity or relationship to the study medication 
must be recorded on the Adverse Events pages of eCRF .   
Adverse events that meet the definition of a serious adverse event must be reported on the 
Serious Adverse Ev ent Form provided for this study.  
Adverse events must be documented in clear, unambiguous medical language .  Do not use 
abbreviations or acronyms .   
For each adverse event record only the diagnosis, do not report the characteristic signs and symptoms of th e diagnosis as additional adverse events .   
If a diagnosis is not available record each sign and symptom as an adverse event, when a diagnosis becomes available, update the Adverse Event Case Record Form, to record the relevant diagnosis only. 
In general abnormal findings at screening should be recorded in the patient ’s Medical History or 
in the Adverse Event section of eCRF .  However if, in the Investigators opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the finding is 
clinically significant and represents a condition that was not present at s igning of informed 
consent, then the finding must be reported as an adverse event.  
12.4.6. Clinical Laboratory Tests  
Samples for clinical laboratory tests including hematology, chemistry, serology and urinalysis, 
will be taken after subjects  have fasted for 4 hour s and are summarized in  Appendix  2. 
Patient s should be in a seated or supi[INVESTIGATOR_2526].  The Schedule of 
Events  (Appendix  1) shows the visits and time points at which blood for clinical laboratory tests 
and urine for urinalysis will be collected in the study.  
A central laboratory will be used to measure laboratory parameters that are to be assessed as part 
of the safety analyses for the CSR  and to qualify patients for entry into the study .  Local 
laboratories may be  used in cases of a safety concern during the study, in which case the blood 
sample would be split (or 2 samples collected) to allow both a local laboratory and a central laboratory analy sis.  In such cases, the local laboratory result(s) will be considered part of the 
source documentation only and the central laboratory result will be entered into the clinical 
database.  Local laboratory reports from non- split samples generated to follow safety concerns 
will be contained in the source documentation.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Laboratory and Other Safety Assessment Abnormalities Reported as AEs and 
SAEs  
Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or other 
safety assessments (e.g., ECGs, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those 
that worsen from baseline, and considered to be clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the Investigator are to be recorded as AEs or SAEs.

12.4.7. Vital Signs  
Vital sign measuremen ts (i.e., systolic and diastolic blood pressure [BP] [mmHg], pulse [beats 
per minute], body temperature [in centigrade]) will be obtained at the visits designated on the 
Schedule of Events  (Appendix  1) by a valid ated method .  Supi[INVESTIGATOR_1662] -supi[INVESTIGATOR_85768] [ADDRESS_93589] be 
consulted for necessary action, which will be recorded.   
12.4.8. Physical Examination  
Physical examinations will be performed as designated on the Schedule of Events  (Appendix  1).  
An abbreviated physical examination will be performed at all time -points except for screening 
where a full physical examination will be performed , as mentioned in Section  12.1.2.  Brief 
clinical examination of the patient  will be conducted by a qualified medical designate on duty, 
and as defined in the Appendix  1 of the protocol .  Patient ’s height will be measured at screening 
only.  In the event of detection of any abnormality during clinical examination, the Clinical 
Investigator must be consulted for necessary action, which will be recorded .  Docum entation of 
the physical examination will be included in the physical examination section of the eCRF .  Only 
changes from screening physical examination findings that meet the definition of an AE will be 
recorded on the AEs CRF.  
12.4.9. ECG  
Supi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 12- lead electroc ardiograms will be obtained as designated on the Schedule of Events  
(Appendix  1), and as per methods mentioned in the relevant  SOPs and appropriate instrument 
user manuals .  Patient s must be in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_19636] a period of five minutes prior to the 
ECG .   
A physician will have to perform a clinical assessment of each 12 -lead ECG .  PR, QT and QTc 
intervals, QRS duration and heart rate will be recorded.  The QT interval will be corrected for heart rate (QTc) using Frederica’s formula .  A copy of the ECG tracing has to be stored as source 
data.  A ny clinically significant abnormality  detected  by [CONTACT_85835] . 
An ECG abnormality may meet the criteria of an AE as described in this protocol (see AEs [Section  12.4.2]) and the eCRF Completion Guidelines .  In these instances, the AE 
corresponding to the ECG abnormality will be recorded on the AEs CRF.

Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs [ Section  [IP_ADDRESS]]).  
12.4.10. Infusion Reactions  
Infusion reactions will be characterized as either acute or delayed .  Any infusion reaction 
occurring within 24 hours of drug infusion will be considered an acute reaction and any reaction occu rring from 24 hours to 14 days following the drug infusion will be considered a delayed 
infusion reaction.  Both types of reaction will be further characterized depending on the severity 
of accompanying signs and symptom s as Grade 1 to 5 as classified by C ommon terminology 
criteria for adverse events  (CTCAE ) Version 4.03. 
Vital signs (temperature, pulse and blood pressure -systolic and diastolic) will be recorded prior 
to and every 30 minutes during the infusion.  The patient s should be stabilized prior to 
discharging from study site .  During the infusion, patient s will be monitored for the signs and 
symptoms of acute infusion reactions .  In the event of an infusion reaction, the rate of infusion 
may be decreased and the duration extended at the Investigator ’s discretion, for patient  safety .  
Staff  trained in emergency care treatment and a facility equipped with emergency set that is 
readily available in the room where subjects are being dosed  should be utilized for the study .  
Systemic hypersensitivity reactions will be managed according to treatment protocols that are in effect at the investigational site .  In the absence of such a protocol, the Mount Sinai protocol for 
management of infusion reactions can be used.  
12.4.11. Confirmation of Medical Care by [CONTACT_85836] s to inform site personnel when they are planning to receive 
medical care by [CONTACT_20427] .  At each visit, the Investigator /study coordinator  will ask the 
patient  whether he/she has received medical care by  [CONTACT_3212] .  When the patient  is going to receive medical care by [CONTACT_3213], the Investigator /study coordinator , with the consent of the patient, will inform the 
other physician tha t the patient  is participating in the clinical study.  
13. DATA ANALYSIS AND ST ATISTICAL METHODS  
The statistical analysis will be coordinated by [CONTACT_85786] .  A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will 
be written to provide details of the analysis, along with specific ations for tables, listings, and 
figures to be produced.  The SAP will be finalized prior to the database lock at the latest.  Any 
changes from the analyses planned in the SAP will be justified in the CSR.  
All analyses will be performed using SAS® Version 9.1.3 or above.  
Prior to database lock, a final blinded data review meeting will be held to allow a review of the 
clinical study data and to verify the data that will be used for analysis set classification .  A 
meeting to determine analysis set classifications may also be held prior to database lock.

The results of the study will be reported in CSR in accordance with the ICH guidance .  Glenmark  
or delegate will prepare an integrated clinical and PK report .   
13.1.1. Sample Size  
No formal sample size calculation will be performed for this study .  The sample size chosen is 
based on experience from previous studies of similar nature .  Patients who are permanently 
discontinued from study drug due to reasons other than an AE and before the first post baseline skin biops ies (Visit 7) or before receiv ing two doses of study drug  (Visit 7) , will not be 
considered evaluable for the Biol ogical Analysis Set (see Section  13.2) .  The sample size of 60 to 
80 adult patients with AD randomized in ratio of 3: 1 (GBR 830 vs placebo)  with approximately 
40 evaluable patients  is considered to be sufficient to provide descriptive information on the PK, 
safety, tolerability and potential efficacy of GBR 830. 
A patient will be considered evaluable if he /she completes the Day [ADDRESS_93590]-baseline skin biopsy (Visit 7) and received two doses of study drug (Visit 7). 
Details of analyses will be specified in the SAP . 
13.2. Analysis Sets 
Detailed criteria for analysis sets will be documented in the SAP and the alloca tion of patient s to 
analysis sets will be determined prior to database hard -lock.  
Full Analysis Set (FAS)  
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will consist of all patient s who are randomized and received at least 
1 dose of study drug .   
Biological Activity Set (BAS ) 
The Biological Activity Set (BAS) will consist of all FAS patients who have at least one post-
baseline skin biopsy (Visit 7), and received 2 doses of study drug .  The primary analyses on 
biomarkers of disease activity obtained from biopsy will be based o n the BAS . 
Safety Analysis Set (SAF)  
The Safety Analysis Set (SAF) consists of all patient s who took at least 1 dose of study 
medication, and will be used for safety analyses .

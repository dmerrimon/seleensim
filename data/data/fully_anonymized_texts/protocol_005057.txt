to Treatment (SBIRT), Compared to In-Person SBIRT for Peripartum Women.  
Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_826096],  MD, MSCR 
 
1.0 Objectives / Specific Aims  
 
Specific  Aim 1 
 
The goal of Specific Aim  1 is to develop an effective remote mental  health and substance use Screening, Brief 
Intervention and Referral  to Treatment (SBIRT) program  for pregnant and postpartum  women. The objectives 
of this current application for Specific Aim [ADDRESS_1145849] of a text-message based SBIRT and 
home-based telemedicine services for pregnant and postpartum women – called Listening to Women (LTW), 
compared to treatment as usual (TAU) with the primary objective to provide effect size estimates for a larger RCT.  
 
Specific Aim 1: Conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], small -scale randomized controlled trial to examine feasibility and preliminary 
efficacy of LTW, compared to TAU. Outcomes related to feasibility include percentage of eligible patients recruited, study attrition, study retention, and mental health and substance use treatment appointment 
attendance. Outcomes related to preliminary efficacy will include participation in screening, referral and treatment at baseline, compared to TAU.  
 
The central hypotheses for Specific Aim 1 are that the study is feasible and women assigned to LTW will be 
more likely to screen positive and successfully obtain treatment in less time, compared to those that are 
assigned to TAU.  
 
Specific  Aim 2 
Upon completion of Specific  Aim 1, the goal of Specific  Aim 2 is to evaluate the effectiveness  of a remote mental 
health and substance use Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral  to Treatment (SBIRT) program  for pregnant 
and postpartum women. The objectives of this current application for Specific Aim [ADDRESS_1145850] of 
a text-message based SBIRT and home-based telemedicine services for pregnant and postpartum women – 
called Listening to Women (LTW), compared to treatment as usual (TAU) with the primary objective to include attendance to treatment at baseline, compared to TAU.  
 
Specific Aim 2: Conduct a randomized controlled trial to examine the effectiveness  of LTW, compared to TAU. 
Outcomes related to effectiveness include attendance to treatment at baseline , compared to TAU.  
 
The central  hypotheses  are that a greater  proportion of women assigned  to LTW will attend treatment following 
a referral, compared to TAU.  
 
Specific  Aim 3 
 
The goal of Specific  Aim 3 is to gather data related to maternal  and newborn diagnosis  codes, health care 
utilization, and costs for our study participants with Medicaid.  
 
Specific Aim 3: We will compare Medicaid data among those assigned  to LTW vs. TAU.  
Version  #11 07/29/[ADDRESS_1145851] lower health care utilization and costs  during 
the postpartum year, compared to TAU.  
 
 
2.0 Background  
During pregnancy and the year postpartum (perinatal period), mental health problems are common such as 
mood, anxiety and substance use disorders. Perinatal mood and anxiety disorders are the most common 
complication  of pregnancy  and childbirth affecting at least  1 in 7 perinatal  women [1]. Perinatal  substance use is 
also common, and the prevalence is increasing. Perinatal opi[INVESTIGATOR_826097] 4-fold over 
the past decade [2]. Perinatal mental health and substance use are associated with significant maternal, obstetric, infant and child morbidity [3-9], and mortality [10-14]. 
Given the prevalence and impact of perinatal mood, anxiety and substance use disorders, and evidence 
demonstrating mitigation of its effects on maternal and child health through psychotherapy and psychopharmacotherapy [16,17], a multitude of professional societies recommend universal screening of pregnant and/or postpartum women using validated screening tools and provision of adequate mental health treatment and/or treatment referrals [18-22]. Unfortunately, however, the vast majority of women with mood, anxiety or substance use problems will remain under -diagnosed and under -treated [23-24]. Less than 50% of 
peripartum women with a mental illness, and less than 20% of women with a substance use problem are identified in clinical  settings  [6]. Among these women, less than 15% receive treatment, fewer than 10% receive 
adequate treatment and less than 5% achieve remission [4]. 
While mental health screening is widely accepted by [CONTACT_826114]/Gyn providers [25,26], further 
work is needed to facilitate implementation of screenings in Ob/Gyn practices that translate to treatment 
participation. However, key provider and systems -level barriers to treatment exist and include: 1) lack of 
screening in obstetric  settings  and lack of provider training in technical  aspects  of mental  health and substance 
use disorder care [26-28] and relevant communication skills [29]; 2) absence of standardized processes and procedures for integrated obstetric and mental health and substance use disorder treatment [29,30]; 3) lack of 
mental health providers willing to treat pregnant women [30]; 4) lack of referral networks [29-33]; and, 5) 
inadequate capacity and resources to ensure mental health evaluation, treatment, follow -up, and care 
coordination [29- 35]. 
To address  these barriers we designed, implemented and pi[INVESTIGATOR_826098] (see 3.0 Intervention to be Studied) as part of a quality improvement project. Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_826099] 87.78% (273/311) of women approached agreeing to take part in LTW and 
completing the text-message screening. Preliminary data comparing LTW (N=273) to a historical dataset 
extracted from the EHR including peripartum women receiving in-person SBIRT in the same clinic (N=2,988) found a significantly greater proportion of women enrolled in LTW screened positive (81.15% vs. 33.33%; 
X
2=169.50, p<0.0001), were referred for treatment (76.12% vs. 57.63%; X2=18.03, p<0.0001), and received 
treatment (94.91% vs. 16.04%; X2=245.41, p<0.0001), compared to women receiving in-person SBIRT.  
 
While  these preliminary  data are exciting, a randomized control  trial will be necessary  to determine the feasibility 
and efficacy of LTW. The goal of Specific Aim [ADDRESS_1145852], 
use data yielded by [CONTACT_32360][INVESTIGATOR_55510] “de-bug” the methodology, and to assess optimal strategies to executing the RCT [51- R34]. 
 
3.0 Intervention to be studied  
LTW is a mobile phone -based program designed to enhance delivery of Screening, Brief Intervention, and 
Referral  to Treatment (SBIRT), an evidence-based approach for mental  health and substance  use screening 
Version  #11 07/29/202 4  
and treatment for perinatal  women [36-38]. This program  was created as a result of key informant interviews  with 
obstetric  providers  and pregnant and postpartum  women with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2537]. Feedback  from these groups 
informed the development of LTW. 
 
The program utilizes mobile phone text message-based screenings with immediate automated feedback, 
paired with remote care coordination and, if appropriate, home-based telemedicine mental health and 
substance use disorder treatment services. Women coming into routine prenatal care (see Recruitment) are 
eligible to take part in the study. Those agreeing to take part are sent a text message with routine mental health and substance use screening questions  (see LTW protocol  for screening questions)  currently employed 
as part of standard of care. These screening questions are the SBIRT which is a survey with 9 questions related to depression, anxiety, substance abuse (alcohol, cigarettes, other drugs including prescription 
medication), and domestic violence (see LTW protocol). However, LTW uses text-message based screening 
with phone based assessment and referral to treatment, and TAU is an in-person screening and referral to treatment assessment. The same screening tools are used to assess substance abuse and mental health problems in LTW and TAU. Once they complete these screenings via text message, they are provided immediate feedback about their scores, and recommendations (see LTW protocol for automated messages). Contact [CONTACT_21561]’s care coordinator is also provided along with her availability i.e., Monday – 
Friday 8am -5pm. In addition, while specific questions about suicidal ideation are not asked via the text 
message screening, all participants receive a text message: “If you are ever experiencing a mental health 
emergency, such  as a desire  to harm  yourself or others, please go to your nearest emergency  room. If you are 
feeling suicidal you can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline 1-800 -273-8255 anytime” (see LTW 
protocol for automated messages). 
Information about the screening is stored in a REDCap database. A care coordinator is reviewing this 
information Monday through Friday 8am -5pm and texts or calls any patient that screens positive for mental 
health or substance use that requires  further assessment as  would be done in-person  during routine clinical 
care (see LTW protocol describing branching logic from screens and clinical risk categories). The care coordinator  contacts  the patient and  further assesses  their mental  health and substance use symptoms  and 
needs for resources and/or treatment. If the participant would benefit from further mental health and/or substance use evaluation and treatment, the care coordinator schedules the patient for a home-based telemedicine visit. The care coordinator communicates all screening information in the Electronic Health Record (EHR) for all providers to review, and if applicable includes information about the scheduled appointment or resources provided.  
4.0 Study Endpoints  
Specific  Aim 1: 
 
Primary  pi[INVESTIGATOR_826100]:  
Completion of SBIRT: We will compare the proportion of participants  that complete a screen for mental 
health and substance use, the proportion of those screening positive that are referred to treatment, and the proportion of those referred to treatment that had at least one mental health and/or substance use disorder treatment appointment among those assigned to LTW, compared to TAU. 
Time to Treatment: We will measure the time from completion of screening positive to time of first 
mental  health or substance use treatment appointment (if a referral  to treatment was appropriate) among those 
assigned to LTW, compared to TAU. 
Reduction in Mental Health Symptoms: A mong women referred for treatment, we will compare the 
mean change in the Edinburgh Postnatal  Depression Scale (EPDS) among those assigned to LTW,  compared 
to TAU. Of note, the suicidal ideation question (item #10) will be omitted from this questionnaire.  
Reduction in Substance Use: Among women referred for treatment, we will compare change in 
substance  use frequency  and amount as measured by [CONTACT_304117]-Modified Assist  (see LTW protocol)  among 
those assigned to LTW, compared to TAU. 
Improved M aternal  Functioning: Among women referred for treatment, we will compare the change in 
maternal functioning measured by [CONTACT_826115] 36 (SF-36v2) among those assigned to LTW, compared to TAU. 
Version  #11 07/29/202 4  
 
Secondary pi[INVESTIGATOR_826101]:  
Recruitment: We will determine the proportion of patients  who agree to participate  as compared to the 
total number solicited to enroll for each recruitment approach. 
Attrition: W e will examine the proportion of study  participants  that prematurely  terminate i.e., do not 
complete screenings, or are unable to be contact[CONTACT_826116]/or treatment. 
Study  r etention: We will determine the proportion of study  participants  that complete all assessment 
points associated with the protocol.  
Treatment A ttendance: We will collect  data from the EHR to determine the proportion of participants 
that attended a mental health or substance use treatment appointment. 
Improved H ealth-Related Social  Needs: Among women referred for treatment, we will compare the 
change in health-related social needs measured by [CONTACT_826117] (AHC) Health- 
Related Social Needs (HRSN) Screening Tool among those assigned to LTW, compared to TAU. 
Voice Bi omarkers: Voice  analysis  will be completed using an online platform  SurveyLex  (owned by 
[CONTACT_826118], Inc.). Among women  referred for treatment, we will analyze voice  recordings  for characteristics 
(acoustic, linguistic, or meta feature) which may be compared between those assigned to LTW and those 
assigned to TAU, and compared to other measures  collected in either LTW  or TAU including EPDS, NIDA 
Modified Assist, and/or AHC HRSN.  
 
Specific  Aim 2: 
Primary  Outcome:  
 
Attendance to Treatment: treatment attendance (defined as attending at least 1 or more visits with a 
mental  health and/or  substance use disorder  (SUD)  treatment provider  during pregnancy  and the postpartum 
year) 
Secondary Outcomes  
Reduction in Mental Health Symptoms: Among women referred for treatment, we will compare the 
mean change in the Edinburgh Postnatal  Depression Scale (EPDS), GAD -7 Anxiety  and CSSRS  among those 
assigned to LTW, compared to TAU. Of note, the suicidal ideation question (item #10) will be omitted from the 
EPDS questionnaire.  
Reduction in Substance Use: A mong women referred for treatment, we will compare change in 
substance  use frequency  and amount as measured by [CONTACT_304117] -Modified Assist  (see LTW protocol) and TLFB 
among those assigned to LTW, compared to TAU. 
Improved M aternal  Functioning: Among women referred for treatment, we will compare the change in 
maternal functioning measured by [CONTACT_826115] 36 (SF-36v2) among those assigned to LTW, compared to TAU. 
Improved H
 ealth-Related Social  Needs: Among women referred for treatment, we will compare the 
change in health-related social needs measured by [CONTACT_826117] (AHC) Health- 
Related Social Needs (HRSN) Screening Tool among those assigned to LTW, compared to TAU. 
For the outcome variables for specific aims [ADDRESS_1145853] data from the EHR including SBIRT data, if 
the participant was referred to treatment, where they were referred to treatment, if they attended a mental health or substance use treatment appointment and where they attended the appointment, how many appointments  they attended, and the numbers  of days  from date of SBIRT completion to date of mental  health 
or substance use treatment appointment. 
 
Specific  Aim 3: 
The data that will be collected on study  participants  with Medicaid include: 
Number and costs of prenatal care visits 
Number and costs  of postpartum  care visits  
Number and costs  of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_826102]  #11 07/29/202 4  
Number and costs of ED visits during  pregnancy  and the postpartum  year 
Number and costs of newborn care visits  (outpatient, inpatient and ED) in the first year of life 
Maternal  diagnosis  codes  for prenatal  care visits,  postpartum  care visits,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_826103], inpatient and ED visits  
 
 
 
5.0 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria/ Study Population  
Inclusion criteria include: 1) age 18-41; 2) currently pregnant or postpartum; 3) if pregnant, receiving prenatal 
care; 4) English fluency; 5) owner of a cell phone with SMS text-message based capability; 6) access to WIFI 
and a device to allow  audio and video  teleconferencing; 7)  able to provide informed consent. Exclusion  criteria: 
None  
 
6.0 Number  of Subjects  
A total of 450 participants will be randomized in Specific Aim 1 (n=100) and Specific Aim 2 (n=350). To randomize [ADDRESS_1145854] will be submitted to obtain a recruitment report of MUSC patients  who potentially  meet eligibility  criteria. The recruitment report will 
include a search for pregnant and postpartum women. The report will include mrn, age, race, ethnicity, date of 
prenatal care visit, date of postpartum visit, delivery date, ob/gyn provider name, MyChart account (Yes/No), cell phone number, email  address  and current ICD-9 or 10 diagnoses. The purpose of the ICD codes will  be to 
ensure we are approaching enough women with substance use disorders, and/or a mood or anxiety disorder diagnoses, and therefore likely to screen positive on either an in-person or text-message SBIRT screening. In addition, ICD  codes will  be used for urn stratification at randomization. Any patients who have not opted out of 
being contact[CONTACT_826119]. If a cell 
phone number is not available, the message with a link to a RedCap eligibility survey will be sent via email or MyChart message. The study team will not cold- contact [CONTACT_313149]-out of receiving 
contact [CONTACT_289273]. Our PI’s clinic policy is to ask all patients if they would like to be contact[CONTACT_826120]. The vast majority of women prefer to be contact[CONTACT_826121] a text message. Therefore, we believe cold-contact[CONTACT_826122].  
All other patients will be contact[CONTACT_826123]. If the potential participant’s provider has agreed to have the study team contact [CONTACT_195345], a phone call or text message will be sent to the potential participant inviting them to take part in the study. If a cell phone number is  not available, the message  with a link to a RedCap eligibility survey  will be sent via email. 
If the potential participant does not respond to the phone call, text or email, the study team may also notify 
potential participants that a message was sent to them via MyChart. The text message (or email/MyChart 
message) will include a link to a brief RedCap eligibility survey. For those meeting the eligibility screening 
criteria, the RA/RC will schedule a time to verify eligibility criteria and review the informed consent either remotely or in-person.  
Another method of recruitment will include Women’s  Health Services clinics,  where after women are identified 
as pregnant or postpartum by  [CONTACT_102]’s nurse or provider, they will be approached by  [CONTACT_2362], with 
the provider’s permission, to take part in the study. Additionally, research staff may do a review of Women’s Health Services provider schedules and patient charts in EPIC to identify potentially eligible women for inclusion. Research staff will approach patients when they arrive for their regularly scheduled appointment. 
Version  #11 07/29/202 4  
We will also recruit  from the MUSC  antepartum  unit and the mother -baby  [CONTACT_273080]. Patients  will be approached by 
[CONTACT_3476], with the provider’s permission, to take part in the study. Additionally, research staff may do a 
review of the antepartum and mother -baby [CONTACT_826124]. Research staff will approach patients while they are staying on the antepartum 
and mother -baby [CONTACT_661388]. If the patient agrees  to taking part in the study  the RA will consent the participant and 
complete baseline procedures. 
Another way to recruit is the potentially eligible patients in the PI [INVESTIGATOR_7706]-Is practices will be informed and 
approached about the study  as the PI [INVESTIGATOR_7706]-Is feel is appropriate. Participants  will also be recruited via study 
advertisement (e.g., flyers) and online postings (e.g., social media, linkedin). 
 
9.[ADDRESS_1145855] via one 
of the following modalities: 1) Remote or in person electronic consent (e-consent) via REDCap (if remote, e- consent will be facilitated with a discussion over the phone or via video), 2) Remote consent via doxy.me 
facilitated with either  a discussion over  the phone or video connection via doxy.me, 3)  Mailed (paper) consent 
facilitated with a discussion over the phone, or 4) in person consent (e.g., in clinic).  
 
All participants  will be provided with a hard copy  and/or  an electronic  copy  of the consent form. Participants  will 
be informed that participation in this research is strictly voluntary. Informed consent will include a detailed 
description of the purpose and the procedures of the study emphasizing our policy regarding privacy and 
confidentiality and an opportunity for the individual to ask any questions or voice concerns. Signatures on the consent form may be obtained with paper  and pen OR electronically  via REDCap  or doxy.me. Participants  who 
do not have access to the required technology to complete consent remotely via REDCap or doxy.me will be given the option to complete consent via mail facilitated with a discussion over the phone. 
10.0 Study  Design / Methods 
 
Specific aim 1: A two arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_4265] (N=100) with 2:1 allocation will examine feasibility and preliminary efficacy 
of LTW, compared to TAU. Specific aim 2: A RCT (N=350) with 2:1 allocation will examine effectiveness of 
LTW, compared to TAU. As of the approval of amendment #12 the allocation will switch to 1(LTW):2(TAU) for 
specific aim  2. Recruitment will  primarily occur  proactively and remotely  via the EHR.  We will conduct a weekly 
EHR search via a recruitment report for all new  pregnant and postpartum patients in the past week. The report 
will include mrn, age, race, ethnicity, date of prenatal care visit, date of postpartum visit, delivery date, ob/gyn 
provider name, MyChart account (Yes/No), cell phone number, email address and current ICD -[ADDRESS_1145856] attempts  at the time of recruitment. If 
the potential participant has not opted out of being contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], or  the potential participant’s  provider  has agreed 
to have the study team contact [CONTACT_195345], a phone call will be made or message will be sent via text, email or MyChart message to the potential participant inviting them to take part in the study. This invitation will 
include clear opt out procedures  should the patient not wish to be contact[CONTACT_826125]. If interested, participants will complete a screening online via REDCap to determine study  eligibility (see 
above for inclusion criteria). After completing preliminary determination of eligibility, if eligible and interested in 
participating in the study, participants will be scheduled for a time to complete informed consent (see 9.0 
Consent Process).  
 
Following consent, all participants will subsequently be text messaged and/or emailed a REDCap link, accessible via smartphone, tablet, or computer to complete study assessments. Assessments that need to be 
completed by [CONTACT_826126].me  or telephone. For specific 
aim 1 participants only, participants will also complete voice analysis through Surveylex. Participants will be presented with a questionnaire consisting of one task to complete through the Surveylex online form. One task 
to be answered and entered as text, and three tasks involving voice recordings in response to prompts. The 
tasks in the online form include the following: Text question (one task): 1) What is your participant ID?; Voice 
recording (three tasks): During voice recording tasks, the participant will be reminded that there is no right or  
Version  #11 07/29/202 4  
wrong answer  for these tasks and that they may choose to skip the question or  stop their answer  at any time 1) 
Please repeat this phrase: “The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dogs.” (10 seconds) 2) Please describe 
yesterday from start to finish (30 seconds) and 3) Please describe what brings you happi[INVESTIGATOR_008] (30 seconds).  
Assessments will occur  at baseline (following consent). Participants will be randomized to LTW or TAU, 
respectively.  
Survey assessments are estimated to take 30 minutes to complete and will be administered remotely via 
REDCap through our established procedures and via doxy.me or telephone for interview assessments. Voice 
analysis for specific aim 1 participants only takes less than 10 minutes to complete and can be completed 
remotely. Participants will be compensated via electronic gift cards which will be emailed or texted to 
participants. Participants will receive $25 for completion of the baseline assessments. To encourage 
participants  to complete all 3 surveys,  participants  will be paid an additional  $20 if they complete all 3 surveys 
(baseline).

Specific aim 3: We will gather healthcare utilization data on our study participants who have Medicaid 
insurance. The MUSC study team will extract the maternal Medicaid IDs from our study participants with 
Medicaid insurance from the EHR.  We will share a list of these maternal  Medicaid IDs with Medicaid, and they 
will return data related to maternal and newborn diagnosis codes, health care utilization and costs for these 
participants i.e., prenatal care visits, postpartum care visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_826104]. The MUSC study team will send the maternal Medicaid ID’s of study participants to 
Medicaid in a password protected spreadsheet. Medicaid will send the MUSC study team a password 
protected spreadsheet of  data. The spreadsheet of data Medicaid will send  back  to MUSC will be coded since  
Version  #11 07/29/202 4  
it will contain the Medicaid ID's of participants.  
 
The Medicaid ID is the only link to subjects in the study. The document linking Medicaid ID’s and our study 
participants  will be stored on a University  secure  network  drive  or in MUSC  BOX.  The linking document will be 
stored separately from the study data and only trained study personnel will have access to the linking document.  
 
Study  data will be stored on a University  secure network  drive  or in MUSC  BOX. The  spreadsheet of data that

The MUSC study  team  will have access to the Medicaid ID’s as well as Medicaid.  
 
11.0 Data  Management  
 
Data Management  
 
Regarding questionnaire data, data will be obtained for research purposes only. All data will be collected, stored, and managed via REDCap, which is a secure, web-based application designed exclusively to support 
data capture for research studies. REDCap provides secure, web-based flexible applications, including real 
time validation rules  with automated data type and range checks at the time of entry. The underlying database 
is hosted in a secure data center at MUSC, a secure environment for data systems and servers on campus, and includes redundancy, failover capability, backups and extensive security checks. The system has several layers of protection including user/group account management, "Data Access Groups" which allow data to be entered by [CONTACT_253757], audit trails for all 
changes, queries and reports, and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption. The recruitment report project will 
be housed in RedCap and will only be accessible to the research team. The research team will only have 
access to the RedCap recruitment project while actively enrolling for the study. The recruitment report will be stored in a separate RedCap project from the project containing our research data.  
Name [CONTACT_436906] [CONTACT_826127], in accordance with HIPAA. All data will be identified only by [CONTACT_63903] 
(participant IDs). Participant IDs will be linked to participants’ names in a password-protected file that is accessible only to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_66171]. Voice sample data gathered through SurveyLex for the participants  in specific  aim 1  only, is  stored by [CONTACT_826128]’s  HIPAA compliant Microsoft Azure servers 
managed by [CONTACT_826118]. Access to this data is limited to research staff by a single unique username [CONTACT_2383]. Voice features collected through Surveylex will be download and stored on an MUSC Box account, 
accessible only to study staff.  
 
For specific  aim 3, the Medicaid ID is the only link to subjects  in the study. The document linking  Medicaid ID’s 
and our study participants will be stored on a University secure network drive or in MUSC BOX. The linking 
document will be stored separately from the study data and only trained study personnel will have access to the linking document. Study data will be stored on a University secure network drive or in MUSC BOX. The spreadsheet of data that Medicaid will send the MUSC study team will be password protected. Only trained study personnel will have access to the password protected data spreadsheet. The MUSC study team will 
have access to the Medicaid ID’s as well as Medicaid.  
 
 
12.0 Provisions to Monitor  the Data  to Ensure the Safety of Subjects (if applicable)  
This plan is based on the recommendations in NIDA’s “Guidelines for Developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a Data and Safety 
Monitoring Plan” (https://www.drugabuse.gov/funding/clinical -research/guidelines -developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]-data-safety - 
monitoring -plan).  
Version  #11 07/29/202 4  
Summary of the Protocol  
The goal of this work is to develop an effective remote mental health and substance use Screening, Brief 
Intervention and Referral  to Treatment (SBIRT) program  for pregnant and postpartum  women. The  objectives 
of this current application are 1.) to conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_4248] a text-message based SBIRT and home-based telemedicine services for pregnant and postpartum women – called Listening to Women (LTW), compared to 
treatment as  usual  (TAU) with  the primary objective to provide effect size estimates  for a larger RCT and 2.) to 
conduct a larger scale RCT to examine the effectiveness of LTW, compared to TAU. 
Trial Management  
The study will be managed from the Women’s Reproductive Behavioral Health Division within the Department 
of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC). Recruitment, data 
collection, data management, and treatment provision will be coordinated  and centrally  managed at our research 
lab at MUSC and will be implemented within local MUSC clinics.  
Data  Management  and Analysis  
Participants will enter data in REDCap, a secure, web-based application designed exclusively to support data 
capture for research studies. REDCap provides: 1) an intuitive interface for data entry (with data validation); 2) audit trails  for tracking data manipulation and export procedures; 3)  automated export procedures  for seamless 
data downloads to common statistical packages (SPSS, SAS, Stata, R); 4) procedures for importing data from 
external sources; and 5) advanced features, such as branching logic and calculated fields. These procedures 
are effective in minimizing data entry errors (e.g., missing or errant data). The data analysis plan is outlined above.  
 
Quality Assurance  
Accuracy and completeness of the data collected will be ensured by  [CONTACT_540507]. The REDCap system does 
not accept  outliers, illogical response patterns, etc. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_826105]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_436883]. Initial data analyses will examine distributions of variable scores and comparability of baseline characteristics across conditions in case analyses need to be adjusted for these. Confidentiality procedures are outlined above.  
Regulatory Issues  
All serious AEs will be reported to the MUSC Committee on Human Research within 48 hrs. Follow -up of all 
unexpected and serious AEs will also be reported. All AEs will be reviewed weekly by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_184197]. Any  significant actions  taken by [CONTACT_1036], and protocol changes  will be relayed to the funding agency. 
We estimate the significant AE rate to be 5% or less. Potential conflicts of interest (COI) will be reported using the SRNT rules for disclosure as well as the rules of MUSC’s COI committee. 
 
Trial Safety  
Process of AE/SAE collection, assessing  by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or  medical  monitor and reporting 
AEs and SAEs occurring during the course of the study will be collected, documented, and reported in 
accordance with protocol and IRB reporting requirements. All research staff involved with adverse event 
reporting will receive general and protocol specific AE/SAE training including identification, assessment and evaluation, and documentation and reporting training. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_826106]- report. This information will be provided to the PI, who will be 
responsible for AE/SAE assessment and evaluation including a determination of seriousness and study relatedness.  
Definition of AE and SAE 
Adverse events  are defined as any untoward medical  occurrence that may present itself during  treatment or 
administration of an intervention, and which may or may not have a causal relationship with the treatment. Serious adverse events are defined as any medical occurrence that:  
1. Results  in death,  
2. Is life-threatening,  
Version  #11 07/29/202 4  
3. Requires  inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_29350],  
4. Results  in persistent  or significant disability/incapacity,  
5. Is a congenital  anomaly/birth defect.  
OR 
6. Requires  intervention to prevent one of the above  outcomes  
 
Documentation and Reporting  
AEs/SAEs are documented and reported as per protocol and IRB requirements. Research staff will identify 
adverse events and obtain all available information to assess severity, seriousness, study relatedness, 
expectedness, outcome and the need for change or discontinuation in the study intervention. Adverse events 
are generally documented on AE Logs  and AE Case Report Forms  (CRFs). Additional  relevant AE information, 
if available, will be documented in a progress  note in the research record as appropriate to allow  monitoring  and 
evaluation of the AE. If the AE meets  the definition for serious, appropriate SAE protocol  specific  reporting forms 
are completed and disseminated to the appropriate persons and within the designated timeframes. For each AE/SAE recorded, the research staff will follow  the AE/SAE until resolution, stabilization or until the subject is no 
longer in the study as stated in the protocol.  
When a reportable SAE is identified, the research coordinator will initiate an SAE form, and the following 
individuals will be notified by [CONTACT_465682] 24 hours of the site’s initial notification of the SAE: 
i. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_826107], consultation, assessment and documentation as appropriate of the 
SAE.  
ii. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_826108] (IRB) and complete the AE 
report form in conjunction with the study  coordinator. The MUSC  IRB meets  monthly  and 
communication with the IRB is through email, memos, official IRB forms, and online reporting.  
iii. The NIDA  program  officer. Any adverse event  will be reported to NIDA  in an individual 
adverse event report. 
iv. The data safety  monitoring board members  
If complete information is not available when the initial 24-hour SAE report is disseminated, follow -up 
information will be gathered to enable a complete assessment and outcome of the event. This information may 
include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_139257], autopsy reports, clinic records, etc.  The research coordinator will attach 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_826109] [ADDRESS_1145857] learns of the event. The MUSC IRB AE reporting requirements are as follows: All deaths 
that occur during the study or [ADDRESS_1145858] at the next meeting. 
AE/SAE follow  up plan 
All unexpected AE and SAEs will be monitored until resolved.  A detailed summary  of all AEs will be prepared 
weekly by [CONTACT_23164]. The candidate and the mentorship/consultation team will evaluate the progress of the study at biweekly study team meetings, including periodic assessments of data quality and timeliness, participant recruitment and retention,  participant risk versus  benefit, and other factors  that can affect 
study  outcome. We will also consider  factors  external  to the study, such  as scientific  or therapeutic  developments 
that may have an impact on the safety of participants or the ethics of the study. All AEs are reviewed annually by [CONTACT_16627] (DSMB) and yearly by [CONTACT_1201]. Any significant actions taken by [CONTACT_434772]. 
Version  #11 07/29/202 4  
Data  and Safety Monitoring Plan Administration  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_184202]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_826110], unexpected distributions or responses, and outliers. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_826111]/SAEs. A DSM report will be filed with the IRB and funding agency on a yearly basis, unless greater than expected problems occur. The report will include participant characteristics, retention and 
disposition of study participants, quality assurance issues and reports of AEs, significant/unexpected AEs and 
serious AEs. We will report efficacy at the end of the trial.  
13.0 Risks to Subjects  
 
This is considered a minimal  risk study. Minimal  risk means  the probability  and magnitude of harm  or discomfort 
anticipated in the research are not greater  in and of themselves  other than those ordinarily  encountered in daily 
life or during  performance of routine physical  or psychological  examinations  or tests.  The LTW screening tool is 
the same  tool that is used  in clinical  practice, the only difference is in its delivery. The potential  risks in this study 
include those related to: a) confidentiality; b) frustration; and c) emotional distress.  
 
a) Confidentiality: Participants  will be made aware  of limits  to confidentiality  at the beginning of screening 
and when reviewing study procedures/during informed consent which include report of suicidal or 
homicidal intent or report of abuse or neglect. If the participant reports substance use during pregnancy 
or suicidal or homicidal intent or abuse/neglect, [CONTACT_199770] will take appropriate action by [CONTACT_12550] a psychiatric assessment  and facilitating appropriate treatment. Additional  appropriate  actions as outlined 
by [CONTACT_826129], NIH,  and the State of South Carolina, may also  include contact[CONTACT_826130],  authorities  and/or  pursuing involuntary  commitment at a mental  health or substance use 
disorder treatment facility. If participants present no imminent danger but also need more extensive treatment of mental health or substance use concerns, appropriate care will be facilitated. 
b) Frustration: Participants may become frustrated while completing study assessments. Participants will 
be informed that they may refuse  to answer any question(s) that they do not wish to answer and that they 
may discontinue study participation at any time. 
c) Emotional Distress: Participants will be asked questions that may be sensitive in nature. Participants 
may find the questions distressing or find the questions make them feel uncomfortable. Participants will be informed that they may refuse to answer any question(s) that they do not wish to answer and that they 
may discontinue study participation at any time. 
 
Si
nce patients  will all currently  be receiving prenatal  care or will be currently postpartum, there are no additional 
risks associated with participation in this study.  
Adequacy of Protection Against Risks  
 
Recruitment and Informed Consent  
Study  participants  will be recruited from local MUSC  clinics.  Pregnant and postpartum  patients  identified via the 
EMR through a recruitment report (research data request) will be sent a message inviting them to participate in 
a research study. Interested patients will complete determination of eligibility via MUSC’s REDCap system, a secure, HIPAA -compliant data management system. All participants will review consent documents and will 
provide informed consent consistent with procedures outlined above. Participants will be given the opportunity to ask questions  about their participation throughout the course  of the study. A copy  of the informed consent will 
be kept centrally  at our study  office within locked filing cabinets, and a copy  will be given  to each study  participant 
as well. Participants will be given a study phone number and e-mail address to contact [CONTACT_561307]. 
 
Protections  Against Loss  of Confidentiality  
All screening information will be kept in a password protected REDCap  database. Only key study  personnel  will 
have access to the database. If an individual is not eligible to participate based on her answers to the eligibility 
survey, her screener will not include her name [CONTACT_122541] [CONTACT_3031]. Only people who meet eligibility criteria based on the answers  to the eligibility survey will  be asked if they would like to be contact[CONTACT_826131]. Eligible participants’ full name, telephone number and 
Version  #11 07/29/[ADDRESS_1145859] or in MUSC Box. 
The REDCap  database and the study  enrollment log are the only places  where participants’  names  and subject 
identification numbers appear together. Eligible participants will be assigned a subject number, will complete 
informed consent, will be randomized, will complete baseline assessments, and subsequently will receive their 
randomized intervention.  
 
Upon completing eligibility  screening, if study  eligible,  individuals  will be provided with an overview  of the study, 
asked to review  study  procedures  via a consent form, and asked to provide signed consent. Participants  will be 
informed of limitations of confidentiality (i.e., abuse or neglect, intention to harm self or someone else) both 
verbally and/or in writing during the informed consent process. The consent form will include the participant’s 
name, but not his/her subject number. Consent forms will be provided in English.  
Regarding questionnaire  data, data will be obtained for research purposes  only. All data will be collected,  stored, 
and managed via REDCap, which is a secure, web-based application designed exclusively to support data capture for research studies. REDCap provides secure, web-based flexible applications, including real time 
validation rules with automated data type and range checks at the time of entry. The underlying database is 
hosted in a secure data center at MUSC, a secure environment for data systems and servers on campus, and 
includes  redundancy, failover  capability, backups  and extensive security  checks.  The system  has several  layers 
of protection including user/group account management, "Data Access  Groups" which allow  data to be entered 
by [CONTACT_253757], audit trails for all changes, 
queries  and reports, and Secure  Sockets  Layer  (SSL) encryption. Name  [CONTACT_826133] [CONTACT_826132], in accordance 
with HIPAA. All data will be identified only by [CONTACT_63903] (participant IDs). Participant IDs will be linked to 
participants’  names  in a password-protected file that is accessible  only to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_66171].  Voice 
sample data gathered through Surveylex  for specific aim  [ADDRESS_1145860] with Neurolex. MUSC  currently  pays 
NeuroLex $100/month for access to their software. MUSC may collect [ADDRESS_1145861]’s 
coded participant ID, and no other identifying information. Access to the SurveyLex account will be limited to 
research study staff. Staff at NeuroLex will not access this data. 
Voice  features  collected through SurveyLex  will be downloaded and stored on an MUSC  Box account, accessible 
only to study staff.

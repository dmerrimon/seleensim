Version date: 07/31/[ADDRESS_901059] area (in between teeth), limited salivary access, and poor flossing 
compliance in children and adolescents when flossing themselves3. Currently, for initial non-
cavitated, demineralized lesions in these high caries risk patients, the standard of care has been to: reinforce oral hygiene instruction, advise in reducing the frequency of fermentable 
carbohydrate consumption, observe the incipi[INVESTIGATOR_667379] 6 months, and promote remineralization of the carious lesion with in-
office application of topi[INVESTIGATOR_217110] (i.e. 5% sodium fluoride varnish) over all teeth
4,5. 
Depending on the patient and the circumstances of their oral health condition, the practitioner may consider treating these lesions with restorations but a conservative, preventive approach 
is usually  the initial goal of treatment.  
 
Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) has been used for many years internationally, but in August 2014, SDF was cleared by [CONTACT_4760] a medical device to treat dental hypersensitivity.
6  
More recently, the FDA granted SDF “Breakthrough Therapy Designation” on October 30, [ADDRESS_901060]: 
Advantage Arrest Silver Diamine Fluoride 38% by [CONTACT_667386].
6 The current 
formulation of 38% SDF is 25% silver for its antimicrobial effects, 5% fluoride for remineralization, and 8% ammonia to keep the silver and fluoride in solution.
6,7 It has been 
touted as a very safe6,7 and possible noninvasive alternative and/or adjunct to topi[INVESTIGATOR_667380].[ADDRESS_901061] 
subsequent or neighboring bacteria in a “zombie effect” to prevent incidence of new caries as 
explained by [CONTACT_667387].[ADDRESS_901062] caries over time6.  
Version date: 07/31/[ADDRESS_901063] area. The decision to treat initial 
interproximal lesions in children can be difficult when weighing patient behavior, extent of 
treatment and prognosis considerations. While there are other methods to treat interproximal 
caries such as resin infiltration, Mattos -Silveira et al. reports that there was a significant 
difference in children’s discomfort when comparing resin infiltration to flossing or SDF application to initial interproximal caries lesions.
12 Currently, there is another study by 
[CONTACT_667388] -Silveira et al. in progress in Brazil that looks at the application of SDF in arresting 
interproximal carious lesions.13 This study uses a lower concentration (30%) than the current 
product used in the [LOCATION_002]. Based on another study (Mei, ML et.al.) the 38% concentration of SDF appears to have a greater inhibition of metalloproteinases when 
compared to the 30% SDF and potentially this could lead to a greater arresting effect
14.  
Elevate Oral Care15 and others16 have suggested applying SDF to interproximal caries with 
the use of a woven or spongy floss, such as Oral-B Super Floss®. Like typi[INVESTIGATOR_667381], Super Floss is made of nylon, but the non-waxed fibers have an interlocking network which gives it 
its spongy texture. Its sponginess is presumed to be more absorbent, allowing for easier 
delivery and application of SDF to interproximal carious lesions due to limited access with a 
microbrush. In 1981, Tsutsumi showed a significant reduction in the progress of existing 
caries and significant reduction in incidence of new caries in human primary molars when 
comparing flossing with plain unwaxed floss to SDF applied with unwaxed floss
17. 
Therefore, Super Floss should be considered as a method for SDF delivery to interproximal lesions, but there is currently no information as to the efficacy of this treatment modality. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether 1) SDF application using Super Floss 
can halt the progression/arrest and/or reverse/remineralize the initial interproximal 
caries and 2) whether SDF applied with Super Floss is more effective in arresting or 
remineralizing incipi[INVESTIGATOR_667382]:  
a) SDF applied without Super Floss or  
b) Fluoride varnish applied alone  
1.2 We hypothesize that:  
Version date: 07/31/[ADDRESS_901064] and/or remineralize initial 
interproximal lesions.  
1.[ADDRESS_901065] if 38% SDF application using Super Floss 
can reliably arrest caries in superficial interproximal lesions as determined by [CONTACT_667389]. 
2.[ADDRESS_901066] if SDF applied with Super Floss will be more effective than  
SDF applied without Super Floss or fluoride varnish applied alone in arresting initial  
interproximal caries also as determined by [CONTACT_667390]. 
3.0 STUDY  DESIGN  
3.1  Caries criteria is defined into 5 groups based on the zone of radiolucency using the International Caries Classification and Management System (ICCMS)
18. This classification 
will be used by [CONTACT_667391]
[ADDRESS_901067] area and preventing overlap in the proximal teeth in question. ICCMS Classification is described a s 
follows (Appendix I):  
i. 0: No radiolucency/no caries – not included in study  
ii. RA: Initial Stages – These are the target interproximal lesions for the present study 
● 1: Radiolucency in the outer half of enamel,  
● 2-Dentin -enamel Junction (DEJ): lesions extending within the inner 
half of enamel but not to DEJ,  
● 2+DEJ: lesions extending within the inner half of enamel including the DEJ,  
● 3: lesions extending to the outer one-third of dentin past the DEJ, and  
Version date: 07/31/22  
5 
 iii. RB: Moderate Stages and beyond – These lesions will not included in present 
study because it is currently the standard of care to provide appropriate dental 
restorative treatment to repair the caries.  
3.2  Each child with interproximal lesions on deciduous molar teeth meeting eligibility criteria RA Category 1, 2, or 3 will be invited to participate. Those who agree to participate will be 
randomly allocated to one of three treatments: Fluoride varnish (Control) application alone 
versus SDF application without Super Floss (Control) versus SDF application with Super 
Floss (Intervention). Daily flossing and oral hygiene instruction will be taught to patients of 
all study groups. Inclusion, Exclusion, and Wi thdrawal criteria are below in Section 5.  
3.3  Follow-Up: Recall examinations and treatment reapplication will be done at 3 months, 6 
months, and 12 months after the initial visit in accordance with current American Academy 
of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) guidelines for high caries risks patients
5. Bitewing 
radiographs will be taken at 6 months and 12 months. This is in accordance with the “Prescribing Dental Radiographs…” guidelines as approved by [CONTACT_667392]
20, which state that 
bitewing radiographs in high risk children with dental caries are recommended every 6-12 months.   
3.4  Providers: Residents and Attendings at the Ostrow School of Dentistry at USC, Pediatric 
Residency Program. All residents and attendings participating in this study will be trained 
and standardized on how to identify lesions of interest on radiographs, obtain consent, and 
apply the medications.  
3.5 Tracking of study participants: We will count the number of participants who:  
1. Those who are asked to participate  
2. Those who consent 
3. Those who drop out before randomization/after randomization 
4. Those who withdraw by [CONTACT_667393] 
5. Those who are lost to follow up 
Note: We will only collect and store clinical data for those participants who continue 
throughout the duration of the project. If a participant decides to drop out of the study at any 
time, then we will no longer collect data from the medical record during their ongoing 
clinical care. We will also discard any previous data we have collected on the participants 
that drop out.

 4.4.3 Super Floss: N/A 
4.5 Toxicity or adverse effects,:  
4.5.1 SDF: SDF is corrosive to metal and glass, and can be an eye, skin, mucosal, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], and gastrointestinal irritant. Repeated overexposures may cause mottled 
teeth or fluorosis on teeth/bones (not in the dosage used in this study).  
 In the UCSF Protocol by [CONTACT_667387]. 2016, they found SDF to be extremely safe, citing 
not one adverse event in over 80 years of use in Japan and mild temporary side effects 
found in 3 of 1,493 subjects in 9 clinical trials.  The lethal dose (LD50) of SDF, 
determined by [CONTACT_667395], was found to be: 520 mg/kg by 
[CONTACT_177146], and 380 mg/kg by [CONTACT_667396]. Considering a 
small child weighing 10kg with caries, the dose would be 0.95mg/kg (One drop of 
SDF contai ns 9.5mg and one drop is usually adequate to treat one patient). For that 
10kg child, the relative safety margin of using an entire drop would be: 380 mg/kg LD50 / 0.95 mg/kg dose = 400-fold safety margin. 
4.5.2 Fluoride varnish:  
● Sodium Fluoride: Oral rat LD50: 52 mg/kg  
● Ethanol: Oral rat LD50: 7060 mg/kg 
Fluoride varnish can be an irritant with direct eye contact [CONTACT_667397]. 
If ingested, it may cause salivation, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headaches, or 
dizziness. Repeated overexposures may cause fluorosis. 
For a similar calculation above for a 10kg child, the relative safety margin of using an 
entire 0.4 mL unit (one package) of fluoride varnish would be: 52 mg/kg LD50 / 2.0 
mg/kg = 26-fold safety margin. 
4.5.3 Super Floss: There are no toxic or adverse effects listed, and there are no hazards when used as directed.  
4.6 Non-medical Side Effects:  
4.6.1 SDF: SDF stains carious lesions. It also can have a bitter or metallic taste. It can also 
stain or darken skin with a ‘temporary tattoo’ which resolves in 2-[ADDRESS_901071] surfaces like table tops as we ll as clothing.

process (parental permission and assent, if applicable), they will be randomized to one of the 
three treatments 1:1:1 using a cluster -randomized design. That is, pa rticipants, not teeth, will 
be randomized, though multiple teeth per participant may be treated. Using the uniform distribution, the statistician will generate a random number sequence. We will use blocked 
randomization (blocks of six) to better ensure an even distribution across groups. Once group

containing the random study arm assignments, which the investigators will use sequentially, 
as study participants accrue (i.e., the study identification number will match the number on 
the envelope).   
7.0 STUDY  AGENT  ADMINISTRATION  OR INTERVENTION AND  TOXICITY  
MANAGEMENT  PLAN  
7.1 Treatment protocol after patients are randomized into one of three treatment groups:  
7.1.1 Fluoride varnish application (Control - Group 1) : Bulk saliva removed with saliva 
ejector. All teeth wiped dry with cotton gauze. One unit dose (0.4 ml) of fluoride 
varnish will be applied to all dentition then interproximal surfaces of all teeth will be 
flossed.  
i. Professionally applied fluoride varnish has been shown to inhibit demineralization and enhance remineralization in early enamel caries.
22 
Current Caries Risk Assessment (CRA) protocol indicates fluoride varnish applications at 3 -6 months intervals for high caries risk patients.
4,5  
7.1.2  SDF application with Super Floss (Intervention - Group 2) : Petroleum jelly will be 
applied to lips and face to protect the skin from staining. Teeth will then be dried with 
an air -water syringe or wiped with gauze. Super Floss will be flossed through contact 
[CONTACT_667398]. The practitioner will apply SDF to the superfloss on the buccal or lingual aspect and then over the occlusal embrasure. Provider can visualize SDF being 
absorbed to the other end of the superfloss due to the blue tint of the SDF. Super floss 
will remain between the teeth, allowing the SDF to absorb, for one minute. Super floss 
is then removed and excess SDF removed with gauze or cotton roll. Fluoride varnish is 
applied over all teeth afterwards per high risk CRA protocol and current standard of 
care
4,5. 
7.1.3  SDF application without Super Floss ( Intervention Control - Group 3): Petroleum jelly 
will be applied to lips and face to protect the skin from staining. Teeth will then be dried with an air-water syringe or wiped with gauze, and teeth with interproximal 
caries isolated. SDF will be applied with microbrush over the occlus al embrasure of 
the interproximal surfaces of the target teeth. Excess SDF removed with gauze or

 7.3 Criteria for removal from treatment  
7.3.1 If a carious lesion is arrested or remineralizes  in any treatment group, this is 
considered a stable lesion. The patient will continue on with that treatment modality 
(ie. reapplication at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months) until the tooth exfoliates or 
other comprehensive dental treatment is required. That lesion will continue to be 
monitored for any change in progress.  
7.3.2 Treatment will be discontinued if a patient experiences any persistent eye, skin, oral 
mucosa, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], and gastrointestinal irritation that are considered Grade 2 and above adverse events.  
7.3.3  Treatment will be discontinued if a patient experiences any allergic reactions or sensitivities to SDF.  
7.3.4 Patients will discontinue treatment if or when a carious lesion progresses to ICCMS 
category 4 or beyond. The patient will be notified and scheduled for routine operative 
dental procedures (ie. restorations) to treat the carious lesion. 
7.3.5 Treatment will be discontinued if patient becomes intolerant to SDF or their behavior 
does not allow for safe and proper application of protocol.  
7.3.6 A patient may always be removed from treatment whenever he/she wishes.

 8.0 ASSESSMENT  OF EFFICACY  AND  SAFETY  
8.1 Assessment of Efficacy will be based on size/depth of carious lesion comparisons between 
initial (Day 1) dental radiographs and subsequent time lapse radiographs taken at 6 and 12 
month visits. This frequency (every 6 months) of radiographs is the current standard of care 
for patients with high caries risk4,5, including those with lesions being monitored. 
8.2 Side effects/Toxicities to be monitored.  
8.2.1 Side effects/toxicities that the patient is to be asked about or examined at each 
evaluation while on treatment include: Eye, skin, mucosa, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], and 
gastrointestinal irritation.  
8.2.2 No long-term toxicities to be monitored after completion of therapy.   
8.3 No dosage change based on Grade 1 Adverse Events (AE)/toxicity. If the patient develops 
temporary Grade [ADDRESS_901080] not been documented in previous 
studies and are not expected in our study as well. 
8.4 Adverse Event Reporting:  
8.4.[ADDRESS_901081], then 
they can call the CHLA Pediatric Dental Clinic during business hours or there will be a pediatric dental resident on -call after hours. We will also report the event to the IRB 
within 48 hours. 
8.4.2 Places for submitting reports: Adverse Event Reports will be submitted only to the 
IRB as there are no sponsors of the proposed research.

12.0 DATA  COLLECTION  AND  MONITORING  
As the study is small and preliminary in nature, there are is no formal monitoring committee.  
However, the statistician will monitor the progress of the study to assess accrual rate and data 
quality throughout the progress of the study.  Once collected, t he data will be cleaned, 
Version date: 07/31/[ADDRESS_901084] 
and visual examinations.  
13.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1 The proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_667383]1 – RA3 on the International Caries C lassification and 
Management System (ICCMS): (1) Fluoride varnish (FV, current standard of care, control), (2) Super floss + SDF + FV, (3) SDF + FV.  We hypothesize that group [ADDRESS_901085] 
outcomes, as measured by [CONTACT_667403], (higher score indicates 
progression) followed by [CONTACT_19313] 3.  As we could find no data on ICCMS-defined progression 
or remineralization rates for either Super Floss or fluoride, we were unable to calculate 
power. Instead, we provide estimates of recruitment based on feasibility. We expect to accrue 
approximately 20 participants , with 2 qualifying teeth per participant, in each group.  
10% loss to follow up has increased dramatically to ~48%. Given this unexpected setback, we 
now need to continue recruiting participants to reach sufficient power. We originally planned 
to enroll [ADDRESS_901086].  We will further assess 
Version date: 07/31/22  
15 
 the relationship between these two variables using generalized estimating equations, 
specifying a Poisson (or negative binomial, if overdispersed) family and a log link. We will 
also specify an exchangeable correlation matrix and a robust standard error.  
 
Since the study is randomized, we do not anticipate needing to adjust for any confounders. 
However, should we find any differences in demographic or clinical variables at baseline, we 
will investigate them as potential confounders, which will be defined as those variables 
which alter the odds ratio by >15% when included in the model.  
  
For those with missing data on outcomes or other covariates to be included in the model, we 
will consider multiple imputation methods if the amount of missing data is <10%. To assess 
the impact of missing data, we will compare those with missing data to th ose not missing 
data with respect to demographic and clinical variables to assess comparability. Should imputation be utilized, a sensitivity analysis will be conducted excluding those for whom 
data was imputed to assess the impact of imputation.  
 
Model fit will be evaluated by [CONTACT_667404].  As we are 
conducting an interim analysis, we will use a two -sided Bonferroni- corrected p -value of 
a=.[ADDRESS_901087] to classifying the outcome of the x- rays, we will calculate and report Kappa. All 
statistical analyses will be done using Stata 15.0 (College Station, TX).   
Power Analysis  
We calculated power using a cluster -randomized design.  We were unable to locate any 
previous studies examining the impact of these three treatments (or any two) using the same 
classification system as our outcome.  However, we were able to obtain an estim ate of 0.0 to

 of the study, we will inflate the sample size by ~ 48% and recruit a total of 54-60 participants 
(108-120 caries ).  Sample size was calculated using PASS Software v.14.0 (Kayesville, UT). 
 
This study is powered to detect an effect in a population of children who are predominantly 
non-white.  Therefore, the sample size as calculated is likely to result in a sample size with 
reasonable power to detect an effect near the size outlined above, if  perhaps slightly larger.

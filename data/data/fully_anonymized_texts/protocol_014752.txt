Using Twitter to Enhance the Social 
Support of Hispanic and Black 
Dementia Caregivers
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
IRB approved on 09/13/[ADDRESS_60014] been
demonstrated to help mitigate these issues.5, 9 The expansion of social media use, particularly Twitter, among
Hispanics and Blacks,10-15 offers great promise for improving social support for Hispanic and Black dementia
caregivers.16 In addition, the availability of large volumes of Tweets and associated metadata make it possible
to apply innovative data science methods to characterize engagement in a social support intervention and to
assess its ef ficacy over time.17-27 However, analytic frameworks for analyzing content and social network
structures in Twitter communities are relatively new and evolving rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], and there has been limited use of
Twitter for intervention delivery.16
Our r esearch team has c onducted federally -funded research with Twitter data sinc e 2009 and published a 
practical t utorial on Twitter m ining in the American Journal o f Preventiv e Medicine in 2013.25 More recently, 
through the New Y ork C ity Hispanic D em entia Caregiver R esearch Program (R01 NR014430) and a 
supplement (R01 NR014430-0 3S2) w hich focused on understanding mechanisms of s ocial support in Twitter, 
we have developed a Tweet corpus of >2.[ADDRESS_60015] applied data science-b ased cultural anal ytic tec hniques for Tw itter data mining and 
devel oped innovation visualizations for Twitter data.17, 1 9-27 Analyses of Tweet topi[INVESTIGATOR_55477] a high frequency 
of social s upport topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102] a nd revealed that the sentiments of Hispanic dem entia caregivers w ere primarily 
negative.17, 1 9-21, 24 Network anal yses revealed a high proportion of isolates (i.e., Tweets w ithout responses) an d 
a low proportion of balanced micro-n etwor ks, suggesting sub-o ptimal s ocial s uppor t in the networks.17-22, 24 We 
also created a databas e of >1600 online resources for dem entia caregiving.17-22, 24 This s ubstantial preliminary 
work provides evidence that our research team is uniquely qualified to operationalize, implement, and evaluate 
a Twitter-b ased social
 support intervention for Hispanic and Black dementia caregivers.17-31
2. Study Design and Statistical Procedures
Design: The study purpose will be achieved through a quasi -experimental design (non- equivalent [ADDRESS_60016] design). The intervention group is  anonymous followers of two Twitter accounts established:
the African American/Black dementia caregiver group and the Hispanic dementia caregiver group. No
personally identifiable information (PII)  under the definition used by [CONTACT_55486] (NIST) such as names, addresses, date of birth, and email addresses will be collected. Instead,
we will analyze publicly available Tweet data for network engagement (count of pressing 'like, ' 'retweet,' 'reply '
button), emotional valence (auto-calculation from Tweet text messages : "this is so helpful "-emotion score +4, "I
face many challenges "- emotion score -6 ), topic changes, the volume of isolates, size and number of
communities, and communication types for our outcome variables. T o examine general confounders, three
demographic elements (self -reported age, gender, race/ethnicity , un-linkable to name, phone, email, or
address).
The intervention is s ummarized in table 1 and comprises the posting of one Tweet per day , replying or directly 
messaging followers, liking someone else's  Tweet, retweeting someone else 's Tweet, and a monthly Twitter 
chat at an established time. The Tweet messages which the IRB will approve from our Aim 2 will be used as 
an intervention. In addition, Twitter who re-c onfirm Twitter terms of the agreement, including privacy policy 
and terms 
of service (Appendix attached), will be required for this study. If someone decides to follow one of 
our accounts  (i.e., participate in the intervention) and subsequently changes their mind, they can easily 
change stop following our
 networks. We will retain our de-i dentified Twitter followers for our Twitter 
communities i n multipl e ways: 1) w e will i nvite caregivers i n the dementia caregiver registries ( including the 
NHiRP p roject) , who agreed to be contact[CONTACT_5365] t he future study, developed by D rs. Luchsinger a nd Mittelman 
to follow the r elevant Twitter ac counts; 2) w e will use online advertising function for m arketing our Twitter 
communities us ing TwitterAds ( 15 days i n Year 3 and 15 days i n Year 4); 3) r esearch flyers w ill be posted in 
relevant clinics; 4) w e will s end an invitation via Twitter to the publicly av ailable user IDs ( estimated Black us er 
IDs-2500, estimated Hispanic user IDs -1800); 4) using the @mention function, we will ask the existing 
organization and community leaders (e.g., @alzassociation, which has 107K followers) to retweet our invitation 
messages to reach out their followers; and 5) monthly, we will determine if there are any new key 
dementia/Alzheimer 's Twitter community leaders and send out an invitation to the publicly available user I.D. s.

The setting, Sample, and Power Analysis: T he setting is the U.S. The Sa mple will be the de-i dentified flowers 
of one of the two dementia caregiver networks  (Hispanic, Black). Given our recruitment strategies and 
preliminary w
ork, we anticipate recruiting > 400 de-i dentified followers in each group. Based on similar Twitter 
communities
 (e.g., @ dementiatoday), population N is estimated at 153,300 for 365 days.
For statistical analyses, the necessary sample sizes for hypothesis 1 and hypothesis 2 based upon the power 
analy sis34 are d escribed below. Hypothesis  1 focuses on within-g roup differences and Hypothesis 2 on 
between-g roup differences . The hypotheses include both continuous (emotion valence) and binary (% of 
isolates) outcome variables.  
 Hypothesis 1: Assuming a correlation of pre- and post-t est conservatively: reliability of [ADDRESS_60017] for binary outcomes (% of isolates) is McNemar's test. The minimum required sample 
size is 208. Thus, the proposed sample sizes will be adequate to test within-group differences.
 Hypothesis 2: The total minimum required sample size in each ethnic group (Black and Hispanic) will 
be [ADDRESS_60018] size 0.332 (Cohen's d).  Assuming that α=0.05, 1-β=0.80 (power), the total 
minimum required sample size for the two groups  (Black and Hispanic) with effect size 0.1525 (P 0-P1) is 318 
(159 per group). 
Data analysis: Extensive processing is required before the actual data analysis , which comprises data 
science methods and statistical tests for our hypotheses. 
Data processing
: We will process Twitter data for data analyses through several steps:1) merging of 
data files
 in our institutional high performance computing (HPC) environment (Habanero), 2) converting XML to 
txt file format into a human-r eadable format for integrity checking, 3) feature selection, and 4) indexing.35 
Data science analyses  for publicly available de-i dentified data : We will use a variety of software 
packages  (R, Python, Nvivo, ORA, NodeXL, SAS) for the data science analyses. Since Twitter user 
demographics and personal data are not directly available, we will apply algorithms to users' Tweets  and 
images to estimate their demographics, including those considered Social Determinants of Health.36-39 We will 
stratify those variables into categories  for data analysis procedures as relevant. To answer research question 
1, we will
 descriptively characterize (e.g., #Tweets, # followers, #likes, #retweets) Twitter activity in the two 
networks
. To address  the second research question, we will apply Syuzhet sentiment analysis and LDA to 
characterize
 negative affect scores and topic models, respectively. For the third research question, we will 
compute the network measures listed in Table 1. 
 Emotional valence, expressing topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102], and conversational styles in macro-, meso - and micro-l evel among 
de-identified Twitter followers will be computed from publicly available Tweet data. Unlike the traditional 
methods, data scienc e methods such as natural language processing (NLP) and network analyses enable us 
to detect emotional
 valence score, changes in topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102], volume of isolates, and communication styles without 
asking the users
 any questionnaires. The following table summarizes concepts, measurements, units of 
analy sis, and data science analytic  methods.  
Statistical Analyses : Pre-post comparisons will be examined from baseline (3 months pre-intervention) 
to 3 months  (9-12) months after initiation of the intervention. Analyses of pre-post mean differences will be 
performed using SAS PROC TTEST, PROC Mixed, PROC GLIMMIX, and PROC CATMOD , with adjustments for the 
correlation within participants induced by [CONTACT_55487]. 
The continuous outcome will be analyzed using SAS PROC TTEST,  PROC  Mixed , and the binary outcome will Table 1. Concepts, Measures, Data Science Methods and Units of Analysis

3. Study P rocedures
Procedure: Publicly  avai lable Tw eet data (e.g., Tweets, time stamp, self-r eported location) from de-i dentified 
Twitter fol lowers of our Tw i tter s ites w ill be obtained from the public dat abase. No personally i dentifiable 
information (PII) under the definiti on used by [CONTACT_55488] (NIST) s uch 
as nam es, addresses, date of birth, and email addresses w ill be collected. We will a nalyze publicly av ailable 
Tweet data for em otional v alence (auto-e stimation from Tw eet messages), topic c hanges, the volume of 
isolates, s ize and number of communities, and communication types for our outc ome variables. In addition, 
three demographic el ements (i.e., self-reported age, gender, race/ethnicity, which are un-l inkable to their PI[INVESTIGATOR_55479]) 
will be collected to examine general c onfounders . Again, no PII will be used or ac cessed. 
Intervention: Two Tweeters, including a bilingual Hispanic, will strictly follow the intervention delivery protocol 
developed in Aim [ADDRESS_60019] a Tweet from the Tweet library to each Twitter community alternating among those 
related to information, instrumental, emotional, and appraisal support. The Tweeter will also engage in social 
net
work activities by [CONTACT_55489], liking, and retweeting messages posted by [CONTACT_2312]. This intervention will be 
consistently
 conducted (e.g., time, center brand themes, designs) to enhance intervention fidelity.63 After a 
Tweet is posted, followers can respond using Twitter functions (e.g., retweet to quote and disseminate our 
Tw
eet message, posting a Tweet message to ex press their after thoughts and questions using @mention, like, 
and
 reply function). In addition, the P.I. w ill examine the archive files to monitor intervention fidelity and 
reinforc
e expected behaviors of the Tweeters as needed. 
Publicly av ailable Twitter d ata collection: During the baseli ne (3 months pre-i ntervention) and intervention (365 
days c rossing Years 3 and 4) periods, we will c ollect publicly available Tweet messages and associated 
metadata (e.g., userID, relationship , time stamp, Tweet, Hashtags, Twitter page, geo code, location, type) 
daily. We will al so double-c heck the data integrity (e.g., incompletely c aptured data) dai ly. In terms  of missing 
Tw
itter data,64 we will m ake an effort to minimize missing data in 3 ways: our des ignated Tweeters and the P .I. 
will be available duri ng data collection, two collection tools ( NodeXL and NCapture) will be used, and collection 
of Tweets w ill be monitored daily to ensure that capture was adequate and with no PII. Figure 1 shows an 
example of publicly av ailable data collected.  
Figure 1. An example of publicly av ailable data collected v ia NodeX L: Vertex 1 and 2 will be used for m acro, 
meso , and micro level netw ork anal yses. Tweet text with no personal i dentifiers w ill be used for t ext analys es, 
including emotion score calculation and topic m odeling. 

4. Study Drugs or Devices
Not applicable
5. Study Instruments (e.g., Questionnaires, Interview Outlines, Focus Group Guides)
No direct instrumentations such as  questionnaires (i.e., survey, interview) will be applied for the outcome
measurers. Instead, emotional valence, topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102], and conversational styles in macro-,meso- and micro-level
among anonymous Twitter followers will be computed from the publicly available Tweet data. Unlike the
traditional methods, data science methods such as n atural language processing (NLP) and network analyses
enable us to detect emotional valence score, changes in topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102], volume of isolates, and communication styles
without asking the users. T able 1 above in Data Analyses  summarizes concepts, measurements, units of
analysis , and data science analytic methods.
6. Study Subjects
Inclusion criteria: The anonymous dementia caregivers must be 18 years of age or older, Black or Hispanic, 
living in the U.S. including the U.S. territories, a dementia caregiver with any duration, able to speak English or 
Spanish/bilingual . The participants must agree to terms of conditions of use and privacy policy and rules of one 
of the two dementia caregiver networks (Hispanic and Black), the Twitter user agreement of 
the terms of service, Twitter privacy policy , and Twitter rules , including intellectual property, violence, 
misconduct, abus ive behavior, private information and spam and security, and use a smartphone or a feature 
phone (i.e., a cell phone with text messaging).  
Screening/Determining Eligibility  
Upon a Twitter user follows one of our  Twitter network s after seeing our advertisement on Twitter or our flyers  
from our clinics and emails , our team will automatically receive a new follower  notification from Twitter. Within 
24 hours  during the weekdays (72 hours during the weekend), our Tweeter/coordinator will send a screening 
message via the direct message function in Twitter (script attached) and respond if they are eligible to 
participate in our research Twitter networks (script attached). 
When a Twitter user meets our inclusion criteria, the study staff will remind the user regarding our Twitter 
networks as a research study , voluntary participation, and unfollowing our Twitter networking sites at any time. 
Furthermore, using the direct message function via Twitter, our study staffs  will ensure that the eligible user 1) 
creates an anonymous Twitter handle if the person uses h is/her full name [INVESTIGATOR_17174] a Twitter handle, and 2) hides 
their names from the profile setting. When a Twitter user does not meet our inclusion criteria, our  study staff 
will request them  unfollowing our Twitter network via a direct message function (script attached). Ineligible 
followers will be blocked within [ADDRESS_60020].  
7.Recruitment
Considering 60% attrition rate of anonymous online users, we anticipate to enroll >400 per group, to accrue
up to a total of 800 (400 per group, total minimum required Sam ple are 318 users: 159 per group) and retain 
anonymous  followers (no actual name [CONTACT_55495]/email address on the profile or Twitter handle) for our 
Tw
itter communities in multiple ways: 1) A flyer will be distributed up to 5 times (per a week) via an email to 
the caregivers, who agreed to be contact[CONTACT_55490], in the dementia caregiver registries; 2) we 
will
 use an online advertising function for marketing our Twitter communities using TwitterAds (15 days in 
Year
 3 and 15 days in Year 4); 3) research flyers will be posted in relevant clinics (i.e., AIM clinic and 
neurology units at CUIMC); 4) using the @mention function, we will ask the community leaders (e.g., 
@alzassociation, which has 107K followers)  to post our flyer; and 5) every month, we will contact [CONTACT_55491]. This study does not offer any incentives (e.g., no online 
credits, no monetary compensation).
8.Informed C
onsent with waiver of documentation (45 CFR 46.116)
Informed consent will be obtained with a waiver of documentation (e.g., signature). Anonymous Twitter users 
without PII (no name, email address, phone number, or addresses are linkable) will partic ipate in this study, 
analyzing publicly available de-i dentified data. Accidental  PII exposure will be s trictly prohibited (see four 
strategies in privacy protection) and monitored daily. Therefore, this researc h to post social 
support messages to our Twitter network followers  involves minimal risk to the subject. The signature [CONTACT_55496].  
9.Confidentiality of Study Data
Our study data will comprise 1) publicly available Twitter data and 2) three demographic elements, including 
self
-reported age, gender, and race/ethnicity (un-l inkable to name, email address, phone number).   For  both,  
our team strictly follows the institutional policy  for computers and endpoint devices to store the Tweet corpora.  
Data preprocessing and manipulation will occur using the secure data repositories at the Columbia University  
Medical
 Center, such that no data we collect will be stored out of our control. We will use a secured network for 
the
 Department of General Medicine for temporary  storage for daily data collection, as well as a university-
provided fully
 encry pted laptop and a university-p rovided fully  encrypted external drive for the long term backup  
purpose. Although our Twitter data does not contain personally identifiable information, all data will be  
managed and stored under our institutional policy  which all endpoint devices of our research team should be 
protected with 256
-bit encryption (at minimum), which severely restricts access to the data in a far superior  
manner
 than password protection. For data sharing and preparation, we will use a passcode-p rotected  
Columbia University Habanero HPC environment for the transient file storage while merging, converting, and  
computing the large volume of data
10. Privacy
 Protections
The anonymous followers of our Twitter sites will be informed that no identifiers such as names or email 
addresses will be stored in the data collection. Their PII, such as email addresses  and names if the participants 
contact[CONTACT_55492], will be removed from the recruitment 
documentation on the day of data collection. All data will be de-i dentified before analysis, and no identifying 
information about the individual will be used in reporting the study results.We will implement the following  
protections against risks:
1)Warning: our two dementia caregiver Twitter networks will have a privacy protection reminder with a 
warning sign on  their title pages. O ur Twitter network sites will include short and relevant privacy 
statements (i.e., sharing aggregate data of age group and estimated gender, how  to contact [CONTACT_55493]'s data protection officer.)
2)Reminding: a designated research team member will post a welcome video reminding the target  
audience about the protection of privacy using a Tweet direct message function upon a participant  
following (subscribing) our Twitter sites and post a reminder Tweet about privacy protection onc e a 
week
 (i.e.,  Posting self-i dentifiable photos, names, email address or phone number will be strictly  
prohibited).
3)Monitoring - Privacy: a designated research team member will monitor user-g enerated content daily  for 
the risks of exposure to PII.
4)Monitoring – Content: A designated research team member will remove Misleading or inappropriate  
content as necessary daily.
11. Potential Risks
There are
 some minimal risks  specific to this study. First, though we will not collect any  direct PI[INVESTIGATOR_55480], and all analyses are done at an aggregate level, followers (i.e., site  
users/study participants) may accidentally post texts or images that contain PII. Second, there is a possibility 
that followers
 may post information that is inaccurate and potentially harmful.
12. Potential benefits of
 the proposed research to the subjects and others
Those w
ho participate in the Twitter-based intervention study may perceived increased social support 
(informational, instrumental, emotional, appraisal) and may feel belongingness which is a human basic need. 
13. Importance of the knowledge to be gainedThe important contributions of this study to knowledge development are both substantive and methodological. 
The study will extend what is known about dementia caregiving in minority populations and the mechanisms of 
social support. Moreover, the study will expand what is known about using Twitter as a mode for intervention delivery and  methods for creating culture-specific lexica and culturally-sensitive Tweet messages and analysis 
of Twitter data.  
14. Alternatives
This research involves an intervention that presents no greater than minimal risk to participants. If participants 
change their minds , they can easily change a setting to stop following our Twitter networks. 
15. Data and Safety Monitoring
Although our Tw eet corpora only i nclude publicly available Twitter data, our team s trictly fol lows the 
institutional policy for c omputers and endpoint devices to store the Tweet corpora. Data preprocessing and 
manipulation will occur using the secure data repositories  at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center. No 
data we collect will
 be stored out of our control. We will use a secured network for the General Medicine for 
temporary storage for daily data collection, as well as a university-p rovided fully  encrypted laptop and a 
university-p rovided fully encrypted external drive for the long term backup purpose. Although our Twitter data 
does
 not contain personally identifiable information, all data will be managed and stored under our institutional 
policy wh ich all endpoint devices of our research team should be protected with 256-b it encryption (at 
minimum), which severely restricts access to the data in a far superior manner than password protection. For 
data sharing and preparation, we will
 use a passcode-p rotected Columbia University  Terremoto HPC 
environment for the transient file storage while merging, converting, and computing the large volume of data,
